SELF-OTHER ASYMMETRY AND COVID ANXIETY

Abstract
Thinking one is better than peers is generally associated with positive psychological
outcomes like increased self-esteem and resilience. However, this tendency may be problematic
in the context of collective action problems, wherein individuals are reliant on others’ prosocial
behaviors to achieve larger goals. We examined this question in the context of the Covid-19
pandemic, and recruited participants (n = 1022) from a university community in Spring 2020.
We found evidence for a self-peer asymmetry, such that participants reported that they were
doing more to stop the spread of the disease and were more prosocially motivated than peers.
Actual peer reports indicated that these were overestimations. This self-enhancement tendency
comes with a cost: the perceived self-peer asymmetry mediated the relationship between Covidspecific worry and general anxiety during the early lockdown period. This indicates that while
believing one is doing more than others may be maladaptive in collective action problems.

SELF-OTHER ASYMMETRY AND COVID ANXIETY

Whether it is thinking we are better drivers, better partners, or just plain better people, it
is clear that we generally tend to evaluate ourselves more favorably than we do others [1, 2, 3].
This bias potentially creates a psychological tension in large, densely networked societies,
wherein we often have to rely on other people in order to bring about substantive change. If
people are surrounded by others that they perceive as less competent, less knowledgeable, and
more selfish, then they may be particularly pessimistic about the likelihood of collective action
to bring about positive change. The Covid-19 epidemic reflects this tension more so than any
other time in recent memory — never have we been so reliant on others’ intentions and
behaviors to quickly produce positive societal outcomes. While self-other asymmetries may be
adaptive in many situations, they may be psychologically suboptimal in a situation that requires
relying on others for positive outcomes, what is known as a collective action problem. We test
this hypothesis by examining whether the individuals who are most likely to think they are better
than their peers are also the ones that psychologically fare worse when they are in a situation
(i.e., the Covid-19 pandemic) wherein achieving a positive outcome requires reliance on the
behaviors of others.

Thinking that we are better than others is usually quite adaptive. It is associated with
higher self-esteem [4], underlies predictions for rosier futures [5], and dulls recollections of lessthan-ideal pasts [6]. However this tendency can also lead to undue cynicism [7] and result in
inaccurate perceptions of both ourselves and others [8]. Indeed, individuals claim more
responsibility for task success and take less responsibility for task failure when completing a task
with distant others [8], and claim more responsibility for joint outcomes than is logically possible
[2, 7]. Often, self-enhancement is benign -- absent the occasional argument with a partner that

might come from overclaiming one’s contribution to the housework or the embarrassment of
receiving objective feedback about one’s driving, these biases may generally function as patterns
of cognition that boost positivity and increase creative productivity [9]. However, this cognitive
bias may become problematic when societal outcomes depend on the positive actions and
behaviors of others (i.e., a collective action problem). If individuals are overly confident in their
ability to predict the behavior of others [10], but those predictions are overly pessimistic and
cynical [7], then outcomes that rely on others doing the “right thing” may be seen as unlikely to
occur. That is, individuals who think more of themselves and expect less of their peers may be
particularly pessimistic about the likelihood of solving problems that require collective action.
To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to examine the function of self-enhancement
and self-other asymmetries in the context of a collective action problem.

The Covid-19 epidemic presents a critically important example of a collective action
problem. In order to successfully contain the virus, individuals have to collectively practice
novel behaviors like mask-wearing and social-distancing [11]. Some have posited that one of the
most powerful predictors of collective action success in Covid-19 is trust [12] -- both horizontal
trust in each other and vertical trust in our institutions [13]. The former -- the trust that we place
in others to do the right thing by the group -- is the focus of the research presented below.
Specifically, we hypothesize that individuals will report a biased self-other asymmetry as it
pertains to engaging in behavior that reduces the spread of Covid-19 relative to their peers.
Moreover, we predict that this lack of trust in peers will be related to increased covid-related
concern, and be associated with heightened anxiety during the pandemic period.

We examine two areas of predicted self-other asymmetry with regard to the Covid-19
pandemic: 1) that individuals will report being more knowledgeable about Covid-19 than their
peers, and 2) that individuals will report having made more Covid-19 behavioral changes relative
to their peers. Turning first to Covid-related knowledge, prior research on self-other asymmetries
has found that individuals tend to overestimate their knowledge in domains where absolute
knowledge is high and underestimate it in domains where absolute knowledge is low [14]. Given
the extreme amount of coverage that the pandemic had received in the media and across multiple
outlets at the time of data collection [15], we predicted that Covid-19 may be a domain where
absolute knowledge is relatively high, and that individuals would subsequently overestimate their
knowledge relative to their peers.

Second, Covid-19 related behaviors are perceived as highly morally relevant. Individuals
who are more prosocially inclined report wearing a mask more frequently, and perceive others
who wear masks as being more prosocial than those who do not [16]. In addition, messaging that
emphasizes the moral relevance of Covid-19 related behavior change (e.g., wearing a mask,
social distancing) is potentially more effective than non-moral messaging [17]. Taken together,
this suggests that the Covid-19 domain has perhaps become a moralized one. This would have
meaningful implications for self-other asymmetry predictions, as individuals tend to make highly
self-serving asymmetric predictions about actions that have moral implications [3]. Given the
potential moral implications of Covid-19 related behaviors, we predicted that individuals would
report restricting their behavior to a greater extent than their peers, and moreover, would be more
likely to endorse doing so for prosocial (i.e., to avoid transmitting the virus to others) compared
to self-focused (i.e., to avoid contracting the virus themselves) reasons.

We propose that the extent to which individuals think their peers are ill informed and are
doing less to protect others than they are will be associated with increased anxiety during the
lockdown period. Symptoms of anxiety and depression have been highly prevalent during the
Covid-19 pandemic [18, 19, 20, 21]. While there are many possible reasons for this increase,
including (but not limited to) increased media and news consumption [22], economic concerns
[23], and concern about individual and familial health [24]. We posit that another contributor
may be the lack of control we have over the behaviors of others, and the centrality of others in
determining Covid-19 related outcomes. We hypothesized that individuals who show a larger
self-other asymmetry in covid-related knowledge and prosocial behavior would report higher
levels of both covid-specific worry, general anxiety symptoms, and stress during the initial
lockdown period. Feeling a lack of personal agency or control is associated with increased
anxiety [25], and pessimism is associated with both health problems and negative mood [26].
Notably, prior research has found a negative relationship between the tendency to self-enhance
relative to one’s peers and anxiety [27]. However, we predict the opposite effect in the context of
Covid-19, given that surviving a global pandemic necessitates the reliance on others. If
individuals believe that their peers are doing less than they are to contain the spread of Covid-19,
then they may feel more worried about Covid-19, and more anxious during the lockdown period.
To examine this question directly, we test a mediation model wherein the size of self-peer
asymmetry in Covid-19 related restrictive behaviors mediates the relationship between Covid-19
specific worry and general anxiety reported during the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Results

The data presented here is part of the first wave of a longitudinal study collected at a
large northeastern university. The first wave of data collection was completed on 3/25/20-4/4/20,
approximately 2-3 weeks following the closure of the university on 03/11/2020, and consisted of
1852 participants (1170 Female, Mage = 24.03, SDage = 9.24, age range = 18 - 76). We only
included participants who filled out all of the measures of interest (covid-related behavioral
restriction and risk-assessment), leaving us with a final sample of 1023 participants (697
females, Mage = 23.61, SDage = 8.52, age range = 18 - 71). What is unique about this population is
that they are all members of the larger university community (e.g., undergraduates, graduate
students, faculty, staff, etc.). This is perhaps an ideal sample in which to study the nature and
accuracy of self-peer asymmetries given that we can compare individual estimates of the average
population with what the average population is actually reporting. For example, we can compare
what an individual undergraduate believes their peers are doing with what undergraduate
students are actually reporting in the sample. This allows us to examine whether individuals’
beliefs about where they stand relative to their peers are accurate.

Individuals are overconfident about Covid-19 knowledge relative to peers. Participants
estimated their knowledge of Covid-19 relative to their peers (on a scale from 0 = “Know much
less” to 6 = “Know much more”). We first hypothesized that individuals would report knowing
more than the average peer about Covid-19, but that this would not necessarily track with reality.
A one-sample t-test on perceived Covid-19 knowledge relative to one’s peers (i.e., perceived
Covid-19 knowledge asymmetry) found that the mean (M = 3.48, SD = 1.15) was significantly

different from the midpoint (3), t(1022) = 13.48, p < .001, indicating that our sample believed
that they knew more than their peers about Covid-19. A paired t-test indicated that participants
were more likely to endorse correct transmission knowledge about Covid-19 (M = 2.56, SD =
.59) as compared to incorrect symptom knowledge (M = .52, SD = .73), t(1022) = 54.31, p <
.001. However, perceived Covid-19 knowledge asymmetry did not predict being more
knowledgeable about Covid-19 symptoms: b = .054, se = .032, t(1020) = 1.67, p = .095, or
general Covid-19 knowledge: b = .015, se = .030, t(1020) = .49, p = .625, relative to one’s peers.
Taken together, this indicates that while individuals believed that they are more knowledgeable
about Covid-19 relative to their peers, this belief did not reflect actually knowing more about
Covid-19 symptoms or how the disease spreads.

Individuals are optimistic about their likelihood of infection relative to peers. Participants also
estimated their risk of becoming infected with Covid-19, their risk of transmitting Covid-19, and
their risk of dying if they were to become infected with Covid-19. They were then asked to make
the same assessments for their average peer. All risk estimates were between 0-100%. We
hypothesized that, consistent with other research on unrealistic optimism regarding health-related
risk [30], participants would indicate that their peers were at higher risk than they were for
getting infected with (i.e., self-focused) and transmitting Covid-19 (i.e., prosocial) to others. We
found a significant target (self, peer) by action-type (infection, transmission) interaction, F(1,
4088) = 12.18, p < .001. Post-hoc pairwise comparisons of this interaction indicated that in the
self condition, the perceived likelihood of getting infected was higher (M = 32.60, SD = 24.31)
than perceived likelihood of transmitting the virus to others (M = 36.89, SD = 30.94), t(1022) =
5.34, p < .001. This was smaller than the difference observed in the peer condition, wherein the

predicted likelihood of getting infected was higher (M = 42.09, SD = 25.52) than the perceived
likelihood of transmitting the virus to others (M = 52.83, SD = 36.06), t(1022) = 11.69, p < .001)
(Figure 1). We found no differences in estimated risk of death following COVID-19 infection
between self (M = 11.28, SD = 17.53) and peer (M = 11.41, SD = 15.95), t(1022) = .29, p = .77,
suggesting that our participants believed that they were as likely as peers to be negatively
impacted by Covid-19, were they to contract it.

Individuals believe that they are restricting their behavior more, and for more prosocial
reasons, relative to peers. Participants also indicated how much they had limited their social
interactions to reduce their likelihood of becoming infected, and how much they had limited their
social interactions to reduce their likelihood of transmitting Covid-19 to others. They were also
asked to indicate to what extent they felt that their average peer had done the same. All social
interaction limitation questions were answered on a scale from 0 = “Not at all” to 6 =
“Extremely”. To examine whether perceived social interaction limitation predicted actual
behavior change, we also asked participants to indicate which of a list of common social
behaviors (e.g., getting together with friends, going to the movies, going to class) they had
limited in the preceding two week period.

Turning first to beliefs about behavior change, we found a significant interaction between target
(self, other) and action type (infection, transmission) on perceived behavior change, F(1,4088) =
5.19, p = .023. Post-hoc pairwise comparisons of this interaction indicated that individuals were
more likely to report that they had limited their behaviors to avoid transmitting the virus to others
(M = 5.24, SD = 1.21), as compared to protecting themselves from infection (M = 5.14, SD =
1.18), t(1023) = 2.92, p = .004. In contrast, they reported the opposite for their peers, such that
they estimated that their peers were less motivated to limit their behaviors to avoid transmitting
Covid-19 to others (M = 3.40, SD = 1.42), as compared to protecting themselves from infection
(M = 3.48, SD =1.25), t(1023) = 3.07, p = .002 (Figure 2). Taken together, this indicates that
individuals believe that they limited their behavior in order to protect others, but that their peers
had done so to protect themselves.

reported that they had limited their behaviors to avoid transmitting the others more than they had

Are beliefs about behavioral restriction relative to peers accurate? To examine whether these
assessments tracked with reality, we computed 3 difference scores, outlined in the table below
(Table 1). Given that they were highly correlated (r = .76), we collapsed across transmission-

reflect a bias towards the self restricting more than peers (Table 1).

Individuals are inaccurate about magnitude, but right about direction. Due to the nature of our
sample, we can again test whether individuals’ beliefs about their average peer hit the mark.
Given that the process through which the reported self-peer discrepancy was calculated (see
Methods) was largely identical to the process of mean-centering, if individuals are wellcalibrated with regard to where they stand relative to their peers, the average predicted self-peer
discrepancy should also be around 0. That is, individuals who are restricting their behaviors less
than peers should report being lower than peers, and those who are restricting more should report
being higher than peers, and this would even out in an average group estimate of 0. If this
estimate were higher than 0, this would mean that, on average, individuals are overestimating
what they are doing relative to their peers. We found that predicted behavioral restriction (M =
1.75, SD = 1.54) was much larger than actual behavior restriction (M = .002, SD =1.06), t(1021)

= 44.53, p <.001. This indicates that individuals are significantly overestimating the extent to
which they are restricting their behaviors relative to their peers.
However, we found that predicted behavioral restriction and actual behavioral restriction
were significantly and positively correlated, 𝜌 = .55, 𝑝 < .001,such that individuals who thought
that they were restricting behavior more than their peers generally were. Taken together with the
t-test results, this suggests that individuals are inaccurate about the size of the asymmetry
between self and peer (as indexed by the large average discrepancy between actual and perceived
behavioral restrictions) but accurate about the direction of the asymmetry (as indexed by a
positive relationship between predicted and actual behavioral restriction asymmetries).

Relationship between perceived behavioral restriction and actual behavior change
To examine whether beliefs about the extent to which individuals restricted their behavior
relative to their peers related to actual differences in behavior change, we examined self-peer
differences in the number of activities (e.g., Going to restaurants, cafes, or bars; Getting together
with family) that participants had reported limiting over the past two weeks. We found that on
average, participants reported limiting 14.75 (SD = 3.58) behaviors (out of a possible 22, see
Methods for full list of behaviors). We found that predicted behavioral restriction relative to
one’s peers was positively correlated with the number of behaviors one reported limiting relative
to peer group averages, r = .28, t(1020) = 9.30, p < .001.

Relationship between self-peer asymmetries and mental health outcomes

Next, we examined the role that perceived self/other asymmetry may play in maladaptive
emotional responding. To do so, we quantified the relationship between asymmetry measures
(knowledge asymmetry, behavioral restriction asymmetry) and Covid-related worry and anxiety
more generally. To assess Covid-related worry, participants were asked a series of questions to
indicate how often they worried about Covid-19 (see methods for details). These questions had
good internal consistency, = .81, and were combined to create a composite variable of Covid-19
related worry.To assess mental health outcomes during the lockdown period, we also asked
participants to indicate their levels of Covid-related worry (“e.g., I worried about my health”),
anxiety (via the DSM-5 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure, DSM-5-CC; 28), stress (via the
perceived stress scale, PSS; 29).

Knowledge asymmetries and mental health outcomes. Turning first to covid-related
worry, we found that, on average, our participants were moderately worried about Covid-19, M =
3.53, SD = 1.23. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that individuals who felt that they
were more knowledgeable about Covid-19 were also those that reported a higher frequency of
covid-specific worry, b = .21, SE = .03, t(1021) = 6.53, p < .001. To examine whether this
asymmetry predicted Covid-19 worry specifically or stress and anxiety more generally, we also
examined the relationship between knowledge asymmetry and stress (as assessed by the PSS)
and reported anxiety (as assessed by the DSM-CC-5). We did not find a relationship between
knowledge asymmetry and experienced stress, b = -.07, se = .19, t(1021) = .37, p = .71. We did,
however, find a marginally significant relationship between covid knowledge and anxiety, b =
.06, se = .03, t(1021) = 1.90, p = .057.

Behavioral restriction asymmetries and mental health outcomes. We found that
Covid-related worry was significantly associated with the predicted self-peer difference in
behavioral restriction, b = .26, SE = .04, t(1021) = 6.90, p < .001. We also found a significant
relationship stress and predicted self-peer behavioral restriction, b = .04, SE = .01, t(1021) =
5.49, p < .001, and between anxiety and predicted self-peer behavioral restriction, b = .25, SE =
.04, t(1021) = 6.26, p < .001.
Taken together, this suggests that individuals who perceived greater differences in
behavioral restriction between themselves and their peers are also more worried about Covid-19,
and experiencing increased stress and anxiety. While we found a similar relationship between
perceived knowledge differences and covid-related worry, there was not as strong of a
relationship between knowledge asymmetry and anxiety/stress during the lockdown period.

Testing whether perceived self-peer asymmetry mediates the relationship between
Covid-specific worry and general anxiety. Next, we examined whether, as predicted, a larger
self-other asymmetry in perceived behavioral restrictions is linked to more negative mental
health outcomes during the Covid-19 lockdown period. We found evidence that the self-other
perceived behavioral restriction asymmetry mediated the relationship between covid-specific and
general anxiety. A 95% CI determined via non-parametric bootstrapping (5000 iterations)
indicated that the indirect effect through the self-other asymmetry score was significant, b = .02,
95% CI: [.01, .03], p < .001 (Figure 5). Specifically, this indicates that while Covid-related worry
was a strong predictor of general anxiety during the early lockdown period, this was due, in part,
to the extent to which individuals felt that they were doing more than peers to reduce the spread
of the virus.

Discussion
We found evidence for substantial self-peer asymmetries with regard to the Covid-19
pandemic. Individuals believe (inaccurately) that they know more about Covid-19 than their
peers, are less likely to contract and transmit the virus to others, are restricting their behaviors to
a greater extent than their peers, and that their actions are more prosocially motivated than their

peers’. Importantly, we found that this self-peer asymmetry, which has been associated with
positive psychological outcomes in earlier research [4, 27] is instead linked to negative mental
health outcomes during the Covid-19 period. Specifically, the extent to which people thought
they were restricting their behavior more than their peers (self-peer asymmetry) mediated the
relationship between Covid-specific concern and generalized anxiety during early stages of the
pandemic. Taken together, this suggests that while self-other asymmetries may be adaptive or
even beneficial in typical circumstances, they may be psychologically suboptimal in a situation
that requires relying on others for positive outcomes (i.e., collective action problems).

When are individuals accurate, and when are they not? We found evidence for both accuracy
and inaccuracy when estimating peer knowledge and behavior. Individuals reported that they
were more knowledgeable about Covid-19 relative to their peers -- a prediction that was not
borne out in reality. Given the extent of coverage that the Covid-19 epidemic received during the
data collection period, it is likely that individuals were often exposed to information about the
pandemic, and indeed, they were knowledgeable about the disease. However, they failed to
recognize that their peers were also likely inundated by Covid-19 related news and media, and
thus were likely also fairly knowledgeable. This effect is consistent with work suggesting that
individuals tend to overestimate their knowledge and competence in domains that are wellknown and easy [1, 14].

Correct about direction, incorrect about magnitude. With regard to behavioral restriction, we
found that individuals tended to overestimate the magnitude of the self-peer asymmetry, but were
correct about the direction of the asymmetry. We found that individuals believed that they were

restricting their behavior more than their peers to a greater extent than was actually the case.
However, individuals who were restricting their behavior more (or less) than peers were accurate
about their relative standing. Further, participants who believed that they were restricting
behavior more than their peers reported limiting more behaviors during the early stages of the
Covid-19 pandemic.
Taken together, this suggests that individuals are correctly identifying where they stand
relative to peers in terms of limiting behavior, but are perhaps too generous when it comes to
determining how far above their peers they actually are. To that end, it is worth noting that while
the relationship between perceived and actual behavior change relative to peers was highly
significant, it is modest in terms of the actual number of behaviors that individuals limited
relative to their peers. For example, for participants who indicated a high self-other asymmetry
(5 or above, n = 26) in behavioral restriction, had restricted, on average, only 1.23 more
behaviors than their average peer. This again potentially speaks to an accuracy in direction, but
perhaps not in magnitude.

Unrealistic optimism, moral superiority, and increased anxiety. Consistent with accounts of
unrealistic optimism for the self relative to peers [30, 31], we found that individuals predicted
that they were less likely than their peers to get infected with or transmit Covid-19 to others. In
addition, individuals were more likely to claim that they were restricting their behavior for more
prosocial reasons than were their peers. This is consistent with research indicating that
individuals tend to amplify the extent to which they are above-average in positive and moral
domains [4], and report being more morally motivated relative to their peers [3].

While believing one is less likely to fall ill and is a better person than one’s peers is
associated with maximizing happiness and self-esteem, we found that this belief pattern is
associated with more severe anxiety and stress in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. This
could be due to a number of factors. Feeling a lack of situational control is associated with
increased negative affect [32], and it is possible that participants who are more pessimistic about
their peers feel less situational control in the Covid-19 context. In addition, a great deal of
research has found that while self-enhancement may facilitate coping in traumatic and negative
situations [33], it is also associated with being less liked by others [33, 34, 35, 36]. It is possible
that individuals who were more likely to believe that they were doing better than their peers have
less social support or close interpersonal relationships, which may lead to increased anxiety
during a stressful time. Both situational control and perceived social support should be examined
in future research as potential causal factors.

Limitations. One major limitation of the research presented here is the relative ambiguity with
regard to both whom participants were thinking about when asked about an “average peer” and
the sources of information they were using to arrive at their self-serving predictions. To turn first
to the target of comparison, prior work has found that self-peer asymmetries are mitigated as
targets become more individuated [37], and it is likely that these results may not be as
pronounced when individuals instead compare themselves to an individuated peer rather than an
average peer. In addition, we cannot be completely certain that individuals were thinking of their
university-specific peers when making self-peer assessments, given that they were asked to think
about the “average peer”. It is possible that they were perhaps comparing themselves to their
hometown friends, Instagram followers, or the neighbors down the street. It is worth noting,

however, that this would only change the results with regard to self-peer accuracy, and not the
general conclusions with regard to mental health outcomes.
In terms of informational ambiguity, it is unclear what information motivated the selfenhancing assessments observed here. Many factors have been identified as underlying selfenhancement, including (and not limited to) failure to integrate base-rate information when
evaluating the self [3], a failure to receive or integrate objective feedback [31], not having the
skills or expertise to be able to recognize one’s own incompetence [38], and motivated
autobiographical recall [39]. For example, it is possible that when assessing peer behaviors they
tended to rely more on statistical information about things like reports of low mask compliance,
and when assessing their own behaviors they instead selectively recalled times they socially
distanced or the party invitation that they turned down. It is necessary, of course, to also
acknowledge the rational or veridical factors that may give rise to this bias — individuals have
more information about the extent to which they have limited or changed behavior following the
Covid-19 epidemic as compared to the information they have about their peers. Future research
should examine what specific information individuals are using to arrive at biased assessments of
themselves and their peers.

Self-other asymmetries and collective action problems. To our knowledge, this is one of the
first studies to examine the function of self-enhancement and self-other asymmetries in the
context of a collective action problem. We find that individuals who believe that they are doing
more than their peers have worse psychological outcomes in contexts where they must rely on
their peers to do the right or prosocial thing for their own health. Future research should
examine the long-term effects of self-enhancement related anxiety -- does it function as a

motivator for prosocial action, or does it increase the likelihood of burnout? Given that human
society will face no shortage of collective action problems in the foreseeable future (the Covid19 pandemic, racial injustice, climate change, mass extinctions, increased natural disasters)
understanding how the psychological processes that we study in the lab promote, prevent, and
preclude collective action has perhaps never been so important.

Methods
Undergraduate participants were compensated through course credit based on department-level
acceptance of credits (i.e., psychology students could earn credit through taking the study
through SONA). All participants, including those who earned course credit, were entered into a
raffle at each wave of the study. For the baseline wave of the study, four participants respectively
won $100 Amazon e-gift cards. Participants were recruited via university listservs, and their
participation entered them in a lottery to win a $100 Amazon gift card.

The total sample consisted of 1386 undergraduate students (74.84%), 166 graduate students (68
Masters students, 98 PhD students; 8.96%), 142 staff members (7.67%), 80 faculty members (43
Non-Tenure Track, 16 Tenure-Track; 4.32%), 26 individuals who identified as “Other” (1.4%),
and 52 (2.81%) who did not indicate the nature of their affiliation with the university.

Measures
We collected a number of measures on this sample, but for the purposes of this manuscript, only
focused on the variables listed above. These analyses were preregistered on AsPredicted.org:

Covid-19 Knowledge Measures

Accuracy of Covid-19 symptoms and general knowledge were evaluated based on the
information that was known at the time -- March/April 2020. We acknowledge that
knowledge about common symptomology for Covid-19 has changed as medical
researchers learn more about the disease (Burke et al., 2020).

Perceived self-peer Covid-19 knowledge asymmetry. To assess perceived relative
knowledge regarding Covid-19, participants were asked to indicate “how knowledgeable
they were about covid-19 compared to their peers” on a scale from 0 = “Know much
less” to 6 = “Know much more”.

Covid-19 symptom knowledge. To assess actual knowledge relative to one’s peers, we
asked participants to indicate the three most common symptoms of Covid-19 from the
following list (the correct answers have been bolded): fatigue, nausea, shortness of
breath, sneezing, diarrhea, constipation, cough, runny nose, fever, body aches, and
ulcers in the mouth. For each participant, we summed the number of symptoms that they
correctly identified, and the number of symptoms that they incorrectly identified, and
created a difference score by subtracting the incorrect number from the correct number,
such that higher numbers indicate greater knowledge of Covid-19 symptomatology.

General Covid-19 knowledge. To further assess covid-related knowledge, participants
were asked to read each of the following statements, and to indicate the extent to which
they believed these statements about Covid-19 (correct statements have been bolded): 1)
“Someone can transmit it, even if they do not show symptoms”, 2) “Your dog or cat
can transmit it to you”, 3) “Standard surgical masks prevent you from becoming
infected”, 4) “It mutated from the common cold”, 5) “It was probably made in the lab”,
6) “It is less deadly than the annual flu”, 7) “You can become infected from eating at a
Chinese restaurant”, 8) “Vitamin C supplements will help keep you from being infected”.
All statements were evaluated on a scale from 0 = “Proven False” to 6 = “Proven True”.
For each participant, we calculated their average response for the correct items and their
average response for the incorrect items, and created a difference score by subtracting
their incorrect average from their correct average, such that higher numbers indicate
greater knowledge of Covid-19.

Assessing self-peer knowledge asymmetries. To examine whether an assessment of
being more or less knowledgeable about Covid-19 reflected reality, we calculated the
average Covid-19 symptom knowledge and average Covid-19 transmission knowledge
for each peer group in the sample (i.e., undergraduates, graduate students, faculty, etc.).
We then compared the individual participant’s averages to their peer group averages. To
do so, we subtracted the peer average from each participant’s knowledge score, such that
higher numbers indicate actually being more knowledgeable about Covid-19 relative to
one’s peers. We then ran a Spearman’s with perceived knowledge asymmetry predicting
actual knowledge.

Risk Assessment Measures

Covid self-peer risk assessment. Participants were asked to estimate their risk of
becoming infected with Covid-19, their risk of transmitting Covid-19, and their risk of
dying if they were to become infected with Covid-19. They were then asked to make the
same assessments for their average peer. All risk estimates were between 0-100%. To
examine the relationship between self-focused (infection risk) vs. social-focused
(transmission risk) COVID-risk assessment, we ran a repeated-measures 2 (target: self,
other) x 2 (action-type: infection, transmission) ANOVA using the “rstatix” package
(Kassambara, 2020) in R.

Behavioral Restriction Measures.

Self- reported behavioral restriction. Participants were asked to indicate how much
they had limited their social interactions to reduce their likelihood of becoming infected
(self-focused) and how much they had limited their social interactions to reduce their
likelihood of exposing others to Covid-19 (prosocial-focused).
Self-estimated peer restriction. They were also asked to indicate to what extent they felt
that their average peer had done the same. All questions were answered on a scale from 0
= “Not at all” to 6 = “Extremely”.

Specific behavior change. To assess specific behavior change, we asked participants to
indicate whether they had limited the following behaviors in the previous two weeks: 1)
Going to restaurants, cafes, or bars, 2) Attending events with audiences or spectators
(e.g., sporting events, movies, theater, concerts, conferences, festivals, parades, etc.), 3)
Getting together with friends, 4) Getting together with family, 5) Attending parties, 6)
Attending religious services, 7) Going near/talking to strangers, 8) Using public
transportation, 9) Using ride services (e.g., taxis, Uber, Lyft), 10) Travel via train, plane,
or bus, 11) Travel via your own car, 12) Exercise, 13) Non-academic classes, 14) Visiting
libraries or museums, 15) Shopping for food, 16) Shopping at non-grocery stores, 17)
Touching things in public, 18) Using public bathrooms, 19) Walking your dog, 20)
Ordering food for delivery, 21) Personal health care (e.g., dentist, annual physical,
visiting medical professionals for non-coronavirus conditions). We created a count
variable for the number of behaviors that the participants had reported limiting.

Emotion measures

Covid-related worry. Participants were asked to indicate how often they worried about
Covid-19 during the past two weeks via the following questions (all on a scale from 0 =
“Not at all” to 6 = “Extremely frequently”): “I worried about my health”, “I worried
about Covid-19”, “I worried about all the things I could do about Covid-19”, “News
about all health-related topics made me worry about Covid-19”, “Changing my routine
made me worry about Covid-19”, “I talked with my friends about Covid-19”, and “I felt
like I had control over whether or not I would become infected with Covid-19 (reverse-

scored).” These questions had good internal consistency, = .81, and were combined to
create a composite variable of Covid-19 related worry.

Anxiety and stress. Symptoms of anxiety were assessed using the anxiety subscale of the
DSM-5 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure (DSM-5-CC; APA, 2013). Higher numbers
reflect more severe anxiety over the past two week period. Stress was assessed using the
Perceived Stress Scale (PSS; Cohen, Kamarck, & Mermelstein, 1983). Participants
indicated how often they had experienced stress over the past two weeks, with higher
numbers on the scale reflecting more stress.

Quantifying self-peer asymmetries

Relationship between predicted behavioral restriction and actual behavioral restriction
The actual behavior restriction variable was highly skewed (skewness = - 1.27), so to examine
whether a predicted asymmetry in predicted behavioral restriction was associated with an actual
asymmetry in the amount of behavioral restriction reported by peers, we calculated Spearman’s
rank correlation between predicted behavioral restriction and actual behavioral restriction.

Relationship between perceived behavioral restriction and specific behavior change
To examine whether perceived differences in behavioral restrictions relative to one’s peers
translates to specific behavior change, we ran a linear regression with predicted behavioral
restriction as the predictor variable, and specific behavior change as the outcome variable.

Relationship between self-peer asymmetries and mental health outcomes
To examine the role that a perceived self/other asymmetry may play in maladaptive emotional
responding we conducted the following analyses.

Knowledge asymmetries and mental health outcomes. We examined the relationship
between our asymmetry measures (knowledge asymmetry, behavioral restriction
asymmetry) and both Covid-related worry and general anxiety. We first ran a simple
linear regression with covid-related knowledge asymmetry predicting covid-related
worry. A positive relationship would indicate that individuals who believe that they know
more about Covid-19 relative to their peers are also more worried about Covid-19. To
examine whether knowledge asymmetry predicts Covid-19 worry specifically or stress
and anxiety more generally, we also ran two linear regressions with covid-related
knowledge asymmetry predicting stress (as assessed by the PSS) and anxiety (as assessed
by the DSM-CC-5).

Behavioral restriction asymmetries and mental health outcomes. To examine whether
believing one is restricting behavior more than peers is related to negative mental health
outcomes, we ran two simple linear regressions with the predicted behavioral restriction
as a fixed factor predicting Covid-specific worry. To examine whether asymmetries in
perceived behavioral restriction predicts Covid-specific worry specifically or anxiety
more generally, we also ran a linear regression with predicted behavioral restriction
predicting perceived stress and anxiety over the past two weeks.

Testing whether perceived self-peer asymmetry mediates the relationship between
Covid-specific worry and general anxiety. Next, to examine whether a larger self-other
asymmetry is linked to more negative mental health outcomes during the Covid-19
lockdown period, we tested whether the degree of predicted self-other behavioral
restriction mediated the relationship between Covid-specific worry and general anxiety
during the lockdown period. We used the averaged behavioral restriction asymmetry
score (i.e., the average of the predicted self-other self- and prosocial-focused behavioral
restriction estimates). Using the “mediation” package in R (Tingley et al., 2014) we ran a
mediation analysis, testing whether the size of the predicted self-other asymmetry
mediated the relationship between Covid-specific worry and reported general anxiety.
