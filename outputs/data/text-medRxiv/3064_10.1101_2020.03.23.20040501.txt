Abstract: Environmental factors are well known to affect spatio-temporal patterns of infectious

2

disease outbreaks, but whether the recent rapid spread of COVID-19 across the globe is related

3

to local environmental conditions is highly debated. We assessed the impact of environmental

4

factors (temperature, humidity and air pollution) on the global patterns of COVID-19 early

5

outbreak dynamics during January-May 2020, controlling for several key socio-economic factors

6

and airport connections. We showed that during the earliest phase of the global outbreak

7

(January-March), COVID-19 growth rates were non-linearly related to climate, with fastest

8

spread in regions with a mean temperature of ca. 5°C, and in the most polluted regions.

9

However, environmental effects faded almost completely when considering later outbreaks, in

10

keeping with the progressive enforcement of containment actions. Accordingly, COVID-19

11

growth rates consistently decreased with stringent containment actions during both early and late

12

outbreaks. Our findings indicate that environmental drivers may have played a role in explaining

13

the early variation among regions in disease spread. With limited policy interventions, seasonal

14

patterns of disease spread might emerge, with temperate regions of both hemispheres being most

15

at risk of severe outbreaks during colder months. Nevertheless, containment measures play a

16

much stronger role and overwhelm impacts of environmental variation, highlighting the key role

17

for policy interventions in curbing COVID-19 diffusion within a given region. If the disease will

18

become seasonal in the next years, information on environmental drivers of COVID-19 can be

19

integrated with epidemiological models to inform forecasting of future outbreak risks and

20

improve management plans.

1. Introduction

26
27

Host-pathogen interaction dynamics can be significantly affected by environmental conditions,

28

either directly, via e.g. improved pathogen transmission rates, or indirectly, by affecting host

29

susceptibility to pathogen attacks (Altizer et al., 2013). In the case of directly transmitted

30

diseases, such as human influenza and other viral diseases, multiple environmental parameters

31

including local temperatures and humidity impact on virus viability and transmission, with

32

significant consequences for the seasonal and geographic patterns of outbreaks (Shaman and

33

Kohn, 2009; Fuhrmann, 2010; Shaman et al., 2010; Lowen and Steel, 2014; Kampf et al., 2020).

34

The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is the aethiological agent of COVID-19, a pandemic zoonosis

35

causing severe pneumonia outbreaks at a global scale (World Health Organization, 2020).

36

During the initial months of 2020, this disease rapidly spread worldwide (Dong et al., 2020),

37

though the early dynamics of COVID-19 outbreaks appeared highly variable. Some countries

38

were experiencing slow growth and spread of COVID-19 cases, while others were suffering

39

widespread community transmission and fast, nearly exponential growth of infections (Dong et

40

al., 2020). Understanding the environmental drivers of early growth rates is pivotal to forecast

41

the potential severity of disease outbreaks and their interactions with containment measures

42

(Britton and Tomba, 2019; Baker et al., 2020; Jung et al., 2020). Given the importance of

43

environmental conditions on the transmission of many pathogens, we tested the hypothesis that

44

the severity of COVID-19 outbreaks across the globe was affected by spatial variation of key

45

environmental factors, and investigated the relative role of environmental conditions and of

46

containment measures adopted by governments on disease spread patterns.

47

A growing number of studies has been assessing the relationships between COVID-19

48

growth rate and multiple environmental features, such as temperature, humidity (e.g. Tamerius et

49

al., 2013; Islam et al., 2020a; Kampf et al., 2020; Runkle et al., 2020; Sajadi et al., 2020; Sobral

50

et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020c), and air pollution (e.g. Bianconi et al., 2020; Rahman et al., 2020;

51

Wu et al., 2020b; Yao et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020), while accounting for major socio-

52

economic features of the affected regions (Coelho et al., 2020; Jaffe et al., 2020; Shammi et al.,

53

2020). However, results of these studies were sometimes controversial, casting doubts on the

54

possibility of correctly identifying environmental signals on COVID-19 spread dynamics

55

(Carlson et al., 2020a; Carlson et al., 2020b). Differences among studies can be caused by

56

multiple factors, including lack of standardized methodological framework, differences in spatial

57

extent and scale, and by complex interactions between human transmission, environmental

58

features and containment measures (Baker et al., 2020; Carlson et al., 2020b). Furthermore, both

59

environmental features and containment measures can show complex temporal trends in the

60

course of an outbreak. Studies assessing whether relationships between environment and

61

COVID-19 change are consistent across regions and time periods are pivotal to identify robust

62

and generalizable patterns.

63

We calculated the mean daily growth rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases during the

64

exponential phase of the epidemic growth curve for the 586 countries/regions (hereafter, regions)

65

(Supplement 1, Fig. S1) where at least 25 cases were reported before June, 2020. Variation at

66

these early epidemic growth rates represents the local progression of the disease and should best

67

reflect the impact of local environmental conditions on disease spread. However, environmental

68

effects on local disease spread could be blurred by containment actions, as in most regions local

69

authorities adopted unprecedented containment measures well in advance or immediately after

70

the detection of an outbreak to mitigate pathogen spread and community transmission (Hellewell

71

et al., 2020; Maier and Brockmann, 2020; Manenti et al., 2020; Thu et al., 2020).

72

In this study, we first assessed whether COVID-19 growth rate in different regions of the

73

world was affected by major environmental features (temperature, humidity, fine particulate

74

matter; see Methods), controlling for major socio-economic features of the affected regions.

75

Second, we tested whether the stringency of containment measures limited COVID-19 growth

76

rate at the onset of local outbreaks (Maier and Brockmann, 2020). Among the socio-economic

77

factors potentially affecting SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics during early outbreaks, we

78

considered human population size, population density, per capita government health expenditure

79

(hereafter, health expenditure) and age structure (see Methods). The importance of a given

80

region in the global air transportation network was expressed as its eigenvector centrality

81

(Coelho et al., 2020) (hereafter, region centrality; see Methods) while containment measures

82

were synthesized into a stringency index (Hale et al., 2020). Finally, to evaluate whether

83

relationships between environment and COVID-19 change were consistent across regions and

84

time periods, we considered regions experiencing outbreaks from January-March 2020 (when

85

outbreaks mostly started before the implementation of strict containment measures) to late May

86

2020, when lockdown-type containment actions were often adopted even before local outbreaks

87

started. We predicted that late outbreaks, starting under strict containment measures, should be

88

less severe than those starting under no or limited containment, and that environmental effects on

89

COVID-19 growth rate would fade through time, in pace with a progressive increase of the effect

90

of containment actions.

94

2.1 COVID-19 dataset

95

We downloaded time series of confirmed COVID-19 cases (cumulative growth curves) from the

96

Johns Hopkins University Center For Systems Science and Engineering (JHU-CSSE) GitHub

97

repository (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/) (Dong et al., 2020). JHU-CSSE

98

reports, for each day since January 22, 2020, confirmed COVID-19 cases at the country level or

99

at the level of significant geographical units belonging to the same country, which we broadly

100

defined here as ‘regions’ (e.g. US states, or China and Canada provinces; Supplement 1,

101

Supplementary methods). Data referring to outbreaks occurring on cruise ships were not

102

considered. The cumulative growth curves were carefully checked and obvious reporting errors

103

(a few occurrences of temporary decreases in the cumulative number of cases) were corrected.

104

Our dataset included confirmed COVID-19 cases up to June 15, 2020. From this dataset, we

105

selected data for all those regions in which local outbreaks were detected up to May 31, 2020

106

(see Local outbreaks and COVID-19 cases growth rates).

107

Overall, we considered data from 159 countries. We considered sub-national level data

108

for the all the countries of the world for which data were easily accessible from the original

109

sources listed in the JHU-CSSE website (for a total of 17 countries; Table S6). Our final dataset

110

included information on 586 regions (Supplement 1, Fig. S2 and Supplementary methods).

111
112

2.2 Local outbreaks and COVID-19 cases growth rates

113

To avoid the biases arising because of incomplete spread of the pathogen, our dataset included

114

only those regions experiencing a local COVID-19 outbreak. Therefore, our results are

115

unaffected by patterns occurring in regions where the pathogen showed a limited number of

6

116

records (e.g. because of distributional disequilibrium, limited connections with other affected

117

areas, or lack of reporting).

118

The onset of a local COVID-19 outbreak event was defined as the day when at least 25

119

confirmed cases were reported in a given region. Visual inspection of growth curves showed

120

that, in most cases, below this threshold the reporting of cases was irregular, or growth was

121

extremely slow for prolonged periods. This approach also allowed us to exclude the first cases,

122

often referring to individuals returning from foreign countries and not reflecting local

123

transmission of the pathogen. We then calculated the daily growth rate r of confirmed COVID-

124

19 cases for each region after reaching the 25 confirmed cases threshold following the approach

125

proposed by Hall et al. (2014). The method iteratively fits growth curves on successive intervals

126

of a minimum of 5 data points to identify the exponential phase of a cumulative growth curve,

127

and returns the lag phase, and the onset and end of the exponential growth phase. The lag phase,

128

characterized by very slow growth, is followed by the exponential phase (Supplement 1, Fig.

129

S1). Typically, cumulative growth curves of COVID-19 cases begin with exponential growth in

130

the early phases, which begins to decelerate within ca. 10 days of its beginning (e.g. Supplement

131

1, Fig. S3; see also Maier and Brockmann, 2020). This pattern is similar to what has been

132

documented for earlier phases of other major infectious disease outbreaks (Viboud et al., 2016).

133

We thus restricted the analyses to those regions for which at least 15 days of data after the

134

outbreak onset were available up to June 15, 2020.

135

Approaches assuming distributional equilibrium can be inappropriate to model the spread

136

of recently emerged infectious diseases (Carlson et al., 2020a). To avoid this issue, we used a

137

dynamic approach, whereby we modelled the dynamics of disease spread within populations

138

(Hall et al., 2014; Carlson et al., 2020a; Coelho et al., 2020). To this end, we computed the mean

139

daily growth rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases during the exponential phase as r = [ln(n

140

casesday end exp. phase) - ln(n casesday start exp. phase)] / (day end exp. phase – day end exp. phase). We

141

also computed the maximum daily growth rate rmax during the exponential phase according to

142

Hall et al. (2014). Lag and exponential phase duration, and rmax were computed through the R

143

package growthrates (Hall et al., 2014). Mean and maximum daily growth rates were strongly

144

positively correlated (Pearson’s correlation coefficient, r = 0.95, n = 586 regions), indicating that

145

our growth rate estimates for a given region were highly consistent irrespective of the method

146

used for calculations. By modelling the exponential phase, this approach allowed to focus on

147

local transmission events occurring within the focal region. The average time interval between

148

the first case and the onset of the exponential phase was 19.5 days (SD = 11.1 days), thus cases

149

representing individuals returning from foreign countries likely have a negligible impact on our

150

growth rate estimates.

151
152

2.3 Environmental variables

153

We considered two climatic variables that are known to affect the spread of viral diseases: mean

154

air temperature and specific humidity (water vapor pressure), which is a measure of absolute

155

humidity. Previous studies showed that, for coronaviruses and influenza viruses, survival is

156

generally higher at low temperature and low values of absolute humidity (Lowen et al., 2007;

157

Shaman and Kohn, 2009; Tamerius et al., 2013; Lowen and Steel, 2014; Kampf et al., 2020; Yap

158

et al., 2020). For each region, we obtained the mean daily values for temperature (°C) and

159

specific humidity (g/m3) from the ERA5 hourly database (Supplement 1, Supplementary

160

methods).

161

The latency period of the infection, and the lag time between the onset of symptoms,

162

PCR tests and publication of confirmed cases can be highly variable across patients and across

163

areas of the world. For instance, Li et al. (2020a) suggested a mean incubation period of 4-7

164

days, but also reported cases with shorter incubation, or with incubation > 14 days. Therefore,

165

we measured the potential impact of temperature and humidity in two alternative time windows.

166

First, we considered a broad time period (30 days) occurring before the end of exponential phase.

167

For this 30-days time period, we computed mean climatic conditions (temperature and humidity

168

during 30 days; including the day of the end of the exponential phase and the preceding 29 days;

169

hereafter: 30-days period) (Supplement 1, Fig. S1). This 30-days period aims at covering all the

170

climatic conditions encountered by the broadest range of confirmed cases. Second, we used a

171

narrower time period, focusing on the most frequent time lags between infection and reporting.

172

Following Jüni et al. (2020), we computed mean climatic values assuming an exposure period for

173

infections starting 14 days before the onset of the follow-up period (in our case the start of the

174

exponential phase) and ending 14 days before the end of the follow-up period (in our case the

175

end of the exponential phase) (hereafter: Δ14 days period) (Supplement 1, Fig. S1).

176

Besides climate, it has been proposed that other environmental parameters may affect

177

variation of COVID-19 outbreak severity. Air pollution, especially fine atmospheric particulate,

178

may enhance the environmental persistence, transmission and effects of coronaviruses (Bianconi

179

et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). We thus calculated the mean annual concentration of PM2.5 for

180

each region (Supplement 1, Supplementary methods).

181
182

2.4 Socio-economic variables and airport connections

9

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.23.20040501; this version posted December 8, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

183

Among socio-economic predictors, we considered mean human population density (Center for

184

International Earth Science Information Network, 2018) (hereafter, population density, expressed

185

in inhabitants/km2), total population size (Center for International Earth Science Information

186

Network, 2018), per capita government health expenditure (in US$; average of 2015-2017

187

values) (Supplement 1, Supplementary methods). Elderly people are more susceptible to develop

188

severe COVID-19 symptoms (Wu et al., 2020a). We thus obtained for each country an estimate

189

of the proportion of the population aged 65 or older (population 65+).

190

Human mobility is well known to affect pathogen circulation and spatial dynamics

191

(Pybus et al., 2015), and such an effect has been highlighted also for early SARS-Cov-2 spread

192

(Gatto et al., 2020; Kraemer et al., 2020). We thus considered the potential relationships between

193

global airport connections and COVID-19 growth rate. Highly connected regions may

194

experience a higher 'propagule pressure' that increase disease diffusion among hosts, ultimately

195

influencing disease growth rates (Coelho et al., 2020). To investigate whether airport

196

connections affected early COVID-19 growth rates, we computed the eigenvector centrality

197

score for each region (region centrality). Highly connected regions have a higher region

198

centrality score (Bonacich, 1987) (Supplement 1, Supplementary methods).

199
200

2.5 Stringency of containment measures

201

For each region, we obtained an index of the overall stringency of COVID-19 containment

202

measures adopted by local authorities in the corresponding country at the onset of a local

203

outbreak (hereafter, stringency index). The stringency index was obtained by combining

204

information for each country from two separate data sources (Supplement 1, Supplementary

205

methods). This index simply record the number and strictness of government response measures,

10

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.23.20040501; this version posted December 8, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

206

hence a higher stringency score does not necessarily imply that a country's response is more

207

effective than that of other countries with lower scores (Hale et al., 2020). Nevertheless, the

208

stringency index may be helpful to illustrate the timeline of interventions and to assess whether

209

local governments’ policy responses at outbreak onset had any impact on COVID-19 spread

210

within a given region.

211
212

2.6 Statistical analyses

213

We relied on linear mixed models (LMMs) to relate variation of COVID-19 growth rate across

214

regions to environmental and socio-economic/management predictors (temperature, humidity,

215

PM2.5, population density, population size, health expenditure, population 65+, region

216

centrality, stringency index). LMMs are an extension of linear models that allow to take into

217

account non-independence of data (Zuur et al., 2009). In our study case, multiple regions within

218

a given country were considered as non-independent as they share multiple features (e.g. health

219

policy, monitoring protocols, economic features other than those considered in the analyses).

220

Country identity was thus included as a random factor to account for non-independence of

221

growth rates from regions belonging to the same country. Non-linear relationships between

222

climatic factors and ecological variables are frequent (Legendre and Legendre, 2012), and have

223

also been suggested for relationships between SARS-CoV-2 occurrence and climate (e.g. Runkle

224

et al., 2020). As in exploratory plots we detected a clear non-linear relationship between r-values

225

and climate variables, we included in models both linear and quadratic terms. Humidity, PM2.5,

226

population density, population size, health expenditure and region centrality were log10-

227

transformed to reduce skewness and improve normality of residuals. Regression models can be

228

heavily affected by strong collinearity among predictors (|r| ~0.70 or above) (Dormann et al.,

11

229

2013). In our dataset, temperature and humidity showed a very strong positive correlation

230

(Supplement 1, Fig. S7 and Table S1). We thus fitted separate models for temperature and

231

humidity, and for different combinations of strongly correlated socio-economic predictors

232

(Supplement 1, Supplementary methods and Table S2).

233

To assess temporal variation in the importance of different predictors on COVID-19

234

growth rates, we fitted LMMs considering regions experiencing outbreaks in different periods.

235

Each LMM included data from regions experiencing outbreaks up to a given day. We started

236

from regions experiencing local outbreaks up to February 27, the first day when local outbreaks

237

occurred in at least 50 regions (n = 51 regions), and proceeded on a day-by-day basis until we

238

included all regions experiencing outbreaks up to May 31, 2020 (n = 586 regions; see the

239

cumulative curve in Supplement 1, Fig. S4). The partial R2 statistic (variance explained by each

240

fixed effect, or semi-partial R2) was taken as a measure of the importance of each fixed effect in

241

each of these models. Furthermore, we assessed temporal variation of standardized regression

242

coefficients for models fitted at different time points. Airport connections are expected to affect

243

the first phases of the epidemic events, and we therefore tested the effect of region centrality in a

244

model including data up to March 15, 2020 (Supplement 1, Supplementary results). To confirm

245

the time lag period used for the calculation of temperature and humidity (30-days period vs. Δ14

246

days period) did not affect our results, we repeated analyses twice, first using the 30-days period

247

data, and then using the Δ14 days period data. Climate variables calculated using the 30-days and

248

the Δ14 days periods showed almost perfect correlation across regions (temperature, r = 0.99;

249

humidity, r = 0.99; n = 586 regions).

250
251

LMMs were fitted using the lmer function of the lme4 R package, while tests statistics
were calculated using the lmerTest package. Partial R2 was computed using the r2glmm R

package. Finally, we used a generalized additive model (GAMs, fitted with the R mgcv package)

253

to evaluate the temporal trend of the stringency index at the outbreak date across regions

254

experiencing outbreaks in different periods. For this analysis we used GAMs as we expected a

255

complex temporal pattern and we did not have a priori expectations on the shape of relationship

256

between stringency index and time.

3. Results

259
260

COVID-19 growth rates showed high variability at the global scale (Supplement 1, Fig. S2). The

261

observed daily growth rate during the exponential phase was on average 0.22 (SD = 0.11, N =

262

586 regions), and ranged from < 0.01 (Argentina, Santiago del Estero and Canada, Prince

263

Edward Island) to 0.72 (Denmark). The exponential growth phase lasted on average 9.0 d (SD =

264

5.7) and was generally followed by a deceleration of growth, likely as a progressive effect of

265

containment actions and/or increasing awareness by local communities (Supplement 1, Fig. S3)

266

(Maier and Brockmann, 2020). The highest growth rates were observed in temperate regions of

267

the Northern Hemisphere, although relatively fast growth also occurred in some tropical

268

countries, notably Brazil, Indonesia and the Philippines (Supplement 1, Fig. S2). COVID-19

269

growth rates tended to decrease markedly from March to May (Fig. 1a). At the same time, the

270

stringency of containment measures strongly increased: since the end of March, most outbreaks

271

occurred in regions already under strict containment regimes (Fig. 1b).

272

Mixed models including environmental and socio-economic variables explained well

273

variation of COVID-19 growth rate across regions (Supplement 1, Fig. S4). Due to collinearity

274

among predictors (Supplement 1, Table S1), we explored different model formulations

13

275

(Supplement 1, Table S2 and Fig. S4). The model including temperature (either 30-days period

276

or Δ14 days period), its squared term and PM2.5 as environmental variables, and population

277

density, population size and health expenditure as socio-economic predictors showed the best fit

278

during the early outbreaks, and had similar explanatory power to alternative model formulations

279

when we considered later periods (Supplement 1, Fig. S4). We therefore rely on this model as

280

the main basis for subsequent inference.

281

Temperature was the strongest environmental predictor during early outbreaks,

282

explaining as much as 20% of the variance in COVID-19 growth rates (Fig. 2). Its effect began

283

to fade when we also included the outbreaks occurring in late March and became negligible from

284

mid-April onward (Fig. 2). PM2.5 exhibited a similar pattern, but its effect size was weaker

285

compared to temperature (Fig. 2). Higher PM2.5 levels were associated with fast growth rates

286

when considering early outbreaks only (Fig. 3). Population size and health expenditure were the

287

strongest socio-economic predictors of growth rates (Fig. 2), the highest growth rates being

288

consistently associated with larger population size and greater health expenditure during both

289

early and late outbreaks (Fig. 3). The stringency of containment measures at outbreak onset

290

consistently negatively predicted COVID-19 growth rates (Fig. 3), becoming the predictor with

291

the strongest effect on growth rates from mid-April onwards (Fig. 2). Results obtained using

292

either the 30-days or the Δ14 days period were nearly identical (Table S3a-b), even though the

293

model using the 30-days period showed slightly higher fit, and temperature effects during early

294

outbreaks were somewhat stronger when considering the 30-days period compared to the Δ14

295

days period (Fig. 2).

296
297

To illustrate the relationships between COVID-19 growth rate and environmental
variables, socio-economic variables, or stringency index, we produced partial regression plots

from models fitted on data up to three time points (March 15, to April 15 and May 15; Fig. 4,

299

Supplement 1, Fig. S5; see Supplement 1, Table S3a for model details). For outbreaks occurring

300

up to March 15, growth rates peaked in regions with mean temperature of ca. 5° C, decreasing in

301

both warmer and colder climates (Fig. 4a). Furthermore, highly polluted regions experienced a

302

faster disease spread (Fig. 4d). The effects of temperature and air pollution faded completely

303

when including later outbreaks (Fig. 4c-4f). Higher stringency of containment measures

304

consistently reduced growth rates at all three time points (Fig. 4g-i). Considering the effect of

305

airport connections during early outbreaks or considering alternative environmental and socio-

306

economic variables (absolute humidity, age structure) did not qualitatively alter these

307

conclusions (Supplement 1, Supplementary results and Tables S4-S5).

308

4. Discussion

310
311

The role of environmental drivers on COVID-19 spatial patterns and growth rate is controversial

312

(Araújo et al., 2020; Carlson et al., 2020a; Carlson et al., 2020b; National Academies of Sciences

313

Engineering and Medicine, 2020). Some authors suggested that this disease had a reduced impact

314

and spread in warm climates, and in areas with low pollution and experiencing intense UV

315

radiation (Merow and Urban, 2020; Rahman et al., 2020; Runkle et al., 2020; Sajadi et al., 2020;

316

Sobral et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020b; Wu et al., 2020c; Zhang et al., 2020), while others reported

317

that socio-economic factors and airport connections have a much stronger impact than

318

environmental drivers (Coelho et al., 2020; Jaffe et al., 2020).

319
320

Our results considering the earliest COVID-19 data only (up to March, 2020) are in line
with initial evidence reporting less COVID-19 daily new cases and mortality in warm climates

321

(Wu et al., 2020c; Zhang et al., 2020), but exploring a broader time window explained the

322

inconsistency of results across studies. Many previous studies did not explicitly model non-linear

323

effects of climate, and were mostly restricted to the early phase of the global outbreak (Jüni et

324

al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020c). We instead included outbreaks occurring up to the end of May,

325

when COVID-19 reached an almost global spread (Supplement 1, Fig. S2), and adopted an

326

objective approach to identify the exponential phase of outbreaks (Hall et al., 2014). This

327

allowed focusing on early phases of the outbreaks (Maier and Brockmann, 2020), and

328

maximized the possibility of identifying environmental drivers before policy interventions

329

became effective (Merow and Urban, 2020). Finally, we explicitly modeled the spread dynamics

330

within regions (Carlson et al., 2020a; Coelho et al., 2020), thus avoiding the limitations of

331

approaches assuming distributional equilibrium between the pathogen and the environment

332

(Chipperfield et al., 2020).

333

Multiple non-exclusive processes could explain temperature effects on COVID-19 early

334

growth rate (Araújo et al., 2020; Sajadi et al., 2020). First, the persistence of SARS-Cov-2 and

335

other coronaviruses outside the hosts decreases at high temperature, medium-high humidity, and

336

under sunlight (Lowen et al., 2007; Chin et al., 2020; Kampf et al., 2020; Yap et al., 2020).

337

Second, host susceptibility can be higher in cold and dry environments, for instance because of a

338

slower mucociliary clearance, or a decreased host immune function under harsher conditions

339

(Fares, 2013; Tamerius et al., 2013; Lowen and Steel, 2014). Although SARS-CoV-2 is largely

340

transmitted indoor (Al Huraimel et al., 2020), climatic variation affects host immune response

341

and disease susceptibility (Tamerius et al., 2013). Moreover, it modulates human host behavior,

342

with cold temperatures leading to more time spent indoor and higher disease transmission risk

343

(Tucker and Gilliland, 2007; Fares, 2013; but see also Azuma et al., 2020 for a pattern where

16

344

contact among people increase in warm days). Thus, climate allows predictions of outbreaks of

345

respiratory illnesses (Shaman et al., 2010; Tamerius et al., 2013), acting both as direct and/or

346

indirect effect. The non-linear relationships between COVID-19 growth rate and temperature

347

detected for early outbreaks (Fig. 4a) might be explained by complex interplays between

348

weather-related changes in human social behavior, changes in host susceptibility to the virus, or

349

changes in virus survival and transmission patterns (Fares, 2013). Overall, with no or weak

350

containment measures, seasonal climatic variation may affect the spatial spread and the risk of

351

severe COVID-19 outbreaks (Merow and Urban, 2020; Wu et al., 2020c), as observed for other

352

viral diseases (Shaman et al., 2010; Tamerius et al., 2013; Lowen and Steel, 2014; Baker et al.,

353

2020), for which seasonal oscillations might lead to the worse outcomes during the colder

354

(autumn-winter) months. Nevertheless, containment measures are able to successfully limit

355

COVID-19 outbreaks in all climatic conditions (Maier and Brockmann, 2020), and climate alone

356

is unlikely to accurately predict transmission in future outbreaks.

357

The effect of air pollution on COVID-19 spread during early outbreaks was weaker than

358

the effect of local climate. In the early stages of the global outbreak, we observed more severe

359

outbreaks in regions with poor air quality, as gauged by their higher PM2.5 levels, in line with

360

studies suggesting that poor air quality may enhance local transmission and may increase

361

COVID-19 related mortality, possibly not independently of local meteorological conditions

362

(Azuma et al., 2020; Bianconi et al., 2020; Rahman et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020b; Yao et al.,

363

2020; Zhang et al., 2020). Air pollution can influence COVID-19 spread through different

364

pathways. First, several studies have shown a worsening of respiratory symptoms from viral

365

diseases in populations exposed to poor air quality (Domingo and Rovira, 2020). For instance,

366

chronic exposure to PM 2.5 correlates with overexpression of the alveolar ACE-2 receptor,

17

367

leading to more severe COVID-19 infection and increasing the likelihood of poor outcomes

368

(Frontera et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020b). Furthermore, the virus can remain viable in aerosols for

369

some hours, thus high pollution levels might increase its transmission (Frontera et al., 2020).

370

Nevertheless, more studies are required to clarify the actual impact of air pollution on COVID-

371

19 local spread patterns, as well as to identify the actual biological mechanisms (Wu et al.,

372

2020b).

373

However, the environmental effects on COVID-19 spread during the 2020 global

374

outbreak were not stable through time and disappeared when active containment actions were

375

enforced. Air quality effects became negligible when including outbreaks starting after mid-

376

March, while climate effects lasted a bit longer (until mid-April), but eventually disappeared as

377

well (Fig. 4a-b). From late March onward, most new outbreaks began under severe containment

378

actions (Fig. 1b). A weakening of environmental effects when considering late outbreaks is

379

consistent with the expectation that the enforcement of active containment policies limit the

380

spread potential of the disease and fade associations between climate and disease dynamics

381

(Baker et al., 2020; Maier and Brockmann, 2020).

382

Analyses of environmental effects on COVID-19 spread have been criticized because

383

SARS-CoV-2 shows a substantial rate of undocumented infections (Li et al., 2020b), and

384

because a high frequency of undocumented cases in some regions (e.g. in Africa) could affect

385

conclusions (Roche et al., 2018; Britton and Tomba, 2019). However, in the early phase of the

386

global outbreak, reported positives largely referred to tested individuals showing COVID-19

387

symptoms that require hospitalization. Therefore, even though our analyses cannot capture the

388

(unknown) dynamics of asymptomatic infections, they provide information on environmental

389

effects on the spread of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 cases. Furthermore, our analyses took into

18

390

account health expenditure, which is strongly correlated to the daily testing rate across countries

391

(Supplement 1, Supplementary methods and Fig. S6). The high COVID-19 growth rate in

392

countries with higher health expenditure likely arose because of more efficient early reporting of

393

cases, thus considering health expenditure in the analyses should at least partly account for

394

differences in testing rate among regions. Finally, we focused on the few days of nearly

395

exponential growth, which generally lasted < 10 days. This limits the possibility that

396

'surveillance fatigue' (Romero-Alvarez et al., 2017) affected our results.

397

Our analyses provide compelling evidence for the effectiveness of policy interventions in

398

limiting disease spread within regions (Maier and Brockmann, 2020). Although our study was

399

not designed to explicitly test the effect of containment actions, it clearly showed that outbreaks

400

starting under strict containment actions were consistently less severe than those starting under

401

no or weak containment actions. This was already evident for the early (up to end of March)

402

outbreaks, and became the main factor explaining variation in COVID-19 growth rates among

403

countries when considering later outbreaks.

404

Containing COVID-19 outbreaks is undoubtedly one of the biggest societal challenges.

405

The huge variation of COVID-19 growth rates among regions with similar climate and air

406

quality levels highlights that diverse and complex social and demographic factors, as well as

407

stochasticity, may strongly contribute to the severity of local outbreaks, irrespective of

408

environmental effects. The potential socio-economic drivers of COVID-19 outbreak are many

409

(Coelho et al., 2020; Jaffe et al., 2020). Even if we did not manage to model the spatial spread of

410

the disease across regions, we integrated several variables reflecting potential socio-economic

411

drivers. The positive relationship with human population size might be explained by multiple,

412

non-exclusive processes including an easier control of early outbreaks in regions with small

413

populations, or the occurrence of more trade and people exchanges in the most populated

414

regions, resulting in multiple infection routes and faster spread (Coelho et al., 2020; Jaffe et al.,

415

2020). However, different socio-economic factors were strongly correlated. For instance, areas

416

with high health expenditure were also inhabited by more people older than 65 years

417

(Supplement 1, Table S1), and a linear combination of human population and health expenditure

418

predicts very well international trade of goods and services (Supplement 1, Supplementary

419

methods). Assessing the specific impact of these factors was beyond the aim of this study, but we

420

emphasize that environmental and containment actions effects were consistent irrespective of the

421

specific combination of socio-economic variables being considering, suggesting that

422

unaccounted socio-economic processes should not bias our findings.

423

In conclusion, our results suggest that local environmental conditions might have affected

424

COVID-19 spread in the early (but not the late) phase of the global outbreak, and that policy

425

interventions can effectively curb disease spread irrespective of environmental conditions (Islam

426

et al., 2020b; Maier and Brockmann, 2020; Thu et al., 2020). Stringent containment measures

427

thus remain pivotal to mitigate the impacts of SARS-Cov-2 infections (Hellewell et al., 2020;

428

Maier and Brockmann, 2020). Yet, information on environmental drivers of COVID-19 can

429

improve the ability of epidemiological models to forecast the risk and time course of future

430

outbreaks, and to suggest adequate preventive or containment actions (Baker et al., 2020).

431

Studies testing the association between environmental features and COVID-19 spread are a

432

rapidly expanding research area that has been attracting increasing attention (Franch-Pardo et al.,

433

2020; Wu et al., 2020b). The unprecedented nature of the pandemic has promoted a growing

434

number of ecological regression analyses, that have identified multiple complex relationships

435

between COVID-19 spread and transmission patterns and diverse environmental features,

436

providing a crucial stimulus to a rapidly evolving area of research (Franch-Pardo et al., 2020;

437

Wu et al., 2020b). The correlative nature of these analyses should call for cautionary

438

interpretations, as identifying the causal processes linking COVID-19 spread dynamics to

439

environmental features remain challenging, still associations detected in ecological analyses can

440

serve as a key starting point for future investigations during the future evolution of the

441

pandemics (Baker et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020b).

data were sparse (< 50 regions experienced outbreaks between January 22 and February 26).

629

We fitted regression models starting from regions experiencing outbreaks up to February 27,

630

until we included all regions experiencing outbreaks up to May 31, 2020 (n = 586 regions). The

631

partial R2 statistic (variance explained by each fixed effect) was taken as a measure of the

632

relative importance of variables. a) temperature calculated using the 30-days period; b)

633

temperature calculated using the Δ14 days period (see Supplement 1, Fig. S1 for details).

638

up to May 31, 2020 (n = 586 regions). The plot includes temperature calculated using the 30-

639

days period; the pattern was identical if a Δ14 days period was used (see Supplement 1, Fig. S1

640

for details). Shaded areas represent 95% confidence bands. When confidence bands do not cross

641

the horizontal broken line (0 threshold), the effect of a given variable is statistically significant
