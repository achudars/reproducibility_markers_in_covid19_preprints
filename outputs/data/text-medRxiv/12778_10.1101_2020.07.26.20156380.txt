Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically changed medical practice worldwide. It
posed a significant impact on different health services, including dermatology. A
Cross-sectional observational study of 200 healthcare providers and 100
dermatologists (survey 1 and 2, respectively) were conducted to determine the
prevalence of occupational skin diseases among healthcare providers working
amid the pandemic, and to demonstrate the outbreak’s impact on dermatology
practice.
Most healthcare providers (83%) reported hygiene-related hand dermatitis. The
rates of PPE- related dermatoses were estimated to be 73%, including pressure
injuries (51.9%), acne (33.1%), non-gloves contact dermatitis (29.9%), nonspecific
eruption (17.5%), urticaria (9.1%) and skin infections (3.2%). The emerging COVID19-related cutaneous manifestations were recognized by 20% of surveyed
dermatologists, including maculopapular eruption (41.67%), urticaria (37.50%),
chilblain (25%) and vasculitis (16.67). Telemedicine was provided by 73% of the
dermatologists, and 89% reported minimal use of immunosuppressive drugs amid
the pandemic.

An ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARSCoV2, started in December 2019. It was first identified in Wuhan, China. The
virus then propagated and began to hit other regions around the world until it
was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on
March 11, 2020 (1).
The emerging COVID-19 virus is phylogenetically linked to viruses that cause
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome
(MERS). COVID-19 creates variable degrees of illness, ranging from fever, cough,
dyspnea, fatigue, and diarrhea to critical cases of severe acute respiratory distress
syndrome (2).
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought the world to a standstill and placed
considerable challenges on healthcare workers, including dermatologists.
Telemedicine has gained particular importance, where many of the dermatologic
consultations were transitioned into teledermatology services. The current
outbreak has led to the ongoing emergence of personal protective equipment
(PPE)- related dermatoses and hygiene-related hand dermatitis, particularly
among healthcare providers. In addition, due to a shortage of vaccination
programs imposed by the COVID-19 lockdown, there is a significant risk for other
infectious disease outbreaks, including measles.

Objectives and methods
A cross-sectional observational study involving two online surveys were
conducted for data collection. The purpose of using two questionnaires is twofold:
1. to comprehensively examine the effect of COVID-19 on different aspects of
medical practice
2. to concentrate on the virus effect on dermatologic practice.
A 5-item electronic survey was created and sent to 276 randomly selected
healthcare providers working in the emergency departments, inpatient wards,
and outpatient clinics of the major hospitals in Iraq. The survey assessed the
frequency of occupational skin diseases due to hygienic work practices and PPE
use among healthcare providers working during the current pandemic. The
participants were asked about their gender, age, and the frequency of
hygienerelated
hand dermatitis and skin complications related to PPE use.
For survey 2, a 12-item electronic questionnaire was sent to 156 randomly
selected dermatologists practicing within the COVID-19 era. The dermatologists
were asked about the impact of the current outbreak on various aspects of
dermatology practice, including the provided medical services, infection control
methods, disease epidemiology, and the currently recommended medical and

Discussion
Impact of COVID-19 on medical services
We have reviewed the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the practice of
dermatology in Iraq. Although the population of Iraq exceeded 40 million in 2020,
based on the latest United Nation data (3), available statistics indicate that the
number of physicians is 7.08 per 10,000 populations which is extremely low when
compared to developed countries (4).
On February 24, 2020, Iraq announced the first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2
infection. Since then, the spread of COVID-19 has increased. exponentially. By
early September, about 260,370 confirmed cases and 7,512 deaths had been
reported in Iraq (5).
The COVID-19 pandemic has targeted every single aspect of medical practice,
including dermatology. As Baghdad became the epicenter of the COVID-19
pandemic in mid-March, most dermatology clinics were closed or continued to
operate at a minimal capacity. The objective was to provide essential medical care

for emergency cases, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal
necrolysis, erythroderma, acute angioedema, and lesions worrisome for skin
cancer.
With the acute shortage of PPE, medical practitioners clenched their teeth with
each patient, wondering if they had been exposed to the virus already. COVID-19
patients may present with a wide range of dermatologic manifestations with or
without typical respiratory signs (6) (7).
Of the 100 dermatologists involved in the survey, 20% reported diagnosing one or
more COVID-19 related skin manifestations. These have included the most
commonly diagnosed diseases: erythematous maculopapular eruption (41.67%),
urticaria (37.50%), chilblains (25%), and vasculitis (16.67%) (Figure 1).

Impact of COVID-19 on infection control
The dermatology team tried to reduce face-to-face consultations in both public
hospitals and private practice clinics, limiting them to emergency patients.
Nonemergent presentations, including melasma, acne, vitiligo, and stable psoriasis,
were diverted to telemedicine platforms to avoid the unwarranted risk of spreading
infection. Despite these measures, about 25 dermatologists
contracted COVID-19 during routine patient care.
The survey revealed that during the outbreak, 72 % of practicing dermatologists
provided teledermatology consultations through telephone and/or online social
network applications. Because dermatology diagnosis depends primarily on visual
characteristics, dermatologists had already been leaders in providing telemedicine
services even before the crisis, leading to greater success with this
experience.
In order to reduce the risk of infection spread while attending dermatology clinics,
several measures have been implemented including stressing commitment to
social distancing and wearing a mask, the pre-examination measurement of the

equipment(8)(Figure2).

Impact of COVID-19 on skin disease epidemiology
 Hand dermatitis
Due to frequent handwashing, prolonged use of gloves, and overuse of
disinfectants, the incidence of hand dermatitis among healthcare staff and the
general population has dramatically increased (Figure 3).
In this survey, hand dermatitis was reported in 83% of healthcare providers
working during the current pandemic. Another study reported a comparable
result of gloves-related hand dermatitis (88.5%) among healthcare providers
working in Hubei Province hospitals amid the outbreak (9). A pre-outbreak
epidemiologic study in mainland China found the frequency of hand dermatitis to
range from 14.3% to 23.8% across hospital departments, far from those recorded
during the COVID-19 outbreak (10).
Several measures can be used to decrease the incidence of hand dermatitis,
including the use of mild soaps (syndets) that are equally effective in preventing
the viral spread and frequent use of moisturizers and physical barriers, especially

after handwashing to protect the skin and decrease irritation. Depending on the
severity of the lesions, established hand dermatitis should be treated with
emollients and/or topical steroids (11).

Personal protective equipment (PPE)-related dermatoses
Prolonged contact with PPE such as masks, protective gowns, face shields, and
goggles has led to an unprecedented emergence of PPE-related dermatoses
among healthcare providers working amidst the current pandemic. PPE-induced
skin injuries are attributed to mechanical friction, long-term occlusion,
maceration, and allergic contact reactions (12).
Among the surveyed healthcare providers, 147 (73.5%) reported PPE-related

dermatoses. Of these, 111 (75.5%) occurred in women and 36 (24.9%) in men.
The median age was 31 years (range 24-47 years; standard deviation 4.94 years).
The frequency of PPE-related dermatosis reported in this survey includes:
pressure injuries (51.9%), acne (33.1%), non-gloves contact dermatitis (29.9%),
nonspecific dermatitis and itching (17.5%), urticaria (9.1%), and skin infections
(3.2%) (Figure 4). Folliculitis can occur at the site of skin friction, and the inflamed
follicles may become infected with bacteria, especially Staphylococcus aureus.
Friction caused by surgical masks can also trigger reactivation of the Herpes
simplex virus.
The frequency of PPE-related cutaneous complications among healthcare workers
in the Hubei Province during the COVID-19 era included adverse skin reactions
associated with the prolonged wearing of PPE, including N95 mask, latex glove,
and protective clothing, were 95.1%, 88.5% and 60.7%, respectively (8).
During the SARS outbreak, the prevalence of PPE-related dermatosis among
Singapore health care workers included the findings that 35.5% of the staff who

used masks regularly developed acne (59.6%), facial itching (51.4%), and
dermatitis (35.8%), while 21.4% who used gloves regularly developed adverse skin
reactions, including dry skin (73.4%), itching (56.3%), and dermatitis (37.5%) (13).
In an analysis of incident case reports from UK dermatologists, non-glove PPE
related dermatoses between 1993 and 2013 revealed that 15.5% of the affected
patients were health and social workers (14).

General measures to reduce skin damage associated with the PPE include wearing
suitable PPE, avoiding prolonged use wherever possible, and working in a cooler
environment. In the areas of maximum tension, dressings can be applied to the
skin to redistribute pressure and reduce friction. Frequent use of moisturizers is
advisable to protect and repair the skin barrier, and adequate cleansing is
necessary to prevent secondary infections (15).
Mild pressure injuries with intact epidermis usually heal spontaneously without
intervention. Small bullae can be kept intact, while larger ones can be aspirated to

ease the associated pressure. Eczematous lesions are treated with moisturizers
and/or topical steroids, depending on the severity of the lesions. Antihistamines
may be used for associated pruritus. For resistant cases, a patch test may be
necessary to identify the allergen involved. Mask-related frictional acne can be
treated with topical benzoyl peroxide, retinoids, and antimicrobials, similar to
acne vulgaris (16).

 Chronic skin disease relapse
It is currently enigmatic how COVID-19 can affect those with chronic skin
conditions such as psoriasis and how it can affect these individuals' treatment.
The psychologic impact of the crisis, patients' reluctance to attend a clinic
appointment, limited use of immunosuppressive drugs, and shortage of drugs
lead to a perceptible increase in the rate of relapse and exacerbation of several
chronic skin diseases (17). Relapse rates of psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, rosacea,
vitiligo, and alopecia areata were noticeably increased as observed by 64.70%,
58.82%, 17.64% 9.80%, and 5.88% of dermatologists, respectively.
Patients should be strongly advised against stopping their medications without
consulting their physicians (18). The importance of supporting patients with chronic
dermatologic conditions during the current crisis cannot be overemphasized.
 Preventable infectious diseases
The WHO expressed great concern about the spread of previously controllable
infectious diseases like measles. Derangement of immunization services caused

by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is likely to further to decrease measles
vaccination coverage by an additional 20%, leaving the most susceptible children
at risk for highly infectious disease outbreak (19). About 14% of the surveyed
dermatologists recorded new cases of measles amid the current pandemic;
hence, health authorities are called to emphasize the importance of identifying
and reaching children with missed vaccine doses to avoid an inevitable outbreak.
Impact of COVID-19 on dermatologic treatments
Several expert opinions have recommended restricting the use of
immunosuppressive agents during the current pandemic (20) (21). Most
dermatologists in the survey reported reduced use of non-biologic
immunosuppressants and limited their prescription to selected cases, particularly
when alternative options are exhausted, and only after COVID19 symptoms have
been excluded. In this condition, the dose should be kept to
the lowest acceptable level that still adequately controls the disease.
Due to the uncertainty of whether biologics may place patients at a higher risk of

COVID-19 or more dramatic disease course, the initiation of biologic therapy in
the current crisis is unadvisable. Alternative therapeutic approaches, particularly
in vulnerable patients, may be considered (22). Patients already receiving
scheduled biological therapy, who do not exhibit respiratory symptoms or test
positive for COVID-19 may continue their treatment while underscoring the
importance of COVID-19 preventive measures, like social distancing and
selfquarantining (23).
Impact of COVID-19 on surgical dermatology
Most of the non-essential dermatological procedures and biopsies were
postponed to minimize the risk of spreading COVID-19 infection. Skin surgery was
limited to a few undeferrable biopsies and high-risk skin cancer removal when the
risk of delay exceeded the risk of exposure to the virus (Figure 5). Some hospitals
have applied specific internal protocols to protect their patients and staff,
including testing patients for COVID-19 before their scheduled surgeries and
procedures, providing full PPE to all operating staff, and solicitous intraoperative
environment sterilization and waste disposal (24).

Baghdad has been hit particularly hard by COVID-19, where almost half of the
confirmed cases were recorded. The dermatology staff felt the call of duty and
were actively involved in the respiratory triage at the emergency department,
where they continued to help patients and support their fellow physicians.
Nineteen percent of the dermatologists surveyed reported working in the
respiratory triage or other COVID-19 related units.

Conclusion
The COVID-19 related preventive measures are associated with an upsurge in
occupational skin diseases related to excessive handwashing, overuse of
disinfectants, and prolonged utilization of personal protective equipment. The
pandemic’s psychological impact, the fear of attending hospitals, and the
shortage of medications have led to an increase in the relapse rate of common
chronic skin diseases like psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. The dermatologic
management plans were overshadowed by the current public health crisis, where
