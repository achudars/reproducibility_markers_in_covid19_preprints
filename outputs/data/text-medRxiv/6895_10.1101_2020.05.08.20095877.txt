Abstract
Objectives
Our primary objective is to predict the dynamics of COVID-19 epidemic in India while
adjusting for the effects of various progressively implemented containment measures. Apart from
forecasting the major turning points and parameters associated with the epidemic, we intend to
provide an epidemiological assessment of the impact of these containment measures in India.
Methods
We propose a method based on time-series SIR model to estimate time-dependent
modifiers for transmission rate of the infection. These modifiers are used in state-space SIR
model to estimate reproduction number R0, expected total incidence, and to forecast the daily
prevalence till the end of the epidemic. We consider four different scenarios, two based on
current developments and two based on hypothetical situations for the purpose of comparison.
Results
Assuming gradual relaxation in lockdown post 17 May 2020, we expect the prevalence of
infecteds to cross 9 million, with at least 1 million severe cases, around the end of October 2020.
For the same case, estimates of R0 for the phases no-intervention, partial-lockdown and
lockdown are 4.46 (7.1), 1.47 (2.33), and 0.817 (1.29) respectively, assuming 14-day (24-day)
infectious period.
Conclusions
Estimated modifiers give consistent estimates of unadjusted R0 across different scenarios,
demonstrating precision. Results corroborate the effectiveness of lockdown measures in
substantially reducing R0. Also, predictions are highly sensitive towards estimate of infectious
period.

Introduction

1.1

Context

In the absence of vaccines or effective antiviral therapies for COVID-19, governments all
over the world are turning to classical non-pharmaceutical public health measures to contain the
epidemic, such as isolation, quarantine, social distancing and community containment. Rigorous
implementation of these four traditional counter-measures helped in halting the earlier epidemic
of SARS-CoV in 2002-2003 [Kundapur et al. (2020); Wilder-Smith and Freedman (2020)]. As
of May 8, 2020, infections across India have surged past 53,000 cases with 1783 deaths reported.
The government of India has implemented these containment and mitigating interventions along
with travel restrictions and lockdown of the entire country to slow down the spread of the virus.
Epidemiological assessment using infectious disease modelling is the key to evaluate the impact
of these measures on transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in India, and thus provide crucial
information to the policy makers in government organizations to plan ahead for an effective and
sustained public health response to manage the epidemic.
1.2

Review of epidemiological modeling of COVID-19

Recent studies of COVID-19 have attempted to predict number of case counts, rate of
transmission, reproduction rate/ number (R0), size of epidemic and end date of the epidemic. R0
is an important factor for risk assessment of any epidemic and is defined as the expected number
of secondary cases that arise from a typical infectious index-case in a completely susceptible host
population. Wang et al. (2020) have developed a health informatics toolbox with an R package
called eSIR to understand epidemiological trend of COVID -19 in Hubei province and other
regions of China. Their model considers a time varying quarantine factor to forecast future trend
of COVID -19 spread in these regions. An earlier study by Chinazzi et al. (2020) assessed the
impact of such restrictions based on data of over 3200 sub-populations in roughly 200 different
countries and territories across the world. They have used a meta-population network approach,
in which each sub-population is modelled using a Susceptible-Latent-Infectious-Removed
(SLIR) model.
COVID-19 in India
Using a compartmental SEIR model, Chatterjee et al. (2020a) have concluded that
effective implementation of quarantine and other non-pharmacological interventions would bring
down the epidemic spread of COVID-19 in India to a manageable level. Mandal et al. (2020)
used a SEIR model with a quarantine component to predict an effective reduction in cumulative
incidence in India. A SIR model is developed by Singh and Adhikari (2020) based on data up to
the first phase of India’s total lockdown to illustrate the need of sustained lockdowns with
periodic relaxations. Some other recent work on COVID-19 in India include Tiwari (2020) and
Gupta et al. (2020).
All these studies on COVID-19 infection dynamics in India are based on the assumption
of constant disease transmission rate. However, phase-wise imposition of travel restrictions,
lockdown and other non-pharmaceutical preventive measures, as well as increasing community
level awareness with time, are expected to induce time varying effects in the transmission rate.
1.3

Our approach

To account for variations in transmission rate of the infection due to the implementation of
various containment protocols, we propose to implement a time-dependent state-space SIR

model to the observed data from India. Instead of taking a pre-specified step function modifier
like Ray et al. (2020), we propose a time-series SIR based approach to estimate the phase-wise
transmission modifiers. Modifier functions, both step and exponential, are estimated using the
daily prevalence data reported in India from 2nd March, 2020 to 30th April, 2020.

Methodology

2.1

The extended state-space SIR model with time varying transmission rate

Several containment measures have been implemented in India at different points in time
creating phases of quarantine/ containment levels across the country. Such phases are expected to
exhibit different rates of transmission of the disease, i.e., transmission rates become timedependent. If we assume that the change (or reduction) in the transmission rate is strictly because
of macro level measures implemented by the authorities, we can define a specific transmission
rate for each phase based on the level of containment. Wang et al. (2020) have proposed a step
function approach to define such modifiers. However, it is also true that apart from the
containment measures implemented by the government, rising awareness at micro community
levels also contributes towards reducing the rate of transmission. To incorporate this idea, they
have suggested defining the transmission modifier as a continuous function of time.
Suppose there are three different phases, with two points of major changes in quarantine/
lockdown protocols. Let Pi denotes i-th phase, such that P1 represents the initial phase without
any such protocol in place. Then, the step function for transmission rate modifier, π(t), can be
expressed as follows.
(1)
Where, π1 = 1 if P1 represents the phase without any intervention. Following exponential
modifier functions can be used to account for continuous changes in modifier values with time.
(2)
We have applied both approaches to define modifiers for the base transmission rate β. The
effective rate of transmission at time t is given as, βt = β.π(t). Using this time-dependent
transmission rate, the eSIR model proposed by Wang et al. (2020) is fitted to predict daily
prevalence of infected, removed and susceptible. This model is a time-dependent version of the
state-space SIR model introduced by Osthus et al. (2017), and can be defined as follows.

Where:
- Time series of proportion of infected cases
- Time series of proportion of removed cases (Recovered + Dead)
- Prevalence of infection at time t in terms of probability (probability of a person being
infected at time t)

Solution of this set of differential equations is achieved using the Runge-Kutta
approximation.
Overall success of this modelling structure depends heavily on the relevance of the
modifier values specified for different phases. Using appropriate values of πi’s in (1) and the
constants
and in (2) will be imperative towards achieving reliable predictions. To avoid
misleading predictions resulting from speculative pre-specified values of the modifiers, we
propose methods based on time-series SIR model to estimate these values. The proposed method
is described in the following section.
2.2

Estimation of modifiers of β for different phases of quarantine/ lockdown measures

Time-series SIR (TSIR) model [Bjørnstad et al. (2002); Finkenstadt, et al. (2002); Grenfell
et al. (2002)] is used to estimate time-dependent modifier values. In the step function π(t), the
steps (or phases) are defined according to different levels of preventive measures implemented
by the government over the observed period of time. In TSIR model, the response, being a count
variable, is assumed to follow certain discrete count process distribution like Poisson distribution
or Negative Binomial distribution; refer Bjørnstad (2018). The basic structure of TSIR model can
be defined as follows.

Where, St and It are the number of susceptibles and infecteds (or infectives) at time t, N is
the population size, β0 is the transmission rate and
is the expected number of new infecteds
at time t+1. New number of infecteds is assumed to follow Negative Binomial (or Poisson)
distribution and a generalized Negative Binomial (or Poisson) linear model with log link is fitted
with
as a covariate and
as an offset variable. The exponent α is expected to be just
under 1 (i.e. close to 1) and is meant to account for discretizing the underlying continuous
process. However, we can present an alternative interpretation of α, using basic SIR model, by

writing an approximate expression (taking α = 1) for expected number of new infecteds at time
t+1 with a time-varying transmission rate, as given below.
(10)
Comparing equations (8) and (10), we can see that if α = 1 (or close to 1), βt = β0 (constant
over time). However, if the value of α deviates considerably from 1, it has impact on the
effective value of transmission rate, thus making the effective rate of transmission timedependent. That is, in such cases α assimilates the changes in transmission rate over time. From
equations (8) and (10), we can further write,
(11)
Option 1: Defining step function for phase specific modifiers
Using the TSIR model, we estimate β0 and α separately for each phase. The effective
transmission rate, βt, is then estimated at each time t using equation (11). Average of these
estimates over the time range of a phase is taken as an estimate of the effective transmission rate
for that phase. Suppose we have three time phases in our study, say P1, P2, and P3. Then, the
estimate of phase specific transmission rate will be given as,
(12)
And the estimated step function of modifiers will be,

(13)

Option 2: Defining continuous time-dependent exponential modifier function
Instead of fitting phase-wise models, we fit a generalized linear model on the entire
observed data and obtain estimates of effective transmission rates, , using equation (11). We
derive estimates of modifiers at each time point t for the entire observed period as,
(14)
Where,
is the estimate at t =1. However, if the first phase P1 is small, we can take
to avoid impact of extreme observation at t =1 (if present). As an alternative, we can take
as an average of first few values of . We can fit any of the following exponential functions to
the estimated modifiers using least squares estimation. We have used only the first form in our
study.
(15)
This continuous modifier function will not be phase specific and will reflect steadily
increasing awareness at community-level which encourages voluntary participation in quarantine
and preventive measure. The steadily decreasing modifier function can also represent the
learning curve of the organizational structure associated with implementation of proposed
preventive measures like quarantine, travel ban, partial lockdown and complete lockdown.

Implementation

3.1

Data

Since some states in India have not reported any cases and some have reported only few,
we have considered populations of states with at least 10 confirmed cases reported till 20 April,
2020 for calculating total number of susceptibles. Baseline state-wise population data is obtained
from the 2011 census of India (www.censusindia.gov.in). The estimated average growth rate
based on the current total population of India and the total population of India in 2011 is
estimated as 1.23% per annum. This rate is used to estimate current total populations of the 25
states which have been included in the calculation of total number of susceptibles. Data on the
timeline of implementation of travel restrictions, isolation, lockdown, quarantine and other
preventive measures by the central and state governments is compiled from various notifications
issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of External Affairs available on their
official websites. Time-series data on daily prevalence of total confirmed, total recovered and
total deaths is sourced from the github repository of the Centre for Systems Science and
Engineering, Johns Hopkins University (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).
3.2

Defining longitudinal phases based on containment protocols

While analyzing the effect of containment measures on rate of transmission of infection, it
is important that we take into account the average incubation period. The mean incubation period
of COVID-19, defined as the time from exposure to the onset of illness, is reported to be around
5 days by many researchers; refer Lauer et al. (2020); Chatterjee et al. (2020b) and Yuan et al.
(2020) among others. This means that the impact of any intervention on the transmission rate can
be expected to be visible only after 5 days, on an average. Given the fact that India has preferred
focused group testing over random testing, it becomes important to address the expected lag in
reporting of cases. So, for improving the analysis, cut-off dates for defining phases have been
extended by 5 days to accommodate for the lag in effect induced by the incubation period.
Complete lockdown in India came into effect on 25 March 2020. However, because of sudden
loss of jobs and earnings of daily wagers, and the uncertainty looming over the extension of
lockdown period, there were huge movements of migrant workers across India, with most of
them trying to reach their homes. Overwhelming number of reports emerged about inter-state
travels of large groups of people, with many even forced to travel hundreds of kilometers on
foot. According to an article published in Business Standards, [Jha (2020)], on 31 March 2020
the central government reported in the Supreme Court that 500,000-600,000 migrants reached
their villages on foot during the lockdown. However, as per news reports, most of the state
governments, assisted by various NGOs, had come up with adequate relief shelters and food
arrangements for the stranded migrant laborers by 30 March 2020. Also, affected states started
compulsory quarantine facilities for people migrating from other states. These measures helped
in containing any significant movement and ensuring implementation of complete lockdown.
Citing these developments, we have assumed the effective date of implementation of complete
lockdown as 31 March 2020. Adding incubation period of 5 days, the cut-off date for the third
phase for our analysis is taken as 04 April 2020.
3.3

Modifier functions and hyper-parameters

Based on the phases defined in section 3.2, step-function modifier, π(t), is estimated
using equation (13). Negative Binomial TSIR models are chosen over Poisson TSIR models to

find estimates of
(equation (11)). Poisson models showed inflated residual deviance and
proved unfit for the data. Estimated step-function is given below.
(16)
Hyper-parameters for Bayesian estimation
Using data on COVID-19 patients in China, Verity et al. (2020) have estimated mean
duration from onset of symptoms to death to be 17.8 days (95% credible interval 16.9–19.2) and
to hospital discharge to be 24.7 days (22.9–28.1). Mean infectious period is calculated as
weighted average of these durations using observed proportions of deaths and recoveries among
the total removed cases till 30 April 2020 in India as weights. The estimated mean infectious
period is: 0.113 x 17.8 + 0.887 x 24.7 ≈ 24 days. Thus, the estimate for hyper-parameter for γ is,
γ0 = 1/24 = 0.042. However, since there is dearth of comprehensive studies confirming infectious
period at this early stage of the epidemic, we have also performed analyses taking mean
infectious period of 14 days (i.e. γ0 = 1/14 = 0.0714), as reported by the World Health
Organisation; see WHO (2020). So, at this juncture it is safe to assume that the reality may lie
somewhere between the projections based on our two assumed cases for γ0. The value for the
hyper-parameter β is estimated as the average of effective transmission rates over the total
observed period (02 March 2020- 30 March 2020). This is achieved by fitting the Negative
Binomial TSIR model and using equation (12) for the entire observed period.
Continuous modifier function
The estimated continuous modifier function using equation (14) is given below.
(17)
3.4

Forecasting assumptions

We have assumed four different scenarios for forecasting the trajectory of the
COVID-19 epidemic. The four cases are summarized in Table 2. Case 1 and Case 3 are realistic
scenarios based on current developments, while Case 2 and Case 4 are hypothetical scenarios
strictly for the purpose of comparison.
3.5

Data calibration

In India, till now, testing strategy has been focused primarily on high risk individuals.
However, to understand the community spread in the country, large scale random testing should
be conducted among those who have no travel history [Rao et al. (2020)]. As reported recently
by the Indian Council of Medical Research, around 80% of the total infected (confirmed) cases
in India are asymptomatic; refer www.indiatoday.in (2020). In the absence of rigorous testing, it
is but natural that a large number of true cases are going undetected and hence unreported in
India. This subsequently leads to concerns about the actual number of deaths due to COVID -19
also going unreported [Shaikh (2020); Biswas (2020)].
We have used a simple intuitive technique for data calibration to account for possible
under-reporting. We divide the observed data on total confirmed, recovered and deaths by a
constant ρ (where 0 < ρ ≤ 1). Proportion of under-reporting is 1- ρ, i.e., ρ = 1 implies zero underreporting. We have considered two levels of under-reporting, 75% (ρ =0.25) and 50% (ρ=0.5). It

is not easy to estimate the proportion of under-reporting, especially at this stage of the epidemic.
However, we have based our assumptions on certain reports on scientific work in this regard;
refer Jayan (2020).
3.6

Plotting predicted prevalence

MCMC posterior realizations on the prevalence of infected and removed are obtained from
the output of tvt.eSIR( ) function of the eSIR package. Posterior mean of predicted prevalence of
infecteds is plotted against time along with daily estimated prevalence of mild to moderate,
severe and critical cases among the total infecteds. To predict the cases belonging to the
categories mild to moderate, severe and critical, we have considered the respective proportions,
80.1%, 13.8%, and 6.1%, as reported by the World Health Organisation; refer WHO (2020). To
predict the number of deaths, we have used current proportion of deaths among the total removed
cases in India, which is around 10%. Prevalence of removed is plotted against time along with
estimated number of cases for the events recovered and death. Plots for case 3 of step-function
modifier and for exponential modifier at two different values of γ are presented in Graphs 1-5.

Results and Discussion

Estimated values of time-dependent transmission rate adjusted for modifier,
(for phase
1,
= ) , rate of removal, , and reproduction number R0, along with their 95% credible
intervals based on posterior realizations are reported for all models and all cases discussed in the
implementation section. Expected total incidence (as % of total population), and forecasted dates
for two crucial turning points of the epidemic are also reported for each case. The first turning
point signifies the time at which the rate of increase in the number of infecteds starts decreasing
(deceleration). The second crucial turning point is the peak time of the infected curve beyond
which the prevalence of infecteds starts decreasing. Table 3 and Table 4 present results for all
four cases of step-function modifier based eSIR, for the initial estimate of infectious period as 24
days and 14 days respectively. Results from the exponential modifier function based eSIR, for
both observed and calibrated data, are presented in Table 5. Table 6 contains results for
calibrated data using case 3 of step-function modifier in the eSIR model.
At γ0 = 0.042 (24-day infectious period), estimated values of the production rate R0
(unadjusted) consistently stays around 7 in all cases, and at γ0 = 0.0714 (14-day infectious
period) its estimates cluster around 4 for all cases. Consistency of the estimate of R0 (unadjusted)
and β (base value unadjusted for modifiers) under different hypothesized situations suggests that
our estimates of modifiers are able to explain the changes in the transmission rate in their
respective phases. Estimates of R0 are comparatively very small in the containment phases, with
that for the complete lockdown being the minimum. For example, citing results of case 1 from
Table 3, under the assumption of 24-day infectious period, R0 is estimated to be 1.29 for the
lockdown period, and around 2.33 for the quarantine/ partial lockdown phase, as opposed to 7.1
in the no-intervention phase. Similar results are obtained for the case 3, at both levels of γ0. R0
values estimated from exponential modifier function based approach are slightly on the lower
side as compared to those obtained from the step-function approach. This is expected as the use
of exponential modifier function results in continuous decline in the transmission rates through
time.
Estimate of (mean) total incidence is very sensitive to the choice of infectious period.
Even under the assumption of complete lockdown till the end of epidemic, the estimated total
incidence jumps from 0.35% to 7.7% of the population as we increase the infectious period from

14 days to 24 days. Similar jumps are seen in all cases. Unfortunately, as discussed in section
3.3, the existing reports on COVID-19 at this early stage of the epidemic are not conclusive
about the duration of infectious period. In addition, current recovery/ death trends of different
countries indicate that recovery rates and death rates can vary significantly between different
regions.
Although we obtained most optimistic results under the assumption of complete lockdown
like situation throughout the course of the pandemic, it is not practical to believe that our
economy can sustain such a measure for such a long duration. Among the situations assumed for
prediction using step-function modifiers, future assumptions for case 3 are practically most
achievable. Also, daily predictions of number of infecteds for the month of May based on case 3
of step-function modifiers, with 24-day infectious period, are closest to the actual reported data
as compared to those of any other scenario considered in this study; refer Graph 5. To restrict the
COVID-19 spread within the limits predicted by case 3 results, we have to ensure that the post
complete lockdown period should not let R0 to go beyond 1.32 (14-day infectious period) or
beyond 2.14 (24-day infectious period). If we are able to do that, depending on the actual
recovery time of COVID-19 patients in India we can expect around 9.1% to 31.8% of the total
population to get infected with SARS-CoV-2 by the time the epidemic ends. Assuming 75%
under-reporting of infected and recovered/ deceased cases, the range of expected total incidence
becomes 30.1% - 67.2%, and for 50% under-reporting of cases, it is estimated as 16.4% - 49.7%.
The rate of infection is expected to start decreasing around the end of August or start of
September 2020, and the total number of active cases is expected to start declining towards the
end of October 2020. If there is under-reporting of cases, these dates of turning points are
expected to shift earlier by around a week.
It is also worth mentioning that if the lockdown measures had not been implemented and
only quarantine and partial lockdown were continued (case 2), we would be expecting around
22% to 53% of the population to be infected by the end of the epidemic. And if there was no
containment measure in place since start (case 4), 88% to 95% of the population would have
contracted the infection till the time epidemic lasted.
Since the exponential modifier function assumes a continuous decline in the effective
transmission rate, it may overlook some important real life factors while predicting the course of
the epidemic, and hence it may result in underestimation of the overall impact of the epidemic.
As expected, the results obtained using this approach is closer to those of case1 where complete
lockdown is assumed beyond 17 May 2020. Use of exponential modifier function may not be the
best way to describe the effects of sudden drastic measures like complete lockdown, travel ban
etc.
Even in the best case scenario as depicted by the results obtained using the exponential
modifier function, the total incidence is predicted to be up to 1.2% (without data calibration) and
up to 2% (with data calibration). That is, around 16 million to 27 million people are expected to
end up getting infected with SARS-CoV-2 by the time the epidemic ends. According to the
predictions from the exponential modifier approach, when the prevalence of infected reaches its
peak around mid to end of July 2020, there will be around 60,000 (14-day recovery period) to
500,000 (24-day recovery period) severe cases who will need hospitalization, at once (Graph 3
and Graph 4). The picture becomes even more unsettling when we study the graphs of the case 3
predictions (Graph 1 and Graph 2). These figures range between 1 million to 8 million for the
two cases, and the peak time is expected to be around the end of October 2020.

Conclusion

Substantial reduction in the reproduction rate R0 during the partial lockdown and complete
lockdown phases corroborates the effectiveness of these interventions in containing the spread of
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Assuming an average recovery (or infectious) period of 14 days, R0 is
estimated to have reached below 1 in the complete lockdown phase. However, assuming a 24day recovery period, the estimate of R0 remained above 1 even during the complete lockdown. In
case 3 we have considered existing situation of containment measures till 17 May 2020, and at
(24-day infectious period) the daily predictions for May 2020 are much closer to the
actual reported values (as observed till 11 May 2020) as compared to those at
(14day infectious period). However, more clinical reports based on wider patient level data are
imperative towards finding reliable estimates of recovery time for COVID-19 patients.
The fact that instead of using pre-specified modifier for each phase, we have estimated
phase-specific modifiers from the observed data improves our chances of obtaining more reliable
estimates of transmission rate and R0 as compared to other recent studies on India, like Ray et al.
(2020). Use of lower than true values of modifiers may lead to over-estimation of transmission
rate and vice-versa. Also, our procedure of defining cut-off dates for different phases of
containment measures assimilates the effects of incubation period and initial lapses in the
implementation of the lockdown.
Even under the most optimistic scenarios, the time for flattening of curve is still quite far.
The number of infected cases is expected to increase at even a higher rate at the moment and by
the time the peak is expected, we will need an extensive amount of medical and infrastructural
preparedness. Quoting the results based on the assumptions of case 3, which we have repeatedly
deemed as the most realistic case, and whose predictions for the first week of May 2020 are
closest to the observed values among all cases, we need to be prepared with enough medical
infrastructure and equipments to be able to handle between 1 million to 8 million severe cases
around the end of October 2020.
Limitations
We have considered same estimates of phase-specific modifier for the entire country
assuming that the lockdown and other containment protocols have been homogeneously
implemented across India. However, because of significant differences in various socioeconomic, demographic, cultural, and administrative level factors, actual transmission rates are
bound to differ from region to region. Hence, the estimated parameters in our study are only
valid for overall predictions of cases in India, on an average, and may fail to trace the dynamics
of the epidemic in sub-regions, say districts or states.

Because of slight relaxations in green and

increase a bit till 17 May. After that it is
assumed that more economic and industrial
work will start, bringing the modifier value
closer to that of second phase, but will remain
less than that as red zones will be strictly
contained.

If no containment measures were taken through

Appendix-A
Detailed time-line of containment measures implemented in India
18.01.2020:

Thermal screening of all passengers coming from China and Hong Kong started at
three international airports.

30.01.2020:

First Covid-19 case reported in India. Travel history from Wuhan, China

04.03.2020:

By this date thermal screening was initiated in a progressive manner (depending
on spread of the disease to other countries) for all international passengers at all
ports of entry (land, sea and air-ports) through various travel advisories.

13.03.2020 - 22.03.2020: During this period various state governments brought out notices for
restricting social contacts - ban on public gatherings of any kind; shutting down
of academic institutes; restrictions on public transportation; screening of interstate

passengers at airports; and complete lockdown of some states from 23.03.2020 till
31.03.2020.
15.03.2020 – 21.03.20202: Min. 14-days quarantine made mandatory for all incoming
travelers from Covid-19 infected countries (in progressive manner).
Also suspension of all Visa till 15/04/2020
22.03.2020:

Ban on all incoming international flights, except those already on transit.
Suspension of all mass transportation services, like metro, rail, domestic air, till
31/03/2020, except those that started their journey before 22.03.2020.

25.03.2020:

Complete lockdown till 14/04/2020. However, large-scale movements of migrant
workers across various states started from 26/03/2020.

29.03.2020:

Order issued to all state governments on this date to stop the migrants’ movements
and setting up of relief camps for those already in transit.

From the above box, we can take:
30/03/2020:

As effective date of starting of measures to stop migrant movements across
various states during complete lockdown till 14/04/2020.

15/04/2020:

Complete lockdown extended till 03/05/2020 with new containment measures for
hotspot areas.

20/04/2020:

Complete lockdown till 03/05/2020 with new containment measures for hotspot
areas + certain exemption for selected activities + limited movements of migrant
workers with states/UT .
