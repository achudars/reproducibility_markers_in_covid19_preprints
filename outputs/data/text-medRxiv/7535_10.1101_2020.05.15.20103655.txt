Abstract
Assessing the effects of early non-pharmaceutical interventions1-5 on COVID-19 spread
in the United States is crucial for understanding and planning future control measures to
combat the ongoing pandemic6-10. Here we use county-level observations of reported
infections and deaths11, in conjunction with human mobility data12 and a metapopulation
transmission model13,14, to quantify changes of disease transmission rates in US
counties from March 15, 2020 to May 3, 2020. We find significant reductions of the
basic reproductive numbers in major metropolitan areas in association with social
distancing and other control measures. Counterfactual simulations indicate that, had
these same control measures been implemented just 1-2 weeks earlier, a substantial
number of cases and deaths could have been averted. Specifically, nationwide, 56.5%
[95% CI: 48.1%-65.9%] of reported infections and 54.0% [95% CI: 43.6%-63.8%] of
reported deaths as of May 3, 2020 could have been avoided if the same control
measures had been implemented just one week earlier. We also examine the effects of
delays in re-implementing social distancing following a relaxation of control measures. A
longer response time results in a stronger rebound of infections and death. Our findings
underscore the importance of early intervention and aggressive response in controlling
the COVID-19 pandemic.
Main text
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused millions of infections and hundreds of
thousands of deaths worldwide8,9. In the United States, the first imported case of
COVID-19 was reported on January 20, 202010. In subsequent weeks, community
transmission of COVID-19 was established, and the causative pathogen, SARS-CoV-2,
quickly spread throughout the entire country9. As of May 14, 2020, over 1.4 million
infections and 84 thousand deaths had been confirmed nationwide11, making the US the
hardest-hit country in the world to date.
In an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19, control measures enforcing social
distancing and restricting individual contact were implemented across the US beginning
in mid-March. In other countries, these non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have
successfully controlled the spread of COVID-191-5; however, in the US, the
effectiveness of these control measures has been less pronounced. It is therefore

important that changes in virus transmissibility within the US, due to NPIs, be quantified,
so that the effects of earlier interventions on cases and deaths can be evaluated.
In this study we adapted and applied a dynamic metapopulation model informed by
human mobility data and representing SARS-CoV-2 transmission in 3142 US counties
(Methods). We explicitly simulate documented and undocumented infections13, for
which separate transmission rates, ùõΩ and ùúáùõΩ (ùúá < 1), respectively, are defined. Here ùúá
is the relative transmissibility of undocumented infections. To reflect heterogeneity in
transmission rates across the US while avoiding a large number of model parameters,
we defined a separate ùõΩ! for counties with greater than 400 cumulative confirmed cases
as of May 3, 2020 (n=311). The remaining 2831 counties were apportioned among 16
additional transmission rate parameters depending on cumulative case levels and
population density (Methods). Other parameters in the model include the ascertainment
rate, ùõº, which represents the fraction of infections documented as confirmed cases, the
average latency period, ùëç, the average duration of infection, ùê∑, and the travel
multiplicative factor, ùúÉ.
Parameter estimation was performed using the ensemble adjustment Kalman filter
(EAKF)15 in conjunction with county-level observations of both daily reported cases and
deaths in the US from February 21, 2020 to May 3, 2020 (Methods). As the model
parameters may not be as well constrained in counties with low case counts, in this
study, we focus on several metropolitan areas with large populations and abundant data
(Methods), for which parameter estimates are better informed.
Daily cases and deaths in the US and the New York metropolitan area are well fit by the
transmission model (Fig.1a-d). The inferred basic reproductive numbers, ùëÖ" ‚â° ùõΩùê∑[ùõº +
(1 ‚àí ùõº)ùúá]13,16, for six metropolitan areas ‚Äì New York, New Orleans, Los Angeles,
Chicago, Boston and Miami ‚Äì on five dates (March 15, March 29, April 12, April 26, May
3) are shown in Table 1 (Methods). After March 15, ùëÖ" in all six metropolitan areas
decreases substantially in association with the implementation of social-distancing
policies and practices. The estimated effective reproductive numbers, ùëÖ# ‚â° ùõΩùê∑[ùõº +
(1 ‚àí ùõº)ùúá]ùëÜ/ùëÅ, for these six metropolitan areas also decrease from March 15, 2020 to
May 3, 2020 (Fig. 1e). In four of the six metropolitan areas ùëÖ# is well below 1 as of May
3, 2020. For Chicago and Los Angeles, where daily confirmed cases and deaths are still
increasing or stable, ùëÖ# is close to 1 (Figs. S3-S4). In the New York metropolitan area
ùëÖ# dropped below 1 on April 8 and has continued decreasing since then. The estimated
nationwide ascertainment rate declined from 0.18 on March 15, a time of rapid COVID19 spread, and went below 0.1 on March 30 (Fig. 1f). The ascertainment rate slowly
increased after April 5. Note that this finding indicates that, prior to April 5, even though
testing capacity increased substantially, daily new infections increased faster, leading to
a declining ascertainment rate.
The inference results indicate that the NPIs varyingly adopted in the US after March 15
have effectively reduced rates of COVID-19 transmission in the focus metropolitan
areas. During the initial growth of a pandemic, infections increase exponentially. As a
consequence, early intervention and fast response are critical for limiting morbidity and

mortality. To quantify the effects of earlier interventions on COVID-19 outcomes in the
US, we performed two counterfactual simulations in which the sequence of transmission
rates and ascertainment rate inferred for March 15 ‚Äì May 3, 2020, were shifted back 1
and 2 weeks, i.e. to March 8, 2020 and March 1, 2020, respectively. Specifically, we
integrate the transmission model from February 21 to March 8 or March 1, and then
apply the daily posterior parameters, i.e., ùõº and ùõΩs, as estimated beginning March 15.
The simulations were generated until May 3, 2020. For the last 1-2 weeks without
inferred parameters due to the shift in time window, we applied the final parameter
estimates of May 3, 2020, the last day of inference.
The counterfactual simulations indicate that had observed control measures been
adopted one week earlier, the US would have avoided 645,660 (95% CI: 550,123753,230) [56.5% (48.1%-65.9%)] confirmed cases and 35,287 (28,473-41,689) [54.0%
(43.6%-63.8%)] deaths nationwide as of May 3, 2020 (Fig. 2a-b). In the New York
metropolitan area, the epicenter of COVID-19 in the US, 218,397 (195,179-229,394)
[83.3% (74.4%-87.4%)] confirmed cases and 18,543 (16,607-19,682) [85.6% (76.2%90.3%)] deaths would have been avoided if the same sequence of interventions had
been applied one week earlier (Fig. 2c-d). A more pronounced control effect would have
been achieved had the sequence of control measures occurred two weeks earlier: a
reduction of 1,017,544 (956,594-1,066,772) [89.0% (83.6%-93.3%)] cases and 58,332
(54,802-61,297) [89.3% (83.9%-93.9%)] deaths in the US (Fig. 2e-f), and 255,721
(249,316-258,817) [97.5% (95.0%-98.7%)] cases and 21,319 (20,683-21,663) [97.8%
(94.8%-99.4%)] deaths in the New York metropolitan area (Fig. 2g-h). These dramatic
reductions of morbidity and mortality due to more timely deployment of control
measures highlights the critical need for aggressive, early response to the COVID-19
pandemic.
Now that COVID-19 is established as a global pandemic, rapid response remains
essential to avoid large-scale resurgences of infections and deaths in locations with
reopening plans. We quantify the effect of response time on the timing and magnitude
of rebound in the US through further simulations. Specifically, we assume that control
measures are relaxed beginning May 4, 2020 in all US counties, resulting in an
increased hypothetical effective reproductive number of ùëÖ# = 1.5 in each county. After a
response time of 2 or 3 weeks, a reactive 25% weekly reduction of transmission rates,
equivalent to the average transmission rate reduction prior to May 4, 2020 (Fig. S5), is
imposed in each county and maintained until local weekly case numbers decline.
For both scenarios, a decline of daily confirmed cases continues for almost two weeks
after easing of control measures (Fig. 3a-b). This decreasing trend, caused by the NPIs
in place prior to May 4, 2020 coupled with the lag between infection acquisition and
case confirmation, conveys a false signal that the pandemic is well under control.
Unfortunately, due to high remaining population susceptibility, a large resurgence of
both cases and deaths follows, peaking in early- and mid-June, despite the resumption
of NPI measures 2 or 3 weeks following control relaxation. A one-week further delay to
the resumption of control measures results in an average of 32,379 additional deaths
nationally by July 1, 2020.

We note these counterfactual experiments are based on idealized hypothetical
assumptions. In practice, initiating and implementing interventions earlier during an
outbreak is complicated by factors such as general uncertainty, economic concerns,
logistics and the administrative decision process. Public compliance with social
distancing rules may also lag due to sub-optimal awareness of infection risk. We
acknowledge that our counterfactual experiments have simplified these processes;
however, we note that by the end of February, 2020, a number of other countries,
including South Korea and Italy, were already aggressively responding to the virus17.
Our findings indicate that had control measures and reductions of ùëÖ# in the US been
implemented at a similar time, just 1-2 weeks earlier, substantially fewer cases and
deaths would have occurred to date.
Our model experiments also indicate that rapid detection of increasing case numbers
and fast re-implementation of control measures is needed to control a rebound of
outbreaks of COVID-19. In these experiments, we assume the ability to re-implement a
25% weekly reduction of transmission rates nationwide. Due to fatigue in the general
public towards NPIs and a consequent reduction in compliance, this assumed reduction
may be overly optimistic.
In this study, we have quantified the sensitivity of COVID-19 cases and deaths to the
timing of control measures. Our results demonstrate the dramatic impact that earlier
interventions could have had on the COVID-19 pandemic in the US. Looking forward,
the findings underscore the need for extreme, continued vigilance when control
measures are relaxed. While we do not advocate protracted shutdowns and are
cognizant of the burdens they impose, it is vital to balance the dual ambitions of
renewing economic activity and avoiding a recrudescence.
To date countries such as South Korea, Vietnam, New Zealand and Germany, have
shown that such a balance is achievable; the strategies adopted in these countries
could be used to guide policies in the US. Specifically, broader testing and contact
tracing capacity18 are crucial to detect a rebound of COVID-19 before it is well
underway19. The continued susceptibility to infection of the majority of the US
population, including in major metropolitan areas (Fig. S6), can readily support an
exponential growth of cases and deaths. Consequently, relaxation of NPI would be
more safely effected in localities in which ùëÖ# is well below 1, daily confirmed cases are
low, and abundant testing and contact tracing are available to aid isolation and
quarantine measures.
Methods
The metapopulation model
We use a metapopulation SEIR model to simulate the transmission of COVID-19 among
3,142 US counties. In this model, we consider two types of movement: daily work
commuting and random movement. Information on county-to-county work commuting is

publicly available from the US Census Bureau12. We further assume the number of
random visitors between two counties is proportional to the average number of
commuters between them. As population present in each county is different during
daytime and nighttime, we model the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 separately
for these two time periods (see supplementary information).
We formulate the transmission as a discrete Markov process during both day and night
times. The transmission dynamics are depicted by Eqs. S1-S10 in supplementary
information. In these equations, we define ùëÜ!$ , ùê∏!$ , ùêº!$% , ùêº!$& and ùëÅ!$ as the susceptible,
exposed, reported infected, unreported infected and total population in the
subpopulation commuting from county ùëó to county ùëñ (ùëñ ‚Üê ùëó). We also introduce the
following model parameters: ùõΩ is the transmission rate of reported infections; ùúá is the
relative transmissibility of unreported infections; ùëç is the average latency period (from
infection to contagiousness); ùê∑ is the average duration of contagiousness; ùõº is the
fraction of documented infections; ùúÉ is a multiplicative factor adjusting random
movement. We integrate Eqs. S1-S10 using a Poisson process to represent the
stochasticity of the transmission process.
The transmission model generates daily confirmed cases and deaths for each county.
To map infections to deaths, we used an age-stratified infection fatality rate (IFR)20 and
computed the IFR for each county as a weighted average using demographic
information on age structure. To account for reporting delays, we mapped simulated
documented infections to confirmed cases using a separate observational delay model.
In this delay model, we account for the time interval between a person transitioning from
latent to contagious (i.e. E √† ùêº!% ) and observational confirmation of that individual
infection. To estimate this delay period, ùëá' , we examined line-list data from earlyconfirmed cases in China21. Prior to January 23, 2020, the time-to-event distribution of
the interval (in days) from symptom onset to confirmation is well fit by a Gamma
distribution (ùëé = 1.85, ùëè = 3.57). Consequently, we adopted a Gamma distribution to
model ùëá' , but tested longer mean periods (ùëéùëè), as symptom onset often lags the onset
of contagiousness, using US data prior to March 13, 202022. Our analysis indicates that
an average delay of 9 days supports better fit to the daily incidence data. As a result, we
adopted ùëá' = 9 days (ùëé = 1.85, ùëè = 4.86) in this study. Based on the daily incidence and
death data in the US, the national death curve has a 7-day lag compared with the
incidence curve (Fig. S7). As a result, we used a gamma distribution with a mean of 16
days (ùëé = 1.85, ùëè = 8.65) to represent the delay between a person transitioning from
latent to contagious and death.
In order to represent variability in transmission rates through space and time, we
introduced separate estimates for ùõΩ in the 311 US counties with cumulative cases over
400 as of May 3, 2020. The remaining counties were classified into 16 groups (evenly
distributed into a 4 by 4 grouping based on cumulative cases and population density),
for which separate transmission rates were defined. In total, 327 transmission rates (ùõΩ! )

were introduced in the transmission model. Using the next generation matrix approach,
we derived the local basic reproductive number, ùëÖ" = ùõΩùê∑[ùõº + (1 ‚àí ùõº)ùúá]16.
Data
We used the 2011-2015 5-Year ACS Commuting Flows data from US census survey to
prescribe the inter-county movement in the transmission model prior to March 15, 2020,
before broad control measures were announced. The county-to-county commuting data
is publicly available from the US Census Bureau12. We visualize the inter-county
commuting in Fig. S1. After March 15, the census survey data are no longer
representative due to changes of mobility behavior in response to control measures.
Therefore, after March 15, 2020, we use estimates of the reduction of inter-county
visitors to points of interest (POI) (e.g., restaurants, stores, etc.)23 to inform the decline
of inter-county movement on a county-by-county basis. For instance, if the number of
inter-county visitors was reduced by 30% in a county on a given day relative to baseline
estimates on March 1, 2020, the size of subpopulations traveling to this county would be
reduced by 30% accordingly. This real-time mobility data are available between March
1, 2020 and May 2, 2020. For dates beyond May 2, 2020, we maintained the last known
level of inter-county movement. We present the evolution of the inter-county mobility
index (i.e., the remaining fraction of inter-county visitor numbers relative to the baseline)
in the six examined metropolitan areas from March 1 to April 18 in Fig. S2.
County-level daily confirmed cases and deaths were compiled by USAFACTS11. Daily
cases and deaths in the six metropolitan areas are shown in Figs. S3-S4. At the
national scale, we observed a 7-day lag between the reported case and death counts
(Fig. S7).
Model calibration
To derive an estimate of model parameters, we calibrated the transmission model
against county-level incidence and death data reported from February 21, 2020 through
May 3, 2020. Specifically, we estimated model parameters using a sequential data
assimilation technique. The metapopulation model is a high-dimensional system with
60,232 subpopulations. We therefore applied an efficient data assimilation algorithm ‚Äì
the Ensemble Adjustment Kalman Filter (EAKF)15, which is applicable to high
dimensional model structures, to infer model parameters. The EAKF has been
successfully used to infer parameters for seasonal and pandemic influenza24 as well as
other infectious diseases25-27.
To improve the identifiability of this high-dimensional model, we further reduced the
number of unknown parameters by fixing disease-related parameters (ùëç, ùê∑ and ùúá) and
the mobility factor (ùúÉ). These parameters were estimated using the posterior
distributions inferred from case data through March 13, 202022. Specifically, we
randomly drew these parameters from the posterior ensemble members: ùëç = 3.59 (95%
CI: 3.28-3.99), ùê∑ = 3.56 (3.21-3.83), ùúá = 0.64 (0.56-0.70), and ùúÉ = 0.15 (0.12-0.17).

From February 21, 2020 through May 3, 2020, we performed EAKF inference each day
using both case and death data to estimate the ascertainment rate ùõº and transmission
rates ùõΩ! . The prior for the ascertainment rate was drawn from a distribution with a
median value ùõº = 0.080 (95% CI: 0.069-0.093), estimated in a previous study22. The
prior transmission rates were scaled based on local population density using the
".)√ó+,-!" (/0# )
following relation: ùõΩ! = 2#'!34(+,√ó ùõΩ. Here ùëÉùê∑! is the population density in county
(/0))
!"

ùëñ, ùëöùëíùëëùëñùëéùëõ(log5" (ùëÉùê∑)) is the median value of log-transformed population density among
all counties, and ùõΩ is the transmission rate estimated before March 13, 2020 (ùõΩ = 0.95,
95% CI: 0.84-1.06)22. For ùõΩ shared by multiple counties, population density ùëÉùê∑! is
averaged over those counties. To account for reporting delays of confirmed cases and
deaths, at each daily model update, we integrated the model forward for 16 days using
the prior model state, and used incidence number 9 days ahead and death number 16
days ahead to constrain current model variables and parameters. Given the large
number of parameters in the model, the inference system may not be fully identifiable.
To alleviate this issue, we imposed a ¬±30% limit on the daily change of parameters ùõº
and ùõΩ! . This smoothing constraint is reasonable considering the continuity of human‚Äôs
behavioral change.
In total, we performed 40 independent inference runs. The inference results reported in
Fig. 1 were obtained from all posterior ensemble members. Implementation details and
system initialization are reported in the supplementary information.
Metropolitan areas

In this study, we focus on the transmission dynamics in metropolitan areas with dense
populations and abundant observations. In particular, we presented parameter
estimates for in six metropolitan areas: New York, New Orleans, Los Angeles, Chicago,
Boston and Miami. Lists of counties in these metropolitan areas are provided in the
supplementary information.

Supplementary Information
Transmission model
We formulate the transmission as a discrete Markov process during both day and night.
Daytime transmission lasts for ùëëùë°! days and the nighttime transmission ùëëùë°" days (ùëëùë°! +
ùëëùë°" = 1). Here, we assume daytime transmission lasts for 8 hours and nighttime
transmission lasts for 16 hours, i.e., ùëëùë°! = 1/3 day and ùëëùë°" = 2/3 day. The transmission
dynamics are depicted by the following equations.

The Ensemble Adjustment Kalman Filter
Originally developed for use in weather prediction, the ensemble adjustment Kalman
filter (EAKF) assumes a Gaussian distribution of both the prior and likelihood and
adjusts the prior distribution to a posterior using Bayes‚Äô rule deterministically. To
represent the state-space distribution, the EAKF maintains an ensemble of system state
vectors acting as samples from the distribution. In particular, the EAKF assumes that
both the prior distribution and likelihood are Gaussian, and thus can be fully
characterized by their first two moments (mean and variance). The update scheme for
ensemble members is computed using Bayes‚Äô rule (posterior ‚àù prior √ó likelihood) via
the convolution of the two Gaussian distributions. For observed state variables, the
posterior of the ùëñth ensemble member is updated through

covariance between the prior of the unobserved variable or parameter Pùë•,,.&#/& Q2 and
the prior of the observed variable Pùëú,,.&#/& Q2 at time ùë°. In the EAKF, variables and
parameters are updated deterministically such that the higher moments of the prior
distribution are preserved in the posterior.

To account for the reporting delay of confirmed case and death, we modified the original
EAKF implementation by adjusting model states using observations in the near future,
when the effects of parameter change are manifested in observations. Specifically, for
data assimilation at day ùë°, we ran the transmission model forward to day ùë° + 16 using
prior model state, and used the confirmed case at day ùë° + 9 and death at day ùë° + 16 to
update model variables and parameters at day ùë°. This look-ahead data assimilation
considered an average delay of 9 days for infection confirmation and an average delay
of 16 days for death reporting.
"
In the EAKF, we assume a heuristic form of observation error variance (OEV) ùúé,,/10
. For
"
"
confirmed cases, we used ùúé,,3405 = max (100, ùë¶(ùëêùëéùë†ùëí), /100), where ùë¶(ùëêùëéùë†ùëí), is the
number of new confirmed cases averaged over day ùë° ‚àí 6 to day ùë°; for death, we used
"
ùúé,,654,7
= max (25, ùë¶(ùëëùëíùëéùë°‚Ñé)", /100), where ùë¶(ùëëùëíùëéùë°‚Ñé), is the number of deaths averaged
over day ùë° ‚àí 6 to day ùë°. Similar forms of OEV have been successfully used for inference
and forecasting for a range of infectious diseases. In this study, this OEV setting yields
satisfactory fitting.

System initialization
The prior ranges of model parameters ùõº and ùõΩ were set as ùõº ‚àà [0.03, 0.25] and ùõΩ ‚àà
[0.01,2.5]. To initialize the model, we seeded exposed individuals (ùê∏) and unreported
infections (ùêº ( ) in counties with at least one confirmed case before March 14, 2020.
Unlike the situation in China, where the outbreak originated from a single city,
importation to multiple locations in the US probably initiated community transmission. To
reflect this potential ongoing community transmission before the reporting of the first
local infection, for each county with confirmed cases before March 14, we randomly
drew ùê∏ and ùêº ( from uniform distributions [0, 18ùê∂] and [0, 20ùê∂] 9 days prior to the

reporting date (ùëá8 ) of the first case. Here ùê∂ is the total number of reported cases
between day ùëá8 and ùëá8 + 4.
The rationale for this seeding strategy is as follows. If an average reporting delay of 9
9
9
days is assumed, we can estimate ùêº & on day ùëá8 ‚àí 9 as : √ó ùê∑, where : is the average
number of daily cases during the first five days with reported cases (ùëá8 to ùëá8 + 4). If we
use the upper bound of 5 days for D, ùêº & is estimated as ùê∂, which is also an upper
bound. We assume the mean ùêº ( on day ùëá8 ‚àí 9 is 9ùê∂, implying a reporting rate of
1/10=10%. Drawing ùêº ( from [0, 18ùê∂] leads to a broader prior range of the reporting rate.
As both ùêº & and ùêº ( were evolved from the exposed population ùê∏, we draw ùê∏ from the
range [0, 20ùê∂]. This crude calculation provides a seeding range for US counties. During
inference, this seeding can be adjusted up or down by the filter. The posterior model
fittings capture observed outcomes well.
Counties in six metropolitan areas
We examined counties in six metropolitan areas with cumulative cases over 400 as of
May 3, 2020. These counties are:

Figure S5. The reduction of transmission rates in counties with increasing confirmed
cases. We selected segments of increasing cases for counties with a maximum daily
case level above 200 (right panel), and inspected the estimated transmission rates in
those counties during the same period (left panel). The average weekly reduction of
transmission rate is 25% in those counties with increasing confirmed cases.
