Mathematical modeling suggests pre-existing immunity to
SARS-CoV-2.
Marcus Carlsson, Gad Hatem, Cecilia Söderberg-Nauclér
Abstract
Mathematical models have largely failed to predict the unfolding of the COVID-19 pandemic. We revisit several
variants of the SEIR-model and investigate various adjustments to the model in order to achieve output consistent with
measured data in Manaus, India and Stockholm. In particular, Stockholm is interesting due to the almost constant NPI’s,
which substantially simplifies the mathematical modeling. Analyzing mobility data for Stockholm, we argue that neither
behavioral changes, age and activity stratification nor NPI’s alone are sufficient to explain the observed pandemic progression. We find that the most plausible hypothesis is that a large portion of the population, between 40 to 65 percent,
have some protection against infection with the original variant of SARS-CoV-2.

Why do SEIR-models fail, or do they?

For most countries or regions, when observing the time series of new cases, hospitalizations or deaths by COVID-19, it
is clear that they go up and down in a manner that can only be explained by Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (such as
lock-downs, school closures etc.), seasonal and behavioral changes. However, in a few places where the spread got out
of control, such as Manaus and New York, the curves look very much like the “wave of infections” predicted by standard
mathematical models for infectious diseases, called SEIR. In particular this applies to Stockholm where the authorities
have been unwilling to enforce any major NPI’s, and the recommendations (as well as other key parameters such as
season) have been virtually constant, especially during the second wave.
Despite this, the measured sero-prevalence in all to us known locations (also towns such as Bergamo [49]) is well
below the mathematically predicted herd-immunity threshold, which is estimated to somewhere above 70%. Manaus
reached a maximum sero-prevalence of 52% in June that waned to below 30% by October [13], yet despite the society
being relatively open it was not hit by a second wave until late December, most likely caused by a mutant virus variation
[4]. The sero-prevalence in New York after the first wave was 23% [6] and a recent measurement from Stockholm indicates
that 22% of the population have had the virus, past the second wave and one year into the pandemic.
Is it possible that this discrepancy between the SEIR model and reality is only due to variations in the effective R-value
caused by changing NPI’s, or is the SEIR-model simply inapt for modeling COVID-19? Or could we refine the SEIRmodel to give more realistic output? Or could it be that the parameters we feed the model are wrong? This is the question
we tackle in this paper, whose supplementary material contains a thorough revision of heterogeneous SEIR models and
their parameters.
We argue that the first three explanations are less credible, and then revisit the idea of a pre-existing protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2, or pre-immunity for short. We do not address the nature of this protection, which either can stem
from pre-existing cross-reactive adaptive immunity or different degrees of innate immunity, but we mention the publications [16, 40] showing different mechanisms where prior exposure to other viruses can prevent infection by SARS-CoV-2.
We show that upon taking pre-immunity into account, it is possible to accurately model both the first and second wave of
COVID-19 in Manaus and Stockholm. This is by no means a proof that pre-immunity does exist, but it is our hope that
this work can help improve the understanding of this new virus and stimulate medical research aiming to further explore
potential causes for pre-immunity.

A close look at the SEIR-setup

The mathematical models recommended for respiratory diseases like influenza are (refinements of) a basic ordinary differential equation commonly known as SEIR, (see e.g. Ch. 4 and 9, [10]). While these deterministic models do not capture
the random nature of real life, it has been shown that more advanced stochastic models behave like these deterministic
models when there is a major outbreak in a large population (see e.g. [3] Ch. 5.5 and [7]).

Figure 1: Left: SEIR outcome with R0 = 2. Right: New infections ν.
In the acronym SEIR, S = S(t) stands for the amount of susceptible at time t in a population of N individuals,
and s(t) is the corresponding fraction of the population in group S, so s(t) = S(t)/N equals 1 at the beginning of the
pandemic (unless there is pre-existing immunity, easily included by simply choosing an initial value less than one). E(t)
stands for exposed, to account for the incubation time. I(t) stands for infectious, after which people recover and “appear”
in R(t) instead. Like s, the letters e, i, r will denote the respective fractions of the population, so if i(t) = 0.02 it means
that 2% of the population is infective on the particular day t. The majority of individuals will thus start in s and end in
r, but not all. The final value of r is called the final size of the epidemic, usually a bit higher than the herd-immunity
threshold because the r-curve overshoots due to the momentum it gets from having a large fraction in i at the same
time. The equation system depends on a few additional parameters, most notably the R0 value that determines the speed
of transmission, but also the mean incubation time Tincubation and the mean infectious period Tinf ectious , explained in
depth in the Supplementary Material (SM), Section 5 and 5.1.
An important issue to stress is the difference between the curve i, which models all infectives at a given moment t,
and the fraction of new infections on a given day, which equals ν(t) := s(t − 1) − s(t). These two are often confused
and the latter curve is usually much smaller than the former (since people remain infective for some days but only become
infected once). Measured curves for new infections based on PCR-test will scale linearly (due to insufficient testing) with
ν (after shifting to account for Tincubation ), not with i.

2.1 Discrepancies between model and reality
Simple models such as SEIR rely on gross simplification of human life, but these may still be useful if their main characteristics correlate acceptably well with reality. By main characteristics we mean quantities such as the time Twave it
takes for the outbreak to pass, roughly 70 days in Figure 1, which is roughly the time observed in Manaus. Another key
quantity is the final size of the epidemic i.e. the fraction of people who at some point had COVID-19, which we define
as C19tot = 100r(Twave ). In Figure 1, C19tot is close to 80% and in the right graph we see that a whopping 2.5%
will fall ill on the same day! To our knowledge this behavior is not near reality in any hard hit location of the planet
(including naval ships and prisons), and yet, this is what many qualified experts and proponents of the mitigation-strategy
had predicted would happen in early 2020 (see e.g. [24]). So why does the model fail so drastically?
One answer could of course lay in the (overly simplistic) setup of the equation system, as argued e.g. in [14]. We review
the setup of basic SEIR in the Supplementary Material (Sections 5-5.1) with the aim of tuning the model to COVID-19. In
short summary; on one hand there is a big gap between the SEIR-model and reality, and parameter choices are somewhat
ad hoc. On the other hand, the model is fairly robust and different parameter choices do not affect the overall outcome
drastically. Moreover, more accurate equation systems that also take the age of infection into account give almost identical
output as the SEIR-equation system (see in particular the blue vs. the yellow curve in SM Figure 9), and hence it seems
that these shortcomings can not explain the discrepancy between SEIR-based predictions and observations.
It is important to realize that in theory, these models are valid also under NPI’s, as long as these are held constant, as
then there will be an artificial fixed R0 value that is adjusted for the corresponding NPI’s, which we denote by R0N P I .
So lets try to lower R0N P I so that C19tot ≈ 52% to match the observed data from Manaus [13]; R0N P I = 1.4 does the

Figure 2: Left: SEIR outcome with R0 = 1.4. Right: New infections.
job, see Figure 2. However, now the wave is expected to be around 150 days, twice the time suggested by real data. The
Manaus curve is strikingly similar (in shape and duration) to the one for New York, which landed at C19tot = 23% [6]
as well as the one for Stockholm (that did not go into lock down) and measured a sero-prevalence of C19tot = 12% in
June [21]. With SEIR-modeling these outbreaks should have taken 1 and 2.5 years respectively, and is hence not realistic.
This behavior is easy to understand on an intuitive level; in order for the final size of the epidemic to be small the R0N P I
must be near one and then the virus spread becomes unrealistically slow. Thus, the problem with SEIR-models is that at
least one of the key output-parameters Twave and C19tot will be totally at odds with reality. In other words, no matter
how you tune the input parameters, the model generates curves which either miscalculates the pace or the magnitude of
the epidemic outbreak.

2.2 Possible explanations
A quick fix to the above dilemma is to include pre-immunity. In the SM Section 5.2 we show that for every solution to the
SEIR equation system in the absence of pre-immunity, one can obtain a solution with a level θ of pre-immunity simply by
multiplying the solution by the constant factor (1 − θ) and adjusting R0 accordingly. In other words, if we have found a
solution which fits a given time-series well except for the magnitude, we may simply rescale it. To be concrete, if a model
has a suitable shape and predicts Twave correctly, but gives C19tot = 90% whereas measured sero-prevalence indicates
52% [13], this could indicate that 42% are actually immune to infection, since 52 ≈ (1 − 0.42) · 90. We investigate this
possibility in Section 3, but first we will discuss other potential explanations.
It can be argued that the type of stochastic models mentioned above are not apt for modeling of SARS-CoV-2, which
indeed is a peculiar virus that spreads in clusters, and it is estimated that 80% of the cases are caused by less than 20% of
infected individuals, the so called ”super spreaders” [1, 19]. In Section 7.3 we show that, rather surprisingly, adding this
complexity to the deterministic SEIR-model does not in any way alter the output. This is no longer true if randomness
is taken into account; in [23] a stochastic SEIR-model where R0 is a random variable (for each infected individual) with
a “fat-tailed” distribution, and while this displays an erratic and possibly more realistic behavior, its effect on Twave and
C19tot still does not seem to overcome the shortcomings discussed above (see in particular Figure 4 in [23]).
It has been argued that population heterogeneity may explain the gap between model and observation, see e.g. [12]
and [50]. In Section 6 we take a closer look at these and show that while heterogeneity certainly plays an important role
for more accurate modeling, it is unlikely to be the main explanation of the discrepancy. More precisely, when applied to
the data series from Stockholm, the models are in both cases off by a factor of at least 3. To illustrate this, in Figure we
see the second wave in Stockholm (blue) along with two attempts to model it using the code by [12] (that was published in
Science, red and yellow curves chosen to match C19tot and Twave respectively). The green and purple use similar codes
but include pre-immunity, the details of which will be further explained in Section 3.
The remaining explanation that avoids pre-immunity is that fluctuations in the effective R-value, denoted Re , due
to NPI’s and/or behavioral changes completely controls the way the cases evolve with time, rendering the SEIR-model
useless. Yet, the NPI’s in Sweden have remained virtually unchanged and SEIR-models are not anywhere near being able
to match the development in Sweden (as seen in Figure 3, yellow and red curve) so if this is true it must be caused by

public awareness and voluntary behavioral changes by the population. In the coming section we take a closer look at this
potential explanation.

2.3 The case of Stockholm, Sweden
The second wave hit Sweden much later than many other countries, leading to wide speculation that the “Swedish strategy”
had been successful. We now know it did not give us advantages for the second wave, as the Swedish Health authority
had predicted. A recent study estimates that the strategy lead to between 26 to 82% unnecessary deaths and no notable
improvement for other factors, such as the economy [9].
We focus our analysis on the metropolitan area of Stockholm with 2.4 million inhabitants, which has been hit by 3 distinct waves, spring and autumn 2020 and now a third wave driven by the British mutation B.1.1.7 is estimated to soon reach
its
peak.
In
June 2020, 12% were estimated to have been infected in
Stockholm, yet the decline of the spread started in early
April, a month after onset of the first wave, even though
the mitigation strategies were very limited and not well
followed by the Swedes. From mid March, high schools
and universities were on distance learning, people were expected to work from home and if possible avoid public
transportation. Frequent washing of hands, keeping distance of 1.5-2 m, and staying at home if feeling sick, were
the main recommendations given to the public from the
health authorities and the government. A lock-down was
never implemented, family members of confirmed cases
were expected to work, grade 1-9 schools remained open
and face masks were not recommended. It seemed odd
that the soft interventions could have this effect unless the
population was protected by some degree of pre-existing
immunity. Nevertheless, it is of course possible that these
interventions along with public awareness and arrival of
spring was enough to keep Re below one from early April
and onwards.
Figure 4: Google Community Mobility Reports
The same argument is however harder to accept considering the second wave (seen in Figure 3, blue curve, left as well as right). The recommendations from the government
were the same as described for the first wave and public compliance limited; there were frequent reports of full shopping

malls and crowded transit stations, very few people wearing masks and the weather getting colder, driving people indoors.
As is clear to see in Figure 3, the spread started to dampen in late October and peaked in late November, yet the only
noteworthy change in recommendations occurred on December 7 when high schools went online. Thus it is unlikely NPI’s
which makes the steep rise in October to level out and then recede. It is important to realize that in the absence of the
British mutation B.1.1.7 the epidemic in Stockholm would most likely have remained calm up until present at least, see
the red dashed curve in Figure 3, right. This indicates that a temporary herd-immunity level had been reached (similar to
Manaus between its first and second wave) unless, again, it is voluntary changes in behavior that explains why the second
wave came to a premature halt.
To investigate this possible explanation we display mobility data for Stockholm obtained from Google Community
Mobility Reports, seen in Fig. 4. Clearly there is a decline in activity from around 5% (Grocery and Pharmacy), 15%
(Workplaces) to 35% (Transit stations) between October and November/early December, but it is hard to imagine that
this has the capacity of reducing the Re -value to below 1 (from values around 1.5 during October). Notably, the autumn
holidays in the end of October as well as Christmas holidays end of December (that in Sweden comes close to a lockdown) have no clear bearing on the development, indicating that behavioral changes are not the main factor for the apparent
changes in Re . In summary, if SEIR-models have any validity at all in describing the spread of SARS-CoV-2, we find that
it is very hard to explain the second wave in Stockholm without taking pre-existing immunity into account.
Similar observations are also reported from Lombardy, Italy [52]. The authors write “ It appears that a comparatively
high cumulative incidence of infection, even if far below theoretical thresholds required for herd immunity, may provide
noticeable protection during the second wave” and then argue that these observations can not be attributed to neither NPI’s
nor behavioral or environmental variations alone.

SEIR-modeling with pre-immunity

Several scientists have proposed that a level of pre-immunity within the population could partially explain the unexpected
behavior of the SARS-CoV-2 virus spread in society [22, 33, 37], but without providing a thorough mathematical analysis.
Similar arguments have also been put forth by Doshi [17] as well as by Sette and Crotty [48], see SM Section 5.2 for a
longer discussion. If a pre-existing immunity of substantial relevance would exist, it would significantly affect the model,
but in this article we do not speculate in the nature of the pre-immunity, we just provide mathematical support for its
existence.

3.1 Incorporating pre-immunity into the SEIR model
The simplest way to incorporate pre-existing immunity in the mathematical model is to select an immunity level of Θ%
and set sinitial = 1 − Θ/100, where sinitial is the initial fraction of susceptible individuals in the population, (see SM
Section 5.2 for details). The only assumption needed for the SEIR-model to work in theory, is that the NPI’s and public
behavior remain rather constant during the elapse of the wave, and that seasonal factors have no major impact on the basic
reproduction number; R0N P I . We recall that R0N P I denotes the amount of people one infected individual transmits the
disease to, at the onset of the epidemic with NPI’s in place, and assuming that everyone else is susceptible, i.e. s(t) ≈ 1.
Under the above assumptions it follows that the effective R-value at time t depends only on S(t) via the simple formula
Re (t) = R0N P I s(t).
R0N P I (1

(1)

In particular, note that Re (0) =
− Θ/100) where Re (0) represents the “R0 ”-value that initially was estimated
in the range 2-3, so this formula entails that these estimates of “R0 ” must be adjusted upwards, as a pre-immunity would
directly affect the R0 -value. For example, a pre-immunity of 50% would put the above estimates for R0N P I in the range
4-6.
A more refined way to introduce pre-immunity is by including variable susceptibility, since “being immune” is not a
binary variable. On the contrary, neither cross-reactive adaptive nor innate immunity is likely to hinder infection when
exposure to the virus is high. We describe the mathematical details in Section 7.8. In particular, we show in Section 7.9
that there is only a slight difference between modeling variable activity levels and variable susceptibility, so in practice it
may be hard to distinguish one of these explanations from the other.
To exemplify this, in Figure 5 we plot the output of the basic homogenous SEIR-model (with pre-immunity Θ = 35%),
the age-stratified model by Britton et al. (with pre-immunity Θ = 25%), the age-activity stratified model (again by Britton
et al., now with Θ = 0% and “activity parameter” η = 2, see Section 6.1 or 7.9 for more details), and finally a more
advanced age-susceptible stratified model where 25% of the population has no protection at all against the virus, whereas
the remaining 75% with pre-existing immunity are divided into three groups and given various levels of protection.

As is plain to see, given any of the above SEIR-models
it is possible to chose parameters in any of the other models to get almost identical output. From this we can draw
a number of interesting conclusions:
1. It is impossible within this mathematical framework
to draw any certain conclusions about the nature of the
pandemic, since different real world phenomena have an
almost identical effect on the curves. However, this conclusion only holds within a certain parameter interval; as
we saw in Figure 3 it is impossible to model the development in Stockholm with the age-activity stratified model
and no pre-existing immunity, without choosing absurd
values for the parameter η regulating activity variation.
This is further elaborated in SM Section 6.1.
2. Immunity is rarely either 100% or 0%, whether a
person gets infected will depend on the dose of infectious
virus attacking a person with different protective antibody
and T-cell immunity levels. Despite this, a more refined
model taking various levels of immunity into account, and
a simpler model treating the biological reality as binary,
give the same output. Hence, if one is careful with the
interpretation of Θ as the amount of “immune”, it is perfectly fine from a mathematical viewpoint to replace the
more advanced age-susceptibility stratified model with a
more simple one.

Figure 5: Blue: Standard SEIR (2) with R0 = 3.1 and preimmunity level Θ = 35%. Green: Age-stratified SEIR with
R0 = 2.7 and Θ = 25%. Black: Age-activity model with
“activity difference factor η = 2”, R0 = 2 and Θ = 0. Red:
Age-susceptible stratified SEIR with R0 = 6.

3.2 Modeling examples with pre-immunity
We exemplify by applying the model to the situations in
Manaus, India (first wave) and Stockholm (second wave), and we satisfy with modeling pre-immunity using the simpler
approach with a “binary” parameter Θ for the percentage of pre-immune (using the age-activity stratified model does not
lead to drastically different conclusions). In SM Section 6.1 we show that the age-activity stratified model by Britton et
al. is not realistic1 , especially for modeling poorer places like Manaus and India.
We will first focus on Manaus, since this is an example of a relatively unmitigated spread that is believed to have
reached saturation without seasonal interference. In Figure 6 we display the result using pre-existing immunity level
Θ = 42%. The output overlaps surprisingly well with observed data, the shape and Twave are reasonable and C19tot
becomes 44%, which is what was measured in [13]. For this to occur we chose R0N P I = 3.45, which corresponds to an
“observed” R0 -value of Re (0) = 2, via formula (1). The age-distribution has been adjusted for Brazil, as explained in
Section 7.1.2
We then ran the same model for the country of India, again setting Θ = 42% but now choosing a lower value for
R0N P I = 2.21 in order to get C19tot = 21.4, which was the national seroprevalence as estimated in the end of February
by ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research). That R0N P I vary between countries could have a number of explanations,
but it is very interesting that the same level of pre-immunity Θ as Manaus gives a perfect data-fit. India is currently seeing
a substantial second wave, which recent data indicates is due to a mutant virus variation.
Before proceeding, we would like to stress that this research is in no way meant to support mitigation strategies to
control the pandemic, since the examples set by e.g. Sweden and Brazil clearly shows that this has led to substantial amount
of human suffering and unnecessary loss of life [9]. Moreover the tragic second wave hitting Manaus shows with all clarity
that this is not a path to be considered; even if Manaus had “herd-immunity” for some time, the recent surge is probably
related to both mutations and loss of immunity [46], and both issues speak firmly for relying on suppression/vaccination
strategies [4]. On the other hand, if some degree of pre-existing immunity is present in the world’s population, we believe
that this is an important fact that can be used for better prediction of the pandemic and understanding of the virus.
1 at

least not with activity level parameter η = 2, and for reasonable values of η the difference with only age-stratification becomes negligible
now on we use the measured data values and not age-sex reweighted. Whether we pick C19tot = 44% or 52% has no bearing on the major
conclusions, using 52% gives R0N P I = 3.0 and Θ = 33%

Figure 6: Left: Age-stratified SEIR with R0N P I = 3.45 and pre-immunity 42%. For this choice C19tot equals 44% and
“the apparent R0 -value” Re (0) is 2.0. y-axis have been scaled to fit curve of deaths in Manaus.
Right: Same model run for India with pre-immunity 42% (again). We set R0N P I = 2.21 in order to achieve C19tot =
21.4%. y-axis have been re-scaled.
In fact, the new waves caused by the mutations are commonly explained by attributing to them a higher R−value, but
the hypothesis of a pre-existing immunity offers an alternative interpretation. If there was a pre-existing immunity caused
by cross-reactivity with other viruses, which according to the above modeling could have protected around 40 percent of
the population, then any mutation which is able to get past this pre-immunity will seem like it has a higher R, when in
fact it simply has a larger pool of people it can infect.

3.3 Stockholm, second wave
We now describe in further detail our in depth study of Stockholm from Section 2.3. In June, Stockholm was estimated
to have around 12% sero-prevalence [21]. Note that the recent study [15] shows a moderate decline of antibodies to
SARS-CoV-2, and also the study [27] has established that prior infection results in 80% protection against reinfection,
which did not seem to wane over time. Therefore we have not included loss of immunity over time in our models, which
typically model a couple of months at the time. Instead, it is important to have a measurement of the immunity level at the
onset of the wave to be modeled. Our own measurement of the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among 300 blood donors
in September gave 13%, which thus correlate well with the 12% measured in June [21].
The Swedish second wave is a good option for mathematical modeling, as public recommendations have remained
rather constant except for the closing of high-schools on December 7. The sero-prevalence in Stockholm has now risen to
21.5%, which we base on a recent study of 450 blood donors sampled 22 Feb-7 March 2021. Due to the relatively small
number of donors the figure is uncertain, so we also consider death data. Stockholm had 2400 deaths in the first wave and
1500 in the second wave. If we assume constant IFR and extrapolate from 12% seroprevalence corresponding to 2400
deaths, then the increase in sero-prevalence in the second wave should be at least 12 ∗ 1500/2400 = 7.5%. Finally, an
independent study [43] concluded that 17% of Stockholm blood donors were seropositive in the midst of the second wave,
which is also in line with an 8.5% increase.
We tried to find parameters that would fit the shape of the time-series of cases in stockholm during the second wave
(blue curve, Figure 3) while matching a final size of the epidemic of 8.5%. In short conclusion, it is impossible to match
this data with any SEIR-model not incorporating levels of pre-existing immunity above 50% and R0N P I −values above
4. In order to get a good fit with the age-activity stratified SEIR [12], we had to choose the activity parameter η = 100,
which is absurd. Or rather, in practice this means that the spread only takes place among the 25% “highly active”, and
hence this is the same as assuming that 75% are either pre-immune or isolating, see SM Section 7.9.
We display a few of these tests in Figure 3. The dark blue curve is the 7 day average of actual measured cases in
Stockholm for the period 1 Sept. 2020 to 28 Jan. 2021 (so 1/9 displays the average of 1-7/9). Here, we do not re-scale
the y-axis as in the previous modeling examples, and hence the dark blue is expected to be lower than modeled data
due to underreporting. The light blue curve is the cases re-scaled so that it integrates to 8.5% infected during the given

time-period.
We first ran Britton et al’s Age-Activity stratified SEIR model with pre-existing immunity to 13%, corresponding to
pre-pandemic immunity of 0%. In order to get 8.5% as the “final size of the second wave”, we needed to pick R0N P I =
1.27, the result is seen in red. In order to get a realistic value for Twave we need to pick R0N P I = 2.5, leading to the
yellow curve and a final size of the second wave of 54%. Looking at the corresponding curves, it is apparent that both
alternatives are completely off.
Next we tried to find values of R0N P I and Θ that would match 8.5% as the final size of the second wave, using the
simpler Age-Stratified SEIR. The choice Θ = 78% and R0N P I = 6.3 gives a perfect fit. If again we incorporate the
various activity levels by Britton et al. (η = 2), then these values drop further to Θ = 70% and R0N P I = 4.6. The ageactivity model is more realistic in the Swedish scenario than Manaus/India, due to the social well-fare state and extensive
IT-infrastructure, combined with many single households and online based jobs, which makes it easier for large portions of
the population to self-isolate to various degrees. For this reason we ran both models for Stockholm, and so combined this
gives evidence for a pre-existing immunity in the range 70-78%. Since this is the second wave, the values of pre-existing
immunity also includes the 13% acquired during the first wave, so a value of e.g. Θ = 78% corresponds to pre(pandemic)existing immunity of 65%. Moreover, it is believed that a good portion of the 15% that are above 70 are self-isolating
(which is much easier to achieve in Sweden than India or Manaus, due to the structure of society and pension-systems),
so the above 65% could in practice be 55%. Another source of potential error is that we have not corrected the value 8.5%
for false negatives. However, this will not alter the magnitude of the numbers reported above. In summary, it is impossible
to give firm predictions on what was the effective level of prepandemic-immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in Stockholm, but the
above analysis gives support for the hypothesis that this value is somewhere between 45 and 65%, irrespective of which
model/measurement one relies on.

3.4 The Gompertz curve and stability of estimates
In this section we briefly discuss if the heterogeneous model can be further tuned to more accurately fit observed data,
and test if such refinements could alter the above conclusions. The first waves in a number of places had the shape of
a “Gompertz”-curve (characterized by a sharp rise and a slow decline). In the supplementary material, we propose a
socio-economic stratified SEIR model to explain this. The idea is simple, if you have a rich part of town and a poorer
part of town, then the R0N P I -value is likely to be higher in the former and lower in the latter. Once you add up the
curves, the result looks like a Gompertz-function, as shown in Figure 7 (left). We also managed to fit Manaus almost
perfectly by setting R0N P I = 4.2 and pre-existing immunity Θ = 43% (Figure 7, middle), again abiding by the restriction
C19tot = 44% as measured in [13]. This should be compared with Θ = 42% and R0N P I = 3.45 used in Figure 6. It is
remarkable that, despite variations in the model, key behavior is surprisingly consistent, and we have not been able to get
a similar fit with any reasonable model and Θ = 0%, indicating a certain robustness to choice of model.
The same comment goes for Stockholm, to the right in Figure 7 we see the second wave in stockholm not including
B.1.1.7, (compare Fig. 3). We modified the Socio-economic age-activity SEIR-model a bit further to take into account
that the 70+ group is to a large extent self-isolating, and that social mixing in between age-groups certainly is reduced
during the pandemic. The outcome is seen in black, using pre-immunity 62% and R0N P I = 4.3, not too far off from the
corresponding values used for Manaus. In summary, we see that more advanced models can yield even better accuracy,
but the values of R0N P I and Θ remain of the same magnitude. In particular, it is still impossible to get near observed

data with Θ = 0, and this gives mathematical support to the hypothesis that a certain level of pre-existing immunity was
present before the arrival of SARS-CoV-2.

Conclusion

We undertook a major evaluation of different SEIR-models taking factors such as age, activity level, susceptibility variation, socio-economic level and pre-existing immunity into account. We tested these models against data acquired from
Manaus, India and Stockholm, and found that a simple age-stratified SEIR-model with pre-immunity in the range 4065% gave good fit with observed data, which is impossible to attain in the absence of pre-immunity, as the other factors
can not affect the model sufficiently. We also analyzed a number of potential alternative explanations and found that
they did not seem backed up by data, so we argue that if SEIR-models are at all useful for modeling COVID-19, then
pre-existing immunity is a plausible explanation to the unexpected development of the pandemic that should encourage
further investigation in order to reveal its nature.
