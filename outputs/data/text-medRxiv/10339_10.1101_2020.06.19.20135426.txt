Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has affected billions of people around the world not only through the infection
itself but also through its wider impact on public health and daily life. To assess the effects of the
pandemic, a team of researchers across a wide range of disciplines developed and implemented the
Lifelines COVID-19 questionnaire, leading to the development of the Lifelines COVID-19 cohort. This
cohort is recruited from participants of the Lifelines prospective population cohort and the Lifelines NEXT
birth cohort, and participants were asked to fill out detailed questionnaires about their physical and
mental health and experiences on a weekly basis starting in late March of 2020 and on a bi-weekly basis
staring in June 2020. The Lifelines region covers the three Northern provinces of the Netherlands—
Drenthe, Groningen and Friesland—which together account for ~10% of the Dutch population. To date,
>70,000 people have responded to the questionnaires at least once, and the questionnaire program is
still ongoing. Data collected by the questionnaires will be used to address four aspects of the outbreak:
(1) how the COVID-19 pandemic developed in the three northern provinces of the Netherlands, (2) which
environmental risk factors predict disease susceptibility and severity, (3) which genetic risk factors
predict disease susceptibility and severity and (4) what are the psychological and societal impacts of the
crisis.

Introduction
COVID-19—the disease caused by infection with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2—has impacted the
lives and health of billions of people around the world. Due to the absence of a vaccine, lack of effective
antiviral medication and limited understanding of the virus itself, massive efforts have been undertaken
by most governments to slow the growth rate of infections through public health measures that have
included tracking and testing, shutting down of public life, social distancing policies and stay-at-home
orders. These steps have had a huge impact on public well-being, health, the economy (including
employment and working conditions) and daily life. The COVID-19 pandemic thus has the potential to
exacerbate health and economic inequalities because the concentration of health and labour market
disadvantages will be among vulnerable people, such as those with chronic diseases and/or mental
health problems. Psychological distress about the pandemic may also have an impact on mental health,
as will social isolation. For youth, the disease risks due to COVID-19 are thought to be small, but the
mental health effects of the threat of the pandemic and the associated measures such as school closures
may be considerable. The pandemic may also result in unemployment, which could widen socioeconomic inequalities in the near future depending how social security systems are able to react and
protect. The economic impact will thus further increase the uncertainty and psychological distress
experienced by many people.
The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic will therefore be multiple: there will be the impact of the
infection itself and the broader societal and health impacts. To identify genetic and environmental risk
factors for COVID-19 and address the medical, social and psychological aspects of the pandemic, we
developed and implemented a COVID-19 questionnaire, leading to the development of the Lifelines
COVID-19 cohort. The questionnaire collects data about COVID-19–related symptoms, current health
issues and societal impacts from participants recruited from the Lifelines population cohort [1] and the
Lifelines NEXT birth cohort [2], which both monitor the health of the northern Dutch population.

Through a questionnaire that is sent out (bi-)weekly, the project gathers information about the
symptoms of COVID-19, associated comorbidities and environmental factors, changes in work and
employment, corona-related worries, loneliness and the mental health and societal impacts of the
pandemic. In addition, all participating parents are asked about their children’s well-being and Lifelines
NEXT parents receive detailed questions about COVID-19-related symptoms expressed by their children.
The project has been able to ask questions on a weekly basis since March 30, 2020 that have assessed
the evolution of the COVID-19 outbreak and its influence on health in the three northern provinces of
the Netherlands.
The Lifelines COVID-19 cohort is a collaboration between researchers from Lifelines; Lifelines NEXT; the
University Medical Center Groningen Departments of Epidemiology, Genetics, Nephrology, Psychiatry
and Health Sciences; the University of Groningen Faculty of Economics and Business and Faculty of
Behavioural and Social Sciences; and the Aletta Jacobs School of Public Health. The data collected by the
questionnaires will be used to address four aspects of the outbreak: (1) how the COVID-19 pandemic
developed in the three northern provinces of the Netherlands, (2) which environmental risk factors
predict disease susceptibility and severity, (3) which genetic risk factors predict disease susceptibility and
severity and (4) what are the psychological and societal impacts of the crisis.
COVID-19 in the Netherlands and the Northern provinces
The first three official cases of COVID-19 in the Netherlands were registered on February 27, 2020 [3]. By
March 24, 2020, the number of cases diagnosed per day had risen to 1,126, with 750-1400 new cases per
day being registered by the Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu (RIVM) through April 24, 2020
(Figure 1B). Over this period, the number of deaths officially attributed to COVID-19 rose to ~150 per
day. The rapid rise in case numbers in early March led the Dutch government to shut down primary and
secondary schools, bars and restaurants, sporting facilities and other public spaces on March 15, 2020,

followed by a more extensive shut-down of public life in the weeks that followed (see Figure 1A for
major events). However, the three northern Dutch provinces did not follow the national trends. COVID19 appeared later in the northern provinces (first reported cases: Drenthe - March 1, 2020, Friesland March 10, 2020, Groningen - March 11, 2020), ramped up more slowly and never reached the same
incidence of cases or infection rates (see Reproductive values in Figure 1C). In the Netherlands, up until
June 9, 2020, a total of 47,903 SARS-CoV-2 infections were reported, and the number of COVID-19
hospitalizations and deaths are 11,800 and 6,031, respectively. For the Northern provinces combined,
the number of infections, hospitalizations, and deaths over the same period were 1,491 (Drenthe=523,
Groningen=352, Friesland=616), 320 (Drenthe=116, Groningen=74, Friesland=130), and 122
(Drenthe=40, Groningen=17, Friesland=65), respectively (see Supplementary table 1). Figure 2 shows the
geographical distribution of the number of hospitalizations across all Dutch provinces through mid-May.
Multiple factors have been proposed to explain why the outbreak started later in the Northern
provinces, and why its spread was more contained [4][5]. First, Drenthe, Groningen and Friesland
together are the least-populated region of the Netherlands, accounting for ~10% of the Dutch
population, and contain the fewest urban centres. In addition, the early arrival and spread of infection in
the southern Dutch province of North-Brabant seems to have originated in travel to and from Northern
Italy during the school holidays from February 22-March 1, 2020, with the spread of the infection in the
southern region then further facilitated by personal contact during regional carnival celebrations. In
contrast, the school holidays fell earlier for the Northern provinces, from February 15-22, 2020, which
suggests that northerners who travelled to Italy during the vacation had returned before the major
expansion of the outbreak in Northern Italy [6]. Nor is carnival widely or generally celebrated in the
Northern provinces. Other factors may also play a role, e.g. the local testing regime for COVID-19 was
stricter, more tests were available in the Northern provinces and healthcare workers had their
movements restricted once it became clear that cross-regional travel was a source of new infections [5].

The later arrival of COVID-19 to the North meant that the national steps taken to bring down the
infection rate were in place before the outbreak had really taken hold in the region covered by Lifelines,
where the caseload has so far remained the lowest in the country (Figure 2). It was against this backdrop
that the Lifelines COVID-19 research was developed and implemented.

Methods

Participant pool
Participants of the Lifelines COVID-19 cohort are recruited from the Lifelines population cohort and the
Lifelines NEXT birth cohort. Lifelines is a prospective population cohort following ~167,000 people in the
three Northern provinces of the Netherlands [1]. The cohort was established in 2006 and collects
detailed information about participants via extensive questionnaires and medical examinations. As a
population cohort, Lifelines is ideal for investigating common diseases and their relation to lifestyle and
environmental factors in a cross-section of the population of the three northern provinces, and the
cohort has been shown to be representative of the Northern Dutch population [7]. Lifelines was also
designed to recruit multiple participants within families to produce a multi-generational cohort that
could map individual and community health across life-course [1]. Since 2016, Lifelines NEXT has been
recruiting an additional generation through inclusion of mother-baby pairs, with partners also invited to
participate to generate parent-baby trios [2]. In addition, sub-cohorts within Lifelines such as Lifelines
DEEP [8] and Lifelines DAG3 have collected much more detailed biological measurements, including
genotype, metagenomics, metabolomics and transcriptomics. Lifelines data can also be linked to the
administrative records held by Statistics Netherlands (https://www.cbs.nl/en-gb), which include healthrelated records on mortality, hospital admissions and healthcare costs, as well as data on employment
status, income, wealth and other socio-demographic characteristics. This offers a huge potential for

societally relevant research about, for instance, the long-term impacts of the SARS-CoV-2-outbreak on
socioeconomic disparities in work and health.
Recruitment strategy and questionnaire timeline
To recruit participants for the Lifelines COVID-19 cohort, Lifelines and Lifelines NEXT invited their
participants digitally to fill out the questionnaires. All Lifelines participants over the age of 18 for whom
an email address is known received a link to the digital COVID-19 questionnaire according to the
schedule shown in Figure 1D. The digital invitations were valid for three weeks, and the date on which
the questionnaire was completed is registered. All eligible Lifelines participants are invited to participate
in each questionnaire round (Q1-Q7 in Figure 1D). Since Lifelines NEXT is an ongoing project in which
new participants are still being included, the number of NEXT participants invited increased with each
new questionnaire. Invited participants are free to choose if they want to fill in the questionnaire, and
the cohort population consists of all those who have filled out at least one questionnaire over the time
period of the project.
On March 30, 2020, all Lifelines and Lifelines NEXT participants were invited to participate in the first
COVID-19 questionnaire round (Q1), with new invitations to participate sent out weekly following the
timeline in Figure 1D. Starting in the week of March 27, 2020, an additional questionnaire about
children's health and symptoms was sent to the participants of the Lifelines NEXT (>300 participants).
Questionnaires were sent out weekly through the week of May 18, 2020, and at bi-weekly intervals
thereafter. As of writing, the project is set to continue into at least the summer and fall of 2020, which
means that recruitment and data gathering are still on-going.

The questionnaire includes modules on socio-demographic parameters, chronic diseases, COVID-19
infection, general health and symptoms, medication use, mental health/well-being of the respondent
and of children and young adults in their family, corona-related well-being, social life, social relations and
lifestyle (see Table 1 for questions). For participants answering a subsequent version of the
questionnaire, these questions are related to their experience in the period since the previous
questionnaire, either 7 or 14 days depending on the timing of questionnaires. Data collected by the
questionnaires is also linked to data for participants already stored in Lifelines (e.g. height, educational
background and many kinds of data from biological samples). Additional questions and question modules
have been added as the questionnaire program progressed.
Main questionnaire modules
Socio-demographics. Participants are asked about their household location, household make-up
(number of co-habitants, number of children), work situation (employment status, employment location
including working from home and whether they are still travelling to work, critical worker status and
whether they are unemployed due to the crisis), the work situations of their household members,
current weight, vaccination status (influenza and BMR) and pregnancy status. Participants who indicate
they have children under 18 are asked additional questions about their children’s stress levels and
experiences.
Chronic disease. Participants are asked whether they have a chronic health condition (cardiovascular
disease, lung disease, kidney disease, diabetes, chronic muscle disease, psychiatric disorder,
autoimmune disorder, cancer, neurological disease, spleen disease) and have the opportunity to
elaborate if their condition is not on the specified list.
COVID-19. Participants are asked if they have tested positive for COVID-19 or been diagnosed with
COVID-19 by a physician. They are also asked if they themselves think they have had COVID-19, if they

know how they were infected, if any of their cohabitants have tested positive or been diagnosed, and if
they have had physical contact with someone with COVID-19.
Health and symptoms. Participants are asked to assess their own health and to what extent they have
experienced 28 specific symptoms in the preceding week (see Table 1 for full list). They are also asked to
assess their experience of fatigue over the same time period.
Medication use. Participants are asked whether they have used any of eight classes of commonly used
medications (see Table 1 for full list) and to indicate which medications. They can also input other
medications not on the list.
Mental health and well-being. Participants are asked a series of questions to assess functioning of
psychosomatic and mental health. To assess symptoms of depression and anxiety, a subset of the Mini
International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) [9] was included in the Lifelines COVID-19 questionnaire.
The MINI has been administered in previous assessment waves of Lifelines to assess major depressive
disorder (MD) and general anxiety disorder (GAD), which will allow for comparative analyses between
pre- and post-outbreak. To evaluate a broader range of psychological problems and symptoms of
psychopathology, the 12-item ordinal Symptom CheckList-90 Somatization subscale (SCL-90 SOM), which
has been recommended for large-scale studies was surveyed [10]. The 12 items have five Likert-response
options. To assess symptoms of fatigue, a subset of the checklist individual strength (CIS-20) [11] was
included. Each CIS-20 item had seven Likert-response options. Both the SCL-90 SOM and CIS-20 were also
previously implemented in Lifelines. Respondents further received questions on the impact of the
pandemic on the mental health of their child or children, if applicable. These regarded three questions
on stress of the child because of the Corona-crisis and feeling safe at home and in their community, for
children aged 8-12 and 12-18 years.

Corona-related well-being. Participants are asked about their worries about the pandemic, what
infection precautions they are taking, where they are getting their COVID-19 information, their
perceptions of how the pandemic is affecting society and whether people close to them have had COVID19 or died of COVID-19. They are also asked to rate their quality of life.
Social life & Connectedness. These two modules ask about feelings of isolation and exclusion and the
extent to which participants feel connected to their families, neighbours, communities and nation.
Lifestyle. This module asks participants questions about changes in their eating patterns, exercise and
activity levels and tobacco and alcohol use.
Additional modules
COVID-19 and its impact on children. Parents participating in Lifelines NEXT also receive questionnaires
related to COVID-19 and symptoms in children. While it is now thought that children rarely develop
severe disease, and usually have the asymptomatic form, there are also reports of rare COVID-19
syndromes seen only in children [12]. Using these questionnaires, the project aims to look for the
appearance of various symptoms in children. The questions are categorized into three age groups:
questions for children aged 0-3 years, questions for children 4-7 years and questions for children 8-18
years old.
Supplemental question modules. Since the start of the Lifelines COVID-19 questionnaire programme,
additional modules have been adopted. These include a module for participants 65 and older to examine
the impact of the crisis on their daily functioning using the Groningen Frailty index [13] and a module for
parents of children aged 8-18 that explores the impact of the crisis on the quality of life of children,
measured by the KIDSCREEN-10 [14]. There is also now a questionnaire that examines the impact of
COVID-19 on work participation and financial wellbeing, including measures on the quantity and quality

of work performed, work absence, workplace and occupational characteristics. A module using the
Positive and Negative Affects Schedule (PANAS) [15] was also recently added to the questionnaire.

Preliminary results

Response rates and characteristics of respondents. Based on the availability of an email address and
being over 18 years of age, 139,713 out of 159,482 Lifelines participants are invited to respond to the
COVID-19 questionnaire during each questionnaire round. Compared to non-invited subjects, these
invited subjects were younger, slightly more often female, had a lower BMI and were more often never
smokers (Table 2). Of the 139,713 Lifelines participants invited, 68,501 (49%) completed at least one of
the questionnaires in the first 6 weeks of the programme. These responders were slightly older, slightly
more often female, had a higher BMI and were less often current smokers and more often ex-smokers
compared to non-responders (see Table 2). While Lifelines as whole has been shown to be
representative of the regional population [7], these slight differences in cohort make up should be
considered when looking at data from COVID-19 cohort. However, recruitment is still on-going, and the
characteristics of the cohort may change over time.
For Lifelines NEXT, 321 people were invited to participate in the first six weeks of the project, of whom
159 participated (49.5%). Compared to invitees, respondents were more likely to be female (73.5% of
respondents versus 50.5% of invitees). As Lifelines NEXT recruits women who are currently pregnant, the
age range was small and did not differ substantially between invitees, respondents and nonrespondents. In Lifelines NEXT, 80% of all parents who responded to the main Lifelines COVID-19
questionnaire returned data on their children for the module on COVID-19 and its impact on children. In
total, we have data for 76 children in week 5 of the COVID-19 questionnaire initiative: 64 children 0-3
years of age, 11 children 4-7 years of age and one child in the 8-18 age group.

COVID-19 infections and the Menni et al. prediction model. Of the participants who responded in the
first 6 weeks of the project, 1,034 (1.5%) responded that they had been tested for COVID-19, and 116
(0.2%) tested positive. In addition, 811 (1.2%) respondents said they had been told by a doctor that they
probably had COVID-19, while 5,034 (7.3%) participants responded that they thought they had had
COVID-19. Menni et al. have developed a model to predict positive COVID-19 cases based on symptoms
reported [16], and we applied this model to the data from the questionnaire to predict COVID-19 cases
within the cohort. Here we found that of all participants who were not tested for COVID-19, 6.1% were
predicted to have had COVID-19. In participants who had been told by a doctor that they probably had
COVID-19, 34.5% were predicted to have had COVID-19. In participants who responded that they
thought they had had COVID-19, 22.0% were predicted to have had COVID-19. Of the remaining
participants, 4.7% were predicted to have had COVID-19. The Menni et al model [16] had an AUC of
0.821 (95% CI: 0.765-0.878) when we applied it to our data using incident positive tests (n=49) and
incident negative tests (n=408). The specificity was 0.828 and the negative predictive value was 0.944,
indicating that the model is good at predicting the negative cases. However, the sensitivity and positive
predictive value were much lower (0.592 and 0.293, respectively) and this indicates that for future
applications, for example in genome-wide association studies, the ability of the model to accurately
predict the true positive cases needs to be improved, and this work is on-going.
Sharing of early results. Results of the study are continuously updated and shared with Lifelines COVID19 cohort participants and the Dutch public through the Corona Barometer website
(https://coronabarometer.nl/), which presents on-going results as interactive infographics (see snapshot
in Figure 2), and through frequent social media posts and press releases. One of the earliest results of
the project was a clear signal that feelings of loneliness and isolation were substantially stronger in
individuals who lived alone and that this effect was strongest in the youngest age group of respondents
(18-30 year olds, see corresponding panel in Figure 2). There was also an increase in the number of

unemployed respondents who reported losing their jobs due the crisis, rising from 7.5% of unemployed
respondents to the first questionnaire round (Q1) up to 14% by the week 5 questionnaire (Q5). More
recent results have shown that by the end of May 2020, as the number of infections and hospitalizations
dropped to low levels and schools and business reopened, respondents were reporting less anxiety,
better sleep and fewer worries about losing their jobs.

Current and future directions
The data collected from the Lifelines COVID-19 cohort is currently being analysed to address the four
goals of the project. The COVID-19 cases reported by participants are being used to track the outbreak,
and the symptoms reported by participants are being examined to generate a symptom-based COVID-19
prediction model, as described above. The data on chronic diseases, medication use and environmental
factors (ranging from cohabitation to smoking) will be used to look for associations with SARS-CoV-2
susceptibility and COVID-19 severity, which can help identify risk factors, protective factors and
comorbidities. While factors such as age, sex, BMI and certain chronic illnesses have now been
associated with a more severe COVID-19 and higher mortality [17], there have also been questions about
whether recent BMR vaccinations can be protective factors [18][19], and the data collected in this cohort
should help address this question. Important questions about why pregnant women and children seem
to be relatively protected will also be analysed. Finally, it will be possible to look at genetic factors in
detail as 17,911 of the 68,501 COVID-19 participants who completed at least one questionnaire have
been genotyped. Next steps include identifying participants who were also participants in the Lifelines
cohorts for which we have more detailed data, e.g. participants with gut microbiome data, currently
available for >10,000 Lifelines participants.
Mental health problems are known to increase in times of physical and psychological distress. The
current COVID-19 pandemic is accompanied by strict government measures of social distancing and

quarantine to contain and control the spread of the virus. As these events place significant stress on
society and increase isolation and loneliness, close monitoring of mental well-being is important for both
short- and long-term public health policies and individual-level care. Alertness in clinical systems and
tailored mental health care may be needed during and after such a mass traumatic event. The data from
the MINI MD and GAD modules and the societal impact modules of the questionnaire will allow
researchers to i) longitudinally track the prevalence of symptoms and diagnoses of MD and GAD during
the pandemic in the Lifelines and Lifelines NEXT populations, ii) associate symptoms with COVID-19
severity and outcome, iii) identify at-risk groups and individuals and iv) measure the impact of
government policies on the overall mental health in the cohort.
The pandemic has had a major impact on the working lives of people in the Netherlands, and the
questionnaire will help to address this impact. Healthcare workers are a particularly vulnerable group
due to their higher risk of being infected by SARS-CoV-2, and for many workers in healthcare professions,
the current working conditions include long work hours, cancelled holidays, working environments with
adverse physical and psychosocial work conditions, i.e. high psychological and emotional demands and
low control [20][21]. These working conditions, together with moral distress in relation to the family
situation during lockdown, may increase the risk for mental health problems and sickness absence in this
occupational group, which is dominated by women, and with a high baseline risk. Other “essential”
occupational groups are also experiencing unprecedented changes in their working environments that
may affect their physical and mental health as well as their labour market attachment. For many “nonessential” occupational groups that are now encouraged to work from home, the home working
environment might not be suitable, as not all jobs can easily be done from home, and many families now
have to combine working from home with caring for children. This will likely impact the productivity and
quality of their work, as well as the level of stress.

The lockdown has led to a sudden disruption of the economy, and several economic sectors were
effectively brought to a standstill. As a result, many workers in these sectors have been temporarily laidoff of work, while workers in other nonessential sectors were encouraged to work from home as much
as possible. To protect people from losing their jobs and minimise the impact on self-employed people,
the Dutch government implemented a series of financial measures. Despite these measures, however, a
large number of workers who were already at a disadvantage because of flexible contracts lost their jobs
shortly after the lockdown. The Lifelines COVID-19 questionnaire is monitoring changes in people’s
current work situation by asking if they lost their job because of the crisis, if they are working in an
essential job, and whether they have to work from home. The answers to these questions will be used to
monitor both the impact of the crisis on the short- and longer-term labour market and to identify
workers most at risk of losing their job. This is essential information for policymakers to be able to target
measures to the most vulnerable groups in society and mitigate the financial impact of the crisis.

Links to other national and international programs
All the data generated by the Lifelines COVID-19 questionnaire is linked to data held in Lifelines about its
participants. This will allow for longer-term monitoring of participants beyond the timeline of the
questionnaire program and the COVID-19 outbreak. Besides linkage to other Lifelines data, the Lifelines
COVID-19 cohort data can also be linked to societal data held by Statistics Nederland, to drug
prescription data held by IADB.nl via the Pharmlines initiative [22] and to SARS-CoV-2 testing data
(including serological data) held by Certe and other Dutch laboratories. Overlap with enriched Lifelines
datasets in Lifelines Deep [8], Lifelines DAG3 (an on-going project with metagenomic sequencing the gut
microbiome of 10,000 Lifelines participants) and Lifelines NEXT [2] will also allow for research projects
with a different scope. Given that there is now genetic data for 17,911 of the 68,501 COVID-19 cohort
participants generated through the UMCG Genetics Lifelines Initiative (UGLI), it will be possible to look at

genetic risk (and protective) factors. The Lifelines COVID-19 project is also participating in the COVID-19
Host Genetics Initiative [23], an international collaboration to share and analyse data to identify the
genetic determinants of SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility, COVID-19 severity and outcomes.
The Lifelines COVID-19 questionnaire was designed to make comparisons with similar projects
throughout Europe. Direct cross-national comparisons with projects in Denmark and France are possible,
as they are using nearly identical questionnaires, and will provide unique opportunities to examine the
effect of different governmental measures on mental health and well-being. This cohort is also part of
COVID-MINDS, an initiative at UCL. These insights can be used to fine-tune some of the measures when
there will be a second wave of the COVID-19 epidemic. Moreover, the Lifelines COVID-19 questionnaires
have been requested by other (inter)national researchers as basis for designing their own
questionnaires, i.e. separate research has been done on the experiences of COVID-19 patients, both
hospitalised and not hospitalised, making use of the Lifelines COVID-19 questions.

Strengths and limitations

One of the main strengths of this project is its embedding within the now long-running Lifelines
prospective population cohort, which provides a rich data background about participants and the
knowledge, infrastructure and relationship with participants necessary to recruit and engage participants
during an evolving crisis. The high and sustained rate of response and the weekly questionnaires mean
that the project will have a detailed longitudinal prospective view of both the outbreak and the wider
psychological and societal impacts of the crisis. Another strength is the collaboration of researchers
across a range of disciplines in designing and implementing the questionnaire, which means that the
questions included can be used to address a wide range of research questions, can have immediate
impact on policy and can be used to help design new policies to prevent and/or manage renewed

outbreaks. Finally, Lifelines will continue to follow its participants for the coming decade and beyond,
providing opportunities to examine the long-term health impacts of the pandemic.
The timing and nature of the COVID-19 outbreak in the Northern Netherlands, which diverged from that
in other parts of the country, is both a strength and a limitation. The relatively low number of cases in
the region, even accounting for undiagnosed cases, may seem to pose difficulties for statistical
association analyses looking at COVID-19-related factors. However, even within our cohort, >800
participants have had a COVID-19 diagnosis, confirmed either through a positive test or through a
doctor’s diagnosis, which permits a wide number of statistical association analyses. Moreover, the
impact of the societal steps taken to reduce the rate of infection in more heavily impacted regions of the
Netherlands and the impact of the associated economic crises should have similar psychological and
social impacts in the Lifelines population. The fact that the outbreak in the North was effectively capped
by public health steps now puts the questionnaire programme in an interesting position to monitor the
immediate health and societal impacts of the lockdown measures and the subsequent impact of coming
out of lockdown. It may also lay groundwork for steps to be taken if there is a later resurgence of COVID19 infections, and the data generated while infection rates were low could work as baseline values if
subsequent outbreaks in the Northern provinces are more intense.
