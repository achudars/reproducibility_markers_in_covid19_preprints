Summary
LamPORE is a novel diagnostic platform for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA that combines
loop-mediated isothermal amplification with nanopore sequencing, which could potentially
be used to analyse thousands of samples per day on a single instrument. We evaluated the
performance of LamPORE against RT-PCR using RNA extracted from spiked respiratory
samples and from stored nose and throat swabs collected at two UK hospitals. The limit of
detection of LamPORE was 7-10 genome copies/µl of extracted RNA. This is above the limit
achievable by RT-PCR but was not associated with a significant reduction of sensitivity in
clinical samples. Positive clinical specimens came mostly from patients with acute
symptomatic infection, and among these LamPORE had a diagnostic sensitivity of 99.1%
(226/228 [95% CI 96.9–99.9%]). Among negative clinical specimens, including 153 with
other respiratory pathogens detected, LamPORE had a diagnostic specificity of 99.6%
(278/279 [98.0–100.0%]). Overall, 1.4% (7/514 [0.5–2.9]) of samples produced an
indeterminate result on first testing, and repeat LamPORE testing on the same RNA extract
had a reproducibility of 96.8% (478/494 [94.8–98.1]). This indicates that LamPORE has a
similar performance to RT-PCR for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in symptomatic
patients, and offers a promising approach to high-throughput testing.

Background
Rapid, reliable and high-throughput methods of testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection would help
to control transmission. Present diagnosis relies mostly on RT-PCR, but this has proven
difficult to expand to the scale needed for population-wide testing of symptomatic
individuals. For example, shortages of laboratory RT-PCR capacity still limit the United

Kingdom testing program more than seven months after the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic was
declared a public health emergency of international concern by the WHO. Further
expansion of testing to include screening of asymptomatic individuals, which may be
needed to prevent SARS-CoV-2 circulation, would require a significant further increase in
testing capacity1,2.

In the UK, clinical laboratories have struggled to expand conventional RT-PCR workflows to
meet the demand for SARS-CoV-2 testing, and many have explored alternative methods that
would be more scalable or allow near-patient use3,4. At the Oxford University Hospitals NHS
Foundation Trust (OUH) and Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (STH), we
evaluated LamPORE, a novel diagnostic platform for SARS-CoV-2 that combines loopmediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) with nanopore sequencing5. During sample
preparation a unique combination of DNA barcodes is incorporated into the LAMP products
from each specimen so that these can be pooled into a single sequencing run. The protocol
currently allows up to 96 samples to be analysed on one flow cell, potentially allowing
thousands of samples to be analysed per day on a single instrument. The workflow involves
a 40-minute amplification, followed by a library preparation and a 60-minute sequencing
run, generating results in a comparable time to RT-PCR when starting with extracted RNA.

As well as molecular barcoding, using sequencing to detect the outcome of the LAMP
reaction offers other advantages compared with simpler LAMP assays that detect the
presence of DNA synthesis by measurement of pH, turbidity, or fluorescent dyes. Sequenced
reads from a specific target will contain sequences not present in the primers, avoiding false
positives caused by non-specific amplification6. Conversely, reads confidently assigned to

SARS-CoV-2 target can indicate a true positive even if present at relatively low levels,
potentially improving the low sensitivity seen in several LAMP assays compared to RT-PCR7.
LamPORE uses standard Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) flow cells compatible with
several sequencing instruments, including the portable MinION device, and high-throughput
GridION and PromethION platforms, so could potentially be used both for mobile and
centralised testing.

In this evaluation we aim to compare the performance of LamPORE, which is awaiting
regulatory approval, with RT-PCR on extracted RNA from respiratory specimens. Initially, we
use spiked samples to determine the analytical limit of detection of the assay. We then use
stored clinical samples to determine the assay’s diagnostic sensitivity, specificity and
reproducibility.

Methods
The evaluation was conducted across three sites: OUH, STH and the Public Health England
National Infection Service at Porton Down (PHE Porton Down).

LamPORE
LamPORE is described in detail in James, et al.5, and was performed identically at each site
using a GridION instrument with operators blinded to sample identity. The assay takes 20µl
RNA input into a single multiplex reaction targeting three regions of the SARS-CoV-2
genome; ORF1a, envelope and nucleocapsid genes, plus human β-actin mRNA as a control
of sampling adequacy and assay performance. LamPORE sample preparation uses a 96-well

plate format, with each sample having one of eight LAMP Forward Inner Primer (FIP)
barcodes and one of 12 transposase (rapid) barcodes added before pooling. In these
experiments a single LAMP barcode (FIP7) was not used, as it had previously been
associated with lower β-actin read counts and was awaiting replacement (unpublished
data). As a result, plates contained up to 80 samples, plus two no-template controls and two
positive controls consisting of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA (Twist Bioscience).

We used the LamPORE protocol dated 1st July 2020 (version 1, revision 4), the full text of
which is available in the supplementary material. Briefly, this consists of adding sample RNA
to LAMP master mix and primers, then incubating at 65-80˚C in a thermocycler for 40
minutes, during which time amplification occurs and the LAMP primer barcodes are
incorporated into concatemers containing the target sequence. Following this, a second set
of barcodes are incorporated using a rapid transposase-based method and samples are
pooled into a single sequencing library. The pooled library has a bead-based cleanup, then is
added to a MinION flow cell and sequenced for 60 minutes, after which a report is
generated automatically within seconds for each barcode set. Unlike RT-qPCR, LamPORE is
not designed to be a quantitative assay, as measurement only occurs after amplification is
complete. The number of reads assigned to each target is used to generate a report as
follows:
Invalid: <50 classified reads in total detected from SARS-CoV-2 and β-actin targets
Positive: ≥50 SARS-CoV-2 reads detected (adding read counts across all three SARS-CoV-2
targets)
Inconclusive: not invalid and ≥20 and <50 SARS-CoV-2 reads detected
Negative: not invalid and <20 SARS-CoV-2 reads detected

Spiked samples – PHE Porton Down
Spiked samples were prepared and analysed at PHE Porton Down to establish the limits of
detection of LamPORE. Aliquots of pooled volunteer saliva were used for spiking
experiments, which were confirmed SARS-CoV-2 negative by RT-PCR. These were spiked
with cultured SARS-CoV-2 (Victoria/01/202026 passaged twice in Vero/hSLAM cells) and
serially diluted with the remaining material to create a dilution series of positive samples.

From each spiked sample a 140µl aliquot was inactivated by addition to 560µl buffer AVL
(Qiagen), incubated at ambient temperature for 10 minutes, then added to 560µl 100%
molecular grade ethanol. The entire inactivated volume was then extracted manually using
the QiaAMP Viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen), with RNA elution into 50µl of nuclease-free water.

For the quantitation of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR, 5µl of RNA extract was used in each of
duplicate reactions using the CDC NS1 assay8 and the TaqPath 1-Step RT-qPCR Master Mix
(Thermo Fisher). All samples were run in a 96-well plate format on a QuantStudioTM 7 Flex
System and quantified by comparison to a standard curve of a plasmid 2019-nCoV_N
positive control (Integrated DNA Technologies).

Clinical specimens – OUH and STH
Testing of stored clinical samples was performed at OUH and STH. All samples were nose
and/or throat swabs collected into viral transport media during routine clinical care and
stored at -80˚C.

Sample selection
SARS-CoV-2 positive samples: At OUH sequentially available positive samples were chosen
without reference to RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) value. These were collected from MarchApril 2020, during which time the PHE RdRp RT-PCR assay was in use9, and testing was
mostly restricted to hospitalised patients and symptomatic staff. At STH a stratified random
sample of specimens collected from April-May 2020 were selected based on their initial
SARS-CoV-2 E gene Ct value, with 50% <30 and 50% ≥30. During this collection period,
testing at STH was also largely restricted to hospitalised patients and symptomatic staff,
using an in-house assay based on the Corman et al. protocol10,11.

SARS-CoV-2 negative samples: At OUH negative samples were selected from stored prepandemic respiratory samples. These had initially been tested with either GeneXpert
Flu/RSV (Cepheid) or the BioFire FilmArray Respiratory panel 2.0 (BioMérieux), and were
purposefully chosen to include samples with a range of other respiratory pathogens. Over
90% of samples were collected between October-December 2019, but those containing
non-SARS-CoV-2 seasonal coronaviruses were used up to a collection data of 10th March
2020 to increase the number available. At STH negatives samples were selected from among
those submitted for SARS-CoV-2 testing.

RNA extraction
For samples originating from OUH, RNA extraction used the QIAsymphony SP instrument
with the DSP Virus/Pathogen Kit and the Complex200_OBL_V4_DSP protocol (Qiagen12).
200µl transport medium was added to 430 μl Off Board Lysis buffer then incubated at 68°C

for 15 minutes. The whole volume was used for extraction and RNA was eluted in 60µl, then
immediately transferred to aliquots and stored at -80˚C.

For samples originating from STH, RNA extraction used the MagNA Pure96 instrument with
the MagNA Pure 96 DNA and Viral NA Small Volume Kit (Roche). 200µl of transport medium
was taken into the extraction and RNA eluted in 100µl before storage at -80˚C.

Comparator RT-PCR
Comparison RT-PCR assays were undertaken contemporaneously with LamPORE. For
samples originating from OUH, the comparator RT-PCR was the RealStar SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR
assay (Altona Diagnostics) on a Qiagen Rotor-Gene Q RT-PCR cycler. This assay takes 10µl
RNA input into a single multiplex reaction targeting the SARS-CoV-2 envelope and spike
genes, plus an internal control. Samples were analysed in runs including a no template
control (NTC), internal quality control (supplied with the RT-PCR kit) and positive control
(synthetic genomic SARS-CoV-2 RNA, Twist Bioscience). Results were reported as per OUH
criteria for clinical specimens:
Positive: Either SARS-CoV-2 target detected at a Ct value ≤37
Negative: Neither SARS-CoV-2 targets detected at any Ct value, and sample internal control
+/- 3 of the NTC
Invalid: Any other result (retested in routine practice, but invalid samples not used for the
evaluation)

For samples originating from STH, an in-house RT-PCR assay based on Corman et al.10,11
provided the comparator, run on an Applied Biosystem 7500 Real Time PCR system. The

assay takes 6µl RNA input into a multiplex reaction targeting SARS-CoV-2 E and RdRp genes,
plus human RNAse P as an internal control13. Results were reported as per STH criteria for
clinical specimens:
Positive: Either SARS-CoV-2 target detected at a Ct value ≤37.5. Any Ct value single target
>37.5 is handled using the referenced algorithm11
Negative: Neither SARS-CoV-2 target detected and no evidence of inhibition of the internal
control
Invalid: Internal control not detectable (invalid samples not used for LamPORE evaluation)

LamPORE was performed on one aliquot of RNA, with simultaneous SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR on
another aliquot of the same extract, which was used as the reference. Only samples with a
valid SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR result in keeping with the expected positive or negative
categorisation were included in the comparison (10 pre-pandemic negative samples were
not used as they had invalid results, and 2 previously positive samples were not used as they
had invalid/negative results on repeat testing).

Replicates
To assess the reproducibility of the assay, LamPORE replicates were performed on aliquots
of the same RNA extract, thawed just prior to analysis. Results from the first replicate were
used to report overall diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. To ensure that RT-PCR and
LamPORE results were comparable between OUH and STH, a subset of SARS-CoV-2 positive
and negative samples were exchanged between sites, with both LamPORE and comparator
RT-PCR repeated.

Statistical analysis
Results were analysed using R version 3.5.0, with exact binomial confidence intervals
calculated for proportions. The initial LamPORE replicates were used to derive estimates of
sensitivity and specificity, with second replicates used to estimate LamPORE reproducibility.
The full dataset is available in the supplementary material.

Results
Limit of Detection
Using spiked samples spiked with cultured virus, LamPORE had a limit of detection of 7-10
SARS-CoV-2 genome copies/µl of extracted RNA or 140-200 copies per 20µl reaction,
detecting 24/25 (96%) samples in this range (table 1). With the RNA extraction protocol
used, this would correspond to a concentration of 2,500-3,600 SARS-CoV-2 genome
copies/ml of sample. Although LamPORE did not consistently detect spiked samples at
concentrations below this, it was positive in 15/21 (71%) samples at the highest dilution
tested, 3-4 genome copies/µl of extracted RNA or 50-70 copies per 20µl reaction, equivalent
to 900-1,250 copies/ml of sample.

Performance of LamPORE
Diagnostic performance of LamPORE was assessed using 514 stored nose and throat swabs,
400 from OUH and 114 from STH (details in table S1). Sixty cross-site replicates
demonstrated good correlation between RT-PCR Ct values for E gene targets at both sites
despite different assays being used at OUH and STH, so this was used as the reference Ct
(figure S1).

Among 229 RT-PCR-positive samples tested by LamPORE, 226 were reported positive and 2
were reported negative, giving and overall diagnostic sensitivity of 99.1% (226/228 [95%CI
96.9-99.9%])(table 2). All valid samples at Ct values of 34.9 or lower were positive by
LamPORE (table 3). Considering performance at lower viral loads, 7/9 samples with Ct ≥35
were positive and 22/22 of those with Ct values between 30 and 34.9 were positive. Both
false negative samples by LamPORE had Ct values ≥38, and one of these was positive by
LamPORE on repeat testing (table S2). The one RT-PCR positive sample that was invalid on
initial LamPORE testing was correctly positive when repeated.

Table 3 Performance of LamPORE on SARS-CoV-2 positive samples by RT-PCR E gene Ct value

Of 285 RT-PCR-negative samples, 278 were negative and one was positive by LamPORE,
giving an overall diagnostic specificity of 99.6% (278/279 [98.0-100.0%]) (table 2). The false
positive was a pre-pandemic respiratory sample that was also positive for adenovirus, and
which had 2,419 SARS-CoV-2 reads detected. However, this sample was negative on repeat
LamPORE testing (figure S2). Six RT-PCR negative samples gave indeterminate results (three
invalid, three inconclusive), of which four were correctly negative on repeat testing, one
remained invalid, and one was not retested. Overall, among both RT-PCR-positive and
negative samples, 1.4% (7/514 [0.5–2.9]) produced an indeterminate result on first testing.

Another respiratory pathogen was detected by multiplex RT-PCR in 153 negative samples,
including 43 with rhinovirus, 38 with RSV, 33 with influenza, and 24 with seasonal
coronaviruses (nine HKU1, seven NL63, seven OC43, and one 229E). Overall, there was no
evidence that the presence of any other respiratory pathogen was associated with false
positive results, or greater numbers of reads assigned to SARS-CoV-2 targets (figure S2).

As well as the categorical result produced by the LamPORE reporting algorithm, RT-PCR
results were compared with the number of reads assigned by LamPORE to SARS-CoV-2

targets (figure 1). This showed that the pre-specified cut-off of ≥50 for a positive result was
optimal, with any cut-off in the range of 25-182 producing a maximal Youden index
(sensitivity+specificity-1) of 0.988. As the rate at which reads are detected becomes roughly
constant within a few minutes of sequencing, the effect of a sequencing run longer or
shorter than 60 minutes can be inferred. All samples reported positive by LamPORE had
>180 SARS-CoV-2 reads detected, so would have been positive after 30 minutes of
sequencing, at which point there would also have been no increase in indeterminate results.
Conversely, extending the sequencing duration with the same diagnostic thresholds would
not have allowed detection of either of the two false negative samples without producing
large numbers of false positives.

Reproducibility
LamPORE was repeated on 494 samples and produced identical results in 478, giving an
overall reproducibility of 96.8% (478/494 [94.8-98.1%])(tables 4 and S3). In four samples
(0.8%) with discrepant LamPORE results, the same sample switched between Negative and
Positive. In the other 12 discrepant samples LamPORE replicates included one
indeterminate result. All 90 cross-site LamPORE replicates performed between Oxford and
Sheffield were concordant (60 RT-PCR/LamPORE positive and 30 RT-PCR/LamPOREnegative).

Discussion
In this evaluation we found that LamPORE had a high diagnostic sensitivity (99.1%)
compared to reference RT-PCR in our clinical sample set, consistent with initial development
work5. The limit of detection of LamPORE, at 7-10 genome copies/µl of extracted RNA, was
somewhat higher than the 2 copies/µl achievable with high-performance RT-PCR14, but this
did not correspond to a significant loss of diagnostic sensitivity in the clinical samples. Our
spiking experiments used an extraction in which RNA from 140µl transport medium was
eluted in 50µl, which is typical of commonly used protocols. However, commercially

potentially meaning that LamPORE with an input volume of 1ml could have the same limit of
detection as RT-PCR with an input volume of 140-200µl. This assumes minimal increase in
assay inhibition at higher input volumes, which is currently being evaluated. LamPORE also
showed high diagnostic specificity (99.6%) and reproducibility (96.8%), both within and
across sites, supporting its practical use for high-throughput testing in a low-prevalence
population.

Although no clinical metadata are available for the samples used in this evaluation, they will
mainly have been derived from patients with acute symptomatic infection, often requiring
admission to hospital, as testing was mainly limited to this group during the first wave of
infection. The distribution of Ct values may be higher in a population with more mild or
asymptomatic infection, and would be markedly higher among those who remain RT-PCR
positive weeks after recovering from acute infection15,16. Our data suggest that LamPORE is
most likely to miss weak positive samples with Ct values above 35, so could have had lower
diagnostic sensitivity if tested in such groups. However, this may not be a significant
practical disadvantage, as although weak positives have some value for contact tracing they
are likely to come from individuals with low infectious potential17.

Our evaluation has several limitations. It was conducted after the first wave of COVID-19 in
the UK, when there were few incident cases, so we were unable to prospectively collect
samples and instead relied on frozen transport media, which could differ from fresh
material. Positives were defined by a positive RT-PCR at the time of initial sample collection
and by repeat positive RT-PCR simultaneously with LamPORE, but although RT-PCR is used

as a reference test for SARS-CoV-2, there are many reports of its suboptimal sensitivity in
clinical infection18.

This early evaluation of LamPORE compared its performance against RT-PCR using extracted
RNA, as this is the standard material used for detection of SARS-CoV-2. However, the
requirement for viral inactivation and RNA extraction in a clinical laboratory produces
bottlenecks that mitigate the potential benefit of LamPORE for high-throughput or mobile
testing. LAMP reactions are reported to be more robust than RT-PCR to inhibitors present in
clinical samples so may have superior performance with extraction-free protocols19,20. This
could greatly streamline the workflow, but further evaluation is required. We also did not
evaluate how the throughput and turnaround time of LamPORE would compare to RT-PCR
during routine use in a clinical laboratory or centralised testing centre. Using LamPORE for
high-throughput testing of tens or hundreds of thousands of samples per day would be
dependent on an streamlined workflow, including automated sample handling and
integration with laboratory information management systems.

In conclusion, we show that LamPORE on extracted RNA offers a promising method of highthroughput SARS-CoV-2 testing, and could be of much broader use if shown to work with
extraction-free methods of sample preparation and automated workflows.
