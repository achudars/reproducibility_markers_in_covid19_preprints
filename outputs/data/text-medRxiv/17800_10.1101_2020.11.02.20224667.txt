Findings: This population-based study shows that during the COVID-19 lockdown children and adolescents
report lower mental and social health, especially on anxiety and depressive symptoms.
Meaning: In proposing new COVID regulations (e.g., closing schools) governments should be mindful of the
negative impact of a lockdown on mental and social health of children and adolescents.

Abstract
Importance: It is unknown how a lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic impacts children’s and
adolescents’ mental and social health.
Objective: To compare mental and social health of children and adolescents during the COVID-19
lockdown versus before, identify associated factors, describe the change in atmosphere at home and
qualitatively assess the impact of COVID-19 regulations on daily life.
Design: Cross-sectional study comparing two Dutch representative samples of children and adolescents
(8-18 years); before COVID-19 (Dec2017-July2018) and during the COVID-19 lockdown (April/May
2020).
Setting: Population-based
Participants: Children and adolescents aged 8-18 years (M=13.4, 47.4% male), representative of the
Dutch population on key demographics.
Exposure(s): COVID-19 pandemic lockdown
Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System
(PROMIS®) domains: Global Health, Peer Relationships, Anxiety, Depressive Symptoms, Anger and
Sleep-Related Impairment. Single item on atmosphere at home and open question regarding the impact
of the regulations on the child/adolescent’s daily life
Results: Children and adolescents reported significantly worse PROMIS T-scores on all domains
(absolute mean difference range, 2.1-7.1; absolute 95% CI range, 1.3-7.9) during the COVID-19
lockdown as compared to before COVID-19. More children reported severe Anxiety (during 16.7% vs.
before 8.6%; relative risk 1.95; 95% CI 1.55-2.46) and Sleep-Related Impairment (during 11.5% vs.
before 6.1%; relative risk 1.89; 95% CI 1.29-2.78). Fewer children reported poor Global Health (during
1.7 vs. before 4.6%; relative risk 0.36; 95% CI 0.20-0.65). More mental and social health complaints
during the COVID-19 lockdown were found in children and adolescents growing up in a singleparent family, having ≥three children in the family, a negative change in work situation of parents due
to COVID-19 regulations, and having a relative/friend infected with COVID-19. A small effect was
found on atmosphere at home during the lockdown compared to before (mean difference, -3.1; 95% CI,
-4.1 - -2.1). A large majority (>90%) reported a negative impact of the COVID-19 regulations on their
daily life.

Conclusions and Relevance: This study showed that governmental regulations regarding lockdown
pose a serious mental and social health threat on children and adolescents that should be brought to the
forefront of political decision making and mental health care policy, intervention and prevention.

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has an enormous impact on society as a whole, and certainly also on children
and adolescents. Although children and adolescents are less affected by morbidity and mortality1, the
restrictions imposed by governments worldwide profoundly impact their daily life, including their
mental and social health.2
In the Netherlands, the first COVID-19 patient was identified on February 27th 2020 and
restrictions were imposed by the government starting on March 12th 2020. People were asked to stay
inside and work from home as much as possible, to comply to social distancing (1.5 meter) and all large
events were canceled. On March 15th, a ‘partial’ lockdown was implemented.3 All schools and child
care facilities were closed (unless one or both parents had an occupation classified as essential), as well
as sports and leisure facilities, bars, and restaurants. However, children were still allowed to play outside,
and visitors up to three persons at home were permitted. On May 11th primary schools were partially
reopened and on June 2nd secondary schools followed.
During the lockdown, children and adolescents were experiencing physical isolation from their
classmates, friends, teachers, and other important adults (e.g., grandparents). This might not only result
in feelings of loneliness, but could potentially lead to precarious situations for children from unsafe
domestic situations, due to a lack of escape possibilities. In addition, children and adolescents may
experience mental health problems due to the COVID-19 pandemic itself, such as increased anxiety, as
they might fear that they or their loved ones will get infected or they might worry about the future of the
world.
Several cross-sectional and longitudinal studies on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on
mental health in adults have now been published. Increased levels of anxiety, depression, suicidal
ideation and (post-traumatic) stress, decreased psychological well-being, and a high percentage of sleep
problems have been reported.4-13 Poor mental health was associated with female gender, younger age,
low educational level, living alone/being divorced, having no work, low income, a socially
disadvantaged background, and having an infected relative with COVID-19.4-12
However, studies on the effects of the COVID-19 lockdown on social and mental health of
children and adolescents are yet sparse. Several opinion papers prelude on the most probable effects,
and they have painted an image of loneliness, anxiety and depression following social isolation.14,15
Additionally, these papers have described increased tension at home and child abuse as possible
consequences during the lockdown.16,17 Several authors fear that the lockdown will magnify existing
health disparities and that certain communities (e.g., with migrant background and low socioeconomic
status) will be more vulnerable to develop mental and social health issues.15,18,19 Notably, it has been
hypothesized that some children may also experience positive consequences of the lockdown such as
personal and social alleviation, family cohesion and reduction of stress.20
One systematic review on the effects of previous pandemics on mental health of children and
adolescents is available, indicating that social isolation and quarantining has a negative impact on

anxiety, depressive and fear symptoms.2 Additionally, only three cross-sectional survey studies are
currently available, all from China, focusing on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown
specifically. They reported prevalences of anxiety and depressive symptoms of 19% and 23% for
primary school children,21 of 37% and 44% for high school children,22 and clinically elevated depressive
symptoms scores for >22% of children and adolescents23 during the COVID-19 lockdown. These
prevalences were reported to be higher compared to pre-COVID-19 established cut-offs and percentages
in China, however none of these differences were statistically tested. Especially girls, older children,
children living in an urban region and children having a COVID-19 infected friend/relative appeared to
be most prone to mental health problems.22,23
A better understanding of how the governmental restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic
affect children’s and adolescents’ mental and social health can help guide future interventions and
inform policy makers. The current study compares mental and social health of a representative sample
of Dutch children and adolescents during the COVID-19 lockdown to earlier collected before COVID19 reference data. The aims of this study were to: (1) quantify differences in mental and social health of
children and adolescents before and during the COVID-19 lockdown, (2) identify factors that are
associated with poorer mental and social health during the COVID-19 lockdown, (3) examine the change
in overall atmosphere at home before and during the COVID-19 lockdown, and (4) qualitatively assess
the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on their daily life of children and adolescents.

Methods
Participants and procedure
Before COVID-19
As part of a larger Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) validation
study, two studies were conducted between December 2017 and July 2018 in the Dutch general
population to collect representative data of children and adolescents (8-18 years) on physical, mental
and social aspects of health. A two-step random stratified sampling method was used to ensure
representativeness on key demographics. Parents participating in existing panels were approached by
two independent online research agencies (‘Kantar Public’ or ‘Panel Inzicht’). Both panels consist of
families living across the Netherlands, that provided informed consent to be approached through e-mail
for completing questionnaires for a small financial compensation. Children were subsequently
approached by their parents to complete self-report questionnaires. Children completed the
questionnaires through our research website of the KLIK Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROM)
portal24 or the panel website. Parents were asked to complete a socio-demographic questionnaire. All
children and parents provided informed consent and the studies were approved by the Medical Ethics
Committee Amsterdam UMC. The samples were representative of the Dutch general population within
2.5% on most key demographics (age, gender, ethnicity, region, and educational level) compared to
population numbers in 2017. Parental country of birth and parental educational level data were
differently categorized for PROMIS Anxiety and Depressive Symptoms and therefore not useable for
this study.25
During COVID-19
During the COVID-19 lockdown, between April 10th and May 5th 2020, data were collected by ‘Panel
Inzicht’ from another sample of children and adolescents from the Dutch general population. The aim
was to collect data on the same measures in a representative sample of approximately 1000 children
with similar characteristics (within 2.5% of the previously mentioned key demographics) as the before
COVID-19 sample. Data collection procedures were similar as in 2018, with the addition of a few
COVID-19 specific questions for children, adolescents and parents. Children and parents provided
informed consent and the study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee Amsterdam UMC.
Measures
Socio-demographic questionnaires
Parents completed questions about themselves (region of residence, country of birth, educational level,
marital status, and number of children) and their child (age, gender).

PROMIS pediatric measures
PROMIS item banks and scales were developed and validated, to measure generic unidimensional
domains (e.g., anxiety) of physical, social or mental health using modern psychometric techniques.26
The item banks can be administered as Computerized Adaptive Test (CAT), where items are selected
based on responses to previously completed items, resulting in a reliable score with a few items.27 Six
Dutch-Flemish PROMIS pediatric measures (Scale V2.0 - Anger28, CAT V2.0 - Peer Relationships29,
Scale V1.0 - Global health (7+2)30, CAT V1.0 - Sleep-related Impairment31, CAT V2.0 - Anxiety32, and
CAT V2.0 - Depressive Symptoms32) were completed by children and adolescents. All PROMIS
measures use a 7-day recall period, and items are scored on a five-point Likert scale. All items range
from ‘never’ to ‘(almost) always’ except for Global Health, where response categories differ for each
item (e.g. ‘excellent’ to ‘poor’). Total scores are calculated by transforming the item scores into a Tscore which has a mean of 50 and standard deviation (SD) of 10 in the U.S. general population. For all
measures higher scores represent more of the construct. For Anger (9 items) and Global Health (7+2
items) all items were administered. The US item parameters were used in the CAT algorithm and Tscore calculations, as by PROMIS convention.
COVID-19–related additional questions
Three closed-ended questions were added for parents about whether there was a negative change in work
situation of one of the parents/caregivers due to COVID-19 regulations (e.g., loss of income, reduced
number of working hours, unemployment), whether a friend or relative had been infected with COVID19 and if the child still attended child care/school during lockdown (e.g., both parents performing
essential occupations).
Children and adolescents were asked to complete three COVID-19-specific questions: ‘How did
you experience the atmosphere at home before the schools were closed?’ and ‘How do you experience
the atmosphere at home now?’ rated on a visual analogue scale (VAS) ranging from 0 ‘Not pleasant at
all’ to 100 ‘Very pleasant’, and an open-ended question ‘How are the corona-regulations for you?’.
Statistical analyses
For all statistical analyses the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS), version 26.0, was used.
First, descriptive analyses (mean and percentages) were used to characterize the participants in
the different samples. To compare samples, independent T-tests (for continuous variables) or chi-square
tests of independence (for categorical variables) were performed.
Second, to test whether mental and social health of the sample during COVID-19 differed from
the sample before COVID-19 on PROMIS T-scores, a one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was
performed per PROMIS domain, adjusted for differences in sociodemographic characteristics. Mean
differences (95% CI) were reported. A mean difference in domain T-scores of 0.25 SDs was considered
meaningful.33

Percentages of children and adolescents reporting ‘severe’ symptoms or ‘poor’ functioning on
the PROMIS measures before and during the COVID lockdown were compared. Severe symptoms or
poor functioning was defined as a T-score 1.5 SD above or below the mean T-score before COVID-19
respectively, except for Peer Relationships, where 2 SD was used as cut-off for poor functioning (see
www.HealthMeasures.net). Differences in proportions of severe scores were tested using chi-squares
tests of independence and the relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were reported.
The RR represents the risk of a child measured during the COVID-19 lockdown having a severe score
compared to before COVID-19. A ratio >1 indicates more risk.
Third, to determine which variables were significantly associated with mental and social health
during the COVID-19 lockdown, a multivariable linear regression analysis was performed for each
PROMIS domain. The following variables were included as independent variables: age, gender, parental
country of birth, marital status, region, number of children in the family, parental educational level,
change in work situation due to COVID-19 regulations, infected relative/friend with COVID-19 and if
the child still attended child care/school during lockdown. No multicollinearity was present between
these variables (all correlations <.50). Per domain the effect size of all independent variables was
reported, expressed as unstandardized regression coefficient B (95% CI).
Fourth, to investigate changes in atmosphere at home a paired T-test was used to test the
difference between the two single items. Mean difference (95% CI) was reported.
Fifth, to assess the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on the daily life of children, the open
ended question ‘How are the corona-regulations for you?’ was qualitatively analyzed (by LT and HAvO)
using thematic analysis.34 The answers were categorized into positive, neutral or negative experiences
and thereafter clustered into themes. Themes were ranked according to their frequency of occurrence
(high to low).

Results
Sociodemographic characteristics
During the COVID-19 lockdown, 844 children participated. This sample showed similar characteristics
(most variables within 2.5% from each other) compared to the sample collected before COVID-19 (total
N=2401). Significant differences were found on four variables (Table 1); age (during M=13.4 (SD=2.80)
versus before M=13.1 (SD=3.14), mean difference=0.3; 95% CI, -0.54 – -0.06), both parents born in the
Netherlands (during 88.2% versus before 79.8%, χ2(1)=29.884, p<0.001), parents with a low educational
level (during 9.0% versus before 12.8%, χ2(2)=7.470, p=0.024), and families with one child (during
25.5% versus before 15.5%, χ2(2)=44.728, p<0.001).
[Insert Table 1]
Differences in mental and social health in children and adolescents during versus before the
COVID-19 lockdown
During the COVID-19 lockdown, children and adolescents reported worse T-scores than children and
adolescents before the COVID-19 lockdown on all PROMIS domains, after controlling for age, parental
country of birth, parental educational level and number of children (absolute mean difference range,
2.06–7.05; absolute 95% CI range, 1.25–7.86) (Table 2). Largest differences were found for Anxiety
(mean difference=7.1, 95% CI, 6.2-7.9) and Depressive Symptoms (mean difference=4.9; 95% CI, 4.0–
5.7).
Significantly more children reported severe Anxiety (during 16.7% versus before 8.6%; RR,
1.95; 95% CI, 1.55–2.46) and severe Sleep-Related Impairment (during 11.5% versus before 6.1%; RR,
1.89; 95% CI 1.29–2.78) during the COVID-19 lockdown than before COVID-19 (Table 3). Fewer
children reported poor Global Health (during 1.7% versus before 4.6%; RR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.20–0.65).
[Insert Table 2 & 3]
Variables associated with poor mental and social health in children and adolescents during the
COVID-19 lockdown
Lower Global Health was associated with a single-parent family (B=-3.00; 95% CI, -4.23 – -1.76).
Lower Peer Relationships were reported by boys compared to girls (B=-1.25; 95% CI, -2.23 – -0.27) .
Increased Anxiety was associated with age (B=-0.34; 95% CI, -0.53 – -0.15), a single-parent family
(B=1.46; 95% CI, 0.11–2.81), an infected relative or friend (B=1.94; 95% CI, 0.72–3.16) and parents
with a negative change in work (B=3.01; 95% CI, 1.84–4.18). More Depressive Symptoms was
associated highly educated parents (where intermediate differed from lower; B=2.24; 95% CI, 0.23–
4.24) and parents with a negative change in work situation (B=2.45; 95% CI, 1.20–3.70). More Anger
was associated with age (B=-0.47; 95% CI, -0.67 – -0.28), highly educated parents (where intermediate

situation (B=1.71; 95% CI, 0.45–2.98). Finally, more Sleep-Related Impairment was related to the
country of birth of parents (≥ one foreign parent; B=1.95; 95% CI, 0.13–3.77), a single parent family
(B=2.07; 95% CI, 0.53–3.62) and parents with a negative change in work (B=2.53; 95% CI, 1.19–3.87)
(Table 4).

Changes in atmosphere at home during the COVID-19 lockdown
Children and adolescents reported a worse atmosphere (mean difference=-3.1; 95% CI, -4.1 – -2.1) at
home during the COVID-19 lockdown (M=78.2, SD=17.9) than before COVID-19 (M=81.4, SD=16.0).
Impact of COVID-19 regulations on the daily life of children
The majority (~90%) of children indicated that the COVID-19 lockdown had a negative impact on their
daily life. The most often mentioned issues (>50 children) were: 1) missing contact with friends, 2) not
allowed to go to school, 3) missing freedom, 4) not allowed to participate in sports, 5) missing joyful
activities (e.g., birthdays, holidays, parties, shopping), 6) difficulties with homeschooling 7) missing
extended family, and 8) boredom (Table 5). A minority of children did not experience any difficulties
with the COVID-19 lockdown regulations (~7%) (e.g., ‘It does not bother me’) or reported positive
consequences (~3%) (e.g., ‘I really like that I can play with children in my neighborhood all day long’).

Discussion
This study compared the mental and social health of a representative sample of children and adolescents
from the general population during the COVID-19 lockdown to a similar sample of children and
adolescents before COVID-19. Children and adolescents reported poorer mental and social health during
the COVID-19 lockdown on all six PROMIS domains. Substantial differences in percentages of children
reporting severe anxiety and sleep-related impairments were observed. Fewer children and adolescents
reported a poor global health during the COVID-19 lockdown, although the mean global health score
was lower in this sample as compared to the sample before COVID-19. Significant associations with
mental and social health complaints during the COVID-19 lockdown were found for family composition
(growing up in a single-parent family or having three or more children in the family), a negative change
in work situation of parents due to COVID-19 regulations, and an infected relative/friend with COVID19. Children and adolescents reported a small decrease in atmosphere at home during the lockdown. The
majority of children and adolescents revealed a negative impact of the COVID-19 regulations on their
daily life, that far outweigh the number of children who reported a positive effect. Especially missing
contact with friends was considered important.
The results of this study confirm the suspicions of child and youth care professionals that the
COVID-19 lockdown has negative effects on mental and social health of children and adolescents. In
opinion papers, professionals elaborated on the vulnerability of this group and expected more feelings
of loneliness, anxiety and depression, as well as a more tense atmosphere at home.14-17 Concerns were
also expressed that the COVID-19 lockdown would lead to an increase in inequality and that children
and families with lower social economic status would be more susceptible to mental health issues.15,18,19
Although this study could not definitely confirm these concerns, children from single parent families,
from families with three or more children, and with parents who had a negative change in work situation
reported more mental and social health problems during the COVID-19 lockdown.
While the Dutch partial lockdown was substantially different from the Chinese full lockdown,
our results are in line with the three studies from China,21-23 who also reported higher anxiety and
depressive symptom during the COVID-19 lockdown. Likewise, one of the Chinese studies also found
that having an infected relative/friend with COVID-19 was predictive of more anxiety.23 In addition to
the effects on anxiety and depressive symptoms, our study results show negative effects of the COVID19 lockdown on anger, sleep-related impairment and peer relationships.
Although the mean T-score on Global Health was lower (worse) in the sample during the
lockdown as compared to before COVID-19, a lower percentage of children and adolescents reported
poor Global Health during COVID-19. This finding is puzzling and prompts further study in a followup design that is underway in our department.
Some limitations of this study need to be taken into account. Although the aim was to obtain
two representative samples that were completely comparable, small differences were found on age,
parental country of birth and educational level, and family composition. However, these differences

were corrected for in our comparisons between the groups. In addition, the data collection during
COVID-19 took place in April and May (2020), whereas the study data collection before COVID on
anxiety and depression mainly took place in January and February (2018). Worse mental health is often
reported during winter times.35 This difference could have led to an underestimation of the actual impact
of the COVID-19 lockdown.
We found that children and adolescents from families with certain risk factors (e.g. single parent
families) are more vulnerable to mental and social health problems. These children and adolescents
should be in sight of health care professionals. However, in this study children and adolescents with
existing mental or somatic problems were not included, while it is conceivable that these groups are
even more vulnerable. More research is needed to study the mental and social health of these groups as
well as to gain insight in the longitudinal effects, and to clarify if lower mental and social health scores
are mainly due to the COVID-19 pandemic or the lockdown.
During the finalization of this paper, the Netherlands, and many other countries, are facing a
second COVID-19 wave. This study showed that governmental regulations regarding lockdown pose a
serious mental and social health threat on children and adolescents that should be brought to the forefront
of political decision making and mental health care policy, intervention and prevention.
