Abstract:

17

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on human society. The isolation of

18

SARS-CoV-2 from patients’ feces on human cell line raised concerns of possible transmission

19

through human feces including exposure to aerosols generated by toilet flushing and through

20

the indoor drainage system. Currently, routes of transmission, other than the close contact

21

droplet transmission, are still not well understood. A quantitative microbial risk assessment was

22

conducted to estimate the health risks associated with two aerosol exposure scenarios: 1) toilet

23

flushing, and 2) faulty connection of a floor drain with the building’s main sewer pipe.

24

SARS-CoV-2 data were collected from the emerging literature. The infectivity of the virus in

25

feces was estimated based on a range of assumption between viral genome equivalence and

26

infectious unit. The human exposure dose was calculated using Monte Carlo simulation of viral

27

concentrations in aerosols under each scenario and human breathing rates. The probability of

28

COVID-19 illness was generated using the dose-response model for SARS-CoV-1, a close

29

relative of SARS-CoV-2, that was responsible for the SARS outbreak in 2003. The results

30

indicate the median risks of developing COVID-19 for a single day exposure is 1.11 x 10-10 and

31

3.52 x 10-11 for toilet flushing and faulty drain scenario, respectively. The worst case scenario

32

predicted the high end of COVID-19 risk for the toilet flushing scenario was 5.78 x 10-4 (at 95th

33

percentile). The infectious viral loads in human feces are the most sensitive input parameter and

34

contribute significantly to model uncertainty.

1. Introduction

39

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic1 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome

40

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has had a profound impact on human society and the world

41

economy2-3. Despite the time and money invested in COVID-19 research and medical

42

treatments around the world4-8, at the time of this writing, the diverse routes of transmission and

43

effective treatment methods for this disease are still unclear. The fecal-oral transmission of

44

SARS-CoV-2 has been a concern9 since the first detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from patients’

45

feces10. However, the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in feces and its hazard to human health is an

46

ongoing debate although high concentrations of viral RNA have been found in both patient’s

47

feces11-13 and in human sewage14. Only a handful of papers10, 15-17 reported the isolation of

48

infectious viruses from feces on human tissue culture. The most recent report by Zang et al.13

49

provides evidence of SARS-CoV-2 replication in human small intestine but shows that most of

50

the viruses are inactivated by simulated colonic fluid. This report explains the low frequency of

51

viral isolation from fecal samples but it does not rule out the presence of infectious viruses in

52

the patients’ feces as demonstrated by the other studies.10, 15-17 The rate of inactivation as the

53

viruses passing through colon is likely dependent on time and protective effect of fecal material

54

in colon. A fraction of viruses may survive the passage. Another contributor for the low

55

frequency of fecal viral isolation on tissue culture may be due to the difficulties of measuring

56

infectious virus in feces. Multiple purification steps are necessary to remove bacteria and other

57

interferences before the samples can be loaded onto cell cultures. Such purification steps

58

perhaps can inactivate or remove SARS-CoV-2. The methodological challenges can result in

59

the uncertainties of the number of infectious virus in feces. However, based on what we know

60

so far, the hazard of SARS-CoV-2 in feces seems likely to be real.

61

One of the possible transmission routes of fecal derived SARS-CoV-2 is through aerosols

62

generated from toilet flushing and through indoor plumbing in multi-unit apartment buildings.

63

The public concern was heightened by a report of high concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 virus in

64

the aerosols of toilet rooms in two Wuhan hospitals18. Toilet flushing may release virus-laden

65

aerosols and result in exposure19-20 of healthy individuals sharing the same bathroom.

66

Furthermore, the commonly known sewer smell in bathrooms of multi-unit apartment building

67

is suspected to be due to aerosols drawn in from the building’s main sewer pipe19, 21, which may

68

contain viruses from neighbors’ toilets. The massive 2003 SARS outbreak in a condominium

69

complex in Hong Kong, known as Amoy Gardens is still a fresh memory among many. The

70

Amoy Gardens outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-1, a close relative of SARS-CoV-2, resulted in

71

321 cases of infection in the condominium complex. Investigations by the authority attributed

72

the transmission to the indoor plumbing that drew contaminated aerosols from the patient’s

73

toilet through the main sewer pipe connecting to different units in the same building19, 22-23.

74

In the last 20 years, researchers have investigated transmission risks from indoor plumbing

75

and ventilation systems to provide recommendations for building construction and

76

maintenance19,

77

transmission through indoor plumbing that delivers potable water or cooling water in multi-unit

78

apartment buildings24-26. Building drainage systems in multi-unit apartment buildings are

79

commonly served by a main sewer pipe, called a soil-stack (Fig. 1). Toilet flushing pushes

80

human waste through the soil-pipe to the building’s main sewer soil-stack before leaving the

81

building. However, viruses in feces can attach to the pipe wall and be present in sewer gas

82

(aerosol) long after the waste has left the building. According to a recent laboratory decay study,

22

. Notably a number of studies have investigated the risk of Legionella

83

SARS-CoV-2 can remain infective on metal and plastic surfaces for hours (the median half-life

84

is around 13 hours on stainless steel and 16 hours on plastic surface) and has a median half-life

85

of 2.7 hours in aerosol at 20°C27. The building’s main sewer soil-stack is connected to the floor

86

drains and drains for sink, shower, and bathtub through a P-trap (Fig. 1). In normal situations,

87

the P-trap retains a little bit of water after each use of the appliance. The water serves as a

88

barrier to block the smell and aerosol from the main sewer pipe. When water in the P-trap

89

evaporates, aerosols from the main sewer pipe can be drawn directly to individual bathrooms

90

(commonly known as sewer smell in bathroom).

91

This study addresses the concerns of the aerosol generation from toilet flushing and their

92

persistence in building drainage system28-29 using a quantitative microbial risk assessment

93

(QMRA) for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Two possible transmission scenarios are analyzed: 1)

94

inhalation of aerosols from toilet flushing of patient feces by a healthy person sharing the toilet

95

room; and 2) inhalation of contaminated aerosols from the main sewer pipe entering the

96

bathroom through a faulty floor drain by a neighboring resident. SARS-CoV-2 viral loads in

97

human feces were collected from emerging literature reporting fecal viral loads11-12, 16, 18, 30. To

98

compare and supplement the SARS-CoV-2 transmission model, SARS-CoV-1 data that caused

99

the SARS outbreak in 2003 were also compiled from literature. SARS-CoV-2 exhibits long

100

infectivity in aerosols, which is similar to SARS-CoV-127. The similarities in genome

101

sequences, human cell receptor for viral entry, and the environmental persistence between

102

SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-127 suggest that biological parameters for SARS-CoV-1 may be

103

used as substitutes for SARS-CoV-2 in the absence of the SARS-CoV-2 specific data for risk

104

quantification. In the absence of data on SARS-CoV-2, data on SARS-CoV-1 may be the best

105

proxy.

2. Materials and Methods

109

2.1 Viral Concentration in Toilet Water and Aerosols

110

Many studies reported the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients’ feces11-12, 16,

111

18, 30-33

112

feces using qPCR11-12, 16, 30. Pan et al.30 reported 9 of 17 positive samples with a range of viral

113

concentrations between 103 and 105 genome copies (gc) of viral RNA/mL of liquid stool sample

114

(Table S1). The viral load varied over the course of the disease but was within 2 orders of

115

magnitude. Wolfel et al.11 reported positive detection in 68 of 81 samples over 21 days for

116

multiple COVID-19 patients. The SARS-CoV-2 concentrations ranged between 102 and over

117

107 gc/ gram of feces (Table S1). More recently, Zheng et al.12 followed patients for 60 days

118

and detected 55 positive samples among 93 samples tested and reported the concentration in the

119

range of less than 102 and over 108 gc/mL of feces (Table S1). Xiao et al.16 followed a single

120

patient and quantified the viral load in feces by qPCR but used a standard curve based on

121

known plaque forming unit (pfu). The viral load was expressed as pfu equivalence /mL of feces

122

but indicated that fecal viral load does not necessarily imply infectivity.

. At the time of this analysis, only a handful of the studies quantified viral load in human

123

The raw data reported in Pan et al.30 were provided to this study by the authors upon

124

request. Individual data points from each of the other three reports were extracted from

125

published figures using GetData Graph Digitizer34. In addition, a SARS-CoV-2 concentration of

126

19 gc/m3 of air measured directly in the aerosol from a hospital toilet room was also included in

127

the analysis18. The data described above are compiled in Table S1 and the viral concentration in

128

aerosols was assumed to be produced solely from flushing patients’ feces down the toilet.

129

To compare and contrast SARS-CoV-2 viral load in feces, we also searched and compiled

130

data for SARS-CoV-1. As shown in Table S1, SARS-CoV-1 viral loads varied more

131

significantly over the course of disease according to three different studies35-37. The

132

SARS-CoV-1 concentration expanded over 6 orders of magnitude among different individuals

133

and at different stages of disease.

134

Note that the viral concentration was reported as liquid volume of feces except in the study

135

by Wolfel et al.11, in which viral RNA gc/gram was given (Table S1). Wolfel et al.11 indicated

136

that the COVID-19 patients included in the study only had very mild symptoms and diarrhea

137

was uncommon. To compile the data set, the values in per gram of feces were transformed to

138

values in per mL using a fecal density of 0.97 g/mL38. The fecal viral concentration for both

139

SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 were plotted in histograms and fitted with a cumulative

140

density function curve shown in Fig. 2. The negative detections in each report were treated as

141

below the lowest detection limit of 1.95 log10gc/mL by qPCR assay (Table S2). The values

142

were generated by randomly sampling a uniform distribution U(0,1.95) for the fraction of

143

negative detection reported (Fig. 2). Similarly, the below detection values for SARS-CoV-1

144

data were generated using U(0,0.35).

145

The three data points from Xiao et al.16 was not included in the SARS-CoV-2 data

146

distribution curve because they were expressed as pfu/mL. Instead a triangular(2.52, 2.97, 3.37)

147

distribution was used to capture the range of viral load from this report (Table S2). The only

148

direct toilet room aerosol measurement of 19 gc/m3 air was used as a single point estimate in

149

risk analysis to represent an event as “aerosol measurement”.

161

uncertainty. Previous studies of SARS-CoV-1 reported a wide range of conversion factor for

162

viral genome number to infections unit (pfu), from 360:1 to 1600:140-41. To include the

163

uncertainty, a triangular(360, 980, 1600) distribution was used to capture the variability of this

164

parameter (Table S2). Note that this conversion was not applied to the data reported by Xiao et

165

al.16 since the fecal load was presented as pfu/mL. In the toilet, the patient’s stool was assumed

166

to be completely mixed with flushing water. Thus, viral concentration in the flushing water

167

after defecation (𝐶!",!",! , in gc/mL) is calculated using equation 1:

where 𝐶!,!",! is the concentration of virus in feces (gc/mL), 𝑉! is the volume of human

concentration as the toilet water post defecation. The detailed data and assumptions are

presented in Table S2.

2.2 Exposure Assessment for Aerosol Inhalation

180

Two exposure scenarios were considered to represent the generic living conditions in a

181

multi-unit apartment building. The first scenario considers a shared bathroom by two suitemates

182

in the same apartment suite. One resident is a COVID-19 patient under self-quarantine in

183

his/her own room. The second scenario considers a COVID-19 patient under self-quarantine in

184

an isolated apartment in the building. A neighbor in the apartment one floor below the patient’s

185

apartment shares the main sewer soil-stack and has a floor drain missing water-seal to block the

186

aerosol from the sewer pipe (Fig. 1).

187

2.2.1 Toilet- flushing scenario

188

Under scenario 1, the aerosol concentration in the toilet room generated after a toilet

189

flushing was adopted from a study by O’Toole et al.42. Since the aerosol concentrations were

190

collected at different heights above the toilet in the original study, we adopted data collected at

191

a sampling height of 420 mm above the toilet to represent aerosol concentrations inhaled by a

192

person when using the toilet (Table S3). O’Toole et al.42 also showed a bimodal distribution of

193

two median diameter aerosol sizes, d1=0.6 µm and d2=2.5 µm, at this height42. Although several

194

other studies43-44 also reported the mass of aerosols generated by toilet flushing, the data were

195

not comparable with the O’Toole et al.42 due to different types of toilet and different

196

measurement approaches. These data were not included in aerosol estimation due to the need

197

for assumptions of air volume and dispersion rate in the toilet room, which could induce

198

additional uncertainty.

199

The decay of SARS-CoV-2 in the toilet-generated aerosols was computed using the

200

half-life of 2.7 hours reported by van Doremalen et al.27. The healthy suitemate was assumed to

201

be exposed to contaminated aerosols once a day between 0 and 2 hours after the patient flushed

202

the fecal waste using U(0,2). The risk of exposure declines with the time after the prior flush

203

due to viral decay in aerosols.

204

The aerosol deposition efficiencies in human respiratory tract were derived from Heyder’s

205

study45 , which was reported as a function of particle size and breathing patterns. The aerosol

206

inhalation efficiency was based on an individuals’ breathing pattern during light activities46.

207

The duration of exposure for the healthy individual was set using a uniform distribution of 10 to

208

30 minutes U(10,30) to represent the various activities from urination to defecation and hand

209

washing in the bathroom.

210

The dose of virus (𝐷𝑜𝑠𝑒!",! , in pfu/case) inhaled and deposited in the healthy resident’s

211

respiratory tract under the toilet flushing scenario was estimated using equation 3:

212

𝐷𝑜𝑠𝑒!",! = 𝐶!",!"#,! ∙ 𝐷𝑜𝑠𝑒!,!" ∙ 𝐷𝑒𝑐! ∙ 𝑀𝐹𝑅! ∙ 𝐷𝑢𝑟!

(3)

213

where 𝐷𝑜𝑠𝑒!,!" is the mass of aerosol according to median diameter size (di) deposited in

214

the exposed person’s respiratory tract (L/L of air), 𝐷𝑒𝑐! is the decay rate of virus in aerosols,

215

𝑀𝐹𝑅! is the mean flow rate of air breathed by the exposed person (L of air/min), and 𝐷𝑢𝑟! is

216

the time spent in the toilet room each exposure event (min/case). The 𝐷𝑜𝑠𝑒!,!" in equation 3

217

was derived using equation 4:
𝐷𝑜𝑠𝑒!,!" =

218

(𝐶!,!",!! ∙ 𝑉!,!",!! ∙ 𝐸!"#,!! )

(4)

219

where 𝐶!,!",!! is the concentration of aerosols in the specific height above toilet after each

220

toilet flush (# of aerosol/L of air) at range of diameter size (𝑑! , in 𝜇𝑚), 𝑉!,!",!! is the volume

221

of spherical aerosol (L/# of aerosol) , 𝐸!"#,!! is the deposition efficiency of aerosols according

222

to size in respiratory tract (unitless). The decay of virus in aerosols was calculated using

227

SARS-CoV-2 in aerosol (min) according to van Doremalen et al.27. Parameters and assumptions

228

used are summarized in Table S3.

229

2.2.2 Faulty drain scenario

230

In this scenario, aerosols containing virus were assumed to be generated from the same

231

flushing water and were suspending along the entire sewer soil-stack after the waste passed

232

through the pipe. The aerosols in the sewer pipe were characterized once again by data from

233

O’Toole’s study42 for samples collected immediately above the toilet (50 mm). A worst-case

234

assumption was made that a ventilation fan drew all contaminated aerosols in the soil-stack pipe

235

(0.1 m diameter and 2.8 m long between two floors) into the toilet room at the apartment

236

one-story below through a floor drain that is missing the water-seal (Fig. 1). A toilet room size

237

of 3 m2 x 2.4 m height, a typical toilet room in Amoy Gardens, was used to calculate the aerosol

238

concentration. The dispersion of the aerosols in the toilet room was assumed to follow a

239

Uniform(𝑙𝑜𝑔!" 0.03,0) distribution.

240

Inhalation of polluted aerosols by the neighbor in the apartment below when using the

241

toilet was modeled in the same way as the toilet flushing scenario. The dose of viruses through

242

the faulty drain with no water seal (𝐷𝑜𝑠𝑒!",! , pfu/event) deposited in the exposed person’s

243

respiratory tract was estimated using the equation 6:

244

𝐷𝑜𝑠𝑒!",! = 𝐶!",!"#,! ∙ 𝐷𝑜𝑠𝑒!,!" ∙ 𝐷𝑒𝑐! ∙ 𝑀𝐹𝑅! ∙ 𝐷𝑢𝑟!

(6)

245

where 𝐷𝑜𝑠𝑒!,!" is the mass of aerosol according to median diameter size (dfd, 𝑖𝑛 𝜇𝑚)

246

deposited in the exposed person’s respiratory tract (L/L of air) in faulty drain scenario. It was

247

calculated using equation 7:

249

251

the dispersion rate of aerosol (unitless) in the toilet room. Parameters and assumptions used in

252

this scenario are also summarized in Table S3.

253

The doses of exposure under different scenarios were compared. The simulated doses from

254

fecal viral load were also compared with the exposure dose calculated using the SARS-CoV-2

255

concentration measured directly from the hospital toilet room18. Moreover, the model derived

256

dose for SARS-CoV-1 under faulty drain scenario was compared to the dose estimated by

257

Watanabe et al.47 in Amoy Gardens using a back calculation of attack rate and the

258

dose-response model.

259

2.3 Dose-response Assessment

260

There has not been a dose-response model developed for SARS-CoV-2 for human or

261

animals. SARS-CoV-2 shares 79% nucleic acid sequence identity to SARS-CoV-1, and uses the

262

same cell entry receptor (ACE2) as SARS-CoV-148. Structural analysis revealed SARS-CoV-2

263

protein binds ACE2 with 10-20 folds higher affinity than SARS-CoV-1, which indicates that

264

SARS-CoV-2 may be more infectious to humans than SARS-CoV-148. Moreover,

265

SARS-CoV-2 triggers receptor dependent cell-cell fusion that helps the virus rapidly spread

266

from cell-to-cell49. The basic reproductive values (R0) of COVID-19 at the early stage were

267

calculated between 2 and 3.5, indicating that infected people on average could infect two to

268

more than three other people, which was higher than SARS50. The effective reproduction

269

number may be much lower due to less-susceptible hosts such as young adults4, 51-52. This

270

infective pattern of SARS-CoV-2 is highly similar to SARS-CoV-153. Based on the comparative

271

biological property of the two viruses, we adopted SARS-CoV-1 dose-response model47 for

272

SARS-CoV-2. To manage the uncertainty of this model, the probability distribution of 𝑘 value

273

in the exponential dose-response model was incorporated in the simulation to determine its

274

impact on the uncertainty of model output. The normal distribution lnN(6.01,1.75) as originally

275

reported for SARS-CoV-1 dose-response by Watanabe et al.47 was used in the simulation.

276

Moreover, the 𝑘 was customized to SARS-CoV-2 by including the enhanced infectivity factor

277

using uniform distribution U(10, 20) to capture the 10 to 20 times higher cell-receptor affinity

278

and viral spread through cells. Since it is currently unclear that the ACE2 receptor binding

279

affinity would linearly translate to infectivity in doses, this general model was subjected to

280

sensitivity analysis. Therefore, the same dose-response model (equation 8) for SARS-CoV-1

281

and SARS-CoV-2 was used with the different best fit 𝑘 value.

The parameters used in the dose-response assessments are presented in (Table S4).
2.4 Risk Characterization

285

To estimate the risk of developing COVID-19 by the suitemate or the downstairs neighbor,

286

we assume a once-a-day encounter rate of polluted aerosols over a 15-day course of disease

287

(Table S4). The estimations were carried out using equation 9 and the illness rate for

288

COVID-19 was compared to the simulated outcomes for SARS, to provide a relative risk

2.5 Monte Carlo Simulation and Sensitivity Analysis

299

The pseudo-algorithm information flow is shown in Figure S1. The input parameters were

300

randomly sampled from their established probability distributions. 100,000 iterations of each

301

output parameter were computed to ensure the distributions reach a steady state.

302

Reproducibility of the outputs is examined by a variation of less than 1%54. All computations

303

were carried using MATLAB R2019b55.

304

A sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine which model inputs were the most

305

influential contributors to the predicted illness risk. The rank of importance was introduced

306

through incorporation of parameter sensitivity with the relative order of uncertainty to assess

307

the confidence in the model. The importance factor (𝐼) contributing to illness risk for each input

308

parameter (unitless) was calculated using equation 10:
𝐼 =𝑆∙𝑅

309
310
311

(10)

where 𝑆 is the sensitivity of illness risk related to the input parameter, and 𝑅 is the
coefficient of variation of the input parameter.

312

𝑆 was assessed by a local sensitivity analysis method to represent the variability

313

propagation of input parameters through modeling of the health risk. The true means of

314

distributions (or the values of point-estimates) were adopted as baseline point values for each

315

input parameter and output variable. Then the baseline input parameter 𝑃! value was

316

decreased by 10%, and a differential value for output variable 𝑋! was calculated as shown in

3. Results and discussion

336

3.1 Comparison of Exposure Dose Under Different Scenarios

337

The exposure doses of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 per event under different scenarios

338

are presented in Fig. 3. The simulated doses based on fecal load had a bimodal distribution

339

because of the inclusion of non-detectable results. The median values for SARS-CoV-1 and 2

340

were similar, in the range of 1.15 to 8.45 x 10-9 pfu per exposure event (see Table S5 for

341

summary descriptors). However, comparing the two viruses, SARS-CoV-1 had a wide range of

342

exposure dose with a long flat tail (95th percentile is 1.58 x 10-3 pfu for toilet flushing scenario)

343

on the right side of the distribution curve (Fig. 3 and Table S5).

344

Using fecal load data reported by Xiao et al.16 (in pfu/mL) to calculate the exposure dose

345

shifted the median exposure dose to the right by over 2 to 3 log10 units (Fig. 3, Table S5).

346

However, this exposure dose was likely an overestimation of infectious SARS-CoV-2 because

347

the authors of the fecal shedding study indicated that the pfu equivalent numbers reported do

348

not indicate infectivity number16. It is important to note that the pfu equivalent presented in

349

Xiao et al. is not the same as the viral infectious unit presented elsewhere in the study. The

350

worst case scenario of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 was represented by exposure to an aerosol

351

concentration measured directly in the hospital’s toilet room (Fig. 3). The median exposure

352

dose of this scenario was 5.34 x 10-5 pfu per exposure event (Table S5).

353

There is a dramatic mismatch when comparing the exposure dose estimated based on any

354

of the scenario with the exposure dose calculated by Watanabe et al.47. Watanabe et al. based

355

their estimaion on the attack rate in Amoy Gardens and the dose-response relationship derived

356

using an animal model (Figure 3). The explanations for the mismatch are complicated and may

357

include the following reasons.

358

1) Watanabe et al.47 assumed that all infections in Amoy Gardens were resulting from the

359

faulty drainage system in the building and calculated the attack rate based on estimated number

360

of residents per unit. This attack rate may be an overestimation because other modes of

361

transmission (i.e. surface contact and in person transmission in shared elevators or space)

362

besides aerosols through faulty drains were not considered56-57.

363

2) Our aerosol concentrations are underestimated by several orders of magnitude. Since the

364

initial infectious viral load (pfu) in feces is a sensitive input parameter that influences the

365

aerosol dose in the toilet room, the major uncertainty could be from the conversion of viral

366

genome copy to infectious unit. We used SARS-CoV-1 as the surrogate to get the conversion

367

factor from laboratory studies by different researchers40-41. We used triangular distribution to

368

derive the range. The outcomes of the conversion were ~100 times lower than the report

369

presented by Xiao et al.16 who used pfu equivalent directly as the standard curve in the

370

estimation of viral load in feces. Another source of underestimation is from the literature reports

371

of fecal loading among COVID-19 patients. The data collected in this study include a total of

372

191 human fecal samples (exclude the 3 samples form Xiao et al.16) at different stage of disease

373

development. It represents the state of knowledge at the time of this analysis.

374

3) The dose-response model derived from animal study and used by Watanabe et al.47 in

375

model fitting is an overestimation of the infectious dose of the SARS-CoV-1. Based on the

376

animal trial study58-59, the SARS-CoV-1 requires higher dose of infectious than HCoV-229E,

377

the common human cold virus. The SARS-CoV-1 dose-response was investigated using

378

genetically modified mice, which may not be a good representation of human infection rate.

379

Based on these above analyses, the unmatched dose in aerosol exposure between Watanabe

380

et al.47 and our model prediction cannot be easily resolved. The uncertainty analysis that

incorporates the sensitivity with the coefficient of variation of the input parameter (as presented

382

in the section 3.3) weighs the importance of the input parameters to the model outcomes. This

first attempt at the risk analysis of the specific scenario offers a starting point for looking into

data collection needs.

391

3.2. Risk Quantification Per Exposure Event and Per Course of Disease

392

Fig. 4 shows the outcomes of risk estimation for different scenarios. The median

393

COVID-19 illness risk for a single day exposure is 1.11 x 10-10 and 3.52 x 10-11 for toilet

394

flushing (Fig 4a and Table S6a) and faulty drain (Fig 4b and Table S6a) scenario, respectively.

395

These values are nearly one log higher in comparison with the SARS illness risk predicted

396

using SARS-CoV-1 fecal loading estimation, which have a median value of 1.75 x 10-11 for

397

toilet flushing and 5.5 x 10-12 for the faulty drain scenario (Table S6a). However, there is a large

398

variability of predicted risk for SARS with the 95th percentile risk of 5.28 x 10-6 and 1.82 x 10-6

399

for toilet flushing and faulty drain scenario, respectively. The corresponding 95th percentile

400

risks for COVID-19 are 1 to 1.5 log lower.

401

Xiao et al.’s fecal load data16 predicted much higher risks for both scenarios with the

402

median risk in the order of 10-8 and 95th percentile risk in the order of 10-6 (Fig. 4 and Table

403

S6a). The estimates for exposure to contaminated aerosols in the hospital toilet room yielded a

404

median risk value of 1.9 x 10-6 and 95th percentile risk of 3.85 x 10-5 for each single exposure

405

(Table 6a).

406

When multiple exposures were considered over the 15-day course of the disease, assuming

407

once a day exposure frequency, the estimated risk of COVID-19 increased by approximately

408

one log for all scenarios (Fig 4c,d and Table S6b). Again, these values were about one log

409

higher than median illness risks for SARS under the same scenarios but SARS outcomes

410

spanned a much greater range (Fig. 4 c, d and Table 6S). The worst case scenario, exposure to

411

aerosol in a hospital toilet room used by multiple patients, predicted the high end of COVID-19

412

risk for toilet flushing scenario at 5.78 x 10-4 (95th percentile). Comparing risks from the toilet

413

flushing with the faulty drain scenario, it’s obvious that direct exposure to aerosols generated

414

from toilet flushing had greater risk than exposure to aerosols entered from a faulty drain in the

415

building (Fig. 4).

416

These risk estimates are at odds with the conclusion of Amoy Gardens’ investigation,

417

where the epidemiological study presented a very different picture, a much higher attack rate

418

from the faulty drain scenario. The uncertainties of a number of input parameters in the model

419

are worthy of analysis to offer better insights into the discrepancies observed from the two

420

investigations. These input parameters include the concentration of viruses in the feces, the

421

conversion factor from genome equivalent of virus to infectious unit, the daily fecal volume, the

422

toilet flushing water volume, the aerosols generated during toilet flushing, the duration of

423

exposure in the toilet room, the viral decay and the best fit parameter for dose-response model.

424

3.3 Sensitivity Analysis and Model Uncertainties

425

The analyses for model uncertainties were assessed using the joint estimation of local

426

sensitivity of each parameter and the coefficient of variant for the parameter to evaluate the

427

relative order of uncertainty. Note that the analysis was only carried out for models starting

428

with genome equivalent SARS-CoV-2 fecal loadings. The single aerosol measurement from the

429

hospital toilet room was not a good representation of the normal living condition in the

430

multi-unit apartment building and only presented here as the worst case scenario. The results

431

showed that the concentration of genome equivalent virus in toilet flushing water (𝐶!",!",!! )

432

was the most important input parameter in the risk estimation for both scenarios (Fig. 5).

433

Variability of this parameter contributed to 48% of the variability of model outcome and

434

represented the most uncertainty. The conversion factor (PFU/GC) that bridges the genome

435

copies of virus to pfu of the infectious virus, in comparison, was only a minor contributor (1 to

436

2% of variability) to the overall model outcome (Fig. 5). The concentration of aerosols in the
20

437

toilet room (𝐶!,!",!! and 𝐶!,!",!!" ) had a more important role than the genome conversion

438

factor and attributed to 4 and 5% of the variability in the model output. Unique to the faulty

439

drain scenario, the aerosol dispersion rate (𝐷𝑖𝑠!,!" ) from the drain to the toilet room was a

440

sensitive and uncertain parameter, which contributed to 7% of the variability in the risk

441

outcome. The fecal volume (𝑉! ), time spent in the toilet room (𝐷𝑢𝑟! ), the SARS-CoV-2 decay

442

half life (ℎ𝑙!! ), and time delay (𝑡! ) after the prior toilet flushing all contributed to 2% of the

443

variability in the model outcome and were less important in comparison with the concentration

444

of the virus in the flush water (𝐶!",!",!! ). Aside from the factors influencing the exposure risk,

445

the dose-response best fit parameter 𝑘!! in the exponential dose-response model was the

446

second most important contributor to the variability of the illness risk estimation. 37% of

447

variability in illness estimation was due to this parameter in the toilet flushing scenario and 34%

448

in the faulty drain scenario.

449

We initially expected the conversion factor from genome copy virus to infectious virus pfu

450

was a major source of model uncertainty since determining the concentration of infectious

451

SARS-CoV-2 in the fecal samples had been challenging11. The above analyses showed,

452

however, the wide range of the viral load in the fecal shedding played an important role. In the

453

effort of the data collection, we focused on literature that provided quantitative analysis of fecal

454

loading in patients at different stage of the disease development and from different regions. We

455

also included data reported as non-detection by setting the lower detection limit as the upper

456

bound to generate estimations using a uniform distribution between zero and the detection limit.

457

The SARS-CoV-2 data compiled here represent the state of knowledge and are comparable with

458

SARS-CoV-1 data, which served as a proxy for the new virus.

To further assess the confidence of fecal viral load among COVID-19 patients, we

465

compared the estimated total viral load from all COVID-19 cases (15-day accumulated cases) in

466

a sewage treatment plant’s service area with the reported concentration of SARS-CoV-2 in

467

sewage. The back-of-the-envelope calculation was carried out using the City of New York

468

COVID-19 cases reported during their peak outbreak. The case numbers were collected in

469

Newtown Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant (NCWTP) service area, including Manhattan,

470

Brooklyn and Queens60. The case numbers were multiplied by the fecal loading rate and divided

471

by the influent volume of raw sewage to NCWTP. The details of the calculation and outcomes

472

are presented in the supporting materials and Figure S2. The analysis showed that based on

473

reported cases and fecal viral load, the median concentration of SARS-CoV-2 was estimated to

474

be 1.25log10gc/L of raw sewage without including viral decay during transport from households

475

to NCWTP (Table S7). If assuming reported cases were only 50% of the total number of cases

476

in the community (due to underreporting, asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases), the

477

estimated concentration of SARS-CoV-2 would only increase to 1.55log10gc/L. Even assuming

478

50% of all residents in the plant service area were COVID-19 patients and shed virus in the

479

feces, the median concentration of SARS-CoV-2 was still in the range of 3.1log10gc/L of raw

480

sewage. In comparison with the reports of SARS-CoV-2 concentration in sewage from different

481

municipal sewage treatment plants (median value of 5.23log10gc/L), the estimates based on

482

fecal loading were much lower (Figure S2 and Table S7). This result suggests that the fecal

483

loading is either underestimated or sewage SARS-CoV-2 concentration is several orders

484

overestimated. The underestimation of fecal viral load could be due to the methodological

485

challenges relating to sample extraction and purification of viruses for qPCR. Since the

486

uncertainty of this parameter plays a key role in the risk estimation, future data in this area will

487

no doubt improve the confidence in the risk estimation.

488

Regardless of the contribution of the conversion factor to model variability, the infectivity

489

of the viruses shed in feces is a critical factor to establish the hazard in discussion. At the time

490

of this writing, there are two sides of the expert opinions regarding the infectivity of

491

SARS-CoV-2 in feces. One side believes that viruses shed in feces are mostly inactivated by

492

colonic fluid13, therefore, there is low or no hazard from fecal shed virus. So far, there has not

493

been any direct evidence to support fecal transmitted infection in human or in animal model for

494

either SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV-1. The conclusion from the Amory Gardens investigation

495

was challenged by previous reports56-57. The other side of the opinion points to the successful

496

isolation of infectious virus from fecal samples from the handful of presence and absence

497

studies to support the hypothesis of fecal-oral transmission10, 15-17. Several reports also indicate

498

that viral shedding in feces long after patients recovered from COVID-19 and tested negative

499

for SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory samples. They suggested that prolonged viral shedding could

500

pose repeated exposure risks to others even after the patient has recovered from disease32. In

501

addition to the case report of Amoy Gardens for SARS-CoV-1 transmission, two recent

502

governmental reports from China concluded that fecal exposure was the likely source of

503

COVID-19 transmission. One was a press release of the Infectious Disease Control Authority in

504

the City of Guangzhou, China, which pin-pointed the COVID-19 patient feces as the source of

505

infection of three families residing in the floor below a COVID-19 patient 61. The second was a

506

report by Beijing Center for Disease Control and Prevention identifying that an isolated incident

507

of a COVID-19 case was linked to a known cluster of outbreak through a visit to a public

508

bathroom62. More research is needed to understand infectious potential of feces.

509

We adopted the genome copy to infectious unit conversion of SARS-CoV-1 reported in the

510

lab experiments as a proxy for SARS-CoV-2. It is important to point out that the SARS-CoV-1

511

used in these experiments was not derived from fecal samples40-41. They were lab viral cultures,

512

and the relationship between genome copies and infectious units depended on the methods for

513

virus preparation, the storage condition and time delay before the assay. If we believe the

514

colonic fluid can effectively inactivate SARS-CoV-2, the conversation factor adopted from lab

515

cultured viruses could be an overestimation of infectious virus in feces and the final risks. The

516

conversion factor used in the model covers a range based on the lab experimental outcome but

517

it may not be the right representation of fecal shed virus. The degree of uncertainty in this factor

518

may not be adequately represented by the importance analysis. Until further data on infectivity

519

of SARS-CoV-2 in feces is made available, this is the best proxy for converting genome

520

equivalent to infectious unit.

521

The aerosol generation during toilet flushing has been well studied20-21. Aerosol

522

concentration varies with types of toilet. The aerosol concentrations presented by O’Toole’s

523

study42 are the best representation of the low flow toilet commonly installed in the multi-unit

524

apartment buildings. The importance analyses indicated both aerosol concentration and

525

dispersion in a room could have important impact on the risk outcomes. However, they were

526

unlikely to change the magnitude of the risk that could match the risk outcome of Amoy

527

Gardens. In comparison with the direct measurements of aerosols generated by toilet flushing,

528

the dispersion of aerosols through a faulty drains is less certain. The commonly known sewer

529

smell only provides indirect evidence for aerosol intake from the main sewer pipe to individual

530

toilet rooms. We built a uniform distribution for the dispersion rate to capture the variability of

531

this parameter. Additional research is needed to understand the building drainage system and

532

aerosol transmission.

533

Human dose-response model for SARS-CoV-2 requires intentionally exposing humans to

534

known doses of SARS-CoV-2, which is unlikely due to the ethical concerns. Animal models

535

may be developed in the future as that has been done for SARS-CoV-1. Although there are

536

remarkable differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 during infection, the disease

537

development shares similarity, which promotes us to use the SARS-CoV-1 model as the proxy.

538

Analyses showed that this was a critical parameter of the risk model and contributed to a large

539

degree of uncertainty in the risk outcome. Adjustment made in the 𝑘 through incorporation of

540

enhanced affinity to cell receptor, did not dramatically increase the risk. The uncertainty was

541

largely embedded in the original model parameter, where data were pooled from both the

542

animal model and comparison with other coronavirus including HCoV-229E to generate the

543

best fit 𝑘. Together with viral load, k had the biggest impact on risk outcomes. However, even

544

after removing the uncertainty of the dose-response relationship, the comparison of the

545

exposure dose estimated by the model still could not resolve the large gap with the dose

546

estimation from Watanabe et al.47. Therefore, this analysis suggests additional routes of

547

transmission may have contributed to Amoy Gardens outbreak57.

3.4 Implications and Recommendations

549

The risk estimation presented relatively low median health risks of two viral transmission

550

scenarios through building drainage system. However, there are large degrees of uncertainty

551

among several model input parameters. Although uncertainties are inevitable, risk assessment

552

should always be conducted in an iterative manner that allows refinement of the risk assessment

553

question(s), key assumptions, and data used in the model. As the first attempt to understand the

554

risk of a novel virus, we expect the risk analysis to offer the fundamental understanding of

555

associated risk based on the risk analysis framework. The model and outcomes can be refined in

556

the later time with the emergence of new data on the property of the virus, human and

557

environmental interactions.

558

The mismatch of the exposure dose and illness estimation of this study with Amoy

559

Gardens’ report is worthy of further investigation. Although the high end of the risk estimation

560

does not exclude the transmission scenario, it has a lower possibility or is only under extreme

561

conditions. The extreme conditions may include a partially stopped up drainage system that can

562

trap human waste containing virus in the sewer pipe, overloading ventilating fan to draw

563

contaminated aerosols constantly into the toilet room19. Therefore, attentions should be given to

564

proper maintenance of building drainage systems during the outbreak of aerosol transmitted

565

diseases.

566

It should be noted that the existing indoor drainage systems, if used and maintained

567

properly, are able to protect healthy habitants from the possible exposures to pathogens, which

568

is validated by the lack of more incidents like Amoy Gardens. Recommendations such as

569

keeping the toilet cover closed while flushing to prevent the aerosols from being splashed into

570

the air, and a regular inspection of water seals to prevent the aerosols in drainage pipes from

571

being released into the indoor air could be made to further reduce the risk. Such simple habits

572

could effectively keep habitants from microbial risks associated with the building drainage

573

system.

574

The toilet flushing and faulty floor drain scenarios are examples of potential hazards of the

575

fecal contamination derived risk. The aerosolization of fecal derived virus can also be applied to

576

risk analysis in shared public restrooms since the restroom can be filled with aerosols generated

577

by multiple toilet flushes within a short time window. The viral concentration in the air could be

578

significantly higher if there were large numbers of COVID-19 patients or asymptomatic carriers

579

using the restroom (maybe closer to the direct measurements in the Wuhan Hospital toilet

580

room). Another potential application is to look into the aerosol generation from aerated sewage

581

during wastewater treatment process to estimate the risk of personnel working in wastewater

582

treatment plants.
