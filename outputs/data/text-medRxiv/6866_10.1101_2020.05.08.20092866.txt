We investigated the expression and subcellular localization of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor,
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), within the upper (nasal) and lower (pulmonary)
respiratory tracts of healthy human donors. We detected ACE2 protein expression within
the cilia organelle of ciliated airway epithelial cells, which likely represents the initial or
early subcellular site of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry during respiratory transmission. We
further determined whether ACE2 expression in the cilia of upper respiratory cells was
influenced by patient demographics, clinical characteristics, co-morbidities, or
medication use, and found no evidence that the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) increases ACE2 protein
expression.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an ongoing pandemic infection caused by the positivesense RNA virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)1. The high
transmissibility of the virus, along with case fatality estimates ranging from 1% to above 5%, has
raised concerns worldwide. Patients with comorbid conditions including hypertension, diabetes,
and pulmonary disease are highly represented among hospitalized patients with COVID-19
disease, suggesting the presence of risk factors that may determine susceptibility to SARSCoV-2 infection 2–5.
A molecular connection between SARS-CoV-2 and hypertension, in particular, is suggested by
the discovery that ACE2 is the major essential receptor for SARS-CoV-2 6,7. ACE2 plays an
important role in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which consists of a cascade
of vasoactive peptides that maintain blood pressure and electrolyte homeostasis. ACE2
converts vasoconstrictor peptides, angiotensin (Ang) II and Ang I, into the vasodilator peptides,
Ang (1-7) and Ang (1-9), respectively 8. These actions counterbalance the enzymatic effect of
the related ACE, which generates angiotensin II from angiotensin I. ACEI and ARBs are
commonly used antihypertensive drugs that target components of the RAAS. Several recent
correspondences have raised concerns that ACEI and ARBs may increase expression of ACE2
and thereby elevate the risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2, thus potentially explaining why
hypertension is a common comorbidity in patients with COVID-19 9–12. This hypothesis is also
rooted in human and rodent studies showing upregulation of ACE2 mRNA in the heart, kidney,
and urine after ACEI/ARB administration13–15. Notably, however, the effects of ACEI and ARBs
on the expression of ACE2 in the respiratory tract are currently unknown. Given SARS-CoV-2
causes respiratory infections, whether ACE2 expression is altered in the airway of patients
taking ACEI or ARBs is a critical question that needs to be addressed to support continued
clinical use of these antihypertensive drugs.
We first determined the expression patterns of the ACE2 protein in the upper and lower
respiratory tract. Gene expression analyses have identified ACE2 expression in the
nasopharynx, oral mucosa, lungs, intestines, kidney, and testis16, and protein expression
studies have largely been concordant with these tissue-specific findings17,18. However, a recent
preprint suggests the absence of the ACE2 protein in the lung, bronchus, and nasopharynx19. In
order to understand the precise nature of ACE2 protein expression in tissues relevant for
COVID-19, we performed immunohistochemistry using a panel of ACE2 antibodies on human
tissues. Consistent with prior studies, we found that several ACE2 antibodies appropriately stain

ACE2 in the kidney, testis, seminal vesicles, and intestinal villi (Extended Data Fig. 1). However,
only two antibodies that we tested (Abcam ab15348 and Sigma HPA000288), stained ACE2 in
the CD31+ vascular endothelium (Extended Data Fig. 2a), where ACE2 expression has been
reported17. In the lungs, anti-ACE2 clone (Abcam ab15348) yielded robust staining of
pneumocytes, while the other clones showed only weaker or negligible signal (Extended Data
Fig. 1 and 2b). After careful antibody titration, clone selection, and validation across multiple
tissue types, we find that the overall expression intensity of ACE2 in the lung is low when
compared to the kidney, testis, and intestinal villi (Extended Data Fig. 1).
We performed double immunofluorescent staining of ACE2 with mucin 1 (MUC1), an
established type II pneumocyte marker, and confirmed that of tested antibodies, Abcam
ab15348 had the most specific staining patterns and showed that ACE2 is expressed within
type II pneumocytes of human lung (Extended Data Fig. 2b). These findings support recent
single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data showing ACE2 enrichment within type II
pneumocytes20,21. Our results overall support the specificity of some commercially available
antibodies by orthogonal validation and validate the presence of ACE2 protein within the human
airway. These antibody testing results may also serve as a useful resource to help guide future
protein-based studies.
We next investigated ACE2 protein expression within the epithelium of the human respiratory
tract using anti-ACE2 (ab15348) given its robust and specific staining patterns. Recent studies
using scRNA-seq have identified ACE2 mRNA expression within ciliated epithelial cells in the
nasal cavity20–22. Sungnak et al. demonstrated that ciliated nasal epithelial cells have one of the
highest ACE2 mRNA expression levels among investigated cell types in the respiratory tract21.
We therefore performed double immunofluorescence staining using anti-ACE2 and antiacetylated α-tubulin (ACTUB), a marker of the cilia organelle, and discovered that not only is
ACE2 expressed in ciliated epithelial cells, but within these cell types, ACE2 is abundantly
present in the cilia organelle of human nasal turbinate, ethmoid sinus, uncinate process (sinus),
trachea, and bronchial epithelial cells (Fig. 1a) compared to appropriate isotype controls
(Extended Data Fig. 3). We also examined the mouse respiratory tract and found that ACE2 is
similarly expressed within the cilia of the mouse trachea and nasal turbinate (Fig. 1b). Staining
of ACE2 within IMCD3 cells, a ciliated kidney epithelial cell line, further confirms ACE2
localization within renal primary cilia (Fig. 1c). Overexpression of human ACE2 in IMCD3 cells
showed a predicted increase in the percentage of ACE2 staining in the primary cilia (Fig. 1d, e),
providing additional evidence of ACE2 localization to the primary cilia and further validation of
the antibody’s specificity. These findings are consistent with a prior study showing ACE2 protein
co-localization with β-tubulin IV, another cilia marker, from human airway epithelial cells cultured
at the air-liquid interface23. Importantly, both the transcript and protein for transmembrane serine
protease 2 (TMPRSS2), a serine protease required for the crucial spike protein activation step
of SARS-CoV-2 entry, is also expressed in the cilia organelle of the human respiratory
tract,18,20,24.
Taken together, our data suggest that the respiratory tract cilia organelle contains the necessary
molecular components for SARS-CoV-2 entry. Indeed, ciliated nasal epithelial cells have been

known to be early sites of viral contact for many respiratory viruses including SARS-CoV25,
MERS-CoV26, rhinovirus27, parainfluenza virus28, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)29, and
influenza30, which each exploit respective host proteins harbored within the ciliated nasal
epithelial cells. CX3CR1, the receptor for RSV, in particular, is expressed in the respiratory cilia
organelle within epithelial cells31. The related SARS-CoV has also been localized to the cilia
body of the airway25. Although future imaging is needed to localize the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the
cilia of infected human respiratory tissues, our data strongly suggests that ACE2 protein in the
cilia body of the respiratory tract, represents the probable initial or early subcellular site of
SARS-CoV-2 viral entry.
Curiously, using double immunofluorescent staining of ACE2 with MUC5AC, a goblet cell
marker, we find no evidence of ACE2 protein expression within the non-ciliated goblet cells of
the respiratory tract (Extended Data Fig. 4a). Since this result differs from scRNA-seq findings
of ACE2 mRNA expression within goblet cells of nasal turbinates and ethmoid tissue from
healthy donors and patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) 20,21, we then performed in situ
hybridization using an ACE2 probe in combination with an anti-MUC5AC antibody, and found no
evidence of ACE2 mRNA expression within goblet cells of the respiratory tract (Extended Data
Fig. 4b). These results may reflect limitations in functional interpretation of current single-cell
transcriptomic studies, as well as the importance of targeted transcript and protein validation
methods to complement shotgun analytic approaches. In summary, we find no evidence of
ACE2 protein nor mRNA expression in goblet cells of the respiratory airway, suggesting that
unlike ciliated epithelial cells, goblet cells are unlikely to be directly infected by SARS-CoV-2.
We next identified patient factors that may contribute to changes in the expression of ACE2 in
the nasal epithelial cilia, as this may have important clinical implications for susceptibility to
SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Higher ACE2 expression is correlated with higher pseudotype
SARS‐CoV‐2 and SARS-CoV viral infectivity, suggesting that increased ACE2 levels may
predispose individuals to SARS-CoV-2 transmission32–34. We leveraged our existing human
nasal tissue bank, which contains detailed demographics, medical, social, and medication
history from patients who have donated their upper airway tissues from 3 academic medical
centers (Stanford University, National Taiwan University (NTU), and China Medical University
(CMU)) from 2018-2020, to characterize whether ACE2 expression in the upper respiratory cilia
is affected by specific patient characteristics.
We determined the extent to which ACE2 expression may differ by age, sex, and smoking
status -- three covariates that have been associated with COVID-19 disease severity. Across all
three sample cohorts, we found no significant differences in ACE2 expression based on age
(≥65 years), sex, or smoking status (Extended Data Fig. 5a). These results differ from some, but
not all, recent gene expression studies comparing ACE2 expression in patients with varying
demographics and smoking status35–37. Our results suggest that host factors outside of ACE2
expression may determine why males, patients of older age, and smokers are epidemiologically
linked to COVID-19 susceptibility.
We next examined whether ACE2 expression in the upper respiratory cilia differs between
healthy donors versus patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), a non-malignant chronic

inflammatory disease of the paranasal sinuses that presents either with benign nasal polyps
(CRSwNP) or without nasal polyps (CRSsNP). Across all three patient cohorts, no significant
differences were noted between healthy donors and patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with or
without nasal polyps (Extended Data Fig. 5b). There were also no observed differences in ACE2
expression between anatomical regions within the nasal cavity (Extended Data Fig. 5c). These
results suggest that patients with CRS may not be at a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
There are currently no epidemiological studies that have assessed the prevalence of COVID-19
in patients with CRS to our knowledge.
Finally, we identified patients within our nasal tissue bank who have been taking either ACEI or
ARBs for at least six continuous months prior to nasal surgery and compared their ACE2
expression to controls matched for age, sex, and smoking status who have never taken
ACEI/ARBs. ACE2 expression was slightly but statistically significantly decreased in patients
taking ACEI compared to matched controls in the Stanford cohort, whereas ACE2 expression
was not significantly different in patients taking ARBs within all three patient cohorts (Figure 2).
We were unable to identify patients taking ACEI in the two Taiwanese cohorts, likely because
ARBs are strongly preferred over ACEI for management of hypertension in Taiwan38. Subgroup
analysis comparing ACEI and ARBs treatment groups to controls of similar age, sex,
hypertension, or smoking status revealed a similar trend of lower ACE2 expression in the ACEI
and ARB group among most cohort groups, although statistical significance was not attained
likely due to the low sample size (Extended Data Fig. 6a,c,d,e). When patients from all three
cohorts were combined as a normalized Z-score, not surprisingly, ACE2 expression in the
patients taking ACEI was significantly lower compared to controls (Extended Data Fig.6b).
Above all, these results suggest that the use of ACEI or ARBs does not increase ACE2
expression in the upper respiratory cilia, and therefore patients on ACEI or ARBs are likely at no
greater risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission than other individuals. Indeed, a recent retrospective
cohort study found that the use of ACEI/ARBs was associated with lower risk of all-cause
mortality compared with ACEI/ARBs non-users39. Although we saw a trend towards decreased
ACE2 expression in patients taking ACEI, we strongly caution against interpretation of this result
in isolation as suggesting that ACEI is protective against SARS-CoV-2 transmission given our
limited sample size, and the likelihood of other host factors that determine viral susceptibility.
The clinical portion of our study has several limitations. First, sample sizes in the treatment
groups, especially the ACEI group, were small, increasing the possibility of a Type II error.
However, our null hypothesis was that ACEI/ARBs treatment would increase ACE2 expression.
Instead, we observe a decrease in ACE2 among the treatment groups (with the ACEI group
reaching statistical significance). The true probability that ACE2 is increased following ACEI or
ARBs treatment is therefore likely low. Second, recall bias may be present as information on
ACEI/ARBs usage was collected retrospectively, although this was minimized by including
patients with confirmed long-term ACEI/ARBs by direct interview and through the electronic
medical or pharmacy record. ACEI and ARBs are also long-term medications that are less likely
to be used intermittently. Lastly, this was an observational study in which the use of
antihypertensive agents for each patient was not randomized, and therefore the ability to make
a causal inference is limited due to confounding factors. Although we minimized these elements
by using controls matched for age, sex, and smoking status, there are likely other yet

unidentified factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Clinical trials (NCT04338009 and NCT04312009)
are currently underway and will further ascertain the impact of continuation versus
discontinuation of ACEI and ARBs on outcomes in patients with COVID-19.
In conclusion, we find that ACE2 protein expression is not only present in ciliated epithelial cells
in the human respiratory tract, but that on a subcellular level, it is enriched in the motile cilia
organelle of the ciliated epithelium. The latter is anatomically the probable initial or early
subcellular site of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry in these cells (and perhaps other cell types). The
identification of ACE2 localization to the cilia will guide future functional studies and provide
potential mechanisms and targets for strategies that modulate SARS-CoV-2 viral entry and
infection routes. The endogenous function of ACE2 in the cilia may be distinct from its role in the
RAAS, remains to be determined, and begs the question as to whether SARS-CoV-2, through
interaction with ACE2, might interfere with ciliary function during late viremia. Finally, these
results support the conclusion of several professional medical societies that have endorsed
maintaining standard ACE inhibitors and ARBs therapy during the ongoing SARS-CoV-2
outbreak, although those prior recommendations were provided based on the absence of
evidence that ACE2 levels may be increased by ACEI/ARBs. Here, we show the first
expression-based evidence that ACE2 protein levels in the respiratory tract are indeed not
increased in patients taking long-term ACEI and ARBs, suggesting that these medications can
be safely continued as standard antihypertensive therapeutics.

Methods
Human nasal tissue specimen collection
Tissues from the nasal cavity and the paranasal sinuses were collected from both healthy
control donors and patients with chronic rhinosinusitis from 2018-2020 at the Stanford Sinus
Center, National Taiwan University (NTU), and China Medical University (CMU) in Taiwan.
Controls represented patients without history, endoscopic, or radiographic evidence of sinus
disease, but underwent sinus procedures for surgical access such as for repair of cerebrospinal
fluid leaks. Detailed patient characteristics including demographics, medical history, and past
medication use were collected in parallel with tissue sample acquisition. Patient data, including
medication history, were independently verified through direct interview by a research
technician/physician and by a questionnaire additionally administered on the day of surgery to
confirm accuracy of existing records from patients’ electronic medical or pharmacy records.
Samples were included if the use or non-use of ACEI or ARBs could be confirmed in-person
and by electronic medical or pharmacy records. All tissue specimens and patient medical record
information, including demographics, medical/social history, and medications were collected
under approved Institutional Review Board (IRB) protocols in accordance with the regulations of
the Research Compliance Office at the respective institutions. Following surgical excision, nasal
specimens were placed in physiologic saline, immediately transported to the lab, and placed in
10% neutral buffered formalin for 24-48 hours before paraffin embedding. Nasal turbinate,
uncinate process, and ethmoid sinus tissues were placed into EDTA for bone decalcification
prior to embedding into tissue blocks.
Human lung, bronchial, tracheal tissues
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks from Stanford Pathology archives were
selected based on normal histology using a hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) stained tissue section for
evaluation. Normal histology was reconfirmed by a board-certified pathologist in the Nolan lab.
IMCD3 cell culture and transfection
IMCD3 cells were grown in DMEM (11995065, Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with
10% FBS (100-106, Gemini), GlutaMax supplement (35050-079, Thermo Fisher Scientific), 100
U/mL Penicillin-Streptomycin (15140163, Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 37°C in 5% CO2. For
transient transfection of IMCD3 cells, IMCD3 cells were grown to ∼80% confluence and
transfected with 5 µg of ACE2 plasmid DNA/1x106 cells using Fugene6 (Promega).
Immunofluorescence immunohistochemistry and imaging
Sections were cut to 4 µm thickness at the Stanford University Histology Service Center and
mounted on frosted glass slides. H&E stained sections were obtained from each FFPE block.
Deparaffinization, rehydration, and Heat-Induced Epitope Retrieval (HIER) were performed on
an a ST4020 small linear stainer (Leica). For deparaffinization, slides were baked at 70°C for 11.5 h, followed by rehydration in descending concentrations of ethanol (100% twice, 95% twice,
80%, 70%, ddH2O twice; each step for 30 seconds). Washes were performed using a Leica
ST4020 Linear Stainer (Leica Biosystems, Wetzlar, Germany) programmed to 3 dips per wash
for 30 s each. Heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) was performed in a Lab VisionTM PT
module (Thermo Fisher) using Dako Target Retrieval Solution, pH 9 (S236784-2, DAKO Agilent)

at 97 °C for 10 min and cooled down to 65°C. After further cooling to room temperature for 30
min, slides were washed for 10 min 3 times in Tris-Buffered Saline (TBS), containing 0.1%
Tween® 20 (Cell Marque; TBS-T). Sections were then blocked in 5% normal donkey serum in
TBS-T at room temperature for 1 h, followed by incubation with primary antibodies in the
blocking solution. After 1 overnight incubation of primary antibodies in 4°C, sections were
washed 3 times with TBS-T and stained with the appropriate secondary antibodies in PBS with
3% bovine serum albumin, 0.4% saponin, and 0.02% sodium azide at room temperature for 1 h.
Following this, sections were washed 3 times with TBS-T and mounted with ProLong® Gold
Antifade mounting medium with DAPI (Invitrogen). The primary antibodies and final titrations
used were rabbit anti-ACE2 (1:100; Abcam ab15348), rabbit anti-ACE2 (1:200; Sigma
HPA000288), rabbit anti-ACE2 (1:100; Abcam ab239924), rabbit anti-ACE2 (1:100; Novus
NBP2-67692), goat anti-ACE2 (1:100; R&D Systems AF933), mouse anti-acetylated α Tubulin
(1:300; Santa Cruz sc-23950), mouse anti-MUC-1 (1:100; NSJ Bio V2372SAF), mouse antiMUC5AC (1:200; Abcam ab212636); mouse anti-CD31 (1:300; Novus NBP2-47785); rabbit IgG
isotype control (same mcg as control; Abcam ab172730). Secondary antibodies include donkey
anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor Plus 647 1:500 (Invitrogen), donkey anti-mouse Alexa Fluor Plus 555
1:500 (Invitrogen). Fluorescence-immunolabeled images were acquired using a Zeiss
AxioImager Z1 microscope. Post-imaging processing was performed using ImageJ. Figures
were organized using Adobe Illustrator.
Chromogenic immunohistochemistry
After deparaffinization and rehydration, slides were blocked for endogenous peroxidase in 3%
hydrogen peroxide for 15 minutes at room temperature. HIER was performed with Dako Target
Retrieval Solution, pH 9 (S236784-2, DAKO Agilent) at 95 °C for 25 min. 2.5% horse serum was
used for blocking for 30 minutes at room temperature followed by incubation overnight at 4°C
using one of the following primary antibodies: rabbit anti-ACE2 (1:20,000; Abcam ab15348),
rabbit anti-ACE2 (1:1,000; Sigma HPA000288), goat anti-ACE2 (1:500; R&D Systems AF933),
rabbit anti-ACE2 (1:500; Abcam ab239924), mouse anti-ACE2 (1:200; R&D Systems MAB933),
rabbit anti-ACE2 (1:5,000; Novus NBP2-67692). ImmPRESS HRP anti-rabbit, anti-mouse, or
anti-goat IgG polymer detection kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was used as the
secondary antibody link for 30 minutes at room temperature. 5 minute Tris/tween buffer washing
steps were performed between each incubation step. The immune complexes were visualized
with ImmPACT DAB Peroxidase (HRP) Substrate kit (Vector Laboratories). Cell nuclei were
counterstained with hematoxylin. Images were scanned and digitized using the Aperio AT2 and
viewed using Aperio Imagescope software.
In situ hybridization (ISH) staining
Tissue sections (4 µm thick) were cut from FFPE tissue blocks and mounted onto glass slides.
Slide-tissue sections were baked at 70°C for 1 hour and subsequently soaked in xylene
(Thermofisher Scientific) for 10 min x 3 rounds. Rehydration and HIER of tissue sections were
performed in a similar manner as described above except that rehydrating washes were done
for 180 seconds each. After HIER and cooling, slides were then washed twice with Milli-Q water
(Millipore Sigma) and half the section were subjected to a 10 min protease digestion at 40°C
with Protease III (322337, Bio-Techne) diluted to 1:20 in 1X PBS. Slides were then washed for 2
x 2 min Milli-Q water before a 15 min H2O2 block at 40°C (322335, Bio-Techne). Slides were

then washed for 2 x 2 min Milli-Q water before an overnight hybridization at 40°C with probes
against the human ACE2 mRNA (848151, Bio-Techne). Amplification of the ISH probes was
performed the next day according to manufacturer's protocol (323100, Bio-Techne), with the
final deposition of Cyanine 3 for ACE2 mRNA probe targets (NEL744001KT, Akoya
Biosciences). Slides were then processed exactly as described for IHC staining for antiMUC5AC (Abcam ab212636) and ACE2 (Abcam ab15348) staining. Fluorescent images were
acquired and processed as detailed above.
Quantification of fluorescence intensity
Samples within each patient cohort were stained simultaneously with rabbit anti-ACE2 (1:100;
Abcam ab15348) and mouse anti-acetylated α-Tubulin (ACTUB 1:300; Santa Cruz sc-23950)
using the same master mix and identical incubation times under similar staining conditions
described above. Isotype controls were stained with rabbit IgG isotype control (Abcam
ab172730) and mouse anti-acetylated α Tubulin (1:300; Santa Cruz sc-23950). Exposure times
under fluorescence microscopy were identical for samples within the same cohort. Quantitation
was performed in the FIJI package of ImageJ open source software. Binary masks were created
by thresholding the anti-acetylated α-Tubulin channel using selected cutoff values that produce
inclusive outlines of the ACTUB staining. Cellular membranes were segmented (outlined) using
continuity of high signal areas (area larger than 1,000 pixels) on binary masks as the criteria.
The signal within the membrane areas were computed for both the ACE2 channel and for
ACTUB channel. The estimates of ACE2 signal were further corrected by subtracting the
average membrane signal observed in isotype control from the average ACE2 channel per
membrane measurements. For the sake of cross-sample normalization, the ratio of the isotype
control-subtracted ACE2 signal divided by the ACTUB signal (“normalized ACE2”) for each
patient sample was used for further downstream analysis.
Statistical analysis
Analyses were performed with IBM SPSS 23 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY) and GraphPad
Prism 6.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA) software. The Student’s t-test was used for 2group comparisons. Multiple comparisons for intergroup differences were assessed by KruskalWallis one-way analysis of variance, followed by Dunn's multiple comparison post-hoc test.
When integrating data from three institutions, data from each institution were converted to Zscore before applying the above statistical comparison. All data are noted as mean ± SD. A pvalue of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

potentially decreased in ACEI patients.
a, Quantification of ACE2 in controls and patients taking ARB and ACEI. In the Stanford cohort,
ACE2 is slightly but statistically significantly lower in patients taking ACEI (0.19 ± 0.03)
compared to controls (0.26 ± 0.06). (Kruskal-Wallis test p=0.012; Dunn's multiple comparison
post-hoc test, *p< 0.05). There were no statistically significant differences in ACE2 expression
between patients taking ARB and controls in the Stanford, National Taiwan University (NTU),
and China Medical University (CMU) cohorts. All data are noted as mean ± SD.

Extended Data Fig. 5 | Comparison of ciliary ACE2 protein expression by age, sex,
smoking status, sinus disease, and anatomical region.
a, No statistical significance for ACE2 expression was seen among patients less than or greater
than 65 years of age, males versus females, and patients with varying smoking history.
(Student’s t-test or Kruskal-Wallis test, p> 0.05).
b, No statistical significance of ACE2 expression was seen between healthy controls and
patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with polyps (CRSwNP) or without polyps (CRSsNP).
(Kruskal-Wallis test, p> 0.05).
c, No statistical significance of ACE2 expression was seen between distinct human nasal tissue
sites/regions. (Kruskal-Wallis test, p> 0.05). UNC, uncinate process; Turb, nasal turbinates; Eth,
ethmoid sinus; NP, benign nasal polyps.
Extended Data Fig. 6 | Subgroup analysis of ciliary ACE2 expression among patients
taking ARBs or ACEI.
a, In the Stanford cohort, when including only controls with hypertension (HTN) on other
medications (“HTN w/o ARBs/ACEI”), ACE2 expression was statistically different between the
groups (Kruskal-Wallis test, p=0.048) but Dunn’s multiple comparison post-hoc test did not
reveal any statistical significance between the three groups.
b, When cohorts from all three institutions were normalized by Z score and integrated, patients
taking ACEI (-0.71 ± 0.46) had a lower ACE2 expression compared to controls with
hypertension (0.40 ± 1.09). (Kruskal-Wallis test, p=0.035; Dunn’s multiple comparison post-hoc
test, *p<0.05). Patients taking ARBs (-0.16 ± 0.99) showed a trend towards lower ACE2
compared to controls with hypertension, but this was not statistically significant.
c, ACE2 expression among patients of older age (≥65 years old) and patients <65 years old
taking ARBs and ACEI was not statistically divergent from control patients of the same age
group. (Kruskal-Wallis test, p>0.05).
d, ACE2 expression among male and female patients on ARBs or ACEI trended lower than
same-sex controls except for males taking ARBs in the CMU group who showed a trend
towards higher ACE2 expression. No statistically significant differences were observed.
(Kruskal-Wallis test, p>0.05).
