ABSTRACT
SARS-CoV-2 variants have emerged in late 2020 and there are at least three variants of
concern (B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P1) reported by WHO. These variants have several substitutions in
the Spike protein that affect receptor binding; they present increased transmissibility and
may be associated with reduced vaccine effectiveness. In the present work, we are reporting
the identification of a potential variant of interest harboring the mutations T478K, P681H,
and T732A in the Spike protein, within the newly named lineage B.1.1.519, which rapidly
outcompeted the preexisting variants in Mexico and has been the dominant virus in the
country during the first trimester of 2021.

Viral mutation is a natural and expected event generated during genomic replication and
interaction with the host, resulting in the occurrence of genetic groups also called lineages.
The latter differ from each other by specific mutations that accumulate over time, causing
the appearance of variants. A variant could be defined as a virus with specific genetic
mutations that differ from the original virus, reflecting in some cases SARS-CoV-2 adaptation
to its novel human host. Although the majority of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome are
expected to be neutral or deleterious, some mutations can confer a selective advantage and
may be associated with enhanced fitness, increased infectivity and/or immune evasion [1, 2,
3]. Importantly, the emergence and spread of variants associated with changes in
transmission, virulence and/or antigenicity can impact the evolution of the COVID-19
pandemic and might require appropriate public health actions and surveillance [4].

New SARS-CoV-2 variants are spreading rapidly around the world, becoming a public health
concern. As of February 23, 2021, Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO)/World Health
Organization (WHO) and Global initiative on sharing all influenza data (GISAID) reported the
appearance of at least three Variants of Concern (VOC) that have presented characteristics
with implication in public health. Variant B.1.1.7 was identified for the first time in the United
Kingdom in September 2020 [4, 5], and by December 2020 it represented 43% of the
genomes sequenced, increasing to 82% in January 2021 and to 94% in February 2021 [6].
This variant is of growing concern since it has been shown to be significantly more
transmissible than other variants [7], and to likely have increased severity, based on
hospitalization and fatality rates. Variant B.1.351 was detected for the first time in South
Africa, in 64% (261 of 411 genomes) of the sequences reported in December 2020, increasing
to 75% (99 of 132 genomes) in the next month [6]. Epidemiological data analysis estimated
that this VOC is 50% more transmissible than the previous circulating variants. Finally, the
P.1 variant was detected for the first time in Brazil in 47% (61 of 130) of the viral genomes in
December 2020, increasing to 74% (111 of 150 genomes) in the next month [6, 8]. Of
relevance, it has shown a reduced neutralization by convalescent and post-vaccination sera.
These SARS-CoV-2 VOCs have independently acquired some of the same Spike protein
mutations, particularly E484K, N501Y, S477N, and K417T, which have been associated with
increased viral transmission and / or decreased sensitivity to antibody neutralization [9].

In Latin America, with the exception of P.1 and P.2 observed in Brazil, no other variants with
the potential of rapid expansion have been reported so far [10]. Here we report the
identification of a potential VOI harboring the mutations T478K, P681H, and T732A in the
Spike protein, within the newly named lineage B.1.1.519, derived from the B.1.1.222 lineage,
which rapidly outcompeted the preexisting variants in Mexico and has been the dominant
virus in the country during 2021.
Derived from the genomic surveillance carried out in Mexico, 2,692 genomic sequences were
obtained in this study and are part of the 3,156 sequences deposited in the GISAID from
March 1, 2020 to March 21, 2021. As a result of the analysis of this set of sequences, we
observed the presence of 91 PANGO lineages, being B.1.1.519 (37.8%), B.1 (13.9%), B.1.1.222
(10.3%), B.1.1 (5.7%), B.1.609 (5.6%) and B.1.243 (4.5 %) the most prevalent.

A striking observation was the detection of the B.1.1.519 lineage, derived from B.1.1.222,
that harbors a mutation T478K in the Spike protein. This variant had not been detected in
Mexico before October 2020, when it was found in Mexico City, and phylogeographic
analyses suggest that the B.1.1.519 variant emerged around mid-September 2020 (9). In
November 2020, 13% (16/123) of the characterized cases of COVID-19 were caused by this
variant, and in December this proportion increased to 29.3% (97/331). In January 2021, the
percentage of B.1.1.519 rose to 51.5% (229/445), increasing in incidence to 73.6%
(808/1098) in February. On the other hand, a decreasing frequency of the B.1 lineage that
had predominated in Mexico in 2020 was observed, going from 36.27% (284/783) between
March and September, to 2.37% (26/1098) in February 2021.

Since the identification of B.1.1.519 in October 2020, a total of 1,195 genomic sequences
have represented this variant, of which the majority are from Mexico City and are spread in
other 24 states of the Mexico (Aguascalientes, Baja California, Baja California Sur, Campeche,
Chiapas, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Colima, Durango, Guerrero, Hidalgo, Jalisco, Morelos, Nuevo
León, Oaxaca, Puebla, Querétaro, Quintana Roo, San Luis Potosí, Estado de Mexico,
Tamaulipas, Tlaxcala, Veracruz, Yucatán, and Zacatecas).

A detailed analysis of the samples from Mexico City indicates that in November B.1.1.519
was present in 17.8% (13/73) of the cases, while in December 2020 this proportion increased
to 47.5% (47/99). In January 2021, the variant was detected in 77.5% (138/178) of the cases
and by February in 90.9% (349/384). This significant increase in the frequency of B.1.1.519
in Mexico City outcompeted preexisting variants between October 2020 and February 2021,
as shown in Figure 1. This increase was also observed in other regions of the country (Figure
1), representing more than 50% of the characterized viruses in some states during the first
trimester of 2021. In particular, the variant was highly prevalent in Baja California Sur (51.3%,
20/39), Guerrero (70%, 21/30), Hidalgo (72.2%, 13/18), Morelos (67.3%, 33/49), State of
Mexico (83.5%, 76/91), Oaxaca (51.3%, 19/37), Puebla (78.5%, 77/98), Queretaro (70.8%,
34/48), San Luis Potosi (70%, 35/50), and Veracruz (69.5%, 80/115).

This variant has also been detected in 17 countries from all five continents. In the Americas,
it has been reported in Canada, Brazil and the USA, and recently it was detected in Brazil,
Chile, Aruba, Martinique and Curazao [11]. However, currently this variant is not
predominant in these countries.

The overall genome analysis of the viruses in the B.1.1.519 lineage showed the presence of
20 mutations in total, compared to the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genome (NCBI accession
number MN908947). Eleven of these mutations are non-synonymous and four of them are
present in the Spike protein. Notably, a T478K mutation is present in its receptor binding
domain (RBD), where mutations have been shown to reduce the activity of some
monoclonal antibodies (9). All amino acid and nucleotide changes are listed in Table 1.

The current B.1.1.519 lineage, presented by the vast majority of the reported Mexican
sequences, was first identified as a B.1.1.222 lineage. However, harboring mutations T478K,
P681H, and T732A clearly differentiated it from this lineage, which does not contain these
mutations, giving origin to the B.1.1.519 one. A phylogenomic analysis of genomic sequences

sequences, strongly suggesting that this variant should be classified as a Variant of Interest
(VOI) (Figure 2). On the other hand, viruses in the lineage B.1.1.519 are already grouped by
the GISAID platform in an independent clade, invariably harboring the three mutations
mentioned above.
An “in silico” analysis using different potent structures of related strains, suggested that the
position of the T478K mutation in the "S" protein is involved in antibody recognition and the
receptor binding site [12]. In a deep mutational scanning of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding
domain, the T478K mutation did not have a significant effect on folding and human
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding [13]. However, this mutation may be
involved in immune evasion, particularly escape from antibody neutralization [14]. The
P681H mutation is one of the mutations found in the B.1.1.7 variant detected in the UK.
According to the definitions described in the document issued by the WHO "Covid-19 Weekly
Epidemiological Update" of February 25, 2021, with the special edition of "Proposed working
definitions of SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Interest and Variants of Concern", we can consider the
lineage B.1.1.519 potentially as a variant of Interest [15].
Finally, two variants with interesting features were identified in this study. First, 13
sequences belonging to the B.1.1.222 lineage without the T478K mutation, but harboring the
T732A mutation and the 69-70 deletion in the Spike protein, the latter being a characteristic
mutation of the B.1.1.7 VOC first detected in the UK. In the second instance, 11 sequences
corresponding to four lineages different to B.1.1.519 (B.1, B.1.1.222, B.1.1.322 y B.1.323),
but containing the same T478K, P681H and T732A mutations in the spike glycoprotein as the
variant B.1.1.519. Keeping track of the incidence of these two variants is considered during
genomic surveillance.

So far, we do not have experimental evidence to determine if the mutations described here
could be associated with changes in transmission, virulence and/or antigenicity or if they could
have an impact on the severity of disease, reinfection rates or vaccine effectiveness. For this
reason, the importance of a genomic surveillance system, epidemiological studies and
experiments to assess viral neutralization of viruses in lineage B.1.1.519 or any new variant,
are crucial to investigate the possible biological impact of the mutations in the context of
public health.
