Abstract
The Singapore government implemented multiple restrictive measures as the novel coronavirus
infection (COVID-19) spread through the community, thereby affecting the support service of
cancer-related social service agencies (cancer-SSAs). We are interested to understand how
Singapore’s cancer-SSAs utilized the social media platform Facebook to overcome the
restrictions which were introduced due to COVID-19. Facebook posts from cancer-SSAs 365
Cancer Prevention Society (365CPS) and Singapore Cancer Society (SCS) between
comparable periods in 2019 and 2020 were extracted. These posts were categorized using a
classification scheme specifically developed for this study. Statistical analyses were performed
to determine if there was a significant difference in the frequency of posts between 2019 and
2020, and across three specific periods in 2020. Results indicate that 365CPS appears to have
adapted to the pandemic by increasing their posting frequency on Facebook in 2020, but the
same was not evident for SCS. However, both SSAs tweaked their social media outreach
strategy in line with social distancing measures, publishing posts detailing activities that
beneficiaries can participate from home such as healthy recipes and virtual events. SSAs can
scale up their efforts to achieve a higher level of health promotion and support for their
beneficiaries.

1. Introduction
The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was discovered in Wuhan, China on December 31st, 2019
[1]. Infected patients show mild to moderate respiratory symptoms, and the disease is
transmitted via respiratory droplets or saliva when one sneezes or coughs [2]. Most people can
recover on their own, but others are at a higher risk of developing severe complications when
infected, such as those with underlying medical conditions such as cancer [3]. On March 11th
2020, World Health Organization (WHO) recognized the virus as a pandemic [4].
The first person infected with COVID-19 in Singapore on January 23rd, 2020 marked the start
of Singapore’s fight against the pandemic [5]. The government updated the Disease Outbreak
Response System Condition (DORSCON) status to Orange on February 7th 2020, and
introduced new measures to minimize transmission in the community [6]. The circuit breaker
(CB) i.e. lockdown, was announced on April 7th 2020 following increased cases in the
community [7]. Subsequently, increased restrictions were implemented to curb the
transmission of the diseases. Services such as rehabilitation had to be suspended. Singapore
entered Phase 1 of reopening on June 1st 2020, gradually easing restrictions on previously
restricted services. However, social distancing measures are still being implemented to curb
spread of the virus [8] .
Social service agencies (SSA) provide aids to their beneficiaries. These aids include
rehabilitation facilities that provide counselling services for patients. However, the COVID-19
pandemic has affected how they provided support whilst adhering to social distancing
guidelines [9–11]. For example, Singapore Cancer Society (SCS), a cancer-related SSA
(cancer-SSA) specializing in providing support to cancer patients, had many of their
rehabilitation and transport services suspended or restricted. As communication with
beneficiaries became limited due to these restrictions, the level of support these SSAs could
provide during the COVID-19 pandemic was severely diminished.
A total of 71,265 cancer cases were reported between 2013-2017 in Singapore [12], with
roughly 39 people diagnosed on a daily basis [13]. This number is still increasing, and with it,
the need to support cancer patients increases. Support becomes crucial during the pandemic, as
cancer patients cannot receive the same level of support compared to the pre-COVID-19 period.
Cancer patients may be at a higher risk of contracting the coronavirus during this time, and
they may not want to leave their home to attend essential cancer care sessions. The prolonged
stay at home also prevents them from receiving face-to-face counselling from SSAs, which

may lead to detrimental consequences to their mental health and wellbeing. Since cancer-SSAs
are unable to continue with existing services as per normal, they will have to develop new
strategies to communicate and guide beneficiaries in taking ownership of their health at home.
Many businesses have turned to social media as a platform to connect with consumers since
in-person communication has become limited during the pandemic. A global study showed
that media consumption increased by 61% compared to normal period, with an 40% increase
in social media consumption on Facebook from the start of the pandemic to April 2020 [14].
Overall, social media presence for businesses is important during this period for
communicating with their consumers. This statement applies to cancer-SSAs as well. Prior to
the pandemic, these SSAs already had an online presence to connect and communicate with
their beneficiaries. This pandemic has turned social media into a key platform for cancer-SSAs
to share updates and information with cancer patients, but it remains to be seen whether these
SSAs have improved their social media presence during the pandemic.
A previous study evaluated the role that social media played in health promotion in Singapore
[15]. The study focused on Facebook posts published by the Singapore Health Promotion
Board (HPB), analyzing the contents of the posts, and quantifying the level of audience
engagement. They found that Facebook posts were well structured to effectively promote
health-related information and activities while being warmly received by online audiences.
Other studies have concluded that SSAs benefit from social media in improving current
communication channels [16] and there is potential in social media for boosting health
promotion opportunities, and behavioral changes for their audience [17].
However, no studies have been conducted to assess the effectiveness of social media for cancerSSAs in Singapore in sharing information and promoting heath to their followers. Furthermore,
no studies have been conducted to evaluate how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the
support activities of cancer-SSAs and their social presence. This study aims to conduct a social
media analysis to analyze the trends of cancer-SSA’s Facebook posts during the COVID-19
pandemic. The first objective of the study is to compare the number of posts posted by each
cancer-SSA between 2019 and 2020, and across three nominated periods in 2020. The second
objective is to evaluate the content of these posts to ascertain whether the COVID-19 pandemic
has had any impact in the types of posts shared by the SSAs. Two cancer-SSAs were identified
for the purposes of this study. They are Singapore Cancer Society (SCS) and 365 Cancer
Prevention Society (365CPS).

2. Data and Methods
2.1 Data Extraction and Timeline
We identified Facebook posts by cancer-SSAs in Singapore to be the unit of analysis for the
study. Data was extracted from Facebook using the Facepager software [18,19]. The
timeframes for data collection were (i): January 23rd 2019 to June 1st 2019, and (ii) January
23rd 2020 to June 1st 2020. January 23rd was selected as the starting date as it was the same date
in 2020 when the first person in Singapore was infected with COVID-19. June 1st was selected
as the ending date as it was the start of Phase 1 of post-CB in 2020 when more restrictions had
been lifted. For the purpose of comparison, corresponding timeframes were selected in 2019.
2020 was split further into the following three periods to reflect the evolution of policy
measures pertaining to COVID-19: (i) Period 1 (P1): January 23rd 2020 to February 7th 2020,
(ii) Period 2 (P2): February 8th 2020 to April 7th 2020 and (iii) Period 3 (P3): April 8th 2020 to
June 1st 2020. Period 1 (P1) represented the period from the start of COVID-19 in Singapore
until the implementation of DORSCON Orange in Singapore. Period 2 (P2) represented the
period from the start of DORSCON Orange in Singapore until the start of CB. Period 3 (P3)
represented the period from the start of CB until the end of CB. Singapore’s Phase 1 post-CB
was not included in this study as we wished to look at how the restrictive nature of CB affected
the ways in which cancer-SSAs provided support and services to beneficiaries online. Social
distancing measures and restrictions varied among the three periods, and different restrictions
might have caused cancer-SSAs to adopt different strategies during each segment.
2.2 Exclusion Criteria
We did not include posts published on other social media platforms by the two cancer-SSAs.
Other cancer-related societies such as Children’s Cancer Foundation and Breast Cancer
Foundation were too specific in terms of the type of cancer or the target demographic. Hence,
they were not included in this study. Posts without any text content were not analyzed in this
study. Photos and videos were not included in the analysis. Non-English posts were not
considered for the study.
2.3 Developing the Classification Categories for the Facebook Posts
Two coders classified the Facebook posts into their respective categories. Intercoder reliability
was calculated based on the method described in Wimmer and Dominick [20]. Coders were

briefed on the coding process and the classification scheme. A one-hour training session was
conducted for the coders to familiarize themselves with the scheme and procedure using posts
published by the two SSAs outside of the study timeframe, as described by Lacy et al [21]. The
first pilot study was conducted using 50 posts from the study. Krippendorf’s alpha coefficient
was calculated and used to assess intercoder reliability, with a coefficient of 0.80 or higher
being deemed acceptable. Results from the first pilot study was sub-optimal and a second pilot
study using 50 different posts from the study was conducted. A coefficient greater than 0.80
was achieved for the second pilot study. Subsequently, coding began for all posts from the
study, with the primary coder coding for all Facebook posts, and the secondary coder coding
104 out of 244 posts to ensure the categorization of these Facebook posts remain reliable. The
number of posts calculated for each pilot study and the actual study for reliability testing was
based on the equation suggested by Lacy and Riffe for nominal content categories [22].
2.4 Statistical Analysis
For comparing the number of Facebook posts across time periods, Poisson regression was used.
To compare the proportion of posts assigned to a particular category between the time periods
for each category, the Chi-square test and Fisher’s exact test were used. All statistical tests
were two-tailed and were performed at a significance level of 0.05. Two separate comparisons
were tested: the first comparison between each year, and the second comparison between each
nominated period in 2020. 2019 was used as a baseline to see how COVID-19 affected the
cancer-SSA’s social media presence in 2020. The comparison between each nominated period
in 2020 was conducted to evaluate if the different levels of social distancing measures adopted
in each period has had a significant impact in the number and types of posts being published
by the cancer-SSAs.

3. Results
3.1 Posting Frequency of Cancer-SSAs in Facebook
Figure 1 illustrates the number of monthly posts published by 365CPS and SCS for the analysis
periods in 2019 and 2020. A total of 97 posts were extracted from 365CPS’s Facebook page.
96 posts were included in the study, with 1 post being excluded as its message was in Chinese.
For all six months, the number of posts was higher in 2020 (n=66) compared to 2019 (n=30)
(z=3.58, p-value<0.001). Additionally, the number of posts in 2020 were different across the
three nominated periods at a statistically significant level (z=2.39, p-value=0.0171). 365CPS

began publishing more posts since February 2020, coinciding with the announcement of
DORSCON Orange in Singapore, with March 2020 recording the highest number of monthly
posts (n=16).
A total of 148 posts were extracted from SCS’s Facebook page and all 148 posts were included
in the study. The number of posts was higher in 2019 (n=82) than 2020 (n=66) except for May
2020. SCS started publishing more monthly posts in 2020 since CB started on April 7th, 2020.
May 2020 also recorded the highest number of monthly posts for SCS (n=26). There was no
statistically significant difference between the number of posts by SCS in 2019 and 2020 (z=1.313, p-value=0.189). However, there was a statistically significant difference when
comparing the number of posts by SCS across the three nominated periods in 2020 (z = 2.961,
p-value=0.00307).

3.2 Identification of Categories for Classifying Facebook Posts
10 categories were identified based on preliminary examination of the Facebook posts
extracted from the two cancer-SSAs. In Table 1, the categories and their descriptions are listed.
Certain aspects of a cancer survivorship care model proposed in Singapore were also used in
conceptualizing the categories [23]. This survivorship care model defines five principles

deemed important for survivorship care in Singapore. Two principles were used in the study
for developing a few categories. The first principle from the model, ‘Survivor-Centered Care’,
was defined as engaging cancer survivors and empowering them to take ownership of their
own health and survivorship. This principle was adapted in this study, with categories such as
Educational materials on cancer, Nutritional information and advice, and Lifestyle changes.
Posts classified under these categories would be seen as the cancer-SSA’s attempt to provide
more information about cancer for the public to educate and empower them. The second
principle ‘Promotion of wellness’ was defined to include community-based programs and
activities to promote healthy living, self-monitoring and the prevention of the disease itself.
This principle was adapted in this study to include categories such as Promotion of services
and Promotion of programs and events [23].
The category Psychosocial support was not adapted from the survivorship care model but was
included as cancer is an emotionally taxing disease which affects the patient and their family
members. The mental and social health of those affected should be taken into consideration by
the cancer-SSAs when publishing posts promoting a positive mindset or encouragement[24].
Other categories such as Donations and COVID-19 related news were not part of the
survivorship care model and were included based on preliminary examination of extracted
Facebook posts. Posts that did not fall into any of the abovementioned categories were
classified under Others.

3.3. Cancer-SSAs’ Posts by Category
Table 2 presents the number of posts published by 365CPS per category, to facilitate the
comparison between 2019 and 2020, as well as across the three nominated periods in 2020.
There are significant differences in the content of the posts between 2019 and 2020. An increase
in posts requesting for donations can be seen in 2020 (n=10) compared to 2019 (n=0), as well
as posts that promotes educational materials on cancer in 2020 (n=5) compared to 2019 (n=0).
Within 2020, there was an increase in the number of posts promoting lifestyle changes from
March 2020 to May 2020 compared to January and February 2020. A statistically significant
difference was found for the proportion of posts categorized under donations between 2019
and 2020 (χ2=5.647, p-value=0.032). There was no statistically significant difference in the
number of posts between 2019 and 2020 or across the three nominated periods in 2020 for
other categories.

Note: P-values were calculated based on whether there was a statistically significant difference in the proportion
of posts under a specific category between 2019 and 2020, and across P1, P2, P3 of 2020. *P-value was not
calculated for the proportion of posts under ‘COVID-19 related news’ between 2019 and 2020 because COVID19 only occurred after the timeframe analysed in 2019. **As the number of posts under ‘Psychological Support’
category is 0 across all 3 periods, the p value cannot be calculated for the test as no difference can be found.

Table 3 presents the number of SCS posts listed for each category for 2019 and 2020. Similar
to 365CPS, there were more posts requesting for donations in 2020 (n=7) compared to 2019
(n=1). More nutritional information was also provided in 2020 (n=4) than 2019 (n=0),
especially during CB as can be seen in April 2020 (n=1) and May 2020 (n=3). Between 2019
and 2020, a statistically significant difference was found for the proportions of posts
categorized as nutritional information and advice (p-value = 0.038) and for the proportions of
posts categorized as donations (p-value=0.022). Across the three periods in 2020, a statistically
significant difference was found for the proportion of posts categorized as promotions of
services (χ2=7.99, p-value=0.007) and the proportion of posts categorized as psychosocial
support (χ2=15.178, p-value<0.0001). The other statistical tests showed no statistically
significant difference.

Note: P-values were calculated based on whether there was a statistically significant difference in the proportion
of posts under a specific category between 2019 and 2020, and across P1, P2, P3 of 2020. *P-value was not
calculated for the proportion of posts under ‘COVID-19 related news’ between 2019 and 2020 because COVID19 only occurred after the timeframe analyzed in 2019.

4. Discussion
To our best knowledge, this is the first study which looks at how the COVID-19 pandemic has
affected the outreach efforts of cancer-SSAs in Singapore on a social media platform.
Compared to 2019, 365CPS published more than twice the number of posts in 2020. This is
due to the monthly cancer awareness programs that 365CPS conducted, such as ‘Gallbladder
Cancer Awareness Month’ in February 2020 and ‘Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month’ in
March 2020 [25]. Perhaps, as physical roadshows cannot be conducted, 365CPS has shifted
their focus to promote cancer awareness through Facebook posts. A literature review on social
media use by patients concluded that social media platforms such as Facebook provide an
excellent tool to rapidly disseminate important health information whilst providing a platform
for the public to engage relevant health authorities for further inquiries.[26] Hence, the use of
social media by 365CPS will allow them to easily and rapidly disseminate information to their
social media followers.
The number of posts by SCS in 2020 was lower than 2019, especially for February and March.
There were two events in 2019 which were not repeated in 2020. For example, in February and
March 2019, CSC rolled out the ‘I Do’ series and ‘Motivation Monday Posts’ [27,28]. The ‘I

Do’ series was a 5-episode series which detailed a love story entangled in cancer. ‘Motivation
Mondays’ were a series of encouragement posts published on Mondays to provide emotional
support to their followers. We are curious why the event was not repeated or conducted in a
modified form in 2020, especially for the ‘Motivation Mondays’ series, which appears to be
much needed during COVID-19 pandemic.
Regarding the three nominated periods in 2020, 365CPS posted the most in P2 compared to
the other periods. However, the number of posts per day decreases across the three periods (P1:
0.67 posts per day, P2: 0.51 posts per day, P3: 0.48 posts per day). In addition to the cancer
awareness months which contributed to an increase in the number of posts from February to
April 2020, 365CPS also posted content that encouraged the public to engage in certain health
related activities from the comforts of their own homes. This posting pattern coincided with
the CB period when the Singaporean government encouraged people to stay home to prevent
the spread of the virus [29]. Some of these activities included lymphatic exercises [30] and
recipes to boost immunity [31], which allowed beneficiaries to take ownership of their own
health during COVID-19 where access to facilities and resources provided by 365CPS were
limited.
For SCS, there was an increase in the number of posts in P3 compared to the other periods. On
top of regular posts focusing on cancer awareness [32], SCS also informed the public on
changes to their services and events due to additional social distancing measures during CB
[33,34]. Similar to 365CPS, SCS posted contents related to activities and events which the
public could undertake at home during CB. Such content included introducing healthy recipes
and activities such as online bingo, a social media trend during CB [35].
While reviewing the contents of the posts according to our classification scheme, we found that
the number of posts by SCS promoting services in 2019 was higher than 2020, which could be
attributed to the ease of hosting physical events during the pre-COVID period when there was
no social distancing measures. Nevertheless, SCS still attempted to reach out to their
beneficiaries, encouraging active cancer screening to continue during CB and continuing to
provide accessible care for their patients [36].
After an initial quiet period in P1, SCS started to promote more of their services in P2 and P3
of 2020. The promotion of FIT Kits provided by SCS as part of their ‘Colorectal cancer
awareness month’ in March 2020 was evident [37]. This also included the promotion of
cervical cancer screening as part of their ‘Women’s gynecological cancer awareness campaign’

[38]. It is heartening to see that promotion of cancer prevention is not hampered by CB.
However, we are unable to judge the effectiveness of promoting cancer prevention through
social media in our study. For example, we do not know if the take-up rates for FIT Kits and
cervical cancer screening have increased due to the use of social media platform.
365CPS did not publish any posts related to educational materials on cancer in 2019, but
published five posts in 2020 to promote cancer-related information to the public, with most of
these posts in P2 of 2020. These posts encouraged regular and early health screening to prevent
the risk of cancer [25], and provide more information on the type of psychosocial needs that a
cancer patient requires [39]. Whilst the increase in the number of posts in this category from
2019 to 2020, and across the three periods in 2020 was not statistically significant, it can be
seen that 365CPS is attempting to provide more resources and information to the public about
cancer, encouraging their beneficiaries to take charge of their own health and empowering them
to be more invested in their healthcare.
In contrast, SCS had fewer posts on educational materials on cancer in 2020 than 2019.
Nevertheless, they started sharing more programs for their followers during P3 compared to
the other two periods in 2020. For instance, there was a focus on their interschool competition
which encouraged the public to learn more about the projects they had in collaboration with
different schools in contributing to their mission of ‘minimising cancer and maximising lives’
[40]. In addition, learning more about the projects provides the public with the benefit of
learning more about the topics discussed during the competition, showing how SCS is
empowering their followers to continue educating themselves on the different aspects of cancer
during COVID-19.
365CPS had more posts requesting for volunteers in 2020. This may be due to a drop in the
number of available volunteers to assist beneficiaries during the pandemic for reasons such as
social distancing measures and a fear of contracting the virus by being out of the home [41].
Volunteers form a core part of any SSA. Hence, the appeal for volunteers is expected. In
addition, 365CPS introduced a series of Lymphatic Detox Exercises that the public could
undertake. These were originally physical lessons which had to be suspended during CB [42].
As a result, 365CPS began structuring their exercises such that the public could participate
from their homes [43].
We had anticipated an increase in the number of posts related to nutritional information and
advice as more people were staying at home and presumably cooking at home. However, we

did not observe any statistically significant difference in the number of posts between 2019 and
2020 or across the three nominated periods in 2020. Nonetheless, we do observe a difference
in the contents of the posts related to nutritional information and advice. In 2020, there were
more posts by 365CPS on healthy recipes whereas in 2019, the contents were related to
information on healthy eating and food safety rather than recipes [27]. Providing healthy
recipes for their followers to try at home is not the only one way of educating the public in
eating healthily to prevent cancer, but also to encourage people to remain at homes and adhere
to social distancing measures. SCS did not publish any post related to nutritional information
and advice in 2019 but published four such posts in P3 2020. Their posts also share healthy
recipes for the public to try at home while during CB, with the hashtag ‘#stayhomeforSG’
indicating that such recipes were meant to encourage people to stay home during CB.
There was an increase in the number of posts related to lifestyle changes for 365CPS from P1
to P3 in 2020. Posts focused on coping with worries and anxieties was a new theme in 2020.
These posts reflect the anticipated increase in the level of anxiety among their beneficiaries
and other issues that may arise from experiencing either a prolonged confinement in one
location, or a change in job situation due to the pandemic [44]. It is encouraging to note that
365CPS is sensitive to the changing needs of their beneficiaries.
We were surprised to note that that the number of posts related to psychosocial support dropped
significantly from P1 to P2 and P3 in 2020 for SCS, with no posts from P2 and P3. Most of the
posts under this category in P1 was part of SCS’s initiatives during World Cancer Day to
showcase local celebrities pledging their support to fight cancer. Psychosocial support is
important during the COVID-19 period due to long periods of confinement which may have
detrimental effects on one’s mental wellbeing, especially if one has a debilitating condition
such as cancer [45]. With CB moving people to more online activities, it is even more important
that avenues of support were provided for cancer patients by the SSAs. Unfortunately, this was
not the case for both SCS and 365CPS, with the latter having no posts falling under this
category in 2020.
In 2020, 365CPS shared more donations related posts. As physical fundraising activities could
not be held during CB, SSAs such as 365CPS turned to social media platforms to request for
donations. As SSAs rely primarily on donations to sustain their operations, the increase in posts
requesting donations from the public is understandable. For 365CPS, their donations posts
were usually accompanied by more information on how beneficiaries can benefit from the

support from the public, and provide links for the public to find out how they can better support
beneficiaries [46]. The increase in donations-related posts was also observed for SCS from
2019 to 2020, especially from P1 and P2 to P3 in 2020. For SCS, their request for donations
were often tagged with a seasonal greeting on the day of a public holiday, such as Vesak day
[47]. An online musical performance was also featured along with a request for donations to
SCS [48]. By moving their donation drives online, SSAs may be able to target more age groups
cost-effectively, including older internet users, whose numbers have jumped significantly in
the past few years [49]. Another benefit of online fundraising is its reach to willing donors who
otherwise would not be able to attend physical fundraising activities, thus providing more
people with an opportunity to give back to society.
There are certain limitations in our study. Only two cancer-SSAs and their Facebook posts
were included in our study. Thus, our findings may not be representative of other cancer-SSAs
or other social media platforms. Regardless, Facebook is the most popular social media
platform with the highest number of monthly active users. Thus, analyzing Facebook posts
would be the most efficient option compared to analyzing other platforms [50]. Another point
to note was that the survivorship care model used in this study focused on providing care and
support to cancer survivors whilst this study looked at both cancer patients and the general
public. Some aspects of the model such as ‘Robust adaptive patient assessment program’ did
not apply to cancer-SSAs as their extent of support and care do not including assessing the
health issues of cancer patients. Nevertheless, most aspects of the model were applicable in the
context of cancer-SSAs providing support and services to their beneficiaries and the general
public.
This research can be extended in future studies for analyzing all cancer-SSAs or focus on other
social media platforms utilized by these cancer-SSAs such as YouTube or Instagram. Another
potential topic for further studies includes analyzing the level of follower engagement achieved
through these posts to ascertain whether the cancer-SSAs have successfully achieved an
optimum level of engagement with their beneficiaries and the general public.

5. Conclusions
Our study aimed to understand the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the outreach
strategies on Facebook of two cancer-related SSAs for supporting their beneficiaries. We found
that 365CPS published more posts in 2020 than 2019, especially during the period where more
people were encouraged to stay home. However, SCS published fewer posts in 2020 than 2019,

even though in 2020, they published more posts during CB. The different restrictions
implemented across the three nominated periods had a slight effect on the type of content
published by the SSAs. During P2 and P3, the posts were focused on activities or programs
that the public could undertake while staying at home. There was also an obvious increase in
the number of requests for donations in 2020, as well as the promotion of lifestyle changes for
their beneficiaries to cope with their condition as well as the pandemic. However, posts to
provide psychosocial support or encouragement were lacking for both SSAs.
Overall, the efforts taken by the SSAs in adapting to the COVID-19 pandemic and providing
important health information and support for their beneficiaries online are applaudable. Our
analyses could help SSAs to reflect on their responses to the pandemic. While COVID-19 was
unexpected, the same cannot be said of the next pandemic. SSAs should continue learning from
the COVID-19 pandemic. One step forward would be to develop a better strategy for their
social media posts aimed at not only continuously providing accessible care to the public but
also empowering the public to take ownership of their own health, especially during future
pandemics.
