Abstract
Background
The evidence on risk factors for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in community settings is sparse,
yet this information is key to inform public health action. We investigated factors associated with
being a COVID-19 case using data collected through contact tracing.

Methods
We conducted three retrospective, frequency-matched case-control studies between August
2020 and October 2020 using case data from the NHS Test and Trace programme. Controls
were obtained through Market Research Panels. Multivariable analyses provided adjusted odds
ratios (aORs) for multiple community exposure settings. We analysed the results in metaanalyses using random effects models to obtain pooled odds ratios (pORs).

Results
Across all study periods, there was strong statistical evidence that working in healthcare (pOR
2.87, aOR range 2.72-3.08), social care (pOR 4.15, aOR range 2.46-5.41) or hospitality (pOR
2.36, aOR range 2.01-2.63) were associated with increased odds of being a COVID-19 case.
There was also evidence that working in warehouse setting was associated with increased odds
(pOR 3.86, aOR range 1.06-14.19), with a substantial increase in odds observed over the study
periods. A similar pattern was also observed in education and construction.

Conclusions
The studies indicate that some workplace settings are associated with increased odds of being
a case. However, it is not possible to determine how much of the transmission of SARS-CoV-2
took place within the workplace, and how much was associated with social, household or
transport exposures.

Background
Non-pharmaceutical interventions have played a critical role in the COVID-19 response, and
are likely to remain core interventions for the foreseeable future despite the promising advances
in vaccination programmes. Governments and Public Health authorities rely on the evidence on
factors associated with transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to inform control programmes including
restrictions to activities. Transmission is determined by contact patterns, environmental and
socioeconomic factors (Cevik et al., 2020). It can occur in most settings, but some settings are
likely to facilitate or amplify the risk of transmission due to a combination of behavioural and
environmental factors (Meyerowitz et al., 2020). Situations in which there is close-proximity
contact, contact that is sustained over a prolonged period of time or multiple contacts in a
confined poorly ventilated space pose the greatest risk for SARS-CoV-2 transmission (Cevik et
al., 2020). There is growing evidence that the risk of COVID-19 is highest in household settings,
and that living in an overcrowded or multiple occupancy household increases the risk of
becoming a COVID-19 case (Lee et al., 2020).
There is also an increasing amount of evidence on the risk of COVID-19 among healthcare
workers (Nguyen et al., 2020; ECDC 2020; Leclerc et al., 2020). Certain community settings
have also been associated with transmission. Hospitality venues including restaurants, night
clubs and bars have been reported as common exposures in large outbreaks and clusters of
COVID-19 (Furuse et al., 2020; ECDC, 2020; Lu et al., 2020, Fisher et al., 2020). Outbreaks
have also been reported in some occupational settings including factories and warehouses
(ECDC, 2020) and in educational settings (Ismail et al., 2020). However, information on the role
any community setting has in facilitating transmission is still developing and limited (Lee et al.,
2020).
The evidence on the risk of transmission in specific settings and activities is sparse but this
information is crucial for evidence-based control measures for COVID-19. We investigated the
association between occupation and infection among cases identified through the NHS Test
and Trace programme in England through three retrospective case-control studies conducted
monthly at the end of August, September and October 2020.

Methods
Study design and setting

We conducted three retrospective case-control studies, which were frequency-matched for age
and geographical region. The study periods for the three studies were late August, late
September, and late October 2020. The study population consisted of adults over 18 years old
resident in England. Cases were people who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and
completed the National Health Service Test and Trace (NHS T&T) contact tracing
questionnaire.
The controls were members of the public, registered as volunteers for a Market Research Panel,
and who were not household contacts of a confirmed case. Controls were excluded if they had
tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, or reported COVID-19 symptoms in the seven days prior to
completing the survey. Figure 1 outlines the recruitment process and study flow.

Data collection

The data for the cases was collected through NHS T&T, where cases provided the information
either through a digital route (self-completed) or through being interviewed over the phone. The
NHS T&T assigns three different exposure levels for any given activity; the high-level categories
being household or overnight stay, or work or leisure activity, with the following levels providing
further granularity on the exposure reported. Controls completed an online survey with same
exposure questions. However, they were not asked to provide details about their contacts for
each exposure.

Statistical analysis
Crude odds ratios (cORs) were obtained for each main exposure. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs)
were obtained through multivariable analyses using penalised regression methods (see Firth,
1993). The main exposures for which the adjusted odds ratio showed evidence of an
association were replaced in the multivariable analysis by their granular level exposures.
Finally, we conducted a random-effects meta-analysis across the three studies to investigate
how the association between exposure settings and the odds of infection differed in the three
studies and to obtain pooled odds ratios (pORs).

Results
Descriptive analysis
Across the three studies, a total of 12,338 individuals were recruited, of which 6,000 were cases.
Females were overrepresented with 6,926 (56%) participants, of which 3,268 (47%) were
cases. There was a greater proportion of individuals in the control group that were of white
ethnicity (83%) compared to the cases (65%), although ethnicity was not recorded in 9% of
case respondents. A greater proportion of cases lived in areas of low deprivation (17%) than
controls (12%), although deprivation score was unknown for a large proportion of control
respondents (11%). Distribution was largely similar for all other demographic variables. (Table
1).

Single variable analysis by study period
Working in social or home care, health care and working in hospitality were associated with
being a case in all three study periods. Additionally, studies 2 and 3 showed evidence that
working in a warehouse, emergency services, and close contact services were each associated
with being a case. Furthermore, in these two periods, working or attending education was
associated with increased odds of illness (Table 2).

Multivariable analysis by study period
All multivariable analyses were adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic deprivation
(using index for multiple deprivation (IMD)), geographical region, and non-work community and
leisure activities. All three studies provided strong statistical evidence of an association between
working in healthcare, social care, or hospitality and becoming a COVID-19 case. Working in a
warehouse, education or in construction were associated with increased odds of infection in the
second and third study periods.

We also analysed leisure activities for both cases and controls. However, the results from these
analyses were less consistent, apart from strong evidence that cases were more likely to
engage in entertainment activities than controls (aORs range 5.38-11.64). In particular, going
to pubs and bars was associated with increased odds of illness in the first and second study
periods (aORs range 1.85-2.38). The full results from these analyses are provided in the

The odds ratios for work exposures used in the meta-analyses were adjusted for age, sex,
ethnicity, index for multiple deprivation, geographical region, and non-work community
activities. There remained strong statistical evidence that working in healthcare (pOR 2.87, aOR
range 2.72-3.08), social care (pOR 4.15, aOR range 2.46-5.41) or hospitality (pOR 2.36, aOR
range 2.01-2.63) were associated with increased odds of being a COVID-19 case. There was
evidence that working in warehouse setting was associated with increased odds (pOR 3.86,
aOR range 1.06-14.19), however; there was a high heterogeneity between the three study
periods (I2 = 78%, P=0.01), with a substantial increase in odds observed over the study periods.
A similar pattern was also observed in education and construction. Figure 2 presents the full
results.

Meta-analysis of the three case-control study periods – ungrouped occupational
exposures
We explored the association between occupational exposures and infection using more
granular information on work activities. Figure 3 presents the findings from these models. Cases
had higher odds of working in warehouse than controls (pOR 5.55, aOR range 1.72-24.06).
There was evidence that secondary school settings were associated with increased odds of
being a COVID-19 case (pOR 2.56, aOR range 1.52-2.93). There was also strong statistical
evidence across all studies that working in bars, restaurants and pubs was associated with
elevated odds of being a case (pOR 2.86, aOR range 2.41-3.52). Working in hospital was linked
with increased odds of COVID-19 (pOR 3.19, aOR range 2.29-4.06). There was also evidence
of working in general practice surgeries (GPs) being associated with elevated odds of being a
COVID-19 case (pOR 1.47, aOR range 0.51-2.71). However, there was substantial
heterogeneity between studies for this setting (I2 69.4%), with an increase in the adjusted odds
ratios over the study periods.

Discussion
We observed strong associations between certain occupations and SARS-CoV-2 infection. The
association with working in health and social care or in hospitality persisted across the three
studies. Working in warehouse or in manufacturing and construction, or exposure to educational
setting were associated with increased odds of being a COVID-19 case.
Our findings on the associations between infection and working in manufacturing, construction,
and warehouse settings are consistent with the current evidence on most commonly reported
outbreak settings (ECDC, 2020). The findings on educational settings are consistent with the
recent evidence available on COVID-19 in these settings (Ismail et al., 2020). The findings
regarding the association observed between working in health and social care settings and
being a COVID-19 case were anticipated as these settings were closely associated with
transmission in the first wave of the epidemic and, despite the appropriate use of personal
protective equipment, healthcare workers experience high COVID-19 infection rates (Nguyen
et al., 2020; Leclerc et al., 2020; ECDC, 2020). However, the findings from our studies highlight
the risk associated with these settings, including hospitals and primary care settings like GPs.
Public health guidance and advice to reduce the risk of transmission in workplace settings have
been published and disseminated (BEIS, 2020). It is likely that within the same occupational
sector there will be examples of good and poor practice in the implementation of measures to
mitigate transmission, and the risk of transmission is likely to vary from setting to setting within
a sector. In addition, our study does not determine where each case was infected, or where
transmission occurred, however, the associations we have observed are likely to reflect that it
is more challenging to mitigate risk in some sectors compared to others. The observations
presented here may be confounded by other factors including living arrangements, transport to
work or socio-economic factors not explained by small area deprivation. For example, most of
the cases who reported working in warehouses, or construction and manufacturing also resided
in areas of high deprivation (results not shown) and it is possible that they may be more likely
to live in multiple occupancy households, or travel together to work. However, the findings from
this study provide useful evidence that can inform risk assessments and target public health
action, especially as they provide data from a three-month period, with some consistent
estimates of an association over time.
To the best of our knowledge, these are the only COVID-19 case-control studies conducted in
England. As such, they provide a valuable insight into community risk factors for COVID-19 in
England, and findings which are likely to be transferrable to other similar settings. They have
provided timely evidence and allowed concurrent data collection from both cases and controls.

Limitations
Limitations of the present study can be grouped into categories relating to means of data
collection, sampling and selection bias, misclassification bias and confounding. Across all three
studies, cases reported a smaller overall number of exposures than controls. The information
from cases was collected at the point of contact tracing. It is possible that some cases may not
have provided full or accurate information. One possible explanation for this is that the NHS T&T
requires cases to record their contacts for each exposure, which substantially increases the time
and effort required to record every exposure. This differential misclassification of exposure most
likely biased the effect measures towards the null, hence the results described here are more
likely to be underestimates than overestimates.

There is also potential for selection bias. Cases were randomly sampled from cases over 18
years of age in the NHS T&T system, which contains exposure information for all COVID-19
cases in England. Since approximately 85% of the cases transferred to the NHS T&T system
are reached by the contact tracing programme (DHSC, 2020), there is likely to be some selection
bias among cases if those who do not engage in contact tracing differ from the rest in terms of
their exposures. Furthermore, the study does not include infected people who are not tested.
The controls were sampled from a pool of volunteers using Market Research Panels, which
most likely introduced some selection bias for controls. People registered on Market Research
Panels may differ from the general population in their likelihood to engage in activities outside
household setting. Furthermore, people registered on the Market Research Panel who chose to
participate in the present study might differ from those registered on the Panel but who did not
engage with the study. It is therefore likely that our sample of controls does not accurately
represent the adult population of England. In addition, the present analyses could only control
for confounding by exposures that data were available on, and therefore, residual confounding
is likely to persist. For example, our analyses did not account for any behavioural change due
to local restrictions.

Conclusions
The studies identified that some workplace settings are associated with increased odds of being
a case. However, it is not possible to determine how much of the transmission of SARS-CoV-2
took place within the workplace, and how much was associated with social, household or

setting.
