Abstract
Background: There is global shortage of Personal Protective Equipment due to COVID19 pandemic. N95 Filtering Facepiece Respirators (N95-FFRs) provide respiratory protection
against respiratory pathogens including SARS-COV-2. There is scant literature on
reprocessing methods which can enable reuse of N95-FFRs.

Aim: We conducted this study to evaluate research done, prior to COVID-19 pandemic, on
various decontamination methods for reprocessing of N95-FFRs.

Methods: We searched 5 electronic databases (Pubmed, Google Scholar, Crossref, Ovid,
ScienceDirect) and 1 Grey literature database (OpenGrey). We included original studies,
published prior to year 2020, which had evaluated any decontamination method on FFRs.
Studies had evaluated a reprocessing method against parameters namely physical changes,
user acceptability, respirator fit, filter efficiency, microbicidal efficacy and presence of
chemical residues post-reprocessing.

Findings and Conclusions:

Overall, we found 7887 records amongst which 17

original research articles were finally included for qualitative analysis. Overall, 21 different
types of decontamination or reprocessing methods for N95-FFRs were evaluated. Most
commonly evaluated method for reprocessing of FFRs was Ultraviolet (Type-C) irradiation
(UVGI) which was evaluated in 13/17 (76%) studies.
We found published literature is scant on this topic despite warning signs of pandemic of a
respiratory illness over the years. Promising technologies requiring expeditious evaluation are
UVGI, Microwave generated steam (MGS) and Hydrogen peroxide vapor (HPV). Global
presence of technologies, which have been given Emergency use authorisation for N95-FFR

Introduction
Global pandemic of Corona Virus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) has led to over 10
million cases and half-a-million deaths worldwide and still counting[1]. It is caused by a
novel Corona virus (nCOV), a member of family Coronaviridae, now renamed as SARSCOV-2[2]. Transmission of this virus occurs through direct, contact and airborne routes[3].
Consequently, healthcare workers (HCWs) requires a full set of personal protective
equipment (PPE) including gowns, gloves, facemasks, face-shields or goggles and respirators
for their protection during patient care[4]. This has created an unprecedented demand for
PPEs leading to their global shortage forcing administrative authorities to relook the
recommendations of PPE usage in a whole new light[5]. Previously, focus of PPE use
strategy was not to share them between patients[6] however, due to this unprecedented crisis,
it has radically shifted to optimizing the use of PPEs, their extended use and limited
reuse[4,5,7]. Respiratory protection is one of the fundamental rights of any employee in
workplace. In healthcare settings, HCWs need to be protected against bioaerosols at all costs,
which at minimum, is offered by use of N95 Filtering Facepiece Respirator (N95-FFR) which
removes > 95% particles of around 300 nm[6]. They are single use devices ought to be
discarded after use to avoid cross contamination[8].

Shortage of FFRs is not new, pangs of which were first felt during 2003 SARS outbreak[9]. It
has been predicted for an impending influenza pandemic consequent to which U.S. Strategic
National Stockpile had plans for providing 100 million N95-FFRs nationally, but it was
deemed insufficient in event of a longer pandemic[9–11]. Hence, in 2006, Institute of
Medicine (IOM) constituted a committee to address reusability of facemasks. Reuse of an
FFR was defined as repeatedly donning and doffing of respirator by the same wearer, with or
without undergoing reprocessing in between, till it is discarded. The committee
recommended reuse of respirators in the event of acute shortage provided they are not
obviously damaged or soiled[11]. However, committee specified that no method exists
currently for reprocessing of N95-FFRs and identified it as a research priority[11].
Consequently, various research groups began their quest to search a reprocessing method
which is efficacious against respiratory pathogens, is safe for human use and maintains the
integrity of various components of the respirator. Even after a decade of research, prior to
COVID-19 pandemic, no method has been recommended for reprocessing of N95-FFRs.
Hence, we conducted this systematic review to determine the status of research done, prior to
COVID-19 pandemic, to identify technologies which can be utilized for reprocessing of N95FFRs in present situation and can be explored in near future to tackle the global crisis of
respirator shortage.

Methods
We report this systematic review (PROSPERO ID: CRD42020189684) in accordance
with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)
guidelines[12] and checklist is provided in S1 Table.

Search strategy
We searched five databases – Pubmed, Google Scholar, Crossref, Ovid and
ScienceDirect in May 2020. Grey literature was searched using OpenGrey repository. Search
strategies employing combinations of various keywords is provided in S2 Table. Searches in
Google Scholar and Crossref were done using Publish or Perish 7 software (Harzing, A.W.
2007) to limit article hits and sort relevant ones. Additionally, we manually searched the back
references of included studies and relevant review articles on the topic to identify further
eligible studies. Articles in languages other than English were considered only when their
abstracts were available in English.

Eligibility criteria
Original research articles in any language, which evaluated a single or multiple
decontamination or reprocessing methods on N95-FFRs were eligible for analysis in this
study. Exclusion criteria were (i) Abstracts, posters, review articles, book chapters, letters,
guidelines, point of views (ii) articles published in year 2020 and (iii) involving reprocessing
or decontamination of other types of masks or respirators such as Gauze, Cloth, Spun-lace,
Elastomeric and Powered-air-purifying, only.

Data Extraction
After searching all databases, we exported data in Microsoft® Excel and removed
duplicates. Two reviewers (DP & AG) screened titles to remove clearly irrelevant studies. All
three reviewers (AG, DP, AKM) independently screened the abstracts and full text of
remaining articles to determine final eligibility and resolved any discrepancies through
discussion and consensus. After included studies were finalized, data on various variables
such as reprocessing method exposure variables, number, type and replicates of FFR models,
parameters which were evaluated and final results was entered in Microsoft® Excel

independently by all three reviewers. Extracted data was checked and analysed by one
reviewer (AG) and disagreements were resolved prior to final analysis.

Quality Assessment
To assess methodological quality and risk bias of studies, a self-developed tool was
designed on the basis of STROBE statement[13] due to unavailability of a validated quality
assessment tool for such studies. Two authors (AKM and DP) independently assessed the
methodological quality and risk bias as per tool. The scheme of scoring and grading of
studies is given in S3 Table along with the final quality assessment results. Inter-author
concordance on grading of studies was evaluated by third author (AG). Final quality
assessment results for included studies, as shown in S3 Table, were prepared by resolving
inter-author disagreements by discussion and building consensus.

Results
Search Results
Our search strategy identified 7887 records of which 17 original research articles fit
inclusion criteria for qualitative analysis, methodology of the same has been described in Fig
1. No records were found in OpenGrey database using search strategy.

Quality Assessment
Of 17 studies, 14 were graded as high quality and 3 as moderate quality (S3 Table).
Inter-author agreement in grading of studies was 88% (15/17). Overall agreement in quality
assessment scores was 64% (11/17).

Study Characteristics
Amongst 17 included studies, 15 were conducted in U.S.[8,14–27] and 2 in
Taiwan[28,29]. Ten out of 15 studies were conducted by research groups from NIOSH as the
principal investigator[8,14,16,17,21–26], 4 by researchers at Applied Research Associates
(ARA) in collaboration with Air Force Research Laboratory at Tyndall Air Force Base,
Panama City[18–20,27] and in 1 study, principal investigators were from University of
Nebraska (UoN)[15]. Three studies were an outcome of collaboration between NIOSH, ARA
& UoN in various combinations[14,15,18]. Two studies from Taiwan were conducted by
same researchers at Department of Occupational Safety and Health, Chung Shan Medical
University[28,29]. First study evaluating reprocessing methods for FFRs was published in
2007[22] and last study in 2018[29].

Decontamination/ Reprocessing methods
Overall, 21 different types of decontamination or reprocessing methods for N95-FFRs
were evaluated in included studies against various parameters namely physical changes, user
acceptability, respirator fit, filter efficiency, microbicidal efficacy and presence of chemical
residues post-reprocessing. Number of studies conducted for each reprocessing method, on
these parameters are given in Fig 2. Overall, these studies evaluated 9 Physical (Energetic)
reprocessing methods namely Ultraviolet (UV-C) Irradiation (UVGI)[8,14–16,19,20,23–
25,27,29], UV-A[29], UV-B[27], Moist heat delivered using Microwave generated Steam
(MGS)[14,15,20,22,23,26], Lab Incubator (MHI)[14,15,20,22,23] and Autoclave

(MHA)[22,28,29], Dry heat delivered by Microwave (MGI)[16,22], Hot Air Oven (DHO)[22]
and Traditional Electric Rice Cooker (TERC)[28,29]; 3 Gaseous chemical decontamination
methods namely Hydrogen Peroxide Gas Plasma (HPGP)[14,16,22,27], Hydrogen Peroxide
Vapor (HPV)[14] and Ethylene Oxide (EO)[14,16,22,27]; 6 Liquid chemical
decontamination methods namely Bleach[14,16,22,25–29], Hydrogen Peroxide
(LHP)[14,22], Alcohols[22,28,29], Mixed Oxidants[27], Dimethyl dioxirane[27] and Soap &
water[22]; and in one study[18], wipes of Bleach (0.9%), Benzalkonium chloride and Inert
substance for surface decontamination of N95-FFRs. Fourteen (14) studies[14–18,20–29] did
comparative evaluation of multiple methods for reprocessing of FFRs whereas in 3 studies
only 1 method was evaluated, which was UVGI in all[8,19,24]. In 12 studies[14–16,16–
23,25,27], intact respirators were exposed to the decontamination method whereas in 5, cut
pieces of facepiece portion were exposed[8,24,26,28,29]. Furthermore, in one study,8 pieces
of straps were also exposed separately to UVGI. In 4 studies, FFRs underwent multiple
cycles (3 in all studies) of decontamination for reprocessing[14,17,18,23].

Note: The summary is only indicative of the collective results of various
studies done (prior to 2020) to evaluate effect of reprocessing method on a
particular parameter. It doesn’t attempt to endorse or refute any method as the
authors strongly believe that there is insufficient data to reach any conclusion.

Respirator Models
In 10 of 17 studies, the identities of N95-FFR models used was disclosed[8,15,17,19,21,2325,28,29], details of which against the reprocessing method and parameters evaluated are
given in S4 Table. Overall, 22 different models of N95-FFRs were disclosed in 10 studies, 18
of which are approved as surgical respirators by FDA, whereas 4 are Particulate respirators.
All respirators used in these studies, irrespective of whether identities were disclosed or not,
were NIOSH approved. 3M1860 and 3M1870, both surgical respirators, were the most
commonly used N95-FFRs, being used in seven[8,15,19,21,22,23,26] and
six[15,17,19,21,23,26] studies, respectively. They were tested against three reprocessing
methods i.e. UVGI, MGS and MHI, where identity was disclosed. 3M8210, a particulate

i. Ultra-Violet Irradiation (UVGI)
Thirteen studies[8,14–16,19–25,27,29] evaluated exposure to UV-C (254 nm) as a
reprocessing method for FFRs, as shown in Fig 2. All 22 known models of N95-FFRs
were reprocessed using UV-C in at least one study (S4 Table). Furthermore, one study
each also examined the microbiological efficacy of UV-A[29] and presence of
chemical residues after using UV-B[27]. Exposure variables of UVGI on N95-FFRs
and summary of results are provided in Table 1. Different parameters evaluated
against UVGI are detailed in Fig 2. Since, UV-C has been the most commonly
evaluated method for reprocessing of N95-FFRs, it will be discussed in detail.

ii. Moist Heat
Delivering moist heat to FFRs has been evaluated in 10 studies[14,15,17,18,21–
23,26,28,29]. Modalities of exposure involved exposing FFRs to steam created in a
microwave (MGS), either by using water reservoir[14,15,20,21,23,26] or commercial
steam bags[17]; in a lab incubator with a water reservoir heated at 60-70°C
(MHI)[14,15,18,21,23] and by autoclaving at 121°C (MHA)[22,28,29]. Parameters
evaluated for these treatments are given in Fig 2 and the exposure variables and
results of individual studies are described in Table 2. Known FFR models which
underwent reprocessing by both MGS and MHI were 3M1860, 3M1870, 3M8000 and
3M8210, whereas, for MHA only known FFR model was 3M8210.
iii. Dry Heat
Dry heat for reprocessing of FFRs has been evaluated in 4 studies[16,22,29,29]
wherein microwave (MGI)[16,22,28,29], Hot Air Oven (DHO)[16,22] and Electric
Rice Cooker (TERC)[28,29] have been used. Various parameters which have been
evaluated against them are shown in Fig 2 and their exposure variables and results are
summarized in Table 2. 3M8210 was the only known N95-FFR model which
underwent reprocessing by any dry heat delivering method[28,29].

B. Gaseous Chemical Methods
Only 4 studies[14,16,22,27], prior to 2020, had evaluated a gaseous disinfection method for
reprocessing of N95-FFRs. The methods used were Ethylene Oxide (EO)[14,16,22,27],
Hydrogen peroxide in a Plasma Sterilizer (HPGP)[14,16,22,27] and Hydrogen Peroxide in
vaporized form by using a commercial automated vapor generator[22]. Parameters against
which they were evaluated; and their exposure variables and findings of the studies are
provided in Fig 2 and Table 3, respectively. FFR models were not disclosed in any of the
studies.

C. Liquid Chemical Methods
Six different liquid decontamination methods have been evaluated on N95-FFRs in 8
studies[14,16,22,25–29]. These are Bleach[14,16,22,25–29], Liquid Hydrogen Peroxide
(LHP)[14,22,27], Alcohols[22,28,29] including Ethanol and Isopropyl Alcohol, Mixed
oxidants[27], Dimethyl Dioxirane[27] and Soap solution[22]. Parameters against which they
were evaluated, their exposure variables and results of the studies are provided in Fig 2 and
Table 4, respectively. Against Bleach, only known N95-FFR models evaluated were 3M8210
and Wilson SAF-T-FIT Plus (S4 Table). 3M8210 was the only known N95-FFR which was
evaluated for Alcohols[28.29].

D. Miscellaneous Methods
In one study[18], commercial wipes of 0.9% Sodium Hypochlorite, Benzalkonium Chloride
and an Inert material were evaluated for changes in filter efficiency and microbicidal efficacy
by applying them on surface of N95-FFRs, as shown in Fig 2 & Table 4.

Discussion
A pandemic of Influenza virus was always on the horizon and in 2009, it became reality.
Researchers at NIOSH have been looking actively for finding a suitable method for their
reprocessing since 2006 after the report of IOM Committee[11,22]. During 2007-2012, 12
studies evaluated reprocessing method for FFRs, most of them were conducted by or in
collaboration with NIOSH[14-17,20-27]. In contrast, between 2013-2019, only 5 published
studies had evaluated a reprocessing technique for N95-FFRs[19,20,28,29], with last study
published by NIOSH in 2015[8]. Ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has brutally exposed the
stalled progress in research to address this issue.

It has been shown that the surface stability of SARS-COV-2 on various surfaces lasts up to 3
days but this study didn’t include porous surfaces like that of respirators[37]. However, a
study recently, showed it to be present on outer layer of surgical masks on day 7[38]. This
recent data makes it imperative to decontaminate FFRs in between use as the risk of contact
transmission without decontamination is considerable. Previously, CDC also discouraged
reusing N95-FFRs whenever risk of contact transmission of a pathogen was high[6].
Furthermore, it is in larger global interest to find a suitable reprocessing method for N95FFRs as they are not used frequently by HCWs in low to middle income countries (LMICs)
while tackling pathogens against whom their use is mandatory such as Mycobacterium
tuberculosis, as they are not available due to cost[39,40]. Finding a reprocessing method for
FFRs will led to provision of adequate respiratory protection for HCWs in such resource
limited settings.

A typical N95-FFR consists of facepiece covering mouth and nose, outer margin of which is
lined to provide a face seal to the wearer. Two straps are attached to facepiece for fitting

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.01.20179879; this version posted September 3, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

snugly at the back of head, a pliable metallic nose piece to facilitate bending at the nasal
bridge and a foam cushion beneath it for the comfort of the wearer[41]. The function of an
N95-FFR is to provide wearer an air supply free of particulates, including bioaerosols. This is
facilitated by the main filtering layer of the respirator, also termed as Electret media, which is
made up of non-woven, electrostatically charged polypropylene fibers which can capture the
particulates in the incoming air[14]. However, the wearer must ensure that inhaled air should
reach him through the facepiece and not through sides of the respirator. To ensure this, a
wearer should undergo fit testing annually to determine the best respirator design and size for
their facial features. Additionally, at the time of donning, wearer must ensure a user face-seal
check to determine any air leak from the sides of respirator[41].

N95-FFRs are difficult to decontaminate owing to the porous nature of the main body and
electrostatically charged nature of electret media. Any reprocessing or decontamination
method, despite being microbiologically efficacious, shall be able to preserve the functioning
of electret media, not physically affect various structural components compromising
respirator fit and face-seal. Furthermore, due to proximity of N95-FFR to face, it should be
devoid of harmful chemical residues, as they can be inhaled. Additional considerations for
selecting a reprocessing method for reusing N95-FFRs for a healthcare facility are existing
infrastructure, cost, turnaround time and throughput of the method[41]. Till date, whatever
meagre research has been done, it has failed to find a reprocessing method which ticks all the
boxes.

Physical (Energetic) methods such as application of moist heat, dry heat and irradiation have
traditionally been the most commonly used methods for reprocessing healthcare items.
Amongst them, Irradiation by UV-C (254 nm) rays (UVGI) has been the most frequently

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.01.20179879; this version posted September 3, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

evaluated reprocessing methods for N95-FFRs, as shown in Fig 2 and Table 3. In all these
studies, UVGI has shown to cause no damage to the physical appearance of FFRs, acceptable
to users in terms of odor, donning ease and wear comfort, maintain respirator fit, preserve
filter efficiency even after undergoing multiple cycles of decontamination and devoid of any
toxic residues post-exposure.

Dose of irradiation is the most important variable for determining microbicidal efficacy of
UVGI, which, in turn, is determined by irradiance at the surface of FFR and duration of
exposure[19]. Total doses around 1-2 J/cm2 have shown to provide ≥4 log10 reduction of
viruses inoculated on FFRs and around 5-6 J/cm2 against bacterial spores. Overall, UVGI has
shown to be a suitable choice for reprocessing of FFRs, however, it is limited by varying
exposure variables of UV dose used in multiple studies, as shown in Table 1. Furthermore, a
study Fisher et al[24] concluded that the UV-C dose required for microbicidal efficacy is a
function of the dose available to the electret medium, which in turn, is dependent on the
penetrance (transmittance) of the layer above it. Hence, effective doses of UV-C for
microbicidal efficacy will be model specific and needs to be established accordingly. We
conclude that UVGI has great potential to be utilized as an effective decontamination method
for N95-FFRs during this time of crisis however, more studies are needed to validate the
various variables associated with the delivery of the UVGI method and respirator model
specific doses will need to be established before it can be recommended.

Moist heat has been delivered in the form of steam generated in a microwave (MGS),
benchtop lab incubator (MHI) at 60-70°C and in traditional Autoclave (MHA). Of them,
MHA has shown to physically destroy FFRs and is deemed unsuitable for the purpose[22]. In
MHI, exposure time has varied from 15-30 min and in MGS N95-FFRs are exposed for 90-

120s. Multiple studies evaluating physical changes by both methods noticed partial separation
of inner foam nose cushion. However, this was noticed for a particular FFR model (3M1870),
where model identity was disclosed, but effect was not pronounced after undergoing multiple
cycles of decontamination[14,23]. Both methods are shown to have no significant effect on
user acceptability, respirator fit and filter efficiency till 3 cycles of
decontamination[14,15,21,23]. More than 4 log10 reduction of enveloped viruses was
demonstrated on N95-FFRs undergoing decontamination by MGS and MHI
methods[15,17,20,26]. We are of opinion that these methods are low cost, easily doable in
any setting, but require more validation in terms of other respirator models and cycles of
decontamination, in future studies. MGS method is particularly suitable for implementation
by individuals at home and smaller healthcare settings. Sparking due to placing metallic
components in microwave has been a concern but it has not been noticed in MGS
method[14].

Dry heat has been evaluated as a reprocessing method for FFRs in 4 studies[16,22,28,29] In
two studies using DHO, FFRs were able to physically withstand temperatures till 80°C
without affecting durability and filter efficiency[16,22] Electric rice cooker delivering
temperature of 149-164°C has been used in studies from Taiwan[28,29] and one study from
there found that exposure of an FFR model for 3 minutes was able to provide 99-100%
biocidal efficacy against Bacillus subtilis spores[29]. In a study where microwave oven was
used to deliver dry heat for 2 min, 2 of 9 respirator models were destroyed but in 7 models
which withstood the treatment, filter efficiency was unchanged[16]. We opine that the
literature is insufficient to either recommend or refute dry heat as a method of reprocessing
for FFRs.

Exposure to Ethylene oxide (EO) and Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) have been evaluated as a
decontamination method for N95-FFRs simultaneously in 4 studies[14,16,22,27]. They are
ideally suited for temperature sensitive articles hence, their use for reprocessing N95-FFRs is
particularly promising. In these studies, FFRs have been exposed to EO and H2O2 (HPGP) in
their respective sterilizers for standard cycling conditions. In addition, a study by Viscusi et
al[22], vaporized H2O2 (HPV) generated in a commercial, automated vapor generator
(BIOQUELL) was used for reprocessing of FFRs. Detailed cycling conditions of individual
studies are given in Table 3. FFR models were not disclosed in any of the studies. After EO
sterilization, FFRs didn’t showed any physical changes[14,16,22], or had offensive
odor[14,16], and filter efficiency was also not degraded significantly[14,16,22] even after
undergoing 3 cycles[14]. However, a study which focused on evaluating chemical residues
post-exposure, found a possible carcinogen and mutagen, 2-hydroxyethyl acetate (HEA) on
FFRs which had undergone EO sterilization[27]. No study yet has evaluated microbicidal
efficacy of EO sterilization on FFRs though it is expected that this method will achieve
adequate microbicidal efficacy. Overall, we opine that though EO has performed suitably in
maintaining the physical architecture and filtration efficiency, increasing its safety profile by
increasing aeration duration should be the topic of further research studies. Hence, it cannot
be recommended at this point of time for reprocessing of N95-FFRs due to safety concerns.

Hydrogen peroxide provides microbicidal activity by way of generating free radicals and its
degradation products are safe. In 3 studies, where HPGP was evaluated, no significant
physical changes on the FFRs were noted[14,16,22]. Filter efficiency of 25% (9/36)
respirators was noted to be degraded in one[14] of three[14,16,22] studies which evaluated.
However, this effect was not noted when FFRs were treated with vaporized form[22,42]. In a
commercial evaluation done for FDA by Batelle Institute on Clarus C HPV generator in

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.01.20179879; this version posted September 3, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

2016, no filter degradation was noted on 3M1870 even after undergoing 50 cycles of
decontamination[42]. This system has been granted emergency use authorization (EUA) by
FDA, after COVID-19 pandemic, for reprocessing N95-FFRs[43]. Concerns have been raised
regarding throughput of HPGP as in a study authors noticed cycles were aborted in
STERRAD® Sterilizer whenever >6 FFRs were placed[27]. This could be due to presence of
cellulose in the straps of the respirators leading to absorption of H2O2[27]. No independent
study prior to 2020 has evaluated microbicidal efficacy of H2O2 on FFRs though Batelle
report showed 6 log reduction of Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores after undergoing
reprocessing by HPV[42]. Overall, Hydrogen peroxide in gaseous form is a suitable option
for reprocessing of N95-FFRs which needs to be evaluated rigorously for other parameters
such as respirator fit and against other N95-FFRs. However, its availability is restricted to
limited settings.

Submersion of FFRs in liquid disinfectants is a simple method of decontaminating them.
Various liquid disinfectants which have been evaluated for this purpose namely liquid
Hydrogen peroxide (LHP), household bleach and Alcohols. Hydrogen peroxide in 3% and
6% concentrations has been evaluated for decontamination of FFRs in 3 studies[14,22,27], of
which two evaluated for physical changes and filter efficiency[14,22] whereas 1 study
assessed for presence of toxic residues post-exposure[27]. Overall results were LHP oxidized
staples of FFRs at 6% but not at 3% strength, filter efficiency of FFRs was maintained at both
concentrations and they were devoid of toxic chemical residues after processing.
Microbiological efficacy has not been studied yet in any study.

Bleach has been most frequently evaluated liquid disinfectant for reprocessing of FFRs.
Overall bleach has been evaluated in 9 studies of which 1 used disinfectant wipes[18].

Exposure to bleach caused physical changes in the FFRs in terms of being stiff, mottled and
tarnishing of metallic nosepieces[14,16,18,22]. Offensive odor from FFRs was noticed in
most studies[14,16,27]. Furthermore, chlorine release has been noted when respirators were
exposed to moisture, raising concerns regarding the safety of this method if a person breathes
through it[16,27]. Though it has been found to have no significant degradation in the filter
quality of the FFRs[14,16,18,22] and have excellent microbicidal efficacy[18,25,26,29],
bleach is not safe to decontaminate FFRs. Alcohols (Ethanol and Isopropyl alcohol) have also
been evaluated in 3 studies, but they are known to significantly degrade the filter efficiency
due to removal of electrostatic charges from the electret media[22,28,29]. Hence, they don’t
hold further merit in this discussion. Similar findings have been noted in one study which
used soap & water for decontamination of FFRs[22].

A summary assessment of the body of literature on reprocessing of N95-FFRs has been
provided in Fig 2. However, the findings of this systematic review and opinion of the authors
should be assessed in light of limited literature available on this topic. Furthermore, readers
should also consider the variability in exposure variables and methodological variabilities in
the evaluated parameters within and between reprocessing methods. For example, to evaluate
microbicidal efficacy, studies have used different micro-organisms and growth parameters
accordingly while few included additional soiling challenges to mimic micro-organisms in
human secretions. Few parameters have been evaluated only in few studies such as odor,
wear comfort, and donning ease were evaluated objectively only in 1 study[21], respirator fit
in 2 studies[21,23] and chemical safety in 1 study[27]. Hence, changes in these parameters
which are not studied much, nevertheless are important, should be the focus of future studies.
Furthermore, we didn’t do a meta-analysis as the studies were heterogeneous in terms of
exposure variables and the number of studies conducted were less for a particular

reprocessing method: parameter combination. As we write this review, a large body of
literature on reprocessing of N95-FFRs has been already published till 30th June 2020[44–
58]. but when we did literature search, only few studies were published[44,45,49,58] and
majority were in preprint, non-peer reviewed versions.

This systematic review is done to assess published literature, prior to COVID-19 pandemic,
on reprocessing methods used to decontaminate N95-FFRs. This review may help
administrators, infectious disease specialists and infection control personnel to formulate
policies for effective utilization of single use, N95-FFRs to prevent respiratory transmission
of SARS-COV-2. It will help researchers to find existing knowledge gaps in respirator
reprocessing techniques and help them to design future studies. Furthermore, manufacturers
may find it useful by knowing existing limitations and work their way around by developing
new respirator material or design, more amenable to commonly available reprocessing
techniques.

Conclusions
To summarize, reusing N95-FFRs is need of the hour due to COVID-19 pandemic.
Scientific progress was stalled after initial thrust provided by novel Influenza virus pandemic
otherwise, current shortage of N95-FFRs for respiratory protection of HCWs would not have
been of this humongous proportions. Consequently, HCWs have been forced to adopt
measures which have little scientific support. Published literature is scant, but continuously
updating on a daily basis, on studies evaluating reprocessing methods for N95-FFR. Besides
microbiological efficacy, other factors such as physical changes, user acceptability of
reprocessed FFRs, respirator fit, filter efficiency and chemical safety profile are of major

consideration while selecting a reprocessing method for FFRs. Physical methods of
decontamination are the most commonly evaluated methods for reprocessing of FFRs in the
present scientific literature. However, except for UVGI, majority cause physical changes in
the respirators in varying degrees. UVGI has varied widely in terms of dose of radiation
delivered to FFRs and needs to be validated in more studies. Dose of UV-C irradiation which
achieves satisfactory microbicidal efficacy needs to be determined specifically for each FFR
model.

Use of low temperature sterilizing methods for reprocessing of N95-FFRs is promising.
However, EO is not safe to use for reprocessing N95-FFRs whereas HPGP has been
evaluated in very few studies yet and one study raised concerns about its effect on filter
efficiency. Though emergency use approvals have been given to Hydrogen Peroxide
STERRAD® Gas Plasma Sterilizer and BIOQUELL® Clarus C HPV generator, their
presence is extremely limited worldwide, particularly in LMICs. Finding a suitable
reprocessing method for N95-FFRs is also important from the perspective of infection control
in LMICs. At present, promising technologies which need to be evaluated rigorously include
UVGI and HPV. Other techniques such as MGS and MHI have shown to be efficacious
against enveloped viruses and not compromise the filter efficiency up to 3 cycles of
decontamination. Of them, MGS has an extremely short cycling duration and should be
considered for emergency implementation in resource limited settings.
