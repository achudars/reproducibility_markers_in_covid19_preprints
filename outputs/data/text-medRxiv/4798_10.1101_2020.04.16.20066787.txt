ABSTRACT

43

Background: A false-negative case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-

44

2) infection is defined as a person with suspected infection and an initial negative result by reverse

45

transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, with a positive result on a subsequent test.

46

False-negative cases have important implications for isolation and risk of transmission of infected

47

people and for the management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We aimed to review and

48

critically appraise evidence about the rate of RT-PCR false-negatives at initial testing for COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION

75

On December 31, 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) was alerted about a cluster of

76

patients with pneumonia in Wuhan City, Hubei province, China (1). Chinese authorities confirmed,

77

a week later, an outbreak of a novel coronavirus. The virus has been named as severe acute

78

respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (SARS-CoV-2) (2), and the clinical disease that it causes is

79

coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has become a worldwide public health emergency

80

and reached pandemic status (3). By the time of this article's writing, the virus has spread to 215

81

countries and territories and has caused over 283,271 deaths worldwide (4).

82

Clinical suspicion of COVID-19 is based primarily on respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough,

83

and shortness of breath as primary manifestations (5, 6). The spectrum of symptoms and clinical

84

Although most of the cases present mild symptoms, some cases have developed pneumonia,

through surfaces that have been contaminated with these droplets (10). Recent evidence has

suggested the presence of asymptomatic cases in several different settings showing, that the

90

proportion could be up to 29% (11). Furthermore, recent studies have shown the presence of

91

asymptomatic cases in cluster families,

93

Because the signs of infection mentioned above are non-specific, confirmation of cases is currently

94

based on the detection of nucleic acid amplification tests that detect viral ribonucleic acid (RNA)

95

sequences by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Different RT-PCR assays

96

have been proposed, all of which include the N gene that codes for the viral nucleocapsid. Other

97

alternative targets are the E gene, for the viral envelope; the S gene for the spike protein; and the

presence of symptoms closely related to COVID-19, as numerous clinical practice guidelines and

103

consensus statements recommend (18-22). Cases with negative RT-PCR results at initial testing

104

and found to be positive in a subsequent test are commonly considered cases with an initial false-

105

negative diagnosis. Some researchers have suggested that these failures in SARS-CoV-2 detection

106

are related to multiple preanalytical and analytical factors, such as lack of standardisation for

107

specimen collection, delays or poor storage conditions before arrival in the laboratory, the use of

108

inadequately validated assays, contamination during the procedure, insufficient viral specimens

and

115

COVID-19 pandemic, and the potential consequences at several levels of missing a COVID-19 case,

116

we aimed to obtain through a systematic review of the literature, a summary estimate of the

197

We planned to investigate the potential sources of heterogeneity using a descriptive approach and

227

included confirmed cases of COVID-19 at the beginning of the study (34, 35, 41, 42, 44, 47-49, 51-

55, 57-63, 65, 66). One study focused its data collection only on children (52) and other only on

symptoms at the time of testing (from two to nine patients), but they did not provide subgroup

231

information of these cases (47, 52, 57).

232

Included studies collected information from January 1 (57) to April 15, 2020 (40, 47); two studies

233

did not provide complete information about the time of recruitment (34, 44). Ten studies were

237

ranged from 2.5 (52) to 56 years (57), while for studies reporting medians, the corresponding

238

range was 45 (43) to 63 years (53). These 21 studies reported a total of 5331 men and 4067

239

women (Table 1).

240

In all cases, the presence of infection was confirmed after detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in any

241

real-time RT-PCR assay that was repeated after a negative result. The specimens collected for the

242

RT-PCR assessment were heterogeneous in most of the included studies; in 13 studies the authors

reported the use of nasopharyngeal swabs (34-37, 44-46, 48, 51, 53, 57, 60, 65), along with

255

Quality of included studies

256

We applied the QUADAS-2 tool to all included studies to reflect critical limitations in the validity of

257

the findings (Figure 2). In addition, given that to some of the studies were cohorts/case series, we

258

also applied the JBI tool for case series to all included studies for a comprehensive assessment of

259

their limitations (S4 Appendix).

260

According to the QUADAS-2 tool, the domain most affected by a high risk of bias was the flow and

261

timing domain, as some studies had not repeated the RT-PCR testing to all patients with negative

262

results at initial testing (36, 44, 45, 51, 53, 54); besides, some studies did not provide information

263

about the interval of time for the administration of a new RT-PCR assay. Regarding the patient

264

selection domain, the risk of bias and applicability concerns were judged as high or unclear for

265

several studies selecting patients assessed by RT-PCR plus Chest CT findings or serology tests. In

266

most of the studies was unclear whether the administration of these tests was the standard

267

protocol of management, or if the authors only enrolled patients undergoing all tests (33-35, 37-

268

40, 46, 47, 50, 52, 56, 57, 59, 63, 66).

269

In regards to the index test domain, details about the criteria for positive results, such as the

270

target

271

provided by several studies. Their risk of bias and applicability were judged as unclear in both

272

cases (33, 35-44, 46, 47, 49, 50, 52, 53, 56, 59, 63, 65, 66). Finally, two studies were judged as

273

unclear

274

characteristics

275

considered as at low risk of bias in all QUADAS-II domains assessed (48, 55, 58, 60, 61, 64), while

276

20 were considered as at unclear risk due to at least one domain was judged with unclear risk of

277

bias. The remaining eight studies were considered at high risk of bias (at least one domain judged

278

with high risk) (36, 37, 45, 50, 51, 53, 54, 62).

279

The analysis of limitations carried out with the adapted JBI case-series tool provided a similar

280

assessment of the quality of included studies due to the uncertainty regarding the consecutive

281

inclusion of patients and follow-up time after the first RT-PCR result. Additionally, due to the

282

selection of patients, the majority of included studies were not an adequate sample of the target

283

population (S4 Appendix).

284

285

Findings

286

We analysed information from 34 studies collecting information from 12,057 patients confirmed

287

to

288

assessment. False-negative rates ranged from 0.018 (44) to 0.58 (56) (Figure 2).

289

The summary estimate of the false-negative rate was 0.13 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.19). The data were

290

characterised

291

prediction interval ranged from 0.02 to 0.54.

292

Assessment of the effect of potential sources of heterogeneity was limited due to the lack of

293

separate information of relevant subgroups (Table 2). There were no differences related to the

294

duration of symptoms at the time of the first RT-PCR test based on information derived from nine

295

studies provided means and medians of symptoms onset (Table 2). Comparison of false-negative

296

rates of studies using different RT-PCR kits targetting (nucleocapside N-gene and/or ORF1ab gene)

297

makes no significant differences (Table 2). In addition, most of the studies (28 out of 34) reported

310

311

312

Tau-square =0.60), although the heterogeneity remains similar to those reported for the total

313

group (Table 2).

314

Since we are not able to warrant that the summary estimate provided by the meta-analysis is a

315

valid representation of the false-negative rate that can be expected in current practice, because of

316

the very large heterogeneity, we instead used the estimated prediction interval in the analysis of

Certainty of the evidence

328

We used the estimated prediction interval of the main meta-analysis to develop a summary of

329

findings following the GRADE approach. We illustrated the consequences of the range of false-

330

negative rates in a population of 100 tested, according to three different prevalence estimates

331

seen in the current clinical practice for participant stakeholders and similar to those estimated by

332

the included studies (10%, 30%, and 50%) (Figure 3). Using a prevalence of 50%, we found that 1

DISCUSSION

346

Our systematic review identified 34 studies and 12,507 participants providing information about

347

the proportion of false-negative (FN) cases in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR assays at first

348

use.

349

studies were affected by several sources of potential bias, especially related to the administration

350

of an additional RT-PCR to rule in/rule out the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the analysis of a

351

selected

352

characteristics.

353

The meta-analysis of the FN rates showed a considerable variability of data not explained by any of

354

the

355

interpretation of the mean proportion of the FN results as a summary estimate. Kucirka et al. also

356

detected similar uncertainties in their Bayesian modelling of false-negative rates of RT-PCR by time

357

since exposure, based on information from seven studies and 1330 respiratory samples (68). As an

358

alternative, we chose to illustrate the impact of this heterogeneity by showing the number of

359

false-negative cases expected in a cohort of 100 patients tested under three different prevalence

360

these numerical

364

365

Our systematic review faced other challenges in its development. First, our study was initially

366

planned

367

beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the permanent involvement of clinicians managing

368

COVID-19 patients at this point, we were able to define a review question that responds to a

369

clinical inquiry relevant to current clinical practice (69-71). However, due to the increasing number

370

of publications potentially eligible to answer the review question, our approach evolved into a

371

living-systematic review with regular updates of the evidence. This manuscript reflects the third

372

update

373

transparency in the development of this review, we have uploaded our previous results in the

374

Open Science Framework repository for public consultation (https://osf.io/jserd/). We plan to

375

perform additional searches after the publication of this manuscript to keep the conclusions as

376

update as possible.

377

A second challenge is related to the type of studies providing information about the false-negative

378

rate associated with RT-PCR at initial testing. We expected to find studies specifically aimed to

379

estimate the number of initial negative results of RT-PCR assays, with further confirmation of

380

SARS-CoV-2 infection with an additional RT-PCR within the following days to the first result. On the

381

contrary, we found that the reporting of false-negative rate was not the primary aim of any of the

382

include studies. In some cases, these figures were reported as descriptive statistics of the collected

383

sample. Although we carried out a comprehensive and sensitive search strategy including major

384

databases and repositories of preprint publications, we cannot discard that some eligible studies

385

have not been identified yet due to the limitation of the reporting in key study sections, such as

386

the abstract and methods.

387

Finally, as we have remarked in the findings section of this review, we found a considerable

388

heterogeneity of data not explained by the statistical analysis performed. Suggested sources of

389

heterogeneity such as the type of specimen collected, the time to onset of symptoms (as an

390

approach

391

characteristics as their analytical properties), were insufficiently reported or not reported at all for

392

collected studies. This variability on COVID-19 testing data and the challenge to provide a pooled

393

estimation with a useful clinical meaning have been previously remarked as the main constraint in

394

the development of systematic reviews on this field (72). Despite our efforts in the analysis of

395

data,

396

performed in China versus those carried out in other countries (i.e. USA, Singapore, and the

397

Netherlands). We believe that information provided by Chinese studies reflects early experiences

398

with the diagnosis of COVID-19; their findings are probably affected by several unreported issues,

399

such as the RT-PCR kits in use (likely the first kits developed for SARS-CoV-2 detection), the lack of

400

standardised methods for COVID-19 testing and, in general, the limited knowledge about this new

Despite the heterogeneous information answering the review question, our study carried out a

rigorous assessment of potential sources of bias, a formal statistical analysis of results and a final

405

evaluation of the certainty of the evidence under a well-known system (GRADE). Although not all

406

studies included in this review were accuracy studies, we decided to apply the QUADAS-II tool

407

regardless of the type of design. However, even though QUADAS-II was not developed to evaluate

408
