Abstract

Rapid and sensitive diagnostics of infectious diseases is an urgent and unmet need as evidenced
by the COVID-19 pandemic. Here we report a novel strategy, based on DIgitAl plasMONic
nanobubble Detection (DIAMOND), to address these gaps. Plasmonic nanobubbles are transient
vapor bubbles generated by laser heating of plasmonic nanoparticles and allow single-particle
detection. Using gold nanoparticles labels and an optofluidic setup, we demonstrate that
DIAMOND achieves a compartment-free digital counting and works on homogeneous assays
without separation and amplification steps. When applied to the respiratory syncytial virus
diagnostics, DIAMOND is 150 times more sensitive than commercial lateral flow assays and
completes measurements within 2 minutes. Our method opens new possibilities to develop
single-particle digital detection methods and facilitate rapid and ultrasensitive diagnostics.
One Sentence Summary: Single-particle digital plasmonic nanobubble detection allows rapid
and ultrasensitive detection of viruses in a one-step homogeneous assay.

The ability to rapidly detect diseases with high precision is of paramount importance as
evidenced by the current COVID-19 pandemic (1, 2). Digital assays have been a remarkable
conceptual advance over the past two decades due to their single-molecule detection and
absolute quantification (3, 4). They partition the analytes into microwells or emulsion droplets as
small compartments for independent signal amplification and digital counting, leading to the
sensitivity enhancement by up to 103-fold over the conventional assays (i.e., enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay and polymerase chain reaction) (3, 4). Despite those advantages, digital
assays have suffered from complex assay operations. Such paradigms prompt further innovations
that develop various digital sensing platforms based on micro/nano-particles (5-7). With its
capability of examining individual particles’ changes upon recognizing target molecules, singleparticle detection holds great potential to simplify digital assays (8-10). Examples of singleparticle digital assays include bright/dark-field imaging (11), interferometric (12) or fluorescent
imaging (13, 14), surface-enhanced Raman scattering (15), surface plasmon resonance
microscopy imaging (16), and particle mobility tracking (17-19). However, current techniques
rely on cumbersome particle purification and advanced imaging that inevitably limit their
widespread use.
Herein, we report a novel strategy for simplified single-particle digital assay based on DIgitAl
plasMONic nanobubble Detection (DIAMOND, see Table S1 for comparison with other assays).
Plasmonic nanobubbles (PNBs) refer to the vapor bubbles generated by short laser pulse
excitation of plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) and amplify their intrinsic scattering for the
detection by a secondary probe laser (20-24). They have lifetime that lasts nanoseconds and are
sensitive to the physical parameters of NPs such as sizes, shape, concentration, and clustering
state (20-22). Taking advantage of these unique properties, we designed an optofluidic setup to
flow the NP suspension in a micro-capillary (Fig. 1A and Fig. S1). The focused laser beam
probes a microscale “virtual compartment” of about 16 pL and detects the PNB generation from
single particles. Since PNBs are transient events, there is no cross-talk between laser pulses,
which allows “on” and “off” signal counting in a compartment-free manner (Fig. 1B). We
demonstrated robust single NP counting and sensitive detection of large particles in a strong
background of small particles (1 in 240). We then implemented DIAMOND in a homogeneous
assay that uses plasmonic gold NPs (AuNPs) as labels without additional separation or
amplification steps. Using silica (SiO2) beads as targets, we demonstrated that DIAMOND has
sub-femtomolar detection limit and provides absolute quantification. When applied to detect
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), DIAMOND provided a 150-fold sensitivity enhancement over
the state-of-the-art lateral flow assay (LFA) and sample-to-answer time within 2 minutes.
Therefore, DIAMOND opens new possibilities to develop separation-, amplification-, and
compartment-free single-particle digital assays and facilitate rapid and ultrasensitive diagnostic
platforms.

We first evaluated the ability of DIAMOND for single NP detection. Serial aqueous dilutions
of 75 nm AuNP (as characterized in Fig. S2, 3 and Table S2) were prepared for the DIAMOND
tests. For simplicity, we converted the particle concentration into the expected average number
(λ) of AuNPs per detection zone. Fig. 2A and Fig. S4 show the representative testing results and
the corresponding Poisson distributions for the given λ, respectively. Due to the variation of
actual AuNP number (k) per detection zone, it led to discrete PNB signals with fluctuated

intensity. In the case of λ=0.04, the positive PNB signals could be satisfactorily discriminated
from the baseline (Fig. 2A). According to the Poisson statistics, each of signal drop refers to a
single AuNP being detected (Fig. S4D), confirming the capability of DIAMOND in single-NP
detection. To correlate the PNB signals with AuNP concentration, we calculated the frequencies
(f) of positive PNB signals in each trace as “on” signals and plotted the fon as a function of λ
(Fig. 2B). A high correlation coefficient (R2=0.998) indicates the AuNP quantification by
counting the frequency of “on” signal. Furthermore, we found a linear relationship (slope=1.012,
R2=0.999, Fig. 2C) between the theoretical probability (P) predicted by Poisson statistics and the
experimental fon, suggesting that DIAMOND is a calibration-free technique and allows absolute
quantification.
Next, we used DIAMOND to detect AuNPs of different sizes under the same concentration.
AuNP suspensions of 15 nm, 35 nm, 50 nm, and 75 nm (Fig. S2, 3 and Table S2) were prepared
for the test. Fig. 2D shows the representative PNB signal traces. Due to the large number of
AuNPs per detection zone (λ=240), consistent PNB signals were observed in each laser pulse.
Fig. 2E shows representative PNB signals taken from each case and suggests that larger NP size
leads to larger PNB signals. To quantify this relationship, we extracted the values of amplitude
and area-under-the-curve (AUC) from each PNB signal (Fig. S5) and plotted their distribution
profiles as a function of AuNP sizes (Fig. 2F). They could be fitted with 1.98- and 3.51-order
dependences to the NPs’ size, respectively. This seems to agree with the fact that the PNB
generation is related to the amount of heat generation and absorption cross-section of AuNPs
(25, 26). The good fitting indicates the accurate size determination by measuring the amplitude
and AUC of PNB signals.

40

We then evaluated the ability of DIAMOND for heterogeneity identification in a population
of NPs. 15 nm and 75 nm AuNP suspensions and their mixture were tested. Fig. 3A shows the
representative PNB signal traces taken from those samples. The large intensity variation of PNB
signals observed in the mixture sample is due to the addition of 75 nm AuNPs. To sort those
specific signals resulting from 75 nm AuNPs as heterogeneities, we developed a three-step
analysis protocol. Firstly, we extracted the amplitude and AUC values of each PNB signal as
indexes for quantification. Fig. 3B shows the corresponding results in bivariate, where each
scatter represents a single PNB signal. Secondly, we fitted normal distributions to the amplitude
and AUC of 15 nm AuNPs as a reference and calculated the threshold (T) as 5 standard
deviations (σ) above the mean (μ). As such, the two thresholds covered over 99.9% of the
scatters (Fig. 3B, case i). Lastly, assigning the thresholds to the mixture sample allows data
sorting, where the scatters above the thresholds refer to the positive or “on” PNB signals
resulting from co-existence of 15 nm and 75 nm AuNPs and vice versa (Fig. 3B, case ii). For a
direct comparison, we calculated the frequencies of “on” signals (fon) from 75 nm AuNPs alone
(Fig. 3B, case iii) and benchmarked them with the Poisson probability. The agreement between
experimental result and theoretical prediction (Fig. 3C) indicates that our method provides
accurate and absolute quantification of large NPs from a strong background of small ones (i.e., 1
in 240). Clearly, DIAMOND is able to detect heterogeneity without additional separation step.

45

We further evaluated the feasibility of implementing DIAMOND for the homogeneous assay.
Homogeneous assays are simple and one-step sensing methods that require minimal sample
handling and are therefore promising for rapid detection (28). To validate our hypothesis in a
model system, we used the AuNPs as probes to detect SiO2 beads (Fig. 4A). Fig. 4B shows the
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the as-prepared product, where a core-

satellites structure was formed with AuNPs fully covering the surface of SiO2 beads. Fig. 4C
shows representative PNB signal traces and Fig. 4D shows the bivariate plot taken from serial
assay solutions. Similarly, the thresholds (T=μ+5σ) of amplitude and AUC were calculated
from the control group (highlighted in dashed lines) and assigned for “on” signal counting. The
fon were then plotted as a function of λ for SiO2 beads (Fig. 4E). A linear relationship (R2=0.99)
in the range of 0.0016-0.16 was observed and the limit of detection (LOD) was calculated to be
0.0028, equivalent to 1.75×105 mL-1 or 290 aM (inset of Fig. 4E). Such a detection limit is ~570fold lower than the colorimetric detection (Fig. S6). Furthermore, DIAMOND allows absolute
quantification for homogeneous assays, as indicated by the linear correlation (slope=0.995,
R2=0.99) between the background-subtracted frequency (fon’) and the Poisson probability (Fig.
4F).
Finally, we applied DIAMOND for the rapid detection of RSV. RSV is the major respiratory
pathogen that accounts for up to 74,500 deaths in 2015 globally in children below age 5 (28). We
chose Synagis (Palivizumab) as the detection antibody and conjugated it on the AuNPs through
3,3'-dithiobis (sulfosuccinimidyl propionate, DTSSP) as a crosslinker (Fig. S7). The as-prepared
probes could specifically target the fusion proteins on the RSV surface at the room temperature
and were ready for detection (Fig. 5A). Fig. 5B shows TEM images of AuNP-based probes
associated with RSV particles, indicating effective probe binding with the target. Fig. S8 and
Fig. 5C show the colorimetric detection of RSV (LOD: 3.6×104 PFU/mL) and reveal the good
detection specificity of AuNP probes towards RSV, among different respiratory viruses
including Parainfluenza viruses (PIV), Influenza A (IVA), Human metapneumovirus (hMPV).
For a direct comparison, we benchmarked the homogeneous immunoassay against the
commercially available LFA kit for RSV, which has an LOD of 1.6×104 PFU/mL (Fig. S9,
BinaxNOW, Abbott). We then carried out DIAMOND for RSV detection. Following the same
protocol as discussed above, we set the thresholds based on the control group (Fig. 5D) and
assigned them for fon counting (Fig. 5E). In particular, a linear relationship (R2=0.995) in the
range of 102-104 PFU/mL was observed and the LOD was calculated to be 108 PFU/mL (inset of
Fig. 5E). Evidently, DIAMOND achieved a sensitivity enhancement of ~333-fold over the
colorimetric result of homogeneous immunoassay and ~150-fold over the commercial LFA.
To demonstrate the potential clinical use, we applied DIAMOND to quantify RSV in the
transporting medium used to collect nasal swab samples. RSV at concentrations of 500-4,500
PFU/mL (as measured by end-point titration in viral culture) was spiked in the medium for
testing. As summarized in Table 1, the recovery rate for DIAMOND in examining the five RSVspiked samples was calculated to be 94.4-119%. The coefficient of variation (CV, n=6) increased
from ~6% to ~20% with decreasing RSV concentration, as expected when approaching the
LOD. These data demonstrated that the DIAMOND-coupled homogeneous immunoassay allows
sensitive analysis of viral samples in complex matrices (i.e., transporting medium) and supports
the potential applications in clinics.
Discussion

Since the PNB generation is dependent on the laser fluence, we can perform the DIAMOND
test in two modes by modulating the laser fluence above and below PNB generation threshold,
referred to as above- and below-threshold modes. Specifically, the threshold of laser fluence (E)
was defined as the 50% probability of PNB generation (PPNB) as determined from the logistic
regression (Fig. S10) (20). In principle, the below-threshold mode uses low laser fluence at
PPNB=0% (red arrow), resulting in the generation of PNB signals from only the larger NPs or

clusters instead of the small NPs or monomers. Alternatively, the above-threshold mode utilizes
high laser fluence at PPNB=100% (blue arrow) to activate all NPs for PNB generation. Despite
the background-free signal counting, the below-threshold mode requires an additional step for
the laser fluence calibration in order to avoid the incidents where the laser fluence is too low to
generate PNB signals from the larger NPs or clusters. In the above-threshold mode, high laser
fluence leads to consistent PNB generation that can be visually determined without calibration.
However, additional tests for the negative control sample as a reference are necessary to
determine the threshold. This can be addressed by splitting the laser beams for simultaneous
detection of positive and negative controls, and thus providing automated background-subtracted
detection and internal control for validation.
In the digital assays, increasing the total counting number benefits the sensitivity
enhancement and reduces the measurement error (6). In the DIAMOND platform, we can
increase the data collection time, but this is a tedious way to acquire more data points (Fig. S11
and Table S3). Alternatively, we can use pulse laser with higher repetition rate. Considering the
PNB’s lifetime is at nanosecond range, we can use a pulsed laser with repetition rate up to 1
MHz (pulse interval = 1 microsecond). Also, we relied on the repetition rate and flow speed to
generate independent PNB events. Taking all parameters (e.g., flow speed, laser diameter,
repetition rate, and capillary size) into consideration, we calculated the sampling efficiency of
current system is 20-40% along and 5-10% orthogonal to the flow direction, respectively (Fig.
S12). Such low sampling efficiencies greatly limit the number of detected events and lead to
Poisson noise and measurement error. Considering a repetition of 10-100 kHz, a micro-channel
with a comparable size to the beam diameter and a faster flow speed, this would allow collecting
million nanobubble signals within minutes. We envision that such optimizations may allow
further improvements in the performance of DIAMOND in terms of the detection sensitivity and
measurement uncertainty.
In summary, we have developed DIAMOND as a novel method for single-particle digital
counting in a AuNP homogeneous assay. DIAMOND allows single NPs detection and
identification of heterogeneity from a uniform population. Such capability makes DIAMOND a
compartment-free digital counting platform and allows its implementation on homogeneous
assays. Importantly, DIAMOND achieves enhanced detection sensitivity and completes tests
within minutes without additional steps, making it a highly promising platform for rapid and
ultrasensitive diagnostics.

Fig. 1. The schematics illustration for the concept of DIAMOND. (A) The spectroscopybased signal generation and detection. The gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) as labels are used for the
generation of the plasmonic nanobubbles (PNBs) by short laser pulses and subsequently detected
by a secondary probe laser due to the optical scattering. (B) The detection principle based on
optofluidic scanning of a sample flowing through. The “on” and “off” refer to the positive and
negative PNB signals representing for the presence or absence of targets.

Representative PNB signal traces (100 pulses) for 75 nm AuNP suspensions with different
particle concentrations. Schematics represent the decreased number (λ) of AuNPs per detection.
Red triangles mark the positive PNB signals. (B) Quantification of AuNP concentrations by
plotting the frequency count (fon) against λ. (C) Correlation between experimental fon and the
theoretical probability (P) based on Poisson statistics. (D) Representative PNB signals traces
(100 pulses) for AuNP suspensions with different sizes. Schematics represent the increasing
AuNP sizes and same AuNP number per detection. (E) Single PNB signals extracted from (D).
PD is photodetector. (F) Correlations between the amplitude and AUC of PNB signals as a
function of AuNP size. Black lines denote the statistical average values.

Fig. 3. Identification of heterogeneity by DIAMOND. (A) Representative PNB signals traces
(100 pulses) for 15 nm and 75 nm AuNPs and their mixture. Schematics represent the sample
information. (B) Bivariate plots of amplitude and AUC extracted from 3,000 pulses for the three
samples in (A). The dashed lines in cases (i) and (ii) indicate the same thresholds of amplitude
(Tamp) and AUC (TAUC). The red arrow in case (iii) highlights scatters at 0. (F) Bar plot of
experimental frequencies (fon) as determined in (B) for cases (ii) and (iii) and theoretical
probability predicted by Poisson statistics. n.s. stands for no significant difference (p-value>0.05).
The error bars for experimental fon indicate the standard deviations of three independent
measurements and for theory, it is the Poisson noise-associated coefficient of variation 1
where N is the number of counted “on” signals.
