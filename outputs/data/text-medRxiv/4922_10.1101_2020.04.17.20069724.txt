A BSTRACT
Singapore is one of the countries which has taken early, systematic, and rigorous nationwide responses
to slowing the COVID-19 contagion down. By February 4, 2020, the government of Singapore
restricted the mobility of the vulnerable age-groups. In the current study, we study the influence of
the age-based vulnerability of the population with respect to COVID-19 conditions on the recovery
of COVID-19 patients. We study 245 patients in Singapore recovered and discharged during January
23–April 01. We first study the descriptive statistics of the length of in-hospital stay (LOS) of the
COVID-19 patients based on demographic variables, namely age, and gender. Then, we determine
the distribution of LOS, using local and generalized linear regression models. We take the approach
of periodization based on critical changes in the disease transmission model. Even though the
overall recovery rate has reduced drastically after a sudden spike in daily confirmations, our analysis
shows that there is a considerable shift in the COVID-19 confirmations to the population in the
non-vulnerable age-groups. We show that the LOS of the non-vulnerable age group is considerably
lower at 9 days, as opposed to 15 or 20 days in the existing literature.

1 Introduction
The viral contagion, named COVID-19, was declared as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on
March 11, 20202 . The pandemic, characterized by atypical pneumonia, is caused by a virus from the coronavirus family,
namely SARS-CoV2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2), which is a positive-sense single-stranded
RNA virus. As of April 2, there were 827,419 positively confirmed cases, and 40,777 deaths, spread across 206
countries 3 , and the ratio of the number of the recovered4 to the infected patients, rri was ∼0.2. On the other hand, in
Singapore, 245 of 1000 COVID-19 positive cases had clinically recovered by April 1, giving rri =0.245. Aside from the
recovered/hospital-discharged cases, the first two deaths in Singapore owing to the COVID-19 complications were only
three by April 1. The count of the recovered was ∼79.5% of closed cases (i.e., recovery and death) worldwide, whereas
∼98.8% in Singapore. Another Southeast Asian country with similar COVID-19 response, South Korea crossed its first
1000 COVID-19 confirmations5 during January 20-February 26, i.e., within 38 days, compared to 70 days in Singapore,
giving rri = 0.019 with the recovered being only 66.67% of closed cases.

A PREPRINT - J UNE 6, 2020

Singapore has fared well owing to its effective public healthcare system that implemented a quick and efficient pandemic
response since its first case got confirmed on January 23. The government enforced strict quarantine, isolation, hospital
surveillance, large-scale contact tracing, and testing. The centralization of the system has facilitated responsive data
gathering and anonymized patient-wise reporting to the public. The first cases of local transmission were determined
on February 4, after which there were concerted efforts to protect the age-groups, namely, (0-20) and (60+) years,
considered vulnerable to the COVID-19 conditions. South Korea has implemented similar measures but, did not focus
on the early containment of local transmission, unlike Singapore. Thus, the overall slow transmission of COVID-19 in
Singapore indicates that its early measures have been effectively slowed local transmission.
In this study, we focus on the influence of the age-based vulnerability of the population on the clinical recovery of
the patients in Singapore during January 23-April 1. We hypothesize that these containment measures have indirectly
reduced the length of in-hospital stay (LOS), ∆tLOS , for COVID-19. We use the open data available through the official
press releases of the Ministry of Health (MoH), Government of Singapore, for this study. Thus, we emphasize on the
credibility of our study owing to the reliability, accessibility, and availability of the data [1]. A demographic analysis of
the discharged patients complements similar demographic-related observations in differential disease transmission, e.g.,
higher fatality in older males with comorbidities [2, 3]. We perform piecewise analyses for estimating time-varying
∆tLOS using periodization, similar to the estimation of reproduction number [4, 5]. We study the temporal changes in
the age-gender distribution of the COVID-19 patients and discharged ones to estimate ∆tLOS . We then determine the
statistical significance of the demographic variables and period on ∆tLOS , and find appropriate distributions of the LOS
and fitting multivariate regression models. The novel contribution of our work is in linking the temporal reduction in
∆tLOS to the demographic structure.

2 Methods
The data for our work has been collated from the case summaries in the public press releases made by the MoH6 . We use
the age, gender, positive confirmation date, and discharge date from these anonymized summaries. We define the length
of in-hospital stay ∆tLOS as the time elapsed between positive and two consecutive negative COVID-19 confirmations
using the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests. Owing to the strict protocols
followed by the Singapore healthcare system, the COVID-19 patients are hospitalized upon positive confirmation.
Hence, recovery-period here is equivalent to the virus shedding period, which is estimated to be 15 days [6] or 20
days [7].Overall, we study the ∆tLOS of 245 patients who were discharged by April 1 (§Figure 1). (Additional data
along with supporting details of the pandemic response in Singapore until April 1 are given in Section 1, Supplementary
File.)
Age-gender distribution: Using age-groups of 10 years, we observe that the age-gender distribution of the confirmed/infected, and the recovered are different (§Figure 1(a)(i)), where the gender ratios (male to female) are 1.36 and
1.27 respectively. (The age-gender data is given as percentages in Table S1, Supplementary File.) The highest counts of
the confirmed and the recovered are in the age-groups (20-29) years (§Figure 1(a)(ii)) and (30-39) (§Figure 1(a)(iii))
years, respectively, demonstrating a conspicuous shift of the affected population to the age groups (20-39) years.
Periodization: The first imported and local transmission cases were confirmed on January 23 and February 4,
respectively. There is a sudden spike in the daily confirmations on March 17. We periodize using these events for
piecewise analysis of the pandemic progression (§Figure 1(b)). Given the cumulative counts of positive confirmed
cases, Ni , discharged/recovered cases, Nr , and deceased, Nd , we get:
1. Period P1 (period of imported cases) during January 23-February 3, (Ni =18, Nr =0, Nd =0).
2. Period P2 (period of local transmission) during February 4-March 16, (Ni =243, Nr =109, Nd =0).
3. Period P3 (period of community transmission) during March 17-April 1, (Ni =1000, Nr =245, Nd =3).
We observe from the periodwise age-gender distribution that P1 is different from both P2 and P3 (§Figure 1(a)(ii),(a)(iii)).
r
The ratio of recovered to infected, rri , i.e., N
Ni , has increased from 0.00 to 0.45, again dipped to 0.245, through P1
to P3 . However, since the trend in rri does not explicitly show the influence of shifts in the age-gender distribution
(§Figure 1(a)(ii)) of Ni and Nr on ∆tLOS , we analyse the time-varying ∆tLOS using descriptive statistics and regression.
LOS analysis: Descriptive statistical analysis of ∆tLOS in groups based on gender, age, and period give the preliminary
findings of the variables on ∆tLOS . We use two appropriate regression models to estimate ∆tLOS . Firstly, we use
the time-series of ∆tLOS and fit a line using the loess model. Loess is a non-parametric local regression model for
smoothening empirical time-series data [8] and scatterplots [9]. Secondly, we consider ∆tLOS as an observed count

variable and fit the frequency distribution of ∆tLOS into a multivariate linear regression models. We use semi-parametric
generalized linear models (GLM) for regression, with age, gender, and period are predictor variables, and ∆tLOS as the
dependent variable. For the period-wise analysis of ∆tLOS , we group the discharged patients based on their positive
confirmation date, G+cfrmDt . An alternative grouping is also possible based on their discharge date, G−cfrmDt . Since
the protocols followed in the hospital are similar for patients with closer admission dates, the G+cfrmDt grouping shows
more cohesive descriptive statistics of ∆tLOS than the G−cfrmDt grouping. Hence, we use the G+cfrmDt grouping here.
(The descriptive statistics of ∆tLOS with G−cfrmDt grouping is given in Table S2, Supplementary File.)
We use the loess model [8] to smooth the conditional means in the observations of ∆tLOS for getting its trendline.
Loess uses linear least squares regression model, y = g(x) + ε, with independent and dependent variables, x and y,
respectively, a smooth function g (we use the Gaussian function), and a 0-mean constant-scale random variable as
the error value, ε. The loss function εw (x) = w(x).(y − g(x))2 is minimized using a weight function w(x). Loess
uses a key parameter, span α, that is the control parameter for the size of the local neighborhood. When α < 1,
w(x) = (1 − |d|3 )3 , the tricube weight function with d is the normalized distance from data points to the fitted curve,
and otherwise, w(x) = 0.
Given that school children and senior citizens are considered vulnerable groups, we implement age binning for
performing hypothesis testing and regression modeling. These age-bins (0-19), (20-59), and (60-89) are referred
to as A1 , A2 , and A3 , respectively. Thus, we use the binning of {male, female}, {P1 , P2 , P3 }, and {A1 , A2 , A3 }
for gender, period, and age, respectively, for hypothesis testing and determining appropriate GLM’s. We use the
Kruskal-Wallis H (KWH) test of ∆tLOS with respect to age-bins, and with the period, separately. The KWH test is
a rank-based non-parametric test to determine if two or more groups of an independent ordinal/continuous variable
(age or period) have statistically significant differences with the continuous dependent variable (∆tLOS ). We use the
Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon (MWW) test of ∆tLOS with respect to gender. The MWW test is a non-parametric two-sample
test to verify the null hypothesis that the distribution of a continuous variable (∆tLOS ), which is not normal, is the same
in two or more independent groups formed based on a nominal/categorical independent variable (gender).

A PREPRINT - J UNE 6, 2020

We determine the appropriate GLM by experimenting with Poisson (PRM) and negative binomial (NBM) distributions
for ∆tLOS . These distributions are commonly used for LOS, owing to its naturally skewed distribution [10], and for
over-dispersed data [11], such as LOS. Here, we fit the model using frequency distribution of LOS, and model has LOS
as dependent variable Y , and age, gender, and period of infection as predictor variables X1 , X2 , and X3 , respectively.
They are used as numerical, nominal, and ordinal type variables, respectively. We assume the frequency distribution of
Y to be Poisson with E(Y ) = V ar(Y ) = µ, or negative binomial, where V ar(Y ) = µ is relaxed. Thus, the GLM
with intercept β0 , regression coefficients, βi for i = 1, 2, 3, and error term ε is given as:
g(µ) = β0 + β1 X1 + β2 X2 + β3 X3 + ε.

• Period-wise, based on G+cfrmDt grouping (§Figure 2(iii)):
– (N =18, M =17.61, SD=6.6, Mdn=17, IQR=[11.5, 22.75]) days for P1 ,
– (N =161, M =11.88, SD=5.81, Mdn=12, IQR=[8, 16]) days for P2 ,
– (N =66, M =8.58, SD=3.35, Mdn=9, IQR=[6, 11]) days for P3 .
We observe that the ∆tLOS is overall lesser in this dataset than reported in early analyses of COVID-19 patients, i.e.,
15 days [6] and 20 days [7]. The overall median of ∆tLOS and the gender-weighted median is 11 days, while the
age-weighted and period-weighted medians are 10.7 and 11.6 days, respectively. Thus, the overall descriptive statistical
analysis gives a conservative estimate of ∆tLOS to be ∼11 days.
There is a monotonous decrease in ∆tLOS with time, demonstrated from P1 to P3 . To analyse this observation further,
we look at the period-wise descriptive statistics for ∆tLOS with respect to gender, using G+cfrmDt grouping.
• For females: (N =9, M =16.33, SD=6.44, Mdn=13, IQR=[11, 22]) days for P1 , (N =69, M =11.8, SD=6.1,
Mdn=12, IQR=[7, 15]) days for P2 , and (N =30, M =8.57, SD=3.36, Mdn=9, IQR=[6.25, 11]) days for P3 .
• For males: (N =9, M =18.89, SD=6.88, Mdn=20, IQR=[17, 23]) days for P1 , (N =92, M =11.93, SD=5.61,
Mdn=12, IQR=[8, 16]) days for P2 , and (N =36, M =8.22, SD=3.37, Mdn=8, IQR=[5.75, 11]) for P3 .
We observe that ∆tLOS has similar descriptive statistics across both genders in P3 than in P1 or P2 . The IQR of ∆tLOS
decreases from P1 to P3 for both genders, indicating the decrease in the measure of the spread of ∆tLOS with time.
(The age-groupwise breakdown of descriptive statistics is given in Table S2, with corresponding box-and-whisker plots
in Figure S2 in the Supplementary File.)
There is a strong influence of age as well as period on ∆tLOS , unlike gender. ∆tLOS is relatively lower for the age
group of (20-29) years, specifically. This result is significant as the age group of (20-29) years contributes the highest
(27.3%) to the infected population and relatively high (14.6%) to the recovered population. At the same time, the
number of COVID-19 cases has increased in this age group over time, as 88.6% of the patients in this age group have
been confirmed positive in P3 . Thus, our key conclusion is that since the most susceptible group of people has lower
∆tLOS , the overall ∆tLOS is influenced by age to decrease with time progressively.
Loess model: We smooth the time-series of the ∆tLOS , represented as a scatter plot based on hospital admission dates
(§Figures 2 (iv)) using loess, implemented using loess7 with default span α = 0.75 in R [12]. The loess model for
discharged patients during January 23-April 01 gives the following degrees of freedom (df ) and residual standard error
(RSE) for N patients: (N =245, df =5.37, RSE=145.4) (§Figure 2(iv)). ∆tLOS has a slope of −25o in P3 . Thus, the key
conclusion from the local regression model on the time-series is the negative slope, i.e., a downward trend in ∆tLOS in
P3 . (Smoothing of periodwise observations using separate loess models is given in Figure S1 in Supplementary File.)
Multivariate linear regression model: The regression model can be made piecewise with respect to a predictor
variable in the case of non-monotonous behavior of the observed variable with respect to the predictor variable. We
observe that the median ∆tLOS monotonously increases from age-bins (20-29) to (50-59), and then further monotonously
decreases with age (§Figure 2 (ii)). There is anomalous behavior in age-bin (0-19). Unlike age, we observe that ∆tLOS
shows monotonous behavior in the case of gender and period (§Figure 2 (i), (iii)). Hence, we use the piecewise GLMs
for regression with respect to age-bins.
We have implemented the hypothetical tests using kruskal.test and wilcox.test in Stats package in R [12]. The
null hypothesis H0 is that “all groups are statistically similar,” and the alternative H1 hypothesis is that “all groups are
not statistically similar.” We reject the H0 when p-value <5%. Our results (§Table 1) show that groups based on the
period with G+cfrmDt grouping show statistically significant differences, thus indicating that period influences ∆tLOS .

The loess model is a default local regression model used for a sample with less than 1000 observations in Stats package in R.

A PREPRINT - J UNE 6, 2020

With respect to our study on vulnerable populations, we see that A2 sub-population with the G+cfrmDt grouping shows
statistical significance with respect to the period, unlike A1 and A3 . We observe that both male and female separately
have statistical differences with respect to period. Overall, these results confirm the use of age-binning for piecewise
GLMs.
We consider two modeling scenarios for GLM, where we use age, gender, and period as independent variables: M1
which is a single GLM for all 245 patients; and M2 with three piecewise linear GLM’s for A1 , A2 , and A3 , respectively.
(The count distribution and approximation of distribution functions are shown in Figure S3, Supplementary File.)
We have implemented these models using the glm in Stats package in R [12]. For GLM with Poisson and binomial
families, the dispersion is fixed at 1.0, and the number of parameters (k) is the same as the number of coefficients in
the regression model [12]. The negative binomial distribution has an additional parameter to model over-dispersion in
the data. We use the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and its corrected version for a small sample size (AICc ) for
determining
 the goodness of fit of our proposed models. For the number of samples (N ) in the data, we use AIC when
N
>
40
, and AICc , otherwise [13]. We infer the following from our results (§Table 2):
k
• The “period” variable is significant for both models and all scenarios, except M2 (age:(0-19)), with p-value
<5% for corresponding coefficients.
• The “age” and “gender” variables are significant only in the PRM for M2 (age:(20-59)) and M2 (age:(60-89))
respectively, with p-value of corresponding coefficients being <5%, confirming the age-bin (20-59) getting
progressively affected with time, and co-morbidities in older males, respectively.
• The NBM shows lower medians and the variances (observable from range and IQR) of deviance residuals, and
AIC/AICc and more consistent ∆tLOS for maximum likelihood value than the PRM. Thus, NBM is a better fit
than PRM.
• Overall, the small sample size in M2 (age:(0-19)) makes the modeling erroneous. For both PRM and NBM,
the remaining piecewise models in scenario M2 are a better fit than the single model, M1 , owing to the lower
error measures (AIC/AICc and deviance residuals) as well as the consistency in the maximum likelihood value.
We also find that the errors, MSE and RMSE in M1 , are reduced when we exclude the samples of (age:(0-19))
from the observations.
Overall, choosing NBM and M2 , we estimate ∆tLOS = 9 days with a maximum likelihood of 7.5%. Since we do not
have a large number of variables to discard, we retain the “gender” and “age” variables in the model despite its relative
insignificance compared to “period.” Our additional experiments show that the error values increase in the absence
of the period as an independent variable. The key conclusion from the hypothesis testing and multivariate regression
analysis is that a GLM with NBM for M2 is the best model to estimate ∆tLOS .

4 Discussion
In summary, ∆tLOS can be estimated to have decreased to 9 days during January 23-April 01, 2020, in Singapore. We
have shown that the recovery in the vulnerable groups, such as the children and the older population, has become
insignificant with time. Our work shows that this temporal shift in the demographic structure has led to the overall
decrease in ∆tLOS , which is reflected in two results. Firstly, we observe “period” causes significant differences in the
distribution of ∆tLOS in both the entire population, as well as, specifically, in age-bin (20-59) (A2 ) subpopulation.
Secondly, we find that “age” is a significant variable for the multivariate regression model with PRM for the population
of the age-bin (20-59) years in M2 . These indicate that our age-binning and periodization are significant in analyzing
and estimating ∆tLOS . Periodwise piecewise GLM’s of observations in A2 , with age and gender as predictor variables,
show that the estimate of ∆tLOS reduces from ∼16 days in P1 to ∼9 days in P2 , and further to ∼8 days in P3 . (Details
of the periodwise GLMs are in Table S3 in Supplementary File.) Thus, our findings of the progressive decrease in ∆tLOS
are confirmed using these models. The overall reduction in ∆tLOS is an outcome of the significance of ∆tLOS in A2 ,
which is the non-vulnerable population.
Our findings can be attributed to the early response of restricted mobility of the vulnerable groups. The vulnerable
population becoming insignificant can be an outcome of the increase in positive confirmations in the non-vulnerable
group. However, our work has the limitation of modeling recovery exclusively, without the interaction with the
distribution of daily positive confirmations. With Ni = 1000 in Singapore by April 1, but Nr = 245, we have not
analyzed the outcome of the remaining 755 patients. Our study can be enriched by doing a similar analysis on all the
cases confirmed by April 1, closed by recovery and death. Our regression model can be improved to include interaction
effects, which could be effective if we have additional data on other variables, e.g., co-morbidities, whose data is not
available in the public domain. Nevertheless, our estimated ∆tLOS based on the first 245 discharged patients is useful
for assessing the hospital load in terms of required resources for the in-hospital stay of the COVID-19 cases.
