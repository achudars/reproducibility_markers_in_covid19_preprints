Abstract
Background: Promising preclinical experiments show that, under specific and monitored
conditions, ultraviolet-A (UVA) exposure reduces certain bacteria, fungi, and viruses including
coronavirus-229E without harming mammalian columnar epithelial cells. We aimed to evaluate
the safety and effects of UVA therapy administered by a novel device via endotracheal tube in
critically ill subjects with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Methods: Five newly intubated mechanically ventilated adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection,
with an endotracheal tube size 7.5mm or greater, were treated with UVA for 20 minutes daily for
5 days, and followed for 30 days.
Results: Five subjects were enrolled (mean age 56.6yrs, 3 male). At baseline, all subjects scored
9/10 on the WHO clinical severity scale (10=death) with predicted mortality ranging from 21 to
95%. Average log changes in endotracheal viral load from baseline to day 5 and day 6 were 2.41 (range -1.16 to -4.54; Friedman P=0.002) and -3.20 (range -1.20 to -6.77; Friedman
P<0.001), respectively. There were no treatment-emergent adverse events. One subject died 17
days after enrollment due to intracranial hemorrhagic complications of anticoagulation while
receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The remaining subjects clinically improved and
scored 2, 4, 5, and 7 on the WHO scale at day 30. In these subjects, the slope of viral load
reduction during UVA treatment correlated with the slope of improvement in clinical WHO
severity score over time (Spearman rho=1, P<0.001).
Conclusion: In this first-in-human study, endotracheal UVA therapy under specific and
monitored settings, was safe with a significant reduction in respiratory SARS-CoV-2 viral
burden over the treatment period.
Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov #NCT04572399.

Introduction
Since the first report of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)
infection in December 2019, the global quest to find a highly effective modality to treat severe
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been disappointing. Direct cytotoxic effects of SARSCoV-2 along with dysregulated inflammatory responses and secondary respiratory infections
continue to inflict substantial morbidity and mortality in severe and critical cases of COVID19.[1-3] One mechanism to explain SARS-CoV-2 virulence may be through impairment of the
mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) protein, responsible for innate antiviral responses.[4]
Externally applied ultraviolet light therapy is an approved treatment for several atopic,
inflammatory and dysplastic dermatologic disorders.[5] In preclinical experiments, ultraviolet-A
(UVA) exposure under monitored conditions (i.e. specific intensity, peak wavelength, exposure
time and distance to target tissue), reduces bacteria, fungi, and viruses including coronavirus229E but does not harm human (in vitro) or murine (in vivo) columnar epithelial cells.[6]
Moreover, UVA exposure of coronavirus-229E transfected human primary tracheal cells led to
activation of the MAVS protein, reduction in spike protein, and resumption of cell proliferation
similar to uninfected cells, suggesting that UVA may induce a beneficial antiviral state in
infected human cells.[6]
Using these newly discovered principles, we aimed to investigate the safety and treatment effects
of a novel device inserted into the endotracheal tube to deliver UVA and reduce the viral burden
of respiratory SARS-CoV-2 in critically ill subjects.

Methods
Trial design
In this first-in-human study, we aimed to recruit and treat 5 subjects. The trial protocol
(ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT04572399) was approved by the institutional review board of
Cedars-Sinai, Los Angeles and was overseen by an independent data and safety monitoring
board (DSMB). Subjects’ legally authorized representatives provided written informed consent.
Inclusion criteria included age over 18 years, positive PCR test result for SARS-CoV-2 on nasal
swab, and mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube (ETT) inner diameter of ≥7.5 mm.
Pregnant women were excluded. Subjects received all standard supportive care; concomitant use
of any other COVID-19 treatments was permitted.

UVA device
The UVA therapy device (Aytu Biosciences, Englewood, CO) consisted of a 5.4 mm diameter
sterile sealed multi-LED UVA light catheter within a protective sheath and endotracheal adaptor,
umbilical, and control unit (Fig. S1). The UVA catheter adaptor was connected to the ETT using
a double-swivel multi-access port (Halyard Health, GA) to maintain a closed-loop system and
prevent ambient exposure to exhaled air upon introduction of the catheter into the ETT.

Procedure
Within 24 hours of enrollment, subjects underwent 20 minutes of endotracheal UVA
therapy, which was repeated once daily for a total of 5 consecutive days. All subjects received
100% FiO2 for 30 minutes prior to the procedure (see Supplemental Materials and Methods for
protocol). The UVA catheter was inserted to the distal end of the ETT, with concomitant

ventilator adjustments to flow rate and tidal volume to maintain optimal oxygenation. A plastic
clamp fixed the catheter base to the access port to assure stability and consistent depth of catheter
insertion throughout the 20-minute treatment session. The procedural instructional video can be
accessed at: https://cedars.box.com/s/0lqm2slw1vlyt4j5em70xregfro4592t. UVA dosing was
chosen based on the optimal response of coronavirus 229E-infected human primary tracheal cells
to UVA exposure observed in in vitro experiments.[6] Controlled narrow-band UVA emission
(peak wavelength 340-345nm) of maximum 2 milliwatt/cm2 was delivered at the level of tracheal
mucosa. Predetermined criteria for treatment cessation and withdrawal of the UVA catheter
included O2 saturation drop below 88% or hemodynamic instability.

Endotracheal (ET) aspirates were taken prior to each UVA treatment and 24 hours after the last
UVA treatment for assessment of SARS-CoV-2 and absolute bacterial loads. Steps in
preparation of the sampling traps and tracheal sampling, as well as sample processing and
analysis for viral and absolute bacterial loads are provided in the Supplemental Materials and
Methods. Absolute quantification of bacterial load represented culturable and non-culturable,
viable and non-viable, pathogenic, and non-pathogenic bacteria.

Baseline, hospital, and ICU admission-related information including relevant clinical, laboratory,
and radiologic data were recorded for all patients until 30 days after enrollment. The World
Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 10-point ordinal severity scale[7] was calculated at
enrollment, and on days 15 and 30 following enrollment. SOFA[8] and SAPSIII[9,10] scores
were calculated from the worst values within 24 hours of ICU admission.

Outcomes and statistical analysis
The primary endpoint was the change in ET aspirate SARS-CoV-2 viral load from day 0 to the
last day of treatment. Secondary outcomes included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs),
changes in endotracheal absolute bacterial load, clinical outcomes and laboratory parameters
including inflammatory markers, and changes in the WHO COVID-19 10-point ordinal scale of
improvement from baseline to day 15 and 30.

Freidman test was used to detect differences across daily viral and bacterial loads. One sample ttest was used to analyze changes in inflammatory markers and microbial loads from day 0 to day
1[11]. Spearman rank-order test was used to assess correlations between the reduction of viral
load (log10) and the improvement of WHO scale. The reduction of viral load (log) from baseline
to the final endotracheal sample was defined as the slope of the linear regression between log10
viral load and time point of viral load measurements. Similarly, the estimated improvement of
WHO scale from baseline through day 30 was the slope of the linear regression between WHO
scale and the time of WHO scale measurements. A significance level of α=0.05 was used.

Results
Between October 30, 2020 and November 28, 2020, 5 subjects were enrolled (mean age 56.6yrs,
3 male). Baseline characteristics of the enrolled subjects are summarized in Table 1, and a
summary of the timeline and key events is presented in Figure 1. At the time of intubation, all 5
patients were critically ill, with WHO COVID-19 ordinal scale scores of 9 in all subjects, and
with SOFA scores predicting a 20-95% mortality rate. All patients received daily 20-minute
treatments starting within the first 36 hours following intubation, for 5 days. Baseline and day 6
ET aspirates were taken in all patients except for study subject #1 who was extubated on day 6.
Hence, a total of 29 ET aspirates were analyzed.

Primary Outcome
Subjects had elevated viral loads at baseline (range 3.4x104 - 1.64x107 copies/ml) except for
study subject 2 who had an undetectable viral load at all time points, demonstrating that virus
had cleared since the last nasal swab (Fig. S2). There was no significant correlation between
symptom onset date and either baseline (Spearman rho=-0.70, p=0.23) or day 6 viral loads
(Spearman rho=-0.21, p=0.83).

There was a significant reduction of SARS-CoV-2 levels in endotracheal aspirates during UVA
treatment. The average log10 changes in endotracheal viral load from baseline to day 5 and day 6
were -2.41 (range -1.16 to -4.54; Friedman p=0.002) and -3.2 (range -1.2 to -6.77; Friedman
p<0.001), respectively (Fig. 2, Fig. S2).

Secondary and Clinical Outcomes
Among the secondary outcome measures, quantification of absolute endotracheal bacterial load
at baseline ranged from 1x103 - 1.7x 106 CFU/ml and remained statistically unchanged during the
UVA treatment sessions (Fig. S3).

The clinical course for each subject is shown in Figure 1. WHO clinical severity scores improved
by an average of 1.6 and 3.6 points on day 15 and day 30, respectively. Excluding subject 2 who
had undetectable baseline viral load, WHO severity scores improved by 4.75 points on day 30
(Table S1). All subjects survived except study subject 2, who was placed on comfort care
following intracranial hemorrhage due to ECMO-associated anticoagulation and died on ICU
day 17. Interestingly, there was an association between WHO clinical severity score outcomes
and viral reductions during UVA treatment. Improvement in WHO severity scores by day 30
exhibited a positive correlation with the reduction of viral load during UVA therapy (Spearman’s
rho=1, p<0.001) (Fig. 2c). Following UVA therapy, there was a significant drop in C-reactive
protein (-95.0 ± 48.0 mg/L, p=0.04) within 7 days of enrollment. Observed reductions in
interleukin-6 (-258.9 ± 621.4 pg/mL, p=047) and ferritin (-563.6 ± 514.8 ng/mL, p=0.12) did not
reach statistical significance (Table S2).

Safety outcomes
No treatment-emergent adverse events or need for treatment cessation was observed in the study.
Oxygen saturations and hemodynamics during all treatment sessions remained stable. None of
the subjects experienced pneumothorax, subcutaneous emphysema, or endotracheal tube (ETT)

eventually underwent bronchoscopy for tracheostomy tube placement for prolonged intubation
which revealed normal looking tracheae without erythema or friability (Fig. S4). An independent
Data and Safety Monitoring Board did not recommend any changes to the treatment protocol for
future planned trials.

Discussion
The global challenge associated with the COVID-19 pandemic is a bitter reminder that safe and
effective therapies are desperately needed to treat resistant and/or novel pathogens. While
externally applied UV therapy is commonly used in dermatologic diseases, due to technological
limitations and knowledge gaps, internal UV therapy has never previously been performed. In
this first-in-human study, endotracheal UVA light appeared safe in critically ill patients with
COVID-19. Furthermore, a significant reduction in endotracheal SARS-CoV-2 levels was
observed following 5 days of UVA therapy. Finally, the reduction of viral load during UVA
treatment correlated with the reduction in the WHO clinical severity scores.

Apart from a dysregulated inflammatory response, heightened viral replication has a critical role
in pathogenesis of severe and critical COVID-19. There is a significant association between
respiratory SARS-CoV-2 load and mortality.[12] In addition, severe cases of COVID-19 exhibit
longer duration and a later peak of virus in respiratory samples as compared to mild disease.[13]
Aligned with these findings, 4 out of 5 of our subjects had high viral loads in the endotracheal
aspirate at baseline ICU care without a significant correlation with the time of symptom onset. In
addition, improvement of WHO clinical severity scores by day 30 significantly correlated with
the reduction of viral load during UVA therapy. Taken together, these suggest a temporal overlap
between the viral replication and hyperinflammatory phases[2] in the disease course of critically
ill COVID-19 patients. Hence, these patients may continue to benefit both from viral load
reduction and from improvement of the innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2. UVA
potentially possesses the ability to provide benefit in both areas. Firstly, we have shown
previously that UVA therapy exhibits antiviral effects against positive sense, single-stranded

RNA viruses including coxsackievirus and coronavirus-229E.[6] Secondly, in vitro UVA
exposure led to activation of MAVS protein in virally infected primary human tracheal cells, a
pathway that is directly impaired by SARS-CoV-2. Activation of the MAVS protein pathway by
UVA exposure in SARS-CoV-2-infected tracheal cells may be a mechanism behind the
significant reduction of viral load along the respiratory tract in our study despite only intermittent
and localized UVA therapy in the upper airway.

As compared to conventional microbial cultures, absolute bacterial load quantified by PCR
detects a greater number of bacteria including unculturable and non-viable bacteria yielding
higher load of bacteria. We did not detect a significant change in endotracheal aspirate bacterial
loads during UV therapy. This is encouraging and is likely due to leveraging a closed-loop
system for introduction of the sterile UVA catheter. We previously have shown that UVA
reduces several known pathogens linked to ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) including
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis,
Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Candida albicans.[14] The potential
role of UVA therapy in the prevention of VAP by decreasing or delaying tracheal and ETT
colonization of pathogenic bacteria warrants further assessment but the lack of rise in bacteria
seen here is promising. No treatment emergent adverse events occurred during the 25 UVA
treatment sessions and serious/severe adverse events were unrelated to the treatment
intervention. Oxygenation and hemodynamics remained stable during all treatments. Subsequent
bronchoscopy in 2 subjects revealed normal-looking trachea, consistent with our preclinical invivo and in-vitro safety experiments.[6] Subject number 2 died due to complications of ECMOrelated anticoagulation (intracranial hemorrhage) despite stable oxygenation at the time of stroke.

Bleeding occurs in approximately 50% of patients undergoing ECMO [15] with intracranial
hemorrhage having an 85% risk of mortality.[16] Despite being in a highly critical state, 4 out of
5 subjects survived and had meaningful clinical improvements (Table S1). Further trials are
needed to elucidate whether UVA therapy can improve clinical outcomes.

Our study has several limitations. As this was a first-in-human trial, the sample size was small.
However, subjects had a diverse distribution of several known risk factors for severity of
COVID-19 including age (range 38-65 years), sex (2 females and 3 males), race (1 non-Hispanic
white, 3 Hispanic White and 1 African American) and BMI (range 25-36). Of 5 patients, 3 had
the smallest allowable ETT size (7.5 mm) without any treatment-emergent adverse events. With
rapid advancements in LED and fiberoptic technology, future designs may accommodate patients
with smaller diameter ETTs. Finally, the natural history of SARS-CoV-2 load in endotracheal
aspirates is poorly defined. Zheng et al. observed a mean baseline respiratory viral load of 105
copies/ml in 74 severe cases and a very gradual rate of viral clearance in lower respiratory tract
(27.7 days from onset of symptoms) in 29 patients admitted to ICU.[13] The 3.2 log reduction in
our study after 5 days of UVA therapy appears to outpace the natural decline of respiratory viral
load. Further study may help characterize the natural history of SARS-CoV-2 levels in the
respiratory tract of ICU subjects.

Using a novel device in a specific and monitored setting, endotracheal UVA therapy in critically
ill subjects is associated with a significant reduction of respiratory SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Viral
load reduction correlated with improvements in the WHO severity score by day 30. Finally, to

Figure 1. Summary of the timeline and key events for enrolled subjects.

Figure 2. A) Reductions in endotracheal SARS-COV-2 loads from day 0 through day 6 in
patients with detectable viral load at baseline. Freidman test is used to analyze differences across
daily viral load measurements. B) Corresponding viral loads (log) for each subject at baseline,
day 5 and 6. Average log changes from baseline to day 5 and day 6 were -2.41(relative reduction
>99%) and -3.2 (relative reduction >99.9%), respectively. C) The individual slopes of reduction
in SARS-CoV-2 loads during UVA therapy correlated with the slopes of reduction in WHO
severity score by day 30.
