Abstract
Objective: Although contact tracing is generally not used to control influenza pandemics, China
and several countries in the Western Pacific Region employed contact tracing as part of
COVID-19 response activities. To improve understanding on the use of contact tracing for
COVID-19 emergency public health response activities, we describe reported COVID-19
contacts traced and quarantined in China and a proxy for number of reported contacts traced
per reported case.
Methods: We abstracted publicly available online aggregate data reported from China’s
National Health Commission and provincial health commissions’ COVID-19 daily situational
reports for January 20–February 29, 2020. The number of new contacts traced by report date
was computed as the difference between total contacts traced on consecutive reports. A proxy
for the number of contacts traced per case was computed as the number of new contacts
traced divided by the number of new cases.
Results: During January 20–February 29, 2020, China reported 80,968 new COVID-19 cases
(Hubei Province = 67,608 [83%]), and 659,899 contacts traced (Hubei Province = 265,617

[40%]). Non-Hubei provinces reported more contacts traced per case than Hubei Province; this
difference increased over time.
Discussion: Along with other NPI used in China, contact tracing likely contributed to reducing
SARS-CoV-2 transmission by quarantining a large number of potentially infected contacts.
Despite reporting only 15% of total cases, non-Hubei provinces had 1.5 times more reported
contacts traced compared to Hubei Province. Contract tracing may have been more complete
in areas and periods with lower case counts.
Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory illness caused by severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), first identified in December 2019 in Hubei
Province, China (1). On January 20, 2020, China National Health Commission (NHC) reported
evidence of person-to-person transmission and began reporting daily COVID-19 situational
reports. By January 31, 2020, ≥1 case had been reported from each of mainland China’s 31
provincial-level administrative units. A total of 82,875 cases were reported by May 1, of which
96% had been reported by February 29 (2).
Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) for respiratory viruses aim to reduce
transmission through individual or community actions, by preventing exposures. (3). China
implemented COVID-19 contact tracing with quarantine as part of a comprehensive COVID-19
prevention and control strategy, which also includes mask use, emphasis of hand hygiene,
enforced social distancing, and travel restrictions (8, 9).
Contact tracing is generally not used to control influenza pandemics because of short
generation time for cases and resource constraints (4). However, China and several countries
employed contact tracing as part of COVID-19 response activities (5-7). China’s contact
tracing strategy aimed to identify and quarantine exposed individuals to prevent additional

disease transmission. On January 20, 2020, China designated COVID-19 a notifiable disease
and updated the “Frontier Health and Quarantine Law” to allow quarantine of contacts (10).
National guidelines on epidemiologic investigations and the management of contacts were
issued and updated several times, and delegated responsibility for contact tracing to the local
level (11, 12). The latest guidelines define contacts as: “anyone who may have had contact
with a case through a range of circumstances or activities including being family members,
relatives, friends, colleagues, classmates, health care workers, and services personnel” (12).
Here, we describe the reported COVID-19 contacts traced and a proxy for number of
reported contacts traced per reported case in China during January 20–February 29, 2020.
Methods
We abstracted publicly available online aggregate data reported from NHC and
provincial health commissions’ COVID-19 daily situational reports (Technical Appendix). For
reports during January 20–February 29 (epidemiologic weeks 4–9), we collected daily reported
data on: newly reported cases and total contacts traced and placed under medical observation.
Data were reviewed for abstraction errors. Provinces with >95% data completeness were
included.
The number of new contacts traced by report date was computed as the difference
between total contacts traced on consecutive reports. A proxy for the number of contacts
traced per case was computed as the number of new contacts traced divided by the number of
new cases. These calculations were performed by epidemiologic week.
In additional to national and Hubei Province data, complete provincial-level data were
publicly available for 22 of 30 remaining provinces: Anhui, Chongqing, Gansu, Guangxi,
Guizhou, Hainan, Hebei, Heilongjiang, Henan, Hunan, Inner Mongolia, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Jilin,
Liaoning, Qinghai, Shaanxi, Shandong, Shanxi, Tianjin, Tibet, and Zhejiang. Eight provinces,
comprising 26% of the total population, were excluded due to no or insufficient reported data

(Beijing, Fujian, Guangdong, Ningxia, Shanghai, Sichuan, Xinjiang, and Yunnan). To
understand broader trends despite missing data from the eight excluded provinces, data for
Hubei Province were compared with all other provinces combined by calculating the difference
between national totals and totals for Hubei Province.
Results
During epidemiologic weeks 4–9, NHC reported 80,968 new COVID-19 cases (Hubei
Province = 67,608 [83% of total new cases reported]), and 659,899 contacts traced (Hubei
Province = 264,878 [40% of total contacts traced]) (Table). Reports occasionally noted slight
corrections to reported new cases without specifying dates. During the same time period, the
22 included non-Hubei provinces reported an aggregate total of 9,664 cases and 306,684
contacts traced. Among these 22 provinces (Table), those with the largest number of reported
cases and contacts traced were Henan (reported cases = 1,274/9,664 [13%]; reported
contacts = 39,199/306,684 [13%]) and Zhejiang (reported cases = 1,216/9,664 [13%]; reported
contacts = 41,050/306,684 [13%]).
The weekly number of contacts traced per case remained below 10 in Hubei Province
(range = 2.0 in epidemiologic week 7 to 8.2 in epidemiologic week 4); the lowest value in
epidemiologic week 7 occurred when 18,453 clinically diagnosed cases were included in
reported case counts for February 12–15, increasing the denominator substantially (Figure 1).
By comparison, in non-Hubei provinces the weekly number of contacts traced per case was
higher than in Hubei Province and increased from 17.2 in epidemiologic week 4 to 115.7 in
epidemiologic week 9. Provincial data from the 22 included non-Hubei provinces indicate that
the number of contacts traced per case increased as case counts declined while reported
number of contacts traced remained high or increased (Table). For example, Anhui Province
reported 60 cases with 1,023 reported contacts traced during epidemiologic week 4 (17.1

contacts traced per case) compared to 1 case with 915 reported contacts traced during
epidemiologic week 9 (915 contacts traced per case).
Discussion
Along with other NPI used in China, contact tracing likely contributed to reducing SARSCoV-2 transmission by quarantining a large number of potentially infected contacts (9). It
potentially helped to identify pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic infections early and reduced
the time from symptom onset to initiation of medical care (13, 14). Our analysis suggests that
contact tracing implementation and data reporting varied by province, with non-Hubei
provinces reporting similar trends that contrast trends in Hubei Province. Notably, despite
reporting only 15% of total cases, non-Hubei provinces had 1.5 times more reported contacts
traced compared to Hubei Province. Provincial-level differences likely reflect local capacity for
implementing contact tracing, differences in local disease transmission, and evolving
guidelines. These results suggest that contract tracing may have been more complete in areas
and periods with lower case counts, which was potentially linked to resource constraints.
Contact tracing with quarantine is resource intensive. For example, in Wuhan City,
contact tracing was conducted by 1,800 epidemiologists working in teams of five (8). Data on
provincial level contact tracing resources were not available. Geographic and temporal
differences may reflect variability in available resources, including trained staff for contact
tracing and medical observation, housing for contacts, and laboratory testing capacity. While
contact tracing identified and isolated a large number of potentially infected contacts, published
studies showed most contacts did not become reported cases; 30.4% (391 positive
contacts/1,286 contacts traced) in Shenzhen, 2.6% (129/4,950) in Guangzhou, and 2.3% (120
/5,241) in Xi’an (13-15).
This report has several limitations. First, without individual patient-level data, our
analysis is based on aggregate data and subject to ecological fallacy. Second, data were

compiled from publicly available online reports, and we did not have access to primary data.
This required excluding eight provinces and did not allow analysis of available contact tracing
resources. As such, data could not be externally verified, and the data collection methods were
not available, including confirmation that all reported contacts traced were linked to reported
confirmed cases. Second, inter-provincial variability may have affected reported data
comparability, and eight provinces were excluded. Finally, we do not know the distribution of
contacts for individual cases. The actual number of contacts traced likely differed by exposure
type (e.g., family, shopping center, public transport), and the proxy (mean contacts traced per
case) would overestimate median contacts per case when large numbers of contacts were
linked to a single case (i.e., attending a public gathering with a confirmed case).
Despite these limitations, our findings help describe contact tracing in China as part of
the COVID-19 response. Future investigations can aim to better understand the role of COVID19 contact tracing and quarantine, including timeliness of contact tracing and quarantine,
prioritization of contacts who are more likely associated with viral transmission and the
effectiveness of contact tracing in differing epidemiologic, social, and resource availability
contexts.

Province vs non-Hubei Provinces, epidemiologic weeks 4–9

Weekly number of contacts per case was calculated as the computed number of new contacts in an
epidemiologic week divided by the number of new cases reported in that week. In Hubei Province, the
lowest value in epidemiologic week 7 occurred when 18,453 clinically diagnosed cases were included in
reported case counts for February 12–15, increasing the denominator substantially.

* Of mainland China’s 30 non-Hubei provincial level administrative units, eight provinces were excluded as there was no or insufficient data reported on total number of
contacts (Beijing, Fujian, Guangdong, Ningxia, Shanghai, Sichuan, Xinjiang, and Yunnan).
The weekly number of contacts traced per case was calculated as the computed number of contacts in an epidemiologic week over the number of new cases reported
in that week. Cells with “-“ represent weeks were no cases were reported.
