Abstract
A simplified mathematical model of oral hydrocortisone delivery in adrenal insufficiency is
described; the model is based on three components (gastric hydrocortisone, free serum cortisol
and bound serum cortisol) and is formulated in terms of linear kinetics, taking into account
the dynamics of glucocorticoid–protein binding. Motivated by the need to optimise cortisol
replacement in the situations of COVID-19 infection, the model is fitted to recently-published
data on 50 mg dosing and earlier data on 10 mg dosing. The fitted model is used to predict
typical responses to standard dosing regimes, which involve a larger dose in the morning and 1
or 2 smaller doses later in the day, and the same regimes with doses doubled. In all cases there
is a circadian-like response, with early morning nadir. The model is also used to consider an
alternative dosing strategy based on four equal and equally-spaced doses of 10, 20 or 30 mg
per 24 h, resulting in a more even response resembling a response to sustained inflammatory
stress.

Background
The Prevention of Adrenal Crisis in Stress (PACS) study [1] aimed to identify the parenteral hydrocortisone dose and administration mode most suitable for glucocorticoid stress dose cover in
patients with adrenal insufficiency exposed to major stress, such as trauma, surgery or sepsis. This
included experimental data on serum cortisol levels measured by mass spectrometry after administering 200mg hydrocortisone in four different administration modes (50 mg qds orally or via bolus
intramuscular or intravenous injections, and continuous intravenous infusion of 200 mg/24 h). That
paper included a model of intravenous hydrocortisone administration and clearance, from which
predictions could be made, identifying an initial bolus of 50mg or 100 mg hydrocortisone followed
by continuous intravenous infusion of 200 mg hydrocortisone per 24 hours as the most appropriate
intervention.
Patients with adrenal insufficiency are required to increase their usual oral hydrocortisone dose
when experiencing intermittent illness with fever, which usually involves doubling of their regular
glucocorticoid replacement dose, with twice the regular dose taken at the same timepoints as usual.

stress dose cover as described above. During the time of COVID-19, however, patients with adrenal
insufficiency might require higher oral stress doses already initially, as the viral illness caused by
SAYS-cov2 often comes with significant fever, sweating and malaise early on. In addition, the high
and frequently continuous fever requires a more sustained delivery of hydrocortisone that adjusts in
dose and timing to the permanent inflammatory stress. Thus, we used the experimental data on
oral hydrocortisone administration [1] together with building on a previously developed approach [2]
to adapt the model for oral hydrocortisone administration, enabling us to select the most suitable
dose to recommend.

Model of oral administration with binding kinetics
We now describe an idealised model of oral hydrocortisone treatment. Comparing with the 1component linear kinetics model of Prete et al. [1] for intravenous delivery, it is necessary to take
into account the presence of a gastric compartment from which hydrocortisone must be absorbed,
then transported to the blood. A model consisting of two compartments only (gastric and serum
cortisol) was initially attempted, however it failed to replicate the dose response characteristics as
an oral dose is increased from 10 mg to 50 mg. We therefore expanded the model to take into
account a limited bound component, modelling the effect of binding protein, which slows excretion
at lower doses.
In detail the components of the model are: gastric hydrocortisone dose (S(t) mg, which is
increased by Qj each time a dose is taken), free serum cortisol Ff (t) nmol/L and bound cortisol
Fb (t) nmol/L. The concentration of binding protein is accounted for via B(t). Reactions will be
modelled as linear in all cases, however the finite quantity of binding protein available will result in
a nonlinear response.
The reactions in the model are:
• Uptake from stomach to blood, at rate kabs and with dilution factor α.
• Excretion of free cortisol at rate kex . Bound cortisol is assumed not to undergo significant
excretion [3].
• Binding of free cortisol to binding protein at rate kb and
• release of bound cortisol and protein at rate kr .
The system takes the form,

= −kabs S + q(t),

(2)

(3)

(4)

where q(t) is a function modelling the oral dosing. The initial conditions for an adrenal insufficient
patient will be approximated as S(0) = 0, Ff (0) = 0, Fb = 0 and B(0) = B0 where B0 is the
physiological level of binding protein (a value quoted in the literature is 650 nmol/L [4], although
this will vary between individuals).

The case of oral administration of a N doses Q = (Q1 , Q2 , . . . , QN ) at times t = (t1 , t2 , . . . , tN )
respectively can be represented by a sum of Dirac delta functions,
q(t) =

Qd δ(t − tn ).

The differential equaiton for S(t) can be integrated, yielding,
Z t
S(t) = exp(−kabs t)
q(t0 ) exp(kabs t0 )dt0 ,

where starting time t0 precedes the first dose. Denoting the heaviside function by H, equation 6
can be evaluated as,
N
X
S(t) =
Qn H(t − tn ) exp(kabs (tn − t)).
(7)
n=1

Adding equations (3) and (4) shows that Fb (t) + B(t) is constant and hence equal to its initial
value of B0 . Therefore the variable Fb (t) = B0 − B(t) may be eliminated from the model, leading
to the two-variable system,

The fraction of free to total cortisol Ff /(Ff +Fb ) is typically 5% [5]. Working on the assumption
that the binding/unbinding processes occur faster than absorption and excretion leads to the quasisteady approximation
0 ≈ −kb Ff B + kr (B0 − B),
(10)
which can be justified formally via dimensional analysis. Then

The first dimensionless parameter grouping will be denoted φ := kr /(kb B0 ); this grouping quantifies
the relative size of free to bound cortisol and will be found through fitting to time-course data. The
reason for working with this parameter grouping is that the full model is insensitive to the value of
kb , meaning that it is challenging to fit directly. We then have the approximation
Ff ≈ φ(B0 − B)

which enables the system to be reduced to a single variable.
Noting that the total cortisol is given by Ff + Fb = Ff + (B0 − B), we may write

This model can then be solved numerically for B(t), from which the total cortisol concentration
F (t) = Ff (t) + Fb (t) is then given by equation (12). There are three remaining parameters to
estimate by fitting to time series data for F (t): the dilution factor α, absorption rate kabs and
excretion rate kex .

Parameter estimation
Two datasets are used for fitting the model: the PACS [1] data on oral administration of 50 mg every
6 h in primary adrenal insufficiency patients, and published data from ref. [6] on oral administration
of a single dose of 10 mg in HPA-suppressed healthy individuals. Data from the latter study were
extracted digitally from the electronic journal article. The parameters α, kabs , kex , φ and B0 are
fitted to the two datasets simultaneously.
A high degree of fidelity is unlikely in this situation due to attempting to fit to two different
patient groups, dosing formulations and assays simultaneously with a relatively simple model; figure 1
shows reasonably good agreement, although appearing to under-predict the response at 10 mg and
over-predict at 50 mg. Nevertheless, the model does appear to be capable of giving approximate
information over a 5-fold change in dose.
The model can then be used to predict typical responses to a range of dosing regimes, as detailed
in table 1. Figure 2(a,b) show the predicted time courses for the standard (regime I: 15 mg at 7:00
followed by 10 mg at 13:00; regime II: 10 mg at 7:00 followed by 5 mg at 13:00 and 5 mg at 17:00),

and doubled regimes, which replicate a circadian-like pattern with nadir just before the first dose at
7:00, and maintained concentrations through most of the day from around 7:30 to midnight.
Motivated by the aim to replicate the adrenal response to continuous physiological stress, figure 2(c) shows the predicted time courses with 6-hourly equal doses of each of 10, 20 and 30 mg.
In all cases the low cortisol nadir is avoided.

Model limitations and discussion
The model described here is somewhat idealised and does not attempt to replicate in detail multiple
physiological compartments, heterogeneity between patients nor characteristics such as age, sex
and ethnicity: more detailed pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models (such as ref. [7]) would
give more detail and information around variability in responses. The fitted model appears to
underpredict peak responses at 10 mg and over-predicts at 50 mg, in each case by around 25%.
Oral dosing is also subject to first-pass liver metabolism, which metabolise steroids for downstream
excretion, and indeed the PACS study showed higher excretion of hydrocortisone metabolites in urine
than equivalent parenteral doses ([1], suppl. fig. 2). It is also possible that physiological response to
COVID-19, in particular body temperature, may affect rates in the system such as binding globulin
affinity [8]. Results should be interpreted with these limitations in mind.
Nevertheless, the model provides an approximation of the shape of the 24 hour time-courses
which would result from the dosing strategies considered. Dosing every 6 h clearly indicates that
an early morning nadir in cortisol can be avoided, which may be valuable for patients suffering from
the stress of viral infection.
