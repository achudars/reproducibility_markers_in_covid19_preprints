Abstract

16

Italy’s second wave of SARS-CoV-2 has hit hard, with more than 3 million cases and over 100,000 deaths,

17

representing an almost ten-fold increase on the numbers reported by August 2020. Herein, we present the

18

analysis of 6,515 SARS-CoV-2 sequences sampled in Italy between 29th January 2020 and 1st March 2021

19

and show how different lineages emerged multiple times independently despite lockdown restrictions.

20

Virus lineage B.1.177 became the dominant variant in November 2020, when cases peaked at 40,000 a day,

21

but since January 2021 this is being replaced by the B.1.1.7 ‘variant of concern’. In addition, we report a

22

sudden increase in another documented variant of concern – lineage P.1 – from December 2020 onwards,

23

most likely caused by a single introduction into Italy. We again highlight how international importations

24

drive the emergence of new lineages and that genome sequencing should remain a top priority for

25

ongoing surveillance in Italy.

COVID-19, caused by infection with severe respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has had a devastating

29

global impact, with an estimated 116 million cases and 2.5 million deaths . Of these reported infections,

30

more than 78% have occurred during the so-called ‘second wave’ of the epidemic between September

31

2020 – March 2021, greatly outnumbering the 25 million cases and ~800k deaths reported globally prior to

32

31 August 2020 . This second wave of infections is also characterised by the emergence of numerous new

33

lineages of SARS-CoV-2, three of which are commonly referred to global ‘variants of concern’ – B.1.1.7,

34

B.1.351, and P.13. The B.1.1.7 lineage was first detected in the United Kingdom in late September 20204

35

and is characterised by 17 polymorphisms across the genome including the N501Y amino acid mutation

36

and a two amino acid deletion at positions 69 and 70 of the spike protein5. The B.1.351 lineage was first

37

reported in South Africa and shares similar substitutions to B.1.1.7 including N501Y but not the 69/70

38

deletion6, while the P.1 lineage was first identified in Brazil and shares two substitutions with B.1.351 –

39

E484K and N501Y in the spike protein4. All of these lineages have seemingly replaced previous circulating

40

variants in their geographic regions and have spread to other countries in Europe, the Americas, and Asia7-

41

9

42

reduced cross-protective immunity10-12, which may also have implications for vaccine efficacy13,14. Thus,

43

increased surveillance to document and understand the spread of different SARS-CoV-2 lineages is of

44

upmost importance.

. There is also considerable concern about the possibility of reinfection with these new lineages due to

45

The first cases of SARS-CoV-2 in Italy were reported in January 2020 and the country was hit hard

46

with a peak of >6,500 cases a day in late March 2020. Italy was also the first European country to impose a

47

nation-wide lockdown from 9th March to the 18th May 2020. In retrospect, this first wave was of relatively

48

low magnitude compared to the huge number of infections reported between September 2020 and March

49

2021. Indeed, during this second wave, Italy experienced a maximum of ~40,000 cases a day in mid-

50

November 2020 (Fig. 1a), and an estimated 3.1 million cases and ~100,000 deaths have been reported to

51

date (8 March 2021) . Beginning in October 2020, a colour-coded system was established to restrict the

52

mobility of residents in each administrative region in Italy, depicting increasing the levels of restriction

53

from yellow to red. In addition, in attempt to reduce viral transmission during the holiday season, further

54

restrictions to social mobility and on possible sources of infection (schools, restaurants, etc.) were put in

We previously showed that virus importation associated with travel, followed by local
16

59

transmission, were key drivers of viral spread during the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 in Italy . After a year

60

into the pandemic, lockdown restrictions have proven effective in reducing virus transmission and limiting

61

geographic spread17, although international travel is still a major source for the introduction of new

62

lineages into Italy18. Here we show how the B.1.1.7 and P.1 variants entered Italy before the

63

implementation of border closures and that these two variants have subsequently spread rapidly across

64

the country.

Results

67

Emerging lineages in Italy

68

Our analysis included 6,515 Italian SARS-CoV-2 sequences covering a time span between 29th January

69

2020 to 1st March 2021. These comprised 103 different lineages, with B.1 (11%), B.1.1.74 (5%), B.1.1.7

70

(34%), and B.1.177 (24%) the most commonly identified. Sequence sampling was not equal between

71

North, Central, and South Italy, as a large proportion of SARS-CoV-2 sequence data from North Italy was

72

only available for the beginning of the pandemic (March – May 2020) and again the most recent months

73

(January – March 2021) (Fig.1a). Despite this, the time range of data availability overlaps between these

74

three macro areas, minimising the effect of sampling bias.

75

Lineages B.1 and B.1.1.74 both appeared in Italy during early 2020 and were replaced by lineage

76

B.1.177 during the second half of 2020 (Fig. 1b). Lineage B.1 was the first reported in all three macro areas

77

on 20 February, 24 February, and 3 March in North, Central, and South Italy, respectively. A similarly

78

narrow time period of introduction was observed for lineage B.1.1.74 which first appeared on 24

79

February, 27 February, 4 March 2020 in North, Central, and South Italy, respectively. This latter lineage

80

persisted in Central and South Italy until February 2021, although at low levels, while no sequences from

81

this lineage were sampled in North Italy after 27th May 2020. Subsequently, lineage B.1.177 emerged in

Although these data show that different lineages of SARS-CoV-2 were first reported within a short

86

time period throughout the country, we also identified region-specific sampling biases with unusual

87

abundances of sequences obtained on individual days (Supplementary Data S1). These sampling ‘peaks’

88

are most likely the result of targeted sampling after an outbreak. For example, 193 sequences were

89

sampled on 26th October 2020 alone, of which 104 were B.1.177 all sampled in the region Campania in

90

South Italy. Also, in this region, 42 B.1.1.187 sequences were sampled on 29th June 2020 alone, and which

91

represents 51% of all sequence data available for this lineage in Italy. Notably, according to GISAID, this

92

lineage has only been sampled in the UK (n=14) and Japan (n=1), and South Italy (n=81).

93
94

Lineages of global concern - B.1.1.7, P.1, and B.1.351

95

At the time of writing (8th March 2021), a total of 2,184 B.1.1.7, 109 P.1, and 8 B.1.351 sequences sampled in

96

Italy were available for analysis and had been identified in all three Italian macro areas. The B.1.1.7 lineage

97

appeared in all three areas within a five-day period, first in Central Italy (14th December) and five days later

98

in both the North and South (19th December for both lineages) (Fig. 1b). The first P.1 sequences were

99

identified on 7th January 2021 in Central Italy in travellers returning from Brazil 19. This lineage was

100
101

subsequently found on 21st January and 12th February in the North and South Italy, respectively.
Notably, the Italian B.1.1.7 sequences were distributed across the global phylogeny indicating

102

multiple independent introductions into the country (Fig. 2). In addition, we observed numerous Italian-

103

specific transmission clades (i.e. extended transmission chains), although most (n=73, 78%) were area

104

specific, the largest containing 104 infections all sampled in South Italy (Fig. 2). Of the remaining clades

105

(n=22), 82% contained infections from two and 18% from all three macro areas. For 73% (n=16) of these,

106

the clade in question comprised ≥80% of infections from a single area only and only a small number of

107

infections from a second or third macro area. For example, one clade with 64 sequence comprised 63 from

108

Central Italy, one from South Italy and none from North Italy. Similarly, another clade contained 76

infections from North Italy and one from Central Italy. In addition, we identified six clades with more inter-

110

area mixing, including one example consisting of 35 infections (10 North, 12 Central, 13 South). Notably,

111

this is the only example of prolonged transmission between macro areas for this time period (Fig. 2).

112

th

Three infections of the P.1 lineage were identified in international travellers on 18 January in

113

Central Italy. Fortunately, these did not lead to ongoing local transmission (Fig. 3). However, infections of

114

P.1 were also identified on 7th January, and which formed a distinct clade (clade I) within the P.1 global

115

phylogeny distinguished by a single T->C synonymous mutation in ORF1ab (nt 13,577 / aa 4,526 Ref

116

EPI_ISL_833137). In contrast to B.1.1.7, almost all of Italian P.1 sequences (n=104) fell within this single

117

node which also contained 10 sequences from Germany (Fig. 3). Within this clade I, 61 Italian sequences

118

(clade II) contained an additional distinct synonymous mutation in the spike gene (spike nt 3,357 / aa 1,118

119

Ref EPI_ISL_833137), and 43 of these Italian sequences (clade III) also contained a non-synonymous

120

mutation in the spike leading to an S813N mutation (spike nt 2,437 / aa 813 Ref EPI_ISL_833137). This

121

S813N mutation is located between two fusion peptides and not in the receptor binding domain where the

122

E484K and N501Y mutations are located (Supplementary Data S2). P.1. viruses with the mutation were

123

first sampled on 13th January 2021 in Central Italy and the most recent occurrence was found in an infection

124

sampled on 1st March. To date, the mutation has only been found in infections from Central and South

125

Italy. Of note, one additional sequence (EPI_ISL_1169907, Central Italy, 19-Feb) outside of both clade II

126

and III also contained this amino acid substitution (Fig. 3).

127

Finally, five of the eight B.1.351 sequences were scattered across the global phylogeny, confirming

128

that these are independent infections associated with returned travellers (30th January and 11th February in

129

North Italy n=2, 23 February in Central Italy n=1, 19 and 26 February in South Italy n=2, Supplementary

130

Data S3). However, we also found B.1.351 sequences from North Italy sampled on 11 and 13 February

131

2021 who formed a phylogenetic cluster, suggestive of some local transmission.

March 2021. First, we observed the replacement of B.1 and B.1.1.74 by B.1.177, the latter being the most

137

sampled lineage during the second wave. Second, and more notably, we observed the more recent

138

appearance of the emerging ‘variants of concern’ B.1.1.7 and P.1, with the former being the most sampled

139

lineage during January and February 2021.

140

Our phylogenetic analysis confirms extensive virus transmission within North, Central, and South

141

Italy, but only limited transmission between these regions, consistent with lockdown restrictions imposed

142

in December 2020 that prohibited travel between regions. However, the limited sequence data available

143

makes it challenging to accurately identify the directionality of transmission and lineage spread across the

144

country. Nevertheless, our data shows how different lineages appeared almost simultaneously in North,

145

Central, and South Italy (i.e., within a five-day time frame), suggesting a complex pattern of multiple

146

introductions into the different macro areas.

147

We focused our analysis on lineages B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 as these have been the subject of

148

considerable discussion and concern. In the case of B.1.351, we only found one instance of local

149

transmission in mid-February 2021, with no evidence for additional ongoing transmission. In contrast, we

150

found strong evidence for local ongoing transmission of both the B.1.1.7 and P.1 lineages, with the former

151

potentially replacing the previous dominant strain B.1.177. Of note, from 8th March 2021 onwards, B.1.1.7

152

represented on average 50% of all sequences sampled. This is compatible with observations that B.1.1.7

153

has enhanced transmissibility5 and has become the dominant variant in numerous other European

154

countries, e.g. Denmark20.

155

After Brazil, Italy contains the second highest number of P.1 infections reported to date3. This

156

variant was first reported in Manaus (Brazil), which was hit hard by the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 with an

157

estimated 76% of the population infected . Thus, the surge of P.1 in this area strongly implies the

158

possibility of re-infection . Our molecular epidemiological analysis provided strong evidence for a single

159

introduction of P.1 into Italy, followed by extensive local transmission. As expected, our phylogenetic

160

analysis depicts importation of the P.1 variant into Italy, although from a yet unknown source, followed by

161

possible onward spread from Italy to Germany. Importantly, within the Italian network we also found a

162

unique, clade defining amino acid substitution - S813N. Although the function of this mutation is currently

In conclusion, we depict the rapid emergence and replacement of new lineages in Italy despite

167

imposed lockdown restriction, suggesting that the disease management policies employed were

168

insufficient to halt the spread of emerging variants. Notably, both B.1.1.7 and P.1 spread across Italy

169

before international border closers were imposed for the UK and Brazil. This highlights the importance of a

Bars show the number of cases reported in Italy between 1st January 2020 – 1st March 2021. Horizontally
aligned circles show the number of sequences sampled for each day in North (blue), Central (yellow),
South (red) Italy. The size of the circle is equivalent to the total number of sequences (max = 256). Italian
regions are coloured according to their macro areas: blue = North (Valle d’Aosta, Piemonte, Liguria,
Lombardia, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, Friuli-Venezia-Giulia, and Trentino-Alto Adige), yellow = Central
(Lazio, Marche, Toscana, Umbria, and Abruzzo), red = South (Puglia, Basilicata, Calabria, Campania,
Molise, Sicilia, and Sardegna). b Number of sequences sampled in Italy for the lineages B.1. B.1.1.74,
B.1.177, B.1.1.7, and P.1 for North (top), Central (middle), and South (bottom) Italy. The total number of
sequences per day (circles) and the time range between first and most recent sequence (dotted line) is
shown (max = 146).

Maximum likelihood phylogeny of SARS-CoV-2 full genome sequences. Due to the large amount of data
for B.1.1.7 (>100,000 sequences), a random subset of 3,000 B.1.1.7 sequences sampled globally were
incorporated (2,900 after data cleaning). Branches are coloured according to the macro area: grey =
global, blue = North Italy, yellow = Central Italy, red = South Italy. Branch length is scaled according to the
number of nucleotide substitutions per site. Lineage B.1.351 and P.1 were used as an outgroup
(B.1.351=EPI_ISL_660190, P.1=EPI_ISL_833137). Arrows indicate examples of large Italian clades with
limited inter-region transmission. One clade with increased inter-region transmission is shown enlarged on
the right.

Maximum likelihood phylogeny of SARS-CoV-2 full genome sequences (n=503 global, n=111 Italian).
Lineage B.1.351 was used as an outgroup (EPI_ISL_660190). Branch lengths are scaled according to the
number of nucleotide substitutions per site and are coloured according to geographic macro area: grey =
global, blue = North Italy, yellow = Central Italy, red = South Italy. The node containing an T to C mutation
in ORF1ab is marked with a box. b (bottom) Enlargement of this node and additional clades and their
nucleotide or amino acid substitutions are indicated. Note, a single sequence containing also the S813N
mutation but falling outside the main clade is marked with an asterisk. Branches without a tip circle
represent sequences from Germany. (top) Schematic view of the spike protein alignment for different
reference sequences as well as the clade containing the S813N substitution. The protein structural regions
are marked: S1 NTD = N-terminal domain of the S1 subunit, S1 RBD = receptor binding domain of S1, S1S2 S2 = S1/S2 cleavage region and S2 fusion subunit. A detailed view of the protein alignment can be
found in Supplementary Data S2.
