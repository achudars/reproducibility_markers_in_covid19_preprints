Abstract

32

Purpose: Louisiana currently has the highest per capita case count for COVID-19 in the

33

United States and disproportionately affects the Black or African American population.

34

Neighborhood deprivation has been observed to be associated with poorer health

35

outcomes. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between

36

neighborhood deprivation and COVID-19 in Louisiana.

37

Methods: The Area Deprivation Index (ADI) was calculated and used to classify

38

neighborhood deprivation at the census tract level. A total of 17 US census variables

39

were used to calculate the ADI for each of the 1148 census tracts in Louisiana. The

40

data were extracted from the American Community Survey (ACS) 2018. The

41

neighborhoods were categorized into quintiles as well as low and high deprivation. The

42

publicly available COVID-19 cumulative case counts by census tract was obtained from

43

the Louisiana Department of Health website on July 31, 2020. Descriptive and Poisson

44

regression analyses were performed.

45

Results: Neighborhoods in Louisiana were substantially different with respect to

46

deprivation. The ADI ranged from 136.00 for the most deprived neighborhood and

47

–33.87 in the least deprived neighborhood. We observed that individuals residing in the

48

most deprived neighborhoods had a 45% higher risk of COVID-19 disease compared to

49

those residing in the least deprived neighborhoods.

50

Conclusion: While the majority of previous studies were focused on very limited socio-

51

environmental factors such as crowding and income, this study used a composite area-

52

based deprivation index to examine the role of neighborhood environment on COVID-

53

19. We observed a positive relationship between neighborhood deprivation and COVID-

54

19 risk in Louisiana. The study findings can be utilized to promote public health

55

preventions measures besides social distancing, wearing a mask while in public and

56

frequent handwashing in vulnerable neighborhoods with greater deprivation.

1. Introduction:
On March 09, 2020, Louisiana reported its first case of COVID-19 and soon

61

thereafter appeared to be a hot spot of the coronavirus pandemic in the US [1]. Within

62

two weeks of the initial confirmed case, the state had one of the world’s highest average

63

daily growth rate [2-4]. As of July 31, 2020, the state of Louisiana has the highest per

64

capita case count in the United States with a total of 116,280 confirmed cases and

65

3,835 deaths [2]. The incidence and mortality rates of COVID-19 has been

66

disproportionate across racial and ethnic groups [5, 6]. Specifically, non-Hispanic

67

African Americans have higher rates of incidence, hospitalization, and death from

68

COVID-19 compared to non-Hispanic Whites. In early July, the US Centers for Disease

69

Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that non-Hispanic African Americans have 4.7

70

times the rate of age-adjusted COVID-19 related hospitalization rates than non-Hispanic

71

Whites [7]. The sources of disparities in COVID-19 outcomes might be explained from a

72

social determinants of health perspective. Non-Hispanic African Americans are more

73

likely to have vulnerable and low-paying jobs that don’t allow remote work, which

74

increases risk of contracting COVID-19 [8, 9]. Furthermore, non-Hispanic African

75

Americans are more likely to rely on public transportation and to live in crowded housing

76

or work in crowded worksite that places them an increased risk for COVID-19 disease.

77

African Americans exhibit a greater burden of chronic medical conditions, such as

78

hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, chronic disease, and obesity that increase the

79

severity of COVID-19 illness [10-12]. In Louisiana, 2.9 million people have at least one

80

chronic condition, and a total of 68 percentage of Louisiana adults are overweight or

81

obese [13]. Furthermore, the poverty rate is much higher among African Americans as

82

those of non-Hispanic Whites, and are concentrated in neighborhoods with high poverty

83

[14, 15]. The neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) is linked to access to health

84

care services, people residing in low SES neighborhoods are less likely to have access

85

to health care services, which further increases the risk of adverse health outcomes

86

related to COVID-19, such as higher hospitalizations and mortality [16, 17].

87

Preliminary reports show a relationship between the neighborhood of residence

88

and COVID-19 disease, hospitalization and death [18-20]. Those who reside in deprived

89

neighborhoods, defined by low income and education, higher unemployment, and

90

substandard living conditions have a greater risk of poor health outcomes such as

91

obesity, diabetes, cancer, and heart diseases [21-23]. Higher incidence and mortality

92

from COVID-19 have been observed in low-income or deprived neighborhoods [24-26].

93

A study conducted by Bilal et al. reported a 36% higher incidence of COVID-19 in

94

deprived neighborhoods compared to less deprived neighborhoods [25]. Systemic

95

health, social, and income inequities are considered as the primary reasons that have

96

contributed to the increased risk of contracting COVID-19 in persons residing in

97

deprived neighborhoods [7, 27, 28].

98
99

Risk factors leading to COVID-19 disease, hospitalization, and mortality are not
only at the individual or biological level; neighborhood-level factors and their interactions

100

with individual-level factors are also responsible for the observed disparities. Lack of

101

access to health care, unemployment, less education, and poor housing conditions

102

significantly increase the risk of COVID-19 infection [28-31]. These determinants of

103

health can be studied collectively as neighborhood or area deprivation.

104

Socioeconomic characteristics of residential neighborhoods influence health-related

105

behaviors, conditions, and health outcomes [32, 33]. Deprived neighborhoods are

106

correlated with health risk behaviors, overcrowding, less social cohesion, and higher

107

levels of environmental pollutants, and has been identified as a critical social

108

determinant of health [34-37]. Low socioeconomic status (SES), often regarded as a

109

fundamental cause of disease, has been shown to increase the risk of COVID-19

110

because it impacts access to fundamental resources that an individual or a

111

neighborhood may require to avoid COVID-19 [24, 38].

112

Neighborhoods with a higher number of people per household or room tend to

113

have a higher rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases than neighborhoods with fewer

114

residents [25, 39, 40]. Individuals who share a room or live in overcrowded housing and

115

the use of public transportation often spread the disease rapidly as distancing

116

preventive measures are impossible to adopt.

117

In this study, we used the Area Deprivation Index (ADI) to measure

118

neighborhood deprivation. The ADI is a composite measure of neighborhood

119

socioeconomic disadvantage, created by Gopal K Singh in 2003 [41]. The ADI,

120

composed of 17 education, employment, housing-quality, and poverty census derived

121

measures, is a robust metric measuring many relevant social determinants of health

122

that may help explain the socio-biologic mechanisms of disease [41, 42]. We

123

hypothesize that deprived Louisiana neighborhoods have a higher risk of COVID-19

124

reported cases than less deprived neighborhoods. To date, few studies in the US and

125

none in Louisiana have assessed the role of social determinants of health on COVID-19

126

disease. The studies that exist are limited, examining only a couple of specific risk

127

factors, such as overcrowding and income. The use of the Area Deprivation Index (ADI)

128

in the present study includes 17 neighborhood-level factors and provides a robust

129

measure of neighborhood deprivation. The primary purpose of this paper is to

130

investigate the relationship between neighborhood deprivation and COVID-19 risk in

131

Louisiana.

132

2. Materials and methods:

133

2.1 Study Data

134

Publicly available data on cumulative COVID-19 cases by census tract was

135

obtained from the Louisiana Department of Health website on July 31, 2020 [2]. There

136

are 64 parishes (counties) and 1,148 census tracts in Louisiana. All 64 parishes have

137

reported cases of COVID-19. Because the census tract is considered a good proxy for

138

neighborhood, census tract was selected as the unit of analysis for this study.[43] We

139

extracted the American Community Survey (ACS) 2018 data for census tract level

140

measures for Louisiana [44].

141

2.2 COVID-19

142

The main outcome in this study was COVID-19 cases per 1,000 persons in

143

Louisiana census tracts as of July 31, 2020.

144

2.3 Neighborhood Deprivation

145

Neighborhood deprivation was measured by the ADI, as described by Singh in

146

2003 [41]. ADI is a validated, factor-based deprivation index that uses 17 census

147

derived measures of poverty, education, housing, and employment indicators at the

148

census tract level to classify the neighborhoods [41, 45]. More-disadvantaged

149

neighborhoods are those with a higher ADI score.

150

The census indicators used in the calculation of ADI include educational

151

distribution (percentage of the population with less than 9 years and with 12 or more

152

years of education), median family income, median home value, median gross rent,

153

median monthly mortgage, income disparity, unemployment, percent employed person

154

in white-collar occupation, percent families below poverty, percent population below

155

150% poverty threshold, single-parent household rate, homeownership rate, percent

156

household without a telephone, percent household without a motor vehicle, percent

157

occupied housing units without complete plumbing, and household crowding [41, 45].

158

Calculation of ADI score:

159

Data from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) 2018 was

160

used to calculate the ADI score. The 17 US census indicators were multiplied by the

161

Singh’s coefficients (factor weights) for all census tracts in Louisiana [41, 46].

162

The base score of each indicator was summed to get the total base score for a census

163

tract. Each census tract’s base score was standardized by dividing the difference

164

between the individual census tract base score (b) and the Louisiana census tract

165

population mean (p), by Louisiana census tract population standard deviation (𝑆𝑝 ) [46].

where j represents the jth census tract, and k is the total number of census tracts in Louisiana.

Finally, the standardized values were adjusted to a base mean of 100 and a standard deviation

169

of 20 as suggested by Knighton et al [46].

171

The details of ADI calculation and a list of variables included in the calculations can be

172

found in Knighton et al [46].

173

Based on the ADI scores, the census tracts were categorized into quintiles of

174

deprivation; they were also dichotomized as either low deprivation or high deprivation.

175

The median Louisiana ADI was used to dichotomize the census tracts. Census tracts

176

with missing values for the indicators were excluding while calculating the ADI.

177

2.3 Statistical Analysis

178

SAS 9.4 software was used for statistical analyses. Heat maps were created

179

using ArcGIS software. Mean, standard deviation, median and interquartile range (IQR)

180

of census indicators by ADI Quintiles (least deprived: Q1 and most deprived: Q5) were

181

calculated for all census tracts in Louisiana. Poisson regression analysis was performed

182

to estimate risk ratio. An offset variable was used, and the model was corrected for over

183

dispersion.

184

3. Results

185

There was a substantial difference between the ADI of the least deprived and most

186

deprived neighborhoods. The overall median (IQR) ADI for Louisiana was 104.32

187

(76.00), with the most deprived neighborhood having an ADI of 136.00, and the least

188

deprived neighborhood having an ADI of -33.87. While the median ADI of the least

Table 2 shows the median and interquartile range of census indicators that were

194

used in the calculation of ADI. The most deprived neighborhoods in Louisiana had

195

31.02% of families below poverty. Similarly, more than 15.47% of occupied housing

196

units lacked a motor vehicle. The unemployment rate was more than twice as high in

197

the deprived neighborhoods as the less deprived neighborhoods. Almost 3% of

198

households in the most deprived neighborhoods had more than one person per room.

199

Similarly, the median home value in the most deprived neighborhood was substantially

200

lower than those in the least deprived neighborhoods ($74,550 vs $273,900). These

201

results suggest that poor people with lower levels of education were clustered together

202

in Louisiana.

4. DISCUSSION

233

To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the role of neighborhood

234

deprivation on COVID-19 in Louisiana. While previous studies were limited to a very few

235

socio-environmental factors, we used a composite area-based deprivation index to

236

identify neighborhood deprivation in Louisiana, US. The ADI includes 17 US census

237

indicators and could serve as an important tool in assessing the role of the

238

neighborhood on COVID-19 disease. Our findings demonstrated the increased rate of

239

COVID-19 disease among individuals who live in the most deprived neighborhoods

240

compared to individuals residing in the least deprived neighborhoods. A New York study

241

showed higher infection rates in low-income communities in New York City [47, 48]. The

242

neighborhood or built environment can impact health status either by influencing

243

environmental quality or by influencing behaviors that impact the transmission of

244

COVID-19. One of the major factors that might have fueled the spread of COVID-19

245

disease in poor neighborhoods is likely to be overcrowded living spaces. A study

246

conducted by Emeruwa et al. observed a strong association between neighborhood

247

socioeconomic status and household crowding and COVID-19 cases in New York City

248

[48]. The odds of infection were twice as high among individuals who lived in

249

households with greater crowding (interdecile OR, 2.27 [95% CI, 1.12-4.61]). Similarly,

250

a study in California showed 3.7 times the rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases in

251

overcrowded neighborhoods compared to less crowded neighborhoods.[49] These

252

findings illustrate how the housing environment plays an important role in disease

253

254

status and overcrowded housing may explain why non-Hispanic African American and

255

Hispanic populations are at higher risk of getting COVID-19.

256

In addition to overcrowding and neighborhood-level SES, the disparities in

257

COVID-19 cases between neighborhoods might be directly related to the nature of

258

residents’ occupations, a lack of telecommunication infrastructure, use of public

259

transportation, and utility disruptions. Areas with concentrated poverty and extreme

260

racial segregation had a higher incidence of COVID-19 [5, 50, 51]. Since low-income

261

individuals often lack private vehicles, and may rely on public transportation, this in turn

262

increases the risk of contracting COVID-19. An early study in China observed a positive

263

association between the frequency of public transportation use and cumulative cases of

264

COVID-19 [52]. However, the results may not be generalizable to areas where public

265

transportation is not available, especially in rural Louisiana. In New York, Carrion et al.

266

also found higher subway ridership among individuals who reside in neighborhoods

267

where COVID-19 cases were higher [24]. Another risk factor that could potentially

268

increase the individual’s risk of contracting infection is occupation. Although many

269

individuals have been practicing social distancing by working from home, 71% of

270

American workers cannot work from home [53]. Individuals in certain blue-collar jobs

271

tend to have a higher incidence of and mortality from COVID-19 [54]. The symptomatic

272

cases of COVID-19 are easily picked up and can help prevent the spread of disease by

273

isolating themselves, however, asymptomatic cases and symptomatic individuals who

274

don’t get paid sick leave or are essential workers are likely to spread the disease more

275

rapidly. As of July 29, 2020, there were more than 100 worksite outbreaks in Louisiana

276

[2]. The majority of studies have emphasized how adversely affected by COVID-19

277

certain racial and ethnic communities are; however, these groups of people may have

278

differential exposure to the virus due to long-standing systemic health and social

279

inequalities.

280

This study has several limitations. Due to a lack of data, we were unable to

281

account for COVID-19 testing per census tract in our statistical analysis or perform a

282

time series analysis of COVID-19 case counts. Similarly, we couldn’t include the data on

283

COVID-19 testing in a deprived neighborhood and the availability of free testing clinics

284

in our analysis. This study is limited only to COVID-19 cases per 1,000 persons in

285

Louisiana census tracts, the severe outcomes such as hospitalizations including

286

Intensive Care Units (ICUs) admissions, and mortality were not assessed. Another

287

limitation is that the impact of race couldn’t be examined due to the lack of data at the

288

census tract by race.

289

A key strength of this study is the use of the ADI to characterize neighborhood

290

disadvantage. The ADI is a validated and becoming more widely used composite index

291

of neighborhood disadvantage. The ADI provides a robust method to identify and

292

classify deprived neighborhoods. The use of the most relevant social determinants of

293

health in the calculation of ADI allows for better contextualization of the neighborhood.

294

Despite these limitations, we believe that this study contributes to the literature on social

295

determinants of health and COVID-19 disease in the neighborhood by establishing the

296

relationship between the neighborhood deprivation and COVID-19 cases in Louisiana.

297

Findings may help authorities to prioritize the public health response especially by

298

increasing free testing sites and contact tracing in the targeted areas. In addition, it is

299

important to promote public health preventions measures for case isolation and

quarantine of close contacts besides social distancing, wearing a mask while in public

301

and frequent handwashing to ultimately reduce the spread of COVID-19 in the most

302

vulnerable populations.

303

5. Conclusion

304

We observed a great disparity in deprivation among Louisiana neighborhoods. We also

305

found an association between neighborhood deprivation and the COVID-19 cases per

306

1,000 persons in Louisiana. There have been many studies on how COVID-19 is

307

clustered in neighborhoods, however, future studies should explore specific

308

mechanisms behind this association.
