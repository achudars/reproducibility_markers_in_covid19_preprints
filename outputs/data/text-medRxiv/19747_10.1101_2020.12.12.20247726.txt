Abstract:

2

Background

3

Adequate patient allocation is pivotal for optimal resource management in strained

4

healthcare systems, and requires detailed knowledge of clinical and virological disease

5

trajectories.

6

Methods

7

A cohort of 168 hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients enrolled in a prospective

8

observational study at a large European tertiary care center was analyzed.

9

Results

10

Forty-four percent (71/161) of patients required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV).

11

Shorter duration of symptoms before admission (aOR 1.22 per day less, 95%CI 1.10-

12

1.37, p<0.01), age 60-69 as compared to 18-59 years (aOR 4.33, 95%CI 1.07-20.10,

13

p=0.04), and history of hypertension (aOR 5.55, 95%CI 2.00-16.82, p<0.01) were

14

associated with need for IMV. Patients on IMV had higher maximal concentrations,

15

slower decline rates, and longer shedding of SARS-CoV-2 than non-IMV patients (33

16

days, IQR 26-46.75, vs 18 days, IQR 16-46.75, respectively, p<0.01). Median duration

17

of hospitalization was 9 days (IQR 6-15.5) for non-IMV and 49.5 days (IQR 36.8-82.5)

18

for IMV-patients.

19

Conclusion

20

Our results indicate a short duration of symptoms before admission as a risk factor for

21

severe disease and different viral load kinetics in severely affected patients.

Background

2

The ongoing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)

3

pandemic places an unprecedented burden on healthcare systems worldwide. Host

4

factors predictive of severe clinical course and adverse outcome in patients with

5

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) include older age, male gender, and pre-

6

existing chronic comorbidities [1-6]. Several risk scores containing clinical

7

characteristics, laboratory assessments, and biomarkers have been proposed for

8

improved patient management and resource allocation [5, 7] .

9

Reported proportions of hospitalized patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation

10

(IMV) vary considerably between 2.3% [8] and 23.6% [2]. In-hospital case fatality rates

11

of 20-30% have been described in China, Germany, Italy, the UK, and the US [1, 6, 9-

12

11]. In Germany, shortages of inpatient beds and intensive care unit (ICU) capacity

13

were largely avoided during the first pandemic wave [12], contributing to a

14

comparatively low overall case fatality rate [1, 13].

15

Here, we report clinical characteristics, laboratory and virological parameters, clinical

16

course, and outcome of 168 COVID-19 patients included in a prospective

17

observational cohort study conducted at Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin,

18

Germany. The study was designed for deep clinical, molecular, and immunological

19

phenotyping of COVID-19 [14-18].

20

The data reflect the situation in a tertiary care referral center for the treatment of

21

patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), including veno-venous

22

extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (vvECMO) therapy at an associated certified

23

weaning center during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic, before treatment

with dexamethasone became standard of care [19]. Specific aims of this work were to

identify risk factors associated with need for IMV, to analyze viral kinetics in patients

3

with and without IMV, and to provide a comprehensive description of clinical course

and outcome.

Methods

6

Study cohort and data collection

7

Data collection was performed within the Pa-COVID-19 study, a prospective

8

observational cohort study conducted at Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin, as

9

described [14]. Adult patients admitted between March 1 and June 30 , 2020, with

10

PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included if patients or their legal

11

representatives

12

demographic data, medical history, history of present illness, symptoms, clinical

13

course, treatment, and outcomes upon enrolment and longitudinally during

14

hospitalization. The study was approved by the ethics committee of Charité –

15

Universitätsmedizin Berlin (EA2/066/20), conducted according to the Declaration of

16

Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice principles (ICH 1996) and is registered in the

17

German and WHO international clinical trials registry (DRKS00021688) [14].

18

Comorbidities were classified using the Charlson comorbidity Index (CCI) [20]. ARDS

19

was defined according to the Berlin definition of ARDS [21]. Sequential Organ Failure

20

Assessment (SOFA) score [22] was calculated from data recorded in the ICU data

21

management system. The following predefined events were assessed in all patients:

22

1) Sepsis (defined according to sepsis-3 criteria [23], 2) venous thromboembolic

23

events (VTE; pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis), 3) neurological events

(hemorrhagic/ischemic stroke, delirium, critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP), critical

2

illness myopathy (CIM), epileptic seizure, meningitis and encephalitis). Treatment was

3

unaffected by participation in the study. Patient allocation was performed according to

4

structured regional processes [24] and management of critically ill patients following

5

national and international recommendations [25, 26].

6

All laboratory assessments were carried out in accredited laboratories at Charité –

7

Universitätsmedizin Berlin. SARS-CoV-2 viral concentration was measured in

8

respiratory samples (naso- or oropharyngeal swabs) by real-time RT-PCR (32). Viral

9

concentration is given as log genome copies per swab or initial 1 mL sampling buffer.

Statistical analyses

11

Distribution of continuous variables was summarized by median and interquartile range

12

(IQR) values or mean and standard deviation (sd), as appropriate. The differences of

13

continuous variables between groups were examined by Welch’s t-test or, in absence

14

of normal distribution, by Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables were compared

15

using chi-square tests. For all analyses, complete cases were used for the respective

16

evaluation.

17

We conducted a multiple logistic regression with “need for invasive mechanical

18

ventilation” as a binary dependent variable and age, BMI, hypertension, diabetes, and

19

time between symptom onset and admission to hospital as independent variables. The

20

covariates were chosen taking into account current evidence, results from univariate

21

testing, and sample size. We performed univariate tests regarding all available patient

22

factors and association with organ support treatment, complications, and outcome.

23

Patients with therapy limitations (Do Not Intubate (DNI) or Do Not Resuscitate (DNR)

and IMV patients, and for analyses of course-of-organ support and mortality. Non-

2

survivors were excluded from comparison between short- (< 15 days) or long-term (≥

3

15 days) IMV. For analysis of SOFA score, the highest score per day was included for

4

calculation of means. The neurological component of the SOFA score was not taken

5

into consideration due to patient sedation. Patients who died or were transferred to

6

other centers were excluded from calculation of length of hospital stay. For analyses

7

of routine laboratory parameters within 72 hours of first admission, first-available

8

parameters were included.

9

We compared viral concentration between non-IMV and IMV patients, and regressed

10

viral concentration on the duration from symptom onset to admission using both the

11

first positive RT-PCR result and the RT-PCR with the highest viral concentration. For

12

the calculation of viral concentration decline, we estimated the slope parameter from a

13

linear regression of at least four viral concentration measurements over time for each

14

patient. If available, the first of at least two final negative RT-PCR results was included,

15

in which case the viral concentration of the negative RT-PCR was set to 2.0 in

16

accordance with the RT-PCR limit of detection and sample dilution factor of ~20 [27,

17

28]. We calculated shedding duration as the time from symptom onset to the date of

18

the first of at least two final negative RT-PCR results.

19

Analyses were conducted with R (version 3.6.1) [29], JMP (version 14.2.0) [30], and

20

statsmodels (version 0.12.0) in Python 3.7.9 [31]. A p-value <0.05 indicates statistical

21

significance, although all results have to be considered as non-confirmatory. For this

22

reason, no adjustment for multiple testing was done.

Baseline characteristics

3

Between March 1 and June 30 2020, a total of 347 adult patients with COVID-19 were

4

hospitalized at Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin. This analysis includes 168 adult

5

patients who consented to participation in the prospective observational study (Figure

6

1). Sixty-five percent (110/168) were directly admitted to our center, whereas 29.8%

7

(50/168) were referred due to ARDS or other conditions requiring tertiary care. Four

8

percent (7/168) were hospitalized for other reasons and coincidentally diagnosed with

9

SARS-CoV-2 infection during routine screening, and one patient (0.6%) was admitted

st

th

10

due to a late complication of COVID-19.

11

Baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1. Median patient age was 61 years (IQR

12

49.3-72), and 66.1% (111/168) were male. Median CCI was 3 (IQR 1-4). Most

13

prevalent comorbidities were hypertension (53.6%, 90/168), diabetes (19.6%, 33/168),

14

and chronic pulmonary disease (16.7%, 28/168). Median time from symptom onset

15

until diagnosis was 4 days (IQR 1-7), and from symptom onset until admission to

16

hospital was 6 days (IQR 3-10).

17

ARDS and organ support treatment

18

Fifty-two percent (88/168) of patients developed ARDS. One of them was already

19

dependent on long-term intermittent invasive ventilation and six had DNI orders in

20

place. Of the remaining 81 patients with ARDS, 87.6% (71/81) required IMV whereas

21

12.3% (10/81) could be managed with HFNC oxygen only (Figure 1). Median time

22

from hospital admission to intubation was 2 days (IQR 0-4). Among all patients without

23

therapeutic limitations, 44.1% (71/161) required IMV, 9.9% (16/161) could be treated

with HFNC oxygen only, 24.2% (39/161) required oxygen via nasal prongs, and 22%

2

(35/161) were not in need of supplemental oxygen.

3

Age between 60 and 69 years as compared to 18 to 59 years (adjusted OR 4.33, 95%

4

CI 1.07-20.10, p=0.05) and pre-existing hypertension (adjusted OR 5.55, 95% CI 2.00-

5

16.82, p<0.01) were independent risk factors for IMV requirement in multivariable

6

analysis. Requirement for IMV increased with shorter duration of symptoms before

7

hospital admission (adjusted OR 1.22 per day less, 95% CI 1.10-1.37, p<0.01, Table

8

1).

9

Seventy-nine percent (56/71) of all intubated patients required long IMV. Need for long

10

IMV was associated with a short (≤1 day) duration from admission until intubation

11

(20.0% (3/15) of patients with short IMV vs 53.6% (30/56) patients with long IMV,

12

unadjusted OR (uOR) 4.6, 95% CI 1.17-18.16, p=0.02). Other factors associated with

13

long IMV were transferral from other centers (28.6% (4/14) of patients with short IMV

14

were transferred vs 69.6% (39/56) of patients with long IMV, uOR 5.73, 95% CI: 1.58-

15

20.87, p<0.01), a higher total mean SOFA score during the second week after initial

16

admission (8.4, 95% CI 5.83-10.9 in patients with short IMV vs 11.2, 95% CI 10.1-12.3,

17

p<0.05 in patients with long IMV) as well as differences in SOFA score components

18

(coagulation, hepatic impairment; for details see Supplementary table 1.)

19

IMV patients had a significantly higher risk of death from COVID-19 compared to non-

20

IMV patients (1.1% (1/90) of non-IMV patients died vs 29.6% (21/71) of IMV patients,

21

uOR 37.38, 95% CI 4.88-286.26, p<0.01). Sixty-three percent (44/70) of IMV patients

22

underwent tracheotomy at a median time of 15 days (IQR 12-20) from intubation.

23

Weaning from IMV was successfully concluded in 76.0% (38/50) of surviving IMV

24

patients after a median of 42 days (IQR 16-66) from intubation. Eighteen percent (9/50)

of patients remained dependent on intermittent IMV and 6.0% (3/50) on long-term

2

oxygen therapy (LTOT) upon discharge or transferral.

3

Thirty-one percent (22/71) of all IMV patients required vvECMO (hereafter termed

4

“ECMO”) treatment. ECMO was initiated a median of nine days (IQR 5.3-18.5) from

5

intubation and continued for a median of 18 days (IQR 7.8-35.5). All ECMO patients

6

required hemodialysis, 86.4% (19/22) underwent tracheotomy, 50% (11/22) had a

7

VTE, and 50% (11/22) died. Seventy-five percent (53/71) of all patients with IMV and

8

all (22/22) patients on ECMO received proning therapy. Details of the subgroup of

9

patients receiving proning therapy have been reported elsewhere [32].

10

Hemodialysis was initiated in 30.4% (51/168) of patients, and in 66.2% (47/71) of

11

patients with IMV. Hemodialysis was initiated after a median of eight days (IQR 4.5-14

result) from the day of symptom onset (or 10 days from first admission, if the date of

22

symptom onset was not available) to the end of hospitalization, with tests performed

23

every 8.4 days on average (sd: 8.8). Eighty-six patients had two final negative RT-PCR

9

(median 33, IQR 26-46.75 vs 18 days, IQR 16-46.75, p=<0.01). We found no

requiring long versus short IMV (Supplementary figure 3A-D, Supplementary table

(IQR 8-21) from hospital admission and 11.5 days (IQR 3-18.3 days) from intubation.

2

In 15/31 (48.4%) of patients with sepsis, ECMO was initiated during or soon after

3

occurrence of sepsis (median time from occurrence of sepsis and initiation of ECMO,

4

0 days, IQR 0-6.25 days).

5

Nineteen percent (32/168) of patients were diagnosed with at least one VTE. Due to

6

evidence for increased risk of thromboembolic events in COVID-19 (36), therapeutic

7

anticoagulation was introduced in all critically ill patients from April 2020. A quarter of

8

VTEs (8/32) occurred without anticoagulatory treatment, 18.8% (6/32) under

9

prophylactic anticoagulation, and 46% (15/32) under therapeutic anticoagulation. In

10

9.3% (3/32) of patients, VTE was diagnosed at autopsy and anticoagulation status at

11

onset was unclear.

12

Twenty-four percent of patients (41/168) had at least one neurologic event during

13

hospitalization, including hemorrhagic stroke (9/41, 22%), ischemic stroke (3/41,

14

7.3%), delirium (17/41, 41.5%), CIP/CIM (17/41, 41.5%), and epileptic seizure (3/41,

Outcome

18

Median time of hospital stay was 14 days (IQR 7-35) for all, 9 days (IQR 6-15.5) for

19

non-IMV, and 49.5 days (IQR 36.8-82.5) for IMV patients.

20

Seventeen percent (29/168) of all patients died. Of all patients without therapy

21

limitations (DNR/DNI), 13.6% (22/161) died, 8.7% (14/161) were transferred to other

22

centers, and 77.6% (125/161) were discharged. Median time from first hospitalization

23

until death was 33 days (IQR 16-98).

Discussion

12

We analyzed a detailed clinical and virological dataset from a prospective

13

observational cohort of COVID-19 patients hospitalized in a tertiary, ECMO/ARDS

14

referral and weaning center in Germany during the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2

15

pandemic, before dexamethasone became standard of care. One of our major findings

16

is that rapid clinical deterioration – as reflected by short duration of symptoms before

17

hospital admission – is a highly relevant risk factor for both need of IMV in a

18

multivariable risk model and death in univariate analyses in our cohort.

19

A shorter duration of symptoms was not associated with higher initial viral

20

concentration. There was also no difference in initial viral concentration in more

21

severely ill patients, i.e., those requiring IMV, compared to mildly ill patients. Yet, we

22

found a significant increase of inflammatory markers such as CRP, PCT, and IL-6 at

23

presentation and over time in IMV compared to non-IMV patients. Moreover, IMV

1

patients had higher maximal concentrations, a slower decline as well as longer duration

2

of shedding of SARS-CoV-2 compared to non-IMV patients. Higher maximal viral

3

concentrations were also found in patients who died, compared to survivors.

4

Our findings underline that the early inflammatory host response to SARS-CoV-2

5

determines the course of disease more than pathogen factors such as initial SARS-

6

CoV-2 RNA concentration [2, 39-41]. A short duration of symptoms before admission

7

possibly reflects a rapid increase of the level of inflammation and might serve as an

8

easy to assess risk factor for clinical deterioration [42]. During the further course of

9

COVID-19, severe disease is characterized by the inability to rapidly reduce viral

10

particles. A possible explanation for this phenotype – rapid deterioration after symptom

11

onset, high inflammatory markers, and lack of efficient clearing of viral particles – might

12

be the various kinds of immune dysregulation, as reported by our group and others

13

[17,

14

Conflicting results have been published regarding the association between clinical

15

severity and viral concentration for SARS-CoV-2 so far [33-38]. This could possibly be

16

explained by a rather unbalanced proportion of mildly and severely affected patients in

17

the respective studies as compared to our cohort [38]. However, it is undetermined

18

whether higher maximal viral concentration and longer duration of shedding are a

19

possible cause or an indicator of more severe organ damage and disease.

20

Regarding invasive treatment methods and complications, although it is difficult to

21

separate cause from effect, onset of sepsis before or around the time of initiation of

22

ECMO may indicate that sepsis drives clinical deterioration rather than ECMO driving

23

sepsis, a topic requiring further investigation. In line with this, sepsis was a strong risk

24

factor for death in our study.

1

Although a remarkable proportion (29.8%) of patients were transferred to our center

2

due to severe ARDS, and overall 44.1% needed IMV, we report a comparatively low

3

in-hospital mortality of 13.6% in patients without limitations of therapy. In comparison,

4

Karagiannadis et al. reported in-hospital mortality of 22.2% [1] and Rieg et al. of 23.9%

5

[45] in cohorts with 17.2% [1] and 32.9% [45] ventilated patients, respectively. Of note,

6

our data show a high median length of hospital stay of 49.5 days for patients requiring

7

IMV. By comparison, the median length of hospital stay for non-COVID ARDS patients

8

was 17 days in a recent global multi-center prospective study [46]. There is growing

9

evidence that the length of IMV-, ICU-, and inpatient treatment of patients with COVID-

10

19 ARDS exceeds that of patients with ARDS unrelated to COVID-19 [42, 45].

11

Despite the long median duration of hospital stay, a considerable percentage of

12

patients could not successfully be weaned off the ventilator (18%), and 6% required

13

ongoing oxygen therapy following discharge. The mere number of deceased patients

14

therefore depicts the burden of disease of COVID-19 only very incompletely,

15

particularly with respect to long-term morbidity. The prospective approach of our study

16

will allow us to evaluate long-term complications in the aftermath of COVID-19.

17

Prospective observational studies are often hampered by selection of patients with

18

relatively mild disease courses due to need for informed consent. In our study, a

19

deferred-consent model was applied, allowing for inclusion of critically ill patients. The

20

high proportion of severely affected patients indicates that this selection bias does not

21

apply to our data. On the other hand, one fifth of patients were only mildly affected and

22

did not require oxygen therapy, representing a sub-cohort admitted for clinical

23

observation or due to lacking the possibility of self-isolation.

1

In conclusion, we report a short duration of symptoms before clinical deterioration as

2

a risk-factor for severe COVID-19, a finding that merits further exploration as an easily

3

assessable prognostic factor. Second, we show that severely ill patients have higher

4

maximal viral concentrations and a slower decline of viral concentration compared to

5

mildly-affected patients. Third, our results demonstrate a comparatively long duration

6

of inpatient treatment for patients with IMV, largely exceeding that described for non-

7

COVID-19 ARDS patients. Our data give a comprehensive description of the clinical

8

course, virological characteristics, organ support treatment, complications, and

9

outcome of a representative cohort of patients in an unrestricted tertiary care

10

healthcare setting with comparatively low mortality. The reported findings will be of

11

value for both scientific progress in the fight against SARS-CoV-2 as well as for clinical

12

management of critical care and weaning resources in the ongoing pandemic.
