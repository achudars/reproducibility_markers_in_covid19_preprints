Abstract 200 —(max. 200; structured)
Objective: To investigate COVID-19 epidemiology in Alberta, British Columbia and Ontario, Canada.
Methods: We calculated the incidence rate ratio (January 1—July 6, 2020) between the 3 provinces, and
estimated time-varying reproduction number, Rt, starting from March 1, using EpiEstim package in R.
Results: Using British Columbia as a reference, the incidence rate ratios in Alberta and Ontario are 3.1
and 4.3 among females, and 3.4 and 4.0 among males. In Ontario, Rt fluctuated ~1 in March, reached
values >1 in early and mid-April, then dropped <1 in late April and early May. Rt rose to ~1 in mid-May
and then remained <1 from late May through early July. In British Columbia, Rt dropped <1 in early
April, but it increased towards the end of April. Rt <1 in May while it fluctuated around 1.0 in June and
early July. In Alberta, Rt > 1 in March; Rt dropped in early April and rose again in late April. In much of
May, Rt <1, but Rt increases in early June and fluctuates ~1 since mid-June.
Conclusions: Rt wavering around 1.0 indicated that three provinces of Canada have managed to achieve
limited onward transmission of SARS-CoV-2 as of early July 2020.

Introduction
In 2020, the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory
syndrome virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), spread across Canada. The first imported case was presented in a
Toronto hospital on January 23. 2020.1,2 On March 13, Quebec was the first province to declare a public
health emergency;3 four days later, Alberta, British Columbia and Ontario also declared public health
emergencies (Table S1).4 As of July 10, a cumulative total of 107,126 cases, including 8759 deaths, have
been reported in Canada.5 As seen in the Canadian government’s outbreak update,6,7 the national
epidemic trajectory appears to have stabilized in early July, but spatial-temporal pattern displays
substantial heterogeneity across provinces.
Epidemiologists have explored various aspects of the pandemic in Canada, including data availability,8
syndromic surveillance,9 disease burden and mortality,10 as well as the epidemiology in specific settings
or subpopulations, such as nursing homes,11 and intensive care units.12 Mathematical modelers have also
made projections of epidemic trajectories to assist Ottawa and the provincial governments in their
decision-making.7,13-16 Against the backdrop of recent literature, our study provides a unique perspective
by estimating and interpreting the time-varying reproduction number, Rt, of SARS-CoV-2 at both
provincial and subprovincial levels in 3 Canadian provinces.
This study described the COVID-19 pandemic as it unfolded in Alberta, British Columbia, and Ontario.
Our objectives are to compare COVID-19 incidence rates from January 1 to July 6, 2020, and to estimate
the time-varying reproduction number, Rt, of SARS-CoV-2 since the beginning of March 2020.
Methods
Scope and data sources. We investigated the descriptive epidemiology and the Rt of SARS-CoV-2 in
Alberta, British Columbia, and Ontario, and their public health subdivisions, using publicly available line
lists of COVID-19 case data downloaded from provincial government websites. Alberta, British

Columbia, and Ontario were chosen for this analysis given their line list data availability. These datasets
contained no personal identifiers to protect patients’ privacy. Population data by age and sex for Alberta,
British Columbia and Ontario was downloaded from Alberta government website.17 At the time of our
study, Quebec has not yet made the line list of cases publicly available and was not included herein. As of
early July, the cumulative number of cases in the other provinces were relatively small and therefore
those provinces were not included. The Canadian government’s national line list dataset provided the
accurate episode time in epidemiologic weeks instead of dates, and thus could not be analyzed using our
method here. All the subprovincial incidence curves and Rt trajectories were presented in the
Supplementary Materials.
Timeframe. The timeframe of this study started on January 1, 2020 (the accurate episode date of the
earliest confirmed case in Ontario) and ended on July 5 (Alberta and Ontario) or 6 (British Columbia), the
last episode date or reported date in each of our datasets. This timeframe is characterized by importation
of cases from overseas followed by community transmission while social distancing measures were
gradually introduced. March 17 was the day when the public health emergency was declared in Alberta,
British Columbia and Ontario.4 By early July, some mandatory social distancing measures remain
implemented therein.
The timeframe for Rt estimation began with March 1. We did not estimate Rt in January and February
because the small number of cases in Ontario and British Columbia during that time would lead to very
uncertain Rt estimates. No cases were reported in Alberta before March.
Ontario dataset. The Ontario dataset included cases until the end of July 5, 2020 and was downloaded on
July 6, 2020, at 5.34pm (EDT).18 In Ontario, the subprovincial unit is a Public Health Unit (PHU). The
Ontario dataset contained the following variables: accurate episode date, case reported date, test reported
date, specimen date, age group, gender, case acquisition information, clinical outcome, outbreak-related
(yes or no), reporting PHU, and the address, city, postal code, website, latitude and longitude of the
reporting PHU.

In contrast to the Alberta and British Columbia datasets, which did not contain information on how the
case-patients acquired the virus, the Ontario dataset provided information on how a case-patient acquired
the virus (“Case Acquisition Info”): 1761 travel-related cases, 10839 “close contact” cases, 6687 cases
with “no epi-link”, 14259 outbreak-related cases, 1120 cases with “no info-missing” and 1280 cases with
“no info-unknown”. In our Rt estimation, we categorized all travel-related cases as “imported” cases and
all others as “local” as per user instructions for the EpiEstim package. Please note that to run the EpiEstim
package, the first case(s) on the first day of a time series must be rendered as “imported” cases. Thus, if
the first case(s) of a time series was not travel-related, we manually denoted them as “imported” cases so
that Rt can be estimated using the EpiEstim package.
Alberta dataset. The Alberta dataset included cases until the end of July 5, 2020 and was downloaded on
July 7, 2020 at 7.59am (Eastern Daylight Time, EDT).19 In Alberta, each subprovincial unit is a Health
Services Zone. The Alberta dataset contained the following variables: date of report, health services zone,
gender, age group, case status (clinical outcome) and case type (confirmed or probable). The Alberta
dataset contained 7678 confirmed cases and 711 probable cases; both types are included in the main
analysis. In the sensitivity analysis, only confirmed cases were analyzed.
British Columbia dataset. The British Columbia dataset included cases until July 6, 2020 and was
downloaded on July 7 at 8.01am (EDT).20 In British Columbia, each subprovincial unit is a Health
Authority. The British Columbia dataset contained the following variables: date of report, health
authorities, sex, age group and classification reported (“Epi-linked” versus laboratory-diagnosed). The
British Columbia dataset contained 2970 laboratory-diagnosed cases (aka confirmed cases) and 8 “epilinked” cases (aka probable cases); both are included in the main analysis. In the sensitivity analysis, only
laboratory-diagnosed cases were analyzed.
Incidence rate ratio. The incidence rate was calculated by dividing the cumulative number of cases in a
province by its total population in 2019. Given that the timeframe of our datasets is essentially the same
(with only a difference in 1 day), we did not use person-time as the denominator. We used British

Columbia as the reference, and calculate the incidence rate ratio (IRR) of Alberta and that of Ontario. We
did not calculate the 95% confidence interval for the estimates, because the estimates were true
population estimates and not sample estimates, as we used data from province-wide surveillance systems
that cover everyone in the province.
Case fatality ratio. We limited our analysis to individuals whose clinical outcomes are known (either
deaths or recovered), and used the following simple estimator to obtain an approximation of the case
fatality ratio: case fatality ratio = number of deaths / (number of deaths + number of recovered).21
Time-varying reproduction number. In contrast with the basic reproduction number, R0, which represents
the average number of secondary cases generated by an infectious individual in a totally susceptible
population in the absence of interventions or behavioral changes, Rt is a time-varying indicator which
represents the average number of secondary cases per infectious individual in a population as the
epidemic unfolds in the presence of interventions and behavioral changes. Rt >1 indicates sustained
transmission and epidemic growth; Rt <1 indicates unsustainable transmission and epidemic decline. As
the epidemic runs its course, it is possible to quantify Rt over time after accounting for reductions in
susceptibility in the population as more people acquire immunity through natural infection, behavior
changes in the population, and interventions that mitigate the transmission rate.22
Instantaneous reproduction number method implemented in R package EpiEstim. There are multiple
statistical methods available for Rt estimation,23,24 one of which is the instantaneous reproduction number
method implemented in the R package EpiEstim.25,26 This method is considered to be well-suited to nearreal-time estimation of Rt, and is sensitive to signals of changes in transmission potential given recent
implementation and cessation of interventions or behavioral changes.23 This method has been applied in
various studies to estimate the Rt of SARS-CoV-2 in different locations globally.27-34 A summary of the
instantaneous reproduction number method is provided in the Online Supplementary Materials.

Software version. Data management and analysis (except for maps) was performed using Microsoft Excel
and R version 3.6.2 (R Core Team, Vienna, Austria). Version 2.2-3 of the EpiEstim package was used.
Maps were made in R version 3.5.1 (R Core Team, Vienna, Austria).
Ethics. The Georgia Southern University Institutional Review Board made a non–human subjects
determination for this project (H20364), under the G8 exemption category.
Results
The dates of the first cases and the total number of cases in our datasets by each subprovincial public
health unit in Alberta, British Columbia and Ontario are presented in Table S2.
Incidence rate ratio and case-fatality ratio at the provincial level. Table S3 presents the number of cases
per 100,000 population, stratified by sex/gender and age groups (see Tables S4-S6 for details).
Interestingly, the incidence rates in Alberta and Ontario were higher than those in British Columbia,
which served as the reference group. Among females, the respective IRR in Alberta and Ontario were 3.1
(187.3/59.9) and 4.3 (259.9/59.9). Among males, the respective IRR in Alberta and Ontario were 3.4
(196.2/57.2) and 4.0 (196.2/57.2). This may reflect a more aggressive testing strategy in Alberta and
Ontario. As of July 11, 2020, Alberta and Ontario had the highest rate of testing in Canada (102,299 and
110,612 tests per million population, respectively) whereas in British Columbia the rate was only 36,059
tests per million population.6 In both provinces, anyone who feels needing a test, including asymptomatic
individuals, can get a test without referral. For example, Ontario waived the requirement to get a referral
to qualify for testing on May 24, 2020, and increased testing capacity to over 20,000 a day.35 Likewise,
Alberta started testing asymptomatic cases around mid-May. The alternative hypothesis was that this
might reflect a genuine difference across the 3 provinces in their epidemiology of COVID-19. Tables S7
and S8 present the clinical outcomes of cases in Alberta and Ontario. As expected, the elderly has a high
case-fatality ratio than other age groups, as described in a recent study by Bignami and Van Assche,10 and

this is similar to observations in other parts of the world, such as England.36 Likewise, as in other
countries, there had been outbreaks in long-term care facilities in Canada.11,37,38
Epidemic curve and Rt.
The accurate episode date of the first two cases in Ontario was January 1, 2020, one without epi-link and
one being a close contact. The “no epi-link” case was a male in his 80s whose specimen date was April 23
and whose test result was reported on April 24 (case reported on the same date). The “close contact” case
was a male in his 50s whose specimen date was May 15 and whose test result was reported on May 17
(case reported on the same date). A third case was a male in his 50s whose accurate episode date was
January 10 and was a “close contact” case but whose specimen was taken on June 9 (test reported and
case reported on the next day). This cluster of 3 cases had episode dates before the first two reported cases
in Ontario (date of report: January 23, 2020) whose accurate episode dates were January 21 and 22
respectively.1,2 In Ontario (Figure 1), Rt fluctuated around 1 in March, rose to >1 but <1.25 in early and
mid-April, then dropped <1 in late April and early May. Rt rose to ~1 in mid-May and then remained <1
from late May through early July.
A map showing the cumulative number of cases over time by PHU in Ontario is presented in Figure 2,
and a similar map showing the cumulative number of deaths is in Figure S1. Epidemic trajectories in
selected PHUs are as follows. In City of Toronto PHU (Figure S2) and its neighbors, namely, Durham
Regional PHU (Figure S3), Peel Regional PHU (Figure S4), and York Regional PHU (Figure S5), we
observed similar tragectories: Rt ≥1 in sustained period of time from late March to mid-April. Rt subsided
to <1 in late April and early May but rose to ~1 in mid-May. Rt decreased to <1 consistently in early June
but it was on an increasing trend towards early July. Slightly further away from Toronto, in Halton
Regional PHU (Figure S6), Rt fluctuates around 1 through the study period. It was <1 in much of June. In
City of Hamilton PHU (Figure S7), Rt fluctuates around 1 through the timeframe of this study, except for
mid-May when Rt reached a peak of 2 (1-window estimate). In Region of Waterloo PHU (Figure S8), Rt
fluctuates around 1 in March but increases steadily to >1 in mid-April, followed by a continuous drop to

<1, until late May when Rt rebounded to around 1 in June. In Niagara Region PHU (Figure S9), Rt
fluctuates around 1 across the timeframe of this study, except for late May when there was a surge in
cases leading to Rt >1 in late May followed by a trough <1 in June. In Ottawa PHU (Figure S10), Rt was
<1 in late March but it increased to slightly >1 in April. It maintained <1 in much of May and fluctuates
around 1 in June. For the other PHUs from Algoma PHU to Windsor-Essex County Health PHU, see
Figures S11 to S35.
The first case in British Columbia was reported by Vancouver Coastal Health Authority on January 26,
2020. In British Columbia, Rt dropped below 1 the first time in early April, but it increased towards the
end of April. For most of May, Rt <1 while it fluctuated around 1 in June and early July (Figure 3). Figure
4 is a map showing the cumulative number of cases in British Columbia by Health Authority over time.
Below are epidemic trajectories in selected Health Authorities. In Vancouver Coastal Health Authority
(Figure S36), Rt was ~2 in mid-March and dropped to 1 by April and below <1 in mid-April but increased
in late April to ~1. It fluctuates <1 for much for May but rose to ~2 in mid-June, followed by fluctuation
around 1 in late June and early July. In Fraser Health Authority (Figure S37), Rt fluctuated between 1.5
and 2 in mid-March before dropping to ~1 through April. In May it fluctuated <1 but increased to 1 and
fluctuated around 1 in June and early July. For Interior, Northern and Vancouver Island Health
Authorities, see Figure S38 to S40. As a sensitivity analysis we analyzed the data excluding 8 probable
cases (“epi-linked cases”) (Table S9); focusing at the 2970 confirmed cases, the results in Rt are similar
(Figure S41).
The first case in Alberta was reported in Calgary Zone on March 6, 2020. In Alberta, Rt > 1 in March,
corresponding to reaching a peak in incidence in late March and early April. A small dip in Rt happened
in early April and Rt rose again in late April, as the incidence increased and reached a peak in late April.
In much of May, Rt <1, but Rt increases in early June and fluctuates around 1 (slightly above 1) since midJune (Figure 5). Figure 6 is a map showing the cumulative number of cases in Alberta by Health Services
Zone over time, while Figure S42 is a similar map showing the cumulative number of deaths. Below are

epidemic trajectories in selected Health Services Zones. In Calgary Zone (Figure S43), Rt began at ~2 in
mid-March and dropped to ~1 in early April and rose again to ~1.5 and maintained >1 in the second half
of April. In May and early July, Rt was <1, but increased to ~1 from mid-June through early July. In
Edmonton Zone (Figure S44), it fluctuates around 1.5 in late March, dropped to 1 in early April and <1 in
mid-April. Rt rose to ~1 in late April and then maintained at a <1 level for much of May. Rt increased to
~2 in late May and early June, and then gradually dropped to ~1 in early July. In South Zone (Figure
S45), Rt fluctuated around 1 in late March and early April and rose to ~3 in the second half of April as
there was an outbreak from mid-April to early May. Rt below <1 in much of May and fluctuated around 1
in much of June and made a sharp increase to ~2 in early July. For Central and North Zones, see Figures
S46 and S47. As a sensitivity analysis we analyzed the data excluding 711 probable cases; focusing at
7678 confirmed cases only, the results in Rt are similar (Figure S48).
Specimen collection date in Ontario dataset. Among the 35948 case-patients in Ontario, the median
delay in specimen collection for testing is 1 day after symptom onset (accurate episode date), with an
interquartile range from 0 to 5 days. A decrease over time in the average time difference between date of
symptom onset and the date of specimen taken, and the variance of that time difference (Figure 7 Panel a)
represents the improvement in the testing capacity allowing individuals to get tested promptly after
symptom onset. As seen in Figure 4a, the delay on March 1 would be 7.4 days and the delay was close to
0 around June 21. See Appendix for details of the regression model. The longest time difference (an
outlier) was a delay of 151 days (that might suggest that these were serological tests and not polymerase
chain reaction tests,39 but the dataset do not provide further details). A total of 305 (0.8%) individuals do
not have specimen dates. There were 2391 (6.7%) whose specimens were collected prior to date of
symptom onset, i.e. (accurate episode date – specimen date) < 0. Of these 2391 individuals, 926, 766, 397
and 302 individuals developed symptom 1, 2, 3 or ≥4 days, respectively, after having specimen taken for
testing (Table S10). Most of these 2391 case-patients were outbreak-related (n=1473) or close contacts of
cases (n=619), while 28 were travel-related. However, 211 of them did not have any epi-link, and 24 and

36 were without case acquisition info (“missing” or “unknown” respectively) (Table S11). This is not
surprising, since Ontario enhanced testing capacity for testing asymptomatic people at risk of exposure.
Of these 2391 individuals whose specimens taken prior to symptom onset, except for 8 who did not have
a test report date, 1463 (61%) had their tests reported the same day as their symptom onset; 307 (13%), 1
day after symptom onset, 385 (16%), ≥2 days later, and 228 (9.5%) had their test reported before
symptom onset (Table S10). Of these 2391 individuals, 1641 (69%) had their case reported the day they
developed symptoms, 337 (14%) on the next day of symptom onset, 413 (17%), ≥2 days after symptom
onset (Table S10).
Delay in test report and case report in Ontario dataset. The delay in test report decreased over time. On
March 1, the delay was approximately 11 days, while on July 5, it was about 1 day (Figure S49). The
delay in case report has also decreased over time. On March 1, the delay was approximately 10 days,
while on July 5, it was about 1 day (Figure 7 panel b). See Appendix for details of the regression models.

Discussion
Alberta, British Columbia and Ontario, Canada, appeared to have managed to achieve limited
transmission of SARS-CoV-2 with Rt~1 at the time of writing in early July 2020 (Figures 1, 3, 5), through
a combination of multiple interventions, including community social distancing, increased testing of
individuals at higher risk or suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and isolation of COVID-19 cases.
Canada’s experience with SARS epidemic in 2003 may have contributed to the coordinated government’s
response in COVID-19. The 2003 SARS epidemic in Canada resulted in a set of recommendations to
federal, provincial, and territorial leader, and in particular, led to the creation of the Public Health Agency
of Canada which has been leading the response to COVID-19.40
Our results show that since mid-March in the 3 Canadian provinces under study, SARS-CoV-2 has been
spreading with an Rt <2 that is smaller than the estimated R0 of >2.41,42 For the majority of the time period

under study, Rt fluctuated around 1. Our analysis of the COVID-19 epidemic by Canadian subprovincial
units present a similar picture as our province-level analysis with few exceptions. Nowhere in Canada
experienced the trauma that residents in Wuhan, Milan and New York City had experienced. While
Canadian provinces have substantial administrative authority over COVID-19 response, the federal and
provincial government have collaborated to produce a coordinated response to the pandemic, as
evidenced by the similar COVID-19 response measures in the three provinces, as well as the united
politicians’ communications on the nature and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the necessity of
social distancing across the different Canadian political parties.43 As the three provinces began reopening
businesses, services, and public spaces, all three provinces have been gradually relaunching by stages
which depended on local infection rate and the capacity of the healthcare system. 44-46
Our study has several limitations. First, our Rt estimation for Alberta and British Columbia relied on data
by reporting date and not date of onset, as the latter was unavailable to us. Only Ontario provided the
accurate episode date. Future research can study the epidemic data by date of onset when it is available to
researchers to better estimate Rt. Second, the number of reported cases per day in the Alberta and British
Columbia datasets would be influenced by the testing rate, since limited testing capacity could lead to
underdiagnosis. We did not attempt to do a nationwide analysis for Canada because the testing criteria has
not been consistent across Canadian provinces. Third, our estimates are contingent that the testing ratio
does not change significantly over the study period. However, provincial governments might have been
ramping out testing capacity during the early epidemic phase in their jurisdiction. Fourth, reporting delays
are known to vary over time and could influence the observed trajectory of the epidemics by date of
report in Alberta and British Columbia. For Ontario, our results showed that the delay to testing has been
reduced over time and Ontario achieved testing on the same or next date since symptom onset in June. It
is possible that similar improvement in reduction in testing delay may have happened in Alberta and
British Columbia, but we do not have such data. Fifth, improvement in testing over time could potentially
reduce generation time over time. As we do not have data on infector-infectee pairs, we cannot estimate if

serial interval has changed over time. In our Rt estimation, our serial interval distribution is parametrically
determined a priori based on the literature.47 Sixth, the Ontario dataset is by date of symptom onset and
therefore the most recent data points may be lower than what they should have been, because there could
be cases who had not yet been reported to the provincial government. Thus, the low Rt estimate for
Ontario in the 1st week of July may be an artifact due to right-censoring of the data. Seventh, we obtained
an approximation of the case-fatality ratio using a simple estimator by restricting the analysis to cases
with known outcomes. There are estimation methods that are more statistically advanced,21,48,49 but they
are less accessible to practitioners of applied epidemiology and they are beyond the scope of this paper.
Conclusions
In conclusion, Alberta, British Columbia, and Ontario managed to keep the Rt of SARS-CoV-2 wavering
around 1, with our recent estimates indicating sporadic episodes of sustained transmission in Alberta and
British Columbia where Rt fluctuates around 1 or slightly >1 in the first week of July. In Ontario, Rt may
have been suppressed <1 in early July. Sustained social distancing interventions and further limiting case
importations could potentially suppress the epidemic by driving Rt <1 for a sustained period of time.

Instantaneous reproduction number method implemented in R package EpiEstim
We summarized the instantaneous reproduction number method below, of which detailed description has
been made available elsewhere.4,5 The instantaneous reproduction number is the ratio between the number
of incident cases at time t, and the total infectiousness of all the infected individuals at time t: Rt = It/Λt,
where 𝛬𝑡 = ∑𝑡𝑠=1 𝐼𝑡−𝑠 𝑤𝑠 . The total infectiousness is the sum of infection incidence up to the previous
time point (t-1) weighted by an infectivity function ws. The infectivity function is a probability
distribution that describes the average infectiousness profile of an individual after being infected, and it is
usually represented by the serial interval distribution as an approximation to the generation time
distribution. The number of new cases at time t is therefore a Poisson distribution with a mean of
𝑅𝑡 ∑𝑡𝑠=1 𝐼𝑡−𝑠 𝑤𝑠 . Given the reproduction number Rt, and conditional on the time series of daily new cases,
I0, …, It-1, the likelihood of the incidence It is therefore, (𝐼𝑡 |𝐼0 , … , 𝐼𝑡−1 , 𝑤, 𝑅𝑡 ) =

(𝑅𝑡 𝛬𝑡 )𝐼𝑡 𝑒 −𝑅𝑡 𝛬𝑡⁄
𝐼𝑡 ! where

𝛬𝑡 = ∑𝑡𝑠=1 𝐼𝑡−𝑠 𝑤𝑠 . Therefore, 𝑅𝑡 = 𝐼𝑡 /(∑𝑡𝑠=1 𝐼𝑡−𝑠 𝑤𝑠 ). We can interpret the instantaneous reproduction
number as the average number of secondary cases that an infectious person will infect at time t, if
conditions in previous time points remain the same at time t. Given this formulation of the instantaneous
reproduction number, Rt is highly sensitive to fluctuation in the incidence data. To minimize Rt variation,
the EpiEstim package allows user to specify a time window over which the Rt estimate is assumed to be
constant. The window is of size τ and ends at time t. If transmissibility is assumed constant over time
from (t-τ+1) to t, and is denoted by a reproduction number, Rt,τ, the likelihood of the incidence during the
time period, from I(t-τ+1) to It, conditional on incidence prior to the time period, from I0, to I(t-τ), is found to
be:5

The EpiEstim package utilized a Bayesian framework with a Gamma-distributed prior for Rt,τ, and the
analytical expression of the posterior distribution of Rt and estimated its median, the variance and the 95%
credible interval (CrI).5
Given the small number of cases in January and February and thus wide uncertainty bounds of the Rt
estimates, we presented Rt estimates from March to early July. Rt estimates of two respective time
windows of 7 days and 14 days, over which the Rt estimates is assumed to be constant, were presented
with their 95% CrI, as in Muniz-Rodriguez et al.14 As a sensitivity analysis, the 14-day time window
provides a more stable estimate as it would not be as responsive to sudden fluctuations in incident case
count. We did not use a time window shorter than 7 days because such Rt estimate would be very
sensitive to daily incidence fluctuation. Furthermore, for surveillance data by date of report (Alberta and
British Columbia), weekend effect is common given the 5-day work week, i.e., daily number of cases
reported over Saturday and Sunday would be lower than those from Monday to Friday. Therefore, it is
reasonable to use time-windows of 7 or 14 days.
Serial interval is assumed to follow a gamma distribution (mean: 4.60 days; standard deviation: 5.55).15
Map creation. The health region boundaries shapefile was downloaded at Statistics Canada at
https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/82-402-x/2018001/hrbf-flrs-eng.htm. The health regions were based
on 2016 Census geographic units. Maps were made in R version 3.5.1 (R Core Team, Vienna, Austria).
The boundaries shapefiles are transformed by R packages rnaturalearth (version 0.1.0) and sf (version
0.9.0), merged with the study data by health regions, and presented by R package ggplot2 (version 3.3.0).
The maps show the cumulative number of cases and fatal cases on the last day of each month between
January 2020 to June 2020, and the last date of the data (5 or 6 July 2020) with non-missing values.

We ran linear regression models to obtain the trend line over time.
a) Time delay in specimen collection
With (accurate episode date – specimen date) as the outcome variable (y) and accurate episode date as the
predictor variable (x), the linear model is:
y = ‒0.06627x + 1221.67026
Given that in R, date is counted from Jan 1, 1970 (when it is “day 0”), for January 1, 2020, x = 18262, y =
11.41 days; for March 1, 2020, x = 18322, y = 7.43 days; for June 21, 2020, x = 18434, y = 0.0062 day(s).
b) Time delay in test report
With (accurate episode date – test report date) as y and accurate episode date as x, the linear model is:
y = ‒0.08383x+1547.21994
For January 1, 2020, x = 18262, y = 16.31 days; for March 1, 2020, x = 18322, y = 11.29 days; for July 5,
2020, x = 18448, y = 0.72 day(s).
c) Time delay in case report
With (accurate episode date – case report date) as y and accurate episode date as x, the linear model is:
y = ‒0.07254+1339.42505
For January 1, 2020, x = 18262, y = 14.67 days; for March 1, 2020, x = 18322, y = 10.32 days; for July 5,
2020, x = 18448, y = 1.18 day(s).

Alberta started slowly reopening provincial parks and golf courses and would resume elective surgeries and
other non-urgent medical services next week.
British Columbia began to reopen its economy, easing lockdown restrictions on some summer sports
activities, retail businesses and hair salons.
Ontario began to ease pandemic restrictions, gradually resuming scheduled surgeries and reopening some
businesses and services, including retail stores with street entrances, construction, library pickups and some
outdoor sporting competitions. Workplaces could also gradually reopen, but people should work from home
as much as possible. The province also expanded eligibility for testing to include anyone with symptoms of
COVID-19.
British Columbia began to ease pandemic restrictions, allowing various businesses, restaurants, and
childcare to reopen as long as social distancing (2m distance) is maintained. Restaurants could have guests
up to 6 people in a group.
Ontario recommended that anyone over age two should wear a face covering when riding public transit
unless they have trouble breathing or removing a mask. Provincial officials also said that transit agencies
should erect plexiglass barriers on vehicles, make hand sanitizer available and clear high- touch areas.
Ontario Premier promised to ramp up testing in the next three to four weeks, but the province was only
completing about half its target of 16,000 tests per day.
Ontario extended pandemic restrictions to June 9 that would have expired on May 29. Under the extended
orders, playgrounds and pools would remain closed, bars and restaurants may only provide takeout and
delivery services, and people may not gather in groups larger than five people.
Ontario started rolling out an expanded testing strategy for COVID-19, which included testing workers in
key sectors and communities experiencing outbreaks, as well as asymptomatic individuals. Provincial labs
hit testing targets of 16000 tests a day.
The Canada federal government opened 38 national parks and 171 historic sites for hikes and other daytime
activities while camping overnight was not yet permitted.
Ontario reopened provincial parks, drive-in movie theatres and batting cages.
British Columbia reopened schools on a part-time basis.
Alberta began distributing 20 million non-medical masks at almost 600 drive-through locations across the
province, including fast food restaurants. While mask use was not mandatory, Alberta’s chief medical
officer recommended people wear a non-medical mask when physical distancing is not possible. Calgary
and Edmonton would distribute an additional 500,000 masks through the transit system.
24 of Ontario’s 34 public health units started second phase of easing pandemic restrictions, and 10 other
Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area and near the U.S. border would wait until new daily cases in those areas
consistently decrease.
The second phase increased the limit on gatherings to 10 people and allowed selected personal care services,
outdoor dining, and some outdoor recreational facilities to resume operations.
