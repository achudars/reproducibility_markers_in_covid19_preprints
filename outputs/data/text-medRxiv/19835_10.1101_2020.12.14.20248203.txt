ABSTRACT
Background: After eight months of the COVID-19 pandemic, Latin American countries have some of the highest rates
in COVID-19 mortality. Despite being one of the most unequal regions of the world, there is a scarce report of the effect
of socioeconomic conditions on COVID-19 mortality in their countries. We aimed to identify the effect of some
socioeconomic inequality-related factors on COVID-19 mortality in Colombia.
Methods: We conducted a survival analysis in a nation-wide retrospective cohort study of confirmed cases of COVID19 in Colombia from March 2nd to October 26th, 2020. We calculated the time to death or recovery for each confirmed
case in the cohort. We used an extended multivariable time-dependent Cox regression model to estimate the hazard risk
ratio (HR) by age groups, sex, ethnicity, type of health insurance, area of residence, and socioeconomic strata.
Results: There were 1 033 218 confirmed cases and 30 565 deaths for COVID-19 in Colombia between March 2nd and
October 26th. The risk of dying for COVID-19 among confirmed cases was higher in males (HR=1.68 95% CI: 1.641.72), in people older than 60 years (HR=296.58 95% CI: 199.22-441.51), in indigenous people (HR=1.20 95% CI: 1.081.33), in people with subsidized health insurance regime (HR=1.89 95% CI: 1.83-1.96), and in people living in the very
low socioeconomic strata (HR=1.44 95% CI: 1.24-1.68).
Conclusion: Our study provides evidence of socioeconomic inequalities in COVID-19 mortality in terms of age groups,
sex, ethnicity, type of health insurance regime, and socioeconomic status.

INTRODUCTION
The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is the first pandemic caused by a human coronavirus, the SARS-CoV-2. The first
cluster of patients with pneumonia of unknown origin was reported in Wuhan, China in January, 2020.[1] As of October
31st, 2020, there were more than 45.5 million confirmed cases and 1.1 million deaths affecting 188 countries around the
world. The region of the Americas is the most affected region accounting for more than 20.3 million confirmed cases and
636 482 deaths.[2]
Recently it has been declared that the situation due to COVID-19 corresponds to a syndemic since there is a combination
between the epidemic due to the infection by SARS-CoV-2 and the epidemic due to chronic non-communicable diseases
that interact in a social context of poverty and inequity.[3] There are three crisis affecting economies and societies in the
region: the slow economic growth, the environmental emergency, and the growing inequality.[4] The combination of
these social crises with the endemic of non-communicable diseases and the current pandemic are disproportionately
affecting the region. Latin America currently holds some of the highest COVID-19 death rates in the world and is facing
a humanitarian crisis powered by the longstanding inequality of its countries.[5]
COVID-19 has been recognized by some governments and media as “the great equalizer” due to its capacity to affect
people of different age groups, socioeconomic conditions, or prestige.[6] While this is probably true in terms of the
biological risk of infection, it is not the case for the observed risk of COVID-19 infection, severity and mortality. There
is evidence of racial and socioeconomic disparities in the United States in terms of the population infected by and dying
from COVID-19. [7] However, socioeconomic characteristics are not routinely collected or described in most COVID-19
analyses. [8] Therefore, there is a need for collecting and analyzing data on socioeconomic determinants of health to
monitor COVID-19 inequities, identify high-risk populations, and guide the development of public health interventions
within countries.
During the first wave of the pandemic by SARS-CoV-2 infection/COVID-19 in Colombia, South America, the national
public health surveillance system early adapted and prepared for this new threat, being able to detect and follow-up the
ongoing cases and their demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. To identify the effect of some demographic and
socioeconomic inequality-related factors on COVID-19 mortality during the first eight months of the epidemic in
Colombia, we conducted a survival analysis (time to death for COVID-19) using individual data from a nation-wide
cohort.
METHODS
Study population
Colombia is located in the north corner of South America. According to the National Administrative Department of
Statistics (DANE, for its initials in Spanish), the total population is projected by 2020 in 50 372 424 inhabitants.[9] The
country is divided into 33 departments and districts which groups 1122 municipalities. Half of the population are women
(51.2%), 77.1% of people live in urban areas and 68.2% of Colombians are between 15 and 64 years old. The first case
of infection for SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed on March 6th in Bogotá.
Study design and data sources
We conducted a survival analysis in a nation-wide retrospective cohort study of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in
Colombia from March 2nd to October 26th, 2020. The nation-wide cohort was ensembled using individual data obtained
from the national public health surveillance system (SIVIGILA, for their initials in Spanish). The National Institute of
Health (INS, for its initials in Spanish) compiles, verifies and adds laboratory data and other criteria for confirm or
discard cases and publishes anonymized and de-identified registries as open data (www.ins.gov.co). The first day of
symptoms’ onset for the first confirmed case was February 26th and there were 245 days elapsed till the end of the
follow-up period.
Symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 cases are confirmed in Colombia by using Reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR). Starting on July 23rd, 2020, symptomatic cases can be also confirmed by using antigen-based
validated tests. Deaths for COVID-19 are notified by health care services to SIVIGILA and DANE and then an
individual analysis of the cases confirms, discards or keeps as suspected the reports of deaths due to COVID-19.

All procedures performed in this study followed the national and international ethical standards. Informed consent was
not required due to the nature of the study and use of anonymized data from publicly available data sources.
Outcome and predictors assessment
The outcome event of interest for the study was COVID-19 death among confirmed cases. For deceased symptomatic
cases, we computed the ‘time to event’ as the difference between the dates of symptoms onset and the date of death. For
deceased asymptomatic cases, ‘time to event’ was calculated as the difference between the date of first medical
appointment and the date of death. The follow-up time of symptomatic recovered cases was the difference between the
date of symptoms´ onset and date of recovering (registered as laboratory or clinical recovery). For asymptomatic
recovered cases, the follow-up time was calculated as the difference between the date of the first medical appointment
and the registered date of recovery. We defined censored cases as active cases for which no event (death or recovery)
was confirmed by the last date of observation (October 26th). For symptomatic and asymptomatic censored cases, we
used the same calculation of the follow-up time described above taking into account the date of symptoms´ onset or the
date of the first medical appointment date, respectively (See Figure S1 in Supplementary material).
The exposure predictor variables of the model included the following individual demographic and socioeconomic
variables that usually leads to health inequalities: age, sex, ethnicity, type of health insurance, area of residence, and
socioeconomic strata. In Colombia, ethnicity minorities include “indigenous”, “African-Colombian descent”, a special
group of “Raizales” which refers to descendants of the original enslaved Africans, and “Gipsy-Romany”. The type of
health insurance is a proxy variable for health access. The “Contributory” type refers to job-related health insurance, the
“Subsidized” type covers poor people without formal jobs which hold a subsidy paid by the government, the “Special”
health regime covers few unionized workers, and the “exception” regime groups the army-related members. We included
age grouped into six life-course categories: infants (0-5y), children and school-age (5-11y), adolescents (12-26y), young
adults (27-45y), adults (46-59y), and seniors (60 or more years). The socioeconomic strata is a classification based on the
stratification of residential properties used by DANE according to the socioeconomic resources of a census block that
received public services. This classification divides houses into class levels, which range from one (very low ) to six
(high ) being one the strata with higher socioeconomic deprivation.[10] The socioeconomic strata is used as a proxy of
socioeconomic status (SES) in this study and was obtained as a self-reported variable in SIVIGILA.
Statistical analysis
All confirmed COVID-19 cases were included in the analysis by using the national cohort’s time to death and recovery.
Exploratory customary descriptions for distributions of continuous time-to-death variable and all categorical predictors,
for the different outcomes (dead, recovered and censored) included means, medians, frequencies and percentages. The
modeling process included testing of proportional hazards assumption for all the predictors using hypothesis tests (pvalues of terms addressing time dependent factors) and graphs (Log minus log plots and partial residuals plots from
models with no interaction terms). As all predictors but sex were dependent on time, we used an extended multipredictor time-dependent Cox regression model.[11] By using this extended model it is possible to jointly evaluate the
effect of multiple time-dependent variables and their role as potential confounders or effect modifiers. We included
simple product interactions between these variables and the time to event to estimate an extended Cox regression model
that allows non-proportional hazards. Survival functions were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. As our
objective was to obtain an explanatory model, we ran the multi-predictor regression models by the Enter method,
therefore, the resulting equation included all variables. We assessed the coefficient signs and significance by the Wald
statistic, and associations expressed as hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). All tests with p<0.05
were considered statistically significant. We performed the statistical analysis using SPSS software® version 26.
RESULTS
There were 1 033 218 confirmed cases and 30 565 deaths for COVID-19 in Colombia from the first day of notification,
March 2nd, to October 26th. Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the cohort of COVID-19 confirmed cases. Most
confirmed COVID-19 cases were male, older than 60 years old, living in urban areas, with the contributory regime of
health insurance, and living in residences that belong to the two lower levels of socioeconomic strata. Seven (0.02%) out
of the 30 565 cases that end up in deaths were asymptomatic. From all 914 882 confirmed cases that end up in recovery,
11.2% were asymptomatic. The 12.1% of the 87 874 confirmed cases censored at the end of the follow-up time were
asymptomatic (See Tables S1-S3 in Supplementary material).

Figure 1 shows the survival functions for each predictor in the model obtained from the multiple Cox Regression without
time-dependent factors (See Table S4 in Supplementary material for model details). As the assumption of proportional
hazards did not hold for all predictors but sex (see Figure S2-S12 in Supplementary material), we fit the multi-predictor
Cox Regression for time dependent variables including the same predictors. This model was statistically significant (p <
0.001). Table 2 presents the results of our final multi-predictor time-dependent Cox regression model (See Tables S5-S6
in supplementary materials for details). The instantaneous risk of dying for COVID-19 among confirmed cases is 59%
higher in males compared to females, 27% higher in indigenous people compared to whites/mestizos, and 97% higher in
people with subsidized health insurance regime compared to contributory. There was evidence of a dose-response pattern
by life-course age groups and SES levels. The risk of dying for COVID-19 among confirmed cases for people over 60
years is extremely higher than the risk for infants. The instantaneous risk of death for people with confirmed diagnosis of

COVID-19 living in the very low SES increases by 73% compared to the risk of people living in the high SES (HR=1.73
95% CI: 1.48-2.04). In contrast, living in a sparse rural area decreased the risk of mortality for COVID-19 (HR=0.83
95% CI: 0.76-0.91). Interactions terms between the time to the death and all the variables in the model were statistically
significant (p<0.001).

DISCUSSION
Our results provide evidence of socioeconomic and demographic inequalities in COVID-19 mortality in Colombia. In
addition to the well documented differential risk of mortality related to older age groups and male sex, this study
provides evidence of socioeconomic and ethnicity inequalities in COVID-19 mortality. We identified higher mortality
risks for indigenous people, people in the subsidized health regime, and those living in areas classified as very low and
low SES. The risks of mortality for age groups and SES levels followed a consistent dose-response pattern.
Our findings of association between COVID-19 mortality and older age (60 year or more) and male sex are consistent
with previous reports.[12] The most plausible explanation for this finding is the age-related response to sepsis in older
adults with decline in the immune cell function, reduced humoral immune function, and uncontrolled production of
inflammatory cytokines.[13] Our study also found an increased risk of death in men which is consistent with previous
results. [14] Sex differences in COVID-19 mortality are probably explained by the increased expression in men of the
angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), a key factor involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19.[15]
Ethnicity disparities have been also reported in a variety of contexts. African American and Hispanic in the United States
(US) are more vulnerable to COVID-19 mortality than other ethnic groups.[7] In Brazil, after age, Pardo ethnicity was
the second most important risk factor for death and probable explanations are differential access to health care or
susceptibility to COVID-19 infection.[16] Our study found an increased risk of COVID-19 mortality among indigenous
people. Leticia, the capital of the Amazonas department with a live frontier with Brazil, holds the highest COVID-19
mortality rate across departments in Colombia. It is estimated that at least 163 indigenous communities have been
infected for the SARS-CoV-2 in Latin America. Poor living and sanitary conditions combined with the burden of
previous infectious diseases and malnutrition impose a higher risk to the health of individuals and entire
communities.[17]
There is evidence of historical socioeconomic inequalities in previous pandemics. During the 1918 Spanish influenza
pandemic there were reports that showed that mortality rates in some countries of South America was 20 times higher
compared to countries in Europe.[18] The case fatality rates across countries early in the current COVID-19 pandemic
showed negative correlation with countries´ Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Human Development Index. [19,20] In
the US, the COVID-19 pandemic is accelerating the health inequities by disproportionately affecting people from the
most disadvantaged groups such as immigrants, people with disabilities and people in prisons and jails.[21] In Brazil,
income and education inequalities were positively associated with COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates.[22,23] Our
results showed that living in areas of very low or low SES is associated with higher COVID-19 mortality risk with a
consistent dose-response effect pattern. These results are consistent with a previous report of inequalities in mortality by
SES levels among COVID-19 confirmed cases in Bogotá.[24] These findings are also consistent with results of a nationwide ecologic study that showed increased risk of COVID-19 mortality associated with the municipalities`
multidimensional poverty index. [25] Colombia has one of the largest income gaps in Latin America and income
inequalities within the country differ widely by geographic region in relation to land property, work market, and the
effect of violence and armed conflict.[26] These baseline socioeconomic inequalities are translated into higher risk of
exposure to and severity of COVID-19 affecting disproportionately to people in lower socioeconomic conditions in
Colombia.
Social disruption stress producing pro-inflammatory gene expression has been described as a potential pathological
mechanism to explain higher adverse health outcomes in populations with disadvantaged socioeconomic conditions.[27]
However, the most possible explanation for the inequalities in COVID-19 mortality are the historical inequalities in
terms of living and working conditions, and the unequal access to health care services. Inequalities in working conditions
might explain an important part of the inequalities of COVID-19 infection and mortality. In our study, people in the
subsidized health insurance regime represent people with unstable or informal work, or unemployed people who need
subsidy from the government to get access to health services. Thus, the higher mortality risk observed in this group
compared to the contributory health regime might be representing the social inequality related to working conditions in
Colombia. People in the more disadvantaged working groups have lower-paid work and are more likely to work in key
basic services (food, cleaning, delivery or public services) that require them to work in person and commute across the
cities.[28] In contrast, people with higher-paid work are more likely to work from home with lower exposure to
COVID-19 infection.[29]

Despite having an almost universal health insurance coverage, the Colombian health system is characterized by a strong
fragmentation in the provision of health care services, an incipient primary health care, and differences in quality of
health care services across regimes.[30] Therefore, differences between contributory and subsidized groups might be
explained not only by underlying working conditions but also for chronic inequalities in access to high quality health
care services. Limited health care services are provided in semi-rural and sparse rural areas. Our findings, however,
found a potential protector effect for COVID-19 mortality for people living in those areas compared to people living in
urban areas. The direction of this association might be explained by the SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics that favors
contagion among close contacts in crowded places which is more common in urban areas.
The COVID-19 pandemic is occurring in presence of a non-communicable diseases (NCDs) epidemic and within a
context of historical inequalities in the social determinants of health, which is recognized as a syndemic.[29] There are
complex connections among NCDs, COVID-19 transmission dynamics and living conditions that shape disparities with
higher adverse effects for disadvantaged people. People from minority ethnic groups, people living in areas with higher
socioeconomic deprivation, generally have a greater number of or more severe or uncontrolled coexisting NCDs.[31]
These inequalities in chronic conditions are deepened by the way people live and work which make them also more
exposed to COVID-19 infection and mortality. Therefore, there is a need to measure, analyze and report demographic
and socioeconomic inequities for identifying groups at higher risk for COVID-19 mortality in order to guide tailored
public health interventions in countries.[8]
Our study provides strong evidence of socioeconomic inequalities in COVID-19 mortality in Colombia by using data
from a nation-wide cohort of confirmed cases during the first eight months of the epidemic. However, conclusions
should be carefully interpreted considering the limitations of the study. This study relies on data reported to SIVIGILA
and it is possible that despite its national coverage, some degree of underreporting might be present. The probability of
underreporting is higher in the sparse rural areas where most disadvantaged people live and therefore underreporting, if
present, would have an attenuating effect of the effect measures. Colombia does not conduct COVID-19 mass testing and
underreporting of cases and deaths might be influencing the confirmed cases captured by SIVIGILA and our results.
Finally, our results are not controlled for the presence of chronic morbidities in confirmed cases so the effect of specific
chronic diseases on COVID-19 mortality was not estimated and socioeconomic variables are not controlled for them.
In conclusion, our study provides evidence of demographic and socioeconomic inequalities in COVID-19 mortality in
terms of age groups, sex, ethnicity, type of health insurance regime, and socioeconomic strata. Confirmed COVID-19
cases who are male, over 60 years old, indigenous, holding a government subsidized health insurance, and those living in
areas classified in the lower socioeconomic strata have a higher risk of dying faster from COVID-19. Public health
interventions for prevention and early detection of COVID-19 cases should be prioritized for more vulnerable groups
according to the unequal mortality risks.

Testing of Assumptions
Additional to overall model statistics, and to systematically explore quantitative criteria of time dependent variables in
the model (see interactions between predictors and time in the final Cox Regression with time dependent variables), we
used graphical criteria to assess if proportional hazards hold. The following figures present plots between log minus log
transformation of survival estimates and time to event, and scatter plots between partial residuals and time to event.
Sex

Figure S2. Graphic test of proportional hazard assumption for Sex.
Left, Ln(-ln) transformation of survival estimate vs Time to event plot.
Right, Partial residual vs time to event plot.

Despite the Log minus log plot show almost parallel lines for male an female categories, the partial
residual plot shows a positive trend. The interaction between Sex and time to event has a
significative p-value close to zero.
Socioeconomic status

Figure S4. Partial residual vs time to event plots for SES categories.
Curves of Ln(-ln) transformation of survival estimates for SES categories do not overlap or cross. However, partial
residual plots for all categories but Middle-high SES, have clear trends. Additionally, as interaction between SES and
time to event had a p-value close to zero, we conclude SES violates the proportional hazards assumption.

Figure S6. Partial residual vs time to event plots for Life course age groups.
Similar to the former variables, the log minus log curves for categories in Life course just converge in the origin, with no
further crossings. However, partial residual plots have clear trends for categories of young adults, adults and seniors, and
for the interaction between Life course age variable and time to event has an overall p-value is close to zero, which
confirms proportional hazards assumption do not hold.
Ethnicity

Figure S8. Partial residual vs time to event plots for Ethnicity.
The shape of log minus log curves for categories in the ethnicity variable was parallel with no evident crossings.
However, partial residual plots for Indigenous, Raizal and Black or African-Colombian groups, had a negative trend, and
the p-value o the interaction between ethnicity and time to event close to zero, showed significant deviations from the
expected assumption of proportional hazards.

Area of residence

Figure S9. Ln(-ln) transformation of survival estimates for Area vs Time to event plot

Figure S10. Partial residual vs time to event plots for Area.
Almost parallel log minus log curves and almost flat partial residual plots contrast with the close to zero p-value of the
interaction term between Area and time to event. By prioritizing the quantitative criterion, we opted to include this
interaction in the final model.

Figure S12. Partial residual vs time to event plots for Health insurance.
Almost parallel log minus log curves for health insurance categories, which just show convergence at the origin, contrast
with marked trends on partial residual plots for Subsidized insurance and the group of people with no registries of the
type of health insurance. Exception regime had a slight positive trend and special regime had a slight negative trend. The
overall p-value of the interaction between health insurance and time to event was also close to zero.

Multi-predictor Cox Regression model with terms to address time-dependent factors
Numbers at risk
To complement the numbers at risk on figures of Survival plots for each predictor in the model, we present the number
of the two types of censored cases for 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180 and 200 days of follow-up.
