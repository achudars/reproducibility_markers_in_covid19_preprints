Abstract
Background: The rapid detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) is an urgent need for the prevention and containment of disease outbreaks in
communities. Although the gold standard is polymerase chain reaction (PCR), antigen tests such
as immunochromatographic assay (ICA) and chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA)
that can yield results within 30 minutes.
Methods: We evaluated performance of ICA and CLEIA using 34 frozen PCR-positive
specimens (17 saliva and 17 nasopharyngeal swab) and 307 PCR-negative samples.
Results: ICA detected SARS-CoV-2 in only 14 (41%) samples, with positivity of 24% in saliva
and 59% in NPS. Notably, ICA detected SARS-CoV-2 in 5 (83%) of 6 samples collected within
4 days after symptom onset. CLEIA detected SARS-CoV-2 in 31 (91%) samples, with positivity
of 82% in saliva and 100% in NPS. CLEIA was negative in 3 samples with low viral load by
PCR. Conclusions: These results suggest that use of ICA should be limited to earlier time after
symptom onset and CLEIA is more sensitive and can be used in situations where quick results
are required.

Introduction
Rapid detection of the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is critical for the prevention and containment of coronavirus
disease-19 (COVID-19) outbreaks in communities and hospitals.

Currently, the “gold standard”

of viral detection is quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using
nasopharyngeal swab samples (NPS) [1, 2]. NPS sampling requires specialized medical
personnel with protective equipment, posing risks of viral transmission to healthcare workers,
and false-negative results may occur due to deficiency in sampling technique[2, 3].
Self-collected saliva can be as effective as traditional nasal swabbing, making a major step for a
type of screening, which is much faster, and less instructive and expensive[4-6].
Although PCR is highly accurate and reliable, it is time-consuming as a screening test.
Viral antigen detection tests such as a rapid antigen test (immunochromatographic assay, ICA)
and chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA) are much more easy and yield results
quickly than PCR[7-11]. In this study, we evaluated the utility of ICA and CLEIA in comparison
with PCR using self-collected saliva and NPS.
Methods
Samples
We screened 34 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples (17 NPS and 17 saliva samples) as
established by PCR and 307 negative saliva samples. All positive samples were obtained from
symptomatic patients with COVID-19 and all the negative samples were obtained from
asymptomatic persons at screening. All the samples had been frozen and thawed before analysis.
This study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Board (Hokkaido University Hospital
Division of Clinical Research Administration Number: 020-0116), and informed consent was
obtained from all patients.
Saliva and NPS samples were collected as previously described[12]. Saliva samples
were diluted 4-fold with phosphate buffered saline and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 5 min at

4oC to remove cells and debris[12]. Following thawing, samples were centrifuged at 2,000 × g
for 5 min at 4oC to remove cells and debris. Each sample was divided for application to four
testing.
PCR
RNA was extracted using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany).
PCR tests were performed as described[12], according to the manual by National Institute of
Infectious

Diseases

(NIID,

https://www.niid.go.jp/niid/images/epi/corona/2019-nCoVmanual20200217-en.pdf).

Briefly,

5uL of the extracted RNA was used as a template. One step PCR was performed using One-Step
Real-Time RT-PCR Master Mixes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) and Real Time
PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The cycle threshold (Ct)-values were obtained using
N2

primers

(NIID_2019-nCOV_N_F2,

NIID_2019-nCOV_N_R2)

and

a

probe

(NIID_2019-nCOV_N_P2).
Antigen tests
ICA was performed using Espline SARS-CoV-2 (Fujirebio, Tokyo, Japan) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, samples were mixed with the sample preparation
mixture. The mixture (200μl) and 2 drops of buffer was added to the ample port and the results
were interpreted after incubation for 30 minutes.
Lumipulse SARS-CoV-2 Ag kit® (Fujirebio, Tokyo, Japan) is a sandwich CLEIA
using monoclonal antibodies that recognize SARS-CoV-2 N-Ag on LUMIPULSE G1200
automated machine (Fujirebio). 100 µL of saliva diluted with PBS was analyzed to measure
N-Ag levels according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, the treatment solution and the
specimen were consecutively aspirated using a single-use tip and was dispensed into suspension
of magnetic beads coated with the monoclonal antibody to SARS-CoV-2 N-Ag. After 10-minute
incubation followed by a wash-step, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-SARS-CoV-2
monoclonal antibody were added and incubated for another 10 minutes. After a second

wash-step, AMPPD substrate solution was added and developed for 5 minutes. The amounts of
SARS-CoV-2 N-Ag were calibrated with the developed chemiluminescence signals. The
calibrator of this assay contains the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 N antigen standardized with the
recombinant SARS-CoV-2 antigen. Antigen levels of 0.67 pg/mL or greater were defined as
positive.
Statistical analysis
Using positive samples detected by PCR, the proportion of positivity in each test was
calculated with 95% confidential interval (CI). The values detected by CLEIA and ICA test
were plotted against Ct value of PCR test. Kendall’s coefficient of concordance W was
calculated as nonparametric intraclass correlation coefficient. The values were also plotted
against the days from symptom onset in order to determine the trend over time. Histograms of
antigen concentration in the CLEIA test are drawn for both positive and negative samples. All
statistical analyses were conducted by R 4.0.2 and Clopper-Pearson exact confidence interval
was used for a proportion.
Results
SARS-CoV-2 positive samples included 17 NPS and 17 self-collected saliva. Median
time of sampling was 9 days (range, 2-14 days) after symptom onset. In all 34 virus positive
samples (17 saliva and 17 NPS) as established by PCR before freezing, PCR positivity was
again confirmed after thawing. ICA detected viral antigens in only 14 (41%, 95%CI: 25–59%)
samples (Table 1). Particularly, the virus was positive in only 24% (95%CI: 7–50%) in saliva in
contrast to 59% (95%CI: 33–82%) positivity in NPS. It should be noted that ICA was positive in
5 (83%, 95%CI: 36-100%) out of 6 samples collected within 4 days after symptom onset and in
9 (32%, 95%CI: 16-52%) of 28 samples collected thereafter. In NPS, it was positive in 9 (82%,
95%CI: 48-98%) out of 11 samples collected within 10 days after symptom onset, but in 1 (17%,
95%CI: 0-64%) of 6 samples collected thereafter. In saliva, all 3 samples collected at 2-4 days
after symptom onset were positive, but only 1 (7%, 95%CI: 0-34%) of 14 samples collected

thereafter were positive. Raw data are shown in Supplement 1.
On the other hand, CLEIA yielded 91% (95%CI: 76–98%) positivity, with 82%
(95%CI: 57–96%) positivity in saliva and 100% (95%CI: 80–100%) positivity in NPS. However,
3 out of 34 samples were CLEIA-negative. These samples were all saliva collected at 7, 12, and
14 days after symptom onset, and Ct values were 32.4-33.8 by PCR.
A scatter plot of antigen concentrations with CLEIA against Ct values of PCR test is
shown in Figure 1a. Kendall's coefficient of concordance was 0.91, indicating high correlation
between CLEIA and PCR in both saliva and NPS. ICA positivity tended to have higher viral
loads of PCR (Ct values: 21.6 [interquartile range, IQR]: 19.1–23.3) in ICA positive vs. 29.6
[IQR: 28.0–30.9] in ICA negative), but many PCR positive samples were ICA negative,
particularly in saliva (Figure 1b). Antigen concentrations determined by CLEIA declined over
time after symptom onset (Figure 2a). Similarly, frequency of ICA positivity decreased over
time (Figure 2b).
The distribution of antigen concentrations determined by CLEIA in 34 PCR-positive
and 307 PCR-negative samples is shown in Figure 3. The median (IQR) antigen concentration
was 48.2 (5.2 – 486.7) pg/mL in PCR-positive specimens and 0.03 (0.01 – 0.09) pg/mL in
PCR-negative specimens. The maximum of antigen concentration in PCR-negative specimens
was 24.23 pg/mL. Raw data are shown in Supplement 2.

Discussion
Our results suggest that ICA could be used only within 4 days after symptom onset
using both NPS and self-collected saliva. However, ICA is not reliable in samples collected
thereafter with significant concerns of high false-negative rates. Sensitivity of ICA markedly
decreased over time after symptom onset, particularly in saliva. It is well documented that
SARS-CoV-2 tends to persist longer in NPS than in saliva[12, 13]. It is thus reasonable to
speculate that lower sensitivity of saliva ICA is due to late sampling rather than the difference in

antigen load between saliva and NPS. Overall, sensitivity of ICA using NPS was 59%, which
was similar to 51-67.5% sensitivity of rapid antigen test using NPS for influenza[14-17]. It
should be noted that antigen testing of influenza using NPS is also recommended to perform
within 3 days after symptom onset[17]. ICA is suitable for point-of-care testing and therefore
these results should be confirmed in larger cohort.
In contrast, CLEIA is much more reliable and accurate in both NPS and saliva than
ICA, with high correlation observed between antigen concentrations and RNA load by PCR.
However, there were three PCR-positive but CLEIA-negative samples. These samples were all
saliva collected at 7, 12, and 14 days after symptom onset. We therefore recommend using
saliva for CLEIA only in patients who developed symptoms within a week. Moreover, in these
samples, Ct values were 32.4-33.8 by PCR. A “positive” PCR result does not necessarily
indicate presence of live virus[18], and recent studies showing patients with Ct values above
33-34 by PCR not to be contagious[19, 20]. Vice versa, there were 2 (0.65%) of 307 samples
were PCR-negative but CLEIA-positive with high antigen concentrations of 8.45 and 24.23
pg/mL. Reexamination of these specimens confirmed CLEIA-positivity. This could reflect a
false positive CLEIA, but the possibility of false negative PCR result cannot be completely
ruled out and the clinical implication of this discrepancy remains to be elucidated.
Measuring antigen concentrations by CLEIA is a novel approach to viral detection
with equivalent utility compared to PCR. To improve diagnostic accuracy, two-step testing with
initial CLEIA and secondary nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) is reasonable. Thus, the
great advantage of having a rapid and accurate CLEIA is the ability for primary screening to
establish a “gray zone” reserving definitive diagnosis by confirmatory NAAT testing. Reverse
transcriptase loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP)[7] has become the second most
common NAAT after PCR with several advantages over PCR: rapid turn-around time within 30
minutes, ease of implementation, and potential utility at point of care using a simple device[6, 9,
21-25]. We recently reported that LAMP had equivalent efficacy to PCR using saliva in both

asymptomatic persons and symptomatic patients [6]. Thus, LAMP is currently being used at the
international airport quarantine as the confirmatory NAAT testing of CLEIA in Japan.
Conclusions
Antigen detection of SARS-CoV-2 yield results quickly. However, use of a rapid antigen test
should be limited to within a few days after symptom onset. A quantitative antigen test using
both nasopharyngeal and saliva specimens shows high concordance with PCR and can be used
in situations where quick results are required.
