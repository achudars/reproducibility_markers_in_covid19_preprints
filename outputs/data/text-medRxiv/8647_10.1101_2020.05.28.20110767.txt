Abstract
The prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in healthcare workers with
intensive exposure to COVID-19 is unclear. In this study, we investigated the
seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in 797 asymptomatic healthcare workers with
intensive exposure to COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China. Positive IgG was detected
from 35 asymptomatic healthcare workers, and the prevalence of antibodies to
SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic healthcare workers was 4.39% (35/797). None of them
developed COVID-19 until May 15. 33 of them have performed at least one chest CT
scan showing no viral pneumonia features, and 16 have finished at least one-time
SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection with negative results. When contacting with the patients,
15 of them dressed with full personal protective equipment (PPE), and 16 worn N95
mask and gown. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first investigation reported
that the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 4.39% in asymptomatic healthcare
workers with applied PPE in a high epidemic area, which may provide useful
information of estimating asymptomatic infection rate in general population.

Introduction
The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is pandemic worldwide1-3. Asymptomatic
SARS-CoV-2 infection has been concerned to be risk for spreading virus4, while the
prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in healthcare workers with
intensive exposure to COVID-19 is unclear. In this study, we investigated the
seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic healthcare workers with intensive
exposure to COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China.
Methods
The epidemiological information was collected by trained investigators from 797
asymptomatic healthcare workers (705 female) in Wuhan. Blood was drawn from
February 12, 2020, to March 17, 2020. Serological tests of IgM and IgG antibodies
against SARS-CoV-2 were performed using an ELISA assay. The interval from the
first time of exposure to date of antibody detection was 37-72 days. This study was
approved by medical ethics committee of Union Hospital, Huazhong University of
Science and Technology (0056).
Results
Positive IgG was detected from 35 asymptomatic healthcare workers, and the
prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic healthcare workers was
4.39% (35/797). The epidemiological information and test results were shown in table
1. None of them developed COVID-19 until May 15. 33 of them have performed at
least one chest CT scan showing no viral pneumonia features, and 16 have finished at
least once SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection with negative results. All participants were
self-isolated during and after finishing their duties before antibody testing. None of
their family members was infected with SARS-CoV-2. The median age was 31 years

(range 23-53), and all were female. None of them had history of smoking, drinking,
chronic diseases and medication. Among these 35 cases, one is physician; one is
radiology technician, whereas 33 are nursing staff. Twenty-six of them reported to
have close contact with confirmed COVID-19 patients. Four of them had no direct
exposure to patients and 5 workers were uncertain of their exposure time. When
contacting with the patients, 15 of them dressed with full personal protective
equipment (PPE), and 16 worn N95 mask and gown. Seventeen nurses performed
high-risk operations, including sputum suction, ventilator operation, and sampling.
Discussion
The healthcare workers are at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection due to their high
frequency of exposing to patients and performing high-risk operations. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first investigation reported that the seroprevalence of
SARS-CoV-2 was 4.39% in asymptomatic healthcare workers with applied PPE in a
high epidemic area. These asymptomatic carriages were young, less likely to have
comorbid diseases and did not develop COVID-19. The extent of seroconversion in
asymptomatic healthcare workers may provide useful information of estimating
asymptomatic infection rate in general population.
There is a great concern about the role of asymptomatic healthcare workers in the
transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in hospital and community. It is not realistic to closely
monitor the medical staff without any symptoms because the SARS-CoV-2 RNA may
exist in a narrow window. Application of PPE when medical staff performed
operations and keeping them self-isolated during and after finishing duties in hospital
are very important measures for preventing transmission.
