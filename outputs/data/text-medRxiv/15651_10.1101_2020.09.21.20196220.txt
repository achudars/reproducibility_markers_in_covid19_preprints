Abstract: There is an urgent need to answer questions related to COVID-19’s clinical course
and associations with underlying conditions and health outcomes. Multi-center data are
necessary to generate reliable answers, but centralizing data in a single repository is not always
possible. Using a privacy-protecting strategy, we launched a public Questions & Answers web
portal (https://covid19questions.org) with analyses of comorbidities, medications and laboratory
tests using data from 202 hospitals (59,074 COVID-19 patients) in the USA and Germany. We
find, for example, that 8.6% of hospitalizations in which the patient was not admitted to the ICU
resulted in the patient returning to the hospital within seven days from discharge and that, when
adjusted for age, mortality for hospitalized patients was not significantly different by gender or
ethnicity.
Main Text: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic
represents a watershed event in public health and has highlighted numerous opportunities and
needs in clinical and public health informatics infrastructure (1–3). One of the key challenges has
been the rapid response of analyses and interpretation of observational data to inform clinical
decision making and patient expectations, understanding, and perceptions (4–8).
Several initiatives are building COVID-19 registries or consortia to analyze electronic health
record (EHR) data (6, 7, 9). The expectation is that these resources will provide researchers and
clinicians access to a rich source of observational data to understand the clinical progression of
COVID-19, to estimate the impact of therapies, and to make predictions regarding outcomes.
Registries may contain limited data for patients diagnosed with COVID-19: the barriers for
having more data are based on both privacy concerns and also on what elements have been
deemed valuable by health professionals and researchers at a particular point in time. The
problems with a new and evolving disease like COVID-19 is that we do not know what data or
information will be most valuable. For example, in the pandemic's early stages, the
dermatological and hematological findings were not evident, and those data were not included in
registries or reports. Interest in specific laboratory markers (e.g., D-dimer, troponin) for these
disturbances and additional symptoms (e.g. anosmia, conjunctivitis) has increased over time.
Additionally, it is challenging for researchers and clinicians to understand the structure and
quality of the data in registries and other types of data repositories, and to formulate queries to
consult the data in their institution. The process becomes more complicated when data from
multiple institutions are involved.
Thus, the utilization of EHRs to characterize COVID-19 disease progression and outcomes is
challenging. However, observational studies using EHR data may be useful when a research
question does not lend itself to a randomized clinical trial (RCT). Observational studies may also
help determine if results from RCTs replicate after relaxing eligibility criteria for real-world

applications. While the scientific community has raised concerns about the reproducibility of
findings, data provenance, and proper utilization of observational data, resulting in some
COVID-19 articles being retracted (10), there remains a clear need to responsibly, ethically, and
transparently analyze observational data to provide hypothesis generation and guidance in the
pursuit of evidence-based healthcare.
We focus on using novel decentralized data governance and methods to analyze EHR-derived
data. Researchers’ questions posed in natural language are adapted to standardized queries using
distributed data maintained in 12 health systems, covering 202 hospitals located in all U.S. states
and two territories, and one international academic medical center (Table 1). This collaboration
provides the capability to answer questions that require comparisons with historical data from
over 45 million patients and uses a dynamic approach to account for an evolving awareness of
the most impactful COVID-19 questions to answer and hypotheses to explore. Having access to
complete EHR data from 10 of these health systems (two sites use COVID-19 registries), and not
just a predefined list of key data elements, differentiates our approach from centralized registries
and public health reports. The ability to build and evaluate multivariate models across a large
number of health systems and to integrate results from registries differentiates our approach from
most federated clinical data research network approaches.

analyses do not require data transfer outside these institutions and reduce the risk of individual or
institutional privacy breaches. We produce results that are publicly available as soon as they pass
quality controls. In this approach, there is targeted analysis of specific data elements at a local
level. Only the results of calculations (e.g., counts, statistics, coefficients, variance-covariance
matrices) performed on data transformed into the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership
Common Data Model (OMOP CDM) from relevant patient cohorts are released from the
healthcare institutions; no individual patient-level data are shared (11).
Between December 11, 2020 and August 31, 2020, our consortium had 928,255 tested patients
for SARS-CoV-2, 59,074 diagnosed with COVID-19, with 19,022 hospitalized and 2,591
deceased. Our public Questions and Answers (Q&A) portal (https://covid19questions.org)
provides answers to research questions using several univariate or multivariate analyses,
including potential associations between mortality and comorbidities; pre-hospitalization use of
anti-hypertensive medications; laboratory values and hospital events. For each question, we
report on the number of participating institutions and the time period within which local queries
were run. Figure 1 shows the graphical display of two answers.
Example 1. “Many adult COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized did not get admitted to the
ICU and were discharged alive. How many returned to the hospital within a week, either to the
Emergency Room (ER) or for another hospital stay?” The answer indicates 8.6%. This question
is both important from the standpoint of understanding the natural course of disease and planning
for needed resources. Although efforts are underway to understand post-discharge outcomes in
COVID-19 infected patients, to date they have been limited to case series (12), modest sample
sizes (13), or single-center or geographically concentrated health systems (14, 15). These extant
studies may also be hampered by fixed inclusion/exclusion criteria (16).
Example 2. “Among adults hospitalized with COVID-19, how does the in-hospital mortality rate
compare per subgroup (age, ethnicity, gender and race)?” The answers from univariate and
multivariate analyses (logistic regression, Fig. 2) indicate that age is a major risk factor, but
ethnicity and gender are also significant when considered univariately. There is great interest and
growing peer-reviewed literature on risk factors for COVID-19 mortality: the agility of our
approach allows us to quickly re-run queries and rebuild models as new predictors become
relevant and the understanding of the disease evolves (17–20).
Several other questions and answers are shown in the portal and are updated when answers are
approved for posting. We also have a set of approved questions awaiting response from the
majority of sites.

presenting to the Emergency Room or a hospital readmission within seven days (data from ten
health systems). (B-E) Unadjusted mortality rates from aggregated results are shown with 95%
confidence intervals (data from ten health systems). Univariate analyses indicate that lower age,
Hispanic ethnicity, and female gender are associated with lower mortality for adult hospitalized

Institutions participating in our network are diverse in terms of organization, population served,
prior investments in information technology, and location. A novel governance structure in our
consortium allows us to distribute the workload across various teams without relying on a
traditional coordinating center, instead including a Consortium Hub for certain functions.

This approach keeps patient data in-house, simplifies data use agreements, avoids delegation of
control of patient data to another institution, and allows any institution to benchmark its results to
those produced by the consortium, since all questions and respective final, aggregated answers,
database query code, concept definitions and analytics code are made public. It complies with
HIPAA, the Common Rule, the GDPR, and the California Consumer Privacy Act with regards to
handling of patient data. Code sharing and public answers promote transparency and
reproducibility without disclosing patient information or institutional information.
Our approach has advantages but also some limitations. The advantages are that we are able to,
in relatively short time, publicly post answers to questions that are of general interest, using data
from a spectrum of highly diverse institutions with different levels of information technology
baselines and expertise in standardized data models and vocabularies, institutional policies, state
and federal regulations. Because we keep data locally and only consult data elements that are
necessary to answer specific questions, this approach has a lower risk of privacy breach when
compared to registries in which patient data are exchanged or to distributed consortia in which
summary-level results for each institution are reported. Additionally, since registries typically
focus on a single disease or condition, they often lack comparator data from other patients,
limiting the opportunity to characterize a new disease and discover how it differs from what we
currently know. Participating sites do not need to transform all data into OMOP CDM and can
decline to answer any questions they do not feel comfortable with or answer partially to ensure
patient-level privacy by masking counts between 1 and 10. Institutional privacy is also preserved
because all public answers combine the aggregate data from at least three Responding Sites (we
do not specify which ones), but we keep all answers for audits. Making concept definitions,
query code, and results available allows reproducibility and enables automated updates to the
answers. A major advantage is that existing registries of consortia can serve as additional sites to
help answer certain questions.
The limitations are inherent from considering all sites equal when formulating a final answer.
Regional or institutional practice variations are not represented in the answers. Additionally, the
distributed nature of the R2D2 consortium adds a requirement for a dynamic management team,
the need to educate local leadership on distributed analytics, and potential for delays in certain
decisions in order to exercise shared governance. A specific limitation of our current consortium
is the preponderance of institutions based in California: eight out of 12 (67%), accounting for
17.5% of COVID-19 patients (Fig. 3). This was a convenience sample of organizations that had
shared interests and a history of collaboration. We invite other institutions, consortia and
registries worldwide to join us in answering questions of general interest.
