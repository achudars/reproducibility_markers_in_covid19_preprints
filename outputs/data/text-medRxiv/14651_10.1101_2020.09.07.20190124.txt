COVID-19 and adolescent mental health

Abstract
Objective: There has been significant disruption to the lives and mental health of adolescents
during the COVID-19 pandemic, but the exact nature of the effects is not known. The
purpose of this study was to assess the psychological and lifestyle impact of the pandemic on
Australian adolescents, using an online survey, administered during and after the peak of the
outbreak (June-July 2020).
Method: Self-report surveys were administered online to a sample of 760 Australian
adolescents aged 12-18 years old. Surveys assessed worry about contracting COVID-19,
behavioral change in response to the pandemic, impact on education, peer and family
relationships, lifestyle factors including exercise, technology use and sleep, as well as mental
health outcomes including psychological distress, loneliness, health anxiety and wellbeing.
Results: Overall, young people expressed significant concern and worry about contracting the
virus, and most (>85%) engaged in behaviors to reduce the risk of transmission. Three
quarters of the sample reported a worsening of their mental health since the pandemic began,
with negative impacts reported by most respondents on learning, friendships and family
relationships. More than 40% of young people reported a decrease in exercise and 70%
reported an increase in technology use since the outbreak. There were high levels of
uncertainty about the future reported by respondents, and their scores on validated measures
indicated higher levels of sleep disturbance, psychological distress and health anxiety, and
lower levels of wellbeing, relative to normative samples. Reponses on the Kessler
Psychological Distress Scale indicated that 48.3% of the sample were experiencing distress
consistent with a probable mental illness, which is much higher than pre-pandemic
prevalence rates. Effects on mental health were worse among those who reported a previous
diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety relative to those without a history of depression and/or
anxiety.

COVID-19 and adolescent mental health

Conclusion: These results indicate high levels of disruption and psychological distress
experienced by adolescents during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Adolescents are already
vulnerable to the onset of mental illness at this developmental stage, and the current research
underscores the need to find rapid and accessible ways to support adolescent mental health
during times of crisis. There is a need for longitudinal research to evaluate the enduring
effects of the pandemic on adolescents.

COVID-19 and adolescent mental health

As of the 31st of August 2020, there have been more than 24 million COVID-19 cases
and 838,924 deaths worldwide 1, with 25,547 cases and 600 deaths in Australia. As the
pandemic and associated restrictions continue, there has been growing concern about the
impact on mental health. Studies from around the world have shown that most individuals
report increased psychological distress and worsened mental health 2-4, an effect which seems
to be amplified among those with a history of mental illness 5,6. Although worsened mental
health has been documented across the lifespan, several studies have found young adults
(aged 18-24 years) are experiencing the greatest deterioration in mental health 3,7. Very few
studies have assessed the impact of the pandemic-related disruption on adolescents 8, which is
concerning because adolescence represents a time of social transformation, marked by an
increased need for peer interaction and heightened sensitivity to social stimuli 9. Adolescents
demonstrate increased independence from their families, begin to establish relationships with
peers based on shared values and ideas 10, and become more sensitive to peer acceptance,
approval and rejection than either children or adults 11. Because of this sensitivity, it is likely
that social distancing measures, together with school closures, may have a greater negative
effect on adolescents. Support for this comes from a recent review of the literature involving
more than 50,000 young people that found that social isolation and loneliness significantly
increases the risk of mental illness in young people 12.
Despite the significant potential impact of pandemic-related restrictions on
adolescents, little empirical work has addressed this possibility. Four published studies have
assessed adolescent mental health (<18 years) in response to the pandemic, three conducted
in China and one in the US 13-16, which collectively show that the prevalence of mental illness
(most commonly depression and anxiety) is elevated relative to pre-pandemic prevalence
estimates. Evidence of a similar pattern of worsening youth mental health in Australia is
emerging. For example, the Kids Helpline (a 24-hour free counselling service for 5-25 year

olds), has reported a 40% increase in calls to the service, and the number of young people
attending the hospital Emergency Department for self-harm has increased by 33%, both
relative to the same period in 2019 17,18. In addition, young people’s behavior and lifestyles
have also been impacted by COVID-19. For example, one study 16 found that most teenagers
reported engaging in at least some social distancing, and another found that 94% of
adolescents reported engaging in protective behaviours, such as wearing a mask, hand
washing and social distancing 14. Moreover, worsening sleep and feelings of isolation and
loneliness have been reported 19, as has disruption to learning and education 14. Together, the
available data indicates significant impact on young people’s daily lives.
Beyond these studies, it is unknown how the disruption to daily life has impacted
adolescents’ behavior and worries as they relate to COVID-19. The impact on their peer
relationships, family relationships, feelings of loneliness, learning and education, lifestyle
factors (e.g., exercise, sleep, technology use), and how these relate to mental health, requires
investigation to understand the support adolescents require. The overall objective of the
current study is to address this gap and answer calls from the scientific community to assess
how young people’s lives and mental health has been impacted by the pandemic 20,21. The
first aim of this study was to investigate the psychological impact of the pandemic on
adolescents. We included measures of psychological distress, loneliness, health anxiety and
wellbeing, which we expected to have worsened, as informed by the emerging literature
13,14,16

. Based on previous studies from the adult literature 5,6, we expected that those who had

a pre-existing history of depression and/or anxiety would show a worse psychological
response to the pandemic.
The second aim was to understand how the pandemic and associated containment
measures impacted the lives of Australian adolescents. To this end, we collected data on
young people’s demographic characteristics, worry about contracting COVID-19, changes to

behavior, sleep disturbance, exercise, and technology use. Consistent with past studies, we
expected young people to express significant concerns about contracting COVID-19, and to
report changes in behavior, sleep patterns, exercise and technology use. A final exploratory
aim was to examine the relationship between levels of worry about pandemic, behaviour
change, uncertainty about the future, exercise, technology use, sleep, loneliness, wellbeing,
psychological distress and health anxiety.
Data was collected from an online survey distributed via social media advertisements.
While this method may not produce a representative sample of the entire population 22, it
nonetheless allowed timely access to a significant number of young people while containment
measures remained in place. The recruitment period (end of June-beginning of August 2020)
included the relaxing of lockdown restrictions across Australia (end of June-beginning of
July), with the exception of Melbourne and the state of Victoria, which went into a second
lockdown on the 8th of July (Melbourne) and 2nd of August (Victoria).

Method
Participants
Participants were recruited via social media and were aged 12-18 years, living in
Australia. Data was collected via the Qualtrics platform from 22 June 2020-5 August 2020.

Ethics approval and consent
The study was approved by the UNSW Human Research Ethics Committee
(HC200334). All respondents were required to pass a Gillick Competency Task to ensure the
understood the study, and had the capacity to provide informed consent, before providing
consent 23.

Measures
Demographics, general health and mental health history
Information was collected on participants’ age, school grade, gender, country of birth,
language spoken at home, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status, state of residence and
who they lived with. Participants indicated if they had a parent or carer whose job had been
impacted by the pandemic. Participants rated their self-rated health 24, and were asked
whether they had a chronic illness, had ever been diagnosed with depression or anxiety by a
professional, and current mental health treatments.

COVID-19 Exposure, Perceived Risk and Behaviour Change
The items below were generated from a previous survey 25.
COVID-19 Exposure. Participants were asked five yes/no questions about COVID19 - whether they had been tested/diagnosed, whether a family member or close contact had
been diagnosed, and whether they had been required to quarantine for 14 days.
Perceived Risk. Participants were asked four questions relating to their perceptions of
risk and their concerns about contracting COVID-19. The first question assessed how worried
they were about catching COVID-19 on a 5-point scale (not at all - extremely concerned).
They then rated perceived likelihood would catch the virus on a visual analogue scale (VAS)
from 0 (not at all likely) to 100 (extremely likely), and perceived behavioural control (i.e.,
how much they thought they could do to protect themselves from catching the virus), on a 0
(I can’t do anything) to 100 (I can do a lot) VAS. The final questions assessed perceived
illness severity if they did catch COVID-19 (response options were: no symptoms, mild
symptoms, moderate symptoms, severe symptoms, severe symptoms requiring
hospitalisation, and severe symptoms leading to death).

COVID-19 and adolescent mental health

Behaviour Change. Participants indicated whether they had engaged in eight social
distancing and hygiene behaviours over the past week (hand washing, hand sanitising,
facemask wearing, avoidance of: going to the shops/touching surfaces/spending time with
people from outside the household/going to school and whether they stayed home as much as
possible). Response options were on a 5-point scale (1=not at all to 5=to all of the time).

COVID-19 Impact on Physical and Mental Health, School/Education and Relationships
Physical and mental health. Young people were asked, in two separate questions,
whether their physical and mental health had been impacted by the pandemic (a lot better, a
little better, stayed the same, a little worse, a lot worse).
School and education. Respondents indicated whether their school shut down during
the pandemic and whether they participated in online learning (both yes/no). Those engaged
in online learning reported up to three challenging aspects of completing school work at
home, from a forced choice list (not enough family support, parents working and didn’t have
time to help, access to technology, speed of internet, harder to learn online, too many
distractions, not enough support from teachers, not motivated, other). Participants indicated
how much they felt the pandemic had impacted their learning overall (positively, not at all,
negatively).
Peer relationships. Two questions assessed how the pandemic had impacted
participants’ friendships; first, how socially connected they felt to their friends (more
connected, no change, less connected); and second, impact on friendships overall (positively,
negatively, not at all).

COVID-19 and adolescent mental health

Family functioning. Two items assessed young people’s family relationships, in
terms of overall impact on relationships with family members (improved, no change,
worsened), and impact on family stress levels (less stress, no stress, more stress).

Lifestyle Factors
Exercise. Participants indicated the number of days they exercised for at least 30
minutes over the previous week (0, 1-2 days, 2-4 days, 5-6 days, every day, don’t know), and
to report whether, they exercised more, less, or the same amount as they usually would.
Technology use. For the previous week, participants estimated total time spent in
front of screens each day, not including time spent on school work (<1 hour, 1-2 hours, 2-4
hours, 6-8 hours, and >8 hours). They also reported how much time was used to connect with
friends or family (same response options) and whether their use of technology had changed
since the pandemic (less than before, the same, more than before).
Sleep. Sleep was measured using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), which is a sevenitem self-report measure of insomnia symptoms over the previous two weeks 26. Responses
are reported on a Likert scale from 0-4 with the following cut-off scores: 0-7 no clinically
significant insomnia, 8-14 subthreshold insomnia, 15-21 moderate severity insomnia, 22-28
severe insomnia 26. The ISI has been widely administered to, and validated in, general
adolescent samples 27.
Loneliness. A single item was selected to assess loneliness and was taken from the
UCLA Loneliness Scale 28. Participants were asked to indicate how often they felt alone over
the past two weeks (hardly ever, some of the time, often).

Uncertainty about the future. A single item was selected to ask participants about
their feelings of uncertainty about the future, ranging from ‘not at all’ to ‘extremely’ on a
five-point scale where a higher score represents greater levels of uncertainty.

Mental Health & Wellbeing
The Kessler-6 (K6) assessed general psychological distress over the past 30 days 29,30,
and the 7-item Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale – short form SWEMWS; 31
assessed mental wellbeing over the past two weeks. Both scales have been validated for use
in young people 32,33. The three item Body Preoccupation Scale of the Illness Attitude Scales
34

was administered to assess health anxiety.

Procedure
Participants responded to study advertisements by clicking on a link which took them
to the survey landing page. They read the electronic information sheet and consent form,
completed the Gillick Competency Task, before accessing the survey. Upon completion,
participants were placed in a draw to win one of five $50 vouchers.

Statistical Analyses
Demographic and clinical characteristics were reported using descriptive analyses.
Where possible, outcomes from standardised measures were compared to normative, general
population data. Independent samples t-tests compared participants with and without a prior
diagnosis of anxiety and/or depression on outcome variables (e.g., K6). Zero order

correlations were conducted between worry about COVID, behaviour change, lifestyle and
mental health variables.
Results
In total, 1743 young people viewed the study page, and 945 participants provided
consent and started the survey. Of those, 185 did not provide enough data (<90% complete)
to be included. The final sample comprised 760 participants.

Demographics
Table 1 summarizes participant characteristics. Participants were 14.8 years on
average, and ranged in school year from Years 7-12. Most were female (72%), spoke English
at home (87.7%) and were born in Australia (88.1%). Participants lived across all states and
territories. Almost two-thirds of the sample (63.2%) reported living with two parents, and
50% indicated that their parent or carer’s job had been impacted by the pandemic.

General Health and Mental Health History
The mean rating for overall health was 3.44/5 (SD=1.01), with most rating their health
as either ‘good’ (29.8%) or ‘very good’ (38.5%). Twenty one percent reported a current
chronic illness, 34% reported a previous diagnosis of either depression or anxiety, and 27.8%
were receiving current mental health treatment (See Table 1).

COVID Exposure, Perceived Risk and Behavior Change
Exposure. Only 0.3% had a diagnosis of COVID-19. Few participants had a family
member who had contracted the virus (1.9%), while just under 10% had a close contact who
had the virus.

COVID-19 and adolescent mental health

Perceived risk. On average, young people expressed moderate levels of worry about
contracting the virus (M=2.27, SD=0.97), and most (68.5%) were ‘a little concerned’ or ‘
moderately concerned’ about catching the virus. Respondents thought it was relatively
unlikely that they would contract COVID-19 (M=25.29; SD=19.81; scale 0-100), and
reported a sense of agency that their behaviors could prevent them contracting the infection
(M=60.75; SD=24.29; scale 0-100). Young people expected if they contracted the virus they
would experience either no (5.3%) or mild (39.8%) symptoms, with 37.2% expecting
moderate symptoms.
Behavior change. Most engaged in protective health-related behaviours over the
previous week. Reports of handwashing were high, with 68.6% indicating they washed their
hands thoroughly ‘all of the time’ or ‘most of the time’ as was sanitizer use (72.1% all or
most of the time). Most (85.6%) respondents avoided touching objects or surfaces touched by
other people to at least some extent, and 30% reported wearing a facemask. Respondents also
avoided places to reduce the spread, with 82.1% avoiding the shops at least some of the time
(43.3% reported avoiding shops all or most of the time), 81.3% avoiding leaving the house
(48.4% always or most of the time), and 70.4% avoiding spending time with people outside
their household (35.1% always or most of the time). Half reported not going to school in the
previous week due to the pandemic.

COVID-19 Impact
Physical and mental health. See Figure 1. More than half of the participants
indicated that their physical health had worsened during the pandemic. Approximately a third
reported no change, and few reported an improvement. The impact of the pandemic on
mental health revealed different results; most (75%) young people reported a negative effect
on their mental health. Few reported no change or an improvement.
School and education. Most (87%) reported that their schools closed during the
pandemic, and the majority (95.1%) engaged in online learning instead. The top three
challenges to online learning were: i) a lack of motivation; (ii) too many distractions at home,
and iii) it being more difficult to learn via online platform relative to face-to-face. A lack of
support from schoolteachers, increased school workload, feelings of loneliness and slow
internet was also noted. Overall, two in three young people (62.6%) felt that the pandemic

Peer relationships. See Figure 2. Most respondents reported feeling less connected to
their friends. There seemed to be a degree of stability to adolescents’ friendships, with about
half of the sample reporting no overall impact on their friendships.
Family functioning. See Figure 2. Approximately one third of respondents reported a
worsening of family relationships, and most young people reported a worsening of family

Lifestyle Factors
See Table 2.
Exercise. Twenty percent reported zero instances of at least 30 minutes exercise
during the previous week. Approximately half of respondents indicated that they exercised
for 30 minutes on at least 1-2 days. Most young people reported either a decrease in exercise
since the pandemic began, or no change.
Technology Use. Most young people reported either 2-4 hours or 4-6 hours daily
screen use. There was a still a significant proportion of young people reporting higher levels
of use (>8 hours) each day, with 72% reporting increased technology use to connect with
others, usually spending around 4 hours online for interaction. Almost three quarters of the
sample reported increased technology use since the start of the pandemic.
Sleep disturbance. The mean score on the ISI was 12.09 (SD=6.03). Just under half
of the sample (40.5%) reported subthreshold insomnia, while more than a quarter (28.7%)
reported moderate severity insomnia and a further 6.4% reporting severe insomnia.
Loneliness. Just over half (51.4%) of the sample reported frequently experiencing
feelings of loneliness. A further third reported feeling alone some of the time..
Uncertainty about the future. Ninety-three percent of respondents reported some
degree of uncertainty about the future, with approximately one third (33.8%) reporting very
or extreme levels of uncertainty.

Mental Health and Wellbeing.
Mental health. The mean score on the K6 was 18.08 (SD=6.63; Range 6-30), with
just under half of the sample (48.3%) scoring above the threshold that indicates psychological
distress indicative of mental illness.
Wellbeing. Mean wellbeing score was 18.79 (SD=5.87; Range 7-35), with a higher
score indicating greater levels of wellbeing.
Health anxiety. On the screening survey for health anxiety, the Body Preoccupation
Scale of the Illness Attitude Scales, 40.1% of young people scored above the clinical cutoff
which indicates severe health anxiety.

Comparison between adolescents with and without a prior mental health diagnosis
Young people with and without a self-reported diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety
were compared on outcomes (See Table 3). After removing those who did not know if they
had a diagnosis or chose not to say, 60% percent of the remaining sample reported no history
of mental illness, and 40% reported a previous diagnosis of depression or anxiety (3.9%
depression only, 12.6% anxiety only, and 23.3% both depression and anxiety). These
categories were collapsed for the subsequent analyses into presence or absence of a
diagnosed depression and/or anxiety. Participants with a history of depression or anxiety
reported worse mental and physical health on all measures (see Table 3), and reported lower
levels of exercise, great use of technology, poorer sleep, higher levels of loneliness,
uncertainty about the future, psychological distress, health anxiety and lower levels of
wellbeing (all ps <0.05; see Table 3 for full statistics).

COVID-19 and adolescent mental health

Association between COVID-fears, behaviour, lifestyle factors and mental health
See Supplementary materials for results. There was a significant positive correlation
between fears about contracting COVID-19, and behaviour change, feelings of uncertainty
about the future, poor sleep, psychological distress, and health anxiety (all ps<.01). Greater
exercise was associated with lower levels of screen time, better sleep, lower levels of
psychological distress and a greater sense of wellbeing (ps<.01). Overall screen time was
associated with more psychological distress; however, when screen time was used to connect
with friends and family, the relationship with distress was no longer evident, and increased
screen time for connection was associated with lower levels of loneliness and higher levels of
wellbeing (ps<.01). Finally, as expected, all the mental health variables were significantly
associated, with positive correlations between loneliness, health anxiety and psychological
distress, and an inverse association between these variables and wellbeing being detected.

Discussion
This survey of 760 Australian adolescents aged 12-18 years provides the first insight
into the disruption experienced following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although
respondents had little direct or indirect experience with COVID-19, more than three quarters
were worried about contracting the virus, replicating findings with adults 6 and adolescents 14.
Most young people believed they could reduce their risk of contracting COVID-19 and
engaged in behaviors to lower their (e.g., handwashing and social distancing), in contrast to
common portrayals by the media suggesting young people are not compliant with restrictions
e.g., 35. Our results showed that worry about contracting COVID-19 was associated with
greater levels of overall behaviour change, demonstrating a practical benefit of some degree
of worry.

This study also sheds light on the disruption and impact of the pandemic on young
people’s lives. Almost the whole sample (>95%) had engaged in online learning, and most
reported a negative impact. At the time our survey was undertaken, schools and families had
to adapt to online learning from home with little-to-no preparation time. While meta-analyses
have shown that with optimal delivery and support, online formats can be as effective as faceto-face in terms of learning outcomes for adults 36, there is no evidence to suggest this is the
case for young people. Indeed, because school education is primarily face-to-face, data about
the effectiveness of online schooling is lacking. Online learning requires a greater level of
independence, motivation, and discipline than classroom learning and these are skills which
young people may not have fully developed 37.
Participants reported a negative effect of the pandemic on friendships, and feelings of
loneliness, which were associated with higher psychological distress and lower wellbeing.
Adolescents are at a crucial stage of development involving the formation of a sense of self
and identity through shared interests and values with their peers 38. Given a lack of social
connection has negative consequences on social and cognitive development 9, and loneliness
increases the risk of the development of depression and other disorders 12, mental health
prevention and intervention efforts need to focus on improving social connection, particularly
in areas that have containment measures in place for prolonged periods. Until restrictions are
lifted, the use of technology to connect with others might mitigate the potential disruption to
adolescents’ social needs. With widespread smartphone use 39, it is reassuring that studies
have found that core components of quality face-to-face interactions can be replicated online
40

. Consistent with expectations, our study found that nearly three quarters of participants

reported increased use of technology to connect with others and this was associated with
lower levels of loneliness and a greater sense of wellbeing. This finding aligns with research
from China showing increased smartphone and social media use at the height of the pandemic

. Most young people in our study reported spending about 4 hours a day connecting with

others online. Whether this will mitigate potential long-term consequences of social
deprivation associated with lockdowns will need to be addressed by future longitudinal
studies.
Most respondents indicated that the pandemic had increased stress levels within their
family and half reported an impact on the job of a parent or carer. Viewed in this context,
together with adjusting to online learning and the requirement for parents to manage their
own professional responsibilities with caring and supporting their child’s learning, it is not
surprising this has been a stressful time for families. This aligns with findings from around
the world that are beginning to highlight higher levels of stress and mental ill-health
experienced by certain sub-groups of the population, including women, who are more likely
to be in caring roles, as well as parents and young people 3,7. Despite this increased family
stress, >50% indicated that their relationships with family members had remained unchanged,
and an additional 18.7% reported an improvement. It could be the case that in some families,
more time at home with family members has some advantages, and feeling more connected to
loved ones is a benefit of COVID-19 that has been documented in the adult literature 41.
Encouragingly, >50% of the young people continued with or increased their regular
levels of exercise. There are well-documented links between exercise and reduced risk of
depression and anxiety across the lifespan 42 and the relationship between exercise and lower
levels of psychological distress and great wellbeing in our sample is consistent with this
broader literature 15. Given that even the strictest lockdowns in Australia have allowed for up
to 1 hour of exercise per day, exercise could be promoted in public health campaigns as a
means to prevent deteriorating mental health should the lockdown and period of restrictions
continue. Relatedly, a significant proportion of young people also reported increased

difficulty sleeping, and exercise is one way in which sleep quality and duration can be
improved 43, which was supported by our correlational analyses.
Of concern was that about half of the sample reported a worsening in their physical
health since the pandemic began, while 75% reported a negative effect on their mental health.
The worsening of mental health in our sample was markedly consistent to that of a recent
adult Australian survey 6, which found that 78% of their respondents had reported worsened
mental health. Overall, young people reported greater psychological distress and lower levels
of wellbeing relative to normative data available from population surveys conducted prior to
the pandemic 44,45, with rates of psychological distress indicative of probable mental illness
increasing almost two fold from 24.3% before the pandemic 45, to 48.3% in this survey. This
finding accords from the studies from China showing elevated mental illness 8. It is important
to note that the K6 is not a diagnostic interview and so without information about the exact
duration of the symptoms, degree of interference in daily life and distress to the individual,
drawing diagnostic conclusions is not possible. We also cannot rule out the heightened levels
of psychological distress as being at least in part attributable to sampling bias, inherent with
online surveys. With these limitations in mind, our data nonetheless suggest that there are
significantly elevated rates of psychological distress 45, providing insight into the acute
effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescent mental health.
Over one third (34%) of participants had a self-reported history of depression or
anxiety, which is comparable to lifetime prevalence estimates for adolescents 46. Consistent
with the adult literature 5,6, our results showed that relative to those without a history of
depression or anxiety, those with a history experienced heightened levels of loneliness,
greater trouble sleeping, more uncertainty about the future, higher levels of health anxiety,
greater psychological distress and lower levels of wellbeing among those who had a
previously diagnosed mental illness. These finding advance knowledge of youth mental

health by showing an exacerbation of mental illness among those with a history of anxiety
and/or depression.
The findings reported in this study underscore the need for a proactive mental health
response to support young people through this tumultuous and disruptive time in their lives.
High levels of psychological distress reported in this study are consistent with increased
demands on youth mental health services e.g., 18. Readily accessible interventions are needed
for young people that are engaging and effective, with a focus on treatment, and prevention.
Digital mental health interventions, and blended modalities with combine digital with
clinician support hold this promise 47.
There are several study limitations. First, as a convenience sample recruited online
due to the ease of rapid administration, 72% were female, limiting the generalizability of
findings to the broader Australian adolescent population. The importance of sampling
approach has been noted as a key concern during COVID-19 22. Follow-up studies should use
diagnostic assessments, to provide an independent assessment of mental health. The study
was cross sectional and so causal conclusions cannot be drawn. We will be continuing to
follow this sample longitudinally to learn about how their lives and mental health change
over time in response to the pandemic.
