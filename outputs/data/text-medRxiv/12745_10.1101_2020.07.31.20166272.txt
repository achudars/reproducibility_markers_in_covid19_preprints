Abstract
The unique circumstances created by the COVID-19 pandemic pose serious challenges
to mood stability and emotional regulation at all ages. Although many people tend to
react resiliently to stress, others appear to display emotional anxiety and depressionrelated symptoms. In this study, we carried out a survey (N = 10,053) during the first
week of the general lockdown (quarantine) in Argentina to measure early affective
reactions in Argentine adults. Respondents showed substantial anxious and depressive
symptoms, with 33 % and 23% of participants reporting possible depressive and
anxious syndromes, respectively, with the youngest group (18 to 25 y.o.) showing the
highest prevalence of symptoms. Even if prior mental health problems predisposed or
aggravated the reaction, participants without prior complaints showed signs of
psychological impact. Using linear regression, the most important independent variables
related to depressive symptoms was the feeling of loneliness followed by daily stress. In
the case of anxious states, the strongest variables were negative repetitive thinking and
feeling of loneliness. Other psychological, economic, and social factors are discussed.
This study is in line with previous literature that highlight the importance of the
psychological impact of pandemics, but additionally demonstrates that these reactions
are present at a large scale immediately after the start of quarantine with very low
infectious rates as an early anticipatory adaptive reaction leading to potential negative
outcomes from adjustment disorders to major disorders. In addition, the present results
provide potentially relevant information about sudden environmental impacts on
affective states and specific pathways for anxiety and depression to be expressed. We
end by discussing implications for public policy based on considering the most
vulnerable groups.

Key Findings
● More than a third of the studied sample (n = 10,053) showed substantial
depressive and anxious symptoms between 5 and 7 days after the start of the
national quarantine.
● 33.7% of the sample scored above the PHQ-9 cutoff for possible diagnosis of a
depressive disorder and 23.2% for an anxiety disorder.
● 28.6% of the participants showed moderate and severe levels of depressive
symptoms and 23.2% showed moderate and severe levels of anxiety.
● The youngest participants were affected the most by the situation.
● The most important factor related to depressive symptoms was the feeling of
loneliness followed by daily stress.
● The most important factor related to anxious states was negative repetitive
thinking followed by feeling of loneliness.
● The existence of previous mental health difficulties aggravated the reactions, but
even people who had not sought out treatment previously showed signs of
psychological impact.

The circumstances created by the COVID-19 pandemic are generating
unprecedented challenges to mood stability and emotional regulation of entire
populations at once. The fear caused by the threat of a highly contagious disease
together with the side-effects of strong prevention measures such as social isolation and
quarantine make a powerful environmental combination that could have a significant
impact on the mental health of a great number of people.
The spread of fear has been noticed as an important psychological factor in
previous recent epidemics such as the 2003 SARS and 2014-2015 Ebola virus
epidemics (Taylor, 2019; Shultz et al., 2015). Three common features increase fear
spreading: (i) if the infection is new and unpredictable, (ii) its management with
isolation, and (iii) a generalized fear of infecting or being infected by others. At the
same time, high uncertainty about the future, including the consequences and duration
of the pandemic, and continuous presence of alarming news and fatalities contribute to
increase fear reactions (Asmundson & Taylor, 2020; Gao et al., 2020). In previous
epidemics, the number of patients with mood and anxiety disorders has grown together
with the aggravation of symptoms among previously diagnosed patients (Shultz,
Baingana, & Neria, 2015; Wu et al., 2009; Taylor, 2019). Furthermore, people affected
with psychological disorders may exceed the number of infected cases and would
require considerable amounts of additional specialized mental health treatment
(Eichelberger, 2007; Taylor, 2019; Normile, 2016; Kluger, 2014; Chang et al., 2004;
Person et al., 2004).
At the same time, previous studies have shown that isolation measures during
epidemics can cause a significant and lasting psychological impact (Taylor, 2019).
Extreme isolation generates a stressful environment accompanied by fears of infection,
financial preoccupations, tasks overload, frustration and boredom, inadequate

information, insufficient supplies, among other factors. A recent review (Brooks et al.,
2020) lists a wide range of psychological manifestations in people under quarantine,
such as general psychological symptoms, emotional disorders, depression, low mood,
irritability, insomnia, stress symptoms, anger, and emotional exhaustion. If the
quarantine is appraised as a negative experience there may be long-term consequences
(Brooks et al, 2020). In previous epidemics, a period longer than 10 days of quarantine
has been related with a wide range of psychiatric disorders in the general population
such as post-traumatic stress disorder (Brooks et al., 2020), anxiety (Taylor, 2019), and
depression (Hawryluck et al., 2004). Considering the magnitude of COVID-19
pandemic and the extreme measures undertaken to fight it, it is expected that it can
cause at least similar reactions in most populations where the virus has spread rapidly.
Recent studies in the earliest affected countries confirm this assumption (Mazza et al.,
2020; Qiu et al., 2020; Tian et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020)
Alongside the medium and long term effects of pandemics and quarantine
previously described, it is conceivable that generalized isolation may also provoke a
rapid effect on emotional status by different means in at least a subset of the affected
population. First, the adoption of strong protective measures such as a quarantine at a
national scale may work as a signal of the seriousness of the circumstances that in turn
reinforces the magnitude of perceived threat. Second, a strict lockdown means a sudden
disruption of everyday routines and social-biological rhythms of millions of people.
Social contact, work activities, physical exercise, sleep, and sexual activity are only
some of the areas that may be affected or suppressed during the quarantine. These
abrupt changes that convey a reduction in pleasant activities and an increase of aversive
experiences may negatively impact on the rate of reinforcement as posited by
behavioral theories of depression (Lewinson, 1975; Carvalho & Hopko, 2011) and

affect reward processing in more vulnerable individuals through a gene-environment
interaction as depicted by more recent neurobiological accounts (Nusslock & Alloy,
2017). In the same vein, irregular social rhythms and circadian rhythm disruption have
been associated with a greater risk of developing mood fluctuations and
symptomatology in people vulnerable to mood disorders (Ehlers et al., 1988; Russo &
Nestler, 2013; Zaki et al., 2018). Third, being isolated may provoke an increase of
worries, ruminations, and other kinds of recurrent negative oriented thinking associated
with negative affect. This kind of repetitive negative thinking is associated with the
development of both depressive and anxious symptoms (Ehering & Watkins, 2008;
Drost et al., 2014; Spinhoven et al., 2018; McEvoy et al., 2019). Finally, strong
isolation may exacerbate feelings of loneliness in people who were previously
experiencing it or even generate new perceived loneliness in certain cases. Social
isolation and feelings of loneliness have been linked to a variety of negative mental
health outcomes (Cacioppo, et al., 2015; Cacioppo & Cacioppo, 2018).
Meanwhile most studies of previous epidemics did not measure psychological
impact in shorter periods than 10 days and were restricted to a limited number of people
(Brooks et al., 2020), some recent studies of COVID-19 pandemic report the effects of
large-scale quarantines on general population in the earliest stage of isolation measures
(Wang et al., 2020; Mazza et al., 2020; González-Sanguino et al., 2020).
Accordingly, the aim of this study was to evaluate the affective impact caused by
the COVID-19 pandemic in the first days of the national quarantine ordered by the
national authorities in Argentina which banned all small or large social gatherings,
outdoor sport activities, closing parks, all non-essential businesses including banks, and
restricting public transportation to only essential workers. For this purpose, our study
was rapidly conducted after 5-7 days of quarantine. The levels of depression and

anxiety in a nationwide sample of the Argentine population were studied using
standardized self-report questionnaires together with other related quantitative and
qualitative variables that may be related with mood and emotional variations. As a
unique element of our sample, the preventive and compulsory social isolation was
established in Argentina when there were still few confirmed COVID-19 cases
compared to other countries (see Table 1). During the days of the survey the number of
cases grew from 301 (or 6.66 per million) to 589 (or 13.03 per million) meanwhile the
deaths augmented from 4 (0.09 per million) to 12 (0.27 per million). Because of that,
the results of this study may help to understand the very early affective reaction to the
pandemic and related preventive strategies.
As another cultural distinctive trait, Argentines may be particularly susceptible to
the effects of social isolation given how much they may prefer close contact; one study
showed they prefer the closest distance to strangers and acquaintances during
conversations out of 42 nationalities (Sorokowska et al, 2017; see Table 1). There are
several Argentine close-contact customs that suddenly became dangerous and were
disrupted such as the customary cheek kiss when greeting any gender or the custom of
drinking a local tea called mate which is generally shared (e.g., at home or at work)
using the same cup and straw. We assumed that the combined effect of fear of pandemic
and quarantine restrictions would have a significant and rapid impact among
Argentines, especially in more vulnerable groups. We hypothesized that the perceived
threat, perceived risk of transmission, daily stress, negative repetitive thinking, and
feelings of loneliness would be associated with higher affective impact in the first days
of the quarantine and we expected younger and older groups to be the most affected.

Methods
Participants
This report is based on a sample of 10,053 individuals from Argentina over the
age of 18. Gender was reduced to three main categories: female, male, and non-binary.
Education profile was segmented into four categories considering the national education
system (see Table 2 for details). The family's basic income was asked in monthly
Argentine pesos and converted to three categories (low, medium, and high income). As
social media platforms were part of the main delivery system, all participants gave their
informed consent asserting to know their privacy would be protected following the
Declaration of Helsinki and national laws.

Instruments
A survey was designed to evaluate different variables associated with the
psychological impact of the pandemic and quarantine. The survey included two
standardized questionnaires to assess the severity of symptoms of the depressive and
anxious series:
Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). The PHQ-9 is a brief self-report scale
composed of nine items based on the DSM-IV criteria for the diagnosis of major
depressive episode. It has been developed to assess the presence and severity of
depressive symptoms in primary care and in the community and to establish a tentative
diagnosis of a depressive episode. The Argentine version of PHQ-9 (Urtasun et al.,
2019) had high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.87) and satisfactory
convergent validity with the BDI-II scale [Pearson's r= 0.88 (p < 0.01)]. The cut-off
points established by Urtasun et al. (2019) were used to evaluate the possible diagnosis
of depression and the ranges of severity in the present study. A score of 8 or more

indicated a possible diagnosis of major depression according to DSM-IV. The cut off
points for severity ranges were 6–8 for mild cases, 9–14 for moderate, and 15 or more
for severe depressive symptoms respectively.
Generalized anxiety disorder-7 (GAD-7). The GAD-7 is a brief 7-item selfreport questionnaire designed to identify probable cases of generalized anxiety disorder
and to assess the severity of symptoms. GAD-7 also proved to have good sensitivity and
specificity as a screener for panic, social anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder
(Kroenke et al. 2008). The original version of the questionnaire (Spitzer et al., 2006)
showed very high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.92) and satisfactory
convergent validity with the Beck Anxiety scale [r= 0.72(p < 0.01)] and with the anxiety
subscale of the Symptom Checklist-90 (r = 0.74). The Spanish version for Argentina of
the GAD-7 was used in this case (downloaded from:
https://www.phqscreeners.com/select-screener). The GAD-7 was utilized in previous
studies in Argentina (Gargoloff et al., 2016) and showed a high internal consistency for
the sample of the present study (Cronbach's alpha = 0.90). To establish the severity
levels of the current sample, the cut-off points were used according to Spitzer et al.
(2006). Accordingly, scores of 5, 10, and 15 were taken as the cut-off points for mild,
moderate and severe anxiety, respectively. A score of 10 or greater was considered as
indicative of the presence of a possible anxiety disorder.
Sociodemographic characteristics: Potentially relevant general characteristics
such as age, gender, family income, and level of education were surveyed. Furthermore,
being in current treatment for a previous mental health condition was asked as a proxy
for a potential pre-existing disorder.
COVID-19’s perception and attitudes towards quarantine: The survey also
included questions created ad hoc to evaluate variables related to the pandemic and

quarantine. Perception of threat of COVID-19 and perception of the risk of transmission
were explored as single dimensions in a scale from 0 (“not at all”) to 10 (“extreme”).
Attitudes toward quarantine were evaluated considering three self-reported
dimensions: adherence to the measure (“yes, no, partially”), agreement with the norm
(from 0 “not at all” to 10 “completely agree”), and trust about its effectiveness as a
preventive health tool (from 0 “not at all effective” to 10 “very effective”).
Daily stress. Impact in daily life was assessed within five domains: work,
household chores, physical exercise, leisure, activities with children, and relationship
with other adults. For each of the areas, the participants had to rate how difficult it was
for them to carry out the daily activities compared to the moments prior to quarantine
(from very difficult to very easy). A general index of daily stress was calculated
summing up the scores of each of the six domains assessed (with a score of -2 for “very
difficult”, -1 for “difficult”, 0 for “neutral”, 1 for “easy”, and 2 for “very easy”). As a
result, the index varies from -12 (more negative daily stress scenario) to 12 (more
positive daily stress scenario).
Feelings of loneliness. Loneliness was measured as a single dimension asking
participants to report how lonely they feel from 0 (‘Not at all’) to 10 (‘Extremely’) in
the last week.
Negative repetitive thinking. As stated by Ehring and Watkins (2008)
individuals with emotional disorders usually report excessive and repetitive thinking
about their current concerns, problems, past experiences, or worries about the future. In
the current study, we explored this dimension by assessing the presence of an increased
number of negative thoughts related with past, future, or interpersonal concerns since
the beginning of the quarantine. For each of these options there was a categorical

11
(yes/no) answer. Negative repetitive thinking was considered present when at least one
of the options was selected.

Procedures
The survey was distributed through different social media networks (Facebook,
Twitter, Instagram, WhatsApp) and through email. The questionnaire was enabled on
03/24/2020 and the recruitment of the present sample was completed in 32 hours. The
official start of the national quarantine in Argentina was established at 0:00 on
03/20/20, so the responses obtained correspond to a period of between 5 and 7 days of
isolation.

Statistical Analysis
Comparisons between groups were made using one-way ANOVA followed by
Tukey’s HSD or Tamhane 2 for post hoc comparisons when appropriate. Correlations
between measures were carried out by using the Pearson correlation coefficient with
Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons using α = 0.05. When analyzing
categorical variables, the Pearson chi-square test was used. Multiple linear regression
was employed to develop explanatory models for the two main dependent variables
(depression and anxiety).

Results
Sociodemographic characteristics
The mean age of participants was 44.55 years (SD= 11.52; min= 18, max= 84).
Female gender was the most representative (83.4 %) and few cases reported a nonbinary gender identification or preferred not to answer (0.3 %). There were participants

from all of the country’s provinces. The sample was well distributed across income
levels. Regarding education, even if all ranks were represented, there was a tendency
towards over-representing the higher levels (see details in Table 2). A smaller
proportion of the participants (15.8%) stated that they were under psychological or
psychiatric treatment for a previous mental health condition.

Perception of COVID-19 and attitudes toward the quarantine
Regarding COVID-19’s threat perception (see Table 2), most participants selected
high (45.2 %) and medium (28.4 %) ratings, while very high (18.2%) and low (8.2 %)
were the less frequent responses. When segmented by ages, an opposite pattern was
found between youngest and oldest participants. Perception of COVID-19 threat was
rated as very low by 19.7 % of participants of 18-25 range, meanwhile only 6% of them
perceived a very high threat. In contrast, 34.6% of elders (65+) perceived threat of
COVID-19 as very high, and only 1.9% estimated a very low threat.
In the case of perceived risk of transmission, medium (36.9 %) and high (38.3 %)
ratings were the most frequent responses for the whole sample, followed by very low
(14.1%), and very high risk (10.7 %). Segmented by age, risk of transmission results
presented a similar trend than perceived risk, but with milder differences (see Table 2).
Attitudes towards quarantine in the early stage of confinement were highly
positive across the three dimensions for all age groups (see Table 2). Most participants
perceived themselves as compliant with the quarantine (94.5%), most agreed with its
implementation (98.5% selected high and very high ratings), and most perceived
quarantine as an efficacious intervention for controlling pandemics (98.4% with high
and very high ratings).

Daily life stress
Ratings of subjective difficulty while doing daily life activities during quarantine
showed that 49% of participants find difficult or very difficult to do work duties,
followed by exercise (48.1 %) and leisure activities (31.8%) as the more difficult tasks
to perform. Household chores, activities with children and relationships with other
adults were perceived as less difficult (Table 3).
Considering stress when leaving home, 43.6 % of the total sample reported high
and extreme levels of stress, followed by a 20.4 % that rated medium, 10.9 % low and
25 % very low stress.

Psychological impact
Depressive symptoms. PHQ-9's score analysis revealed that 53.0 % of
responders did not show depressive symptoms, followed by 18.5 % that showed mild,
18.1 % moderate and 10.5 % severe symptoms (Table 4). Moderate and severe
symptoms together reached 28.6 % of the total sample. Divided into age subgroups, the
18-25 group was the most depressed with 52.4 % of participants reporting moderate and
severe scores, followed by 25-44 with 29.5 %, then 45-64 with 21.9 and 65+ with 15.1
%. Considering the cutoff score of the PHQ-9 in Argentina (>8), it was found that a
33.7% of the sample reached the level for the possible diagnosis of a major depressive
episode. In contrast, when analyzing the number of symptoms required for the diagnosis
according to DSM-V, an 8.8% of participants met the criteria of 5 or more symptoms,
including depressed mood or loss of interest. Regarding specific symptoms, 8.3% of the
sample reported suicidal thoughts (item 9), meanwhile the most frequent symptoms
were poor appetite or overeating (item 5 reported by 31.3% of the sample) and trouble

falling or staying asleep, or sleeping too much (item 3 reported by 25.4% of the
sample).
Between groups comparison (one-way ANOVA) showed that participants in
current mental health treatment had significantly higher levels of depression
(F(1.10048) = 221.30, p < .001, ç2 = .022). However, participants without current
treatment also exhibited elevated rates of depressive symptomatology, since 31.4% of
them scored above the cut-off for a possible diagnosis of depression and 26.2% rated
moderate and severe levels of depressive symptomatology.
There were also differences in depression scores between age groups (F(3,10049)
= 142.65, p < .001, ç2 = .041). Post-hoc comparisons showed differences between the
four groups (18-25 > 26-45 > 46-64 > 65+). As well, female participants were more
depressed than males (F(1,10021) = 80.99, p < .001, ç2 = .008). Finally significant
differences in depression scores between income groups were found (F(2,10047) =
67.58, p < .001, ç2 = .013). Post-hoc comparisons revealed differences between the three
groups (low > medium > high; p < .001).
Anxiety severity. GAD-7's ratings revealed that 45.1 % of participants showed no
anxiety symptoms, 31.6 presented mild symptoms, followed by a 38.4 % with moderate
and an 8.1 % with severe symptoms (Table 4). Divided in age subgroups, the 18-25
range was the most anxious (34.8 % with moderate or severe symptoms), followed by
25-44 (25.2 %), 45-64 (17.6 %) and 65+ (13.2 %). Regarding the cut-off for a possible
anxiety disorder, 23.2% of participants showed scores of 10 or greater, suggesting the
need for further evaluation. As in the case of depression, being on current treatment for
a mental health condition (F(1,10048) = 229.072, p < .001, ç2 = .022) and being a
woman (F(1,10021) = 103.91, p < .001, ç2 = .010) were associated with higher levels of
anxiety. Comparison between income groups revealed significant differences in anxious

15
scores (F(2,10047) = 14.42, p < .001, ç2 = .003). Post-hoc comparisons revealed
differences between the three groups (low > medium = high; p < .001).
Feeling of loneliness. 65.4 % of the total sample did not feel lonely during the
first days of the quarantine, while a 14.4% rated medium, 13.8 % high and 6.3%
extreme loneliness feelings. More intense feelings of loneliness appeared in groups of
18-25 (28.8 % in high and extreme ratings) and 65+ (20.7 %).
Negative repetitive thinking. 65.3% of the total sample expressed at least one
kind of negative repetitive thinking during the first days of quarantine. This group had
significantly more depressive (F(1,10051) = 1294.045, p < .001, ç2 = .114) and anxiety
symptoms (F(1,10051) = 1677.678, p < .001, ç2 = .143) than the group without negative
repetitive thinking.

Association between psychological variables
Correlation analysis found several significant associations between relevant
variables (Table 5). Age was negatively associated with depression (r = -.199, p < .01).
Loneliness feelings were positively associated with both depression and anxiety (r =
.424, p < .01 and r = .357, p < .01 respectively). Daily stress index was negatively
correlated with depression (r = -.332, p < .01) and anxiety (r = -.305, p < .01), being a
more negative index a signal of higher stress. Perceived threat was positively associated
with age (r = .265, p < .01) and perceived risk of transmission (r = .467, p < .01).
Perceived risk of transmission was also correlated with anxiety (r = .177; p < .01).
Finally, stress when leaving home was correlated with anxiety (r = .266, p < .01),
perceived threat (r = .209, p < .01), and perceived risk of transmission (r = .219, p <

Explanatory models of depression and anxiety
A multiple linear regression analysis was carried to evaluate the explanatory role
of the different variables over depression and anxiety. A significant regression model
for depression was found (F = 610.229, p < .01, R2 =.327) with feeling of loneliness,
daily stress, negative repetitive thinking, age, gender, current mental health treatment,
perceived risk of transmission, and family income as significant independent variables.
The three main variables (feeling of loneliness, daily stress, and negative repetitive
thinking) explained 28.8% of variance in depressive symptoms, meanwhile the rest of
the variables explained the remaining 3.9%.
In the case of anxiety, a significant regression model was found (F = 535.288, p <
.01, R2 =.298) with negative repetitive thinking, feeling of loneliness, daily stress,
perceived risk, age, gender, current mental health treatment, and perceived threat as
variables. The three main variables (negative repetitive thinking, feeling of loneliness,
and daily stress) explained 26% of variance in depressive symptoms, meanwhile the rest
of the variables explained the remaining 3.8%.

Discussion
This study aimed to quickly measure the early affective impact of the COVID-19
pandemic and of the mitigation strategies based on social isolation. Despite only having
spent a few days in quarantine, a noticeable impact on the mood and anxiety of the
participants was observed. A striking 33.7% of the sample overpassed the cut-off
criteria for the possible diagnosis of major depression recently reported in Argentina
(Urtasun et al., 2019) and a 23.7% of participants scored above the cut-off for clinical
anxiety (Spitzer et al., 2006). These figures are larger than expected according to
previous epidemiological studies in Argentina. A recent national representative

community survey found a twelve-month prevalence of 5.7% for any mood disorder and
of 9.4% for any anxiety disorder (Stagnaro et al., 2018). Another study in two cities of
Argentina employing the PHQ-9 found a prevalence of major depressive episodes of
5.6% (4.2% for men and 7.0% for women) and 9.5% (5.1 for men and 13.6% for
women) respectively (Daray et al., 2017). Despite negative emotionality was usually
reported in previous epidemics and pandemics (Shultz, Baingana, & Neria, 2015;
Taylor, 2019), the severity in the first stages of the confinement and the scale of the
impact in large populations should be considered a novelty. Furthermore, our results
confirm the findings reported in different cultural contexts affected by the COVID-19
pandemic (Wang et al., 2020; Mazza et al., 2020; González-Sanguino et al., 2020) but
this study is unique in that there were very few COVID-19 cases during the survey (301
or 6.66 per million – 589 or 13.03 per million). We can interpret these findings as an
indication of a very early anticipatory fear reaction and as the consequence of the
sudden disruption of normalcy provoked by the start of a very strict and national-wide
quarantine.
However, a note should be made about the interpretation of self-reported scores of
depression and anxiety in the context of the present study. It is recognized that selfreport methods may overestimate the rate of psychiatric disorders in comparison with
the more reliable gold standard of diagnostic interviews. A recent meta-analysis about
the use of the PHQ-9 for the screening of major depressive episodes in primary care
found that approximately half of patients with positive screens could be false positives
(Levis et al., 2019). In fact, in the current study when we considered the number of
symptoms required for the diagnosis of major depression instead of the cut-off score,
the rate of participants that met the criteria decreased to an 8.8%. Therefore, it is highly
probable that many of the states reported by affected participants would correspond to

adjustment disorders or other transitory manifestations of troubled affect, instead of a
major depressive disorder or an anxiety disorder. According to DSM-V (APA, 2013),
the presence of emotional or behavioral symptoms in response to an identifiable stressor
is the essential feature of adjustment disorders. Stressors may affect large groups or
entire communities, as is the case of COVID-19, and the onset of symptoms may appear
within a few days of the occurrence of the stressor, as revealed in the current study. The
duration of distress is relatively brief (a few months) but if the stressor or its
consequences persist, the adjustment disorder may adopt a more persistent form (APA,
2013). Hence, the main findings of this survey and other similar investigations
worldwide could be considered in a dimensional frame. From this perspective, a big
environmental stressor with an abrupt beginning such as the COVID-19 pandemic and
subsequent quarantine may have an immediate effect over affective states of the
population in a continuum that goes from normative stress reactions to anxiety disorders
or major depression, going through intermediate and transitory forms such as
adjustment disorders. Thus, the observed results of anxiety and depressive
symptomatology could be considered the overall emotional cost of the forced and fast
adaptation to the new hazardous circumstances.
Another important finding was that the youngest participants were affected most,
with an inverse relationship between age and emotional symptoms. We can venture
different hypotheses to explain this result. On the one hand, young people may feel
more limited in their active social life and show more blatant need for contact and
physical activity than older age groups. The sudden restriction may have implied a
relatively bigger change on the lifestyle and routines for younger people. On the other
hand, since they have a lower perception of threat and feel less susceptible to COVID19 than the other groups, it is possible that the cost-benefit ratio of the measures were

19
perceived as more disadvantageous for them. The distance between perceived risk and
the preventive measures taken may produce a sound cognitive dissonance. In our
sample, however, the rate of self-reported adherence to such measures was very high for
young participants. Hence, we can hypothesize that compliance occurred at expense of a
high emotional cost. Simultaneously, this high adherence among young adults may have
been caused by the fear of transmitting COVID-19 to older populations, which could –
along with possible economy related anxiety and domestic-stress related stress– explain
higher levels of anxiety observed in younger adults. Conversely, since older people feel
more vulnerable, they may have strong personal motivations to accept restrictions and
therefore they could assimilate them at a lower emotional cost. Furthermore, we can
assume that the group of older adults who completed the online survey is an active
group connected to others through technology, which could operate in some cases as a
protective factor for loneliness (Nowland, Necka & Cacioppo, 2018). This would
especially apply to the +65 group that showed a lower level of impact than expected.
Among the activities most affected by quarantine were work and physical activity.
Difficulties in accommodating work to exceptional circumstances could have operated
as a stressor that worsened people's psychological adjustment to quarantine. For its part,
physical activity is a powerful stimulant that exerts a positive and sustained effect on
mood, as witnessed by its use for the treatment of depression (Biddle, 2016). Therefore,
we can speculate that restrictions on physical activity may have contributed to the
observed effects on mood and anxiety. Again, the lack of physical activity may have
had a stronger negative impact in younger people.
Regarding gender differences, women showed significantly higher depression
scores than men. Even though it is a well-known fact that women have an increased
incidence of depression and anxiety disorders (see Stagnaro et al., 2018 for gender

differences in prevalence rates in Argentina), contextual factors could interact in the
present circumstances. Daily stress may have been incremented for many women in
charge of household chores and child care in parallel with home-based work (Unicef,
2020).
Another component associated with depression and anxiety was the presence of a
previous treatment for mental health problems. As noted in other studies related to
COVID-19, a pre-existing mood or anxiety disorder is associated with increased levels
of psychological distress (Asmundson et al., 2020; van Roekel et al., 2020). However,
in the current study the psychological impact was also substantial in many of the
participants who did not report being in treatment for a previous condition. Therefore,
the existence of pre-existing psychological or psychiatric difficulties could act as an
aggravating factor, but it does not explain the impact observed in the total sample.
Similarly, participants belonging to a low-income group appeared to be more vulnerable
to the impact of the stressor.
From a theoretical point of view, the obtained pattern of results seems to support
social and behavioral theories of depression. The drastic reduction of social contact may
have increased negative feelings and negative emotionality (Joiner, 1999; Lewinsohn,
Gotlib, & Seeley, 1997). Congruently, feelings of loneliness appeared as the most
important factor associated with emotional symptoms as evidenced in the multiple
regression model, above other psychological variables such as the fear of transmission
or the symptoms attributed to the disease. This finding confirms the importance of this
social element in the regulation of mood as different studies have been showing
worldwide (Cacioppo & Cacioppo, 2018; Nowland, Necka, & Cacioppo, 2018; van
Roekel et al., 2018). Moreover, the circumstances created by the pandemic conveyed a
considerable decrease of rewarding experiences and provoked a general reduction of

21
behavioral activity in the population which also have been associated to emotional
problems (Carvalho & Hopko, 2011; Kasch, Rottenberg, Arnow, & Gotlib, 2002).
Sadness and depression are common responses to loss and negative life events. High
levels of depressive symptoms may result from the experience of concrete losses such
as social proximity, gathering, fitness activities, reduced income, and interrupted
routines in general, among other reduced sources of reward. As shown by classic
behavioral models (Lewinson, 1975), the COVID-19 pandemic as a salient
environmental stressor disturbed normal behavioral patterns and routines, which in turn
altered the balance between rewards and punishments, provoked social isolation,
increased self-focus and negative repetitive thinking, and then was expressed as
negative affect. Further worsening or maintenance of negative affective reactions will
depend on the persistence of the stressors and on the co-occurrence of additional risk
factors such as pre-existent mental health disorders or other socio-economic
vulnerabilities.
Regarding anxiety symptoms, the concept of health anxiety has been invoked as a
potentially useful framework for conceptualizing reactions to pandemics (Asmundson &
Taylor, 2020). A large-scale textual analysis of posts from mental health forums on
Reddit showed a significant increase in health anxiety topics during COVID-19 and
showed support groups for different disorders becoming more linguistically similar to
the support group for health anxiety (Low et al., 2020). Health anxiety refers to the
tendency to become alarmed by illness related stimuli. People with excessively high
levels of health anxiety, compared to less anxious people, are more afraid about
perceived health threats and more concerned with the likelihood and seriousness of
becoming ill (Taylor, 2019). In agreement with this view, we found that levels of
anxiety, perceived susceptibility to transmission, perceived threat, and stress when

leaving home were intertwined variables. Also, our study confirms the central role that
repetitive negative thinking plays in explaining anxiety as well as depressive symptoms
(Drost et al., 2014; Spinhoven et al., 2018). Notably alongside repetitive negative
thinking, feelings of loneliness, and daily stress also explained depressive and anxiety
manifestations, suggesting shared transdiagnostic roots between the two target
conditions (Dalgleish et al., 2020; Krueger & Eaton, 2015).
The present study has several limitations. First, the survey was disseminated
incidentally. Nevertheless, all of the country’s regions were sampled and the most
important urban conglomerates where 80% of Argentine population lives represented
87% of the sample. Second, as noted previously, self-report measures have limited
reliability for making diagnosis. It is important to prudentially consider these present
results and to avoid jumping to clinical conclusions. Complementary and more precise
procedures should be adopted to confirm or reject any assumption of diagnosis. Third,
our sample was unbalanced in gender with female being overrepresented over other
options. As we mentioned before, female gender is associated with increased rates of
anxiety and depression in epidemiological studies, so sampling bias may have inflated
the global figures of our whole study. Fourth, while we intended to measure early
emotional reactions, further assessments should establish if the observed impact
remains, increases, or decreases during longer periods of time. Fifth, due to the
observational nature of the study, it is not possible to disentangle the effects produced
by the pandemic itself from the impact of the quarantine, although COVID-19 cases
were low during this survey. Thus the results should be interpreted as the consequences
of the combination of the two factors.
Against these limitations, a series of strengths of the study should be mentioned:
the large sample size, a short-time reaction survey ran within 32 hours just 5 days after

23
the start of a nationally implemented rigorous quarantine in a country with low infection
rate, a considerable representativeness at the national level, an adequate distribution
according to family income, and the use of standardized instruments for measuring the
main outcomes.
In closing, we can assert that the psychological impact observed in the present
study due to the COVID-19 pandemic and quarantine may have policy implications. To
mitigate the consequences of the current circumstances and of future similar events,
different actions would be needed: 1) early identification and monitoring of people and
groups at risk of incidents related with their mental health; 2) implementation of multilevel interventions for the identified persons and groups; 3) interventions aimed at
connecting and supporting isolated people who may experience strong feelings of
loneliness such as volunteer systems for the elderly; 4) recommendations and measures
to mitigate the stress generated by abnormal work circumstances with a gender
perspective; 5) strengthen communication and interventions directed to reduce the
emotional costs of the younger population. Regarding mental health interventions, it
will be important to explore the use of combined transdiagnostic treatments given the
general rise in anxiety and depressive symptoms (Newby et al., 2015; Martin et al.,
2018; Dalgleish et al., 2020).
In conclusion, our findings indicate that we can expect a rapid affective reaction at
population scale when a large environmental stressor invokes a generalized increase of
health anxiety and profoundly disturbs daily routines and social dynamics. Since the
pandemic suddenly altered the pre-existent sense of normalcy of an entire population, a
big affective shock seems to be the most natural adaptive reaction.

Results from a Google Scholar search [allintitle:("covid 19"+("mental health"|psychiatry)+survey)] which
returned 52 studies and we excluded studies that were unpublished (N=33) or that have imprecise survey
dates (N=3). Surveys are ranked by data collection start date. Qiu et al (2020) also included participants
from Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan and Asmundson et al. (2020) included participants from Canada,
but these studies did not specify the proportion of participants from each country surveyed, therefore we
report values for the countries with the largest population (China and the United States, respectively).
COVID-19 cases and deaths are obtained from ourworldindata.org (source: European CDC).
Interpersonal contact rank is how each country ranks regarding their preferred interpersonal distance
during conversation with strangers out of 42 countries from Sorokowska (2017).
