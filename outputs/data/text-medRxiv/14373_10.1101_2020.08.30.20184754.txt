Abstract
The role of temperature in Covid 19 pandemic has been subjected to frequent review. An effort
was made to find out such relations from three districts in India. Data were analyzed for 14
weeks. It appears that temperature could impact the spread of the pandemic.

Impact of temperature on Covid 19 in India
The role of temperature in Coronavirus Disease 19 (Covid 19) pandemic has been examined in
different parts of the world, including India. (Li et al., 2020; Luo et al., 2020; Roy, 2020)
However, such observation for a long period is not common in Indian literature. One multicentric study discussed the changes between March to May 2020 from six cities in India and
found a positive relationship between temperature and Covid 19. (Kumar, 2020) However, the
relation during the rainy season is yet to be documented. Therefore, the present analysis tried to
find out the impact of temperature on Covid 19, taking account of the rainy season.
For analysis, three districts from different parts of India were considered – Kolkata (east),
Bhopal (central), and urban Bengaluru (south). Till 17th August, Kolkata, Bhopal, and
Bengaluru recorded more than 32,867 cases; 8462 cases, and 94,106 cases, respectively. Data
were retrieved from the website of State Governments. (Govt. of West Bengal, Govt. of Madhya
Pradesh, Govt. of Karnataka) The period 5th May – 17th August 2020 was considered. Daily
maximum and minimum temperatures were taken into account. (AccuWeather) The difference
between the maximum and minimum temperature, termed as Daily Temperature Range (DTR)
was also included. These three parameters were compared with daily new positive cases. The
correlation coefficient was calculated. Taking a lag period of one week, a similar exercise was
done again. Where data were missing, an average of two days was taken for plotting the graphs.
Fig 1 shows a comparison of three districts in terms of the rise in daily new Covid cases.
Bengaluru witnessed a disproportionate rise from the last week of June. It seems that the
epidemic is experiencing a plateau now in Kolkata and Bhopal.

The weekly growth rate was also plotted against the time frame. (Fig 2) Interestingly, it was
noted that Bengaluru witnessed sharp peaks and falls before settling around one from mid-July.
For Bhopal, the growth rate has been well below one from the 1st part of August. For Kolkata,
from a peak of 1.5 at May-end, the growth rate came down by June-end, only to rise again to 1.6
within two weeks, followed by a gradual decline to less than one, suggesting a decline.
From Table 1-3, it is evident that maximum temperature and DTR share negative relationships
with the pandemic, suggesting a rise in any of these two factors will reduce the spread. In the
case of Bengaluru, the maximum temperature recorded a strong negative correlation with the
number of new Covid cases (r = – 0.765). The extent of impact remained almost similar after
taking a lag period of one week. Except for Kolkata, minimum temperature cast a negative
influence on the spread of Covid 19.
The country witnessed lockdown till 31st May 2020. Even after that, the State Governments
imposed lockdown from time to time. It could have impacted different patterns of the epidemic
in different districts. Another reason between three districts could be explained partially by
varying testing rates. While for Karnataka, where Bengaluru is located, it is 36,066/million, it is
15,728/ million for West Bengal, where Kolkata is and 14,088/million for Madhya Pradesh,
where Bhopal is located. The higher testing rate could be an explanation for the higher
concentration of cases at Bengaluru. (COVID19INDIA) There has been a gradual rise in the
number of tests being done per day across the country. It is expected that with time, surveillance
has become better. The rise in the number of cases is thus expected with time.
The present study supports the pattern when a reduction in maximum temperature encourages
viral transmission but a strong relationship (r > 0.7) could not be found except in Bengaluru.

DTR seems to have a moderate to strong influence on the number of daily cases. An analysis
from multiple cities in China could not demonstrate any effect of mean temperature on the
number of daily cases when the temperature is above 3°C. (Xie et al, 2020) It is assumed that
summer and rainy season is not going to have much impact on slowing down the pandemic in
India. (Kumar, 2020) There is a need for an in-depth analysis to examine whether any
convincing relationship exists between temperature and the present Covid 19 pandemic. Several
other factors like migration, containment policy, adherence to lockdown, and personal hygiene
may impact the course of the pandemic. All these should be taken into account while conducting
future studies on weather and Covid pandemic.
