Abstract
The coronaviruses responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), COVID-19
(SARS-CoV-2), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), and other coronavirus
infections express a nucleocapsid protein (N) that is essential for viral replication, transcription,
and virion assembly. Phosphorylation of N from SARS-CoV by glycogen synthase kinase 3
(GSK-3) is required for its function and inhibition of GSK-3 with lithium impairs N
phosphorylation, viral transcription, and replication. Here we report that the SARS-CoV-2 N
protein contains GSK-3 consensus sequences and that this motif is conserved in diverse
coronaviruses, despite limited overall sequence conservation, raising the possibility that SARSCoV-2 may be sensitive to GSK-3 inhibitors including lithium. We conducted a retrospective
analysis of lithium use in patients from three major health systems who were PCR tested for
SARS-CoV-2. We found that patients taking lithium have a significantly reduced risk of COVID19 (odds ratio = 0.51 [0.34 - 0.76], p = 0.001). We also show that the SARS-CoV-2 N protein is
phosphorylated by GSK-3. Knockout of GSK3A and GSK3B demonstrates that GSK-3 is
essential for N phosphorylation. Alternative GSK-3 inhibitors block N phosphorylation and impair
replication in SARS-CoV-2 infected lung epithelial cells in a cell-type dependent manner.
Targeting GSK-3 may therefore provide a new approach to treat COVID-19 and future
coronavirus outbreaks.

Introduction
COVID-19 is exacting a severe toll on personal and community health, healthcare systems, and
the global economy. The response to this crisis will require multiple approaches for detection,
prevention, and treatment. With three major b-coronavirus epidemics in less than 20 years, it
would also be prudent to anticipate new coronavirus outbreaks in the future. In addition to
development of effective vaccines, antiviral strategies that target conserved mechanisms in
coronavirus replication and transmission may be needed for COVID-19 and potential future
coronavirus outbreaks. Recent high throughput screens have identified bioactive compounds
that impair viral replication and infectivity in tissue culture models of infection by the severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronvavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)1-5. However, their mechanisms of
action and their clinical efficacy remain to be fully delineated and additional targets may be
needed to combat SARS-CoV-2, new SARS-CoV-2 variants, and potential novel coronavirus
outbreaks in the future.

Coronaviruses express a nucleocapsid (N) protein that is essential for viral replication,
transcription, and assembly6-10. N proteins from the JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV)
and from SARS-CoV, which caused the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak, are phosphorylated by
glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) within an arginine-serine (RS) domain present in N
proteins of diverse coronaviruses7-9,11-14. Phosphorylation of the JHMV N protein is required for
recruitment of the RNA helicase DDX1 and for transcription of long subgenomic RNAs8;
inhibition of GSK-3 impairs recruitment of DDX1, binding to viral mRNAs, and viral replication. N
protein from SARS-CoV and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) physically interact with GSK-39,15
and knockdown of GSK3 impairs IBV replication in Vero cells15. Furthermore, lithium, which
inhibits GSK-316 and is widely used in the treatment of bipolar disorder17,18, impairs replication of
diverse coronaviruses including SARS-CoV, IBV, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), and
transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV)7,9,19-24.

These observations suggest that inhibition of GSK-3 could impair coronavirus infections in vivo,
including COVID-1925-27. A recent phosphoproteomic analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2 N
protein is highly phosphorylated within the RS domain1, but whether GSK-3 phosphorylates
SARS-CoV-2 N protein and whether lithium has any effect against SARS-CoV-2 have not yet
been tested. Here we show that GSK-3 is essential for phosphorylation of the SARS-CoV-2 N
protein, that alternative GSK-3 inhibitors impair N phosphorylation and SARS-CoV-2 infection in
human lung epithelial cells, and that litihum therapy is associated with significantly reduced risk
of COVID-19. Targeting GSK-3 may therefore provide an antiviral therapy for COVID-19 and for
coronavirus infections that may arise in the future.

Results
Phosphorylation of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein by GSK-3 at two conserved
consensus sites
The SARS-CoV N protein shares 20–30% sequence identity with the N proteins of other
coronaviruses6, and despite the limited sequence similarity, they each have an arginine-serine
rich (RS) domain that lies between N-terminal and C-terminal conserved domains6. The RS
domains of N from SARS-CoV and JHMV include repeated motifs (SXXXS)9 that are frequently
associated with GSK-3 phosphorylation, in which the C-terminal serine is phosphorylated by a
priming kinase28, which then allows GSK-3 to phosphorylate multiple serines or threonines
spaced 4 residues apart in the C to N terminal direction (Fig. 1A). The sequence of the RS
domain of SARS-CoV-2 N is 90% similar to N from SARS-CoV, and both proteins contain two
sets of three SXXXS motifs each (labeled “a” and “b” in Fig. 1A and 1B). While the N protein
sequences of other coronaviruses diverge, they retain SXXXS motifs (Fig. 1B). In addition, the
fourth serine (presumed priming site) is always preceded by an arginine in the -3 position

(SRXXS). GSK-3-dependent phosphorylation of RS domains has also been reported for multiple
splicing factors and other RNA binding proteins29,30.

A recent phosphoproteomic analysis showed that the RS domain of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein
is highly phosphorylated1, but whether GSK-3 phosphorylates N protein from SARS-CoV-2 has
not been addressed. We expressed SARS-CoV-2 N in human embryonic kidney 293T cells (Fig.
1C) or mouse lung epithelial MLE12 cells (Figure S1A). N phosphorylation was demonstrated by
treating cell lysates with alkaline phosphatase, which increased the electrophoretic mobility of N,
as observed previously for SARS-CoV N protein8,9. Lithium chloride (LiCl) inhibited N
phosphorylation with IC50 ~10mM in 293T cells (Fig. 1C, S1B). Phosphorylation of the GSK-3
substrates Glycogen Synthase (GS; Fig. 1C) and ß-catenin (Fig. 2A, lanes 1-3) was also
inhibited with an IC50 ~ 10 mM. In contrast, the Ki for LiCl inhibition of GSK-3 in vitro is 1 mM31,32
and the effective in vivo concentration for Li+ inhibition of GSK-3 in mice and humans is also 1
mM33,34. The relatively high Li+ concentration needed to inhibit N phosphorylation ex vivo raises
the concern that Li+ may act through a target other than GSK-3. To examine this possibility
rigorously, we tested multiple, selective GSK-3 inhibitors, including bisindolylmaleimide I (BIM-I),
CHIR99021, AR-A014418, and Kenpaullone, all of which inhibited N phosphorylation in the low
µM range (Fig. 1D, S1C), strongly supporting that GSK-3 is essential for N protein
phosphorylation.

GSK-3 is required for N phosphorylation
However, these compounds, which inhibit GSK-3 by competing for ATP binding, may have offtarget effects. As an alternative and more definitive approach, we used siRNAs and
CRISPR/Cas9 to knockdown or knockout (KO) both GSK3A and GSK3B, which encode two
highly similar GSK-3 isoforms (GSK-3a and GSK-3b, respectively). KO of GSK3A alone had a
minimal effect on phosphorylation of N or b-catenin (Fig. 2A), consistent with redundant

functions of GSK3A and GSK3B35. However, siRNA knockdown of GSK3B in GSK3A KO cells
impaired N phosphorylation and increased the sensitivity to LiCl (Fig. 2A), with inhibition of N
phosphorylation detectable at 1 mM LiCl. Importantly, combined KO of GSK3A and GSK3B
completely prevented N protein phosphorylation (Fig. 2B). In the absence of GSK-3, LiCl had no
further effect on N protein mobility, showing that Li+ inhibits N phosphorylation solely through
inhibition of GSK-3. These pharmacological and genetic data demonstrate unequivocally that
GSK-3 is essential for phosphorylation of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein.

GSK-3 substrates that follow the SXXXS motif require a priming phosphorylation at the Cterminal serine or threonine36,37; mutation of this residue in established GSK-3 substrates
including glycogen synthase (GS) and b-catenin prevents phosphorylation of more N-terminal
serines and threonines by GSK-336,38. Similarly, mutation of the two putative priming sites in
SARS-CoV N blocks phosphorylation by GSK-39. To test whether the SARS-CoV-2 N protein
also requires priming site serines, we mutated serine-188 and serine-206 of SARS-CoV-2 N
protein to alanines (NS188A,S206A) and then expressed the single and double mutant N proteins in
HEK293T cells. The single mutant form NS188A migrates in the same position as phosphorylated
wild-type N protein whereas the NS206A migrates more rapidly, suggesting that it is
hypophosphorylated (Fig. 2C). Mobility of the NS188A,S206A protein is similar to dephosphorylated
N protein and is not affected by GSK-3 inhibition LiCl (Fig. 2C) or treatment with alkaline
phosphatase (Figure S2A). Additionally, both of the single serine to alanine mutants are more
sensitive to LiCl. These data indicate that GSK-3 phosphorylation of SARS-CoV-2 N protein
requires the canonical GSK-3 priming site serines.

Although our data show that GSK-3 is required for phosphorylation of N protein at a classical
GSK-3 consensus site, it remains formally possible that GSK-3 indirectly regulates N protein
phosphorylation. Pharmacological inhibition of GSK-3 also activates mTOR and downstream

pathways, including ribosomal protein S6 kinase, elF4E, and SR protein kinase-2 (SRPK2) 39,40.
SRPK1/2 regulate activity of serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins via phosphorylation of the
arginine/serine (RS)-repeat domains. Similar to GSK-3, SRPK1/2 tend to phosphorylate multiple
serines within a local domain in a processive manner, and SRPK1 can phosphorylate N in vitro
5,12

. To determine whether mTOR and SPRK1/2 are involved in N phosphorylation, HEK293T

cells expressing SARS-CoV2 N were treated with the mTOR inhibitor Rapamycin or the
SRPK1/2 inhibitor SRPIN340. Rapamycin treatment had no effect on N phosphorylation despite
potent inhibition of ribosomal protein S6 kinase phosphorylation (Figure S2B). The SRPK1/2
inhibitor SRPIN340, either alone or combined with LiCl, also did not affect N protein
phoshorylation at sites that affect electrophoretic mobility (Figure S2C).

To test whether GSK-3 directly phosphorylates N protein, we performed in vitro kinase assays
with recombinant GSK-3b and N protein purified by immunoprecipitation from HEK293T cells.
Use of N protein expressed in mammalian cells was important because the priming site will not
be phosphorylated in bacterially expressed recombinant protein and, without the priming
phosphorylation, the GSK-3 sites may not be phosphorylated. HEK293T cells expressing myctagged N were treated with the GSK-3 inhibitor LiCl and then immunoprecipitated. As shown in
Fig. 2D, N protein lacking phosphorlyation at the GSK-3 dependent sites migrates more rapidly
than phosphorlyated N (lane 5). Recombinant GSK-3b was then added to the
immunoprecipitate and the reaction was incubated for 30 minutes. N protein phosphorylated by
GSK-3 migrated with slower mobility (Fig. 2D, lane 6), similar to N protein from untreated cells.
N protein expressed in GSK-3 double knock out (DKO) 293T cells, immunoprecipitated, and
added to an in vitro kinase reaction was completely phosphorylated by recombinant GSK-3b
(Fig. 2E). These data demonstrate that GSK-3b directly phosphorylates N protein.

Inhibition of N phosphorylation by clinically well-tolerated GSK-3 inhibitors
The phosphorylation of a motif within an arginine-rich domain, and especially the high
conservation of arginine at the -3 position relative to the priming site (Fig. 1B), suggested that
the priming kinase may be an arginine-directed, or “basophilic”, protein kinase. We began to test
candidate kinases using inhibitors of MAP/ERK kinases (MEK1/2), casein kinase II (CKII),
calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, and protein kinase C (PKC). Although most inhibitors
we tested had no effect on N phosphorylation (data not shown), including the PKC inhibitor
Gö6976 (Figure S3B), the structurally related PKC inhibitors Enzastaurin, Sotrastaurin, and
Gö6983 did inhibit N phosphorylation (Fig. 3A and S3C). Unexpectedly, in addition to potently
inhibiting phosphorylation of endogenous PKC substrates induced by the PKC activator PMA
(Figure S3A), these bisindolylmaleimides also inhibited phosphorylation of the endogenous
GSK-3 substrate GS. To distinguish whether the inhibition of N phosphorylation was due to
inhibition of GSK-3 or inhibition of a priming phosphorylation by PKC, we knocked down
expression of PKC-a, PKC-d, and PKC-e, the major PKC isoforms expressed in HEK293T cells.
Single or combined knockdown of PKC had no effect on phosphorylation of N or GS (Figure
S3D). To confirm that Enzastaurin and Sotrastaurin directly inhibit GSK-3, we performed in vitro
kinase assays. Phosphorylation of the GSK-3 substrate tau and N protein was inhibited by
Enzastaurin and Sotrostaurin in vitro (Fig. 3B, 4C, and S3E), confiming that Enzastaurin and
Sotrastaurin are direct inhibitors of GSK-3, consistent with a prior report41.

GSK-3 inhibitors block replication in SARS-CoV2 infected cells
The GSK-3 inhibitors CHIR99021 and Enzastaurin were tested for antiviral efficacy (detection of
double stranded RNA or spike protein) and for their effects on cell viability at two institutions in
two lung epithelial cell lines (Calu-3 and A549-Ace2). Calu-3 cells were treated with drugs at
varying concentrations for 1 hour, inoculated with SARS-CoV-2, and cell number and the
percent of infected cells were quantified at 48 hours post infection (HPI). CHIR99021 inhibited

SARS-CoV-2 infection with an IC50 ~5uM in Calu-3 cells (Fig. 4A), with marked reduction in
frequency of infected cells at 10 µM (Fig. 4B). CHIR99021 inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in Calu-3
cells was similar in laboratories at the University of Pennsylvania and UCLA. CHIR98014, a
GSK-3 inhibitor that is structurally similar to CHIR99021, was also reported to inhibit SARSCoV-2 in A549-Ace2 cells at 5 µM 1, although we did not observe this effect in A549-Ace2 cells.
Similarly, previous work has shown that Enzastaurin inhibits SARS-CoV-2-mediated cytopathic
effect in Vero E6 cells at 250 nM 4 and reduces infection (based on qRT-PCR and viral titer) in
A549-Ace2 cells at 5 µM 1; however, we did not observe an effect of Enzastaurin in A549-Ace2
or Calu-3 cells. The reasons for the cell-type variability in these assays is unclear but has been
observed by others as well 1.

Reduced risk of COVID-19 in lithium-treated patients
As lithium is a GSK-3 inhibitor that is widely used to treat bipolar disorder, we asked whether
patients on lithium have a reduced risk of COVID-19 infection compared to the general
population. We included patient data from three health systems in the United States (Fig. 5):
121,589 individuals from the University of Pennsylvania Health System (UPHS), 115,073 from
Mount Sinai Medical Center (MSMC), and 102,420 from the University of Iowa Hospitals and
Clinics (UIHC) who were tested for COVID-19 by RT-PCR (Table 1) as of February 2021.
Among these participants, 8,856 (7.2%) patients had confirmed positive tests at UPHS, 10,597
(9.2%) at MSMC, and 16,170 (15.8%) at the UIHC. Across the three health systems, 7% of
patients taking lithium developed COVID-19 compared with 15% among the general population.
The average age of the patients who received lithium was between 42 – 48 years.

Given the potential confounding bias for COVID-19 susceptibility with the patient’s baseline
characteristics, propensity score matching was employed at each site. The matched cohort
resulted in 25 patients from UPHS, 50 patients from UIHC, and 10 patients from MSMC who

were on lithium treatment and tested positive for COVID-19 (Table 1). To increase the statistical
power, we pooled the data from three sites by conducting a meta-analysis using a random
effects model (Table 2). We found that patients on lithium had reduced risk of COVID-19
infection compared with nonusers (p-value= 0.001, OR=0.51 [0.34 - 0.76]). The test for
heterogeneity had low variance between the observations from three sites (Q statistic P = 0.45,
I = 50.3%). Additionally, a subgroup analysis among patients with bipolar disorder taking lithium
2

compared to nonusers of lithium was conducted. The association was not statistically significant
(p > 0.01). There were considerably fewer BPD patients tested for COVID-19 in our study
population which may have led to low statistical power to detect association.

Discussion
Medications that target common features of the coronavirus family could reduce the severity
and transmission of COVID-19 as well as other pathogenic coronaviruses. Our analysis of
retrospective EHR data on SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing from three major health systems across
the US showed a ~50% reduced risk of COVID-19 in patients taking lithium. We show that the
SARS-CoV-2 N protein is phosphorylated by GSK-3 and that lithium and other GSK-3 inhibitors
block N phosphorylation, as shown previously for JHMV and SARS-CoV9. We also show for the
first time that GSK-3 is unequivocally essential for N phosphorylation using GSK3A/B double
KO. Diverse GSK-3 inhibitors inhibit N phosphorylation and impair SARS-CoV-2 replication in
cell culture models. GSK-3 inhibition may therefore allow safe and effective therapy for COVID19. As we find GSK-3 consensus sites in the N proteins of diverse coronaviruses, GSK-3
inhibitors may also be effective antiviral therapy in other coronavirus infections, including those
that may arise in the future.

Lithium has a narrow therapeutic window, however, and the concentration needed to inhibit N
phosphorylation and to impair infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses in cell

culture7,9,19-24 is above the therapeutic range in humans (peak level ~2 mM, trough levels ~1
mM17) and the level that induces behavioral changes in model organisms. For example, 1 mM
lithium is sufficient to inhibit GSK-3 in humans34 and to alter GSK-3 dependent behaviors in
mice 33,42, whereas the IC50 for inhibition of N phosphorylation and inhibition of SARS-CoV2
replication in cultured cells is ~10 mM. It is not clear why higher concentrations were needed in
cell culture, but, given the narrow therapeutic window for lithium in BD, alternative GSK-3
inhibitors may be better tolerated in clinical settings involving coronavirus infection.

While the association of lithium therapy and reduced risk of COVID-19 across three health
systems is both signficant and intriguing, observational studies have many limitations. A variety
of factors with potential biases cannot be measured even after comparing the cases and
controls in a manner that accounts for known confounding factors using a rigorous matching
algorithm. For instance, details on medicine usage were derived from records of prescription
orders, but information on compliance before SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing is not available. In
addition, the collection of a non-random sample population can create a collider bias and lead to
distorted associations. For example, the COVID-19 test was restricted particularly in the early
pandemic to symptomatic patients so that many asymptomatic patients in the EHR were not
tested. These findings should therefore be interpreted carefully and deeper investigation is
required in a cohort with a larger sample size.

Prior work has shown that lithium and the GSK-3 inhibitor Kenpaullone inhibit N phosphorylation
and reduce viral titers in SARS-CoV and JHMV infected Vero6 cells8,9 and GSK3 knockdown
also impairs replication of IBV in Vero cells15. We also show that multiple small molecule GSK-3
inhibitors, including CHIR99021, BIM-I, AR-A014418, Enzastaurin, and Sotrastaurin block
SARS-CoV-2 phosphorylation. These pharmacological studies are compelling evidence that
GSK-3 is a critical host kinase for N protein, but these drugs may have off-target effects. Thus,

the complete abrogation of N phosphorylation by the double KO of GSK3A and GSK3B
demonstrates unequivocally that GSK-3 is essential for phosphorylation of N at these sites.

The highly selective GSK-3 inhibitor CHIR99021 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in the human
lung epithelium-derived cell line Calu-3, an observation that was reproducible in two
independent laboratories, and the related compound CHIR98014 was previously reported to
inhibit infection in the human lung cancer derived cell line A549-Ace21. Furthermore, the
clinically well tolerated drug Enzastaurin was reported to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in A549Ace2 cells1 and viral-mediated cytopathic effect in Vero E6 cells4. However, the effects of these
inhibitors has been variable in different cell lines and in different laboratories. For example,
Bouhaddou et al did not observe inhibition with Enzastaurin in Vero6 cells and we did not
observe inhibition with Enzastaurin in A549-Ace2 cells or Calu-3 cells. The reasons for this cell
type specific effect and variability between laboratories is unclear, but may include differences in
the expression and/or activity of targeted signaling pathways in different cell lines that may arise
as an adaptation to cell culture conditions and passage number. Nevertheless, it remains clear
that GSK-3 is essential for N phosphorylation, as GSK3 knockout abrogates N phosphorylation,
and given the essential functions of phosphorylated N in viral transcription, replication, and
packaging8, developing GSK-3 inhbitors that safely and effectively inhibit N phosphorylation is a
promising potential approach to controlling SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus infections that
may arise in the future.

We propose that inhibition of N phosphorylation underlies the antiviral activity of lithium and
other GSK-3 inhibitors; however GSK-3 also regulates inflammatory responses 43, and lithium
has been reported to have antiviral activity against other viruses, notably human herpes viruses
25

. Thus modulation of the inflammatory response by litihum may also contribute to the reduced

risk of COVID-19 in patients taking lithium.

The search for antiviral drugs that target coronaviruses is progressing rapidly. Multiple
bioinformatic analyses and high throughput screens have identified an array of promising
candidates with efficacy in cultured cells 1-3,5,44. Our approach is based on a clear mechanism,
utilizes clinically-tested and well-tolerated drugs that could be rapidly repurposed for COVID-19,
and is supported by clinical data showing an association between treatment with a GSK-3
inhibitor (litihum carbonate) and reduced risk of COVID-19. Inhibition of a host protein required
for coronavirus propagation has a potential advantage over inhibiting viral proteins as the
probability of developing drug resistant mutations should be lower for the host protein. Given the
major coronavirus epidemics over the past 20 years, including SARS, COVID-19, and MERS,
new coronavirus outbreaks in the future are possible. Multiple approaches will be needed to
address current and potential future outbreaks, including the development of medications that
target common features of coronavirus. Interfering with the conserved dependence of the
nucleocapsid protein on the host protein GSK-3 may be a viable approach to treat COVID-19
and potential future coronavirus outbreaks.

Methods
Plasmids, antibodies: The SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid gene was PCR amplified from cDNA
derived from the isolate SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/CA-CZB017/2020 (Genbank MT385497.1),
nucleotides 28254-29513, and cloned into pCS2MT in frame with five N terminal myc epitope
tags (https://www.addgene.org/153201/). Priming site mutations were generated by site directed
mutagenesis to modify serine-188 and serine-206 to alanine based on prior observations with
SARS-CoV-19. Antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 N protein were purchased from Invitrogen (#PA141386). Antibodies from Cell Signaling included phospho-Glycogen Synthase (#3891),
phospho-S6 (#4858), b-catenin (#9562), phospho-b-catenin (#9561), GAPDH (#2118), PKCα
(#2056), PKCδ (#2058), PKCε (#2683), and phospho (Ser) substrate (#2261). Other antibodies

included antibodies to GSK-3 (Calbiochem #368662), Tau (T14/46 antibodies provided by
Virginia Lee, University of Pennsylvania), and b-actin (Sigma #A5441). Monoclonal Anti-SARSCoV S Protein (similar to 240C) was obtained through BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH (NR-616).

Cell culture, transfections, and CRISPR/Cas9 knockout: HEK293T cells (ATCC #CRL-1573)
were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, GIBCO #11965) supplemented
with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (Hyclone #SH30071.03) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (GIBCO
#15140), and were maintained at 37°C and 5% CO2. Cells were transfected 24 hours after
plating using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen #L3000001) for plasmids or Lipofectamine
RNAiMax (Invitrogen #13778075) for siRNAs according to manufacturer’s instructions. For
silencing PKC isozymes, siRNA oligonucleotides from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO) were: J003523-17-0002 (PKCα), J-003524-08-0002 (PKCδ), and J-004653-08-0002 (PKCε).
Transfections were done in Opti-MEM Reduced Serum Medium (GIBCO #31985). For
CRISPR/Cas9 knockout, guide RNA (gRNA) sequence targeting GSK-3A
(GCCTAGAGTGGCTACGACTG) or GSK-3B (AGATGAGGTCTATCTTAATC) was cloned into
lentiCRISPRv2 vector (Addgene #99154, Sanjana et al. 2014). Lentivirus was packaged as
previously described (Hou, et al. 2015). For transduction, 2X105 293T cells were seeded in 6well plate with 10ug/ml polybrene and transduced with the lentivirus at a multiplicity of infection
(MOI) of 20. After 24 hours, medium was changed. Two days after transduction, about 1,000
tranduced 293T cells were mixed with 1ml of methylcellulose (MethoCult H4034 Optimum, Stem
Cell Technologies) into a 6-well plate and cultured at 37°C and 5% CO2 for two weeks. Singleclone colonies were then picked and cultured in 96-well plate. The cells were passaged every 23 days, and half of the cells was collected for genomic DNA extraction. Then GSK-3 target
region was PCR amplified and sequenced. GSK-3A PCR primers: forward,

GCAGAAATAAAATCTATAAATGTCTGTG. Immunoblot analysis was performed to confirm
knockout of single clones.

Immunoblotting, immunoprecipitations, and in vitro protein kinase assay: Cells were lysed in
buffer containing 20mM Tris pH 7.5, 140mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100,
1mM DTT, 50mM NaF, and protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma P8340), phosphatase inhibitor
cocktail #2 (Sigma P5726) and #3 (Sigma P0044) used 1:100 each. Supernatants were
collected after centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4oC, adjusted to 1x laemmli sample
buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE using NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen) and then immunoblotted as
described previously9. For immunoprecipitation/protein kinase assays, anti-Myc-tag antibody
was incubated with Surebeads Protein G megnetic beads (Bio-Rad, #1614023) for 10 min,
lysates were then added for an additional 1 hr at room temperature. Antibody-bound beads
were washed with PBS-T (PBS + 0.1% Tween 20) 3 times and resuspended in 1X protein
kinase buffer (100mM Tris pH 7.5, 5mM DTT, 10mM MgCl2, 60uM ATP, ± human recombinant
GSK-3b) and incubated at 30oC for 30 min. Reactions were stopped by adding standard 2X
Laemmli Sample Buffer and incubating at 70oC for 10 min and then subjected to SDS-PAGE
and immunoblotting as above.

Infection with SARS-CoV-2: UPenn: SARS-CoV-2 (Isolate USA-WA1/2020) was obtained from
BEI Resources. Stocks were prepared and titered (1x107 pfu/mL and 1.5x106 TCID50/ml) as
described previously2. Cells were plated in 384-well plates (20 µl/well) at 7500 cells per well.
The next day, 50 nL of drugs or vehicle control (DMSO) were added and one hour later cells
were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI=0.5) and incubated for 48 hours. Cells were then fixed
in 4% formaldehyde/PBS, immunostained for dsRNA (anti-dsRNA J2), and imaged as described
previously2. The total number of cells and the number of infected cells were measured using
MetaXpress 5.3.3 cell scoring module and the percentage of infected cells was calculated. All

work with infectious virus was performed in a Biosafety Level 3 laboratory and approved by the
Institutional Biosafety Committee and Environmental Health and Safety.

UCLA: Calu3 cells were seeded at 3x104 cells per well in 0.2 ml volumes in 96-well plates.
CHIR99021 or Enzastaurin (each at 10 µM and 3.3 µM) was added to cells followed after 1 hour
by inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 (isolate USA-WA1/2020) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of
0.1. At 48 hours post infection (hpi), the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and viral
infection was examined by immunofluorescent analysis (IFA) using SARS-CoV Spike (S)
antibody [BEI Resources: NR-616 Monoclonal Anti-24 SARS-CoV S Protein (Similar to 240C)].

Study design and cohort selection for electronic health records (EHR) analysis: We extracted
retrospective EHR data on patients with a documented SARS-CoV-2 infection from three major
health care systems across the United States. The cohort included patients from the University
of Pennsylvania Health System (UPHS), Mount Sinai Medical Center (MSMC), and University of
Iowa Health Care (UIHC). Our main hypothesis was to test for the association between lithium
use and COVID-19 susceptibility. We employed several EHR phenotyping algorithms to identify
patients who were tested for COVID-19 by RT-PCR, patients with prescriptions for lithium, and
patients with bipolar disorder. To account for the possibility that an individual had been tested
for COVID-19 within the health system, but otherwise managed their care at a different health
system, such that they had no medication or diagnosis information, we restricted the analysis to
individuals with at least four encounters within the health system. The analysis workflow is
provided in Fig. 5. EHR analysis for UPHS was performed under University of Pennsylvania
Institutional Review Board (IRB) protocol #844360 and for MSMC under IRB#20-00338.

Outcome: The primary outcome of our case-control EHR study was COVID-19 susceptibility
where cases are defined by positive test results from RT-PCR of nasal samples and controls

with negative test results. PCR test results were recorded through February, 2021. The analysis
was also restricted to participants between the ages of 18 and 89.

Exposure: Lithium use was defined using the prescription orders available within the EHR. The
medication name and dose generally differ across health systems and it poses a challenge to
develop standard selection criteria. To minimize these differences, we used RxNorm – a
resource of standardized nomenclature for drug names from the National Library of Medicine45.
RxNorm maps branded and generic names, ingredients, drug components, and other drugrelated vocabularies to standard names. The current EHR systems (EPIC) also support RxNorm
and there is an existing mapping between drug names and RxNorm concept unique identifiers
(RxCUI). We queried RxNorm to extract all the RxCUI linked with lithium carbonate and then
extracted prescription orders mapped to RxCUI in the EHR system. The list of RxNorm CUIs
can be found in Supplementary Table 2. A patient was considered on lithium treatment if they
had an order placed within 90 days prior to their first positive COVID-19 test (COVID-19 cases)
or 90 days before their first negative COVID-19 test (COVID-19 controls). Generally, lithium is
prescribed for a longer period of time (> 3 months), so to capture long-term use of lithium we
included patients with two or more lithium orders placed within 12 months before their COVID19 test, using the aforementioned methods for COVID-19 cases and controls.

Statistical Analysis: To minimize potential confounding biases among the population tested for
COVID-19, we applied a propensity score matching (PSM) method. For each patient on lithium
with a record of COVID-19 testing, we first calculated the propensity score using a multivariate
logistic regression model adjusting for age, sex, and race. Then, we applied nearest-neighbor
matching (MatchIt R) on the propensity scores to select one matched patient for each patient on
lithium. We conducted a meta-analysis on the association between lithium use and COVID-19

outcome occurrences using the meta R package. We pooled the effect estimates using fixed
effect and random effects models and the Mantel-Haenszel method was used to calculate the
fixed effect estimate. Since we have effect estimates from only three sites, a sensitivity analysis
of subgroups was not feasible. We assessed the heterogeneity of the meta-analysis through I

Fig. 1. The SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid protein is phosphorylated by GSK-3 in two
conserved consensus sites. A. The RS domains of SARS-CoV-2 (aa176-206) and SARSCoV N proteins are 90% identical and contain tandem sets of SXXXS motifs, labelled “a” and
“b”. Consensus site serines and threonines are in bold; red indicates sites shown previously by
mass spectroscopy to be phosphorylated1,9. B. Alignment of RS domains in N proteins from
pathogenic CoVs showing conservation of repeated SXXXS motifs (“S” in motif represents
serine or threonine) and a highly conserved arginine 3 residues before the putative priming sites
(SRXXS). Blue indicates b-CoV; orange: a-CoV; green: g-CoV. C. SARS-CoV2 N was
expressed in 293T cells, treated with LiCl for 18h, and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and
immunoblotting for N protein (CoV2-N), phosphorylated glycogen synthase (pGS), or b-Actin as
a loading control. Alkaline phosphatase (AP) treatment of cell lysates increases electrophoretic
mobility. LiCl inhibits N phosphorylation with IC50 ~10 mM. “phos” indicates phosphorylated N
protein; “unphos” indicates dephosphorylated N; NT, nontransfected. Ctl, nontreated control. D.
SARS-CoV-2 N expressing 293T cells were treated for 18h with LiCl, bisindolylmaleimide I
(BIM-I), or CHIR99021 (CHIR) at the indicated concentrations and cell lysates were
immunoblotted as in panel C.

Fig. 2. GSK3 is required for N phosphorylation. A. Control 293T cells (WT), 293T cells with
CRISPR/Cas9 KO of GSK3A (GSK3A-/-), and GSK3A-/- cells with siRNA knockdown of GSK3B
(GSK3A-/--;siGSK3B) were treated with LiCl at indicated concentrations and lysates were
immunoblotted for N protein, phospho-b-catenin, GSK-3a/b, or b-Actin. Combined loss of GSKA
and GSK3B impairs phosphorylation of N and b-catenin and enhances sensitivity to LiCl. B.
GSK3B was deleted in GSK3A-/- cells using CRISPR (GSK3 DKO). N protein was expressed in
both wild-type and DKO cells in the presence of increasing concentrations LiC for 18h as above

and immunoblotted for N protein, phospho-GS (pGS), total b-catenin, GSK-3a/b , and b-actin. N
is not phosphorylated in DKO cells and mobility is not affected by LiCl treatment. Total
b-catenin protein accumulates in absence of GSK-3. C. Serine-188 and serine-206 were
mutated to alanine by site directed mutagenesis and single and double mutant N proteins were
expressed in 293T cells in the presence of vehicle or 10mM LiCl and immunoblotted for N
protein, pGS, or b-actin. The double mutant NS188A;S206A migrates similar to dephosphorylated
wild-type N. Single mutants are more sensitive to LiCl. D/E. N protein was immunoprecipitated
from wild-type HEK293T cells treated with or without 10mM LiCl for 18h (indicated by “CTL” or
“LiCL” below each lane in panel D) or from GSK3 DKO cells (panel E). Immunoprecipitated N
protein was added to an in vitro kinase reaction with recombinant GSK-3b. GSK-3b
phosphorylates N from LiCl treated wild-type and DKO cells as indicated by slower
electroporetic mobility (“phos” in panel E).

Fig. 3. Enzastaurin inhibits N phosphorylation: A. N expressing 293T cells were treated with
DMSO or increasing doses of Enzastaurin. Enzastaurin inhibited phosphorylation of N and GS
in a dose dependent manner. Inhibition of PKC in these samples is described in supplemental
figure S3. B. In vitro GSK-3 kinase assay using tau protein as substrate. Unphosphorylated tau
migrates more rapidly (“unphos”) than tau phosphorylated by GSK-3 (“phos”). Enzastaurin
inhibits GSK-3 activity directly at 0.5 µM. C. N protein was immunoprecipitated from DKO cells
as in Fig. 2D/E and added to an in vitro kinase reaction with recombinant GSK-3b.
Phosphorylation of N protein was inhibited in the presence of Enzastaurin.

Supplementary Figure S2. A. Serine-188 and serine-206 of SARS-CoV-2 N protein were
mutated to alanine and single and double mutant N proteins were expressed in 293T cells.
Alkaline phosphatase (AP) treatment of cell lysates increases electrophoretic mobility. B. mTOR
inhibitor Rapamycin had no effect on N phsohorylation. SARS-CoV2 N expressing 293T cells
were treated with Rapamycin (50 and 200 nM) in the presence of LiCl for 18h and then
subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting for N protein (upper panel) and phosphorylation of
-catenin (middle panel) and S6 (lower panel). Rapamycin inhibited S6 phosphorylation but had
no effect on N phosphorylation. “P” indicates phosphorylated N; “Un-P” indicates
dephosphorylated species. C. N expressing 293T cells were treated with LiCl or the SRPK
inhibitor SRPIN340 separately (left panel) or in combination (right panel) and cell lysates were
then harvested for Western blot analysis as in panels A and B.

Supplementary Figure S3. A. N expressing 293T cells were treated with DMSO or increasing
doses of Enzastaurin and then stimulated with 200nM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)
for 30 mins prior to lysis. PKC activity was assessed with an antibody that detects
phosphorylated PKC substrates. b-actin is shown as a loading control. B. N expressing 293T
cells were treated with DMSO or increasing doses of the PKC inhibitors Enzastaurin and
Gö6976 and stimulated with PMA as in panel A. Cell lysates were immunoblotted for N protein
(upper panel), phospho-GS (middle panel), or phosphorylated PKC substrates (lower panel).
Gö6976 does not affect phosphorylation of N or GS. C. The structurally related PKC inhibitors
Sotrastaurin and Gö6983 inhibit N phosphorylation. N expressing cells were treated with
Sotrastaurin or Gö6983 at the indicated concentrations and then lysates were immunotted for N
and p-GS as above. D. Global PKC knockdown does not affect phosphorylation of N protein or
GS. N expressing 293T cells were treated with vehicle or LiCl, then transfected with siRNAs
directed against PKCα, PKCδ, or PKCε individually or in combination, as described previously46.
Cell lysates were immunoblotted for CoV-2 N protein, pGS, or PKC isoforms as indicated in
figure. b-actin was a loading control. E. N protein was immunoprecipitated from GSK3 DKO
cells as in Fig. 2E and added to an in vitro kinase reaction with recombinant GSK-3b.
Phosphorylation of N protein assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift was inhibited in the
presence of 5uM Enzastaurin, 10uM Sotrastaurin, or 2uM CHIR99021.
