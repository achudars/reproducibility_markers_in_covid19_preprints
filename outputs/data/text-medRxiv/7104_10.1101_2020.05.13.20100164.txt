COVID-19 In Shang Hai: It is Worth Learning from the Successful
Experience in Preventing and Controlling the Overseas Epidemic
Situation
Qi Dang, Rui Miao, Yong Liang

Abstract—COVID-19 first appeared in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China
in late December 2019 and spread rapidly in China. Currently, the spread
of local epidemics has been basically blocked. The import of overseas
epidemics has become the main form of growth in China ’s new epidemic.
As an important international transportation hub in China, Shanghai is
one of the regions with the highest risk of imported cases abroad. Due to
imported of overseas cases are affected by the international epidemic trend.
The traditional infectious disease model is difficult to accurately predict
the cumulative trend of cumulative cases in the Shanghai areas. It is also
difficult to accurately evaluate the effectiveness of the international traffic
blockade. In this situation, this study takes Shanghai as an example to
propose a new type of infectious disease prediction model. The model first
uses the sparse graph model to analyze the international epidemic spread
network to find countries and regions related to Shanghai. Next, multiple
regression models were used to fit the existing COV-19 growth data in
Shanghai. Finally, the model can predict the growth curve of Shanghai's
epidemic without blocking traffic. The results show that the control
measures taken by Shanghai are very effective. At present, more and more
countries and regions will face the current situation in Shanghai. We
recommend that other countries and regions learn from Shanghai ’s
successful experience in preventing overseas imports in order to fully
prepare for epidemic prevention and control.

I. INTRODUCTION

S

INCE December 2019, COVID-19 broke out in Wuhan, Hubei
Province, China. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). this
virus quickly spread throughout China. In the early stages of the
COVID-19 epidemic, the number of infected cases increased
exponentially[1]. The Chinese government has taken various
preventive and control measures to intervene, including mandatory

blockades, staggered working hours, etc.[2-4]. These measures
effectively prevent the virus from spreading from person to person, and
reduce the morbidity and mortality[5]. After more than two months,
COVID-19 was gradually control in China and entered a stable state.
In view of the fact that the COVID-19 epidemic in China has been
basically contained, other international regions of the world are still
experiencing outbreaks. Unless substantive public health interventions
are implemented, overseas countries and regions that have close
communications with China may cause the epidemic in China to
escalate again. Among them, Shanghai, as one of China's largest
international airports, is the region with the highest risk of overseas
imports. Overseas case importation poses a huge threat to this city with
a population of 24 million. As of 24:00 on April 2, 2020, there were
1562 confirmed cases in China, including 698 confirmed cases
imported from abroad. The number of confirmed cases in Shanghai is
177, including 171 imported cases abroad. Therefore, in order to solve
this problem. The Shanghai government has taken a lot of measures,
including isolation observation, traffic control, and nucleic acid
detection, etc. It is worth noting that from March 28th, Shanghai
suspended the entry permit for non-Chinese nationals.
We also note that apart from Shanghai, many other regions in the
world also face the same problem as Shanghai, that is, what measures
should use to control the import of overseas cases? Since the outbreak
of Wuhan, several modeling research teams around the world have
used an infection model based on the SIR or SEIR framework to
estimate and predict COVID-19[6-8].However, the existing models
are difficult to be directly applied to the prediction of overseas case
trends. In this article, we propose a sparse relationship graph model for
the establishment of an international epidemic spread network. After
combining the regression model, we can predict the growth trend of
cases in the target area. Because Shanghai, China is one of the earliest
areas to take measures to block overseas spread. Therefore, this article
takes Shanghai as an example, on the one hand, we want to verify the
model proposed in this paper. On the other hand, we want to analyze
whether the epidemic prevention and control measures taken by
Shanghai are effective and whether Shanghai's measures can provide
an effective reference for similar regions.
We used 77-day real diagnosis data of 188 countries and regions
around the world, and established an international network related to
Shanghai. we discover that the epidemic trend in Shanghai is highly
correlated with the epidemic situation in 30 countries and regions and
most of these countries and regions are the center of the outbreak of
the international epidemic. We established a variety of regression
models to fit the existing growth curve, and predicted the growth of
Shanghai cases from April 4th to 19th without blocking international
traffic. This study believes that Shanghai's blockade measures are
necessary and effective, which avoids greater losses and effectively

observations. Let〈∙ , ∙〉 on ℝ) be the usual inner product, and ‖∙‖N the
corresponding norm.
The 𝐿& estimate 𝜃 B,P of 𝜃 B is given by Equation (2):
𝜃Q B,P = 𝑎𝑟𝑔 min (𝑛\& ‖𝐶B − 𝐶W ‖NN + 𝜆‖𝜃‖& ) (2)

II. MATERIALS AND METHOD

‖𝜃‖& = ∑ 𝑏𝜖Γ()) |𝜃C | is the 𝑳𝟏 -norm of the coefficient vector. It is
recommended to normalize all variables to a common empirical
variance in the above formula. The solution of the above formula is not
necessarily unique. However, if the uniqueness fails, the solution set is
still convex, and all of our results on the neighborhood apply to any
solution of the above formula.
Other regression estimates based on the 𝑙𝑝 norm have been
proposed, where p is usually in the range [0, 2] (see[13]). A value of
𝑝 = 2 will result in ridge estimation, while 𝑝 = 0 corresponds to
traditional model selection. As we all know, only when 𝑝 ≤ 1, the
estimated value has a parsimony property (some components happen
to be zero), For 𝑝 ≥ 1, the optimization problem in the above formula
is only convex. Therefore, the minimization of empirical risk
constrained by 𝑳𝟏 occupies 𝑎 unique position, because 𝑝 = 1 is the
only value of 𝑝 , variable selection is made at this value, and the
optimization problem is still convex, so it is feasible for highdimensional problems.
The neighborhood estimate (parameterized by 𝜆) is defined by the
non-zero coefficient estimate of 𝐿& penalty regression Equation (3):
(3)
𝑛𝑒
gBP = ?𝑏𝜖Γ(𝑛): 𝜃QCB,P ≠ 0A
Therefore, each choice of penalty parameter 𝜆 specifies an estimate
of the neighborhood of node 𝑎𝜖Γ(𝑛), and the rest is to choose the
appropriate penalty parameter. A larger penalty value tends to reduce
the size of the estimated set, and if the value of 𝜆 decreases, usually
more variables are included in the estimated value.
The prediction-oracle solution. A seemingly useful choice of
penalty parameters is (unavailable) to predict the oracle value Equation

B. Model
1) Model of international relations network based on 𝑳𝟏
In order to discover the international correlation network of
COVID-19, we build a sparse network model based on regularization,
As the name implies, the network obtained by this model is a
directionless network. The typical characteristic of a directionless
network is that the degree between most nodes in the network is very
small, the few nodes with large existence are called central points. For
this study, our main focus is on nodes related to Shanghai, In the
relationship network, if the model thinks that a country or region is
related to Shanghai, it means that the epidemic situation in that country
can affect the growth of cases in Shanghai. The mathematical
framework of the sparse network model based on regularization in this
paper is as follows[9]:
Consider the n-dimensional multivariate normal distributed random
variable Equation (1):
(1)
𝐶 = (𝐶& , ⋯ ⋯ 𝐶) ) ∼ 𝑁(𝜇, ∑)
This includes Gaussian linear models. For example, 𝐶& is the
response variable,{𝐶1 ; 2 ≦ 𝑘 ≦ 𝑛} is a predictor, Assuming that the
covariance matrix is nonsingular, you can use the graphical model 𝐺 =
(Γ, Ε) conveniently express the conditional independence structure of
the distribution, In Γ = {1, ⋯ ⋯ 𝑛} is the set of nodes, and E is the set
of edges in C. Given all remaining variables 𝐶𝛤\{𝑎, 𝑏} = ?𝐶1 ; 𝑘 ∈
𝛤\{𝑎, 𝑏}A，A pair of (𝑎, 𝑏) is included in the edge set E if and only if
𝐶B depends conditionally on 𝐶C . Given all remaining variables, each
pair of variables not included in the edge set is conditionally
independent and corresponds to the zero term in the inverse covariance
matrix[10].
Neighborhood selection is a sub-problem of covariance selection.
The minimum subset of the neighborhood Γ\{𝑎} of the node 𝑎𝜖Γ,
therefore, considering all the variables 𝐶B in the neighborhood, 𝐶B is
conditionally independent of all remaining variables. The
neighborhood of node𝑎𝜖Γ consists of all nodes 𝑏𝜖Γ\{𝑎}, so ((𝑎, 𝑏)𝜖Ε.
For the observation of 𝐶 , neighborhood selection aims to estimate
(individually) the neighborhood of any given variable (or node).
Neighborhood selection can be used as a standard regression problem,
it can be effectively solved with 𝐿& [11], As will be shown in this paper.
For sparse high-dimensional graphs, the consistency of the
proposed neighborhood selection will be shown, where the number of
variables may grow with any power of the number of observations
(high-dimensional), whereas the number of neighbors of any variable
is growing at most slightly slower than the number of observations
(sparsity).
Neighborhood selection with the 𝐿& . It is well known that the Lasso,
introduced by Tibshirani [8], and known as Basis Pursuit in the context
of wavelet regression[12], With simplicity [10].When the forecast has
all remaining variables 𝐶B ?𝐶1 ; 𝑘𝜖Γ\(𝑛)\{𝑎}A, The estimated value of
the disappeared lasso coefficient asymptotically identifies the
neighborhood of node 𝑎 in the graph, as shown below. Let 𝑛 × 𝑐()) dimensional matrix 𝐶 contain 𝑐 independent 𝑛 observations, so for
all 𝑎𝜖Γ(𝑛) , column 𝐶B corresponds to a vector of 𝑛 independent

Expectation is understood to be abo has nothing to do with samples
that estimate 𝜃 B,P . The prediction penalty minimizes the prediction
risk in all 𝐿& regular sub-estimates. The 𝜆𝑜𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑙𝑒 estimate is obtained
by selecting 𝜆𝑐𝑣 for cross-validation.
Shao[14] showed that for 𝐿[ penalty regression, the crossvalidation choice of penalty parameters is consistent with the model
choice of the verification set size under certain conditions. Predicting
that the Oracle solution will not lead to consistent model selection for
𝐿& , as shown in the simple example below.
Proposition. Let the number of variables grow to infinity, for 𝑛 →
∞, 𝑝(𝑛) → ∞, for some 𝛾 > 0 𝑤𝑖𝑡ℎ 𝑝(𝑛) = 𝑜(𝑛} )，Assume that the
covariance matrices ∑(𝑛) except for some pair (𝑎, 𝑏)𝜖Γ(𝑛) × Γ(𝑛)，
for which ∑BC (𝑛) = ∑CB (𝑛) = 𝑠, for some 0 < 𝑠 < 1 and all 𝑛𝜖𝑁。
under the prediction-oracle penalty, The probability of choosing the
wrong neighborhood for node 𝑎 converges to 1, as shown in
Equation(5):
P
(5)
𝑃 •𝑛𝑒
gB ‚ƒY„…† ≠ 𝑛𝑒B ‡ → 1
𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑛 → ∞
From the proof of the above proposition, it can be concluded that
many noise variables are included in the prediction of the
neighborhood of the Oracle solution. In fact, for a fixed number of
variables, the possibility of including noise variables in prediction
predictions will not even disappear. If the selected penalty is greater
than the predicted optimal value, then the 𝐿& regularizer can be used
for consistent neighborhood selection.

paper, three regression models are established for experiments
including: nuclear ridge regression model, elastic network model and
Bayesian regression model.
a)
Kernel Ridge Regression
For the parameter matrix, in order to solve the risk of overfitting,
we sequentially add "kernel" and "ridge" to the linear regression model
to transform the model[15].
The first step is to add "kernel". For a given test sample, each
training sample ŒŒŒ⃗

together when the model is fitted, where the parameters α and λ are
obtained by maximum likelihood estimation.
The difference between Bayesian Ridge Regression and ordinary
Ridge Regression is that it adopts Bayesian strategy of updating priors’
step by step. Ordinary Ridge Regression allows the parameter to be
zero, but Bayesian Estimation cannot do so because the standard
deviation of Gaussian Can be infinite. At the same time, Bayesian
regression will give the confidence interval of the parameter, which is
an optional range of the parameter, which is essentially a covariance
matrix.

b)
Elastic network
Elastic network is a linear regression model trained using 𝑳𝟏 and 𝑳𝟐
norms as a priori regular terms[16]. This model can fit non-zero sparse
matrices with a small number of parameters. Elastic networks are very
useful when many features are interrelated. Elastic networks are more
inclined to consider two of these characteristics randomly, and inherit
the stability of Ridge during the allowed cycle[17].

Bayesian Ridge Regression
Bayesian Ridge Regression is to use the probability model to
estimate the regression model, mainly to solve the complexity of the
model in the process of maximum likelihood estimation[18]. The
process of Bayesian Ridge regression is a process in which sample
points are gradually added to the learner. The posterior of the previous
sample point will be used as a priori by the next estimation. In other
words, Bayesian learning is gradually updating the prior. The prior
update is actually iterated by updating the maximum likelihood
estimation parameter and sample points, the prior parameter ω is
obtained by the Gaussian mode Equation (10).

The prior parameters α and λ generally follow the gamma
distribution, and this distribution has a conjugate prior relationship
with Gaussian [19]. The parameters ω，α 𝑎𝑛𝑑 λ are estimated

This chapter first uses the case data of 188 countries and regions in
the world from January 19 to April 4 to accumulate a total of 77 days
to establish a global epidemic transmission relationship network. Next,
the subnet data of countries related to Shanghai are extracted. Then,
three regression models were used to establish regression models to fit
the cumulative case growth data from January 19 to April 4 in
Shanghai. This article mainly uses the 5-fold cross-validation,
explained_variance，mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error and
r2 indicators to verify the model results. Finally, through the regression
model after training, we predicted the cumulative diagnosed cases in
Shanghai from April 4 to April 19(without blocking traffic).
A. Global network analysis
According to the latest China national epidemic prevention and
control instructions "anti-import, non-proliferation", the Shanghai
government responded to the Chinese government's call. On March 28,
2020, the entry application for non-Chinese nationals was stopped. The
infection period of COVID-19 seems to be very long, which may last
10 days or longer after the incubation period [20]. Considering the
special situation, we chose a latency of 7 days. Therefore, through the
sparse network model based on 𝐿& , we constructed the data matrix of
the actual case statistics of 188 countries and regions in the world from
January 19th to April 4th, and plotted the COVID-19 international
network. As shown in Figure 1, by analyzing the international relations
network, we have counted the central nodes of the international
epidemic transmission network, As shown in Table 1, we found that
the United States, Italy, Iran, and Hubei, China are the main Hub nodes,
that is, the main international epidemic spread countries. This result is
consistent with the existing real situation; Therefore, it can be
concluded that the international network relations based on 𝑳𝟏 in this
study have certain reliability.
B. Shanghai Subnet Analysis
Next, we extracted the relationship subnets of cities and regions
related to Shanghai. as shown in Figure 2. We can see that Shanghai is
closely related to many areas of China, such as Hubei, Guangdong,
Beijing and Heilongjiang. This is because in the early days of the
spread of the Shanghai epidemic, these areas were the main import
areas to Shanghai. At present, the epidemic situation in these areas has
been stable and basically contained. As shown in Figure 2, we can also
find many international communication channels, such as: The United
States, European countries, Iran, the Philippines and other regions, this
is caused by COVID-19 broke out in the international scope, brought
by passengers entering international flights Input abroad. After
identifying 30 countries and regions related to Shanghai, we can
further establish a regression model to fit the epidemic growth data of
Shanghai from January 19 to April 4.

C. Building a regression model
This article uses three regression algorithms to build the model,
which are: KernelRidge，BayesianRidge and ElasticNet model. As
shown in Figure 3 and Table 2-3, the three methods can fit the existing
growth data in Shanghai well. Among them, the ElasticNet model
performs best, explained_variance ， mean_absolute_error,
mean_squared_error and r2 values Only 0.997, 3.19, 29.68 and 0.997,
respectively, the average loss value of the 5-fold cross-validation is
only -6.624. It can also be seen from the fitting curve that this method
shows a good fitting effect.Experiments have proved that without
blocking international traffic in Shanghai,The real data of the countries
and regions related to Shanghai in the above international relations
networkCan effectively predict the growth of cases in Shanghai.
D. Short-term epidemic growth curve (unblocked international
traffic)
After establishing a regression model, we use data from 30 countries
and regions related to Shanghai from April 4 to April 19 for 15 days to
predict Shanghai's epidemic growth curve without the international
traffic blockade, and compare it with real data. The experimental
results are shown in Figure 4 and Table 4. On the premise that
international traffic is not blocked, all three regression models have
concluded that the cumulative number of confirmed cases will far
exceed the existing real data. On April 19th, the cumulative case
prediction results of the three models were between 1154-1386 people.
In fact, the cumulative confirmed cases on that day were 526, and the
predicted data was slightly greater than twice the true confirmed cases.
The result of this comparison shows that Shanghai ’s adoption of the
international traffic blockade has a significant effect and can largely
prevent the import of overseas epidemic situations. It also means that
Shanghai ’s traffic control is effective and necessary.

IV. DISCUSSION
COVID-19 quickly spread from a city to the entire country in just
30 days. This alarming rate of expansion and the number of cases
growing shocked the public health service system of the entire country.
The Chinese government showed to the world its epidemic response
capacity in the first time. These measures have made a significant
effect in responding to COVID-19. China's domestic epidemic
situation has been basically blocked. At present, COVID-19 has
broken out in many countries outside the country. Therefore, at this
stage, the main way of confirmed cases in China is passengers entering
by international transportation.
This article establishes a network of epidemic transmission
relationships between Shanghai and different countries and regions
around the world, and builds a regression model based on network
information to fit Shanghai ’s COVID-19 epidemic growth data. The
results show that the regression model based on the relational network
can better fit the existing cumulative number growth curve. Combined
with the regression model, we can predict the future development trend
of cumulative cases in Shanghai (unblocked international traffic).
According to the prediction results, we learned that the Shanghai
government adopted traffic blockade measures, which effectively
prevented the epidemic from spreading further. At present, the
imported epidemic situation outside Shanghai has been effectively
controlled, but we still need to be vigilant to prevent the recurrence of
the epidemic situation. More importantly, with the effective control of
the local epidemic situation in various countries, Shanghai's successful
experience in dealing with the import of overseas epidemic situations
has also played a demonstration role for other countries and regions.
In order to reduce the risk of imported COVID-19 cases, Shanghai
has adopted a series of measures to prevent and control possible

identification of possible cases. First, during the epidemic, all Chinese
and foreign personnel who have lived in key countries or regions
within 14 days before entering Shanghai will be quarantined for 14
days. Secondly, conduct temperature examination and medical
observation on all entry personnel, and then transfer and isolate
confirmed cases and suspected cases for rapid treatment. Carry out
preventive measures for close contacts. Since March 28, international
routes have been suspended, and foreign tourists are prohibited from
entering Shanghai.
As a successful import case for overseas epidemic prevention,
Shanghai has fully demonstrated how a region can prevent a global
pandemic, and it has provided a good demonstration for other countries
and regions. At the same time, it also showed the friendly style of the
Chinese nation and treated all immigrants equally during the epidemic,
making foreign friends feel warm during this difficult time.
