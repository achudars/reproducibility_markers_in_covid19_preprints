Abstract:

Whether university teaching on campus with infection control measures in place is associated with
higher risk of COVID-19 than online instruction, is unknown. We will assess this by conducting
repeated surveys among students at universities and university colleges in Norway, where some
instruction is given in-person, and some is provided online (hybrid model). We will ask about the
students’ COVID-19 status, and how much in-person and online instruction they are getting. We will
estimate the association between in-person instruction and COVID-19-risk using multivariate
regression, controlling for likely confounders. We will also assess whether type of instruction is
associated with how satisfied the students are with the instruction, their quality of life, and learning
outcomes.

STUDY PROTOCOL, 27 August 2020

Background:

Social distancing measures, including encouraging people to maintain a distance of 1-2 meters from
each other and/or to work from home, are likely to reduce the spread of COVID-19, based on
observational evidence and logical arguments [1-3].
Policy makers need to balance the effectiveness of infection control measures against other
considerations, including psychosocial and societal consequences. This balance is difficult to strike,
especially for institutions where social interactions are of key importance, such as universities. Lack
of knowledge about the relative effectiveness of various social distancing measures makes this
judgement particularly difficult. As Gressman and Peck put it: “In the absence of relevant prior
experience, these institutions are largely in the dark about how one might expect a COVID-19
outbreak to evolve in the unique environment of a college campus and how much of an effect the
many possible mitigation strategies should be expected to produce.” [4]
Some attempts have been made at modelling the risk of offering instruction on campus, e.g. a group
at Cornell University arrived at the counter intuitive conclusion that shifting to online instruction only
would lead to more COVID-19 cases than a full return of students. However, this was premised on
“aggressive asymptomatic surveillance where every member of the campus community is tested
every 5 days”, as well as sufficient capacity for quarantining, and a series of other assumptions [5].
While universities and colleges in the United States have opted for different models, ranging from
completely online to only in-person instruction [6], the higher education institutions in Norway have
decided to offer a hybrid model, with some online, and some in-person instruction. This decision
enables us to compare students with predominantly in-person instruction and students who receive
more online instruction, and to assess the association between campus presence and COVID-19
incidence.
We are not aware of other studies on the association of in-person instruction, or the effect of
offering online instruction, on COVID-19 risk. We therefore believe that this study is important to
carry out as it has the potential to generate findings that can inform infection control policies at our
universities, and in similar environments.
Methods:

We are inviting all universities and university colleges in Norway to take part. All students at
institutions that agree to participate will receive an SMS (alternatively an e-mail) inviting them to
take part in the study. The invitation includes a link that directs them to a web-based informed
consent-form and questionnaire.
We will ask the participants if they have been tested for COVID-19, the results of such a test, how
much in-person instruction they have been offered, and how much online instruction they have been
offered. We will also inquire about other risk factors for COVID-19 and background variables that
may be included as potential adjustment factors (confounders) in the analyses (see Attachment 1 Questionnaire).
We will survey the students every two weeks by new invitations by SMS or e-mail. The study period
will last as long as the universities maintain their arrangements with in-person instruction for only
select groups of students. We plan for a study period that lasts for the remainder of 2020.
Students will be asked for consent to link the survey results to information on study programme,
basis for admission, study status, academic results, sex and age from the Common Student System

(FS) (see Attachment 2 for full list of variables). Obtaining this information through data linkage will
reduce the survey burden for the students and increase the accuracy and quality of the data. The
impact of the intervention on exam results and completion will be of significant interest for the
institutions and for society at large, as such impacts must be balanced against the needs for disease
control. Information on academic performance the previous semester and from upper secondary
school will be needed to adjust for these variables as important possible confounders.
We developed a questionnaire through an iterative process, partly based on existing items from
existing questionnaires (see Attachment 1 – Questionnaire). Pilot testing with a group of 10 students
at Oslo Metropolitan University showed that the questionnaire could be completed with little use of
time (around 5 minutes), and that some questions needed to be amended.
We prepared an English version of the questionnaire for students who prefer English over
Norwegian. A native English speaker translated the questionnaire to English, and another person not
familiar with the questionnaire translated the English version back to Norwegian. We compared the
original Norwegian version and the back-translated version, and made minor adjustments.
We have prepared a communication plan, which includes several measures to ensure a high
response rate among the students.
Student involvement has taken place at two levels during the project-planning period: We have
informed the Student Parliament about the project and they have offered their support, and the pilot
testing described above.

Main outcome:
•

COVID-19 incidence (self-reported positive test results)

Secondary outcomes:
•
•

Quality of life (“Overall, how satisfied are you with life right now?”)
Teaching satisfaction (“Overall, how satisfied have you been with the teaching you have
received in the past 14 days?”)

•
•

Incidence of COVID-19 testing (self-reported)
Learning outcomes (from FS – Common Student System)

We will run multivariate regressions to test whether there is an association between in-person
instruction and the outcomes.
In-person instruction is a continuous variable, defined as
(Number of days offered in-person instruction)
(Number of days offered in-person instruction + Number of days offered online instruction)

We will control for potentially confounding variables, including year of study program, field of study,
age, and gender. For further details, see Attachment 3 – Data analysis plan.
We plan for separate analyses for each participating university/university college, and a pooled
analysis across institutions.

Ethics and data protection
We will use the University of Oslo’s solutions for online consent form, web-based survey
(Nettskjema), and secure storage of research data (TSD).

STUDY PROTOCOL, 27 August 2020
We will collect directly identifiable data, probably the participants’ e-mail addresses. This will enable
us to delete responses from participants who wish to withdraw from the study, to avoid sending
messages to students who do not wish to take part, and to link different responses from the same
respondent. The latter is of scientific importance as it allows monitoring of each participant over
time, thus making this a cohort study.
We do not plan to transfer the collected data out of Norway. If we do, all data will be fully
anonymized.
We will ensure highly secure data collection and data storage in collaboration with the data handler,
USIT at the University of Oslo. Data management will be in accordance with GDPR-regulations. Our
Data Protection Officer at the Norwegian Centre for Research Data, has assessed the project plan,
and found it satisfactory (19 August 2020).
We see few ethical dilemmas related to this project, apart from the need to ensure secure handling
of the collected person identifiable data. The only burden for the participants concerns the time
spent completing the survey. The Regional Ethical Committee has assessed and approved the project
plan (24 August, REK sør-øst A, reference number 172155).

Dissemination of findings
We will likely publish the findings in the format of scientific article in an open access medical journal.

Power analysis and sample size
We have carried out a power analysis to estimate the necessary sample size needed to detect
differences between students who are offered in-person instruction and students who are offered
online instruction. We make a number of assumptions in estimating the necessary sample size.
We assume an incidence of COVID-19 of 0.23 % over a 10-week intervention period for students who
are assigned to online instruction. This corresponds to the current level of disease in the age group
20-29 in Norway. If we wish to detect effects of in-person instruction that doubles the risk of disease,
we would need 21,000 respondents to be 80% certain to detect an effect at 5% significance level.
With a 50% response rate, we would need 42,000 students to be invited to the study. Oslo
Metropolitan University alone has around 20,000 students.
Several of these assumptions can be challenged. It is highly uncertain whether the spread of COVID19 will remain at its current level in the Norwegian student population, especially since the incidence
has been rising for the past four weeks. Furthermore, there are few if any other studies of COVID-19
interventions in university settings, and thus it is difficult to estimate a likely effect size. Finally, the
number of students who will be invited to this study remains to be seen, as it depends on the
number of universities that agree to participate in the study.
As there is a large information need on the impacts of COVID-19 interventions and a scarcity of
relevant studies, we furthermore believe the study can be beneficial even if underpowered and since
a randomized assignment of participants was not possible. It may provide a solid foundation for more
rigid, further intervention studies, and also possibly provide some evidence for the plausible range of
effect sizes to be expected from moving to online instruction. A further benefit of the study is to map
other important consequences of an online instruction intervention, such as effects on teaching
satisfaction and life satisfaction.
We have submitted a registration form for the study to ClinicalTrials.gov.

ATTACHMENT 3 – Data analysis plan

A main concern in using a non-random design is that the treatment and comparison groups vary in
observable and unobservable characteristics predictive of the outcome (infection). The main
measure that safeguards against the comparison group holding more characteristics predictive of the
outcome than the treatment group, is that the treatment (in-person instruction) was prescribed to
groups of students, i.e. students did not themselves individually select in-person or online
instruction. Whole classes where offered in-person instruction, and our main estimator is thus the
impact on infection of in-person instruction for everyone offered in-person instruction (intention to
treat, ITT [4]), not only those actually receiving in-person instruction.
It is still possible, of course, that the students being offered in-person instructions are more (or less)
prone to become infected than the students referred to online instructions, in which case the
estimates cannot be given a causal interpretation. The same will hold if the students who respond to
the questionnaire (compared to those note responding) are more (or less) prone to infection and
non-responding students are more prevalent in the group of students who are offered in-person
instruction than in the group referred to online instructions (or v.v.). To explore this empirically, we
will collect information that allows us to test the extent to which characteristics of the students
differed in the group offered in-person instruction vs. online instruction at the outset. We will
undertake balancing tests illustrated as follows:
Pre-determined_characteristici,t-k = a + b Offered_on_campus_instruction i,t + c X i,t-m
where i represents individual and t is time, k≥m>0. Even if balanced, we would expect about 1 in 20
tests to be significant at the 5% level of significance, and if more tests are significant this strongly
suggest that estimates should not be given a causal interpretation. If fewer are significant, we can
still not conclude that the intervention is “as good as randomly” distributed and we should be very
careful in making causal inference (1).
The most important pre-determined characteristic is likely the outcome variable before the
intervention, i.e. already having been infected. We will collect data on previous infection as well as
other (secondary) pre-determined outcome variables and characteristics that may be correlated with
infection. These are age, gender, birthplace, parents’ birth place, socio economic status (parents’
education level), GPA points at admission, admission basis, exam results previous semester (where
applicable), planned study credits, social behavior, living conditions, and use of public transport.
Importantly, we know a priori that some pre-determined variables are not balanced, by construction
of the intervention. Most clearly, it was a stated goal for many universities that first-year students
should be offered more in-person instruction than more senior students. Also, some fields of study
were more dependent on in-person instruction than others, and were given priority. All balancing
tests will therefore be performed with and without controlling for these “pre-stratification” variables
(the vector X). Specifically, we will consider including the following
-

Dummies for year of study program
Dummies for field of study
Dummies for courses
Age and gender

We will also consider models where two or all these variables are interacted. Interactions will reduce
the power to detect imbalance, but since the point is to run the exact same regression on the actual
outcome variable, including many interactions will also reduce the power to detect effects. This is

thus a classical trade-off between consistency and power. Since each university made different
considerations, in what groups of students where offered more in-person instruction, these “prestratification” variables will be adapted to the policy, as described by each university before the
intervention took place (or was changed).
Our population parameter (latent) of main interest is the effect of the intervention (offering inperson instruction) on the outcome (e.g. disease among the students). This ITT effect may be
attempted estimated in a model illustrated as follows:
Outcomei,t = a + b Offered_in_person_instruction i,t-m + c X i,t-k + d Z i,t-k
where k≥m≥0. X will include the same “pre-stratification” variables as in the balance test. With the
sole purpose to improve precision, we will also consider including more pre-determined variables
(i.e. the vector Z, like sex, age, place of birth, socioeconomic background, given that these variables
are not included in X). When assessing learning outcomes, GPA points at admission (by cohort and
admission basis) will be included as control variables.
The treatment variable will be operationalized both as two dummy variables: 80% or more of offered
th
instruction time (excluding practice-time) is in-person vs. less than 80%; from 75 percentile upward
th
with in-person instruction vs. from 25 downward with in-person instruction; and as a continuous
variable, i.e. percent of teaching time offered in-person. Because the virus may spread more and
more as the campus becomes more and more crowded, we will also estimate models allowing
increasing marginal effects on disease as the percent with in-person instruction increases (several
dummies).
Our primary outcome is (self-reported) infection, and secondary outcomes are
-

COVID-19 test taken (dummy, logistic regression)
Teaching satisfaction (scale, linear regression or multinomial logistic regression)
Quality of life (scale, linear regression or multinomial logistic regression)
Learning outcomes (completion and exam performance, linear regression or multinomial
logistic regression)

In addition to ITT, we will also estimate the following “endogenous” model (using same estimation
methods as described above):
Outcomei,t = a + b Actual_on_campus_time i,t-m + cX i,t-k + d Z i,t-k

Moreover, we will estimate the local average treatment effect (LATE) in the following two stage
model [4]
Actual_on_campus_time i,t-m = a + b Offered_in_person_instruction i,t-m + cX i,t-k + d Z i,t-k

Outcomei,t = a + b Actual_on_campus_tıme
i,t-m + cX i,t-k + d Z i,t-k

Where Actual_on_campus_tıme
in the second equation can be considered as the estimate from the
first stage (using e.g. 2SLS (1)). LATE is thus providing the effect of actually participating on campus
for the students being moved from online to in-person by the offer. There are several strong
assumptions necessary to give this a causal interpretation, where the exclusion restriction is typically
considered the most important in practice: There is no conditional (on X and Z) direct effect of the

offer of in-person instruction on the outcome, except through actual on-campus time, i.e. that the
offer can be excluded from the second equation. The condition will be violated, for example, if an
offer also affects transmission of the virus through more students meeting in other settings than oncampus (like more private parties). This assumption may be hard to defend, and the ITT estimate
may be more reliable and relevant for decisions to be taken by the universities in balancing in-person
and online instructions (1).
