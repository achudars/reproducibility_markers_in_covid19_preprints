Abstract

23

Introduction Seroprevalence and transmission routes of severe acute respiratory syndrome

24

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in children and adolescents, especially in school

25

setting, are not clear. Resulting uncertainty is reflected in very different decisions on school

26

closures and reopenings across countries. The aim of this longitudinal cohort study is to

27

assess the extent and patterns of seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in school-

28

attending children repeatedly. It will examine risk factors for infection, relationship between

29

seropositivity and symptoms, and temporal persistence of antibodies. Additionally, it will

30

include testing of school personnel and parents.

31

Methods and analysis The study (Ciao Corona) will enroll a regionally representative,

32

random sample of schools in the canton of Zurich, where 18% of the Swiss population live.

33

Children aged 5 to 16 years, attending classes in primary and secondary schools are invited.

34

Venous blood and saliva samples are collected for SARS-CoV-2 serological testing after the

35

first wave of infections (June/July 2020), in fall (October/November 2020), and after winter

36

(March/April 2021). Venous blood is also collected for serological testing of parents and

37

school personnel. Bi-monthly questionnaires to children, parents and school personnel cover

38

SARS-CoV-2 symptoms and tests, health, preventive behavior, lifestyle and quality of life

39

information. Total seroprevalence and cumulative incidence will be calculated. Hierarchical

40

Bayesian logistic regression models will account for sensitivity and specificity of the

41

serological test in the analyses and for the complex sampling structure, i.e., clustering within

42

classes and schools.

43

Ethics and dissemination The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Canton

44

of Zurich, Switzerland (2020-01336). The results of this study will be published in peer-

45

reviewed journals and will be made available to study participants and participating schools,

46

the Federal Office of Public Health, and the Educational Department of the canton of Zurich.

Introduction

65

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic vary greatly across and even within countries. While

66

some countries kept schools mostly open (e.g., Sweden, Australia) or reopened early (e.g.,

67

Denmark), others opted for prolonged closing with decision on reopening in late summer

68

2020 pending (e.g., the US, Italy, Ireland). Early school closure in response to pandemic was

69

partly guided by analogy of transmission of other viruses, such as influenza [1,2], but current

70

reports suggest that the susceptibility and transmissibility of children may be largely different

71

for SARS-CoV-2 compared [3]. Lower prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection is reported in

72

younger children – potentially as they are infected less frequently or as infections are more

73

frequently asymptomatic and thus underestimated [4–6]. Although children may infect others

74

less often than adults, their exact role in transmission pathways is still not clear [7].

75

Decisions on school opening or closing during the severe acute respiratory syndrome

A few studies have reported population-level seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2,

76

including the population of children [4,5]. Such studies focused on households, leaving the

77

role of schools in SARS-CoV-2 transmission unclear, especially as they were often

78

conducted during school closure. As most of school-aged children and adolescents’ social

79

interactions take place in family and school [8], schools could play a crucial role in spreading

80

the infection. Currently, mostly anecdotal evidence and case studies of SARS-CoV-2

81

infection spread in schools exist [9,10].

82

Many schools were or still are closed worldwide in response to the pandemic, without

83

solid arguments for or sufficient understanding of potential consequences of such a policy

84

[11]. 1.6 billion learners worldwide (90% of all) were affected by school closure [12]. In the

85

US, school closure was coordinated on state and district level, with all US public schools

86

eventually closing from March 25th, 2020 [13]. The opening of the schools might be delayed

87

in many districts, and the exact mode of teaching is still not clear [14]. In Switzerland,

88

schools were closed from March 16th to May 10th, 2020 (switching to home and online

schooling), then partly reopened until June 7th (e.g., teaching in half-classes, restricting larger

90

group activities, reducing school care groups), when regular teaching resumed again [15].

91

There is an urgent need for representative, population-based studies on children and

92

adolescents especially in the school setting, to answer questions about the prevalence,

93

infection routes, asymptomatic cases, risk factors, and duration of immunity to SARS-CoV-2

94

infection. This article reports the design and protocol of a longitudinal school-based

95

seroprevalence study conducted in the largest canton of Switzerland. The study is part of a

96

large nationally coordinated research network Corona Immunitas, and one of the first and

97

largest representative studies of SARS-CoV-2 spread in children and adolescents in schools,

98

globally.

Study objectives

106

The study focuses on the seroprevalence and potential clustering of SARS-CoV-2 infection in

107

children and adolescents attending school, as well as history, symptoms, and risk factors for

108

SARS-CoV-2, health, lifestyle and quality of life outcomes. It aims to address the following

109

objectives:

110

1. To repeatedly determine the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in school-aged

111

children covering grades one to eight (approximately 6-16 years old) after the lockdown

112

and the subsequent reopening of schools (June/July 2020), three months after the start

113

of the next school year (October/November 2020), and after the winter (March/April

114

2021);

115
116

2. To examine clustering of seropositive cases within classes, schools and districts, and
temporal evolution of the clusters;

3. To determine the proportion of asymptomatic children and adolescents with SARSCoV-2 antibodies;

119

4. To determine the duration of the acquired immunity by examining new infections in

120

children with positive serology and temporal persistence of detectable SARS-CoV-2

121

antibodies;

122
123

5. To identify sociodemographic, exposure, hygiene, school- and family-based behavioral
and environmental risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection;

124

6. To assess how school-children and their families adjust their lives and adopt preventive

125

measures for SARS-CoV-2 over extended periods of time, and how quality of life is

126

affected by the epidemic and preventive measures imposed or recommended by health

127

authorities;

128
129
130
131

7. To assess how schools adopt preventive measures for SARS-CoV-2 infection over
extended periods of time, and how they influence the infection rate;
8. To assess seroprevalence, clustering, and possible routes of transmission to and from
children, school personnel and parents.

132
133

Study design

134

This is a longitudinal, population-based observational study in a regionally-representative

135

cohort of children and adolescents from randomly selected schools and classes in the canton

136

of Zurich, Switzerland. The study is embedded in a Swiss-wide research program Corona

137

Immunitas (www.corona-immunitas.ch), where another 25’000 persons (mostly adults) will

138

be enrolled in over 20 prospective studies with fully aligned study protocols.

139

Children participants were enrolled from June 16th to July 9th, 2020, whereas parents and

140

school personnel are enrolled from August 20th to September 5th. The follow-up of enrolled

141

children and school personnel is planned until April 2021.

142

The longitudinal design allows for monitoring the evolution of the epidemic, as well as

143

the impact of school-based and other preventive measures. Three phases are pre-defined, with

144

the possibility for adaptation (i.e., adding Phase IV) according to the dynamic of the

145

pandemic:

146

● Phase I (June to September 2020): Baseline estimate of seroprevalence of SARS-Cov-

147

2 in school-children, parents and school personnel shortly after the lockdown and

148

subsequent re-opening of schools.

149
150
151
152

● Phase II (October/November 2020): Estimate of seroprevalence in the same cohort of
children and school personnel after the summer holiday and three months of school.
● Phase III (March/April 2021): Estimate of seroprevalence in children and school
personnel after the winter season.

153
154

Study setting: primary and secondary schools in Switzerland

155

One out of six (1.5 million) inhabitants of Switzerland live in the canton of Zurich.

156

The canton is divided into 12 districts (Figure 1). Details on population characteristics and

157

school system are provided in the online data supplement.

Ethical aspects

163

The study was approved by the Cantonal Ethics Committee Zurich (2020-01336). Written

164

informed consent is obtained from parents or legal guardians (referred to as parents further

165

on) of participating children. Children aged 14 years and older can confirm the consent

166

themselves. Additional informed consent is obtained for biobanking plasma samples for

167

subsequent testing within the scope of the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence study.

172

attending the selected classes are invited, except in mixed-age classes (only students from the

173

eligible grades invited).

174

Primary schools are selected randomly, and the closest secondary school

175

geographically is matched. The targeted number of schools to enroll per district ranges from

176

2 to 10 depending on the district size. After initial invitation round, school participation rate

177

is assessed and additional schools are selected within required districts, until the aimed

178

number is reached, or further recruitment would not be feasible. Population sizes and targeted

179

number of enrolled schools within districts is depicted in Figure 1.

180

The overall targeted number of schools is 58 (29 primary and 29 secondary schools).

181

We aim to invite at least 3 classes and at least 40 children per school level. The number of

182

classes and children to invite will be reassessed after calculating the average children

183

participation rate in the first week of enrollment. If needed, additional classes will be invited,

184

aiming to enroll at least 40 children per school level. Assuming a participation rate of 60-

185

80% per class, we would enroll 2100-2800 children in June/July 2020. We expect a

186

seroprevalence rate of 1 to 5% based on the existing research [4]. Depending on the

187

specificity and sensitivity parameters of the test, we expect precision of about ±2%.

190

Population: definition
Children and adolescents residing in Switzerland and attending a selected public or

191

private, primary or secondary school (approximate age 5 to 16 years) in the canton of Zurich

192

are eligible for the study, as well as their parents living in the same household, and the entire

193

personnel of participating schools. Main exclusion criteria are small school size (for schools)

194

and suspected or confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2 during testing (for participants). The

195

1st-2nd, 4th-5th and 7th-8th school grades are included. Third, 6 and 9 grades are excluded as

196

these students may move to another school after the summer break, and follow-up would be

197

compromised. In age-mixed learning classes in primary schools, only 1 and 5 grades are

precautions. First, information is provided, child’s identity and consent confirmed, and saliva

219

collected. Venous blood samples will be collected at supine position with the help of

220

anesthetic patches, applied 45-60 min prior to venipuncture. Participating children receive a

221

small age-appropriate gift (worth 5-20$) at the end of each testing.

222

Adults will be invited for testing in schools or at a testing center. Personal support to

223

fill in the online questionnaire will be offered during testing. Venous blood will be collected.

238

Blood and saliva samples for serological testing
For each child and adult participant, one sample (9 mL for children and 4.9 mL for

239

adults) of venous blood will be collected for the assessment of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

240

Plasma will be separated, aliquoted into 1mL tubes and biobanked at -20⁰C until testing.

241

Saliva samples are collected in clean tubes and enriched with virus transport medium.

242

Saliva will first be validated for serological testing. If serological testing in saliva is deemed

243

sufficiently accurate, venous blood sampling might not be necessary in further testing phases.

244

Conversely, if serological testing in saliva is deemed not accurate enough, saliva sample

245

collection will not be continued.

246

For serological analysis, an in-house developed bead-based binding assay based on

247

the Luminex technology will be used for children. The ABCORA test (version 2.0) provides

248

a highly differentiated picture of the immune response: immunoglobulins G (IgG), M (IgM)

249

and A (IgA) antibodies against four SARS-CoV-2 targets (receptor binding domain (RBD),

250

spike proteins S1 and S2), and the nucleocapsid protein (N) of SARS-CoV-2) are analyzed,

251

resulting in twelve analyzed parameters. Owing to the broad assessment of serological

252

parameters, the ABCORA 2.0 test provides an estimate of infection recency. Based on the

253

ABCORA 2.0 results the seroconversion status of a sample will be classified as positive,

254

weakly reactive, indeterminate, or negative, based on pre-specified threshold values of

255

detected antibody reactivities. In a validation study (unpublished) of 104 samples of SARS-

256

CoV-2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive persons and 251

257

samples of pre-pandemic, healthy blood donors, test had sensitivity of 93.3-95.2% (compared

258

to sensitivity of 88.5%-93.3% in commercially available tests) and specificity of 98.4-99.6%

259

(depending on the threshold definition of positive and negative cases).

For school personnel and parents, the SenASTrIS (Sensitive Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike

Collection of questionnaire data

267

Detailed information of data collected with each questionnaire is provided in the online data

268

supplement. Briefly, baseline and follow up questionnaires are filled online (when necessary,

269

on paper or over phone) for participating children by parents together with the child, and

270

school personnel (see Figure 2). Follow up questionnaires are sent approximately bi-monthly,

271

adapting to the school year timing, at least until April 2021. School principals will fill in

272

questionnaires at and between each testing phase.

273
274
275
276

Study data

277

Study data will be collected in REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture), a secure, web-

278

based application with access restricted to selected study personnel. The database will also be

279

used to send out online surveys to school personnel and parents, and deliver study results per

280

email. Further details are provided in the online data supplement.

Data management

281
282

Data analysis

283

Descriptive analysis of participant sociodemographic, lifestyle, and behavior information will

284

be performed. Total seroprevalence and cumulative incidence will be calculated, as well as

285

age-, time- and region-specific estimates. In order to also include the sensitivity and

286

specificity of the serological test in the analyses and account for the complex sampling

287

structure (clustering within classes and schools), hierarchical Bayesian logistic regression

288

models will be used.[4] The total numbers of school children in the respective grades per

289

district will be used for post-stratification, so that the estimates are representative for the

290

demographics of the canton of Zurich.

Associations with health and quality of life outcomes will be assessed with multiple

292

regression models. Other planned estimates include proportion of seropositive individuals

293

who have been asymptomatic, risk factors for infection at individual and school level.

294

Associations of levels of IgG, IgM and IgA antibodies with symptoms and risk factors will be

295

assessed.

Patient and public involvement

298

The study was initiated together with the Educational Department of the canton of Zurich.

299

Several school principals were consulted during the development of the protocol to ensure

300

feasibility of the planned study procedures. Early feedback was collected from children and

301

parents invited to participate, in order to adapt the communication strategies and channels.

302

Further feedback was collected from enrolled children and school principals during the first

303

testing phase, in order to adapt subsequent testing phases and adult testing. Numerous online

304

informational sessions, encouraging open exchange and feedback, were organized for school

305

principals, personnel and parents of the children. Results of individual tests will be

306

communicated to the participants, and overall study results disseminated to participating

307

schools. Findings will be disseminated in lay language in the national and local press, to the

308

national and regional educational and public health departments and to the website of the

309

study.

Discussion

312
313

This longitudinal population-based cohort study is unique for its focus on children and

314

adolescents in schools. Despite the lacking knowledge how schools contribute to the spread

315

of SARS-CoV-2 infection, major policy decisions on temporary school closure or schedules

316

have been implemented globally in response to the pandemic. This study will contribute to

317

explain the role of schools in order to define the necessary and sufficient preventive measures

318

to balance infection control and impact of school closure.

319

Currently available population-based seroprevalence studies, which have included

320

children, were mostly conducted in household setting. In May 2020, only 0.8% of children

321

aged 5-9 years were seropositive for SARS-Cov-2 in Geneva, Switzerland, in contrast to

322

9.6% of children and adolescents aged 10-19 years and 9.9% of adults aged 20-49 years [4].

323

In April and May 2020, 3.8% of children and adolescents aged 0-19 years were seropositive

324

in Spain, compared to 4.5% to 5.0% in older age groups [5]. In contrast, the current study

325

will primarily consider schools. By analyzing seroprevalence on individual, class and school

326

level, as well as in parents and school personnel, we will be able to identify clusters within

327

these structures. Such knowledge could help to decide if individual classes or whole schools

328

need to be closed to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection spread. In addition, by testing the entire

329

school personnel, it will inform which employees at schools are the most susceptible to

330

infection.

331

Only few related planned or ongoing studies have been reported worldwide. In the

332

UK, a study run by Public Health England aims to test seroprevalence in child care facilities

333

and schools in England in May/June, July, and end of autumn 2020 [17]. However, it is not

334

clear if the sampling of schools will be random or stratified by regions or if the structure

335

within schools (classes) will be considered. A smaller study in Berlin, Germany, aims to test

336

24 randomly selected schools, including 20-40 children and adolescents (500-1000 in total)

337

and 5-10 staff members at each school [18].

338

The results of this study will likely be generalizable to other cantons in Switzerland

339

and also worldwide, particularly to high- and middle-income countries. The canton of Zurich

340

includes both urban and rural settings, as well as an ethnically and linguistically diverse

341

population. Although the rates of seroprevalence are always location- and time- specific, we

342

believe that the longitudinal design will allow us to investigate many stages of the pandemic.

343

Due to urgency to launch the study, it faces a few challenges. First, high participation

344

rate of schools and children is required for sufficient power to analyze different regions and

345

clusters within classes and schools. We believe that the high public interest will lead to

346

increased participation, which could otherwise be rather limited in a study collecting venous

347

blood samples in children. In fact, in the initial testing phase in June/July 2020, 55 schools

348

and more than 2500 children were successfully enrolled. Second, the protocol of the

349

longitudinal study will have to be flexible as the pandemic and serological testing methods

350

develop. For this reason, the specific time points of serological testing cannot be fixed in

351

advance (e.g., in case of school closure during the course of the study). Similarly, in further

352

testing phases, it might be sufficient to do the serological testing in saliva or blood,

353

depending on the outcome of the validation of serological testing in saliva. Finally, in order

354

to recruit a sufficient number of schools still before school summer holidays, three rounds of

355

invitations were needed, leading to potential over- or under-sampling of schools in certain

356

districts. However, the sampling discrepancies can be adjusted with weighing of results.

357
358

Conclusions

359

This population-based cohort study with randomly selected schools and classes across the age

360

range for mandatory school time offers a unique opportunity to observe the longitudinal

361

spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children in schools, as well as in their parents and school

362

personnel, thus studying the whole school community. It will report SARS-CoV-2

363

seroprevalence in children by age groups and regions, provide essential information on

364

possible transmission routes and immunity over time, and assess individual and school-level

365

risk factors for infection. The longitudinal design will allow describing temporal trends of

366

immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and evaluating effects of school structure and preventive

367

measures. It will inform goal-oriented policy decisions in school management during

368

subsequent outbreaks.
