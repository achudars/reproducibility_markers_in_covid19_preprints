ABSTRACT

47

Background: Modulation of the immune system to prevent lung injury is being widely

48

used against the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) despite the scarcity of evidence.

49

Methods: We report the preliminary results from the Vall d’Hebron prospective cohort

50

study at Vall d’Hebron University Hospital, in Barcelona (Spain), including all consecutive

51

patients who had a confirmed infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome

52

coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and who were treated with tocilizumab until March 25th. The

53

primary endpoint was mortality at 7 days after tocilizumab administration. Secondary

54

endpoints were admission to the intensive care unit, development of ARDS and respiratory

55

insufficiency among others.

56

Results: 82 patients with COVID-19 received at least one dose of tocilizumab. The mean

57

(± SD) age was 59.1 (19.8) years, 63% were male, 22% were of non-Spanish ancestry, and

58

the median (IQR) age-adjusted Charlson index at baseline was 3 (1-4) points. Respiratory

59

failure and ARDS developed in 62 (75.6%) and 45 (54.9%) patients, respectively. Median

60

time from symptom onset to ARDS development was 8 (5-11) days. The median time from

61

symptom onset to the first dose of tocilizumab was 9 (7-11) days. Mortality at 7 days was

62

26.8%. Hazard ratio for mortality was 3.3; 95% CI, 1.3 to 8.5 (age-adjusted hazard ratio for

63

mortality 2.1; 95% CI, 0.8 to 5.8) if tocilizumab was administered after the onset of ARDS.

64

Conclusion: Time from lung injury onset to tocilizumab administration may be critical to

65

patient recovery. Our preliminary data could inform bedside decisions until more data from

66

clinical trials becomes available.

INTRODUCTION:

70

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel illness caused by severe acute respiratory

71

syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). It was first reported in December 2019 in Hubei

72

province, China.1 Since then, SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly spread worldwide.

73

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), as of July 8th, 2020, there have been

74

11.669.259 laboratory-confirmed cases and 539.906 deaths.2 The crude case fatality rate,

75

estimated to be between 2.3% and 3.3%, is highly dependent on age and underlying

76

conditions.3,4 Death is mainly due to respiratory failure caused by an acute respiratory

77

distress syndrome (ARDS). As the pathophisiology behind lung injury is progressively

78

elucidated, several therapies have been proposed on the basis of pre-clinical studies and the

79

previous experience with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)

80

and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV).5,6 Many of them

81

are being used off-label in a desperate attempt to improve patient outcomes, including

82

antiviral therapies, coagulation-modifying drugs and immune-modulating therapies.7–11

83

In COVID-19, an excessive immune response inducing disproportionate release of

84

cytokines and hyperinflammation has been proposed as a cause for the lung damage,

85

mimicking a secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.12 Host-directed therapies

86

have immune-modulating properties with higher precision than steroids and other immune-

87

modulating therapies.13 Tocilizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits

88

interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor with a well-known safety profile and is approved for the

89

treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and, since 2017, the treatment of chimeric antigen receptor

90

(CAR) T cell-induced severe or life-threatening cytokine release syndrome (CRS).14,15 It

91

has been used with promising results in small retrospective cohort studies of SARS-CoV-2

92

infected patients in China.9,16 The efficacy of other host-directed therapies targeting

93

hyperinflammation is being assessed under randomized clinical trial conditions for severe

94

SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.17,18

95

However, a proper characterization of the subset of patients who will benefit most from

96

host-directed therapy and defining the precise timing for host-directed therapies

97

administration has not yet been performed and is critical to allocate limited drug stocks and

98

reduce COVID-19 associated mortality. We aim to describe a prospective cohort of SARS-

99

CoV-2 infected patients treated with tocilizumab and define risk factors associated with

100

poor outcome.

METHODS

102

Study setting and population

103

The Vall d’Hebron COVID-19 Prospective Cohort Study includes all consecutive adult

104

patients (≥ 18 years old) treated for COVID-19 at Vall d’Hebron University Hospital, a

105

1100-bed public tertiary care hospital in Barcelona, Spain. For this study we selected the

106

subgroup of patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and radiologically confirmed

107

pneumonia who received at least one dose of tocilizumab. Identification and inclusion of

108

patients receiving tocilizumab was performed from the Pharmacy Department registry.

109

Standard of care and tocilizumab administration criteria

110

At admission, all patients were initially evaluated with chest radiography and blood tests

111

including complete cell count, coagulation studies, biochemistry and inflammatory

112

parameters. Treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir, azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine was

113

initiated according to Vall d’Hebron University Hospital protocol. Tocilizumab was

114

considered as additional treatment in patients with the following criteria: 1) respiratory

115

failure defined as a ratio of arterial oxygen tension to fraction of inspired oxygen

116

(PaO2/FiO2 ratio) of <300, a ratio of arterial oxygen saturation measured by pulse

117

oximetry to fraction of inspired oxygen (SpO2/FiO2 ratio) of <315 or pO2 <60mmHg or

118

oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry less than 90% when breathing room air or

119

rapidly progressive clinical worsening according to treating physician and 2) interleukin-6

120

(IL-6) levels >40pg/mL (reference 0-4.3pg/mL) or a D-dimer levels > 1500 ng/mL

121

(reference 0-243 pg/mL). Two dosing regimens based on weight were considered for

122

tocilizumab. Patients over 75kg received 600mg, otherwise 400mg was the preferred dose.

123

A second dose was considered in patients with a poor early response. Patients with liver

124

enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase) 5 times over the upper

125

limit of normality or concomitant severe bacterial infection were not eligible for

126

tocilizumab treatment.

127

Data sources

128

Data were collected retrospectively from the medical charts of tpatients from the 13th of

129

March, 2020 to the 18th of March, 2020, when the protocol was submitted to the

130

institutional review board, and prospectively thereafter. Inclusion and follow-up are still

131

ongoing. The cut-off data for inclusion in this sub-study was the 25th of March, 2020. All

132

patients included were followed for at least 7 days. The institutional review board provided

133

ethical clearance (local review board code number: PR(AG)183/2020). Patients were asked

134

for an oral consent. The institutional review board granted an informed consent waiver if

135

patients were unable to give oral consent. Written consent was waived because of the crisis

136

context and concerns about safety when introducing a physical support for the consent in

137

the isolation areas.

138

A Laboratory-confirmed case was defined as a patient with a real-time reverse-

139

transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) SARS-CoV-2 positive result in any

140

respiratory sample (nasopharyngeal swab, sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage or aspirate,

141

tracheal aspirate).

142

We collected sociodemographic characteristics, past medical history, Charlson comorbidity

143

score, concomitant medication, current therapy, adverse drug events, blood test results,

144

imaging studies, microbiological tests other than SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR on respiratory

145

samples when available, and supportive measures needed. Vital signs, symptoms and

146

physical examination were evaluated on admission, at 48h and weekly during hospital

147

admission. Laboratory, microbiology and imaging studies were performed on admission

148

and thereafter according to the clinical care needs of each patient. Laboratory assessments

149

consisted of a complete blood count, coagulation testing including D-dimer measurement,

150

liver and renal tests, electrolyte profile, and inflammatory profile including C-reactive

151

protein, fibrinogen, ferritin and IL-6. All radiographs were reviewed by the investigators

152

and computed tomography (CT) scans were recorded according to the radiology department

153

reports. The COVID-19 severity was measured with the CURB-65 scale for community

154

acquired pneumonia and other scales.19,20 Data was recorded in the Research Electronic

155

Data Capture software (REDCap, Vanderbilt University).

156

Laboratory confirmation

157

From the onset of the outbreak until 15th of March the microbiological diagnosis was based

158

on a homebrew RT-PCR assay targeting two viral targets (N1 and N2) in the viral

159

nucleocapsid (N) gene and one in the envelope (E) gene of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the

160

human RNase P (RP) gene as an internal control of the whole process, according to the

161

CDC and ECDC Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panels with minor modifications.21 Since

162

March 15th, commercial Allplex™ 2019-nCoV multiplex RT-PCR (Seegene, South Korea)

163

were used for the detection of three viral targets (E; N; and, RNA-dependent RNA

164

polymerase, RdRp) and an internal control. First SARS-CoV-2 laboratory-confirmations

165

were confirmed by RdRp sequencing.22,23 Total nucleic acids (DNA/RNA) were extracted

166

from respiratory specimens using NucliSENS easyMAG (BioMerieux, France)

167

and STARMag Universal Cartridge Kit (Seegene, South Korea) according to the

168

manufacturer’s instructions. All microbiological procedures were carried out in the

169

laboratory under Biosafety Level 2 conditions.

171

The primary simple endpoint was defined as death at 7 days after first dose of tocilizumab.

172

Secondary outcomes were admission to Intensive Care Unit (ICU), acute Respiratory

173

Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory insufficiency. We also assessed acute

174

myocardial infarction, septic shock, acute kidney injury and secondary infections. Berlin

175

criteria for the ARDS were adapted, as many of the patients did not have an available

176

arterial O2 pressure due to the overwhelming volume of admitted patients that precluded us

177

from performing arterial blood samples on all patients. Instead, we used oxygen saturation

178

by pulse oximetry and its correlation to the inspired fraction of oxygen (SpO2/FiO2 ratio <

179

315).24,25 One patient died a few hours after receiving tocilizumab and was excluded from

180

the primary endpoint analysis.

181

Statistical analysis

182

Continuous variables were expressed as mean and standard deviation or medians and

183

interquartile range, as appropriate. Categorical variables were summarized as absolute

184

number and percentages. Comparisons among groups was performed with Chi squared test

185

and Fisher’s test for categorical variables; and Student’s T test and Mann-Whitney U test

186

for continuous variables. Box plots and bar plots are also provided for some associations.

187

Mortality in the cohort was described with the use of Kaplan-Meier analysis. Tests were

188

considered significant when the two-tailed p-value was <0.05. We did not correct for

189

multiple comparisons; hence, the widths of the confidence intervals should not be

190

interpreted as definitive for the associations with the outcomes. Association between time

191

to tocilizumab administration and mortality were assessed by means of Cox proportional

192

hazards regression. Missing urea and bilirubin levels on admission were assumed normal

193

for CURB-65 and SOFA calculation; no other imputation was made for missing data.

194

Analysis was performed with Stata 15.1 software (StataCorp).

RESULTS:

204

Demographic and clinical characteristics

205

Since the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak until March 25th, 3242 respiratory-derived

206

samples have been requested from our institution for COVID-19 diagnosis. Samples were

207

requested from the emergency room and hospital wards, as well as from the health care

208

worker surveillance strategy plan. From them, 941 were positive (29%). During this period,

209

82 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients received at least one dose of tocilizumab. The mean

210

(±SD) age was 59.1 (±19.8) years (95% Confidence Interval 54.8-63.5). Fifty-two patients

211

were male (63.5%). Eighteen (21.9%) patients were born abroad, 13 (16.1%) in Latin

212

America, 3 (3.7%) in Eastern Europe and 2 (2.4%) in North Africa. The mean (±SD)

213

duration of symptoms before hospital admission was 6.7 (±4.4) days. Fever and cough were

214

the main symptoms on admission, occurring in 75 (91.5%) and 71 (86.6%) cases

215

respectively.

216

Thirty-three (40.3%) patients were former or active tobacco smokers. Coexisting conditions

217

were as follows: 32 (39.0%) had hypertension, 19 (23.5%) had lung diseases (2 (2.4%)

218

asthma, 6 (7.3%) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease among others), 17 (20.7%) had

219

obesity, 16 (19.5%) had diabetes mellitus, 11 (13.6%) had chronic kidney disease, 5 (6.1%)

220

a history of cardiac failure, 1 (1.2%) had cirrhosis. Ten (12.5%) patients were

221

immunosuppressed because of different conditions. Seventy-seven (95.1%) patients had a

222

Barthel scale index of 100 points previous to hospital admission. Table 1 shows

223

demographic and clinical characteristics at baseline.

224

Laboratory and Radiologic findings

225

On admission, mean (±SD) white cell count was 9.2 (10.4) with 17 (21.3%) patients having

226

more than 10000 per cubic millilitre white cells. Lymphocytopenia (<1000 cells per cubic

millilitre) was present in 46 (57.5%) patients. Interleukin-6 median (IQR) plasma level on

228

admission was 74.8 (49.4-120.0) ng/ml. Liver enzymes were below five times the upper

229

normal value in all patients. Pneumonia was radiologically proven in all patients on

230

admission or during follow up. Tables 2 and 3 describe laboratory and radiologic findings

231

on admission and during follow up.

232

Microbiologic results

233

All included patients had a positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 in a respiratory-derived

234

sample. On admission, 2 patients out of 56 had a positive pneumococcal urinary antigen

235

result. Sputum samples from 13 patients were sent on admission, bacterial growth was

236

demonstrated in 3 samples, two with Haemophilus influenzae that were considered

237

clinically significant and one was deemed contamination with oral bacteria. During the first

238

7 days follow up, 2 more positive results were retrieved: one Extended-Spectrum Beta-

239

Lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli (considered clinically significant) and one

240

Staphylococcus epidermidis (considered non-clinically significant). Blood cultures from 65

241

patients were sent, and one positive bacterial growth (coagulase-negative Staphylococcus)

242

was observed, although considered a contamination. Detailed microbiologic data are shown

243

in Table 3.

244

Oxygen supplementation and secondary outcomes.

245

Table 4 shows oxygen saturation, oxygen supplementation and ventilation support. On

246

admission, mean FiO2 oxygen supplementation was 0.36 (±0.26) and mean oxygen

247

saturation was 94% (±4.39). Regarding oxygen supplementation devices on admission, 34

248

(41.5%) patients were on oxygen supplementation: two (5.8%) patients were on nasal

249

cannulas, 22 (64.7%) were using face masks, 9 (26.5%) patients were using high oxygen

250

supplementation devices and 1 (2.9%) patient required endotracheal intubation with

mechanical ventilation. Over time, SpO2/FiO2 ratio deteriorated from a median (IQR) of

252

428 (316.1-454.8) on admission, 271.4 (158.3-361.5) at 48 hours and 230.2 (118.8-346.4)

253

at 7 days follow up (p<0.001). Fifty-five (69.6%) patients required intensive oxygen

254

therapy, including high flow oxygen delivery systems, high flow nasal cannula, non-

255

invasive mechanical ventilation or invasive ventilation during the study period. Median

256

(IQR) days on high flow oxygen delivery systems, high flow nasal cannula, non-invasive

257

mechanical ventilation or invasive ventilation before progression to other intensive oxygen

258

therapy, outcome attainment or data censoring were 2.0 (1.0-3.0), 4.0 (2.0-6.0), 3.0 (2.0-

259

4.0) and 9.0 (9.0-9.0) respectively. The median (IQR) days from admission to first intensive

260

oxygen therapy was 2.0 (1.0-4.5). Only one (1.2%) patient required vasopressor therapy

261

due to hypotension. No patient required renal replacement therapy. Respiratory failure and

262

ARDS developed in 62 (75.6%) and 45 (54.9%) patients, respectively. Median (IQR) days

263

from symptoms to respiratory failure and ARDS were 8 (6.0-11.0) and 8 (5.0-11.0)

264

respectively. Median (IQR) days from admission to respiratory failure and ARDS were 1

265

(0.0-3.0) and 2 (1.0-4.0) respectively. Secondary outcomes can be found in Table 5.

266

Tocilizumab treatment and concomitant treatment

267

Eighty-one (98.9%) patients received hydroxychloroquine, 63 (76.8%) lopinavir/ritonavir,

268

21 (25.61%) darunavir/cobicistat, and 79 (96.34%) azithromycin. All patients were initially

269

treated with antibiotic therapy, mainly ceftriaxone (77 (93.9%) patients). As expressed

270

before, all patients received at least one dose of tocilizumab. Median (IQR) time in days

271

from symptom onset to tocilizumab administration was 9.0 (6.0-11.0) and from admission

272

to tocilizumab administration was 2.0 (1.0-3.0)). Other treatments include cytokine

273

hemoadsorption therapy in 2 (2.4%) patients in ICU.

Table 6 summarizes primary outcome in the study population. At the end of the follow up

276

period, of the 82 patients 34 (41.5%) had been discharged, 22 (26.8%) had died, 14 (17.1%)

277

were hospitalized in ICU, 9 (11.0%) were hospitalized in medical wards, and 3 (3.7%) had

278

been transferred to another institution. In the univariate analysis age, age-adjusted Charlson

279

comorbidity index, medical history of active or former solid cancer, hypertension, history

280

of heart failure, chronic kidney disease and worse age-adjusted Charlson index at baseline

281

were associated with increased risk of mortality (Table 7). By 7-day follow-up, the

282

mortality rate was 4.0% per person-day (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.4% to 6.2%) by

283

Kaplan-Meier analysis. Mortality was more frequent in patients receiving tocilizumab once

284

ARDS was present (hazard ratio for mortality 3.3; 95% CI, 1.3 to 8.5; age-adjusted hazard

285

ratio for mortality 2.1; 95% CI, 0.8 to 5.8)(Figure 1) or respiratory failure was present

286

(hazard ratio for mortality 3.13; 95% CI, 1.3 to 7.8; age-adjusted hazard ratio for mortality

287

2.4; 95% CI, 0.9 to 6.4)(Figure 2). When dividing patients according to the nearest

288

SpO2/FiO2 ratio to tocilizumab administration, mortality was higher among patients with

289

lower SpO2/FiO2 ratio (SpO2/FiO2 ratio<200, 46.2%; SpO2/FiO2 ratio 200-300, 16.7%;

290

SpO2/FiO2 ratio >300, 20.6%; p=0.03)(Figure 3). Distribution of the nearest SpO2/FiO2

291

ratio to tocilizumab administration depending on outcome groups was not statistically

292

significant (mean (SD) SpO2/FiO2 ratio: 321.3 (154.7) dead, 343.1 (132.7) ICU, 396.9

293

(96.2) alive; p=0.2)(Figure 4). No correlation was observed between nearest IL-6 levels to

294

tocilizumab administration and main outcome (median (IQR) IL-6 levels: 79.7 (48.2-128.1)

295

dead, 77.5 (55-120) ICU admission, 71.4 (49.4-116) alive; p=0.92). Basal characteristics of

DISCUSSION

310

This preliminary report from the Vall d’Hebron COVID-19 Prospective Cohort Study

311

describes the characteristics and clinical outcomes of patients who were hospitalized in

312

non-ICU wards and received treatment with tocilizumab. Our results show that a timely

313

administration of immune-modulating therapies, before the onset of respiratory

314

insufficiency or ARDS, may improve severe COVID-19 patients’ outcomes.

315

Therapies to improve outcomes of patients with COVID-19 focus on viral-directed

316

therapies and host-directed therapies. There is still lack of evidence about the efficacy of

317

any of these therapies, although this does not prevent physicians to use all sorts of off-label

318

therapies despite the risk of serious adverse events.26 Therapies to curb uncontrolled

319

cytokine release have been proposed and are being widely used. Randomized controlled

320

trials with host-directed therapies are currently under way and results will be available

321

within the next months.17,18 Meanwhile, data from prospective studies can help to improve

322

COVID-19 patient management. In our study, the 7-day mortality was 26.8%, slightly

323

higher than a recent experience with remdesivir and similar to the mortality of 22.1%

324

reported in another study with lopinavir/ritonavir.27,28 However, the patients in our

325

prospective cohort had more coexisting conditions, including potential mortality risk

326

factors such as hypertension, other cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, chronic kidney

327

disease and cancer.

328

The understanding of mortality risk factors in patients with COVID-19 is an evolving

329

matter. Age, specific coexisting conditions and laboratory parameters may help identify

330

patients with poor outcome.29 As expressed before, in our cohort of patients treated with

331

tocilizumab, hypertension, history of cardiac failure and chronic kidney disease were

332

associated with higher mortality in the univariate analysis. Antihypertensive agents, such as

333

angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers

334

(ARB), have been suggested to be associated with the increased mortality observed in this

335

subset of patients. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 plays an important role in SARS-CoV-

336

2 viral entry as co-receptor.30 Hypothesis outline that the interactions between these drugs

337

and co-receptors may increase viral spreading in the lung and increase risk of death.

338

However, the evidence is limited and no specific recommendations could be drawn from

339

current evidence, especially when ACEI and ARB have shown to reduce mortality in this at

340

risk population.31 The Vall d’Hebron COVID-19 Prospective Cohort Study has among its

341

main objectives to analyse the role of these and other drugs used to treat chronic conditions

342

in the prognosis of patients with COVID-19.

343

Host-directed therapies aiming at blocking an unrestrained immune response and an

344

excessive inflammation have been proposed as potential therapies to prevent acute lung

345

injury and subsequent ARDS. SARS-CoV-2 infection severity has been associated with an

346

increase in IL-6 and D dimer levels, and the cytokine profile resembles that of other

347

conditions in which host-directed therapies have been successfully used.13,29,32 Timely use

348

of host-directed therapies may curb uncontrolled cytokine release and prevent damage

349

inflicted by hyperinflammation. Tocilizumab has shown to be safe in two small Chinese

350

cohort studies of patients with COVID-19.9,16 Efficacy of tocilizumab, measured as hospital

351

discharge, was 90.5% (19 out of 21 patients) in patients with COVID-19 needing oxygen

352

supplementation and having elevated IL-6 in one study9; while the other study showed 3

353

deaths, 10 clinical stabilizations and 2 clinical aggravations out of 15 patients.16 Other

354

laboratory and radiologic findings also improved in a short period of time. However,

355

standard of care in the studies was different limiting the possibility of direct comparisons.

356

As in other infections and inflammation-driven diseases, timely initiation of precise therapy

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.07.20094599; this version posted July 10, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

357

is the mainstay of patient management and directly affects mortality and morbidity. Our

358

study showed that patients receiving prompt treatment with tocilizumab before lung injury

359

is established have less 7-day mortality, a benefit that may be sustained in the long-term.33

360

The safety profile of tocilizumab has been extensively studied in clinical trials with patients

361

suffering autoimmune diseases. The most common adverse events of intravenous

362

tocilizumab in a pooled analysis of 3 clinical trials were upper respiratory infections,

363

nasopharyngitis, headache, hypertension and increase in liver enzymes. Serious adverse

364

events occurred in 12% of the patients, infectious diseases being the most common.34 In our

365

study we did not report any serious adverse events, although the symptoms of systemic

366

viral infections may mimic any adverse event and make its identification difficult.

367

Tozilizumab-related bacterial infections were not reported in our study. Two factors may

368

have contributed to this: first, many patients were under antibiotic treatment, and second,

369

the short follow up period precludes us from any further analysis. Nevertheless, the low

370

cumulative dose administered in this subset of patients may diminish the likelihood of

371

infectious adverse events.

372

In a time of scarce medical resources, including limited stock of host-directed therapies,

373

hard medical decisions have to be done by front-line physicians. Allocation of therapies to

374

patients with the highest chances of a favourable outcome should be encouraged,

375

maximizing the benefit of the intervention.35 Evidence-based decision-making and benefit-

376

maximizing allocation of the available resources should be promoted. In this regard our

377

study can help physicians to better allocate host-directed therapy in patients with COVID-

378

19 prioritizing moderate-to-severe ill patients over critically ill patients.

379

This preliminary exploratory study has several limitations. First, there is no control group

380

and the minimum follow up period was 7 days. Therefore, at this point it is not possible to

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.07.20094599; this version posted July 10, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

381

evaluate the differences between patients receiving tocilizumab or not and, consequently, it

382

is not possible to evaluate solidly what is the overall benefit of administering this drug.

383

However, the urgency of obtaining data on new therapies justifies the early communication

384

of these results. Second, ICU admission is not a very robust endpoint since it depends on

385

the attitudes of the treating physicians as well as the availability of beds at times of resource

386

scarcity and overwhelming demand. For this reason, mortality was selected as the main

387

outcome in our study. Besides, the subsequent analysis of all patients included in the Vall

388

d’Hebron COVID-19 Prospective Cohort Study may solve this limitation and inform results

389

with a longer follow up period. Finally, our data is limited to a single centre. While our

390

results may not be extrapolated to other populations or other standards of care, the

391

management of patients was homogeneous avoiding the centre effect of multicentric

392

studies. Multivariate analysis is limited by sample size.

393

CONCLUSION

394

In summary, we found a mortality rate of 26.8% in this subset of patients with COVID-19

395

receiving tocilizumab for the treatment of inflammatory-related lung injury. Time from

396

lung injury onset to tocilizumab administration may be critical to patient recovery. Our

397

results may help front-line physician to make evidence-based decisions in times of scarce

398

resources and operationalized fair and transparent allocation procedures, maximizing the

399

benefit of the intervention. Future and current host-directed clinical trials for patients with

400

COVID-19 should consider our preliminary data in their design. All our patients were

401

treated with a combination of antiviral drugs whose efficacy is yet to be demonstrated.

402

Host-directed therapies in the absence of antiviral drugs needs further investigation.
