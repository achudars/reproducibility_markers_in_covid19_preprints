Abstract
Acid suppressants are a widely-used class of medications previously linked to an increased risk of aerodigestive
infections. However, prior studies of these medications as potentially reversible risk factors for COVID-19 have
been conflicting. We performed a case-control study involving clinician-abstracted data from 900 health records
across 3 US medical centers. We incorporated sociobehavioral predictors of infectious exposure using geomapping
to publicly-available data. We found no evidence for an association between chronic acid suppression and incident
COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratio 1.04, 95% CI: 0.92-1.17, P=0.515). However, we identified several medical and

social features as positive (Latinx ethnicity, BMI ≥ 30, dementia, public transportation use, month of the pandemic)
and negative (female sex, concurrent solid tumor, alcohol use disorder) predictors of new-onset infection. These
results place both medical and social factors on the same scale within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, and
underscore the importance of comprehensive models of disease.

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2), has affected over 70 million individuals across the globe and killed over 1.6 million as of December 2020,
one year after it was first reported in Wuhan, China.1 Previous studies have examined risk factors for infection and
predictors of disease severity. Established medical risk factors predicting infection and severity encompass age > 65,
diabetes mellitus, obesity, smoking, chronic pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease,
malignancy and chronic HIV infection.2-7
Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H2-receptor antagonosts (H2RAs) are among the most commonly
prescribed medications, used for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and peptic ulcer disease.8,9 Prior work
investigating the link between PPIs and aerodigestive infections such as pneumonia has driven the initial hypothesis
that PPIs could potentially compromise physiological barriers to SARS-CoV-2 infectivity.9,10 Although current
medical literature has focused on the identification and quantification of medical-related risk factors, there is a
paucity of data on how socioeconomic and behavioral influences on infection risk compared to conventional medical
factors. Here, we sought to investigate if there is an association between chronic acid suppression and SARS-CoV-2
infection in patients seen at three urban health systems in California while accounting for concomitant social
determinants of health.

Methods
Study Design
This is a case-control study involving the review of medical records from three campuses of the University
of California (UC) Health system: San Francisco, San Diego, and Los Angeles. The study was approved by the
Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF; IRB #20-30549). The
decision made by UCSF’s IRB was relied upon by the IRB of the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) via a

memorandum of understanding (UC IRB Reliance #3499). The decision made by the IRB of the University of
California, Los Angeles (UCLA) was that this study did not constitute human subjects research and therefore was
exempt.
At the time of the study’s inception in May 2020, deidentified databases of electronic health records (EHR)
data at UC Health were queried to to support sample size calculations. At that time, the estimated prevalence of
positivity for SARS-CoV-2 virus was 5.6% among those tested across all campuses of UC Health. At UCSF, the
prevalence of PPI use was estimated to be 7.5%. We obtained approximate effect sizes from a prior study that
assessed the relative risk of acute gastroenteritis among chronic PPI users, motivated in part by work suggesting the
possible enteric transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.11,12 We calculated that at least 416 cases and controls would
be needed to detect two-fold relative risk among chronic PPI users compared to non-users with 80% power. These
numbers were rounded up to obtain 450 cases and controls each, or 900 medical records in total. These were divided
evenly across all three participating sites (300 records each).

Patient Selection and Data Collection
Records of all patients who underwent SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal PCR testing at any of the three health
systems (UCSF, UCSD, UCLA) from March 1, 2020 to June 10, 2020 were separately retrieved via EHR database
query. Stratified uniform sampling was performed to yield 150 cases and 150 controls for manual review at each
site. A standardized case report form and accompanying data dictionary were developed. Data elements included
PPI and H2RA use, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), additional medical comorbidities and immunocompromised
states, and sociodemographic factors (Supplemental Methods). Variable definitions and data extraction process
was determined and fixed a priori and based on consensus among the co-authors.
Medical records of all patients ≥ 18 years old at the time of their initial SARS-COV-2 test were included in
the study database. Result of the SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing was determined by documentation in the EHR of each
site. For patients who were tested more than once during the data collection period and were consistently negative,
the date of the first result was recorded. Patients who tested positive after an initial negative test(s) were recorded as
positive, and the date of the first positive test was recorded. Chronic acid suppression was defined as the use of PPI
or H2RA daily or as needed for at least four weeks, documented by medical providers in charts or prescription refill
records.

All medical history was reviewed and annotated by physicians (BZ, AS, SB, SD, DR). Disagreements
during extraction pertaining to the coding of specific variables were adjudicated through discussion and resolved
through consensus voting (Supplemental Methods). The extraction sheet was modified once to better capture race
and ethnicity. Following the completion of data abstraction, datasheets were compiled and subject to quality control
measures via both manual (JS) and informatic methods in order to ensure consistent and accurate data capture across
all three sites.

Geomapping Social Determinants of Health
Patient records were mapped to geographic areas using postal zip codes corresponding to their home
address. However, most geocoded data including reports from the United States Census utilize zip code tabulation
areas (ZCTAs). Postal zip codes were mapped to zip code tabulation areas (ZCTAs), with the method implemented
by Williams-Holt.13-15
Geocoded covariates related to population and housing density were obtained from the 2010 United States
Decennial Census.16 Additional geocoded covariates were obtained from the 2018 United States American
Community Survey (ACS) using the R package tidycensus v0.9.9.2.17 For each ZCTA, median household income,
public transportation as means of transportation to work for workers 16 and over, and walking as means of
transportation to work for workers 16 and over were extracted.
The United States Census Bureau provides Community Resilience Estimates (CREs) at the census tract
level defining what percentage of residents in a census tract have 3+ risk factors, 1-2 risk factors, or 0 risk factors.18
These risk factors are derived from the 2018 American Community Survey (ACS) and the 2018 National Health
Interview Survey (NHIS).
Mask-wearing by county was obtained from a survey conducted by The New York Times.19 Briefly, survey
responses were collected from 250,000 individuals between 7/2/2020 and 7/14/2020 who were asked: “How often
do you wear a mask in public when you expect to be within six feet of another person?” The possible responses
were: never, rarely, sometimes, frequently, and always.
Daily social distancing mobility data was obtained from the data company SafeGraph.20,21 Briefly, daily
anonymized and aggregated mobile device data were obtained from SafeGraph from 2-12-2020 through 7-12-2020.
Mobile devices were aggregated by Census Block Groups (CBGs) based on home location and the median

percentage of time a device was observed at home versus observed at all during a given time period was calculated
for all observed devices in a CBG each day.
SARS-COV-2 Community Mobility Reports were obtained from Google from February 2020 through July
2020.22 Briefly, these reports quantify how visits and length of stay at various locations changed compared to a
baseline using aggregated and anonymized data from users who opted into Google Location History. Google
reported daily values for time spent at the following locations aggregated at the county level: grocery & pharmacy,
parks, transit stations, retail & recreation, residential, and workplaces. The time spent at a location was represented
as a percent change of time spent at the location compared to the baseline.
The Social Deprivation Index (SDI) has previously been used to quantify levels of disadvantage and
evaluate their associations with health outcomes.23 The SDI used in this study was developed by the Robert Graham
Center and is comprised of seven demographic characteristics from the 2015 ACS.24 These characteristics include:
income, education, employment, housing, household characteristics, transportation, and demographics. Reported
SDI measures for ZCTAs were used in this analysis.

Outcomes
The primary outcome was association between chronic acid suppression (PPIs, H2RAs) and risk of SARSCOV-2 infection. Secondary outcomes included the association between SARS-COV-2 infection and the month of
testing, demographics, comorbid medical conditions, immunocompromised state, CCI, and social and mobility
variables (Supplemental Table 1).

Statistical Analysis
Medical records and covariates with a high degree of missing data (>40%) were excluded from subsequent
analysis. Multiple imputation was then performed using the R package mice v3.11.0 to impute 10 datasets with 20
iterations per dataset to ensure convergence.25
Continuous covariates were converted to binary variables for interpretability in the logistic regression
model and corresponding forest plot. To identify binary cut points which may be associated with an increased
chance of a positive SARS-COV-2 test, we conducted a grid search of all possible values between the 10th and 90th

percentiles for each continuous covariate. The binary cut point associated with the lowest p-value resulting from a
chi-square test was used to binarize each continuous covariate.
To identify and select the subset of input covariates that were most relevant to a positive SARS-COV-2 test
a multistep process was employed. First, a stepwise linear model to predict a positive SARS-COV-2 test was fit
separately for each of the 10 imputed datasets. Both forward and backward selection using the Akaike Information
Criterion were used to identify the subset of covariates to be included in the final model for each imputed dataset.
Next, covariates which were included in all 10 reduced models were chosen to be included in the final pooled
model. Covariates which appeared in ≥50% of the reduced models were considered individually for inclusion in the
final pooled model with a Wald test. The selected covariates were used in the final reduced logistic regression
model. We initially fit a mixed-effects model on the combined dataset using study site as a random intercept.26
These results suggested a low degree of heterogeneity attributable to study site (i2 statistic = 0%). Consequently, all
subsequent results were obtained by fixed-effect (pooled) models.

and Joel Marcus UCLA GI Fellowship Research Seed Grant Program had no involvement in the design, collection,
analysis, interpretation and decision to publish the current study.

Results
Of 900 medical records initially selected for manual review, twenty were excluded because they only
contained the SARS-COV-2 antibody test (not the nasopharyngeal PCR test), and ten were from patients less than
18 years old at the time of testing (Figure 1). Five individuals with high degrees of missing data (>40%) and four
with unknown residential zip codes were excluding due to inability to map geocoded social determinants of health.
861 medical records were retained for downstream analyses.
Distribution of included medical records were similar across the three sites, from which there were 428
(49.7%) documented positive tests (Table 1). Approximately half were female, and one-fifth were ≥65 years old.
The majority self-identified as white, and 22% of the total sample identified as Latinx. Most individuals were
calculated to have a low CCI (0-2) and were not obese based on body mass index (BMI). Among previously

coexisting diseases captured, diabetes (13.7%) and immunocompromised (22.0%) were the most prevalent. Nearly
one-fifth tested were healthcare workers, and the majority of people lived in single family homes. During the period
sampled, the probability of a positive SARS-CoV2 test decreased significantly after March, likely reflecting the
adoption of widespread testing (Figure 2).

Chronic acid suppression and SARS-CoV-2 risk
To evaluate the effect of chronic acid suppression on SARS-CoV-2 infection risk, logistic model selection
using 62 candidate features including chronic PPI use and chronic H2RA use was performed. This process identified
neither medication class as significant influences on infection risk (Figure 2). This finding was confirmed with
manual incorporation of chronic acid suppression use (combination of both PPI and H2RA) into the model (adjusted
odds ratio 1.04, 95% CI – 0.92 to 1.17, P = 0.515; Supplemental Figure 1). Interestingly, GERD was associated
with a slightly lower odds of COVID-19 in both models.

Medical conditions associated with SARS-CoV-2 risk
Several medical comorbidities were identified as significant predictors of incident infection. These included
a BMI ≥ 30, and dementia (Figure 2). Unexpectedly, non-hematogenous malignancy and history of alcoholic use
disorder were associated with a negative test. Other comorbidities including heart failure and stroke were not found
to be statistically significant predictors of COVID-19.

Sociodemographic factors and SARS-CoV-2 risk
Males and individuals of Latinx ethnicity were more likely to have positive test. Finally, those who resided
in localities with more than 4.4% of the adult population utilizing public transportation as their main means of
commute also were more likely to test positive. Among our sample, healthcare worker status did not strongly
correlate with testing outcome, and neither did “social deprivation index” and “time spent at home”.

We identified no association between long-term PPI or H2RA use and COVID-19 after controlling for
medical and sociodemographic predictors of infection risk. Our results are consistent with, and complement, two
previously published studies utilizing a clinical informatics approach. A case control study using South Korean
health-insurance claims reported no assication between current and past use of PPIs and COVID-19.27 A cohort
study using the United Kingdom’s Biobank also reported no increased risk of COVID-19 among patients who
reported taking PPI or H2RA.28 Of note, medication data collection period was 2006-2010 for this study, therefore it
was not confirmed that participants were still taking these medications following COVID-19 outbreak. By contrast,
a single large United States (US) survey-based study found a positive association between adults self-reporting
COVID-19 and daily PPI use, but did not find an association with H2RA.29 A notable limitation of this study is the
reliance of self-reported COVID-19 when testing was available. The study reported a COVID-19 prevalence of
6.4% which was higher than the national estimates at the time, raising concerns regarding the accuracy of selfreport. Furthermore, the survey was administered in English, functionally excluding the near quarter of US Census
respondents who report limited to no English proficiency.30

Medical Comorbidities and SARS-CoV-2 Risk
Consistent with previous data, our cohort found an increased risk of COVID-19 and a BMI > 30.31-35
Furthermore, patients with dementia were more likely to test positive, possibly reflecting frequent interactions with
the healthcare sytem or caregivers and a decreased ability to socially distance. Interestingly, those with underlying
solid tumors or alcohol use disorder had a lower risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2. We surmised that this may be
due to reduced exposure to infected individuals by spending significant time at home and adhering more strictly to
precautions, but still having a high need for medical services and therefore receiving more testing. Finally, the
negative association between COVID-19 positivity and GERD may reflect functional hearburn, which is comorbid
with anxiety and possible proclivity to be tested.36

Sociodemographic Factors and SARS-CoV-2 Risk
An important finding of our study is that members of the Latinx community are at a disproportionate risk of
contracting SARS-CoV-2, even after controlling for a variety of medical, socioeconomic and behavioral factors.
Current literature in the US and globally has commented mainly on the increased risk of infection, severe disease

and death in black patients.37-44 Our California-based cohort showed that being of Latinx ethnicity is associated with
higher rates of infection with SARS-CoV-2. In addition to data from New York City reporting 34% of COVID-19
deaths in Latinx people despite only representing 29% of the population, our California-based cohort enriched in
Latinx patients highlights increased risk.44,45 In the 45 states reporting data by ethnic group, 20 report the proportion
of cases among Latinx people is twice as high and 11 report it is three times as high as would be expected based on
the general population.46,47 These collective data underscore the substantial vulnerability of this ethnic group.
Patient zip codes and geolocation data provided indirect insight into the physical environments and
behaviors of the communities in which the patients reside and evaluated effects of social determinants of health on
COVID-19 risk. We found patients living in zip codes with increased public transportation reliance were associated
with SARS-COV-2 positivity. Since the ability to work from home, avoid public transportation, financially
accommodate for furloughs from work are not equally distributed, the ability to social distance effectively may be
one of privilege.44,47,48 Although these differences in social determinants of health are receiving specific attention in
the current pandemic, they speak to important and systematic disparities across healthcare that need to be better
understood and addressed.
In our cohort, females had a significantly lower probability of infection with SARS-CoV-2. It is currently
unknown if there are immunologic or behavioral explanations why female gender may be protective.49 Future work
is needed to clarify this finding.

Strengths and Limitations
Our study has several strengths. The multi-center design incorporates patients from three large urban
academic health systems spanning Northern and Southern California providing care for a diverse patient cohort.
Data included confirmed SARS-COV-2 by PCR test results in addition to medications and comorbidities data
collected and curated by physicians to improve accuracy. Application of geolocation using zipcode enabled
identification of sociodemographic determinants of infection risk. An important limitation of our study is possible
selection bias. Our study cohort consisted only of tested patients. Attempts to correct this include incorporating
multiple predictors of the probability of testing as well as the probability of infection itself; nonetheless we cannot
exclude residual bias. Other potential limitations include possible measurement bias (e.g. discordance between EHR
documentation and actual patient use of medications), ecological fallacy (i.e. attribution of locality-level data to

individuals), and cohort unrepresentativeness (i.e. differences between urban, tertiary-care cohorts and the general
US population). It should be noted that testing was performed both for symptom-triggered testing and preprocedural or hospitalization screening. Thus, the pretest probability was not homogeneous. Associations identified
in this observational study should not be assumed causal and require prospective validation.

Conclusion
This multicenter case-control study demonstrated no association between chronic acid suppression use and
risk of COVID-19. In addition, we found that Latinx ethnicity and residing in a zip code with high public
transportation usage were associated with increased risk of COVID-19 which is in keeping with growing evidence
that this pandemic has disproportionately affected vulnerable communities in our society. Further work is needed to
address reducing the burden of the SARS-COV-2 pandemic on these communities.
