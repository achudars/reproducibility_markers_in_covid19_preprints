Abstract

26

Introduction

27

In the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, testing for SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies is

28

paramount to monitor immune responses in post-authorization vaccination and sero-

29

epidemiology studies. However, large scale and iterative serological testing by venipuncture

30

in older persons can be challenging. Capillary blood sampled using a finger prick and collected

31

on protein saver cards, i.e., dried blood spots (DBS), has already proven to be a promising

32

alternative. However, elderly persons have a reduced cutaneous microvasculature, which may

33

affect DBS-based antibody testing. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the performance of DBS

34

for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in nursing homes residents.

35

Materials and methods

36

We collected venous blood and paired Whatman and EUROIMMUN DBS from nursing home

37

residents, and from staff as a reference population. Venous blood samples were analyzed for

38

the presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies using the Abbot chemiluminescent microparticle

39

immunoassay (CMIA). DBS were analyzed by the EUROIMMUN enzyme-linked immuno

40

sorbent assay (ELISA) for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. We performed a statistical

41

assessment to optimize the ELISA cut-off value for the DBS using the Youden's J index.

42

Results

43

A total of 273 paired DBS-serum samples were analyzed, of which 129 were positive as

44

assessed by the reference test. The sensitivities and specificities of DBS ranged from 95.0%

45

to 97.1% and from 97.1% to 98.8%, respectively, depending on population (residents or staff)

46

or DBS card type.

47

Conclusion

48

DBS sampling is a valid alternative to venipuncture for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies

49

in the elderly.

Introduction

59

In the current severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic,

60

large-scale serological antibody studies are paramount to assess the true SARS-CoV-2

61

infection rate.

62

Indeed, statistics on PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases are far from ideal to estimate the true

63

proportion of the population that experienced a SARS-CoV-2 infection (1), as mildly affected

64

or asymptomatic individuals are often not tested and PCR-based testing only yields an

65

epidemiological snapshot. Furthermore, the recent implementation of newly developed SARS-

66

CoV-2 vaccines creates an urgent need for population-based serological studies to monitor

67

antibody responses post-authorization. Protocols for SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays using

68

serum/plasma obtained by venipuncture are well established in a clinical setting. However,

69

venipuncture is invasive and can cause serious discomfort. Especially in the elderly,

70

venipuncture poses large challenges due to dehydration, loss of vein patency and low blood

71

pressure. Elderly may also suffer from arthritis, injury or stroke, impeding to hyperextend the

72

arms to survey for available veins. The use of venipuncture is further limited for wider

73

application in non-clinical settings due to the costs (for e.g., phlebotomists), logistical

74

constraints associated with collecting, processing, and transporting venous blood.

75

Collecting capillary blood on protein saver cards after finger pricking using a lancet, the so-

76

called dried blood spot (DBS), is a most valuable alternative as it is minimally invasive, can be

77

done at low cost, has the potential for self-sampling and is easy to ship and store. DBS are

78

increasingly applied as a minimally invasive alternative for infectious serology, especially in

79

community- and population-based epidemiology, including SARS-CoV-2 (2). However, the use

80

of DBS has not yet been validated for detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the elderly. Aging

is known to modify the cutaneous microvasculature and the structures of blood vessels, even

82

down to the level of the capillary basement membrane (3). Here, we aimed to validate the use

Methodology

87

Ethical considerations

88

The current study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Ghent University Hospital

89

(reference number BC-07665) and conducted according to the principles outlined in the

90

Declaration of Helsinki. Each participant signed an informed consent form after being informed

91

about the goal of the study and the sampling procedures. A confidential counselor, such as a

92

nurse, signed for participants who were incapable to sign the consent form, such as residents

93

with dementia when consent was given by their legal representative.

94
95

Study population

96

In August 2020, we contacted the management of four NHs within our network (Amphora,

97

Wingene; Sint-Rafaël, Liedekerke; Sint-Jozef, Assenede and Sint-Jozef, Wetteren; all in

98

Flanders, Belgium) and explained the goal of the study. We recruited NHs that experienced a

99

SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in the period March to July 2020 in order to increase the likelihood of

100

obtaining seropositive samples, hence minimizing the number of screened participants needed

101

to obtain our sample size. The management informed the families of residents and recruited a

102

total of 199 residents and 241 staff members interested in participating in our study.

103
104

Sample collection

105

We obtained approximately 5 ml of venous blood from each participant by venipuncture in

106

serum tubes using a 23G scalp vein set. Capillary blood was collected after briefly puncturing

107

the top edge of the distal phalanx of the middle or ring finger using 18G safety lancets

108

(Sarstedt, Numbrecht, Germany) onto Whatman protein saver cards (Whatman™, GE

109

Healthcare Sciences, Cardiff, UK). During sample collections, the protein saver card of

110

EUROIMMUN (EUROIMMUN, PerkinElmer Health Sciences Inc., Lübeck, Germany) was

111

marketed and also evaluated on a subset of participants together with the Whatman protein

112

saver cards. For each protein saver card, a preprinted circle was filled until saturated (i.e.,

113

blood was visible on the backside of the card). In order to avoid sampling bias, for half of the

114

participants (i.e., those with an even participant identification number), first a circle was filled

115

on the Whatman protein saver card, and then on the EUROIMMUN protein saver card, while

116

for the other half of the participants (those with an odd number), the opposite was done.

117

Typically, an average of four blood drops were needed to saturate one circle. All blood

118

collections were done under aseptic conditions. DBS were obtained by allowing the capillary

119

blood to air-dry on the protein saver cards for one hour at room temperature.

120

Serum tubes were transported to the Laboratory of Clinical Microbiology of the Ghent

121

University Hospital (Ghent, Belgium) within six hours after sample collection. Upon arrival,

122

serum tubes were centrifuged at 3000 g for 8 minutes, and tubes were stored at 4 °C. The

123

following day, serum was aliquoted into new serum vials and analyzed by means of Abbott

124

SARS-CoV-2 IgG Architect immunoassay (Abbott Laboratories). DBS selected for analysis

125

(see further) were analyzed maximum two days after collection.

SARS-CoV-2 IgG detection in sera by means of chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay

129

All serum samples were analyzed for anti-nucleocapsid SARS-CoV-2 IgG serology by using

130

the Architect i2000sr Plus system (Abbott). This system allows high-throughput screening of

131

the sera, providing real-time information on the number of positive samples. This way, we could

132

rapidly validate DBS for our ongoing and future studies in NHs. The Architect i2000sr Plus

133

system uses the chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA)-technique to detect

134

antibodies. After thawing the sera and vortexing briefly, the Architect system analyzes the

135

samples automatically using a SARS-CoV-2 assay, a specific calibrator kit and a specific

136

control kit. We used an in-house validated cut-off index of 0.9 to classify sera as positive (≥0.9)

137

or negative (<0.9) for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies.

139

SARS-CoV-2 IgG detection in dried blood spots by means of ELISA

140

The DBS were analyzed for the presence of anti-spike (S1-antigen) SARS-CoV-2 IgG

141

antibodies by means of ELISA (EUROIMMUN, PerkinElmer Health Sciences Inc., Lübeck,

142

Germany), and not the Abbot CMIA, because this assay requires a volume of 150 µl, which is

143

more than the volume of capillary blood absorbed on one circle of the DBS. From each DBS

144

card, one circle of 6 mm diameter was cut out using a puncher and placed into the well of a

145

sterile 96-well U-shaped microtiter plate. To avoid cross-contamination, the puncher was

146

cleaned using a 70% alcohol solution and cotton swab in between punching. A total volume of

147

250 μl preheated (1 hour at 37°C) sample buffer was added to each sample well of the 96-well

148

microtiter plate and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. After gently mixing the eluate by means of up-

149

and-down pipetting, a total of 100 μl of this eluate was used for ELISA, according to the

150

manufacturer’s instructions. The ELISA was run on the automated Behring Elisa Processor III

151

(SIEMENS AG, Munich, Germany). DBS were classified according to their antibody index

152

optical density (OD) value as negative (<1.1) or positive (≥1.1), as recommended by the

153

manufacturer. The borderline category was not considered.

154
155

Sample size and analysis

156

The sample size was calculated using the methodology described by Buderer (1996), focusing

157

on the sensitivity (4). Here, we hypothesized sensitivity of DBS to be lower compared to sera

158

due to antibodies being affected by or remaining captured in the protein saver cards. Using an

159

anticipated sensitivity of 85%, an α level of 0.05 and a precision parameter (ε) of 0.10, we

160

needed a minimum of 49 positive sera, which were collected for both the residents and staff.

161

The sensitivity and specificity of the DBS were calculated using the Abbott CMIA on sera from

162

venous blood as a reference test. The 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using the

163

Wilson-Brown method (5).

Results

170

In four NHs, a total of 440 paired venous blood - Whatman DBS samples were obtained, of

171

which 199 were from residents and 241 from staff (Figure 1). The sera from these 440 venous

172

blood samples were screened by means of the Abbott IgG CMIA reference assay. Of these

173

samples, 129 samples were found positive (60 residents and 69 staff). The paired Whatman

174

DBS from these positive sera, together with 144 paired Whatman DBS samples from negative

175

sera, were analyzed by means of ELISA. The selection of paired DBS from negative sera

176

included 85 paired samples from residents and 59 from staff. The mean age of residents and

177

staff of which the paired sera-Whatman DBS were analyzed was 87.8 years (range 67-100)

178

and 42.8 years (range 19-65), respectively. A total of 80.0% and 93.8% of residents and staff,

179

respectively, were female. Additionally, a subset of 150 EUROIMMUNE DBS samples were

180

analyzed, of which 82 were found positive (32 residents and 50 staff) by the reference test

181

(Figure 1).

The crosstabs with the number of true/false positives and negatives of the Whatman DBS and

198

EUROIMMUN DBS in comparison with the reference test for all participants and categorized

199

per residents and staff, is shown in Table 1. One of the two false-positive Whatman DBS test

200

results with an optical density (OD) value of 4.39, was obtained from a participant who tested

201

positive (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 in March 2020, making it unlikely that this DBS

202

seropositivity was false-positive, in contrast, the reference test likely was falsely negative. The

sensitivity and specificity of both the Whatman DBS and the EUROIMMUN DBS compared to

The scatter plot of the index values of the reference test (Abbot CMIA) and the OD values of

(p<0.0001). The Pearson correlation coefficient for the reference test and the EUROIMMUN

225

between the optical density (OD) values from the 150 paired Whatman and EUROIMMUN DBS

228

a positive result (OD 1.41), but not the EUROIMMUN DBS (OD 1.02). However, the latter is

229

classified as borderline when following the manufacturer’s guidelines. This category was not

Discussion

253

In the present study, we evaluated the use of DBS for detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in

254

residents and staff from nursing homes. To the best of our knowledge, we report the largest

255

clinical DBS validation study, comparing two different DBS samples (Whatman and

256

EUROIMMUN) in a key target population in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the elderly

257

persons residing in NH.

258

Overall, we demonstrated a high sensitivity (range 95.0-97.1%) and specificity (range 97.1-

259

98.8%) for DBS compared to sera. Adjustment of the manufacturer recommended cut-off from

260

1.1 to 1.02 resulted in a slight improvement of sensitivity and specificity for EUROIMMUN DBS

261

only. We found no significant differences in sensitivity or specificity of the DBS between

262

residents and staff, for both Whatman and EUROIMMUN DBS, as demonstrated by the largely

263

overlapping confidence intervals. Furthermore, protein saver cards of Whatman and

EUROIMMUN yielded results that were nearly in perfect agreement.

265

Several other studies in different populations, such as health care workers, key workers,

266

athletes and children have evaluated DBS sampling for SAR-CoV-2 antibody testing (6-14). In

267

these studies, similar test characteristics were reported with a sensitivity ranging from 89 up

268

to 100% and a specificity of 100% (7, 10, 11), or, reported a nearly perfect agreement in SARS-

269

CoV-2 antibody detection between DBS samples and paired venous blood samples (6, 9, 12-

270

14). However, some studies were limited by the lack of serum serology as a reference test (7,

271

8) or the rather limited sample size (i.e., <50 positives as assessed by the reference test) (6,

272

7, 11, 12).

273

Our findings show an excellent diagnostic performance of DBS, both in the elderly and staff

274

from nursing homes. This supports the use of DBS in large-scale SARS-CoV-2

275

serosurveillance studies as a valuable alternative to venipuncture, especially in the elderly,

276

where venous blood can be challenging to obtain. In comparison to serological rapid tests,

277

which can also be implemented in large-scale SARS-CoV-2 sero-epidemiological studies, DBS

278

offer higher sensitivity, specificity and the possibility to (semi-)quantitatively asses the antibody

279

response (15). Moreover, DBS have the advantage to collect and store the sample for multiple

280

analyses. In this way, different assays can be used on the same sample, such as antibody

281

assay directed against different antigens. Yet, DBS have similar advantages as these rapid

282

tests, as they alleviate the need for health care professionals during sampling and complex

283

shipment and storage.

284

Especially since the implementation of newly developed SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, serology

285

studies are of increasing importance to fill existing research gaps. Until now, the stability and

286

duration of the antibody response upon vaccination is unknown, however, is important to

287

determine if annual boosting is needed. Secondly, a correct antibody response cut-off value

288

that refers to clinical immunity against SARS-CoV-2 is lacking. Additionally, it is of crucial

289

importance to assess the effectiveness of the vaccines among the general population, which

290

can differentiate from what is measured in standardized clinical trials. In this context, the non-

291

invasiveness of the DBS, minimal logistic constraints, excellent test characteristics and the

292

possibility for quantitative assessment bring added value in the conduct of serosurveillance

293

studies.

294

Our study was limited by the use of CMIA on venous blood samples that assessed

295

nucleocapsid antibodies, and not spike antibodies, which were detected by means of ELISA

296

in DBS.

297

antibodies directed against the nucleocapsid and spike antigen, however, it is suggested that

298

IgG antibody levels directed against the nucleocapsid antigen wane more rapidly post-infection

299

than those against the spike antigen (16). Nevertheless, this should not impact the sensitivity

300

analysis in the current results, as nucleocapsid antibodies were detected as the reference.

Conflicting results are available concerning the degree of persistence between
