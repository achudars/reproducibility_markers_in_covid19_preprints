Abstract

27

The outbreak of COVID-19 necessitated abrupt transition from on campus, face-to-

28

face sessions to online, distance learning in higher education institutions. The

29

purpose of this study was to investigate the perceptions of postgraduate dental

30

learners and instructors about the transition to distance learning, including the

31

changes to the learning and teaching and its efficaciousness.

32

A mixed-methods approach to research was utilized. All the instructors and

33

postgraduate learners were invited to participate in the online survey. Quantitative

34

data was analyzed using descriptive and inferential analyses on SPSS for Windows

35

version 25.0, and for the responses to the open-ended questions, multi-staged

36

Thematic Analysis was utilized.

37

Both groups of stakeholders: learners and instructors, were quite satisfied with the

38

rapid transition to distance learning due to COVID-19. Instructors were significantly

39

more satisfied than the learners. The stakeholders adapted well to the change. The

40

perception of the stakeholders regarding the case-based scenarios significantly

41

influenced their level of satisfaction. As perceived by the stakeholders, the transition

42

to distance learning entailed advantages and challenges. Going through the

43

experience equipped the stakeholders with lessons learned and enabled them to

44

develop informed opinions of how best to sustain learning and teaching irrespective

45

of how matters unfold in relation to the pandemic.

46

In conclusion, the worldwide dental education community faced unprecedented

47

challenges due to the onset of COVID-19. Yet, in the grand scheme of things, it is

48

important for decision-makers not to miss-out on the worthwhile opportunities,

Introduction

59

It took the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) two months to traverse national

60

borders, across multiple continents. On the 11th of March 2020, the World Health

61

Organization (WHO) announced that the COVID-19 epidemic transformed into a

62

pandemic (1). The outbreak of COVID-19 led to a rapidly evolving situation which

63

impacted the education system worldwide (2). Continuing the delivery of education

64

through alternative learning and teaching channels abruptly became a top priority

65

for institutions aiming to keep the impact of the crisis on education to a minimum.

66

Following the endorsement of national social distancing directives, education

67

institutions, across many countries, had no option but to resort to distance learning

68

environments and other e-learning resources (3). Implementation of distance

69

learning, in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), for all higher education institutions’

70

became a requirement starting from the 22nd of March, 2020 until the end of June,

71

2020, where almost three quarters of the second half of 2019-2020 academic year

72

was conducted online (4).

73

Rapid transition from on campus, face-to-face classes to online, distance learning

74

sessions took place. Many educators had never delivered sessions via online

75

environments, which required them to acquire an extensive set of skills over a short

76

period of time. They also needed to adapt the content and structure of their

77

offerings, and to select the most suitable methods to engage their learners in the

78

virtual environment. The impact of these restrictions were exacerbated, in health

79

professions education, due to the suspension of all elective treatments where the

80

associated experiential education constitutes the core of the learning and teaching

81

(5). There are pedagogical approaches for planning of distance learning courses,

82

which require special techniques of course design, instructional design, and methods

83

of communication (6, 7). Yet, given the urgency of the COVID-19 situation,

84

institutions did not get the space to plan for, and undergo the proper, systematic

85

way of transitioning, which usually involves substantial amount of capacity building

86

(i.e., offering learning and development opportunities for involved stakeholders) and

87

of change management (i.e., striving to minimize the inevitable resistance and its

88

counterproductive consequences to any institutional changes). In addition, the

89

learners who were accustomed to face-to-face interactions, had to rapidly adapt to

90

distance learning and to the online environment. Moreover, the challenges around

91

rapidly transitioning to distance learning were exacerbated by the multiple changes

92

and restrictions accompanying COVID-19, and the resulting psychosocial stressors

93

that the learners and the educators has been facing (8, 9). Educators and learners

94

needed to increase networking, foster the humanity in their connections, and

95

enhance the effectiveness of their communication before, during, and after their

96

online engagements (10). This experience influenced the way they create meaning

97

and reflect upon the learning and teaching (11).

98

The novelty of the situation and how the involved parties have been adapting to this

99

situation constitute worthy opportunities for investigation given that most research

100

studies, to date, have been conducted in “typical” (relatively more stable)

101

educational environments. It is important to examine and reflect on this experience

102

to better prepare for the potentiality of reoccurrence and the experiencing of other

103

similar emergency situations. Moreover, the lessons learned from this sudden

104

transition of adults’ education hold the potential of positively transforming post6

105

pandemic learning and teaching, especially in programs, that rely heavily on clinical

106

training, since they were impacted the most since the onset of this pandemic. This

107

is particularly relevant to post-graduate dental education since the learning and

108

teaching is heavily reliant on clinical specialty training.

109

The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate the perceptions of

110

postgraduate dental learners and instructors in relation to the transition to distance

111

learning, including the changes to the learning and teaching and its efficaciousness,

112

and how these stakeholders modified their learning or teaching to adapt to this

113

abrupt change.

114

Accordingly, in this study, we strive to address the following research question: how

115

was the rapid transition to distance learning due to COVID-19 perceived by

116

postgraduate dental learners and instructors, and how do those perceptions relate to

117

one another?

Context of the study

120

This study was undertaken at Hamdan Bin Mohammed College of Dental Medicine

121

(HBMCDM) at Mohammed Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences

122

(MBRU), Dubai, UAE. HBMCDM is a new postgraduate dental school, launched in

123

Academic Year 2013-2014, that offers three-years full-time specialty dental

124

postgraduate programs in endodontics, orthodontics, pediatric dentistry,

125

periodontics, and prosthodontics.

126

Description of the transition to distance learning

127

In an effort to curtail the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and in response to the

128

directive of the Ministry of Education (Decree 229)(12), HBMCDM along with all

129

other educational institutions in the UAE switched to complete distance learning as

130

of the 22nd of March, 2020 until the end of the academic year (the 9th of July, 2020

131

in the case of HBMCDM- the college under investigation in this study). All didactic

132

educational activities were continued as scheduled. At the time of transition, the

133

first-year learners were preparing their research protocols, and the third-year

134

learners were mainly engaged in the preparation of the graduate dissertation. Both

135

of those groups of learners were able to pursue their research work. As for some of

136

the second-year learners, had to stop the empirical (i.e., data collection) part of their

137

studies given the implemented COVID-19 directives. The learners’ discussions and

138

advising sessions related to the different stages of the scientific research method of

139

the dissertations that continued (ranging from research conceptualization to

140

determining of research methodology, and data collection tools and analyses, all the

141

way to preparing of the manuscript) were all conducted via Microsoft Teams.

142

For the clinical training, it was decided that the learners will have to compensate for

143

the missed clinical activities to ensure the attainment of the required clinical

144

competencies at a later stage. To make-up for the generated gap, a compensation

145

program in the following academic year was introduced. In the meantime, the

146

college focused on virtual case-based discussion sessions and involved learners in

147

Teleconsultations under the supervision of faculty members. In addition, some

148

learners were deployed to off-training sites to assist authorities with COVID-19

149

contact tracing and sampling.

Intervention

151

Platforms

152

The digital platforms utilized for delivery of distance learning consisted mainly of two

153

platforms. HBMCDM had an existing Learning Management System (LMS) that has

154

been in function since 2014. The LMS is used by course instructors to post course

155

information and content in addition to conducting assessments and posting grades.

156

It is also used for interactive discussions within specific courses. The use of LMS was

157

maintained throughout the distance learning. The heavy reliance on Microsoft Teams

158

was novel. It constituted the main platform which provided a medium for real-time

159

class presentations by both learners and instructors, and for research dissertation-

160

related interactions and clinical CBD. In addition, some instructors pre-recorded their

161

lectures with the support of the educational technologists at MBRU to ensure the

162

learners can access the content at their convenience.

163

Instructors’ professional learning and development

164

All instructors were required to undergo learning and development sessions,

165

concerning the transition to distance learning, delivered by MBRU Faculty

166

Development and Information Technology (IT) support teams. These sessions were

167

conducted via Microsoft Teams. The IT support team assigned technical support

168

personnel to each instructor. In addition, the Faculty Development team provided

169

one-to-one consulting to support the instructors in learning design, where

170

instructions were adapted to the respective instructors’ learning and teaching

171

specifications. The instructors were advised to shorten the length of the teaching

172

sessions, not to exceed one hour each. Instructors were also advised to provide

173

reading material prior to the teaching sessions to enable the suggested shortening of

174

the session.

175

The teaching sessions

176

The length of time allocated to different classes remained unchanged. As for the

177

scheduled timing of the lectures, the original schedule for the classes assigned at the

178

beginning of the second semester of Academic Year 2019-2020 was used. Class

179

attendance was registered by the course instructor on MBRU Self-Service portal.

180

Additional two-hour Case-Based Discussions (CBD) were added to the original two-

181

hour CBD to have in total four-hours of CBD across two sessions per week. These

182

sessions were meant to engage the graduate learners in certain clinical skills

183

including diagnosis, decision making, and treatment planning through encouraging

184

critical thinking and providing constructive multi-stream dialogue among and in

185

between the learners and instructors.

186

Changes in assessments

187

Major changes in assessment methods were implemented to accommodate for the

188

absence of live proctoring. Instructors were encouraged to consider feasible

189

alternative tracks that emphasize equity and hold the learners accountable to

190

academic integrity. The instructors collectively needed to identify alternative means

191

of conducting summative assessment to ensure the attainment of intended course

192

learning outcomes and readiness of the learners to progress.

193

The weightage of the summative assessments for all courses as determined at the

194

beginning of the semester was upheld. Emphasis was placed on maximizing

195

formative Multiple-Choice Question (MCQ) type quizzes to ensure that the individual

196

lectures’ learning outcomes were met. Instructors were encouraged to conduct

197

assessments using clinical scenarios to test the learners’ diagnosis, clinical judgment,

198

and problem-solving skills as well as treatment planning competencies especially in

199

complex multidisciplinary cases. As for the oral clinical exams, which are based on

200

unseen case-scenarios, they were conducted using Microsoft Teams.

201

The LMS system, through which the exams were conducted, deployed a lockdown

202

browser requirement which prevented the learners from opening any other

203

application on their devices while taking the exam. In addition, activation of the

204

webcam, in the learners’ devices, was required. The system was enabled to detect

205

any abnormal activity by the exam-taker, and flag it to be checked by the course

206

instructor. All learners and instructors received training on how to take the exam

207

using the lockdown browser and the webcam. In addition, detailed written

208

instructions were sent to the learners prior to each summative exam.

209

Research design

210

A mixed-methods study design was adopted to systematically develop an

211

understanding of the stakeholders’ perceptions regarding the rapid transition to

212

distance learning. This study is characterized by a single phase, where existing

213

qualitative and quantitative data was concurrently collected and analyzed. The

214

triangulation of data, in terms of sources (i.e., learners and instructors) and types

215

(i.e., qualitative and quantitative), is meant to raise the validity of the generated

216

findings.

217

Ethical approval for the study was granted by the MBRU, Institutional Review Board

218

(Reference # MBRU-IRB-2020-032).

219

Data collection

220

The data was collected using a survey that was designed specifically for the purpose

221

of this study. It aimed at assessing the perception of learners and instructors

222

regarding the rapid transition to distance learning due to COVID-19 and its effect on

223

the learning and teaching at the college.

224

The survey was developed by three researchers (FAR, FO, and MAH), who started

225

with looking into how the various universities across the world are planning on

226

evaluating their distance learning performance since the onset of COVID-19. Among

227

the universities which had their surveys readily available were the following:

228

University of Minnesota, University of Pittsburgh, University of Saskatchewan, and

229

Rutgers University (13). These resources were retrieved from an online community

230

of Institutional Research professionals where an asynchronous forum discussion

231

around “Impact of COVID-19 on evaluations in Higher Education Institutions” has

232

been taking place. These surveys were thoroughly reflected upon, and in turn

233

extracted segments from all got contextualized and in turn adapted for this study.

234

The survey was composed of three segments. The first segment is a Likert scale of

235

five points (1: Strongly Disagree, 2: Disagree, 3: Neutral, 4: Agree, and 5: Strongly

236

Agree) across 8 variables, as per Table 1. Out of those 8 variables, 3 were

237

replicated, as is, for both learners and instructors, 3 others were replaced for the

238

instructors with an alternative which is supposed to reflect the other side of the

239

same coin, and 2 were unique to the learners.

Legend: This table shows the similarities and differences between the two surveys that were disseminated to capture the
perceptions of the learners and instructors, respectively. Components 1, 2, and 8 were common between both surveys.

Components 3 and 4 were meant to constitute two sides of the same coin. As for components 5 and 6, they were unique to
the learners.

246

The second section entails the following two dichotomous questions (Yes/ No), each

247

followed by a separate open-ended question requiring the participant to elaborate:

250

The transition to the online environment, in response to the COVID-19,
significantly impacted my learning (or my teaching) in these courses.

•

251

The transition to the online environment, in response to the COVID-19,
significantly impacted the courses’ structure and delivery.

252

As for the last section of the survey, it was meant to be exploratory to solicit for

253

qualitative data using the following open-ended questions:

254

•

What were some of the advantages of transitioning to distance learning?

255

•

What were some of the challenges that you faced due to transitioning to

256

distance learning?

•

What aspects of those alternative modes of instruction would you like to

261

sustain on the long run (even after returning to regular face-to-face

262

sessions)?

263

Participation in this data collection initiative was completely voluntary. The privacy

264

and the data confidentiality of the learners were protected, and no personal

265

identifiers were recorded. The survey was assembled throughout May 2020. In the

266

respective academic year, the HBMCDM faculty was composed of 21 instructors and

267

was serving a total of 63 learners.

268

Data analyses

269

Quantitative descriptive analyses

270

The quantitative data was descriptively analyzed using SPSS for Windows version

271

25.0. For each of the 8 quantitative components, the mean and standard deviation

272

were calculated. An overall score of satisfaction was calculated for both

273

stakeholders together (i.e., across the 6 components that are common to both

274

stakeholders), along with a score of satisfaction for the learners (i.e., across all 8

275

components) and another one for the instructors (i.e., across the 6 components that

276

constituted the instructors’ tool).

277

Since the scale used for capturing the perception of the learners and instructors was

278

tailor-made for the purpose of this study, the validity tests of Cronbach’s Alpha and
14

279

the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were performed to ensure the internal

280

consistency and check external variance, respectively, of the adapted tool.

281

For the inferential analyses, to select the appropriate tests, a test of normality was

282

conducted for each of the 8 components, and for all three scores of satisfaction

283

(overall, and learners and instructors). The data of each of the eight components,

284

independently, and the overall and learners’ scores of satisfaction all turned out to

285

be not normally distributed. As for the instructors’ data, it turned out to be normally

286

distributed.

287

Quantitative inferential analyses

288

Accordingly, Mann-Whitney tests were used to compare the overall score of

289

satisfaction, and each component independently, between both groups of

290

stakeholders (learners and instructors), and the overall score of satisfaction and

291

learners’ score of satisfaction, between those who answered ‘Yes’ (versus those who

292

answered ‘No’) to each of the two dichotomous questions of the second section of

293

the survey. As for the instructors’ satisfaction score, Independent T-test was used

294

to uncover whether, or not, this satisfaction score significantly differs between the

295

two options of each of the dichotomous questions.

296

In addition, Chi-squared was used to assess any potential associations between the

297

two dichotomous variables of the second section of the survey and the two groups

298

of stakeholders.

299

Finally, the Kruskal- Wallis test was conducted to assess the extent to which the

300

overall and learners’ scores of satisfaction can be explained by changes in the

301

stakeholders’ perception of the components of the scores, respectively. In order to

303

was deployed.

304

Qualitative analyses

305

The qualitative data analysis started after the conclusion of the data collection

306

phase. The data was analyzed using Thematic Analysis by three researchers (MAH,

307

FAR, and FO). The subjectivity of the researchers was recognized, right from the

308

start of the analysis, to avoid affecting the integrity of the qualitative analysis

309

trajectory. Prominent patterns were identified after thorough examination of

310

datasets. The process was inductive, based on the constructivist epistemology. It is

311

worth noting that the consistency, in relation to the underlying theoretical

312

assumptions, was assured throughout the study. This iterative, interpretative

313

approach enabled the researchers to gain a detailed understanding of the

314

phenomenon under investigation (i.e., rapid transition to distance learning at

315

HBMCDM at MBRU).

316

The process of analysis followed the six-step framework initially introduced by Braun

317

and Clarke (2006) (14). This multi-staged approach to Thematic Analysis has been

318

encouraged in research concerning health professions education (15). NVivo

319

software version 12 plus (QSR International Pty Ltd, Vic, Australia) was used to code

320

the data, and in turn expedite the categorization of the relevant text fragments.

321

The analysis process started with the researchers acquainting themselves with the

322

data. The data was segmented into meaningful statements. The data collected from

323

each of the two groups of stakeholders was handled separately. Then, as a second

324

step, the text fragments that refer to the same aspect of the distance learning

325

experience were compiled together, labelling each with an all-encapsulating title.

326

Accordingly, the qualitative data was examined line-by-line, while assigning codes to

327

text fragments, until data saturation was attained.

328

The researchers reflected upon areas of harmony and discord mentioned by the

329

participants. The resulting categorization schemes of the two groups of stakeholders

330

were mapped onto each other to compare perceptions. The same themes (more or

331

less) surfaced in the separate analyses.

332

Following that, the discrete concepts, from both datasets, underwent several rounds

333

of reflections, where the various ways by which the concepts could relate to one

334

another were identified. This led to the generation of categories that

335

comprehensively cover all that surfaced in relation to the two research questions,

336

which set the stage for the researchers to work on step three. The researchers

337

examined the categories, again, to find the best way to merge them into higher

338

order themes.

339

The generated themes and categories were then reviewed as part of stage four to

340

ensure that the data within each grouping are sufficiently similar, and data in

341

between the clusters are distinct enough to deserve segregation. All the themes and

342

categories were then labelled and defined to complete stage five. This constituted

343

the basis of the study’s conceptual framework which guided the last step of

344

reporting upon the findings.

Results

346

Quantitative analyses

347

Descriptive

348

Out of those 63 learners, 53 responded (i.e., response rate= 84%). As for the

349

instructors, a total of 18 faculty members responded (i.e., response rate= 86%).

350

Each of the 71 participants were given a unique identification number. The unique

351

identification numbers were complimented with ‘R’ for the 53 learners, and ‘I’ for the

352

18 instructors (i.e., participants 1 through 53 are followed by ‘R’, and 54 through 71

353

by ‘I’).

354

The reliability score of Cronbach’s Alpha for the evaluation instrument, that captured

355

the perception of the stakeholders was 93.3%. The percentage of the total average

356

of the learners, instructors, and both groups of stakeholders were 82.55%, 91.13%,

357

and 84.63%, respectively, as per Table 2.

364

As illustrated in Figure 1, the instructors, with a mean of satisfaction of

365

component: “the case-based scenarios, used throughout the distance learning, was

373

helpful, in my opinion, to develop the learners’ clinical knowledge” (P=0.001).

374

The learners who perceived the transition not to impact the courses’ structure and

375

delivery were significantly more satisfied (P=0.008). However, whether, or not, the

376

stakeholders perceived the transition to impact the learning and teaching was not

377

significantly associated with their level of satisfaction.

378

Qualitative Data

379

The Thematic Analysis resulted in four interrelated themes: ‘Advantages’ and

380

‘Challenges’, ‘Modifications in Learning or Teaching’, and ‘Lessons learned and

381

Suggestions for the Future’, as illustrated in this study’s conceptual framework

382

(Figure 2). Within the Advantages theme, five categories surfaced: Efficiency,

383

Convenience, Work-life Balance, Autonomy, and Cooperation. As for the Challenges

384

theme, it encapsulated four other categories labelled as: Scope of interactions and

385

learners’ engagement, Clinical teaching, IT limitations, and Diffusion of boundaries.

386

The third theme: Modifications in Learning or Teaching, encapsulated four

387

categories: Self-directed learning, Collaborative learning, Flipped Teaching, and

388

Shortening of lectures. As for the Lessons learned and Suggestions for the Future

389

theme, it included text fragments that refer to aspects that will be sustained, those

390

that will be (further) leveraged, and those that require improvements.

391

392

the qualitative analyses)

This theme refers to the strengths of the rapid transition to distance learning, as

395

perceived by the two groups of stakeholders.

396

Efficiency

397

Both groups of stakeholders agreed that the changes accompanying the transition

398

saved time and energy, and made the processes around the learning and teaching

399

more efficient:

400

R9: “…we were getting plenty of learning materials and resources, and given

401

enough time to ask and express our opinions, across differing classes and

402

cases...”

403

F9: “…it saved time and allowed for more focus on explaining the context of

404

the respective topics. I find the changes accompanying the rapid transition to

405

distance learning to be very efficient...”

406

Work-life balance

407

The stakeholders also agreed that these changes led to better work-life balance,

408

which was particularly evident among working mothers.

409

R15: “…in my opinion, it has been advantageous to mothers, mostly… I have

410

kids- I needed to support in their distance learning- they had classes and

411

homework every day. They also needed a lot of support and encouragement

412

to adapt to the new situation. It would not have worked out for us, as a

413

family, if I were not at home, all the time…”

414

F4: “…the comfort of staying at one’s home- no commuting, remaining close

415

to family, and the ease of connecting with any one at almost any time...”

416

Convenience

417

The changes led to arrangements and configurations that were favorably perceived

418

by the faculty members.

419

F2: “…the platform that constituted the core of the distance learning (i.e.,

420

Microsoft Teams) was even more handy and user friendly than the Learning

421

Management System (LMS). The comments and discussions typed in the chat

422

boxes got saved which in of itself had been a great advantage in terms of

423

going back and attending to the topics that needed to be further discussed…”

424

F6: “…the ease of communication whenever needed… the ease of scheduling

425

for and attending and participating in meetings on Microsoft Teams… there

426

had been more flexibility and opportunities for networking, and better

427

accessibility. Despite the external stressors due to COVID-19, the transition to

428

distance learning made the teaching duties less stressful and more

429

comfortable...”

430

Autonomy

431

The learners also felt that the new normal gave them more autonomy where they

432

had more control over their schedules and in turn managed their times better.

433

R2: “…it has been much more efficient than face-to-face learning, especially

434

for people living outside Dubai, in other Emirates… by not commuting, I was

435

able to save a lot of time and energy, which I usually spend commuting back

436

and forth to university, and while stuck in traffic. I also made use of the time

437

in between lectures. I got into the habit of reviewing the lectures immediately

438

after the respective sessions, so basically the transition gave me more

439

autonomy in managing my own schedule and making the best use of my

440

time…”

441

Cooperation

442

The transition to distance learning, and the virtual environment, facilitated work

443

across physical barriers (interpersonal, and across disciplines and even nations),

444

which was especially noticed by faculty members. This led to enhanced teamwork

445

and better collaborations.

446

F2: “…the distance learning created a lot of networking and collaborating

447

opportunities- interdisciplinary and international teamwork and teaching

448

became much easier...”

449

F3: “…we all had no option but to adapt to change. The distance learning

450

option, with all that was needed in terms of IT set-up, has been available for

451

a long period of time, but there was resistance. Now, it is accepted and

452

appreciated, and even preferred in some instances, among the dental

453

education communities and institutions, across the world… this openness to

454

change and to alternatives, and the associated flexibility are enabling plenty

455

of collaboration and co-creating opportunities across barriers…”

456

Theme 2: Challenges

457

This theme refers to the weaknesses and difficulties of the rapid transition to

458

distance learning, as perceived by the two groups of stakeholders, along with

459

struggles that they faced along this virtual journey.

460

Limited scope of interactions and levels of learners’ engagement

461

The transition expectedly led to lessening of the scope of interactions, where people

462

became physically, and in some instances socially, distant. In terms of knowledge

463

exchange, this distancing required the deployment of a new set of skills, which not

464

everyone had at the time of transition.

465

R6: “…the absence of the lecturer’s physical presence sometimes makes

466

receiving and digesting the information more difficult… it is not that easy to

467

concentrate and remain focused without seeing and interacting with the

468

instructor in person...”

469

The physical distancing, integral to the changes, affected people in differing ways.

470

The people personalities played a role. Some learners, for example, became quieter

471

than usual and less engaged in their own learning process.

472

F5: “…getting all the learner to contribute especially the shy or quiet ones had

473

been a challenge, especially that you do not see their facial expressions and

474

nonverbals...”

475

Clinical teaching

476

The hands-on, experiential education, which lies at the core of health professions’

477

education, had to be put on hold due to COVID-19 pandemic. A lot of the practical

478

content that is usually delivered by clinical exposure got replaced by alternatives that

479

seem to have added value but did not offer an equivalent to what the learners had

480

missed out on.

481

F3: “…actually, there is no alternative to hands-on and practical activities. IT

482

might offer solutions that effectively replace part of the experience, but that is

483

it… health professions’ education requires clinical experience and experiential

484

learning...”

485

F10: “…clinical courses, though, cannot be delivered through distance

486

learning- this constitutes the bulk of any postgraduate dental training.

487

Although technology gave exciting solutions to the pandemic situation, one

488

will not become a doctor ‘remotely’…”

489

Information Technology glitches and limitations

490

The stakeholders referred to technical glitches that occurred sporadically. They also

491

referred to certain teaching techniques that they could not deploy online, via the

492

Microsoft Teams platform.

493

F2: “…IT glitches, although rare, caused interruptions in the flow of teaching,

494

and that usually happened when listening to learners and fitting their

495

contributions during sessions in the grand scheme of things...”

496

F4: “…limitations around illustrating ad-hoc ideas to learners. Inability to

497

draw and offer pictorial demonstrations and sketches of certain visual

498

concepts in dentistry...”

499

Diffusion of boundaries

500

Although, as mentioned before, distance learning and working from afar enabled

501

crossing of physical barriers, in many instances, it led to diffusion of boundaries.

25

502

Life during the pandemic felt more like a continuum, with no clear boundaries, for

503

the learners and faculty members.

504

R4: “… finding a quiet place at home was not easy… distraction when family

505

members, especially the kids, pass-by and require my attention assuming I

506

am not engaged or busy with something else… at the end of the day, they

507

are kids- it is difficult for them to realize I am doing work but from home...”

508

R9: “…distractions at home, especially that all other members of the family

509

were also working and/ or studying from home. Having kids around is

510

difficult...”

511

Theme 3: Modifications in Learning or Teaching

512

This theme refers to how the two groups of stakeholders modified their approaches

513

to learning or teaching in order to adapt to the rapid transition to distance learning.

514

The novel learning and teaching environment became conducive to the favorable

515

behavioral and attitudinal changes, where both groups of stakeholders seem to have

516

organically grown and developed, personally and professionally, from this

517

experience. The perceptions of the two groups map onto each other, like two sides

518

of the same coin.

519

Self-directed learning

520

The learners exhibited more proactiveness throughout the distance learning.

521

learners took the initiative to and went out of their way to foster their learning

522

throughout the virtual experience. They attributed the tendency of self-directed

523

learning to having more space and time at hand.

524

R14: “…I attended free dental webinars, from all over the world- that was

525

amazing...”

526

R8: “…the space that this transition led to enabled us to resort to and use

527

more resources than usual to study… access to journals and articles helped

528

me a lot in better informing myself in regards to what we were learning as

529

part of the program. The resources have always been there- but because we

530

were distant, and had more space and energy at hand, we used them to our

531

advantage...”

532

Collaborative learning (vis-à-vis group-based learning)

533

Teaching became more group-based and learners were more collaborative. The

534

instructors assigned more group-based exercises, and the learners were more open

535

to sharing resources and engaging with each other; efforts to come together and co-

536

create were evident on both sides.

537

R17: “…transition to team-based learning had been conducive to our learning,

538

in my opinion. Working in groups had been better because we divided the

539

workload and assigned responsibilities. Each one worked independently,

540

across differing roles, towards a common goal. We became more productive,

541

as a team…”

542

F7: “…learners, from differing cohorts and programs, used to have difficulties

543

in setting mutually-convenient meeting times to work together (due to their

544

different timetables). This experience opened doors for new collaboration

545

opportunities...”

546

Flipped Teaching

547

The faculty members resorted to flipped teaching, more often, where the direct

548

instruction moves from the group to the individual learning space. This group space

549

is transformed into an interactive learning environment where the instructor guides

550

the learners as they apply concepts and engage creatively in the subject matter.

551

F1: “…we adapted flipped learning models, which I think is better than the

552

traditional ‘spoon feeding’ learning, especially for postgraduate teaching

553

which our learners were used to.”

554

Shortening of lectures

555

Along the same line, most of the sessions got shortened.

556

R1: “…the longer the session, the less we are able to remain focused. We

557

became way more attentive during the lectures that were reduced in

558

duration…”

559

F7: “…almost all lectures were shortened, since two-hour distance learning

560

lectures did not work for us...”

561

Theme 4: Lessons learned & Suggestions for the Future

562

This theme encapsulated what the stakeholders acquired from and their

563

recommendations due to this first-hand experience with distance learning. The

564

institutional knowledge generated from this experience better prepared the

565

stakeholders for upcoming rounds of distance learning. Due to this experience and

566

what the two groups of stakeholders gained from it, the upcoming round of distance

567

learning is expected to improve.

568

Aspects that will be sustained

569

Some of the aspects worked well and will be maintained as is.

570

R7: “…distance learning is beneficial for learners who cannot attend lectures,

571

in person, on campus. Instead of missing classes, they can attend them

572

online...”

573

R15: “…teleconsultations via Microsoft Teams (that we started using, with the

574

patients, only after COVID-19) offered amazing learning experiences, and is

575

going to stay with us in the Orthodontics department, irrespective of how the

576

modes of delivery shape-up…”

577

R13: “…the additional case-presentations exposed us to new cases that we do

578

not typically see in clinical training. Getting more frequently exposed to CBD

579

enabled us to examine certain cases more and elaborate upon them...”

580

Aspects that will be (further) leveraged

581

Other aspects worked well and were discovered to be worth capitalizing upon in a

582

systematic manner. These aspects exhibited potential that is worth exploiting to

583

maximize the learning and teaching experiences.

584

R9: “…we recommend for us to have more joint sessions with postgraduate

585

learners in other universities, to be informed about and in turn to attend more

586

webinars offered by other universities, to invite more learners from other

587

universities to attend webinars offered by our university, and to conduct more

588

interdisciplinary discussion sessions within the university...”

Aspects that require improvements

There were also aspects that were identified to require improvements. In other

improvement.

601

Discussion

602

This study showed that both groups of stakeholders: learners and instructors, were

603

quite satisfied with the rapid transition to distance learning due to COVID-19. The

604

transition was characterized by several advantages as perceived by the stakeholders.

605

The continued learning and teaching via the online platforms saved time and energy,

606

especially around commuting back and forth between one’s home and campus, and

607

increased the efficiency of the associated processes, all of which were considered

608

more convenient for the stakeholders relative to the face-to-face configuration. This

609

led to enhancing the work-life balance for the learners and the instructors. The

610

learners favored having more control over their schedules, and both parties were

611

happy with the increased cooperation across the board. This is in concordance with

612

previous literature that highlighted enabling self-paced learning, and allowing for

613

more time and space flexibility as prominent advantages of distance learning (16,

614

17). Whereas another study, demonstrated an undesirable result of increased

615

autonomy among learners who are not self-regulated and/ or not equipped with

616

time management skills (18). Accordingly, supporting learners and instructors in

617

developing those competencies would help them in maximizing their learning and

618

teaching experiences, while striking a better work-life balance.

619

Although both parties scored highly in terms of satisfaction with the distance

620

learning, the group of instructors turned out to be significantly more satisfied than

621

the group of learners. It was previously suggested in the literature among the

622

factors that influence the level of satisfaction of online teaching for instructors are

623

self-gratification, intellectual challenge, interest in using technology, and the

624

associated professional development opportunities (19). The instructors’ overall level

625

of satisfaction was associated with their satisfaction with the additional CBD

626

sessions. The same component variable was also an antecedent to the overall score

627

of satisfaction of learners. The qualitative data analysis uncovered the same

628

findings, where both groups of stakeholders would like to maintain additional online

629

CBD sessions in the future. The overall learners’ score of satisfaction was not only

630

associated with their perception of the case-based learning, but also with all the rest

631

of the components of the adapted tool which proved to be valid and transferrable to

632

other similar contexts. Moreover, learners who perceived the transition to be

633

seamless, without impacting the courses’ structure and delivery, were significantly

634

more satisfied, which is why it is important to work towards instilling a culture of

635

change when planning for systematic transitioning to distance learning. It is also

636

important to ensure providing sufficient technical support along the way. This will

637

decrease the level of resistance which was previously proven to enhance the overall

638

distance learning experience (20-22).

639

The stakeholders also pinpointed challenges that they faced in their distance

640

learning experiences. The perceived added value of CBD did not substitute for

641

hands-on experience. The distance learning was satisfying for non-clinical teachings

642

only. As for the clinical training, it lagged. Resources, which offer equivalents to

643

real-life experiences, clinical trainings, and/ or interactions with patients, were non-

644

existent.

645

Another prominent challenge was the noticeable decrease of in-class contributions;

646

the learners highlighted how their concentration span seemed to become shorter

647

after the transition, and the instructors reflected upon the difficulties that they faced

648

in keeping the learners focused and engaged. Along the same lines, it is established

649

in the literature that maintaining the level of interaction and keeping learners

650

engaged are among the most prominent challenges instructors face in online

651

teaching (22, 23). This challenge was further exacerbated whenever the

652

stakeholders faced technical glitches. Fortunately, those incidences were rare, as

653

reported by several stakeholders, but it is important to keep this potentiality in mind

654

because at the end of the day the IT platform constitutes the medium through which

655

the whole experience occurs. Any hurdles, on that front, would result in interruptions

656

to the online learning and teaching experience.

657

The learners and instructors noticed that (and in turn reported upon how) they

658

organically modified their learning or teaching styles, respectively, to adapt to the

659

circumstances and to maximize the experiences. The external consequences led to

660

behavioral changes, for both parties. In the literature, it is established that choices

661

of pedagogical approaches by instructors are expected to affect learners’ learning

662

approaches (24). Some instructors reported shortening of their lectures. Others

663

mentioned resorting to flipped learning approaches which entailed making use of

664

Questions and Answers, discussions, quizzes (i.e., formative assessments to ensure

665

timely attainment of the intended learning outcomes of the sessions), and providing

666

of feedback throughout the online sessions. The learners, in turn, deployed more

667

self-directed learning, which is desired in fostering life-long learning. Collaborative

668

learning increased, as well; more group activities were assigned by the instructors,

669

and the learners became more likely to resort to supporting each other, sharing of

670

resources, and working together towards common goals. All of which are in

671

alignment with the principles of connectivism (25). This can be further emphasized

672

by consideration of virtual-based situated learning, where content in the online

673

medium needs to be engaging, the environment needs to be contextualized,

674

cultivation of participation and fostering active learning become the priorities, and

675

forming and nurturing community-of-practice is recommended (26).

676

A lot of insights and lessons learned were acquired from the rapid transition to

677

distance learning which can be effectively assimilated and reinforced with pre-

678

existing evidence to better integrate and sustain distance learning. Blended learning

679

has been implemented, with favorable outcomes, in other post-graduate dental

680

schools (27-29). Considering the high acceptance of distance education among this

681

study’s learners and instructors, effective integration of blended education,

682

complemented with flipped classroom in certain subjects, holds the potential of

683

substantial benefits for both groups of stakeholders. The concept of blended

684

education can incorporate asynchronous and synchronous learning elements (30)

685

(31). As a result of the pandemic, teleconsultation was employed, in some of the

686

programs, and was appreciated for offering the learners opportunities to acquire

687

new methods of consultation. In relation to the clinical exposure, the massive

688

appreciation around the CBD, and the debriefing sessions after the presentations of

689

clinical scenarios, can be leveraged to enhance critical thinking, decision making, and

690

clinical reasoning skills (32, 33). In addition, this andragogy, that proved to be of

691

substantial added value to the online learning and teaching in the college under

692

investigation, can be systematically integrated into the curriculum for it to evolve

693

into full-fledged case-based learning.

694

Besides all the challenges that it brought along; the COVID-19 pandemic created

695

plenty of novel opportunities in the worldwide dental community. To make up for

696

the distance and to make good use of the space that this period has created, the

697

dental educators became more engaged via virtual webinars and online conferences.

698

Those opportunities were open and easily accessible by all members of the

699

community-at-large, where knowledge and resources sharing among the

700

stakeholders expanded in scale and scope. A network of dental education

701

institutions was formed, which nurtured international collaborations. Bridging

702

between educational institutions and clinical practitioners was also evident. This

703

interconnected learning community is expected to support post-graduate learners in

704

their future job search and academic collaborations. It also encourages the learners

705

and instructors to come-up with novel, innovative pedagogical techniques through

706

assimilating materials that are readily available online (e.g., case-scenario banks or

707

educational procedural videos), based upon the constructivist theoretical

708

underpinnings (via strategies such as: inculcation and integration). Along the same

709

lines, among the wide array of resources that learners get access to, are videos of

710

procedures which enable clinicians to practice the associated set of skills prior

711

implementing it for a patient, all of which are desired in any curriculum but seldom

712

occurs(34, 35).

713

This study is characterized by a few limitations. In alignment with the principles of

714

the Institutional Research function, complete anonymity of the participants was

715

maintained. Therefore, the gender, age, and the current level in the respective

716

programs of the participants were not recorded. It would have been interesting to

717

know if the satisfaction and the perceived impact of the transition are associated

718

with those demographic variables. Also, the qualitative data offered a lot of insights

719

that could have been further explored with alternative data collection tools (e.g.,

720

focus group sessions). Moreover, although the focused study design enabled the

721

development of thorough insights, the generalizability of the findings is limited to

722

institutions that are contextually and characteristically like MBRU. This limitation is

723

further pronounced given the exceptionality of the times of the COVID-19 pandemic

724

(on all fronts). It goes without saying that both groups of stakeholders faced major

725

changes in their personal and social lives. Their day-to-day life was majorly

726

disrupted, and they were all under a lot of pressure due to the halting of the clinical

727

training which, in principle, entails 60% of the postgraduates’ time. This left the

728

stakeholders with more time to study and to engage in other virtual educational

729

activities which might not remain the case after resuming the clinical learning.

730

Therefore, any decision on the changes of the curriculum towards blended learning

731

needs to be tailored in accordance with the reality of post-pandemic circumstances.

732

Finally, this study evaluated the official platforms of learning. It was evident,

733

though, that unofficial learning tools such as Social Media Applications (SMA) were

734

of added value to the learning and teaching. Properly understanding how such

735

learning tools can be maximized is important when planning for distance learning.

736

It would be great to build upon this study in the following directions. To start with,

737

it is worth exploring the long-term effect of this unprecedented abrupt change in

738

educational method, due to COVID-19 pandemic, on the learners as they progress.

739

Moreover, it would be useful to develop a contextualized competency-based model

740

that would constitute the foundation for instructors’ professional development. It

741

would be interesting for the college to adapt action research to develop, with

742

thorough engagement of the stakeholders, contingency learning, and teaching plans

743

for such times of crisis. Finally, the distance learning started after the spring break,

744

which means the first-year learners had about 6 months of face-to-face learning,

745

which enabled them to build rapport with their instructors and colleagues. It would

746

be interesting to investigate if first-year learners, who sign-up for blended learning

747

from the beginning of the academic year, would perceive matters differently.

748

Conclusion

749

The abrupt transition to distance learning, due to COVID-19, was perceived

750

favorably by the involved stakeholders at the respective college. This unexpected

751

change entailed overcoming plenty of challenges, but also uncovered substantial

752

opportunities that are worth capitalizing upon in health professionals learning and

753

teaching. The lessons learned, and the first-hand knowledge that stakeholders

754

acquired from the reaction to the onset of the pandemic, can be leveraged to

755

innovatively develop and reinforce post-graduate dental curriculums. This reality-

756

check has put stakeholders of higher education in a position to work together and

757

share knowledge. This in turn will enable them to be better prepared for any such

758

transitions and will equip the learners and educators with the skills to maximize the

759

learning experiences and ensure educational continuity.
