Abstract

Background: Regarding SARS-CoV-2 it is well known that a substantial percentage of
adult population cannot get infected if exposed to this novel coronavirus. Several studies
give primary indication about the possible role of preexisting immunity whether cross
immunity or not. Possible role of latent TB, BCG and malaria have been already
suggested to create innate cross heterogeneous immunity. We look for influence of these
factors on Covid-19 mortality in malarious countries.

Material and methods: 80 malarious countries were enrolled in this study.
Hierarchical multiple regression type of analysis was used for data analyses. TB
prevalence/ 100,000 population standardized to BCG coverage rates was taken as
direct factor in the test. Malaria incidence /1000 population was considered as
intermediate factor and the outcome was COVID-19 mortality/ 1 million (M)
population.
Results: Hierarchical multiple regression analysis showed significant associations
between standardized TB prevalence to BCG coverage and reduced COVID-19
mortality. This analysis also showed that malaria have an additional effect in
reducing COVID-19 mortality with high significant association too.
Conclusions: Malaria and standardized TB prevalence are statistical
factors predicting COVID-19 mortality in negative associations.

“trained immunity” to describe this ability of innate immune cells to nonspecifically
adapting, protecting and remembering primary stimulation4.
BCG
BCG through attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis was used to produce
heterogeneous immunity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis which is another
species within the genus Mycobacterium. BCG was blamed to lead to incomplete
and often varying degree of protection against TB disease5. On the other hand,
studies have been done over the past few decades showed that certain adaptations
connected with innate immune cells (monocyte/macrophages, NK (Natural Killer)
cells are responsible for nonspecific effects of vaccination beyond its target 6,7.These
studies showed that Vaccination with BCG induces an improved innate immune
response against microorganisms other than Mycobacterium, this includes bacteria
such as Staphylococcus aureus, fungi such as Candida albicans and viruses such as
the yellow fever virus 6,8,9.
There is well known evidence that BCG plays a role in reduction of neonatal sepsis
and respiratory infection reduction10,11,12. Its role in childhood mortality reduction
is known since 192713,14,15. Furthermore BCG vaccination was associated with
diminished morbidity and mortality rates associated with malaria , unclassified
fever, preventing, sepsis and leprosy 10,11,13,16,17,18. In spite of that many countries
discontinue BCG vaccinations or limited its use to high risk groups because great
achievements in reduction of TB prevalence rates.
TB
Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the major cause of illness and death in many countries
and a significant public health problem worldwide. TB disease is one of the top 10
causes of death and accounted to estimated 10 million people in 201819.
Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is the persistence of an immunological response
to Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigen stimulation without any clinically active
disease20. The WHO recommends tailored latent tuberculosis infection management
based on tuberculosis burden and resource availability21. Treatment of active
disease is by far the major intervention in this regard worldwide, while diagnosis
and treatment of LTBI are hindered by the cost implications of testing, lack of a
consensus on the tests recommended, and side effects of treatment22.
Treatment of LTBI in low prevalence (high to upper-middle-income) countries like
USA23and many European countries24is feasible (in spite of prolonged adaptive
immunological response to Mycobacterium antigen) , as elimination of this reservoir
of infection will reduce the burden of the disease. However, the scenario in high

prevalence countries like many countries in Asia and Africa is quite the opposite,
where reinfection due to contact with active cases rather than reactivation
contributes to a high disease burden24. Latent TB infections was suggested to
create heterogeneous immune response to COX-COV2 viral infection in different
patterns and severity according to different BCG status 25 further studies
consolidate such latent TB role thereafter 26,27,28.
Malaria
Malaria infection can be asymptomatic, or, more accurately, “subclinical,” because
subtle symptoms and chronic health effects may occur but not lead to clinical
diagnosis and treatment29. In similar way for TB control , malaria elimination
requires eradicating both clinically symptomatic as well as these “silent” infections30
which may serve as a reservoir and contribute to ongoing malaria transmission31,32.
Malarial infection cross protection for other microorganisms is well known for
Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The prevalence of malaria/TB coinfection is low33.
Murine models suggested protective humoral and cellular immune responses
against the complications of each disease]34,35. Further studies suggested increased
production of gamma interferon (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and
humoral factors induced by tuberculosis infection that are protective against
malaria infection36,37 ,36.
Malaria was also founded to clear S. pneumonia much more efficiently in coinfected model 37. Furthermore, having malaria infection was associated with a
reduced likelihood of influenza virus and vice versa38,39. It was also suggested that
measles infection repressed parasitemia in addition to influenza A infection40.
Heterogeneous immunological response also exists among different malaria species.
In Italy it has been thought that blacks are less affected by COVID-19 and due to
suggested
previous
exposure
to
malaria
and
presence
of
antiglycosylphosphatidylinositol antibodies ( which have possible protective effect
against malaria re- infection41) might give cross protection against COX-COV2
infection42. Furthermore epidemiological paradox between coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) and malaria endemicity was noticed in the initial phase of this
pandemic43.
Added to these evidence further study showed that high endemicity of TB and
malaria, and universal BCG programs was suggested to have a cushioning effect on
proportion of affected population by COVID-19 30.
Substantial percentage of adult population cannot get infected if exposed to SARSCoV-2 is known that a 44. Several studies suggest a possible role of preexisting

immunity whether cross immunity or not (antibodies/T cells, etc.) as a factor
explaining such diversity46.
Both of BCG implementation and latent TB prevalence later on did not fully explain
variances in COVID-19 mortalities across different countries. In South Africa for
example, where COVID-19 mortality/M population is 238 / M at the study time,
while TB prevalence/1000 population is 520/ 100,00 population which is very high.
Another examples , these studies did not explain low COVID-19 mortality in
countries which have relatively low TB prevalence/ 100,000 population as in :
Togo , Benin and Mali where estimated TB prevalence of 36, 56 and 53 while
COVID-19 mortality/ M is 3,3 , 6 respectively.
Our study background hypothesis stands on possible heterogeneous immunity
generated by malaria in addition to possible heterogeneous immunity generated by
TB. This study will test COVID-19 mortality in malarious countries against TB
prevalence standardized by BCG coverage and test the mortality again when
malaria incidence effect is added to the composite sample and look for statistical
associations and significances. This study addresses mortalities instead of
morbidities as far as real number of affected people are beyond counting in view of
many confounders affect testing and because of widely distributed asymptomatic
persons. Furthermore, this study considers standardized TB prevalence to BCG
coverage instead of non-standardized TB prevalence values.

It was not appropriate or possible to involve patients or the public in this work given that
we used general practice level summated data and related publically published morbidity
and mortality statistics and patients were not involved.
We did not include case fatality rate because no. of tests /Million vary from country to
another country making COVID-19 cases/ 1 M is untrusted indicator. We took mortality
/M as more trusted one.
All countries and territories under 1 million population were excluded to ovoid upgrade
correction to 1 million by multiplication of figures these are : Sao Tome and Principe,
Guyana, Djibouti, Suriname, Cabo Verde (Cape Verde), Burkina Faso, Belize, Bhutan,
Comoros, Mayotte (France), Western Sahara, Vanuatu, Solomon Islands, Sao Tome and
Principe.
Total number of malarious countries and territories enrolled in this study is 80 . All of
these countries have current BCG vaccination programs but differ vaccination coverage.
Countries with Zero malaria incidence are included as far as not yet get the malaria
elimination certificate by WHO (Certification of malaria elimination is the official
recognition by WHO of a country’s malaria-free status. WHO grants this certification
when a country has proven, beyond reasonable doubt, that the chain of local transmission
of all human malaria parasites has been interrupted nationwide for at least the past 3
consecutive years, and that a fully functional surveillance and response system that can
prevent re-establishment of indigenous transmission is in place).45
The Statistical Hypothesis:
No significant effect due to standardized values of "TB/100000 by BCG Vaccination
Coverage 2018 percent" on the COVID -19 Death /1 M. rates as a function factor with the
presence of effectiveness an intermediate factor "Malaria incidence for 2018/1000" at the
significance level greater than 0.05.

Results and Findings
Hierarchical regression of composite -multiple linear model, was used for data
analyses. The direct factor of reducing the mortality rates with reference to COVID19 is the standardized TB/100,000 population by BCG vaccination coverage
percentage in 2018 through dividing the factor of TB prevalence /100,000 population
rates by the factor of BCG vaccination coverage in 2018, while the indirect effect
that reduce the mortality rates, named as intermediate factor which is "The malaria
incidence for 2018/1000 population ".
We investigated the validity of the assumptions of studied model that adopts
the results of quantitative measurements. Table No. (1) shows the results of the
multiple linear model fitness test resulted from the regression analysis of variance.

In table (3) regarding the model of regression factor estimate (i.e. the
standardized TB/100,000 by BCG vaccination coverage 2018), the table shows
meaningful linear regression tested in two tailed alternative statistical hypothesis of
studied factor playing effective role for reducing "COVID-19 death /1 M.
population" as a function of the previous factor. Slope value estimation indicates
that with increasing one unit of the studied factor, a negative influence on unit of the
rates function factor occurred, and estimated as (-22.11). This decrement recorded
significant influence at P<0.05. Other confounders are not included in model, i.e.
"Constant term in regression equation" shows that non assignable factors which are
not included in regression equation, ought to be informative, since estimation about
(127) cases of " COVID-19 Mortality / 1 M." expected initially without effectiveness
of the restriction of studied factor.
Back to the results of the table No. (3), and regarding to composite regression
estimate factors (i.e. the standardized TB/100000 by BCG vaccination coverage 2018
as direct effect, and malaria incidence for 2018/1000 population as indirect effect)
results shows a meaningful composite linear regression tested in two tailed
alternative statistical hypothesis of studied factor is playing effective role for
reducing "COVID-19 deaths /1 M." rates as a function of the previous factors. Slope
value concerning that the first factor's estimate indicates that with increasing one
unit of the studied first factor, a negative influence on unit of the rates function
factor would occur, and estimated as (-18.00). The decrement recorded significant
influence at P<0.05, while with presence of indirect effect by the second factor, slope
value indicates that with increasing one unit of that factor, a negative influence on
unit of the rates function factor would occur, and estimated as (-0.331). The
decrement recorded has highly significant influence at P<0.01. Other confounders
that are not included in composite regression model, i.e. "Constant " ought to be
informative, since estimated that about (152) cases of "Covid - 19 Mortality / 1 M."
expected initially without effectiveness of the restriction of studied factors.

Discussion
We suggest that malaria is possible contributor to COVID-19 mortality in addition to TB.
Up to my knowledge previous studies regarding latent TB and BCG role in COVID-19 did
not take malaria factor when testing prevalence of TB influence on COVID-19 morbidity
or mortality. We think that could lead to bias. In this paper we test TB prevalence against
COVID-19 mortality excluding non malarious countries. We think that this would exclude

to certain extent the influence of non-malaria status on the sample tested. On other hand
we test influence of TB in absent of malaria effect and in the presence of malaria effect as
shown in statistical method. TB prevalence was adjusted to BCG coverage as far as
Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium Bovis were suggested to have protective
effect through inducing trained immune response . TB prevalence represents latent natural
infection to certain extent since it represents 5-15 % of TB infection are presented as TB
disease and 85- 95% as latent TB infection 46. The heterogeneous trained immunity is
accumulative in nature since every year TB infects new targets47. BCG vaccination also
exert accumulative effect since new persons (infants ) are receiving the vaccine each year.
Since the coverage rate represents the percentage of target population being vaccinated
, we adjust TB prevalence figures to BCG vaccination coverage to present a single figure
for statistical analyses representing both . We think testing TB influence by adjusting to
BCG coverage in homogenous group of countries regarding malaria status will help us in
avoiding selection bias if non malarious countries included . Selection bias is important
thing to consider in research studies 48. In COVID-19 mortality studies we think that we
have to consider many confounders including : BCG status , BCG coverage and malaria
when we have to test effect of TB.
In correlation design, variables are measured simultaneously and cause effect
relationship can’t look for so , but in some situations regression analysis can be used to
infer causal relationships between the independent and dependent variables49 as far as
theoretical and conceptual background link exists. In this study role of standardized TB
prevalence and malaria being have been already explained before designing the model
making background evidence for such testing.
Regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships among
variables i.e. 'outcome variable' and one or more 'predictors50,51.
One type of regression analyses is Hierarchical multiple regression analysis that we choose
for statistics for this study. It is defined as a subset of regression methods that we choose
to proof theory of driven evidence for a proposed role of variables entered in blokes 52
(TB prevalence is 1st in this study ) and one additional variable in the 2nd block 52 (malaria
incidence in this study ) on effect ( reduction COVID-19 mortality here ). This test allows
us to look at the R² change and F-statistic change between the two models, in addition to
reporting the level of significance for each predictor variable which are entered into the
model in pre-determined iterations52, 53,54 . Table 2 shows that R –square was 0.091
increased to 0.171 when intermediate factor was added to composite.
The first iteration will be with the most highly correlated variable to the outcome, that is
standardized B prevalence here which is considered as dependent variable . Other variable
that have some sort of association effect on the outcome to see what happens was malaria
endemicity . Entry of this variable led to more significant increase in R-squared, then
evidence of its reduction of COVID-19 mortality association was noted. It is found that
TB prevalence gives a significant p value of 0.026 decreased to 0.002 when malaria
endemicity added in 2nd bloke. Parallel with decreased p value there is increase in

correlation significant as evident by R and R square values . So we profe that
Hierarchical multiple regression analysis gives us significant results
to study the
correlations of these variables with COVID-19 mortality.
The results show that the constant parameters (constants) constitute significant
proportion causing COVID-19 mortality measured ( 152.38) . TB prevalence when
standardized to BCG coverage rate made -22.11 change and when malaria incidence was
included in regression model (constants) made -0.331 further change. Constants
constituted a considerable number not included in regression model (table 3). These
unknown confounders might have attributed to other possible factors such as population
density, genetic factors, environmental factors, social distances and population habits
previous. We took BCG coverage, TB prevalence and malaria incidence just for one year.
While effects of TB prevalence and malaria incidence are accumulative for years rather
than one-year effect. Looking for these variables is strongly advised in future studies .
In this study the prevalence of mycobacterium spp. (standardized to
BCG vaccine
coverae) exposure of the populations is negatively associated with COVID-19 deaths per
million populations, this supports the previous mentioned studies25,26 ,27,28
Standardization TB prevalence standardization for BCG coverage is very important
factor regarding studying countries currently implementing BCG programs as far as
coverage is reflecting the degree of benefits added to the factor (latent TB prevalence) the
coverage do and that’s what we do in this study. Likewise the influence of time duration
of cessation of BCG vaccination program is a factor in determining COVID-19 mortality55
in countries ceased implementing this vaccine . BCG vaccination status for countries being
of concern earlier in this pandemic before latent TB becomes of more concern but previous
early studies were conflicting and were criticized because of possible confounding factors.
This correlation although is statistical , but the theoretical bases for causal relation pave
the way for further studies to proof TB and malaria roles and effects on reduction of
COVID-19 mortality . Further studies are needed in this context . Our findings can
explain the variances in COVID-19 mortality among different countries much deeper than
TB and BCG whether as separated effects or integrated one effect.
Treatment of reservoir in TB and malaria control is slandered practice for elimination for
these serious diseases.
Once concerns raised about their role in innate immune response is raised nowadays, does
changing protocols is needed in next future if causation is proved on clinical grounds? Does
the role of weighting the benefit risk ratio will be operated on leading to more conservative
protocols in treating reservoirs ?
It is not too early to asking such questions but it is early to answer them unless further
confirmatory studies done.
Conclusions: Malaria, TB prevalence and BCG coverage rates are correlated factors in
COVID-19 mortality.
