Abstract
Background:
The Covid-19 pandemic began in China in December 2019. India is the second most affected country,
as of November 2020 with more than 8.5million cases. Covid-19 infection primarily involves the lung
with severity of illness varying from influenza-like illness to acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Other organs have also found to be variably affected. Studies evaluating the histopathological changes
of Covid-19 are critical in providing a better understanding of the disease pathophysiology and
guiding treatment. Minimally invasive biopsy techniques (MITS/B) provide an easy and suitable
alternative to complete autopsies. In this prospective single center study we present the
histopathological examination of 37 patients who died with complications of Covid-19.
Methods:
This was an observational study conducted in the Intensive Care Unit of JPN Trauma Centre AIIMS.
A total of 37 patients who died of Covid-19 were enrolled in the study. Post-mortem percutaneous
biopsies were taken by the help of surface landmarking/ultrasonography guidance from lung, heart,
liver, and kidneys; after obtaining ethical consent. The biopsy samples were then stained with
haematoxylin and eosin stain. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed using CD61 and CD163
in all lung cores. SARS-CoV-2 virus was detected using IHC with primary antibodies in selected
samples. Details regarding demographics, clinical parameters, hospital course, treatment details, and
laboratory investigations were also collected for clinical correlation.
Results:
A total of 37 patients underwent post-mortem minimally invasive tissue sampling. Mean age of the
patients was 48.7years and 59.5% of them were males. Respiratory failure was the most common
complication seen in 97.3%. Lung histopathology showed acute lung injury and diffuse alveolar
damage in 78% patients. Associated bronchopneumonia was seen in 37.5% patients and scattered
microthrombi were visualised in 21% patients. Immunostaining with CD61 and CD163 highlighted
megakaryocytes, and increased macrophages in all samples. Immunopositivity for SARS-CoV-2 was
observed in Type II pneumocytes. Acute tubular injury with epithelial vacuolization was seen in 46%
of the renal biopsies but none of them showed evidence of microvascular thrombosis. 71% of the liver
tissue cores showed evidence of Kupfer cell hyperplasia. 27.5% had evidence of submassive hepatic
necrosis and 14% had features of acute on chronic liver failure. All the heart biopsies showed nonspecific features such as hypertrophy with nucleomegaly with no evidence of myocardial necrosis in
any of the samples.
Conclusions
The most common finding in this cohort is the diffuse alveolar damage with demonstration of SARSCoV-2 protein in the acute phase of DAD. Microvascular thrombi were rarely identified in the lung,
liver and kidney. Substantial hepatocyte necrosis, hepatocyte degeneration, Kupffer cell hypertrophy,
micro, and macrovesicular steatosis unrelated to microvascular thrombi suggests that liver might be a
primary target of Covid-19. This study highlights the importance of MITS/B in better understanding
the pathological changes associated with Covid-19.

Introduction:

The beginning of 2020 witnessed the expansion of the COVID-19 pandemic, which began in
the Wuhan district of China, in December 2019. In India, the first case was documented on 30th
January 2020. As of 8th November 2020, the epidemic in India continues to accelerate with 85,41,173
cases and 1,26,525 deaths reported.Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) is
a positive sense, enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Coronavirus family.(1)
The spectrum of COVID-19 infection ranges from asymptomatic disease, mild influenza-like
illness, to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiorgan failure, and
death. Fever is the most common presenting symptom (87.3%) followed by cough (58%) and
shortness of breath (38.3%). Radiographic findings include bilateral pneumonia and ground-glass
opacities. Roughly 28% of the patients go on to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome and the
case fatality rate is around 7%.(2) Other organs have also been found to be variably affected like
heart, kidneys, and liver with patients developing complications like arrhythmias, acute kidney injury,
and coagulopathy although the pathogenesis is still unclear.
Studies that evaluate histopathological changes associated with SARS CoV-2 are critical
towards a better understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease. Minimally invasive postmortem tissue sampling or biopsies (MITS/B) provide an effective, acceptable, and technically less
challenging alternative to complete autopsies in fatal COVID-19 patients, with less chance of
transmission of infection. Studies done so far show predominant findings of diffuse alveolar damage
in the lung accompanied by capillary congestion and microthrombi.(3)
In this prospective single-center study, we present the histopathological findings of various
organs of 37 patients, who died due to complications of COVID-19 in order to provide insights into
the disease pathogenesis, pathological changes in various organ systems and suggestions for
treatment.

Methodology:

Study design and patients:
This was an observational study, conducted in the ICUs of Jai Prakash Narayan Apex Trauma Center
(JPNATC), AIIMS, New Delhi between May to August 2020.
A total of 37 patients who died of Covid-19 were enrolled in the study. All of them were diagnosed
antemortem by RT-PCR/TrueNAT/Antigen testing .Ethical consent for post-mortem tissue sampling
was obtained from the next of kin as per institutional guidelines. The study was approved by the
Institute Ethics Committee (Ref No: IEC-536/05.06.2020).
Demographic data including age, sex, residence, occupation, contact history were recorded.
Relevant clinical data including presenting complaints, physical examination, hospital course,
laboratory and radiological investigations, treatment given along with the probable cause of death
were recorded in an online proforma.
Biopsy technique:
Post-mortem minimally invasive tissue sampling was done within 2 hours of death (cessation
of circulation and electrocardiogram showing asystole). Sampling was attempted from lungs, heart,
liver, spleen, and kidneys (all organs when feasible, otherwise most organs were targetted).
Percutaneous biopsies were done using B-BARD® biopsy gun with or without ultrasonography
guidance, using surface land markings. The site for biopsy was cleaned with chlorhexidine, followed
by insertion of the charged biopsy gun through the skin into the target organ. The gun was fired
thereafter, thus collecting a 1-3cm sized tissue core/s. 4-6 biopsy specimens were collected from each
organ as per feasibility by using the same skin orifice. Lung specimens were collected from the midaxillary approach, heart specimens from the left para-sternal approach, liver/spleen specimens from
the lower mid-axillary approach, and kidney specimens from the posterior or lumbar approach.
The tissue samples were then transferred to vials containing 10% buffered formalin(10 X volume of
the specimen),which was freshly prepared from 40% formaldehyde after adding 1 part of formalin and
9 parts of water with 4.5g/L monobasic sodium phosphate and 6g/L dibasic sodium phosphate. The
samples were transported to the lab on the same day at room temperature while maintaining standard
precautions.
Histopathological processing and examination:
The biopsy samples were grossed in Biosafety cabinet-2 (BSC-2). The slides obtained from paraffinembedded blocks were stained by routine hematoxylin and eosin stain. Morphology of the organ

tissue (lung, heart, kidney, liver, brain) submitted was studied and recorded by pathologists having
experise in a particular organ system. Special stains (AFB, SM, PAS ) were done to supplement the
basic microscopic findings when needed. Immunohistochemistry for CD163 (MA5-11458, Invitrogen,
1:200) and CD61 (MA1-80862, Invitrogen, 1:50) was performed in all lung cores, while SARS-CoV2 virus was detected by immunohistochemistry using primary antibodies directed against SARS
nucleoprotein (B46F clone, Invitrogen, Catalog # MA1-7404, 1:400), in selected lung samples.

Results:
MITS/B was performed for 37 patients, after obtaining informed consent as detailed earlier. Baseline
clinical data were obtained for all patients. Lung tissue cores were taken for 33 patients, liver tissue
cores for 29, kidney tissue cores for 11 patients, and heart tissue cores for 15 patients.
Clinical characteristics (Table 1):
The mean age of the deceased patients was 48.7 years. 59.5% of them were males. About
95% of them had one or more co-morbidities, most common being hypertension followed by diabetes
and chronic kidney disease. 35.1% of the patients presented with severe acute respiratory illness
(SARI)and 65.6% of them needed oxygen therapy at presentation. The median duration of hospital
stay was 7 days with all patients requiring invasive ventilation during the hospital course. Anemia was
seen in 85.3% of patients and lymphopenia in 72% of them. 48.1% of the patients had typical findings
of COVID-19 on chest radiograph characterized by peripheral-predominant lowerlobe opacities.
Intravenous (IV) broad-spectrum antibiotics were given in all 37 patients, started empirically
on day 1 of admission (as per institutional protocol). IV high dose steroids were used in 25 patients
(67.5%), while anticoagulation was given to 16 patients (43.2%). Remdesivir was given to 3 patients
and 3 patients received tocilizumab.
All patients had one or more complications, with respiratory failure being most common, seen
in 36 cases (97.3%). Secondary infections and sepsis syndrome, based on clinical and laboratory
parameters, were seen in 21 patients (56.7%). Other complications included arrhythmias were seen in
4 patients, coagulopathy and clinically significant bleeding in 4 cases, cytokine release syndrome in 8
cases, acute ischemic stroke in 1 patient, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in 1 patient.
Pulmonary histopathology (Figure 1):
Lung parenchyma was sampled in 32 patients (Figure2).
Acute lung injury and diffuse alveolar damage were seen in most of the patients (25/32, 78%) with
morphological evidence of only acute lung injury in 4 patients, exudative phase of diffuse alveolar
damage (DAD) with hyaline membranes in 10 patients, and organizing phase of DAD with interstitial
fibroblastic proliferation and/or intra-alveolar fibroblastic plugs in 11 patients. One biopsy

categorized as organizing DAD also showed normal lung parenchyma in some focal areas. Associated
bronchopneumonia was seen in 12 of these patients, the majority associated with the organizing phase
of DAD (7/12), with occasional cases co-existing with acute exudative DAD (3/12) and acute lung
injury (2/12). Bacterial colonies, indicating superimposed bacterial infection, were observed in one of
the cases associated with organizing DAD. Other associated findings observed in these patients
include incidental carcinoma (n=2), alveolar hemorrhage (n=2), and pulmonary edema (n=1).
In the remaining 7 patients without evidence of acute lung injury or DAD, 3 biopsies showed normal
lung parenchyma, 2 showed interstitial chronic inflammatory infiltration, 1 showed tiny lung
parenchyma with fibrin deposition, and 1 showed features of acute bronchopneumonia with bacterial
colonies.
Scattered microthrombi were seen in 21% (7/32) of the patients, all observed in lung biopsies showing
organizing DAD (n=6) or acute DAD (n=1).
Scattered megakaryocytes and hyperplastic pneumocytes were observed in 7 cases and 5 cases
respectively. (Table 2).
Immunostaining for CD163 showed increased macrophages in all samples while CD61
immunostaining highlighted megakaryocytes and microthrombi.
Immunohistochemistry for SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein was performed in six biopsies and
immunopositivity in Type II pneumocyte was observed in one case of acute DAD and none of the
organizing DADs. No immunopositivity was observed in endothelial cells, bronchial epithelial cells,
or in the hyaline membranes.

Renal histopathology (Figure 3):
The most common finding was diffuse acute tubular injury with epithelial vacuolization seen in 46%
of the patients (Figure 4). None of the cases demonstrated microvascular thrombosis.

Other

histological findings noted were of the underlying kidney disease including advanced diabetic
glomerulosclerosis (n=1) and early diabetic/hypertensive changes (n=1). Two patients had history of
renal transplantation, of which one had a concomitant chronic active T cell and antibody-mediated
rejection and the other had focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.
.
Liver histopathology (Table 3):
Liver biopsy cores were obtained from 29 of these 37 patients. In 8 patients (27.58%) acute
submassive hepatic necrosis was identified, while in 4 (13.79%) biopsies features of acute on chronic

liver failure (ACLF) were identified with the presence of hepatic necrosis (Figure 5). Four of the
biopsies showing acute hepatic necrosis also showed prominent microvesicular steatosis. In one of the
liver biopsies showing features of ACLF, the histological features were like an acute exacerbation of
autoimmune inflammation. However, the most common histological finding was Kupffer cell
hypertrophy seen in 21 (72.41%) biopsies. In 3 biopsies (10.3%) there were features of non-cirrhotic
portal fibrosis (NCPF), in the form of portal vein thrombosis in 2 biopsies with or without focal
sinusoidal microthrombi. Portal inflammation, interface hepatitis, or lobular necroinflammatory
activity were not prominent in any of our cases. While significant portal mononuclear cell infiltrates
were identified in 13 (44.82%) biopsies, in only 3 biopsies the portal inflammation was dense, while
in only 4 of these biopsies the portal inflammation was moderate. Lobular inflammation was
identified only in 5 (17.24%) cases (Figure 6). In 4 biopsies (13.79%) there was centrizonal
hemorrhagic necrosis, histologically suggestive of heart failure. Macrovesicular steatosis in zone 3
and zone 2 were identified in 4 (13.79%) and diffuse macrovesicular steatosis was noted in one biopsy
(Figure 6). Out of the liver biopsies showing macrovesicular steatosis, two of these patients had a
history of chronic hypothyroidism, while all of them also got steroids as part of their management
regimen during the current hospital course of the COVID-19 related episode.In two of the biopsies
from patients with hypothyroidism, we also identified prominent nuclear glycogenization (Figure 6).
Liver biopsy cores from 4 of these deceased were within normal histological limits. The biopsies
showing hepatic necrosis had a varied pattern. while zone 3 predominant necrosis was seen in 8
biopsies (Figure 6H), diffuse transacinar necrosis was noted in 2 and focal irregular necrosis pattern
was identified in 3 of these biopsies. Other features of hepatocyte damage viz. ballooning, acidophil
bodies,and Kupffer cell hyperplasia were also prominent in most of the liver biopsies, except the
histologically normal biopsies (Figure 6). Intracanalicular and hepatocyte cytoplasmic cholestasis
were identified in 7 biopsies (24.13%) and ductular cholestasis was identified in one biopsy with other
features of associated sepsis-related changes.

Myocardial histopathology:
All the heart biopsies showed non specific histopathological features like mild hypertrophy with
nucleomegaly of the cardiac myocytes. None of the biopsy samples showed evidence of myocyte
damage or necrosis, which is the hall mark of myocarditis. However only one biopsy showed presence
of few lymphocytic infiltrtation in the interstitium without myocyte damage indicative of borderline
myocarditis.

Discussion

Minimally invasive autopsies (MIA) or MITS/B are a simplified method of conducting postmortem sampling, originally devised to investigate the causes of death in low-resource settings. Due
to the potential risks associated with conducting traditional post-mortem examinations in COVID-19
patients, this method has been adopted to study morbid pathological changes in COVID-19
patients.(4,5) This method besides being effective(6,7) also has the added advantage of being more
acceptable(8) and less time-consuming than elaborate autopsies. In this series of post-mortem samples
from 37 patients from a single tertiary care center in India, we studied the morbid pathological
changes in COVID-19 patients.
The typical findings described in pulmonary histopathology of COVID-19 patients include
epithelial,(3) vascular,(9) fibrotic(10) and other changes. The epithelial changes described include
diffuse alveolar damage with or without hyaline membranes, metaplasia of alveolar epithelium,
desquamation/ reactive hyperplasia of pneumocytes, viral cytopathic changes, and multinucleated
giant

cells.(3)Common

vascular

changes

microvasculatures, alveolar hemorrhage,

include

capillary

congestion,

thrombosis

in

capillary changes(proliferation, thickening, fibrin

deposition, endothelial detachment), peri or intra-vascular inflammatory infiltrates.(6)The fibrotic
changes include interstitial fibrosis or microcystic honeycombing.(3)Other findings that can be
encountered include interstitial or intra-alveolar inflammatory infiltrates or edema.(3) In our series,
the most common histopathological pattern seen on lung samples was DAD (diffuse alveolar
damage), with nearly equal numbers of patients showing DAD in the acute exudative phase and
organizing phase. In pathological examination of acute respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS) patients,
DAD(exudative) is known to be the predominant feature till the 6th day followed by a transition to
organising phase till the end of the second week before progressing to fibrotic stages. (11) The median
duration of hospital course before death was 7 days in our series, which explains the predominance of
DAD features. Associated bronchopneumonia, particularly in association with organizing DAD, was
observed in 13 patients, of which obvious bacterial etiology in the form of bacterial colonies was
observed in only two cases. A similar high frequency of bacterial culture-negative bronchopneumonia
has been observed previously(12) suggesting that this may be a pathological manifestation of the virus
itself. The incidence of vascular changes were only 21% ,which was less than that reported.(12,13)
Several factors could have contributed to this observation including regular use of anticoagulants in
the cohort as a part of national policies(14), lower thrombotic complications in the population studied
(due to genetic(15) or climatic factors(16)) as well as sampling errors. We were able to demonstrate

SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein in one case among 6 cases tested in Type 2 pneumocytes using
immunohistochemistry. A recent study has demonstrated specific detection of SARS-CoV-2 in areas
of acute DAD and the hyaline membranes while areas of organizing DAD did not show detectable
viral antigen indicating viral clearance in the later stages of ARDS (17). In support of this
observation, we observed immunostaining for viral antigen in areas of acute DAD.
Histopathological examination of liver in COVID-19 patients had typically revealed mild
steatosis, focal hepatic necrosis, Kupffer cell hyperplasia, and sinusoidal dilatation as reported in
literature.(4,18,19) Less commonly reported findings include inflammation of portal/sinusoidal
tracts,(4,18,20) portal/sinusoidal thrombosis,(21) acute hepatitis(20) and acute endothelitis.(19,20) In
our series, the most common features identified include Kupffer cell hypertrophy in 21 (72.41%)
patients,acute submassive hepatic necrosis (27.5%) followed by acute on chronic liver failure (13.7%)
in a background of chronic liver diseases, features of NCPF (10.3%) and cholestasis (24%). Whether
the changes of centrizonal hemorrhagic necrosis (13.7%) and macrovesicular steatosis (17.2%)were
related to terminal congestive cardiac failure or patients' metabolic syndrome, or

were also

contributed by virus-induced pathology could not be fully ascertained at this stage. Two of the cases
of NCPF described above showed portal vein and sinusoidal thrombi (Figures 6D, K & L). However,
the paucity of thrombosis in the rest of the cases of hepato-biliary system corroborated well with
findings of studies done previously, as exemplified in a recent systematic review.(13)Though in our
cohort of liver biopsies, hepatic lobular inflammatory cell infiltrate was not prominent, changes of
hepatocyte degeneration as ballooning, acidophil bodies, MDBs(Mallory-Denk bodies), and
microvesicular steatosis were prominent. Lack of inflammatory cell infiltrates in the liver has been
described in earlier reports on fatal Covid-19 infections.(18) Our findings disagree with the
observation of Sonzogni A et al.(21) that liver is not a primary target of Covid-19 infection and only
vascular changes in liver are observed. In this cohort, we identified substantial histological changes of
hepatocyte necrosis, degeneration, Kupffer cell hypertrophy, micro, and macrovesicular steatosis,
more than the vascular changes.(21) The relative paucity of inflammation in the liver may be related
to the treatment regimen or the inherited limitations of sampling by biopsies. Our histological findings
match with those described by Lagana SM et al. except the fibrin ring granulomas the authors
identified in 3 of their cases out of 40 liver biopsies examined(22). Out of the 8 liver biopsies which
showed acute hepatic necrosis in our series, macrovescular steatosis was identified in 3 (37.5%) and
microvescular steatosis was noted in another 3 biopsies (37.5%) [Supplementary Table 1]. A report
from China on 300 fatal Covid-19 cases, it was found that steatosis and high neutrophil to lymphocyte
ratio were the indicators of clinical aggressivenes.(23) This needs further elucidation. Except for
paucity of the bile duct in one of our cases, the bile duct pathologies were not prominent in our cases,
supporting the observation of Tian S. et al(4).

Renal histopathology in COVID-19 is reported to show changes including prominently acute
tubular injury (more prominent in the proximal tubules)(18,24–28), arteriosclerosis (18) or
glomerulosclerosis (29) (both as features of underlying comorbid conditions like hypertension), focal
segmental glomerulosclerosis with a collapsing phenotype (25–27) and tubulointerstitial
inflammation(24,26). Renal vascular changes reported are relatively less common and include fibrin
thrombi (27,30), thrombotic angiopathy(29), and lymphocytic endothelitis (19). In our cohort of
patients, the most common finding on renal histopathology was acute tubular injury and pre-existing
renal conditions were only evident in 18%. None of the cases showed significant vascular changes.
Cardiac pathological examination in COVID-19 patients most commonly is reported to reflect
underlying

conditions

like

Other

patient had features of focal myocarditis.

This study highlighted the importance of MITS during a raging pandemic and demonstrated
significant histopathological changes in fatal cases of Covid-19. The relative paucity of inflammatory
cell infiltrates or fibrin thrombi in organs like liver, kidney, and myocardium may have been related to
sampling limitations or therapy-related changes(anticoagulants). It was difficult to ascertain whether
the pathological changes were entirely related to the viral pathology or reflected the comorbidities in
the deceased patients. However, this study adds to the growing evidence that though pulmonary
pathologies are most prominent in COVID-19 infections, extra-pulmonary organs like the liver and
kidney are also affected, often remarkably.
