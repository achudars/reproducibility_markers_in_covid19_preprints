Abstract
Background: The prevalence of true asymptomatic COVID-19 cases is critical to policy makers
considering the effectiveness of mitigation measures against the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We aimed
to synthesize all available research on the asymptomatic rates and transmission rates where possible.
Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane COVID-19 trials, and Europe PMC (which
covers pre-print platforms such as MedRxiv). We included primary studies reporting on
asymptomatic prevalence where: (a) the sample frame includes at-risk population, and (b) there was
sufficiently long follow up to identify pre-symptomatic cases. Meta-analysis used fixed effect and
random effects models. We assessed risk of bias by combination of questions adapted from risk of
bias tools for prevalence and diagnostic accuracy studies.
Results: We screened 2,454 articles and included 13 low risk-of-bias studies from seven countries
that tested 21,708 at-risk people, of which 663 were positive and 111 were asymptomatic. Diagnosis
in all studies was confirmed using a RT-PCR test. The proportion of asymptomatic cases ranged from
4% to 41%. Meta-analysis (fixed effect) found that the proportion of asymptomatic cases was 17%
(95% CI: 14% - 20%) overall; higher in aged care 20% (14% - 27%), and lower in non-aged care
16% (13% - 20%). Five studies provided direct evidence of forward transmission of the infection by
asymptomatic cases. Overall, there was a 42% lower relative risk of asymptomatic transmission
compared to symptomatic transmission (combined Relative Risk: 0.58; 95% CI 0.335-0.994,
p=0.047).
Discussion: Our estimates of the prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases and asymptomatic
transmission rates are lower than many highly publicized studies, but still sufficient to warrant policy
attention. Further robust epidemiological evidence is urgently needed, including in sub-populations
such as children, to better understand the importance of asymptomatic cases for driving spread of the
pandemic.

Introduction
Asymptomatic cases of any infection are of considerable concern for public health policies to manage
epidemics. Such asymptomatic cases complicate the tracking of the epidemic, and prevent reliable
estimates of transmission, tracing, and tracking strategies for containing an epidemic by isolating and
quarantining. This has been a significant concern for the current COVID-19 pandemic.(1)
The possibility of asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19 cases was first raised by a case report in
China where a traveler from Wuhan was presumed to have transmitted the infection to 5 other family
members in other locations while she remained asymptomatic for the entire 21-day follow-up
period.(2) Subsequently a number of other reports confirmed not only the possibility but began
quantifying the potential proportions. For example, the outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise
ship(3) demonstrated a substantial proportion of asymptomatic cases after widespread testing of those
on board the ship. An early rapid review by the Centre for Evidence Based medicine in Oxford(4)
found that the estimated proportion of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases ranged from 5% to 80%.
However, many of the identified studies were either poorly executed or poorly documented, making
the validity of these estimates questionable.
We therefore sought to identify all studies that had attempted to estimate the proportion of
asymptomatic COVID-19 cases, select those with low risk of bias, and synthesize these to provide an
overall estimate and potential range. We also aimed to estimate the rate of forward transmission from
asymptomatic cases if sufficient data were found.

Methods
We conducted a systematic review and a meta-analysis using enhanced processes with initial report
completed within two weeks, using daily short team meetings to review the progress, plan next
actions, and solve discrepancies and other obstacles.(5) We also used locally developed open access
automation tools and programs such as the Polyglot Search Translator, SearchRefiner, and the SRA
Helper to design, refine and convert our search strategy for all the databases we searched and to
speed up the screening process.(6) We searched PROSPERO database to rule out existence of a
similar review; searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane COVID-19 trials for published studies, and
Europe PMC for pre-prints from January 2019 to 20 Jul 2020. A search string composed of MeSH
terms and words was developed in PubMed, and was translated to be run in other databases using the
Polyglot Search Translator. The search strategies for all databases are presented in Supplement 1. We
also conducted forward and backward citation searches of the included studies in the Scopus citation
database.
We restricted publication types to reports of primary data collection released in full (including preprints) with sufficient details to enable a risk of bias assessment and contacted authors for
clarifications on follow-up times and sampling frames. We anticipated cross-sectional prevalence
surveys with follow up, and cohort studies would be the bulk of eligible reports. No restrictions on
language were imposed. We excluded studies for following reasons: sampling frame in part
determined by presence or absence of symptoms; no or unclear follow up; no data on asymptomatic
cases; single case study/small cluster; modelling or simulation studies (but sources of real data were

checked for possible inclusion); non-SARS-CoV-2 virus study; antiviral treatment studies; study
protocols, guidelines, editorials or historical accounts without data to calculate primary outcomes.
Participants
We included studies of people of any age where: all those at-risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 virus
were tested regardless of presence or absence of symptoms; diagnosis was confirmed by a positive
result on a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR); and all cases had a
follow up period of at least 7 days to distinguish asymptomatic cases from pre-symptomatic cases
(Figure 1).

Figure 1. Depiction of ideal study flow and criteria used for study inclusion: (i) sample frame of at-risk
people, and (ii) adequate follow-up on symptoms.

Outcomes
Our primary outcome was proportion of all people with SARS-Cov-2 infection who were completely
asymptomatic at the time of test and throughout the follow up period, where the denominator
included all tested individuals in the study sample whose result was positive, and the numerator
included those who tested positive and had no symptoms. Our secondary outcome was estimate of
onward transmission of the infection from asymptomatic cases.
Study selection and screening
Two authors (OB and MC) independently screened titles, abstracts, and full texts according to
eligibility criteria. All discrepancies were resolved via group discussion with the other authors.
Reasons for exclusion were documented for all full text articles deemed ineligible (Supplement 2) see PRISMA diagram (Figure 2).
Data extraction
Three authors (OB, MC, KB) used a Microsoft Excel form to extract the following information:
1. Methods: study authors, year of publication, country, publication type, duration of study, duration
of follow-up
2. Participants: sample size, age (mean or median; range), setting (community, province, aged care
facility, hospital, screening clinic), presence or absence of symptoms, test results.

3. History of illness and diagnosis: Type of test, numerator, denominator/sampling frame,
proportion of asymptomatic, mild symptomatic, or symptomatic subjects, and number or
proportion of people infected by the asymptomatic case.
Case definition: Asymptomatic: confirmed via any testing specified above with report of no
symptoms for the duration of sufficient follow-up to differentiate from pre-symptomatic cases.
Exposure: contact with a confirmed case or potential contact of another pre-symptomatic person (e.g.
came from an endemic area or linked with an infected traveler). The World Health Organization
(WHO) recommends that “for confirmed asymptomatic cases, the period of contact is measured as
the 2 days before through the 14 days after the date on which the sample was taken which led to
confirmation”.(7)
Risk of bias assessment
Three authors (OB, MC, KB) assessed the risk of bias of potentially includable studies. We used a
combination of risk of bias tools for prevalence studies(8) and diagnostic accuracy(9) and adapted the
key signaling questions on sampling frame, ascertainment of infectious disease status, acceptability
of methods to identify denominators, case definition of asymptomatic for the numerator, and length
of follow up, as shown in Table 2 and in Supplement 3 in full.
Data analysis
We estimated the proportion of COVID-19 cases who were asymptomatic for each included study
population, assuming a binomial distribution and calculating exact Clopper–Pearson confidence
intervals. We then pooled data from all included studies using (1): fixed effects meta-analysis and
(2): random effects meta-analysis. All analyses were conducted using SAS 9.4; the FREQ procedure
was used for individual studies and the fixed effect meta-analysis; the NLMIXED procedure was
used for the random effects meta-analysis.
We also meta-analyzed the forward transmission rates from asymptomatic and symptomatic cases
where there was sufficient data and report the pooled relative risk comparing the two. We planned to
undertake subgroup analysis for age (between studies, and within studies where age was reported
separately for asymptomatic and symptomatic cases). As only studies deemed to be of high quality
on items 1 and 2 after risk of bias appraisal were included in the analysis, no sensitivity analysis of
high versus low quality studies was undertaken. Instead, we did a sensitivity analysis where we
omitted studies with follow-up duration of less than 14 days.

Results
Two thousand four hundred and fifty-four articles were screened for title and abstract and 161 fulltext articles assessed for inclusion (Figure 2). Major reasons for exclusion were inadequate sampling
frame and insufficient follow-up time to accurately classify the asymptomatic cases. Full list of
excluded studies with reasons is presented in Supplement 2. Thirteen articles − nine published and
four preprints − from seven countries (China (4), United States of America (USA) (4), Taiwan (1),
Brunei (1), Korea (1), France (1) and Italy (1)) that tested 21,708 close contacts of at least 849
confirmed COVID-19 cases, of which 663 were positive and 111 were asymptomatic, met eligibility
criteria for the estimation of the primary outcome. (10-22)

Figure 2. Screening and selection of articles

Their sampling frames included residents of skilled nursing facilities (SNF) (10, 12, 15, 19, 20);
high-risk close contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases (11, 13, 14, 17, 18, 21); and a whole district
surveillance program in Italy (16). The demographic characteristics (Table 1) indicate that most of
the tested individuals were adults, with mean age over 75 years in the five SNF studies and mean
over 31 years in the non-aged care studies. The proportions of children and young people (0-20
years) ranged from 6% to 23.5%.
Diagnosis in all studies was confirmed via RT-PCR and in two cases supplemented with radiological
evidence(17, 21). Testing of individuals within the study sample varied across settings but was
generally very high: all contacts regardless of symptoms(11, 13, 14, 17, 18, 21); >97% of SNF
residents(10, 12, 15, 19, 20) and 85.9% of an entire town(16). Length of follow-up for monitored
individuals in the SNF studies was 7-30 days(10, 12, 15, 19, 20); 14 days for the Bruneian(13),
Taiwanese(14), Korean(18) and Chinese close contacts(17, 22); 7-14 days in the Italian
community(16); 12 days for 95% of all contacts in the Shenzhen community surveillance(11), and
16±6 days in Liaocheng, China(21).

The proportion of asymptomatic cases in the 13 included studies ranged from 4% (95% CI 1% 10%) in Korea(18) to 40% in Vo, Italy (16) and in an aged care facility in USA(20). Combining data
from all 13 studies, we estimate that 17% of cases were asymptomatic (95% CI: 14% - 20%; fixed
effects); for the eight non-aged care studies: 16% (13% - 19%), and for the five studies of SNFs 20%
(14% - 27%) (Figure 3). The corresponding estimated proportions in the random effects metaanalysis were: overall 18% (95% CI: 9% - 26%), non-aged care 16% (7% - 26%), and aged care 21%
(5% - 36%). The 95% prediction interval was 4%-52%. In the sensitivity analysis omitting studies
where length of follow up was less than 14 days (10, 11, 16, 20), the overall estimate was modestly
lower at 15% (fixed effect, 95% CI: 12%-18%) or 17% (random effects, 95% CI: 8-26%).
Heterogeneity as expressed by I2 was 84%.

Five studies reported data on secondary infection transmission from asymptomatic cases (Table 2).
The asymptomatic transmission rates ranged from none to 2.2%, whereas symptomatic cases’
transmission rates ranged between 0.8-15.4%. Cycle threshold (Ct) from real-time RT-PCR assays or
the viral load did not differ between asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals in three of the
studies.(10, 14, 16) Overall there was a 42% lower relative risk of asymptomatic transmission
compared to symptomatic transmission (pooled Relative Risk: 0.58; (fixed-effects 95% CI 0.3350.994, p=0.047); 0.38 (random-effects 95% CI 0.13-1.083, p=0.07). I2=43.4%).

Risk of bias of included studies
Table 3 summarizes the overall risk of bias assessment of the nine included studies (full list of risk of
bias questions in Supplement 3). All of the studies were evaluated as low risk of bias for the sampling
frame and length of follow up domains, which were part of the inclusion criteria (Domain 1 and 5).
Two studies had potential non-response bias for not testing all of the eligible participants (14%
(463/3275) of the target population was not tested in Lavezzo et al study(16)) or not reporting all
tested participants results (87/98 cases were reported in Bi et al study(11)) (Domain 2). Four studies
either had not tested the study population at least twice during the follow up period or had not
provided clear information on it (Domain 3). Nine studies did not explicitly state the asymptomatic
case definition they adhered to or had additional bias due to high percentage of people in the SNFs
with severe cognitive impairment(10, 12, 15, 19, 20)(Domain 4).

Several well publicized studies did not meet our inclusion criteria. The outbreak on the Diamond
Princess cruise ship involved 3,711 passengers of whom over 600 acquired COVID-19.(3) Many of
the positive cases were relocated to medical facilities in Japan without details of their clinical
progression. To correct for the lack of follow-up, Mizumoto and colleagues applied a statistical
adjustment for the right censoring and estimated that 17.9% (95% CI 15.5% - 20.2%) of positive
cases were asymptomatic.
An open invitation screening of the Icelandic population suggested around 0.8% of the population
were SARS-CoV-2 positive, with half classified as (initially) asymptomatic.(2) However, as there
was no follow-up, we cannot separate asymptomatic from pre-symptomatic. Furthermore, the study
excluded symptomatic people undergoing targeted testing, which impeded an estimate of an overall
asymptomatic rate.
A study of 215 pregnant women in New York identified 33 SARS-CoV-2 positive women.(23) On
admission to the delivery unit, 4 of the 33 positive cases were symptomatic and 3 became
symptomatic before postpartum discharge, suggesting an asymptomatic rate of 26/33 (79%).
However, the 2 days of follow-up was insufficient to meet our inclusion criteria.
A case report of a pre-symptomatic Chinese businessman transmitting COVID-19 to a German
business partner was also excluded because despite three other people acquiring the infection from
the affected German source, none of them was asymptomatic at follow-up.(24) A 5-day pointprevalence testing of adults living in homeless shelters in Boston found 147 positive cases of which
“the majority” had mild or no symptoms.(25) We excluded this study, as there was no numeric
estimate for true asymptomatic, and no follow-up assessment.
Two studies examined people repatriated from overseas to their home countries by plane. Neither
study was clear whether symptomatic people could board the plane and be included - and if excluded,
they would overestimate the asymptomatic rates. The study of 565 Japanese citizens repatriated from
China,(26) found 13 positives: 4 asymptomatic and 9 symptomatic, based on screening on arrival.
The other of 383 Greek citizens repatriated from UK, Spain, and Turkey(27) found 40 asymptomatic
positives on arrival, 4 of whom later self-reported symptoms. Again, the likely initial exclusion of
symptomatic people, and the lack of comprehensive follow up would both overestimate the
asymptomatic rates.

Discussion
Though the rate of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases has received considerable attention, we could find
only 13 studies that provided an adequate sample frame and follow-up to ascertain a valid estimate of
the proportion of asymptomatic cases. The combined estimate of the asymptomatic proportion was
17% (95% CI 14% - 20%), but with considerable heterogeneity (I2=84%) and a 95% prediction
interval that ranged from 4% to 52%. There was no clear difference in the proportions between aged
care and non-aged care studies. Only five of the 13 studies provided data on transmission rates from
asymptomatic cases. The transmission risk from asymptomatic cases appeared to be lower than that
of symptomatic cases, but there was considerable uncertainty in the extent of this (RR 0.58; 95% CI
0.335-0.994, p=0.047).

Strengths of our systematic review include achieving full methodological rigor within a much shorter
time frame than traditional reviews using enhanced processes and automation tools.(5) We also
critically assessed the risk of bias of all full text articles we screened to include studies with the least
risk of bias in sampling frame and length of follow up domains to be able to differentiate between the
asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases.
There are several limitations to our findings. First, our search focused on published and pre-print
articles, and may have missed some public health reports that are either unpublished or only available
on organisational websites. Second, the design and reporting of most of the studies had a number of
important deficits that could impact their inclusion or our estimates. These deficits include the poor
reporting of the sample frame, the testing and symptom check, and the follow-up processes. Such
reporting would have been considerably aided by a flow chart of cases (as Lavezzo et al does) of
identification, testing, and follow-up including missing data. A further important limitation was the
poor reporting of symptoms, which was often simply dichotomised into symptomatic versus
asymptomatic without clear definitions and details of possible mild symptoms. The included studies
did not report sufficient data to examine the impact of age and underlying comorbidities on the
asymptomatic rate. Finally, all included studies relied on RT-qPCR, hence some cases might have
been missed due to false negative result, especially where study participants were only tested
once.(28) If the tests missed more asymptomatic cases, then the true proportion of asymptomatic
cases could be higher than our estimates. On the other hand, false positive results which may occur
when people without symptoms are tested in low prevalence settings, would mean the true prevalence
of asymptomatic cases was lower than our estimates.
Several other non-systematic and systematic reviews have examined the proportion of asymptomatic
cases. The non-systematic reviews estimated asymptomatic rates between 5% and 80%.(4, 29)
However, they only included early cross-sectional reports and did not critically appraise the study
design, nor attempted to pool the most valid studies. Five other systematic reviews reported pooled
estimates of asymptomatic rate between 8%-16%.(30-34) However, these reviews included studies
we excluded due to high risk of bias in sampling frame. Ongoing monitoring for new studies is
warranted but should include robust methodological assessment including ensuring included studies
have sufficient follow up period to differentiate the asymptomatic from presymptomatic cases. Our
review currently also has a more recent search date than the other reviews and includes sensitivity
analysis by length of follow up time. Our estimate on risk of transmission by asymptomatic cases
was comparable to two other empirical data reported by Buitrago-Garcia et al (RR 0.35) and Koh et
al (RR 0.39).(32, 34)
Estimates of the proportion of the cases that are asymptomatic and the risk of transmission are vital
parameters for modelling studies. Our estimates of the proportion of asymptomatic cases and their
risk of transmission suggest that asymptomatic spread is unlikely to be a major driver of clusters or
community transmission of infection, but the extent of transmission risk for pre-symptomatic and
minor symptomatic cases remains unknown. The generalisability of the overall estimate is unclear,
and we observed considerable variation across the included studies which had different settings,
countries, and study design, reflected in the reasonably wide prediction interval.

Many unanswered questions about asymptomatic cases remain. Only one of the more recent studies
we included tested the patients for IgG antibodies to determine the seroconversion in the elderly.
Without repeated and widespread RT-PCR and antibody tests, it is difficult to accurately estimate the
prevalence of COVID-19 infection and inform our infection prevention strategies for.(35) The role of
viral load and virus shedding dynamics in asymptomatic and symptomatic cases will further help
answer the question of forward transmission and disease length and severity. Other unknowns
include whether there is a difference in in the proportion of cases that are asymptomatic according to
age (particularly children vs adults), sex, or underlying comorbidities; and whether asymptomatic
cases develop long-term immunity to new infections. For most studies, the PCR (+) cases were traced
from the index cases and the testing were carried out mostly at the beginning of the pandemic wave
for the locale. So, for this review of inception cohorts, people with long-term persistent positive
testing were unlikely to be misclassified as asymptomatic. The issue of persistent PCR positivity after
a person has recovered from infection might be of concern to more recent studies conducted at some
time after the “first” wave of the pandemic has happened. In such studies, researchers will need to
ask about history of illness compatible with COVID-19 even if this occurred months ago, and the
PCR testing could be supplemented by other tests such as viral culture and anti-SARS-CoV-2
antibody tests.
Our recommendations for future research also include improved clearer reporting of methods,
sampling frames, case definition of asymptomatic, extent of contact tracing, duration of follow-up
periods, presentation of age distribution of asymptomatic cases and separation of presymptomatic and
mild cases from asymptomatic cases in result tables. Most studies used a limited definition of
asymptomatic COVID-19 case. That could lead to mixing paucisymptomatic people with the
asymptomatic cases. If that were common issue, then the true asymptomatic prevalence would be
even lower than the current estimates. A reliable estimate of the proportion of asymptomatic cases
and the burden of disease is imperative in our understanding of infection transmission capacity of
asymptomatic cases to inform public health measures for these individuals who according to our
findings appear to pose lower risk of transmission. Until we have further immunological and
epidemiological evidence, we advise that the importance of asymptomatic cases for driving the
spread of pandemic to be considered with caution.
