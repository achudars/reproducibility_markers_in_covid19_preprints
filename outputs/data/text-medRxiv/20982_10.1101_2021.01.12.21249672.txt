Abstract

2

Purpose

3

We aimed to describe the demographics, cancer subtypes, comorbidities and outcomes of

4

patients with a history of cancer with COVID-19 from March to June 2020. Secondly, we

5

compared patients hospitalized with COVID-19 to patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and

6

patients hospitalized with influenza.

7

Methods

8

We conducted a cohort study using eight routinely-collected healthcare databases from Spain

9

and the US, standardized to the Observational Medical Outcome Partnership common data

10

model. Three cohorts of patients with a history of cancer were included: i) diagnosed with

11

COVID-19, ii) hospitalized with COVID-19, and iii) hospitalized with influenza in 2017-

12

2018. Patients were followed from index date to 30 days or death. We reported

13

demographics, cancer subtypes, comorbidities, and 30-day outcomes.

14
15

Results

16

We included 118,155 patients with a cancer history in the COVID-19 diagnosed and 41,939

17

in the COVID-19 hospitalized cohorts. The most frequent cancer subtypes were prostate and

18

breast cancer (range: 5-19% and 1-14% in the diagnosed cohort, respectively). Hematological

19

malignancies were also frequent, with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma being among the 5 most

20

common cancer subtypes in the diagnosed cohort. Overall, patients were more frequently

21

aged above 65 years and had multiple comorbidities. Occurrence of death ranged from 8% to

22

14% and from 18% to 26% in the diagnosed and hospitalized COVID-19 cohorts,

respectively. Patients hospitalized with influenza (n=242,960) had a similar distribution of

2

cancer subtypes, sex, age and comorbidities but lower occurrence of adverse events.

3

Conclusion

4

Patients with a history of cancer and COVID-19 have advanced age, multiple comorbidities,

5

and a high occurence of COVID-19-related events. Additionaly, hematological malignancies

6

were frequent in these patients.This observational study provides epidemiologic

7

characteristics that can inform clinical care and future etiological studies.

Background

2

Shortly after the emergence of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), patients with

3

cancer were reported to be a high-risk population for COVID-19.1,2 These patients have an

4

increased susceptibility to infections as a result of their immunosuppressed state, caused by

5

the cancer itself, certain types of chemo- or immunotherapy, or surgery and a higher exposure

6

to healthcare-associated infections (HAI).3 In addition, patients with cancer are often older

7

and with additional comorbidities, which might increase their risk of worse COVID-19

8

outcomes.4

9

Prior studies assessing COVID-19-related risks in the cancer population have demonstrated

10

conflicting results. Some studies found that patients with cancer have an increased risk of

11

COVID-19 related hospitalization, admission to intensive care units, and mortality compared

12

to patients without cancer, 1,2,4,5 whereas others did not.6,7 These studies included a limited

13

number of patients with cancer, were conducted across different countries and geographic

14

regions with different incidence of infection at varying time points and used different

15

definitions for cancer (e.g., active cancer, solid cancer, history of cancer), which limit their

16

generalizability. Furthermore, they presented results for models adjusted by (different)

17

arbitrary covariates, without a theoretical framework of confounding variables, which limits

18

the interpretation for descriptive and causal inference purposes.8,9

19

Given that COVID-19 is a novel disease, large descriptive studies are essential to inform

20

public health strategies and clinical care, as well as to provide the groundwork for future

21

etiological studies. Large studies with detailed information of medical conditions and health

22

outcomes, such as thromboembolic events, in patients with cancer and COVID-19 are lacking

23

to date. To fill that gap, we conducted a multi-national study aiming to describe the

24

demographics, cancer subtypes, comorbidities and outcomes of patients with a history of

cancer and COVID-19. In addition, we compared patients with a history of cancer

2

hospitalized with COVID-19 to i) patients with a history of cancer diagnosed with COVID-

3

19; and ii) patients with a history of cancer hospitalized with seasonal influenza (2017-2018)

Study design, setting and data sources

8

This study was part of the CHARYBDIS (Characterizing Health Associated Risks, and Your

9

Baseline Disease In SARS-COV-2) project designed by the Observational Health Data

10

Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) community. CHARYBDIS is large-scale study aiming to

11

characterize individuals with COVID-19 using routinely-collected healthcare data (protocol

12

available at https://www.ohdsi.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Protocol_COVID-19-

13

Charybdis-Characterisation_V5.docx). Twenty-two databases standardized to the

14

Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM)10 have

15

contributed to CHARYBDIS to date. The OHDSI network maintains the OMOP-CDM, and

16

its members have developed a wide range of tools to facilitate analyses of such mapped

17

data.11 Results for this sub-study were extracted from the overarching result set on October,

18

9th, 2020.

19

From the databases that contributed to CHARYBDIS, we included those reporting data on at

20

least 140 subjects with a history of cancer diagnosed and/or hospitalized with COVID-19.

21

This cut-off was established to estimate the prevalence of conditions and 30-days outcomes

22

affecting 10% of the study population with a confidence interval (CI) width of +/- 5%. The

23

selection process is depicted in Appendix Figure A1. Up to eight databases from two

24

countries (Spain and the United States (US)) were included in this study. Spanish data came

from SIDIAP, a primary care database linked to hospital admissions.12 Data from the US

2

included Electronic Health Records (EHR) from the hospital setting: CU-AMC-HDC,

3

CUIMC, Optum-EHR,13 and VA-OMOP (93% male, mostly veterans); as well as claims

4

data: HealthVerity and IQVIA-OpenClaims. All databases reported patients with COVID-19

5

identified from March to June 2020, apart from CU-AMC-HDC that included data to August

6

2020. For a description of the included data sources, see Appendix Table A1.

7
8

Study participants

9

We included three non-mutually exclusive cohorts of patients with a history of cancer: i)

10

patients diagnosed with COVID-19, ii) patients hospitalized with COVID-19, and iii) patients

11

hospitalized with seasonal influenza in 2017-2018.

12

To comprehensively capture baseline characteristics, we only included patients with at least

13

one year of observation time available prior to index date (i.e., date of start of the cohort).

14

Patients with a history of cancer were defined as those having a record of any malignant

15

neoplasm excluding non-melanoma skin cancer prior to the index date. Patients diagnosed

16

with COVID-19 were those having a clinical diagnosis and/or a positive test for the severe

17

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) documented in outpatient or

18

inpatient records. Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were those who had a hospitalization

19

episode and a COVID-19 clinical diagnosis or positive SARS-CoV-2 test within a time

20

window of 21 days prior to admission up to the end of their hospitalization. We chose this

21

time window to include patients with a diagnosis prior to hospitalization and to allow for a

22

record delay in test results or diagnoses. Similarly, patients hospitalized with seasonal

23

influenza were those who had a hospitalization episode and a influenza clinical diagnosis or

24

positive test result for influenza in 2017-2018.14 The criteria to define patients with a history

25

of cancer and COVID-19 and influenza cases can be found in Appendix Table A2.

1

Index date for the diagnosed cohort was the date of clinical diagnosis or the earliest test day

2

registered within seven days of a first positive test, whichever occurred first. Index date for

3

both hospitalized cohorts (COVID-19 and influenza) was the day of hospitalization. Patients

4

were followed from the index date to the earliest of either death, end of the observation

5

period,15 or 30 days.

7

Patient characteristics and outcomes

8

More than 15,000 medical conditions from up to one year prior to index date were identified

9

in each cohort based on the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED) hierarchy,

10

with all descendant codes included.15 In addition, we created specific definitions for

11

comorbidities and outcomes of particular interest (available in Appendix Table A2). To

12

describe the frequency of cancer subtypes by topographical location (henceforth, referred to

13

as cancer types), we selected 26 cancer types based on the most prevalent cancers in Spain

14

and the US, according to data from the International Agency for Research on Cancer.16 The

15

SNOMED codes used to identify each cancer type can be found in Appendix Table A3.

16

We report here demographics (sex and age), antineoplastic and immunomodulating treatment

17

received in the month and year prior to the index date and a selection of key comorbidities

18

(based on their relevance to the COVID-19 field and on their prevalence in the cohorts).

19
20

The 30-day outcomes of interest in the COVID-19 diagnosed cohort were hospitalization and

21

death (from all causes). In the hospitalized cohorts (COVID-19 and influenza), the outcomes

22

of interest were acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury (AKI),

23

cardiovascular disease events, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, sepsis,

24

requirement of intensive services (identified by a recorded mechanical ventilation and/or a

causes). SIDIAP only reported death and hospitalization, whereas CU-AMC-HDC did not

report any outcome.

Data characterization and analysis

6

Analysis was performed through a federated analysis approach.15 Following a pre-specified

7

analysis plan, a common analytical code for the whole CHARYBDIS study was developed by

8

the OHDSI Methods library and run locally in each participating site (code available at

9

zenodo.org).17 Individual-level data remained within host institutions and only aggregate

10

results were provided to the research team and publicly-shared. The results reported in this

11

manuscript, and additional data, are available for consultation on a regularly updated website

12

as new databases and/or results are added

13

(https://data.ohdsi.org/Covid19CharacterizationCharybdis/).

14

Herein, we describe the lifetime cancer prevalence (recorded any time prior to the index date)

15

and the number of patients included by database and cohort. Results are calculated and

16

reported by cohort and database. Demographics, cancer types, comorbidities, and outcomes

17

are reported as proportions (calculated as the number of persons within a given category,

18

divided by the total number of persons), along with 95%CI. To calculate these proportions, a

19

minimum count required of 5 individuals was established to minimize the risk of re

20

identification of patients.We also report the ranking of the 10 most common cancer types by

21

frequency. In addition, we summarized the prevalence of all the baseline conditions retrieved

22

Results

7

Lifetime cancer prevalence

8

Overall, the databases included in this study identified 906,691 patients diagnosed with

9

COVID-19 and 196,018 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The lifetime cancer

10

prevalence ranged from 4% (HealthVerity) to 25% (STARR-OMOP) in all patients

11

diagnosed with COVID-19; whereas it ranged from 11% (HealthVerity) to 40%(VA-OMOP)

12

in all patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (Appendix Table A4). In addition, 242,960

13

patients hospitalized with seasonal influenza in 2017-2018 were identified. Among those, the

14

lifetime cancer prevalence ranged from 21% (Optum-EHR) to 39% (VA-OMOP).

15

We included 118,155 patients diagnosed (Spain: 8,854; US: 109,301) and 41,939 patients

16

hospitalized (Spain: 2,610; US: 39,329) with COVID-19 and history of cancer and 62,077

17

patients hospitalized (all from the US) with seasonal influenza and history of cancer.

Demographics

19

The distribution of demographics, comorbidities and outcomes of both COVID-19 cohorts

20

can be found in Table 1 (95%CI of each condition available in Appendix Table A5). In the

21

diagnosed cohort, patients were more commonly female (range 53% to 55%), aside from

22

STARR-OMOP (47%) and VA-OMOP (7.1%). In contrast, in the hospitalized cohort, male

predominated in all databases (range 50% to 60%, VA-OMOP: 96%). Overall, patients were

2

mainly aged above 65 years in both COVID-19 diagnosed and hospitalized cohorts and

3

patients hospitalized were consistently older than those diagnosed (Appendix Figure A2). In

4

the diagnosed cohort, the proportion of patients having received antineoplastic and

5

immunomodulating agents the month and the year prior to index date ranged from 5%

6

(HealthVerity) to 23% (STARR-OMOP) and from 14% (SIDIAP) to 35% (CU-AMC-DHC),

7

respectively. Similarly, in the hospitalized cohort it ranged from 6% (HealthVerity) to 28%

8

(CU-AMC-DHC) and from 14% (SIDIAP) to 38% (CU-AMC-DHC), respectively.

9

Frequency of cancer types

10

For both COVID-19 cohorts, the frequency of the 26 selected cancer types can be consulted

11

in Appendix Table A6. The top ten cancer types by frequency are reported in Table 2. In the

12

COVID-19 diagnosed cohort, the most frequent cancers in four databases were breast

13

(SIDIAP: 14.2%; CU-AMC-HDC: 7.3%; Optum-EHR: 6.7%; and STARR-OMOP: 12.3%)

14

and prostate cancer (CUIMC: 6.1%; HealthVerity: 12.2%; IQVIA-OpenClaims: 7.1%; VA-

15

OMOP: 18.1%). In all databases, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) was among the five most

16

common cancers. Bladder, colorectal, leukemia, and lung cancer were also common (among

17

the ten most frequent in at least 7 out of 8 databases).

18

In the COVID-19 hospitalized cohort, prostate cancer was the most frequent cancer in all

19

databases (ex aequo with NHL in CU-AMC-HDC, 6.4%), aside from Optum-EHR (breast

20

cancer, 6.4%), in which it was the second most frequent. NHL was among the three most

21

frequent cancers in all databases aside from SIDIAP and STARR-OMOP, where NHL was

22

the fifth most common. Leukemia, liver and lung cancer were also within the top ten in the

23

majority of databases. We did not observe meaningful differences (i.e. SMD >|0.1|) when

2

Prior comorbidities

4

In both COVID-19 cohorts, the most common comorbidities were cardiometabolic

5

conditions, which were more frequent in the US databases (especially VA-OMOP) than in the

6

Spanish SIDIAP database. For example, hypertension ranged in the US from 52% to 87%

7

(Spain: 32%) among diagnosed and from 58% to 93% (Spain: 33%) among hospitalized

8

patients. Other common conditions include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

9

(range in diagnosed: 12% to 43% (Spain: 34%), range in hospitalized: 11% to 53% (Spain:

10

42%)); and chronic kidney disease (range in diagnosed: 18% to 34% (Spain: 19%), range in

11

hospitalized: 20% to 44% (Spain: 24%)). The prevalence of the full range of prior conditions

12

summarized is shown in Figure 2. Several comorbidities were more frequent among patients

13

hospitalized compared to patients diagnosed (SMD>0.1): heart disease (all databases except

14

STARR-OMOP) and chronic kidney disease, hypertension and type 2 diabetes (all except

15

SIDIAP and STARR-OMOP) (Figure 3).

16

Thirty-day outcomes

17

In the COVID-19 diagnosed cohort, hospitalization rates in the US databases ranged from

18

14% to 40% (Spain: 25%) and occurrence of death from 8% to 10% (Spain: 14%).

19

In the COVID-19 hospitalized cohort, outcomes were heterogeneous across databases,

20

occurring less frequently in STARR-OMOP and more frequently in VA-OMOP. ARDS

21

ranged from 8% to 41%, although it was higher than 30% in 3 out of 6 databases with data

22

available (IQVIA-OpenClaims, Optum-EHR, VA-OMOP). Sepsis was also common, ranging

23

from 6% to 25%. Cardiovascular disease events and AKI ranged from 7% to 21% and from

10% to 16%, respectively. Thromboembolic events were less frequent, with deep vein

2

thrombosis ranging from 2% to 5% and pulmonary embolism from 2% to 4%. Intensive

3

services requirement ranged from 6% to 16%, whereas occurrence of death ranged from 18%

4

to 26% in the US (Spain: 21%).

5

Comparison of patients with a history of cancer hospitalized with COVID-19 to those

6

hospitalized with seasonal influenza

7

The characteristics of patients with a history of cancer hospitalized with seasonal influenza

8

are reported in Appendix Table A8. Overall, these patients were predominantly male and the

9

majority clustered around the ages of 60 to 85 years old (Appendix Figure A5). When

10

comparing the frequency of cancer types between COVID-19 and influenza patients, we did

11

not observe consistent differences across databases (Appendix Figure A4). The distribution of

12

comorbidities was similar in both groups, with few exceptions (Figure 2A). For example,

13

COPD was more common among patients with influenza in 3 databases: CU-AMC-HDC,

14

Optum-EHR and VA-OMOP (Figure 3A). Aside from CUIMC, outcomes were more

15

common in the COVID-19 cohort, especially ARDS, ranging from 16% to 41% in the

16

COVID-19 cohort and from 14% to 30% in the influenza cohort (SMD>0.2 in IQVIA-

17

OpenClaims and Optum EHR, SMD>0.1 in VA-OMOP). Occurrence of death was higher

18

among COVID-19 patients compared to influenza patients in VA-OMOP: 18% vs 6

19

(SMD>0.2) (Figures 2B and 3B).

Discussion

In this multinational cohort study, we described in detail the characteristics of 118,155

patients with a history of cancer and COVID-19, including outcomes that have been rarely

reported in this population. The lifetime cancer prevalence was higher among those

2

hospitalized compared to all those diagnosed with COVID-19. In both COVID-19 cohorts of

3

patients with history of cancer, the most frequent cancer type was either prostate or breast

4

cancer; hematological malignancies were also frequent. Comorbidities were common in both

5

cohorts but were higher among those hospitalized. Occurence of death ranged from 7% to

6

14% among those diagnosed and from 18% to 26% among those hospitalized. When

7

compared to patients with a history of cancer hospitalized with seasonal influenza, patients

8

hospitalized with COVID-19 had a similar distribution of sex, age and comorbidities but had

9

more severe outcomes.

10

According to recent estimates, the lifetime cancer prevalence in the US is 5%.19 In Spain, the

11

5-year cancer prevalence is 1.7% (data on the lifetime cancer prevalence is unavailable to our

12

knowledge).16 Although our results were heterogeneous, we found that the lifetime cancer

13

prevalence was higher among COVID-19 cases compared to the general population, ranging

14

from 4% to 25% in the diagnosed and from 11% to 40% in the hospitalized cohort. Even

15

though comparisons are limited due to differences in the definition of cancer, these

16

prevalences are also higher than prior reports on COVID-19 patients at hospital settings. In

17

early studies from China, less than 3% of inpatients with COVID-19 had cancer, whereas

18

studies from Europe and the US have reported a cancer prevalence of 6% to 11%.20–25 A

19

Danish study, however, found a lifetime cancer prevalence among patients hospitalized with

20

COVID-19 of 17%, which is in line with our results.6 Further, the lifetime cancer prevalence

21

was consistently higher in patients hospitalized compared to those diagnosed, which might

22

partially be due to the older age of the former.

23

The most lifetime-prevalent cancer types in the US population are prostate (in men) and

24

breast (in women) cancer.19 Two hematological malignancies are also frequent among cancer

survivors: NHL is the fifth/sixth more frequent (men and women, respectively), whereas

2

leukemia is the ninth in men. We found that prostate and breast cancer were the most

3

frequent cancers in COVID-19 patients, which is in line with the general cancer population.

4

These cancer types were similarly common among diagnosed patients (where females

5

predominated slightly), whereas in hospitalized patients (where males were the majority),

6

prostate cancer was more frequent than breast cancer. On the other hand, hematological

7

malignancies were more common than expected in our cohorts (both COVID-19 and

8

influenza). For example, in the COVID-19 hospitalized cohorts, NHL, leukemia and multiple

9

myeloma were among the third, fifth, and tenth more common cancers, respectively. Prior

10

studies have reported an overrepresentation of hematological malignancies in COVID-19

11

patients compared to the general population.5,26 This is of particular concern in light of

12

evidence suggesting that patients with hematological malignancies have an increased risk of

13

COVID-19 mortality compared to those with solid cancers.5 The fact that hematological

14

malignancies were more common than expected in both the diagnosed and the hospitalized

15

COVID-19 cohorts raises questions on whether patients with these malignancies are more

16

exposed or more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection, or both. Because of the underlying

17

severity of their disease, patients with hematological malignancies are particularly at risk of

18

HAI 27 and SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks have already been described in hematological units.28

19

As expected, patients with a history of cancer were older and had more comorbidities than

20

overall COVID-19 cases. A meta-analysis comprising 12,149 COVID-19 cases (mostly

21

hospitalized) found hypertension (23%), heart failure (20%) and diabetes (12%) were the

22

most common comorbidities.29 These numbers are substantially lower than what we have

23

observed. Similarly, a study characterizing COVID-19 inpatients found a prevalence of heart

24

disease of 27% in SIDIAP (vs 42% in this study), 29% in CUIMC (vs 77%) and 48% in VA-

25

OMOP (vs 80%).14 Compared to studies reporting comorbidities among patients with cancer,

1

we also found higher prevalences of comorbidities. For example, chronic kidney disease

2

(range 20-44%), diabetes (23-59%) and obesity (26-60%) were higher in our hospitalized

3

cohort than in a study including COVID-19 inpatients with a history of solid cancer (16%,

4

22% and 10% had chronic kidney disease, diabetes and obesity, respectively).23 In addition,

5

we observed that heart disease, chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes were meaningfully

6

higher among those hospitalized compared to those diagnosed. These conditions have been

7

previously reported as potential risk factors for hospitalization, increased severity and

8

mortality among COVID-19 cases.30 The role of comorbidities should be taken into

9

consideration when designing future studies assessing the effect of cancer on COVID-19-

10

related health outcomes, as failing to adjust for some comorbidities or adjusting for others

11

(over-adjustment) could lead to confounding and/or selection bias given the high comorbidity

12

burden.

13

According to the World Health Organization, in June 2020 the case-fatality ratio among

14

confirmed COVID-19 cases was 11.4% in Spain and 5.0% in the US,31 which is lower than

15

the all-cause mortality observed both in the diagnosed (Spain: 14%, US: 8-10%) and

16

hospitalized (Spain: 21%, US: 18-26%) cohorts. A meta-analysis including 18,650 patients

17

with cancer and COVID-19 (mostly from the hospital setting) reported a pooled case

18

mortality rate of 25.6% (95% CI: 22.0-29.5%),32 in line with our findings in the hospitalized

19

cohort. Undoubtedly, increased age and underlying comorbidities play a substantial role in

20

COVID-19 related mortality among these patients.

21

Finally, we have compared patients with cancer history hospitalized with COVID-19 to those

22

with seasonal influenza as a benchmark. We previously showed that COVID-19 patients are

23

more often male, younger and less likely to have respiratory and cardiovascular diseases than

24

influenza patients.14 Interestingly, we have observed that COVID-19 and influenza patients

1

with a history of cancer have a similar sex and age distribution and are of comparable health

2

status. Despite this similarity, patients with cancer history and COVID-19 had worse

3

outcomes than those with cancer history and influenza, including mortality, intensive services

4

requirements, ARDS and thromboembolic events, which might be expected given the

5

virulence of the disease.

6

This study has many major strengths, such as its large size. We have reported more than

7

10,000 aggregate characteristics from more than 100,000 patients from eight different

8

databases and two countries. The diverse healthcare settings and populations described in this

9

study, together with our multinational approach, increases the generalizability of our findings.

10

Further, as CHARYBDIS is an ongoing study, we expect that more databases from a range of

11

countries will provide sufficient data on the cancer population as the pandemic evolves. By

12

including only individuals with at least one year of observation time available prior to index

13

date, we have comprehensively captured baseline comorbidities, which could explain the

14

higher prevalence of selected comorbidities in our cohorts compared to prior studies. In

15

addition, we have ensured confidentiality throughout the study using a federated analysis

16

approach. Finally, for the purposes of transparency and reproducibility, our methods, tools,

17

and results are all publicly available.

18

However, this study also has several limitations. First, we were not able to provide detailed

19

cancer information, such as the year of cancer diagnosis or stage of tumour at diagnosis; nor

20

identify patients with active cancer treatment, and we were not able to characterize patients

21

stratified by cancer types due to small sample sizes. Secondly, although we included patients

22

with a clinical COVID-19 diagnosis to reduce selection bias due to testing restrictions during

23

the first months of the pandemic, we cannot exclude that we have incurred some false

24

positives. Additionally, we did not have information on the cause of death and reported all-

25

cause death as an outcome. Third, the differences found in the COVID-19/seasonal influenza

1

comparison may have been influenced by temporal changes in clinical practice standards and

2

coding. Further, the use of influenza vaccination among high-risk population groups likely

3

contributed to the observed low proportion of adverse events among influenza patients.

4

Finally, we found heterogeneous results across databases, which hinders the interpretation of

5

our findings. Heterogeneity across data sources is a known phenomenon when using real-

6

world data that reflects the existence of different coding practices, observation period,

7

healthcare settings and populations. Indeed, the fact that the percentages of several cancer

8

types were very low in some databases might be explained by differences in coding practices

9

across data sources (i.e. some codes might be more widely used in some databases than

10

others). Similarly, the use of routinely-collected data could have led to an underestimation of

11

the lifetime cancer prevalence, cancer types, comorbidities, and outcomes due to incomplete

12

reporting. While the interpretation of heterogeneous results is challenging, these also provide

13

valuable insights into the particularities of each each setting, which is the objective of

14

generalizability of real world data for certain populations. Yet, despite this heterogeneity, we

15

found consistent patterns when comparing characteristics across cohorts, which lends

16

credence to our results.

17

18

Conclusion

19

This in-depth characterization revealed that COVID-19 patients with a history of cancer are

20

mostly aged above 65 years old and have a myriad of comorbidities that may explain the high

21

frequency of severe COVID-19-outcomes observed in this population. In addition, we found

22

that hematological malignancies were more frequent than expected. These findings are

23

foundational for guiding future studies and highlight the importance of protecting patients

24

with cancer while guaranteeing cancer care continuity during the pandemic.
