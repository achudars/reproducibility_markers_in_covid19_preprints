COVID-19 rumors

Abstract
Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, many rumors have emerged. Given prior

14

research linking rumor exposure to mental well-being, we conducted a nation-wide

15

survey to document the base rate of rumor exposure and factors associated with

16

rumor vulnerability. Between March to July 2020, 1237 participants were surveyed on

17

5 widely-disseminated COVID-19 rumors (that drinking water frequently could be

18

preventive, that eating garlic could be preventive, that the outbreak arose because of

19

bat soup consumption, that the virus was created in an American lab, and that the

20

virus was created in a Chinese lab). For each rumor, participants reported whether

21

they had heard, shared or believed each rumor. Although most participants had been

22

exposed to COVID-19 rumors, few shared or believed these. Sharing behaviors

23

sometimes occurred in the absence of belief; however, education emerged as a

24

protective factor for both sharing and belief. Together, our results suggest that

25

campaigns targeting skills associated with higher education (e.g. epistemology) may

26

prove more effective than counter-rumor messages.

COVID-19 rumors

Vulnerability to rumors during the COVID-19 pandemic:

31

Results of a national survey

1. Introduction

33

The global outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has come with

34

increased psychological burden. In several meta-analyses, depression and anxiety

35

symptoms have been found to be elevated amongst healthcare workers and the

36

general population (da Silva and Neto, 2021; Pappa et al., 2020; Salari et al., 2020).

37

Others have reported a higher incidence of stress-related symptoms or of post-

38

traumatic stress disorder (Cooke et al., 2020; Torales et al., 2020). These findings

39

highlight the urgent need to understand factors predicting psychiatric outcomes,

40

allowing vulnerable individuals to be identified and interventions to be developed.

41

In terms of predictors, exposure to COVID-19 rumors has emerged as a risk

42

factor for poor mental health (Gao et al., 2020; Liu and Tong, 2020; Vardanjani et al.,

43

2020; Xiong et al., 2020). This has occurred against the backdrop of an “infodemic” –

44

a surge of COVID-19 misinformation created and shared primarily via social media

45

(World Health Organization, 2020). In particular, the fast-changing nature of the

46

pandemic means that accurate information has not always been accessible (Cuan-

47

Baltazar et al., 2020; Hou et al., 2020), resulting in uncertainties that have given rise

48

to a large number of rumors (Depoux et al., 2020; Larson, 2018; Vosoughi et al.,

49

2018).

50

To date, several publicly-available datasets have been analyzed to document

51

the spread of rumors. For example, during the early stage of the pandemic

52

(December to April 2020), search engine keywords reflected popular myths (Rovetta

53

and Bhagavathula, 2020; Singh et al., 2020), with a large number of searches

54

pertaining to alternative medicines that had been speculated to prevent COVID-19

55

(e.g., garlic, Chinese medicinal herbs, or the malaria medication chloroquine; Hou et

56

al., 2020). On the social media platform Twitter, conspiratorial theories were posted

57

regarding disease origins – suggesting, for example, that the virus had been

COVID-19 rumors

58

developed as a bioweapon or had resulted from the introduction of 5G mobile

59

networks (Abd-Alrazaq et al., 2020; Ahmed et al., 2020).

60

5

In turn, the spread of COVID-19 rumors has led to deleterious consequences.

61

In Iran for example, a myth that alcohol consumption could prevent or treat COVID-

62

19 resulted in over 700 deaths related to methanol poisoning, with deaths attributed

63

to methanol poisoning exceeding those attributed to COVID-19 in some provinces

64

(Aghababaeian et al., 2020). Returning to mental health outcomes, the extent to

65

which an individual has been exposed to, has shared, or believed in COVID-19

66

rumors has also been found to predict anxiety symptoms (Liu and Tong, 2020).

67

While demographic predictors of pandemic-related mental health are difficult

68

to address (e.g., age, gender, pre-existing medical conditions; (Torales et al., 2020),

69

a person’s exposure to rumors may constitute a modifiable risk factor (Abdoli, 2020;

70

Ebrahim et al., 2020; Holmes et al., 2020). Correspondingly, efforts to develop

71

interventions would benefit from an understanding of rumor vulnerability: (i) the base

72

rates by which individuals are exposed to, believe in, or share rumors; and (ii) factors

73

predicting these rumor-related experiences (Chua and Banerjee, 2018).

74

At present, little is known about individual vulnerability to COVID-19 rumors.

75

While a handful of studies have surveyed individuals on their social media usage and

76

enquired about rumor dissemination via these platforms (Banakar et al., 2020), we

77

are not aware of any study that has identified persons most likely to encounter,

78

believe in, or to share COVID-19 rumors. To address this gap in the literature, we

79

thus conducted a nationwide survey examining rumor vulnerability during the COVID-

80

19 pandemic.

81

82

2.1 Study design and population

83

Methods

Our study was conducted across five months in Singapore (7 March to 27

84

July 2020), a city-state in Asia that experienced a high number of COVID-19 cases in

85

the early stage of the pandemic. During this time, we recruited 1237 participants who

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.01.20205187; this version posted October 6, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

COVID-19 rumors

86

met the following eligibility criteria: (1) aged ≥21 years old, and (2) had lived in

87

Singapore for ≥2 years. All participants were recruited via social media

88

advertisements within community groups (e.g., groups for residential estates,

89

universities, and workplaces), or through paid Facebook advertisements targeting

90

Singapore-based users.

91

6

Upon study enrolment, participants provided informed consent and completed

92

a 20-minute online survey via Qualtrics. As part of a larger study, participants

93

reported their: (i) demographics, (ii) responses to the pandemic; (iii) sources of

94

COVID-19 news; and (as we report in this paper) (iv) familiarity with rumors (Liu and

95

Tong, 2020; Long and Liu, 2020; Saw et al., 2020). The study protocol was approved

96

by the Yale-NUS College Ethics Review Committee (#2020-CERC-001) and was

97

pre-registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04305574).

98

2.2 Outcome variables

99

As the primary outcome variables, we assessed participants’ familiarity with

100

five rumors that had been widely spread during the COVID-19 pandemic: that (1)

101

drinking water frequently will help prevent infection (COVID-19 prevention); (2) eating

102

garlic can help prevent infection (COVID-19 prevention); (3) the outbreak arose from

103

people eating bat soup (COVID-19 origins); (4) the virus was created in a US lab to

104

affect China's economy (COVID-19 origins); and (5) the virus was created in a

105

Chinese lab as a bioweapon (COVID-19 origins). Rumors were selected for their

106

widespread distribution both internationally and within the local context (Taylor, 2020;

107

World Health Organisation, 2020).

108

For each rumor, participants indicated whether they: (1) had heard the claim

109

before (yes/no); (2) thought the claim was true (yes/no); or (3) had shared the claim

110

on social media (e.g., Facebook, WhatsApp) (yes/no). We assigned a score of 1 for

111

"yes" responses, and summed across the rumors to create three scores: the total

112

number of claims heard, the total number of claims believed, and the total number of

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.01.20205187; this version posted October 6, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

COVID-19 rumors

113

claims shared. Finally, participants also indicated which of 13 possible sources they

114

had encountered the rumors (e.g., Facebook, WhatsApp, online forums, television).

115

2.3 Predictor variables

116

7

As predictor variables, participants reported the following demographic

117

details: age, gender, ethnicity, religion, country of birth, marital status, education,

118

house type (a proxy of socio-economic status), and household size. Using the survey

119

time-stamp, we also recorded two situational-related variables: the total number of

120

local cases reported to date, and whether the country had been in a lock-down when

121

participants completed the survey.

122

2.4 Statistical analysis

123

Using counts (%), we first summarized the baseline rates of rumor familiarity

124

and rumor sources. As further exploratory analyses, we conducted Fisher’s exact

125

test exploring the relationship between believing and sharing each rumor.

126

We then ran linear regression models to predict the following outcome

127

measures: the total number of claims heard [Model 1], the total number of claims

128

believed [Model 2], and the total number of claims shared [Model 3]. Each model

129

involved the full set of predictor variables (described in 2.3), with the number of

130

COVID-19 cases log-transformed for linearity.

131

For each model, we applied Bonferroni correction to control the type 1 family-

132

wise error rate at 0.05 (Bonferroni-adjusted alpha level of 0.05/22 predictors = 0.002).

133

All statistical analyses were conducted using R (Version 4.0).

134

3. Results

135

3.1 Response rate

136

Out of 1751 individuals who accessed the survey link, 1446 (82.6%) provided

137

informed consent and participated in the survey. However, 209 (14.5%) participants

138

did not complete the primary outcome measures (on COVID-19 rumors) and were

139

excluded from statistical analyses.

COVID-19 rumors

140

8

The final sample of 1237 participants is comparable to the resident population

141

with regards to: the proportion of participants born in Singapore, ethnicity, and

142

household size (≤10% difference) and age. However, our sample had more

143

participants who were female (63.9% vs. 51.1%), single (41.9% vs 18.8%), and

144

university graduates (70.7% vs. 32.4%); and fewer participants who lived in 1-3 room

145

public housing flats (8.2% vs. 23.7%) or who had Buddhist beliefs (14.6% vs 33.2%)

146

(Table 1).

147
148
149

[Table 1 about here.]
3.2 Base rates of familiarity with COVID-19 rumors
Out of 5 widely-disseminated rumors, the average participant had heard of

150

3.34 (SD = 1.33) rumors. The most commonly-heard rumor – reported by 8 in 10

151

participants (84.6%) – was that the outbreak had arisen from individuals eating bat

152

soup. Despite high exposure to COVID-19 rumors, however, participants only

153

believed an average of 0.27 claims (SD = 0.59) and shared 0.18 (SD = 0.63). The

154

most commonly-believed rumor was that drinking water could prevent infection

155

(11.4%), whereas the most commonly-shared rumor was again that the disease had

156

arisen from bat soup consumption (7.1%) (Figure 1).

157

[Figures 1 and 2 about here.]

158

In other words, as shown in Figure 2, most participants who had heard each

159

of the 5 rumors neither believed in nor shared the claims. Using Fisher’s exact test,

160

we conducted exploratory analyses to examine how belief and sharing behaviors

161

were related. First, for the claim about the United States manufacturing the

162

coronavirus to affect China's economy, none who shared this rumor believed that it

163

was true (p-value of 1 for Fisher's exact test). In the case of the other 4 rumors,

164

however, there was a significant association between belief and sharing (p < 0.001

165

for the rumors on drinking water and bat soup; p = 0.001 for the rumor on garlic, and

166

p = 0.02 for the rumor on China creating the virus). Nonetheless, even with these 4

167

rumors, not all who propagated the rumors believed that they were true.

COVID-19 rumors

168

Finally, Figure 3 depicts how participants had encountered COVID-19 rumors.

169

As has been previously reported (Ippolito et al., 2020; Pew Research Center, 2018),

170

social media platforms emerged as the leading sources, with 1 in 2 individuals

171

reporting exposure through Facebook (55.5%) or WhatsApp (53.6%).

172
173
174

9

[Figure 3 about here.]
3.3 Predicting rumor hearing, sharing, and believing
Model 1 examined if any demographic or situational factors predicted the

175

number of rumors heard. As shown in Table 2, participants reported hearing more

176

rumors when confirmed local cases were few (early in the pandemic) (b = -0.621,

177

t(1190) = -3.588, p < 0.001) or as lockdown restrictions were lifted (b = 1.129, t(1190)

178

= 4.289, p < 0.001). Additionally, there was a trend for education to predict rumor

179

exposure, with those with higher education hearing more rumors, (b = 0.077, t(1190)

180

= 2.625, p = 0.009). (However, this association was not observed when Bonferroni

181

correction was conducted.)

182

In Models 2 and 3, the same set of predictors were used to predict the

183

number of rumors shared and believed, respectively. For both these models, those

184

who were more educated shared or believed fewer rumors (Model 2: b = -0.046,

185

t(1190) = -3.289, p = 0.001; Model 3: b = -0.046, t(1190) = -3.488, p = 0.001).

186
187

[Table 2 about here.]
4. Discussion

188

During times of crisis, rumors have the potential to transmit misinformation

189

and induce anxiety (Jin et al., 2014; Tran et al., 2020). Against the backdrop of the

190

COVID-19 pandemic, we thus documented how individuals in the community came

191

to receive, believe in, or share specific COVID-19 rumors.

192

First, we observed that rumor exposure was endemic. Nearly all participants

193

had heard at least one rumor and were familiar with an average of 3 out of 5 popular

194

claims assessed. Additionally, most rumor transmission occurred via social media

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.01.20205187; this version posted October 6, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

COVID-19 rumors

195

channels (e.g., Facebook and WhatsApp), as others have noted (Islam et al., 2020;

196

Wang et al., 2019).

197

10

Extending previous research, we further described how the base rate of

198

believing or sharing rumors was far lower than the rate of exposure (with an average

199

of <1 rumor believed or shared). Notably, belief and sharing behaviors did not always

200

co-occur. In the extreme case of one particular rumor (that the COVID-19 crisis had

201

been manufactured by the United States), not a single participant who reported

202

forwarding the rumor actually believed in it. Although belief and sharing were linked

203

for the other rumors we assessed, there continued to be – in each case – individuals

204

who shared rumors without believing their veracity.

205

Our finding that COVID-19 rumors were disseminated even when disbelieved

206

highlights the sheer difficulty of managing the so-called ‘infodemic’. Although similar

207

findings had been reported outside the COVID-19 context (Chua and Banerjee,

208

2017), the World Health Organization and individual governments continue to issue –

209

as the prevailing strategy – fact-checking statements to debunk rumors (Wong et al.,

210

2020; World Health Organisation, 2020; Zarocostas, 2020). Our results bring to

211

question the utility of such statements, since individuals continue to share claims

212

despite perceiving them to be untrue.

213

Based on our findings, an alternative strategy may be to target individual

214

vulnerabilities instead of rumor content. Given that rumor exposure changed with

215

pandemic severity (e.g., the number of cases) and most individuals had encountered

216

COVID-19 rumors, the ensuing question is why only certain individuals fell prey to

217

either belief in or the sharing of these rumors. In our analyses, we found that

218

educational level was a consistent predictor of vulnerability: although higher

219

education predicted that an individual would hear more rumors, higher education was

220

nonetheless protective, associated with fewer rumors shared or believed in.

221

Consequently, it may be profitable to increase public awareness of knowledge and

222

skillsets associated with higher education – for example, epistemology or scientific

COVID-19 rumors

223

thinking (Chong et al., 2020; Chua and Banerjee, 2017) . We note, however, that the

224

correlational nature of our dataset precludes causal inferences, and further research

225

will need to examine the efficacy of such strategies in curbing pandemic-related

226

rumors.

227

4.1 Limitations

228

In describing these findings, we highlight several limitations of our research

229

methods. First, we relied on participants’ self-reports regarding rumor exposure and

230

behaviors. Although this strategy provided individual-level information (e.g., beliefs,

231

demographics) not available in studies of actual rumor posts (e.g., when Twitter

232

posts are mined), the survey method is vulnerable to recollection and reporting

233

biases. Moving forward, future studies may opt to integrate digital documentation of

234

rumor posts alongside self-reported measures.

235

11

As a second limitation, we only sampled rumors that were not time-sensitive.

236

Given the limitations of the survey methodology, we could not track rumors that

237

arose from fast-changing events on the ground – for example, rumors about the first

238

COVID-19-related death in Singapore, or rumors about the availability of face masks

239

(Asokan, 2020; Ministry of Communications and Information, 2020). It thus remains

240

to be seen whether our findings can generalize to these forms of rumors.

241

4.2 Strengths

242

These study limitations need to be viewed alongside the putative strengths of

243

our research methodology. To the best of our knowledge, our study represents the

244

first attempt to identify individual vulnerabilities in the spread of COVID-19 rumors.

245

The research involved a large sample size (1237 participants), captured pandemic-

246

related dynamics over a long duration (5 months), and examined specific rumors that

247

had been widely disseminated.

248

4.3 Conclusions

249
250

In conclusion, our study revealed that educational level was a protective
factor amidst an onslaught of COVID-19 rumors. At a time when information

COVID-19 rumors

12

251

regulation is crucial to resilience and well-being (Abdoli, 2020; Garfin et al., 2020),

252

our findings provide a basis to manage the spread of rumors. In other words, it is not

253

apparent veracity that makes a rumor ‘have it’. Instead, COVID-19 rumors are shared

254

even when disbelieved, but may be stemmed through higher education.
