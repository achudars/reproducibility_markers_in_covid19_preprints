Abstract:

AIMS: The main purpose of this study is to investigate the correlation between the average daily
temperature and the rate of coronavirus epidemic growth in the infected regions.

BACKGROUND: The rapid outbreak of the new Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the spread of the
virus worldwide, especially in the Northern Hemisphere, have prompted various investigations about
the impact of environmental factors on the rate of development of this epidemic. Different studies have
called attention to various parameters that may have influenced the spread of the virus, and in
particular, the impact of climatic parameters has been emphasized.

OBJECTIVE: The main hypothesis object of our research is that between regions exhibiting a significant

difference in the mean daily temperature, a significant difference is also observed in the average
cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases and that this does not happen if there is no significant
difference in mean daily temperature.

METHOD: The research hypothesis was investigated through statistical analysis. The F-test was used to
test whether there is significant equality of variances for each pair of case studies, and then, by the TTest, the existence of a significant difference was investigated. In all statistical tests, the confidence level
of 95% is considered. In order to minimize the impact on the results of factors like the policy of the
government or cultural differences among countries (food, exercise, weight, etc.), three case studies
within five countries, namely Iran, Italy, Germany, Spain, and United States were compared separately.

RESULT: This statistical analysis shows that there is a correlation between the average temperature and

the epidemic rate, and this is especially evident when differences in average daily temperature are
significantly larger, as it happens for Bandar Abbas in Iran, Milan in Italy, Santa Cruz in Spain, and Los
Angeles in the US. Besides, the analysis of the average air temperatures shows that the epidemic rates
of COVID-19 were higher in the case studies with a lower average temperature. Instead, when no
significant differences exist in the average daily temperature of two cities in the same country, there is
no significant difference in the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases.

CONCLUSION: In all five selected countries, we found that when there is a significant difference in the
daily mean temperature between two regions of a country, a significant difference also exists in the
average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases. Conversely, if there are no significant differences in

the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases for these regions. In conclusion, the results of this
study support the research hypothesis and confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method for
analysis of the epidemic rates.

1. Introduction

The outbreak of infectious diseases has always been one of the most important health
problems in the world. With the rapid spread of the new coronavirus (COVID-19), much
attention has been paid to subjects like rate of an epidemic, transition ways, prevention
methods, and remaining time of the virus in the environment [1-5]. Therefore, the behavior of
the virus in relation to environmental factors is critical. The coronavirus is one of the epidemic
diseases that many countries have experienced in the new type of it, COVID-19, and can
become a serious challenge and affect the previous efforts on sustainable development [6-9].
It has been found that there are some delays between the detection of confirmed cases and the
actual infection date due to the laboratory test, the time of the announcement of confirmed
cases in media, and the time for the patients showing initial symptoms for a total usually of 3 to
5 days [10-12]. The analysis of Kampf et al. (2020) demonstrated that COVID-19 could remain
up to 9 days on different materials based on temperature and humidity [13].
Cascella et al. (2020) conducted research on the new coronavirus structure. Their analysis
shows that the virus belongs to the family of single-stranded RNA viruses (+ ssRNA), which has a
length of about 30 kb and an envelope with spear structures and they tested the sensitivity of
the virus to UV rays and temperature [14]. Pirouz et al. (2020) investigated the correlations
between environmental factors and the number of positive cases of COVID-19 by the use of
artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. The results of this study put evidence on the role of urban
and weather conditions on the epidemic rate [15]. Chen et al. (2020) developed a timedependent mathematical model for the prediction of the total number of positive cases [16].
Lytle and Sagripanti (2005) studied the impact of UV rays, and their results determined that it
can affect the structure of coronaviruses because UV rays could damage the nucleic acids of
viral RNA that is vital for the survival of the virus [17]. Pirouz et al., (2020) developed an
assessment method for investigating the impact of climate and urban factors in confirmed
cases of COVID-19 [18]. Bukhari et al., (2020), studied the epidemic of COVID-19 on tropical
zones and their results show that the highest number of infection happened in temperature
among 3 to 17 ºC [19].
The analysis of Grant and Giovannucci (2009) shows that by increasing the UV rays, the level of
vitamin D in the body increases and makes the infection rates decrease. Therefore, in areas on
lower latitudes and closer to the equator line, the epidemic on COVID-19 might be different

[20]. In the study of Chan et al. (2011), the effect of temperature and humidity on SARS
coronavirus was analyzed, and they found that increasing temperature decreases the epidemic
rate by faster disabling virus structure on contaminated surfaces [21].
Pirouz and Violini (2020), analyzed the outbreak patterns of COVID-19 by analysis of 117
countries. They suggested two mechanisms of triggering the development of the infection,
namely the normal spread of an infection from one parent case and the consequence of a
unique phenomenon of accumulation of contagious people [22].
Other studies in this area include Nkengasong and Mankoula, (2020), Wen et al., (2019), Gilbert
et al., (2020), Chinazzi et al., (2020), and Li and Feng, (2020) [23-27].
Analysis of the previous studies demonstrates the necessity of further research about the effect
of environmental factors on the COVID-19. Since some of the previous researches have shown
the effect of weather conditions, especially temperature, on coronavirus viruses, the main
purpose of this study is to investigate the better correlation of daily mean air temperature on
the epidemic rate of the COVID-19.

2. Materials and Methods
In this study, we analyzed the number of positive contagions of coronavirus COVID-19,
from February 29th to March 19th . The selection of February 29th is due to existence on
this date of at least one positive case of COVID-19 in all case studies studied. The
analysis of the weather data started from February15th and ended on March 18th because
the impact of the weather parameter would occur in the upcoming days. Thus, the
considered average daily temperature is with an interval of 1 to 14 days before the
definitive cases of COVID-19.
Analysis conditions:

●

In order to minimize the impact of other parameters on the results, such as the policy of
each government, cultural differences between countries, health care systems, or the
protocols in getting coronavirus test, comparative analysis have been done for different
regions of the same country, without comparing with each other the results of different

The analysis period for confirmed cases of coronavirus COVID-19 is from February 29

to March19 ;
For what concerns the cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases, the total number of
confirmed cases in a region was divided into the population of that region in order to
take into account the different size of the population in each region.

2.2. The statistical analysis and set-up of SPSS Model
Mathematical models have been successfully used for the analysis of many hazards [32,
33]. In complex subjects, different mathematical models can be used to solve the
problem [34-36]. Statistical tests are an appropriate method for the investigation of
possible correlations between different datasets [37]. Many statistical tests can be used
for the analysis of significant differences between the datasets, among which F-test and
Independent-Samples T-Test [38].

Figure 1. Location of the selected case studies [30, 31]
When using F-test, if the significance level (sig.) is less than 0.05, hypothesis H0 is
rejected, and then hypothesis H1 is accepted, i.e., the variances of the datasets in the
two selected regions are not equal. Conversely, if the significance level (sig.) is larger
than 0.05, the hypothesis H1 is rejected, and the hypothesis H0 is accepted, i.e., the
variances of the datasets in the two selected regions are equal.
Through F-test, one determines the presence or absence of differences in the variances
of the two regions. Through another statistical test, the Independent-Samples T-Test,
one can determine whether the difference is significant, has been used. When using
Independent-Samples T-Test, a significance level (sig.) lower (higher) than 0.05, means
that the difference is (is not) significant.
In our analysis, we used SPSS software. The critical factors in the SPSS Model set up are
as follow:

the cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases of COVID-19 during the 19 days from 29Feb to 19-Mar.

●
●

In all statistical tests, the confidence level of 95% is considered.
First, the F-test was used to test whether there is a significant equality of variances for
each pair of case studies, and then, depending on the F-test result, by the T-Test the
existence of a significant difference between the data of the two cases was investigated.

3. Results
The average daily temperature [39, 40], and cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases [41], are
shown in Figures 2 to 6.

Correlations between the average temperatures and the cumulative daily rate of
confirmed cases were found especially for towns with significant differences, with
respect to the other two towns of the same country, in the average daily temperature.
This was the case for Bandar Abas in Iran, Milan in Italy, Santa Cruz in Spain, and Los
Angeles in the US. The average daily temperature and cumulative daily rate of
confirmed cases are listed in Table 2.

As a general feature of Table 2, we notice that

In 11 out of the possible fifteen comparisons, the average cumulative rate of confirmed
cases is higher when the average daily temperature is lower, and in the four remaining
cases the differences in either variable are small.

In Iran, the average daily temperature in Bandar Abbas was the highest (21.54 ºC), and
the average cumulative rate of daily of confirmed cases was the lowest (0.000027).
In Italy, the average daily temperature in Milan was the lowest (7.99 ºC), and the
average cumulative rate of daily of confirmed cases was the highest (0.000690).
In Germany, the average daily air temperatures of the selected towns have similar
values, as well as the spread of the COVID-19 infection is similar.
In Spain, the average daily air temperature in Barcelona and Valencia are similar, and
the spread of the infection is also similar. However, the comparison of Santa Cruz with

●

higher average daily temperatures shows a slower spread of COVID-19.
In the United States, the average daily air temperature in both New York and Seattle are
lower than Los Angeles, and the average cumulative rate of confirmed cases shows the
spread of the virus in both is faster than in Los Angeles.

In Table 3. t values or p-values can be used to check the existence of a significant correlation
between the data for two cities.
Let us discuss in detail one such comparison, that between Ramsar and Tehran. From the F-test,
the F value is equal to 20.4. The criterion for variance equality in the F-test is that the F value
must smaller than the critical F value. The statistical analysis has been done on a statistical
confidence level of 95%, and therefore the error level is 0.05, and considering the degrees of

freedom, the critical F value of the test that can be found through F distribution tables [42], in
this case, is equal to F = 1.57. Since the F value we found is 20.4, larger than the critical F value,
the assumption of the equality of variances is rejected. It means that the average temperature
variance of the Ramsar and Tehran are not equal.
According to the t-test, the t value for these two cities is equal to -1.929. Based on an error level
of 0.05 and by considering the degrees of freedom, the critical values of the test indicated in the
T distribution tables [43], is in this case equal to t = ± 1.645. Since the t value is out of the
critical boundary (-1.645 ≤ acceptable t ≤ +1.645), the assumption of equality in the averages is
rejected, and the existence of difference in averages is confirmed. Thus from two tests, it is
evident that there is a significant difference between the average temperature of the two cities of
Ramsar and Tehran.
An analogous result holds for the average cumulative rate of confirmed cases.
The main results of Table 4, with a confidence level of 95% are as follow:

●

In Iran, the city of Bandar Abbas is significantly different from Ramsar and Tehran in
terms of both average daily temperature and average cumulative rate of confirmed

●

cases.
In Italy, the city of Milan is significantly different from Rome and Naples in terms of both
average daily temperature and average cumulative rate of confirmed cases. Instead, the

●
●

two cities of Rome and Napoli are not significantly different in terms of these variables.
In Germany, there are no significant differences in average daily temperature in all three
cities, and the average cumulative rate of confirmed cases is not significantly different.
In Spain, Barcelona and Valencia are not significantly different in terms of average daily
temperature, and the average cumulative rate of confirmed cases is not significantly
different. However, in Barcelona and Santa Cruz, the average daily temperature is
significantly different, as well as the average cumulative rate of confirmed cases, and

●

the same trend exists between Valencia and Santa Cruz.
In the United States, the two cities of New York and Seattle are not significantly
different in terms of average daily temperature, and of the average cumulative rate of
confirmed cases, the number of patients is not significantly different. Instead, the city of
Los Angeles is significantly different in terms of average daily temperature with two
cities of New York and Seattle, and the average cumulative rate of confirmed cases are
different significantly.

4. Discussion
The results of our analysis of daily air temperature for three case studies from five
countries showed the existence of correlations between the average temperatures and
the epidemic rate, and this is especially evident when the differences in average daily
temperature are larger. For example, in Iran and Italy, the regions with lower average

daily temperature had a higher epidemic level of the new coronavirus (COVID-19), and
the same trend exists in all other case studies.
The statistical analysis showed that in all the case studies we considered, referring to
five different countries, if there is a significant difference in daily mean temperature,
there is also a significant difference in the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed
cases, supporting the proposed research hypothesis about the correlation between air
temperature and the epidemic rates of COVID-19.
The results of this study are in good agreement with other researches about the impact
of air temperature on epidemic diseases and COVID-19, such as the role of daily
weather parameters on the confirmed cases by Pirouz et al., 2020 or the negative impact
of cold weather on the spread of flu virus by Price et al., 2019.
Due to the correlations among temperature and hours of sunshine for future research, it
is recommended to study the effects of the sun's UV rays as well as the average hours of
sunshine on the epidemic rates of COVID-19.
One of the limitations of our work is due to the fact that in our analysis a possible
correlation between the effects induced by temperature and those induced by other
factors (e.g.social distancing, environmental pollution, seniority of the population,
sanitation, lifestyles, etc.) was not taken into account.

5. Conclusions
This study analyzed the possible correlation of daily average air temperature with
the epidemic rate of the coronavirus (COVID-19) using significant differences analysis
between the datasets. The research hypothesis is that in regions with a significant
difference in the average daily temperature, the average cumulative daily rate of
confirmed cases would also is different significantly. Conversely, to the absence of a
significant difference in daily temperature, would correspond no significant difference
in the rate of confirmed cases. The hypothesis was investigated through statistical
analysis. In order to minimize the impact on the results of factors like the policy of the
government or cultural differences among countries (food, exercise, weight, etc.), three
case studies within five countries, namely Iran, Italy, Germany, Spain, and United
States were compared separately. This comparison using statistical analysis through Ftest and Independent-Samples T-Test of the daily temperatures and daily rate of
confirmed cases shows that there is a correlation between the average temperature and
the epidemic rate, and this is especially evident when differences in average daily
temperature are significantly larger, as it happens for Bandar Abbas in Iran, Milan in

Italy, Santa Cruz in Spain, and Los Angeles in the US. Besides, the analysis of the
average air temperatures shows that the epidemic rates of COVID-19 were higher in the
case studies with a lower average temperature. Instead, when no significant differences
exist in the average daily temperature of two cities in the same country, there is no
significant difference in the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases. In
conclusion, the results of this study support the research hypothesis and confirm the
effectiveness of the proposed method for analysis of the epidemic rates.
