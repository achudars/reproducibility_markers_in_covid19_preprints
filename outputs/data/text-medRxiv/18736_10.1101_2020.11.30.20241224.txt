Table of Contents Summary:
Using the most comprehensive database of K-12 COVID-19 case data in the country, Florida
provides clues for understanding student and staff cases in schools.
What’s known on this subject:
Florida schools began reopening to in-person instruction in August have reported more than
18,000 student and staff cases of COVID-19 as of November 14, 2020. Incidence of COVID-19
cases in K-12 students and staff is of urgent public health concern.
What this study adds
COVID-19 cases reported in Florida schools were most influenced by community case rates,
district mask policies, and percent of students attending face-to-face. Student case rates were
highest in high schools (12.5 per 1,000).

Abstract
Data collected from 38 states from August 3 – November 15, 2020 showed more than
250,000 confirmed student and staff cases of SARS-CoV-2 in K-12 schools1. Yet, analysis of
COVID-19 case data in USA schools has been extremely limited2,3. To date, no large-scale or
state-wide analyses by school level and grade has been published, opening a wide gap in
understanding COVID-19 in American schools. A large-scale assessment of available data and
trends could provide a baseline for understanding the virus in the K-12 learning environment and
dispel misconceptions about the prevalence of COVID-19 in schools.

Background
Florida school case data provides an opportunity to examine the extent to which COVID19 has been detected and reported in schools through reporting of cases by day, by school level,
by location, for both students and staff. Student enrollment across Florida’s 67 districts totals
more than 2.67 million, with five of the ten most populated districts in the country within
Florida’s public-school system. Schools in Florida’s mix of urban, suburban and rural districts, in
addition to the variety of policies ranging from availability of virtual instruction to mandatorymask mandates, make it an ideal case study for examining larger trends in COVID-19’s
prevalence in American schools. This data could help inform decisions makers evaluating
mitigation strategies and access to virtual learning, as well as build upon current knowledge of
COVID-19 in American society.

Methods
During August 10 – November 14, 2020, laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in
10,088 students and 4,507 staff in K-12 schools were confirmed by either the Florida Department
of Health, or directly from the 43 independently-reporting school districts in the state (Table 1).
School case data, collected daily, and school enrollment data for both in-person (including
hybrid) and virtual learning were obtained by public records request to each of Florida’s 67
districts for each week of the study period. Data regarding mask policies were obtained either
from each district’s reopening plan, or from public records request. No assessment of school
case data or rates with consideration of age groups and mask policies at this scale or with this
level of granularity were discovered after an exhaustive search.
The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) provides guidance for safely reopening schools,
based primarily on the rate of community spread within a given district or county5. County
COVID-19 case rates were calculated based on new cases over a 14-day period at a rate per
1,000 people based on data reported by the Florida Department of Health6.

Results
During August 10 – November 14, 2020, the state-wide incidence rate (cases per 1,000
students enrolled in face-to-face or hybrid instruction) in Florida high school students (12.5) was
70% higher than younger cohorts (7.4). School data by grade level (e.g. elementary, middle,
high) shows trends consistent with earlier findings by the CDC regarding case rates between
younger and older adolescents4. Staff rates are higher than student rates in all school
environments except high schools. The proportion of student to staff cases in Florida schools was
closest in the elementary setting (60% students – 40% staff) compared to the high school setting
(82% students – 18% staff).
Approximately 61% of all students in Florida returned to in-person instruction during the
report period, with 39% enrolled in virtual-learning programs or withdrawing from the district by
November 1, 2020. Most students (87%) in the state who attended in-person classes were
enrolled in districts with mandatory mask mandates, though the percent of students enrolled in
face-to-face instruction was highest among districts without mask mandates. The state-wide case
incidence rate in districts without mask mandates (12.7 per 1,000 students enrolled face-to-face
or hybrid) was 38% higher than those who attended in-person within districts that did have mask
mandates (9.2). However, the staff case rate in districts without mask mandates (29.2 per 1,000
on-campus employees) was nearly twice that of staff case rates in districts with mandatory mask
policies (14.8) (Table 2).
Case rates nearly tripled in the period October 3 – November 14 for students in Florida
compared to the period August 10 – October 37 (4.5 per 1,000 in high school and 2.3 per 1,000 in
elementary students to 12.5 and 7.4 per 1,000, respectively). Only two of Florida’s 67 counties
had school case rates lower than the community case rate (Monroe and Walton), while 19

counties had higher pediatric case rates overall compared to school case rates (Table 2). Seven
counties had more school cases reported than pediatric cases reported, which could be due to a
number of high school students being over the age of 18 and thus not counted in the pediatric
community rate, or do to the school reporting previous cases after-the-fact.

Discussion
Case incidence varies significantly between school grade levels and between students and
staff. Staff rates are higher than student rates in all school environments except high schools, and
staff benefit most by mandatory-mask mandates. The rate of cases within schools is highly
correlated with cases within a community, more than the size of the district by total enrollment.
Percent enrollment in face-to-face instruction is a secondary influencer of case incidence rates in
schools. In areas with higher pediatric community case rates compared to school case rates,
districts may be under-reporting school case totals for students, or “disqualifying” student cases
based on when a student tested and whether the case could be directly linked to the school
environment. More research is needed to further understand the wealth of data available
regarding COVID-19 incidence in Florida, and to develop proper mitigation strategies to
confront this unprecedented challenge.
