The COVID-19 pandemic currently in process differs from other infectious disease
calamities that have previously plagued humanity in the vast amount of information that is
produces each day, which includes daily estimates of the disease incidence and mortality
data. Apart from providing actionable information to public health authorities on the
trend of the pandemic, the daily incidence reflects the process of disease in a susceptible
population and thus reflects the pathogenesis of COVID-19, the public health response and
diagnosis and reporting. Both daily new cases and daily mortality data in the US exhibit
periodic oscillatory patterns. By analyzing NYC and LA testing data, we demonstrate that
this oscillation in the number of cases can be strongly explained by the daily variation in
testing. This seems to rule out alternative hypotheses such as increased infections on certain
days of the week as driving this oscillation. Similarly, we show that the apparent oscillation
in mortality in the US data is mostly an artifact of reporting, which disappears in datasets
that record death by episode date, such as the NYC and LA datasets. Periodic oscillations
in COVID-19 incidence and mortality data reflect testing and reporting practices and
contingencies. Thus, these contingencies should be considered first prior to suggesting
social or biological mechanisms.
Epidemic case incidence data provides raw information on the course and outcome of infectious
disease outbreaks. Such data informs on whether the epidemic is surging, ebbing or evolving into
an endemic. Trends in the case incidence data provide insight into the efficacy of medical and
behavioral interventions, such as vaccines and social distancing measures, respectively. In
addition, trends in case incidence data as a function of time reflect biological parameters of the
host-microbe interaction including prevalence of disease among infected individuals,
contagiousness of infection, diagnostic capacity and the size of the susceptible population. Since
the case incidence data must ultimately be gathered, compiled and analyzed, the numbers also
reflect the public health capacity and infrastructure available to track the course of the epidemic.
Consequently, the case incidence data is a number that reflects many variables ranging from
biological constraints of the host and pathogen entities to medical, diagnostic, public health and
social structures on the affected population.
Since case incidence data reflect the conglomerations of many different informational
components with variable contributions it is difficult to tease out their individual contributions
from trend curves. Given the complexity of how epidemic case incidence data emerges,
epidemiological modeling is a necessary and important tool for understanding how individual
variables contribute to this number. However, it is possible that higher order analysis of case
incidence data produces patterns that reflect the contribution of the individual contributory
components. For example, an analysis of case incidence data in Germany revealed an oscillatory
pattern that was attributed to weekly fluctuations in case reporting (1). Consequently, we
analyzed the trends COVID-19 case incidence data in the USA to see if we could discern
patterns that provided additional insight into the course of the epidemic.
Methods:
USA daily new case and death data was obtained from https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19data/blob/master/us.csv for 111 days, from January 21st until May 11th. In addition, data from

New York City was obtained from https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data, including total
daily tests as well as daily positive tests (Figure 1A,B), and deaths (Figure 2B). Similarly, LA
data was obtained from
http://dashboard.publichealth.lacounty.gov/covid19_surveillance_dashboard/. Initially, a power
spectrum analysis on the raw data was performed using MATLAB
(https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/rand.html) Fast Fourier Transform Analysis (2).
We then performed a 7-day rolling average on each time series in order to smooth the data, and
then divided the original time series by its smoothed version in order to obtain a normalized time
series which measures deviation from the smoothed data, thus capturing the short-term variations
in the data while controlling for the longer-term trend. We then performed regression and
correlation analyses on the normalized time series, comparing the normalized daily positive tests
to normalized daily total tests.
Results and Discussion
To quantify the observed oscillation in incidence and mortality, we performed a power spectrum
analysis of US cases, which revealed a clear period corresponding to every 6.8 days (Figure 1C).
A similar analysis of NYC cases revealed a major period of every 7.1 days, and minor periods of
every 3.6 and 2.4 days. The presence of clear gaps between peaks in the power spectrum
signifies periodic patterns as opposed to chaotic or stochastic signatures (3, 4). Mortality data in
the US also revealed a periodicity of 6.8 days (Figure 1D).
The periodicities of 6.8 and 7.1 days are very close to the length of a week, suggesting societal
rather than purely biological factors are at play. The more minor periodicities of 3.6 and 2.4
could potentially arise artificially due to their nature as approximately Â½ and 1/3 of a week. This
weekly periodicity could have more than one explanation. One trivial explanation is that it
represents an increase in cases related to diagnostic and reporting activity related to the tempo of
the week. For example, greater reporting of cases on some days of the week as backlogs are
cleared from weekend testing could produce an increases in reported cases that, repeated each
week, will create a recurring periodicity. To investigate the hypothesis that the oscillations in
incidence were simply a reflection of the testing done we focused on the NYC and LA datasets,
where testing and incidence data were available, and which also have the advantage of being
localized regions with high incidence. The number of tests in NYC has a clear valley on Sundays
and peaks on Wednesdays-Thursdays, and the number of reported positive follows. Indeed,
when both total tests and positive tests are normalized to a 7 day average, we observe a near
perfect correlation between the two (r = 0.94) (Figure 2A). Moreover, the two normalized time
series align almost perfectly as seen visually (Figure 2B) or by the fact that the line y=x fits the
scatter plot well (as seen in Figure 1D, it is close to the line of best fit). Data in LA yields
similar, though less strong, results, probably due to lower number of cases giving rise to more
noise (Figure 2C,D). This suggests that alternative potential explanations, such as increased
social activity on certain days of the week leading to a greater infection rate, are not significant
drivers of the observed oscillations.
Similarly, the oscillations in mortality data appear to be an artifact of reporting. We note an
important difference between the US data and the datasets of NYC and LA we have obtained:
while in the US dataset, case and death dates reflect reporting date, the NYC and LA data is
back-dated to the episode date. The NYC and LA datasets are therefore more reliable indicators

of mortality, and indeed we do not observe a weekly periodicity in NYC deaths. When
normalized to a 7-day moving average, the NYC and LA mortality data show some oscillation,
but with no clear periodicity (Figure 3C,D). Indeed, the power spectra of the normalized
mortality data do not yield clear peaks (Figure 3E,F), indicating a stochastic rather than periodic
signal.
Several studies have shown variations in medical care between weekdays and weekends. In this
regard, patients having procedures later in the week and in weekends had higher mortality than
those treated earlier in the week (5). Similarly, individuals admitted to hospitals during weekends
have higher mortality than those admitted during the week (6). However, such variations in
medical care do not appear to drive clear periodicity in NYC and LA mortality data.
Regardless of the above caveats, we considered the possibility of biological causes for oscillation
but were able to rule these out. The periodicity at 2.4 days observed in NYC incidence data is
very close to the time required between infection and capacity to spread the virus, which was
estimated to be 2.3 d (7), bringing up the question of whether this more minor periodicity reflects
any biological process. However, such a time delay is will not lead to periodicity in incidence
unless it is coupled with periodic bursts of increased interaction and infection, for example, as
may be caused by increased activity in the weekend. However, our above analysis of NYC data,
demonstrating a strong correlation with testing, ruled out increased infection rate as a significant
driver of oscillation, making it unlikely that the time delay of 2.3 days manifests in periodicity in
the data. Indeed, the strong correlation of incidence with testing data suggests that the periodicity
of 2.3 days does not reflect real periodicity in incidence. This reasoning led us away from any
biological explanation of the apparent periodicities.
In summary, we observed periodic weekly oscillations in the incidence and mortality data for
COVID-19. The oscillations in incidence data showed a very strong correlation to the day-today testing numbers implying that these were directly caused by variation in testing. Mortality
oscillations appear to reflect the weekly tempo of reporting, rather than true oscillations in
deaths. Hence, oscillations of incidence and mortality data could point to biasing practices in
case reporting which should be considered first prior to suggesting social or biological
mechanisms..
