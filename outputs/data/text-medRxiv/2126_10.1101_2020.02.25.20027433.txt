The COVID-19 outbreak originated at the end of 2019 from Wuhan [1, 2], a city in Hubei
province in central China. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there were
88,948 confirmed cases and 3,043 deaths from 65 countries as of March 2, 2020. In China,
the outbreak has effectively confined over 1 billion people to their apartments and homes
since the end of January 2020 and continues to disrupt healthcare, wellbeing, and the
economy. As the situation in China appears to be stabilizing, sharp increases in confirmed
cases are being reported in South Korea, Italy, Japan, and Iran.
Access to real-time data is essential to the public, scientists, and public health officials.
The interactive dashboard developed by Dong et al. [3] is a powerful tool to assess the current
situation. To provide direct access to real-time epidemiological data on this outbreak, we
developed an R package, nCov2019 [4]. This open-source software aggregates data from
four different sources. We retrieve the current numbers of confirmed cases and deaths in
geographical locations using API (application programming interface) calls to the Tencent
SARS-COV-2 website [5]. Updated several times a day, the Tencent website relies on
official data obtained from the Chinese provincial health agencies, China National Health
Commission (CNHC), the World Health Organization (WHO), and public health agencies in
other countries. More importantly, our R package offers access to three data sources with
detailed daily statistics from December 1, 2019, for 43 countries and more than 500 Chinese
cities. Our first source is obtained directly from CNHC, which is official historical statistics
for the 34 the Chinese provinces and special districts. The second source is from a nongovernmental organization Dingxiangyuan [6], which has been continuously aggregating
official data from provincial and city health agencies and the CNHC. The third source is a
public GitHub repository [7], which derives data from the literature [8] for December 1, 2019,
to January 10, 2020, after which it relies on the Chinese news aggregator Toutiao API. This
GitHub repository includes historical data for Chinese cities as well as 43 countries. All

As demonstrated in Suppl. Doc. 1, this new package also contains functionalities to
facilitate data visualization. For example, with one command, users can easily plot the
distribution of cases on the maps of the world, China, and even individual provinces (Figure
1). With historical data, we can incorporate temporal and spatial information to create an
animation to help us understand disease transmission and examine the spread of the COVID19 outbreak.
To enable users to access these datasets without coding, we also developed interactive
web apps in both English [9] and Chinese [10]. As demonstrated in Supp. Doc. 1, these apps
can also be run locally from Rstudio. Using these apps, users can gain insights by quickly
generating all 23 plots in Supp. Doc. 2 based on daily updated data. Complementing the
dashboard by Dong et al. [3], our web app enables users to select their regions of interest and
check both the historical and real-time data. Generated by the app on February 25, 2020,
Figure 2 shows that the total confirmed cases in the provinces outside Hubei are stabilizing,
following a similar trend. The extreme measures that the Chinese government took since
January 23 seem to be working.
Built with the RStudio Shiny framework, these apps contain a simple forecast module.
We first converted the log-transformed numbers of cases or deaths as a time-series data, then
used the exponential smoothing method (ets) in the R package forecast [11] with default
settings to forecast the total cases. On February 7, 2020, this simple model predicted that the
death toll would reach 2000 in ten days, a staggering number at the time that later
materialized, unfortunately. We also converted the raw number of cases as percent daily
changes and conducted a similar forecast. Interestingly, daily percent changes in both
confirmed cases and deaths in China are decreasing linearly except for a few outliers (see
Figure 16 and 18 in Supplementary Document 2).
Even though not all data sources are official statistics, this kind of detailed data offers a
unique opportunity to study this novel pathogen. The hundreds of cities could even be
considered as semi-independent outbreaks, as many of them are far from the epicenter and
effectively on lockdown from the end of January 2020. As shown in Figures 5 and 6 in Supp.
Doc. 2, the death rate, estimated by dividing current total deaths by total confirmed cases, in
Wuhan is 4.47%. Probably due to an overwhelmed healthcare system, this death rate is higher
than the average of 2.92% (95% confidence interval [2.35% - 3.38%]) observed in 22
Chinese cities with 200 or more confirmed cases. Cities in Hubei province have higher
fatality rates than cities in other regions (Figure 6 in Supp. Doc. 2). Internationally, the death
rate in Japan (2.50%) is close to that of Italy (2.60%), lower than the 3.67% observed in
China overall (Figure 17 in Supp. Doc. 2). The death rate in Iran is 9.63%, probably due to
underreported cases.
The rapid, exponential growth phase in China spans roughly from January 15 to February
15, 2020, when the number of confirmed cases skyrocketed 1670-fold from 41 to 68,500.
Such rapid growth is now evident in South Korea, Italy, and Iran (Figure 3). Other countries
with a smaller number of cases but showing a sharp upward trend include Germany, Spain,
and France. If not managed well, tens of thousands of cases in each of these and other
countries could be possible in weeks. Public health officials need to grasp the power of
exponential growth.
Currently, city-level historical data is only available for China. These data sources
occasionally change data formats, which requires us to monitoring the data sources. If the

APIs stopped providing data, the real-time data would not be updated. But the historical data
will remain accessible for researchers. We will maintain the web apps during this outbreak.
Our nCov2019 package reduces the barrier for researchers and public health officials in
obtaining comprehensive, up-to-date data on this ongoing outbreak. With this package,
epidemiologists and other scientists can directly access data from four sources, facilitating
mathematical modeling and forecasting of the COVID-19 outbreak. The interactive web apps
are accessible to the general public and could also be easily customized by researchers to
produce other dashboards or track other countries. We hope these analytics tools could be
useful in studying and managing this pathogen on a global scale.
