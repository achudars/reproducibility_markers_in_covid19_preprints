Abstract
Background:

Lopinavir/ritonavir,

lopinavir/ritonavir-interferon

(IFN)-β-1a

and

hydroxychloroquine efficacy for COVID-19 have been evaluated, but detailed evaluation is
lacking.
Objective: To determine the efficacy of lopinavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir-IFN-β-1a,
hydroxychloroquine or remdesivir for improving the clinical, virological outcomes in
COVID-19 inpatients.
Design: Open-label, randomized, adaptive, controlled trial.
Setting: Multi-center trial with patients from France.
Participants: 583 COVID-19 inpatients requiring oxygen and/or ventilatory support
Intervention: Standard of care (SoC, control), SoC plus lopinavir/ritonavir (400 mg lopinavir
and 100 mg ritonavir every 12h for 14 days), SoC plus lopinavir/ritonavir plus IFN-ß-1a (44

μg of subcutaneous IFN-ß-1a on days 1, 3, and 6), SoC plus hydroxychloroquine (400 mg
twice on day 1 then 400 mg once daily for 9 days) or SoC plus remdesivir (200 mg
intravenously on day 1 then 100 mg once-daily for hospitalization duration or 10 days).
Measurements: The primary outcome was the clinical status at day 15, measured by the
WHO 7-point ordinal scale. Secondary outcomes included SARS-CoV-2 quantification in
respiratory specimens and safety analyses.
Results: Adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) for the WHO 7-point ordinal scale were not in favor of
investigational treatments: lopinavir/ritonavir versus control, aOR 0.83, 95%CI, 0.55 to 1.26,

Ader, F et al. – Antiviral drugs in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 - the DisCoVeRy trial

Introduction
The new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-associated
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in China in December 2019, subsequently
causing a worldwide pandemic(1, 2).
While waiting for specific therapeutic treatments and/or vaccines against SARS-CoV-2,
efforts initially focused on repurposing drugs that have previously shown broad-spectrum
antiviral activity against other coronaviruses. Lopinavir/ritonavir, type I interferon (IFN),
hydroxychloroquine, and remdesivir were among the first investigational treatments to be
tested on the basis of their in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2(3-9). Activity of combined
anti-HIV agent lopinavir/ritonavir against novel coronaviruses occurs via inhibition of 3chymotrypsin-like protease-dependent proteolysis preventing cleavage into viral proteins(3,
4). Activity of hydroxychloroquine occurs via affecting early stage of viral replication through
increased endosomal pH resulting in inhibition of virus-endosome fusion(7-9). Activity of
type I IFN is mediated by the heightening of antiviral cellular immune defenses(10). In
addition, it was hypothesized that hydroxychloroquine and type I IFN may have intrinsic
immunomodulatory effects(10-12). Remdesivir is an adenosine analogue, which incorporates
into nascent viral RNA chains and results in pre-mature termination(13).
The DisCoVeRy trial is a phase 3 multicenter, open-label, randomized, adaptive, controlled
trial to evaluate the clinical and the virological efficacy, as well as the safety, of
lopinavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir plus IFN-β-1a, hydroxychloroquine, and remdesivir as
compared with standard of care in adults hospitalized for COVID-19 (14). The DisCoVeRy
trial is part of the international Solidarity trial consortium sponsored by the World Health
Organization (WHO). Interim results of the Solidarity trial were recently published. They
were restricted to the analysis of in-hospital mortality, need for mechanical ventilation and
time to hospital discharge. No treatment exhibited a significant effect on these critical

outcomes when compared to standard of care(15). The DisCoVeRy trial provides more
detailed data on safety and clinical and laboratory surrogates, in particular virological data.
We report here the results from the lopinavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir plus IFN-β-1a and
hydroxychloroquine arms, which were prematurely stopped. The remdesivir arm is continuing
and currently enrolling.
Methods
Trial design and oversight
DisCoVeRy is an open-label, adaptive, multicenter, randomized controlled trial which
evaluates the efficacy and safety of drugs in adults hospitalized for COVID-19.
Sponsored by the Institut national de la santé et de la recherche médicale (Inserm, France), the
trial

was

approved

by the

Ethics

Committee

(CPP

Ile-de-France-III,

approval

#20.03.06.51744). Written informed consent was obtained from all included participants or
their legal representative if they were not able to consent. The trial was conducted in
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and national laws and regulations and declared
on the clinicatrials.gov registry (NCT 04315948) and on the European Clinical Trials
Database (2020-000936-23). The present analysis is based on the protocol v7.0 of April, 5th
2020,(14) with two secondary outcomes added in protocol v9.0 of June, 29th 2020.
Participants
Eligible participants were adults (≥ 18-year old) hospitalized with a PCR-proven (< 72 hours)
SARS-CoV-2 infection and pulmonary rales or crackles with a peripheral oxygen saturation ≤
94%, or requirement of supplemental oxygen. Exclusion criteria included a contraindication
to any of the investigational treatment or their use within 29 days before randomization;
elevated liver enzyme > 5 times the upper limit, an estimated glomerular filtration rate below
30 mL/min, pregnancy or breast-feeding. Full inclusion and exclusion criteria are presented in
the Supplementary Appendix.

Interventions and randomization
Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio through computer-generated blocks
of various sizes and stratified by administrative region and severity of illness at enrolment
(moderate disease: hospitalized participants receiving low-flow supplemental oxygen or not
requiring oxygen ; severe disease: hospitalized participants requiring non-invasive ventilation
or high-flow oxygen devices, invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO). Randomization was
implemented in the electronic Case Report Form to ensure appropriate allocation
concealment. Investigational arms were standard of care (SoC, control), SoC plus
lopinavir/ritonavir (tablets or oral suspension in nasogastric tube of 400 mg lopinavir and 100
mg ritonavir administered every 12h for 14 days), SoC plus lopinavir/ritonavir plus IFN-ß-1a
(44 μg of subcutaneous IFN-ß-1a on days 1, 3, and 6), SoC plus hydroxychloroquine (200 mg
tablets adjusted to 400 mg twice on day 1 as a loading dose followed by 400 mg once daily
for 9 days)(16) or SoC plus remdesivir (200 mg intravenously on day 1 as a loading dose
followed by 100 mg once-daily for hospitalization duration or 10 days). Other supportive
treatments, such as glucocorticoids or immunomodulatory agents, were allowed in all arms.
Clinical and laboratory monitoring
Participants were assessed daily while hospitalized, and at days 3, 5, 8, 11, 15±2 and 29±3 if
they were withdrawn at these dates. Clinical data, concomitant medications, adverse events
(AEs) and measurements for blood cell counts, serum creatinine and liver aminotransferases
were collected. Nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and lower respiratory tract (LRT, i.e.
bronchoalveolar lavage, protected specimen brushing or bronchial aspiration) specimens were
collected for SARS-CoV-2 real-time (RT) PCR.
Outcomes measures
The primary outcome measure was the clinical status at day 15 as measured on the 7-point
ordinal scale of the WHO Master Protocol (v3.0, March 3, 2020): 1. Not hospitalized, no

limitation on activities; 2. Not hospitalized, limitation on activities; 3. Hospitalized, not
requiring supplemental oxygen; 4. Hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen; 5.
Hospitalized, on non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices; 6. Hospitalized, on
invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO; 7. Death.
Secondary efficacy outcome measures included the clinical status at day 29 and the time to an
improvement of 2 categories as measured on the 7-point ordinal scale or hospital discharge
until day 29, the time to National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) ≤2 or hospital discharge
until day 29, the time to hospital discharge until day 29, oxygenation- and ventilator-free days
until day 29, 29-day mortality. Normalized SARS-CoV-2 viral loads were qualitatively and
quantitatively assessed in respiratory tract specimens (see Supplementary Appendix).
Secondary safety outcomes included the cumulative incidence of any grade 3 or 4 AE (coded
using the medical dictionary for regulatory affairs, v23.0), or of any serious adverse event
(SAE, according to the Division of AIDS (DAIDS, Table for Grading the Severity of Adult
and Paediatric Adverse Events, v2.1, July 2017) and the proportion of patients with a
premature suspension or discontinuation for any reason of the investigational treatments.
Sample size calculation
Hypotheses for sample size calculation are presented in Supplementary Appendix.
Interim analyses
An independent data safety and monitoring board (DSMB) externally reviewed the trial data.
For efficacy and futility, the statistical analysis was performed on the primary outcome
measure, and was based on the Haybittle-Peto rule(17, 18). Consistently with its role of addon partner trial, DisCoVeRy periodically transferred data regarding three of its secondary
outcomes to the WHO Solidarity trial: in-hospital mortality, time to hospital discharge, time
to mechanical ventilation.

Ader, F et al. – Antiviral drugs in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 - the DisCoVeRy trial

On May 25th 2020, following a safety warning on hydroxychloroquine use(19), enrollment in
the hydroxychloroquine arm was suspended at the request of the French Agency of drug
Security (Agence Nationale de Sécurité du Médicament). On June 13th, based on the interim
analysis of the Solidarity data, the Solidarity and DisCoVeRy trial DSMBs recommended to
definitely stop the hydroxychloroquine arm due to futility. This decision was endorsed by the
DisCoVeRy steering committee on June 17th. The Solidarity DSMB advised to stop the
lopinavir/ritonavir arm due to futility on June, 23th. Thereafter, the DisCoVeRy DSMB further
advised to stop both the lopinavir/ritonavir-containing arms due to additional safety concern
on June, 25th. This decision was endorsed by the DisCoVeRy steering committee on June 27th
with subsequent interruption on June, 29th.
Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses compared each of the three stopped investigational treatment arms to the
control arm. Due to the slowdown of inclusions in the trial between May and July, a single
patient was included in the control arm between the hydroxychloroquine arm suspension and
the permanent discontinuation of the lopinavir/ritonavir-containing arms. For simplification
purpose, only one control group was constituted, which included participants from the control
arm included before June 29th. The intention-to-treat population included all randomized
participants for whom a valid consent form was obtained. The modified intention-to-treat
population included participants from the intention-to-treat population who received at least
one dose of the treatment allocated by randomization.
Efficacy analyses were performed on the intention-to-treat population; handling of missing
data is described in Supplementary Appendix. Safety analyses were performed on modified
intention-to-treat population. Analyses were stratified by baseline severity but not by region
of inclusion due to a low number of inclusions in some regions; all tests were two-sided with
a type-I error of 0.05.

Ader, F et al. – Antiviral drugs in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 - the DisCoVeRy trial

For the 7-point ordinal scale, data were analyzed using a proportional odds model. Time-toevent data were analyzed using a Cox proportional hazard model. An analysis of covariance
was performed for the comparison of oxygenation- and ventilator-free days between groups;
29-day mortality and the number of participants with detectable SARS-CoV-2 in the
respiratory tract specimens at each time point were analyzed using a Cochran-MantelHaenszel test. Log10 normalized SARS-CoV-2 load kinetics was analyzed using a mixedeffects linear model with test of treatment effect on slopes. For safety endpoints, nonprespecified statistical comparisons of the proportions of patients with any i) adverse event, ii)
grade 3 or 4 adverse event, or iii) serious adverse event between each investigational
treatment arm versus control were performed using the Fisher exact test.
Role of the funding source
The trial was funded by grants from Programme Hospitalier de Recherche Clinique (PHRC20-0351) (Ministry of Health), from the DIM One Health Île-de-France (R20117HD) and
from REACTing, a French multi-disciplinary collaborative network working on emerging
infectious diseases. The funding sources had no role in the analysis of the data nor in the
decision of publication.
Results
Patient’s characteristics at baseline
Between March, 22nd and June, 29th, 603 participants were randomized to one of the 4 arms
across 32 sites in France and Luxembourg and 583 were evaluable for analysis
(Supplementary Figure S1): control arm, n=148; lopinavir/ritonavir arm, n=145;
lopinavir/ritonavir plus IFN-ß-1a arm, n=145; hydroxychloroquine arm, n=145. Participants’
baseline characteristics are presented in the Table 1. The median age was 63 years (IQR, 54;
71) and participants were mostly male (n=418, 71.7%). The median time from symptom onset
to randomization was 9 days (IQR, 7; 12). The most frequent underlying conditions were

obesity (n=166, 28.7%), chronic cardiac disease (n=151, 26.0%) and diabetes mellitus
(n=128, 22.0%). At baseline, 211 (36.2%) participants presented a severe disease.
Concomitant treatments are presented in Supplementary Table 1. No notable imbalance
between groups was observed regarding concomitant anti-inflammatory drug used.
Primary endpoint
The distribution of the 7-point ordinal scale at day 15 is presented in the Figure 1 and Table 2.
There was no significant difference between any of the treatment arm and the control arm,
and adjusted OR (aOR) were not in favor of investigational treatments (i.e., below 1):
lopinavir/ritonavir versus control, aOR 0.83 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.55; 1.26,
P=0.39); lopinavir/ritonavir plus IFN-ß-1a vs. control, aOR 0.69 (95%CI 0.45; 1.04, P=0.08);
hydroxychloroquine vs. control, aOR 0.93 (95%CI 0.62; 1.41, P=0.75).
Secondary endpoints
The distribution of the 7-point ordinal scale at day 29 is presented in the Figure 1 and Table 2.
There was no significant difference between any of the treatment arm and the control arm.
The time to improvement of 2 categories of the 7-point ordinal scale or hospital discharge
within day 29 was significantly higher in both lopinavir/ritonavir-containing arms than in the
control arm. The time to NEWS ≤2 or hospital discharge within 29 days and time to hospital
discharge within day 29 were significantly higher in the lopinavir/ritonavir plus IFN-ß-1a arm
than in the control arm (Table 2). No other significant difference was observed for any other
secondary outcomes between treatment arms and the control arm (Table 2 and Supplementary
Figures S2-S4).
Virological endpoints
No significant difference in the proportion of participants with detectable log10 normalized
viral loads in NPS at each sampling time was demonstrated (Supplementary Table S2). The

proportion of participants having severe disease with detectable log10 normalized viral loads
in the LRT at each sampling time is presented in Supplementary Table S3.
The slope of decrease of the log10 normalized viral loads quantified in NPS over time was not
significantly affected by any of the investigational treatment (Figure 2, panel A).
Safety
A total of 579 participants were included in the safety analysis (control, n=148;
lopinavir/ritonavir, n=144; lopinavir/ritonavir plus IFN-β-1a, n=144; hydroxychloroquine,
n=143). Safety outcomes are presented in the Table 3. Among the 2399 reported AEs, 477
were graded 3 or 4 in 205 patients and mostly reported in the lopinavir/ritonavir arms (Table
3).

Consistently, 608 serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in 274 participants; 149
(24.5%) were considered to be related to the investigational drug according to investigator’s
judgment (accounting for 37 events in the lopinavir/ritonavir arm, 71 events in the
lopinavir/ritonavir plus IFN-β-1a arm, and 41 events in the hydroxychloroquine arm). A
significantly higher number of patients experienced at least one SAE in the
lopinavir/ritonavir-containing arms than in the control arm (76/144, 52.8% in the
lopinavir/ritonavir arm vs. 57/148, 38.5% in the control arm, p=0.02; 78/144, 54.2% in the
lopinavir/ritonavir plus IFN-ß-1a arm vs. 57/148, 38.5% in the control arm, p=0.01).
The most frequently reported SAEs were acute respiratory failure (n=65, 11%), acute kidney
injury (n=50, 8.2%), acute respiratory distress syndrome (n=47, 8%), arrhythmia (n=41, 7%),
pulmonary embolism (n=27, 5%), and sepsis including those related to super-infections
(n=21, 4%). Thirteen percent (n=76) of participants developed at least one kidney-related
SAE; 66 of them were critically ill ventilated patients associated with acute kidney injury or
acute renal failure, of whom 12 had acute renal failure at baseline. Among the 57 fatal SAEs,

23 were classified as having a pulmonary origin, and 34 as having a non-pulmonary origin.
Only 4 non-pulmonary-related deaths were linked to investigational treatments by the
investigators (lopinavir/ritonavir arm, n=1; lopinavir/ritonavir plus IFN-ß-1a arm, n=3).
Discussion
We report here the results of the DisCoVeRy clinical trial evaluating lopinavir/ritonavir with
or without IFN-ß-1a, or hydroxychloroquine in comparison with control for the treatment of
inpatients with COVID-19. As reported by the Solidarity interim analysis of critical
endpoints, we report that these investigational treatments failed to improve the clinical course
of COVID-19, nor to enhance SARS-CoV-2 clearance and were associated with more SAEs.
Several larger-scale randomized controlled trials conducted in hospitalized COVID-19
patients failed to demonstrate the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine either by addressing the
question through the improvement in the 7-point ordinal scale at 15 days(20) or through the
effect on 28-day mortality(21) as compared to SoC alone. Our results are in line with these
conclusions. We bring additional evidence that hydroxychloroquine does not accelerate
SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance, consistently with preclinical data in a macaque model(22).
Two randomized trials conducted in hospitalized COVID-19 patients found no difference
between the lopinavir/ritonavir and the SoC arms in terms of 28-day mortality or of
probability of progression to mechanical ventilation or death(23, 24). The hypothesis that
severe COVID-19 is associated with an impaired type I IFN response characterized by no or
low IFN production and activity supported testing IFN with lopinavir/ritonavir. In an openlabel randomized trial, the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir, IFN-β-1b and ribavirin was
superior to lopinavir/ritonavir in alleviating symptoms and shortening the duration of SARSCoV-2 shedding in mild-to-moderate COVID-19(25). Conversely, our data suggest longer
time to NEW2 improvement or hospital discharge in the lopinavir/ritonavir plus IFN-β-1a vs.
lopinavir/ritonavir arm as well as no virological effect (Supplementary Figure S3). In

addition, we observed a higher rate of SAEs in the lopinavir/ritonavir-containing arms.
Participants from the investigational arms experienced more acute kidney injury, although the
difference was not significant. In the first series of COVID-19, acute renal failure incidence
ranged from 3 to 25% among heterogeneous patients in terms of disease severity and
treatment management, although predominantly in critically ill patients(26, 27). COVID-19
has been associated with renal endotheliitis(28). Elevation of serum creatinine has been
associated with high levels of D-dimers (> 500 ng/mL)(29), which resonates with elevated
median D-dimer levels at baseline. As reported with HIV-infected patients, infection and
inflammation are associated with down-regulation of cytochrome P450(30, 31). Gregoire et al
reported that intense systemic inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection enables
important increase in lopinavir unbound plasma concentrations(32). Marzolini et al found that
lopinavir concentrations were significantly correlated with a CRP value above 75 mg/L(33),
most of our participants being above this value at baseline. Lê et al demonstrated that in

of

lopinavir/ritonavir elicited plasma exposure of lopinavir > 6-fold the upper usual expected
range(34), consistent with the fact that all kidney-related SAE occurred in critically ill
ventilated patients.
DisCoVeRy is an adaptive, randomized trial initiated in France and that has been now
extended to other European countries with the support of the European commission and the
task of becoming a pan-European platform trial for Emerging infectious Diseases treatment.
Furthermore, DisCoVeRy is an add-on trial to Solidarity and importantly contributes to
Solidarity data acquisition and early interruption of treatment arms for futility. In agreement
with Solidarity, our objective was to complement knowledge acquisition with granular safety
and virological data. The design and the philosophy of DisCoVeRy trial will be of even
greater importance when new investigational drugs will be evaluated, for which scarce safety

data might be available, unlike repurposed drugs. The trial has some limitations: it is not a
placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial due to the complexity of blinding treatments with
different mode of administration (intravenous, subcutaneous or oral) and the need to initiate
the trial very rapidly. DisCoVeRy did not target patients at the early phase of the disease nor
include arms testing anti-inflammatory agents that can be used as part of the standard of care
in any arm.
Conclusion
In patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, lopinavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir plus
IFN-β-1a and hydroxychloroquine were not associated with clinical improvement at day 15
and day 29, nor reduction in viral shedding, and generated substantial SAEs. These findings
do not support the use of these investigational treatments for patients hospitalized with
COVID-19.
