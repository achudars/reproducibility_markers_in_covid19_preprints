Abstract

36

COVID-19 patients develop hypolipidemia. However, it is unknown whether lipid levels have

37

improved in recovered patients. In this study, a 3–6 month follow-up study was performed to

38

examine serum levels of laboratory values in 107 discharged COVID-19 patients (mild = 59;

39

severe/critical = 48; diagnoses on admission). 61 patients had a revisit chest CT scan. A Wilcoxon

40

signed-rank test was used to analyze changes in laboratory values. LDL-c and HDL-c levels were

41

significantly higher at follow-up than at admission in severe/critical cases (p < 0.05). LDL-c levels

42

were significantly higher at follow-up than at admission in mild cases (p < 0.05). With adjustment

43

of the factor of traditional Chinese medicine, LDL-c and HDL-c levels were significantly improved

44

at follow-up than at admission in severe/critical cases (p < 0.05). Increases in HDL-c significantly

45

correlated with increases in numbers of white blood cells (p<0.001) and decreases in levels of C-

46

reactive protein (p < 0.05) during patients’ recovery. Residue lesions were observed in CT images

47

in 69% (42 of 61) of follow-up patients. We concluded that improvements of LDL-c, HDL-c and

48

incomplete absorption of lung lesions were observed at follow-up for recovered patients,

49

indicating that a long-term recovery process could be required.

1. Introduction

53

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has become a major threat to the global public

54

health system [1], is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2)

55

[2]. As of October 3, 2020, more than 34.7 million COVID-19 infections and 1 million deaths have

56

been reported in 188 countries and regions. China reported 90 thousands cases and 4,739 deaths

57

which were mainly from the original epicenter, Wuhan [3]. Scientists are just beginning to

58

understand the nature of the harm caused by this disease. The SARS-Cov-2 spike protein

59

mediates the entrance of the virus into host cells via surface angiotensin-converting enzyme 2

60

(ACE2) [4, 5]. Host protease transmembrane, serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) promotes SARS-

61

CoV-2 entry into target cells, which are thought to be host determinants for viral infection in the

62

initial stage [6]. COVID-19 patients may be asymptomatic or symptomatic. The time from

63

exposure to onset of symptoms is about 5.1 days [7]. Pathologically, almost every vital organ in

64

the body, including the lungs, heart, liver, kidneys, eyes, blood vessels, intestines, and brain, can

65

be injured by SARS-CoV-2, leading to devastating consequences [8]. Acute and diffuse lung

66

injuries cause increases in a series of serum cancer biomarkers in patients [9]. Damage to the

67

lungs can be long-term for some recovered patients; this has also been observed in surviving

68

severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients [10].

69

Patients with metabolic-associated preconditions are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 attack and are

70

likely to experience more pronounced symptoms [11]. One pathogenic cofactor associated with

71

hypertension, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disorders is hypercholesterolemia.

72

We and others have recently reported hypolipidemia in hospitalized COVID-19 patients [12-15].

73

An association between decreases in lipid levels and the severity of the symptoms in patients has

74

been revealed [12-14]. Furthermore, emerging evidence has shown that SARS-CoV-2 has a

75

direct impact on the downregulation of lipid-metabolism-related proteins and pathways, leading

76

to dyslipidemia [11, 16]. In addition, dyslipidemia associated with SARS-CoV-1 has also been

77

reported [17]. Altered lipid metabolism has been shown in recovered SARS-CoV-1 patients 12

78

years after infection [18]. These reports demonstrate that dyslipidemia is an important clinical

79

manifestation in patients with coronavirus-related diseases, perhaps reflecting one aspect of the

80

complicated evolving pathological progressions seen in patients. In this study, we performed a

81

follow-up investigation of lipid profiles and other laboratory values in COVID-19 patients from our

82

previously reported cohort [19]. We found that there were significant improvements of coagulation

83

and liver laboratory values , including D-dimer, antithrombin III (ATIII), fibrin degradation product

84

(FDP), fibrinogen (FIB), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and

85

gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) in patients at follow-up compared to time of admission.

86

However, partial recovery of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) levels and incomplete

87

absorption of lung lesions were observed at follow-up, indicating that a long-term recovery

88

process and the development of sequelae such as pulmonary fibrosis could be expected in some

89

patients.

91

Demographic and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients

92

A total of 107 COVID-19 cases were included in this follow-up study: 59 mild and 48 severe/critical

93

cases (based on patient diagnosis at time of admission). A CONSORT flow diagram is shown in

94

Figure. 1. The age for all patients was 65 (60, 70) (median (IQR)) years. The ages for patients in

95

the two subgroups were as follows: 65 (51, 69) for mild and 66 (62, 74) for severe/critical cases

96

(Table 1). The overall follow-up time was 100 (96, 116) days after discharge. The ratios for

97

comorbidities, days until follow-up, and gender disparity among patients in each category are

98

listed in Table 1. An insignificant percentage of patients in the subgroups (about 15%–18%) used

99

cholesterol-lowering drugs (Table 1).

Improvements of serum cholesterol levels in recovered COVID-19 patients

117

Our previous studies have shown that serum cholesterol levels at the time of admission were

118

significantly lower in COVID-19 patients than in normal subjects [12, 13]. In this follow-up study,

119

we compared patient lipid levels at 3–6 months after discharge to those at the time of admission.

120

Both LDL-c, HDL-c and TC were significantly higher at follow-up than at the time of admission in

121

severe / critical cases (Table 2). LDL-c and TC levels were significantly higher at follow-up than

122

at the time of admission in mild patients (Table 2). Surprisingly, 11% of patients (12 of 107)

123

showed a 15% or more decrease in LDL-c levels at follow-up as compared to the time of

124

admission; these patients included 4 mild and 8 severe/critical cases. In addition, 13% of patients

125

(14 of 107) showed a 15% or more decrease in HDL-c levels at follow-up as compared to the time

126

of admission; these patients included 5 mild and 9 severe/critical cases. There were two cases in

which both LDL-c and HDL-c levels were 15% or more reduced at follow-up as compared to the

Traditional Chinese medicine is practiced as a regular supplementary treatment to the standard

care of Western medicine in China. A substantial portion of patients in this cohort (34 out of 59 in

143

mild group and 17 out of 48 in severe/critical group) had taken either type of TCHMs at home

144

during the onset of their symptoms or / and after discharge. In both mild and severe/critical groups,

145

the median levels of LDL-c, HDL-c and non-HDL-c at admission were slightly but insignificantly

146

lower in non-TCHMs subgroup as compared with the TCHM subgroup using a Mann-Whitney U

147

test (table 3). TCHMs also did not cause any significant changes in the levels of LDL-c, HDL-c

148

and non-HDL-c at the time of follow-up in non-TCHM subgroup as compared with TCHM

149

subgroup (table 3, a Mann-Whitney U test). In the severe/critical group, however, LDL-c and HDL-

150

c levels in the non-TCHM subgroup were significantly elevated at the time of follow-up as

151

compared to admission, but not in the TCHM subgroup (Figure 2, table 3). Less patients in TCHM

152

subgroup took cholesterol-lowering drugs than those in non-TCHM subgroup (table 3).

those at the time of admission. Levels of numerous physiopathological markers showed

184

significant improvements in patients at follow-up as compared to the time of admission across all

201

diffuse and acute lung inflammations. In follow-up CT images, consolidations/nodules and small

3. Discussion

208

In this study, we performed a follow-up investigation of lipid profiles and other laboratory values

209

on 107 recovered COVID-19 patients at 3–6 months after discharge. Our data demonstrate that

210

levels of LDL-c and HDL-c increased significantly in severe/critical COVID-19 cases with or

211

without adjustment of the application of traditional Chinese medicine. Coagulation and liver

212

laboratory values, including D-dimer, ATIII, FDP, FIB, CRP, ALT, ALP, and GGT, decreased

213

significantly across all subgroups. Furthermore, incomplete absorption of lung lesions was

214

observed in CT images in most follow-up patients. These findings provide insight into the

215

pathological evolution of COVID-19 during recovery and into potential long-term sequelae of the

216

disease.

217

Recently, we and other investigators have reported hypolipidemia in hospitalized COVID-19

218

patients [12-15]. The decrease in lipid levels in patients with COVID-19 is associated with the

219

severity of the symptoms [12-14]. These findings demonstrate that abnormalities in lipid

220

metabolism are clinical manifestations of COVID-19 that have been underappreciated. Mild or

221

moderate liver injuries caused by viral infection may be one important factor contributing to

222

dyslipidemia in COVID-19 patients. Serum levels of ALT, ALP, and GGT were moderately

223

elevated in about half of the cohort of patients in our study at the time of admission, indicating

224

mild or moderate liver injury [13]. In this study, patient ALT, ALP, and GGT levels were significantly

225

lower at follow-up than at the time of admission, indicating improvements in liver enzyme levels

226

in patients during recovery. There are a couple of potential mechanisms involved in the role of

227

cholesterol in the pathological progression of COVID-19. Wang et al. suggests that cholesterol

228

concomitantly traffics ACE2 to viral entry sites, where SARS-CoV-2 docks in order to properly

229

exploit entry into cells [20]. Therefore, decreased cholesterol levels in the blood may indicate

230

severe loading of cholesterol in peripheral tissue and escalated SARS-CoV-2 infectivity.[20] Cao

231

et al. suggests that cholesterol may facilitate an acceleration of endothelial injuries caused by

232

SARS-CoV-2 [21]. Sorokin suggests that lowering HDL-c in COVID-19 patients may decrease the

233

anti-inflammatory and antioxidative functions of HDL-c and contribute to pulmonary inflammation

234

[15]. All of these hypotheses will lead to more and novel insights into the nature of this disease.

235

The dynamics of lipid levels in a small cohort of our longitudinal study and in two cases in other

236

reports have shown that cholesterol levels were low at the time the patients were hospitalized,

237

remained low during disease progression, and returned to baseline levels in patients who were

238

discharged [12, 14, 15]. To our surprise, a small portion of patients (12% to 14%) showed a

239

decrease in LDL-c or HDL-c levels of 15% or more at follow-up as compared to the time of

240

admission. The low lipid levels in these patients were probably due to medications or nutritional

241

supplements taken during their own recovery process at home, for example, profound and acute

242

dietary changes. It would be interesting to find out whether those patients with lower LDL-c or

243

HDL-c levels at follow-up were from socioeconomically underrepresented populations. Although

244

it is less likely, there could be a long-term sequela of lipid abnormality caused by or associated

245

with viral infection in COVID-19 patients; there is no evidence to support the notion that SARS-

246

CoV-2 causes long-term chronic infection.

247

Emerging evidence has supported coagulation as an independent mortality factor in COVID-19

248

patients. Coagulopathies have been found in the early stages of the disease [22-24] and in

249

nonsurviving patients [25]. Patients have shown elevated coagulation and cardiac biomarkers

250

such as D-dimer, fibrinogen, high-sensitivity troponin I and creatinine kinase–myocardial band [26,

251

27]. In our follow-up study, coagulation laboratory values, including D-dimer, ATIII, FDP, and FIB,

252

were significantly lower in patients at follow-up as compared to the time of admission across all

253

subgroups, indicating improvements from coagulopathies. However, we did not find significant

254

correlations between the restoration of LDL-c or HDL-c levels and decreases in levels of these

255

coagulation values; this suggests that recovery from dyslipidemia and improvements from

256

coagulopathies are probably involving different pathways at different paces.

257

Incomplete resolution of lung lesions was observed in 69% patients in the follow-up CT

258

examinations, suggesting pulmonary fibrosis as a potential long-term sequela for many COVID-

259

19 patients. SARS patients have shown persistent impairment of lung function, even years after

260

discharge [28, 29]. Pulmonary fibrosis, GGO, and pleural thickening have been reported in follow-

261

up chest radiographs in a substantial portion of patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome

262

coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [30]. Consistent with our findings, You et al. showed that 83.3% of

263

COVID-19 patients had residual CT abnormalities, including GGO and pulmonary fibrosis [31].

264

These data suggest that aberrant wound healing in COVID-19 survivors, which is evidenced by

265

GGO and residue lesion patterns, may lead to pulmonary fibrosis; larger studies are needed to

266

verify this notion.

267

There were several limitations of this study. First, less than one-fifth of the patients from our

268

original cohort participated in this study, which might cause a biased representative sample group

269

from the original cohort. Second, the sample size for follow-up critical cases was limited; this might

270

lead to an overall insignificant increase in levels of LDL-c in this subgroup. Third, many patients

271

might have been taking various medications or remedies at home for recovery, including Chinese

272

traditional medicines or nutritional supplements. In this study, we found that about 58% of patients

273

in mild group and 37% of patients in severe group had taken TCHMs during their illness or / and

274

recovery courses. Our data indicated that TCHMs might have a negative impact on the
15

275

improvement of lipid profiles in patients with severe symptoms. However, due to the complexity

276

of ingredients in those TCHMs, it will be very difficult to determine which factor(s) and how they

277

interfere with lipid metabolisms in some patients’ recoveries in the severe group; this will need a

278

thorough investigation in future. We, however, did not find so far that TCHMs caused any

279

significant changes in the overall lipid profiles at the time of admission and follow-up crossing all

280

the subgroups. Therefore, TCHMs might have a minor effect on lipid values in our patient which

281

resulted in a negligible impact on the conclusions we drew in this study. We are aware that these

282

data and analyses only apply to this specific Chinese population. Fourth, the lipid profiles of

283

patients prior to discharge were crucial to determine the contributive factors to the decreased

284

LDL-c or HDL-c levels in a small portion of patients at follow-up as compared to admission, which

285

were lacking. Fifth, a continuous long-term follow-up is needed in order to monitor the dynamics

286

of lipid profiles and CT abnormalities during the recovery process for a large cohort of COVID-19

287

patients in order to better predict potential sequelae, such as lung fibrosis; this will be our future

288

research goal. Lastly, the characteristics of lipoproteins in our cohort was unknown. We also did

289

not know the cellular cholesterol levels in COVID-19 in this study; such information could provide

290

us insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying dyslipidemia in COVID-19. Whether and

291

how cholesterol or lipoproteins participate regulation of SARS-CoV-2 entry of host cells and viral

292

production are yet to be determined, which will our primary goal in future investigations.

293

Collectively, our data show improvements of LDL-c and HDL-c and incomplete absorption of

294

lung lesions in COVID-19 patients at a 3–6-month follow-up, indicating a long-term recovery

295

process and the development of potential sequelae such as pulmonary fibrosis.

This follow-up study was carried out at the Cancer Center at the Union Hospital of Tongji Medical

299

College in Wuhan, P. R. China, and was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at the

300

Union Hospital. The requirement for written informed consent was waived by the IRB committee.

301

Our previous study included a cohort of 597 COVID-19 patients admitted to the hospital between

302

February 1 and March 3, 2020 [13]. On June 6-10 and August 17-20, 2020, we attempted phone

303

inquiries to all patients in this cohort; we successfully reached 260 patients and received informed

304

consents over the phone from 144 of them to take follow-up laboratory tests. Ultimately, a total of

305

97 patients participated the follow-up study on June 15, 22, or 29, 2020 and 10 patients

306

participated the follow-up study on September 3, 2020. In order to compare laboratory values at

307

admission with those at follow-up, the patients were grouped into the same categories assigned

308

to them in the original study, which were based on their diagnoses on admission,[13] that is, mild

309

(n = 59) and severe/critical (n = 48) cases. Briefly, clinical diagnostic criteria and guideline were

310

as the follows: (1) mild group, patients with onset of symptoms including fever, cough, fatigue,

311

headache, diarrhea, and so forth, with or without mild pneumonia; (2) severe group, patients

312

showed dyspnea, acute respiratory stress, decrease in blood oxygen saturation, lung infiltrates,

313

multiple peripheral ground-glass opacities on both lungs; and (3) critical group, patients presented

314

respiratory or multiple organ failure and septic shock [13]. A revisit CT scan was performed on a

315

total of 61 patients as their standard cares of follow-up examination which was covered by their

316

health insurance providers. A CONSORT flow diagram is shown in Fig. 1.

317

Many patients were prescribed traditional Chinese herbal medications (TCHM) by their local

318

healthcare workers as a standard supplementary treatment of COVID-19 in Wuhan. Two typical

319

TCHMs were widely given to patients with mild symptoms or at the onset of symptoms or/and

320

after discharge from hospitals for one or two weeks according to Chinese Center for Disease

321

Control (CDC) guidelines. The herbal ingredients for the first TCHM were as follows: bupleurum

322

chinense, astragalus, coix lacryma-jobi, atractylodes lancea, ophiopogon japonicus, glehnia

323

littoralis, licorice, honeysuckle, bombyx batryticatus, periostracum cicada, rhubarb, and Curcuma

325

macrocephala, divaricate saposhniovia root, cyrtomium fortunei, honeysuckle, eupatorium fortune,

326

and Chenpi. In order to adjust the factor of THCM for a further analysis, we categorized patients

327

into non-TCHM or TCHM subgroup to assess the potential effect of these THCMs on patients’

328

lipid profiles.

329

Clinical laboratory tests and CT image acquisition

330

White blood cell (WBC), lymphocyte (LY), and monocyte (MO) counts were performed on a

331

Beckman LH750 analyzer using the manufacturer’s reagents (Beckman Coulter, Brea, California,

332

USA). A Beckman AU5800 chemistry analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) was used for

333

tests for the following laboratory values: ALT, ALP, GGT, LDL-c, high-density lipoprotein

334

cholesterol (HDL-c), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), total protein (TP), albumin (ALB),

335

globulin (GLB), total bilirubin (TBIL), direct bilirubin (DBIL), and total bile acid (TBA). LDL-c, HDL-

336

c, and TC were determined with standard homogeneous assays from Beckman Coulter (Catalog

337

Nos. OSR6283, OSR6587, and OSR6616). D-dimer, ATIII, FDP, and FIB were tested on a Stago

338

STAR analyzer using the manufacturer’s reagents (Stago, Parsippany, New Jersey, USA). C-

339

reactive protein (CRP) was determined using a BC-5390 analyzer (Mindray, Shenzhen,

340

Guangzhou, P. R. China). The clinical laboratory data included in this study were from blood

341

samples drawn fasting on the morning of the day of follow-up, a standard time and procedure of

342

blood drawn for laboratory tests in our hospital including blood sample collections at admission in

343

our previous study.[13] Electronic data from the time of the patients’ hospitalization, including

344

demographic information, clinical symptoms and diagnosis, laboratory tests, and treatment data,

345

were also extracted for comparison.

346

CT scanners (GE LightSpeed 16, GE VCT LightSpeed 64 from GE Healthcare, Chicago, Illinois,
