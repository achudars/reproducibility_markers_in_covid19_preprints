Abstract
BACKGROUND:
The World Health Organization declared the outbreak of coronavirus disease to be a public health
emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020. The first SARS-CoV-2 infection was
subsequently detected in Luxembourg on February 29, 2020. Representative population-based
data, including asymptomatic individuals for assessing the viral spread and immune response
was, however, lacking worldwide.
METHODS:
Using a panel-based method, we recruited a representative sample of the Luxembourgish
population based on age, gender and residency for testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection and antibody
status in order to define prevalence irrespective of clinical symptoms. Participants were contacted
via email to fill an online questionnaire before biosampling at local laboratories. Participants
provided information related to clinical symptoms, epidemiology, socioeconomic and
psychological assessments and underwent biosampling, rRT-PCR testing and serology for
SARS-CoV-2.
RESULTS:
A total of 1862 individuals were included for our representative sample of the general
Luxembourgish population. We detected an ongoing SARS-CoV-2 infection based on rRT-PCR
in 5 participants. h Four of the SARS-CoV-2 infected participants were oligosymptomatic and one
was asymptomatic. Overall, 35 participants (1.97%) had developed a positive IgG response, of
whom 11 self-reported to have previously received a positive rRT-PCR diagnosis of SARS-CoV2 infection. Our data indicate a prevalence of 0.3% for active SARS-CoV-2 infection in the
Luxembourgish population between 18 and 79 years of age.
CONCLUSIONS:
Luxembourgish residents show a low rate of acute infections after 7 weeks of confinement and
present with an antibody profile indicative of a more recent immune response to SARS-CoV-2. All
infected individuals were oligo- or asymptomatic. Bi-weekly follow-up visits over the next 2 months
will inform about the viral spread by oligo- and asymptomatic carriers and the individual changes
in the immune profile.

Introduction
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing outbreak of
coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a pandemic (World Health Organization (WHO), 2020b). The
pathogen responsible for COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2), was first described in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China (Huang et al., 2020). By May 6,
2020, the illness had rapidly spread to over 210 countries, affecting over 3 million people and
claiming more than 200,000 lives worldwide (World Health Organization (WHO), 2020a).
The first SARS-CoV-2 infection in Luxembourg was detected on February 29, in a person who
had just returned from Italy. Luxembourg is a country with 626,000 inhabitants in the heart of
Europe and has borders with Belgium, France, and Germany (Statec; 2020). It is highly connected
to its neighbors, with more than 200,000 cross-border employees commuting to Luxembourg. On
March 12, the government communicated measures taken to tackle the spread of the
Coronavirus. These measures entered into force on March 16. As in many other countries, all
educational institutions were closed, employees were encouraged to work from home whenever
possible, all non-essential activities were cancelled or closed, including all commercial and
business activities involving direct contact with customers (except essential products and
services). Travel was restricted for the general public (with limited exceptions such as helping and
caring for elderly or disabled people, or travelling to work, and border controls were implemented).
By May 6, 50533 individuals had been tested, with 3851 individuals tested positive for SARSCoV-2 and the disease accounted for 98 deaths in Luxembourg so far (Government of the Grand
Duchy of Luxembourg, 2020: https://msan.gouvernement.lu/en/dossiers/2020/corona-virus.html).
In addition to the direct effects of the pandemic, the confinement and quarantine measures linked
to the coronavirus pandemic also have a substantial socio-economic and psychological impact.
Besides initiating a global recession, psychological counselling services opened worldwide and
will soon demonstrate the psychological cost of the pandemic. Further analyses over time will
provide insights into the expansion of the socio-economic and psychological impact of the
coronavirus pandemic.
First studies currently aim at better understanding the dynamics of the pandemic and to improve
measures to confine the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the absence of effective medication or of
vaccines (Gudbjartsson et al., 2020). Here the role of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-positive
individuals for the propagation becomes more and more important (Streeck et al., 2020; Lai et al.,
2020; Bai et al., 2020). Systematic screening of a representative population irrespective of clinical
symptoms may detect asymptomatic persons who are expected to play an important role in the
disease transmission and inform about the overall infection rate in a population. We used reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) to identify asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic
carriers of SARS-CoV-2 and serology-based testing to identify participants that had developed an
immune response. In addition, questionnaires on clinical symptoms, epidemiological, and

socioeconomic factors were used to better understand the nature, dynamics of spread, and
transmission along with the prevalence of the virus in the population.

Materials and Methods
Study design
This study is a nation-wide, observational study aiming to define the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2
infections in the Luxembourgish population. Here we present the baseline assessment of the
CON-VINCE cohort. To capture the dynamics and impact of the virus spreading over time, the
cohort will be follow-up over 12 months. An intensive data and sample collection will be performed
every 2 weeks for the first 2 months (5 times in total) with a final follow-up 1 year after the
participants’ inclusion in the study. At each collection time-point, blood, nasal and oropharyngeal
swabs are collected, and participants also fill in questionnaires on epidemiological and clinical
data as well as socioeconomic and psychological well-being. The provision of a stool sample at
each biosampling time point is optional for all participants. To allow for data harmonization and
international collaboration the overall data set includes questions recommended by the
International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC), hosted by
the Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health at the University of Oxford (WHO), and the
Weizmann Institute (Rossman et al., 2020) adapted to the Luxembourgish environment (BörschSupan et al., 2013; Börsch-Supran, 2019).
The study design (Figure 1) accounts for the need to recruit a representative sample of the
Luxembourgish population (>18 years old) within a short time frame in the context of the already
existing confinement measures. All participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by rRT-PCR.
Additionally, serological testing for virus-specific antibodies (IgA and IgG against SARS-CoV-2)
was performed. Participants who were either asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic, from the clinical
point of view, are being followed up longitudinally regardless of the SARS-CoV-2 positive or
negative status. Symptomatic individuals positive for SARS-CoV-2 with COVID-19 disease
contribute to the baseline assessment but are not followed-up.
The baseline questionnaire captured demographic data, medical history and behavioral and
psychological data. Demographic data included age, gender, origin, residential areas as well as
marital status, number of children, the household composition, and the age of the household
members. As socio-economic-status is intimately linked to the incidence and severity of
respiratory tract infections, we obtained information on educational level, professional
background, current employment status, income, and the house-ownership.

Subjects provided information on their medical history, including cardiac, hepatic, metabolic,
pulmonary, neurological, hematological and oncological comorbidities, and gynecological history.
Prior history of allergies and smoking were recorded. A self-reported description of chronic
medication taken regularly was mandatory. COVID-19-related data included whether the
participants have already been tested for the SARS-CoV-2, indicating the date and the result of
the test. Additionally, we invited subjects to document if they had travelled to an area with
confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections during the 14 days prior to their participation in the study.
Environmental conditions of the household were obtained (e.g., the possibility of quarantine of
one household member, etc.).
To assess psychological and behavioural factors or changes during the pandemic, we asked
participants to quantify physical activity, the frequency of leaving the house, alcohol consumption,
screen time, as well as social contact through technological devices. Their compliance with the
recommendations and restrictions issued by the Luxembourgish government during the pandemic
was measured by a series of questions compiled from the WHO and Luxembourg Health
Directorate guidelines (WHO 2014, Luxembourg Health Directorate, 2020). Depressive
symptoms are and further will be assessed in the multiple follow-up questionnaires using the
Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D Scale) (Radloff, 1977). Presence and
severity of anxiety is measured in the multiple follow-up questionnaires using the seven items
Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD-7) (Spitzer et al., 2006). Participants’ perception
of their psychosocial stress level was assessed using the 4-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-4)
on a 5-point Likert scale (Cohen et al., 1983). Social isolation and loneliness were assessed with
the 3-item UCLA Loneliness Scale (short version) (Hughes et al., 2004). The Brief Resilience
Scale (BRS) (Smith et al., 2008) measures resilience or the ability to recover from a stressful
period or event using 6 items, scored on a 5-point Likert scale. Five personality traits
(Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Emotional Stability and Openness) are
assessed using the Big Five Inventory-10 (BFI-10) (Rammstedt and John, 2007).
The bi-weekly follow-up questionnaires will cover participants’ present health and psychological
status. Current health status will focus on signs and symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2
during the intervening period and medication (e.g., paracetamol, cough medicine, NSAIDs) for
symptom relief. Psychological data that will be collected during the follow-up questionnaires
include CES-D, GAD-7, PSS-4 and UCLA loneliness scale. BRS and BFI-10 are administered
again during the yearly follow-up. As social adversity has been linked to respiratory tract infections
(Elwenspoek et al., 2017) the final questionnaire includes the 28-item Childhood Trauma
Questionnaire (Bernstein et al., 2003), to retrospectively assess distress during childhood
together with a questionnaire covering the principal psychosocial stressors in adulthood such as
divorce, job loss or the death of a family member (Turner at al., 2020). The questionnaires, as
well as the questionnaire schedule, are included in Supplementary Material 1.
The study was approved by the national research ethics committee (Comité National d’Ethique
de Recherche, CNER), under reference 202004/01, and by the Luxembourgish Ministry of Health
under reference 831x6ce0d. The study has been submitted for registration on ClinicalTrials.gov
(NCT04379297).

Population screening
The CON-VINCE study was launched on April 15, and participants randomly selected from a
representative panel, which consented to the study and fulfilled the inclusion criteria, were
enrolled from April 15 until May 5, 2020. Participants filled the online questionnaire and
accomplished biosampling in approved diagnostic laboratories spread all over the country.
Participants vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection were sampled at home. A total of 1862
participants successfully completed the questionnaire and were biosampled.

Sample size calculation
Given the rapidly evolving incidence of infected cases on April 10, when the study protocol of
CON-VINCE was established and based on an unknown number of asymptomatic people, a
prevalence of 50% of cases was assumed, that would lead to the largest sample size. It would
allow estimating any other prevalence figure.
Assuming a 95% confidence interval and a precision of 2.5% around the estimate of prevalence,
the required sample size was a minimum of 1537 participants. The chosen sampling strategy for
the sample to be representative of the general population was to stratify by gender, age categories
(10 years from 18 years and above), and electoral districts. To compensate for non-response and
potential drop-outs during the study, over 2000 individuals were invited to join the study.

Sampling
According to the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies of the Grand Duchy of
Luxembourg (Statec), the national population aged 18 years and over was 514,921 at the
beginning of the study. This constituted the sampling frame.
An equal allocation probability was used (chance for all individuals of the same age category and
gender to be selected) proportional to size (of the population) without replacement (the same
individual could not be selected twice). The selection probability for unit i (for example 60-69y) in
stratum h (for example men) equaled nhZhi, where nh was the sample size for stratum h, and Zhi
was the relative size of unit i in stratum h. The relative size equaled Mhi/Mh, which was the ratio
of the size measure for unit i in stratum h (Mhi = number of men aged 65-69y) to the total of all
size measures for stratum h (Mh = number of men) (SAS Institute Inc, 2009).
Due to constraints related to the emerging pandemic, the sample of participants was enrolled
through the use of a non-probabilistic web panel (unknown probability to opt-in) of 18,000
members by a survey company to access participants within the sampling plan. A deterministic
random bit generator (DRBG) within strata was used to apply the equal allocation probability
proportional to size.

Acquisition and Preparation of Samples
The first round of biosampling was performed from April 16 onwards at routine medical diagnostic
laboratories (BioneXt, Ketterthill and Laboratoires Réunis) throughout Luxembourg using
standardised study collection kits containing all the required materials provided by the Integrated
Biobank of Luxembourg (IBBL). Collection kits included the mandatory blood samples and nose
and throat swabs, as well as an optional stool collection kit (Supplementary Table 1). Following
collection, blood, nose and throat swabs were maintained at 2-8°C and transported within 24h to
the IBBL for processing. Participants collected stool samples at home and sent them in provided
transport boxes to the IBBL using the regular postal service. Blood and stool samples were
processed in the IBBL. Swab samples were transferred to the Laboratoire National de la Santé
(LNS) for rRT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 testing (Supplementary Table 1). Serum was transferred at 20℃ to the Department of Infection and Immunity of the Luxembourg Institute of Health (LIH) for
serology testing. Leftover swab samples and residual RNA from swab samples were returned to
IBBL for aliquoting and storage, within 24h following the initial transfer to LNS. The sampling
procedure will be maintained for the follow-up visits.

Data Integration, Storage and Access
As part of our Case Report Forms (CRFs) (Supplementary Material 1) was based on ISARIC
COVID19 Core CRF (https://isaric.tghn.org/COVID-19-CRF/), our data is aligned with
international standards and can be easily harmonized and pooled with other studies facilitating
cross-study analysis. Encrypted pseudonymised raw data has been deposited in the Luxembourg
Centre for Systems Biomedicine (LCSB) secure repository. Upon arrival, all pseudonymised
questionnaire and clinical data is curated and mapped to associated rRT-PCR and serology data
through each participant’s pseudonymised ID with corresponding sample kit ID (subject-samplemapping) and maintained in REDCap (www.project-redcap.org), personal information was
maintained separately in a proprietary secured server (SMASCH). REDCap provides a complete
audit trail for study data (https://www.project-redcap.org). This integrated, curated and processed
data is available through an access-controlled study-specific data integration and analysis
platform (ADA). The ELIXIR-Luxembourg node (ELIXIR-LU http://elixir-luxembourg.org) will
provide long-term hosting, ensuring the sustainability of CON-VINCE data. Data flows are
highlighted in Figure 2).

RT-PCR
Automated RNA extraction was performed using a STARMag 96 x 4 Universal Cartridge Kit
(Seegene) for all swabs. SARS-CoV-2 detection was carried out using the Allplex 2019 n-CoV
Assay (Seegene) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The Allplex 2019 n-CoV assay
amplifies specific regions in the RdRP, N genes (specific SARS-CoV-2 detection) and E gene

(pan-Sarbecovirus detection). Inconclusive results, i.e. samples where only the RdRP or the N
gene was amplified, a second manual RNA extraction using the QIAamp viral RNA minikit
(Qiagen, Venlo, the Netherlands) followed by duplicate RNA testing with in house assays
including the E gene rRT-PCR (Corman et al., 2020), N gene (N1 target) rRT-PCR and human
RNAse P rRT-PCR as sample quality control (CDC), using TaqPath 1-Step RT-qPCR Master Mix
(Life Technologies, Merelbeke, Belgium). Viral RNA from BetaCoV/Germany/BavPat1/2020 strain
(Ref 026N-03889), kindly provided by the Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin (Corman et al., 2020)
through the European Virus Archive Global platform, was used as positive control. Inconclusive
samples were also screened with the FTD SARS-CoV-2 assay (Fast Track Diagnostics, Eschsur-Alzette, Luxembourg), which detects N and ORF1ab genes of SARS-CoV-2. As outlined in
Figure 3, all samples that were only positive for N gene in the original rRT-PCR, were considered
positive when a Ct value < 40 was obtained for at least one replicate for 2 viral genes in 2 different
second-round rRT-PCRs on the same sample.

Serology
Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG were determined by CE-labelled enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) kits (most recent versions of Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgA and
Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and as
described by others (Streeck et al., 2020). The optical density (OD) was measured at 450 nm
from which background OD measured at 650 nm was deducted. OD ratios were calculated by
dividing the resulting OD by the OD of the calibrator, which is included in the kit. In house quality
controls, prepared to give an expected OD ratio of approximately three times the threshold for
positivity, were included in all assays. As per the kit recommendations, samples with OD ratios
<0.8 were considered negative, OD ratios ≥1.1 were considered positive and samples with
intermediate OD ratios (>0.8, <1.1) were judged borderline positive.
A cohort of anonymised archived sera collected from adults during the two winter seasons (cohort
A, 2018, n=92; 2019, n=93) prior to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic were tested by both IgA
and IgG ELISAs to assess their specificity. All sera had been collected for other purposes than
respiratory disease diagnosis. A second cohort of anonymized sera (cohort B, 2020, n=37) was
collected at the Centre Hospitalier de Luxembourg (CHL) from patients with documented COVID19 disease and positive rRT-PCR results. The delay between onset of symptoms and blood
drawing ranged from 1 to 26 days. Those sera contributed to evaluating the ELISA sensitivity. All
sera with intermediate results were considered positive when calculating specificity and
sensitivity.

Statistical analyses and data presentation
Prevalence of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA infection was measured by rRT-PCR. IgA and IgG serology
was also translated into seroprevalence. The infection rate was evaluated through previously
reported and current rRT-PCR and IgG positivity. Prevalence estimates were calculated by

accounting for the design of the study, namely weights from the sampling strategy as defined by
the stratification variables (gender, 10 years age categories and electoral district).
A representativeness evaluation was carried out to verify that the proportions estimated from the
sample can be extrapolated to the general population. 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were
given. Sampling proportions were calculated for each strata of the sample of participants enrolled
in the study as well as in the general population. The ratio of these proportions provided the
weights for post stratification.
In the sense of sensitivity analyses, sampling weights were also calculated for “cantons” which is
a more granular strata than electoral district.
The formula for infection rate was as follows: past or current positive PCR or IgG positive or
intermediate divided by the total sample population (N=1835).
Prevalences were calculated with SAS v9.4 (SAS institute, Cary, NC, USA) except the IR and IFR
where R was used with the svycipro function (Survey package) that calculates 95% confidence
intervals for proportions with logit » method. Figures were prepared in R studio (R Core Team,
2019) using the tidyverse (Wickham et al. 2019), ggbeeswarm (Clarke and Sherril-Mix, 2017) and
ggpubr (Kassambara, 2020) packages.

Results
Cohort description
The recruitment of Luxembourg residents for the CON-VINCE study started on April 15 and was
concluded on May 5 after the inclusion of 1862 individuals, thereby exceeding the minimum of
1537 participants calculated for assessing prevalence. All individuals that accomplished the
baseline questionnaire online underwent biosampling. Viral rRT-PCR was performed in 1842
participants and SARS-CoV-2 specific serology for IgA and IgG was performed in 1820
individuals.
The basic epidemiological features of the study participants, such as gender, age, education,
number of persons sharing the same household, and residency within the Luxembourg territory
are described in Table 1.

Sensitivity and specificity of SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG ELISAs
Two serum cohorts were used to assess the specificity and sensitivity of both IgA and IgG ELISAs.
In specificity cohort A, 20/185 (10.8%) and 4/185 (2.2%) sera reacted in IgA and IgG ELISAs
(positive and intermediate; Figure 4), leading to a specificity of 89.2% and 97.8% respectively.
Only one serum was IgA and IgG positive, providing an increased specificity of 99.5% when
combining both results.
Cohort B consisting of hospitalized COVID-19 patients was used to estimate assay sensitivity in
relation to the time delay after symptom onset (Table 2). IgA and IgG ELISA sensitivity reached
92.9% and 85.7% at 15 days (d15) after symptom onset, while the combination of IgA and IgG
results provided a sensitivity of 85.7% (Table 2).

Serological screening at baseline
The presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG was assessed in all sera using the CE-labeled
Euroimmun assays. Overall, 201/1820 (11.0%), and 35/1820 (1.9%) participants had IgA or IgG
antibody levels above the threshold considered for positivity in our study (OD ratio ≥0.8),
respectively. Among those, 30 (1.6%) participants were positive for both IgA and IgG (Table 3;
Figure 5). A positive correlation between IgA and IgG OD ratios was observed (all data,
Spearman correlation coefficient r=0.362, p<0.001; IgA positive and IgG positive only, r=0.855,
p<0.001).

rRT-PCR screening at study baseline
A total of 1842 upper respiratory tract swabs were analyzed by Allplex 2019 n-CoV Assay. Six
(0.3%) gave inconclusive results, i.e. a positive result was only detected by N gene rRT-PCR.
Low levels of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA, as shown by the high Ct values (Table 4), were confirmed
for 5/6 participants after retesting by additional rRT-PCRs (Figure 3). Despite the very low viral
RNA concentrations, the repeated viral RNA detection combined with the serological response
observed strongly suggested that these five participants had been infected with SARS-CoV-2.
Apparently, they were in the phase of clearing the viral infection and mounting an antibody
response. This is further evidenced for participant 3, who already tested positive 25 days prior to
study enrolment. All participants were oligo- or asymptomatic, 2 participants had contact with a
COVID-19 household member while one participant had traveled in the last 14 days (Table 6).

rRT-PCR screening prior to enrolment
A total of 138/1862 (7.4%) participants had been tested for SARS-CoV-2 by rRT-PCR prior to
study enrolment, and 11 of these 138 (8.0%) tested positive. All previously rRT-PCR positive

participants were IgA and IgG seropositive at the baseline time point of our study. Conversely,
16/126 (12.7%) and 5/126 (4.0%) previously rRT-PCR negative participants had tested positive
for IgA or IgG, respectively. During the period between the initial (March 16-April 3) and baseline
(April 15-April 29) testing (mean interval between tests: 26.9 days, range: 13-37 days), viral
clearance, shown by a negative rRT-PCR at baseline, occurred in 10/11 (90.9%), while a single
participant remained positive at baseline, 25 days after initial testing (see above).
Among all IgG positive participants (n=35), only one participant reported travelling within the
previous 14 days and three reported having contacts outside the household (confinement
measures were already in place since March 16, 2020). Seven participants were working on-site
while 13 were working from home. Thirteen (37.1%) participants reported having contact with
confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases, most of the time (11/13, 84.5%), this person being
household members (Table 6).
A wide range of clinical symptoms were reported for the last 14 days prior to enrolment by IgG
positive individuals. Symptoms ranged from none or very mild (≤2 symptoms in 19 participants)
to more substantial symptoms, including shortness of breath, chest and abdominal pain. The
number of symptoms reported tended to be higher in participants with a previous rRT-PCR
positive diagnostic (range 0-13, average 4.5) than in participants with no or a negative rRT-PCR
result (range 0-9, average 2.5; Table 6). The number of symptoms reported by participants with
comorbidities (n=9; average 2.3) tended to be lower than in participants with no reported
comorbidities (n=26; average 3.5).

Prevalence evaluation
For the prevalence evaluation, two out of 1842 participants with rRT-PCR results were excluded
because the gender was not defined. Participants aged > 79 years were also excluded (n=12)
because representativity for the overall population was not reached for this age group. The target
population for prevalence evaluation was therefore defined as people between age 18 years until
age 79 years. The number of individuals with rRT-PCR and serology results available was 1830
and 1807, respectively with 4 participants negative in serology with no PCR results.
The sampling frame was used to weight the number of individuals in each cell defined by the three
stratification variables. Weights were calculated by dividing each cell count from the target
population by the one from the sample. It was therefore used in post-stratification.
The evaluations of prevalence used the weights to extrapolate to the target population and
evaluate the 95% confidence intervals.
The time prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by rRT-PCR was 0.30% (95%CI=[0.03;0.56]) during
the period of April 16 until May 5. This result translates into 1449 (95%CI=[145;2754]) people in
the general population aged 18 years to 79 years.
Seroprevalence of IgA was 11.07% (95%CI=[9.54;12.60]) and that of IgG 2.09%
(95%CI=[1.37;2.82]). The Infection rate was 2.06% (95%CI=[1.34, 2.77]) (Table 7).

As a sensitivity analysis, weights were recalculated using Luxembourg’s regional cantons rather
than electoral districts, a more granular geographic representation. An electoral district is
composed of 2 to 5 cantons. Participants were randomly selected in the district, but as we also
obtained the canton information, it was relevant to have an estimate of how the prevalence could
be biased by potential clustering within districts.
Using the more granular canton approach, the time prevalence of SARS-CoV-2- rRT-PCR was
0.32% (95%CI=[0.02;0.63]) which was an estimate very close to that obtained at the district level.
A similar observation could be made for the other estimated prevalence (Supplementary Table
2).

Discussion
The present study provides first prevalence data on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the population
of Luxembourg using a panel-based approach. The weighted prevalence of SARS-CoV2 carriers
based on rRT-PCR reveals a low prevalence of 0.30%, which may be due to the confinement
measures in place for more than 7 weeks, including social distancing for the overall population
and self-isolation and quarantine. Our data suggest that between April 16 and May 5 there were
1,449 adults in Luxembourg that were oligo- or asymptomatic carriers of the SARS-CoV-2.
Similarly, low results from population screenings in Iceland were recently reported with 0.8%
virus-positive individuals in an open-invitation screening and 0.6% in a random-population
screening identified (Gudbjartsson et al., 2020). The relevance of assessing the contribution of
asymptomatic and oligosymptomatic individuals to the dynamics of the pandemic is increasingly
recognized and also motivated a study at the National Institute of Health (USA) using a similar
population-based approach where participants fill questionnaires during a virtual clinical visit and
are biosampled for assessing seropositivity (NCT04334954).
Of the five SARS-CoV-2 positive participants only one reported that he had travelled to a COVID19 risk area. Two positive participants reported prior contact with a COVID-19 diseased
household member. The source of infection for the other 2 SARS-CoV-2 positive participants is
not clear, but most probably within Luxembourg, as travels were limited given the confinement
measures in place.
For the presence of infected individuals within a household, we observed the highest percentage
in households with 2 members and the lowest percentage in households with 5 or more individuals
(Suppl. Fig. 1). This is in line with the observation in a recent German study that showed a
relatively moderate increase of the secondary infection risk dependent on the household cluster
size (Streeck et al., 2020).
Overall participants tested positive for an active infection of SARS-CoV-2 by rRT-PCR, were oligoor asymptomatic and presented with fewer symptoms (mean of 1.6 symptoms out of 22; SD=1.14)
than individuals with negative rRT-PCR results (mean of 2.3 symptoms out of 22; SD=2.43). This

underscores the relevance of infected individuals that do not display typical COVID-19 signs and
symptoms for the viral spread during the pandemic.
In line with previous reports, we see males overrepresented in the group of SARS-CoV-2 positive
participants (4 males versus 1 female) (Gudbjartsson et al., 2020; Guan et al., 2020). As we
targeted a population >18 years old, we cannot make any direct statement on the contribution of
children to the viral spread.
All of the data was collected through online questionnaires. In highly connected countries such
as Luxembourg, approximately 97% of the population accesses and regularly uses the internet
(International Telecommunications Union, 2019). Previously, self-reported online questionnaires
have been shown to be a reliable method of accessing the clinical evolution of disease (Davies
2016), and the lack of face-to-face interaction, flexibility to complete the questionnaires at the
participants’ convenience, together with the perceived degree of anonymity inherent in such
online questionnaires is thought to enhance data accuracy, reducing central coherence and social
desirability biases at the cost of participants potentially misinterpreting the questions (Ong and
Weis, 2000) .
Retrospective assessment was limited to events and symptoms occurring in the previous two
weeks to reduce recall bias. The rapidity with which such a self-reporting system that was
accessible throughout the population was rolled out was crucially important in the pandemic
situation. This rapidity means that reliable data can be provided promptly to researchers during
the ongoing pandemic. Furthermore, in such an unpredictable, rapidly changing pandemic
situation follow-up questionnaires can be modified as quickly as ethical approval can be obtained.
The advantages were, however, counterbalanced by the possibility of survey fatigue with five
survey waves in quick succession.
The geographical location of Luxembourg and the nature of the study required that several
compromises were made. Luxembourg is highly multilingual and successfully recruiting a
representative cohort required that study participants were offered the choice of questionnaires
in French, German, English and Portuguese. The problems associated with translating
questionnaires are well known (Pan and Fond 2014), and to circumvent this, we restricted the
study to questionnaires that had previously been experimentally validated in all languages. As we
aimed to detect asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers the ISARIC case report form was adapted
to participants that had limited or no symptoms and the Luxembourgish sociodemographic
situation.
There are pros and cons of using web panels for surveys. We used the services of a private
company for immediate access to potential participants from all over the country and based on
prior knowledge on age, gender and residency. The sample of participants to the current study
was enrolled through the use of a non-probabilistic web panel (unknown probability to opt-in) of
18,000 panel members. Registration to the panel was constituted via invitation during telephone
or face to face interviews as well as ad banners, media campaigns and homepage of the
company. The sample was randomly drawn from the panel for each stratum defined by the
crossing of the 3 stratification variables through a deterministic random bit generator (DRBG)

within strata. Individuals living across the borders were excluded as we aimed at a sample of
Luxembourgish residents.
The advantages of using such a panel was the simplification of the logistics to implement the
study in a short time frame in order to capture the prevalence of the infection (Figure 6) while the
decreasing slope of the epidemics has already started. Another aspect to consider is that no
hospitalised patient was included in our sample as they were not reachable through the panel.
However, online surveys may be biased samples because the respondents are self-selected
whereby individuals who have strong opinions, are overrepresented, and individuals that are
indifferent or apathetic are less likely to opt-in or respond. Nevertheless, we tried to correct the
selection bias and under representation by first stratifying the sampling on gender, age and
residency at the sampling level and second, by post stratification at the analyses level.
Overall, our study captured 6 rRT-PCR positive participants with low viral RNA levels. These may
be considered negative in other studies depending on the criteria applied. The combination of
retesting by additional rRT-PCRs (Figure 3) as well as assessment of IgA and IgG serology,
however, strongly suggest that 5 of these 6 study participants were true SARS-CoV-2 positive
cases with residual low viral loads and seroconversion. This is also further evidenced by one of
the participants who already tested positive 25 days prior to enrolment (participant 3, see Table
4). Duration of SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding appears to vary widely between patients. Detection of
viral RNA for 2-3 weeks after symptom onset is frequent (Kujawski et al., 2020; Wölfel et al.,
2020), even in seroconverted patients, and extended viral shedding for up to 83 days was reported
(Li et al., 2020). One of the study participants (participant 5, Table 4) was not confirmed positive
after two confirmation rRT-PCR assays and did not show seroconversion until now. This patient
might have been recruited at the onset of viral shedding in contrast to the other cases and/or may
not mount an immune response as sometimes observed in asymptomatic patients. Longitudinal
follow-up sampling as implemented in the design of our study will allow us to clarify the status of
this participant at a later stage.
The frequency of seasonal hCoV infections in the general population, including adults (Monto et
al., 2020), coupled with possible concomitant infections by different hCoV (Heimdal et al., 2019)
suggest a limited duration of protection for each hCoV and limited cross-protection between
hCoV. Nevertheless, cross-reactivity in ELISA due to past exposure to other hCoV likely partially
accounts for the observed lower specificity of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA ELISA used in our study.
Notably, cross-reactivity in anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG ELISAs has been documented in
patients with specific seroconversion against hCoV-OC43, while baseline sera were negative
(Okba et al., 2020). In Germany, the follow up of a birth cohort revealed that 19/25 (76.0%)
newborns had seroconverted by 21 months of age (Dijkman et al., 2012). While the frequency of
each of the four seasonal hCoV oscillates between years and regions, hCoV-OC43 (betaCoV) is
usually more frequent, in patients with acute respiratory disease, especially compared to hCoV229E (alphaCoV) (Dijkman et al., 2012; Heimdal et al., 2019; Monto et al., 2020). Aside from a
lower assay specificity, discrepancies between IgA and IgG responses may also arise from
sequential immune response. IgA tends to appear earlier than IgG after symptom onset (Guo et
al., 2020), and may explain why some participants have detectable levels of IgA but no IgG.

In this study, intermediate IgA and IgG antibody levels were assimilated to a positive serological
response, as done previously (Streeck et al., 2020). Although this approach decreases specificity,
the current study design allows for a careful monitoring of seroconversion trends and antibody
levels over time during subsequent biosampling of study participants, which will allow us a better
interpretation of evolving antibody responses. Additional immunoassays including alternative
antigens or antigen fragments as well as neutralization assays will complement the panel of tests
that will be performed at a later stage of the CON-VINCE study. These additional immunoprofiling
data will provide a more refined assessment and evaluation of the ELISA assay results obtained
at baseline level of our study.

Outlook
The longitudinal design of our study with bi-weekly follow-ups will allow us to assess the dynamics
of the pandemic in our study population along with the gradual easing of the protective measures
taking place in Luxembourg as well as other European countries. This may inform about the
impact of oligo- and asymptomatic carriers on the viral spread during the upcoming months.
Moreover, we will be able to study immune responses via continuous serological testing and may
provide information on the risk of re-infections, as knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 immunity is still
limited.

final follow-up will take place after one year.

Figure 2: Data and sample flow in CON-VINCE cohort. Study participants are recruited
by a survey company (TNS-Ilres) based on a large representative panel of residents of
Luxembourg. Participant personal data is securely collected and can only be accessed
by the clinical study team. Each participant's personal record is assigned with a
pseudonym. All data is collected by a protected web-based interface and transferred
along with the pseudonym to the Data and Computing Platform hosted at the LCSB in a
secure data center. Biosamples are collected at different sample collection hubs across
Luxembourg and shipped to IBBL for sample processing and biobanking. Biosamples
are analysed at the Laboratoire National de Santé (LNS) and the Luxembourg Institute
of Health (LIH) and the analysis results together with biosample annotations and
barcodes are recorded in REDCap. Within the Data and Computing Platform, the
pseudonymized data and results from biological analyses from REDCap is accessed by
the Data Integration and Analysis Platform (Ada) via an Application Programming
Interface and integrated results with clinical data made available through its secure and
access-controlled web-application.

EXCLUSION CRITERIA

Infection by Coronavirus with severe disease course requiring a hospital admission prior to the inclusion to the
study.
□ Yes
□ No
Presence of fever and respiratory distress/cough at the time of inclusion not attributable to other known chronic
disease.
□ Yes
□ No
Explanatory note for participant: The virus called SARS-CoV-2 (further indicated as Coronavirus) is the cause
of the current pandemic disease known as COVID-19. It is a rapidly spreading virus affecting mainly the
respiratory tract having up to 80% an asymptomatic course (meaning without any symptoms) or very mild upperrespiratory disease with runny nose or pink eye. However, in a fraction of patients, the disease evolves to fever
and cough with or without respiratory distress and in some cases, a hospitalisation with therapy by inhaled
oxygen and further medical support is needed.
