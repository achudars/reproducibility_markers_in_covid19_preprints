variations in the immune response to primary SARS-CoV-2 infections and a

potential vaccine can lead to dramatically different immunity landscapes and

Introduction

14

The current Covid-19 pandemic caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 betacoronavirus ( –CoV)

15

has resulted in substantial morbidity and mortality, with over ten million confirmed cases world-

16

wide at the time of writing. In order to curb viral transmission, non-pharmaceutical interven-

17

tions (NPIs) including business and school closures, restrictions on movement, and total lock-

18

downs have been implemented to various degrees around the world. Major efforts to develop

19

effective vaccines and antivirals are ongoing.

20

21

Understanding the future trajectory of this disease requires knowledge of the population-

22

level landscape of immunity generated by the life histories of SARS-CoV-2 infection or vac-

23

cination among individual hosts, particularly in the context of the acquisition, re-transmission,

24

and clinical severity of secondary infections. The nature of acquired immune responses fol-

25

lowing natural infection varies substantially among pathogens. At one end of this immune

26

spectrum, natural infection with measles (1) or smallpox (2) virus results in lifelong protec-

27

tion from the re-acquisition and re-transmission of secondary infections. Many other infections

28

(e.g. influenza (3), RSV (4)) confer imperfect or transient clinical and transmission-blocking

immunity. Finally, phenomena such as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) associated

30

with prior natural infection (e.g. dengue (5)) or a vaccine (e.g. RSV (6)) could result in more

31

clinically severe secondary infections. Furthermore, the immunity conferred by vaccines to var-

32

ious pathogens rarely provides complete protection against reinfection and/or disease (9), and

33

this protection may be inferior to that acquired following natural infection (10). Nevertheless,

34

imperfect vaccines that reduce both the clinical severity and transmissibility of subsequent in-

35

fections (if they do occur) can still provide population-level disease protection (9, 11).

36

37

In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the nature of the immune response following natural infection

38

remains uncertain, although efforts to measure the kinetic adaptive immune response are on-

39

going (12–16). One approach for bounding estimates for this immune response is to examine

40

related viruses that also belong to the –CoV genus. This genus comprises other viruses that

41

cause severe infections in humans including the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)

42

and SARS-CoV-1 coronaviruses (7) as well as the seasonal coronaviruses HCoV-HKU1 and

43

HCoV-OC43, which are the second leading causes of the common cold (7). While immunity to

44

SARS-CoV-1 is believed to last up to 2-3 years (17, 18), serum antibody levels against HCoV-

45

OC43 have been found to wane on the time-scale of a few months (19) to one year (20) likely

46

due in part to a combination of antigenic evolution and low antigenic dose. HCoV-HKU1 and

47

HCoV-OC43 are thought to cause repeated infections throughout life (21), though a significant

48

biennial component in their dynamics implies at least some herd protection (7, 8). Furthermore,

49

although it is currently unclear whether ADE influences the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, it has

50

been hypothesized that severe Covid-19 cases may arise from the presence of non-neutralizing

51

antibodies from prior coronavirus infections (22) following earlier proposals for related coron-

52

aviruses (23–25). For example, one study found that a subset of reinfections with three endemic

53

human coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43) showed enhanced viral

replication during the secondary infection (26). In addition to antibody-mediated immunity, T

55

cell immunity increasingly appears to be an important component of the adaptive immune re-

56

sponse to SARS-CoV-2; also there is evidence of T cell cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2

57

and these seasonal, endemic coronaviruses (15, 16).

58

59

Various epidemiological models have been developed to capture this type of variation in im-

60

mune responses on population-level infection dynamics. For instance, the well-known Susceptible-

61

Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model is suitable for modeling the dynamics of perfectly-immunizing

62

infections such as measles (27), while the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Susceptible (SIRS)

63

model captures the epidemiology of imperfectly immunizing infections such as influenza, in

64

which individuals eventually return to a fully or substantially susceptible class following a finite

65

period of immunity either due to waning memory or pathogen evolution (28). More complex

66

compartmental models have also been developed to study infections characterized by interme-

67

diate immune responses lying between these two extremes such as rotavirus (29) and respiratory

68

syncytial virus (4).

70

Here we adopt a generalization of these more nuanced models, the SIR(S) model (28) out-

71

72

unfold for different assumptions regarding the nature of the adaptive immune response to SARS-

73

CoV-2 infection. Since different adaptive immune responses may be associated with variations

74

in the proportion of severe secondary cases, we also consider different scenarios for this fraction

75

in order to estimate the future clinical burden of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The model assumes

76

different infection and immune phenotypes depending on exposure history (see Methods for the

77

full mathematical details). Specifically, it interpolates between the fully immunizing SIR model

78

when immunity is lifelong and the imperfectly immunizing SIRS model through the degree of

79

susceptibility to and transmissibility of secondary infections (quantified by the parameters ✏ and

80

↵, respectively). As shown in the representative time series of Figure 1, the SIR model results in

81

recurrent epidemics fueled by births following the pandemic peak, while the SIRS model results

82

in shorter inter-epidemic periods due to the possibility of reinfection and the buffering of the

83

fully susceptible birth cohort by partially immune individuals (28). We begin by characterizing

84

the effect of temporal changes in the transmission rate brought about by climate and the adop-

85

tion of NPIs on the predictions of the SIR(S) model under a range of immunity assumptions.

86

Next, we examine the effect of a transmission-reducing vaccine of varying efficacy relative to

87

natural immunity, thus altering the relative compositions of the various immune classes. Fi-

88

nally, we estimate the post-pandemic immunity landscape and clinical case burden for different

89

possible ‘futures’ shaped by the various aspects of SARS-CoV-2 biology as well as the presence

90

or absence of these external drivers and interventions.

Results and Discussion

In practice, during the early stages of a pandemic, reductions in transmission are nearly entirely

achieved through the adoption of NPIs such as mask-wearing or social distancing. To explore

96

the effect of the adoption of NPIs, we considered two different scenarios for timed reductions

97

in the force of infection to 60% of its original value (in agreement with intermediate levels of

98

social distancing in (7)). In Figures 2a - 2c, we plot the time series of primary and secondary

99

infections assuming NYC climate-driven seasonality in transmission as well as single periods of

100

NPI adoption lasting from weeks 16 to 67 (Figure 2a) or 16 to 55 (Figure 2b), and two shorter

101

periods during weeks 16 to 55 and weeks 82 to 93 separated by normal interactions (Figure

102

2c). The weekly reproduction numbers corresponding to these three scenarios are plotted in

103

Figures S2d-S2f. Although these reproduction numbers are based on those obtained for the re-

104

lated -CoV HCoV-HKU1 and are in general lower than those estimated during the early stages

105

of the Covid-19 pandemic (30), they may be more appropriate for considering the longer-term

106

transmission dynamics, and our results are qualitatively robust to increasing these values for R0

107

(results not shown).

108

109

We find that decreases in the susceptibility to secondary infection ✏ can delay secondary

110

peaks (compare individual time courses for different values of ✏ in Figures 2a–2c). However,

111

delayed peaks may then be larger, due to susceptible accumulation and dynamical resonance.

112

These non-monotonicities in the timing and size of secondary peaks also occur with climate-

113

driven seasonal transmission in the absence of NPIs (see Supplementary Materials, Section

114

S3.3). Importantly, the delay that social distancing may cause in the timing of the secondary

115

peak can also allow for the accumulation of fully susceptible individuals. This is illustrated in

the top panels of Figure 2d, where the full ( SP , red curve) and partial (✏ SS , green curve)

secondary (dashed lines) infections with a seasonal transmission rate derived from the climate

122

to secondary infection (✏ < 1) considered in the left panels results in a greater number of pri-

123

mary infections during the second peak relative to the panels on the right where ✏ = 1.

124

125

Finally, an essential part of the planning and management of future SARS-CoV-2 infections

126

is the ability to characterize the magnitude and timing of severe cases requiring hospitaliza-

127

tion. In Figure 2e we consider four different plausible scenarios for the fraction of severe

128

secondary cases xsev,s (see Methods) based on the scenario depicted in Figure 2c and assum-

129

ing 14% of primary cases are severe (31): no severe cases associated with secondary infection

130

(xsev,s = 0, solid red line), a reduced number of severe cases with secondary infection rela-

131

tive to primary infection (xsev,s = 0.07, dashed green line), comparable proportions of severe

132

cases (xsev,s = 0.14, dashed-dotted blue line), and a greater proportion of severe cases with

133

secondary infection (xsev,s = 0.21, shortdashed-longdashed purple line), possibly owing to

134

phenomena such as ADE. When the assumed fraction of severe secondary infections is high,

135

the fraction of the population with severe infections during secondary peaks exceeds that ob-

136

served during the primary peak (Figure 2e). As the proportion of secondary infections increases

137

during the later stages of the pandemic, these findings stress that clinical epidemiological stud-

138

ies of repeat infections will be critical for proper planning of healthcare systems.

139

Vaccination

140

The availability of an effective vaccine would be a key intervention against SARS-CoV-2, and

141

numerous candidates are in development (32, 33). Intuitively, if the effective vaccination rate

142

is sufficiently high, then vaccination herd immunity generated by a transmission-blocking vac-

143

cine could control or eliminate the infection. However, this becomes harder to achieve when

144

vaccinal and natural immunity is imperfect and secondary infections occur, or when logistical

145

or other constraints limit vaccine deployment. Although it remains uncertain whether and when

146

a vaccine will be available, we make the relatively optimistic assumption that a transmission-

147

reducing vaccine begins to be introduced at tvax = 1.5 years. We also consider seasonal

148

transmission rates as in Figure S3 and the adoption of NPIs according to the scenario described

149

in Figure 2b. We assume that a constant proportion ⌫ ranging from 0%  ⌫  1% of the fully

150

and partially susceptible populations (SP and SS ) is effectively vaccinated every week and ac-

151

quire transmission-blocking immunity for, on average, a period 1/ vax . For comparison, it was

152

estimated that in response to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, one or more doses of the monovalent

153

vaccine were administered to 80.8 million vaccinees during October 2009 to May 2010 in the

154

United States (34), which implies a rate of vaccination coverage of about 27% after a period

155

of 8 months for persons aged at least 6 months in the USA, although rates between different

156

nations varied (35). This crudely corresponds to a weekly vaccination rate of 1% (36). Finally,

157

we assume that the immunity conferred from effective vaccination wanes at rate vax which in

158

general may differ from the waning rate of immunity from natural infection, . The modified

160

S11a is presented in the Methods.

161

162

In Figure 3a we consider the long-term equilibrium infection burden (see Methods) fol-

163

lowing vaccination at a weekly rate ⌫ for a variety of immunity assumptions. As expected, a

164

reduction in the susceptibility to secondary infections (✏) results in a smaller number of infec-

165

tions at steady state in the absence of vaccination. Further, both ✏ and the duration of vaccine

166

immunity (1/ vax ) affect the vaccination rate required to achieve a disease-free state at equi-

167

librium. In the limit of fully immunizing primary infections and vaccines (✏ = 0), relatively

168

low vaccination rates are required to achieve zero infections at steady state. However, as im-

169

munity becomes more imperfect (larger ✏), increasingly high vaccination rates are required to

170

eliminate infections particularly when the duration of vaccine immunity is short. This is further

171

emphasized in Figure 3b, where the minimum vaccination rate ⌫ required to achieve a disease-

172

free state at equilibrium (see Methods) is plotted as a function of ✏ for different values of the

173

duration of vaccine immunity. Altogether, this illustrates that reductions in infection achievable

174

through vaccination are inherently related to the efficacy of the vaccine and the nature of the

175

adaptive immune response (37).

176

177

We next explore the short-term dynamical effect of vaccination in Figures 3c-3f. In Figure

178

S11b, the ratio of the total number of primary infections during years 1.5-5 inclusive (i.e. after

179

the vaccine is introduced) relative to the zero vaccination case for different values of the vac-

180

cination rate ⌫ and the duration of vaccine immunity 1/ vax is shown. Figure S11c shows the

181

equivalent for secondary infections. The burden of primary infections decreases with increas-

182

ing vaccination rate for a given value of vaccine immunity 1/ vax . However, for the shortest

183

durations of vaccine immunity 1/ vax , the degree of achievable reductions in the number of

184

secondary cases begins to saturate even for large vaccination rates. This saturation is due to the

seasonal NYC-based weekly reproduction numbers (R0 = 1.75, see Methods and Figure S2c).
(c)-(f): Time series of the various immune classes plotted for different values of the vaccination

susceptible (solid lines), immune (dashed lines), and partially immune (dotted lines) subpopulations. The duration of vaccine immunity is taken to be 1/ vax = 0.5 years (shorter than
natural immunity) in (c) and (d), and 1/ vax = 1 year (equal to natural immunity) in (e) and
(f). The susceptibility to secondary infection, relative transmissibility of secondary infections,
and duration of natural immunity are taken to be ✏ = 0.7, ↵ = 1, and 1/ = 1 year, respectively.
Vaccination is introduced 1.5 years after the onset of the epidemic following a 40 week period
of social distancing during which the force of infection was reduced to 60% of its original value
during weeks 16 to 55 (i.e. the scenario described in Figure 2b of the main text), and a seasonal
transmission rate derived from the climate of NYC with no lag is assumed.

ure 4a illustrating a more pessimistic scenario of greater susceptibility to secondary infections

201

(✏ = 0.7), a relatively short period of natural immunity (1/ = 0.5 years), and a greater pro-

202

portion of severe cases with secondary infection possibly owing to phenomena such as ADE. In

203

contrast, the more optimistic future of Figure 4b assumes reduced susceptibility to secondary

204

infections (✏ = 0.5), a longer duration of natural immunity (1/ = 2 years), and a smaller

205

proportion of severe cases with secondary infection. In both cases, the initial pandemic wave

206

is the same, but in the more optimistic scenario (Figure 4b), natural immunity is longer lasting

207

and consequently subsequent infection peaks are delayed. Furthermore, the reduction in sus-

208

ceptibility to secondary infection (smaller ✏) in Figure 4b suppresses the later peaks dominated

209

by secondary infections (Figure 4a) and substantially less depletion of fully susceptible indi-

210

viduals occurs. In Figures 4c and 4d, these pessimistic and optimistic scenarios are translated

211

into futures with vaccination, which is assumed to be introduced at a weekly rate of ⌫ = 1% at

212

tvax = 1.5 years. The future described in Figure 4c assumes all the same outcomes as in Fig-

213

ure 4a and incorporates vaccination with short-lived vaccine immunity (1/ vax = 0.25 years).

214

The future presented in Figure 4d assumes all the same outcomes as in Figure 4b in addition to

215

vaccine immunity lasting 1/ vax = 1 year.

216

217

Figures 4c and 4d emphasize the important role that even an imperfect vaccine could have

218

in SARS-CoV-2 dynamics and control (9, 11). With vaccination, subsequent peaks in clinically

219

severe cases are substantially reduced, although in the pessimistic future later infection peaks

220

dominated by secondary infections can still occur (Figure 4c). Furthermore, if a transmission-

221

blocking vaccine confers a relatively long period of protection, and if we make optimistic as-

222

sumptions regarding the nature of the adaptive immune response (Figure 4d), a sufficient pro-

223

portion of fully susceptible individuals can be immunized, thus suppressing future outbreaks.

224

These trends are qualitatively conserved for different vaccine deployment strategies, such as a

225

pulse of immunization at tvax = 1.5 years in which a fixed percentage of the fully and par-

226

tially susceptible populations (SP and SS ) are vaccinated (see Figure S12). However, without

227

sustained immunization strategies, the waning of vaccine immunity results in less susceptible

228

depletion over time, and larger future outbreaks relative to the scenarios presented in Figures

229

4c and 4d. Overall, Figure 4 suggests that relying on the status of infection of an individual

230

as the main observable during an ongoing epidemic is insufficient to characterize the complex

231

immune landscape that is generated. Given the increasingly recognized importance of both T

232

cell- (15, 16) and antibody-mediated (12–14) adaptive immune responses in the recovery from

233

SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is very likely that more sophisticated methods including regular test-

234

ing of serology and T cell immunity will be required (38).

235

236

Conclusion

237

We have examined how plausible variations in the natural immune response following SARS-

238

CoV-2 infection as well as various external drivers and interventions may shape the longer-term

239

clinical burden and immunity landscape to this disease. Here we summarize the key findings

240

and complexities illustrated by this simple model along with caveats for their interpretation; a

241

full summary of all caveats and future directions is given in Section S2.

242

243

In locations where we expect substantial climatically-driven seasonal variation in transmis-

244

sion, such as New York City, the model predicts that a reduction in susceptibility to secondary

245

infection or a longer duration of immunity may lead to a larger secondary infection peak, and

246

this peak may occur earlier when the duration of natural immunity is longer. In geographical

247

areas with smaller annual fluctuations in climate, we find that this non-monotonic behaviour

248

is increasingly suppressed, although these results are sensitive to the assumed form of climatic

249

influences on SARS-CoV-2 transmission, which we have taken here to be very similar to those

250

of the related –CoV HCoV-HKU1. Indeed, even with the incorporation of NPIs (which in

251

general may be adopted differently than the scenarios considered here), the clinical burden of

252

subsequent infection peaks is sensitive to the relative fraction of primary and secondary cases as

253

well as the fraction of severe cases for each category, which intimately depend on the nature of

254

the adaptive immune response. In turn, the severity of an infection could affect the nature of the

255

subsequent adaptive immune response through antigen priming or T cell exhaustion. Finally,

256

the disease dynamics predicted by the model can be substantially altered using a highly simpli-

257

fied scenario for the introduction of a vaccine, although the achievable reductions in infections

258

are strongly dependent on the efficacy of the vaccine and the nature of the adaptive immune

259

response. Nevertheless, even with imperfect vaccine immunity, reductions in the number of

260

primary cases through vaccination may have important clinical implications.

261

262

Altogether, this work emphasizes the complex dependence of the immune landscape gener-

263

ated by SARS-CoV-2 infection on the presently largely unknown nature of the adaptive immune

264

response to this virus and the efficacy of potential future vaccines. Depending on how these un-

265

fold, the model predictions for future clinical burdens range from sustained epidemics to near

266

case elimination. Consequently, accurately characterizing the nature of immunity to SARS-

267

CoV-2 will be critical for the management and control of future infections.

to decrease exponentially in time as U (t) = exp( ⌫t). Consequently, in order to achieve
