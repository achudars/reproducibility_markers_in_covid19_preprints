Abstract
Background
The health impact of COVID-19 may differ in African settings as compared to countries in Europe or China
due to demographic, epidemiological, environmental and socio-economic factors. We evaluated strategies
to reduce SARS-CoV-2 burden in African countries, so as to support decisions that balance minimising
mortality, protecting health services and safeguarding livelihoods.

Methods
We used a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered mathematical model, stratified by age, to predict
the evolution of COVID-19 epidemics in three countries representing a range of age distributions in Africa
(from oldest to youngest average age: Mauritius, Nigeria and Niger), under various effectiveness
assumptions for combinations of different non-pharmaceutical interventions: self-isolation of symptomatic
people, physical distancing, and ‘shielding’ (physical isolation) of the high-risk population. We adapted
model parameters to better represent uncertainty about what might be expected in African populations, in
particular by shifting the distribution of severity risk towards younger ages and increasing the case-fatality
ratio.

Results
We predicted median clinical attack rates over the first 12 months of 17% (Niger) to 39% (Mauritius),
peaking at 2-4 months, if epidemics were unmitigated. Self-isolation while symptomatic had a maximum
impact of about 30% on reducing severe cases, while the impact of physical distancing varied widely
depending on percent contact reduction and R0. The effect of shielding high-risk people, e.g. by rehousing
them in physical isolation, was sensitive mainly to residual contact with low-risk people, and to a lesser
extent to contact among shielded individuals. Response strategies incorporating self-isolation of
symptomatic individuals, moderate physical distancing and high uptake of shielding reduced predicted
peak bed demand by 46% to 54% and mortality by 60% to 75%. Lockdowns delayed epidemics by about
3 months. Estimates were sensitive to differences in age-specific social mixing patterns, as published in
the literature.

Discussion
In African settings, as elsewhere, current evidence suggests large COVID-19 epidemics are expected.
However, African countries have fewer means to suppress transmission and manage cases. We found
that self-isolation of symptomatic persons and general physical distancing are unlikely to avert very large
epidemics, unless distancing takes the form of stringent lockdown measures. However, both interventions
help to mitigate the epidemic. Shielding of high-risk individuals can reduce health service demand and,
even more markedly, mortality if it features high uptake and low contact of shielded and unshielded people,
with no increase in contact among shielded people. Strategies combining self-isolation, moderate physical
distancing and shielding will probably achieve substantial reductions in mortality in African countries.
Temporary lockdowns, where socioeconomically acceptable, can help gain crucial time for planning and
expanding health service capacity.

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has not only led to increased mortality, but has also resulted in widespread
socio-economic disruption and is severely testing affected countries’ health service capacity1–3. However,
to date, its effects have mainly been observed in countries with relatively well-resourced health systems
and the financial means to support economies during ‘lock-down’ periods. At the time of writing, only two
African countries, Lesotho and Comoros, had not reported any confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections2. In
these and other low-income settings, two factors (younger age distributions and, potentially, warmer
temperatures4,5) may help to attenuate the pandemic’s severity. However, other factors may plausibly
combine to worsen its impact: these include demography (larger household sizes and more
intergenerational mixing within households), environmental conditions (overcrowded urban settlements,
inadequate water and sanitation), pre-existing disease burden (higher prevalence of undiagnosed or
unmanaged non-communicable diseases, tuberculosis and, if confirmed to be risk factors for COVID-19
severity, HIV and undernutrition), and, critically, a very low baseline of and access to hospitalisation
capacity, particularly intensive and sub-intensive care6–10. In several African countries, armed conflict, food
insecurity and resulting forced displacement further worsen societal resilience 11–16.
Options to manage COVID-19 in Africa may be limited. Sufficiently scaling up case management may
simply be unfeasible for many countries as the requirements, particularly at the epidemic’s peak, may be
many-fold greater than the baseline capacity. Even in scenarios where intense suppression measures are
successfully implemented, it is plausible that the availability of beds, clinicians, ventilators and personal
protective equipment would be critical limiting factors17,18. Suppressing the epidemic through ‘lock-down’
policies may delay transmission in the short-term, but their economic viability beyond a timeframe of weeks
is questionable unless large economic rescue packages are made available by global financing actors and
are concretely accessible to populations: indeed, lock-down measures and even less intense distancing
restrictions could exacerbate poverty and undernutrition, compromise educational attainment and undo
improvements in access to health interventions achieved over the past decades 19,20.
To help inform COVID-19 response strategies for African settings, we undertook a mathematical modelling
study. We explored the possible effect on hospitalisation requirements and mortality of interventions
considered to date in high-income settings, including self-isolation of symptomatic persons, general
distancing (reduction of overall contacts) outside the household and more intensive lock-down measures.
We also quantified the potential of an alternative option we refer to as ‘shielding’, whereby people at high
risk of COVID-19 severe disease are specifically protected through a variety of community-led
arrangements, such as neighbourhood-level house swaps, to create ‘green zones’ wherein high-risk
residents are physically isolated for an extended period, but supported to live safely and with dignity:
epidemiologically, this option seeks to reduce transmission within the high-risk groups that may otherwise
contribute a large amount of hospitalisation and mortality.

Methods
Model structure
We adapted a previously developed discrete-time Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR)
compartmental model, stratified by age group and disease status (asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, and
symptomatic)21. Detail is provided in the Supplementary Material. In brief, the model progresses a
population through time based on assumed age-dependent contact of susceptible with infectious
individuals. After their infectious period, all individuals are assumed to be immune until the end of the
simulation (Recovered compartment). The model is stratified into 16 age groups, with people under 75

years stratified into 5-year age-bands and one additional stratum for 75+ years. The model population is
closed, with no births or ageing, and deaths remain in the Recovered compartment.

Transmissibility assumptions
We adopted epidemiological parameter values (serial interval, infectiousness by symptom stage, and
incubation, infectiousness and symptomatic periods) used by Davies et al.21 (see Supplementary Material).
We assumed an age-dependent probability of developing clinical symptoms. 22 Asymptomatic individuals
were assumed to be half as infectious as symptomatic individuals. Clinical progression of symptomatic
cases to severe disease is assumed not to affect their infectiousness.
To represent the full range of age structures in Africa, we ranked countries according to their mean age,
and selected countries with the youngest (Niger), oldest (Mauritius), and median (Nigeria) mean age as
case studies. Key country-specific data inputs were age-specific population sizes, sourced from United
Nations World Population Prospects estimates23 and age- and setting-specific social contact matrices. As
no empirical data on age-specific social mixing patterns were available for these three countries, we used
previously published synthetic contact matrices, namely projections of a European multi-country contact
pattern study adjusted to individual countries based on national demographic and socio-economic
characteristics24. Contact data were stratified according to whether the contact was within or outside the
household.
To account for uncertainty regarding the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 in Africa, we implemented the
model stochastically and sampled the basic reproduction number 𝑅0 , from a normal distribution with mean
2.6 and standard deviation of 0.525. We implemented different 𝑅0 estimates by scaling the probability of
transmission per contact with an infectious person in accordance with the ratio between the target 𝑅0 and
the dominant eigenvalue of the Next-Generation Matrix (Supplementary Material).

Case severity assumptions
In high-income countries, the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections has been shown to increase with age and
prevalence of various comorbidities26–28. In practice, individual comorbidities co-occur (e.g. diabetes and
hypertension), and co- and multimorbidity increase with age10. To simplify assumptions, we took age as a
single predictor of severity, applying current evidence on its association with risk of symptomatic disease,
severe disease (i.e. requiring hospitalisation), and critical disease (need for intensive care).
However, in African and low-income countries, an average person’s underlying vulnerability may
correspond to that of an individual with greater chronological age in a high-income setting due to lifecourse effects including malnutrition, infections and often unmanaged non-communicable diseases. It is
not yet known how this might affect COVID-19 severity29, although Global Burden of Disease data show
strong associations between income level and the severity of other respiratory infections, particularly in
younger age groups.29 To account for this, we shifted age-specific severity risks (probability of becoming
a severe case and critical case) towards younger age by 10 years. To explore the effect of increased
vulnerability and lack of access to healthcare, we also multiplied current estimates of age-specific casefatality ratios (CFR; from China and the Diamond Princess cruise ship outbreak) of severe, and critical
cases by a factor of 1.5 (used for our main analysis; see Supplementary Material). We did not make
assumptions about the proportion of cases that would receive appropriate treatment: the CFR multiplier
factor attempts to capture worse prognosis under limited or no treatment.

Response interventions
The range of response interventions explored, alone or in combination, are outlined in Table 1. We
assumed these would be applied at the country level.
Self-isolation was implemented as a reduction in transmissibility of infected people during their
symptomatic period, equivalent to a reduction in their contacts. W e did not account for additional
quarantine of other members in the same household.
General physical distancing was implemented as a reduction in all contacts outside the household. We
assumed no change in transmission within the household.
Shielding was implemented by stratifying the population into one shielded and one unshielded
compartment. In the presence of shielding, mixing between the shielded and unshielded population would
reduce by some degree, while mixing within the shielded population may remain the same, decrease (to
zero if people are shielded individually) or increase if shielded people are resettled in overcrowded
housing. While in the intervention’s practical application people should be shielded on the basis of age
and/or known comorbidities, for this model we assumed more simplistically that varying proportions of the
population aged 60 and above would be shielded.

Analysis outcomes
We compared outcomes under different intervention values and strategies (combinations of interventions)
for each unique combination of sampled 𝑅0 and model seeds. We present median, 50% and 95% quantiles
of differences in outcomes across all combinations, and show results stratified by 𝑅0 in the Supplementary
Material.
For the impact of individual interventions, we considered severe cases as our primary outcome. For the
impact of different strategies, we observed the total number of symptomatic cases, severe cases (those
who require hospitalisation), critical cases (those who require intensive care, ICU), and deaths, and
present the expected time until peak of the epidemic, including peak bed demand that would be required.
We only show estimates for the first 12 months after introduction of the first case, as the evolution of the
epidemic beyond this period is subject to considerable unknowns (e.g. availability of vaccines or
therapeutics; virus mutation, persistence of natural immunity).

Ethics
The study used only publicly available aggregate data and was thus not subject to ethical review.

Results
Epidemic trajectories in the absence of control
Simulations of an unmitigated epidemic in Niger resulted in a median of 4.1 million clinical cases during
the first 12 months following introduction of the first case, 48.7 million in Nigeria and 490 000 in Mauritius
(Table 2), with the most probable epidemic peaks after 3, 4 and 2 months respectively (Figure 1). We
estimate some 39,000 deaths due to COVID-19 in Niger, 605,000 in Nigeria and 17,000 in Mauritius would
occur over the same period, not accounting for indirect excess mortality due to health service or socioeconomic disruptions. However, there is considerable uncertainty associated with these median estimates
of cases and deaths (Table 2), which are mainly the result of different 𝑅0 values considered. Large
epidemics that peak early occur in scenarios where 𝑅0 is high, whereas epidemics with lower 𝑅0 will have
a lower total and peak epidemic size, and will peak later (Supplemental Figure S9).

Effect of individual interventions
Self-isolation of symptomatic individuals
We estimate a reduction in severe cases during the first 12 months of the epidemic if symptomatic cases
self-isolate throughout this period with varying levels of adherence (Figure 2A). Increasing adherence has
a nearly linear relationship with the incidence of severe cases, but the maximum median impact is a 30%
reduction (under an extreme scenario of 100% reduction in all contacts while having clinical symptoms).
Although the probability of being a (symptomatic) case is modelled age-dependent, the impact of selfisolation was similar in all countries despite their different demographic distributions. Uncertainty intervals
for Nigeria and Mauritius were wider, but mainly reflected differences in 𝑅0 between simulations
(Supplemental Figure S10). In simulations where a low 𝑅0 was used, there was potential for a larger
reduction in severe cases. The impact of 𝑅0 variability is smaller in Niger, where a higher proportion of

Population-wide physical distancing
Figure 2B shows the estimated impact of population-wide (i.e. not targeting any group) physical distancing,
whereby all individuals reduce their contacts outside of the household to a certain degree, while contacts
within the household remain unchanged. Across all three countries, reducing all contacts outside the
household by an extreme of 100%, if sustained over the entire 12 months period, could result in a median
reduction in severe cases by over 90%. However, this would largely delay rather than prevent severe
cases, as insufficient levels of herd-immunity would develop, leading to a second wave of cases following
the relaxation of measures. Relatively high reductions in contacts are needed for large impacts. Patterns
were largely consistent across countries. Stratified results by 𝑅0 are shown in Supplemental Figure S10.
Impact can vary substantially between settings with low and high 𝑅0 , reflected by the wide intervals here.
For instance, when reducing 40% of contacts outside of the household, reduction in severe cases in the
first 12 months of the epidemic could be as low as 18% in scenarios with an 𝑅0 above 3, while it could be
as high as 71% in scenarios with an 𝑅0 below 2.

Shielding of high-risk individuals
Shielding of high-risk individuals aims to reduce the number of severe cases among high-risk groups, and
thereby in the overall population, while having a smaller effect on transmission in the population and
thereby on the total number of cases. Figure 3 shows the reduction in the number of severe cases for
different reductions in contacts between shielded and unshielded individuals, percentages of individuals
shielded and changes in contact intensity within the shielded group, relative to baseline.

percentages of people ≥ 60 years old shielded (see legend), for each country, across 500 model runs.
Across all countries, reductions in severe cases increased with the percentage ≥ 60 years old shielded,
but the reduction in contacts between shielded and unshielded individuals was more influential, with ≥ 60%
reduction in contacts required to achieve ≥ 10% reduction in severe cases. The degree of contact among
shielded individuals appeared to be of lesser importance for Niger and Nigeria, with similar effect sizes
regardless of whether the shielded individuals reduce their contact with one another to zero, remain at
baseline, or quadruple it. This pattern does not hold for Mauritius, where a marked drop in the effect is

seen when contact among shielded individuals quadruples: this is reflective of Mauritius having a larger
elderly population, thereby contributing more to the overall proportion of severe cases in the population.
As shielding does not significantly affect transmission dynamics, estimates are similar across scenarios
with low- and high R0 (Supplemental Figure S11). However, prediction intervals are wider in Mauritius,
where a high proportion of the total population is shielded (8 - 14%).

Impact of potential control strategies
Without lockdowns
We explored the impact of five different strategies and compared their impact to the unmitigated epidemic
over the first 12 months after introduction of the first case. We assumed that self-isolation of symptomatic
individuals, featuring 50% reduction in transmission, would be part of any strategy. We then added (i) 20%
or (ii) 50% reduction in contacts outside the household through physical distancing, (iii) shielding of 80%
of individuals aged 60 and older, with a reduction of 80% in contacts between the shielded and unshielded
population and no change in contacts within the shielded population, (iv) a combination of shielding and
20% physical distancing, and (v) a combination of shielding with 50% physical distancing. Interventions
are implemented when daily incidence reaches 1 case per 10,000 people and are assumed to be
maintained for the remainder of the year.
Figure 4 shows the evolution of deaths depending on the strategy chosen. Evolution of bed demand under
each scenario is given in Supplementary Figure S2. Table 3 shows the corresponding attack rate, total
number of cases, severe cases, and critical cases, time of epidemic peak, and peak bed demand for
severe and critical cases. All strategies yielded substantial but partial reductions in key health outcomes.
Under all strategies, we estimate a high bed capacity needed in the three countries modelled.
Whereas reducing transmission outside of the household by 20% would be more effective in reducing the
total number of clinical cases than shielding, shielding could be as effective in reducing the total bed
demand at the peak of the epidemic and total number of deaths as general physical distancing.
More substantial levels of physical distancing (50%) would lead to far greater effects in the first 12 months
of the epidemic. However, this strategy, unlike shielding, reduces overall transmission and thus does not
necessarily result in a resolution of the epidemic through herd immunity during this period; instead, this
intervention would need to be sustained into the second year until herd-immunity is reached through either
natural immunity or a vaccine, assuming immunity is long lived. Supplemental Figure S3 illustrates this
phenomenon: when all interventions except self-isolation are lifted after 12 months, scenarios where
physical distancing has reduced transmission outside the household by 50% in the first year may feature
a second, albeit smaller peak during the second year if no further mitigation measures are taken; this
further peak is absent under the other strategies. However, predictions beyond the first year may vary
considerably depending on the longevity of SARS-CoV-2 immunity and availability of potential
pharmaceutical interventions, and should be interpreted with caution. 4
A combination of shielding and physical distancing would be most effective in reducing overall outcomes.
Table 4 highlights the relative reduction in hospital bed demand for severe cases at the epidemic peak and
total number of deaths in the first 12 months of the epidemic, under each scenario. Notably, shielding 80%
of the high-risk population and reducing contact between the shielded and unshielded populations by 80%
could be as effective in reducing severe outcomes as general physical distancing reducing transmission
with 20%.

In combination with lockdowns
We also explored the impact a temporary lockdown could have on these same strategies. We assumed a
two-month lockdown, triggered at incidence 1 per 10,000 person-days, during which, in addition to selfisolation as above, all contacts outside the household were reduced by 80%; the remainder of the year
consisted of the five alternative strategies above.
Supplemental Figure S4 shows bed demand and deaths over time while Supplemental Table S3 shows
key outcomes in the first 12 months under this lockdown scenario. A lockdown would delay, but not
prevent, the epidemic peak in all countries (from 3 to 6-7 months in Niger, from 4 to 7-8 months in Nigeria,
and from 2 to 5-6 months in Mauritius). However, it would not substantially affect total epidemic sizes or
peak bed demand, compared to strategies without lockdowns.

Removing self-isolation of symptomatic individuals
As a sensitivity analysis, we explored how the impact of different scenarios would compare in the absence
of self-isolation. Supplemental Figure S5 shows bed demand and deaths over time for each modelled
strategy in the absence of self-isolation, while Supplemental Table S4 shows associated key outcomes.
Removing self-isolation substantially increased the number of cases and deaths in all scenarios. However,
this relative difference was larger for scenarios with physical distancing only (11-15% higher mortality)
than for scenarios with shielding only (6-10%). The resulting increased transmission brought the epidemic
peak forward in all countries.

Figure 4: Estimated daily number of deaths during the first 12 months of the epidemic, under different strategies. Thick solid lines
show the run which was closest to the median total number of deaths after 12 months across all model runs. Dashed lines are runs closest
to the lower and upper 95% quantiles, while dotted lines are runs closest to the lower and upper 50% quantiles of total number of deaths,
calculated over 500 model runs. Except for the unmitigated scenario, all scenarios assume 50% self-isolation during the symptomatic period
of all clinical cases throughout the entire course of the epidemic. Other interventions start when daily incidence of symptomatic cases reaches
1 case per 10 000 people. Distancing strategies assume 20% or 50% reduction in all contacts outside of the household. Shielding strategies
assume shielding of 80% of the population aged 60+, irrespective of underlying comorbidities, with an 80% reduction in contacts between the
shielded and unshielded population, and no change in contacts within the shielded population. Estimates for bed demand over time are given
in Supplementary Figure S2.

Empirical contact matrices
To test the sensitivity of our results to this assumption, we replicated our analysis in three African countries for
which empirical contact data are available: Kenya (rural Kilifi District), Uganda (rural to semi-urban Mbarara
District), and Zimbabwe (the city of Bulawayo) 30–32. To account for sampling error in these contact studies, we
generated bootstrapped matrices for each of 500 model runs. Results are shown in the Supplementary
Material. The impact of self-isolation and physical distancing was lower in these countries compared to our
estimates for Niger, Nigeria, and Mauritius, though the impact of the shielding approach was similar or higher.
We may therefore have underestimated the relative impact of shielding compared to the other interventions in
our analysis, though impact of shielding was also lower in scenarios where contact within the shielded
population increased, compared to the impact found in Niger, Nigeria, and Mauritius.

Discussion
Main findings
We explored the impact of different non-pharmaceutical control interventions and strategies (packages and
sequences of interventions) that may effectively be implemented in African countries to mitigate COVID-19
epidemics. Short of an indefinite-duration lock-down, none of the interventions would likely avert very large
epidemics that result in high mortality and extreme pressure on health services. However, both self-isolation
of symptomatic people and moderate physical distancing could translate into relatively moderate but, in
absolute terms, very sizable reductions in severe cases and deaths. The shielding option would likely require
high levels of adherence and isolation to yield appreciable reductions in health service pressure, but could
have a higher potential to reduce mortality in the short-term than other interventions, as it focuses on those
who experience the highest CFR. This option also promotes herd immunity through mixing of other age groups
and thus carries a lesser risk of further epidemic peaks once measures are lifted.

Van Zandvoort et al. (2020)

Different shielding arrangements could be considered, ranging from individual arrangements wherever people
already live in multi-room houses or compounds, to neighbours or extended family-members grouping the
most vulnerable individuals in vacated houses, to larger, albeit epidemiologically riskier re-housing (e.g. in
quarantined street blocks). To avoid the problem of transmission within the shielded population, all such
arrangements would need to eliminate any traffic of external people in and out of shielded accommodation as
much as possible ensuring basic needs are met, while also instituting infection control barriers, e.g. a
designated exchange point for supplies and safe social interactions and limiting contact within the shielded
population. While our model does not explore the micro-level dynamics of how seeding of infection into these
accommodations would affect residents, we showed, as expected, that the amount of contact among high-risk
shielded people matters: zero contact, equivalent to individual shielding, equates to the highest effect of the
intervention, while an increase of contact from baseline, e.g. if shielded people are rehoused in more crowded
conditions than in their households of origin, dampens the utility of this approach and could even lead to an
increase in cases compared to the baseline of no intervention.
We next combined the above interventions into a set of strategies, with a horizon of 12 months, that countries
could consider. We assumed that any strategy would feature, at a minimum, self-isolation of symptomatic
cases. Our predictions suggest that countrywide lockdowns of two months, if effective, would temporarily
suppress and delay epidemics for around 2 months, as noted in Europe: this reprieve would potentially enable
countries to mobilise resources and plan the implementation of the next phase of their strategy. These findings
do not in themselves support lockdown measures as a universal solution, however: such measures may be
ineffective (i.e. fail to achieve a contact rate reduction consistent with effective reproduction number < 1, the
condition for suppression) or more harmful than beneficial, including in health terms, if they severely disrupt
economies and livelihoods or encounter mistrust and community resistance. Rather, our predictions merely
indicate that well-implemented lockdowns would achieve the intended effect.
If lockdowns are not implemented, or after they end, we predict that a combination of general physical
distancing and shielding high-risk individuals could be a potentially achievable mitigation strategy for countries
to consider. Physical distancing entails a difficult trade-off between reducing attack rates (and hence epidemic
peak size) and extending the duration of the epidemic, which in turn increases the period over which shielding
should be maintained (as individuals will require to be shielded until well after the epidemic peak has finished).
While stringent physical distancing (e.g. 50% reduction in extra-household contacts) would have a large
impact, such reductions may only be achieved through socio-economically damaging and potentially
unacceptable restrictions to work, education and/or other forms of public life. By contrast, a 20% reduction in
transmission may be more achievable and sustainable - in some settings, this could involve a combination of
hygiene promotion, increased access to water, soap and other cleaning supplies (e.g. through state subsidies)
and curtailment of some gatherings outside of work and school. It is unknown at present whether shielding is
at all feasible and can attain our suggested target of 80% contact reduction between high- and low-risk people
for 80% of high-risk people. Even at lower effectiveness levels, however, shielding would still offer benefits,
particularly in terms of mortality, and accordingly need not be discounted as an option, particularly if it can be
designed and led by communities themselves 33, thereby requiring fewer resources than a top-down
intervention.
We only show estimates for the first 12 months in our analysis to make short-term predictions of the impact of
different intervention strategies. There are still many unknowns about how SARS-CoV-2 would behave in in
different contexts in Africa (rural, urban, peri-urban, displacement settings, etc.) and how people will respond
to policy measures; hence policy makers will continuously need to revisit the strategy to take current
developments into account. Our analysis does not necessarily reflect the total epidemic size, as additional

severe and critical cases could accrue during the second year, especially under strategies that focus heavily
on physical distancing or if natural immunity to infection is short-lived.4

Comparison with other studies
Although several studies have looked at the spread of COVID-19 in African countries34–38, we are only aware
of one other modelling study which considers the impact of different interventions on the spread of COVID-19
in Africa. Walker et al.39 used a similar SEIR model and predicted a near 90% reduction in cases for subSaharan Africa assuming a 75% reduction in contacts starting at an incidence of 0.2 deaths per 100,000
population per week and sustained over the first 250 days of an epidemic. Comparisons between these studies
are complicated due to different time periods of models and strategies investigated, but both point to a large
unmitigated epidemic which can be reduced substantially due to strong physical distancing measures.
However, even with these measures in place all models suggest a high burden of disease and mortality across
Africa.

Study limitations
While SEIR models have successfully been used to model COVID-19 epidemics to date in Europe, our
predictions for African countries are subject to potential inaccuracy. Transmissibility may vary considerably
across Africa, and it is possible that countries with very concentrated urban populations would see an acute
exponential rise in cases, with a secondary, flatter curve affecting outlying rural regions: models accounting
for these very distinct settlement types may be more useful for national planning. Consequently, the duration
of time that countries will be affected by COVID-19 according to our model should be treated with caution.
While we accounted for age distributions, we did not have country-specific data on contact patterns among
age groups. Instead, we used synthetic contact matrices extrapolated from European data by using local data
on household, workplace and school composition in the African settings considered. A sensitivity analysis with
empirical African contact pattern data suggested lower effects of general distancing and higher effects of
shielding, but these matrices were collected in specific areas and may not be representative of contact patterns
within the entire country or indeed Africa as a whole.
Our results are also heavily affected by disease severity assumptions. We applied age-specific risks of
developing severe disease per infection, as estimated using data from China and the Diamond Princess
outbreak, but shifted these to earlier life by a decade to represent plausible differences in biological age in
Africa resulting from life-course exposures. This crude approach may be confounded by differences in the agespecific prevalence of co-morbidities in African countries, as well as inter-country differences in comorbidity
prevalence. Specifically, conditions with potential (tuberculosis 39) and as yet undocumented (HIV,
undernutrition, sickle-cell disease) interactions with SARS-CoV-2 infection are far more prevalent in Africa than
China and affect relatively young age groups 10: these could increase COVID-19 severity overall and shift the
distribution of severe cases to younger age. Additionally, the proportion of detected and correctly managed
cases of non-communicable diseases of known import to COVID-19 progression (cardiovascular disease,
diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease) is far lower in most of Africa than in
China and Europe: this may further exacerbate disease severity. These differing patterns of co-morbidity may
also affect the proportion of patients requiring intensive care and case-fatality: for the latter, we have provided
illustrative findings assuming age-constant increases in Africa compared to China, based on an assumption of

very limited treatment. These findings will need to be refined as more evidence accrues on the virus’ CFR in
African settings.
Severity and CFR assumptions mostly affect the usefulness of the shielding option. Shielding criteria should
include a diagnosis of co-morbidity, and as such our findings, based solely on an age criterion, are underestimates insofar as they exclude younger people with known comorbidities. However, in practice the low noncommunicable disease treatment coverage in Africa means the age criterion would largely define who is
shielded: lowering this threshold, e.g. to 50 years, would capture a larger fraction of undiagnosed comorbidities. Tiered shielding approaches, whereby middle-aged moderate-risk people benefit from partial
distancing measures (e.g. support to stay home from work), may also be worth considering.

Conclusions
COVID-19 epidemics in African countries may bear very serious and multi-faceted impacts. Nevertheless,
preventive strategies to substantially mitigate these impacts are not foreclosed to African governments and
societies, particularly if they receive assistance from humanitarian and development actors, diaspora
communities, faith-based institutions, the private sector and others within these societies who have means to
assist the response. Self-isolation and moderate physical distancing can be effective interventions. The
shielding option can be proactively explored to test locally appropriate solutions. As the epidemic progresses,
real-time modelling and strategy evaluation should be made available to African countries that do not yet have
this expertise: this requires coordination and proactive support from the worldwide scientific community, as
well as close exchange of information between modelling teams and country-based surveillance, so as to
gradually refine predictions.

Supplementary material
Model structure
We used a stochastic compartmental dynamic transmission model, stratified into age groups 𝑖. The model’s
structure is depicted in Figure S1.

Supplemental Figure S1. State transitions in the model. Individuals in the stochastic compartmental model
are classified into susceptible, exposed (infected but not yet infectious), infectious (preclinical, clinical, or
subclinical), and recovered states. The model is stratified into 5-year age bands. Taken from Davies et al.21
The model tracks a country’s population over discrete 6-hour increments. Within every age group, the
population is distributed into compartments of susceptible individuals (𝑆), who become exposed (𝐸) after
effective contact with an infectious person (exposed here means infected but not yet infectious). At the end of
the latency period, people divide into clinical (symptomatic) and sub-clinical (asymptomatic) cases with
complementary probabilities 𝑦𝑖 and 1 − 𝑦𝑖, at which point infectiousness starts. Clinical cases experience a
pre-clinical but infectious state 𝐼𝑃 followed by a clinical, infectious state 𝐼𝐶 . Sub-clinical cases (𝐼𝑆 ) are assumed
to be half as infectious as clinical cases. All individuals have the same duration of infectiousness. The clinical
severity of cases is not assumed to affect infectiousness. Individuals either recover or die, transitioning to the
removed (𝑅) compartment. Transitions to different clinical states (symptom onset to severe case, critical or
not; from onset of severe symptoms to recovery or death) occur with delays drawn from the literature: these
delays have no bearing on the force of infection / transmissibility.

Force of infection and transmissibility
The force of infection is defined as the rate at which susceptible people enter the exposed compartment, and
is computed for any age group 𝑖 and time increment 𝑡 as

𝜆𝑖,𝑡 = 𝑢 ∑ 𝑐𝑖𝑗,𝑡
𝑗

Van Zandvoort et al. (2020)

𝐼𝑃𝑗 + 𝐼𝐶𝑗 + 𝑓𝐼𝑆𝑗
𝑁𝑗

COVID-19 response strategies in Africa

Page 23 of 39

* THIS STUDY HAS NOT YET BEEN PEER-REVIEWED *
where 𝑢 is the probability of infection per contact with an infectious person, 𝑐𝑖𝑗 is the number of contacts that
an individual in age group 𝑖 has with individuals in age group 𝑗 per time increment (drawn from the contact
matrix), and

𝐼𝑃𝑗+𝐼𝐶𝑗+𝑓𝐼𝑆𝑗
𝑁𝑗

is the probability that any age j individual contacted is in fact infectious, with 𝑓 denoting

the relative infectiousness of subclinical cases, compared to clinical cases.
The amount of time a given individual spends in states 𝐸, 𝐼𝑃 , 𝐼𝐶 , or 𝐼𝑠 is drawn from distributions 𝑑𝐸 , 𝑑𝑃 , 𝑑𝐶
and 𝑑𝑆 , respectively (Table S1). The basic reproduction number 𝑅0 is defined as the average number of
secondary infections generated by a typical infectious individual in a fully susceptible population and is
calculated as the absolute value of the dominant eigenvalue of the next generation matrix (NGM), which was
derived by linearizing the system at epidemic equilibrium. 40 Lastly, 𝑢 is derived for any stochastic run from the
ratio of this eigenvalue and the 𝑅0 value selected for that run.

Parameter values
The model was implemented stochastically by selecting random values of parameters from their uncertainty
distributions (Table S1).

Severity parameters
We used the same severity estimates as in Davies et al21: these reflect the early COVID-19 outbreak in China48,
corrected based on data from the Diamond Princess cruise ship outbreak.49 However, in African and lowincome countries, someone’s vulnerability to infection may correspond to that of an individual with greater
chronological age in a high-income setting due to life-course effects like malnutrition, infections and often
unmanaged non-communicable diseases. It is not yet known whether this increased vulnerability will affect
COVID-19 age-specific disease risk in African populations. To provide conservative estimates, we shifted agespecific severity risks by 10 years towards younger ages. In addition, we multiplied the CFRs of severe and
critical cases by a factor of 1.5 to account for lower access to care. Age-specific severity estimates used are
presented in Table S2.

Thick solid lines show the runs representing the median daily number of hospital beds needed for severe cases, critical cases, and the
number of deaths during the first 12 months of the epidemic. Dashed lines show runs representing 50% quantiles, while dotted lines show
runs representing 95% quantiles, of each respective value over 500 model runs. Except for the unmitigated scenario, all scenarios assume
50% self-isolation during the symptomatic period of all clinical cases throughout the entire course of the epidemic and are preceded by a twomonth lockdown where contacts outside of the household are reduced by 80%. Lockdown starts when daily incidence of symptomatic cases
reaches 1 case per 10 000 people, while other strategies start once the lockdown is lifted. Non-lockdown distancing strategies assume 20%
or 50% reduction in all contacts outside of the household. Shielding strategies assume shielding of 80% of the population aged 60+,
irrespective of underlying comorbidities, with an 80% reduction in contacts between the shielded and unshielded population, and no change
in contacts within the shielded population.

Estimated impact in countries with empirical contact data: Kenya, Uganda,
and Zimbabwe
We replicated the individual intervention analysis in three countries for which we had empirical contact
matrices (Kenya, Uganda and Zimbabwe). As these data came from household sample surveys, we
took one new bootstrapped sample from the contact matrix in each model run.
Unmitigated epidemic projections are shown in Figure S6. Figure S7 shows the effects of self-isolation
and physical distancing, which have been run for a subset of scenarios as used in the main paper for
Niger, Nigeria and Mauritius only. Effect sizes appear lower than for the main analysis of Niger, Nigeria
and Mauritius using synthetic contact matrices.
Lastly, as shown in Figure S8, the potential effect of shielding appears about 10% higher than for the
main analysis, but with wider uncertainty due to the propagation of contact matrix sampling error. In
addition, Uganda, Kenya, and Zimbabwe have different age-distributions, so results are not directly
comparable. This analysis shows shielding to be comparatively more sensitive to changes in contact
among shielded individuals, with a substantial loss of effect when shielded people greatly increase their
contacts, e.g. if they are rehoused in overcrowded conditions.

simulations of an unmitigated epidemic, by country with empirical contact matrix data. The green
line shows the run corresponding to the median total of cases at the end of the simulation across all
model runs. Grey lines show individual stochastic model runs, where R0 in each run was sampled from
a normal distribution with mean 2.6 and standard deviation 0.5.

Sensitivity to transmissibility assumption (𝑅0 )
Uncertainty intervals in our results were mainly reflective of the range of 𝑅0 values we sampled in the
model. Here we show our results stratified by 𝑅0 values, as sampled across 500 runs from a normal 𝑅0
distribution with mean 2.6 and standard deviation of 0.5.
Supplemental Figure S9 shows the unmitigated epidemic in each country for every model run (i.e.
randomly sampled 𝑅0 value) where 𝑅0 is grouped into values <2, between 2 and 3, and >3. Epidemics
with high 𝑅0 have a higher peak number of cases and total number of cases, and will peak earlier,
whereas epidemics with a low 𝑅0 will have a lower peak number of cases and total number of cases,
and will peak later.

Supplemental Figure S9. Projected incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 cases over time for
simulations of an unmitigated epidemic, by 𝑅0 value.
Supplemental Figure S10A shows the impact of self-isolation and physical distancing (equivalent to
Figure 2 in the main text), but for every single run and stratified by 𝑅0 . High reductions as a result of
self-isolation may only be achieved with very low values of 𝑅0 , and are less likely in Niger, which has a
younger population (i.e. symptomatic individuals are relatively fewer and thus contribute less to
transmissibility). However, with higher values of 𝑅0 , the impact of self-isolation is roughly similar across
countries. Runs with smaller 𝑅0 are more affected by stochasticity of the model, which is why these
estimates do not always continue their upward trend.
Supplemental Figure S10B shows the impact of physical distancing on the total number of severe cases.
The impact of physical distancing can be substantially lower when 𝑅0 is higher, as greater reductions in
contacts will be needed to bring 𝑅 closer to 1.

Supplemental Figure S10. Impact of A. self-isolation and B. physical distancing, by 𝑹𝟎 value
sampled.

Lastly, Supplemental Figure S11 shows the impact of shielding 80% of the high-risk population under
various reductions in contacts between the shielded and unshielded population, and changes in contact
within the shielded population, for every single run. It is equivalent to Figure 3 in the main text. As
shielding does not significantly affect the overall transmission dynamics in the population, impact does
not vary much between different values of 𝑅0 . Relative reductions could be substantially higher or lower
at low values of 𝑅0 , but reflect only a small absolute difference.
In Mauritius, where 18% of the population are 60+ years old (i.e. 15% are shielded under a shielding
coverage of 80%), variation in 𝑅0 matters if contact within the shielded population changes from
baseline, as this does significantly affect transmission dynamics in the overall population (the 15% of
people shielded are relatively more infectious than the average).
