Abstract
Background:
Although the SARS-CoV-2 viral load detection of respiratory specimen has been
widely used for novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) diagnosis, it is undeniable that
serum SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid (RNAaemia) could be detected in a fraction of the
COVID-19 patients. However, it is not clear that if the incidence of RNAaemia could
be correlated with the occurrence of cytokine storm or with the specific class of
patients.

Methods:
This study enrolled 48 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the General Hospital
of Central Theater Command, PLA, a designated hospital in Wuhan, China. The
patients were divided into three groups according to the Dia gnosis and Treatment of
New Coronavirus Pneumonia (version 6) published by the National Health
Commission of China. The clinical and laboratory data were collected. The serum
viral load detection and serum IL-6 levels were determined. Except for routine
statistical analysis, Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) analysis was used to establish
a patient status prediction model based on real-time RT-PCR Ct value.

Findings:
The Result showed that cases with RNAaemia were exclusively confirmed in
critically ill patients group and appeared to reflect the illness severity. Further more,
the inflammatory cytokine IL-6 levels were significantly elevated in critically ill
patients, which is almost 10-folds higher than those in other patients. More
importantly, the extremely high IL-6 level was closely correlated with the incidence
of RNAaemia (R=0.902) and the vital signs of COVID-19 patients (R= -0.682).

Interpretation:
Serum SARS-CoV-2 viral load (RNAaemia) is strongly associated with cytokine
storm and can be used to predict the poor prognosis of COVID-19 patients.
Moreover, our results strongly suggest that cytokine IL-6 should be considered as a
therapeutic target in critically ill patients with excessive inflammatory response.

Introduction
The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which is caused by SARS-CoV-2
virus infection, has been called as a public health emergency of international concern
by the World Health Organization (WHO) 1-3. The disease spread rapidly from Wuhan
to other areas. Compared with two other WHO blueprint priority coronaviruses,
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is lethal4 . As of February 25, 2020,
SARS-CoV-2 has led to 2663 deaths in China base on the report from National Health
Commission of China.
SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV likely use the same angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the entry receptor5-7, but the clinical manifestations of two
diseases were different. COVID-19 patients may develop mild or severe symptoms
after infection. The mild patients show symptoms of fever, nonproductive cough,
dyspnea, myalgia, fatigue, radiographic evidence of pneumonia; most of them appear
to have a good prognosis. In contrast, some patients may develop severe pneumonia,
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or multiple organ failure8-11. Importantly,
in most moribund patients, SARS-CoV-2 infection is also associated with an
inflammatory cytokine storm4, 12, which is mainly characterized by elevated plasma
concentrations of interleukins 6 (IL-6). Indeed, several recent COVID-19 clinical
studies all indicated that interleukins 6 levels is higher in severe group than those of
mild group12-15, suggesting that IL-6 might be used as a biomarker for severity
evaluation. However, how the IL-6 level is quantitatively correlated with moribund
patients is still unknown.
Reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction assay (qPCR) with primers and
probes targeting the N and ORF1ab genes of SARS-CoV-2 from throat swab samples
have been widely used for diagnosis of COVID-19 patients. Recent investigation
showed that the viral load that was determined in the asymptomatic patient was
similar to that in the symptomatic patients16 , implying that the viral load in
respiratory specimens may not be able to objectively reflect the disease severity.
Serum SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA (termed as RNAaemia by the authors in an recent
study) was detected in 15% of the COVID-19 patients

9

, but the relevant

characterizations is lacking. In particular, it is not clear if serum SARS-CoV-2 viral
loads could be considered as a prognostic marker, especially for the severe or
moribund patients, is not clear.

Method

Data collection
The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of General Hospital of Central
Theater Command. Oral consent was obtained from patients. The 48 COVID-19
patients enrolled were confirmed by RT-PCR using throat-swab specimens collected
at General Hospital of Central Theater Command between February 01 and February
19, 2020. Their medical records were obtained,

including epidemiological,

demographic, clinical manifestation, radiological characteristics, laboratory data, and
outcome data were obtained. All data were checked by a team of trained physicians.

Laboratory examination
Serum samples or throat-swabs were collected from all patients and RNAs were
extracted. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR)
was used to determine the viral loads by using a SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection
kit (DAAN GENE Ltd., Guangzhou, China, Cat# DA0930-DA0932). Two target
genes, the open reading frame1ab (ORF1ab) and nucleocapsidprotein (N),were
simultaneously amplified and tested. A cycle threshold value (Ct-value) fewer than 40
was defined as a positive test result, and a Ct-value of 40 or more was defined as a
negative outcome according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Specimens, including
sputum or alveolar lavatory fluid, blood, urine, and feces, were cultured to identify
pathogenic bacteria or fungi that may be associated with the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Inflammatory cytokine IL-6 levels were detected with kit from Roche Ltd (Mannheim,
Germany, Cat# 05109442190).

Statistical Analysis
The categorization of COVID-19 patients were according to the Diagnosis and
Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia (Version 6) published by the National
Health Commission of China. Classification variables were described as frequency
rates or percentages, and significance is detected by chi square or Fisher’s exact test.
The quantized variables of parameters are expressed as mean ± standard deviation,
and the significance is tested by t-test. SPSS statistical software (Macintosh version
26.0, IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) and R package are used for statistical analysis.
Generalized linear models (GLMs) were used to analyze the degree of patient

severity. We first fitted GLMs regarding different response variables with all
explanatory factors and their interactions, and then selected the optimum models by
applying a stepwise backward selection method via an Akaike information criterion
(AIC) index. For the patient's severity data, four degrees, mild (1), severe (2), critical
(3) and dead (4) have been included in the GLM, taking a Gaussian family
distribution into account.

Result

Characteristics of enrolled COVID-19 patients in this study
A total of 48 patients were enrolled in this study, which are all laboratory
confirmed cases. According to the Guidelines of the Diagnosis and Treatment of New
Coronavirus Pneumonia (version 6) published by the National Health Commission of
China, the enrolled COVID-19 patients were categorized into three groups: 21 mild
cases (43.7%) , 10 severe cases (20.8%) and 17 critically ill cases (35.4%). Three
patients in the critical group died after disease onset. The required conditions must be
met for mild patients was the positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA RT-PCR result, because the
mild patients might be asymptomatic 8, fever or other respiratory symptoms and the
typical CT image abnormities of viral pneumonia are optional. Severe patients
additionally met at least one of the following conditions: (1) Shortness of breath,
RR≥30 times/min, (2) Oxygen saturation (Resting state) ≤93%, or (3) PaO2/FiO2
≤300mmHg. Enrollment of critically ill patients need to met at least one of the extra
following conditions: (1) Respiratory failure that need to receive mechanical
ventilation; (2) Shock and (3) Multiple organ failure that need to be transferred to the
intensive care unit (ICU).
As shown in Table 1, the enrolled COVID-19 patients consisted of 31 males
(77.1%) and 17 females (22.9%). The ages of the critically ill patient group
(79.6±12.6 years) were older than that of both sever group (63.9±15.2 years) and mild
group (45.8±14.2 years), displaying an age-dependent severity. It is noticeable that
several underlying diseases were implicated in the COVID-19 patients, the high-risk
factors including diabetes (12 [25%]), hypertension (23 [49.7%]) and heart disease
(8 [16.7%]). Mixed fungal infection was found in 27.1% patients and the bacterial
appear to be uncommon (2.1%).

The serum SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid was only detectable in critically ill patients
We examined the SARS-CoV-2 viral load in patients serum by real time RTPCR, as shown in Figure 1A and B, 5 out of 48 (10.4%) were confirmed as positive
(Ct-value less than 40), which was similar to the previous study9. Interestingly,
although all the patients were throat-swab specimens test positive, none of the serum
sample from mild or severe group showed positive outcome; In contrast, all of the
five positive results were from critically ill patients, and two of them died after the
onset of the COVID-19 (Figure 1C and D). Except for routine statistical analysis,

Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) analysis was used to establish an patient status
prediction model based on real-time RT-PCR Ct value and their distribution in
various patients groups. As shown in Figure 2, all the dots that stood for the ORF1abqPCR positive patients aggregated and located in the area represent the high
probability of death occurs, indicating that RNAaemia is tightly associated with
severity.
Since there is no direct evidence that SARS-CoV-2 could infect the blood cells,
and serum virus load appear to reflect the severity, we assumed that the serum virus
RNA probably was derived from the damaged organs and ruptured vessel, which was
caused by aberrant and excessive immune responses. Because inflammatory cytokine
storm is frequently occurred in critically ill COVID-19 patients, we then asked that if
there any laboratory parameters could be associated RNAaemia and contribute to the
COVID-19 severity?

Sharply increased IL-6 level was strongly associated with the COVID-19 severity
As shown in Table 2, the absolute counts of lymphocytes in the peripheral blood
of the severe patients was lower, and became even lower in critically ill patients,
which is consistent with recent report 17, 18 ,while the absolute counts of neutrophils
were higher in critically ill patients. Procalcitonin (PCT) value was higher in critically
ill patients compared with another two groups, which was similar to other clinical
observation19, indicating an obvious elevated inflammatory response in those patients.
Remarkably, sharply increased IL-6 level was observed in critically ill patients, which
was almost 10-folds higher than that of severe patients, moreover, all of the death
cases exhibited extremely high IL-6 value(Table S1), suggesting that IL-6 might be
an important biomarker of poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients. The extremely high
level of IL-6 is a hallmark and an important driving force of cytokine storm20, which
may cause multiple organs functional disability in critically ill patients4. Consistently,
the parameters stand for the organ dysfunction, including TnT (troponin T), AST
(aspartate transaminase), ALT (aspartate transaminase), CRE (serum creatinine), and
BUN (blood urea nitrogen), all appear to be higher in critically ill patients compared
with another two groups.

RNAaemia is closely associated with IL-6 level in critically ill COVID-19 patients
RNAaemia has been proposed in recent study as a COVID-19 related

phenomenon. Our data strongly suggest that both RNAaemia and high IL-6 level were
exclusively observed in critically ill patients, which prompt us to further study the
relation between them. As shown in Figure 3A, patients with RNAaemia exhibited
much higher IL-6 level compared with other patients. We then checked the IL-6 value
in each of the RNAaemia patients, strikingly, all of their IL-6 value were more than
100 (Table S1). In order to further confirm the relation between them, we firstly
analyze the IL-6 value in the critically ill patients, notably, the mortality appeared to
be correlated with IL-6 value ≥100 because all of the death in this study were belong
to this group (Table S1), we therefore define IL-6 value ≥100 as high and the rest of
cases as low, the IL-6 high patients accounted for 35.3% in critically ill group (Figure
3B). As shown in Table 3, the incidence of RNAaemia was closely correlated with
IL-6 high in critically ill

patients (R=0.902). These data clearly suggested that

RNAaemia was related with poor prognosis, indeed, all the RNAaemia patients were
at higher risk of multiple organs impairment compared to those patients without
RNAaemia (Figure 4A-C).

Discussion
Although the detection of throat-swab rather than serum SARS-CoV-2 viral load
is widely used for the COVID-19 diagnosis, an undeniable fact is that serum SARSCoV-2 nucleic acid (RNAaemia) is detectable in part of the patients, however, in
what scenario it become detectable and whether the incidence of RNAaemia could be
correlated with specific type of patients

is not very clear. In this study, we

investigated the distribution of serum SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid positive cases in
various patients groups, and the result showed that those cases all were confirmed
only in critically ill patients group. Moreover, the laboratory data analysis strongly
suggest that inflammatory cytokine IL-6 level was significantly elevated in critically
ill patients. More importantly, the extremely high IL-6 level was closely correlated
with the incidence of RNAaemia and the mortality. Our work may provide clues for
developing new COVID-19 diagnostic strategy and therapeutic targets.
Although recent studies have shown that IL-6 level increased in severe patients14,
its level in COVID-19 critically ill patients is still unknown. IL-6 is one of the major
pro-inflammatory factors that contribute to the formation of cytokine storm, which
largely enhance the vascular permeability and impair the organs function. This
observation might help to explain that why serum SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was only
able to be detected in patients with extremely high level of IL-6. We still could not
rule out the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 virus amount grow explosively in a short
period, which in turn induced the massive cytokine storm that characterized by
elevated level of cytokines such as IL-6. We have to point out that due to the shortage
of detection kit, the results of other cytokines could not be obtained and those
investigations should be warranted in future study.
Our research indicated that serum SARS-CoV-2 viral load and IL-6 level could
serve as an indicator of poor prognosis. Since the mortality of COVID-19 critically ill
patients is considerable, the host-directed therapies should be an option. If IL-6 could
become a therapeutic target for treatment of critically ill patient? Notably, the IL-6
monoclonal antibody-directed COVID-19 therapy has been used in clinical trial in
China (No.ChiCTR2000029765). Our data strongly support this notion and efficacy
of IL-6 monoclonal antibody directed therapy remains to be fully evaluated.
