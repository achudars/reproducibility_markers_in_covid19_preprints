ABSTRACT (192 words)
The adaptive immune system protects against infection via selection of specific antigen receptors on Bcells and T-cells. We studied the prevalent CD8 ‘killer’ T-cell response mounted against SARS-CoV-2
Spike269-277 epitope YLQPRTFLL via the most frequent Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) class I
worldwide, HLA A*02. The widespread Spike P272L mutation has arisen in five different SARS-CoV-2
lineages to date and was common in the B.1.177 lineage associated with establishing the ‘second wave’ in
Europe. The large CD8 T-cell response seen across a cohort of HLA A*02+ convalescent patients,
comprising of over 120 different TCRs, failed to respond to the P272L variant suggesting that proline 272
dominates TCR contacts with this epitope. Additionally, sizable populations (0.01%-0.2%) of total CD8 Tcells from individuals vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 stained with HLA A*02-YLQPRTFLL multimers
but failed to bind to the P272L reagent. Viral escape at prevalent T-cell epitopes restricted by high
frequency HLA may be particularly problematic when vaccine immunity is focussed on a single protein
such as SARS-CoV-2 Spike and provides a strong argument for inclusion of multiple viral proteins in next
generation vaccines and highlights the urgent need for monitoring T-cell escape in new SARS-CoV-2
variants.

INTRODUCTION
The mammalian immune system utilises numerous highly developed mechanisms to defend against viral
infection. The most sophisticated of these systems, adaptive immunity, is controlled via vast fleets of
highly variable antigen-binding molecules called B-cell receptors (antibodies) or T-cell receptors (TCRs).
The advent of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as a novel human
coronavirus and the stress on global healthcare systems caused by the associated coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) has focussed the world’s attention on ways to combat this emerging infection. The
mechanisms used by coronaviruses to escape from the host adaptive immune system are not well
understood but are now firmly in the spotlight. The developing picture shows that neutralising antibodies,
CD4 ‘helper’ T-cells and CD8 ‘killer’ T-cells all contribute to the control of SARS-CoV-2 and the
protection offered by currently approved vaccines1,2. Although research focused on antibody-mediated
immunity has made up the majority of published SARS-CoV-2 immunological work to date, some
evidence suggests that antibodies may play a secondary role in ultimately clearing SARS-CoV-2 infection
compared to T-cells. The presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 and CD8 T-cells has been reported to
correlate with reduced COVID-19 severity while neutralising antibodies in the same individuals did not2.
Two SARS-CoV-2 positive agammaglobulinemia patients who developed COVID-19 symptoms during
the first wave of infection in Italy, required neither oxygen nor intensive care before making full
recoveries3. The authors conclude that while an antibody-mediated response to SARS-CoV-2 might be
important, it is not obligatory for overcoming disease3. This finding is consistent with multiple patients
that developed COVID-19 while on B-cell depleting therapy across several studies, who resolved infection
without the need for intensive treatment4-6. There are also many reports of healthy individuals successfully
controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection without having detectable neutralising, or receptor-binding domain
(RBD), antibodies while having prominent SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell memory2,7-10. Clinical
interventions using monoclonal antibodies further suggest that humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2,
although important, is not the hoped-for panacea for individuals that require intensive treatment11,12.
The association of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 and CD8 T-cells with milder disease suggests that both Tcell subsets play a role in protective immunity2. Indeed, the relative scarcity of naïve T-cells in individuals
over 65 years old and the connection between ageing and impaired adaptive immune responses to SARSCoV-2 has been suggested as a major cause of severe disease2. Analysis of immune cells in
bronchoalveolar fluid from patients with COVID-19 showed that moderate disease correlated with highly
clonally expanded CD8 T-cells13. Acute phase SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cells displaying a highly activated
cytotoxic phenotype were present in antibody-seronegative exposed family members indicating that they
may be capable of eliminating infection prior to induction of humoral immunity7 and it has been suggested
that strong antibody responses but weak CD8 T-cell responses could contribute to acute COVID-19
pathogenesis and severity1,14. Depletion of CD8 T-cells in convalescent non-human primates reduced the
protective efficacy of natural immunity against SARS-CoV-2 rechallenge15 suggesting CD8 T-cells in the
upper respiratory tract may play a similar protective role in humans. Given the importance of CD8 T-cells

to adaptive immune protection against COVID-19, we set out to examine dominant T-cell responses to
SARS-CoV-2 through the most prevalent major histocompatibility complex (MHC) allele in humans, HLA
A*02 16. HLA A*02 is an MHC class I molecule and presents processed intracellular protein antigens at
the cell surface in the form of short peptides 8-10 amino acids in length for inspection by CD8 T-cells.
SARS CoV-2 infection induces T-cells that recognise peptides derived from a range of viral proteins with
enrichment for those that respond to Spike, nucleocapsid, membrane, ORF1ab and ORF3a7,8,17-19.
Unbiased screening of nine HLA A*0201+ convalescent patients (CP) showed that the two biggest and most
frequent CD8 T-cell responses recognised regions of the virus contained within ORF1ab residues 3,8813,900 and Spike residues 261-28019. The dominant Spike epitope was narrowed down to residues 269-277
(YLQPRTFLL) and T-cells that responded to this peptide represented >1 in 10,000 total CD8 T-cells in
many HLA A*0201+ CP with the majority of the nine donors using a TCR made with the TRAV-12-1 gene,
suggesting a potential shared or ‘public’ response19. Another study found that YLQPRTFLL was the most
frequently recognised of 13 reported HLA A*02:01-restricted epitopes (responses in 16/17 HLA A*0201+
CP studied)10. TCR sequencing of HLA A*02:01-YLQPRTFLL tetramer+ cells revealed prominent CDR3
motifs that were shared across individuals and confirmed the general TRAV-12-1 dominance9. TCRβ
repertoire analyses also indicates that CD8 T-cell responses to the Spike 265-277 region containing the
YLQPRTFLL epitope dominate responses to Spike in both CP and individuals vaccinated with ‘singleshot’ Ad26.5.COV2.S vaccine in the US irrespective of HLA type20. We reasoned that if SARS-CoV-2
were to exhibit escape from CD8 T-cells then this would most likely first occur within a dominant T-cell
response restricted by the most frequent HLA in the population. We therefore focussed our attention on
residues 269-277 of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and found that the most prevalent mutation in this Tcell epitope, YLQLRTFLL (P272L change indicated in bold underlined text), was not recognised by any
of the >120 TCRs that responded to the founder epitope (YLQPRTFLL) across a cohort of nine HLA
A*02+ CP. We also found sizeable populations of CD8 T-cells that stained with peptide-HLA A*02
multimers bearing the YLQPRTFLL peptide in a cohort of individuals that had been vaccinated against
SARS-CoV-2. These cells could not be stained by reagents manufactured with the P272L variant
suggesting that this variant escapes from vaccine induced T-cell responses.
RESULTS
Emergence of mutations in the YLQPRTFLL CD8 T-cell epitope
The previously unprecedented genome-sequencing efforts for SARS-CoV-2 and sequencing of over
400,000 genomes in the United Kingdom to date (>45% of the global effort) has allowed detailed analyses
and identification of over a thousand UK transmission lineages, with some variants associating with higher
viral loads and increased transmission fitness21,22. We examined the global dataset sequenced as of January
31, 2021 and performed focussed analyses on the dominant Spike epitope at residues 269-277 (Figures 1,
2 and Supplementary Figures 1). Within our dataset, we used ancestral state reconstruction to estimate
the number of independent amino acid substitutions that have occurred in this region from sequenced data

collected from the beginning of the pandemic to January 31, 2021. This analysis identified at least 24
different amino acid changes in this region, 22 of which were seen six or fewer times. The two variants
resulting in the largest number of cases both occurred at position 272 (P272L and P272H). The P272H
mutation occurred prior to onward transmission that resulted in 26 sequenced cases while P272L prior to
onward transmission that led to an international cluster comprising over a thousand sequenced cases
(Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure 1). The P272L mutation occurred on a background of the B.1.177
lineage (Figure 1). B.1.177 is characterised by the lineage defining Spike mutation A222V and was shown
to have arisen in Spain, and to have been exported to Europe and the wider world through travel over the
summer of 202023. B.1.177 was responsible for numerous local outbreaks in the autumn of 2020 in the UK
and was a key lineage in establishing the ‘second wave’ of SARS-CoV-2 in the UK and Europe. The
genomic data indicates that the first sequenced occurrence of P272L in any lineage was identified in March
2020, occurring in lineages B1 and B.1.1.263 before emerging in the B.1.177 background, with the first
sequenced case of B.1.177 with P272L being reported in June 2020. Following its emergence, P272L in
B.1.177 has been sequenced from cases in 29 countries, implying extensive spread over the summer and
autumn of 2020 (Figures 1&2 and Supplementary Figure 1 and 2). The B.1.177 sub-lineage carrying
P272L was likely to have been imported into the UK in June, shortly after it was first observed
(Supplementary Figure 1) and has spread extensively since then becoming the 4th most frequent Spike
variant in B.1.177 (Figure 1). Predominance of the B.1.177 P272L variant was higher in the South East of
the UK and was present in 678/4,317 (~16%) of all B.1.177 genomes sequenced from Greater London
between March 7 2020 and January 31 2021. Although this lineage was ultimately suppressed by nonpharmaceutical interventions in the UK following the identification of B.1.1.7, up until December 2020
B.1.177 with P272L showed growth in multiple parts of the UK (Figure 1). Although global frequency
counts are skewed by the emergence of variants such as B.1.1.7 and variable sequencing globally, in
absolute terms P272L was in the top 15 Spike mutations observed globally as of January 31, 2021
(Supplementary Figure 2) and this variant has arisen independently at least 4 further times in other
lineages (Figure 1c).
The P272L Spike variant is not recognised by YLQPRTFLL-specific CD8 T-cells from convalescent
patients
In order to study the impact of mutation in the YLQPRTFLL epitope we recruited a cohort of SARS-CoV2 convalescent local healthcare workers during June 2020. Each had a history of COVID-19 symptoms and
a positive nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR >28 days prior to sample collection. 15/30
donors tested (50%) were HLA A*02+ by antibody staining. Nine of the first ten HLA A*02+ CP we
screened had CD8 T-cells that stained with A*02:01-YLQPRTFLL tetramer (example in Figure 3a),
confirming the widespread response to this epitope seen in previous studies10,19. Bulk sorting of tetramer+
populations was used to generate a T-cell line from each of the nine CP initially screened. These lines all
responded to YLQPRTFLL peptide (13-53% total cells) but completely failed to respond to YLQLRTFLL
peptide (Figure 3b and Supplementary Figure 3a) despite this sequence showing improved binding to

HLA A*02 compared to the parental (Wuhan) sequence (Supplementary Figure 3b). The ability of the
YLQLRTFLL peptide to bind to HLA A*02 was confirmed during tetramer production (Supplementary
Figure 3c). TCR sequencing of the A*02:01-YLQPRTFLL tetramer+ T-cells in each line identified 121
different TCRs across the seven patients including the public TCR chains previously identified in addition
to many donor-specific TCR sequences (Figure 3c and Supplementary Figure 4). Remarkably, these data
indicate that all the TCRs failed to respond to the P272L variant sequence and suggests that the proline at
residue 272 plays a critical role in recognition by all TCRs across this cohort. Failure to recognise the
P272L mutant or bind to this sequence was confirmed by direct ex vivo staining of PBMC (Figure 3A) and
by using four different CP-derived T-cell clones (Figure 4). We further confirmed that surrogate infected
cells expressing full-length Spike protein with the P272L substitution (Supplementary Figure 5) were not
recognised by any of these T-cell clones (Figure 4). We conclude that P272L has arisen on multiple
occasions (appearing to show selection in the B.1.177 background) and escapes from all TCRs raised
against the parental (Wuhan) sequence that is being used in all current vaccines.
The P272L Spike variant is not recognised by YLQPRTFLL-specific CD8 T-cells from vaccinees
We next examined responses to YLQPRTFLL in individuals who had been vaccinated against SARSCoV-2. In total, PBMC from four HLA A*02+ healthy donors (HD) who had received a single dose of the
AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine24 and a further three HD who received the Pfizer-BioNTech
BNT162b2 vaccine25 (see Materials and Methods for donor and vaccination details) were stained with
peptide-HLA tetramers. All vaccinees had HLA A*02-YLQPRTFLL tetramer staining T-cells that
accounted for between 0.01 and 0.2% of total CD8 T-cells (Figure 5). In all cases, these T-cells failed to
stain with the HLA A*02-YLQLRTFLL (P272L) reagent in parallel assays, indicating that the TCR on
these T-cells did not strongly engage this sequence in accordance with the CP cohort data (Figure 5). We
conclude that the YLQPRTFLL-specific T-cells induced by two current COVID vaccines fail to engage to
the P272L variant sequence.
DISCUSSION
Emerging evidence indicates that HLA-I-restricted CD8 ‘killer’ T-cells contribute to the control of SARSCoV-2 and the immunity to disease offered by the currently approved vaccines1,2. Individual HLA-I alleles
can be associated with increased likelihood of control or progression of disease with viruses such as HIV26.
The immune pressure of prevalent host CD8 T-cell responses against HIV results in selection of altered
viral sequences and viral immune escape27-29. We were interested in whether there was evidence that
SARS-CoV-2 might also escape from CD8 T-cells. Genome sequencing has shown extensive nonsynonymous mutations occurred within the SARS-CoV-2 genome during 2020. Some of these mutations
alter viral fitness30 while others have been shown to diminish the binding of antibodies31. To date, there
has been limited study of T-cell escape and a broad brush-approach of examining T-cell recognition of key
transmission variants failed to reveal any evidence that escape was occurring32. A recent report
demonstrated that mutations in the RBD that enhance angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)2 binding and

viral infectivity concomitantly reduce T-cell recognition through HLA*24:02 33. Another study showed
that some SARS-CoV-2 mutations in HLA-I-restricted epitopes resulted in lower binding to the HLA
leading to reduced recognition by CD8 T-cells but there was little evidence of these mutations being
disseminated34. It has been suggested that the L270F (YFQPRTFLL) variant might be an escape mutant34,
but this variant was only seen six times throughout our study period, in six different locations and five
different PANGO lineages. From our data, this would suggest that while this mutation does arise, there is
no evidence of spread of this variant following sporadic emergence across multiple different SARS-CoV-2
lineages.
We reasoned that if escape were to occur then it would be most likely to be seen in a prevalent response
through a frequent HLA. HLA A*02 is frequently carried by all human populations except those of recent
African ancestry where it is present at lower levels. HLA A*02 is believed to be the most frequent HLA-I
in the human population worldwide occurring in ~40% of individuals16. HLA A*02 is hypothesized to have
become so frequent in the population due to its success at presenting well-recognised epitopes from
historically dangerous pathogens, a supposition consistent with this HLA having entered the population via
interbreeding with Neanderthals and Denisovans after early humans migrated from Africa35. A previous
study used overlapping peptides from the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome to identify that the most common
HLA A*02-restricted responses in CP were to epitopes contained within peptides spanning residues 3,8813900 of ORF1ab and 261-280 of Spike19. The Spike epitope was narrowed down to residues 269-277;
sequence YLQPRTFLL. A further study confirmed the prevalence of CD8 T-cells that respond to
YLQPRTFLL in CP that are absent in healthy donor blood taken before the spread of SARS-CoV-2 10. We
confirmed the prevalence of responses to this epitope in our cohort where responses were observed in 9/10
HLA A*02+ CP tested and all 7/7 SARS-CoV-2 vaccinees including those who had received only the first
dose of a double dose schedule.
We reasoned that if escape from CD8 T-cells were to occur, then it would most likely be seen in a
dominant epitope restricted by the most frequent HLA-I in the population so focussed our attention on
nonsynonymous mutations in the sequence encoding YLQPRTFLL. While at least 24 different amino acid
changes have occurred in this region, only two were seen in more than six sequenced cases in the period
from the beginning of the pandemic to January 31st, 2021. The two variants resulting in the largest number
of cases both occurred at position 272 with the P272L mutation occurring in over 8,500 sequenced cases as
of June 1st, 2021. The P272L variant arose in 5 different lineages during the study period but was most
prevalent in the B.1.177 lineage that played a key role in establishing the ‘second wave’ of SARS-CoV-2
in the UK and Europe during the Autumn of 2020. P272L was the 4th most common variant seen in the
B.1.177 lineage and its descendants and in the top 15 Spike mutations observed globally to January 31,
2021. Nine of ten of our HLA A*02+ CP cohort tested made a response to the YLQPRTFLL epitope; a
response comprising >120 different TCRs in total. Remarkably, no response was seen to the P272L
variant. This finding was confirmed using four CP-derived T-cell clones that included TCR α or β chains

that have previously been described in other CP cohorts10,19. Responses to the YLQPRTFLL epitope in a
cohort of HLA A*02+ healthy donors who had been vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 but had never had
symptoms or a positive test since January 2020 ranged from 0.01-0.2% of CD8 T-cells by peptide-HLA
staining. However, all of the T-cells raised against the YLQPRTFLL epitope across our vaccinee cohort
expressed TCRs that engaged the P272L very poorly and did not stain with P272L peptide-HLA tetramers.
It may seem surprising that YLQPRTFLL-specific TCRs, >120 in total across our CP cohort and likely
many more in the vaccinees, all fail to engage the P272L variant when a widely polyclonal response to Tcell antigens should prevent widespread escape of this nature. The widespread failure to engage the P272L
variant likely reflects the nature of the amino acid substitution involved. Substitution of a proline in the
middle of an HLA-I-restricted T-cell epitope is likely to be a particularly drastic change in terms of TCR
recognition as residues 4-6 in a 9-mer peptide often stand proud of the HLA-I peptide binding groove to
provide an obvious focal point for host TCRs36. This can be especially true for the ringed imino acid
proline. We have previously demonstrated that the proline at position 5 in the HLA A*02:01-restricted 10mer preproinsulin-derived epitope ALWGPDPAAA associated with type 1 diabetes is critical for
recognition by patient-derived TCRs37,38. Subsequent structural analyses showed how this proline stands
proud like the “cherry on a cake” to provide ~70% of the binding energy between the ALWGPDPAAA
preproinsulin epitope and a cognate patient-derived TCR39,40. We predict that the proline at position 4
within the predominant HLA A*02-restricted SARS-CoV-2 epitope might also represent the most obvious
docking point for host TCRs in the 9-mer YLQPRTFLL epitope although this awaits structural
confirmation. If, as we expect, the proline at position 4 represents the major TCR docking platform this
would explain why the loss of this one residue results in such widespread escape from YLQPRTFLLspecific T-cells across all donors in our study.
SARS-CoV-2 variants have been rapidly emerging throughout the current pandemic with mutants that
enhance transmissibility, evade host immunity or increase disease severity being of particular concern.
Current systems for identifying variants of public health concern involve risk assessments that identify
mutations that are present, and then looks for mutations that have a known biological effect in order to
assess their significance. While extensive amounts of work have been undertaken to predict and
characterise the likely effects of mutations in Spike on antibody recognition, the same is not true for Tcells. Current risk assessments that only consider antibody affinity and factors associated with
transmissibility (e.g. mutations that improve cellular infectivity) are clearly incomplete. The range of
potential effects of mutations that affect recognition by T-cells is significant, and urgently requires further
study. It is clear that there was a significant outbreak that spanned Europe of a lineage carrying a mutation
that we have shown has a detectable impact on T-cell recognition, which went unrecognised at the time.
Ultimately, it is unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 incorporates enough genetic plasticity to allow it to escape
from humoral immune responses. However, the area targeted on the RBD by neutralising antibodies is
large enough, and the range of epitopes targeted in polyclonal human sera broad enough, to ensure that no
single mutation should allow complete escape from neutralisation in the majority of individuals41.

Likewise, the wide array of HLA across the population16 and the broad range of epitopes responded to in
COVID-19 patients18 combine to make it unlikely that SARS-CoV-2 will completely escape from T-cell
surveillance in the near future. During the early stages of the pandemic, it seems likely that alterations in
SARS-CoV-2 Spike that enhance binding to ACE2 or reduce the capability of vaccine-induced, or natural,
antibodies to neutralise the virus will take precedence due to their potential relevance in all transmission
events. This ‘shrouding effect’ may well have occurred in the UK SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, although this is
difficult to fully assess for two reasons. First, the B.1.1.7 lineage has been shown to have a significantly
higher transmissibility compared to B.1.177 (and other circulating lineages occurring in the Autumn and
Winter of 2020)42, and so while P272L may have conferred some advantage, this is likely to have been
insufficient to prevent the lineage being replaced by B.1.1.7. Also, it is important to note that the trajectory
of P272L B.1.177 isolates was generally upwards going into the Winter of 2020, however the introduction
of significant non-pharmaceutical interventions in response to B.1.1.7 resulted in a strong suppression of
all SARS-CoV-2 lineages in the UK. It remains to be seen whether the P272L mutant will arise and show
selection in other lineages. However, since this mutation has occurred in several variants already, we
predict that it will appear in future variants. Our data suggests that the 269-277 epitope of Spike is one
region that should be monitored and should feature in risk assessments by public health agencies going
forward.
In summary, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 can readily alter its Spike protein via a single amino acid
substitution so that it is not recognised by CD8 T-cells targeting the most prevalent epitope in Spike
restricted by the most common HLA-I across the population. While it is not possible to directly attribute
the emergence and propagation of the Spike P272L SARS-CoV-2 variant in parts of the UK where HLA
A*02 is frequently expressed to CD8 T-cell-mediated selection pressure, specific focussing of immune
protection on a single protein (e.g. SARS-CoV-2 Spike favoured by all currently approved vaccines43) is
likely to enhance any tendency for escape at predominant T-cell epitopes like YLQPRTFLL. Our
demonstration that mutations that evade immunodominant T-cell responses through population-frequent
HLA can readily arise and disseminate, strongly suggests that it will be prudent to monitor such
occurrences and to increase the breadth of next generation SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to incorporate other
viral proteins.

METHODS
SARS-CoV-2 lineage dynamics
To characterise the distribution of mutations in the Spike epitope between positions 269-277, we
performed a set of analyses making use of high quality publicly available sequence data made available by
GISAID and COG-UK as of 31 January 202144. To generate an estimate of the number of times mutations
have occurred within the epitope, we performed ACCTRAN45 ancestral state reconstruction using gotree
(available at https://github.com/evolbioinfo/gotree), on a tree with 200 221 taxa, generated by COG-UK
(COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK), 2020), for each Spike protein site. Subtree groups were identified
by nodes with a consensus to variant transition. The phylogenetic tree for visualising variants at position
272 comprises 1227 taxa, and was generated from an alignment of consensus genome sequences using
mafft version 7.475, with ambiguous/problematic positions masked following46 using v4 of the
problematic sites vcf (available here: https://github.com/W-L/ProblematicSites_SARSCoV2/blob/master/archived_vcf/problematic_sites_sarsCov2.2020-12-22-11:15.vcf). The tree was built
using IQ-TREE47, with a HKY+G model48, 1000 ultrafast bootstrap replicates49, and rooted using Wuhan
isolate MN908947.3 as an outgroup. Tree drawing was performed with ggtree50. Information on case
location (country, from GISAID and local authority from the COG-UK public data) and variant frequency
by PANGO lineage was collated from GISAID and COG-UK and these were then visualised using R
version 4.0.5.
Convalescent COVID patients
All participant samples were pseudo-anonymised and the clinical Chief Investigator, Dr Lucy C Jones, was
the only individual with access to the confidential record linking sample numbers to identifying
information. Pseudo-anonymised sample numbers were not known to participants or to anyone outside of
the research group. Our CP study was given a favourable opinion by the Health Research Authority (HRA)
Research Ethics Committee London – (Brighton & Sussex), IRAS (Integrated Research Application
System for HRA) 269506 and was also reviewed by Healthcare Research Wales and Cwm Taf
Morgannwg University Health board, with research permissions granted.
Eligible participants were recruited during March-June 2020 and were adult (over 18) convalescent
healthcare workers at Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board. Inclusion criteria included a positive
nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR, more than 28 days prior to blood sample collection. In
addition to having had a positive SARS-CoV-2 swab test, all participants fulfilled the criteria for a definite
diagnosis of COVID-19 at least 28 days prior to recruitment, defined by at least one of the following: new
onset of pyrexia, a continuous cough, anosmia, or ageusia. ‘M’ and ‘F’ of the patient code denotes male or
female, with 3 males and 7 females used for this study. Venous blood samples (50mls) were collected from
37 informed and consented participants. This was stored in EDTA for up to 3 hours and transported in
UN3373 containers to the laboratory. Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) were collected and
frozen on the same day. All human blood was procured and handled in accordance with the guidelines of

Cardiff University to conform to the United Kingdom Human Tissue Act 2004. HLA A*02 typing was
performed by flow cytometry using anti-HLA A2 antibody (BB7.2, BioLegend, San Diego, CA, US). Of
the nine HLA A*0201+ patients seven had mild disease and two had moderate disease in accordance with
the US National Institutes of Health classification. None of the participants required treatment with
invasive ventilation support. The 3 male and 6 female participants studied had ages ranging from 30 to 60
years and a median age of 50 years. Peripheral blood was collected between 6 and 13 weeks after the
positive PCR swab (median 12 weeks).
SARS-CoV-2 vaccinees
We recruited six participants who had received one dose of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine as part of the National
UK vaccination programme, under ethical approval (Central University Research Ethics Committee
(CUREC), University of Oxford, Approval Reference: R71346/RE001). Inclusion criteria for participants
included: no clinical history of symptoms of COVID-19 since January 2020, no history of a positive
COVID swab or positive COVID antibody test. Exclusion criteria of participants included: immunological
conditions which directly affect immune responses, current or recent medications which directly affect
immune responses, recent history of a transfusion of blood products and pregnancy. Peripheral blood (50
mls) was collected between 28 to 60 days after receiving one dose of a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 as
indicated in Table 1 and processed withing 4 hours of sampling. Participants received either the
Astrazeneca (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) vaccine or the Pfizer (BNT162b2 2) vaccine. Healthy donor 0439 was a
colleague who received the BNT162b2 vaccine25 and volunteered a sample on day 14 following the second
vaccine dose having heard that we were studying immune escape. Donor 0439 was the only donor to have
undergone a full vaccination course as indicated in Table 1. The three male and four female donors had
ages ranging from 41 to 75 years and a median age of 57 years.

PBMCs and cell lines
PBMC isolation from CPs and a healthy vaccinated donor was performed by standard density
centrifugation using Histopaque-1077 (Merck Group, Darmstadt, Germany). Cell lines were cultured on
the basis of ATCC guidelines: immortalized embryonic kidney cell HEK293T (CRL-1573TM); lung
carcinoma A549 (CCL-185 TM) and T2 (CRL-1992TM). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (A549 and T2)
or DMEM (HEK293T) medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine and 100 U/mL
penicillin and 100 µg/mL streptomycin (R10 or D10 respectively; all from Merck Group). Adherent cell
lines were cultured as adherent monolayers, passaged when 50–80% confluent using D-PBS (Merck
Group) with 2 mM EDTA to detach cells. T2s were cultured as suspension cells and split 1:10 twice
weekly. Cells were regularly tested for mycoplasma contamination (MycoAlertTM, Lonza).
Generation of T-cell lines and clones
T-cells were cultured in R10 supplemented with 25 ng/ml interleukin IL-15 (Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch
Gladbach, Germany), 20 or 200 IU/mL IL-2 (Proleukin®; Prometheus, San Diego, CA), 1X non-essential
amino acids solution, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 10 mM HEPES buffer (all from Merck Group unless
stated otherwise). T-cells from patients recognising Wuhan-YLQPRTFLL were isolated from whole
PBMCs using PE conjugated Wuhan-YLQPRTFLL peptide-HLA tetramers and magnetic anti-PE beads
according to the manufacturer’s guidelines (Miltenyi Biotec) and as previously described51,52. For donors
M001, F012 and F021 a bulk T-cell library was firstly created using magnetically purified CD8 T-cells
(Miltenyi Biotec) and CD3/CD28 Dynabeads according to the manufacturer’s instructions (ThermoFisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA, US). After 2 weeks of expansion with CD3/CD28 beads, Wuhan-YLQPRTFLL
PE tetramers and anti-PE beads were used as above to enrich antigen specific T-cells. Tetramer enriched
cells were allowed to culture overnight and then expanded with irradiated (3100 cGy) allogeneic PBMCs
from three donors purchased from the Welsh Blood Service, and 1 µg/mL of L-phytohemagglutinin (Pan
Biotech, GmbH, Am Gewerbepark 6, 94501 Aidenbach, Germany). Cloning was performed as previously
described53. Briefly, tetramer enriched T-cell lines were cloned by plating 0.5, 1 or 3 cells per well in 96Uwell plates with 5 x104 irradiated PBMCs and PHA as above.
Flow cytometry and cell sorting
For surface staining, typically 5 x104 cells per condition were used. T-cells were stained with
LIVE/DEAD™ fixable violet dead stain (ThermoFisher Scientific) and CD3 (BW264/56) and CD8α
(BW135/80) antibodies (all from Miltenyi Biotec). Cells were gated on FSC-A versus SSC-A, single cells
(FSC-A versus FSC-H), then viable cells (marker of choice versus VIVID). Samples were acquired on a
FACSCantoII machine (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and analyzed in the FlowJo software
(Tree Star Inc., Ashland, Oregon, US). Cell sorting was performed on SONY MA900 multi-application
cell sorter (SONY, San Jose, CA, USA).

Lentivirus production and transduction
Lentiviral particles were generated by transient co-transfection of HEK293T cells with a 3rd generation
plasmid system. Briefly, codon-optimised Wuhan Spike, P272L Spike (site directed mutagenesis of
Wuhan Spike, details below) and HLA A*0201 genes were synthesised (Genewiz, Essex, UK) and cloned
into a 3rd generation lentiviral plasmids. Spike genes were designed with a rCD2 co-marker: Xba1-KozakSpike-Xho1-P2A-rCD2-Sal1-Stop, and cloned in to pSF (Oxgene, Oxford Genetics Ltd, Littlemore,
Oxford, UK). The pSF plasmid was modified by removal of a Xho1 site present in the plasmid backbone
and insertion of stop codons after the Sal1 site. HLA A2 was cloned in to pELNS (Kind gift from James
Riley): Xba1-Kozak-HLA A2-Stop-Xho1. For transfection, pSF or pELNS (1.52 μg), envelope plasmid
(pMD2.G; 0.72 μg) and packaging plasmids (pMDLg/pRRE; 1.83μg and pRSV-REV; 1.83μg) were mixed
in 300 μL of Opti-MEM, reduced serum medium (ThermoFisher Scientific) followed by mixing with 1
μg/μl Polyethylenimine (PEI; Merck Group) at a 3:1 PEI: plasmid ratio. Plasmid/PEI mixtures were
incubated at room temperature for 15 min, added dropwise to the HEK293T cells (80% confluence in one
well of a 6-well plate) and incubated at 37°C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. The supernatants
containing lentiviral vectors were harvested, 0.4 μm filtered, and used immediately for transduction or
stored at -80°C and only defrosted once before transduction. A549 cells were transduced by spinfection
with viral supernatant at 400g for 2 h, incubated at 37°C overnight and media was replaced the following
morning. HLA A2 transduction was confirmed by staining with BB7.2 Ab. Spike transduced cells were
firstly checked for with conjugated anti-rCD2 antibody (OX-34, BioLegend), then in follow-up
experiments with 1 μg/test of unconjugated anti-SARS Spike glycoprotein antibody (1A9, Abcam,
Cambridge, MA, US). An unconjugated isotype matched antibody (P.3.6.2.8.1, eBiosciences,
ThermoFisher Scientific) was used as a control. A goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (multiple adsorbed
PE conjugated Ig polyclonal; BD Biosciences, Oxford, UK) was used to detect Spike antibody staining.
Site directed mutagenesis of the Wuhan Spike gene
Oligonucleotides were designed to substitute the Proline to a Leucine at position 272. Non-overlapping
sequences were designed so that the 5’ end of the forward oligo (5'
TGAGAACCTTCCTGCTGAAGTACAACG 3’) started with the nucleotides to be mutated and included
at least 20 complementary nucleotides on the 3’ side of the mutation. The reverse oligo
(5' GCTGCAGGTAGCCCACATAGTAAG 3') was designed in the other direction so that the 5’ end
annealed back-to-back with the forward oligo. Oligonucleotides were purchased via the Eurofins
Genomics Website (Luxembourg, EU). PCR was performed using Phusion HF PCR Master Mix
(ThermoFisher Scientific). Cycling conditions were performed according to manufacturer instructions,
except elongation which was done at 1 min/kb. PCR products sizes were verified by running samples on
1% agarose gel. Correctly amplified products were treated by Kinase-Ligase-Dpn1 (KLD) enzyme mix
(New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were then
transformed into XL10-Gold Ultracompetent cells (Agilent Technologies Santa Clara, CA, US) by heat
shock and cells were plated on LB-Agar plate with Carbenicillin antibiotic (50 µL/mL; ThermoFisher

T-cell activation assays
Prior to assays, T-cells were rested in R5 (as for R10 with 5% FBS) for 24 h before setting-up any
activation assay to help reduce spontaneous activation. Typically, 3 x104 T-cells and 6 x104 target cells
were used per well in R5 in a 96U well and incubated overnight, with supernatants collected for an ELISA
(MIP-1β), which was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (R&D Systems) using half
area ELISA plates. For TNFα-processing inhibitor (TAPI)-0 (Merck Group) assays, T-cells and target
cells were co-incubated for 4 h with 30 μM TAPI-0 (Sigma, UK), antibody directed against TNF (clone
cA2, Miltenyi Biotec) and CD107a antibody (clone H4A3, BD Biosciences) to detect activation-induced
degranulation of cytotoxic T-cells. Following co-incubation, cells were washed and stained with Fixable
Live/Dead Violet Dye VIVID and antibodies against appropriate cell surface markers as above.
Peptide-MHC tetramer production and staining
Peptide-HLA-A*02:01 tetramers were produced and used to stain cells as previously described54. Briefly
tetramers were assembled from monomers via the step-wise addition of PE-conjugated streptavidin
(ThermoFisher Scientific) at a peptide-MHC:streptavidin molar ratio of 4:1. Protease Inhibitor (Merck
Group) and PBS were added to give a final peptide-MHC tetramer concentration of 0.1 mg/ml (with regard
to the peptide-MHC component). Following assembly, 0.5 μg of tetramer (with respect to the peptideMHC component) was used to stain 5 x104 of a T cell clone and 4 x106 PBMCs. T-cell clones were stained
from culture, COVID-19 patient PBMCs from cryopreserved samples and vaccinee PBMCs from freshly
drawn blood. An optimised tetramer staining protocol involving pre-incubation with 50 nM protein kinase
inhibitor, Dasatinib (Axon Medchem, Reston, VA, USA) and unconjugated anti-PE antibody (PE001,
BioLegend) was used as described previously55-57. Following tetramer staining, T-cells were stained with
LIVE/DEAD™ fixable violet dead stain (ThermoFisher Scientific), anti-CD3 and anti-CD8 antibody and
analysed using flow cytometry as above. PBMCs were also stained with anti-CD14 (M5E2, BioLegend)
and anti-CD19 (HIB19, BioLegend) pacific blue conjugated antibodies to create a ‘dump’ channel for dead
cells.

HLA A2 peptide binding assay
T2 cells were plated in a 96U-well plate (2 ×104 per well) in serum-free media. Wuhan-YLQPRTFLL and
P272L variant-YLQLRTFLL Peptides (Peptide Protein Research, Fareham, UK) were added at 100 μM
concentrations; alongside a negative control peptide HPVGEADYFEY from EBV that binds HLA
B*35:01. The percentage volume of DMSO was matched in each condition. Cells were then incubated
overnight at room temperature. The following day, cells were stained with anti-HLA A2 antibody (clone
BB7.2, BioLegend) and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. Cells were then washed in PBS and stained with
LIVE/DEAD™ fixable violet dead stain (ThermoFisher Scientific) and analysed using flow cytometry.
TCR sequencing
TCR sequencing was performed as previously described58. RNA extraction was carried out using the
RNEasy Micro kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). cDNA was synthesized using the 5′/3′ SMARTer kit
(Takara Bio, Paris, France). The SMARTer approach used a Murine Moloney Leukaemia Virus (MMLV)
reverse transcriptase, a 3′ oligo-dT primer and a 5′ oligonucleotide to generate cDNA templates flanked by
a known, universal anchor sequence at the 5′. PCR was then set up using a single primer pair consisting of
TRAC or TRBC-specific reverse primer and an anchor-specific forward primer (Takara Bio, Paris,
France). All samples were used for the following PCR reaction: 2.5 μL template cDNA, 0. 5 μL High
Fidelity Phusion Taq polymerase, 10 μL 5X Phusion buffer, 0.5 μL DMSO, 1 μL dNTP Mix (10 mM each)
(all from ThermoFisher Scientific, UK), 1 μL of TRAC or TRBC-specific primer (10 μM), 5 μL of 10X
anchor-specific UPM primer (Takara Bio, Paris, France), and nuclease-free water for a final reaction
volume of 50 μL (cycling conditions: 5 min at 94°C, 30 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 30 s at 63°C for alpha
chains or 30 s at 66°C for beta chains, 120 s at 72°C). Subsequently, 5 μL of the first PCR products were
taken out to set up a nested PCR as above, using 1 μL of a nested primer pair (10 μM). All nested primers
were flanked with Illumina indexes (cycling conditions: 5 min at 94°C, 30 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 30 s at
62°C, 120 s at 72°C, and a final 10 min at 72°C). The final PCR products were loaded on a 1% agarose gel
and purified with the Monarch® gel extraction kit (New England Biolabs). Purified products were
sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq instrument using the MiSeq v2 reagent kit (Illumina, Cambridge, UK).
Sequence analysis was performed using MiXCR software (v3.0.7)59. Public TCR clonotypes were
identified using the VDJdb database60.
Data display
Unless stated otherwise, all data were displayed using GraphPad Prism software. TCR V-J usage plots
were generated using VDJ tools61.
