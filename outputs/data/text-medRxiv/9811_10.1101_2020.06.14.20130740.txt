Abstract

To investigate the association of real-time/observed ozone/PM2.5 levels with COVID-19
prevalence/fatality, meta-regression of data from the Northeast megalopolis was
conducted.

Daily Air Quality Index (AQI) values based on available ozone/PM2.5 data

in these counties/cities (3/15/2020–5/31/2020) were extracted from US Environmental
Protection Agency and World Air Quality Project.

In each county/city, total confirmed

COVID-19 cases/deaths (5/31/2020) were available from Johns Hopkins Coronavirus
Resource Center, and total population was extracted from US Census Bureau.

Introduction

Air quality defined by ozone/particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5)/PM10/CO/SO2/NO2/etc. has
been known to affect pulmonary/cardiac diseases.

In the recent coronavirus disease

2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a few studies1-4 suggest that air quality also may militate
against COVID-19 prevalence/case fatality.

To investigate the association of real-

time/observed (neither historical nor estimated) ozone/PM2.5 levels with COVID-19
prevalence/fatality, meta-regression (considering a county/city as a study in metaanalysis and weighted by inverse variance of prevalence/fatality) of data from the
Northeast megalopolis (including >50-million folks, >15% of US total population) was
conducted.

Methods

Five Combined Statistical Areas in the Northeast megalopolis comprise 111
counties/cities.

Daily Air Quality Index (AQI) values based on available ozone/PM2.5

data in these counties/cities (3/15/2020, beginning of rapid increase of new COVID-19
cases, to 5/31/2020) were extracted from US Environmental Protection Agency
(https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data/air-data-daily-air-quality-tracker)
World Air Quality Project (https://aqicn.org/city/usa/newyork/).

was extracted from US Census Bureau (https://www.census.gov/acs/www/data/datatables-and-tools/data-profiles/).

Random-effects meta-regression was performed using

OpenMetaAnalyst (http://www.cebm.brown.edu/openmeta/index.html).

A meta-

regression graph depicted COVID-19 prevalence (defined as total cases divided by total
population) and fatality (defined as total deaths divided by total cases) (plotted as
logarithm-transformed prevalence/fatality on the y-axis) as a function of mean
ozone/PM2.5 AQI during 3/15/2020–5/31/2020 (plotted on the x-axis).

Results

Coefficients were not statistically significant for ozone (P = 0.212/0.814 for
prevalence/fatality; Fig. 1A/1B) and PM2.5 (P = 0.986/0.499; Fig. 1C/1D), which would
indicate that COVID-19 prevalence/fatality was unaffected by ozone/PM2.5.

Although

multivariable analysis had been planned, it was not performed because of non-significant
covariates of interest in the univariable model.

Discussion

The present meta-regression suggests no association of real-time/observed ozone/PM2.5
with COVID-19 prevalence/fatality, which is incompatible with previous findings in
Chinese 3 cities (Wuhan/XiaoGan/HuangGang),1 California state,2 Milan metropolitan
area (Lombardy, Italy),3 and Queens county (NY).4
