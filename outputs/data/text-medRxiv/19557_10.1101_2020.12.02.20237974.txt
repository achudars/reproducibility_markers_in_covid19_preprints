ABSTRACT

Background: Photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) when used isolated or combined with
static magnetic field (PBMT-sMF) has been proven benefits on skeletal muscle increasing
performance and reducing fatigue, increasing oxygen saturation, and modulating inflammatory
process. However, it is unknown whether the effects observed with this therapy on respiratory
muscles will be similar to the effects previously observed on skeletal muscles. Objective: We
aimed to investigate whether PBMT-sMF is able to decrease the length of stay in the intensive
care unit (ICU) and to reduce the mortality rate of patients with severe COVID-19 requiring
invasive mechanical ventilation, increasing the respiratory function and modulating the
inflammatory process. Methods: We conducted a prospectively registered, pragmatic, tripleblinded (patients, therapists and outcome assessors), randomized, placebo-controlled trial of
PBMT-sMF in patients with severe COVID-19, requiring invasive mechanical ventilation,
admitted to the ICU. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either PBMT-sMF (6 sites at
the lower thorax – 189 J total, and 2 sites at the neck area – 63 J total) or placebo PBMT-sMF
daily during all the ICU stay. The primary outcome was length of stay in the ICU defined by
either discharge or death. The secondary outcomes were survival rate, muscle function of
diaphragm, change in blood tests, change in mechanical ventilation parameters and change in
arterial blood gas analysis. Results: A total of 30 patients underwent randomization (with 15
assigned to PBMT-sMF and 15 to placebo) and were analyzed. The length of stay in the ICU
for the placebo group was 23.06 days while for the PBMT-sMF group was 16.26. However,
there was no statistically difference between groups for the length of stay in the ICU (mean
difference - MD = - 6.80; 95% CI = - 18.71 to 5.11). Regarding the secondary outcomes were
observed statistically differences in favor of PBMT-sMF for diaphragm thickness, fraction of
inspired oxygen, partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio, C-reactive
protein, lymphocytes count, and hemoglobin (p<0.05). Conclusion: Among patients with
severe COVID-19 requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, PBMT-sMF was not statistically
different than placebo to the length of stay in the ICU. However, it is important to highlight that
our sample size was underpowered to detect statistical differences to the primary outcome. In
contrast, PBMT-sMF increased muscle function of diaphragm, improved ventilatory
parameters, decreased C-reactive protein levels and hemoglobin count, and increased
lymphocytes count. Trial registration number (Clinical Trials.gov): NCT04386694.

INTRODUCTION

The novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).1 SARS-CoV-2 infection trigger some blood changes
such as leucopenia, lymphopenia, increased prothrombin time, d-dimer and c-reactive protein
(PCR) levels, and increased cytokine levels such as 1L-1 and TNF-.2,3,4 The main clinical
features observed in patients with COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, and fatigue or myalgia;2,5
and can range from no symptoms to severe pneumonia and death.1 Patients with high degree of
severity usually may progress to complications such as dyspnea, hypoxia, acute hypoxaemic
respiratory insufficiency, arrhythmia, acute cardiac injury, and shock.2,5,6 These complications
may require critical care in an intensive care unit (ICU).2,5,7
To date, there is no effective treatment against SARS-CoV-2 infection; therefore,
several therapeutic agents such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine,8 lopinavir-ritonavir,9
remdesevir,10 and dexamethasone,11 often used to treat other medical conditions, have been
tested and used in an attempt to face the COVID-19. The effectiveness of these therapeutic
agents is still conflicting 8-10 and further high quality randomized controlled trials are necessary
to confirm whether the benefits outweigh the harms. However, since there is no robust evidence
about the effects of the available therapeutic agents and there is no effective treatment available
to combat the SARS-CoV-2, it has been necessary to use management strategies of signs and
symptoms in patients with COVID-19, especially in the most severe cases. The respiratory
management of patients with severe COVID-19 in ICUs can be done through oxygen therapy,
non-invasive ventilation and intubation.12 Respiratory failure due to hypoxemia is one of the
most prominent complications in these patients13 and usually requires mechanical ventilation
via an endotracheal tube.14 Acute respiratory failure reduces lung compliance, increases
respiratory work and alters blood oxygenation, leading to a shallow breathing pattern. 15 In
addition, the strength of the respiratory muscles may also be reduced,16 which makes it difficult
to successfully wean patients from mechanical ventilation, besides to contributing to a poorer
clinical trajectory.17,18
Photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) combined with static magnetic field (sMF) has
potential to be a promising non-pharmacological tool in the respiratory management of patients
with severe COVID-19. PBMT is a non-thermal and non-ionizing light therapy applied in the
form of light amplification by the stimulated emission of radiation (LASER), light-emitting
diodes (LEDs), and/or broadband irradiation in the visible and infrared spectra.19 PBMT
increases cellular metabolism20,21 and microcirculation,22 oxygen availability,23,24 redox

metabolism25 and modulates the inflammatory process.26-28 PBMT has been used in
combination with a static magnetic field (sMF),27-30 generating better effects on cell
metabolism.31 Robust evidence has shown that PBMT isolated or combined with sMF (PBMTsMF) has beneficial effects on skeletal muscle, increasing performance and reducing
fatigue,32,33 decreasing performance loss and function in detraining period,30 and increasing
oxygen saturation.23,24 In contrast, there is a lack of evidence about the effects of PBMT or
PBMT-sMF on respiratory muscles and respiratory system in general. To date, there is only
one clinical trial that irradiated PBMT in respiratory muscles of the thorax and neck area. 34 This
study showed the effectiveness of PBMT in improving the functional capacity of patients with
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.34 Furthermore, experimental studies on respiratory
system of animals observed that PBMT is able to modulate the pulmonary inflammation35-37
and relieve bronchial hyperresponsiveness.37
The beneficial effects previously showed added to the lack of adverse effects known to
date, suggest that PBMT-sMF could be a safer alternative to the use of drugs in the treatment
of patients with severe COVID-19. However, it is unknown whether the effects observed with
PBMT (isolated or PBMT-sMF) on respiratory muscles will be similar to the effects previously
observed on skeletal muscles. In addition, it is unknown whether PBMT-sMF can modulate the
inflammatory process in this particular disease and contribute to a clinical improvement of these
patients. Thus, it is necessary to investigate whether PBMT-sMF is able to decrease muscle
fatigue of respiratory muscles and loss of respiratory function, besides of increasing oxygen
saturation, modulating the inflammatory process and, consequently, contributing to general
improvement of patients with severe COVID-19. In addition, it is necessary to investigate
whether these possible benefits of PBMT-sMF can contribute to accelerate the weaning process
of mechanical ventilation and to decrease the length of stay in the ICU of patients with severe
COVID-19. Therefore, we aimed to investigate whether PBMT-sMF is able to decrease the
length of stay in the ICU and to reduce the mortality rate of patients with severe COVID-19
requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, increasing the respiratory function and modulating
the inflammatory process.

METHODS

Trial design
A prospectively registered (NCT04386694), pragmatic, two-arms, parallel randomized,
triple-blinded (patients, therapists and outcome assessors), placebo-controlled trial was

conducted. This study adheres to CONSORT guidelines (Supplement 2) There were two
deviations from the registered protocol. The first one was due our estimation that the endpoint
assessment would be up to 20 days after randomization, because the patients would be
discharged or dead from any cause within this period. However, as the endpoint assessment
directly depended on the length of stay in the ICU, it could take more than 20 days. The second
deviation was regarding the assessment of three secondary outcomes: immunoglobulin G (IgG),
immunoglobulin M (IgM), and D-dimer. These secondary outcomes were not assessed because
the third part laboratory in charge to carry out the blood analysis was not able to implement the
necessary routines before the beginning of this trial.

Ethics
This study was submitted and approved by the Research Ethics Committee of
Associação Dr. Bartholomeu Tacchini/Hospital Tacchini/RS, under protocol number
3,985,226, and by the National Research Ethics Commission from Brazilian Ministry of Health
(protocol number 4,021,485). All patients eligible for the study or patient´s legal representative
(if the patient was too unwell to provide consent) were informed by study assessors of the
objective and all signed the written informed consent before enrollment in the study. Research
personnel were taken all appropriate and customary steps to ensure that data remained secure
and that patient privacy and confidentiality was maintained.

Participants and recruitment
Participants were patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 through RT-PCR
(reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction), admitted to the adult ICU of the Hospital
Tachhini, Bento Gonçalves, Brazil, between May 2020 and July 2020. To be eligible, patients
had to have 15 years or older; requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, through orotracheal
intubation, due to respiratory failure. Patients who had a negative result in the diagnostic
examination for COVID-19 and patients in prone position for more than 24 hours were
excluded. Moreover, cancer patients and pregnant women were also excluded.

Randomization and blinding
Prior to initiation of the treatment, patients were randomized into their respective
intervention groups: active PBMT-sMF or placebo PBMT-sMF. The randomization was
generated by a website (http://randomization.com/) and performed by a participating researcher
not involved with the recruitment, assessment or treatment of patients. This same researcher

was responsible for programming the PBMT-sMF device according to the result of the
randomization, as active or placebo mode. This researcher was instructed not to disclose the
programmed intervention to the assessor, therapist or any of the patients and other researchers
involved in the study until its completion. The assessors, patients and therapists were blinded
throughout the treatment. Concealed allocation was achieved through the use of sequentially
numbered, sealed and opaque envelopes.

Interventions
Patients were randomly allocated to two groups to be submitted to the active PBMTsMF or placebo PBMT-sMF interventions. All patients, regardless of the allocated group,
received standard ICU care associated with the tested intervention (active or placebo PBMTsMF). The active and placebo PBMT-sMF were performed using the same device and the
irradiated sites were the same to both therapies (Figure 1). To ensure blinding for therapists the
device emitted the same sounds and the same information on the display regardless of the
programmed mode (active or placebo). Furthermore, since this technology produces an
undiscernible amount of heat,29 the blindness was not compromised by this aspect.

Patients underwent the treatment (active PBMT-sMF or placebo PBMT-sMF)
according to prior randomization, once a day, during all the ICU stay (after inclusion in the
study), until discharge or death. Specifications of the intervention:
1) Photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) combined with static magnetic field (sMF) (PBMTsMF) - active: PBMT-sMF was performed employing a cordless, portable MR5 Activ Pro
LaserShower™ device (PhotOxyl™ prototype, manufactured by Multi Radiance Medical™,
Solon - OH, USA). PBMT-sMF was irradiated in six sites at the lower thorax/ upper abdominal
cavity and two sites at the neck area (sternocleidomastoid muscle), as illustrated in figure 1.
PBMT-sMF exposure time was 60 seconds per site. The dose used in the lower thorax was
31.50 J per site, totalizing a dose of 189 J. In addition, the dose used in the neck area was 31.50
J per site, totalizing a dose of 63 J. PBMT-sMF dose per site, and the irradiation sites were
established based on the only one previous study that have irradiated respiratory muscles.34
PBMT-sMF was applied using the direct contact method with slight pressure on the skin. The
full description of parameters is provided in table 1.

2) Photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) combined with static magnetic field (sMF) (PBMTsMF) – placebo: The placebo intervention was delivered using the same device than active
PBMT-sMF but without any emission of therapeutic dose. In the placebo mode, the infrared
laser diodes, the infrared LED diodes, and the sMF were deactivated (turned off), and the power
of the red LED diodes were decreased to 0.5 mW (mean power for each diode) in order to keep
the visual aspect of red light, but not to deliver an effective therapeutic or considerable dose
(0.24 J to each site) according the current available evidence.19,33 Moreover, the irradiated sites
and the exposure time were the same that active PBMT-sMF.

Outcomes
Demographic and clinical characteristics (e.g., age, gender, and comorbidities) were
collected directly from electronic medical record of each patient. The primary and secondary
outcomes were:

Primary outcome
-

Length of stay in the ICU: the length of stay in the ICU was measured by the number
of days that patients were maintained hospitalized in the ICU from randomization until
discharge or death from any cause, whichever came first.

10
Secondary outcomes
-

Survival rate: survival rate was measured by the rate of how many people survived and
were discharged from ICU versus how many people have died, from randomization
until discharge or death from any cause, whichever came first.

-

Muscle function of diaphragm: the muscle function of the diaphragm was assessed
through the thickness of diaphragm measured by ultrasound.38,39 The LOGIQe device
(GE Healthcare, Chicago, USA) was used, with a linear transducer (ML6-15 from 5 to
15 MHz and 9L 2-8 MHz). The measurement was performed with the patient in the
supine position. The transducer was positioned in the zone of apposition between the
anterior and midaxillary lines at the level of the 9th or 10th intercostal space.39 Endexpiratory thickness of diaphragm was measured in 2 consecutive breaths from 2
separate images. Measurements were repeated at least once until consistently within
10%; the mean of all 4 measurement was used for analysis. 39 The measurement was
obtained at baseline (up to 24 hours after the initiation of invasive mechanical
ventilation), 10 days after randomization and in the last test before discharge or death
from any cause, whichever came first (within 24 hours).

-

Change in blood tests: the change in C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factoralpha (TNF-), and vitamin D levels, besides change in erythrocytes, hemoglobin,
hematocrit, leucocytes, segmented neutrals, eosinophiles, basophiles, lymphocytes,
monocytes, and platelet count were assessed at baseline (admission to the ICU), 10 days
after randomization and in the last test/day before discharge or death from any cause,
whichever came first. The data regarding the blood tests were collected directly from
electronic medical record of each patient, since it is a hospital daily routine to perform
these blood tests. The data were collected by two assessors blinded to the allocation
group of the patients.

-

Change in mechanical ventilation parameters: the change in positive end-expiratory
pressure levels (PEEP) and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2) were measured using a
mechanical ventilator. The data was collected directly from the mechanical ventilator at
baseline (admission to the ICU), 10 days after randomization and in the last day before
discharge or death from any cause, whichever came first.

-

Change in arterial blood gas analysis: the change in arterial partial pressure of oxygen
(PO2) and PO2/FiO2 ratio were assessed at baseline (admission to the ICU), 10 days
after randomization and in the last test/day before discharge or death from any cause,
whichever came first. The data regarding the arterial blood gas analysis were collected

directly from electronic medical record of each patient, since it is a hospital daily routine
to perform these blood tests. The data were collected by two assessors blinded to the
allocation group of the patients.

Statistical analysis
Since to date there is not published studies aiming to assess the effects of PBMT-sMF
in patients with severe COVID-19, we were compelled to use a convenience sample for this
trial. To estimate our sample, we based on the number of patients that would fulfill our
inclusion/exclusion criteria admitted in the ICU of Hospital Tacchini at the month before we
start our trial (April 2020), which was 10 patients. Thus, estimating a 3-month length for the
inclusion of patients in our trial (after the randomization of the first patient) we expected to
reach the convenience sample of 30 patients in total.
The statistical analysis was conducted following intention-to-treat principles (i.e., the
participants were analyzed in the groups to which they were allocated).40,41 Data normality was
tested by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Since the data showed normal distribution, the betweengroup differences (effects of treatment) were analyzed by unpaired, two tailed, t tests
(hospitalization data), and two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (time vs
experimental group) with post hoc Bonferroni correction (ventilatory parameters, biochemical
markers and hemogram parameters). The association between categorical variables was
analyzed using the Chi-square test. Data were expressed as mean and standard deviation, mean
difference between treatments, and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Data were also
expressed as frequency (%). The significance level was set at p<0.05. The magnitude of
differences (Cohen-d) between groups, to examine practical significances, was calculated using
the mean and SD of placebo and PBMT-sMF treatments (using Gpower 3.1). We adopted the
criteria of Cohen for the analysis (0.2: small; 0.50: moderate; 0.80: large). All analyses were
calculated by one of the researchers who was not involved in data collection.

RESULTS

Patients
Of the 62 patients who were assessed for eligibility, 30 were included in the study and
underwent randomization; 15 were assigned to the placebo group and 15 were assigned to the
PBMT-sMF. All patients received the treatment as assigned (figure 2). The mean age of the
patients was 66.06 years, the mean height was 166.53 cm, the mean body mass was 75.18 kg,

Patients allocated to the PBMT-sMF group increased diaphragm thickness at the
assessment performed at day 10 (MD = 14.19; 95% CI = 2.50 to 25.87) and at endpoint
assessment (MD = 20.46; 95% CI = 8.77 to 32.14) compared to patients allocated to the placebo
group (table 4). Regarding the ventilatory parameters, there was no statistically difference
between groups for PEEP and PO2 at any time point (table 4). In addition, there was no
statistically difference between groups for FiO2 at assessment of day 10. However, PBMT-sMF
group was able to decrease the FiO2 at endpoint assessment (MD = - 23.93; 95% CI = - 47.52
to - 0.34) compared to placebo group (table 4). Finally, patients allocated to the PBMT-sMF
group increased PO2/FiO2 only at endpoint assessment (MD = 117.90; 95% CI =12.31 to
223.50) compared to the placebo group (table 4).

Sample size calculation for further randomized controlled trials
Based on our results for the primary outcome (length of stay in the ICU), we are able to
determine the sample size for further studies investigating the effects of PBMT-sMF in patients
admitted to the ICU with COVID-19 requiring invasive mechanical ventilation.
It was observed that the length of stay in the ICU for patients treated with placebo was
23.06 (± 20.37), and for patients treated with PBMT-sMF it was 16.26 (± 9.61). Therefore,
considering a β value of 20% and α of 5%, the calculation resulted in a sample of 68 patients
per

group.

We

the

sample

(https://www.sphanalytics.com/sample-size-calculator-using-average-values/).
DISCUSSION
This is the first randomized triple-blinded placebo-controlled trial to assess the effects
of PBMT-sMF in patients with severe COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation. We
observed that length of stay in the ICU for PBMT-sMF group was shorter than to placebo group.
However, there was no statistically difference between groups. In contrast, the use of PBMTsMF increased diaphragm thickness at day 10 and at the endpoint assessment compared to
placebo treatment. Furthermore, PBMT-sMF was superior to placebo in improving ventilatory
parameters, decreasing FiO2 and increasing PO2/FiO2 at the endpoint assessment. In addition,
the patients allocated to the PBMT-sMF group had decreased CRP levels and increased
lymphocytes count at the endpoint assessment compared to the placebo group. Finally, PBMTsMF was superior to placebo in the decrease of hemoglobin count at assessment of day 10.
Regarding the other secondary outcomes, no between-group differences were observed.
Although there is speculation about the possible benefits of PBMT (isolated or
combined with sMF) in patients with COVID-19,42 to date this is the only one randomized
controlled trial carried out in this field. Therefore, the direct comparation with other randomized
controlled trials is limited. However, we observed that the use of PBMT-sMF increased the
muscle thickness and consequently its ability to generate strength,43-45 and also to prevent the
harms due disuse30 as previously observed in skeletal muscles of humans. In addition, there is
evidence that PBMT modulates the inflammatory process through decreased CRP levels also
in skeletal muscle of humans,46,47 as we observed in our study. In regards of other treatments
than PBMT to COVID-19, it has been shown that patients treated with lopinavir-ritonavir have
a time to clinical improvement similar to the patients treated with standard care alone.9 In
addition, treatment with convalescent plasma added to a standard treatment was similar to

standard treatment alone regarding time to clinical improvement within 28 days. 48 In contrast,
patients that used remdesivir had a shorter time to recovery than patients treated with placebo.10
In our trial, we observed that patients treated with PBMT-sMF had shorter time to recovery as
well. However, there was no difference between PBMT-sMF and placebo group, which may
probably have been caused by the small sample size. It is important to highlight that we included
only patients admitted to the ICU and requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, which is
different than the aforementioned studies.9,10,48 Finally, we did not observe adverse effects with
the use of PBMT-sMF, while the treatment with convalescent plasma added to a standard
treatment, lopinavir-ritonavir, and remdesivir caused some adverse effects such as
gastrointestinal events, chill and rashes, acute kidney injury and even serious respiratory
failure.9,10,48
PBMT-sMF was able to improve some ventilatory parameters, besides inflammatory
and infectious process and immune response in patients with severe COVID-19 requiring
mechanical ventilation. It was previously observed that patients with severe COVID-19 present
elevated ventilation-perfusion mismatch due to high dead space fraction.49 In our study, we
observed a better ventilation/perfusion rate associated to a preservation and improvement of
diaphragm thickness in patients treated with PBMT-sMF. These improvements possibly led to
decreased inflammation and infection (CRP) helping the immune response (lymphocytes) of
these patients. These findings suggest that the preservation of the main respiratory muscle may
facilitate the process of weaning from mechanical ventilation and trigger a cascade of positive
effects, improving the clinical condition of the patients. We observed that patients in the PBMTsMF group had shorter length of stay in the hospital, considering both all patients and only the
survivors. Therefore, these findings suggest that treatment with PBMT-sMF may reduce the
burden caused in the hospital and health systems, and the use of scarce health care resources
during this pandemic. In addition, PBMT-sMF has proven to be a safe therapy as there were no
adverse effects with its use. In addition, the number of deaths in the PBMT-sMF group was
smaller than in the placebo group, although there was no statistically difference between groups.
This trial was prospectively registered, we used true randomization, concealment
allocation, blindness of therapists, outcome assessors and patients. Statistical analysis was
conducted following intention-to-treat principles and it was performed by a blind researcher for
the treatment´ allocation. Moreover, we used a placebo group to control for confounders such
as placebo effect, regression to mean, and natural recovery. However, although we have
included several features in order to minimize bias, this study has some limitations. There were
two deviation from the registered protocol. The first one was that we estimated that the endpoint

assessment would be up to 20 days after randomization, however, as the endpoint assessment
directly depended on the length of stay in the ICU, in some cases this assessment took more
than 20 days. The second deviation was not having assessing IgG, IgM and D-dimmer because
the third part laboratory in charge to carry out the blood analysis was not able to implement the
necessary routines before the beginning of our trial. In addition, we might considerer as a
limitation did not following up the patients after hospital discharge. Finally, another limitation
to be considered is the small sample size.
This trial is the first one assessing the effects of PBMT-sMF in patients with severe
COVID-19, therefore was unknown a priori the adequate sample size to detect precise
differences in the primary outcome of the study. However, this study was important to estimate
the adequate sample size for further studies considering length of stay in the ICU as a primary
outcome. Based in our results we estimated that further studies will require n= 68 patients per
group to detect clinically important difference between groups. Therefore, further studies with
rigorous methodological quality and adequate sample size are needed to investigate whether
PBMT-sMF is able to decrease the length of stay in the ICU for patients with severe COVID19 requiring invasive mechanical ventilation.

Conclusion

Among patients with severe COVID-19 requiring invasive mechanical ventilation,
PBMT-sMF was not statistically different than placebo to the length of stay in the ICU.
However, it is important to highlight that our sample size was underpowered to detect statistical
differences to the primary outcome. In contrast, PBMT-sMF increased diaphragm thickness,
decreased FiO2, increased PO2/FiO2, decreased CRP levels and hemoglobin count, and
increased lymphocytes count.
