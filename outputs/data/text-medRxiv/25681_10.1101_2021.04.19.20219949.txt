ABSTRACT
In the face of new diseases, medicine needs to reinvent itself in order to contain
and control epidemics, such as the one we have recently faced, COVID-19, a
disease with a wide spectrum of clinical severity. A new moment has been
established, since the application of well known, effective and safe medications
for other diseases, has shown high success rates in the treatment of COVID-19.
Thereunto, studies with early intervention are needed, which can change the
unfavorable outcome of patients. In this article, we report the successful
experience using an oral strategy during the collapse of Belém do Pará Health
System, Brazil. Two hundred and ten patients were diagnosed with respiratory
failure due to COVID-19, with no option of hospital treatment due to lack of beds
and resources. These patients were then started on therapeutic regimen
consisting of prednisolone, enoxaparin and macrolides associated and followed
in outpatient facilities. Two hundred and eight patients had excellent therapeutic
response and there were only two fatalities. These results push research
boundaries, valuing outpatient treatment with early use of prednisolone in the
initial pulmonary phase, preventing severe COVID-19 pneumonitis. Adoption of
the proposed treatment intends to reduce the need for hospitalization, as well as
lethality, with social robust benefits and incalculable economic savings since
involves the use of accessible, safe and not expensive medications.

INTRODUCTION
COVID-19 is a disease with a wide spectrum of clinical severity, from
asymptomatic to fatal. In the absence of clinical trials and guidelines, with
hospitalizations and increasing mortality, often in a chaotic scenario that
compromises the effectiveness of actions, it is necessary to create therapeutic
strategies based on pathophysiological knowledge (1). Furthermore, the speed
of spread of COVID-19 is surprising, generating numerous simultaneous
infections. 10 to 15% of patients evolve with greater severity, requiring medical
care and supplemental oxygen, and another 5% evolve into a critical condition
with the need for intensive care due to respiratory failure, septic shock,
thromboembolism and multiple organ dysfunction (2).
In Europe, there were already reports of successful experiences in
reducing hospital mortality with the use of corticosteroid pulse therapy, confirming
that treatment with methylprednisolone may be beneficial for patients who
develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the disease progression
(3). Corticosteroids were discovered in 1935 and approved by the Food and Drug
Administration in the 1950s. Supplied in many different formulations, they are
widely used on treatment of a variety of diseases for its anti-inflammatory and
immunosuppressive effects (Kapugi, 2019). In Brazil, inspired by an article
published in JAMA (4) by Chaomin et al, we adopted a inpatient, lower,
antiinflammatory doses of intravenous methylprednisolone, in São Paulo, with
excellent results since March 2020. However, hospital efforts in an attempt to
introduce corticosteroid treatment in the inflammatory phase, even before
randomized controlled studies confirm its benefit (5), would not be able to contain
the worsening of the disease and deaths due to the high amount of simultaneous
patients seeking hospital care, since there were lack of hospital structure in the
scenario of collapse.
In order to reduce the pressure on hospital care and also to reduce
morbidity and mortality, we introduced a resolutive solution with an oral
therapeutic scheme in the face of emergency circumstances in the collapse of
the health system in the city of Belém do Pará.

CASUISTRY AND METHODS
From April 31 to May 15, 210 patients in inflammatory pulmonary phase
were treated with the protocol adapted to the situation of the collapse of the health
system in the metropolitan region of Belém, capital of the state of Pará, Brazil,
whose characteristics are exposed in Figure 1 (Figure 1). It is essential to
understand that the collapse of the public and private health system made it
impossible for the study patients to receive hospital medical care, despite the
clinical indication. During the intervention period, the emergency room's capacity
was exhausted and hospitals were literally closed due to lack of free hospital
beds.
The criteria used for inclusion in the study and the methods of clinical and
diagnostic evaluation, as well as the therapeutic scheme used are listed below.
INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR ORAL THERAPEUTIC STRATEGY:
1. Affected by COVID-19;
2. Stage II pulmonary inflammation, according to SIDDIQI classification
(6) with respiratory failure;
3. Absence of pulmonary fungal infection;
4. Hospital structure unavailable for treatment.
CLINICAL AND DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION METHODS
1. RT-PCR (reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction)
when available;
2. Specific serology;
3. D-dimer when available;
4. Chest Computed Tomography - Classification of CO-RADS (7) and
divided into quartiles (<25%, between 25 and 50%, between 50 and
75%,> 75%);
5. Clinical condition of respiratory failure with at least one of the criteria
above changed.

Thus, we carry out the following therapeutic scheme (adaptation for oral
treatment):
1. Prednisolone 40 mg once a day for 7 days;
2. Clarithromycin 500 mg once a day for 7 days;
3. Enoxaparin 40 mg SC once a day for 7 days;
4. Axetylcefuroxime 500 mg every 12 hours for 7 days.
We used alternative antibiotics such as levofloxacin or moxifloxacin,
considering the risk of shortages in pharmacies and also the social and economic
situation of the study patients. Supportive measures such as pronation,
supplemental oxygen and respiratory physiotherapy were used when available
and necessary.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Of the 210 cases, only two deaths occurred. As far as we know, this study
represents the first large series of cases of patients with severity criteria who were
treated at home, considering the pathophysiological rationale, given the collapse
of the health system in the metropolitan region of Belém-Pará-Brazil. The
outpatient treatment proposed in the study showed that it was decisive in the
clinical improvement of patients who were progressing severely or were already
in a severe state, with only two deaths. Even among patients who maintained a
serious condition, home treatment stabilized the patient and ensured his survival
until hospitalization could be feasible. Once indicated with criteria and monitoring,
this home treatment may be able to reduce pressure for hospital care, ensuring
a more organized flow and without risk of collapse. Fundamentally, this treatment
proved to be a real and concrete tool to reduce morbidity and mortality.
Randomized studies are needed to confirm the protocol's potential to modify the
natural course of the disease and support better resource management.
The great demand for hospital beds, which arises as a result of the rapid
rise in the number of cases and long time to discharge already hospitalized

patients, is capable of taking a health system to a critical level and failure. With
the current epidemiology of the increase in hospitalizations for COVID-19, this
alert serves as a strong impulse to study and evaluate the effectiveness of the
pre-hospital approach with early reception, as soon as the symptoms start or at
the first sign of persistence or worsening (8). The most certain approach for the
disease is to treat it as early as possible. In some regression analysis, the timetotreat was shown to be the most important predictor. It is important to consider that
most patients with COVID-19 who arrive at the hospital through emergency
medical services do not initially require advanced medical care (9). Once
hospitalized, approximately 25% of patients progress to mechanical ventilation,
advanced circulatory support or renal replacement therapy. Therefore, it is
conceivable that some of the hospitalizations, if not most, could be avoided if
patients were seen early on an outpatient basis, even with some severity criterion.
Additionally, McCullough and collaborators (1) emphasize that COVID-19, as an
infectious disease, is amenable to therapy at the beginning of its course and
whose chances of response are less when this therapy is implemented late in
hospitalized patients and in terminal stages.
The patients in this study had severity criteria, being classified as moderate
(67.62%) or severe (32.38%). Among moderates, 71,12% had risk factors for
severity, according to the WHO Clinical Management Guidelines (2). In the study
by Richardson and collaborators (10), the risk factors most associated with
mortality were hypertension, obesity and diabetes. In the present study, the
presence of comorbidities can be seen in Figure 1, the most prevalent of which
are in accordance with the literature (obesity - 46.67%, hypertension - 40.48%
and diabetes - 14.76%).
We observed that the mortality of the study was lower than that of other
case series of patients with criteria for hospitalization, with only 2 deaths (0,9%,
Table 1). In a retrospective cohort study in China, Zhu F et al report that of the
191 patients included, 26% required care in the intensive care unit (ICU) and
there was a mortality rate of 28% (11). A similar study conducted in the USA by
Richardson S et al (10), showed that 14.2% of patients were treated in an
intensive care unit, 12.2% received invasive mechanical ventilation and 21%

modify the outcome.

Computed tomography of the chest (CT), although is not indicated as an
isolated test of choice for diagnosis. Nevertheless, it is a valuable tool in the
diagnostic aid, since it is useful in assessing the extent of the disease, in
monitoring the evolution and detecting possible complications (12,33,44). During
collapse, patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 by clinical and epidemiological
criteria and the CT scan confirmed the pulmonary involvement of patients with
progressive clinical worsening. The studies that evaluated the sequence of
involvement on CT by COVID-19, indicate that in severe symptomatic patients,
there is an evolution that seems common for cases that remained hospitalized.
In the most initial phase, predominant ground-glass opacities occur, which are
generally rounded and may be unilateral or bilateral. In this first phase, 20 to 30%
of patients may already have consolidations. Some patients may already initially
manifest a more serious disease, with ground-glass and / or diffuse
consolidations (“white lung”), also indicating a poor prognosis. There were 27,3%
of patients in this stage of extensive tomographic impairment in our sample.
This study raises the reflection that early reception, already with severity
criteria, is fundamental and decisive in preventing fatalities, in addition to bringing
immeasurable economic and psychosocial benefits, avoiding widespread panic.
Treating the inflammatory phase early, after the seventh day of symptoms
and / or the presence of lung injury, has the potential not only to reduce mortality,
but also to reduce the risk of morbidity, intubation and iatrogenesis (15,16,17,18).

This measures are supported by the pathophysiology and also by the ethical
principle of secondary prevention. This is defined as early action to intercept or
halt the evolution of an already established disease. This applies to the early
identification of the risk of an unfavorable outcome and implementing timely
treatment to reduce sequelae, limitations and disabilities (19).
Publications showing the benefit of corticosteroid therapy in reducing
hospital stay, intubation and deaths are crucial to corroborate the potential of this
therapy in critically ill patients. Additionally, the present study highlights that good
results observation of corticosteroid therapy before hypoxemia, at the beginning
of phase II, may expand its indication and reinforce the hypothesis that the
disease course may be changed earlier.
The fear of increasing viral replication with early use of corticosteroid
therapy has not been confirmed, once an inflammatory phase has been
established, a time when viral replication is no longer prevalent, and everything
indicates that the development of a competent immune response has already
been established. Documenting the SARS-COV-2 specific cellular immunity of
patients with initial lung injury is essential, as it would demonstrate the absence
of clinical worsening due to the low risk of increased viral replication explaining
the success of treatment appropriately.
We believe that enoxaparin was decisive in controlling thrombogenesis
considering the pathophysiology of the disease, as well as the modulation of
immunity with the use of macrolides. However, studies are needed to confirm the
magnitude of action of this drug in the management of COVID-19. Several studies
are underway to determine the role of anticoagulants in the treatment of COVID19
due to the findings at autopsies.
Our experience with the collapse of Pará overflowed the solidarity spirit of
the Pará’s doctors, as well as the infinite capacity of the human mind to solve
problems in the face of adversity. There were more than 500 patients treated with
this protocol in the period of the health system collapse and only 2 registered
deaths. From this series, data from 210 patients were auditable. The experience
of treating patients in the pulmonary phase of COVID-19 on an outpatient basis
was widely disseminated among doctors in Belém and, since then, the treatment
of these patients has remained primarily on an outpatient basis, even with

hospital beds available after the pandemic has slowed down its pace. Thus, this
therapeutic approach makes hospitalization an exception and the evolution to
death is increasingly unlikely.
The authors suggest that patients with COVID19 symptoms be submitted
to Chest CT Scan, d-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase and complete blood count,
when seen for the first time. The same should be done on symptoms day 7, and
if positive results, with ground-glass pattern, are found on CT Scan, the protocol
should be introduced on an outpatient basis.

CONCLUSION
1. The use of this therapeutic regimen as the first choice for COVID-19
pneumonitis will dramatically decrease the evolution of pneumonia,
reducing the need for hospitalization and the use of respirators,
favoring the health system and preventing fatalities.
2. This experience stimulates the study of the possible correlation
between the development of competent cellular immunity in synchrony
with the development of pulmonary inflammation, since there were no
signs of viral replication or worsening of the disease.
3. It also opens the way to create a study with outpatient monitoring for
COVID-19 initial pneumonitis, preventing unnecessary hospitalization.
We still need to create this protocol with careful criteria for daily
surveillance of patients. Suggesting that COVID-19 can become an
ambulatory disease for most patients.
4. Emphasizes the importance of early reception for the treatment of initial
pulmonary inflammation.
5. The data shown in this paper supported by the low mortality enforces
that patients with initial COVID19 symptoms must be submitted to
complete blood count, lactate dehydrogenase and d dimer levels, in
addition of CT SCAN of the chest on their initial visit and on the seventh
day of symptoms. Ground-glass findings on the latest CT SCAN
support the suggested protocol adoption, with high probability of
success.
