Abstract – 50 words

19

The University of Arizona utilized wastewater-based epidemiology paired with clinical

20

testing as a surveillance strategy to monitor COVID-19 prevalence in a dormitory community.

21

Positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in wastewater led to prompt testing of all residents and the

22

identification and isolation of three infected individuals which averted potential disease

23

transmission.

25

Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) utilizes concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 in

26

sewage to monitor population-level COVID-19 infections (1–3). Currently, WBE is a promising

27

indicator to support public health decisions (3,4). In this case study, WBE was used to detect a

28

COVID-19 outbreak in a student dormitory (henceforth Dorm A) at the University of Arizona

29

(UArizona).

30

The Study

31

UArizona incorporated wastewater surveillance as a potential early-warning tool for

32

COVID-19 outbreaks on campus. Grab samples (1L) were collected from a sewer manhole

33

specific to Dorm A, between August 18-31 to monitor SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater. Upon

34

positive detection of viral RNA in wastewater samples, clinical testing was conducted on every

35

individual living in the dorm. UArizona performed two clinical testing modalities, antigen (1

36

hour turnaround) test via anterior nasal swab and RT-PCR (48-72 hour turnaround) via

37

nasopharyngeal swab samples. Individuals were subject to clinical testing via two routes:

38

Campus Health Services (CHS) if experiencing symptoms or Test All Test Smart (TATS)

39

regardless of symptoms. Refer to Appendix for method details.

40

On March 13, 2020, UArizona advised students and employees to work remotely. During

41

the summer, UArizona administration assembled a Task Force and Campus Re-Entry Working

42

Groups to prepare for students’ safe return. Seven expert teams were created consisting of

43

COVID-19 clinical testing, thermometry and wellness checks, contact tracing, healthcare and

44

guidance, isolation, data platforms and communication, and WBE. Utilization of WBE in

45

conjunction with clinical testing was seen to be critical for the early detection of infections in

46

student dorms.

47

The WBE expert team hypothesized that surveillance of defined communities in dorms

48

would provide an effective means for identifying new cases of COVID-19 since 1) each dorm

49

contained a known population, 2) dorm students provide a representation of the overall status of

50

campus health, 3) wastewater samples could be collected from individual buildings, and 4)

51

actionable public health responses could be initiated in the event of positive wastewater

52

detection. Wastewater samples were collected from sewer manholes downstream from each

53

dorm prior to convergence or mixing with other sewer lines, resulting in samples specific to

54

individual buildings with defined communities.

55

On August 17, students were permitted to move into Dorm A (Figure 1). Before entering

56

on-campus housing, students were required to test negative via UArizona’s COVID-19 nasal

57

swab antigen test and follow public health guidelines, such as wearing a mask and committing to

58

social distancing. Students testing positive were prohibited from entering the dorm and were

59

required to remain in isolation until remaining symptom-free for a minimum of 10 days, per

60

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines (5).

61

A baseline survey of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater was conducted prior to the start

62

of the fall semester by collecting wastewater samples from Dorm A on August 18 and 20. No

63

SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in these samples. Negative results corresponded with the

64

requirement that all students test negative prior to entering the dorm. The largest number of

65

students that moved into campus housing occurred on August 21, three days before the start of

66

classes on August 24 (Figure 1). On August 25, wastewater from Dorm A tested positive for

67

SARS-CoV-2 N1 gene (1.61 x 105 copies/L) signaling the presence of the virus in the dorm

68

(Table 1). This positive sample triggered an emergency UA Task Force meeting, which

69

supported additional wastewater sampling and clinical testing among Dorm A residents (Figure

70

1).

71

The next day (August 26), five wastewater samples were collected once every five

72

minutes between 8:30-8:50 am. Importantly, all five samples yielded virtually identical SARS-

73

CoV-2 concentrations (Table 1). This validated homogenous virus dispersion within the sewer

74

environment (2,6), which suggested that grab samples were representative, and therefore

75

composite sampling was unnecessary. That same day, 270 antigen tests and 260 PCR tests were

76

conducted on-site at the dorm (via TATS) out of 311 total residents (Table 2). Antigen testing

77

identified one positive individual (Person A) despite the individual showing no symptoms. The

78

other 269 antigen tests were negative. Simultaneously, another individual (Person B) reported to

79

CHS experiencing symptoms and tested positive via an antigen test. Person A and Person B were

80

immediately relocated into an isolation facility to prevent transmission of the virus. Another PCR

81

test was inconclusive (Person C) and retested per CDC guidelines (7). Results of this retest were

82

not available until August 29.

83

Over the next two days, antigen tests (34 individuals) and PCR tests (24 individuals)

84

were conducted for individuals not tested on August 26. All tests were negative (Table 2).

85

Corresponding wastewater samples from August 27 and 28 were also negative (Table 1),

86

indicating that the source(s) for SARS-CoV-2 had likely been removed from the dorm. However,

87

wastewater analysis on August 29 was positive for both N1 (1.04 x 104 copies/L) and N2 (9.93 x

88

105 copies/L) genes (Table 1). From the TATS samples conducted on August 26, PCR results

89

were positive for two tests three days later (Table 2), one of which was collected from Person A,

90

who had previously tested positive via an antigen test and was already isolated. The other was a

91

PCR retest that identified a new positive individual (Person C) whose earlier antigen test was

92

negative and PCR was inconclusive. Person C was immediately relocated into isolation despite

93

being asymptomatic.

94

Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected in wastewater on August 27 and 28

95

while Person C was in the dorm. Reports have indicated that approximately 50% of COVID-19

96

patients shed virus in feces. Therefore, it is possible that Person C was not shedding virus or was

97

recently exposed and had low viral shedding on August 27 and 28. The low viral shedding load

98

justification is supported by the fact that 40 cycles of PCR (Cq = 40) were required for the

99

positive PCR result, which suggested trace amounts of SARS-CoV-2 (8). Recent studies have

100

also observed that viral loads from stool samples follow a more erratic pattern than viral loads

101

from upper respiratory tract (9,10). It is important to note that on August 28, Person D returned

102

to the dorm after being on isolation protocols. Reports suggest that low viral shedding in feces

103

can continue for over two weeks after symptoms have cease (9,11–13). On August 29, viral RNA

104

was detected in wastewater from Dorm A. This positive wastewater result is likely due to

105

combined shedding from Person C and Person D. The removal of Person C on August 29

106

resulted in lower shedding loads, and ultimately, negative wastewater samples in the following

107

days. Due to negative wastewater samples on August 30 and 31 (Figure 1; Table 1), no further

108

clinical testing was performed.

109

Conclusion

110

Overall, WBE combined with clinical testing successfully identified and potentially

111

prevented COVID-19 transmission. Positive detection in wastewater samples always

112

corresponded with positive clinical tests throughout the 12-day study. Thus, there were no false

113

results, and positive detection in wastewater accurately signaled the presence of infected

114

individuals in Dorm A. Infected individuals were identified via clinical tests enabling the

115

university to initiate transmission intervention strategies (Figure 2). In contrast, WBE can result

116

in a false negative result if an infected individual sheds little or no virus or if the environmental

117

matrix results in PCR inhibition. Overall, this case study validates the utility of WBE to avert

118

potential COVID-19 outbreaks.

Design and Methods

176

Wastewater sampling

177

Wastewater samples were collected from a sewer manhole specific to Dorm A, without

178

convergence or mixing from other sewer lines. Grab samples (1L) were collected from the

179

manhole using a pole/dipper and submerging a sterile Nalgene bottle into the flowing wastewater

180

until it was full. Samples were collected at 8:00 am on August 18 and 20 during the week that

181

students moved into the dorm. Daily samples were collected from August 25 – 31 to monitor

182

SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater during the first week of classes. On August 26, five samples

183

were collected five minutes apart between 8:30-8:50 am to determine sample variation during

184

sample collection. On August 27, two samples were collected, on in the morning (9:30 am) and

185

afternoon (1:15 pm) to determine variation at different times of day. All samples were

186

transported in a cooler containing ice to the laboratory for immediate processing.

187

Virus concentration and recovery

188

The method for recovery and concentration of SARS-CoV-2 from wastewater was

189

validated and standardized using human coronavirus 229E (HCoV 229E, ATCC VR-740) as a

190

surrogate. Briefly, the initial virus concentration involved stepwise vacuum filtration through

191

membrane filters of 0.8, 0.65, 0.45 and 0.22 µm pore sizes (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA)

192

followed by centrifugal ultrafiltration using the CentriconPlus-70 filter, 100 kDa cutoff (EMD

193

Millipore, Billerica, MA). The final concentrate sample volume was used for RNA extraction as

194

described below.

It is made available under a CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license .

195

Matrix spikes were used to evaluate the performance and recovery efficiency of the

196

method for concentration of enveloped viruses from wastewater samples from UArizona

197

dormitories. The surrogate HCoV 229 E was spiked in dormitory sewage at concentrations of

198

1.30 x 1010 ± 2.97 x 109 total gene copies per volume of sample. Aliquots of 0.5 L of raw sewage

199

were spiked and processed following the method described above. Recovery efficiencies (Y) of

200

HCoV 229 E were calculated as follows:

201

Y = X/(Co x V) x 100

202

Y: Recovery yield of the concentration method

203

X: Recovery HCoV-229 E copy number (copies)

204

Co: Stock HCoV-229 E copy number added into test water (copy/µL)

205

V: Added stock HCoV 229 E volume (µL)

206

It is important to note that matrix spikes were included only in a baseline study in order

207

to evaluate the recovery efficiency of the method. The concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA

208

were not adjusted to the estimated recovery efficiencies. These assays yielded an average

209

recovery of 14±16% which indicated low and highly variable efficiencies of recovery of HCoV

210

229 E in wastewater as observed in studies with other coronaviruses used for the same purpose

211

(1-2). Low recoveries of enveloped and non-enveloped viruses in wastewater and variations in

212

the efficiency of the methods are predominantly associated with the complexity of this

213

environmental matrix (3-4).

215

The nucleic acid of both SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV 229 E was extracted from the final

216

concentrate sample volume using the QIAGEN QIAmp Viral Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA)

217

followed by cDNA synthesis from the extracted RNA using the SuperScript® IV First-Strand

218

Synthesis reverse transcription kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) with random hexamers. Samples

219

were assayed for SARS-CoV-2 using the RT-PCR assays manufactured at Integrated DNA

220

Technologies (IDT, Coralville, IA) for research use only (RUO). ROU kits include all published

221

assays for the nucleocapsid genes N1 and N2 developed by the Centers for Disease Control and

222

Prevention (Table S1). Similarly, samples were assayed for HCoV 229 E using a real-time

223

quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-qPCR) assay previously developed for the rapid

224

detection and quantitation of this virus in clinical samples (5).

225

Real-Time RT-PCR assays were performed using the LightCycler® 480 Instrument II

226

(Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). For SARS-CoV-2, reaction mixtures (25 µL) contained

227

12.5 µL of LightCycler 480 Probes Master (Roche Diagnostics) primers and probes (1.87 µL),

228

nuclease-free water (5.63 µL) plus 5 µL of viral cDNA. For HCoV 229 E, reaction mixtures (25

229

µL) contained 12.5 µL of LightCycler 480 Probes Master (Roche Diagnostics) primers and

230

probes (2.5 µL), nuclease-free water (5 µL) plus 5 µL of viral cDNA. Fluorescence data were

231

collected after every cycle and analyzed with LightCycler® 480 Software version 1.5.1.6.2

232

(Roche Diagnostics). Primers and probes used for detection and quantitative estimation of

233

SARS-CoV-2 RNA and HCoV 229E RNA in wastewater sample concentrates are described in

234

For absolute quantification of SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229 E, standard curves were

236

generated using ten-fold dilutions of a plasmid control containing the complete nucleocapsid

237

gene from 2019-nCoV (IDT, Coralville, IA) and a gBlock gene fragment (IDT, Coralville, IA),

respectively following the Roche system based on second-derivative Cq determination and

239

nonlinear fit algorithms. Limits of blank, detection, and quantification for the RT-qPCR assays

240

were determined following standard procedures previously described (6) and currently in use in

241

our laboratory. Limit of blank (LoB) are defined as the lowest concentration that can be reported

242

with 95 percent confidence to be above the concentrations of blanks. The LoB was used to

243

determine the most accurate limit of detection. It is the highest apparent concentration expected

244

to be found when replicates of a blank are tested and is determined by calculating the 95th

245

percentile of the Cq values for all the blanks (reagent water containing no target material) for a

246

specific target (CqLoB). This includes the Cq values for no-template controls, extraction blanks,

247

and filter blanks. Limit of detection (LoD) is defined as the lowest concentration that can be

248

detected with 95 percent confidence that it is a true detection and can be distinguished from the

249

LoB. The LoD was determined by running a series of dilutions of the target with a minimum of

250

10 replicates per dilution. The dilution with the lowest concentration of known target that met the

251

following requirements was chosen as the LoD: 1) the standard deviation (in Ct values) of the

252

replicates was less than one and 2) the number of replicates with detections was greater than 95

253

percent. The average Cq value (CqLoD) for this dilution was used to calculate a concentration

254

(copies/rxn) using the standard curve run with the dilution series. Limit of quantification (LoQ)

255

is defined as the lowest concentration that can be accurately quantified. The LoQ was

256

determined using the CqLoD and the standard deviation of CqLoD as previously defined. A Cq

257

value for the LoQ (CqLoQ) was calculated as 𝐶q𝐿𝑜𝑄 = 𝐶q𝐿𝑜𝐷 − 2(𝜎𝐶q𝐿𝑜𝐷) where 𝜎𝐶q𝐿𝑜𝐷 is

258

the standard deviation of the CqLoD for this assay. This CqLoQ was used to calculate a

259

concentration (copies/rxn) using the standard curve run with the dilution series. A summary of

260

the performance of the standard curves for each assay is given in Table S2.

Clinical Testing and Public Health Protocols
UArizona performs two clinical tests for COVID-19 diagnosis: antigen (Sofia SARS

263

Antigen FIA, Quidel, San Diego, CA, USA) via anterior nasal swab and RT-PCR (CDC 2019-

264

nCoV RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel) (7) via nasopharyngeal swab samples. This test is not yet

265

approved or cleared by the United States Food and Drug Administration. This test was developed

266

and its analytical performance characteristics have been determined by the University of Arizona

267

Genetics Core for Clinical Services. It has not been cleared or approved by FDA. This assay was

268

developed as a Laboratory-Developed Test and has been validated pursuant to the CLIA

269

regulations and is used for clinical purposes.

270

Upon arriving on campus, every individual was required to report to a designated

271

COVID-19 testing site and undergo an anterior nasal swab for antigen testing. Individuals were

272

kept on-site until tests results were noted. Each individual was required to test negative before

273

receiving access to the dorm and campus buildings. If a person had a positive COVID-19 test,

274

they were required to isolate for a minimum of 10 days (at home or in a designated isolation

275

dorm) from the onset of symptoms or from the date the sample was taken, per guidelines from

276

the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention (8). If the individual remains

277

symptom-free after 10 days, they can be cleared to return to the dorm; however, if symptoms

278

persist they may be kept in isolation longer.

279

While living in the dorm, individuals were subject to clinical testing via two routes:

280

Campus Health Services (CHS) or Test All Test Smart (TATS). CHS testing was conducted only

281

on individuals that were experiencing symptoms and reported to the health services building for

282

clinical testing and diagnosis. TATS testing was conducted on every individual living in the

283

dorm upon positive detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater that suggested prevalence of

284

disease/infection amongst persons in the dorm. Individuals were excluded from TATS testing if

285

they had already reported to CHS for testing on the same day or had proof of recently returning

286

from isolation and no longer experiencing symptoms. In essence, CHS tested individuals that

287

were symptomatic, and TATS tested individuals that were asymptomatic or had not yet reported

288

symptoms. CHS and TATS both utilized anterior nasal swab samples for antigen and/or PCR

289

tests.
