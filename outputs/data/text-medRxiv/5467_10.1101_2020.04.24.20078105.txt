Abstract
Background: No firm recommendations are currently available to guide decision making for
patients requiring cardiac surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. Systematic appraisal of
national expert consensus can be used to generate interim recommendations until data
from clinical observations will become available. Hence, we aimed to collect and
quantitatively appraise nationwide UK senior surgeons’ opinion on clinical decision making
for patients requiring cardiac surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Methods: We mailed a web-based questionnaire to all consultant cardiac surgeons through
the Society for Cardiothoracic Surgery in Great Britain and Ireland (SCTS) mailing list on the
17th April 2020 and we pre-determined to close the survey on the 21st April 2020. This survey
was primarily designed to gather information on UK surgeons’ opinion using 12 items.
Strong consensus was predefined as an opinion shared by at least 60% of responding
consultants.
Results: A total of 86 consultant surgeons undertook the survey. All UK cardiac units were
represented by at least one consultant. Strong consensus was achieved for the following key
questions:1) before hospital admission every patient should receive nasopharyngeal swab,
PCR and chest CT; 2) the use of full PPE should to be adopted in every case by the theatre
team regardless patient’s COVID-19 status; 3) the risk of COVID-19 exposure for patients
undergoing heart surgery should be considered moderate to high and likely to increase
mortality if it occurs; 4) cardiac procedure should be decided based on ad-hoc
multidisciplinary team discussion for every patient. The majority believed that both aortic
and mitral surgery should be considered in selected cases. The role of CABG surgery
during the pandemic was more controversial.

Introduction
The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on
healthcare globally, including on the delivery of cardiac surgical care [1-2]. Cardiac surgery
is the single largest user of intensive care unit beds [1-2] and resource re-allocation to treat
COVID-19 patients has halted the provision of routine cardiac surgery services worldwide
and in the United Kingdom. Despite the disruption, urgent and emergency cardiac procedures
are still required by the public during the pandemic. However, there remain several areas of
uncertainty, including the risks incurred by patients with heart conditions, who may suffer
fatal events if cardiac surgery is delayed by several weeks, and the impact of acquiring
COVID-19 during the perioperative period. Anecdotal evidence suggest post-operative
COVID-19 infection may be fatal.
No firm recommendations are currently available to guide decision making for patients
requiring cardiac surgery during the pandemic. This can translate into significant variability
in clinical practice and patients’ outcomes across cardiac units. In these circumstances, expert
consensus can provide interim guidance for healthcare policy makers, for clinicians’ daily
practice and for patients [3]. We aimed to collect and quantitatively appraise nationwide UK
senior surgeons’ opinion on clinical decision making for patients requiring cardiac surgery
during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Participants and methods
We mailed a web-based questionnaire to all consultant cardiac surgeons through the Society
for Cardiothoracic Surgery in Great Britain and Ireland (SCTS) mailing list on the 17th April

2020. In view of the rapidly evolving circumstances and the need for timely outcome
presentation, we pre-determined to close the survey on the 21st April 2020. This survey was
primarily designed to gather information on UK surgeons’ opinion on which patients should
be considered for cardiac surgery under the current COVID-19 pandemic using 12 items. As
at the time of the survey, there was significant variability on clinical activities across centres,
the first part of the questionnaire gathered information on local factors (local resource
relocation to treat COVID-19) that may have influenced surgeons’ view. Strong consensus
was predefined as an opinion shared by at least 60% of responding consultants [3].
Results
A total of 86 consultant surgeons undertook the survey. All UK cardiac units were
represented by at least one consultant. Figure 1 shows the distribution of responding
consultants across different regions and the proportion of consultant stratified by local
resource relocation. Geographical regions with the highest number of responding consultant
were London area, North West and Northern regions. Most consultants were from units
where resources were only partially redirected to treat COVID-19 (n=63, 73%) followed by
consultants working in units entirely relocated (n=17, 18%) and only nine consultants were
from in units where resources were not redirected (10%). Table 1 shows the results of the
survey in the overall sample and in groups stratified by working in units with resource
relocation.
In the overall sample, strong consensus (≥60%) was achieved for the following key
questions:1) before hospital admission every patient should receive nasopharyngeal swab,
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and chest computerised tomography (CT); 2) the use of full
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) should to be adopted in every case by the theatre team
regardless patient’s COVID-19 status; 3) the risk of COVID-19 exposure for patients

undergoing heart surgery should be considered moderate to high and likely to increase
mortality if it occurs; 4) cardiac procedure should be decided based on ad-hoc
multidisciplinary team (MDT) for every patient. Although there was no strong consensus on
other key questions, the majority (>50%) agreed on that: 1) patients tested COVID-19
positive before salvage surgery (i.e. dissection), should be considered for surgery only if they
have no symptoms of infection and have best chances of survival (taking into consideration
factors such as age); 2) aortic and mitral valve surgery could similarly be considered only in
selected cases. Interestingly, opinion about who should have coronary artery bypass grafting
(CABG) surgery was much more varied. When the outcomes of the survey were stratified by
resource relocation, surgeons from units where resources were not relocated (i.e. units which
are carrying on as normal) showed a very strong agreement (>85%) that the risk of COVID19 exposure for patients undergoing cardiac surgery is moderate to high and likely to increase
mortality if it occurs. This group also showed the highest proportion of surgeons believing
that cardiac surgery should never be performed in elective or urgent inpatients. Finally, there
was a strong consensus that this pandemic will not have an impact on surgical activities when
normal operating conditions will be re-established.
Comments
We are realising that non COVID-19 infection related deaths may be extremely
important component of the health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide due to
healthcare resources relocation to acutely respond to the pandemic. However, there is
little direct evidence to inform the management of patients requiring cardiac surgery under
the current rapidly evolving circumstances. Initial reports have suggested that non COVID19 related cardiovascular mortality and morbidity are likely to be significantly affected
[4]. In particular, the number of cardiac surgeries has dramatically decreased as intensive
care facilities and staff have been urgently required to treat COVID-19 patients. Even

though cardiac surgeons are still required to ensure that essential cardiac interventions
are provided to the public, the risk of COVID exposure during hospital admission and its
potential impact on surgical outcomes during hospital admission remains uncertain. In
healthcare systems where surgeons’ mortality is under public and regulatory bodies
scrutiny, such as in the UK, surgeons may be reluctant to offer cardiac operations under
the current circumstances. To avoid the risk of inappropriate risk adverse practice, UK
regulatory bodies including the SCTS have decided to suspend surgeons’ specific
mortality monitoring while national and single unit outcomes remain under strict
surveillance.
Anecdotal evidence that patients are reluctant to go to a hospital during the COVID-19
outbreak [3]. Patient’s counselling is particularly challenging as risk stratification
methods available do not account for COVID-19 exposure and it takes more time and
empathy than ever to help a patient give consent for their cardiac surgery.
In the UK, there are rich resources of routinely clinical data, including the National Adults
Cardiac Surgical Audit (NACSA) which will provide essential information on the impact of
the COVID-19 pandemic on patients undergoing cardiac surgery. However, clinical
observations are accumulating slowly due to drastic reduction of cardiac surgeries performed
and data-driven evidence results may not be available until late spring or early fall. As a
result, no firm recommendations are still available for case selection and clinical decision
making in patients referred to cardiac surgery. In clinical scenarios without compelling
evidence,

The present survey collected information from the senior cardiac surgeons across all the

needs to include nasopharyngeal swab, PCR, and chest CT for every patient during the
pandemic. Screening is essential to contain the infections and avoid post-operative
complications. However, testing before admission can delay treatment which may affect
clinical outcomes in some cases and this approach will need to be appraised in the following
months. A tailored approach may become necessary if the pandemic continues for several
months as suggested by several epidemiologists. Surgeons were also in agreement that the
theatre team should adopt full PPE for all the procedures performed during the pandemic.
It is possible that the pandemic will last for several months and it will need to be
determined the impact of full PPE on team performance (i.e. communication, surgical
vision and dexterity and fatigue) and its potential consequences on clinical outcomes.
Most surgeons and particularly those working in units currently unaffected by the
pandemic, believed that the risk of COVID exposure for patients undergoing cardiac
surgery is moderate to high and can have serious consequences on patient’s outcome.
This information can represent an important element to support patient’s counselling
before compelling clinical evidence becomes available.
Finally, there was a strong consensus that each surgical case requires ad-hoc
multidisciplinary team decision and patient’s selection at surgeon’s discretion under the
current circumstances was believed to be acceptable only by a very small number of
responders. Clearly, multidisciplinary team discussion for each patient requires flexible
approaches such as conference call discussions or emails exchanges, and consideration
must be given to sensitive data protection and confidentiality and the need of maintaining
clinical documentation standards.
There was no strong consensus with regards to specific types of cardiac procedures.
However, the majority believed that both aortic and mitral surgery should be considered
in selected cases. The role of CABG surgery during the pandemic was more

controversial. Neither consensus nor majority was achieved for CABG surgery in
selected cases (i.e. left main). Despite recent controversies reported by public media [5],
almost a third of responders believing that under the current circumstances percutaneous
coronary intervention (PCI) should always be the default strategy for every case and
CABG surgery should be considered only in unstable patients when PCI is not feasible.
Whether t will have implication on CABG surgery once the pandemic ends remains
unclear.
In conclusion, during the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare policy makers and hospitals
not only need to consider methods for containing and treating these infections but how
infection outbreaks may affect systems of care beyond the immediate infection. Clinical
decision making for patients requiring cardiac surgery is particularly challenging under
the COVID-19 pandemic as data-driven evidence is still scarce. Worldwide and in the
UK, the lack of firm recommendations for the management of patients requiring cardiac
surgery can translate into unwarranted variation in clinical practice and patients’ clinical
outcomes across units. In the current unprecedented scenario, systematic appraisal of
national and international expert consensus, can represent a rapid and efficient
instrument to provide support to heath policy makers and other stakeholders in
generating interim recommendations to guide and support clinicians in decision making
process.
