ABSTRACT

1

COVID-19 pandemic has underlined the impact of emergent pathogens as a major threat for human

2

health. The development of quantitative approaches to advance comprehension of the current outbreak

3

is urgently needed to tackle this severe disease. In this work, several mathematical models are proposed

4

to represent SARS-CoV-2 dynamics in infected patients. Considering different starting times of

5

infection, parameters sets that represent infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 are computed and compared with

6

other viral infections that can also cause pandemics.

7

Based on the target cell model, SARS-CoV-2 infecting time between susceptible cells (mean of 30

8

days approximately) is much slower than those reported for Ebola (about 3 times slower) and influenza

9

(60 times slower). The within-host reproductive number for SARS-CoV-2 is consistent to the values of

10

influenza infection (1.7-5.35). The best model to fit the data was including immune responses, which

11

suggest a slow cell response peaking between 5 to 10 days post onset of symptoms. The model with

12

eclipse phase, time in a latent phase before becoming productively infected cells, was not supported.

13

Interestingly, both, the target cell model and the model with immune responses, predict that virus may

14

replicate very slowly in the first days after infection, and it could be below detection levels during the

15

first 4 days post infection. A quantitative comprehension of SARS-CoV-2 dynamics and the estimation

16

of standard parameters of viral infections is the key contribution of this pioneering work.

INTRODUCTION

20

Epidemics by infectious pathogens are a major threat to humankind. The year 2020 has uncovered one

21

of the biggest pandemics in history, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that was first reported in

22

Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019. SARS-CoV-2 causes a severe, potentially fatal acute

23

respiratory syndrome (COVID-19). Thus far, about 267013 confirmed cases and about 11201 deaths

24

were reported worldwide [1]. While China has made a large effort to shrink the outbreak, COVID-19 has

25

developed into a pandemic in 185 countries. Case numbers are alarming as the virus spreads in Europe,

26

Iran, South Korea, and Japan. In fact, the pandemic epicentre changed to Europe on 13 of March 2020.

27

Coronaviruses can be found in different species of animals (e.g. bats and camels) and can evolve and

28

infect humans by droplets from coughing or sneezing. Previous outbreaks to COVID-2019 were the

29

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV), reported in Asia in February 2003 resulting in 8422

30

cases with a case-fatality rate of 11% [1]. Later, in 2012, the Middle East respiratory syndrome

31

(MERS-CoV) was identified in Saudi Arabia and infected 2506 people, killing 862 between 2012 and

32

2020 [1]. Metagenomics studies previous to the COVID-19 outbreak envisaged the possibility of future

33

threats due to the identification of several sequences closely related SARS-like viruses circulating in the

34

Chinese bat populations [2, 3].

35

Unfortunately, no vaccine or antiviral drug is likely to be available soon. In fact, either monoclonal

36

antibody or vaccine approaches have failed to neutralize and protect from coronavirus infections [3].

37

Therefore, individual behaviour (e.g early self-isolation and social distancing) as well as preventive

38

measures such as hand washing, covering when coughing are critical to control the spread of

39

COVID-19 [4]. Additionally to these measures, several travel restrictions and quarantines have taken

40

place in many countries around the globe.

41

Epidemiological mathematical models have been developed to help policy makers to take the right

42

decisions [4]. These have highlighted that social distancing interventions to mitigate the epidemic is a

43

key aspect. There are many epidemiological unknowns with 2019-nCoV [4]. The case fatality rate for

44

COVID-19 is about 0·3–1% [1]. However, adjusted estimation by [5] indicates that COVID-19 mortality

45

rate could be as high as 20% in Wuhan. In its early stages, the epidemic have doubled in size every 7.4

46

days [6]. Moreover, the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9) [6].

47

Based on the relative long incubation period for COVID-19, about 5–6 days [1], Anderson et al. [4]

48

suggested that might be considerable pre-symptomatic infectiousness.

49

While there are many mathematical models developed at epidemiological level for COVID-19, there

is none so far at within-host level to understand SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle and its interactions with

51

the immune system (Fig.1). Among several approaches, the target cell model has served to represent

52

several diseases such as HIV [7–10], Hepatitis virus [11, 12], Ebola [13, 14], influenza [15–18], among

53

many others. A detailed reference for viral modelling can be found in [19]. Very recent data from

54

infected patients with COVID-19 has enlighten the within-host viral dynamics. Zou et al. [20] presented

55

the viral load in nasal and throat swabs of 17 symptomatic patients. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2

56

replication cycles may last longer than flu, about 10 days or more after the incubation period [4, 20].

57

Here, we contribute to the mathematical study of SARS-CoV-2 dynamics at within-host level based on

58

data presented by Wolfel et al. [21].

RESULTS

60

Using ordinary differential equations (ODEs), different mathematical models are presented to adjust the

61

viral kinetics reported by Woelfel et al. [21] in patients with COVID-19. Viral load [21] was sampled

62

from throat swab cultures and measured in Copies/mL, g Swab, at Log10 scale. To understand the

63

SARS-CoV-2 dynamics observed in infected patients, mathematical models are employed as both a

64

quantitative recapitulation of experimental data and as a tool to prioritize mechanisms on the basis of

65

mathematical models and the Corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) for model selection. The

66

cost function (14) is minimized to adjust the model parameters based on the Differential Evolution (DE)

Target Cell Model. The mathematical model used here to represent coronavirus dynamics is based

82

on the target cell-limited model [19, 23, 24]. Coronavirus can replicate in a variety of cell types,

83

including epithelial cells. The coronavirus infection model is as follows:

84

dU
dt
dI
dt
dV
dt

= −βU V,

(3)

= βU V − δI,

(4)

= pI − cV.

(5)

Host cells can be in one of following states: susceptible (U ) and infected (I). Viral particles (V ) infect

85

susceptible cells with a rate β ((Copies/mL)−1 day−1 ). Once cells are productively infected, they release

86

virus at a rate p (Copies/mL day−1 cell−1 ) and virus particles are cleared with rate c (day−1 ). Infected

87

cells are cleared at rate δ (day−1 ) as consequence of cytopathic viral effects and immune responses.

88

Coronaviruses infect mainly in differentiated respiratory epithelial cells [25]. Previous mathematical

89

model for influenza [17] have considered about 107 initial target cells (U (0)). Initial values for infected

90

cells (I(0)) are taken as zero. V (0) is determined from estimations in Table 1. Note that V (0) cannot

91

be measured as it is below detectable levels (about 100 Copies/m) [21].

92

Viral kinetics are measured after the on-set of symptoms [21], however, it is unknown when the

93

initial infection took place. Patients infected with MERS-CoV in [26] showed that the virus peaked

94

during the second week of illness, which indicated that the median incubation period was 7 days (range,

95

2 to 14) [26]. For parameter fitting purposes, we explore three different scenarios of initial infection day

Infection time was assumed at -14, -7 and 0 days post symptom onset.
97

Infectivity can be defined as the ability of a pathogen to establish an infection [27]. To quantify

98

infectivity, the within-host reproductive number (R0 ) was computed. R0 is defined as the expected

99

number of secondary infections produced by an infected cell [28]. When R0 < 1, one infected individual

100

can infect less than one individual. Thus, the infection would be cleared from the population.

101

Otherwise, if R0 > 1, the pathogen is able to invade the target cell population. This epidemiological

102

concept has been applied to the target cell model (3)-(5), with

103

R0 =

U (0)pβ
.
cδ

(6)

Previous studies [13, 29, 30] provided estimates of the infecting time (tinf ), that represents the time

104

required for a single infectious cell to infect one more cell. Viruses with a shorter infecting time have a

105

higher infectivity [29, 30]. From equations (3)-(5), tinf can be explicitly computed as:

106

r
tinf =

2
.
pβU0

(7)

Assuming day of infection at day 0 post symptom onset (pso) would result in very high reproductive

107

numbers (R0 ) and a high infection rate (β) for patients A and B as presented in Table 2. Alternatively,

108

assuming the initial day of infection is either day -14 or -7 pso, then the rate of infection of susceptible

109

cells (β) would be slow but associated with a high replication rate (p).

110

Strikingly, Fig. 3(b) reveals a long period (about 4 days post infection) of viral replication below

111

detectable levels. Independently of the starting infection time (ti ), numerical results at the Table 2

112

reveal very consistent reproductive numbers for patients A and B (approximately 11),implying that

SARS-CoV-2 would invade most of the susceptible target cells. Remarkably, the infecting time tinf is

114

slow, about 30 hours. This may explain why SARS-CoV-2 can last several days (12-22 days pso) in

115

infected patients [21].

Target Cell Model with Eclipse Phase. To represent the time frame of the infection more
adequately, an additional state is added where newly infected cells spend time in a latent phase (E)
before becoming productively infected cells (I) [29, 31]. This can be written as follows:

U̇ = −βU V,

(8)

Ė = βU V − kE,

(9)

I˙ = kE − δI,

(10)

V̇ = pI − cV.

(11)

Cells in the eclipse phase (E) can become productively infected at rate k. Holder et al. [29]

117

considered different time distributions for the eclipse phase and viral release by infected cells for

118

influenza. Their results showed that the time distribution of the eclipse phase and viral release directly

119

affect the parameter estimation. For SARS-CoV-2 , Fig.4 the eclipse phase model (AIC≈34) does not

120

improve the fitting respect to the target cell model (Table 2) even when very long eclipse phase periods

121

are assumed (e.g 100 days), implying that this mechanism could be negligible on SARS-CoV-2 infection.

122

123

Mathematical Model with Immune Response. Previous studies have acknowledged the relevance
of the immune T-cell response to clear influenza [17, 32–36]. Due to identifiability limitations for the
estimation of the parameters of the target cell model using viral load data, a minimalistic model was
derived in [37, 38] to represent the interaction between the viral and immune response dynamics. The

Viral replication is modelled with a logistic function with maximum carrying capacity K and

124

replication rate p. The virus is cleared at a rate c. The term cT V T represents the rate of killing of

125

infected cells by the immune response. T cell homoeostasis is represented by sT = δT T (0), where T (0)

126

is the initial number of T cells and δT is the half life of T cells. The steady state condition must be

127

satisfied to guarantee the T cell homeostatic value T (0) = sT /δT in the absence of viral infection.

128

K is the maximum viral load for each of the patients in [21]. The half life of T cells is approximately

129

4-34 days [39], therefore we take δT = 2.9 × 10−2 . T cells can proliferate at a rate r, and we assumed

130

that the activation of T cell proliferation by V follows a log-sigmoidal form with half saturation

131

constant kT . The coefficient m relates to the width of the sigmoidal function. While different values of

132

m were tested, m = 2 rendered a better fit.

gives a better fitting than previous models (Fig.2-4). Furthermore, AICs values for patient A and B

136

highlight that ti = −15 dpso give the best fitting. For presentation purposes, numerical results for

137

patient A and B are the only portrayed in Fig.4. The summary of fitting procedures at ti = −15 dpso is

138

presented in Table 3. Independently of the starting infection day, the immune response by T cells peaks

139

between 5 to 10 dpso. Interestingly, the longer the period between infection time to the onset of

140

symptoms, the higher the immune response.

DISCUSSION

142

The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 first reported in Wuhan in December 2019 has paralysed our

143

societies, leading to self isolation and quarantine for several days. Indeed, COVID-19 is a major threat

144

to humans, with alarming levels of spread and death tolls, in particular on the eldery. The WHO

145

situation report published on 21 March 2020 reported 267013 confirmed cases and 11201 deaths [1].

146

COVID-19 is the first pandemic after the H1N1 ”swine flu” in 2009 [1]. While many mathematical

147

models have concentrated on the epidemiological level predicting how SARS-CoV-2 would spread, this

148

paper aims to model SARS-CoV-2 dynamics at the within-host level to quantify SARS-CoV-2 infection

149

kinetics in humans.

150

Data from [26] showed that MERS-CoV levels peak during the second week with a median value of

151

7.21 (log10 copies/mL)in the severe patient group, and about 5.54 (log10 copies/mL) in the mild group.

152

For SARS, the virus peaked at 5.7 (log10 copies/mL) between 7 to 10 days after onset [40]. For

153

COVID-19, the viral peak was approximately 8.85 (log10 copies/mL) before 5 dpso [21]. Liu et al. [41]

154

found that patients with severe disease reported a mean viral load on admission 60 times higher than

155

that of the mean of mild disease cases, implying that higher viral loads relate clinical outcomes.

156

Additionally, higher viral load persisted for 12 days after onset [41].

157

Using the target cell model, Nguyen et al. [13] computed for Ebola infection an average infecting

158

time of 9.49 hours, while Holder et al. [29] reported that infecting time for the wild-type (WT)

159

pandemic H1N1 influenza virus was approximately 0.5 hours [29]. Here, based on the results of the

160

target cell model in Table 2, we found that SARS-CoV-2 infecting time between cells (mean of 30 days

161

approximately) would be slower than those reported for Ebola (about 3 times slower) and influenza (60

162

times slower). The reproductive number for influenza in mice ranges from 1.7 to 5.35 [42], which is

163

consistent with the values reported for COVID-19.

164

Interestingly, both of our models (the target cell model (3)-(5) and the model with immune response

165

(12)-(13)), when fitted to the patient A data, predicts that the virus can replicate below detection levels

166

for the first 4 dpi. This could be an explanation of why infected patients with SARS-CoV-2 would take

167

from 2-14 dpi to exhibit symptoms.

168

The model with immune system (Fig.4(b and d)) highlights that the T cell response is slowly

169

mounted against SARS-CoV-2 [4]. Thus, the slow T cell response may promote a limit inflammation

170

levels [42], which might be a reason to the observations during COVID-19 pandemic of the detrimental

171

outcome on French patients that used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NADs) such as ibuprofen.

However, so far, there is not any conclusive clinical evidence on the adverse effects by NADs on

173

SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.

174

The humoral response against SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed to evaluate the protection to

175

reinfections. A longitudinal study in rhesus monkeys by Bao et al. [43] uncovered that infected monkeys

176

presented viral replication at 7 days post-infection (dpi). Significant increase of specific IgG were

177

detected at 14, 21 or 28 dpi. Infected monkeys were re-challenged after specific antibody tested

178

positively and symptoms vanished. Monkeys with re-exposure presented no recurrence of COVID-19,

179

highlighting that protection can be presented to subsequent exposures. Regarding antiviral drugs,

180

Remdesivir treatment has shown a good prophylactic effect during the first 24 hours post MERS-CoV

181

infection in a non-human primate model [44]. Furthermore, benefits has been reported for therapeutic

182

treatment if provided during 12 hours MERS-CoV infection [44]. Our study here mainly addressed T cell

183

responses, therefore, future modelling attempts should be directed to establish a more detailed model of

184

antibody production and cross-reaction [45] as well as in silico testing of different antivirals [46].

185

There are technical limitations in this study that need to be highlighted. The data for SARS-CoV-2

186

kinetics in [21] is at the onset of symptoms. This is a key aspect that can render biased parameter

187

estimation as the target cell regularly is assumed to initiate at the day of the infection. In fact, we could

188

miss viral dynamics at the onset of symptoms. For example, from throat samples in Rhesus macaques

189

infected with SARS-CoV-2 , two peaks were reported on most animals at 1 and 5 dpi [47].

190

In a more technical aspect using only viral load on the target cell model to estimate parameters may

191

lead to identifiability problems [48–51]. Thus, our parameter values should be taken with caution when

192

parameters quantifications are interpreted to address within-host mechanisms. For the model with

193

immune system, there is not data confrontation with immune response predictions, thus, new

194

measurements on cytokines and T cell responses would uncover new information.

195

The race to develop the first vaccine to tackle COVID-19 has started with the first clinical trial just

196

60 days after the genetic sequence of the virus. Modelling work developed in this paper paves the way

197

for future mathematical models of COVID-19 to reveal prophylactic and therapeutic interventions at

198

multi-scale levels [52–57]. Further insights into immunology and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 will help

199

to improve the outcome of this and future pandemics.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

201

Mathematical models

202

Mathematical models based on Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) are solved using the MATLAB

203

library ode45, which is considered for solving non-stiff differential equations [58].

204

Viral Kinetic Data of Patients Infected with SARS-CoV-2

205

The clinical data of 9 individuals is from [21]. Due to close contact with index cases and initial

206

diagnostic test before admission, patients were hospitalized in Munich [21]. Viral load kinetics were

207

reported in copies/ml per whole swab for 9 individual cases. All samples were taken about 2 to 4 days

208

post symptoms. Further details can be found in [21].

209

Parameter Estimation

210

Due to the viral load is measured in Log10 scales, parameter fitting is performed minimizing the root

211

mean square (RMS) difference on Log10 scales between the model predictive output (ȳi ), and the

212

experimental measurement (yi ):

213

v
u n
u1 X
RM S = t
(log(yi ) − log(ȳi ))2
n i=1

(14)

where n is the number of measurements. The minimization of RMS is performed using the Differential

214

Evolution (DE) algorithm [22]. Note that several optimization solvers were considered, including both

215

deterministic (f mincon Matlab routine) and stochastic (e.g Genetic and Annealing algorithm) methods.

216

Simulation results revealed that the DE global optimization algorithm is robust to initial guesses of

217

parameters than other mentioned methods.

218

Model Selection by AIC. The Akaike information criterion (AIC) is used here to compare the

219

goodness-of-fit for models that evaluate different hypotheses [59]. A lower AIC value means that a given

220

model describes the data better than other models with higher AIC values. Small differences in AIC

221

scores (e.g. <2) are not significant [59]. When a small number of data points, the corrected (AICc)

222

writes as follows:
