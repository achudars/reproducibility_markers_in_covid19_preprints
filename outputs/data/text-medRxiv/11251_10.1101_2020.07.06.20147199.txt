Assessing the effectiveness of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) to mitigate the spread

18

of SARS-CoV-2 is critical to inform future preparedness response plans. Here we quantify

19

the impact of 6,068 hierarchically coded NPIs implemented in 79 territories on the effec-

20

tive reproduction number, Rt , of COVID-19. We propose a novel modelling approach that

combines four computational techniques merging for the first time statistical, inference and

artificial intelligence tools. We validate our findings with two external datasets with 48,000

additional NPIs from 226 countries. Our results indicate that a suitable combination of NPIs

24

is necessary to curb the spread of the virus. Less intrusive and costly NPIs can be as effective

25

as more intrusive, drastic, ones, e.g., a national lockdown. Using country-specific what-if sce-

26

narios we assess how the effectiveness of NPIs depends on the local context such as timing of

27

their adoption, opening the way for forecasting the effectiveness of future interventions.

1 Introduction

29

In the absence of vaccines and antiviral medication, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs)

30

implemented in response to epidemic respiratory viruses are the only option to delay and moderate

31

the spread of the virus in a population 1 .

32

Confronted with the worldwide COVID-19 epidemic, most governments have implemented

33

bundles of highly restrictive, sometimes intrusive NPIs. Decisions had to be taken under rapidly

34

changing epidemiological situations, despite (at least in the very beginning of the epidemic) a lack

35

of scientific evidence on the individual and combined effectiveness of these measures 2–4 , degree of

36

compliance of the population, and societal impact.

37

Government interventions may cause substantial economic and social costs 5 as well as affect

38

individuals’ behaviour, mental health and social security 6 . Therefore, knowledge on the most

39

effective NPIs would allow stakeholders to judiciously and timely implement a specific sequence of

40

key interventions to combat a potential resurgence of COVID-19 or any other future respiratory

41

outbreak. As many countries rolled out several NPIs simultaneously, the challenge of disentangling

42

the impact of each individual intervention arises.

43

To date, studies of the country-specific progression of the COVID-19 pandemic 7 have mostly

44

explored the independent effects of a single category of interventions. These categories include

45

travel restrictions 2, 8 , social distancing 9–12 , or personal protective measures 13 . Some studies focused

46

on a single country or even a town 14–18 . Other research combined data from multiple countries

47

but pooled NPIs into rather broad categories

, which eventually limits the assessment of

48

specific, potentially critical, NPIs, that may be less costly and more effective than others. Despite

49

their widespread use, relative ease of implementation, broad choice of available tools, and their

50

importance in developing countries where other measures (e.g., increases in healthcare capacity,

51

social distancing, or enhanced testing) are difficult to implement 22 , little is currently known about

52

the effectiveness of different risk communication strategies. One reason for this knowledge gap

53

might be that many NPI trackers do not clearly code only-communication actions or cover such

54

measures rather superficially. For example, the WHO dataset

55

report communication strategies (or public awareness measures) in two broad categories. However,

56

an accurate assessment of communication activities requires information on the targeted public,

57

means of communication and content of the message. Other government communications are

58

sometimes summarized in non-communication categories (e.g., communication on social distancing

59

are included in "Social distancing" measures in the CoronaNet dataset and an extra data element

60

specifies the degree of compliance). Additionally, modelling studies typically focus on NPIs that

61

directly influence contact probabilities (e.g., social distancing 12, 18 , self-isolation 20 , etc.).

23

and the CoronaNet dataset

62

Using a comprehensive, hierarchically coded, data set of 6,068 NPIs implemented in 79

63

territories 25 , here we analyse the impact of government interventions on Rt , using harmonised

64

results from a new multi-method approach consisting of (i) a case-control analysis (CC), (ii) a

65

step function approach to LASSO time-series regression (LASSO), (iii) random forests (RF) and

66

(iv) Transformers (TF). We contend that the combination of four different methods, combining

67

statistical, inference and artificial intelligence classes of tools, allows to also assess the structural

68

uncertainty of individual methods 26 . We also investigate country-specific control strategies as well

69

as the impact of some selected country-specific metrics.

70

All approaches (i-iv) yield comparable rankings of the effectiveness of different categories of

71

NPIs across their hierarchical levels. This remarkable agreement allows us to identify a consensus

72

set of NPIs that lead to a significant reduction of Rt . We validate this consensus set using two

73

external datasets covering 42,151 measures in 226 countries. Further, we evaluate the heterogeneity

74

of the effectiveness of individual NPIs in different territories. We find that time of implementation,

75

already implemented measures, different governance indicators 27 , as well as human and social

76

development affect the effectiveness of NPIs in the countries to varying degrees.

77

2 Results

78

Global approach. Our main results are based on the CSH COVID-19 Control Strategies List

79

(CCCSL) 25 . This data set provides a hierarchical taxonomy of 6,068 NPIs, coded on four levels,

80

including eight broad themes (level 1, L1) are divided into 63 categories of individual NPIs (level 2,

81

L2) that include >500 subcategories (level 3, L3) and >2,000 codes (level 4, L4). We first compare

82

the results for the NPIs’ effectiveness rankings for the four methods of our approach (i-iv) on L1

83

(themes); see SI Figure S1. A clear picture emerges where the themes of social distancing and

84

travel restrictions are top-ranked in all methods, whereas environmental measures (e.g., cleaning

85

and disinfecting shared surfaces) are ranked least effective.

86

We next compare results obtained on L2 of the NPI data set, i.e., using the 46 NPI categories

87

implemented more than five times. The methods largely agree on the list of interventions that have a

88

significant effect on Rt , see Figure 1 and Table 1. The individual rankings are highly correlated with

89

each other (p = 0.0008, see Methods). Six NPI categories show significant impacts on Rt in all

90

four methods. In Table S3 we list the subcategories (L3) belonging to these consensus categories.

91

A normalised score for each NPI category is obtained by rescaling the result of each method

92

to range between zero (least effective) and one (most effective) and then averaging this score. The

93

maximal (minimal) NPI score is therefore 100% (0%), meaning that the measure is the most (least)

94

effective measure in each method. Amongst the six full consensus NPI categories, the largest

95

impacts on Rt are displayed by small gathering cancellations (83%, ∆Rt between −0.22 and -0.35),

96

the closure of educational institutions (with a score of 73% and estimates for ∆Rt ranging from

97

−0.15 to −0.21), and border restrictions (56%, ∆Rt between −0.057 and -0.23). The consensus

98

measures also include NPIs aiming to increase healthcare and public health capacities (increase

99

availability of personal protective equipment (PPE): 51%, ∆Rt −0.062 to −0.13), individual

100

movement restrictions (42%, ∆Rt −0.08 to −0.13) and national lockdown (including stay-at-home

101

order in US states) (25%, ∆Rt −0.008 to −0.14).

102

We find fourteen additional NPI categories consensually in three of our methods. These

103

include mass gathering cancellations (53%, ∆Rt between −0.13 and -0.33), risk communication

104

activities to inform and educate the public (48%, ∆Rt between -0.18 and -0.28), and government

105

assistance to vulnerable populations (41%, ∆Rt between −0.17 and -0.18).

106

Amongst the least effective interventions we find: government actions to provide or receive

international help, measures to enhance testing capacity or improve case detection strategy (which

108

can be expected to lead to a short-term rise in cases), tracing and tracking measures, as well as land

109

border and airport health checks and environmental cleaning.

110

In Figure 2 we visualise the findings on the NPIs’ effectiveness in a co-implementation

111

network. Nodes correspond to categories (L2) with a size being proportional to their normalised

112

score. Directed links from i to j indicate a tendency that countries implement NPI j after they

113

implemented i. The network therefore illustrates the typical NPI implementation sequence in the 56

114

countries and the steps within this sequence that contribute most to a reduction of Rt . For instance,

115

there is a pattern where countries first cancel mass gatherings before moving on to cancellations

116

of specific types of small gatherings, where the latter associates on average with more substantial

117

reductions in Rt . Education and active communication is one of the most effective ”early measures”

118

(implemented around 15 days before 30 cases were reported and well before the majority of other

119

measures comes). Most social distancing (i.e., closure of educational institutions), travel restriction

120

measures (i.e., individual movement restrictions like curfew, national lockdown) and measures to

121

increase the availability of PPE are typically implemented within the first two weeks after reaching

122

30 cases with varying impacts on the Rt ; see also Figure 1.

123

Within the CC approach, we can further explore these results on a finer hierarchical level.

124

We show results for 18 NPIs (L3) of the risk communication theme in the SI; see Table S2. The

125

most effective communication strategies include warnings against travel to and return from high

126

risk areas (∆Rt = −0.14(1)) and several measures to actively communicate with the public.

These include to encourage, e.g., staying at home (∆Rt = −0.14(1)), social distancing (∆Rt =

128

−0.20(1)), workplace safety measures (∆Rt = −0.18(2)), self-initiated isolation of people with

129

mild respiratory symptoms (∆Rt = −0.19(2)) as well as information campaigns (∆Rt = −0.13(1))

130

(through various channels such as press, flyers, social media, or phone messages).

131

Validation with external datasets. We validate our findings with results from two external datasets,

132

see Methods. In the WHO-PHSM dataset 23 we find seven full-consensus measures (agreement

133

on significance by all methods) and 17 further measures with three agreements, see SI Figure S27.

134

These consensus measures show a large overlap with the consensus measures (three or four matches

135

in our methods) identified using the CCCSL and includes as top-ranked NPI measures aiming at

136

strengthening the healthcare system and the testing capacity (labeled as "Scaling up"), e.g., increase

137

healthcare workforce, purchase of medical equipment, tests, masks, financial support to hospitals,

138

increase patient capacity, increase domestic production of PPE). Other consensus measures consist

139

of social distancing measures ("Cancelling, restricting or adapting private gatherings outside the

140

home", adapting or closing "offices, businesses, institutions and operations", "cancelling, restricting

141

or adapting mass gatherings"), measures for special populations ("protecting population in closed

142

settings", encompassing long-term care facilities and prisons), school closures, (international and

143

domestic) travel restrictions (stay-at-home order – equivalent to confinement in the WHO-PHSM

144

coding – restricting entry and exit, travel advice and warning, "closing international land borders",

145

"entry screening and isolation or quarantine)". "Wearing a mask" exhibits a significant impact on Rt

146

in three methods (∆Rt between −0.018 and -0.12). The consensus measures also include financial

147

packages and general public awareness campaigns (as part of "Communications and engagement"

actions). The least effective measures include active case detection, contact tracing, as well as

149

environmental cleaning and disinfection.

150

The CCCSL results are also compatible with findings from the CoronaNet dataset

24

; see

151

SI Figures S28–S29. Analyses show four full-consensus measures and 13 further NPIs with an

152

agreement of three methods. These consensus measures include general social distancing measures

153

(no specific coding available), restriction and regulation of non-essential businesses, restrictions of

154

mass gatherings, closure and regulation of schools, travel restrictions (e.g., internal and external

155

border restrictions, curfew), measures aiming to increase healthcare workforce (e.g., "Nurses",

156

"Unspecified health staff") and medical equipment (e.g., PPE, "Ventilators", "Unspecified health

157

materials"), quarantine (i.e., voluntary or mandatory self-quarantine and quarantine at a government

158

hotel or facility), and measures to increase public awareness ("Disseminating information related to

159

COVID-19 to the public that is reliable and factually accurate").

160

Twenty-three NPIs in the CoronaNet dataset do not show statistical significance in any method,

161

including several restrictions and regulations of government services (e.g., for tourist sites, parks,

162

public museums, telecommunications), hygiene measures for public areas, and other measures that

163

target very specific populations (e.g., certain age groups, visa extensions).

164

Country-level approach. A sensitivity check of our results with respect to the removal of individ-

165

ual continents from the analysis also indicates substantial variations between world geographical

166

regions in terms of NPI effectiveness (see SI). To further quantify how much the effectiveness of

167

an NPI depends on the particular territory (country or US state) where it has been introduced, we

168

measure the heterogeneity of the NPI rankings in different territories through an entropic approach

169

in the transformer (TF) method; see Methods. Figure 3 shows the normalised entropy of each NPI

170

category versus its rank. A value of entropy close to zero implies that the corresponding NPI has a

171

similar rank relative to all other NPIs in all territories. In other words, the effectiveness of the NPI

172

does not depend on the specific country or state. On the other hand, a high value of the normalised

173

entropy signals that the performance of each NPI depends largely on the geographical region.

174

The values of the normalised entropies for many NPIs are far from being one and below the

175

corresponding values obtained through a temporal reshuffling of the NPIs in each country. The

176

effectiveness of many NPIs therefore is, first, significant and, second, heavily dependent on the

177

local context, which is a combination of socio-economic features and NPIs already adopted. In

178

general, social distancing measures and travel restrictions show a high entropy (effectiveness varies

179

a lot across countries) whereas case identification, contact tracing and healthcare measures show

180

substantially less country dependence.

181

We further explore this interplay of NPIs with socio-economic factors by analysing the effects

182

of demographic and socio-economic covariates, as well as indicators for governance, human and

183

economic development in the CC method (see SI). While the effects of most indicators vary across

184

different NPIs at rather moderate levels, we find a robust tendency that NPI effectiveness correlates

185

negatively with indicator values for governance-related accountability and political stability (as

186

quantified by World Governance Indicators provided by the World Bank).

187

The heterogeneity of the effectiveness of individual NPIs across countries points to a non13

188

independence among the different NPIs, therefore the impact of a specific NPI cannot be evaluated

189

in isolation. Instead, one has to look at the combination of NPIs adopted in a particular country.

190

Since it is not possible in the real world to change the sequence of NPIs adopted, we resort to

191

what-if experiments to identify the most likely outcome of an artificial sequence of NPIs in each

192

specific country. Within the TF approach, we selectively knock-out one NPI at the time from all the

193

sequences of interventions in all countries and compute the ensuing evolution of Rt compared to

194

the actual case.

195

To quantify whether the effectiveness of a specific NPI depends on its epidemic age of

196

implementation, we study artificial sequences of NPIs constructed by shifting the selected NPI to

197

other days, keeping the other NPIs fixed. In this way, for each country and each NPI, we obtain a

198

curve of the most likely change of Rt vs the adoption time of the specific NPI.

199

Figure 4 reports an example of the results for a selection of NPIs (we refer to the SI for a

200

larger report about other NPIs). Each curve shows the average change of Rt vs the adoption time

201

of the NPI, averaged over the countries where the NPI has been adopted. Panel A refers to the

202

national lockdown (including stay-at-home order implemented in the US states). Our results show a

203

moderate effect of this NPI (low change in Rt ) as compared to other, less drastic measures. Panel B

204

shows NPIs with a "the earlier, the better" pattern. For those measures ("Closure of educational

205

institutions", "Small gatherings cancellation", "Airport restrictions" and many more in the SI) early

206

adoption is always more beneficial. Panel C, "Enhancing testing capacity" and "Surveillance",

207

exhibit a negative impact (i.e., an increase) on Rt presumably related to the fact that more testing

208

allows for surfacing more cases. Finally, Panel D, showing "Tracing and tracking" and "Activate

209

case notification", display an initially negative effect that turns positive (i.e., toward a reduction of

210

Rt ). We refer to the Supplementary Information for a more comprehensive analysis of all the NPIs.

211

3 Discussion

212

Our study dissects the entangled packages of NPIs 25 and quantifies their effectiveness. We validate

213

our findings using three different datasets and four independent methods. Our findings suggest

214

that no NPI acts as a silver bullet on the spread of COVID-19. Instead, we identify several

215

decisive interventions that significantly contribute to reducing Rt below one and should therefore be

216

considered to efficiently flatten the curve facing a potential second COVID-19 wave or any similar

217

future viral respiratory epidemics.

218

The most effective NPIs include curfews, lockdowns, and closing and restricting places where

219

people gather in smaller or large numbers for an extended period of time. This includes small

220

gathering cancellations (closures of shops, restaurants, gatherings of 50 persons or less, mandatory

221

home office, etc.) and closure of educational institutions. While in previous studies based on

222

smaller numbers of countries, school closures had been attributed a little effect on the spread of

223

COVID-19 19, 20 , more recent evidence has been in favour of the importance of this NPI 28, 29 . School

224

closures in the US have been found to reduce COVID-19 incidence and mortality by about 60%

225

226

28

. This result is also in line with a contact tracing study from South Korea, which identified

adolescents aged 10–19 as more likely to spread the virus than adults and children in household

settings 30 . Individual movement restrictions (including curfew, the prohibition of gatherings and

228

movements for non-essential activities or measures segmenting the population) were also amongst

229

the top-ranked measures.

230

However, such radical measures present with adverse consequences. School closure interrupts

231

learning, can lead to poor nutrition, stress and social isolation in children 31–33 . Home confinement

232

has strongly increased the rate of domestic violence in many countries, with a huge impact on women

, while it has also limited the access to long-term care, such as chemotherapy, with

.

Previous statistical studies on the effectiveness of lockdowns came to mixed conclusions.

238

Whereas a relative reduction of Rt of 5% was estimated using a Bayesian hierarchical model 19 , a

239

Bayesian mechanistic model estimated a reduction of 80% 20 , though some questions have been

240

raised regarding the latter work 26 . Our results point to a mild impact of them due to an overlap with

241

effects of other measures adopted earlier and included in what is referred to as “national (or full)

242

lockdown”. Indeed, the national lockdown encompasses multiple NPIs (e.g., closure of land, sea

243

and air borders, schools, non-essential shops, prohibition of gatherings, of visiting nursing homes)

244

that countries may have already adopted. From this perspective, the relatively attenuated impact of

245

the national lockdown is explained as the little delta after other concurrent NPIs have been adopted.

246

This conclusion does not rule out the effectiveness of an early national lockdown but suggests that a

18

247

suitable combination (sequence and time of implementation) of a smaller package of such measures

248

can substitute a full lockdown in terms of effectiveness while reducing adverse impacts on the

249

society, economy, humanitarian response system, and the environment 6, 39–41 .

250

Taken together, the social distancing and movement restriction measures discussed above can

251

therefore be seen as the “nuclear option” of NPIs: highly effective but causing substantial collateral

252

damages on society, the economy, trade, and human rights

4, 39

.

253

We find strong support for the effectiveness of border restrictions. The role of travelling in the

254

global spread of respiratory diseases has proved central during the first SARS epidemic (2002-2003)

255

42

, but travelling restrictions show a large impact on trade, economy, and humanitarian response

258

geographic coverage, and classifications of NPIs 2, 8–11, 13, 19, 20 .

259

. The effectiveness of social distancing and travel restrictions is also in line

We also find a number of highly effective NPIs that can be considered to be less costly. For

260

instance, we find that risk communication strategies feature prominently amongst consensus NPIs.

261

This includes government actions intended to educate and actively communicate with the public. To

262

the best of our knowledge, our study provides the first quantitative evidence for the effectiveness

263

of such measures. The effective policies include encouraging staying at home, promoting social

264

distancing and workplace safety measures, encouraging the self-initiated isolation of people with

265

symptoms, travel warnings, as well as information campaigns (mostly via social media). All these

266

measures are non-binding government advice, contrasting with the mandatory border restriction and

267

social distancing measures that are often enforced by police or army interventions and sanctions.

268

Surprisingly, communicating on the importance of social distancing has been only marginally

269

less effective than imposing distancing measures by law. The publication of guidelines and work

270

safety protocols to managers and healthcare professionals was also associated with a reduction

271

of Rt , suggesting that communication efforts also need to be tailored toward key stakeholders.

272

Communication strategies aim at empowering communities with correct information about COVID-

273

19. Such measures can be of crucial importance to target specific demographic strata found to play a

274

dominant role in driving the COVID-19 spread (e.g., communication strategies to target individuals

275

aged <40y 44 )

276

Government food assistance programs and other financial supports for vulnerable populations

277

(via taxation) also turned out to be highly effective. Such measures are, therefore, not only impacting

278

the socio-economic sphere 45 but have also a positive effect on public health. For instance, facilitating

279

people’s access to tests or allowing them to self-isolate without fear of losing their job, may help

280

reducing the Rt .

281

Some measures are ineffective in (almost) all methods and datasets, e.g., environmental

282

measures to disinfect and clean surfaces and objects in public and semi-public places. This finding

283

is at odds with current recommendations of the WHO for environmental cleaning in non-healthcare

284

settings

285

environmental measures (e.g., cleaning of shared surfaces, waste management, approval of a new

286

disinfectant, increase ventilation) is seldom reported by governments or media, and therefore not

46

and calls for a closer examination of the effectiveness of such measures. However,

20

287

collected by the NPI trackers, which could lead to an under-estimation of their impact. We also find

288

no evidence for the effectiveness of social distancing measures in public transports. While infections

289

on busses and trains have been reported 47 , our results may suggest a limited contribution of such

290

cases to the overall virus spread. A heightened public risk awareness associated with commuting

291

(e.g., people being more likely to wear face masks) might contribute to this finding 48 . However,

292

we should notice that measures aiming a limiting engorgement or increasing distancing in public

293

transports have been highly diverse (from complete cancellation of all public transports to increase

294

in frequency of the traffic to reduce traveler density) and could therefore lead to largely different

295

effectiveness, also depending on the local context.

296

The effectiveness of individual NPIs is heavily influenced by governance (see SI) and local

297

context, as evidenced by the results of the entropic approach. This local context includes the stage

298

of the epidemic, socio-economic, cultural and political characteristics, and other NPIs already

299

implemented. By focusing on individual countries, the what-if experiments using artificial country-

300

specific sequences of NPIs offer a novel way to quantify the importance of this local context with

301

respect to measure effectiveness. Our main takeaway here is that one and the same NPI can have a

302

drastically different impact if taken early or later, or in a different country.

303

It is interesting to comment on the impact that "Enhancing testing capacity" and "Tracing

304

and tracking" would have had if adopted at different points in times. Counterintuitively, tracing,

305

tracking and testing measures should display a short-term increase of Rt if they are effective, as

306

more cases will be found. For countries implementing these measures early this is indeed what

21

307

we find. However, countries implementing these NPIs later did not necessarily find more cases,

308

as shown by the corresponding decrease in Rt , We focused on March and April 2020, a period

309

in which many countries had surged in positive cases that overwhelmed their testing and tracing

310

capacities, which rendered the corresponding NPIs ineffective.

311

Strengths & Limitations. The assessment of the effectiveness of NPIs is statistically challenging,

312

as measures were typically implemented simultaneously and because their impact might well depend

313

on the particular implementation sequence. Some NPIs appear in almost all countries whereas

314

others only in few, meaning that we could miss some rare but effective measures due to a lack

315

of statistical power. While some methods might be prone to overestimating effects from an NPI

316

due to insufficient adjustments for confounding effects from other measures, other methods might

317

underestimate the contribution of an NPI by assigning its impact to a highly correlated NPI. As

318

a consequence, estimates of ∆Rt might vary substantially across different methods, whereas the

319

agreement on the significance of individual NPIs is much more pronounced. The strength of our

320

study, therefore, lies in the harmonization of these four independent methodological approaches,

321

combined with the usage of an extensive data set on NPIs. This allows us to estimate the structural

322

uncertainty of NPI effectiveness, i.e., the uncertainty introduced by choosing a certain model

323

structure. Moreover, whereas previous studies often subsumed a wide range of social distancing

324

and travel restriction measures under a single entity, our analysis contributes to a more fine-grained

325

understanding of each NPI.

326

The CCCSL data set features non-homogeneous data completeness across the different

22

327

territories and data collection could be biased by the data collector (native versus non-native) as

328

well as the information communicated by governments. Moreover, the coding system presents some

329

drawbacks, notably because some interventions could belong to more than one category but are

330

only recorded once. Compliance with NPIs is crucial for their effectiveness, yet we assumed a

331

comparable degree of compliance by each population. We tried to mitigate this issue by validating

332

our findings on two external databases, even if those are subject to similar limitations. Additionally,

333

we neither took into account the stringency of NPI implementation, and not all methods were able to

334

describe potential variations of NPI effectiveness over time, besides the dependency on the epidemic

335

age of its adoption.

336

To compute Rt , we used time-series of the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases 49 . This

337

approach is likely to over-represent patients with severe symptoms and may be biased by variations

338

in testing and reporting policies among countries. We assume a constant serial interval (average

339

time-span between primary and secondary infection), however, this number shows considerable

340

variations in the literature 50 and depends on measures such as social distancing and self-isolation.

341

4 Conclusions

342

Here we presented the outcome of an extensive analysis on the impact of 6,068 individual NPIs on

343

the effective reproduction number Rt of COVID-19 in 79 territories worldwide. The adoption of the

344

CCCSL data set 25 on NPIs and the use of two external validation datasets, encompassing together

345

more than 48,000 NPIs over 226 countries, makes our study the largest on NPI effectiveness to

346

date 20, 21, 24, 51 .

347

The emerging picture reveals that no one-size-fits-all solution exists, and no single NPI can

348

decrease Rt below one. Instead, in the absence of a vaccine or efficient anti-viral medication,

349

a resurgence of COVID-19 cases can only be stopped by a suitable combination of NPIs, each

350

tailored to the specific country and its epidemic age. These measures must be enacted in the optimal

351

combination and sequence to be maximally effective on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and thereby

352

enable a faster re-opening.

353

We showed that the most effective measures include closing and restricting most places where

354

people gather in smaller or larger numbers for extended periods of time (businesses, bars, schools,

355

etc). However, we also find several highly effective measures that are less intrusive. These include

356

land border restrictions, governmental support to vulnerable populations and risk communication

357

strategies. We strongly recommend governments and other stakeholders to first consider the adoption

358

of such NPIs, tailored to the local context, should infection numbers (re-)surge, before choosing the

359

most intrusive options. Less drastic measures may also foster better compliance from the population.

360

Notably, the simultaneous consideration of many distinct NPI categories allows us to move

361

beyond the simple evaluation of individual classes of NPIs to assess the collective impact of specific

362

sequences of interventions instead. The ensemble of these results calls for a strong effort to simulate

363

“what-if” scenarios at the country level for planning the most likely effectiveness of future NPIs,

364

and, thanks to the possibility to go down to the level of individual countries and country specific

365

circumstances, our approach is the first contribution to this end.

5 Methods

541

Data

542

NPI data. We use the publicly available Complexity Science Hub Vienna COVID-19

543

Control Strategies list (CCCSL) dataset on NPIs 25 . Therein, NPIs are categorised using a four-

544

level hierarchical coding scheme: L1 defines the theme of the NPI: “Case identification, contact

545

tracing and related measures”, “Environmental measures”, “Healthcare and public health capacity”,

546

“Resource allocation”, “Returning to normal life”, “Risk communication”, “Social distancing” and

547

“Travel restriction”. Each L1 (theme) is composed of several categories (L2 of the coding scheme),

548

that contain subcategories (L3) which are further subdivided to group codes (L4). The data set

549

covers 56 countries; data for the USA is available at the state level (24 states). This makes a total

550

of 79 territories. In this analysis, we use a static version of the CCCSL, retrieved on 17 August

551

2020, presenting 6,068 NPIs. A glossary of the codes is provided on github. For each country, we

552

use the data until the day to which the measures have been reliably updated. NPIs that have been

553

implemented in less than five territories are not considered, leading to a final number of 4,780 NPIs

554

of 46 different L2 categories to be used in the analyses.

It is made available under a CC-BY 4.0 International license .

Secondly, we use the CoronaNet COVID-19 Government Response Event Dataset (v1.0)

555

556

24

that contains 31,532 interventions and covers 247 territories (countries and US states) (data

557

extracted on 2020-08-17). For our analysis, we map their columns ”type” and ”type_sub_cat” onto

558

L1 and L2, respectively. Definitions for the total 116 L2 categories can be found on the GitHub

559

page of the project. Using the same criterion as for the CCCSL, we obtain a final number of 18,919

560

NPIs of 107 different categories.

Thirdly, we use the WHO Global Dataset of Public Health and Social Measures (thereafter

561

23

called WHO-PHSM)

563

COVID-19 Government Response Tracker

564

(GPHIN) of Public Health Agency of Canada (Ottawa, Canada), the CCCSL

565

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, Atlanta, USA) and the HIT-COVID data set

566

53

which merges and harmonizes the following data sets: ACAPS

41

562

52

, Oxford

, the Global Public Health Intelligence Network
25

, the United States

. The WHO-PHSM Dataset contains 24,077 interventions and covers 264 territories (countries

567

and US states) (data extracted on 2020-08-17). Their encoding scheme has a heterogeneous coding

568

depth, and for our analysis we map ”who_category” onto L1, and either take ”who_subcategory”

569

or a combination of ”who_subcategory” and ”who_measure” as L2. This results in 40 measure

570

categories. A glossary is available at: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-

571

2019/phsm.

572

COVID-19 case data. To estimate the effective reproduction number Rt , and growth rates

573

of the number of COVID-19 cases, we use time series of the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases

574

in the 79 considered territories

49

. To control for weekly fluctuations, we smooth the time series

575

by computing the rolling average using a Gaussian window with a standard deviation of two days,

576

truncated at a maximum window size of 15 days.

577

Regression techniques. We apply four different statistical approaches to quantify the impact of a

578

NPI M on the reduction of Rt (see details in the SI).

579

Case-control analysis. The case-control analysis (CC) considers each single category (L2)

580

or subcategory (L3) M separately and evaluates in a matched comparison the difference ∆Rt in

581

the Rt between all countries that implemented M (cases) with those that did not implement it

582

(controls) during the observation window. The matching is done on epidemic age and the time

583

of implementing any response. The comparison is made via a linear regression model adjusting

584

for (i) epidemic age (days after the country has reached 30 confirmed cases), (ii) the value of Rt

585

before M takes effect, (iii) total population, (iv) population density, (v) the total number of NPIs

586

implemented and (vi) number of NPIs implemented in the same category as M . With this design,

587

we investigate the time delay of τ days between implementing M and observing ∆Rt , as well as

588

additional country-based covariates that quantify other dimensions of governance and human and

589

economic development. Estimates for Rt are averaged over delays between 1 and 28 days.

590

Step function Lasso regression.

In this approach, we assume that without any intervention,

591

the reproduction factor is constant and deviations from this constant are caused by a delayed onset

592

by τ days of each NPI on L2 (categories) of the hierarchical data set. We use a Lasso regularization

36

593

approach combined with a meta parameter search to select a reduced set of NPIs that best describe

594

the observed ∆Rt . Estimates for the changes of ∆Rt attributable to NPI M are obtained from

595

country-wise cross-validation.

596

Random forest regression.

We perform a random forest (RF) regression, where the NPIs

597

implemented in a country are used as predictors for Rt , time-shifted τ days into the future. Here, τ

598

accounts for the time delay between implementation and onset of the effect of a given NPI. Similar

599

to the Lasso regression, the assumption underlying the random forest approach is that without

600

changes in interventions, the effective reproduction number in a territory remains constant. But

601

contrary to the two methods described above, the random forest represents a nonlinear model,

602

meaning that the effects of individual NPIs on Rt do not need to add up linearly. The importance of

603

a NPI is defined as the decline in the predictive performance of the random forest on unseen data if

604

the data concerning that NPI is replaced by noise, also called permutation importance.

605

Transformers modelling.

Transformers 54 have proven themselves as suitable models for

606

dynamic discrete elements processes such as textual sequences due to their ability to recall past

607

events. Here we extended the Transformer architecture to approach the continuous case of epidemic

608

data by removing the probabilistic output layer with a linear combination of the Transformer output,

609

whose input is identical to the one for the random forest regression, along with the values of Rt . The

610

best performing network (least mean squared error in country-wise cross-validation) is identified

611

as a Transformer encoder having four hidden layers of 128 neurons, an embedding size of 128,

37

612

eight heads, one output described by a linear output layer, and 47 inputs (corresponding to each

613

category and Rt ). To quantify the impact of a measure M on Rt , we use the trained Transformer

614

as a predictive model and compare simulations without any measure (reference) to simulations

615

where one measure is presented at a time to assess ∆Rt . To reduce the effects of overfitting and

616

multiplicity of local minima, we report results from an ensemble of Transformers trained to similar

617

precision levels.

618

Estimation of the effective reproduction number. We use the R package EpiEstim

619

sliding time window of 7 days to estimate the time series of the effective reproduction number Rt

620

for every country. We choose an uncertain serial interval following a probability distribution with a

621

mean of 4.46 days and a standard deviation of 2.63 days 56 .

622

Ranking of NPIs. For each of the four methods (CC, Lasso regression and TF), we rank the NPI

623

categories in descending order according to their impact, i.e., the estimated degree to which they

624

lower Rt or their feature importance (RF). To compare the rankings, we count how many of the

625

46 considered NPIs are classified as belonging to the top X ranked measures in all methods and

626

test the null hypothesis that this overlap has been obtained from completely independent rankings.

627

The p-value is then given by the complementary cumulative distribution function for a binomial

Co-implementation network. If there is a statistical tendency that a country implementing NPI i

632

also implements NPI j later in time, we draw a directed link from i to j. Nodes are placed on the

633

y-axis according to the average epidemic age at which the corresponding NPI is implemented; they

634

are grouped on the x axis by their L1 theme. Node colours correspond to themes. The effectiveness

635

scores for all NPIs are rescaled between zero and one for each method; node size is proportional to

636

the rescaled scores, averaged over all methods.

Entropic country-level approach. Each territory can be characterised by its socio-economic

638

conditions and the unique temporal sequence of NPIs adopted. To quantify the NPI effect, we

639

measure the heterogeneity of the overall rank of a NPI amongst the countries that have taken that

640

NPI. To compare countries which have implemented different numbers of NPIs, we consider the

641

normalised rankings, where the ranking position is divided by the number of elements in the ranking

642

list (i.e., the number of NPIs taken in a specific country). We then bin the interval [0, 1] of the

643

normalised rankings into 10 subintervals and compute for each NPI the entropy of the distribution

644

of occurrences of the NPI in the different normalised rankings per country:

where pi is the probability that the considered NPI appeared in the i-th bin in the normalised

647

with expectations from a temporal reshuffling of the data. For each country, we keep the same NPIs

6 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

667

Case-control analysis. We perform a case-control regression analysis to quantify the impact of

668

implementing an NPI measure on the effective reproduction number, Rt . The central idea is to

669

compare all countries that have implemented a certain measure with all countries that have not

670

implemented this measure at the same stage of the epidemic while adjusting for several country-

671

specific covariates through regression analysis. These covariates include timing (time-span between

672

the day on which more than 30 cases were confirmed and the day the measure was implemented),

673

baseline Rt (reproduction number before the measure was implemented), size and population

674

density, as well as covariates for how many other measures have already been implemented. It is

675

assumed that implementing a NPI on day t will have measurable impacts on Rt at day t + τ . We

676

also study how various country-specific indicators for economic and human development as well as

677

governance impact on these results.

678

Exposure variable.

We consider each NPI implemented in more than ten countries. We

679

include measures published by 25 on two different resolution levels (L2 and L3) separately. Let TM

680

be the day on which a country implemented measure M . The covariates and outcome variables

681

are measured relative to this point in time. As an exposure variable, we use a dummy variable, X,

682

encoding whether a country has implemented the measure during the observation window or not.

Figure S1: Comparison of effectiveness rankings on the coarsest hierarchical level for the casecontrol analysis (CC), LASSO regression (LASSO), random forest regression (RF), and transformer
analysis (TF). To obtain a ranking of the eight different themes (L1) of NPIs, we sum the impacts
of the 3 highest ranked categories of each theme and then rank the themes according to this
cumulative impact. All methods indicate that NPIs belonging to the themes of social distancing,
travel restrictions as well as healthcare and public health capacity lead to the most significant
reductions of Rt . Environmental measures (e.g., cleansing public places) are ranked least effective
in each approach.

683

Covariates.

We include the following covariates in all analyses. First, a country’s epidemic

684

age when measure M was implemented, A(M ), defined as the number of days between the

685

implementation of the measure, TM , and the first day with more than 30 confirmed cases, denoted

686

by T0 , giving A(M ) = TM − T0 . Second, the baseline effective reproduction number, RtBL , is taken

687

at day TM + τ . Third and fourth, we include for each country the logarithms of its total population

688

P and population density D 57 . Furthermore, we include the number N All (TM ) of all implemented

689

L2 measures and the number N L2 (TM ) of all measures (L2 or L3) from the same categories as M

690

that have been implemented before TM . These covariates are supposed to capture whether a country

691

introduces the intervention under consideration early or late in relation to its epidemic age and the

692

number of measures already taken.

693

Outcome variable. As a dependent variable in the regression, we consider the change in

694

effective reproduction number after implementation of the measure, ∆Rt (τ ) = RtM (τ ) − RtBL ,

695

where RtM is the value of Rt taken on day TM + τ . We report the average of ∆Rt (τ ) taken over

696

time lags 0 < τ ≤ 28.

697

Matching.

As cases we include all countries implementing a given measure at a time

698

A(M c ) > τ . As controls we consider all other countries that have not implemented this measure

699

within the observation window but that implemented any other intervention not more than one day

700

sooner or later than its matched case. These matching criteria ensure that we do not introduce a bias

701

by comparing countries that implemented any response with countries that did nothing at all and

702

703

maybe had the epidemics already under control.

Additional country variables.

We consider variables that capture economic and human

704

development, as well as different dimensions of governance. Economic development is measured by

705

the country’s per capita GDP adjusted for power purchasing parity (PPP) 58 . Human development is

706

quantified by the human development index (HDI), an indicator provided by the United Nations

707

Development Programme taking life expectancy, education, and per capita income into account 59 .

708

Finally, we consider six different dimensions of governance as quantified by the World Governance

709

Indicators (WGI) 60 . These indicators include Voice & Accountability (free media, the extent to

710

which citizens participate in the government), Political Stability (including the absence of violence),

711

Government Effectiveness (quality of public services), Regulatory Quality (the ability of government

712

to implement sound policies), Rule of Law (the extent to which citizens abide by the rules of society)

713

and Control of Corruption.

714

Statistical analysis and multiple testing.

A linear regression model of the form,

∆Rt ∼ RtBL + A(M ) + P + D + N All (TM ) + N L2 (TM ) + X

,

(S1)

715

is evaluated for all NPIs meeting the inclusion criteria. We evaluate the above model for all measures

716

and permissible delays τ . We adjust for multiple testing by controlling the false discovery rate at

717

level 0.0001 via the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. We investigate the impact of the additional

718

country variables by evaluating models as in Eq. (S1) with an additional term for the considered

719

indicator.

720

Lasso regression. We assume that without any implemented NPIs, the R(t) is constant, and

721

deviations are caused by a time-delayed onset of the effects of each NPI on L2. This hypothesis is

722

an oversimplification of the reality, but it allows to estimate this time-delay itself and to quantify

723

magnitudes of impacts for each NPI. A similar approach has been reported, for instance, in

724

although the authors use a smaller list of NPIs.

Cross-validation and meta-parameter search. This model includes two meta-parameters

observations with this model for the CCCSL/CORONANET/WHOPHSM, see Fig. S5.

764

Final coefficient estimation. We estimate the ranges of each NPI effectiveness shown in

765

Figs. S12, S16 and S20, using a territory-wise cross-validation, i.e., by reducing the sizes of test

766

groups to one. For each estimation leaving out one territory, we compute the coefficients βM for

767

each NPI M and βc for all territories c. We identify these coefficients βM and βc as the change

768

∆Rt . Shown intervals contain 95% of all observed values, with the center indicating the median.

769

From the overall 126/355/305 coefficients β, the feature selection aspect of lasso regression finds

770

23/19/23 relevant NPI coefficients and 1/1/23 relevant territory coefficients, while other coefficients

771

are estimated as zero (for CCCSL/CORONANET/WHOPHSM) Note that this does not indicate that

772

these NPIs are useless to reduce the spread of the virus, but rather that the algorithm can explain all

773

observations with a smaller number of coefficients. The number of selected coefficients is highly

774

sensitive to the value of the penalty parameter, however, the more impactful NPIs are consistently

775

present with similar coefficients (see Fig S5CFI).

increases as the algorithm uses more NPIs to explain the training data. This overfitting,

however, reduces the ability to fit the previously unseen test data. In contrast, for large penalty
parameters α, not enough NPIs are used to explain the data, and the method cannot explain either
training or test data. The optimal meta parameters are found as (τ, α)CCCSL = (11, 0.005623),
(τ, α)CORONANET = (15, 0.004217) and (τ, α)WHOPHSM = (11, 0.00100) (C,F,I) Effects of all NPIs
and territories vary when changing the penalty parameter α. However, most of the effects of the
significant NPIs (see Figs. S12, S16 and S20) stay roughly constant, only the number of significant
NPIs increases.

Random forest regression. We use random forest regression 63 as a third method to assess the

777

impact of the implemented measures on the spreading of COVID-19, measured in terms of the

778

effective reproduction number Rt .

779

We represent for each country and each day of the observation period the NPIs which have

780

been implemented in that country until that day in the form of a binary vector. The analysis is

781

performed on the NPI categories (L2). The binary data on implemented NPIs in a given country on

782

day t is regressed on the value of Rt in that country τ days later, Rt+τ . The time shift τ accounts

783

for the time delay between infection and case confirmation. We vary τ between τ = 0 and τ = 20.

784

Each random forest consists of 500 decision trees with maximum depth d. At each split of a

785

node in one of the trees in the random forest, m randomly selected NPI categories out of the total

786

number of 46 categories are considered. We employ bootstrapping, meaning that each decision tree

787

is fitted on a different random subset containing 75% of the rows of the predictor matrix.

788

789

790

To implement the random forest regression, we use the RandomForestRegressor class from
the python library scikit-learn 64 .

Cross validation. For each 0 ≤ τ ≤ 20, we use 10-fold country-wise cross validation to

791

determine the optimal values of the maximum tree depth d and percentage of considered features m.

792

We vary the parameters d and m in the range 1 ≤ d ≤ 15 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 100. For each combination

793

of d and m, we randomly split the set of all territories into a training set and a test set. The random

794

forest is trained on the training set data; subsequently, we measure the performance of this random

795

forest in predicting the time series of Rt+τ for the countries in the test set. As a performance metric,

796

we quantify the difference between the predicted time series of Rt+τ and the observed one by using

797

the coefficient of determination r2 . We repeat the same procedure 10 times with different random

798

splits of the set of territories into training and test set. Then we take the mean of the coefficient of

799

determination over the 10 splits to obtain the average out-of-sample performance of the random

800

forest for this combination of d and m. The heatmap in Fig. S6 shows the dependence of the

801

performance of the random forest on unseen data depending on the parameters d and m for fixed

802

time shift τ = 10.

803

Feature importance.

To quantify the importance of a NPI, we measure the loss of predictive

804

performance of the random forest if the information carried by the given NPI is replaced by noise.

805

This measure of feature importance is also known as permutation importance. If the loss in

806

performance is high for a given NPI, then we conclude that knowledge of the implementation status

807

of this NPI is important for predicting Rt+τ .

808

Specifically, for each time shift 0 ≤ τ ≤ 20 and each NPI M , we measure the reduction in

809

performance of the random forest in predicting Rt+τ for unseen data when the values in the column

810

corresponding to M are randomly shuffled. The maximum tree depth d and the percentage m of

811

features considered are set to their optimal values as determined in the cross-validation step. To

812

obtain sharp estimates for the permutation importance of the different NPIs we use repeated 10-fold

813

country-wise cross validation with 100 repetitions. Different NPIs attain their maximum value for

815

Transformers modelling. The temporal and dynamic nature of epidemic propagation finds a

816

suitable tool to model such a temporal evolution in Transformers 54 . This neural network can recall

817

past events presented at the input by leveraging its innate ability to take into account the previous

818

information. The intrinsic Transformer architecture ensures this ability for all the temporal data is

819

represented and considered at once without recurrent connections as in Recurrent Neural Networks.

820

At a generic time t, to approximate the value of the effective reproduction number at time t + 1,

821

Rt+1 , we use a Transformer whose input is the daily representation of the adopted measures in a

822

given country in binary form, similar to the encoding performed in Random Forest, along with the

823

value of Rt measured in the same day. The best performing network has been identified as having

824

four hidden layers of 128 neurons, an embedding size of 128, 8 heads, one output described by a

825

linear output layer, and 54 inputs (measures ⊕ Rt , where ⊕ is the concatenation operator). NPIs

826

are represented through a theta function over time, whose step position corresponds to the day when

827

the specific measure has been adopted in the selected country. For the neural network training,

828

10 out of 78 territories were chosen as the validation set, and the best neural network was found

829

when the mean square error between the values of the validation set and the corresponding network

830

outputs reached the minimum amount. Different Transformers training can lead to slightly different

831

predictions. Although the main trends of forecast maintain a substantial similarity across the

832

various training, the corresponding time evolution may change when some containment measures

833

are perturbed. This issue is possibly due to a large number of local minima affecting the neural

834

network’s energetic panorama. To address this problem and to provide an adequate assessment of

Transformer ranking assessment.

This approach has been chosen to be consistent with

838

the other methods implemented in this paper, in which the impact of the NPIs is related to the

839

comparison between countries having or not having implemented a measure. Therefore the com-

840

parison is performed between the normal prediction of the Transformer after the application of a

841

given NPI and the corresponding prediction when the same measure is removed. The difference

842

between the predictions quantifies the impact of that NPI on the overall behaviour of Rt of the

843

selected country. The final relative importance of the containment measure measi is then given

Implementing a Transformer as a general model for

describing the dependence on the measures of Rt allows, at the same time, to evaluate the impact

850

of the measures on a single country. Each country is identified by a specific temporal sequence of

851

applied measures and a unique Rt evolution over time. Then, we can interrogate the Transformer to

852

assess the importance of every single measure for that particular context by removing the measure

associated ranking of NPIs for each country. For example, Fig. S7 shows the impact on Rt of the

855

NPI "Small gathering cancellation" in Italy when such a measure is removed from the temporal

856

sequence of adopted NPIs. This approach allows us to assess the country-specific NPI ranking.

857

By comparing these ranking across all countries, we measure the specificity of the impact of its

858

measures.

859

What-If experiments with Transformers.

As mentioned above, Transformers offer the

860

possibility to perform what-if experiments, i.e., exploring different scenarios corresponding to

861

time-series of events different from the actual ones. This approach opens the possibility to ex-

862

amine scenarios corresponding to different combinations of NPIs. In the specific case of the

863

Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, starting from the actual

864

sequence of NPIs adopted by one particular country, we tested the efficacy of artificial sequences

865

by removing specific NPIs or shifting their adoption to other days. In this framework, one can

866

compare the actual evolution obtained through the synthetic sequence of actions to suitable reference

867

sequences. More specifically, we adopted the Transformers to assess what would have happened if

868

a given NPI had been adopted on a different day with respect to the actual day of adoption. To this

869

end, we adopted the following procedure:

870

871

872

• for each country and each NPI, we first compute a knockout evolution of the system by letting
the Transformer simulate the evolution of the system once the specific NPI has been removed.
• we create a synthetic sequence by keeping the sequence of NPIs of the country untouched

873

except for the specific NPI that is positioned in a generic day ti . For that sequence, we

874

compute the evolution of the system as given by the Transformer, i.e., we calculate the time

875

evolution of Rt for the specific synthetic sequence.

876

877

• We repeat the above operation for a generic choice of the day of adoption, ti , of the specific
NPI.

878

• For each country and each NPI, we compute the average difference between the synthetic

879

evolution of Rt with the specific NPI positioned at ti and the knockout evolution over the 30

880

days following ti . The average here is performed over several realisations of the Transformers.

881

882

• The outcome is a series of curves that, for each NPI, report the variation of Rt , ∆Rt , averaged
over all the countries that adopted that NPI and over several realisations of the Transformers.

883

Fig. S8 shows the effect of the selected NPI “Small gathering cancellation” in Italy if it had been

884

adopted on different days, compared to the case where the same NPI is absent (knockout evolution).

885

The reduction of Rt is visible, while the overall impact decreases as one shifts the day of adoption

886

ahead. The Transformer evolution, when the selected NPI is adopted on any other day, takes into

887

account the effect of all the other NPIs adopted in Italy and kept fixed throughout the simulation.

888

Fig. S9 reports the evolution of ∆Rt for a selection of NPIs that display a "the earlier, the better"

889

behaviour, that is, whose ability to reduce Rt tends to decrease with the epidemic age of their

890

adoption.

Results from the Case-control Analysis on country covariate effects. The impact of different

892

country variables, including demographic and governance indicators, as well as measures for human

893

and economic development, are shown in Fig. S10. This heatmap presents the average standardised

894

coefficient values from all regression models for a given NPI category (L2) that yield a significant

895

impact on R(t) for various delays (the average is taken over the delays). The standardised coefficient

896

values are the coefficient values (estimated change in Rt ) divided by its standard error (SE); the

897

t-Statistic. The significant NPIs show effect sizes in reducing Rt of about 5 standard errors. Note

898

that no statements concerning causal relationships can be made based on these findings; we report

899

correlations from a cross-sectional analysis.

900

A number of NPIs appear to be less effective in countries with a high population density and

901

low GDP 65 . Human development, as quantified by the Human Development Indicator, has no or

902

only very mild impacts on measure effectiveness. The governance indicators Political Stability and

903

Voice & Accountability are negatively correlated with the effectiveness of most measures. Most

904

of the remaining governance indicators show either no or moderately negative correlations. There

905

are, however, exceptions for some interventions that show consistently positive correlations with

906

government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law and control of corruption, in particular

907

measures to increase the availability of medical supplies and PPE. It is unlikely that these results

908

are confounded by poor reporting in less developed countries, as such biases would affect Rt values

909

from before and after measure implementation similarly and hence cancel each other out. Although

910

there is no clear pattern concerning the influence of the total number of NPIs already implemented,

911

there seems to be a trend regarding the number of NPIs of the same category. As a general tendency,

912

having already implemented measures from a given category makes additional NPIs from the same

913

category more effective, hinting at a relationship where one measure (e.g., closure of restaurants)

914

amplifies the effectiveness of other related measures (e.g., home office).

deviation of less than 5%. The NPIs impact evaluation is performed by averaging the difference

that the only African countries in the data set are Ghana, Senegal and Mauritius, and the single

for the different methods.

932

Two external datasets further corroborate our findings. These datasets also contain dedicated

933

entries for policies related to mask wearing, which appear to show moderate reductions in Rt when

934

compared to the other measures discussed above. We further confirmed the estimated impact of all

935

consensus measures using two external datasets presenting a broader geographical coverage (and

936

therefore counting more individual NPIs). This large analysis is, to date, unique, and proves the

937

robustness of our results. It also shows that, although the NPI trackers have been built independently,

938

sometimes for different purposes, and present different semantics and structure (which is a limitation

939

to harmonizing results), their analysis provides convergent results with four methods, and the use of

940

a smaller number of countries (56 in the CCCSL versus ∼ 200 in the CoronaNet and WHO-PHSM

941

datasets) does not qualitatively affect the outcome. This finding is of importance when analysis of

942

government policies needs to be conducted in emergency, to save computational time.

944

Social distancing. Bans of small gatherings (gatherings of 50 persons or less) and the closure of

945

educational institutions have a more substantial effect on Rt (but are also more intrusive to our

946

daily lives) than the prohibition of mass gatherings, measures targeting special populations (e.g.,

947

elderly, vulnerable populations, hospitalised patients, prisoners or more exposed non-healthcare

948

professionals) or adaptive measures for certain establishments (e.g., places of worship, admin-

949

istrative institutions, entertainment venues, nursing homes). While in earlier studies based on

950

smaller numbers of countries, school closures had been attributed only a little effect on the spread

951

of COVID-19 19, 20 , more recent evidence has been in favour of the effectiveness of this NPI 28, 29 .

952

This is also in line with a contact tracing study from South Korea which identified adolescents

953

aged 10–19 as the biggest spreaders in household settings 30 . Social distancing measures are less

954

effective in countries with a high population density and a high degree of citizen participation in the

955

government, as well as freedom of expression or free media (WGI Voice & Accountability). The

956

country-level analysis confirms that these NPIs have a particularly high entropy, meaning that their

957

effectiveness varies indeed substantially across countries. An exception to that are the measures for

958

public transport and work safety protocols, where the latter mostly refers to mandatory guidelines

959

for, e.g., physical barriers or fever checks at workplaces. These two social distancing measures have

960

a low effectiveness rank (little significance across the methods) and low entropy, meaning that they

961

had no impact on Rt consistently across most countries.

962

Healthcare and public health capacity. An increase in the availability of personal protective

963

equipment (PPE) to the healthcare workforce, together with measures aiming to reduce the num-

964

ber of non-COVID-19 or non-critical COVID-19 patients in medical centres and hospitals (by

965

promoting self-isolation of mildly symptomatic patients, setting up health hotlines, etc.) are also

966

essential building blocks of successful containment strategies. All of these measures combine high

967

effectiveness of early implementation and low entropy, meaning that they are similarly effective

968

in most countries. Actions aiming to enhance the health system are critical. They are the primary

969

response to patients and have no (or few) negative repercussions on individual rights of liberty

970

(exception on the travel restriction for healthcare workers imposed by several countries). Our results

971

demonstrate that government support to the health system needs to be a priority during a health

972

crisis in order to reduce mortality 66 . In line with our result "the earlier, the better", we argue that

973

those actions must be taken early enough to prepare for a surge in healthcare demand . Compared to

974

other interventions, increased medical supplies and availability of PPE show substantially stronger

975

positive correlations with several governance indicators including government effectiveness and

976

control of corruption. Indeed, there are increased news reports currently on scandals related to

977

government procurement of PPE 67–69 .

978

Travel restrictions. Different types of travel restrictions also show significant effects, in particular

979

border restrictions (e.g., border closure, border controls), individual movement restrictions (e.g.,

980

curfews, the prohibition of non-essential activities) and cordons sanitaires (containment zones).

981

The high effectiveness of border restrictions is driven by European countries (its impact on Rt

982

turns insignificant in two of our methods after removing all European countries); most likely for

983

geographic reasons. This finding is in line with a high entropy score of border, airport, port and ship

984

as well as individual movement restrictions.

985

Effectiveness of ultimate measures such as stay-at-home orders or lockdowns is still con-

986

troversial. Recent studies suggest that a national lockdown reduces Rt by an average of 5% 19 to

987

80% 20 , whereas other interventions seem to reduce the virus spread by 5% 20 to 30% 19 . In some

988

countries or territories, the effect of a lockdown decided in the late stage of the epidemic may not be

989

more effective than previously implemented bans on gatherings 19, 20, 70 . Our analysis highlights the

990

importance of early national lockdowns by showing how the relative effectiveness of that measure

87

991

correlates with the epidemic age of its adoption. However, the reduced effectiveness of lockdowns

992

at higher epidemic age, as observed in Fig. 4, does not necessarily imply that taking this NPI late is

993

useless.

994

Risk communication. In terms of risk communication, we find that pro-active communication with

995

stakeholders from the private sector (e.g., business owners or chief executive officers) to promote

996

voluntary safety protocols in enterprises, businesses, event organization, government administrations,

997

etc., shows a significant effect in each of the four analyses, mainly when implemented early. Three

998

out of four approaches also indicate a substantial impact of public health communication strategies

999

(i.e., non-binding NPIs) encouraging citizen engagement and empowering them with information.

1000

Resource allocation. Measures for resource allocation show limited impacts on Rt in our analysis

1001

(e.g., police and army interventions being insignificant in all studies) with relatively high entropy,

1002

meaning that country-level effects are important. Surprisingly, the implementation of crisis manage-

1003

ment plans turns out to be highly effective, except for the Americas. After removing countries from

1004

North and South America from the analyses, all four of our methods agree on significant effects of

1005

crisis management plans with an ∆Rt of down to −0.3, suggesting a lack of effective crisis plans

1006

in American territories. For instance, US states had to focus on providing health insurance and

1007

economic stimulus as well as facilitating administrative procedures, while European countries could

1008

develop their plans on top of a stronger socio-economic basis 71, 72 . Crisis management plans are

1009

also more effective in countries with a non-participatory government, meaning that countries with

1010

increasingly authoritarian practices might be at an advantage at implementing such policies, as can

1011

be seen in the swift response of Singapore 73 .

1012

Case identification, contact tracing and related measures. NPIs related to case identification

1013

and contact tracing show some of the lowest effectiveness ranks and in some cases even increase Rt ,

1014

consistently across most countries (NPIs with the five lowest entropy scores all belong to this theme).

1015

This result is to be expected, as, e.g., increased testing and faster contact tracing will on the short-run

1016

increase the numbers of found cases in return for reduced numbers in the long run. We do not assess

1017

such long-term effects (over timespans of more than a month) in the current work. Furthermore,

1018

note that our analysis considers mostly data from March and April 2020 where many countries

1019

experienced surges of case numbers that most likely hindered effective contact tracing and other

1020

case identification measures. This also applies to the relative ineffectiveness of quarantining people

1021

who either are infected or were exposed to infected persons, while the promotion of self-isolation of

1022

people with symptoms was one of the most effective NPIs. This result confirms a tendency in our

1023

results where voluntary measures are more effective than similar mandatory ones.
