Abstract:

Background: Globally, there is an obvious concern about the fact that the evolving 2019-nCoV
coronavirus is a worldwide public health threat. The appearance of severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China at the end of 2019 triggered a major global epidemic, which is
now a major community health issue. As of April 17, 2020, according to Institute of Epidemiology,
Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) Bangladesh has reported 1838 confirmed cases in between 8
March to 17 April 2020, with > 4.08% of mortality rate and >3.15% of recovery rate. COVID-19
outbreak is evolving so rapidly in Bangladesh; therefore, the availability of epidemiological data and its
sensible analysis are essential to direct strategies for situational awareness and intervention.
Method: This article presents an exploratory data analysis approach to collect and analyze COVID-19
data on epidemiological outbreaks based on first publicly available COVID-19 Daily Dataset of
Bangladesh. Various publicly open data sources on the outbreak of COVID-19 provided by the IEDCR,
World Health Organization (WHO), Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS), and Ministry of
Health and Family Welfare (MHFW) of Bangladesh have been used in this research.
Results: A Visual Exploratory Data Analysis (V-EDA) techniques have been followed in this research to
understand the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 outbreak in different districts of Bangladesh
in between 8 March 2020 to 12 April 2020 and these findings were compared with those of other
countries.
Conclusions: In all, this is extremely important to promptly spread information to understand the risks of
this pandemic and begin containment activities in the country.

1. Introduction
Bangladesh is a democratic nation surrounded by east, west and north India, Myanmar from southeast
with Bay of Bengal on the southern side. As of 1 July 2017, the population size in Bangladesh is
estimated at 162.7 million (male female ratio is 100.2:100). It has a unitary form of government, without
a province or a territory. There are 64 districts in the country and again each district is divided into several
sub districts (which is called upazilas). Right now, there are eight divisions (Barisal, Chittagong, Dhaka,
Khulna, Mymensingh, Rajshahi, Rangpur, and Sylhet) in the country and each division is named after the
major city within its jurisdiction, which also acts as the administrative headquarter of that division. The
Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) is responsible for the preparation and management of
curative, preventive and pro-active health services for the population of the country and therefore
considered as one of the largest ministries of the Government of Bangladesh.
Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) is considered as the focal institute for
conducting public health surveillance and outbreak response. During the last few years, however, the
efficiency of the International Health Regulation (IHR) has dramatically increased and exceeded 68% in
the country.1 Moreover, it also has the national ability to test COVID-19 patients by using polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) machine confirmed laboratory. The first cases of pneumonia of unknown origin
identified in Wuhan City, the capital of Hubei Province, China in early December 2019 was later
determined as a non-SARS novel coronavirus by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC).2 Coronaviruses are non-segmented positive-sense RNA viruses that belong to the Coronaviridae
family and the Nidovirales order and are widely distributed in humans and other mammals.3 The
pathogen has been described as a novel enveloped RNA betacoronavirus4 commonly referred to as severe

acute respiratory coronavirus 2 syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), having a phylogenetic resemblance to SARSCoV.5 With a mortality rate of 10% for SARS-CoV and 37% for MERS-CoV,6,7 the epidemics of the two
beta coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) ,8,9 and Middle East
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV),10,11 have caused more than ten thousand cumulative
cases in the last two decades. With no surprise, on 30 January 2020, World Health Organization (WHO)
declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International concern (PHEIC).12 As
of April 15, 2020, a total of 1914916 laboratory-confirmed cases have been documented globally and
among them, Bangladesh has confirmed 1132 cases with a death rate of 4.4%

.This report will

investigate Bangladesh's epidemiological data based on the country's first COVID-19 daily dataset
between March 8, 2020 and April 12, 2020.
Until 12 April 2020, Bangladesh has confirmed 621 laboratory tested positive patients affected by
SARS-CoV-2 virus with 621 confirmed , 39 recovered, and 34 death , 548 infected , 9,653 tested cases.
On February 5, 2020, IEDCR performed coronavirus tests on 39 Bangladeshis for the very first time;
those came back Bangladesh from China on that time. Until then, none of them found infected with the
virus. In these circumstances, turning public fears into reality, on 8 March 2020, Bangladesh has
confirmed its first case of COVID-19 patients (N=3) caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus. Among these, two of
the three infected were all aged between 20 and 35 and returned recently to Bangladesh from different
cities in Italy. However, this is significant that, only after 7 days of first confirmed COVID-19 reported
case, on 16 March 2020, IEDCR reported that the virus had begun to spread locally, and indicated that
children in the country had been infected with coronavirus for the very first time. As the outbreak of
COVID-19 is expanding rapidly globally, already appeared as a global pandemic, therefore we aim to
describe the number of different cases caused by SARS-CoV-2 and represents the epidemiological data
through visual exploratory data analysis (EDA)14 approach. Considering COVID-19's rapid spread, we
have designed a comprehensive daily dataset15 and decided that an updated case review with outbreak
analysis in Bangladesh may help identify the epidemiological characteristics and severity of the disease
across the country. Apart from preparing an inclusive dataset, this research will also analyze the different

trend of documented cases of COVID-19 in the countries of the South-East Asia Region (SEAR), and
South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). Moreover, this work would pose a concern
for the citizens of Bangladesh, whether the situation of COVID-19 in the country is on the verge of a
rapid outbreak in near future or if it can flatten the curve. As of April 16, 2020, according to the situation
report provided by the IEDCR16, ten new death cases taking the total number of death cases to 60 in the
country and conformed case raised to 1572.

2. Methods and Material
In this research, we have used numerous range of data sources for preparing our datasets. This dataset is
named

as

this

URL:

https://www.kaggle.com/samratkumardey/bangladesh-covid19-daily-dataset. As per our knowledge
“Bangladesh COVID-19 Daily Dataset” is the first designed and developed dataset that enlist the different
cases (confirmed, death, recovered, number of test etc.) of COVID-19 outbreak in Bangladesh. We use
official government sources include (a) daily press briefing provided by IEDCR, (b) press releases from
official website of Corona BD (https://corona.gov.bd/), (c) press releases on the official websites of
Ministries of Health (http://www.mohfw.gov.bd/), and Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS)
(https://dghs.gov.bd/index.php/en/). In order to prepare a comprehensive and precise dataset, we collected
data on the following: (i) Daily dates, which include the date of daily new confirmed case, total confirmed
case, daily new deaths, total deaths, daily new recovered, total recovered, daily new tests, total tests, and
active cases. (ii) Geographic information, division and district wise confirmed cases. (iii) Demographic
statistics about the patient’s age and sex. (iv) Date wise statistics of quarantine and isolated patients.
Table 1 provides insight on Bangladesh COVID-19 Daily Dataset and their respective data files with their
column description. As this is a time series data, therefore the number of instances on a given day is the
cumulative number. This dataset contains different COVID-19 cases data from 8 March 2020 to 12 April
2020. It is to be notated that Bangladesh has familiarized with its very first laboratory tested confirmed
COVID-19 patients on 8 March 2020 and it reported its first death case on 18 march, 2020. Our research

3. Results
This exploratory data analysis (EDA) mainly focused on the COVID-19 outbreak of a South East Asian
country, Bangladesh. Apart from designing and developing a dataset, this research also analyzed the
different characteristics of COVID-19 epidemic in between 8 March 2020 to 12 April 2020. All the data
analysis and comparative results are based on the data that we collected and curated individual-level data
from national level, division level, district level, and official health reports provided by government
officials, as well as additional information from WHO situation report. As of 12 April 2020, according to
the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR), there are 621 confirmed COVID19 cases by rt-PCR in Bangladesh, including 39 patients who have recovered and 34 related deaths; Case
Fatality Rate (CFR) is 05.48%. Figure 1 shows the daily distribution of confirmed, deaths, recovered and
active COVID-19 cases from 08 March 2020 to 12 April 2020 in Bangladesh. Between 1 March 2020 and
12 April 2020, among the 621 COVID-19 reported cases, 69.9% (434) were males whereas 30.1% (187)
were females. As of 12 April 2020, among the 621 COVID-19 reported cases, 88.2% (548/621) are
currently under treatment, 6.3% (39) were cured and 5.5% (34) died. Distribution of confirmed COVID19 cases by age, gender and division is shown on Table 2. Sixty percent (60%) (380/621) of all COVID19 confirmed cases were between 21 and 50 years old, followed by 28% (63) of the age group 51 years
and above, while the age group of less than 20 years represented only 10% (178) of all reported cases.

It is evident that there has been an increasing trend in the number of reported confirmed cases since 3
April 2020, due to expansion of COVID-19 testing in the country and establishing testing capacity in 16
laboratories (Figure 2). By 12 April, a total of 9653 samples were tested of them 26.08% (2518) were
tested by laboratories outside Dhaka city and 73.91% (7135) were tested by laboratories inside Dhaka.
The overall COVID-19 test rate in Bangladesh is 8.3/100,000 population (until 12 April 2020). The

4. Discussion
We report here all the different cases of COVID-19 outbreak in Bangladesh based on daily dataset and
compare its results with the countries of South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC),
South East Asian Region (SEAR) and globally top ten countries in terms of their daily death rate in
between 8 March 2020 to 12 April 2020. Moreover, design and development of country’s first
“Bangladesh COVID-19 Daily Dataset” is also focused in this research. Like other South Asian
Countries, Bangladesh also outlined measures and plans to face this severe pandemic of COVID-19 with
utmost importance. As of 15 April 2020, according to the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and
Research (IEDCR), there are 1231 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Bangladesh, including 49 patients who
have recovered and 50 related deaths; Case Fatality Rate (CFR) is 04.06%. When an outbreak such as
this occurs, readily available data and knowledge are equally essential to continue the evaluation required
to identify the threats and begin outbreak containment activities. From the observation, it is evident that
for Bangladesh the number of total confirmed death is increased by a factor of 2.2 in the 5 days (21 deaths
on 10 April and 46 deaths on 15 April). In addition, the number of total confirmed case is increased by a
factor of 2.1 in the 3 days (482 confirmed case on 12 April and 1012 confirmed case on 15 April). It is
also notable that, the number of confirmed cases in the country increased rapidly as the conduction of
number of test increased in passage of time. Until 15 April 2020 a total of 14,868-specimen have been
tested which was 13.25% higher in comparing with the total test (13,128) performed on 14 April 2020. As
of 15 April 2020 69.0% (44/64) district of the country has already been infected with minimum one
confirmed COVID-19 case. Until now, Bangladesh has only reported 5.92% (1231/20,804) of confirmed
cases in South East Asian Region with a case fatality rate of 5.26 % (50/950). Importantly, regarding the
trend of daily confirmed cases in terms of number of days since 100th confirmed cases, Bangladesh (803
on the 7 days of 100 confirmed case) shows the similar trend till now with France (716), USA (754),
Pakistan (887) and Thailand (721). However, no countries have the same trend as Bangladesh in terms of
days since the fifth confirmed deaths until now. The pandemic has shown us how quickly a new epidemic
will catch up and spread. Comprehension is expected with an eruption in clinical and epidemiological

information and research. Therefore, the goal of this research is to open up whatever resources we have to
help the public health authorities, researchers and clinicians in Bangladesh in mitigating and handling this
crisis. The study presented here, using our designed dataset “Bangladesh COVID-19 Daily Dataset”
focused on both exploratory and visual exploratory data analysis. All the analysis with the dataset was

(https://www.openstreetmap.org/) and Map Box (https://www.mapbox.com/) for interactive map
visualization in the research laboratory of Dhaka International University (DIU), Bangladesh. Lastly, our
research team believes, it is crucial to produce accurate, real-time, and reliable data for emerging disease
outbreaks, which will help generate credible information that can reinforce which inform policy taking in
public health sector.

5. Conclusion
This report analyzed the data focusing on specific criteria including public awareness, case management,
infection control, surveillance, quarantine facility and trend analysis with other countries. Consequently,
this is, to the best of our knowledge, the first initiative of analyzing and visualizing real-world time series
COVID-19 data of Bangladesh in such a way that health professionals and researchers around the globe
can grasp its severity clearly. The COVID-19 pandemic has ravaged the lives of people around the world
and has become a clinical threat to the general population and healthcare workers around the world.
However, awareness on this novel virus (SARS-CoV-2) is still minimal in Bangladesh. This study
analyzed the forty (40) days situation since the first COVID-19 confirmed patients reported in the
country. Additionally, this exploration also implemented and used the country’s first publicly available
daily COVID-19 case dataset. It also illustrated in this study is the day wise case review and assessment
of epidemiological evidence with SAARC, SEAR and the top 10 countries worldwide (in terms of
deaths). Our research team believes this is an early data analysis and visualization approach of a situation
that is changing rapidly across the country. Therefore, as the more we learn about this SARS-CoV-2 virus
