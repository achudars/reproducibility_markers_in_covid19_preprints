CO2 is co-exhaled with aerosols containing SARS-CoV-2 by COVID-19 infected people and can
be used as a proxy of SARS-CoV-2 concentrations indoors. Indoor CO2 measurements by lowcost sensors hold promise for mass monitoring of indoor aerosol transmission risk for COVID-19
and other respiratory diseases. We derive analytical expressions of CO 2-based risk proxies and
apply them to various typical indoor environments. The relative infection risk in a given
environment scales with excess CO2 level, and thus keeping CO2 as low as feasible in a space
allows optimizing the protection provided by ventilation. We show that the CO2 level
corresponding to a given absolute infection risk varies by over 2 orders of magnitude for different
environments and activities. Although large uncertainties, mainly from virus exhalation rates, are
still associated with infection risk estimates, our study provides more specific and practical
recommendations for low-cost CO2-based indoor infection risk monitoring.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently sweeping the world and causing major losses
of human lives.1 Lockdowns imposed to various extent worldwide for the COVID-19 transmission
reduction are not supposed to be long-term measures, otherwise they would lead to unaffordable
social and economic costs. On the other hand, resumption of social, educational, and business
activities raises concerns about transmission resurgence.

In last few months, there has been rapidly mounting evidence for COVID-19 transmission via
aerosols,2–5 i.e., severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-containing
particles with diameters <100 µm that can float in the air for minutes to hours. Such aerosols
have been detected in exhaled air of COVID-19 patients6 and in hospital air7,8 and the behaviors
of smaller ones among them out of proximity of sources have been shown to be similar to gas. 9,10
Transmission is much easier indoors than outdoors, which is most consistent with aerosols. 4,11,12
As humans spend most time in indoor environments, where air volumes are limited and virusladen aerosols may easily accumulate, mitigation of indoor COVID-19 transmissions is a subject
of high interest13,14 and is key to a successful societal and economic reopening. Practical,
affordable, and widely applicable measures to monitor and limit indoor transmission risks are
urgently needed.

Direct measurements of virus-containing aerosols are extremely difficult and slow. Indoor CO2
has been suggested as an indicator of ventilation of indoor spaces in 19th century,15 and more
recently as a practical proxy of respiratory infectious disease transmission risk, 16 as pathogencontaining aerosols and CO2 are co-exhaled by those infected (Fig. 1). Since background
(ambient) CO2 level is almost stable and indoor excess CO2 is usually only from human
exhalation, measurements of indoor CO2 concentration by low-cost CO2 sensors can often be
good indicators of infection risk and suitable for mass deployment.17,18 However, the CO2 level
corresponding to a given COVID-19 infection risk is largely unknown. A few guideline limit
concentrations have been proposed, but without solid and quantitative basis. 19,20 In particular,
only a single CO2 threshold was recommended in each of these proposed guidelines. Whether a
single CO2 concentration ensures low COVID-19 infection risk in all common indoor environments
remains an open question, but is also critical for effective CO 2-based mass risk monitoring.

In this study, we derive the analytical expressions of the probability of indoor COVID-19 infection
through room-level aerosol transmission only (i.e., assuming social distance is kept so that close
proximity aerosol and droplet pathways are eliminated; fomite transmission is not included),
human-exhaled CO2 concentration, and subsequently a few CO2-based quantities as infection
risk proxies. Based on available data, we apply these expressions to common indoor settings to
answer the abovementioned open question.

Derivation of CO2-based infection risk proxies
To derive the SARS-CoV-2 aerosol concentration in indoor air, we assume well-mixed air (Fig. 1).
The degree of inhomogeneity can be easily quantified with portable low-cost sensors. If
significant inhomogeneity in indoor air is present, the indoor space can often be approximated as
several compartments, each of them having relatively well-mixed air. Ventilation with outdoor air,
virus decay and deposition onto surfaces, and additional control measures (e.g., air filtration and
use of germicidal UV) result in losses of infective virus from indoor air. Other sinks (e.g.,
inhalation by humans and animals indoors) are assumed to be insignificant. This model will
underestimate the risk in environments with significant non-respiratory sources of infective
aerosols (e.g., bathrooms due to toilet flushing, resuspension in healthcare facilities due to
personal-protective-equipment donning/doffing). The amount of the virus infectious doses (n –
“quanta”) inhaled by a susceptible person determines their probability of infection (P) (see Table
S1 for the list of symbols in this study). According to the Wells-Riley model of aerosol infection,21
𝑃 = 1 − 𝑒 −𝑛

One SARS-CoV-2 quantum corresponds to a probability of infection of 1-1/e (63%). The expected
value of n (〈𝑛〉) for an originally uninfected person corresponding to a given level of immunity in
local population (probability of an occupant being immune, ηim), can be calculated as follows

respectively. (1 − 𝜂𝑖𝑚 ) is included since quanta inhaled by an immune uninfected individual will

If there are no other significant CO2 sources/sinks (e.g., gas/coal stove and pets/plants), i.e., if
indoor excess CO2 (relative to the background outdoor level) production is only due to human

this quantity, involving inhaled CO2 volume that is difficult to measure, is not practical for
widespread transmission risk monitoring, which usually requires a fast decision-making process
simply based on indoor CO2 concentration reading (usually in ppm) of a low-cost sensor.

excess CO2 level (∆𝑐𝐶𝑂

This quantity is closely related to the excess CO 2 level corresponding to the unity basic

reference does not imply safety at this P in all situations, since when N and/or D are large, and/or

Reference excess CO2 level is a function of a number of variables. A priori, varying any of them
∗
can result in a different value of Δ𝑐𝐶𝑂
even for similar settings. As an example, we study a set of

model cases for a typical university class. The cases are specified in Table S2. The Δ𝑐𝐶𝑂

In the base class case, the infector is assumed to be the instructor. Compared to the case with a
∗
student being infector, Δ𝑐𝐶𝑂
in the base case is ~1.5 orders of magnitude lower, just because the
2
vocalization of the instructor, who usually speaks, greatly enhances Ep,22,23 while virus exhalation
by students, who are assumed here to speak little, is much less efficient. In the case of a physical
education (PE) class in the same indoor environment, where occupants are assumed to be doing
∗
heavy exercise and no talking, Δ𝑐𝐶𝑂
is much lower than for the infected student case in a
2
traditional lecture (Fig. 2A). Compared to sitting, heavy exercise increases both occupants’ virus
and CO2 exhalation rates to similar extents,22–24 which does not significantly change reference
excess CO2 level. However, breathing rates of occupants doing intense activities are much higher
than those sitting.25 Even if CO2 and SARS-CoV-2 concentrations are the same as in the infected
student case, a susceptible person in the PE class case can still inhale a larger dose of SARSCoV-2 and more excess CO2, and have a remarkably different P. As a result, a single
recommendation of indoor CO2 threshold is not valid even for a series of school settings. The
range of CO2 levels measured in real-world classrooms is very large.26 Reference excess CO2
level of the infectious student case (relatively safe) is exceeded in some classrooms, while that of
the infectious instructor case (relatively risky) is met in other classrooms.

According to Eqs. 2 and 3, whether occupants wear masks and what masks they wear can make
a substantial difference in infection risk through virus filtration in the same indoor setting.
However, masks do not filter CO2. The base class case (with surgical masks), that with all
occupants wearing N95 respirators, and that with no mask use have identical CO 2 mixing ratios,
but up to ~2 orders of magnitude different probability of infection (Table S2) due to filtration of
virus-containing particles by mask. Therefore, for the same probability of infection of 0.01%, the
base class case is estimated by Eq. 7 to have a corresponding excess CO 2 level x~30 lower than
the case with all occupants wearing N95 respirators, but x~2 higher than the case with no mask
use (Fig. 2A).

ηI is obviously another important factor governing the infection risk, as P proportional to it. Again,
it has no impact on CO2. Compared to the base class case (ηI = 0.001), the estimated situations
of similar classes in New York City (NYC) in April (ηI = 0.023) and in Boulder, CO in June (ηI =
∗
0.0003) have x~20 higher and x~2 lower P, respectively (Table S2), and hence Δ𝑐𝐶𝑂
2

proportionally lower and higher, respectively (Fig. 2A). Note that Δ𝑐𝐶𝑂2 is smaller than the current
typical accuracy of low-cost CO2 sensors (±50 ppm)27 and cannot be meaningfully measured by
those sensors in very risky situations such as the NYC case here. Closure of environments with
∗
such low permissible Δ𝑐𝐶𝑂
is likely needed. However, ηim usually cannot result in a difference in

According to Eq. 7, the other variables that can affect Δ𝑐𝐶𝑂
are N, D, λ, and λ0. Δ𝑐𝐶𝑂

As discussed above, occupants’ activities indoors, to which Ep, 𝐸𝑝,𝐶𝑂2 , and B are all related, are a
major or dominant factor governing the infection risk. We thus compile the data of these
parameters as a function of activity (intensity and vocalization degree) (Table S3). Note that this
compilation has large uncertainties from Ep data22,23 and matching of activity categories, which
are all classified differently for Ep, 𝐸𝑝,𝐶𝑂2 , and B (see Section S3 for details). These uncertainties
are currently difficult to quantify, but likely large enough to be the dominant uncertainty sources
for the model output. Other sources of uncertainty are thus not discussed. Further systematic
uncertainty analyses would be of interest. However, the trends shown are clear and thus able to
reveal the relative risk of these activities with confidence. Simply, the stronger vocalization, the
∗
higher risk, and the more intense activity, the higher risk. We calculate Δ𝑐𝐶𝑂
for these activities

when N is large, D = 1 h, ηI = 0.001, λ0 = 3 h , λ = 4 h , no mask is used (Fig. 2B), a setting
similar to the class case. Three class cases, i.e., base, infected student, and PE cases, can be
easily related to the activity categories of “Standing – loudly speaking”, “Resting – breathing”, and
∗
“Heavy exercise – breathing”, respectively. The related pairs have Δ𝑐𝐶𝑂
within x~2 and their

mask use setting and close but different Ep, 𝐸𝑝,𝐶𝑂2 , and B values can largely explain the

differences in Δ𝑐𝐶𝑂
.

Then we apply this analysis to a range of real-world settings, in addition to the class case, i.e., the
Skagit County choir superspreading event,5 a subway car, a supermarket (focused on a worker),
and an event in a stadium, which, though outdoors, often has somewhat stagnant air allowing
virus-laden aerosols to build up and thus can be treated similarly as an indoor environment (see
𝑛∆𝐶𝑂2
∗
Table S4 for the specifications of these cases). Figures 2C and S1B shows their Δ𝑐𝐶𝑂
and
,
2
𝑛
respectively. Again, these values span orders of magnitude. We can still relate these cases to the
activity categories of “Standing – loudly speaking”, “Resting – breathing”, “Light exercise –
breathing” (or “Light exercise – speaking”), and “Light exercise – speaking” (or “Light exercise –
loudly speaking”), respectively.

For the actual choir case, its ηI is an order of magnitude lower than 0.1% while the estimated Ep is
an order of magnitude higher (20), resulting in a similar reference excess CO2 level to that of
∗
“Standing – loudly speaking” shown in Fig. 2B. Δ𝑐𝐶𝑂
in the stadium case is between those of
2
“Light exercise – speaking” and “Light exercise – loudly speaking”, as both activities may happen
∗
in the event. The difference of Δ𝑐𝐶𝑂
between the supermarket case and its related activities
2
∗
shown in Fig. 2B is mainly due to the long duration of the event (8 h). Δ𝑐𝐶𝑂
of the supermarket
2
case divided by the duration leads to the excess CO2 threshold for the worker to inhale over 8 h
∗
between those of “Light exercise – breathing” and “Light exercise – speaking”. Δ𝑐𝐶𝑂
of the
2

fraction term involving D, λ, and λ0 (after the product sign) in Eq. 7 usually does not deviate from
1 substantially (Fig. S2). It is close to 1 when λD is very small, and λ/λ0 when λD is very large. As
long as the indoor environment is not very poorly ventilated nor equipped with very strong virus
removal setups (e.g., substantial filtering of recirculated air, portable HEPA filters, germicidal UV),
λ/λ0 is relatively close to 1. Compared to the base classroom case (λ/λ0 ~ 1.3), doubling the
∗
duration or ventilation brings minimal changes to Δ𝑐𝐶𝑂
. Increasing λ/λ0 to ~3 by additional virus
2
∗
control measures increases Δ𝑐𝐶𝑂2 more significantly, as those measures do not remove CO2. But
this change is still within a factor of 2 for the range of control measures in these examples (Fig.
2A).

As shown above, the infection risk analysis for various settings can be based on the relevant
activities with adjustments for ηI, D, mask use etc. For policy-making concerning acceptable indoor
CO2 level, we also recommend an activity-dependent approach. Reference excess CO2 levels for
indoor environments with certain types of activities mainly involved can be found in Fig. 2B. Then
this mixing ratio can be scaled for typical D (by multiplying it) and target P (by multiplying its ratio
to 0.01%) to obtain an excess CO2 threshold, which may be relaxed a little further depending on
the local mask policy. The sum of this value and the local outdoor CO 2 concentration, the latter of
which we recommend measuring regularly due to possible variations, 29 is the final recommended
indoor CO2 concentration threshold. For more complex setups (e.g., with many CO 2 meters in a
company or school), a meter should be located outdoors to measure CO 2 concentration
continuously. To our knowledge, CO2 is the only quantity that can be easily measured by fast lowcost sensors as an infection risk proxy. The relative risk of infection in a given situation has been
shown to scale with the excess CO2 concentration. The absolute risk can be estimated when the
parameters needed are known. Calculations for various scenarios can be easily performed with the
online COVID-19 aerosol transmission estimator.30 Then this method can provide a stronger
scientific basis for using CO2, than having one threshold for all situations. However, it may still not
be trivial for the general public to estimate the parameters used in our model and implement it.
Regulatory authorities may derive the CO2 thresholds for different types of indoor spaces, or
provide more assistance for businesses to do so. Even if the parameters are unknown, our study
suggests that simply keeping the CO2 level and the physical intensity and vocalization level of the
activities as low as practically feasible in indoor environments will still reduce the risk.
