Abstract
Background: While social assistance through the United States (U.S.) federal
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act provided expanded
unemployment insurance benefits during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
pandemic until the summer of 2020, it is unclear whether subsequent social assistance
has been or will be sufficient to meet everyday spending needs and to curb the adverse
health-related sequelae of financial hardship.
Methods: This study estimated recent trends in financial hardship among working-aged
Americans with job-related income loss during the pandemic. It also used multivariable
logistic regression and repeated cross-sectional individual-level U.S. Household Pulse
Survey data on 91,222 working-aged adults between September and December 2020 to
explore the associations of financial hardship with mental health outcomes and food and
housing insecurity after accounting for receipt of social assistance.
Results: Experiencing somewhat of a financial hardship (vs no hardship) was linked to
3-7 times higher odds of anxiety and depressive symptoms and a likely eviction, and 11
times higher odds of food insufficiency. Experiencing considerable financial hardship (vs
no hardship) predicted 5-7 fold higher odds of anxiety and depressive symptoms, 34fold higher odds of a likely housing eviction, and 37-fold higher odds of food
insufficiency (all P values <.001). Across outcomes, these relationships were stronger at
each successively higher level of financial hardship (all P values for linear trend <.001),
and more than offset any corresponding benefits from social assistance.
Conclusions: Even after accounting for receipt of social assistance, working-aged
adults experiencing financial hardship had markedly greater odds of anxiety and

depressive symptoms, food insufficiency, and an anticipated housing eviction. These
findings point to the urgent need for direct and sustained cash relief well in excess of
current levels of social assistance, and provide a critical baseline assessment for
evaluating the impacts of federal public policy responses to economic hardships during
the pandemic. It is essential that the U.S. Congress and the new Biden administration
provide adequate and needs-based social policy relief measures in order to mitigate the
pandemic’s adverse impacts on the physical, mental, and social well-being of millions of
Americans.

Introduction
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to the filing of over 70
million unemployment insurance (UI) claims in the United States (U.S.),1 and has been
accompanied by heightened levels of food and housing insecurity.2 Through the federal
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act enacted in March
2020, expanded UI benefits consisted of a $600 weekly payment on top of state
payments, 13 extra weeks of UI benefits, and broader UI eligibility guidelines.3 The
federal bonus expired in late July 2020, and was followed by a six-week $300 weekly
benefit in the majority of states through a federal lost wages assistance program.4 Other
provisions along with a public health housing eviction moratorium implemented in
September 2020 expired in late December 2020. A few days later, both the U.S.
Congress and President Trump approved a $900 billion COVID-19 relief package that
included a one-time direct payment of $600 to individuals (with a 2019 adjusted gross
income of up to $75,000) and a federal UI bonus of $300 weekly for 11 weeks.5 In midJanuary 2021, President-elect Biden unveiled an $1.9 trillion economic relief plan for his
administration that proposed a one-time direct payment of $1,400 (on top of the $600
check) and a UI supplement of $400 weekly through the end of September 2021;6 this
proposal has yet to be approved by Congress.
An analysis of data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Household Pulse Survey (HPS)
administered in June and July 2020 identified UI receipt as associated with better
mental health and lower health-related social needs among working-aged adults.7

However, since the federal UI bonus subsequently lapsed and was followed by a
subsidy considerably smaller in both amount and duration, it is unclear whether social
assistance has been or will be sufficient to meet everyday spending needs and to curb
adverse sequelae of financial hardship among those experiencing employment-related
income loss. This study was undertaken to estimate recent levels of and changes in
financial hardship among working-aged Americans with job-related income loss during
the most recent months of the pandemic, and to explore the associations of financial
hardship with mental health outcomes and food and housing insecurity after accounting
for receipt of social assistance.

Methods
Study population
Repeated cross-sectional individual-level data were pooled from nationallyrepresentative HPS surveys administered from September 2—December 21, 2020.8
The study population was adults age 18-64 years reporting a loss of household
employment income since the beginning of the pandemic (March 13, 2020). The most
recently available aggregate data were also drawn from the HPS public-use survey data
tables (December 9—December 21). The HPS used the U.S. Census Bureau’s Master
Address File as the source of sampled housing units (HUs). The sampling frame was a
systematic sample of all eligible HUs. The HPS was conducted online by Qualtrics as
the data collection platform. Across data collection periods, survey response rates
ranged from 5.3% to 10.6%.9

Predictors
Financial hardship was defined as household difficulty (not at all/a little/somewhat/very
difficult) to pay for usual household expenses including food, rent/mortgage, and loans
within the previous week. UI receipt was taken as household receipt of UI benefits since
the pandemic began. Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP) receipt was
defined as household participation in SNAP and using SNAP benefits to meet spending
needs within the previous week.9

Outcomes
Outcomes consisted of the frequency of anxiety and depressive symptoms (using the 2item Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 and Patient Health Questionnaire-2, respectively,
for scores of 3-6 vs 0-2 to screen for anxiety and depressive disorders, with acceptable
sensitivity and specificity levels10), the level of food insufficiency (often or sometimes
not enough to eat vs enough to eat), and, among housing renters, the likelihood of
being evicted within the next 2 months (very/extremely likely vs somewhat/not at all
likely).9

Statistical analysis
Multivariable logistic regression models were fit to estimate adjusted odds ratios from
generalized estimating equations that accounted for repeated measures within
individuals and person-level survey weights and provided robust standard errors. LogPoisson regression was not employed due to potential bias when estimating relative
risks for binary outcomes.11 All models were adjusted for individual age, age squared,

gender, race/ethnicity, marital status, education, 2019 household income, other federal
stimulus assistance, household size, presence of children in the household, general
health status, state, and survey period. The model for current food insufficiency was
also controlled for pre-pandemic food insufficiency. Multiple imputation analysis (using
25 multiply imputed datasets) and complete case analysis were used to handle missing
data for predictor and outcome variables, respectively. All analyses were conducted
using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).

Results
Figure 1 shows the estimated numbers and percentages of U.S. working-aged adults
with employment income loss, receipt/denial of UI benefits, mental health-related
symptoms, food insufficiency, and financial hardship in the latest wave of the HPS
(December 9—December 21). Over half (55.5%) of working-aged adults (representing
more than 108 million adults) experienced job-related income loss in their households
since the start of the pandemic. Of those who lost employment income, less than half
(46.6%) applied for UI benefits, and of those who applied, 76.6% received UI. More than
one-third (37.8%) and one-quarter (28.5%) reported a higher frequency of feeling
anxious or depressed, respectively. 16.0% (corresponding to 27 million adults)
experienced food insufficiency. Over half (51.7%) of renters (representative of 4.8
million adults) indicated a high likelihood of being evicted. 42.0% (corresponding to 79
million adults) reported a higher level of financial hardship. All proportions were at least
5 percentage points higher among those with employment income loss (Figure 1).

Figure 2 depicts the estimated national percentages of working-aged adults
experiencing household financial hardship (somewhat to very difficult to pay for usual
household expenses) by survey period between September 2, 2020 and December 21,
2020. In September 2020, this percentage declined slightly from 36.3% to 35.5%, but
then rose progressively during each successive survey period to 42.0% by December
2020. The largest absolute percentage change (+1.4 percentage points) occurred
between the two most recent survey periods, suggesting the possibility of an escalating
trend (Figure 2).

Table 1 displays the main results from the multivariable-adjusted models. In models
using data on up to 91,222 working-aged adults (representative of 43 million individuals)
with income disruption, experiencing somewhat of a financial hardship (vs no hardship)
was linked to 3-7 times higher odds of anxiety and depressive symptoms and a likely
eviction, and 11 times higher odds of food insufficiency. Experiencing considerable
financial hardship (vs no hardship) predicted 5-7 fold higher odds of anxiety and
depressive symptoms, 34-fold higher odds of a likely eviction, and 37-fold higher odds
of food insufficiency (Table 1; all P <.001; all P for linear trend <.001). In the same
models, UI receipt (vs no receipt) was associated with 9-12% lower odds of depressive
symptoms (P = 0.03), anxiety symptoms (P = 0.005), and food insufficiency (P = 0.10),
and 35% lower odds of an expected eviction (P <.001). SNAP receipt was linked to 10%
lower odds of food insufficiency (P = 0.19).

Discussion
This large U.S. nationally-representative study reveals high levels of financial hardship
among working-aged Americans, that progressively worsened from September to
December 2020. Even after accounting for social assistance receipt and pre-pandemic
socioeconomic position, working-aged adults experiencing financial hardship had
markedly greater odds of anxiety or depressive symptoms, food insufficiency, and an
anticipated housing eviction. Across outcomes, these relationships were stronger at
each successively higher level of financial hardship, and more than offset any
corresponding benefits from UI or SNAP. To the author’s knowledge, this represents the
first study to explore the potential impacts of financial hardship with mental health and
food and housing insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. The
associations with mental health outcomes are in keeping with previous linkages of
sudden income loss to depression and anxiety in labor market surveys conducted in six
European countries in March and April 2020.12

Strengths of the study include its use of large nationally-representative survey data, as
well as data from repeated survey waves that enabled the examination of trends in
financial hardship over time. Models also controlled for baseline demographic and
socioeconomic factors and state fixed effects to reduce confounding. Finally, the
modeling of multiple categories for the financial hardship measure permitted a
confirmation of the presence of dose-response relationships.

Nonetheless, there are limitations to this study. Because of the study’s cross-sectional
and observational design, bias due to reverse causation or confounding cannot be
entirely ruled out. Moreover, we were unable to account for the received monetary
amounts of UI and SNAP benefits. While sampling weights accounted for non-response,
the low survey response rates could have led to selection bias. Last, all measures were
based on self-report, although the adjustment for general health status in all models
should have attenuated the degree of same-source bias.

There is evidence to support that during the period that the CARES Act was in effect
during the initial phase of the pandemic, among adults whose families lost work or workrelated income due to the pandemic, the level of social assistance including the $600
weekly federal bonus for UI recipients was adequate to meet financial needs.13 UI
receipt was linked to a 3-percentage point reduction in the share reporting food
insecurity, a 3.7 percentage-point reduction in problems paying utility bills, and
reductions of 8.6 to 15.1 percentage points in the share worrying about meeting basic
needs.13

Overall, the findings from the present study suggest the importance of financial hardship
as a fundamental cause14 and social determinant of mental health and social needs
during the COVID-19 pandemic, and point to the urgent need for direct and sustained
cash relief well in excess of current levels of social assistance, as well as the imperative
of extending housing renter eviction protections. The current study further offers a
critical baseline assessment for evaluating impacts of the U.S. federal government's
public policy responses in subsequent months and years of the pandemic. Notably, this

study also helps to heed recent calls for a more “consequential” epidemiology, whereby
epidemiologic research serves to more directly inform contemporary social policies to
improve population health, including in response to emerging public health threats and
crises including pandemics.15

Based on the above prior evidence that economic hardship and food insecurity declined
among UI recipients after enacting the CARES Act, and the present study’s evidence
that a substantial and growing share of working-aged adults has experienced household
financial hardship since federal UI supplements lapsed by September 2020, in order to
alleviate financial hardship and its adverse sequelae, a logical recommendation is that
any future federal UI bonus match or even exceed the UI bonus level of $600 weekly as
well as a one-time direct payment of $1,200 previously provided through the CARES
Act.3 The COVID-19 relief bill approved by the U.S. Congress and President Trump
limited the federal UI supplement to $300 weekly and a one-time stimulus check of
$600.5

The COVID-19 economic relief plan proposed in January 2021 by the new Biden
administration would bring the recent direct one-time payments to individuals to a total
of $2,000, and UI supplements to $400 weekly through the end of September 2021.6
Even if these elements of the Biden administration’s relief plan are approved by
Congress, the relative $200 weekly shortfall in the UI supplement compared to the
CARES Act would most likely signify that households experiencing income loss during
the pandemic will not have their financial needs sufficiently met. Based on the strong
associations demonstrated between financial hardship and physical and mental health

outcomes in the present study, such a shortfall would likely carry substantial negative
public health consequences. Over the ensuing months, and possibly years of the
pandemic, it is essential that the U.S. Congress and the Biden administration provide
expanded and adequate needs-based social policy relief measures in order to mitigate
the pandemic’s short- and long-term adverse impacts on the physical, mental, and
social well-being of tens of millions of Americans.

Aggregate data were drawn from the latest U.S. Census Bureau Household Pulse Survey public-use data tables for surveys administered between
December 9, 2020 and December 21, 2020. All estimates are for adults age 18-64 years except anxiety and depressive symptoms, for which available
estimates are for adults age 18-69 years. The yellow bars indicate the number of adults (in millions), and are accompanied by percentage estimates
reflecting the number of adults as a percentage of the total number of adults in the denominator (e.g., number responding someone in household lost
employment income, number who applied for UI benefits, number who responded to the survey item). Anxiety symptoms were measured by a survey
item that inquired about the frequency of feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge over the previous week. Depressive symptoms were measured by a survey
item that inquired about the frequency of feeling down, depressed, or hopeless over the previous week. Financial hardship corresponded to it being
somewhat to very difficult (vs not at all or a little difficult) to pay for usual expenses over the previous week.

All models were adjusted for age, age2, gender, race/ethnicity, marital status, educational attainment, 2019 household income, use of federal stimulus
assistance, household size, presence of children in household, overall health status, state of residence, and survey period. The model for current food
insufficiency was also adjusted for food insufficiency prior to March 13, 2020. Participants were surveyed in Phases 2 and 3 of the U.S. Census Bureau
