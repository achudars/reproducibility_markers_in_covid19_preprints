Abstract
The case fatality rate (CFR) is an important index in epidemics and policymakers
need to be aware of this statistic for making sound decisions. However, there are
some uncertainties in the calculation of the fatality rate and the true case fatality
rate can be calculated after an epidemic subsides, we calculated the fatality rate
for 20 countries which had the highest number of confirmed cases with three
scenarios. In this study, we provided detailed information to discuss the studies
that calculate the case fatality rate during the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight
the estimation bias in these studies.
More than 2027000 patients tested positive by April 15th around the world and
129104 deaths have occurred among these people resulting in a gross case fatality
rate of 6.36 percent. The case fatality rate (CFR) is an important index in
epidemics and policymakers need to be aware of this statistic for making sound
decisions. There are, however, some uncertainties in the calculation of the fatality
rate. The true case fatality rate can be calculated after an epidemic subsides, as the
number of deaths will be from the total number of people who had contracted the
disease after the subsidence of epidemics. We, however, may need to calculate this
index while combatting the epidemics. One way is to go back for a certain amount
of time for enumeration of the denominator of the case fatality rate (the total
number of patients who became sick at the same time as those who died). There is
not, however, consensus on how much we should go back to reach the true
denominator. This is somewhat related to the stage of the disease that patients are
being diagnosed. The more complete the case finding strategy, the earlier we
diagnose the patients and the longer the time between diagnosis and death.

Manuel et al. produced three scenarios with 2, 4 and 7 days lag time from
diagnosis to outcome determination and showed a wide range of uncertainty of
fatality rate in these scenarios (1). Some believe that we should go back even more
and use the number of confirmed cases of two weeks earlier as the denominator of
the case fatality rate.
Hung C. et al. and Wang D. et al assumed that the median time from onset of
symptoms to admission on intensive care unit would be around 10 days, whereas
WHO announced that there may be 2 to 8 weeks interval between onset of
symptoms and death (2-4). So, some researchers suggested dividing the cumulative
number of cases in each day by the cumulative number of confirmed cases of 14
days earlier.
Baud et al. produced a graph comparing the apparent fatality rate used by WHO
with fatality rate calculated with 14 days delay and concluded that the latter may
be more accurate (5).
On the other hand, routine statistics of “confirmed cases” usually include more
severe cases and true cases may be much more than the reported ones on a
magnitude of several times.
The situation will be even more complicated if we are interested in “infection
fatality rate” as the latter focuses on the total number of infected people regardless
of their symptomatic situation. In fact, case fatality rate is always greater than
infection fatality rate in diseases with asymptomatic infections, though this
distinction seems not to be the case in Covid-19 as the majority of infections are
believed to become symptomatic. In countries where diagnostic tests are reserved
for the most advanced cases, the majority of mild to moderate cases will not be
enumerated. There are two factors that act in different directions: the first one
tends to underestimate true case fatality rate (as we include all diagnosed cases up
to the time of calculation), and the second one will bias the true rate upward due to
failure to include mild to moderate cases in the denominator. The results of these
factors will depend on the relative magnitude of each one. We believe that the
second factor is possibly much bigger generally, so the true case fatality rate could
be much less than the number that is calculated routinely. The delayed calculation
method is misleading in some situations especially in the first days of the
epidemics. The first cases are very close (or even equal) to the number of deaths.
In fact, in the early stages of the epidemic, only severe or fatal cases may be
noticed by health authorities. Thus, the case fatality rates at the beginning of the

epidemics in Wuhan were much bigger than the true fatality rate(s), as can be seen
in the graph prepared by Baud et.al (5).
We calculated the fatality rate for 20 countries which had the highest number of
confirmed cases up to April 15th with three scenarios. The first scenario assumes
routine WHO figures (enumeration of cases and deaths on the same day). Oneweek and two-week delays were assumed for the second and third scenarios
respectively. As is shown in Fig. 1, apparent fatality ranges from 0.8% (Russia) to
greater than 13.2% (Belgium) with a global value of 6.8%.
If we use the one-week delay calculation (Fig. 2), fatality rates will increase by
about 33% globally (from 6.8% to 9.04%) and ranges from 1.33% (Israel) to
21.18% (UK). These values will increase more in the third scenario (two-week
delay) ranging from 2.07% (Israel) to 43.65% (UK) and the global fatality will be
around 14.73% (Fig. 3). In fact, UK, Belgium, and France will produce fatality
rates greater than 30% in the third scenario. As the epidemic progresses, if we
repeat this calculation, we will notice that the results are be very high in the
exponential phase of epidemic and will decrease by the start of plateau phase. So,
it seems not reasonable to assume a constant delay between diagnosis and death,
especially when the number of cases increases exponentially and the majority of
diagnoses (and confirmed) cases are very severe ones. We suggest, instead to focus
on countries that are in the plateau or descending phase of epidemics e.g. China.
As is seen in these figures, the fatality rate remains pretty constant in all scenarios
for China (4.06%, 4.08%, and 4.09%) respectively. The best estimates, however,
will be achieved if we select a cohort of patients whom we are aware of their
ultimate situation (recovery or death).
Since days from the first symptom to death are different in countries (ranges from
6 to 41 days) (6), one can approach alternative method to estimate the CFR during
an outbreak by dividing the cumulative number of deaths by the sum of total
recovered cases and cumulative deaths at any given time points as follows:
[CFR = deaths / (deaths + recovered)].
Figure 4 shows the results of this estimation with a global value of 21.5%.
However, as average length of stay of patients in hospital vary from country to
country, estimation of the case fatality rate using this model is not precise too. This
approach assumes that risk of death among active cases will be the same as the
sum of deaths plus recovered. However, we know that risk of mortality among
active cases will be much lower than the latter, as the majority of critically ill
patients have died so far.

Finally, we conclude that although apparent fatality rate increases and delayed
fatality rates decrease by the progression of epidemics, using fixed delayed
scenarios for calculation of case fatality rate may lead to serious bias (misleading)
and should not be used. The third approach (deaths / (deaths + recovered)) will also
bias the results upward and none of these approaches can produce unbiased
estimate of case fatality rate (Figure5).
