ABSTRACT

Objective

: Identify predictors of adverse outcome in a Virtual Hospital (VH) setting for

COVID 19.

Design:
Setting:
Participants:

Real-world prospective observational study.

Virtual hospital remote assessment service in West Hertfordshire NHS Trust, UK.

Patients with suspected COVID-19 illness enrolled directly from the community

(post-accident and emergency (A&E) or medical intake assessment) or post-inpatient

admission.

Main outcome measure:
Results:

Death or (re-)admission to inpatient hospital care over 28 days.

900 patients with a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 (455 referred from A&E or

medical intake and 445 post-inpatient) were included in the analysis. 76 (8.4%) of these

experienced an adverse outcome (15 deaths in admitted patients, 3 deaths in patients not

admitted, and 58 additional inpatient admissions). Predictors of adverse outcome were

increase in age (OR 1.04 [95%CI: 1.02, 1.06] per year of age), history of cancer (OR 2.87

[95%CI: 1.41, 5.82]), history of mental health problems (OR 1.76 [95%CI: 1.02, 3.04]),

severely impaired renal function (OR for eGFR <30 = 9.09 [95%CI: 2.01, 41.09]) and having a

positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR result (OR 2.0 [95% CI: 1.11, 3.60]).

Conclusions:

These predictors may help direct intensity of monitoring for patients with

suspected or confirmed COVID-19 who are being remotely monitored by primary or

secondary care services. Further research is needed to identify the reasons for increased risk

of adverse outcome associated with cancer and mental health problems.

ARTICLE SUMMARY

Strengths and limitations of this study
•

The study uses anonymised data from all patients registered for the virtual hospital
between 17/03/20 and 17/05/20, and therefore selection bias is not an issue.

•

At the time of this study, this was the only service providing remote follow-up for
patients with suspected COVID-19 in the area, and therefore our findings are likely
to be relevant to primary care patients receiving remote follow-up.

•

We were able to collect reliable data on a wide range of clinical and demographic
features, and reliably follow all patients for the primary outcome for at least two
weeks following their discharge from the VH.

•

We were not able to extract detailed symptom or clinical examination data, and
there were significant amounts of missing data for some variables.

BACKGROUND
The COVID-19 pandemic has created unprecedented challenges to healthcare services.

Concerns about hospital services being overwhelmed led NHS institutions to develop novel

approaches to caring for patients with suspected COVID-19. These include virtual hospitals

(VH) where patients who have come to the attention of hospital services and need close

monitoring, but do not necessarily need in-patient care, are followed remotely by hospital-

based clinicians.

1

Patients being admitted to such services include those who have

presented at accident and emergency (A&E), those referred to the hospital by general

practitioners, and those who have had an in-patient admission and are being offered a

supported early discharge.

COVID-19 infection is often mild, self-limiting or asymptomatic, but up to 20% of

symptomatic individuals may have severe illness.

2

Identifying those likely to have a worse

prognosis is therefore extremely important. Several studies have reported prognostic

factors in hospitalised patients, but there have been no studies looking at prognosis in those

managed out of hospital via remote patient monitoring services in virtual ward / virtual

hospital (VH) settings, who have less severe clinical presentations but may be at risk of

deterioration. Factors associated with prognosis are likely to be different in VH patients

because they are at a different stage of the disease and/or have less severe symptoms.

Understanding factors associated with prognosis in these patients is important in designing

services and deciding on admission and escalation criteria, monitoring protocols and

discharge criteria. These data are likely to be particularly valuable in informing subsequent

waves of COVID-19 and are likely to be relevant to primary care services providing enhanced

surveillance of patients with suspected COVID-19 in the community. We therefore set out to

identify predictors of adverse outcome in a cohort of patients admitted to a virtual hospital

(VH) at one general hospital in England.

This is a prospective observational study using data collected as part of routine clinical care

by clinicians working in West Hertfordshire Hospitals. In response to the emerging

pandemic, clinicians at Watford General Hospital set up a VH in March 2020. The aim was to

reduce pressure on in-patient capacity by providing remote clinical assessment to patients

at home in place of hospital admission, or to facilitate early discharge from hospital.

Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 were managed in the virtual hospital if they

met the inclusion criteria: oxygen saturation >92% on air (or >88% if known to have long-

term saturations <92%), resting respiratory rate <20, NEWS < 2, CRP <50, resting HR less

than 100, were able to self-isolate and self-care and had access to a telephone or webcam).

Patients were triaged into high or low risk pathways for follow-up. Patients were either

referred directly from A&E or medical intake (referred to the hospital for assessment but

not admitted) (community patients) or were stepped down following a hospital admission

(Figure 1).

Data collection
Participants are patients enrolled in the VH between 17

th

March and 17

th

May 2020. Data

were recorded as part of routine clinical care with an approved clinical pathway, so

participants did not provide informed consent. Data were pseudonymised by staff at West

Hertfordshire Hospitals by removing all personal identifying data such as names, date of

birth, address. Participants were identified with a unique identifying number, with the key

held at West Hertfordshire Hospitals. Pseudonymised data were transferred securely to

researchers at the University of Southampton, who analysed the data.

Participants came from one of two routes: 1) patients referred to the VH from A&E or

medical intake (community), or 2) patients who were discharged (early) directly to the VH

(post-inpatient). At baseline, a general or respiratory consultant working in the VH assessed,

examined and investigated patients as part of their clinical care, and documented data in

their medical record. Data for this study were subsequently extracted from participants’

medical records. Therefore, data were not collected in a protocolised way but reflect the

recording of healthcare data in a busy clinical setting.

Baseline data extracted for the study include: age (calculated from date of birth), gender,

smoking status, type of domicile (home, residential home, nursing home, mental health

unit, sheltered accommodation, other), comorbid conditions (diabetes, asthma, COPD,

other respiratory, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease (CKD), cancer (if recorded

in GP or hospital record), connective tissue disorder (CTD), mental health problem), frailty

(defined as having a Rockwood score >3 at time of presentation), medications (angiotensin

converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), angiotensin II receptor blockers (AR2b), non-steroidal

anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), immunosuppressants, oral diabetic medications, insulin,

anticoagulants (including direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)), long-acting beta-agonist

(LABA) inhalers, long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) inhalers, inhaled corticosteroid

(ICS) inhalers, beta blockers, proton pump inhibitors (PPI), antidepressants, azithromycin,

and hydroxychloroquine), symptoms (presence or absence of: shortness of breath (SOB),

cough, fever, chest pain, diarrhoea, headache, myalgia, fatigue). Baseline examination and

investigation data extracted for the study include: oxygen saturation, chest x-ray (CXR)

result (normal or abnormal), blood tests (white cell count (WCC), lymphocytes, eosinophils,

platelets, C-reactive protein (CRP), creatinine, ferritin, D-dimer, troponin). Oxygen

saturation levels were categorised as ≤91, 92-93, 94-95, ≥96. Clinicians running the VH

attempted to obtain nasal/throat swabs for SARS-CoV-2 testing from all patients. However,

during the early phase of the pandemic there was insufficient testing capacity and patients

who were not admitted were not tested. SARS-CoV-2 testing was done by PCR at Public

Health England (PHE) approved laboratories. Participants were then classified as: COVID-19

positive, negative, inconclusive, or not tested.

Patients referred to the VH were followed up through periodic phone calls to check on their

status. High risk patients were followed up by a respiratory consultant on days 2-5, 7, 10, 14

and beyond if needed, whereas lower risk patients were followed up by a consultant

physician or GP on days 7 and 14. Decisions about discharge were made by the clinician

responsible for the patient based on overall clinical assessment, and were not protocolised.

Participants were monitored for two weeks following their initial discharge from the VH,

using hospital records to identify overnight re-admission to the hospital and/ or death

within this time frame.

Data analysis
Following data cleaning, standard statistical approaches (proportions, mean and standard

deviation) were used to describe the study population, split by route of admission to the VH

(from the community or post-inpatient discharge).

Our primary study endpoint was ‘adverse outcome’, defined as death or overnight hospital

(re-)admission during the follow-up period (until two weeks after discharge from VH). The

relationship between potential baseline predictors and outcome were explored using

univariable and then multivariable logistic regression models. Potential predictors included

in the model were: gender, age, comorbid conditions, medications, symptoms, oxygen

saturation, CXR result, COVID-19 testing, and laboratory test results (WCC, lymphocytes,

eosinophils, platelets, CRP, creatinine). All variables were included in a multivariable logistic

regression model regardless of the statistical significance of their univariate associations.

Backward selection was used with variables retained if p<0.20 (based on log-likelihood).

sensitivity analysis was carried out using a threshold of p<0.10.

A

All adjusted associations

are reported as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals.

We fitted an initial model controlling for the two routes of admission, and we also fitted

separate models for these sub-groups.

Multiple imputation using chained equations was used to impute the values of any missing

predictors or outcome variables.

Sample size calculation
Our sample size calculation was based on the minimum required for a multivariable

prediction model as set out in Riley et al.

and based on the assumption that 10% of

patients experience the outcome and allowed for up to 10 parameters in the final model,

with r

of 20% (based on previous literature). Using these parameters and the Stata

pmsampsize function,

we calculated a minimum required sample size of 398 patients.

Assuming that approximately half of the patients would enter the VH through each of the

two routes of admission and allowing for loss to follow-up and missing data, we aimed to

include 900 patients.

Patient involvement
This was an unfunded study set up to analyse existing routinely collected data during a

pandemic. Patients were not involved in the design, conduct or reporting of the study.

RESULTS
Data from the first 900 patients treated in VH were made available for analysis. This

included 455 who were admitted directly from the community and 445 who entered the VH

post inpatient admissions. Participants were followed for a median of 21 days (range 15 to

46) with very little different between the community (median 21, range 15 to 43 days) and

post-inpatient (median 21, range 15 to 46 days) groups. 76 (8.4%) participants experienced

an adverse outcome (3 out of hospital deaths, 15 deaths in patients that were (re-)admitted

and 58 (re-)admissions to hospital that did not end in death).

The demographic features, comorbid illnesses and current medications of the community

and post-inpatient discharge groups, and those who experienced an adverse outcome, are

described in Table 1. The population admitted to the VH directly from the community

included a greater proportion of females, had a younger average age, more never-smokers

and fewer ex-smokers, fewer nursing home residents, fewer patients with physical

comorbidities and slightly more with comorbid mental health problems than the post-

inpatient group. Baseline symptoms, oxygen saturation levels, and results of investigations

are described in Table 2. A slightly larger proportion of the community group reported

shortness of breath, cough, chest pain, headache, myalgia and fatigue, than in the post-

inpatient group. However, reporting of fever and diarrhoea occurred in a slightly smaller

proportion of the community group compared with the post-inpatient group. Normal

oxygen saturation levels were much more prevalent in the community group compared with

the post-inpatient group (86.5% vs 58.6%) and a smaller proportion of the community group

had an abnormal CXR result compared with the post-inpatient group (48.9% vs 77.5%).

763 (84.8%) of the cohort had a valid COVID-19 PCR test result available, with 33 (3.7%)

having an invalid test result and 104 (11.6%) not having a test performed (20.9% of the

community group and 2.0% of the post-inpatient group). Of those who had a valid test

result, 143/336 (42.6%) of the community group had a test that was positive for COVID-19,

and 271/427 (63.5%) of the post-inpatient group had a positive test.

Predictors of adverse outcome
The results of the univariable and multivariable models identifying predictors of adverse

outcome in the whole population, controlling for route of admission, are shown in Table 3.

* There was only one person in this group.
# No one in this group had the outcome.
BAME= Black, Asian, minority ethnic; CKD= chronic kidney disease; CTD= connective tissue disorder; CVD= cardiovascular disease;
COPD= chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; ACEi= angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor; AR2b= angiotensin II receptor
blocker; NSAID= non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug; ICS= inhaled corticosteroid; DOAC= direct oral anticoagulant; CXR= chest
x-ray; WCC= white cell count; CRP= C-reactive protein; eGFR= estimated glomerular filtration rate.

Univariate analyses found that factors associated with increased odds of adverse outcome

were: post-inpatient route of admission; increasing age; comorbid diabetes, COPD, cancer

and mental health; anticoagulant medication; abnormal CXR; positive COVID-19 test result;

lower lymphocyte count and lower eGFR. The backward stepwise multivariable regression

model controlling for route of admission to VH found that factors associated with an

increase in the odds of adverse outcome were: increasing age (OR 1.04 [95%CI: 1.02, 1.06]

per year), comorbid cancer (OR 2.87 [95%CI: 1.41, 5.82]), comorbid mental health problems

(OR 1.76 [95%CI: 1.02, 3.04]), eGFR consistent with CKD Stage 4 or 5 (OR 9.09 [95% CI: 2.01,

41.09] compared with eGFR≥90), and having a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR result (OR 2.00 [95%

CI: 1.11, 3.60] compared with negative test result). The AUROC for the model including

these values, after bootstrapping, is 0.76 (95% CI 0.70, 0.83). To shed more light on the

results of the regression analyses we reviewed the medical records of participants to further

classify the ‘cancer’ and ‘mental health’ comorbid condition categories. This demonstrated

that the ‘cancer’ category included cutaneous (20%), breast (20%), haematological (11%),

prostate (11%), renal (7%), lung (5%) and other (26%); and the ‘mental health’ category

included anxiety (17.9%), depression (29.3%), mixed anxiety and depression (21.7%), alcohol

abuse/dependency (6.1%), dementia (8.4%) and other (15.6%).

The results of multivariable models for the community and post-inpatient groups separately

are shown in Table 4. In the group referred from the community, only diabetes was found to

be a significant predictor of adverse outcome (OR 14.82 [95% CI: 1.14, 192.34]). In the post

inpatient group cancer (OR 4.81 [95% CI: 1.42, 16.33]) and eGFR consistent with stage 4 or 5

CKD (OR 34.77 [96% CI: 2.62, 459.77]) were significantly associated with increased odds of

adverse outcome and having an ‘other respiratory condition’ was significantly associated

with a reduced odds of adverse outcome (OR 0.14 [95% CI: 0.03, 0.76]). The most common

conditions coded as ‘other respiratory condition’ were history of: tuberculosis (40%),

pulmonary embolism (15%), community acquired pneumonia (9%), asbestosis (6%),

sarcoidosis (6%), pulmonary fibrosis (4%), pneumothorax (4%), lung carcinoma (4%).

DISCUSSION

Summary of results
In this observational study of 900 patients admitted to a virtual hospital for remote follow-

up of suspected COVID-19 illness, we found that 8.1% of the population were (re-)admitted

only 2.0% died during follow-up, giving an overall rate of adverse outcome of 8.4%.

Increasing age, comorbid cancer, comorbid mental health, impaired renal function (lower

eGFR), and a positive COVID-19 test result were all independently associated with an

increased odds of adverse outcome in the combined population, having diabetes was

associated with adverse outcome in the community group and history of cancer, eGFR

consistent with CKD stage 4 or 5, and not having ‘other respiratory conditions’ were

associated with adverse outcome in the post inpatient group.

Strengths and weaknesses
A strength of this study is the real-world nature of the clinical data used. This was a novel

service set up rapidly during a time of crisis, and we included all of the first 900 patients

registered with the virtual hospital service. It is reasonably safe to assume that the

population included in this study includes the vast majority of those that required

monitoring in the community during this period as there were no other services providing

remote monitoring of patients that had required a face-to-face assessment in the area at

that time. This means that we are unlikely to have the selection bias that characterises

many applied research studies. Indeed, by including both patients recruited directly from

the community and those who were post-inpatient admission, we have been able to look at

predictors in this population suitable for remote follow-up overall, and within each sub-

population. For most of the recruitment period there were no general practice hubs

assessing patients with suspected COVID-19 in the West Hertfordshire area, and therefore

our sample likely includes the majority of patients with suspected COVID-19 that were

managed in the community and needed a clinical assessment. A review of the baseline

characteristics of these groups demonstrates that we were able to include populations that

are likely to be representative of those being followed in the community directly, and those

being followed post-inpatient admission. We were able to collect reliable data on a wide

range of clinical and demographic features, and reliably follow all patients for the primary

outcome for at least two weeks following their discharge from the VH through a review of

their hospital records. Another strength is that clinicians were able to validate data collected

at baseline during their regular follow-up phone calls. The ‘real world’ nature of our study

also poses several limitations. We were not able to extract specific symptom data (such as

duration and severity) or data on clinical examination findings (except oxygen saturation) in

a consistent and reliable way and there were significant amounts of missing data for some

variables (for example oxygen saturation). Because COVID-19 tests were initially only

available to inpatients, 20% of the community group did not have a test. We were also

unable to collect data on BMI on enough patients to warrant inclusion in our models. It is

possible that some patients travelled out of area and were lost to follow-up. However, this

seems unlikely given the travel restrictions at the time. Our study is likely underpowered to

detect all predictors, especially in the analysis of our two sub-groups. A further weakness of

our study is that we did not have a sufficiently large sample to be able to split our sample

into development and validation sets. Therefore, our findings need to be validated using an

external data set.

Comparison to other published studies
The most recent version of a ‘living systematic review’ of prediction models for diagnosis

and prognosis of covid-19 included 51 studies describing 66 prediction models.

5

Of the

studies included in the review, 32 used data from China, two from Italy, one from Singapore,

one from the US, ten international data, two simulated data, and three where the origin of

the data was not clear. The majority of the prognostic studies were based on hospitalised

patients, and there were no studies of prognosis in virtual hospital settings.

Age has consistently been shown to be a risk factor for poor prognosis in hospitalised,

and non-hospitalised

populations. A large, well conducted study using data from 575

hospitals in China used data from 1590 patients to develop a clinical score for predicting

‘critical illness’ in patients admitted with COVID-19, and validated their score in 710

patients.

11

Consistent with our findings, they reported age, chest X-ray abnormality, and

history of cancer as predictive of adverse outcome. They also identified haemoptysis,

dyspnoea, unconsciousness, number of comorbidities, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio,

lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and direct bilirubin (BR) as predictors. We did not have

accurate data on symptoms, and did not have enough data on neutrophil count, LDH or BR

to assess these predictors in our model. Another study found that cancer was a risk factor

for intubation but not mortality in 5,688 patients admitted to one hospital in New York City

with COVID-19.

13

Although there has been much debate about the effect of COVID-19 on

mental health, the association between mental health and adverse outcomes from COVID-

19 has not, to the best of our knowledge, been reported in other case series which have

been predominantly based around in-patient cohorts. It is possible that those with mental

health problems were admitted more frequently because of perceived vulnerability on the

part of the clinicians undertaking review assessments, rather than an actual increased risk of

physical deterioration. It is also possible that the association between mental health and

14

obesity found in this study was confounded by obesity,

as we were not able to document

BMI consistently in this study. However, there may be a variety of reasons why those with

mental health disorders are more vulnerable, including reduced levels of activity, impaired

socioeconomic status and reduced health care usage for other medical problems. Patients

with mental disorders have been noted to have poorer outcomes from other comorbidities,

including mortality.

15

Dementia was a key mental health problem in this cohort, and those

with dementia do appear to be at high risk. A study of death certificates in England found

that 25.7% of COVID-19 deaths were in patients with dementia, compared to 23.8% of all

deaths.

16

Dementia is clearly associated with other risk factors for poor outcome, but the

hypothesis that dementia is associated with a direct causal effect on prognosis warrants

further exploration. Close proximity of carers, increased risk of falls, and risk of ‘happy

hypoxia’ are possible mechanisms. Other mental illnesses are unlikely to be mentioned on a

death certificate, and we have not been able to identify other studies exploring the

association between mental health problems and the need for hospital admission for

COVID-19.

Given the lack of COVID testing availability during the first few months of the outbreak,

diagnostics were only available for patients admitted or those judged to be most at risk. In

this cohort, a positive PCR was independently correlated with an increased risk of adverse

outcome. This may reflect that testing was initially confined to those patients deemed to be

most unwell or may be because patients who did not have COVID-19, or who had a low viral

load which was not detected, had a better prognosis.

The inverse association between being coded as having an ‘other respiratory condition’ and

experiencing an adverse outcome is difficult to explain. Patients with a history of an

assortment of previous and ongoing chronic and acute conditions were lumped together in

this category and it is therefore very difficult to interpret the results. Some of the included

conditions are associated with immune dysfunction, but it seems unlikely that there is a

biological mechanism through which such an assortment of acute and chronic conditions

would have a protective effect on adverse outcomes. Therefore, this is more likely to

represent a chance finding or unmeasured confounding.

Implications for policy, practice and research
COVID-19 has changed the face of modern society,

17

the impact felt from the home to the

workplace. The health service has embraced virtual working and remote patient care at

scale, in a way never before attempted or achieved. Changes have been rushed through at

great pace- and now is the time to reflect, analyse and consider. Same Day Emergency Care

(SDEC) (and other out of hospital care pathways) are increasingly being utilised to manage

an ever wider range of conditions, ranging from frailty to pneumothorax.

18

Recent advice

from NHS England has advocated the use of oxygen saturation probes in the safe

management of COVID-19 as part of remote patient monitoring services.

19

COVID-19 is a

novel disease entity, and unlike many of the other pathologies managed within ambulatory

care settings, the natural course of the disease is not yet fully understood. Primary and

secondary care practitioners require interim guidance as well as knowledge of clinical

practice outside of their own region to guide patient care pending the outcomes of large-

scale high-quality research projects.

The relatively low incidence of death and readmission in the multimorbid patients in this

study suggest that the clinicians managing this service were able to select and monitor

patients in a way that was safe. Comparing outcomes with other approaches to managing

these patients, ideally in a randomised trial, would provide more reassurance in this regard.

Our results suggest that in addition to well-known risk factors such as age, clinicians working

at the primary-secondary care interface should be aware that patients with coexisting

cancer, severely impaired renal function, and mental illness are all at greater risk of hospital

admission and/or death, and therefore warrant more careful follow-up. Further research is

urgently needed to validate these findings and understand the reasons for the apparent

worse prognosis in these patients. There is also a need to assess the most cost-effective

approaches to monitoring and supporting patients in the community with

suspected/confirmed COVID-19 who do not (yet) require hospital admission.

Conclusions
This observational study of a real-world remote monitoring VH service, set up rapidly during

the onset of the worst pandemic seen in decades, has demonstrated that it was possible to

set up a service that resulted in a low incidence of deaths (2.0%) and readmissions (8.1%).

When planning and commissioning services in primary and secondary care to manage

patients with COVID-19 during this ongoing pandemic, we would suggest that the risk

factors for deterioration identified in this cohort, namely age, significant renal impairment

(CKD stage 4-5), history of cancer, and history of mental health problems, should merit

more intensive follow up and monitoring.
