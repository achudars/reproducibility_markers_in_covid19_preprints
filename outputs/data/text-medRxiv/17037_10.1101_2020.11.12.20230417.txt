ABSTRACT

54

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) fatality rate varies in different patient

55

groups. However, the underlying mechanisms that explain this variation are poorly

56

understood. Here, we reanalyzed and integrated public RNAseq datasets of

57

nasopharyngeal swabs and peripheral blood leukocytes from patients with SARS-

58

CoV-2, comparing transcription patterns according to sex, age, and viral load. We

59

found that female and young patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 exhibited a similar

60

transcriptomic pattern with a larger number of total (up- and downregulated)

61

differentially expressed genes (DEGs) compared to males and elderly patients. The

62

transcriptional analysis showed a sex-specific profile with a higher transcriptional

63

modulation of immune response-associated genes in female and young subjects

64

against SARS-CoV-2. The functional clustering was characterized by a highly

65

correlated interferome network of cytokine/chemokine- and neutrophil-associated

66

genes that were enriched both in nasopharyngeal cells and peripheral blood of

67

COVID-19 patients. Females exhibited reduced transcriptional levels of key pro-

68

inflammatory/neutrophil-related genes such as CXCL8 receptors (CXCR1/CXCR2),

69

IL-1β, S100A9, ITGAM, and DBNL compared to males, which correlate with a

70

protective gene expression profile against inflammatory damage. Our data indicate

71

specific immune-regulatory pathways associated with sex and age of patients

72

infected with SARS-CoV-2. These results point out therapeutic targets to reduce

73

morbidity and mortality of COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION

76

More than ten months after the outbreak of the novel Coronavirus disease

77

2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China1–3, approximately 43 million confirmed cases of

78

COVID-19 and more than 1,1 million deaths have been reported worldwide4. The

79

clinical spectrum of COVID-19 ranges from asymptomatic to severe pulmonary

80

disease, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)

81

expression of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the SARS-CoV-2 entry

82

receptor7, and dysregulation of the immune response likely contribute to more severe

83

disease in older patients with comorbidities. Even as there is an increased

84

understanding of what increases the risk of severe disease, the increased

85

male/female mortality ratio remains poorly understood, especially considering the

86

lack of gender differences in disease incidence6,8. A recent study reported no gender

87

differences in the levels of anti-S1-IgM and -IgG antibody titers nor the number of

88

naïve- or memory B cells. Compared to males, peripheral blood mononuclear cells

89

(PBMCs) from females exhibited higher levels of terminally differentiated T cells

90

expressing

91

regulators (PD-1 and TIM-3) 9. Moreover, male patients displayed higher plasma

92

levels of pro-inflammatory innate immune cytokine/chemokines (CXCL8 and IL-18)10.

These findings indicate a better capacity for immune modulation in females

Although these studies have highlighted differences in immune responses that

114

underlie disparities in male and elderly outcomes, a consensus profile reporting the

115

cytokines and genes associated with neutrophil-mediated immunity is still missing.

The specific set of immune system genes in females underlying the protective

RESULTS

127

Association between cytokine/chemokine- and neutrophil-related genes in

128

nasopharyngeal swabs

129

We first performed a transcriptomic reanalysis of nasopharyngeal swabs from

130

patients described by Lieberman et al., 2020 (GSE152075)19 to characterize the

131

expression landscape of immune system genes. We divided the samples according

132

to sex, age (elderly> 60y and young <60 y), and viral load (413 patients infected with

133

SARS-CoV-2 and 54 negative controls) (Fig. 1a). Groups of patients with high and

134

low viral loads, and younger and older age, were gender-matched to avoid

135

confounding effects (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). Female and young

136

patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 exhibited a higher number of total (up- and down-

137

regulated) differentially expressed genes (DEGs) when compared to male and elderly

138

patients (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Table S3). Genes significantly deregulated in

139

each group of patients were selected to perform enrichment analysis using the Gene

140

Ontology terms through the Enrichr tool 21,22. Overall, we observed cytokine-mediated

141

signaling pathway (CMSP) and neutrophil-mediated immunity (NMI) categories were

142

enriched by up- and down-regulated genes, respectively, among the compiled top-10

143

biological process categories of each group (Supplementary Tables S4 and S5).

144

Also, we used CEMiTool23 to gain insights into the systemic function of

145

nasopharyngeal swab genes by performing modular co-expression enrichment and

146

network analyses. Among the gene-modules identified, module 1 (M1) indicated a co-

147

expression association between genes associated with neutrophil degranulation

148

signaling by interleukins and GPCR ligand binding (chemokines and their receptors)

149

(Fig. 1c). When we compared the total number of genes associated with CMSP and

150

NMI categories, female and young patients present higher numbers of up- and down-

151

regulated DEGs associated with these categories compared to male and elderly

152

patients (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Tables S6 and S7). Females displayed an

153

enhanced quantity of DEGs compared to male, elderly, and patients with low viral

154

load (described in Supplementary Tables S6-S8). These observations indicate a

155

higher transcriptional modulation of the immune response in female and young

156

patients compared to male and elderly patients.

157

Next, we evaluated the strength of the association between CMSP and NMI

158

(described in Supplementary Tables S6-S8). Canonical-correlation analysis (CCA)

159

revealed a strongly correlated network between these CMSP and NMI genes in the

160

immune response to SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 1e, f). Among others, the CCA showed an

161

association between IL-1β, IL-18 receptor accessory protein (IL-18RAP), C-C

162

chemokine receptor type 1 (CCR1), interferon-induced guanylate-binding protein 2

163

(GBP2), interferon regulatory factor (IRF7) with NMI transcripts such as C-X-C motif

164

chemokine ligand 8 (CXCL8, also called IL-8), lysosome-associated membrane

165

protein 1 (LAMP1) and cytochrome B-245 Alpha Chain (CYBA). The association of

166

these genes suggests an orchestrated modulation between interferon regulated

167

genes (GBP2, IRF7, and IFI30), recruitment and neutrophil degranulation (CXCL8

168

and LAMP1), and oxidative stress (CYBA). Taken together, the CCA analysis

169

suggests that these two sets (CMSP and NMI) of highly correlated genes have a

170

systemic representativity, suggesting pathophysiological relevance in COVID-19

171

patients.

176

coherent results compared to the swab dataset analyses. CEMITool analysis

177

revealed ten co-expression modules enriched in whole leukocytes of COVID-19

178

patients compared to the control group. Among them, module M6 was enriched by

179

interferon signaling genes, while module M7 was composed of genes associated with

180

neutrophil degranulation in the COVID-19 group (Fig. 2a-c). The data, therefore,

181

points toward a systemic (not restricted to upper airways) immunopathological

182

association between interferon signaling and neutrophil-mediated immunity in

183

patients with COVID-19. Supplementary Tables S9 and S10 describe the DEGs

184

associated with CMSP and NMI in the GSE157103 dataset.

185

Effect of sex and age on cytokine-mediated signaling pathways in COVID-19

186

patients

187

To better understand the effect of gender and age on the anti-SARS-CoV-2

188

immune response in patients with COVID-19, we sought to further characterize the

189

influence of gender and age on CMSP (detailed pro- or anti-inflammatory function of

190

each gene is described in Supplementary Table 11). Multivariate comparison

191

analysis of genes associated with CMSP identified in the nasopharyngeal swabs

192

(GSE152075) revealed an upregulated spectrum of gene expression between SARS-

193

CoV-2 positive (SC2) and negative (Neg. SC2) groups (Fig. 3a). Central tendency

of CMSP transcriptional levels demonstrate the overall tendency in each SARS-CoV-

197

load). Hierarchical clustering analyses of gene expression revealed similarities

198

between the CMSP signature of female and young groups and a close relationship

199

between male and elderly patients. Female and young patients clustered with

200

patients who had high viral loads, the latter presenting the patients with the most

201

upregulated CMSP (Fig. 3c and 3d). Conversely, males and elderly patients

202

clustered near patients with low viral load. In this context, anti-viral transcripts

203

induced by interferons25 were most upregulated in female, young and high-viral-load

204

patients compared to male, elderly and low-viral-load patients. These included

205

Interferon Induced Protein With Tetratricopeptide Repeats (IFIT)1, IFIT2, IFIT3;

206

chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand (CXCL)9, CXCL10, CXCL11; 2 , 5 -oligoadenylate

207

synthetase (OAS)1, OAS2, and OAS3; tripartite motif (TRIM)5 and TRIM22. The

208

same phenomenon was observed in terms of transcripts of endogenous activators of

209

the immune system, such as the CD40 ligand and co-stimulatory molecules (CD80

210

and CD86). Thus, our data suggest a higher transcriptional modulation of the immune

211

response triggered by SARS-CoV-2 in female and young patients compared to males

212

and elderly.

lesser extent in male and elderly patients. The cluster analysis suggests that these

227

expression patterns reflect a close functional relationship (Fig. 4d) between low load,

228

female and young patients.

229

We next analyzed the CMSP and NMI genes in two different datasets

230

(GSE157103 and GSE156063). The circos plot showed that patients with a high viral

231

load shared a higher number of CMSP genes with younger and female patients (Fig.

232

4e). Interestingly, female, young, and low-load patients shared more common NMI

233

genes in swab and total leukocytes than male and elderly patients (Fig. 4f). This

234

result suggests a predominant downregulation of NMI genes in groups of patients

235

who do not develop severe disease. Extended Data Fig. 2 shows the result of ridge

236

regression analysis, which indicates associations of each gene belonging to the

237

CMSP and NMI (described below) with viral load, in line with the formerly described

238

results. Of note, several genes present in the dataset GSE152075 were also

239

identified in another study of nasopharyngeal swabs developed by Mick et al.

240

(Extended Data Fig. 3, dataset GSE156063), increasing the validity of these

241

findings. Further, the upregulation of CMSP and NMI genes was present in both the

242

datasets described above, which are of bulk RNAseq, and in a single-cell RNAseq

243

study (Extended Data Fig. 4).

we sought to further characterize the transcriptomic features of COVID-19. We

248

searched for sex differences between DEGs identified in female vs. male patients

249

with COVID-19 as well as female vs. healthy male controls throughout the different

250

RNAseq datasets. For instance, females with SARS-CoV2 showed reduced levels of

251

CXCL8 and its receptors (CXCR1 and CXCR2) in different swab datasets (Fig 5a-

252

5d). In addition, Mick´s and Liberman´s datasets presented a considerable overlap of

253

DEGs and shared functional enrichment categories. We found that downregulated

254

genes in females SC2 also enriched CMSP and NMI pathways (Extended Data Fig.

255

6). These shared genes are essential for conventional neutrophil chemotaxis and the

256

recruitment of polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN)-MDSCs

257

exhibited reduced levels of IL-1β when compared to male patients, a pro-

258

262

females infected with SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to males. Multivariate regression

263

analysis indicated that the expression of genes shown in Fig. 5a and 5b was strongly

264

associated with the remaining genes belonging to CMSP and NMI (Fig. 5g and

265

Extended Data Figs. 7 and 8). In addition, this approach indicates that females tend

266

to systemically have a subtle lower gene expression pattern of immune genes

267

compared to males infected with SARS-CoV-2. Likewise, Extended Data Fig 7a and

268

7b show the multivariate regressions between these DEGs' expression from females

269

with the viral load and age, respectively. These results suggest that not all these

270

genes demonstrate a divergent correlation by different viral loads and age, indicating

271

that this modulation may be associated exclusively with male-female differences.

277

contrast, NMI genes were upregulated in Neg. SC2 females compared to Neg. SC2

278

males (Fig 5f). These results show that even in the absence of the SARS-CoV-2,

279

females present a different expression pattern of these genes, indicating that the

280

immune response may be sex-dependent. This mucosal baseline state of reduced

281

CMSP and increased NMI resembles an immune protective quiescent-like33–35 state.

282

Fig. 6a summarizes these DEGs from females described above and their molecular

283

function. Beyond the genes mentioned above, COVID-19 females presented seven

exclusive DEGs (Fig. 6b) compared to the other SARS-CoV-2 positive groups

associated with any of these pathways. This signaling antagonizes the IFN-mediated

289

immune response in the airways36. The other three downregulated DEGs (JUP,

290

DYNLL1, and DBNL) belong to the neutrophil degranulation category. This

291

differential expression reinforces the possibility of a better-modulated transcriptome

292

profile of females in response to SARS-CoV-2.

293

In addition, to better understand this immune modulation profile underlying the

294

relationship of CMSP and NMI gender dimorphism in COVID-19, we performed an

295

Interferome analysis of these two sets of DEGs. This analysis revealed an

296

interconnected network of IFN-regulated genes modulated either by IFN type I, II,

297

and III (Fig. 6b and Supplementary Tables 13 and 14).

found several upregulated CMSP and NMI DEGs throughout different public datasets

303

of large patient cohorts infected with SARS-CoV-2. CCA and interferome analysis

304

indicated that these DEGs form an interconnected network of several IFN-regulated

305

genes. Females and young patients exhibited a higher capacity to trigger a higher

306

transcriptional modulation than male and elderly patients. At the same time, females

307

and young patients displayed downregulation of inflammatory genes such as CXCL8

308

receptors (CXCR1 and CXCR2), IL-1β, NBEAL2, and S100A9. These genes are

The role of neutrophils in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 is currently

316

debated. While these cells are classically known to play an essential role in the

317

immune response against bacterial and fungal infections, their antiviral function has

318

only recently been characterized40–42. Neutrophils infiltrate the respiratory tract during

319

viral infection and are required for a protective immune response against coronavirus.

320

They also contribute significantly to respiratory tract pathology, i.e., hemorrhagic

321

lesions, epithelial barrier permeability, and cellular inflammation in the lungs

322

Neutrophilia has consistently been found in COVID-19 patients and correlates with

323

worse clinical outcomes14,44–46. However, recent studies assessing the activation

324

status of neutrophils in COVID-19 patients have come to somewhat paradoxical

325

results. Some investigators have identified that severe SARS-CoV-2 infection is

326

associated with excessive release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and neutrophil

327

extracellular traps (NETs)14,15. Conversely, other studies demonstrated that the

expansion of MDSCs increased with the severity of COVID-19, which agrees with our

329

report of downregulated NMI signature 16,18,47.

330

MDSCs are a heterogeneous group of immature myeloid cells that have the
18,48

331

capacity to suppress non-specific T and B lymphocyte responses

. Much of our

332

knowledge about MDSCs have been obtained through cancer studies

333

that tumors manipulate the myeloid system to evade the host immune response49.

334

However, the physiological role of MDSCs has become increasingly evident in

335

COVID-19. The results of several studies suggest that MDSCs are components of

336

the healthy immune system and play a protective role in homeostatic and disease

337

contexts. MDSCs expand when necessary to protect the host against tissue damage

during autoimmune and inflammatory diseases50,51, traumatic stress, transplantation,

and sepsis

severity, their presence suggests an attempt of the host to modulate the severe

341

immune dysregulation triggered by SARS-CoV-2. In the same way, the high capacity

342

of women to better modulate CMSP and NMI could represent a protective

343

mechanism against severe COVID-19.

348

also by limiting airway inflammation by directly modulating pathogenic neutrophil

350

protective to detrimental state, it will be imperative to identify markers that allow for

351

appropriate therapeutic administration of IFN or JAK inhibitors to selected patients

352

with COVID-19 54,55.

353

While our study offers an explanation for the differences between mortality and

354

morbidity between males and females with COVID-19, further potential mechanisms

355

should be addressed. For instance, estrogen receptor signaling may protect against

In conclusion, our integrative approach indicates that the gene expression

363

profile associated with CMSP and NMI has a distinct pattern according to sex and

364

age in patients with COVID-19. Thus, suggesting the existence of specific immune-

365

regulatory pathways underlying the sexual dimorphism of COVID-19 morbidity and

366

mortality. The specific profile of immune genes may help the future development of

367

better targeted therapies to improve the outcomes of COVID-19.

Statistics

425

Prior to the application of the statistical methods described below, the variable

426

transformation was performed as described in each figure legend. For gene

427

expression data, we added unity to all counts and consecutively applied a base two

428

logarithmic function for each gene variable, herein called transformed gene

429

expression. The remaining quantitative variables were scaled. Only CMSP and NMI

430

genes were included in the data analysis as response variables. We used

431

Nonparametric Multivariate Analysis of Variance (NP-MANOVA)68 to test differences

432

on the mean vectors of gene expressions between SARS-CoV-2 positive (SC2) and

433

negative (Neg. SC2) groups, separately for both CMSP and NMI genes.

434

Relative effect analysis

435

For each gene, relative effects68 of transformed expression were compared between

436

SC2 and Neg. SC2 groups, with associated 95% confidence intervals, calculated via

437

bootstrap simulation using the method of resampling pairs69. Bootstrap statistics were

438

based on 1000 simulations and percentile confidence intervals69.

439

Canonical Correlation Analysis

440

Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)70 was applied in order to investigate patterns

441

of association between genes related to CMSP and NMI genes, considering the

442

observations from the SC2 group alone. We retained the first two canonical variates

443

(CVs) for subsequent interpretations.

444

Ridge Regression

445

We used Ridge Regression71 for setting up a predictive model for the response

446

variable viral load as a function of the regression covariates age, gender, and

447

transformed gene expressions, considering observations from the SC2 group alone.

448

Model estimates were obtained using 10-fold cross validation71. As a testing set, 25%

449

of the dataset was kept and used for evaluating the model prediction accuracy.

450

Multivariate Regression

451

We performed Multivariate Regression (MVR) analysis with normally distributed

452

additive errors72 to model the mean vector of transformed gene expression

453

associated with the six genes found with differentially expression in females (CD14,

454

CXCR1, CXCR2, IL1B, NBEAL2, and S100A9), considering the observations from

455

the SC2 group alone. The regression covariates included were the principal

456

component scores of the remaining genes and variables age and viral load. These

457

scores resulted from a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based on the

458

transformed gene expressions for genes not included as responses in the MVR

459

mode. After PCA, the estimated matrix of loadings was rotated using the varimax

460

criterion. The Likelihood Ratio (LR) and Wald statistics were used, respectively, for

461

testing the generalized hypothesis involving MRV model parameters and obtaining

462

the statistical significance of each regression slope individually72. The level of

463

significance for all hypothesis testing was fixed at 5%, and the wild bootstrap method

464

was used for calculating p-values and parameter’s standard errors robust against

465

heteroscedasticity on the regression errors73. Bootstrap statistics were based on

466

1000 simulations69. Model adequacy was studied using the metrics developed in

467

Díaz-García et al., 200372.

The sample median and sample interquartile range were calculated using R software

470

version 4.0.2 (https://www.r-project.org/index.html). The NP-MANOVA, CCA, MVR,

471

and Ridge Regression analysis were all performed on the R software version 4.0.2.

472

Specifically, for NP-MANOVA, it was used the npmv package68 for CCA the

473

whitening70 ,DFA, and CANCOR packages, for Ridge Regression the glmnet

474

package and for PCA the psych package. MVR was implemented by the authors
