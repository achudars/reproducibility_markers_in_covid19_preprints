Abstract
Objectives: This study investigates the association between the treatment with heparin and
mortality in patients admitted with Covid-19.
Methods: Routinely recorded, clinical data, up to the 24th of April 2020, from the 2075 patients
with Covid-19, admitted in 17 hospitals in Spain between the 1st of March and the 20th of April
2020 were used. The following variables were extracted for this study: age, gender, temperature,
and saturation of oxygen on admission, treatment with heparin, hydroxychloroquine,
azithromycin, steroids, tocilizumab, a combination of lopinavir with ritonavir, and oseltamivir,
together with data on mortality. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to investigate
the associations.
Results: At the time of collecting the data, 301 patients had died, 1447 had been discharged
home from the hospitals, 201 were still admitted, and 126 had been transferred to hospitals not
included in the study. Median follow up time was 8 (IQR:5-12) days. Heparin had been used in
1734 patients. Heparin was associated with lower mortality when the model was adjusted for age
and gender, with OR (95%CI): 0.55 (0.37-0.82) p=0.003. This association remained significant
when saturation of oxygen <90%, and temperature >37C were added to de model with OR:
0.54(0.36-0.82) p=0.003, and also when all the other drugs were included as covariates OR: 0.42
(0.26-0.66) p<0.001.
Conclusions: The association between heparin and lower mortality observed in this study can be
acknowledged by clinicians in hospitals and in the community. Randomized controlled trials to
assess the causal effects of heparin in different therapeutic regimes are required.

-

The administration of heparin was associated with lower mortality in patients admitted
with Covid-19.

-

Our findings support that there is a thrombotic component in the development of
respiratory distress for these patients.

-

The positive effect of heparin seems consistent and its use, when indicated, could be
considered in clinical settings.

-

Randomized controlled trials are necessary to complement observational studies, and
assess the causal associations between heparin, in different therapeutic regimes, and
clinical outcomes.

-

Heparin is easy to administer, its use in ambulatory patients, to prevent admissions, or
reduce their duration, could also be considered by clinicians and future researchers.

Introduction
In December 2019 an outbreak of disease caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2 was declared in
China. This disease, later named Covid-19, spread throughout the world in the first few months
of 2020.[1, 2] Around 80% of patients have mild symptoms, the rest can develop severe disease,
mainly interstitial pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, and require hospital
admission. Intensive care may be necessary for 5% of patients. Mortality is estimated to be less
than 2%. [3, 4] The large number of simultaneous cases of Covid-19 has overloaded hospitals,
making it very difficult to provide an adequate care. The spread of Covid-19 is negatively
affecting all areas of healthcare, and is also having an adverse impact on the entire society and
the international economy.
Thrombotic events in different tissues, with consistent clinical laboratory and radiological
findings, have been reported in patients with Covid-19.[5-7] Perfusion abnormalities in lungs
have been observed in patients who underwent dual-energy CTs.[8] There is also pathological
evidence of the presence of platelet-fibrin thrombi in small arterial vessels in lung tissues of
patients who have died of Covid-19.[9] Based on these finding, doctors have used heparin to
treat or prevent the coagulation disorder associated with the infection.[5-7, 9] This treatment can
be associated with the clinical improvement of the patients, and decrease the duration of
admissions and the mortality of Covid-19. Heparin is safe, economical, and easy to use, it can be
given both to admitted and outpatients. However, the use of heparin in Covid-19 patients is still
supported by limited evidence. This study investigates the association of the use of heparin with
mortality in a large number of patients admitted with Covid-19.

Methods
Anonymized clinical records up to the 24th of April 2020, of all patients (n=2075) with Covid-19,
admitted in 17 Spanish hospitals, of the healthcare provider HM Hospitales, were reviewed.
These hospitals are based in the provinces of Barcelona, Coruña, León, Madrid, Pontevedra, and
Toledo.[10] Patients had been diagnosed with polymerase chain reaction test of respiratory
samples for SARS-CoV-2, between the 1st of March and the 20th of April 2020. Seven patients
had been admitted before the 1st of March 2020. Data on age, gender, temperature and saturation
of oxygen at the time of admission, together with treatments at any time during admission with
heparin, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, steroids, tocilizumab, a combination of lopinavir
with ritonavir, and oseltamivir, were collected. The limited evidence on which these treatments
were based, and the rapidly evolving clinical protocols, resulted in these drugs being given in
many different specific preparations, doses, and frequency. No information on dosage, duration
of treatment, route of administration, or specific preparations of these drugs was collected.
Finally, data on mortality were recorded.
The age of patients treated and not treated with heparin was compared with t tests. The
proportion of men and women for those treated and not treated with heparin was compared with
chi squared tests. The association between the treatment with heparin and mortality was
examined with a logistic regression model that was first adjusted for age and gender. Second,
two markers of severity, temperature > 37 C and saturation of oxygen < 90% on admission, were
introduced into the model as well. Finally, treatments with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin,
steroids, tocilizumab, a combination of lopinavir with ritonavir, or oseltamivir, were added to the
model. Sensitivity analyses were made to compare estimates based on using missing data of
severity markers as categories with, 1) estimates based on complete data dropping variables with

missing observations, and 2) complete case analysis. Stata 14 was used for the analysis.[11] The
ethics committee of HM Hospitales approved this study. Data were anonymized before the
authors could access it.

Results:
Among the 2075 patients whose records were reviewed, 1256 were men, 819 were women, and
the mean age was 67.57. At the time of collecting the data, 301 patients had died, 1447 had been
discharged home from the hospitals, 201 were still admitted, and 126 had been transferred to
hospitals not included in the study. Median follow up time was 8 (IQR: 5-12) days. Among the
1734 patients who received heparin 242 had died. The patients treated with heparin were older
than the ones who did not received it (p<0.001) and the proportion of men and women who
received heparin did not have significant difference. (Table 1).
Heparin was associated with lower mortality when the model was adjusted for age and gender,
with OR (95%CI): 0.55 (0.37-0.82) p=0.003. This association remain significant when saturation
of oxygen <90%, and temperature >37C were added to de model with OR: 0.54(0.36-0.82)
p=0.003, and also when all the other drugs were included as covariates OR: 0.42 (0.26-0.66)
p<0.001.

Discussion
The administration of heparin was associated with lower mortality in patients admitted with
Covid-19. This study has strengths and limitations. Patients were not randomized and the
difference in outcome may be explained by factors other than the treatment with heparin. In an
effort to control for the severity of disease, or the effects of other drugs, the models were

adjusted for clinical markers and other treatments. The observation of a large number of
unselected patients in 17 hospitals, and the analyses run with some variations to test the
consistency of the results, are also strengths of this study. However, residual confounding is
always present in all observational research. For all models the sensitivity analyses described in
the methods were used to assess the impact of missing data on the two severity markers, and
results were consistent with those presented.
While the nature of the hypoperfusion of lungs in Covid-19 patients is still not fully understood,
our findings support that there is a thrombotic component in the development of respiratory
distress for these patients.[6, 8] The association between heparin and survival is consistent with
the findings of an observational study where among the 99 patients who received heparin, and
had a sepsis-induced coagulopathy index>4, mortality was significantly lower.[12] A recent
observational study conducted in a hospital has also reported lower mortality among the 786
Covid-19 patients who received anticoagulation.[13]
To the best of our knowledge, there is no interventional evidence on the management of the
coagulopathy associated with Covid-19. The positive effect of heparin seems consistent and its
use, when indicated, could be considered in clinical settings. Randomized controlled trials are
necessary to complement observational studies, and assess the causal associations between
heparin, in different therapeutic regimes, and clinical outcomes. Heparin is easy to administer, its
use in ambulatory patients, to prevent admissions, or reduce their duration, could also be
considered by clinicians and future researchers.
