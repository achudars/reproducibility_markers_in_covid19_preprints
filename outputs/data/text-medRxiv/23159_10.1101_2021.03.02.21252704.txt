Abstract
We describe a novel assay method: reverse-transcription reverse-complement
polymerase chain reaction (RT-RC-PCR), which rationalises reverse transcription
and NGS library preparation into a single closed tube reaction. By simplifying the
analytical process and cross-contamination risks, RT-RC-PCR presents disruptive
scalability and economy while using NGS and LIMS infrastructure widely available
across health service, institutional and commercial laboratories.
We present a validation of RT-RC-PCR for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2
RNA by NGS. The limit of detection is comparable to real-time RT-PCR, and no
obvious difference in sensitivity was detected between extracted nasopharyngeal
swab (NPS) RNA and native saliva samples.
The end point measurement of RT-RC-PCR is NGS of amplified sequences within
the SARS-CoV-2 genome; we demonstrated its capacity to detect different variants
using amplicons containing delH69-V70 and N501Y, both of which emerged in the
UK Variant of Concern B.1.1.7 in 2020.
In summary, RT-RC-PCR has potential to facilitate accurate mass testing at
disruptive scale and cost, with concurrent detection of variants of concern.

Introduction
The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused detrimental social
and economic effects worldwide and, at the time of writing, is responsible for over
2.5 million deaths globally.
The etiopathogenic agent responsible for COVID-19 is the novel SARS-CoV-2
coronavirus. The gold standard test for molecular diagnosis of current SARS-CoV2
infection requires RNA extraction from the given sample followed by real-time
qualitative detection of viral RNA by real-time reverse-transcription PCR (rRT-PCR).
Whilst different sample types are known to yield different positivity rates through the
course of an infection [1], practicalities of sample collection and subsequent
processing are the predominant consideration. Generally, RNA has been extracted
from nasophyaryngeal swab (NPS) samples collected by healthcare personnel, but
more recently saliva has become a popular sample type due to the ease of self
collection, though it remains uncertain which sample type is more valid for testing.
Attempts have been made to rationalise the test procedure by simplifying the RNA
extraction step or eliminating it entirely [2-6]. Such refinements facilitate more
streamlined laboratory processing, reduce cost and ease the issue of supply of
critical reagents.
Reverse transcription loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) has been
developed as an alternative to rRT-PCR [7 8]. Because this reaction uses strand
displacement instead of thermal cycling, amplification is extremely fast, and can
significantly reduce the time required for the measurement phase of the test. It is
worth noting that both rRT-PCR and RT-LAMP rely on indirect fluorometric
measurement and as such may require secondary confirmation that the signal has
derived from the desired target typically by melt analysis of the amplicon.
Expansion of viral testing to community-based or population-based screening is
necessary to detect asymptomatic transmission and potentially restore freedom to
interpersonal interactions within and between communities.
A laboratory setup suitable for such testing must be capable of handling in the order
of tens of thousands of tests per day and the test itself must be sensitive and
specific, economical, rapid and robust; and preferably use widely-available and
existing infrastructure. Key challenges to scaling include the timely and safe delivery
of samples to the testing site, the extraction of RNA, the robust supply of reagents

that are in high demand, and the simplification of laboratory testing processes so that
they can be effectively automated. To achieve the required scale of testing, a high
level of parallelisation is required in the measurement phase of the test.
Typically rRT-PCR and RT-LAMP tests can be analysed in batches of up to 96
samples. Even considering fast turnaround on the analysis platforms, multiple
instruments are required to analyse tens of thousands of tests per day.
Next generation sequencing (NGS) represents an alternative platform with the
capacity to analyse many tens of thousands of samples in a single instrument run.
Individual samples can be labelled with short unique identifying DNA sequences
(indexes) prior to sequencing so that the data can be assigned to samples during
analysis. The challenge with this approach is streamlining the library preparation
process and providing sufficient indexes for the analysis scale required without risk
of cross-contamination between samples.
Conventional amplicon-based library preparation methods require separate reactions
to amplify the targets and subsequently apply the sample indexes. This process is
complex in terms of automation and presents an inherent risk of cross contamination
due to the opening and manipulation of tubes containing exponentially amplified
target material prior to the application of indexes.
Here we describe a novel assay method: reverse-transcription reverse-complement
polymerase chain reaction (RT-RC-PCR). RC-PCR rationalises NGS library
preparation into a single closed tube reaction, thus simplifying the analytical process
and eliminating risks of cross-contamination. By integrating reverse transcription
(RT) into RC-PCR we have developed a single-tube SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection
assay using NGS. RT-RC-PCR presents disruptive scalability and economy while
using NGS and LIMS infrastructure widely available across health service,
institutional and commercial laboratories.
We present a validation of RT-RC-PCR for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2
RNA by NGS in both extracted nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) RNA and native saliva
samples.

Materials and Methods
Reagents
Synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA control was sourced from TWIST Biosciences
(MN908947.3). The RT-RC-PCR kit was an accelerated R&D product developed by
NEB, incorporating Luna WarmStart reverse transcriptase and Q5 polymerase. The
SuperScript™ IV One-Step RT-PCR System from Thermo was also validated for
extracted NPS RNA. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA
Technologies. NGS reagents were purchased from Illumina and analysis was
performed on an Illumina MiSeq instrument using V2 micro flowcells.

RC-Probe sequences
RC-Probes comprised 5’-[reverse complement of desired target primer]-[universal
sequence]-3’. The universal sequence was adapted from illumina sequencing
primers published in Illumina document Document # 1000000002694 v01 (February
2016) (https://support.illumina.com/content/dam/illuminasupport/documents/documentation/chemistry_documentation/experimentdesign/illumina-adapter-sequences-1000000002694-14.pdf ). Target primer
sequences for the SARS-CoV-2 E amplicon were published by Corman et al [9] and
the target primer sequences for the RPP30 human control amplicon were published
by CDC https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/).

Universal indexing primers
Universal primers comprised 5’ -[sequencing adaptor]-[index]-[reverse complement
of universal sequence in RC-probe]-3’. The sequencing adaptors were P5 or P7
published by Illumina (Document # 1000000002694 v01 (February 2016)) and index
sequences were from the 10bp BFIDT index set [10] .

Samples
Anonymised extracted NPS samples were obtained from Salisbury Foundation NHS
Trust Virology department. The standard of care (SoC) diagnostic workflow
involved: NPS RNA extraction with the Prepito Viral DNA/RNA 300 Kit (Perkin-Elmer
CMG-2017); RT-PCR using the Bosphore Novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Detection
Kit v2 (Anatolia Geneworks ABCOW5), assaying E and ORF1AB, using the Qiagen

Rotorgene as the analysis platform. Extracted NPS samples in which SARS-CoV-2
was detected using SoC testing are here designated ‘positive controls’, and those in
which SARS-CoV-2 was not detected are designated ‘negative controls’.
Saliva samples from healthy (nonsymptomatic) anonymised controls were given in
the morning before eating or drinking. Aliquots of saliva (100μl) were placed in
screw-capped tubes, and heat-treated to 95ᵒC for 5 minutes before storage at -20ᵒC.
For the direct saliva test 5μl aliquots were assayed in exactly the same way as
extracted RNA. Cultured, UV-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 was a generous gift from Dr
Karl Staples, University of Southampton.
Principle of RT-RC-PCR
Each RT-RC-PCR reaction requires five oligonucleotides; two RC-probes (specific to
the amplicon) two universal primers (specific to the sample) and a reverse
transcription primer. Figure 1 shows the logical principle of RT-RC-PCR.
The core technology is Reverse complement PCR (RC-PCR), which is a simple,
robust method for uniquely indexing samples for downstream analysis in individual,
closed tube reactions. The reaction is analogous to a standard PCR except that
target specific primers are not provided in the reaction mix. Instead of each primer, a
system comprising two oligonucleotides, a universal indexing primer (UIP) and a
reverse complement probe (RC-probe) (Figure 1a), is used to generate fully formed
primers as the reaction proceeds (Figure 1b). The UIP includes the necessary
sequencing adaptor at the 5’ end, a sample identification sequence (10bp index
sequence) in the middle and a universal sequence at the 3’ end. Note that the
universal primer has no target binding sequence. The RC-probe comprises the
reverse complement of the desired target binding sequence for the primer at the
5’end, and the 3’ end is able to hybridise to the universal sequence of the UIP
(Figure 1b). Thus bound, the UIP can be extended, using the RC-probe as the
template, to yield fully formed, indexed primers (Figure 1c), which are then available
to amplify the template in subsequent rounds of the PCR. A single set of target
specific probes can be used to simultaneously amplify and index many thousands of
samples using an appropriate number of uniquely indexed UIPs (Figure 1d).

Combining this system with an initial reverse transcription allows direct amplification
from RNA targets and sample specific indexing in a one-step, single tube reaction.
For high capacity testing, the only subsequent processing required is product
pooling, clean-up and Illumina sequencing (Figure 1e).
RT-RC-PCR assay.
Each RT-RC-PCR, in a final volume of 20µl, included: 1x RT-PCR mix containing
reverse transcriptase and PCR polymerase; 50pM of each forward and reverse RCprobe specific to the E and RPP30 amplicons, 1nM IPs, and 5µl sample. The
reaction comprised a reverse transcription step followed by 40 cycles of PCR.
Amplification products were pooled and quantified by Qubit before clean-up, dilution
and sequencing.
Sequencing analysis
Whilst our assay is agnostic to sequencing platform, the critical parameter for any
next generation sequencing approach is the number of reads that can be generated
per given time frame. In this context Illumina sequencing provides the highest
available ‘per-run’ capacity for any current platform. Our NGS analysis was
performed using Illumina V2 Micro flowcells, using a dual indexing regime. Typically
we analysed 200-400 samples per run; this read format and scale of analysis was
purposely excessive in order to allow modelling to determine minimum read depth
requirements and read length for a robust clinical test.

Statistical analysis
The calling algorithm was developed using a training set comprising 12 independent
series of Twist synthetic RNA control diluted in RNA samples that had previously
tested negative by the SoC test (2000 to 0 genome copies /μl). Any sample with an
aggregate of less than 100 reads assigned to the E amplicon and RPP30 amplicons
combined was deemed to have failed and excluded from further analysis. All
remaining analyses in the training set were subjected to simple logistic regression
using the proportion of mapped reads that aligned to the E amplicon as the sole
parameter (i.e. E reads / E reads + RPP30 reads, see Figure 2(d)). Logistic
regression was performed using the real-statistics Excel add-in from

https://www.real-statistics.com/. Baseline probability for calling a positive was set at
0.8. Diagnostic test evaluation parameters were calculated using Medcalc
(https://www.medcalc.org/calc/diagnostic_test.php).

Results
Limit of detection
The limit of detection (LoD) was assessed using quantified synthetic SARS-CoV-2
RNA (Twist). This RNA was spiked into pooled negative control NPS samples and
used to generate dilution series from 2000 to 0 genome copies/μl. Figure 2
summarises the results of these analyses in terms of the raw read counts assigned
to the E amplicon and the RPP30 control amplicon. As expected, the E amplicon
yielded read counts proportional to the input concentration of SARS-COV-2 RNA,
whilst read count for the control remained essentially consistent across the different
concentrations. Some drop-off in RPP30 read count was observed where very high
concentrations of SARS-COV-2 RNA were present; this can be explained by
competition between the two amplicons in the diplex reaction. Table 1 shows the
qualitative detection in 12 independent dilution series using the derived calling
algorithm. Dilutions showing incomplete detection across the 12 dilution series (20
copies/μl to 2 copies/μl) were used to calculate the LoD using logistic regression.
Calculated LoD was 31.08 copies/μl.

Validation in extracted NP RNA
Clinical validation was carried out on RNA extracted from 192 NPS samples
comprising 78 positives and 114 negatives characterised by the local rRT-PCR SoC
test. Table 2 presents the results of blinded analysis performed using RT-RC-PCR
and the calling algorithm derived above. Of the 192 samples analysed, 78/78
positives called by rRT-PCR were correctly identified, two negatives were failed
because the total mapped read count was less than 100 (1% overall failure rate),
and 109/112 of the remaining negatives were correctly identified. Raw calculated
sensitivity was 95.4-100% (95% CI) and specificity was 92.4-99.4% (95% CI). These
analyses were carried out on a single Illumina V2 Micro flowcell, which represents an
allocation of approximately 20,000 reads per sample. Since available reads will

ultimately determine the feasible sample capacity per run, we performed random
sub-sampling of these data to model performance characteristics with fewer reads
available per sample. At 10 fold sub-sampling, which represents the performance
with 2,000 samples on a V2 Micro flowcell run, with an average of 2,000 reads
available per sample, the calculated performance metrics were virtually unchanged:
Sensitivity was 95.3-100% (95% CI) and specificity was 93.5-99.8% (95% CI) with an
overall failure rate of 3% (6/192).

Validation for use with saliva samples.
Significant challenges to scaled testing lie in the timely collection of samples and the
work associated with RNA extraction procedures. Initially we spiked Twist synthetic
SARS-CoV-2 RNA control into heat-treated negative saliva samples, compared with
negative NPS samples. These experiments indicated the chemistry had good
tolerance to the presence of native saliva in the reaction (Figure 3). To further
investigate the robustness of RT-RC-PCR to native saliva, we spiked UV-inactivated
SARS-CoV-2 particles (as opposed to extracted RNA) into native, untreated saliva,
negative for SARS-CoV-2. The spiked samples were then left at ambient
temperature (laboratory bench) for up to 48 hours (to simulate sample transit) before
heat-treatment at 95°C for 5 minutes (to simulate the necessary heat-inactivation of
a live sample), preparation of dilution series, and testing by RT-RC-PCR. Compared
with UV-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 spiked into water, or into saliva and assayed
immediately, 48 hours of ambient incubation caused no apparent reduction in
detection of viral amplicon (Figure 4a). By contrast, 100,000 copies of synthetic viral
RNA (Twist) spiked into native saliva yielded no detectable amplicon even when
heat-treated and assayed immediately (data not shown).
In a final test, UV-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 was spiked into native saliva, heattreated at 95°C for 5 minutes and then left at ambient temperature for 2.5 hours
before preparation of dilution series and assay by RT-RC-PCR. Compared with a
parallel dilution series assayed without delay, there was no apparent reduction in
detection of viral amplicon (Figure 4b). Overall, these data convincingly show the
robustness of RT-RC-PCR to assaying native saliva.

Detection of variants of concern
Since our assay uses sequencing of particular parts of the SARS-CoV-2 genome as
the end point measurement, we wanted to see if the assay was capable of detecting
mutations and could thus have utility in typing and identifying variants of concern
(VoC). Four sets of primers and RC-probes were designed to amplify regions
surrounding N501Y (several VoC), delH69-V70 (UK VoC), K417N /K417T (several
VoC) and E484K (several VoC).[11-14] 17 of 32 RNA samples testing positive by the
local SoC rRT-PCR were shown to harbour both the N501Y and delH69-V70
mutations present in the B.1.1.7 lineage which has emerged as a UK VoC
(https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attach
ment_data/file/959438/Technical_Briefing_VOC_SH_NJL2_SH2.pdf).

Discussion
We have developed a novel method based on RT-RC-PCR, for the qualitative
detection of SARS-CoV-2 in both extracted RNA and native saliva samples.
Validation studies, in comparison to rRT-PCR standard of care testing, show this
method to perform robustly with high sensitivity and specificity and a low limit of
detection. We have emulated a full analysis workflow using native saliva, including
incubation at ambient temperature for up to 48 hours and a heat treatment viral
inactivation step, with no apparent effect on performance. This testing format
removes the requirement for an RNA extraction step, which is desirable in terms of
cost, turn around time and availability of reagents. Interestingly, it appears the viral
inactivation step performed with raw saliva essentially eliminates detection of the
naked RNA control (Twist), but maintains detection of viral particles (UV inactivated
control material). This suggests the test, in this form, is specific for viral particles and
would not therefore detect post-infection RNA shedding, which has been noted as a
potential issue in previous studies [15-18].
RT-RC-PCR has a number of major advantages in comparison to standard testing
methodologies, making it suitable for laboratory based mass testing strategies.
Safety: The single closed tube reaction reverse transcribes RNA, amplifies cDNA
target material and applies unique sample identification sequences. This approach

simplifies the testing process and minimises as far as possible the potential for
cross-contamination. Importantly the assay also includes a multiplexed endogenous
control, providing confidence in each individual assay as opposed to batch control.
Automation: Simplicity is absolutely critical for effective high capacity automation.
Our laboratory workflow is the simplest available for massively parallel analysis
(PCR; Pool reaction products; Purify; Sequence). The core technology of RC-PCR
is clinically validated and has been used in routine diagnostics at scale in the
Wessex Genetics Service diagnostic laboratory for over 6 years.
Sample input: RT-RC-PCR functions with extracted RNA or raw saliva without
obvious loss of sensitivity. This offers an alternative to RNA extractions that often
cause bottlenecks of time and availability for testing.
Cost: List price consumable cost is approximately 2-6 GBP per sample depending
on specific setup and the sequencing platform used; with economies of scale this will
be highly competitive. The simplicity of the workflow means that manual intervention
can be minimised, keeping staffing costs low.
Supply chain: We validated two chemistry options from different suppliers. Neither
option requires reagents currently in high demand for other methods of SARS-CoV-2
detection.
Capacity for further development: Using a duel index system sequencing can be
performed on a MiSeq instrument in 5 hours. We have performed simulations using
trimmed reads and single indexing, which indicate sequencing time could be reduced
to around 3 hours. We have also demonstrated that the assay can be multiplexed
and can be further adapted to include other desirable targets without increasing the
complexity of the lab process, or significantly affecting per-sample cost of testing.
For example in the current context, amplicons could be added to allow differential
diagnostics (Flu A & B, RSV). We propose that RT-RC-PCR offers future capacity for
detection of other infectious diseases.
Speed at scale: We have only analysed small numbers of samples on Illumina V2
Micro flowcells, but we have demonstrated, through subsampling our data, that
accuracy is not compromised by allocating much fewer reads per sample.
Conservative analysis shows that 10,000 samples could be analysed on a single
Miseq V2 flowcell with no loss in sensitivity: The only constraint would be availability
of suitable index sets. Other tests may have a faster, per run, measurement phase,
but the realities of massively scaling tests in a laboratory make it largely unrealistic to

target at-scale turnaround times, from sample to reported result, in less than 24
hours, regardless of the speed of the actual test. While RT-RC-PCR is not
appropriate for point-of-care testing, it potentially adds vital capacity to populationbased testing.
Scalability: RT-RC-PCR offers the highest single run capacity available. High
scaling does not require large numbers of instruments, avoiding all the difficulties of
cost, space and logistics that attend methods using high numbers of ‘small’ runs. It is
not necessary to ‘pool’ samples pre analysis to achieve required testing throughputs.
Instrumentation: RT-RC-PCR uses well established, reliable and extant laboratory
instrumentation, including Illumina sequencers. These technologies are available in a
wide range of laboratories in both the public and private sectors.
Detection of variants at the point of diagnosis: We have demonstrated a capacity
to identify mutations in the viral genome. Currently identifying variants relies on
primary detection of positive cases, followed by reflex whole genome sequencing.
The process does not currently provide full coverage (at the time of writing
approximately 10% of positive cases were submitted for WGS) and can take many
days. With careful assay design to select appropriate VoCs and hotspots, RT-RCPCR offers the possibility identifying known and even new mutations as part of the
primary diagnostic test.
In conclusion, we have developed a novel SARS-CoV-2 test and demonstrated that
its performance is broadly equivalent to rRT-PCR. The test performs robustly on
native saliva samples and the workflow is extremely simple making it highly
amenable to automation. Moreover, it is cheap, highly scalable and multiplexable,
which offers the opportunity for more sophisticated tests. In a time when infection
rates are falling and selection pressure is being exerted on the virus through
application of vaccines, early detection of variants of concern will become
increasingly important. We believe RT-RC-PCR has potential to facilitate accurate
mass testing with concurrent detection of variants of concern.
