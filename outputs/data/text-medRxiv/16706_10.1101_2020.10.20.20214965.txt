Abstract:
To evaluate ability of modulated innate immune response to provide resistance to
development of symptomatic RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19, 96 inpatient front line health
care workers (HCW) were cohorted in 1:2 ratio to receive TLR2 agonist (heat killed
Mycobacterium w, Mw; n=32)

as innate immune response modulator or observation

(n=64). All were followed up for 100 days. The incidence of COVID-19 was 31 (32.3%) for
the entire cohort, with only one developing COVID-19 in Mw group (3.1% vs 46.8%.
protective efficacy - 93.33%, p=0.0001; 95% CI 53.3-99.1). Self-limiting local injection site
reaction was the only side effect and was seen in 14 HCW. Findings from the study suggest
the potential for providing resistance against novel pathogen like SARS-CoV-2 by
modulating innate immune response.

Introduction
Front-line healthcare workers (HCW) are at the highest risk of acquiring COVID-19 with a
30-day hazard ratio (HR) of 24.3, compared to the general community1. Innate immune
response is a conserved, prompt mechanism, which resists infections by recognizing the
conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP) of an infectious agent by
pathogen recognizing receptors (PRR) like toll like receptors (TLR). It

by novel pathogens like SARS-COV-22.

is relevant in

A TLR2 agonist, heat killed

Mycobacterium w (Mw), also known as Mycobacterium Indicus Pranii, is, an approved
immunomodulator in India3 and is used in the management of leprosy and other conditions.
In a prospective open label cohort control study, we explored the efficacy of Mw in inducing
resistance to the development of COVID-19 infection in HCW at a high risk of exposure, in a
tertiary-healthcare set-up.
Methods
Thirty-two HCWs from the Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation and
Hematology were administered 0.1 ml Mw (Sepsivac, Cadila Pharmaceuticals, India)
intradermally in each arm on day 1 of the study (Mw group) and followed up for 100 days. 64
age matched HCWs from the rest of the hospital were enrolled in a control group. All HCW
included in the study had a nasopharyngeal swab evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), on development of symptoms suggestive
of COVID-19 or following exposure to an infected person. Body temperature, pulse rate,
oxygen saturation and self-reporting of symptoms was evaluated before and after each
working day in the Mw group. ‘Exposure’ was defined as close contact with SARS-CoV-2
infected individuals without full protective gear. COVID-19 was graded as mild, moderate or
severe as per WHO criteria. Subjects in the Mw group underwent two additional random

SARS-CoV-2 specific RT-PCR evaluation 4 weeks apart. The study was approved by the
institutional ethics committee.
Results
The characteristics and outcomes of the Mw and control groups are detailed in Table 1.
Overall, 31 out of 96 HCW enrolled had RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection of which
30 (96.77%) were in control group. Of the 31, who developed COVID-19 infection, four
required hospitalization. All belonged to the control group. Despite a greater number of
exposures in the Mw group, only one out of 32 (3.13%) subjects had an RT-PCR confirmed
mild COVID-19 infection. HR for developing COVID-19 in the control group compared to
the Mw group was 19.025 (p=0.0038). Based on this study, the resistance to infection
(protective efficacy) provided by Mw was 93.33% (p=0.0001; 95% CI 53.3-99.1).
The only side effect noted with Mw was injection site reactions (moderate to severe - 4 ; mild
- 10 ), which were self-limiting and did not require any specific management.
Discussion
The study period coincided with the peak of the pandemic in New Delhi and the high rate of
COVID-19 seen in control group is in line with that reported in similar HCW1. The resistance
to COVID-19 seen in the Mw group suggests that a TLR2 agonist Mw might be useful in
providing protection to subjects at a high risk of exposure. It will be interesting to study its
long-term protective efficacy.

BCG, another approved immunomodulator is also being

evaluated for the prevention of COVID-19, and it will be interesting to study its outcome as
there are differences in the innate immune response generated by the two in terms of being a
TLR agonist and in ligand presentation4. Specific immune changes like upregulation of
adaptive natural killer cells are being investigated by our group5 to understand the immune

the concept of modulating the innate immune response for providing resistance to novel
pathogens like SARS-COV2 until the availability of vaccines.
