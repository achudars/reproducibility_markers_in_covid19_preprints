The COVID-19 toll of cases and deaths followed an uneven pattern across the world. The literature has
partly explained the observed discrepancy between the different countries by country-specific and
systemic patterns worldwide. In this study, we propose an additional explanation that the magnitude of
COVID-19 toll reported to the WHO could be influenced by the level of free speech and Democracy in
the reporting countries.

Methods:

We constructed a longitudinal dataset including the daily COVID-19 count of cases and deaths
worldwide and each country's respective score on the Freedom in the World index. We applied two
Generalized Estimating Equation models to investigate if a country's reported toll count of COVID-19
cases and deaths is related to that country's freedom level. We controlled for factors identified in the
current literature to affect the pandemic's spread.

Results:

A country's score on the Freedom In the World Index was associated with its reported COVID-19 cases
count (57028.43, 95% CI 985.3619 - 113071.5, P= 0.0461) and deaths count (3473.273, 95%
CI1217.12-5729.42, P=.002). Also, despite having almost equal shares of the world's population,
countries at the bottom category of the Freedom index reported 21% and 11% of the COVID-19 toll
cases and death counts reported by countries of highest scores on the index, respectively.

20

Conclusions:

23

The known magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic's morbidity and mortality appears to be as
transparent as the reporting countries uphold free speech and Democracy. This pattern could
potentially misguide international aid and global vaccine distribution plans.

Introduction:

26

Concurrent to the news on COVID-19 vaccines, the question has arisen on the order of priority in

27

distributing them. On the national level in the United States, the CDC was prompt to establish

28

broad vaccine distribution phases.1 On the international level, the debate is escalating on balance

29

between some countries' financial ability to secure their vaccine supplies and the needs of mid

30

and low-income countries.2 A critical, yet not fully verified, assumption basing many of the

31

involved public health and logistic considerations is that the information we have on the COVID19

32

global spread is independent and transparent enough to be an accurate representation of its real

33

impact. In this research, we examined the validity of this assumption on the global level.

34

Since the beginning of the epidemic, multiple factors cast doubt on the COVID-19 toll calculations'

35

accuracy in different countries. There was a lack of consistency in selecting high-risk population

36

groups that some countries initially monitored for COVID-19.3 Government authorities

37

worldwide used various combinations of clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory confirmation

38

requirements to determine which cases constitute COVID-19 cases as the primary ailment.4 The

39

types, availability, and accuracy of the testing kits used in screening for COVID-19 varied

40

worldwide at different time points. Eventually, most countries used various diagnostic tools of

41

different sensitivities though not all countries could always have enough testing kits.

42

Manufacturing limitations sometimes added to the uncertainty on some of the available kits.5

43

Despite these considerable differences between the individual countries, there have been

44

observable systematic patterns in the COVID-19 impact numbers on the national and

45

international levels, revealing socio-economic challenges for minorities and disadvantaged

46

populations. For example, in the US, minority populations were disproportionately impacted by

47

the COVID-19 epidemic, prompting questions on the health equity considerations and barriers to

48

care.6 At the global level, other systemic patterns appeared in the COVID-19 toll of cases and

49

deaths, such as the seemingly paradoxical observation that the epidemic could be spreading at

50

higher rates in developed and prosperous countries than others of weaker health care

51

infrastructure.7

52

Another observation, which the current literature has not fully explained yet, is the discrepancy

53

between countries in their counts of COVID-19 cases and deaths.8 The full explanation of this

54

observation could reveal what makes a country more vulnerable to COVID-19 and which

55

countries are the hotspots of the epidemic and logistic priorities in vaccine distribution.9 The

56

literature has proposed factors of weather, location, health care infrastructure, aging population,

57

and others. These explanations could only partly decipher the epidemic's spread pattern.

58

this study, we proposed an additional explanation that identifies a potential barrier to equitable

59

channeling of support, including vaccines, to genuine need populations. Our research hypothesis

60

is that the magnitude of a country's reported toll of COVID-19 cases and deaths could be under

61

the influence of the degrees of Freedom of speech and Democracy that country embraces. The

62

less a government upholds these governance elements, the lower impact it could be reporting

63

about the epidemic in its people. The premises of this hypothesis are the inconsistent spread of

64

COVID-19 across the globe without a full explanation, multiple media reports on governments

65

considering independent reporting on COVID-19 as misinformation, and studies from

66

independent research institutions highlighting a step up in governmental control and a decline in

67

Democracy in around the world during the pandemic. 11,12,13,14

68

On top of misguiding scientific efforts, this possibility would likely create a barrier to equitable

69

access to the COVID-19 vaccines. The perceived low impact of the epidemic in some countries

70

could mislead the distribution efforts championed by the international organizations and the

71

vaccine manufacturers into deprioritizing sending vaccine aid to these populations, contrary to

72

their actual need.

73

To investigate this hypothesis, we conducted this longitudinal analysis of the potential

74

relationship between the toll of cases and deaths reported by the world countries and their

75

respective scores on the Freedom In the World Index, recognized in the politico-economic

76

literature as a measure of Democracy and Free speech around the globe.

78

The observation unit was daily country. We collected records of confirmed COVID-19 impact

79

reported to the WHO from world countries. Our study dataset tracked 182 countries over 242

80

days from January 23, 2020, to September 20, 2020.

81

Outcome of Interest:

82

We examined the cumulative daily counts of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths from the

83

COVID-19 dashboard provided by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns

84

Hopkins University. This online repository hosts data on COVID-19 deaths and cases worldwide,

85

collected from official and independent sources.

86

Predictor variable:

87

We used Freedom In the World Index (2020) to represent Democracy and Free speech in the

88

world countries13. This annual index is developed by the US-based independent research

89

institution Freedom House (US). The index is a composite score on a scale from one to a hundred,

90

aggregating each country's sub-scores on a wide array of surveyed measures of Democracy such

91

as political pluralism, Freedom of expression, the rule of law, and individual rights. Each country

92

is also designated a Freedom In the World status (Free, Partly Free, or Not Free) based on its

93

respective aggregate scores on Political Rights and Civil Liberties.15

94

Covariates:

95

We added control variables representing the different factors hypothesized in the current

96

literature to influence the spread of COVID-19. The model included fixed effects for daily

97

temperature and ultraviolet index levels, sourced from WeatherStack data repository, which

98

collects worldwide weather data from stations worldwide.16 Additionally, we added fixed effects

99

of worldwide enactment of containment measures and public health policies, represented by

100

daily records in Government Stringency Index developed by Oxford University s.17

101

We also added fixed effects for pollution levels (in mean annual exposure in micrograms per cubic

102

meter, 2017),18 population density (2019), and wealth (in the 2019 gross domestic product in

103

PPP). We obtained this information from the World Bank Databank. Finally, we used the Health

104

Access and Quality Index (2016), which scores the accessibility of health care services in the

105

different countries, as a proxy of the accessibility to care during the COVID-19 epidemic.

106

Methods:

107

We estimated the relationship between the countries' scores on the Freedom In the World index

108

and their reported cumulative count of COVID-19 cases and deaths, using a Generalized

109

Estimating Equation (GEE) model with an independent correlation structure. The model included

110

the aforementioned covariates believed, in the consensus of literature in multiple scientific

111

disciplines, to influence the global spread of COVID-19. We used SAS 9.4 TS Level 1 M6 to conduct

112

the statistical analysis and impute the missing data. Although multiple imputations is not a

113

required step for GEE models, for being population-based models, the consensus in Biostatistics

114

literature is that imputing the missing data improves the adequacy of the GEE parameter

115

estimates.

116

Results:

117

Descriptive statistics:

118

In the Free category, the highest scores on the Freedom In the World Index, there are 72

119

countries. This category collectively hosts 38.28% of the world population and reported 72.37%

120

of the world's COVID-19 caseload and 78.77% of the world's COVID-19 related deaths. Countries

121

in this category produced 56.56% of the world's 2019 GDP in PPP and had an average score of

122

76.94 on the Health Access and Quality index. (Figure 1)

123

In the Not Free category, the lowest scores category, there are 48 countries. They collectively

124

host 36.3% of the world population and accounted for 15% of the total world COVID-19 cases

125

and 8.7% of the total deaths. These countries produced 29.66% of the world GDP in PPP and had

126

an average score of 51.81 on the Health Access and Quality index. (Figure 1)

127

Inferential statistics:

128

There was a statistically significant positive association between a country's score on the

129

Freedom In the World Index and the cumulative count of cases that the government reported.

130

For every point decrease on the index, the average country reported 57028 less cumulative

131

COVID-19 cases, and vice versa (57028.43, 95% CI 985.3619 - 113071.5, P= 0.0461). There was

132

also a statistically significant positive association between a country's score on the index and the

133

cumulative count of deaths it reported. For every point decrease on the index, the respective

134

country reported 3473.27 less COVID-19 deaths, cumulative, over the study period (3473.273, 95%

135

CI1217.12-5729.42, P=.002). (Figure 2)

136

Discussion:

137

The results suggest a relationship between the COVID-19 toll reported to the World Health

138

Organization from the different countries and the respective countries' levels of Freedom. The

139

less a country embraced Democracy and Free speech, the lower the magnitude of the COVID-19

140

morbidity and mortality it reported to the world about its people. Countries in the Not Free

141

category reported shares of global COVID-19 cases and deaths were 21% and 11% of the counts

142

reported by the Free category, respectively, despite that the two categories have almost equal

143

shares of the world population. Paradoxically, the Not Free category had poorer economy and

144

weaker health care infrastructure, in terms of access and quality, than the Free category. This

145

discrepancy is independent of the factors believed to influence the pandemic's spread, such as

146

access to health care, containment measures and public health policies, weather conditions,

147

pollution, demographic characteristics, or wealth.

148

These findings cast doubt on the validity of the assumption that the observed toll of COVID-19

149

morbidity and mortality counts is transparent enough to represent the reality of the epidemic's

150

impact accurately. Without a valid representation of the COVID-19 reality, scientific efforts could

151

investigate inaccurate findings and drive unreliable conclusions, leading to a misallocation of

152

global aid resources.

153

For example, the currently available information led some research efforts to investigate a

154

perceived observation that the pandemic has not affected low-income countries as it did with

155

high-income countries. One explanation was that rich countries could afford broader screening

156

efforts, which will ultimately detect a higher number of cases than other countries. Yet, this

6

157

study's findings could propose an entirely different explanation considering that many low-

158

income countries also have low embracement of Democracy.

159

Another example is the apparent association between colder temperatures and the spread of the

160

virus, which led some to believe that the summer would restrain the epidemic early in the

161

epidemic's timeline.19 Some researchers suggest that this misperception probably deterred the

162

COVID-19 response in the summer of 2020 by encouraging complacency in following social

163

distancing measures, at least in part.20 Yet, in the light of the findings in this study, we could

164

consider the possibility that the low COVID-19 impact in hot countries in areas like Africa could

165

be partially coming from a lack of Freedom of speech and low Democracy.

166

In future consideration, the perceived impact of the epidemic could be a key element in allocating

167

international aid and vaccine quotas to developing countries. Considering the findings, the

168

international organizations and vaccine manufacturers will likely deprioritize aid to some

169

countries based on their low toll of COVID-19 cases and deaths, which could be, at least in part,

170

because of a lack of transparency in reporting the reality of the COVID-19 situation in them. This

171

role of lack of Democracy as a barrier against access to care could be a new socio-economic

172

determinant of health care in the COVID-19 epidemic. Further research could help bridge this

173

barrier by considering various cultural and socio-economic factors that could influence a

174

country's government ability and willingness to help the international community get a realistic

175

understanding of the epidemic. While such scientific inquiry goes beyond this study's scope, this

176

study's findings could be a useful starting point for decision-makers and members of the research

177

community working to promote equitable access to the global pool of therapeutic and preventive

178

aid resources.

179

Limitations:

180

This study has several limitations. First, the inconsistencies between the standards that different

181

countries have followed to varying points of time in the study period could introduce inaccuracies

182

in the COVID-19 toll count of cases and deaths used in the analysis. Second, we did not obtain

183

information on the availability of COVID-19 testing in different countries, which might shape the

184

observed spread pattern. Third, the weather information used in the analysis is on each country's

185

political capital, which might not be fully representative of the weather in all that country's

186

regions. Fourth, the study's analysis does not divulge the causality considerations underlying the

187

findings, which could be an area for further research.
