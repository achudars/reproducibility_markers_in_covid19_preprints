Abstract

54

The UK Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) emphasises the need for high levels of

55

engagement with communities and individuals to ensure the effectiveness of any COVID-19 testing

56

programme. A novel pilot health surveillance programme to assess the feasibility of weekly mass

57

RT-LAMP testing for the SARS-CoV-2 virus using saliva samples collected at home was

58

developed and piloted by the University of Southampton and Southampton City Council. Rapid

59

qualitative evaluation was conducted to explore experiences of those who took part in the

60

programme, of those who declined and of those in the educational and healthcare organisations

61

involved in the pilot testing who were responsible for roll-out. This included 77 interviews and 20

62

focus groups with 223 staff, students, pupils and household members from four schools, one

63

university, and one community healthcare NHS trust. Conversations revealed that high levels of

64

communication, trust and convenience were necessary to ensure people’s engagement with the

65

programme. This suggests community leaders and stakeholder organisations should be involved

66

throughout programme development and implementation to optimise these features of the testing.

67

Participants’ and stakeholders’ motivations, challenges and concerns need to be understood and

68

these insights used to modify the programme in a continuous, real-time process to ensure and

69

sustain engagement with testing over the extended period necessary.

Introduction

71

Universal, repeated, weekly testing followed by strict household isolation after a positive test and

72

continued normal life after a negative test, has been promoted in the UK as an important exit

73

strategy from the current COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic.(1) A novel pilot programme to

74

assess the feasibility of weekly mass RT-LAMP testing(2,3) for the SARS-CoV-2 virus using saliva

75

samples collected at home was developed and piloted in a unique partnership (the Southampton

76

COVID-19 Saliva Testing Programme) between Southampton City Council and the University of

77

Southampton. Between June and October 2020, participants from two general practices in

78

Southampton, staff and students at the University of Southampton and staff and pupils from one

79

infant, one junior, one primary and one secondary school in the city were invited to participate in

80

two phases of a pilot of the Southampton COVID-19 Saliva Testing Programme. The four schools

81

had catchment areas in more deprived parts of the city, and the pupils were from diverse ethnic

82

backgrounds. More than a quarter of students at the University of Southampton come from outside

83

the UK. Interactive engagement activities took place alongside the testing programme to maximise

84

uptake of saliva testing, with extensive development and deployment of educational materials

85

targeting different age groups of students and pupils in the schools, alongside work to engage

86

university students.

87

The UK Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) emphasises the need for high levels of

88

engagement with communities and individuals in the creation of successful mass testing

89

programmes.(4) High levels of engagement with the community builds trust, shared goals, and a

90

sense of fairness;(5, 6) engagement also bridges cultural and language gaps.(7) A rapid review of the

91

role of community engagement in the response to COVID-19 found that local community leaders

92

and stakeholders took on important programme functions, including designing and planning,

93

building trust, negotiating community entry and behaviour change and risk communication.(8)

94

Rapid qualitative evaluation can be used when the public sector requires immediate feedback on

95

programme process and impacts in order to shape policy.(9) Hence, this type of approach lends itself

96

to providing insights into the response to public health recommendations and programmes during

97

the COVID-19 pandemic. Data generated describing people’s lived experiences of the infection,

98

their behaviour and responses to the government efforts to contain the virus have complemented

99

and explained the epidemiological data.(10) Other studies involving rapid qualitative methods

100

during the pandemic have provided ‘real-time’ feedback on current public health practices(11) and

101

have informed the design of the UK’s COVID-19 response.(12) This approach was established to

102

inform iterative development and testing of programmes and interventions and has been shown to

103

produce findings comparable to those of more traditional qualitative research and thematic

104

analysis.(13, 14)

105

To generate insights and inform the design and modification of the Southampton COVID-19 Saliva

106

Testing Programme, we conducted a rapid qualitative evaluation exploring the experiences of

107

individuals and organisations who took part and of those individuals who declined to take part to

108

inform the development of the next phase of the programme for mass-testing.

109

The rapid qualitative evaluation

110

Between 4th June and 7th November 2020, we conducted 77 interviews and 20 focus groups with

111

223 staff, pupils, students and household members, from four schools, one university, and two GP

112

practices belonging to one Clinical Commissioning Group in the city of Southampton in the South-

113

East of England. Three groups of participants took part in interviews and focus groups: i)

114

individuals who had been approached about taking part in the pilot Saliva Testing Programme

115

including some who tested positive; ii) those who were approached but declined to take part; and

116

iii) senior university, primary care and school representatives responsible for delivering the Saliva

117

Testing Programme in their organisations. The majority of participants in this qualitative study were

118

recruited via the testing programme’s online registration process, a feedback form on the

119

Southampton City Council website, during a phone call with the testing programme team to those

120

who tested positive or inconclusive, or through the schools’ weekly newsletters about the

121

programme. Senior university and school representatives and a minority of other participants were

122

recruited through the testing team’s and participants’ professional networks. Participants gave

123

permission for their contact details to be shared with the qualitative evaluation team and were

124

offered a small financial incentive to take part. Participants aged under 18 years and their parents

125

signed consent forms. Participants’ characteristics are outlined in Table 1.

126

Focus groups were conducted using Zoom Pro and audio-recorded using Open Broadcast Software;

127

telephone interviews were recorded using Olympus recorders and a microphone earpiece.

128

Participants gave verbal consent for discussions to be recorded at the start of each interview and

129

focus group. Focus groups and interviews were conducted using semi-structured discussion guides

130

developed by experienced qualitative researchers informed by the needs of the programme team and

131

revised iteratively in the light of insights gained. Findings from the focus groups and interviews

132

were synthesised rapidly and added to a report, which was edited collectively by the evaluation

133

team and continuously updated as new data and insights were generated. This report was used to

134

provide immediate feedback to the programme team enabling them to make modifications to the

135

running of the programme, and to offer insights to other groups in the UK developing similar

136

testing programmes. At the end of the pilot phases of the programme, rapid analysis of the material

137

gathered in the shared report was conducted using a framework of themes which addressed three

138

questions:(15) (i) what made people engage with the testing programme?; (ii) how could engagement

139

with the testing programme be improved?; and (iii) what were the impacts on participants of

140

engaging with the testing programme? Notes taken during the focus groups and interviews guided

141

the selection of quotes which were transcribed directly from the audio-recordings.(11, 16, 17) Direct

142

quotes from participants illustrating the range of responses as they relate to the three questions are

143

1. What made people engage with the testing programme?

149

Communication Participants emphasised the need for open and transparent communication from

150

programme implementers of the reasons they should register for the programme, how to go about

151

registering and why they should stay registered. They felt these communications should be

152

motivating in content. To do this, they needed to address participants’ sense of community and

153

make clear how easy and convenient the testing regime was for both those who took part and for

154

those who were managing the programmes within their organisations. Parents, school pupils and

155

staff described finding open communication with the programme team reassuring and therefore

156

motivating. This open communication was led by senior representatives of the organisations taking

157

part, who also emphasised preparation, leadership buy in and using data management systems to

158

scale up as important to the success of the programme within their organisations. Transparent

159

information sharing between the testing team, participants, local and national stakeholders was seen

160

as a strength by programme implementers. Programme communications were also translated into

161

seven languages in Phase II to increase uptake by minority ethnic groups, seen by participants as

162

another strength.

163

Community Participants’ decisions to take part and engage in the programme were, they felt,

164

influenced by a pull on their sense of community. Participants from schools and GP surgeries felt

165

this pull more strongly than participants from the University. The schools and GP surgeries were

166

smaller, more cohesive organisations, where staff and pupils saw one another every day, spoke

167

about the saliva testing frequently and encouraged one another to take part. This was less evident in

168

the University. Automatic registration of all school students may also have normalised participation

169

in the testing programme, where university students had to make the decision to register as

170

individuals. University students suggested that taking part in the testing programme could be

171

normalised by employing testing champions in their halls and courses to promote the programme

172

and by using an ‘opt-out’ process for participation. School pupils and university students were

173

offered interactive educational activities being run to increase engagement with the testing

174

programme. Those who took part in these activities reported understanding more about the science

175

involved in managing the pandemic, which they felt increased their motivation to protect their

176

communities. Senior school and university representatives appreciated the role that the programme

177

played in connecting senior community stakeholders across Southampton in a way that had not been

178

evident before. Finding common cause through using the Saliva Testing Programme was seen as an

179

unexpected benefit from their involvement.

180

Convenience Most participants found the programme procedures easy and convenient; registration

181

processes were simple, drop off points were accessible, testing instructions were clear. It perceived

182

to be easier to carry out than nasopharyngeal PCR swab tests and test results were received quickly.

183

They felt that making participation as convenient and easy as possible was key to increasing uptake.

184

Parents reported that the test was simple enough for children to take responsibility for carrying out

185

tests independently. From the perspective of the organisations, initial engagement was motivated by

186

the cost-effectiveness of the programme and the value of having data on infection to manage

outbreak hotspots by integrating programme data with data from symptomatic PCR testing, to keep

188

the schools, the university and GP practices running.

189
190

2. How could engagement with the testing programme be improved?

191

Building trust A major reason some chose not to take part in the programme was that they did not

192

trust the Government with their data. Many of those who declined to take part in the Saliva Testing

193

Programme were anxious about the possibility of losing control of their data when the programme

194

passed them to NHS Test and Trace in the event of a positive test. The local NHS Foundation Trust

195

and its partnership with the University and Southampton City Council, however, was trusted; it was

196

seen to have scientific integrity, and as a local organisation, was felt to be answerable to the

197

Southampton community in a way NHS Test and Trace was not. Some suggested that they would

198

have been more likely to take part if the programme was run solely by local organisations.

199

Participants and decliners were clear that building trust was necessary to improve engagement in the

200

programme. They suggested that this would be helped by receiving more directed information from

201

credible sources such as the university and Southampton City Council about the rationale for and

202

design of the programme, about data protection and the accuracy of the tests, and about the progress

203

of the programme. This information would increase transparency and help dispel myths, particularly

204

about the accuracy of the saliva test. One reason some people declined to take part in the

205

programme was a concern about the personal consequences of a false-positive result.

206

Extra support for testing positive Those who had experienced a positive test result asked for more

207

efficient data management by the testing programme, NHS Test and Trace and their general

208

practice, and more coordinated messaging. Participants requested more personalised support for

209

those testing positive and having therefore to self-isolate. This included financial aid if unable to

210

work, receiving food and medication supplies and mental health support. Some felt, however, that

211

there were too many support calls from NHS Test and Trace for those testing positive. Participants

212

were particularly worried about the possibility of spreading the virus to others whilst they waited

213

for a test result, and feared the stigma of testing positive, which suggests that they would need

214

reassurance and social support in dealing with a positive test result. Fear of a positive test result was

215

enough to make some decline to take part; they were concerned that if they had to isolate they

216

would lose income, their employer would be unsympathetic and that a history of infection with the

217

virus might affect their ability to get a mortgage and life-insurance. These people preferred not to

218

know their viral status.

219

Increasing accessibility Both decliners and participants recommended making the programme

220

more inclusive and accessible to a wider group of those eligible to take part. Drop-off points for

221

saliva samples that catered for people living outside Southampton and more frequent, convenient

222

and better sign-posted drop-off points within Southampton would have reduced the distances people

223

had to travel. Some suggested postal deliveries and returns. Comprehensive translation of all

224

programme communications would have increased uptake and engagement of those from minority

225

ethnic communities.

226

Practical improvements Many improvements suggested by participants were incorporated into the

227

programme as it evolved (see Box 1). A small minority of participants, especially parents of

228

younger children, had issues producing enough saliva, which may have produced an inconclusive

229

result. They suggested the tubes be marked with a clear indicator of the amount necessary. Some

230

decliners missed the University registration email and recommended putting key information

231

highlighted at the top of emails. Senior representatives of organisations involved were clear that the

232

programme gave their staff added responsibilities and added to their workload. Whilst accepting

233

that this extra work was in a good cause, some suggested a ‘toolkit’ of instructions and tips for

234

those implementing the programme to help manage the expectations of both staff and participants.

235
236

3. What were the broader consequences for participants of engaging with the testing

237

programme?

238

Participants reflected on the positive and negative impacts of participating in the testing

239

programme. Positive outcomes included:

240

Reassurance They generally felt reassured by knowing their viral status and expressed a sense of

241

relief and reduced feelings of anxiety when they tested negative. They appreciated knowing they

242

were not spreading the virus, felt that this enabled a “near normal” life to continue and were more

243

confident going to school or work and visiting vulnerable family and friends. This was perceived to

244

be an incentive for taking part in the programme.

245

Pride Participants expressed pride in knowing that they were contributing to a programme that was

246

part of the national effort to manage the pandemic. Some viewed this as a privilege and others were

247

excited. Southampton university students spoke of being envied by those from other universities

248

and felt that the testing programme made the university attractive to prospective students. Senior

249

university representatives spoke of the reputational benefit to the organisation of having provided a

250

testing programme for the local community.

251
252

Participants expressed a number of concerns:

253

Environmental impact Some were concerned about the amount of plastic in testing kits and the

254

environmental impact of an expansion of the testing programme.

255

Increased chance of infection Concern was expressed about the potential of those who received a

256

negative test result to become less vigilant in applying social-distancing and hygiene measures.

257

They were also worried that the test kit drop-off points were sites of potential infection; prior Health

258

and Safety risk assessments had however ensured that these carried no or minimal risk.

259

Feelings of anxiety Participants reported feelings of anxiety whilst waiting for their test results,

260

worrying about the personal consequences of having to self-isolate or of having unknowingly

261

passed the virus on to others whilst awaiting their test result. Others were anxious about the

262

possibility of the testing programme ending.

263

Cultural barriers Some participants were concerned that aspects of culture were a barrier to

264

participation. These included language barriers and a cultural mistrust in central government. Those

265

who had lived in countries where governments were believed to misuse personal data were more

266

anxious about taking part in the Saliva Testing Programme because of the perceived threat to their

267

privacy. Those who needed the testing programme most may in this way have been prevented from

268

taking part.

been like ‘I have some glitches and stuff, I have, you know, or I’m
late to deliver’.... I didn’t actually see the message on my phone
[test result], it was more that I heard that other people had
received their message on their phone.... we have that WhatsApp
group and people are quite active on that. ID03 GP staff,
Interview
When they [the children] had all the activities, they absolutely
loved that and [it] helped them to understand a lot better what’s
going on around them. They loved the story, the mask, the glitter
and [it] made them understand what’s actually going on. ID46
School staff, Focus Group
Convenience
It’s quite easy. The instructions were really clear, so I
understood it. ID54 Parent & Child, Interview
It’s good that you can just walk up to campus and drop it off, and
you know very quickly what the result is. ID72 University

Building trust

People are a little bit wary that samples of their saliva, their
nose cells, their cheek swabs are being kept. ID83 University
student, Interview
I wouldn’t want to share any data with Test and Trace at all.
ID10 Decliner, Interview
Extra support for
I think my primary concern would be, obviously everyone I’ve
testing positive
come into contact with and then also income... a lot of student
work is casual and obviously I can’t be furloughed and sickpay isn’t the best with casual contracts. ID63 University
students, Focus Group
They [NHS Test and Trace] were ringing, you know, nearly
every single day, saying you need to stay home. Constantly
ringing, constantly, literally. ID68_School parent, Interview
(Child with Positive result)
Increasing
If they live a little bit further out they’d have to take public
accessibility
transport to get to campus which is obviously putting themselves
and others at risk … to drop off. ID80 University students, Focus
Group
Practical
With the labelling I did just double check it as I wasn’t sure
improvements
whether to stick the label over the existing label on the pot, or
write it on in pen. ID44 University students, Focus Group
The only not so successful bit for us was my three year old really
struggled to provide enough [saliva] so unfortunately we
couldn’t get him part of the testing programme but that was more
the logistics of getting a three year old to spit. ID43 University
students & staff, Focus Group
But it’s been a case of collating the packs for staff, you know,
using our time to do that. Creating emails for internal staff to
say actually we are going to summarise the booklet … it’s been a
bit time heavy. ID09 GP representative, Interview
3. What were the impacts on participants of engaging with the screening
programme?
Reassurance
My partner’s grandparents live quite close by. Being able to do
the test and know that we didn’t have it on the day that we then
went to see them and could give them a hug, was an amazing
thing. ID15 University staff, Interview
It is a huge reassurance. This empowered parents to be able to
make decisions about whether to send their child to school. This
head teacher has volunteered to advise other schools
entering the programme to iterate how amazing this programme
is in keeping communities safe, and ensuring the continuity of
education. ID92 Senior school representative, Interview
Pride
I thought it [the testing programme] was a good idea and it’s an
honour to be part of a test trial for what could help the
world. ID49 School pupil, Focus Group

Environmental impact

Increased chance of
infection

Feelings of anxiety

Cultural beliefs

We’re really grateful for being involved and it’s been a real
privilege. I had a conversation with [member of staff] this
morning and again they thanked me for organising it. ID90
Senior school representative, Interview
It’s given an example to the local community of the benefit of
having research-intensive, quality university on their doorstep.
You can imagine ‘what's the university ever done for us?’... The
University has received letters particularly from schools that are
a part of Phase II, just saying how much they welcome the role
the University has played in making them feel safer. ID94 Senior
University representative, Interview
The other thing that came back from my team that they thought
about was the amount of plastic that was part of the pack and no
way really to recycle it. Using quite a lot of plastic as part of the
process was one of the not so positive things I think. ID43
University students & staff, Focus Group
You have got to actually touch a receptacle to put the bags in [at
the drop-off point] and there was no gel or wipes or anything
close by and they [friend] were a bit panicky and had to use their
own stuff. ID47 University students & staff Focus Group
I would panic if I tested positive because I have asthma… With
all the [reports] I hear, I would be intubated. I would die. That
would be the end of my life. ID43 University students & staff,
Focus Group
There is language barrier at our school as well. … Yesterday we
were on the verge of finishing this lovely programme, we got the
translation letters. … We’ve got Urdu, Pashto, Romanian,
Somali, Polish, Bengali, so we have these six translations. I think
that will make a difference for next week and increase the uptake
of the programme. ID46 School staff, Focus Group
In, especially Hong Kong right now its quite scary. If you have
the saliva test or swab test right now the testing company or the
government might get your DNA. Some of my friends are quite
concerned about this part but because I just had to explain to
them that the UK is different, they treat privacy very seriously. I
try to tell them and reassure them but they are quite worried
because in Hong Kong they are scared about the DNA or that the
samples are being sent to China. … But the UK might still have
possibility to have accidental leaks if there are like other
situations from airline companies, they have glitches in the
system, some privacy just leaked out. …. Some freshers coming
in this year, they are quite worried about the situation as it’s
been a long-standing issue there. ID48 University students &
staff, Focus Group

Conclusions

272

Individual participants and organisational representatives provided valuable insights into the

273

experience of engaging with the Southampton COVID-19 Saliva Testing Programme, leading to

274

changes in programme processes and communications, which undoubtedly increased engagement

275

and adherence to programme requirements. They also made important observations about the

276

benefits they experienced from engaging with the testing programme, some of which they suggested

277

should be emphasised to potential participants by those currently establishing testing programmes.

278

One of these benefits was increased knowledge about the science behind management of the

279

pandemic that school and university students gained from the educational engagement activities. As

280

well as providing insights, it was clear from the focus groups and interviews that the process of

281

seeking feedback from participants also increased the engagement of local people with the testing

282

programme.

283

Involving local people and organisations in the development and piloting of programmes in this

284

way may well have been important in ensuring community buy-in.(18) They appreciated the chance

285

to contribute to this programme, which they saw to be of national importance. The process of

286

holding the conversations reported in this paper may also have helped to address two key

287

underlying issues affecting engagement with the testing programme: the need for trust between

288

participants and testing programmes, and the role of ‘collective efficacy’ within organisations.

289

Local organisations, such as schools and the university were seen to be answerable to local people

290

and hence more trustworthy than more national ‘faceless’ and private organisations such as NHS

291

Test and Trace. Collective efficacy is a group's shared belief in its capability to organise and

292

execute actions required to achieve goals,(19) and a sense of collective efficacy appeared to be

293

stronger in the smaller, more cohesive organisations such as the schools and GP practices than in

294

the University, for example. Schools and GP practices had staff and student communities within

295

which members through daily conversation and mutual encouragement made regular testing the

296

‘social norm’. The educational engagement activities appeared to play an important role in this too.

297

Students’ increased knowledge appeared to make them more engaged with the programme and

298

motivated by the need to protect their communities, as well as making them feel like they had more

299

agency in controlling the spread of the virus and its damaging consequences. Schools and the

300

university were thus building collective efficacy for regular testing.

301

A rapid qualitative evaluation enabled real-time feedback of insights into the testing programme,

302

improving the participants’ experience and was therefore likely to increase uptake of testing.

303

Insights gained were also used to inform university, schools, and city-wide strategies for managing

304

the pandemic and to feed-back to national and local government.(20) Figure 1 illustrates the way in

305

which the rapid qualitative evaluation influenced Saliva Testing Programme development and wider

306

testing strategy and Box 1 details the modifications made to the programme based on feedback

307

gathered through the interviews and focus group discussions. This study has also produced

308

actionable recommendations for improving engagement with COVID-19 testing programmes across

309

the UK. See Box 2 for details of these recommendations.

310

Strengths and limitations

311

The speed with which insights were needed to optimise the testing programme meant that a full and

312

rigorous traditional qualitative analysis of the data was not possible. Steps taken to ensure that our

313

findings were robust included regular team meetings to discuss interpretations, checking these

314

interpretations with participants in focus groups and interviews and consultation with experts from a

315

wide range of backgrounds. These steps are part of an established process for conducting rapid

316

qualitative evaluation.(11-17) Accessing those who declined to take part in the programme was

317

challenging, but those who were consulted offered important insights that informed significant

318

programme development. Future evaluations of testing programmes should explore participants’

319

experiences of indirect NHS Test and Trace contact tracing and household isolation as these are key

320

components of the effectiveness of population testing.

Resolved initial technical hurdles in the registration process and moved towards a more
robust yet simple registration process in Phase II to reduce the barriers of registering;
Created clear and simple instructions, which were translated into seven languages, to
reduce the number of inconclusive saliva test results;
Designed smaller labels to stick to the test pots to reduce the number of people placing
them incorrectly and increasing the risk of receiving an inconclusive result;
Testing team communicated the test’s accuracy and the progress of the programme in a
weekly newsletter to schools and through emails to university staff and students;
Educational engagement activities were offered to university students to increase their
involvement in the programme;
Commitment has been made to reduce the amount of plastic and to recycle containers
in the next phase of the programme;
Post-boxes rather than team members placed at sample drop-off points to reduce
possibility of transmission;
Increased number of drop-off points in Southampton to reduce the travel time for
participants submitting their tests;
‘Toolkit’ created for programme implementers to support preparation and roll-out for
the next phase of the programme.

Box 2: Recommendations from the Southampton Saliva Testing Programme to ensure
mass engagement in testing for COVID-19
1. Testing should be delivered through local organisations to both increase trust in the
testing programme but also to promote collective efficacy;
2. Communications about testing should be clear, consistent and appeal to individual’s
sense of community and altruism to motivate people to take part in the programme;
3. Creative and fun educational activities should be used to improve knowledge and
understanding of the virus, so increasing motivation to protect each other and sense
of agency in managing consequences of the pandemic;
4. Participants and local organisers should be involved in designing their programme, and
should be engaged in providing continuous feedback on the testing experience to
enable real-time programme modifications;
5. Local organisations involved in delivering testing should be enabled to connect with
one another to share best practice and create a local testing culture;
6. Those testing positive should be supported financially, psychologically, with food and
medication and provided with reassurance and advice about how to minimise the
possibility of transmission of infection to others;
7. Testing should be made as convenient for participants as possible and all
communications need to be in multiple languages as well as appropriate for children
and young people;
8. Thought needs to be given to making testing kits and processes as environmentally
sustainable as possible.
