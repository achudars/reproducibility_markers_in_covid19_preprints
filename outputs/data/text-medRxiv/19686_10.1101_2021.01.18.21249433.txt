Abstract

37
38

Objectives – To define the burden of nosocomial (hospital-acquired) novel pandemic coronavirus
(covid-19) infection among adults hospitalised across Wales.

39
40
41
42

Design - Retrospective observational study of adult patients with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between 1st March – 1st July 2020 with a recorded hospital admission
within the subsequent 31 days. Outcomes were collected up to 20th November using a standardised
online data collection tool.

43

Setting – Service evaluation performed across 18 secondary or tertiary care hospitals.

44
45
46

Participants - 4112 admissions with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR result between 1st March to 1st July
2020 were screened. Anonymised data from 2518 participants were returned, representing over 60% of
adults hospitalised across the nation of Wales.

47
48

Main outcome measures - The prevalence and outcomes (death, discharge) for nosocomial covid-19,
assessed across of a range of possible case definitions.

49
50
51
52
53

Results - Inpatient mortality rates for nosocomial covid-19 ranged from 38% to 42% and remained
consistently higher than participants with community-acquired infection (31% to 35%) across a range
of case definitions. Participants with nosocomial-acquired infection were an older, frailer, and multimorbid population than those with community-acquired infection. Based on the Public Health Wales
case definition, 50% of participants had been admitted for 30 days prior to diagnostic testing.

54
55
56
57
58

Conclusions - This represents the largest assessment of clinical outcomes for patients with nosocomial
covid-19 in the UK to date. These findings suggest that inpatient mortality rates from nosocomialinfection are likely higher than previously reported, emphasizing the importance of infection control
measures, and supports prioritisation of vaccination for covid-19 negative admissions and trials of postexposure prophylaxis in inpatient cohorts.

59
60

Trial registration – This project was approved and sponsored by the Welsh Government, as part of a
national audit and quality improvement scheme for patients hospitalised covid-19 across Wales.

We searched PubMed and ISI Web of Science up until 31-December-2020 for studies reporting on
patient outcomes following hospital-acquired infection due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We identified a range of case-definitions for hospital-acquired infection,
based on timing of diagnostic testing 5 to 15 days following admission. The largest and only multicentre study concluded individuals with nosocomial infection are at a lower risk of death from SARSCoV-2 than those infected in the community, however, was performed early in the pandemic and
utilised a conservative definition of nosocomial infection.

Our multi-centre observational study represents the largest assessment of clinical outcomes for patients
with nosocomial covid-19 in the UK to date, and suggests the burden of nosocomial SARS-CoV-2
infection has been underestimated. Nosocomial-infection occurred in older, frailer, and multi-morbid
individuals, and was consistently associated with greater inpatient mortality than amongst those who
were infected in the community across a spectrum of case-definitions. Our findings support
implementation of enhanced infection control measures to reduce this burden during future waves,
especially given the recent emergence of novel viral variants with enhanced transmissibility.
Furthermore, roughly half of the patients meeting the Public Health Wales definition of definite
nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infection had been admitted for 30 days prior to diagnosis, highlighting a
potential window of opportunity for inpatient pre-exposure and/or post-exposure prophylaxis.

Introduction
Health-care-associated infections represent an enduring and serious threat to patient safety in hospital
and healthcare facilities 1,2 and have been estimated to cost the National Health Service £1 billion every
year.3 The transmission of respiratory viruses such as influenza in the healthcare environment are a well
recognised cause significant morbidity and mortality at the individual patient level,4 however little is
known regarding the significance of in-hospital (nosocomial) transmission of the novel pandemic
coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. Such information is essential to assess the effectiveness of recent infection
control measure guidance.5 A national report published by the Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch
on 29th October 2020 stated: “At the time of writing, there was no publicly available data to provide
evidence of the scale of nosocomial of covid-19 in the NHS”.6 In addition, acknowledgement of risk is
timely to inform prioritisation of public health measures such as vaccination of healthcare workers and
vulnerable populations, and decisions regarding continuation of routine NHS service provision.

We identified limited studies reporting on the prevalence and outcomes of medical patients’ hospitalacquired covid-19 within the UK,7-14 employing a range of case definitions and study design – restricting
generalisability. The largest and only multi-centre cohort study was performed the by COPE (COVID19 in Older PEople study) investigators, describing outcomes in 1564 patients admitted with
polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection across 11 hospitals (including 4 in
Wales) between 27th February until 28th April 2020.8 Applying a probabilistic case definition of
nosocomial infection (admitted for at least 15 days before a SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis), Carter et al.
estimated 12.5% contracted covid-19 in hospital. Mortality in the nosocomial patient group appeared
comparable to those with likely community-acquired infection (27.0% and 27.2%, respectively), despite
the older age and higher frailty of these patients.8 Applying a similar case definition, Taylor et al found
probable nosocomial cases represented 11.3% of confirmed cases within a major London trust admitted
between 6th March to 12 April 2020; mortality was unreported in this study.7 These reports preceded
recognition of high-profile nosocomial outbreaks across several UK hospitals.15,16 Thus, reliable
estimates of the true impact of hospital-acquired covid-19 infection remain hampered by a paucity of
publicly-available data at national and regional levels.17

Here, we update assessment of the relative burden of community- relative to nosocomial-acquired
SARS-CoV-2 infection, utilising anonymised patient- and hospital-level data collected via the National
Pathway for Managing Covid-19 Infections in Secondary Care in Wales initiative. Our primary aim
was to describe inpatient case load and mortality across the nation of Wales in the context of probable
infection source. Our secondary aim was to examine the significance of commonly used differing case
definitions and statistical methodologies when interpreting these findings. Together these findings
suggest that mortality from nosocomial infection may be higher than previously reported, emphasizing
the importance of infection control measures to protect vulnerable inpatient cohorts, and directing
prioritisation of pre- and post-exposure prophylactic measures.

Statistical methods

Data were obtained as part of the National Pathway for Managing Covid-19 Infections in Secondary
Care in Wales initiative (www.covid-19hospitalguideline.wales.nhs.uk), which collects patient- and
site- level outcomes through the use of an online data collection tool, supporting guideline development
and subsequent audit cycles.
In each hospital in Wales a study lead was identified, who coordinated data collection. All 18 major
hospitals in Wales that admitted patients through emergency departments or medical assessment units
were included (Supplementary Table 1).
Positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results recorded between 1st March 2020 and
1st July 2020 with a record of hospital admission were obtained from Public Health Wales and used to
identify patients for retrospective notes review information by local clinical teams.
Demographic variables with prognostic significance were collected as mandatory data fields for the
index admission using an online tool including: date of positive PCR swab collection, dates of
admission and discharge (when complete), patient age, sex, comorbidity count, and outcome (death or
discharge). Supplementary fields were also collected, as described in the text.
The primary outcome for analysis was descriptive in nature, with comparison of all-cause mortality rate
and cohort demographics based upon probable origin of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Secondary analyses
based on time to discharge or death were also investigated.

Frailty was assessed using the pre-admission Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS), as recommended by the
National Institute for Clinical Excellence.18 For the purposes of the analyses, CFS scores were grouped
into clinically meaningful groups: 1-4, 5–6, and 7–9. Welsh Index of Multiple of Deprivation (WIMD)
was derived from the patients’ post-code and evaluated by quartiles.
Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics assessed at admission were grouped by outcome and
probable infection origin, based on a) clinician-recorded case definition, b) standardised case definitions
(Supplementary Table 2). Continuous variables are presented as median [inter-quartile range, IQR] and
categorical variables as n (%), unless otherwise stated. Time-to-event data were analysed using
cumulative incidence curves, acknowledging the competing risk of death or discharge. We used time in
hospital following a covid-19 diagnosis as a standard measure to avoid introducing survivorship-bias,
defining day 0 of the at-risk period as the most recent of either admission date or SARS-CoV-2
diagnostic testing.

Secondary statistical significance testing was performed according to the data encountered: For
univariate analysis of categorical data, such as sex, Fisher’s exact or chi-square testing was performed,
comparing observed numbers for NC cases with numbers predicted by the ratio within the CAC subgroup. For continuous data, Welch's t-tests were used if the assumptions of normality were met;
otherwise non-parametric Mann-Whitney U tests were employed. Multi-level logistic regression was
used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI), including factors that occurred
before the outcome of interest to preserve causal order. Two-sided statistical significance was set at p
<0.05. Analysis were performed using R version 4.0.2 in RStudio (Version 1.3.959, R Foundation,
Vienna, Austria) with packages including tidyverse, and survival and GraphPad Prism (version 6.07).

171

Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the effect of varying the clinical case definition for
nosocomial-acquired infection, and to minimise potential survivorship bias associated with previouslyused case definitions.

Table 1: Demographics and clinical features at presentation

4112 adults hospitalised with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR result between 1st March to 1st July 2020
were screened from which clinical case information on 2594 case records were inputted (Supplementary
Figure 1: Study flowchart). Admission dates ranged from 25th March 2019, to 3rd July 2020, with the
last recorded discharge on 26th October 2020. A total of 76 individuals were excluded from the study
after data screening due to missing primary data fields. Reasons for exclusion were: age < 18 years or
not stated (n=27), admission date missing or incorrectly entered (n=15), date of PCR diagnosis missing
or outside of study period (n=16), and discharge date incorrectly entered (n=3). In addition, 15 cases
where the first PCR result exceeded 31 days of admission or discharge were excluded. This left 2518
patients for analysis with complete case records for primary fields, representing approximately 63% of
the total adult population hospitalised with covid-19 within the nation of Wales. For 10 of the 18
participating sites ≥ 80% coverage was achieved. Completeness of supplementary data fields was more
varied, with WIMD score available in 95.1% of cases, admission source in 2372 (93.8%), inpatient
ceiling of care decisions in 1976 (78.2%), and CFS in 1316 cases (52.1%).
Admission features are summarised by outcome in Table 1. The cohort comprised a relatively elderly
population with a median age of 74 years [IQR 62.5-85.5; range 19-99]. Overall, more men (n= 1369,
54.4%) than women (n=1149, 45.6%) were admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of covid-19, although
this trend was reversed within the under 45 and over 85-year age groups (Table 1; Supplementary Table
3). A deprivation gradient was also apparent, with individuals from the most-deprived (lowest) WIMD
quartile over-represented within admissions (31.1%) relative to those in the least deprived quartile
(18.9%, Chi-squared test: p <0.0001).

Prevalence and mortality rates by clinician recorded admission source
To investigate the impact of covid-19 infection origin on patient outcomes, we first examined mortality
by clinician-defined admission source, available in 2372 cases (93.8%); shown Table 2. Hospitalacquired covid-19 was documented in 437 cases (17.3% of cohort, 37.8% mortality), comparable to
mortality following ambulance presentation (40.5%). Walk-in and GP referrals together accounted for
20.4% of the cohort and had the lowest estimated inpatient mortality rate (17.1-23.2%), comparable to
patients without a recorded admission source (26.3%). The small number of patients admitted from care
or nursing homes (n=52) showed an inpatient mortality rate of 46.2%.

As 95% of patients will display symptoms between 2 to 11.5 days of exposure,19 the COPE-study
definition represents a conservative estimate of the burden of nosocomial-cases infection. We therefore
considered the effect on mortality and case numbers by varying the case definition across the incubation
period, taking admission as the earliest potential nosocomial exposure (Supplementary Table 4). As
shown in Figure 2A, inpatient mortality rates for nosocomial covid-19 ranged from 38% to 42% and
remained consistently greater than in patients with community-acquired infection (31% to 34%). By
contrast, varying the case definition resulted in significant changes in case numbers and deaths (Figure
2B/C). Applying the Public Health England case definition (diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 made >7 days
following admission) identified 727 admissions and 301 deaths. This rose to 830 cases and 342 deaths
when patients with a date of PCR testing >5 days following admission was used to diagnose
nosocomial-covid-19.20 Together, these findings indicate that whilst changing the case definition for
nosocomial-covid-19 has limited effect on case fatality rates, it significantly alters the number of
reported cases of nosocomial infection and total mortality.

Figure 3: Competing risk analysis plot of nosocomial and community infection outcomes of
COVID-19 patients.

We next applied a definition of nosocomial covid-19 reported by the COPE-study investigators and
used by Public Health Wales,8 based upon an interval exceeding 14 days between admission and SARSCoV-2 diagnostic testing (Supplementary Table 1). We identified 413 nosocomial cases, representing
16.4% of the cohort. Most patients (n=1610, 63.9 %) were diagnosed by PCR sampling conducted prior
to or within the first five days of admission date and were defined as community-acquired; 456 patients
(18.1% of total cases) had a positive PCR taken between 5 and 14 days after admission. By end of the
study period, 39.2% of patients with nosocomial-infection had died, compared to a case fatality rate of
31.6% in community-acquired covid-19 cases. This observation of greater mortality amongst NC
patients proved generalisable across the majority of admission sites (Figure 1). The median time from
SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis to discharge in community-acquired covid-19 cases was 7 days (IQR: 3.015.0), compared to 17 days (IQR: 7.0-38.0) in patients with nosocomial-infection. Using this definition,
nosocomial cases had been admitted for a median of 30 days prior to diagnosis (IQR: 15.0-62.5), with
48 patients admitted for over 100 days. The median overall length of stay for patients with nosocomial
infection was 60 days (IQR: 34.0-98.5).

Kaplan Meier survival analysis has been utilised by several recent groups to compare outcomes for
hospital and community-acquired covid-19 in UK hospitals to date.8,9 However, the differing discharge
kinetics observed in patients with nosocomial- and community-acquired covid-19 led us to question the
suitability of this statistical methodology without consideration of the competing risks of discharge to
death. As shown in Figure 3, nosocomial-infection is associated with a greater cumulative incidence of
inpatient mortality than community-acquired, in line with the crude case inpatient mortality rates
described. This contrast with Kaplan Meier analysis (Supplementary Figure 2), confirming the potential
for conflicting interpretations of the same data set when employing different statistical methodologies.

Given the apparent vulnerability of the patient cohort developing nosocomial infection, we questioned
if ceiling of care decisions might impact upon patient outcomes. Returning to the COPE-study
definition, ceiling of care decisions were recorded in 1249 (77.6%) of community-acquired and 322
(78.0 %) of nosocomial-acquired covid-19. A ward-based ceiling of care (including consideration of
CPAP or NIV) was documented in 75.3% of nosocomial cases, compared to 58.8% of communityacquired cases (Fisher’s Exact Test p<0.0001, OR: 2.13, 95% CI: 1.58 to 2.87). Put another way, the
odds of a ward level ceiling of care being documented was twice as great in patients with nosocomialacquired compared to community-acquired covid-19. To determine the relative importance of this as a
predictor of adverse outcome, we performed logistic regression analysis with the binomial outcome of
death or discharge in nosocomial-acquired cases. In univariate analysis, older age and male sex were
both associated with increased odds of death; OR 1.02 (95% CI: 1.03 to 1.05) and OR 1.56 (95% CI:
1.05 to 2.33), respectively. Recorded ceiling of care at ward level was significantly associated with an
increased risk of mortality: OR 3.20 (95% CI: 1.88 to 5.43) when considered alone, but not following
adjustment for age, sex, index of multiple deprivation and comorbidities OR 1.39 (95% CI: 0.572 to
3.38). Taken together, these observations confirmed our expectation that patient with nosocomialacquired SARS-CoV-2 represented a more vulnerable cohort, and as such were less likely to be
managed using more invasive care such as intubation or CPAP. However, we found no evidence that a
ward-level ceiling of care was an independent predictor of mortality.

Monthly prevalence of nosocomial covid-19

305

We hypothesized that patients with nosocomial-covid-19 might represent a more vulnerable population,
a finding suggested by previous groups, but potentially confounded by introduction of selection bias
due to the requirement for a prolonged inpatient admission period within the case definition of
nosocomial-SARS-CoV-2 infection. To address this, we explored demographic and clinical
characteristics in patients based on a diagnostic cut-off of 2 days post-admission, a definition commonly
used for hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia. Individuals with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test taken >2
days following admission were typically older and frailer, with a greater median CFS of 6 (IQR 4.57.5), compared to 3 (IQR 1-5) in those with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test taken up to 2 days following
admission. Marked differences in multi-morbidity were evident, with 35.4% of “nosocomial” patients
having at least 4 comorbidities compared to 26.6% of “community-acquired” patients (Supplementary
Table 5). Together, this supports the hypothesis that age, frailty, and multi-morbidity are factors
associated with hospital-acquired covid-19, and not simply a reflection of the diagnostic definition.

We determined monthly trends for the frequency of total and new nosocomial diagnoses
(Supplementary Table 6). Between March and April 2020, the number of cases meeting the COPE
definition for nosocomial-infection across Wales increased from 97 to 216, paralleling the rise in total
covid-19 admissions. Nosocomial-infection represented 21.0% of new covid-19 diagnoses during May
(73/347 total cases), falling slightly to 18.5% in June. Similar nosocomial infection rates were observed
based on clinician-recorded nosocomial diagnoses, with a monthly prevalence between March to June
of 17.8% and 19.3%.

Our study is also the first to investigate the impact of applying a range of case definitions when
quantifying the burden of hospital-acquired covid-19. By adopting a clinical case definition based on
the median incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 of 5 days,20 we identified 14.2% additional cases, and
13.6% more deaths attributable to nosocomial covid-19 than with the >7-day threshold currently used
by Public Health England. This increased burden is likely an overestimate but may be relevant given
that even low-risk clinical assessment areas may contain patients with SARS-CoV-2.22 Thus, in the
absence of sufficient isolation cubicles for patients undergoing assessment and adequately sensitive
rapid turn-around diagnostic testing, the risk of patient-to-patient transmission is likely to persist despite
infection control practices of cohorting and universal screening. We also confirm that patients with
hospital-acquired covid-19 appear a disproportionately vulnerable group, seemingly independent of
diagnostic delay from admission. Advanced age, frailty, and multi-morbidity are well-recognised risk
factors for adverse outcome in community-acquired covid-19.23,24 We suggest increased frailty is also
likely to be causally associated with an increased personal care requirement and thus predispose to
nosocomial exposure of SARS-CoV-2 from healthcare workers, a conclusion supported by recent
whole-genome sequencing of nosocomial outbreaks.14 As highlighted in a recent evaluation of serial
PCR screening in healthcare workers, 3% of those attending work tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.25
Serological studies suggest the rate of staff infection is far higher on wards with known nosocomial
outbreaks, in studies conducted in hospitals not undertaking staff screening.26 Finally, we also
considered the impact of ceiling of care on outcome, as few other UK multi-centre studies have explored
this. Importantly, we found no evidence that ceiling of care determined outcome once clinical risk
factors were accounted for, a finding that may be reassuring for patients and families when discussing
this issue.

This study is primarily limited by its retrospective nature, which might predispose to ascertainment bias
(for instance, notes being more readily available for patients who have died than awaiting discharge).
This risk is common to other multi-centre studies,8,23,24 and sites adopted random notes retrieval to
minimise this. We further sought to mitigate this by extending the data collection period well beyond
the end of the first wave, enabling capture of late discharges and including nosocomial outbreaks.
Record entry by a body of motivated clinicians followed a standardised online tool with a limited core
requirement, resulting in minimal missing core data. As a result, coverage exceeded 60% of hospital
admissions with covid-19 across the nation of Wales (and ≥80% in 10 of 18 participating sites). This
compares favourably to recent descriptive studies.8,23,24 We recognise that our findings represent crude
inpatient mortality rate estimates, based on all-cause mortality. As the total number of patients at risk
of infection was unknown, they should not be used to infer the risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 within
hospital. Future studies making use of linked datasets are suggested to estimate excess mortality
associated with nosocomial infection and identify routes of transmission are required. However, with
the NHS facing winter-pressures and further surges in SARS-CoV-2 community circulation rates, our
findings serve as a timely reminder as to the dangers faced by patients within hospital as well as those
within care homes or shielding within the community. This concern is heightened by the spread of a
novel antigenic variant with evidence for enhanced transmissibility 27

Understanding the risk and burden of covid-19 infection within healthcare environments is essential to
direct risk mitigation strategies for the immediate future. In this work, we analysed a total of 2,518
patients with PCR-proven covid-19 infection admitted to hospitals across Wales. In contrast to previous
studies,8 reported earlier in the pandemic, inpatient mortality rates were consistently greater in those
who likely acquired the virus in the context of hospital admission (37.9-42.2%), compared to
community-acquired infection (31.4-34.6%) across a range of case definitions. Such heightened
mortality rate estimates are in line with single centre reports from a major London teaching hospital
where definitely or probably hospital-acquired cases had a fatality rate of 36%.13 Similarly, the monthly
prevalence estimates found in our study are also in line with the 20% modelled for a typical UK
hospital.21

Together, our results highlight the burden associated with extremely infectious agents within the
healthcare environment. Although the incidence of nosocomial covid-19 cases decreased significantly
following the peak of community-acquired cases, the importance of enhanced infection control
measures cannot be overstated.28 Indeed, current Public Health Wales data indicates an active rise in
probable hospital-acquired case numbers, mirroring the first wave.29 We highlight the opportunity for
pre-exposure and post-exposure prophylactic measures, including vaccination and/or enrolment in
clinical trials employing pharmaceutical and biological antiviral agents such as antibody therapy.30, 31
This follows the observation that many of those dying with hospital-acquired covid-19 had typically
been in hospital for over a month prior to diagnosis of infection. Inpatient vaccination has long been
considered a missed opportunity for improving influenza vaccine uptake.32 Finally, we caution that
research is urgently required to assess the efficacy of vaccination within vulnerable groups of
individuals within hospital and care homes, who are likely to differ from those enrolled in initial trials
in age, frailty, and immunocompetence.33
