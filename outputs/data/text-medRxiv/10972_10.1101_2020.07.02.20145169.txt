ABSTRACT (248 WORDS)
BACKGROUND: Health-care workers (HCWs) could be at increased occupational risk for
SARS-CoV-2 infection due to increased exposure. Information regarding the burden of
COVID-19 epidemic in HCWs living in Mexico is scarce. Here, we aimed to explore the
epidemiology, symptoms, and risk factors associated with adverse outcomes in HCWs in
Mexico City.
METHODS: We explored data collected by the National Epidemiological Surveillance
System in Mexico City, in HCWs who underwent real-time RT-PCR test. We explored
COVID-19 outcomes in HCWs and the performance of symptoms to detect SARS-CoV-2
infection.
RESULTS: As of September 20th, 2020, 57,758 HCWs were tested for SARS-CoV-2 and
17,531 were confirmed (30.35%); 6,610 were nurses (37.70%), 4,910 physicians (28.0%),
267 dentists (1.52%) and 5,744 laboratory personnel and other HCWs (32.76%). Overall,
2,378 HCWs required hospitalization (4.12%), 2,648 developed severe COVID-19 (4.58%),
and 336 required mechanical-ventilatory support (0.58%). Lethality was recorded in 472
(0.82%) cases. We identified 635 asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections (3.62%). Compared
with general population, HCWs had higher incidence, testing, asymptomatic and mortality
rates. No individual symptom offers adequate performance to detect SARS-CoV2. Older
HCWs with chronic non-communicable diseases and severe respiratory symptoms were
associated with higher risk for adverse outcome; physicians were at higher risk compared
with nurses and other HCWs.
CONCLUSIONS: We report a high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCWs in Mexico
City. Symptoms as a screening method is not efficient to discern those HCWs with a positive
PCR-RT test. Particular attention should focus on HCWs with risk factors to prevent adverse
outcomes.

INTRODUCTION
The pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 has created new challenges in health-care
systems worldwide (1). Recently, the pandemic has led to significant increases in the
number of cases in the Americas, where it has caused considerable pressure on health-care
facilities and led to a substantial number of deaths (2,3). Health-care workers (HCWs) have
a fundamental role in caring and managing patients with COVID-19, as they are the primary
workers involved in the daily management of pandemic at an individual level. Notably, this
population is at a significant occupational risk of infection attributable to an increased
frequency of exposure to infected individuals, either symptomatic or asymptomatic,
ultimately leading to an increased risk of associated COVID-19 complications. Although it
has been emphasized that HCWs with respiratory symptoms should be isolated as soon as
possible, there is no consensus on which other symptoms are suggestive of SARS-CoV-2
infection (4). Moreover, reports show that HCWs tend to present without respiratory
symptoms at the time of diagnosis (5). Ultimately, this has raised questions on whether a
testing strategy guided by the presence of symptoms and whether a mandatory policy of
use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) outside the areas of care of infected patients
are the best approaches in HCWs.
Additionally, the COVID-19 epidemic in Mexico coexists with a high prevalence of chronic
health conditions, and HCW are no exception. Since such conditions have been amply
shown to increase risk for severe outcomes in COVID-19, the pandemic creates a very
complex situation (6). Furthermore, Mexico has a highly fragmented and segmented
healthcare system, hampering its ability to provide a unified framework to protect HCWs (7).
Besides, social inequities could have increase the disparities in risk among HCWs within
marginalized communities (8). Given these fundamental differences, HCWs living in Mexico
could be at a substantial risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and adverse COVID-19 outcomes.
There is a need to understand these trends and outcomes related to COVID-19 in HCWs to

generate data-driven evidence which could inform public policy and promote development
of recommendations to improve work environments and testing policies amongst HCWs by
reducing viral transmission between peers and, ultimately decrease adverse outcomes.
Here, we sought to investigate the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection within HCWs and
its related outcomes in Mexico City.
METHODS
Data sources
We analyzed data collected within the National Epidemiological Surveillance System
(NESS) database in Mexico City, which is an open-source dataset comprising daily updated
suspected COVID-19 cases that have been tested using real-time RT-PCR to confirm
SARS-CoV-2 according to the Berlin Protocol (9), and were certified by the National Institute
for Epidemiological Diagnosis and Reference (10,11). The database contains information
on all persons tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection at public facilities in Mexico, as well as in all
private healthcare facilities that comply with the legal mandate to report COVID-19 cases to
health authorities (12). Further testing strategy implemented in HCWs in Mexico City is
presented in Supplementary Material. Data to estimate HCWs population rates were
extracted from 2019 Health Information System obtained by the Mexican Ministry of Health
(SSA) (13).
Definitions of COVID-19 cases, predictors, and outcomes
Health-care related professions included subjects whose occupations were reported as
physicians, nurses, dentists, laboratory personnel and other involved HCWs. Demographic
and health data are collected and uploaded to the epidemiologic surveillance database by
personnel from each corresponding health-care facility. Available variables include age, sex,
nationality, state and municipality where the case was detected, immigration status as well
as identification of individuals who self-identify as indigenous. Complete clinical assessment
methodology is presented in Supplementary Material. Date of symptom onset, hospital

admission, and death are available for all cases as are outpatient or hospitalized status,
information regarding the diagnosis of clinical pneumonia, ICU admission, and whether the
patient required mechanical ventilation support (MVS). Severe outcome was defined as a
composite definition comprising death, requirement for MVS or ICU admission (14).
Statistical analysis
Population-based statistics
Descriptive analysis methodology is presented in Supplementary Material. We estimated
the incidence, testing, asymptomatic and mortality rates by standardizing each event among
the reported 2019 HCW population working in Mexico City or 2020 population living in
Mexico City using data from CONAPO (15), and normalized each estimate to reflect a rate
per 100,000 inhabitants.
Conditions and symptoms related to SARS-CoV-2 positivity
We aimed to investigate comorbidities and symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2
positivity using a mixed effects logistic regression model, including facility of treatment as a
random effect to account for the variability in case distribution and treatment across
healthcare facilities. We excluded HCWs who were suspected cases at the time of inclusion
without a definitive result for SARS-CoV-2. Two separate models were designed to explore
separately comorbidities and symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity. We further
explored the diagnostic test capacity, area under the curve, sensitivity, specificity, positive
and negative predictive values (VPP, VPN, respectively) of each symptom to predict SARSCoV-2 positivity.
COVID-19 mortality risk and clinical outcomes
We fitted Cox Proportional risk regression models to explore risk factors associated to
COVID-19 related 30-day lethality, hospitalization, or severe outcome estimating time from
symptom onset up to death, clinically reported outcome, or censoring (ongoing studied
subjects), whichever occurred first. Factors associated with using mechanical ventilation

support (MVS) were evaluated using a mixed effects logistic regression model. We also
performed a Kaplan-Meier analysis to assess differences in COVID-19 outcomes comparing
physicians and other HCWs using the Breslow-Cox test. A p-value <0·05 was considered
as statistical significance threshold. All analyses were performed using R software version
3.6.2.
RESULTS
COVID-19 in health-care workers
As of the writing of this report (September 20th, 2020) the NESS had assessed for SARSCoV-2 infection 403,185 people in Mexico City (estimated population: 8,737,172), out of
whom 57,758 (14.32%) were HCWs (estimated HCWs population: 161,580). From the
evaluated HCWs, 36.1% (n=20,848) were nurses, 30.8% (n=17,778) physicians and 33.1%
(n=19,132) other-HCWs (5.51% dentists, 6.21% laboratory personnel and 88.28%
supportive HCWs). Amongst them, 30.35% (n=17,531) had confirmed SARS-CoV-2
infection. Positivity rates by HCWs category were 31.2% (n=6,610) in nurses, 27.6%
(n=4,910) physicians, 25.3% (n=267) dentists, 36.4% (n=433) laboratory personnel and
31.5% (n=5,311) for the supportive HCWs. In all studied HCWs, we recorded 2,648 (4.58%)
HCWs who required hospitalization, 2,735 with a severe outcome (4.73%), and 336 who
required MVS (0.58%). Lethality attributable was recorded in 472 (0.82%) HCWs. Overall,
635 (3.62%) HCWs referred no associated symptoms but tested positive for SARS-CoV-2
(Table 1).
Population-based analysis in health-care workers
Overall, we found that the positivity (30.3% vs 35.5%) and lethality rates (1.87% vs 9.20%)
as well as daily confirmed asymptomatic cases (median IQR: 235 [181-307] vs 1,177 [3243,047] cases) were lower in HCWs as compared with the general population. This can be
partially explained by the fact that testing rates per 100,000 inhabitants were higher in HCWs
compared to the general population (34,349 vs 3,825 per 100,000), which is also reflected

in a higher incidence of confirmed (10,412 vs 1,359 per 100,000) and asymptomatic cases
(3,728 vs 564 per 100,000). Nevertheless, in our population-based analysis we observed
that the mortality rate (195 vs 125 per 100,000) was higher compared with general
population living in Mexico City (Figure 1).
Associated symptoms and conditions in health-care workers with SARS-CoV-2 positivity
Examining predictive performance of symptomatology to predict SARS-CoV-2 positivity, we
observed that the presence of any symptom had an adequate sensitivity and negative
predictive value, despite overall lower AUC. However, no individual symptom offered an
adequate diagnostic accuracy or performance. Exploring the effectiveness to determine if
known previous contact with suspected viral cases along with the absence of any symptom
improved performance, we found that this joint consideration increased both sensitivity and
negative predictive value, compared to only using the absence of any symptoms
(Supplementary Table 1). Additionally, we found that male HCWs, with more than seven
days from the onset of symptoms, with obesity, diabetes, or those pregnant women, had
increased likelihood of SARS-CoV2 positivity; while those HCWs who reported active
smoking, contact with a suspected viral case, with recent trips abroad and women in the
puerperium period, had a lower probability for positivity (Supplementary Figure 1).
Predictors for COVID-19 related outcomes in health-care workers
In confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases, we found that symptoms at clinical assessment which
increased risk for hospitalization were dyspnea, fever, and polypnea; while HCWs with
diarrhea, odynophagia, and conjunctivitis had a decreased risk for this outcome.
Furthermore, HCWs >65 years and those living with HIV/AIDS, diabetes, obesity, and
arterial hypertension had increased risk of being hospitalized. Risk factors associated to
severe outcomes in HCWs were age >65 years, living with diabetes, obesity and presence
of dyspnea, fever, or polypnea at the time of initial clinical assessment. Moreover, those
HCWs with age >65 years living with diabetes, early onset diabetes (<40 years), obesity,

and seven days from the onset of symptoms or dyspnea at evaluation were conditions
associated with MVS. Finally, predictors for lethality in HCWs were age >65 years, selfreported indigenous ethnicity, diabetes, early onset diabetes, obesity and presence of
clinical pneumonia at evaluation (Figure 2).
COVID-19 related outcomes of amongst groups of health-care workers.
Overall, compared with general population with positive SARS-CoV-2 test living in Mexico
City, HCWs had a decreased risk for hospitalization (HR 0.41, 95%CI 0.39-0.44), severe
outcome (HR 0.46, 95%CI 0.44-0.49) and lethality (HR 0.33, 95%CI 0.30-0.37) (Figure 3).
As a secondary analysis, we sought to explore risk of COVID-19 related outcomes in
subgroups of HCWs. Although the group of physicians had a decreased likelihood to have
a positive SARS-CoV-2 test (OR 0.81, 95%CI 0.77-0.85) compared with the group of nurses
and other HCWs, this group had an increased risk for hospitalization (HR 1.57, 95%CI 1.361.81) and severe outcome (HR 1.34, 95%CI 1.17-1.54) after adjusting for the previously
observed associated variables for each outcome compared with the group of nurses and
other HCWs. We also observed that physicians had an increased lethality risk (HR 1.61,
95%CI 1.12-2.32) after adjusted for covariates (Figure 3). Finally, a particular group of
interest were HCWs who belonged to an indigenous group, which had up to 14-fold
increased risk for COVID-19 lethality (HR 95%CI 4.22-43.06) after adjusting for covariates,
although no differences were found in the risk for hospitalization and severe outcome.
DISCUSSION
In this work, we report the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, estimated epidemiological
rates, and COVID-19 clinical outcomes using an open-source city-wide based surveillance
reports of HCWs living in Mexico City. Amongst health-care workers, the group of physicians
tend to have an increased risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes, which is a remarkable
occupational risk. Moreover, certain factors, such as associated comorbidities and
symptoms at the time of evaluation are associated with an increased risk of adverse

outcomes. Particularly concerning is the fact that population-based mortality rate is higher
among HCWs than the general population. It is unclear whether this reflects a true higher
lethality, higher rates of infection, or a combination of both. These findings should be
considered by authorities concerning the occupational hazards in HCWs, particularly in
physicians to inform public policy related to ameliorate the burden of the COVID-19
pandemic on HCWs given their vital role in the daily pandemic management at an individual
level.
HCWs have increased occupational hazard to acquire SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with
general population, attributable to direct contact during care of hospitalized patients.
Prevalence and lethality rates of SARS-CoV-2 infections reported in our HCWs population
are higher compared with previous reports in China, Europe and the United States (4,16–
22). Similarly, in Mexico the number of positive cases reported in HCWs has consistently
increased since the first confirmed cases were reported in late February. To reduce
transmissibility and improve outcomes, the current policy in Mexico requires that HCWs who
develop respiratory symptoms should be isolated to mitigate the spread between peers.
However, as our results confirm and based on previous reports, there is no sustainable
evidence which allows using any individual symptom to identify SARS-CoV-2 positive cases
in a clinical context (4). Nevertheless, a case definition of possible SARS-CoV-2 which
includes the presence of any one symptom has acceptable sensitivity and a high negative
predictive value, which is further improved by adding contact with symptomatic persons to
the definition. Whilst the use of this definition may not eliminate the necessity to extend
testing within all reasonable means, it does indicate that adequate contact tracing and case
selection would allow to allocate testing in limited resource settings. Furthermore, the testing
strategy adopted by the epidemiological surveillance system in Mexico, which is based on
the appearance of symptoms to rule out diagnosis, may not be adequate to capture HCWs
with asymptomatic infection or with non-respiratory symptoms. An alternative approach

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.02.20145169; this version posted September 22, 2020. The copyright holder for this

would be to include massive testing using low-cost detection tests for SARS-CoV-2
infectivity, which have recently been shown to have adequate sensitivity and could
reasonably be implemented periodically for epidemiological surveillance amongst HCWs
once such tests become widely available (23–25).
It is important to note that our results do not distinguish between HCWs directly caring for
COVID-19 patients and those carrying out other tasks. It is therefore impossible to ascertain
whether the higher COVID-19 risks relate to direct care or rather to high rates of public
contact. Although previous reports have shown the effectiveness of personal protective
equipment, there is still insufficient evidence if this strategy could mitigate the infection
amongst all HCWs at long-term, which sets an area of opportunity for further studies (26,27).
Based on the precautionary principle, we advocate a rational and equal access distribution
of PPE in HCWs in Mexico City.
Our results also show that comorbidities in HCWs, particularly those related to chronic noncommunicable diseases (e.g., diabetes, early onset diabetes, obesity and arterial
hypertension), and the presentation of severe respiratory symptoms at the time of clinical
assessment, increases the risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes. Certain groups, such as
pregnant women, older workers, and those who self-identify with indigenous ethnicity, are
at higher risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes. Previous reports by our group had shown the
relationship between the presence of cardiometabolic diseases and risk of complications
associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Mexico (28–31). Although not completely
understood, this relationship could be explained by immunological over responsiveness
observed in confirmed cases with diabetes and obesity (28,31,32), particularly given recent
evidence relating changes associated with an enhanced immune response to SARS-CoV-2
with risk of respiratory and multi-organ failure (31,33). Conversely, in patients with prior
immunosuppression, an increased risk for associated co-infections has been reported,
which could explain risk for adverse outcomes in HCWs with HIV/AIDS or pregnancy (34,35).

Finally, we found that physicians are a group at risk for developing adverse events compared
to other HCWs. This is consistent with a previous report, as it has been shown that
physicians tend to spend more time in areas where patients with SARS-CoV-2 are assisted
(36). Furthermore, prolonged shift times, work overload, psychological distress, exposure to
probable cases amongst peers could lead physicians to be considered a group with
significant occupational risk for developing COVID-19 related outcomes (37–39).
Interestingly, we also found that groups of physicians who self-reported as belonging to an
indigenous community were at increased risk of death attributable to COVID-19. Although
preliminary, these results may denote an inequality in access to timely care in this group of
HCWs, given the significant social discrepancies reported in Mexico, which have been
exacerbated during the epidemic (8,40–42). More studies should focus on the risk of
adverse outcomes attributable to social conditions in medical personnel.
Our study had some strengths and limitations. First, we analyzed a large dataset which
included information on confirmed positive and negative SARS-CoV-2 cases in Mexico City,
providing a unique opportunity to investigate COVID-19 specific risk factors in HCWs. A
potential limitation of this study is the use of data collected from a sentinel epidemiological
surveillance system model, which is skewed towards investigating high-risk cases based on
the presentation of respiratory symptoms or only those with specific risk factors, which on
the one hand increases power to detect the effect of comorbidities and on the other hand
might not be representative of milder COVID-19 cases. This is particularly true for
asymptomatic cases amongst HCWs, which were heavily underrepresented in our study and
its prevalence must be assessed with widespread systematic testing amongst HCWs to
reduce in-hospital transmission amongst peers. Although the testing performed in our HCWs
population is higher compared to the general population living in Mexico City, it still remains
low compared to other HCWs studies performed in other countries (43). Another potential
limitation of our study is that our populational-based analyses of HCWs is limited to those

living in Mexico City, without the exact number of recruited HCWs during the epidemic, thus
our epidemiological rates should be interpreted as approximations. Moreover, all analyses
were performed to estimate the burden of HCWs in Mexico City, which may not capture the
whole picture in the country or the large socio-economic inequalities which might lead to
higher rates of infection amongst HCWs in disadvantaged areas.
In summary, we present the first report of a city-wide based surveillance system which
assessed clinical symptomatology and related outcomes attributable to COVID-19 in HCWs
living in Mexico City. We found that no individual symptom can accurately discern HCWs
with SARS-CoV-2 infection; therefore there may be a considerable but underreported
prevalence of positive asymptomatic infections amongst HCWs. Symptoms should not be
considered as the main indicator of infection and therefore, we strongly suggest a novel
reframing for the current testing strategy implemented for HCWs living in Mexico City.
Additionally, comorbidities, presence of respiratory symptoms at clinical assessment, and
susceptible groups of HCWs, could have increase the risk of severe outcomes. Our results
could inform policies within the health-care systems on a systematic testing policy, the
rational use of personal protective equipment, early isolation of probable cases regardless
the symptoms, exclusion of risk groups in areas where patients with SARS-CoV-2 are
routinely assisted and consideration of intrinsic inequalities between workers, which overall,
could bring to a better quality of life for HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic.
