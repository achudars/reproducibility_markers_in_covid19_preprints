Abstract
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic and has been widely
reported; however, a comprehensive systemic review and meta-analysis has not been
conducted. We systematically investigated the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in
mainland China to guide diagnosis and treatment. We searched the PubMed, Embase,
Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, bioRxiv, medRxiv, and SSRN databases
for studies related to COVID-19 published or preprinted in English or Chinese from
January 1 to March 15, 2020. Clinical studies on COVID-19 performed in mainland
China were included. We collected primary outcomes including signs and symptoms,
chest CT imaging, laboratory tests, and treatments. Study selection, data extraction,
and risk of bias assessment were performed by two independent reviewers.
Qualitative and quantitative synthesis was conducted, and random-effects models
were applied to pooled estimates. This study is registered with PROSPERO (number
CRD42020171606). Of the 3624 records identified, 147 studies (20,662 patients)
were analyzed. The mean age of patients with COVID-19 was 49.40 years, 53.45%
were male, and 38.52% had at least one comorbidity. Fever and cough were the most
common symptoms, followed by fatigue, expectoration, and shortness of breath. Most
patients with COVID-19 had abnormal chest CT findings with ground glass opacity
(70.70%) or consolidation (29.91%). Laboratory findings shown lymphopenia,
increased lactate dehydrogenase, increased infection-related indicators, and
fibrinolytic hyperactivity. Antiviral therapy, antibiotic therapy, and corticosteroids
were administered to 89.75%, 79.13%, and 35.64% of patients, respectively. Most

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the seventh
human coronavirus identified, with bats thought to be the original host.1-3
SARS-CoV-2 is approximately 50% genetically identical to Middle East respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and approximately 79% identical to severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and shows a similar receptor-binding
domain structure.4 Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 may be asymptomatic or have
mild to severe pneumonia. The syndrome of clinical symptoms caused by
SARS-CoV-2 is named as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).5
COVID-19 is the third type of zoonotic coronavirus disease after SARS and MERS
occurring in the last two decades. COVID-19 is highly contagious through respiratory
droplets and contact and has caused global pandemic. As of April 17, 2020,
COVID-19 has spread to 213 countries and regions globally, causing 2,074,529
confirmed cases and 139,378 deaths.6 At present, the United States and Europe have
become the hardest-hit regions by COVID-19, with 632,781 confirmed cases in the
United States of America, 1,050,871 confirmed cases in European region.

Governments worldwide must urgently need to learn from China's experience, as
China experienced a rapid growth period followed by a stable decline period of the
COVID-19 epidemic, and currently a recovery period.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, a large number of articles have been published or
preprinted reporting its epidemiologic and clinical characteristics. However, few large
studies have been reported, and variations in reporting descriptive data may lead to
the misunderstanding of the clinical features of COVID-19. In this review, we
systematically investigated the epidemiologic, characteristics, chest computed
tomography (CT) imaging, laboratory findings, and treatments of COVID-19 in
mainland China. Our findings provide important guidance on the diagnosis and
treatment of the current global COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods
Search strategy and selection criteria
For this systematic review and a meta-analysis, we searched the PubMed, Embase,
Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, bioRxiv, medRxiv, and SSRN electronic
databases for papers published or preprinted in English or Chinese from January 1 to
March 15, 2020 with the following search terms: “coronavirus disease 2019” OR
“COVID-19” OR “SARS-CoV-2” OR “2019-nCoV” OR “Novel Coronavirus” OR
“Wuhan pneumonia”. Additional studies were identified by manually searching the
reference lists of primary studies and review articles. The authors of full papers were
contacted for additional information when required.

The inclusion criteria were as follows: clinical studies of COVID-19; studies
performed in mainland China; number of cases ≥10; and primary outcomes including
signs and symptoms, chest CT imaging, laboratory tests, and treatments were
available. We excluded studies conducted outside of China; case reports, case series,
reviews, abstract, and opinions; those without primary outcomes.
Two investigators (CT, KZ) independently reviewed the title and abstract of the
retrieved articles to select eligible articles according to the inclusion criteria. After
excluding duplicated and irrelevant studies, the full-text of the remaining studies was
reviewed to assess the eligibility for inclusion. The inter-rater agreement of study
selection was measured using the κ statistic. If multiple studies used the same dataset
or cohort, we included the most comprehensive study with the largest number of
participants and excluded the others. Disagreements were resolved by consensus or
were arbitrated by a third investigator (ZL).
Data analysis
Two investigators (CT, WW) independently extracted primary and secondary
outcomes from the eligible studies using a predefined and standardized data extraction
checklist, with disagreements resolved by discussion. The following information were
recorded: first author, province, city, sample size, gender, age, smoker, comorbidities,
symptoms, chest CT imaging, laboratory findings, complications, treatments, and
prognosis. For missing data, we evaluated online supplementary appendixes or
contacted the first or corresponding author to obtain the missing data or more
information. If no response was obtained, we calculated the data using methods such

as imputing the mean and standard deviation (SD) from the median, interquartile
range (IQR), and full range as described by Wan et al.7 and Luo et al.8
Two investigators (ZP, PY) independently assessed the risk of bias in the eligible
studies, with disagreements resolved through discussion. The Risk Of Bias In
Non-randomised Studies - of Interventions (ROBINS-I) was used to assess study
quality.9 ROBINS-I contains seven domains: (1) bias due to confounding factors; (2)
bias in the selection of participants for the study; (3) bias in classification of
interventions; (4) bias due to deviations from the intended interventions; (5) bias due
to missing data; (6) bias in the measurement of outcomes; and (7) bias in the selection
of reported results. The categories for risk of bias judgement were “Low risk”,
“Moderate risk”, “Serious risk”, “Critical risk”, and “No information”, with a
high-quality study defined as one showing a “Low risk” or “Moderate risk”. Studies
were excluded when the quality was “Critical risk” or “No information”.
R version 3.6.2 and Stata version 15 (StatCorp, College Station, TX, USA) were used
for statistical analyses. All data are expressed as overall summary estimates and 95%
confidence intervals (CIs). Cochran’s Q test and I2 statistic were used to assess
heterogeneity, with p < 0.05 for Cochran’s Q test or I2 >50% indicating significant
heterogeneity, in which cases the random-effects model was used. Otherwise, the
fixed-effects model was used. Heterogeneity was assessed by meta-regression of
province, sample size, and age. Potential publication bias was assessed by quantitative
Egger’s linear regression test. This study is registered with PROSPERO (number
CRD42020171606).

Results
A total of 3624 records were retrieved, after removing the duplicates, 2751 records
were retained. We screened the titles and abstracts and excluded 2493 ineligible
records. The full-texts of the remaining 258 records were assessed for eligibility, of
which 111 were excluded. Of the selected 147 articles, 143 were written in English
and 4 were in Chinese. The study selection flow is shown in Figure 1 and the
characteristics on eligible articles is shown in Table 1.
The results of quality assessment of the included studies are shown in the appendix
(pp 2-7). Overall, 117 high-quality studies and 30 fair-quality studies were included in
the meta-analysis.
Epidemiology and comorbidities of COVID-19
A total of 20,662 patients with COVID-19 were included. Patient ages ranged from 1
month to 100 years old, with a mean age of 49.40 years (95%CI of 45.15–53.65
years). The proportion of males was 53.45% (95%CI 52.02–54.92%). Among 5094
patients in 35 studies, 511 were smokers, accounting for 9.93% of patients (95%CI
7.87–12.54%).
Of 8028 patients with COVID-19, 3066 (38.52%, 95%CI 34.17–43.42%) had at least
one comorbidity, including hypertension (20.78%), diabetes (12.04%), cardiovascular
disease (8.58%), cerebrovascular diseases (6.01%), chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (4.20%), chronic liver disease (4.19%), malignancy (3.92%), and chronic
renal disease (3.11%). (see Figure 2, Appendix pp 8)

Signs and symptoms of COVID-19
The most common symptom of COVID-19 was fever. Of 18,513 patients with
COVID-19, 13,707 (78.49%, 95%CI 76.47–80.56%) had fever. The proportions of
patients with mild to moderate fever were 30.96% and 35.02%, and only 11.45% of
patients had high fever. Patients also experienced cough (55.49%, 95%CI
52.71–58.41%), fatigue (30.42%, 95%CI 27.20–34.03%), expectoration (26.64%,
95%CI 24.13–29.41%), shortness of breath (21.07%, 95%CI 16.33–27.17%), dyspnea
(17.08%, 85%CI 14.15–20.60%), myalgia (17.06%, 95%CI 14.32–20.32%), chest
tightness (14.19%, 95%CI 10.61–18.98%), anorexia (13.78%, 95%CI 10.42–18.21%),
chill (12.86%, 95%CI 10.47–15.79%), and headache (10.14%, 95%CI 8.84–11.63%).
Less common symptoms were pharyngalgia (9.17%), dizziness (8.92%), diarrhea
(8.61%), rhinorrhea (5.21%), nausea (4.56%), vomiting (4.02%), chest pain (3.98%),
abdominal pain (3.71%), and hemoptysis (2.62%). (see Figure 3, Appendix pp8-9)
CT imaging and laboratory findings of COVID-19
Of 8711 patients with COVID-19, 7919 (95.31%) had abnormal presentations on
chest CT imaging, with 74.72% bilateral infiltration, 73.60% peripheral distribution,
70.70% ground glass opacity, 29.91% consolidation, and 8.06% pleural effusion.
(Figure 4, Appendix pp 9)
The mean values for the leucocyte count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, platelet
count, and hemoglobin were all in the normal range. The proportion of patients with
increased leukocytes and neutrophils were 10.55% and 4.05%, respectively, whereas
those with decreased leukocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, platelets, and hemoglobin

were 24.26%, 16.64%, 48.20%, 5.80%, and 23.56%, respectively.
The mean values for albumin, alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase
(AST), total bilirubin (TB), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine (SCr),
creatine kinase (CK), and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) were all in the normal range.
The mean value for lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was moderately elevated to 308.76
U/L (95%CI 264.28–353.24 U/L). The proportion of patients showing decreased
albumin was 37.51%, whereas the proportion of patients showing increased for ALT,
AST, TB, BUN, SCr, LDH, CK, and CK-MB were 19.02%, 23.61%, 9.48%, 12.71%,
7.21%, 41.55%, 13.87%, and 16.76%, respectively. The mean values for potassium
and sodium were in the normal range.
The mean values for activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin time
(PT), D-Dimer, and fibrinogen were in the normal range. The proportion of patients
showing increased APTT, PT, D-Dimer, and fibrinogen were 25.60%, 15.78%,
43.33%, and 36.90%, respectively.
Infection-related indicators including C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte
sedimentation rate (ESR), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and serum ferritin (SF) were all
increased, with mean values of 32.05 mg/L (95%CI 27.34–36.75 mg/L), 36.37 mm/h
(95%CI 30.53–42.21 mm/h), 13.90 pg/mL (11.53–16.26 pg/mL), and 714.73 ng/mL
(95%CI 568.92–860.55ng/mL), respectively. Only procalcitonin (PCT) was in the
normal range. The proportion of patients with increased CRP PCT, ESR, IL-6, and SF
were 61.59%, 17.23%, 62.90%, 57.33%, and 76.47%, respectively. (Figure 5,

Complications and treatments of COVID-19
Common complications of COVID-19 included acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS) (25.09% 95%CI 18.88–3.35%), acute liver injury (21.68%, 95%CI
14.65–32.08%), secondary infection (17.14%, 95%CI 10.72–27.41%), acute cardiac
injury (10.61%, 95%CI 7.20–15.64%), acute kidney injury (7.12%, 95%CI
4.74–10.70%), and shock (6.05%, 95%CI 3.09–11.85%). (see Figure 6, Appendix pp
12)
Of 7510 COVID-19 patients, 5988 (89.75%, 95%CI 87.90–91.64%) were
administered antiviral therapy, 79.13% with antibiotic therapy, 35.64% with
corticosteroids, 31.69% with immunoglobulin, and 71.07% with γ-interferon.
Additionally, 3073 of 5703 cases (61.91%) were administered oxygen support, 14.52%
with non-invasive mechanical ventilation, and 7.48% with invasive mechanical
ventilation. Sixty-two of 4012 cases (2.27%) were administered extracorporeal
membrane oxygenation and 74 of 1656 cases (4.47%) were administered continuous
renal replacement therapy. Further, 14.87% of patients with COVID-19 were admitted
to the intensive care unit and 6262 patients reported clinical outcomes. There were
3664 hospitalizations; 2133 patients improved and were discharged, and 233 patients
died. Mortality was 3.09% (1.85–5.15). (see Figure 7, Appendix 11-12)

Discussion
In this review, we retrospectively analyzed clinical data from patients with COVID-19.
These patients were admitted to hospitals between December 2019 and February 2020,

which covered the rapid growth period of the COVID-19 epidemic in mainland China.
This meta-analysis is the first comprehensive summary of the clinical characteristics
of COVID-19 in mainland China. Through literature retrieval and data extraction, we
identified 20,662 patients confirmed to have COVID-19 reported in 147 articles. The
patients ranged in age from 1 month to 100 years old, with a mean age was 49.40
years, which is consistent with a China CDC report.157 This suggests that the general
population, regardless of age, is susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition,
some studies suggested that advanced age is a risk factor for severe illness and
mortality.15,19,90,92 The proportion of males was 53.45%, indicating that COVID-19
does not have a gender predisposition. Approximately 1 in 10 patients had a history of
smoking, but whether this population was more susceptible to COVID-19 remains
unclear. Of 8028 COVID-19 patients, 38.52% had at least one comorbidity, most
commonly hypertension and diabetes. Any comorbidity is an important factor in poor
prognosis. Patients with hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular and
cerebrovascular diseases are at a higher risk of severe illness or death.19,90
We also summarized 20 clinical symptoms. The most common symptom observed in
patients with COVID-19 was fever; approximately two-thirds of patients had mild to
moderate fever, whereas only 11.45% of patients had high fever. The second most
common symptom was cough, and approximately one-quarter of COVID-19 patients
produced sputum. Because angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 of alveolar epithelial
cells is the receptor for SARS-CoV-2,158 this infection induced excessive host
immune responses, causing diffuse alveolar damage and lymphocytic infiltration in

both lungs,159 manifested as dyspnea and shortness of breath. However, patients with
COVID-19 rarely showed obvious signs and symptoms in the upper respiratory tract
(pharyngalgia, rhinorrhea, nasal obstruction). Fatigue and myalgia were the most
common musculoskeletal symptoms. In addition, gastrointestinal symptoms such as
anorexia, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain were rare in patients with
COVID-19. Thus, fever and cough are the most typical clinical symptoms.
In our study, most patients with COVID-19 had abnormal findings in chest CT
imaging. The typical CT findings were characterized by ground glass opacity or
consolidation. In addition, bilateral lungs infiltration and peripheral distribution were
consistent with the pathological findings.159 According to the Guidelines for the
Diagnosis and Treatment of Novel Coronavirus Infection, clinical diagnosis can be
made by typical chest CT imaging, particularly when nucleic acid assays are scarce.160
In laboratory tests, the mean values of blood routine and biochemistry parameters
were in the normal range. Nearly one-half of patients with COVID-19 had
lymphocytopenia, and about a quarter of patients had leukopenia and anemia. Because
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is widespread in the heart and liver, LDH was
moderately elevated, and the proportion of patients showing increased for ALT, AST,
CK, and CK-MB were 19.02%, 23.61%,13.87% and 16.76%, respectively. However,
indicators of kidney function such as blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine were not
obviously elevated. In addition, the proportions of D-Dimer and fibrinogen were
increased, suggesting that patients with COVID-19 had a fibrinolytic hyperactivity
status. Infection-related indicators in patients with COVID-19 were generally

increased, including the C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate,
interleukin-6, and serum ferritin, suggesting the presence of an inflammatory storm or
secondary infection in these patients. According to Wang et al.,19 patients with severe
ill are more prone to laboratory abnormalities, including increased leukocytes,
decreased lymphocytes, abnormal liver function, abnormal coagulation function, and
increased infection-related indicators, leading to ARDS, acute myocardial injury,
acute liver injury, and shock. Lymphocytopenia, increased LDH, increased D-dimer,
and increased infection-related indicators, particularly IL-6, have been suggested to
lead to a poor prognosis.90,92
Most patients with COVID-19 were administered antiviral therapy such as oseltamivir
or lopinavir,30,161 whereas a large percentage of patients were administered

γ-interferon as an anti-viral agent to improve immunity. Antibiotic therapy was used
in most patients to treat secondary infection or sepsis. Additionally, anti-inflammatory
treatment was essential because of the cytokine storm;162 more than one-third of
patients were administered systemic corticosteroids. However, caution should be used
when administering corticosteroids therapy avoid side-effects such as weakened
immunity, nosocomial infections, psychosis, diabetes, and avascular necrosis.163
Only 233 deaths occurred among 6262 COVID-19 patients; the mortality rate was
3.09% consistent with data from the World Health Organization.6
This study had both strengths and limitations. This meta-analysis is the most
comprehensive assessment and robust evidence to date of the clinical characteristics
of patients with COVID-19 in mainland China. We evaluated 147 published and

preprinted studies involving 20,662 patients, equivalent to a quarter of all confirmed
cases in mainland China and reflecting the clinical characteristics of patients with
COVID-19.6 There were some limitations to our study. First, this study was
retrospective, and most studies were preprinted articles that had not been
peer-reviewed, leading to a moderate overall quality of the literature. Second, not all
clinical characteristics were well-documented, such as chest CT or laboratory tests,
leading to inconsistencies in the total number of each item calculated. This also led to
heterogeneity. Third, all included cases were treated from December 2019 to February
2020, and many were reported by several hospitals in Wuhan, Hubei province. There
may be repeated reports of some cases, leading to a significant heterogeneity and
obvious publication bias. To overcome these issues, we used random effects for
meta-analysis, meta-regression tests, and Egger’s test. Finally, we were unable to
determine the incubation period of COVID-19 because of the heterogeneity among
studies in reporting the timeline of cases.

In summary, COVID-19 is an emerging infectious disease with various clinical
manifestations. The morbidity of COVID-19 is not age- and sex-dependent. The most
common clinical symptoms were fever (78.49%) and cough (55.49%). Chest CT
imaging showed abnormal findings in most patients with ground glass opacity or
consolidation around the periphery of the bilateral pulmonary. The main
characteristics in laboratory findings were lymphopenia, increased LDH, increased
infection-related indicators, and fibrinolytic hyperactivity. Complications such as

ARDS and acute liver injury often occur in patients with severe ill. Antiviral therapy,
antibiotics, and oxygen support are the most important treatments, and hormone
therapy is used in some critical patients. Our findings provide important guidance for
the current global pandemic in the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.
