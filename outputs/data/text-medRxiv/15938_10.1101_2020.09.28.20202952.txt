Abstract

28

Background

29

With shortages of face-masks continuing to be reported worldwide, critical questions like

30

whether or not there is an adequate alternative to commercially manufactured face-masks

31

continue to linger especially in low- and middle- income settings. This study aimed at

32

addressing this through testing and comparing various materials and forms of face-

33

masks for filtration efficiency, breathability, microbial cleanliness, distance-dependent

34

fitness, and re-usability of different face-masks procured from face-mask vendors in

35

Kampala, Uganda.

36

Methods

37

This was a laboratory-based descriptive study that applied new protocols and already

38

existing protocols with substantive modifications to ten different types of face-mask

39

types each in quadruplicate to achieve each specified aim.

40

Results

41

Surgical face-masks had better filtration efficiency, distance-dependent fitness and

42

breathability compared to other face-masks tested. Decontamination of these face-masks

43

with 70% ethanol negatively affected their efficacy. Locally-made double layered face-

44

masks had better: filtration efficiency, distance-dependent fitness and breathability

45

compared to other locally-made cloth face-masks, and re-usability compared to all the

46

face-mask types that had been tested.

Discussion/conclusions

48

Locally-made double layered cloth face-masks could serve as alternative face-masks

49

especially for populations in low- and middle- income settings like Uganda while

50

allowing restricted use of surgical face-masks and other respirators like the KN95 to high-

51

risk groups only.

Introduction

56
57

Several countries continue to encourage and/or enforce the wearing of face-masks in

58

public settings as a preventive measure to curb the acquisition and spread of the

59

coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that is caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory

60

Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (1–5). The use of face-masks in public settings

61

has been reported as a crucial preventive measure in limiting the acquisition and spread

62

of COVID-19 by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United States Centers

63

for Disease Control (CDC) (6,7).

64

Several published studies have shown that the use of face-masks in public settings can

65

limit the acquisition and spread of COVID-19, and has several advantages for example:

66

(i) strong sustainability, (ii) good health- and economic- benefits, and (iii) simple

operation (8–15). Other published studies have described face-masks as discernable

68

indications of the widely prevalent SARS-CoV-2, and as apparatuses that might be

69

exploited to remind the public of the importance of the other infection-control measures

70

for example maintaining social distancing and performing hand hygiene, and have also

71

recommended their use to limit the acquisition and spread of COVID-19 (16). In the same

72

study (16), face-masks have been described as symbols, beyond them being apparatuses,

73

face-masks have been described as talismans that can boost health-care workers’

74

perceived sense of safety, well-being, and trust in their health-care settings.

75

Although testing and contact tracing remain crucial in limiting the acquisition and spread

76

of COVID-19, designing, manufacturing and getting the public to wear face-masks seems

77

more achievable (17–20). Hence, the use of face-masks in public settings could be the

78

single most important- low hanging opportunity for limiting the acquisition and spread

79

of COVID-19 and could give the public the guarantee they yearn for to return our

80

societies back to life (17–20). Face-masks meant for use in public settings should have

81

good qualities for example a high filtration efficiency similar to those of the highly

82

effective respirators i.e. the N95 and KN95 respirators; face-masks equivalent to these

83

respirators may perhaps allow the public control over their own safety, a greater

84

incentive to use them, as well as the confidence to resume their day-to-day activities

85

(14,17).

Research article
86

The design of the face-masks for use in public settings should allow for: (i) protection that

87

could result from filtration and/or deflection i.e. how well potentially infectious aerosols

88

are blocked from passing through the face-masks as well as “fit” and leakage i.e. how

89

well the face-masks seal around the wearer’s face and prevent potentially infectious

90

aerosols from coming around them, while permitting breathed out air to vent efficiently

91

(17,21,22), (ii) scalability that is permitted by the design’s potential to utilize commonly

92

available materials that both commercial and non-commercial manufacturers can procure

93

in huge quantities (17), (iii) comfort that allows the wearers to use the face-masks for

94

extended durations of time without having to touch them or take them off too frequently

95

(17,23), (iv) re-usability to prevent the continuous need for new face-masks; face-masks

96

should be easy to clean, this would enable their repeated use (17,19,23), (v) style since the

97

wide-spread adoption of face-mask use could necessitate a significant cultural shift so

98

that they could become a seamless part of a “new normal”, could be enhanced by the use

99

of various logos and/or colors of individuals’ favorite sports teams and/or brands (17,23).

100

However, it is critical to note that designing and manufacturing such face-masks and

101

influencing the public to use them as one of the preventive measures to curb the

102

acquisition and spread of COVID-19 is not straight forward as it poses not only

103

engineering and manufacturing challenges but also marketing challenges that could

104

necessitate quite a lot of tradeoffs (17).

Research article
105

Also critical to note is that, not only did the outbreak of COVID-19 spark a major debate

106

about the efficacy of face-masks in general but it also exposed the inadequacy of existing

107

guidelines on the use of cloth face-masks, despite the wide spread use of these face-masks

108

in majority of the low- and middle- income countries especially in Africa as reported in

109

several studies (20,24–27). At the same time, the outbreak fashioned critical questions like

110

whether or not there was an adequate alternative to commercially manufactured face-

111

masks for example the N95, KN95 and surgical face-masks that could be made easily

112

available for populations in low- and middle- income settings especially in Africa (28).

113

At the time of writing, similar to a few other low- and middle- income countries in Africa,

114

Uganda was continuing to implement a phased-approach of lifting the countrywide

115

lockdown while considering the use of face-masks in public settings mandatory for all

116

(29). In light of this, many untested brands of cloth face-masks, potentially inadequate to

117

provide protection against COVID-19 could have flooded the Ugandan market hence

118

making it necessary to assess the safety and fitness-for-use of the different brands of cloth

119

face-masks that were commonly circulating on the Ugandan market during the COVID-

120

19 pandemic.

Hence this study aimed at testing and comparing various materials and forms of cloth

122

face-masks procured from face-mask vendors in Kampala, Uganda during the COVID-

123

19 pandemic; the testing was done to assess the: filtration efficiency, breathability,

124

microbial cleanliness, distance-dependent fitness, and re-usability of the cloth face-

125

masks. We hoped that the findings obtained from this study would assist health

126

organizations in Uganda and similar low- and middle- income settings in Africa to

127

develop policy on the use of cloth face-masks to prevent the transmission of COVID-19.

In-house breathability testing of the face-masks. Glass beakers that had been sealed

137

with surgical face-masks that had been obtained from both the community pharmacy and

138

street vendors, as well as the locally-made double-layered cloth face-masks with non-

elastic straps purposely for tying around the head showed a significant increase in weight

140

after the 24-hour duration of the testing. However, glass beakers that had been sealed

141

with surgical face-masks that had been obtained from the street vendors had a

142

significantly higher weight gain compared to those that had been obtained from the

143

been used in the testing after just a few sprays (<100 sprays). As the distance increased,

184

the number of sprays applied to each of the face-masks also increased. Noteworthy, the

185

number of sprays applied in the case of the surgical face-masks that had been obtained

186

from the street vendors for the volunteers to taste the reagent used in the testing increased

187

exponentially to ≥ 500 sprays at 2 meters. The number of sprays applied to the locally-

188

made double-layered cloth face-masks with non-elastic straps purposely for tying around

189

the head for the volunteers to taste the reagent used in the testing also increased steadily

190

till 2 meters at which point they increased exponentially passing the 500-spray mark at 3

191

meters. The number of sprays applied to the face-mask that had been made from thick

192

material with an elastic strap for attaching around the head for the volunteers to taste the

193

reagent used in the testing also increased steadily till 5 meters at which point they passed

194

the 500-spray mark. The number of sprays applied to all the single layered face-masks for

195

the volunteers to taste the reagent used in the testing increased steadily till 6 meters but

196

did not pass the 500-spray mark.

197

The surgical face-masks that had been bought from the street vendors passed the distance

198

dependent test at 2 meters, while the locally-made double-layered cloth face-masks

199

passed the same test at 3 meters, and the face-masks that were made from the thick

material with an elastic strap for attaching around the head passed the same test at 6

meters. All single-layered face-masks did not pass for distance dependent fitness test.

To the best of our knowledge this is the first study assessing the efficacy of face-masks in

271

Uganda. In this study, we analyzed the: filtration efficiency, breathability, microbial

272

cleanliness, distance-dependent fitness, and re-usability of different face-masks procured

273

from face-mask vendors in Kampala, Uganda during the COVID-19 pandemic.

274

This study answered questions like whether or not there was an adequate alternative to

275

imported commercially manufactured face-masks for example the KN95 and surgical

276

face-masks, through testing and comparing various materials and forms of face-masks.

277

The findings of this study could be beneficial for improving the uptake of face-masks by

278

the public in Uganda and similar low- and middle- income countries in Africa, as a key

279

intervention in preventing the transmission of COVID-19. In addition, the findings of this

280

study unmasked the potential of a locally-made face-mask to offer an alternative to

281

imported commercially manufactured face-masks in providing protection against

282

COVID-19, and hence inspires efforts geared towards local production of face-masks not

283

only in Uganda but also in other low- and middle- income countries in Africa.

284

The increased local-production of face-masks could translate into increased supply and

285

availability or accessibility which could address future shortages, as well as ensure

286

reasonable prices of the face-masks. Increased local-production could also enable

287

prioritizing and limiting the use of KN95 and surgical face-masks to frontline clinicians

288

and essential health-care workers.

Research article
289

This study’s finding where surgical face-masks purchased from either the community

290

pharmacy or street vendors had better filtration efficiency and breathability than any

291

other type of face-masks that had been tested are consistent with the findings of related

292

studies. These studies (30–32), alluded to the effectiveness of surgical face-masks in

293

offering protection against infectious aerosols for example SARS-CoV-2 while attributing

294

this to their good qualities of filtration and breathability. However, this finding is

295

inconsistent with those of other studies (33–35), that reported filtration limitations of

296

surgical face-masks which could negatively affect the ability of these face-masks to offer

297

protection to the wearers against infectious aerosols for example SARS-CoV-2 especially

298

during coughs by infected patients.

299

Above and beyond the apparent imperfect filtration efficiency and breathability of

300

surgical face-masks, several observational studies have found no significant benefits of

301

other respirators (i.e. the N95 and KN95) over these face-masks and have indicated the

302

ability of these face-masks to not only offer protection against infectious aerosols for

303

example SARS-CoV-2 but to also offer a cheaper alternative to the other respirators (i.e.

304

the N95 and KN95), which have been reported to offer better protection than the surgical

305

face-masks (30,36–39). Therefore, despite the limitations of surgical face-masks there

306

remains reason for optimism regarding their real-world effectiveness.

307

The differences in performance of the surgical face-masks that had been obtained from

308

the community pharmacy and the street vendors reported in this study could be due to

309

the differences in the manufacturing enterprises of these face-masks. Different

310

manufacturing enterprises use different materials in production and this could lead to

311

differences in the performance of the face-masks they produce. A similar line of thinking

312

has been documented by related studies (40). In these studies, surgical face-masks were

313

reported to provide different levels of protection against infectious aerosols particularly

314

when they were produced from different enterprises.

315

The rapid growth in consumer demand for sustainable face-masks represents an

316

enormous opportunity for small-scale enterprises in low- and middle- income countries.

317

We believe that providing assistance to these small-scale enterprises could enable them

318

to seize the opportunity and significantly improve the quality of the face-masks they

319

produce. This could also consequently result in the reduction of the differences in the

320

face-masks thereby creating more homogeneity in performance of the face-masks.

321

Global and local shortages of respirators and surgical face-masks have been reported by

322

several studies (37,41). These shortages have caused the extended use or re-use of

323

respirators as well as surgical face-masks designed for single-use (37,41–43). To ease the

324

shortage of respirators and surgical face-masks, many individuals continue to explore

325

non-standard methods to maintaining an adequate supply including among others face-

326

mask decontamination, which could extend the wearable life of the face-masks beyond

327

the expiration date, and procuring of the more costly respirators i.e. KN95 and N95 (37).

328

However, the findings of this study indicate that the decontamination of surgical face24

329

masks obtained from both the community pharmacy and street vendors using 70%

330

ethanol negatively affected the general efficacy of these face-masks. These negative

331

effects could have been due to the 70% ethanol destroying the structural integrity of the

332

surgical face-masks, a thinking that has also been shared in related studies (43–45). These

333

studies have also reported the potential of using other decontamination methods for

334

example using vaporized hydrogen peroxide and ultraviolet germicidal irradiation

335

(41,46–48). However, basing on the evidence generated in this study about the negative

336

effects on the efficacy when decontamination of surgical face-masks is done with 70%

337

ethanol, as well as the alternative potential decontamination approaches provided by

338

related studies, but which have been also documented to be labor intensive and

339

expensive (47), hence likely to be unaffordable by majority of the population and health-

340

care systems in low- and middle- income countries, health-care organizations for

341

example ministries of health in these countries could ensure that policies as well as

342

systems are put in place to ensure that decontamination practices are carried out safely

343

and in line with existing evidence. Also, these organizations could ensure that the

344

available surgical face-masks are restricted for use to only the frontline clinicians and

345

essential health-care workers to reduce the requirements for re- use and extended use of

346

the surgical face-masks.

347

The findings in which locally made, double layered cloth face-masks were found to

348

provide the best alternatives to surgical face-masks could be related to those of related

studies (14,28). In these studies, testing of face-masks that had been made from two layers

350

of quilt fabric with household paper towels as filters was done, the face-masks tested in

351

these studies were reported to be viable alternatives to surgical face-masks and other

352

respirators like the KN95 and N95 in providing protection to the users against infectious

353

aerosols. Despite the fact that these studies acknowledged the superiority of surgical face-

354

masks over cloth face-masks, they highlighted that the use of these face-masks was

355

severalfold more effective than not wearing a face-mask at all.

356

As the world with particularly low- and middle- income settings standing to benefit the

357

most, seek cheaper approaches of achieving mask decontamination as reported in related

358

studies (47), this study’s findings that demonstrated the potential of decontaminating

359

locally made, double layered cloth face-masks utilizing cheaper local methods and the

360

ability of the locally made, double layered cloth face-masks to maintain their structural

361

integrity and hence efficacy despite the different methods of decontamination the face-

362

masks had been subjected to are of great importance. These findings imply, that once

363

procured, these face-masks can be used and re- usable or used for extended durations of

364

time while decontaminating the face-masks with the documented approaches unlike in

365

the case of surgical face-masks. The findings could also imply that locally made, double

366

layered cloth face-masks when availed and used could improve the uptake of face-masks

367

by the public in Uganda and similar low- and middle- income countries in Africa, as a

368

key intervention in preventing the transmission of COVID-19. Also, similar to other the

findings of related studies (49,50), these findings reinforce the potential for local mass

370

production of protective face-masks by likely non- experts utilizing the available

371

resources through policy information as well as call for the updating of national

372

guidelines to provide clear and consistent criteria to ensure the widest availability and

373

appropriate use of face-masks, while bearing in mind populations in social

374

disadvantaged or low- and middle- settings.

375

Our results demonstrated that locally made, double layered cloth face-masks can be

376

effectively decontaminated using various approaches while maintaining their structural

377

integrity which means maintaining their ability of provide protection to the wearer

378

against infectious aerosols. Given the Ugandan government recommendation that cloth

379

face-masks should be worn in public settings, decontamination using ordinary soap and

380

drying under the sun with or without ironing could provide cheaper, safe and effective

381

decontamination of cloth face-masks.

382

Regarding microbial cleanliness of the face-masks, of note we found no significant

383

difference between the counts as well as the types of microorganisms that had been

384

isolated from the inner- and outer surfaces of the face-masks that had been tested in this

385

study. These finding are inconsistent with those of related studies, that reported having

386

found a greater contamination of on the outer- surfaces of the face-masks with

387

microorganisms as compared to the inner- surfaces of the same face-masks (35).

Coagulase negative staphylococcus remain known members of the normal flora of the

389

human skin, nasal and oral cavity (51–53). The isolation of coagulase negative

390

staphylococcus from the inner- and outer- surfaces of face-masks in this study could be

391

attributed to several factors that could include among others: face-masks aerodynamic

392

features that could result in a turbulent jet due to leakage of air around the edge of the

393

face-mask that could consequently contaminate the outer- surfaces of the face-mask, a

394

thought shared by related studies (35) , as well as the possibility that the bacteria could

395

have: been picked or originated from the skin, oral, nasal cavities of the wearers or even

396

their hands during contact with the face-masks (53,54). These findings hence support the

397

importance of hand hygiene after touching the surfaces of face-masks to ensure

398

microbiological cleanliness of the face-masks.

399

Our study had strength and limitations; (i) the strength of the study is that, in absence of

400

documented protocols, the study was able to develop, test and optimize protocols to

401

successfully perform the testing of the face-masks, protocols which could also be adapted

402

as templates for the development of more comprehensive protocols, (ii) despite the fact

403

that the size and concentrations of the SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols generated during coughs

404

by infected patients are unkown, the sizes of aerosols generated by our hand-held sprayer

405

especially at different distances were not determined, this leaves a gap in the information

406

regarding whether or not the face-masks tested would offer adequate protection against

407

automated aerosol generation to continuously produce aerosols in the testing, however,

409

in this study, we used hand-held sprayers whose aerosol generation depends on the

410

number of squeezes made by the operator, (iv) despite measuring environmental

411

temperature and humidity since they have been documented to affect the evaporation of

412

the generated aerosols during ordinary exhalation, talking and singing, the wind speed

413

was not catered for during this study and is likely to have affected the aerosol

Conclusions

416
417

This study described workable protocols to evaluate the efficacy of face-masks. This

418

study also demonstrated limitations of surgical face-masks in the context of re-usability,

419

although they are to a higher extent protective. In addition, this study also demonstrated

420

the potential of locally-made double layered cloth face-masks to serve as cheaper face-

421

mask alternatives especially for populations in Uganda. Unmasking the potential of the

422

locally-made double layered cloth face-masks allows for the limited use of surgical face-

423

masks to high-risk groups. Lastly, the study demonstrated the need to boost local

424

production of face-masks by small-scale enterprises with support of relevant government

425

ministries.

Semi-quantitative mask fitness testing. This was performed using saccharin solution.

448

Saccharin is a non-nutritive sweetener of 1,2-benzoisothiazol-3-(2H)-one and is about

449

300- 400 times sweeter than sucrose (55,56). It is less soluble in water in its natural form

450

and hence it is conjugated with either sodium or calcium salt to improve on the solubility

451

(55,56). Even though saccharin has not been reported to be tasted differently, research on

452

various artificial sweeteners has reported that they may elicit different responses upon

453

interaction with the sweet taste receptor, and as such, there is therefore a possibility of

454

people having different tasting thresholds for saccharin (57).

455

The sensitivity testing protocol was adopted from 3M Center for Respiratory Protection,

456

United States (58). While preparing for the testing, efforts were made to ensure that the

457

study volunteers did not eat or drink anything, 30 minutes before the testing except for

458

drinking water. The testing hood was assembled by fitting it onto the collar of the study

459

volunteers, making a 10 cm ‘gap’ between the study volunteers’ faces and the inside

460

surface of the hood. The nebulizers were prepared and about 10 mls of saccharin

461

sensitivity and test solutions were added to their respective nebulizers. Sensitivity testing

462

and test experiments were then performed. The sensitivity testing was performed to

463

ensure that the study volunteers could taste the saccharin solution before carrying out

464

the test experiments. Before nebulizing, the study volunteers were instructed to breathe

465

through the mouth with the tongue slightly out, so that they could be able to taste the

466

saccharin. During the fit testing, the study volunteers were instructed to breathe: (i)

down, (v) while bending over or bending at the waist, (vi) while talking, and (vii) to

469

breathe normally again. When saccharin was not tasted by the study volunteers; the test

470

was considered as ‘passed’ or ‘successful’ while the test was considered as ‘failed’ or

471

‘unsuccessful’ when the saccharin was tasted by the study volunteers. Despite, the ‘failed’

472

test, the number of squeezes applied for the study volunteers to taste the saccharin were

473

recorded. The test was recorded as completely ‘failed’ or ‘unsuccessful’ after repeat

474

testing had been done and the saccharin was tasted while the same face-mask was being

475

worn.

476

In-house filtration efficiency. In the testing, a 0.5 McFarland bacterial suspension of

477

Mycobacterium smegmatis was prepared and later transferred into a multi-purpose hand-

478

held sprayer that was used to generate a steady stream of aerosols. A vacuum filtration

479

unit was constructed in-house and set up in a biosafety cabinet. All items in the biosafety

480

cabinet were thoroughly disinfected using 5% Lysol and 70% ethanol. The in-built filter

481

of the vacuum filtration unit was aseptically removed and replaced with the test filters

482

(sections of the face-masks). The negative control protocol was performed by running the

483

vacuum pump for 30 minutes without aerosol generation and the filtered air was

484

inoculated on 7H11 agar media. The different face-masks were tested by maintaining a

485

steady stream of aerosols of Mycobacterium smegmatis for 30 minutes directed towards the

486

vacuum filtration unit having the face-mask sections and the filtered air was inoculated

on 7H11 agar media. The positive control protocol was performed by maintaining a

488

steady stream of aerosols of Mycobacterium smegmatis for 30 minutes without any

489

filtration and inoculating the air/aerosols on 7H11 agar media. The inoculated agar plates

490

were sealed with micropore tape and incubated at 37°C for 3 days. The filtration

491

efficiency was assessed by comparing the growth on the plates for the positive control

492

with those of the test face-masks.

493

In-house breathability testing. In the testing, the ASTM E96 water vapor testing protocol

494

specifically the desiccant method was adapted (59). In the testing, a glass beaker was

495

almost filled with a solid desiccant (anhydrous calcium chloride granules) and then

496

covered with the sections of the test face-masks leaving a very small air space between

497

the desiccant and the sections of the test face-masks. The sections of the test face-masks

498

were properly sealed to the edge of the glass beaker to prevent side diffusion. The initial

499

weight of the glass beaker containing the calcium chloride granules was then taken. The

500

glass beaker was then placed in an environment where the environmental -humidity and

501

-temperature were constantly monitored and recorded. The glass beaker containing the

502

calcium chloride granules was then weighed after 2 hours and the gain in weight of the

503

set-up was extrapolated to provide data on the moisture passing through the fabric in a

504

day (i.e. 24 hours). A positive control glass beaker containing calcium chloride was

505

included. This was left uncovered for the entire duration of the experiment. The

506

permeability of the face-masks was categorized as ‘low’, ‘moderate’ or ‘high’.

In-house microbial cleanliness testing. This testing was performed after the study

508

volunteers had used each of the face-mask for the fitness testing. After the fitness testing,

509

each of the face-masks was aseptically removed from the study volunteers faces and the

510

outer and inner surfaces of each of the used face-masks were swabbed in that order with

511

sterile cotton swabs made slightly wet with physiological saline while focusing on the

512

sites where the nose and mouth would typically be positioned. The contents of the swabs

513

were then inoculated onto Blood agar and MacConkey agar. Both culture media were

514

then incubated aerobically, at 35°C ± 2°C for 24 hours. All growth was enumerated and

515

identified per the face-mask tested and the results recorded. The identification of target

516

gram-positive bacteria (i.e. Staphylococcus spp) was done using recommended biochemical

517

tests: DNase, mannitol salt fermentation after performing gram-stain microscopy,

518

catalase, slide and tube coagulase tests.

519

In-house distance dependent fit testing. In this testing: (i) care was taken to ensure that

520

the study volunteers had no facial hair and that they did not eat or drink anything except

521

drinking water in the 30 minutes before the start of the testing, (ii) the nebulizers (hand-

522

held sprayers) were prepared and saccharin sensitivity and test solutions were added to

523

their respective nebulizers, (iii) sensitivity testing was performed with the study

524

volunteers not wearing face-masks, while standing stationery at 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 meters, to

525

ensure that the study volunteers could taste the saccharin sensitivity solution at the

526

different distances. At distances and beyond which the saccharin sensitivity solution was

not tasted by the study volunteers, testing with the saccharin test solution was not

528

performed. The saccharin test solution was tested after the study volunteers wore the test

529

face-masks at stood stationery at the distances where the saccharin sensitivity solution

530

had been tasted by the same individuals. During the testing, particularly before

531

nebulizing, the study volunteers were instructed to breathe through the mouth with the

532

tongue slightly out, so that they could ably taste the saccharin. During the testing, the

533

volunteers were instructed to breathe: (i) normally, (ii) deeply, (iii) while moving their

534

head side-to-side, (iv) while moving their head up and down, (v) while bending over or

535

bending at the waist, (vi) while talking, (vii) and to breathe normally again. When

536

saccharin was not tasted at the respective distances; the test was considered as ‘passed’

537

or ‘successful’ while the test was considered as ‘failed’ or ‘unsuccessful’ when the

538

saccharin was tasted at the respective distances. Despite, the ‘failed’ test, the number of

539

squeezes to tasting the saccharin were recorded. The test was recorded as completely

540

‘failed’ or ‘unsuccessful’ after repeat testing was done and the saccharin was tasted while

541

the same face-mask were being worn.

542

In-house face-mask re-usability testing. In the testing, each of the face-masks was

543

subjected to 3 decontamination methods that included: (i) spraying the face-masks with

544

70% ethanol and drying under the sun particularly for the non-reusable face-masks, (ii)

545

washing the face-masks with non-bacterial soap and drying them under the sun, (iii) and,

Data management and analysis. Data from the collection forms previously validated by

553

the study principal investigators and the laboratory team was entered and cleaned using

554

MS Excel 2016 and analyzed using Stata 14.0, a statistical software. Descriptive analyses

555

such as proportions, and means (where appropriate) were performed. In-house face-

556

mask filtration efficiency was determined by counting the number of colony forming

557

units (CFUs) on the test culture plates similar to those on the positive control culture

558

plates. Analysis of variance was used to assess the association between the face-mask

559

types and average increase in weight and humidity to determine which face-mask had

560

the best breathability. The statistical significance levels were two-sided at p<0.05 (95%

561

CI). Graphs were plotted using excel and Stata 14.0 where appropriate to describe the

562

data.
