Full Title: Hospital based contact tracing of COVID-19 patients and health care
workers and risk stratification of exposed health care workers during the COVID-19
pandemic in Eastern India

Abstract
Introduction
Contact tracing and subsequent quarantining of Health Care Workers (HCWs) is essential to
minimize further transmission of COVID-19 infection. In this study, we have reported the
yield of Contact Tracing of COVID-19 Patients and HCWs and risk stratification of exposed
HCWs.
Methodology
This is a secondary analysis of routine data collected for contact tracing from 19th March to
31st August 2020 at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India.
HCWs exposed to COVID-19 infections were categorized as per the risk stratification
guidelines and the high-risk contacts were quarantined for 14 days and tested on 7th day from
last day of exposure. The low risk contacts were encouraged to closely monitor their
symptoms while continuing to work.
Results
Out of 3411 HCWs exposed to COVID 19 patients (n=269) and HCWs (n=91), 890 (26.1%)
were high risk contacts and 2521 (73.9%) were low risk contacts. The test positivity rate of
high-risk contact was 3.82% and for low risk contact was 1.90%. Average number of high-

risk contacts was significantly higher; for admitted patients (6.6) as compared to HCWs (4.0)
and outpatients (0.2), p value = 0.009; for patients admitted in non-COVID areas (15.8) as
compared to COVID areas (0.27), p value < 0.001; and when clustering of cases was present
(14.3) as compared to isolated cases (8.2); p value < 0.001. Trend analysis (15 days block
period) showed a significant decline in number of mean numbers of high-risk contacts during
the study period.
Conclusion
Contact tracing and risk stratification was effective and helped in reducing the number of
HCWs going for quarantine. There was also a decline in high-risk contacts during study
period suggesting role of implementation of hospital based COVID related infection control
strategies. This contact tracing and risk stratification approach designed in the current study
can also be implemented in other healthcare settings.

Introduction
With 44 million confirmed cases and over one million confirmed deaths affecting all the
countries across the world, COVID-19 is currently the largest pandemics of the century [1].
In India, the number of cases are more than 8 million and deaths are beyond one lakh [2].
As of 21 April 2020, countries reported to World Health Organization (WHO) that over 90,
000 health care workers (HCWs) were infected with COVID-19. This number may be
significantly higher because of underreporting [3]. COVID-19 Infection among HCWs not
only possesses risk of infection to their family members thus contributing to community
spread but also to other HCWs and patients. Thus, apart from stringent infection control
practices to reduce the exposure to infection, contact tracing and subsequent quarantine of
HCWs is essential to minimize further transmission. Consequently, isolation after COVID-19
infection and quarantine following exposure to a confirmed case of COVID-19 can adversely
reduce the availability of human resources. To mitigate the shortage of staff in hospitals,
WHO and Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have given recommendations to
stratify the risk following exposure into two categories viz. low risk exposure and high-risk
exposure [4,5]. Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW), Government of India has
also adopted these guidelines [6]. In our hospital which caters to both COVID-19 patients and
other patients, we adopted the contact tracing and risk stratification approach based on these
guidelines to categorize exposed HCWs into high and low-risk contacts. In this paper, we

have reported the yield of hospital-based contact tracing of patients and HCWs tested positive
for COVID-19 and risk stratification of exposed HCWs in the hospital a statutory body under
the aegis of MOHFW, Government of India.

Materials and methods
Study design
This is a secondary analysis of routine data collected from 19th March to 31st August 2020
during the process of contact tracing and laboratory data related to COVID-19 at the study
site.
Study site
The study was conducted at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Bhubaneswar,
which is a 960 bedded tertiary care teaching hospital located in Bhubaneswar, the capital city
of Odisha, an Eastern state of India.
COVID-19 related clinical services at study site
Patients reporting to the hospital were screened for COVID-19 as per the screening algorithm
depicted in Fig 1. COVID-19 screening with Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain
Reaction (RT-PCR) test of all the newly admitted patients, irrespective of presence of
symptoms, started from 15th June 2020. On 19th March 2020, the first patient (second case of
Odisha) with COVID-19 was admitted in our hospital. Patients presenting with symptoms
consistent with COVID-19 and confirmed cases of COVID-19 were admitted in separate
dedicated wards called “COVID-19 ward or COVID area”. From July 10th onwards, routine
outpatient consultation was discontinued due to sudden surge in COVID-19 cases in
community and hospital. Hospital admission was restricted to only COVID-19 patients and
patients requiring emergency or essential intervention.

COVID-19 related prevention interventions at study site
Various training programs were conducted to train all cadre of HCWs regarding proper use of
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), hand hygiene measures and other infection control
practices. Use of type of PPE in different clinical areas and hospital premises was guided by
MOHFW protocol and upgraded or modified based on feedback received from contact
tracing or infection control team. Advisories were issued to all HCWs at periodic intervals for
PPE compliance and infection control measures We also introduced various behavioral and
regulatory interventions to promote COVID appropriate behaviors, for example monetary
penalty for not using mask in hospital and residential campuses.

Study Procedures
As per the testing strategy outlined in Fig 2, testing for SARS-CoV-2 using RT-PCR method
was performed at COVID-19 RTPCR testing laboratory of institute, an approved laboratory
by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Government of India. Contact tracing of
laboratory confirmed COVID-19 patient, was initiated by a team dedicated for contact tracing
immediately after intimation from diagnostic laboratory. Initially, contact tracing was done
by physically visiting the clinical areas, personally interviewing the HCWs involved in
patient care, reviewing medical records of patients, duty rosters and viewing CCTV footage.
However, the strategy was modified with increase in number of cases to a passive mechanism
of contact tracing. In later phase (from July 15 onwards), Contact Tracing Team (CTT)
intimated the concerned departments to provide list of all HCWs who had possibly come in
contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases in a prescribed format. Upon obtaining the list of
exposed HCWs, the CTT contacted each HCW telephonically to elicit history related to
duration and type of exposure, procedures performed on the patient, use of personal

protective equipment during exposure etc. In case of contact tracing related to HCW being a
confirmed case of COVID-19, history related to interactions during duty break hours, during
meals, and other places where HCW is likely to be less cautious regarding mask usage was
probed while contact tracing. Contacts in last 14 days from the date of positive report was
considered for contact tracing. Risk categorization (low risk exposure and high-risk exposure)
as per the criteria adopted using WHO, CDC and MOHFW guidelines as given in Box 1. A
14 days home quarantine and COVID-19 testing on 7th day of last exposure was
recommended for HCWs having high risk exposure whereas HCWs having low risk exposure
were recommended to continue the work. The quarantine period was considered as fully paid
on-duty period. Both the risk categories were required to monitor for symptoms and report
for COVID-19 testing on appearance of symptoms consistent with COVID-19. In absence of
symptoms, routine testing was not recommended for low risk contacts. However, few HCWs
having low risk exposure were also tested based on their request. We collated data related to
contact tracing and risk categorization in excel spreadsheet and follow up of HCWs was done
to enquire about symptoms and test results. CTT regularly updated hospital authorities about
their findings related to breach in infection control practices and areas of high-risk contacts
and suggested specific recommendations. Ethical approval to conduct this study was obtained
from Institutional Ethics Committee of AIIMS, Bhubaneswar. (Reference number: T/IMNF/CMFM/20/76)

standard deviation) and percentage (± 95% confidence interval). Patients with COVID-19
were categorized into inpatient, outpatients and HCW tested positive for COVID-19.
Inpatients were further categorized based on area where they were admitted i.e. COVID area
or non-COVID areas. Clustering of cases was defined as diagnosis of more than two patients
with COVID-19 on a single day from a non-COVID area. When a cluster was present, the
total number of high risk and low risks were considered for each patient for comparison
between groups and for descriptive analysis the overall high risk and low risk cases were
considered. For example, if there was a cluster of 5 cases with 10 high risk contacts, then for
comparison analysis 50 high risk contacts were considered while for descriptive analysis the
count remains as 10. Mean number (± standard deviation) of high-risk contacts and low-risk
contacts were compared with respect to type of patient (i.e. admitted patient in COVID area,
admitted patient in non-COVID area, outpatient, HCW) and clustering of cases, time period
of 15 days from the date of admission of first patient.

Results
This analysis included data related to 360 COVID-19 patients reported during the study
period which included 240 (66.7%) admitted patients or Inpatient Department (IPD), 29
(8.1%) Outpatient Department (OPD) and 91 (25.3%) HCWs. Out of 269 IPD and OPD
patients, 163 (60.6%) were admitted directly to COVID-19 areas, 97 (36.1%) were admitted
in non-COVID areas and rest 9 (3.3%) had stayed in both COVID and non-COVID areas.
(Table 1). Out of the 97 cases diagnosed in non-COVID areas, 56 presented in a cluster; with
one cluster each of 12, 10, 4, 3 cases, two cluster with 6 cases, and three cluster with five
cases each.

reduced from 12.7 during 1-15 June to 3.7 during 1-15 July and to 0.62 during 16-31 August
(first case of HCW of hospital tested positive for COVID-19 on 2nd June 2020). (Fig 3a and
3b) Similarly, for patient admitted in COVID area, number of high-risk contacts was 10.0 for
the only patient admitted till 31st March; which reduced to a mean of 1.0 during 1st April to
15th June and further to less than 0.1 after 15th June. In non-COVID areas, mean number of
high-risk contacts reduced from 31.5 (during 16-30 June) to 3.0 (during 16-31 July) and
further to 0.7 (during 16-31 August). (Fig 3c and 3d)

Interview with HCWs during contact tracing revealed that common causes for a high-risk
exposure while providing clinical care was inadequate use of PPE and non-practicing of hand
hygiene measures after direct contact with patient. Whereas, in case of a positive HCW,
social interactions during meals and nursing stations during duty hours, hand over, travelling
and staying together etc. contributed for majority of high-risk exposures

Discussion
Our forward contact tracing of 360 patients and HCWs with COVID-19 encountered in the
hospital during March-August 2020, revealed 3411 HCWs exposed to these patients. In our
study, one fourth of exposed HCWs were stratified into high risk category and positivity rate
for COVID-19 infection among them was 3.8% as compared to 1.9% among low risk

contacts. We also observed a gradual decline in average number of high risk contact over the
period of time. HCWs were more likely to be exposed when COVID-19 Infection was
diagnosed among HCW and patient admitted in a non COVID area.
Few studies from India have also reported a similar proportion of high risk contact after risk
stratification. In a study conducted in a hospital located in eastern part of India by Agarwal N
et al where 25% of the exposed HCWs were high risk contacts [7]. However, this study had a
small sample size. Another study conducted by Kaur R et al in a hospital located in northern
part of India where only 14.5% of the exposed HCWs were categorized into high risk
contacts. Our study reported a test positivity rate of 3.82% amongst high risk contacts while
the study conducted by Kaur R et al observed higher test positivity rate of 7.1% [8]. In this
study by Kaur et al, most of the COVID 19 patients (almost 85%) were HCW unlike our
study where 25% of COVID-19 patients were HCW. Moreover, higher test positivity rate in
this study could be due to more stringent criteria of stratifying into high risk category as
proportion of high risk contact in this study was only 14% out of total exposed HCWs.
Another study conducted by Blain H et al, observed high positivity rate amongst health care
personnel (23.5%) but the study was conducted only for three COVID-19 positive cases [9].
In our study one index case had 10 high risk contacts on an average, while a study conducted
by Vera C et al in Switzerland reported 21 high-risk contacts which was much higher as
compared to our study [10]. This study from Switzerland was based on just one initially
undiagnosed COVID-19 case.
We also observed a clear differential in the positivity rate among high-risk contacts and lowrisk contacts (3.8% Vs 1.9%) which demonstrated the effectiveness of risk stratification
strategy. Since, positivity rate among low risk contacts was also 1.9%, we ensured testing
among low risk contacts, even if asymptomatic. Though, exposure to infection in low risk

contact could also be from other sources as unlike high risk contacts, they were not
quarantined and continued to work.

Number of high-risk contacts was highest when patient was admitted in non-COVID area
(15.1) as compared to COVID area (0.3). This might be because, in COVID area HCWs were
completely equipped with PPE while in non-COVID area they were with only surgical
masks/N95 masks and or gloves as per the guidelines proposed by MOHFW, WHO and CDC
and admitted patient was not a COVID-19 suspect. Since the admission was done on the basis
of the history and signs and symptoms and after admission the testing was done to find out
the RT-PCR status, during that period there was a high chance of exposure with the patients
till the results of RT-PCR came.

The number of average high-risk contacts was higher (14.3) when there was a cluster of cases
(2.6) as there was a chance that the whole department might be involved in patient care as the
patients are more and hence there as compared to individual isolated cases. Similarly, the
number of high-risk cases was more amongst admitted patients followed by HCWs and
outpatients; as in IPD, the staffs perform their duties shift wise (three shifts in a day) as
compared to OPD where there was only one shift. So, the chances of contamination were
more. Also, a greater number of HCWs are engaged in clinical care activities in in-patient
areas than in out-patient areas. The high-risk contacts of HCWs might be because of social
mixing with the colleagues during the duty time and in residential areas. Thus, stringent
infection control measures also need to be adopted in areas where patients are admitted which
are not suspected of COVID-19.

Trend analysis showed a significant reduction in number of high-risk cases in all groups like
COVID areas, Non-COVID areas, IPD, OPD and amongst HCWs, which reflects timely
modification of infection control measures and strict implementation of PPE protocol and

training of HCWs related to infection control which was implemented in hospital. Similar
results were observed in a study conducted by Hidayat R et al in Indonesia in a COVID-19
referral hospital, where the secondary attack rate among HCWs declined with time from
20.1% to 3.7% [11]. However, at the same time there was decline in total exposed contacts
(low-risk and high-risk combined) which might be indicative of either fatigue in contact
tracing activity both in contact tracing team and the departments where COVID-19 patients
were detected or human resource rationing (this included modification of duty rosters, less
rotation of HCWs between different units) which was adopted as the pandemic progressed.

Contact tracing team based on enquiry from exposed HCWs also provided regular feedback
to the hospital administration to augment infection control measures, identified areas of
frequent breach in protocol, and suggested mechanism for reducing exposure to COVID-19.
Apart from quarantine, regular feedback-based action might have helped in reducing
exposure to COVID-19 infection in the hospital.

Contact tracing is a time and resource intensive exercise in both community settings as well
as hospital settings. However, it is one of the most important tools for infectious disease
prevention. In our hospital we used different methods described in literature for identifying
the contacts exposed to COVID-19 patients like CCTV footage, duty rosters, and passive
reporting by departments and telephonic enquiry. Contact tracing by data extraction from
administrative and clinical databases such as electronic medical records (EMRs) or by CCTV
footage (real-time locating system) have been reported previously [12,13]. Though,
conventional contact tracing by continuous direct observation has been considered to be the
gold standard method to accurately quantify contact time, however it requires intensive
human resources and is not cost effective [14]. Self-reporting methods can be been used as

alternatives to direct observation due to the lower intensity of their human resource demands.
However, there is a chance of bias that compromise the accuracy of the data [15].

Strengths

Since multiple strategies were employed like visiting the clinical area, personal interview of
the HCWs, reviewing medical records, viewing CCTV footage etc., we expect that all the
possible contacts were listed, tracked and categorized properly as it was performed by trained
personnel and verified by experts. Thus, the quality of the data was expected to be
satisfactory. Testing for COVID-19 was performed in an ICMR approved testing center by
RTPCR which is considered as the gold standard. Continuous monitoring until 14 days of last
exposure was done for all high-risk cases and testing was done on 7th day.

Limitations

Categorization of risk was based on the history by the contacts which may lead to high
chances of social desirability bias. There was a chance of misinformation where the hospital
staffs deliberately want to be in high risk categories so that a quarantine period of 14 days
could be availed by them as paid on-duty leave. There was also a chance of misinformation
due to wrong recall. Sometimes the HCWs fail to remember the patient and their PPE status
during patient care. Low risk contacts were not tested as a routine unless symptomatic which
could heave missed some cases as many of COVID-19 patients remain asymptomatic or
paucisymptomatic.

Conclusion
Contact tracing and risk stratification was effective and helped in reducing the number of
HCWs going for quarantine. There was a decline in high-risk contacts during study period
suggesting role of implementation of hospital based COVID related infection control

strategies. Findings obtained during contact tracing might also be beneficial in mounting
appropriate and strategic infection control measures. This contact tracing and risk
stratification approach designed in the current study can also be implemented in other
healthcare settings.
