ABSTRACT
Background
As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to cause substantial morbidity and mortality,
there is an increased need for rapid, accessible assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection.

Methods
Here we present a clinical evaluation and real-world implementation of the
INDICAID™ COVID-19 Rapid Antigen Test (INDICAID™ Rapid Test). A multi-site
clinical evaluation of the INDICAID™ Rapid Test using prospectively collected
samples from symptomatic subjects was performed. The INDICAID™ Rapid Test
was then implemented at COVID-19 outbreak screening centers in Hong Kong to
screen individuals for COVID-19 to prioritize confirmatory RT-PCR testing among
asymptomatic populations.

Results
The clinical evaluation in symptomatic patient populations demonstrated a positive
percent agreement and negative percent agreement of 85.3% (95% confidence
interval [95% CI]: 75.6% - 91.6%) and 94.9% (95% CI: 91.6% - 96.9%), respectively,
when compared to laboratory-based RT-PCR testing. When used during outbreak
testing of 22,994 asymptomatic patients, the INDICAID™ Rapid Test demonstrated a
positive percent agreement of 84.2% (95% CI: 69.6% - 92.6%) and a negative
percent agreement of 99.9% (95% CI: 99.9% - 100%) compared to laboratory-based
RT-PCR testing. When incorporated in a testing algorithm, the INDICAID™ Rapid
Test reduced time to confirmatory positive result from an average 10.85 hours
(standard RT-PCR only) to 0.84 hours, depending on the algorithm.

INTRODUCTION – 254 words
The global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has continued despite implementation of
significant public health measures [1]. Over 155 million worldwide cases of COVID19 and over 3 million COVID-19 deaths have been reported as of May 2021. Rapid
identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection, patient isolation, and contact tracing are
essential for disease containment [2].
The current gold standard for detecting SARS-CoV-2 is reverse-transcriptase
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [3]. While RT-PCR can detect nucleic acids
from SARS-CoV-2 with high sensitivity, RT-PCR requires equipment, special
training, and can take days until results are available following sample collection [4].
Due to the uniquely high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 (basic reproductive number
R0 of 2.87), long turnaround times for results may lead to a high number of avoidable
transmissions [5][6].
In contrast, lateral flow immunoassays (LFAs) are an inexpensive testing solution
that can be used at point-of-care settings, do not require laboratory equipment, and
can generate results quickly. However, the performance of LFA-based SARS-CoV-2
rapid antigen tests in community testing settings can vary significantly [7–9].
In this study, we evaluated the clinical performance of the LFA-based INDICAID™
COVID-19 Rapid Antigen Test (INDICAID™ Rapid Test) by PHASE Scientific
International Ltd. A prospective multi-site clinical study was performed in
symptomatic patient populations in point-of-care (POC) community testing sites in
the United States. The performance of the INDICAID™ Rapid Test was also
evaluated in COVID-19 outbreak screening centers in Hong Kong as a part of an

algorithm testing approach (termed “Dual-Track”) to screen for COVID-19 positive
patients prior to RT-PCR testing in asymptomatic patient populations.

METHODS
Description of the INDICAID™ COVID-19 Rapid Antigen Test
The INDICAID™ Rapid Test by PHASE Scientific is a LFA designed for the
qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein in nasal swab samples.
The test produces a simple readout within 20 minutes with the presence of a visible
test line to indicate detection of the SARS-CoV-2 antigen. In contrast to other readerbased rapid antigen platforms, the INDICAID™ Rapid Test achieves results without
any additional equipment, power source, or training.

Sample collection and procedure of the INDICAID™ COVID-19 Rapid Antigen Test
To conduct an INDICAID™ Rapid Test, a nasal swab sample is collected by
inserting the provided swab 1 inch into the nasal cavity. The swab is rubbed against
the inside walls of both nostrils 5 times in a large circular path. The swab is then
dipped into a buffer solution to elute the sample. Finally, three drops of the buffer
solution-specimen mix are applied to the LFA test device. After 20 minutes, the user
observes the test device for the presence or absence of a test line that indicates
detection of the SARS-CoV-2 antigen. An Internal Quality Control line is included to
indicate whether the test has been performed correctly.

Populations and study locations
Between November 30, 2020 and January 8, 2021, study participants were enrolled
at two US clinical sites, CityHealth Urgent Care San Francisco, CA and CityHealth
Urgent Care Oakland, CA.

As part of the inclusion criteria, study participants were required to be at least 5
years of age and report onset of at least two of the following COVID-19 symptoms
within 5 days or less: fever or chills, fatigue, sore throat, congestion or runny nose,
cough, headache, diarrhea, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, muscle or
body aches, new loss of taste or smell, nausea, or vomiting. A patient enrichment
strategy was implemented to increase the rate of SARS-CoV-2 positive participants
enrolled at the CityHealth Urgent Care Oakland, CA site. For this strategy, patients
presenting at the clinic were first tested by CityHealth Urgent Care staff, as part of
the standard-of-care, with an FDA EUA rapid antigen test (Quidel Sofia SARS
Antigen FIA) to pre-screen potential subjects prior to study enrollment. CityHealth
Urgent Care staff were asked to identify patients with preliminary positive or negative
results for study screening. The trained study operators, blinded to the original
patient standard-of-care result, performed specimen collection, processing, and
testing. An equal number of positives and negatives were pre-screened by the
CityHealth Urgent Care staff at the CityHealth Urgent Care Oakland, CA site. Five
unique study operators with varying healthcare backgrounds (licensed medical
assistants and registered nurses) conducted the study between the two sites.

Between February 6, 2021 and March 9, 2021, study participants were enrolled at a
third US clinical testing site (San Fernando Recreation Park in San Fernando, CA)

who were at least 5 years of age and reported at least one of the COVID-19
symptoms listed above. Five unique study operators with varying healthcare
backgrounds (licensed medical assistants and registered nurses) conducted the
study at the San Fernando, CA site.

Testing procedure
Following the standard of care, patients were asked to provide a total of three nasal
swab samples: a self-collected and observed nasal swab sample, followed by a
second and third nasal swab sample that were collected by the health care provider
(HCP). For the self-collected sample, the HCP provided specimen collection
instructions and observed the specimen collection by the patient. The order of the
second and third HCP-collected samples was randomized for testing with the
investigational antigen test and a comparator method to ensure that bias was not
introduced due to unequal distribution of viral material. Immediately after sample
collection, the samples for the RT-PCR reference method were stored in viral
transport media, while the other two nasal swabs were tested directly with the
INDICAID™ Rapid Test according to the instructions for use (IFU).

INDICAID™ Rapid Test samples were tested immediately on-site after collection
with no storage in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol. Results of the
INDICAID™ Rapid Test were interpreted by the test operators and recorded as
"Positive," "Negative", or "Invalid" based on the visual presence or absence of the
control and test lines on the developed test strip. Test results were recorded after 20
minutes of assay development by one individual operator per participant.

At the Oakland, CA and San Francisco, CA study sites, swab samples collected for
RT-PCR were transferred to DNA/RNA Shield (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA), stored
at room temperature, and shipped overnight at ambient temperature to Curative, Inc.
(San Dimas, CA) per the manufacturer’s protocol for laboratory testing. The Curative
SARS-CoV-2 Assay, an FDA Emergency Use Approved (EUA) test, was used as the
RT-PCR reference method [10].

At the San Fernando, CA study site, swab samples collected for RT-PCR were
transferred to BioCollections VTM (BioCollections Worldwide, Inc., Miami, FL),
stored on ice packs, and shipped overnight on ice packs to BioCollections
Worldwide, Inc. per the manufacturer’s protocol for laboratory testing. BioCollections
first performed the FDA EUA assay Hologic Aptima SARS-CoV-2 to determine the
SARS-CoV-2 status of each patient sample. The remaining volume from positive
specimens were then stored frozen at -70°C and later analyzed with the FDA EUA
BioCollections Worldwide SARS-CoV-2 Assay to obtain cycle threshold (Ct) results.

Ethical approval
To protect the rights, safety, and welfare of subjects, the study was conducted in
accordance with 21 CFR 50, Protection of Human Subjects. Prior to study
enrollment, each subject was asked to voluntarily provide his or her oral consent
after being provided the IRB-approved Research Information Sheet. The onsite study
investigator explained the nature, purpose, expected duration, and risks of study
participation. Each potential subject had the opportunity to ask questions and receive
answers from personnel conducting the study. All subjects were provided a copy of

the Research Information Sheet. The IRB was reviewed by Advarra, IRB number:
Pro00047510.

Statistical analysis
Difference testing for comparisons of groups in the population characteristics was
performed with Chi-square testing for categorical variables. Positive percentage
agreement (PPA), negative percentage agreement (NPA), overall percentage
agreement (OPA), and accuracy with 95% confidence intervals were calculated
using Wilson-Score method. RT-PCR results were used as the reference test.
Analyses were performed on StataSE (StataCorp, College Station, TX). Figures
were produced on GraphPad Prism 9.0.0 (GraphPad Holdings, La Jolla, CA).

COVID-19 outbreak screening with the INDICAID™ COVID-19 Rapid Antigen
Test
In this Dual-Track testing approach, the INDICAID™ Rapid Test is used to identify
preliminary positives to trigger prioritization of sample processing for subsequent RTPCR confirmatory testing. The outbreak testing was a collaborative effort between
PHASE Scientific, ONCO Medical Laboratory, Hong Kong Sanatorium & Hospital,
and the Food and Health Bureau of Hong Kong.

Outbreak testing population and locations
Twelve emergency outbreak testing centers (from December 10, 2020 to February 1,
2021) were organized at select locations in Hong Kong (Table 1). The sites were
made available for asymptomatic individuals who perceived themselves as having a
higher risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 or who were under compulsory testing

requirements according to the guidelines from the Department of Health of the
Government of the Hong Kong Special Administration Region.

Dual-Track Testing Algorithms
Two Dual-Track testing algorithms were implemented (Figure 1). In both
approaches, patient information is first collected at the registration station. Two nasal
swab specimens and one oropharyngeal swab specimen are then collected by a
clinician. One nasal swab specimen is used to perform the INDICAID™ Rapid Test
immediately onsite. The additional nasal swab and oropharyngeal swab specimens
are combined and stored in a single collection device containing viral transport
medium (VTM) for subsequent RT-PCR testing.

In Approach A, a preliminary positive result from the INDICAID™ Rapid Test would
expedite the corresponding patient VTM sample for laboratory-based RT-PCR.
Expedited testing would obtain results typically within an additional 8 hours
compared to the standard approach requiring 48-hour government mandated
turnaround time. In Approach B, a preliminary positive result from the INDICAID™
Rapid Test result would trigger the testing of the corresponding patient VTM sample
with an onsite rapid nucleic acid amplification test (cobas® SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza
A/B Nucleic acid test on the cobas® Liat system, Roche Molecular Diagnostics).
Results from the onsite rapid nucleic acid amplification test would typically be
obtained within an additional hour. In addition to the onsite rapid RT-PCR test, the
corresponding patient VTM sample was also sent for expedited laboratory-based
RT-PCR testing. All samples testing negative with the INDICAID™ Rapid Test were

sent for RT-PCR testing with the standard approach by the ONCO Medical
Laboratory in batches (Supplementary information).

For both approaches, a positive RT-PCR test resulted in the immediate notification of
the patient to isolate and take precautionary measures according to the guidelines of
the Department of Health of the Government of the Hong Kong Special
Administration Region. The RT-PCR result turnaround time for positive samples
detected using Approach A and B were evaluated at 8 and 4 different emergency
sample collection sites located in Hong Kong, respectively (Table 1).

Statistical Analysis
Positive percentage agreement (PPA), negative percentage agreement (NPA),
overall percentage agreement (OPA), and accuracy with 95% confidence intervals
were calculated using Wilson-Score method. RT-PCR results were used as the
reference test. Analyses were performed on StataSE (StataCorp, College Station,
TX). Figures were produced on GraphPad Prism 9.0.0 (GraphPad Holdings, La Jolla,
CA).

For both Dual-Track testing approaches and the standard testing approach, mean
and standard deviation were calculated for the elapsed time (minutes) from sample
collection to confirmatory RT-PCR test result. A two-tailed, two-sample T-test was
performed comparing each of the Dual-Track approaches to the standard approach.

Prospective multi-site clinical evaluation of the INDICAID™ COVID-19 Rapid
Antigen Test
San Francisco and Oakland population characteristics
In total, 83 participants with at least two COVID-19 symptoms were enrolled at the
San Francisco, CA and Oakland, CA sites. Two participants were excluded from the
analysis due to lost samples during transport for RT-PCR. Of the 81 participant
specimens analyzed, 44.4% were from female participants (Table 2) with a median
age of 32 years (IQR: 25, 44). The most frequently reported symptoms were
muscle/body ache (61.7%), congestion/runny nose (60.5%), fatigue (56.8%), and
headache (53.1%). The breakdown of duration of symptoms was 1-2 days in 37
participants (45.7%), 3-4 days in 38 participants (46.9%), and 5 days in 6
participants (7.4%).

San Fernando population characteristics
In total, 270 participants with at least one COVID-19 symptom were enrolled at the
San Fernando, CA site. Two participants were excluded from the analysis due to lost
or spilled samples during transport for RT-PCR. Of the 268 participant specimens
analyzed, 52.6% were from female participants (Table 3) and the median age was
35 years (IQR: 24, 50). The most frequently reported symptoms were sore throat
(60.8%), headache (60.1%), congestion/runny nose (59.0%), and cough (54.9%).
The distribution of duration of symptoms was 1-2 days in 109 participants (40.7%), 34 days in 127 participants (47.4%), and 5 days in 32 participants (11.9%).

Of the total 329 participant specimens included in the analyses, 75 tested positive
with the comparator laboratory-based RT-PCR test. The mean cycle threshold value
was 20.79±6.39 (Figure 2). The INDICAID™ Rapid Test demonstrated a PPA of
85.3% (95% Confidence Interval [95% CI]: 75.6% - 91.6%) and NPA of 94.9% (95%
CI: 91.6% - 96.9%) when sample collection was conducted by a healthcare
professional.

When sample collection was conducted by the participant (self-collected), the PPA
was 82.7% (95% CI: 72.6% - 89.6%) and the NPA was 96.4% (95% CI: 93.4% 98.0%). OPA for HCP- and self-collected specimens were 92.8% and 93.4%,
respectively (Tables 4 and 5).

Test
Performance of the INDICAID™ COVID-19 Rapid Antigen Test in asymptomatic
patients
In total, 22,994 asymptomatic individuals were screened at 12 outbreak screening
centers in Hong Kong. Thirty-eight (38) of the total 22,994 patients tested positive for
SARS-CoV-2 by laboratory-based RT-PCR. The INDICAID™ Rapid Test
demonstrated a PPA of 84.2% and NPA of 99.9% against the comparator RT-PCR
method (Table 6). All samples tested on-site by the cobas® SARS-CoV-2 &
Influenza A/B Nucleic acid test demonstrated concordant results with laboratorybased RT-PCR from ONCO Medical Laboratory.

Time-to-result data from 8 of 10 positive samples in Approach A and 12 of 18
positive samples in Approach B were available for analyses. The time-to-result for
the standard approach was estimated using 299 negative samples randomly
selected across three days and multiple sites as the extraction of reported time data
from all 22,944 negative samples would be a labor-intensive process.
After a preliminary positive result with the INDICAID™ Rapid Test, both Approach A
and Approach B demonstrated a shorter time to positive confirmatory RT-PCR result
when compared to the standard approach. Positive patient confirmation for Approach
A was on average 7.0 hours (mean=420±151 min) compared to an average of 10.85
hours (mean=651±171 min) for the standard approach (t(7)=4.3, p<0.004). Similarly,
for Approach B, positive patient confirmation was on average 0.84 hours
(mean=50.4±14 min) compared to an average of 10.85 hours (mean=651±171 min)
for the standard approach (t(232)=56.3, p<0.0001).

DISCUSSION
In the prospective clinical study in symptomatic patient populations, the INDICAID™
Rapid Test demonstrated a PPA of 85.3% and NPA of 94.9% against comparator
laboratory-based RT-PCR. False negative results were mainly observed in
participant specimens with higher Ct values and likely lower viral loads. Although
participant collected (self-collected) samples resulted in slightly lower performance
compared to clinician collected samples, self-collection allows for significantly
reduced risk to healthcare workers and improved clinical workflow for high
throughput screening operations.

When implemented for outbreak testing of asymptomatic patients, the INDICAID™
Rapid Test demonstrated a PPA and NPA of 84.2% and 99.9%, respectively, against
laboratory-based RT-PCR. The similar PPA and NPA compared to the prospective
clinical study suggest minimal or no loss in performance when used in asymptomatic
populations in a real-world setting. When combined with RT-PCR testing in the DualTrack testing approach, the INDICAID™ Rapid Test was able to successfully reduce
the time to confirmatory positive result from an average of 10.85 hours to 0.84 hours.
The reduced time to positive patient identification and notification could result in a
significant reduction in transmission in densely populated communities.

There were limitations during the symptomatic clinical evaluation. The tests were
conducted under controlled temperature and lighting conditions and interpreted by a
limited pool of trained operators. Widespread community testing might occur under
less-controlled conditions. Several point-of-care flex studies (see Supplementary
Information) were performed to demonstrate that the INDICAID™ Rapid Test is
robust under suboptimal conditions (i.e., extreme temperature and humidity, out-ofspecification buffer addition, and variable result reading times). Additionally, selfcollected samples were always collected first, which might have affected the amount
of virus/antigen remaining for the subsequent operator-collected samples. While the
sample collection order is not expected to drastically influence the reference test
result, the effect of repeated sampling on the INDICAID™ Rapid Test has not been
confirmed.

Rapid antigen tests are expected to play an increasingly important role in COVID-19
testing programs. To our knowledge, our Dual-Track testing approach is one of the

first widely coordinated efforts to integrate COVID-19 rapid antigen testing with rapid
confirmatory RT-PCR testing in asymptomatic populations. Recently, the United
States CDC proposed similar screening algorithms that incorporate routine rapid
antigen testing for asymptomatic populations, followed by positive patient
confirmation by RT-PCR [11]. The performance of the INDICAID™ COVID-19 Rapid
Antigen Test makes it a suitable test to be incorporated into such screening
algorithms as communities, schools and businesses reopen with the relaxation of
public health measures. The Dual-Track testing approach may be an effective
solution for COVID-19 surveillance and outbreak response, particularly in densely
populated communities.

CONCLUSION
The INDICAID™ COVID-19 Rapid Antigen Test demonstrated high PPA and NPA
against laboratory-based RT-PCR in symptomatic and asymptomatic populations
with varying community rates of circulating SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, when used in
an algorithm testing approach (Dual-Track), the INDICAID™ COVID-19 Rapid
Antigen Test successfully reduced the time to confirmatory positive result. The DualTrack testing approach highlights the advantages that rapid antigen testing can bring
to already established RT-PCR testing frameworks. More studies are needed to
determine optimal use of rapid antigen testing for screening algorithms.

Supplementary Information

ONCO Medical Laboratory RT-PCR Clinical laboratory testing procedure
Total viral RNA was extracted from 200µl of patient VTM sample using either prefilled 96-deep well plate (64T, Tianlong Technology) with automated GeneRotex 96
rotary nucleic acid extractor system (NANBEI, Tianlong Technology), or 96-well prepacked extraction reagents (SDK60104-96T, Bioperfectus Technologies) with
automated nucleic acid extraction system (SSNP-3000A, Bioperfectus
Technologies). RT-PCR was performed to determine the expression level of Orf1b in
the extracted RNA using PHASIFY™ DeCOVID SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR Kit
(3010100, Phase Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Sample quality
was validated via measuring expression levels of internal controls (viral: RdRP;
human: RNase P). Positive and negative controls were included in each PCR
reaction.

Analytical Validation of the INDICAID™ COVID-19 Rapid Antigen Test
Materials and Methods
Analytical limit of detection
The limit of detection (LoD) was determined by limiting dilution studies using
characterized gamma-irradiated SARS-CoV-2 virus (BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH,
SARS-Related Coronavirus 2, Isolate USA-WA1/2020, Gamma-Irradiated, NR-52287)
spiked into pooled human nasal matrix from healthy donors (IRHUNF1ML, Innovative
Research, MI, USA). At each dilution, 50 μL of sample was inoculated onto swabs
and then assayed using the INDICAID™ COVID-19 Rapid Antigen Test procedure.
An initial range finding study was performed using a 10-fold dilution series of the

characterized SARS-CoV-2, testing the device in triplicate at each concentration.
Concentrations between the last dilution that produced three positive test results and
the first dilution to produce at least one negative test result were further evaluated
using a 2-fold dilution series, in triplicate for each level, to refine the tentative LoD.
This LoD was then confirmed by testing 20 replicates with concentrations at the
refined tentative limit of detection. The final LoD of the test was determined to be the
lowest concentration resulting in positive detection of at least 19 out of 20 replicates.

To correlate the performance of the INDICAID™ Rapid Test with cycle threshold
value output, 14 concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 from heat inactivated SARS-Related
Coronavirus 2 Culture Fluid (1.02x 108 TDID50/mL, 0810587CFHI, lot 325309,
Zeptometrix) were prepared through serial dilution in the INDICAID™ Rapid Test
buffer and then tested with both the INDICAID™ Rapid Test and with ONCO Medical
Laboratory RT-PCR method. A dilution scheme that simulated the differences in
dilution ratios between the INDICAID™ Rapid Test and the ONCO Medical
Laboratory RT-PCR test was used. Viral-free test buffer was included as negative
controls. The INDICAID™ Rapid Test was performed using 75µl of sample
immediately after the dilution. Positive and negative band determinations were made
by visual inspection from three blinded observers according to a standardized line
intensity reference chart. Tests were analyzed at 20 minutes.

To determine the RT-PCR cycle threshold vales of the contrived samples, total viral
RNA was extracted from 200µl of sample using 96-well pre-packed extraction
reagents (SDK60104-96T, Bioperfectus Technologies) with automated nucleic acid
extraction system (SSNP-3000A, Bioperfectus Technologies). The expression level

of Orf1b in the extracted RNA was determined using PHASIFY™ DeCOVID SARSCoV-2 RT-qPCR Kit (3010100, Phase Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Sample quality was validated via measuring expression levels of internal
controls (viral: RdRP; human: RNase P). Positive and negative controls were
included in each PCR reaction. Non-linear regression analysis was performed on
GraphPad Prism 9.0.0 fit to a sigmoidal curve constraining the top plateau at a rapid
antigen test line intensity 12.

Endogenous interference, cross-reactivity, microbial interference
After the LoD was determined, evaluations of endogenous interference, crossreactivity, and microbial interference were conducted according to the US FDA’s
Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) template for SARS-CoV-2 antigen test
manufacturers.[3]

Flex studies for out-of-specifications test performance
A thorough hazard analysis was conducted to evaluate the impact of errors, or outof-specifications conditions, on the rapid antigen test performance. To test the effect
of extreme environmental conditions, contrived samples of 5.6 x 103 TCID50/mL (2x

matrix, as well as non-spiked negative pooled nasal matrix, were tested on the
INDICAID™ Rapid Test in low temperature (2-8°C) and high temperature/high
humidity (40°C and near 95% relative humidity (RH)) conditions. One hour prior to
the study, test kits were placed in a refrigerator maintaining 2-8°C or an incubator
maintaining 40°C and 95% RH. Contrived samples were then applied to the test

devices and allowed to run for 20 min in the same respective environments (n=3 per
condition). Test results were recorded after 20 min.

To test the effect of INDICAID™ Rapid Test buffer volume variability, contrived
samples of 5.6 x 103 TCID50/mL gamma-irradiated SARS-CoV-2 in pooled nasal
matrix, as well as non-spiked negative pooled nasal matrix, were tested on the
INDICAID™ Rapid Test at room temperature. Following the release of contrived
specimen from the inoculated swab into the buffer solution, solution volumes of 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6 drops, and the entire buffer volume were applied to the test device (n=3 per
condition). Test results for all replicates were interpreted at 20 minutes.

To test the effect of variable result read times, contrived samples of 5.6 x 103
TCID50/mL gamma-irradiated SARS-CoV-2 in pooled nasal matrix, as well as nonspiked negative pooled nasal matrix, were tested on the INDICAID™ Rapid Test at
room temperature. Test results were interpreted at 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 60 minutes
after samples had been applied to the test device (n=3 per condition).

RESULTS
Analytical limit of detection
For the initial LoD range finding study, 10-fold serial dilutions of gamma-irradiated
SARS-CoV-2 in pooled human nasal matrix were prepared with the highest test
concentration of 2.8 x105 TCID50/mL (1.4 x 104 TCID50/swab). From this dilution
series, the lowest concentration to produce 3 out of 3 positive results on the
INDICAID™ Rapid Test was 2.8 x103 TCID50/mL (1.4 x 102 TCID50/swab). This
tentative LoD was further refined using 2-fold serial dilutions between 2.8 x103

TCID50/mL (1.4 x 102 TCID50/swab) and 1.75 x 102 TCID50/mL (8.75 TCID50/swab).
From this 2-fold dilution series, a concentration of 2.8 x 103 TCID50/mL (1.4 x 102
TCID50/swab) continued to be the lowest concentration that produced 3 out of 3
positive results. This concentration was confirmed to be the final LoD as 20 out of 20
replicates produced a positive result with test samples containing 1.4 x 102
TCID50/swab.

The LoD in relation to cycle threshold value of the INDICAID™ Rapid Test was
evaluated using contrived samples of varying concentrations of heat inactivated
SARS-CoV-2 spiked into the INDICAID™ Rapid Test buffer. Results were reported
in line intensity values from a standardized line intensity reference chart by three
trained readers in a blind experimental design. Line intensity values correspond to
the visibility of the test line to the user with 0 representing no visible test line and 12
representing the maximum test line intensity (Figure S1). Based on an industry
standard for visually based lateral-flow immunoassays, a line intensity of 3 was
utilized as the visual cut-off for the intended user (non-laboratory healthcare
professionals). The visual cut-off intersects the non-linear regression line (R2 =
0.976) at a Ct value of 27.2.

Endogenous interference, cross-reactivity, microbial interference
No cross-reactivity nor test interference were observed for 27 common respiratory
pathogens and pooled nasal wash in the presence of gamma-irradiated SARS-CoV2 at 3x the analytical LoD. Furthermore, 14 endogenous substances that may be
found in respiratory specimens of patients symptomatic for respiratory illness
demonstrated no significant test interference in the presence of gamma-irradiated
SARS-CoV-2 at 3x the analytical LoD.

Flex studies for out-of-specifications test performance
A series of flex studies was conducted to evaluate the influence of errors that can
occur in point-of-care environments. These errors include extreme temperatures,

extreme humidity, higher- and lower-than-recommended buffer volumes added to the
test device, and sooner- and later-than-recommended read times. When tested with
contrived samples in low temperature conditions (2-8°C) as well as high temperature
and humidity conditions (40°C and 95% RH), the INDICAID™ Rapid Test produced
expected positive and negative results and no invalid test results were observed.
With low positive contrived samples (i.e., 2x the analytical LoD), accurate test result
interpretation could be made by trained users as soon as 10 min and as late as 60
min after samples have been applied to the test device. Furthermore, accurate
results were produced when 2-6 drops of the INDICAID™ Rapid Test buffer are
applied to the test device, as opposed to the manufacturer-recommended 3 drops.
