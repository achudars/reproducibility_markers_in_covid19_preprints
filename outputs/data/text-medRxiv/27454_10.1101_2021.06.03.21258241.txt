Research in context
Evidence before this study
SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to infect the respiratory tract and affect several other
major organs. However, on a cellular level, the localization of SARS-CoV-2 and its
targets ACE2 and TMPRSS2 have not been described comprehensively.
Added value of this study
We have analyzed tissue SARS-CoV-2 RNA using RT-PCR and visualized its
localization together with ACE2 and TMPRSS2 using in situ hybridization (ISH) in 25
different autopsy tissues. SARS-CoV-2 sense and antisense RNA were detected in
16 tissues/organs, mainly in epithelial cells and, to a lesser extent, in endothelial or
stromal cells. Detection of viral protein using immunohistochemistry or viral particles
using transmission electron microscopy did not yield specific results. Interestingly,
apart from the respiratory tract and specifically the lungs, we have not found a
specific pathology that would be associated with extrapulmonary viral spread.
Implications of all the available evidence
We provide a recommendation on using these methods in autopsy diagnostics for
SARS-CoV-2. Our data extend the current hypothesis of severe COVID-19 being
multisystemic diseases. Our data also provide clear evidence of infection and
replication of SARS-CoV-2 in the endothelial cell across all organs, extending the
hypothesis on the (micro)vascular involvement in COVID-19.

Abstract (242 Words)
Background: Multiorgan tropism of SARS-CoV-2 has previously been shown for
several major organs.

Methods: We have comprehensively analyzed 25 different formalin-fixed paraffinembedded (FFPE) tissues/organs from autopsies of fatal COVID-19 cases (n=8),
using detailed histopathological assessment, detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using
polymerase chain reaction and RNA in situ hybridization, viral protein using
immunohistochemistry, and virus particles using transmission electron microscopy.
Finally, we confirmed these findings in an independent external autopsy cohort (n=9).

Findings: SARS-CoV-2 RNA was mainly localized in epithelial cells, endothelial and
mesenchymal cells across all organs. Next to lung, trachea, kidney, heart, or liver,
viral RNA was also found in tonsils, salivary glands, oropharynx, thyroid, adrenal
gland, testicles, prostate, ovaries, small bowel, lymph nodes, skin and skeletal
muscle. Viral RNA was predominantly found in cells expressing ACE2, TMPRSS2, or
both. The SARS-CoV-2 replicating RNA was also detected in these organs.
Immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy were not suitable for reliable and
specific SARS-CoV-2 detection in autopsies. The findings were validated using in situ
hybridization on external COVID-19 autopsy samples. Finally, apart from the lung,
correlation of virus detection and histopathological assessment did not reveal any
specific alterations that could be attributed to SARS-CoV-2.

Interpretation: SARS-CoV-2 could be observed in virtually all organs, colocalizing
with ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mainly in epithelial but also in mesenchymal and
endothelial cells, and viral replication was found across all organ systems. Apart from
the respiratory tract, no specific (histo-)morphologic alterations could be assigned to
the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Introduction
Since late 2019, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
causing the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a pandemic with
major impacts on virtually all aspects of life. By May 2021, the number of global
deaths attributed to COVID-19 has increased to more than 3 million, with more than
160 million infected individuals in 223 countries (WHO; https://covid19.who.int/).
Despite extensive research, understanding of the organic and cellular manifestations
of COVID-19 remains incomplete. Next to the typical clinical symptoms of a
respiratory infection 1, including fever, dyspnea, and dry cough, other symptoms
indicate the involvement of other organ systems, e.g., diarrhea, vomiting, or anosmia.
In severe cases, patients develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),
pneumonia but also systemic inflammation, heart diseases (e.g. elevated cardiac
markers, acute heart failure) 2, and acute kidney injury (AKI). These data suggest that
COVID-19 can be viewed as a multisystemic disease.
Post-mortem investigation, i.e., autopsy, provides a comprehensive insight into the
pathophysiology of novel diseases, such as COVID-19, allowing investigation of the
multisystemic viral spread and effects on a tissue and cellular level 3. Recent studies
using in situ hybridization (ISH) have found SARS-CoV-2 tropism and replication in
airways, i.e., trachea, lung, bronchi, or submucosal glands, within pneumocytes,
alveolar and pulmonary lymph node macrophages, endothelium, and respiratory
epithelium

angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine
subtype 2 (TMPRSS2), across the various tissues were not comprehensively
described

. Here, we used a multitude of different methods to analyze the

distribution of SARS-CoV-2 virus, ACE2, and TMPRSS2 in 25 different organs, using
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) autopsy specimens from deceased COVID19 patients.

Methods
Ethical issues
The study was approved by the local ethics committee (EK 304/20, EK 119/20, EK
092/20 and 9621_BO_K_2021) and was carried out in accordance with the
declaration of Helsinki for medical research involving human subjects. For all
autopsies, legal authorization was obtained from the next of kin of the deceased
person.
Histology samples & cohort description
We used tissue collected from eight autopsies (Table 1). At the time of death,
patients were 68±9·55 years old and predominantly male (M:F = 5:3). All patients
tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR during their clinical course. After death,
corpses were cooled at 4°C from 4 h after death until autopsy. The post-mortem
interval (i.e., time from death to autopsy) ranged from 20 to 48 h (median, 35·5 h).
Autopsies were performed in a dedicated room equipped with a separate ventilation
system. All autopsies were performed in two steps, with internal organs removed first
and then fixed in 4% buffered formalin and without brain autopsy to avoid aerosol
formation. Organs were fixed for one week before further processing. Then, all
organs from the thorax and abdomen were examined macroscopically and
microscopically (tongue, oropharynx, tonsil, salivary gland, thyroid, proximal and
distal trachea, paraaortal/ cervical/ hilar/ abdominal lymph nodes, each lung lobe
(one central and one peripheral sample each), heart (anterior, lateral and posterior
left ventricular wall, septum, left ventricular papillary muscles, and right ventricle),
esophagus, stomach, small intestine, colon, left and right liver lobes, pancreas,
spleen, left and right kidney, left and right adrenal gland, uterus (f)/ prostate (m),
ovary (f)/ testis (m), muscle, and skin. Personal protective equipment included N95

masks, waterproof protective suits, goggles, waterproof aprons, and multiple layers of
gloves. All garments were changed before and after autopsies were performed. The
detailed protocol of the autopsy procedure is available at https://www.pathologiedgp.de/media/Dgp/aktuelles/Anl._3_Obduktion_COVID-19_15042020__1_.pdf

(in

german). We have also used an independent validation cohort of nine cases
described in detail in the supplementary methods.

Histopathological examination
For microscopic examination, all formalin-fixed specimens were dehydrated and
paraffin-embedded (formalin fixed and paraffin embedded - FFPE), cut into 4 µm thin
slices, and stained on an autostainer according to standard protocols with
hematoxylin-eosin (HE) stain. All slides were digitized using the Aperio AT2
brightfield scanner (Leica Biosystems, Nussloch, Germany) with a 40x objective
generating Whole Slides Images (WSI).

Tissue microarray (TMA) block preparation
For FISH analysis, tissue microarrays were created from 25 organs (oropharynx,
tonsil, salivary gland, thyroid, distal trachea, perihilar/ mesenteric lymph node, lung
(left and right, two central and one peripheral), heart (anterior, left ventricle wall),
esophagus, stomach, large/small intestine, liver, pancreas, spleen, kidney, adrenal
gland, urinary bladder, uterus/prostate, ovary/testis, bone marrow, muscle, and skin;
Supplementary Table 1). Punches for tissue microarrays (3 mm diameter) were taken
under HE-morphologic control to obtain areas with the least autolytic changes or
most representative areas for specific pathologic changes (e.g., hyaline membranes,
squamous metaplasia in the lung, neoplastic cells in malignant disease). TMAs were

then sectioned with a microtome sequentially for various stains, including
hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and in situ hybridization, as mentioned below.

SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection with Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
The fresh-cut, 1-μm-thick TMA sections were deparaffinized in xylene and then
dehydrated with 100% ethanol. FISH was performed on the sections with the
RNAscope® Multiplex Fluorescent Reagent Kit v2 assay (Advanced Cell Diagnostics,
Inc., Hayward, California), based on the assay principle as described 17. Briefly, we
incubated the tissue sections with H2O2 and performed a heat-induced target retrieval
step followed by protease incubation with the reagents provided. RNA sequences of
SARS-CoV-2 S gene, SARS-CoV-2 antisense of S gene, ACE2, and TMPRSS2 were
hybridized using RNAscope® probe -V-nCoV2019-S (#848561-C1), -V-nCoV2019-Ssense (#845701-C1), -Hs-ACE2-C2 (#848151-C2) and -Hs-TMPRSS2-C2 (#470341C2), respectively. Positive (C1: POLR2A gene of Homo sapiens; C2: PPIB gene of
Homo sapiens) and negative probes (dap gene of Bacillus subtilis) were also applied
in each experiment. After the amplifier steps, according to the manual, OpalTM 570
and 650 fluorophores (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences, Boston, MA) were
applied to the tissues incubated with C1 and C2 probes, respectively. Finally, nuclei
were labeled with DAPI, and the slides were mounted with ProLongTM Gold antifade
reagent (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA). Sections were analyzed with Zeiss Axio Imager 2
and image analysis software (ZEN 3·0 blue edition).

Electron Microscopy (EM)
Samples prepared for transmission electron microscopy were obtained after 7-10
days of formalin fixation and additional fixation in 3% glutaraldehyde for 24 hours.
Samples were post-fixed in 1% OsO4 (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) and dehydrated in

ascending ethanol series (30, 50, 70, 90, and 100%). Dehydrated samples were
incubated in propylene oxide (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany) and embedded in Epon
resin (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany). Ultrathin sections were contrast-enhanced by
staining with 0.5% uranyl acetate and 1% lead citrate (both EMS, Munich, Germany)
and viewed on a transmission electron microscope (Zeiss Leo 906, Oberkochen,
Germany).

Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein in
FFPE autopsy lung
We selected autopsy lung samples from a cohort of 3 patient groups, which were
diagnosed as ARDS, COVID-19, and influenza A virus subtype H1N1 infection (Table
2). Briefly, 4 μm thin FFPE sections were prepared and deparaffinized in xylene,
followed by rehydration with a concentration gradient of ethanol. Tissue sections
were then subjected to heat-induced epitope retrieval with Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 9)
and quenched with 3% H2O2. The slides were then incubated with primary antibody
against SARS spike glycoprotein (1:1000; Abcam, Cambridge, UK; Ab272420) in 1%
BSA/PBS solution. The remaining IHC steps were performed as previously
described 18, and the staining was developed with ImmPACT® VIP Substrate (Vector
Labs, Burlingame, CA, US).

RNA isolation from FFPE specimens and SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection
We extracted RNA from FFPE tissue using a Maxwell® 16 LEV RNA FFPE
Purification Kit (Promega GmbH, Walldorf, Germany) on the Maxwell® 16 IVD
instrument (Promega GmbH) or with the ReliaPrep™ FFPE Total RNA Miniprep
System (Promega GmbH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. We stored
the RNA samples at -80°C until further processing.

Previously we compared two different kits for RT-PCR analysis

19

. Here, we used the

TaqMan™ Fast 1-Step Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific GmbH, Dreieich,
Germany) for the qualitative detection of the E gene (encoding envelope protein) of
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by a primer
(0·4 μM) and probe (0·2 μM) set labeled with fluorescent reporters and quencher
dyes. We used TaqMan® Exogenous Internal Positive Control reagents (Thermo
Fisher Scientific GmbH, Dreieich, Germany) as internal PCR controls. RT-PCR was
performed as previously described 19,20. Briefly, we reversely transcribed (50°C for 10
min) and amplified the RNA extracted from FFPE tissues with the reaction mixture at
95°C for 20 s and followed by 45 cycles of 95°C for 3 s and 58°C for 30 s. We used
the Amplirun® SARS-CoV-2 RNA control (Bestbion dx GmbH, Cologne, Germany)
provided with 13000 viral RNA copies μL-1 to calculate the viral RNA copies in the
tissue samples. In our SARS-CoV-2 positive tissues, the third quartile of the
detectable viral copies is 328 viral copies μL-1, which is equivalent to the Ct value of
30·7. In this regard, we defined the cut-off value indicating a high viral load of SARSCoV-2 in the sample when the Ct value was ≤ 30·7.

Results
Study cohort
The main characteristics of the study cohort (5 male/ 3 female; median age 69 [55–
83] years) are given in Table 1. The period between the onset of symptoms and
death ranged from 12 to 64 days (median 31 days, Figure 1), thereby including early
and late/prolonged disease stages. The time between the onset of symptoms and
admission ranged from 1 to 7 days (median 5 days, Figure 1) and from admission to
death from 2 to 60 days (median 26·5 days, Figure 1). Six patients had at least one
clinically confirmed comorbidity, including hypertension (n=5), diabetes mellitus type
2 (n=3) or type 1 (n=1), coronary artery disease (n=2), malignant disease (n=1), liver
cirrhosis (n=1) and dementia (n=1). One patient had a history of chronic kidney
disease with kidney transplant and immunosuppression. One patient had a history of
tobacco abuse, while no information on current or previous tobacco abuse was
available for the remaining 7 patients. None of the patients had tested positive for the
respiratory syncytial virus or influenza A and B viruses on admission. Seven patients
were treated with mechanical ventilation, of which three patients were treated with
additional extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) subsequently. One patient
refused mechanical ventilation and intensive care treatment. Duration of ECMO
treatment ranged from 342 to 1381 hours (median 568 hours). During treatment, five
patients had an acute kidney injury and required dialysis. None of the patients had a
cerebrovascular disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Pathological findings
From the autopsy analyses, the direct cause of death in all patients was diffuse
alveolar damage (DAD) with mixed and overlapping patterns of the exudative,

proliferative, and organizing phase or fibrotic phase (Supplementary Table 2). All
patients had heavier lungs compared to the normal range (median left: 945 g and
right: 1191 g, normal: 500-700 g). Intra-alveolar granulocyte infiltration indicating
bacterial superinfection was found in the majority of cases (5/8). Additionally,
squamous metaplasia (6/8) and multinucleated intra-alveolar giant cells (5/8) were
found. Two patients displayed pulmonary artery thrombosis. Some common findings
in other organs were ductular cholestasis in the liver (5/8) and cardiomegaly (6/8;
median 482 g). All pathological diagnostic data are summarized in Supplementary
Table 2.
Pulmonary findings of DAD included hyaline membranes, intra-alveolar edema,
proliferative DAD after a disease duration of <21 days in three patients and
organizing or fibrotic DAD with bronchiolization and squamous metaplasia after a
disease duration of >21 days in five patients (Supplementary Table 2). There was a
diffuse distribution of different DAD phases and non-affected tissue, with highly
fibrotic

Erosive

tracheobronchitis was present in two patients. Pulmonary lymph nodes showed
enlargement and reactive changes with sinus histiocytosis. Pulmonary metastases
from breast or papillary thyroid cancer was found in two patients (Supplementary
Figure 2C&D).
No overt pathological findings attributable to Sars-CoV-2 infection could be
recognized outside of the lung. In a detailed analysis, two of five patients with a
disease duration of >21 days showed signs of borderline myocarditis with >14 CD3
positive lymphocytes/ mm² (patient 4, 50 CD3+ cells/mm2 and patient 5, 16 CD3+
cells/ mm2). In these patients, cardiac tissue was positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (Ct
value ≥ 30 in patient 4 and Ct value ≤ 30 in patient 5, Figure 2). In three additional

patients with a disease duration of 12- 64 days, CD3 positive lymphocytes were
increased to ≥10/ mm² (patient 3 and 8, 10 CD3+ cells/mm2 and patient 7, 11 CD3+
cells/ mm2). In two of these three cases, the cardiac tissue was positive for SARSCoV-2 RNA (Ct value ≤ 30 in patient 3 and Ct value ≥ 30 in patient 7, Figure 2). In the
five cases with increased CD3 lymphocytes, also intravascular lymphocytes were
increased, consistent with capillaritis (or endotheliitis). In all cases, we found an
increased number of intra- and perivascular CD68 positive macrophages. Myocyte
injury was not found in any case.
In the haematopoetic system, an increased number of macrophages were visible in
the bone marrow of one patient. This patient fulfilled 5 of 8 criteria of the macrophage
activation syndrome

21

. The spleen morphologically seemed depleted of lymphoid

cells in all cases.
In the urogenital system, kidney samples from two patients were positive for RT-PCR
of SARS-CoV-2 RNA but displayed no specific pathology (Ct value ≥ 30, Patient 3
and 4, Figure 2). In 2/5 males, testicular germ cell aplasia was found. One of these
cases was positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA with high viral load in testicular as well as
prostatic tissue (Ct value ≤ 30 in Patient 4, Figure 2), while one another case with
high viral load in testicular tissue (Patient 3, Figure 2) did not display morphologic
alterations of spermatogenesis. In one case of RT-PCR positive ovarian tissue with
low viral load (Ct value ≥ 30, Patient 2, Figure 2), no pathologic findings were noted.
In the endocrine system, we found moderately to highly increased lymphocytic
infiltration in the thyroid of 3/8 patients, two of which were also RT-PCR positive for
SARS-CoV-2 RNA (Patient 2 and 6, Figure 2). In 2/8 patients, focal inconspicuous
chronic inflammatory cells were found, of which one was associated with high viral
load (Ct ≤ 30, Patient 4, Figure 2) and one with low viral load (Ct ≥ 30, Patient 8,

Figure 2). In one patient, we discovered previously unknown advanced papillary
thyroid cancer with pulmonary metastasization (Patient 8), as well as a previously
unknown papillary thyroid microcarcinoma of 3 mm diameter in a second patient
(Patient 5).
In the adrenal gland, 5/8 cases showed inconspicuous chronic inflammation with
perivascular distribution (patient 2, 5-8). One case showed moderate chronic
inflammation (Patient 3):Two cases were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA with RTPCR (Ct ≥ 30, Patient 2 and 3, Figure 2).
In the gastrointestinal system, we detected no specific morphologic alterations,
despite positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in most samples from the salivary
gland, oropharynx, stomach, pancreas, and liver in patients with a disease duration <
14 days (Ct ≥ 30, Patients 1-3, Figure 2). The liver in Patient 2 showed micronodular
cirrhosis. With an increased disease duration of > 21 days, three of five patients
showed ductular cholestasis of the liver (“cholangitis lenta”, Patient 4, 5, and 7,
Figure 2), negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA tested with RT-PCR. Finally, in muscle and
skin, we found no specific alterations in two samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 RTPCR in comparison to those that were negative.

FISH-based detection of SARS-CoV-2, ACE2, and TMPRSS2
RT-PCR allows fast screening of tissues for SARS-CoV-2 positivity, and thereby
effective correlation of pathological findings with viral presence. However, it does not
allow cell-specific analyses of localization. For this purpose, we validated a FISH
method with positive and negative controls by detecting endogenous human genes
POLR2A and PPIB) and a bacterial gene (dap gene of Bacillus subtilis), respectively
(Supplementary Figure 1A-E). We also validated the probes against the SARS-CoV-2

S gene and human ACE2 gene on autopsy lung tissue collected from an influenza A
(H1N1) infected patient before the COVID-19 pandemic, showing no signal for
SARS-CoV-2 S gene and prominent signal for ACE2 (Supplementary Figure 1F).
FISH was performed to analyze tissue microarrays (TMA), followed by HE staining on
consecutive slides for the overlay to allow a detailed morphological correlation
(Figure 3-7). We used two probe combinations for the FISH detection, either the
SARS-CoV-2 S gene antisense (determining viral genomic RNA) and ACE2 or the
SARS-CoV-2-S gene sense strand (indicating replicating virus) and TMPRSS2.
Consistent with the RT-PCR results, we identified SARS-CoV-2 positive signals in the
lung and respiratory tract (Figure 4, Supplementary Figure 2), heart, lymphoid organs
(Figure 5), urogenital tract (Figure 6), endocrine and gastrointestinal organs, muscle
and skin (Figure 7). We also observed the positive signal for the replicating SARSCoV-2 (antisense) in all these organs. The SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 and
protease TMPRSS2 RNA were found in all organs except bone marrow and urinary
bladder (Figure 3).

SARS-CoV-2, ACE2, and TMPRSS2 in the respiratory system
We have identified several respiratory cells that were positive for SARS-CoV-2
genomic (S gene; sense) and replicating (S gene: antisense) RNA, ACE2, and
TMPRSS2. This included the bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells and cells of the
squamous metaplasia in the lung (Figure 4A and 4E, Supplementary Figure 2A). In
the microvasculature, SARS-CoV-2 genomic and replicating RNA could be found in
the endothelial cells together with ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (Figure 4B). SARS-CoV-2
genomic and replicating RNA, and TMPRSS2 RNA was also detected in the
endothelium adjacent to emboli within vessels (Figure 4C).

In the patients with pulmonary metastases from breast cancer and papillary thyroid
cancer, some of the cancer cells were positive for SARS-CoV-2 genomic and
replicating RNA, ACE2, and TMPRSS2 RNA (Supplementary Figure 2B-2C).
In one lung sample, giant cells were positive for SARS-CoV-2 genomic and
replicating RNA, and few were positive for ACE2 RNA (Supplementary Figure 2D).
FISH also indicated some neutrophils to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 genomic and
replicating RNA, ACE2, and TMPRSS2 RNA (Supplementary Figure 2E).
Furthermore, hyaline membranes were positive for SARS-CoV-2 genomic and
replicating RNA (Figure 4D), likely originating from detached pneumocytes. Finally,
we showed that SARS-CoV-2 genomic and replicating RNA, and TMPRSS2 RNA
were found in tracheal epithelial cells (Figure 4F).

SARS-CoV-2, ACE2, and TMPRSS2 in the heart, lymphoid organs, and
urogenital tract.
Using PCR, we detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in six of the eight patients in the heart
(Figure 2). We found both SARS-CoV-2 genomic and replicating RNA to be present
in cardiomyocytes showing that the virus can infect and replicate in cardiomyocytes
(Figure 5A). ACE2 was mainly expressed in the stromal cells, and capillary
endothelial cells, whereas TMPRSS2 expression was mainly found in perivascular
cells and some cardiomyocytes (Figure 5A).
In tonsils, we detected SARS-CoV-2 genomic and replicating RNA in the epithelium,
which also expressed ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (Figure 5B; lower panel). Some
lymphocytes also showed replicating SARS-CoV-2 RNA (Figure 5B; upper panel).
We also observed that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 RNA were expressed by some

submucosal cells. In some endothelial cells, we detected only TMPRSS2 RNA but
not ACE2 RNA (Figure 5B; upper panel).
In both perihilar and mesenteric lymph nodes, we observed most mesenchymal
stromal cells and immune cells to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 genomic and
replicating RNA (Figure 5C; upper panel). Some endothelial cells were also infected
by the virus (Figure 5C; SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA, upper panel). Additionally, both
ACE2 and TMPRSS2 RNA were expressed strongly in the immune cells within the
lymph nodes.
In kidneys, we detected SARS-CoV-2 in different epithelial cells, i.e., glomerular
podocytes and parietal epithelial cells (Figure 6A; SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA, upper
panel) and tubular epithelial cells (Figure 6A; lower panel). Similar to lungs, renal
endothelium was also infected by the virus, both in glomerular and peritubular
capillaries (data not shown).
We detected SARS-CoV-2 also in the prostate, localizing in most prostatic glands,
particularly in the glandular epithelial cells (Figure 6B; SARS-CoV-2 genomic and
replicating RNA, upper panel). Some mesenchymal cells (Figure 6B, SARS-CoV-2
genomic RNA, bottom panel) and endothelial cells were also infected. ACE2 RNA
expression was also found in most glandular epithelial cells (Figure 6B; upper panel)
and stromal cells. TMPRSS2 RNA was mainly expressed in the glandular epithelium
and stromal cells (Figure 5B) and to a much lesser extent in the endothelial cells.
By RT-PCR, we detected a high viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in the testicles. FISH
staining indicated SARS-CoV-2 genomic and replicating RNA to be localized mainly
in the germinal epithelium (Figure 6C). Some endothelial cells were also infected by
the virus. We observed ACE2 RNA was mainly expressed in the Leydig cells and
some endothelial cells, whereas TMPRSS2 was mainly found in the stromal cells.

SARS-CoV-2 antisense RNA could also be found in stromal cells of the ovary in one
COVID-19 patient (Figure 6D), where ACE2 RNA was also mainly expressed, and
some stromal cells expressed TMPRSS2 RNA.

SARS-CoV-2, ACE2, and TMPRSS2 in the endocrine and gastrointestinal
organs, skeletal muscle, and skin.
Within the endocrine system, there were six infected thyroids within our autopsy
cohort. We detected SARS-CoV-2 genomic and replicating RNA in most follicular
epithelial cells (Figure 7A; upper panel), some stromal and endothelial cells (Figure
7A; bottom panel). ACE2 RNA was mainly found in the follicular epithelium (Figure
7A; upper panel) and endothelial cells, whereas TMPRSS2 RNA was expressed in
most follicular epithelial cells (Figure 7A; upper panel), some stromal and endothelial
cells.
In the two adrenal glands, we observed SARS-CoV-2 genomic and replicating SARSCoV-2 RNA in most glandular epithelial cells (Figure 7B) and to a lesser extent in
stromal and endothelial cells. ACE2 RNA expression was mainly found in most
endothelial cells. TMPRSS2 RNA was mainly expressed in glandular epithelial cells
(Figure 7B) and some endothelial cells.
In the salivary gland, SARS-CoV-2 genomic and replicating RNA were detected in
most acini and salivary ducts together with strong detection of ACE2 and TMPRSS2
RNA (Figure 7C). SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA was also found in some stromal cells
and endothelial cells. ACE2 RNA expression was found in some stromal cells and
most endothelial cells but TMPRSS2 RNA was not found in these two cell types.
Within the small bowel, SARS-CoV-2 genomic and replicating SARS-CoV-2 RNA
were mainly detected in the enterocytes, accompanied by strong expression of ACE2

and TMPRSS2 RNA (Figure 7C). Additionally, ACE2 RNA expression was found in
mesenchymal stromal cells, muscle cells expressed both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 RNA.
In the endothelial cells, we detected ACE2 but not TMPRSS2 RNA.
In the pancreas, we detected genomic and replicating SARS-CoV-2 RNA in most
acinar cells, which colocalized with strong expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 RNA
(Figure 7D). SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA was also detectable in some stromal and
endothelial cells. ACE2 RNA was present in most stromal cells and some endothelial
cells, while TMPRSS2 RNA was only present in some stromal cells.
We detected genomic and replicating SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the skeletal muscle,
mainly localized in the myocytes (Figure 7E) and some endothelial cells. Moreover,
the muscle cells also expressed ACE2 RNA and TMPRSS2 RNA. In the endothelial
cells, we observed ACE2 RNA expression but not TMPRSS2 RNA.
Finally, we detected both SARS-CoV-2 genomic and replicating RNA in the dermal
epithelial cells (Figure 7F). The epithelial cells also expressed ACE2 and TMPRSS2,
while mRNA for both proteins was only sparsely detected in endothelial cells.

IHC of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein on FFPE autopsy lung samples
Protein detection of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein is widely used in studies in
FFPE tissues. We stained for the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein in the COVID-19
autopsy lung and selected the most commonly used antibodies based on previous
studies 19,22, targeting the SARS spike glycoprotein (Abcam, ab272420) and SARSCoV SΔ10 within S2 domain protein (Genetex, GTX632604). We have tested these
two antibodies on FFPE autopsy lung tissues with four different antigen retrieval
methods as outlined in the methods section. All approaches were unsuccessful, i.e.,
no positive signals could be observed, except the ab272420 using Tris-EDTA buffer

(pH 9) antigen retrieval. We validated this protocol on autopsy lung tissues from our
COVID-19 cohort and non-COVID-19 cases as negative controls, including 1) four
patients infected with influenza, 2) six patients who developed ARDS (selected nonsuperinfected areas), and 3) six patients who had no pulmonary pathology (Table 2).
These autopsy tissues were collected before the COVID-19 outbreak (from 2009 to
July 2019). All lung tissues showed variable but very distinct false-positive unspecific
stain, except for a single lung from the non-infected group (Table 2, Figure 8,
Supplementary Figure 3). Taken together, IHC based detection of SARS-CoV-2
using the two mentioned antibodies and protocols were not possible to establish or
not specific to detect the virus in FFPE tissues.

Visualization of SARS-CoV-2 by electron microscopy
Ultrastructural tissue preservation in autopsy material was rather poor and hampered
virus particle detection by electron microscopy. Autolytic processes before fixation led
to cell degradation and strong autolytic vesicle formation, resulting in many virus-like
particles, but not a single reliable SARS-CoV-2 detection, despite a thorough analysis
of all cases (data not shown).

Application of chromogenic in situ hybridization on external FFPE COVID-19
tissue samples
FISH requires fluorescence microscopes, which might not be available in all
pathologies performing autopsies, and the signal also faints with time. Therefore, we
also established the chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) for SARS-CoV-2
detection (Supplementary method, Supplementary table 3). We first validated the
CISH detection with the same positive and negative control probes used in FISH

(Supplementary Figure 4A-D). To validate the compatibility of our ISH detection of
SARS-CoV-2 in FFPE autopsies processed externally, we performed CISH staining
on an independent autopsy cohort consisting of nine COVID-19 patients received
from the Institute of Pathology, Hannover Medical School, Germany (Supplementary
Figure 5). We could detect SARS-CoV-2 genomic and replicating RNA in the
cardiomyocytes, intra-glomerular and alveolar cells, hepatocytes, pancreatic and
enteric epithelial cells, capillary endothelial cells in lymph nodes, and spleen
(Supplementary figure 5A-I). In the vicinity of the SARS-CoV-2 positive signals, we
also detected ACE2 and TMPRSS2 RNA in intra-glomerular cells, hepatocytes,
alveolar cells, pancreatic and enteric epithelial cells.

Discussion
We here comprehensively analyzed SARS-CoV-2 in tissues from clinical autopsies of
COVID-19 cases. We compared various methods, suggesting the most effective and
useful approaches for SARS-CoV-2 detection in autopsy tissues, focusing on routine
processing in pathology and thereby possibly the most wide spread adoption of the
methods. Using these methods, we have comprehensively analyzed a multitude of
tissues and cells for SARS-CoV-2 presence to perform a detailed correlation of virus
presence and potential pathology findings. We describe virus spread in several
tissues (i.e., thyroid, adrenal gland, prostate, large bowel and ovary) previously not
described and pin-point the localization to specific cells within each tissue.
Comparing various approaches routinely used in pathology institutes, the RNA
detection methods (either by RT-PCR, FISH or CISH) were proved to be the most
effective, specific, and suitable to use. In contrast, both immunohistochemistry and

electron microscopy turned out not to be suitable, confirming previous reports

11,23,24

.

When using RNA-based methods, a 2-step approach could be applied. First,
screening the cases and tissues using the RT-PCR, followed by a more complex and
time-consuming FISH approach only in positive tissues. We focused our approach on
FFPE tissue since this is internationally the most widely adopted tissue processing in
institutes of pathology and autopsy centers. Although formalin fixation and paraffin
embedding might lead to additional RNA degradation, FFPE material has the
important advantage of not being infectious and conservable, which makes further
processing much easier and more broadly applicable compared to, e.g., fresh
infectious tissue. Further, reliable detection in FFPE materials allows for fast
retrospective analysis, as FFPE blocks are regularly archived and widely available in
all institutes of pathology.
Compared to RT-PCR, the ISH detection method in FFPE autopsies could avoid the
interference of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the blood that remained within the tissues 9. To
precisely localize the signal, consecutive sections can be used, allowing a very
detailed association of morphology with positive signals, which is not possible in
FISH or CISH sections alone. Apart from the precise localization, the FISH approach
also allows colocalizing analysis of the viral RNA and its targets ACE2 and
TMPRSS2 on the cellular level. Compared to FISH, the CISH method has some
advantages, particularly not requiring fluorescence microscopy equipment, which
might not be readily available in all institutes, longer stability of the signals, and the
possibility of a faster digitalization of the slides using whole-slide scanners. On the
other hand, the FISH signals are easier to detect and provide a much better signal-tonoise ratio by adjusting the fluorescence excitation. Validation of the ISH on an
independent external cohort in our study confirmed its broad applicability.

previous reports on pulmonary and upper airway findings in COVID-19
SARS-CoV-1 autopsies

and

. The strong positivity for viral RNA, including the

antisense, as well as the co-localization with ACE2 and TMPRSS2 associated the
pathological findings with the viral presence and are also in line with previous reports.
We here provided comprehensive morpho-molecular analyses and examples of the
localization of the virus in various cells and compartments of the lung (i.e., squamous
metaplasia and giant cell), which were previously not reported.
Currently, COVID-19 is considered a multisystemic disease. Our data, showing the
viral presence, including replicating virus, in the majority of analyzed tissues, might
confirm this hypothesis. However, in our macroscopic and microscopic evaluation of
all extra-respiratory organs, we were not able to identify specific pathological
alterations that would be attributable to viral infection. We cannot exclude subtle or
molecular changes that were not translating to the morphological changes presented
in the infected non-respiratory tissues. However, our detailed analyses might suggest
that the SARS-CoV-2 spreading beyond the respiratory tract does not induce any
major pathology and might be rather negligible in comparison to the pulmonary
involvement, at least in fatal cases. Similar conclusions were also suggested in some
previous reports 10,20,29.
One hypothesis for the multisystemic nature of COVID-19 is the systemic spread and
effects on the (micro)vasculature 30. We show SARS-CoV-2 genomic and replicating
RNA and particularly TMPRSS2 RNA in the endothelial cells of vessels across all
organs, supporting this hypothesis. This, is supported by data showing SARS-CoV-2
RNA in the blood

31

. Besides, we also found the viral RNA in vessels across all organ

systems and pulmonary endothelial cells adjacent to thrombi, which might be a hint to

the microvascular damage induced by direct endothelial infection10. However, we
have only found vasculature with thrombi in the lungs, but not in any other of the
analyzed organs or tissues. This might be influenced by our relatively small cohort,
mainly consisting of intensive care unit patients who had been receiving
anticoagulative treatment. We have also been very cautious regarding the
interpretation of vascular occlusion as intravital thrombotic events in order not to
false-positively interpret post-mortem clots as intravital thrombi.
We showed the predominance of viral RNA in ACE2 and/or TMPRSS2- expressing
epithelial cells compared to mesenchymal stromal cells and endothelial cells in
various organs. This included e.g., trachea, lung, tonsil, salivary glands, kidney, and
small bowel. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in salivary glands supports the
effectiveness of saliva-based SARS-CoV-2 testing that has been emerged worldwide

lymph nodes, heart, and skeletal muscle

. We visualized for the first time

SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in exo/endocrine organs, i.e., in the thyroid, adrenal gland,
prostate, testicle, and ovary. Our findings in testicle are in line with previous reports
of detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in seminal fluid and testicular tissue with RT-PCR

hemorrhage or thrombosis have been described in COVID-19 autopsies

Concerning the thyroid, previous descriptions of follicular epithelial morphologic
alterations exist for SARS infection

CoV-2 RNA in cancer cells in two cases of pulmonary metastasis. This finding is in
line with a previous report of a positive RT-PCR result in oral cancer tissue of a
COVID-19 patient

Our study has several limitations. We have not found viral presence in a few of the
analyzed tissues, including bone marrow, esophagus, large bowel, and spleen. This
might be due to the low number of analyzed patients. We aimed to perform a detailed
analysis and cellular localization, which in the absence of reliable protein or
ultrastructural detection, required to perform FISH analysis. This method is timeconsuming, particularly when using co-localization with consecutive sections, making
it hard to apply in a large number of cases. Therefore, for more high-throughput
approaches, we suggest pre-screening of the cases and tissues using RT-PCR.
Our study is descriptive, provides a single time-point analysis of only fatal cases.
However, these are intrinsic limitations of autopsy studies. On the other hand, there
are no other approaches that would allow analyzing comprehensively all human
tissues in a comparable way. The variable degrees of autolysis in some tissue
samples might limit the efficacy of viral detection. This was particularly true for
electron microscopy, which was not applicable in our hands. Methodologically, in
some cell types with scarce cytoplasm and overlap with neighbouring cells, it was not
possible to allocate the ISH signal localization to a particular cell. We found a small
population of SARS-CoV-2 positive cells that were negative for ACE2 or TMPRSS2
RNA. This is most likely due to a sampling bias, given that the FISH or CISH slides
are extremely thin and only reflect part of the volume of the cells. An alternative

explanation might be that SARS-CoV-2 was suggested to enter host cells
independently of ACE2 and TMPRSS2

47

. Regarding the wide spread of SARS-CoV-

2 variants lately, it is unclear whether our RNA-targeted approaches would detect or
being interfered by the mutations, despite the fact that a pool of probes for detecting
different genomic sites of the SARS-CoV-2 is used in our FISH method.
In conclusion, our present study suggests that RT-PCR and FISH performed on
FFPE tissues are reliable methods allowing tissue and cellular localization in
autopsies. We provide a “cellular and whole body tissue atlas” of organ tropism
profile of SARS-CoV-2 in severe COVID-19 patients, suggesting a multisystemic
spread in virtually all cell types of infected organs.
