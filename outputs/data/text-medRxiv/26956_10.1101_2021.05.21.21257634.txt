Background: The EPICOVID19-RS study conducted 10 population-based surveys in Rio Grande
do Sul (Southern Brazil), starting early in the epidemic. The sensitivity of the rapid point-ofcare test used in the first eight surveys has been shown to decrease over time after some
phases of the study were concluded. The 9th survey used both the rapid test and an enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test, which has a higher and stable sensitivity.

Methods: We provide a theoretical justification for a correction procedure of the rapid test
estimates, assess its performance in a simulated dataset and apply it to empirical data from
the EPICOVID19-RS study. COVID-19 deaths from official statistics were used as an indicator of
the temporal distribution of the epidemic, under the assumption that fatality is constant over
time. Both the indicator and results from the 9th survey were used to calibrate the temporal
decay function of the rapid testâ€™s sensitivity from a previous validation study, which was used
to estimate the true sensitivity in each survey and adjust the rapid test estimates accordingly.

33

Results: Simulations corroborated the procedure is valid. Corrected seroprevalence estimates
were substantially larger than uncorrected estimates, which were substantially smaller than
respective estimates from confirmed cases and therefore clearly underestimate the true
infection prevalence.

37

Conclusion: Correcting biased estimates requires a combination of data and modelling
assumptions. This work illustrates the practical utility of analytical procedures, but also the
critical need for good quality, populationally-representative data for tracking the progress of
the epidemic and substantiate both projection models and policy making.

Brazil concentrates 10% of all COVID-19 deaths in the world while having only 2.7% of the
worldâ€™s population. As of February 28, 2021, Brazil is the country ranking second and third in
terms of deaths and confirmed cases, respectively. The situation was worsened the rapid
spread of a new variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the Amazon region in the North(1), which is
already circulating in other regions of the country, including the South region(2). Rio Grande
do Sul (the Southernmost state in Brazil) is facing the worst situation since the start of the
pandemic, with infections increasing at unprecedented rates. In February 27 2021, all
subregions of the state were, for the first time, classified as being in a critical situation based
on a controlled social distancing model that uses several indicators and was launched by the
Stateâ€™s Government in May 2020(3).

Rio Grande do Sul was one of the first regions in the world to have a large population-based
assessment of the COVID-19 epidemic. According to official statistics, the first case and the
first death in the State occurred in February 29 and March 24, 2020, and the first of a series of
10 serological surveys (collectively referred to as the EPICOVID19-RS study(4)) in the State was
caried out in April 11-13, 2020(5). Although a series of surveys starting so early on is useful for
accurately tracking the progression of the epidemic, tests then available that were suitable for
population-based studies had only been tested in recently infected individuals. In the
EPICOVID19-RS study, a rapid point-of-care test was used. Prior to the 1st survey, available
validation studies indicated the testâ€™s performance was sufficiently high for population-based
studies(6). However, future validation studies detected that the sensitivity of this test
decreases over time(7), an assessment that was only possible after some time since the
beginning of the pandemic. In the 9th survey, we used an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA), which has higher sensitivity than the rapid test that does not decrease over time7-8.
Changing tests between surveys hampers comparing different surveys, thus requiring
analytical procedures to properly utilize previous estimates based on the rapid test in
combination with the ELISA test to obtain a coherent picture of the pandemic in the state.

External data are extremely useful to furnish procedures to correct biased estimates. The more
data the lower the need for modelling assumptions. Typically, such data stems from official
statistics, such as registered cases, deaths, hospitalizations and other indicators. However,
such data have their own limitations, including dependence of testing policies and protocols,
fatality rate, change in treatment protocols, incompleteness and other factors that may
change both over time and among different locations.

Obtaining a coherent and likely more accurate temporal trend of how the epidemic in a given
location using real data is therefore a challenging task, requiring simultaneously and
coherently using different and imperfect sources of data, including official statistics, different
diagnostic tests and information from validation studies. This paper aims at obtaining the
cumulative prevalence of infection in Rio Grande do Sul from a series of nine population-based
serological surveys using a test with temporal variation in sensitivity.

denote, for example, the number of deaths, assuming that fatality is constant over time. In this
case,  represents the time when the infection happened, so that  denote the number of
new cases which ended up dying. If  denotes the number of deaths in time  , then the
appropriate representation would be        , where  denotes the number of days

That is, the proportion of infections that are still detectable   days after occurring can also be

If both that    and some function   are known,    can used to account for the decay
in sensitivity over time, and  can used to account for the temporal distribution of the
pandemic. However, in practice, typically only  #   âˆ‘  #  , where #   is the
number of deaths that occurred in a given day, is known. From this definition, #  
  1        and #    for   . Since the exact time of the
events within a day are unknown, an approximation can be made by assigning        to
all events that happened in day  , where   denotes the date when individuals were tested.
This is a good approximation because the    is unlikely to substantially change within a day

Similar to    in equation 1,   in equation 2 can be interpreted as a weighted average of
the proportion of detectable infections, where the weights correspond to the number of

In practice, #  can be obtained from official statistics. However, the assumption that  is
constant over time is required for equation 2 to yield a good approximation of . If this is
not the case, then  should be replaced with   . Moreover, it is unlikely that    is known
in practice. However, it can be estimated, for example, in validation studies. Therefore, !  
$ , which is the
is included in equation 2 instead of    . Finally, equation 3 includes 
estimated apparent cumulative number of infections estimated using a test with sensitivity
that decreases over time, according to   .

158
159

In the simulations, the population size decreases over time as infected individuals die. Deaths
due to other causes were not considered because we assumed that, aside from the epidemic,

160

the population size is constant over time. The parameter of interest is

161

To generate   , a hypothetical validation study involving 20 million individuals, all enrolled
in the day they were infected and each followed up for 400 days, was simulated by
independently sampling 20 million values for ( -( from their respective distributions.
Therefore, if (   (   (  )   * (   (   (  , then individual ' is detectable   days

We simulated a scenario of 4 population based serological surveys conducted at days  60,

The correction procedure was implemented as an iterated procedure. In each dataset, 2000
iterations of the correction procedure for each survey were applied. In each iteration,  # 
values for ( were sampled from its distribution. These were subtracted from the date of
symptom onset, which is assumed to be known for each death (as in our empirical application).
This yields a distribution of when individuals who died were infected, which is a valid indicator
of the relative temporal distribution of all infections under the assumption that fatality rate is
constant over time. This relative temporal distribution, in combination with the sensitivity
function   , was then used to calculate   and #  .

The EPICOVID19-RS study is a series of 10 large, population-based surveys aiming at tracking
the COVID-19 pandemic in Rio Grande do Sul. For this paper, only surveys 1 to 9 will be used.
Data collection for the 1st and 9th surveys occurred in April 11-13 2020 and February 5-7 2021,
respectively. The study involves nine sentinel cities â€“ that is, the largest city from each one of
the eight intermediate regions of the state as defined by the Brazilian Institute of Geography
and Statistics (IBGE). The exception was the metropolitan region, for which two cities (the
state capital and an additional city) were selected. In each city, 50 census tracts (delimited
areas with approximately 300 households each in urban area, also defined by the IBGE) were
selected with probability proportional to size and ensuring geographical representativity. In
each tract, 10 households were systematically selected. Between surveys, different households
were selected within the same tracts. One individual per households was randomly selected
for interview and testing using the rapid point-of-care lateral-flow WONDFO SARS-CoV-2
Antibody Test (Wondfo Biotech Co., Guangzhou, China), which assesses both IgG and IgM

Official statistics data were collected from a dashboard by the Health Secretariat of Rio Grande
do Sul website (https://covid.saude.rs.gov.br/) for the period between February 29, 2020 (the
day of the first confirmed case in the State) and February 28, 2021. All 497 city-level health
secretariats in Rio Grande do Sul provide information daily on several indicators relevant for
monitoring the pandemic in the state, and this information is publicly available per day and per
city. We used the daily absolute number of new deaths attributed to COVID-19 as an indicator
of the relative temporal distribution of infections in the State. As discussed above, this is only
valid under the assumption that fatality is constant over time. We also obtained the daily
absolute number of confirmed infections to calculate the cumulative prevalence of confirmed
infections for comparison with our corrected estimates.

212
213
214
215
216

The cities included in the survey have different population sizes, but all received the same
weight in the study (see below for a justification for this). Therefore, weights for each city were
generated for the official statistics dataset as the multiplicative inverse of the number of
deaths in the corresponding city. This ensures that the distribution of deaths in each city has
the same weight in the overall distribution of deaths. A similar weighting scheme was used
when calculating the cumulative prevalence of confirmed infections.

217

2.4. Statistical analysis

2.4.1. General description

219
220
221
222
223
224
225

The goal of the analysis is to combine different data sources to obtain a plausible temporal
description of the cumulative prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Rio Grande do Sul. The
main difficulty is that, in the first eight EPICOVID19-RS surveys, only the Wondfo test was used,
while both Wondfo and ELISA tests were used. The difficulty stems from the fact that,
according to validation studies, the sensitivity of the Wondfo test decreases over time(7).
Therefore, any Wondfo seroprevalence estimate after the very beginning of the pandemic is
likely to be an underestimate in comparison to the ELISA test.

226
227
228
229

It is in principle possible to use the results from the validation study to account for this
temporal decay in sensitivity, so that sensitivity is assumed to be smaller in later surveys based
on some indicator of the temporal distribution of the epidemic, and therefore correction
procedures will have a stronger impact on estimates from later surveys. In the 9th survey, the

230

Wondfo seroprevalence was

231
232
233
234

This difference in estimated seroprevalence is not compatible with our validation study,
suggesting that sensitivity of the Wondfo test in the field was lower than in the validation
study (possibly to the lower prevalence of highly symptomatic and/or severe infection cases in
the field, which could influence seroconversion and duration of antibodies over time)(13).

235

Therefore, the analysis requires two main steps:

236
237
238
239

a) Calibrating the results from the validation study so that the sensitivity it provides for the 9th
survey corresponds to the observed sensitivity, itself estimated by comparting the Wondfo
and ELISA estimates in the 9th survey (this simplified procedure for estimating sensitivity is
justified below).

240
241
242

b) Use the indicator and the calibrated temporal decay in sensitivity to obtain corrected
estimates for surveys 1-8. These corrected estimates can be interpreted as the expected
estimates had ELISA been used.

243

We now describe each one of these steps in detail.

244

2.4.2. Calibrating the temporal decay in sensitivity

245
246
247
248

The validation study (details on study design are provided in the Supplement) had data on the
date of diagnosis by RT-PCR and of testing by the Wondfo test (thus yielding the time between
diagnosis and testing), but not of symptom onset. Therefore, the validation study was reanalyzed in each iteration of the correction procedure. In each iteration:

249
250
251

â€¢ The validation study data was resampled without replacement. This allows incorporating
sampling variability in the validation study itself as in a non-parametric bootstrap
procedure.

252
253

â€¢

254
255

â€¢ A model for the change in sensitivity over time was then fitted by an automated model
selection procedure (see the Supplement for details).

256
257
258
259
260
261

â€¢ Since the validation study lacked data on sensitivity of the Wondfo test for recent
infections, extrapolation for the smallest value of   in the dataset to    0 was required.
However, the observed data does not capture the increase in sensitivity during the first
days following infection. This gap in the range of   was imputed by assuming that
sensitivity from    0 (assumed to be 1%) to the smallest value of   (using the predicted
sensitivity from the model) in the given iteration has a logit-linear relationship.

The process above generated (in each iteration) !   , which is the function describing how
sensitivity decreased over time in the validation study. As discussed above, the observed
differences in seroprevalence estimates from the Wondfo and ELISA tests in the 9th survey
were not compatible with our validation study. To account for this difference, we calibrated
!    into !    ;!  , where 0 * ; * 1.

The calibration procedure was performed by finding the value of ; using a one dimensional
optimization algorithm such that    (where  is the date of the 9th survey) is virtually

sensitivity of the Wondfo test in the 9th survey. This process ensures that    is (virtually)

sensitivity more compatible.

Importantly, this calibration procedure is arbitrary because many other transformations of
!    could be used. We decided to simply scale !    by a multiplicative constant because
this is a simple procedure that is rank preserving, therefore retaining the overall trends of the
original function. However, the calibration procedure is entirely numerical, thus being agnostic
to biological considerations. Nevertheless, the calibration does return a sensitivity curve that is
at least compatible to field estimates, which is the goal of the calibration procedure.

As described above, the temporal distribution of deaths was used as an indicator of the
temporal distribution of the epidemic. However, because the official statistics dataset does not
have data when infection occurred (which is indeed virtually impossible to ascertain), the
correction procedure was implemented as an iterated process. In each iteration, ( values
were generated and subtracted from the date at symptom onset (available in the official
statistics dataset), thus yielding the infection date  .

To calculate corrected cumulative prevalence estimates (denoted by <!# $ ) in surveys 1-8,
sensitivity (denoted by  $ ) was calculated as the weighted average of !    over the period
from February 29, 2020 to the given survey, where the weight that each date receives is the
sum of the weights (described in section 2.3.2) of all deaths with infection occurring in the

given date.

Table 1 displays the results of the simulation study. In comparison to the apparent prevalence,
corrected prevalence estimates were on average much closer to the true prevalence.
Corrected estimates were slightly biased upwards, but both bias and absolute deviation (that
is, the average absolute distance from the true prevalence) were of small magnitude.

Figure 1 shows the cumulative prevalence of infections. The solid line represents the
cumulative prevalence of confirmed infections. Estimates from the Wondfo test were not only
substantially smaller than corrected estimates (especially for later surveys), but also presented
a different overall pattern that would not resemble the remaining results even upon scaling.
Moreover, Wondfo estimates were implausible when compared to the cumulative prevalence
of infection according to official cases. Up to the 8th survey, the Wondfo and official cumulative
prevalence estimates were similar in the additive scale, but in the 9th survey the Wondfo
estimate was substantially smaller than the estimate from official statistics, which is a lower

In this work, we combined data from official statistics, a series of nine population-based
serological surveys and a validation study to estimate the cumulative prevalence of SARS-CoV2 infection in the State of Rio Grande do Sul (Southern Brazil) by adjusting estimates from a
rapid test into the expected result had the ELISA test been used instead. Corrected estimates
are likely more plausible than estimates using the rapid test, especially when compared to
confirmed cases from official statistics. The corrected result indicated that, as of late February
2021, cumulative prevalence of confirmed cases corresponds to about half of all cases
detected by ELISA.

Describing the temporal evolution of the epidemic is important for several reasons. First, the
true number of infections is required for calculating several important quantities important for
policy making, including fatality and hospitalization rates(16). Second, an accurate estimate of
the temporal distribution allows better calculation of quantities required for projections using
models of infection dynamics, such as the basic reproduction number and how it changes over
time, especially after specific events such as lockdown measures or social events that may lead
to overcrowding. Projections from disease dynamics models early in the pandemic were highly
influential and were one of the few sources of information then available. Although important
and useful, it must be noted that most early projects were necessarily based on preliminary
estimates from other diseases or from small, non-representative studies. Moreover, it is
difficult to a priori identify and incorporate all possible complex factors that may influence the
temporal evolution of the epidemic, many of which are local and difficult to measure. One year
after the first confirmed case in Rio Grande do Sul, there is substantial local data available
from official statistics and the EPICOVID19-RS study, thus allowing comparing initial projections
to the real figures to refine future projection models, which can now use local, real-data
estimates.

The study has considerable strengths. First, the EPICOVID19-RS study is a unique resource that
includes nine population-based seroprevalence surveys covered a period of about 10 months
and begun shortly after the first confirmed case in the State. Second, the distribution of all but
one of the transition times was based on local date. Third, the fact that both the rapid and the
ELISA tests were used in the 9th survey allowed us to calibrate the sensitivity function with a
result obtained in the field. Fourth, corrected results were more plausible than uncorrected
estimates, which underestimated even the cumulative prevalence of confirmed cases after the
8th survey.

An important limitation of the study is the need of many assumptions throughout the
correction process, including: fatality ratio is constant over time; and the sensitivity function
estimated in the validation study (which was enriched for symptomatic cases) is applicable to
the field (which includes the general population) after a calibration procedure. It is not
possible to empirically verify the assumption of constant fatality over time without making
additional assumptions that may lead to circular reasoning. Regarding the sensitivity function,
its validity can only be assessed by repeatedly applying the rapid test over time to individuals
sampled from the general population who had been diagnosed with known date. Establishing
such cohort would be logistically difficult and time consuming, requiring large initial sample
sizes to identify enough infected individuals. It should also be mentioned that the ELISA test is

itself not perfect. Indeed, there is evidence indicating that some individuals do not
seroconvert, and this may be associated with disease severity(13). Therefore, estimates
presented here must be interpreted as the cumulative prevalence of positive ELISA tests rather
than of true infections.

This study is not a definitive guide, but rather an example of the usefulness of integrating
different sources to correct estimates from an imperfect test to obtain a more plausible
temporal trend of the COVID-19 epidemic. Although the study demonstrates the practical
importance of analytical procedures, it also highlights the critical importance of good data,
including population-based estimates from initiatives such as the EPICOVID19-RS study, which
ideally should be performed using appropriate tests; extensive validation studies evaluating
how different factors (such as time since diagnosis) can affect the testâ€™s performance; and
good quality, transparent and freely accessible official statistics. Estimates from large and
populationally-representative data sources with sufficiently fine temporal is the best way to
track the progression of the pandemic and to substantiate policy making, and therefore
obtaining such data should be supported by funders and governments.
