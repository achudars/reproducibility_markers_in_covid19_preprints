Introduction

Cancer and the accompanying treatments are well established risk factors for
development of arterial (ATE) and, more frequently, venous thromboembolism (VTE) [1].
Cancer increases the risk of thromboembolism (TE) over four-fold that of the general
population and, for patients receiving active chemotherapy, the risk is up to 6.5 times greater
[2, 3]. For patients actively receiving outpatient chemotherapy, the monthly incidence of VTE
has been reported to be 0.8%, which is further increased in those requiring hospitalization [4].
Advanced stages of cancer and the initial period following diagnosis have also been associated
with increased TE rates. In addition to the increased morbidity, thromboembolic events are also
a leading cause of mortality in this population [5].
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) induced disease (COVID19) first emerged in December 2020 and was soon declared a pandemic by the World Health
Organization (WHO) [6]. As of January 2021, more than 160 million people have been infected
worldwide with COVID-19-related mortality reported globally as 2.07% [6]. Although the
disease primarily presents with respiratory symptoms, increased thrombosis rates have been
observed. A recent meta-analysis reported a 21% VTE rate and a 2% ATE rate in the overall
COVID-19 infected population [7]. Patients with COVID-19 and thrombosis have increased
mortality over patients without thrombosis [7].
The impact of thrombosis on survival has not, to date, been thoroughly investigated in
COVID-19+ cancer patients. A recent retrospective study noted a higher mortality in COVID-19+
patients with active cancer versus a COVID-19+ non-cancer group [8]. Thrombosis rates were
increased in both groups relatively to general population, but TE rates were actually lower in

the cancer group than in those without cancer: 14.2% (95%CI: 4.7%, 28.7%) vs 18.2% (95% CI,
10.2%, 27.9%) [9]. However, survival was significantly decreased in the cancer group and may
have been an interfering risk in this study. There were no data on whether patients with COVID19 and cancer who developed TE had a worse survival than those who did not develop TE.
Therefore, we sought to quantify the thrombosis events in a real-world study of COVID19 patients with active cancer during the beginning of the COVID-19 surge at a major tertiary
hospital center in New York. Our objectives were to: 1) report the incidence of thrombosis in
patients with active cancer and COVID-19; 2) compare the impact of thrombosis on mortality;
3) identify potential risk factors that led to increased thrombosis in this already pre-disposed
population, and 4) investigate any potential benefit of pre-emptive anticoagulation.

Methods

Study population

A cohort study was conducted in adult patients with active cancer and established
COVID-19 infection at Montefiore Healthcare System hospitals who were admitted from March
15, 2020 through April 10, 2020. Active cancer was defined as disease that had been treated
within the past year; patients with cancer off treatment for more than 1 year were excluded
from the analyses. Demographic, laboratory, radiographic and clinical data were extracted from
the electronic medical record (EMR) and hospital databases. The study was reviewed and
approved by the Montefiore- Einstein Institutional Review Board (IRB).

Identification of COVID-19 infection

COVID-19 infection was established with in-house laboratory testing using polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) test for SARS CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal swab (RealTime SARS-CoV-2
assay).

Identification of thrombosis

All imaging studies in the cohort were reviewed for identification of new ATE of VTE. The
population of the study was not subject to any imaging hospital protocols. Imaging studies were
ordered at the clinicians’ discretion and were solely based on clinical suspicion. Imaging studies
were evaluated even if initially ordered for other purposes. Patients with identified
atherosclerosis and no TE were classified into the “no thrombosis” group. In the case that an
already known TE was re-identified in imaging, it was disregarded. If two studies demonstrated
the same TE, this was only counted once. Because shedding of viral particles may have occurred
before positive testing and has been reported to still occur as long as 2 months in
immunocompromised and cancer patients, we extended the timeframe of our TE identification
to 30 days before and 30 days after the initial COVID-19+ test [9]. The reported (if any) d-dimer
(DD) values were checked throughout the study period and the peak values were noted.

Anticoagulation

Prophylactic and therapeutic anticoagulation (AC) data were collected. Institution
guidelines recommended that patients admitted with COVID-19 infection and D-dimer (DD)
level >3ug/mL or rapid increase of DD be started on therapeutic AC, but the initiation and
dosing of AC in the inpatient setting was ultimately at the clinicians’ discretion.

Prophylactic AC was either enoxaparin subcutaneously (SQ) 30mg or 40mg once daily,
unfractionated heparin SQ 5000 units two or three times per day or Apixaban 2.5mg twice daily
in patients not meeting more than one of the following criteria: age > 80 years, serum
creatinine (sCr) ≥1.5mg/dl and weight <60 kilograms (kg). Therapeutic AC was either enoxaparin
SQ 1mg/kg twice daily or 1.5mg/kg once daily, continuous heparin infusion (IV), apixaban 5mg
(with or without 10 mg loading) or 2.5mg twice daily for patients meeting ≥2 out of the 3 above
criteria, rivaroxaban or dabigatran. Patients were classified under the respective groups, i.e.
therapeutic AC vs prophylactic AC vs no AC, based on the AC dose administration before the
development of any new TE.

Statistical methods

Patients were categorized into two mutually exclusive groups, thrombosis and no
thrombosis, based on the identification of new TE within 30 days of COVID+ test. Descriptive
statistics were used to summarize demographic and clinical characteristics. Categorical
variables were compared using the chi-squared tests and continuous variables were compared
using Mann-Whitney rank-sum tests between relevant groups. Kaplan-Meier was used to assess
survival between the two groups. Logistic regression was used to define the risk of death. All
significance testing was two-sided with a P < 0.05 being indicative of statistical significance.
Statistical analyses were performed with IBM SPSS Statistics for Macintosh, Version 27.0.

During the study period, 218 patients with cancer and COVID-19 infection were
identified. One hundred and twenty-eight of these patients were excluded because they did not
satisfy the active cancer diagnosis. The study cohort consisted of 90 active cancer patients.
Of the 90 patients, 11 (12.2% of the cohort) were found with a new TE during the study
period, with two patients having 2 TEs. Eight events (61.5%) were arterial; 7 involved the
central nervous system (CNS) with 1 new cerebral vascular accident (CVA) and 6 newly
identified microvascular disease, and 1 patient developed new acute splenic infarcts. Five
events (38.5%) were venous, including 3 deep venous thrombosis (DVT) events, 1 pulmonary
embolism (PE) and 1 superficial venous thrombosis (SVT), which was provoked by a peripheral
venous line placement. Out of the 11 patients with new TE, 7 were identified before and 4 after
the date of the COVID+ test. All of the new TEs were identified in hospitalized patients; no TEs
were identified in the outpatient setting or simple ED visits.
Table 1

shows the baseline characteristics of the cohort. The median age was 69 years,

62.2% of the population were males and 45.6% were African Americans. Of those with
thrombosis, six out of 11 patients with thrombosis (54.5%) were males, 54.5% were African
American and 18.2% Hispanic. Sex, race and ethnicity were not different between the groups.
Hispanics constituted 31.1% by ethnicity. Common comorbidities were identified between the
two groups. Patients with kidney disease had a higher incidence of thrombosis (p=0.02), but
this was not true for other comorbidities, such as diabetes mellitus (DM) or obesity. BMI was
actually decreased in patients with arterial TE; median BMI (IQR), thrombosis vs no thrombosis,
24.3 (22.3 - 25.9) vs 28.4 (24.9 - 31.8) kg/m2, p=0.02.

The incidence of thrombosis was similar for both solid (12.1%) and hematologic (11.4%)
malignancies; the distribution of solid or hematologic tumor types was also not associated with
thrombosis (Table 2). Importantly, no patients with underlying lung, head and neck, pancreatic,
neurologic, hepatobiliary, neuroendocrine malignancies were found to have new thromboses.
There was no significant difference in TE between the myeloid and lymphoid malignancy
population within the hematologic malignancies. Among the patients with hematologic
malignancies, patients with lymphoma, myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), acute myeloid
leukemia (AML) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) did not develop new TE. Metastatic
disease, chemotherapy or immunotherapy administration within the past 30 days did not
increase the risk of thrombosis.

Course of illness in patients with COVID-19 and Cancer with and without thrombosis.

Table 3 details the course of illness for these patients. Seventy-three patients (81.1% of
the cohort) were hospitalized due to COVID-19 at least once during the follow-up period, 8
(8.9%) visited the emergency department (ED) at least once while the remaining 9 patients
(10%) were solely followed as outpatients. Of the hospitalized population, 7 patients (7.8% of
the cohort, 9.6% of the inpatients) needed intensive care unit (ICU) level of care, whereas 21
(23.3% of the cohort) needed intubation.
D-dimer levels were checked in 45 patients (50% of the cohort) during the study period
and 37 patients (41.1% of the cohort) had levels tested during the first 36 hours of admission.
The peak D-dimer value, during the total admission time and within 36 hours of admission, was
elevated in all patients and was not significantly higher in the thrombosis group (Table 3).

Anticoagulation data in the inpatient setting

Twelve out of the 73 inpatients (16.4%) received therapeutic AC, 38/73 (52.1%) received
prophylactic AC and the rest 23/73 (31.5%) did not receive any form of AC. Four of the 11
patients with thrombosis (36.4%) were identified with their new thromboses on the day of
admission, thus were not exposed to any form of prior AC.
Nine patients (75% of patients on therapeutic AC) had been on therapeutic AC at home.
Reasons for AC at home included atrial fibrillation (7 patients) and prior VTE (2 patients). The
remaining 3 patients were started in-hospital. One of the 3 was initially started on prophylactic
AC when admitted but was later switched to therapeutic dose because of concern for PE. Out of
the patients who received solely prophylactic dose AC, enoxaparin was given as first agent in
16/38 (42.1%), subcutaneous heparin in 15/38 (39.5%), and 2.5mg dose apixaban in 7/38
(18.4%).
All of the reported TE occurred in hospitalized patients. Of all 11 patients with new
confirmed TE, only 1 patient received anticoagulation (prophylactic AC) prior to the thrombotic
event. This patient was found to have new microvascular ischemic changes in the cerebral
white matter 3 days after being found to be COVID-19+. All other newly confirmed TE (in 10/11
patients, 90.9%) occurred in the setting of no prior AC. Anticoagulation significantly correlated
with fewer TE among the inpatients; any AC, TE vs no TE, 9.1% vs 79.0%, p<0.0001 (Table 3).

Survival

The thrombosis group was found to have significantly decreased survival within the first
30 days following the COVID-19+ test (shown in Fig. 1). Univariate analysis showed a hazard
ratio (HR) of 2.6 (95% CI:1.2 – 5.6, p=0.0009) for mortality in patients with thrombosis vs no
thrombosis. Nine out of 11 patients of the thrombosis group (81.8%) and 33 out of the 79
patients without thrombosis (41.7%) expired. Of note, 7 patients with thrombosis (63.6% of the
thrombosis group) expired within the first seven days since COVID-19 diagnosis.

Discussion

Cancer is a well-known independent risk factor for thromboembolism and COVID-19
infection has also been associated with a hypercoagulable state. A recent meta-analysis of 8271
COVID-19+ patients revealed 21% VTE and 2% ATE rate [7]. While recent studies have shown
that cancer is an independent risk factor for TE in patients with COVID-19 infection [10], the
characteristics and impact on survival of patients with COVID-19 and active cancer have not
been well described. Whether these two risks are synergistic or additive is unclear but with
hallmarks of disease being high fibrinogen and D-dimer levels in addition to elevated
inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin and interleukin-6 (IL-6) [11], it
may be important to determine.
The analysis of the present cohort is in alignment with the recent reports, showing
increased monthly incidence of TE at 12.2%, as compared to 0.8% of monthly TE incidence in
patients with active cancer and no COVID-19 infection [2]. Interestingly, the majority of our
events were arterial (8/13, 61.5%). This can be partly explained by the high number of
computed tomography (CT) scans of the head done in this cohort (total 20 CTs), which

identified 7/8 ATEs, as compared to studies done to detect VTE (7 CT chest with PE protocol and
12 DVT studies). It is also notable that patients with cancers historically associated with
increased thrombosis risk, such as pancreatic cancer and several hematologic malignancies, did
not develop any TE. Although many comorbidities, such as diabetes and obesity, have been
shown to independently increase the mortality risk in the COVID-19+ population [12, 13], these
did not seem to further increase the risk of thrombosis. Kidney disease was significantly
associated with increased TE risk, with 8/11 patients with TE (72.7%) having underlying CKD or
ESRD.
All of the patients with COVID and TE were inpatients. This is not surprising, given the
fact that inpatients were more likely to be afflicted with a severe inflammatory response, which
would further exacerbate their prothrombotic state. Mean hospital LOS was numerically higher
in the thrombosis group. Admission to the ICU or need of ventilation support was not
associated with a higher risk of thrombosis in our cohort.
Prior studies have shown that D-dimer levels seem to correlate well with the risk of
thrombosis in COVID-19 infected patients [14]. Patients with active cancer would have been
expected to have higher baseline D-dimer and may indicate a further prothrombotic risk in the
cancer population. In the early days of the pandemic, our institution had implemented a Ddimer cut-off value of 3ug/mL or rapidly increasing DD in order to initiate empiric therapeutic
rather than prophylactic AC. However, our numbers were too small to determine whether this
had any effect in our cancer population. Our data suggest that any type of AC, either
prophylactic or empiric therapeutic, seemed to protect against TE in our cohort.

Limitations

The present patient population was characterized by very high mortality following the
COVID-19+ test; in total, 29/90 patients (32.2%) expired within one week of COVID-19
diagnosis, 7 from the thrombosis group (63.3% of the group) and 22 from the non-thrombosis
group (27.8% of the non-TE group). Since almost one third of the non-thrombosis group
evaluated for new TE was censored early since they expired early after diagnosis, the
competing mortality risk may have led to underreporting of the real TE risk. Finally, because of
the high risk of exposure at the time, thromboembolic events may have been underreported
due to the inability to pursue the appropriate imaging tests.

Conclusion

Our study highlights that thromboembolism imposes an independent risk of mortality in
cancer patients with COVID-19. Further studies are needed to confirm our results and further
investigate the overall impact of thromboembolism in this patient population.
