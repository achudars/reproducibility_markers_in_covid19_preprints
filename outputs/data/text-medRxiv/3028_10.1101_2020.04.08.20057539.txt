KEYPOINTS
Question: Does the use of adjuvant therapy reduce progression to severe pneumonia in patients
with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)?
Findings: In this retrospective, observational cohort study involving 564 patients with confirmed
COVID-19, hypertension was an independent risk factor for progression to severe pneumonia
irrespective of age and those on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin
receptor blocker (ARB) therapy were less likely to develop severe COVID-19 pneumonia, while
nonspecific antivirals or chloroquine did not have significant impact on clinical progression.
Meaning: Hypertensive patients with COVID-19 should not have ACEI or ARB ceased, unless
there is a strong indication or further epidemiological evidence, given its potential protective
effects.

ABSTRACT
IMPORTANCE Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic associated with
high mortality and effective treatment to prevent clinical deterioration to severe pneumonia has
not yet been well clarified.
OBJECTIVE To investigate the role of several adjuvant treatments in preventing severe
pneumonia in patients with COVID-19.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Multicenter, retrospective cohort study of 564
consecutively hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 at Third Xiangya Hospital of
Central South University, Changsha Public Health Treatment Center, First Hospital of Yueyang,
Junshan People’s Hospital of Yueyang, Central Hospital of Shaoyang, Central Hospital of
Xiangtan, Second Hospital of Changde, Central Hospital of Loudi, and First Affiliated Hospital of
University of South China in Hunan province from January 17, 2020 to February 28, 2020; The
final date of follow-up was March 15, 2020.
EXPOSURES

Nonspecific

antihypertensives, and chloroquine.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The development of severe COVID-19 pneumonia;
Demographic, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were
collected and analyzed.
RESULTS Of 564 patients, the median age was 47 years (interquartile range, 36-58 years), and
284 (50.4%) patients were men. Sixty-nine patients (12.2%) developed severe pneumonia.
Patients who developed severe pneumonia were older (median age of 59 and 45 years,
respectively), and more patients had comorbidities including hypertension (30.4% and 12.3%,

respectively), diabetes (17.4% and 6.7%, respectively), and cardiovascular disease (8.7% and
3.2%, respectively) and presented with fever (84.1% and 60.4%, respectively) and shortness of
breath (10.1% and 3.8%, respectively) compared with those who did not. Nonspecific antiviral
therapy did not prevent clinical progression to severe pneumonia, although fewer hypertensive
patients on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers
(ACEI/ARB) therapy developed severe pneumonia in contrast with those on non-ACEI/ARB
antihypertensive therapy (1 of 16 [6.3%] patients and 16 of 49 [32.7%] patients, respectively
[difference, 26.4%; 95% CI, 1.5% to 41.3%]). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed
that hypertension without receiving ACEI/ARB therapy was an independent risk factor (odds ratio
[OR], 2.07; 95% CI, 1.07 to 4.00) for developing severe pneumonia irrespective of age. Besides,
none of patients treated with chloroquine developed severe pneumonia, though without
significance (difference, 12.0%; 95% CI, -3.5% to 30.0%) by propensity score matching.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Hypertensive patients on ACEI or ARB may be
protective from severe pneumonia in COVID-19 and hence these therapies should not be ceased
unless there is a strong indication or further epidemiological evidence. Though none of the current
antiviral and immunoregulation therapy showed benefit in preventing COVID-19 progression,
chloroquine deserved further investigation.

INTRODUCTION
The world has witnessed the rapid escalation of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), now becoming a global
pandemic.1 While many patients may be asymptomatic or experience only mild symptoms, reports
so far have identified the elderly and patients with chronic comorbidities such as hypertension,
diabetes, and cardiovascular disease to be at higher risk of progression to severe COVID-19
pneumonia, characterized by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and/or multiorgan
failure.

2-4

These severe patients require more intensive medical resource utilization and have

worse prognosis, with a case fatality rate about 20 times higher than that of non-severe patients. 5,6
While the implementation of effective prevention measures is essential, there clearly exists an
urgent need for interventions to modulate disease progression in the face of an increasing number
of infected individuals, which have overwhelmed the capacity of hospital systems in some
countries.
While there is no specific therapy for COVID-19, current progress with investigational therapies
includes the development and trial of a coronavirus vaccine and interrogation of several orphan
drugs in randomized control trials (RCTs).7 This includes remdesivir, which has garnered the most
interest in an ongoing adaptive RCT and other nucleotide analogues including ritonavir,
favipiravir and galidesvir.8 A recently published open-label RCT showed no benefit of the protease
inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir in reducing clinical severity or mortality associated with COVID-19,
despite in vitro evidence of activity against SARS-CoV-2.9 Other drugs of interest include
antiviral

therapy

(pegylated

interferon-alpha,

arbidol)

and

immunomodulators

(hydroxychloroquine) are also under investigation and results are eagerly monitored.10,11

Inhibition of the spike glycoprotein (S-protein) may also be a viable target and has recently
garnered increasing interest - particularly the potential interactions with angiotensinogen
converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). It is proposed that the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein to the
functional receptor ACE2 results in proteolytic cleavage by type II transmembrane serine
proteases (TMPRSS2).12-14 There has been considerable interest and debate regarding the risk of
severe COVID-19 pneumonia in patients on angiotensinogen converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI)
or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy, presumably through the modulation of ACE2
expression.4,15,16 The role of ACEI and ARB in COVID-19 infection remains controversial – as the
data is not adjusted for confounding factors of age and other comorbidities to definitively show
that ACEI or ARB are independently associated with worse outcomes – and of course, this does
not show causality either.17 Hence, various independent medical societies have put out position
statements that recognize the potential risks but given the current quality of evidence, recommend
against inappropriate cessation or switch from ACEI/ARB therapy for hypertension, given its
proven benefits.18,19
Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the role of several adjuvant treatments in
preventing severe pneumonia in COVID-19 patients from seven cities in Hunan province, China.

METHODS

Study Design and Participants

The Institutional Review Board of Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University approved
our study and waived informed consent for the retrospective nature of this study. All consecutive
adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were treated at Third Xiangya Hospital of Central

South University, Changsha Public Health Treatment Center, First Hospital of Yueyang, Junshan
People’s Hospital of Yueyang, Central Hospital of Shaoyang, Central Hospital of Xiangtan,
Second Hospital of Changde, Central Hospital of Loudi, and First Affiliated Hospital of
University of South China from January 17, 2020 to February 28, 2020 were enrolled. The
diagnosis of COVID-19 was established based on the World Health Organization (WHO) interim
guidance, and a confirmed case was defined as a positive result to high-throughput sequencing or
real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for nasal and
pharyngeal swab specimens. Patients without available clinical or imaging data were excluded.
The clinical outcomes including severe pneumonia development, discharge, and death were
monitored up to March 15, 2020.

Clinical and imaging data collection

We extracted the demographic, exposure history, comorbidities, clinical symptoms, and laboratory
data on admission from electronic medical records. Medication history among individuals with
hypertension was recorded, including ACEI/ARB, calcium-antagonists, β-blocker, and diuretic
agents. All laboratory tests were performed according to the clinical care needs of the patient
during hospitalization, including a complete blood count, assessment of liver and renal function,
coagulation testing, and measures of electrolytes, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase,
procalcitonin, and C-reactive protein. The use of antiviral therapy (arbidol, lopinavir/ritonavir, and
interferon α) and chloroquine were obtained from the medication administration record. The
severity degree of COVID-19 at the time of admission is defined as follows: (1) mild type, with
fever or respiratory tract symptoms but without radiological pneumonia. (2) moderate type, with
fever, respiratory tract symptoms, and radiological evidence of pneumonia. (3) severe type, with

one of the following: a) respiratory distress (respiratory rate ≥ 30 beats/min); b) hypoxia (oxygen
saturation ≤ 93% in the resting state); c) hypoxemia (arterial blood oxygen partial pressure/oxygen
concentration ≤ 300mmHg). (4) critical type, with one of the following: a) respiratory failure
requiring mechanical ventilation; b) shock; c) intensive care unit (ICU) admission is required for
combined other organs failure. In this study, severe COVID-19 pneumonia broadly included
severe and critical types.
The CT images were acquired on admission and at intervals of 3-5 days and were reviewed
independently by two experienced radiologists. Typical CT findings for COVID-19 were defined
as peripherally distributed multifocal ground-glass opacities (GGOs) with patchy consolidations
and posterior part or lower lobe involvement predilection.20 Each of the five lung lobes was
reviewed for GGO and consolidation. The lesions extent within each lung lobe was
semi-quantitatively evaluated by scoring from 0 to 5 based on the degree of involvement: score 0,
none involvement; score 1, ≤ 5% involvement; score 2, 6%~25% involvement; score 3, 26%~50%
involvement; score 4, 51%~75% involvement; score 5, > 75% involvement. The total score was
calculated by summing up scores of all five lobes to provide a lung CT score ranging from 0 to
25.21 The mean value of lung CT scores evaluated by the two radiologists was used for analysis.

Statistical Analysis

Our primary outcome of analysis was progression to severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Continuous
variables are presented as the median and interquartile range (IQR), and categorical variables are
presented as frequency and percentage. Differences between groups were analyzed using Student’s
t-test or Mann-Whitney U test for quantitative variables according to the normal distribution and
Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables. Meanwhile, the differences in

distributions were also reported using differences with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Univariate
and multivariate logistic regression with backward stepwise selection based on likelihood ratio
was used to identify the risk factors for the development of severe pneumonia, and the
corresponding odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were determined. We also employed the propensity
score matching (PSM) with a 1:1 ratio to minimize selection bias and adjust for the imbalance
between patients with or without chloroquine therapy. A one-to-one nearest-neighbour matching
algorithm with an optimal calliper of 0.2 without replacement was used to generate pairs of
patients. The analyses regarding different factors were based on non-missing data, and missing
data were not imputed. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS statistics software
(version 22.0, IBM SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). A two-sided P value of less than 0.05
considered to be statistically significant.

RESULTS

Patient Characteristics
The study population included 564 adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 from nine hospitals
in seven cities (Figure 1), and their clinical characteristics on admission are presented in Table 1.
The median age of patients was 47 years (IQR, 36-58; range, 19-84 years), and 284 (50.4%) were
men. 132 (23.4%) patients had comorbidities, including hypertension (n = 82 [14.5%]), diabetes
(n = 45 [8.0%]), cardiovascular disease (n = 22 [3.9%]), and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD, n = 16 [2.8%]). The most commonly self-reported symptoms at onset of illness
were fever (n = 357 [63.3%]), cough (n = 323 [57.2%]), fatigue (n = 87 [15.4%]), sputum
production (n = 51 [9.0%]), anorexia (n = 26 [4.6%]), and shortness of breath (n = 26 [4.6%]). A
total of 516 (91.5%) patients had typical abnormal findings on chest CT (Supplementary Figure 1),

with a median lung CT score of 6 (IQR, 4-11; range, 0-25).

Differences between severe and non-severe patients
In total, 69 of 564 (12.2%) patients were identified to have severe pneumonia. As summarized in
Table 1, these patients were older and more likely to have pre-existing comorbidities, including
hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, COPD, and chronic renal disease compared with
the non-severe patients. The clinical symptoms at illness onset also differed, with severe patients
more likely to present with fever and shortness of breath. Furthermore, patients with severe
pneumonia had elevated liver enzyme (aspartate aminotransferase [difference, -10.8; 95% CI,
-14.2 to -7.6; P < 0.001]), renal dysfunction (blood urea nitrogen [difference, -1.0; 95% CI, -1.4 to
-0.6; P < 0.001]), abnormal coagulation function (D-dimer ≥ 0.05 mg/L [difference, -18.3%; 95%
CI, -29.5% to -5.7%; P = 0.004]), raised inflammation-related parameters (lactose dehydrogenase
[difference, -112.2; 95% CI, -134.0 to -89.9; P < 0.001]), and worse lung CT score (difference, -8;
95% CI, -10 to -7; P < 0.001). However, lymphocyte count (difference, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.3 to 0.5; P
< 0.001) was significantly lower in patients with severe pneumonia.

Antiviral therapy did not prevent severe pneumonia
Thirty patients were classified with severe pneumonia on admission and were excluded, to leave
534 patients with non-severe COVID-19 on admission for further analysis. Amongst this group,
39 (7.3%) patients developed severe pneumonia during hospitalization. Most (n = 503 [94.2%])
patients received single or combined antiviral therapy during their admission. After adjusting for
age, gender, smoking history, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, COPD, and lung CT
score, none of these investigational antiviral therapies (all P > 0.05) were associated with reduced
risk of progression to severe disease, as shown in Table 2.

ACEI/ARB therapy in patients with hypertension
Eighty-two individuals were recorded to have hypertension and only 16 patients were on
ACEI/ARB therapy (including 6 cases receiving ARB monotherapy, 9 cases receiving combined
ARB and calcium-antagonist, and 1 case receiving AECI monotherapy). There were 49 patients on
non-ACEI/ARB antihypertensive therapy (including 39 cases receiving calcium-antagonist
monotherapy, 3 cases receiving β-blocker monotherapy, 2 cases receiving diuretic monotherapy,
and 5 cases receiving combined calcium-antagonist and β-blocker) and all were maintained on
their usual antihypertensive regimen during hospitalization. The remaining 17 cases were not on
antihypertensive medications or limited by unavailable data and received amlodipine or
nitrendipine to control blood pressure as necessary. As summarized in Table 3, hypertensive
patients on ACEI/ARB therapy had similar baseline clinical characteristics and laboratory findings
compared with those on non-ACEI/ARB antihypertensive therapy. However, patients on
ACEI/ARB therapy were less likely to develop severe pneumonia, in contrast with those on
non-ACEI/ARB therapy (difference, -26.4%; 95% CI, -41.3%~-1.5%; P = 0.037). Laboratory and
imaging data from 65 patients with hypertension during hospitalization were analyzed
(Supplementary Figure 2). Lactose dehydrogenase and CT lung scores were lower in patients on
ACEI/ARB therapy than those on non-ACEI/ARB therapy at about 3 days after admission.
To further confirm the clinical risk factors for severe pneumonia in COVID-19 patients, univariate
and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed (Table 4). Univariate analyses
identified age, hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease to be associated with the
development of severe pneumonia (all P < 0.05), but only older age (OR and 95% CI, 1.05 [1.03
to 1.07]; P < 0.001) and hypertension without ACEI/ARB therapy (OR and 95% CI, 2.07 [1.07 to

4.00]; P = 0.030) were independent risk factors in multivariate analysis. Compared with patients
without hypertension, hypertension on ACEI/ARB therapy was not associated with developing
severe pneumonia (OR and 95% CI, 0.41 [0.05 to 3.19]; P = 0.392).

Chloroquine therapy in non-severe patients
Among 534 patients with non-severe COVID-19 on admission, only patients in Changsha
received chloroquine therapy (500mg, bid). Thus, 192 non-severe COVID-19 patients without
receiving ACEI/ARB therapy in Changsha (25 patients with chloroquine therapy and 167 patients
without chloroquine therapy) were included and 25 well-matched pairs for comparison were
identified for comparison using PSM, with matched covariates of age, gender, hypertension, and
lung CT score (Supplementary Table 1). None of patients treated with chloroquine developed
severe pneumonia, though without significance (difference, 12.0%; 95% CI, -3.5% to 30.0%; P =
0.074). In addition, there was no significant difference in reported adverse events and ≥ Grade 3
adverse events between the two groups (P = 0.777 and 0.440, respectively).

DISCUSSION

In this study, we described the use of several adjuvant treatments in preventing severe pneumonia
development in COVID-19 patients. Hypertensive patients who received ACEI/ARB therapy had
a lower risk of developing severe pneumonia compared with those on non-ACEI/ARB
antihypertensive therapy, which suggested that ACEI/ARB therapy may be protective from severe
pulmonary injury for hypertensive patients. However, these results should be interpreted with
caution owing to potential bias and residual confounders in this observational study.
Consistent with earlier reports and clinical experience around the world, our cohort confirmed that

that older age and hypertension without ACEI/ARB therapy were independently associated with
developing severe pneumonia in COVID-19.2,3,22 The association between age and severe
pneumonia may be attributed to the accumulation of medical comorbidities with age or decline in
immune function over time. Given the close collinearity between age and hypertension, our study
adjusted for age by multivariate regression analysis and revealed that hypertension remained an
independent risk factor for disease progression irrespective of age for patients without receiving
ACEI/ARB therapy.
Our study examined the controversial topic of COVID-19 and ACEI/ARB therapy in hypertensive
patients. We found that hypertensive patients on ACEI/ARB therapy were less likely to develop
severe pneumonia, although we acknowledged that the analysis was conducted in limited sample
size - with only 16 of 82 patients on ACEI/ ARB therapy. The dynamic profile of laboratory and
radiological findings further showed that in patient on ACEI/ARB therapy, lactose dehydrogenase
and CT lung score were lower in than those on non-ACEI/ARB therapy at about 3 days after
admission. Together, these findings were suggestive that ACEI/ ARB therapy may be protective in
hypertensive patients with COVID-19.
COVID-19 patients with hypertension may endure worse outcomes due to decreased ACE2 levels.
ACE2, an important component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), is highly
expressed in both the lung and myocardium and converts angiotensin II (AII) into angiotensin 1-7,
which can downregulate ACE and directly cause vasodilatation.23-25 Downregulation of ACE2
level has also been shown in hypertensive animal models, although there has been limited success
in translational confirmation in human studies.26,27 None the less, this may be exacerbated by the
further reduction in available ACE2 following coronavirus infection. Both SARS-CoV and

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.08.20057539; this version posted April 10, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

SARS-CoV-2 can gain entry into the host cell through binding of the S-protein to the
membrane-bound ACE2 aminopeptidase, which then is cleaved by serine proteases to allow for
membrane fusion and invasion.14,28 Following infection, there is a reduction in pulmonary ACE2,
either through internalization with viral entry and/or downregulation of ACE2 enzyme during this
process. Hence this may exacerbate the lower baseline ACE2 function in hypertensive patients to
lead to the accumulation of AII and reduced angiotensin 1-7 and subsequently worse
immune-related cytolysis and lung injury, which was validated by the linear association between
elevated plasma AII level and viral load or lung injury in COVID-19 patients.29
The use of ACEI or ARB likely promotes feedback upregulation of ACE2 expression in
hypertension, although there are animal and human studies which have also found either no effect
or downregulation of ACE2 level in the setting of diabetes, hypertension or cardiovascular disease,
with or without ACE/ARB therapy.25,30-33 Nonetheless, this may explain our finding that
ACEI/ARB therapy can be protective in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further evidence that would
support this come from earlier studies in which ACEI/statins were protective in severe pneumonia,
recombinant ACE2 protected mice from lung injury following SARS-CoV infection, and RAAS
blockade reduced acute lung injury in rats injected with SARS-CoV S-protein. 34,35
Currently, there is still no specific treatment for COVID-19 except for supportive care. In our
cohort, 94.2% of non-severe patients received nonspecial antiviral therapy from just after
admission. The combination protocol and medication dose varied in different hospitals. However,
our results did not support any single or combined antiviral treatments to limit the progression of
COVID-19. In addition, none of 25 patients treated with chloroquine developed severe pneumonia,
though without statistical significance. This is unfortunately limited by the degree of heterogeneity

in our cohort and relatively small size. Chloroquine is known to block virus infection by
increasing endosomal pH required for virus/cell fusion, as well as interfering with the
glycosylation of cellular receptors of coronavirus, which has been confirmed to inhibit
SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.36-38 A recent openlabel nonrandomized clinical trial reported that
hydroxychloroquine combined with azithromycin is significantly associated with viral load
reduction/disappearance in COVID-19 patients.

39

Even so, more RCTs to assess the therapeutic

effects of chloroquine on COVID-19 need to be conducted.

LIMITATIONS

There were several limitations in this study. First, our study was conducted by retrospective data
analysis. Second, some cases had incomplete laboratory test results, given the variation in the
clinical management among different hospitals. All data generation was clinically driven and not
systematic. Third, because most patients had recovered and discharged at the time of data cutoff
and only 2 patients died during admission, the impact of adjuvant treatment on the clinical
outcomes cannot be analyzed. Forth, there were limited hypertensive patients who received ACEI
or ARB therapy, so we cannot analyze the effect of AECI and ARB respectively. A larger cohort
study of COVID-19 patients with hypertension from other cities in China and other countries
would help to further validate the potential protective effect of AECI/ARB therapy.

CONCLUSIONS

COVID-19 is a fast-evolving, global pandemic with high mortality from severe pneumonia, ARDS,
and multiorgan failure, with the highest risk in the elderly and patients with underlying
hypertension. The current adjuvant antiviral and immunoregulation therapies have not yet proven

ACEI or ARB therapy to limiting progression to severe lung disease in hypertensive patients.
