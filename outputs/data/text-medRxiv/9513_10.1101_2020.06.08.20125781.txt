Remarks on pooling Coronavirus tests
Alexander Pikovski, PhD; Kajetan Bentele, PhD
June 8, 2020

Abstract
Diagnostic testing for the novel Coronavirus is an important tool to fight the Covid-19
pandemic. However, testing capacities are limited. A modified testing protocol, whereby
a number of probes are “pooled” (that is, grouped), is known to increase the capacity for
testing. Here, we model pooled testing with a double-average model, which we think to
be close to reality for Covid-19 testing. The optimal pool size and the effect of test errors
are considered. Results show that the best pool size is three to five, under reasonable
assumptions. Pool testing even reduces the number of false positives in the absence of
dilution effects.

Introduction / Main
The fast global spread of the novel Coronavirus is responsible for current pandemic, known as
Covid-19. Diagnostic tests for the novel Coronavirus (nCov) are being employed worldwide. It is
self-evident that increasing the number of diagnostic tests is important to combat the epidemic.
Widely used tests for Covid-19 detect the novel Coronavirus RNA genome, using the realtime polymerase chain reaction method. The capacities for such tests, however, are limited by
the use reactants, machine time, lab personnel time, and overall logistics. Remarkably, testing
capacities can be increased by a modification of the testing protocol.
Combining probes from several individuals and testing them together reduces the total
amount of tests needed. This method, known as pooling or group testing, has been known
for a long time [1]. The main idea is: when probes from several people are mixed together
(pooled) and tested, the test will report negative when everyone is healthy and positive when
at least one person is infected.
This study deals with Dorfman’s classic two-stage protocol [1] (described below). More
complicated procedures have been devised; however, and we shall not consider with them
here.
The pooling method was validated for nCov tests by many laboratories [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. However, the following questions remained open, which we address in
this paper. 1) What pool size should be used? 2) How is the procedure affected by test errors?

Results
The two-stage procedure is as follows [1]. We denote the number of people in one pool, i.e.
the pool size, by M. Probes of M people are each split in two parts. One part is mixed together
with the others, while the other part is kept for later. The mixture is tested for nCov. Upon a
negative result, all the M people are declared healthy. When the result is positive, go to the
second stage. In the second stage, each of the M people is tested individually using the probes
that were put aside previously; the final test result is that of this second stage.

Pool size
Here we address the question: How many people should be pooled together?
We consider a “double-averaging” model (see Methods), where the prevalence is estimated
by a minimal and maximal value. Then, the results are only weakly dependent on the precise
values, for reasonable values. Taking the prevalence to be between 0 and 30%, we have the
result that a pool size of four is optimal; see Fig. 1 for other ranges. Pool sizes of three and five
give results which are close to optimal, see Fig. 2 for a comparison.
Therefore we recommend a pool size of four. Pool sizes of three or five can be used as
well, if that is more convenient for practical reasons.

Testing errors
Non-ideal tests produce erroneous results, which can be described by a false negative rate and
a false positive rate, or equivalently, by giving the test sensitivity and specificity.

Two sources of errors arise in pooled tests. First, each test that is performed is inherently
non-ideal and may give an error. These “single-test” errors are described by single-test sensitivity and specificity. Second, an error may arise if several probes are mixed together, due to
dilution of the material from each individual. Such “dilution errors” are plausible for large pool
sizes. We advocate small pool sizes (up to five), and at such small pool sizes no dilution errors
have been found in lab studies [2, 14, 11, 16, 4]. Thus, for our analysis we assume no dilution
errors.
The two-stage testing protocol leads to a modification of the overall error rates. For the
pooled sensitivity, one obtains that the sensitivity of the pooled test is equal to the square of
sensitivity of a single test. This means that the pooled sensitivity is reduced, and the number
of false negatives increased. The specificity of the pooled test, on the other hand, is increased
compared with the single test. (See Methods for details.) This means that the number of false
positives is reduced. The reason for this increase of specificity is, that probes with infection are
tested twice in pooling, but only once in individual tests. Figure 3 shows, as an example, the
improvement of the false positive rate compared to single tests.

colored area indicates improvement with respect to individual testing. Here the individual test
sensitivity is s = 90% and specificity z = 99%. Pool size is 4.

Methods
When tests from M people are pooled, then the pool infection rate p0 (i.e. the probability that a
pool is infected) is p0 = 1 − (1 − p)M , where p is the prevalence in the statistical population.
The number of tests performed during the two-stage pooling protocol (described above)
will be denoted by T. Its expectation value for a statistical population of N individuals with
prevalence p is E[T] = N/M+N−N(1−p)M , while the variance is Var[T] = NM((1−p)M −(1−p)2M ).
It is convenient to present the results in terms of the test ratio t = T/N, which is the ratio of the
number of tests performed with pooling to the number of tests without pooling. Smaller ratios
indicate better performance of pooling. A plot of the test ratio as a function of the prevalence,
with error bars due to the variance, is shown in Fig. 4.
The optimal pool size has been studied before and answer that has been given, e.g. [1, 4],
is strongly dependent on the prevalence. This, however, is of limited usefulness because (i)
the prevalence is unknown and (ii) it is unknown which statistical population is being sampled.
Instead we propose to consider the prevalence itself to be a random variable, drawn from
a uniform distribution. This amounts to sampling first from a population, and then sampling
from a population of populations. Such a model may be not too far from reality. Consider,
for example, one day a lab testing for Covid-19 all people from one workplace, another day

testing travelers returning from a town, and so on. The choice of a uniform distribution for
the prevalence suggests itself because nothing is known; such assumptions are known as the
principle of indifference.
We average the expectation value of the test ratio t = 1/M + 1 − (1 − p)M with respect to p,
when p is uniformly distributed between p1 and p2 . The resulting test ratio is: hti = 1/M + 1 +
[(1 − p2 )M+1 − (1 − p1 )M+1 ]/[(p2 − p1 )(M + 1)]. The results in Figures 1, 2 are calculated from
this expression.
The test errors can be calculated based on standard formulas for binary classification tests.
We assume no dilution errors (see above for explanation). This means, for example, that the
probability of obtaining a positive test result for one infected person is the same as for a pool of
M people where at least one person is infected, even though the pool may contain a different
amount of viral material.
Consider single-test sensitivity s and specificity z. The sensitivity and specificity of the
pooled test be denoted by s0 , z0 respectively. Following the two-stage protocol (as described

above), one obtains: s0 = s2 . For the specificity, one has the expression
z0 = z + (1 − p)M−1 z(1 − z) + (1 − (1 − p)M−1 )(1 − s)(1 − z)
Here M ≥ 2 is the pool size and p is the prevalence. The specificity of the pooled test is
increased compared to the single-test specificity, as the right-hand side of the expression is
always positive.
According to the double-average model, the expression for z0 can be averaged over a uniform distribution of prevalences. This gives
hz0 i = 1 − s + sz + [(1 − p2 )M − (1 − p1 )M ]/[(p2 − p1 )M](1 − z)(1 − s − z).
A plot, for some example values, is shown in Fig. 3.

Conclusions
Pooling of tests allows to increase the test capacity for Covid-19 testing. For the classic twostage protocol, a pool size of four is recommended, based on our model. In the absence of
dilution errors, testing errors do not adversely affect the outcome.
