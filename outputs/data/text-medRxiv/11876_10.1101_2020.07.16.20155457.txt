A​BSTRACT
BACKGROUND
The nocebo effect is any harmful reaction following a negative suggestion. Anxiety
can be seen as a manifestation of a nocebo context. The psychological stress of the
COVID-19 pandemic led some people to experience COVID-19 symptoms, which
were not actually related to a COVID-19 infection. A fundamental goal during the
COVID-19 pandemic is to limit the COVID-19 related demand on healthcare systems
and to minimize COVID-19 related deaths. This exploratory study aims to determine
to what extent the anxiety in the population is related to the number of covid-19
related hospitalizations and deaths.
METHODS
We will quantify the magnitude of the relationship between population anxiety and
hospitalizations / deaths. Anxiety will be assessed using the results of the most
frequently used anxiety measuring scale. Official websites of governments will be
screened to determine hospitalizations and deaths.
Studies will be included if they had at least 100 respondents, used a validated
anxiety scale, reported on the general population of a country, and were conducted
during the Covid-19 pandemic. A search strategy will take into account the limited
resources for this study and will be used to search Pubmed, MedRXiv and
PsychRXiv. Screening will take place at two levels: abstracts and titles, followed by

full text reports. One researcher will extract data which will be double checked by a
second researcher.
We will perform weighted OLS regression to quantify the relationship of anxiety and
covid-19 related hospitalizations / deaths.
DISCUSSION
Covid-19 related measures can carry a significant social cost and risk of unwanted
effects; it is therefore important to assess the extent to which anxiety in the
population is related to covid-19 related hospitalizations or deaths. If anxiety can be
properly reduced in the population, health care will be safeguarded. Thus, any
strategy that reduces anxiety can then be included in evidence-based decision
making.

I​NTRODUCTION
The nocebo effect is any harmful reaction following a negative suggestion. That
suggestion can arise from conscious and unconscious meanings that have actions,
objects or words. This creates negative expectations that can also harm health ​(1)​.
When they appear within a medical care context, the Hippocratic Oath “primum non
nocere” is compromised.
Anxiety can be seen as a manifestation of a nocebo context. Negative expectations
are not in proportion to the real threat. For example, because the anxiety is related to
misinterpreting a catastrophe, and mainly driven by metacognitive beliefs ​(2)​. For
example, people who expected to get the flu before the flu season also had the flu
more often afterwards ​(3)​.
The psychological stress of the COVID-19 pandemic led some people to experience
COVID-19 symptoms, which were not actually related to a COVID-19 infection. This
can be seen as a nocebo answer. News and social media may reinforce the negative
expectations of larger groups of people by repeating statements that everyone can
be affected ​(4–6)​. During the 2009-2010 H1N1 influenza pandemic, the tendency to
exaggerate the likelihood and severity of infection caused much anxiety that led to a
massive psychogenic illness ​(7)​.
A fundamental goal during the COVID-19 pandemic is to limit the COVID-19 related
demand on healthcare systems and to minimize COVID-19 related deaths. Looking

back at another known virus, HIV, it was seen that anxious but healthy people visited
the hospital to take an HIV test, often as a reassurance from the anxiety of being
infected. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, this behavior may inadvertently
lead to further spread of hospital acquired (nosocomial) infections and overload the
healthcare system. For example, intensive care physicians report an influx of
patients who can better contact their GP ​(8,9)​. The pressure to test can also lead to
higher numbers of false positives. Which further fuels the pandemic anxiety
unnecessarily ​(10)​.
30 years of research show a clear link between psychological stress and the human
immune system ​(11)​. It is well understood that chronic stress is a major modulator of
immunity and thus directly influences probability of infection ​(12)​. For example,
colleagues recently found a link between depression and the immune responses
measured in the blood after a covid-19 infection ​(13)​. It is therefore plausible that
populations under stress have a lower resistance, which can be a breeding ground
for the SARS-CoV-2 virus (stress as a virus niche).
According to a study in the UK, psychological factors such as stress and an existing
mental illness increase the risk of covid-19 hospitalization ​(14)​. In the general world
population, there is a positive relationship between the psychological well-being for
the COVID-19 pandemic and the chance of COVID-19 related survival ​(15)​.
This exploratory study aims to determine to what extent the anxiety in the population
is related to the number of covid-19 related hospitalizations and deaths.

M​ETHODS
We will collect all studies that assessed anxiety, as measured by a validated scale,
during the Covid-19 pandemic in the general population.
A search strategy will take into account the limited resources for this study and will
be used to search Pubmed, MedRXiv and PsychRXiv. At PubMed we will use a
combination of controlled vocabulary (MeSH terms) and free text words. Three
concepts will be combined: "COVID-19 or coronavirus" AND [(validated scales for
anxiety or depression) OR (psychological health)] (see Appendix 1 for search
strategy).
One researcher (FF) will scan manually the titles and abstracts. Full texts of
potentially relevant studies will be collected. Multiple reports for the same study will
be linked. FF will screen the full texts for possible inclusion.
Studies will be included if they had at least 100 respondents, used a validated
anxiety scale, reported on the general population of a country, and were conducted
during the Covid-19 pandemic. For every anxiety measuring scale, the number of
studies using it will be counted. Finally, only those studies that reported the most
commonly used scale will be included for the analysis.
The data extraction will be double checked by a second researcher (AN). Any
non-matching value will be mutually resolved and the resulting value will be adopted
after a common agreement.

Because we assume significant inaccuracies in the representativeness of the survey
results, we will build an ad hoc imprecision tool with the aim of assigning a weight
per study. For this purpose, the final set of included studies will be examined for
reported factors significantly impacting the anxiety scores. Their mean absolute
impact on the score will be determined. Afterwards, the relative importance per
predictor will be determined by calculating the z-score relative to the average impact.
We will rank the predictors mentioned in at least half of the studies. Values for these
predictors will be extracted.
Official websites of governments will be screened to determine hospitalizations and
deaths. In case of missing figures, contact will be made by email. Authors of the
included studies will also be asked where relevant data can be found.
Data will be extracted in a spreadsheet. If there were different dates of data
collection, the period that is the earliest in the epidemic wave will be chosen. For
every study we will calculate the number of new covid-19 related hospitalisations or
deaths up to 30 days after the closing data of the studies data collection.
Weighted OLS regression will be used to quantify the relationship of anxiety and
hospitalizations / deaths. Weighting consists of (1 / [variance] x [imprecision]) x
[population size]). For countries with multiple studies, a one pooled estimate will be
calculated by a generic inverse variance meta-analysis. A random effects model will
be chosen because we foresee the included studies will have considerable
methodological (study design, risk of bias) heterogeneity. A restricted maximum

likelihood random effects variance component model will be chosen to allow for
residual variance.
Missing study data will be requested from the authors. In case of no response, a
second reminder email was sent.
Analyzes will be done with R ​(16) and data will be imported from Apache OpenOffice
spreadsheet ​(17) with package readODS ​(18)​, data manipulation with tidyverse ​(19)​,
and meta-analyzes with package metafor ​(20)​.

D​ISCUSSION
This study will test the hypothesis that that population anxiety during the covid-19
epidemic may be associated with covid-19 related hospitalisations or deaths. The
results can be used to understand to what extend anxiety in the population can put a
stress on the healthcare system. Also to become more critical as to what are
possible sources of anxiety. Given the already high societal cost to prevent covid-19
related hospitalisations and deaths, it is crucial to address whether anxiety worsens
the situation or not. Latest data from France and Belgium indicate that when the
epidemic wave subsides, anxiety also decreases ​(21,22)​. The anxiety curve seems
to follow the epidemic curve quite well.

S​TRENGTH​ ​AND​ ​WEAKNESSES
Our research efforts will be the first to investigate world population anxiety and the
relation with convid-19 related burden on public health. We will examine the impact
of anxiety across all available evidence. Therefore, we will use an extensive and
systematic search for eligible studies. Data extraction will be checked independently
by a second researcher. We will cater upon the open science framework. All study
processes will be transparent, analysis will be shared, and data will be publicly
available.
One possible limitation of the study is that we will use reported study data only,
which may not be an accurate representation of actual study conduct: reporting can
be poor but study conduct can be good, and vice versa. Secondly, we are evaluating
only results from one commonly used anxiety measurement scale, albeit across a
comprehensive set of studies. Thirdly, by the nature of the current epidemic, we will
likely include many preliminary research findings through preprint, which lessens the
robustness of findings. Fourth, This study will be observational. So it does not allow
statements about directionality or causality. As studies represent data at the
population level, it will not be valid to make statements about the individual chances
of people being hospitalized or dying from anxiety. Fifth, precision of findings is likely
to be limited as countries register hospitalizations and deaths related to Covid-19 in
different ways. Also cross-sectional surveys are rarely representative due to various

sources of bias. However, we will use the available data by applying an imprecision
weight, calculated according to an ad hoc imprecision tool.

I​MPLICATIONS​ ​FOR​ ​RESEARCH
Following the covid-19 pandemic, governments are trying to take effective measures
to protect public health. However, little quantitative evidence is available on the
relationship between anxiety and Covid-19 related hospitalizations or deaths. As a
result, this psychological phenomenon is largely ignored in policy decisions.
However, for decades yet, evidence has shown that anxiety and depression
significantly weaken the immune system. The findings of this study will provide
insight into the magnitude of the relationship between anxiety and Covid-19 related
health harms. By quantifying this relationship, we hope health professionals
incorporate these effects into treatment strategies and inform patients of the
importance of a calm mind. We also hope that governments incorporate our findings
into measures and communications that promote Covid-19 related public health. In
addition, the results of this study may encourage a further study that helps clarify the
impact of anxiety or other psychological problems on Covid-19 related hospitalization
or death.
