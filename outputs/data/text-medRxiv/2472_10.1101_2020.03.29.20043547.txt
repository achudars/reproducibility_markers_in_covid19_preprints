Abstract
Background
In December 2019, some COVID-19 cases were first reported and soon the disease broke out.
As this dreadful disease spreads rapidly, the mass media has been active in community
education on COVID-19 by delivering health information about this novel coronavirus.
Methods
We adopted the Huike database to extract news articles about coronavirus from major press
media, between January 1st, 2020, to February 20th, 2020. The data were sorted and analyzed
by Python software and Python package Jieba. We sought a suitable topic number using the
coherence number. We operated Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling with the
suitable topic number and generated corresponding keywords and topic names. We divided
these topics into different themes by plotting them into two-dimensional plane via
multidimensional scaling.
Findings
After removing duplicates, 7791 relevant news reports were identified. We listed the number
of articles published per day. According to the coherence value, we chose 20 as our number
of topics and obtained their names and keywords. These topics were categorized into nine
primary themes based on the topic visualization figure. The top three popular themes were
prevention and control procedures, medical treatment and research, global/local
social/economic influences, accounting for 32·6%, 16·6%, 11·8% of the collected reports
respectively.
Interpretation
The Chinese mass media news reports lag behind the COVID-19 outbreak development. The
major themes accounted for around half the content and tended to focus on the larger society
than on individuals. The COVID-19 crisis has become a global issue, and society has also

become concerned about donation and support as well as mental health. We recommend that
future work should address the mass media’s actual impact on readers during the COVID-19
crisis through sentiment analysis of news data.

Evidence before this study
The novel coronavirus related news reports have engaged public attention in China during the
COVID-19 crisis. Topic modeling of these news articles can produce useful information
about the significance of mass media for early health communication. We searched the Huike
database, the most professional Chinese media content database, using the search term
“coronavirus” for related news articles published from January 1st, 2020, to February 20th,
2020. We found that these articles can be classified into different themes according to their
emphasis, however, we found no other studies apply topic modeling method to study them.

Added value of this study
To our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate the patterns of health communications
through media and the role the media have played and are still playing in the light of the
current COVID-19 crisis in China with topic modeling method. We compared the number of
articles each day with the outbreak development and identified there’s a delay in reporting
COVID-19 outbreak progression for Chinese mass media. We identify nine main themes for
7791 collected news reports and detail their emphasis respectively.

Implications of all the available evidence
Our results show that the mass media news reports play a significant role in health
communication during the COVID-19 crisis, government can strengthen the report dynamics
and enlarge the news coverage next time another disease strikes. Sentiment analysis of news
data are needed to assess the actual effect of the news reports.

Background
In December 2019, some pneumonia cases caused by an unknown pathogen were first
reported in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and similar cases were soon reported in other provinces of
China. The physicians and pathologists initially reported an “atypical pneumonia”, meaning a
different type of pneumonia that was not caused by any of the three common pathogens,
including Streptococcus pneumonia, Hemophilus influenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis. After

multiple sample collections and laboratory analyses, the pathogen was identified as a novel
coronavirus, and the disease was named as COVID-19 by the World Health Organization
(WHO) on February 11th, 2020 1. The virus was named “SARS-CoV-2” by the International
Committee of Taxonomy of Viruses 2.

Patients suffering from COVID-19 typically presented with fever, cough, and myalgia or
fatigue. Less common manifestations included sputum production, headache, hemoptysis,
and diarrhea. Abnormal chest CT images were found in all patients, and more than 50% of
patients developed dyspnea. Some patients in critical condition might even die 3. Evidence
shows that droplet transmission through the respiratory tract and close contact transmission
are the two main transmission routes of COVID-19, while the aerosol transmission is a
possible transmission route when people are exposed to high concentrations of virus aerosol
in a relatively closed environment for some time 4. According to the National Health
Commission (NHC) of the People’s Republic of China, until February 2020, there had been
approximately 80000 confirmed cases and more than 2000 deaths in China 5. Other countries,
such as Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Singapore, and the United States, also reported
COVID-19 cases in their countries 6. Although the cases at the early stage in these countries
were identified as imported cases from Wuhan or other cities in Hubei province, some
domestic cases and local transmission have also been reported.

The rapid spread of COVID-19 has already caused great public attention, and many heated
discussions, and the Chinese mass media have been reporting relevant information about the
virus and the outbreak. As effective public health measures are required to be implemented in
time to avoid the breakdown of the health system 7, the media certainly can play a crucial role
in conveying updated policies and regulations from authorities to the citizens.

Besides, since no COVID-19 vaccine is yet available, each citizen should be aware of the
harm caused by this novel coronavirus, the prevention methods, and the designated hospital
in their local area to access at any point in time. If misleading or incorrect information was
transmitted to the public, citizens might feel panic and thus make a panic purchase and try
unnecessary or even detrimental medicine regimens. Therefore, it requires the mass media
information dissemination activities in conjunction with the health stakeholders to help
individuals, authorities, government, and other stakeholders to understand the precarious

global and public health condition posed by the COVID-19 and identify health-related
knowledge and training required in facing the menace.

Given the desire to know whether the media work efficiently in delivering the latest COVID19 information to the public audience, Major media reports were collected and analyzed.
Multimodal data modeling can combine multiple information from various resources. To
cope with multimodal data, topic modeling is used. Topic modeling is a type of statistical
model that arranges unstructured data structurally in accordance with latent themes. In this
way, we could investigate the patterns of health communication through the media and the
role the media that have played so far during the COVID-19 crisis in China.

Methods
Data collection
We collected Chinese news and related articles on COVID-19 from January 1st, 2020, to
February 20th, 2020. We then applied the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) modeling
method to derive useful information from these news reports.

Chinese news and related articles data were collected from the Huike database. The Huike
database is one of the most professional, ever-growing Chinese media content databases,
containing the news and article data from more than 1500 print media and over 10,000
internet media. The news and articles data in the Huike database are updated in a timely
manner 8.

To gain insights into the early period of health communication information about coronavirus,
we conducted a search with the keyword “coronavirus” in the Huike database.
LDA is a generative probabilistic topic modeling method that is widely applied in text mining
9

, medicine

10,11

, and social network analysis

12

due to its excellent capability of converting

visual words into images and visual word document

13-15

. It is a generative statistical model

with a three-level hierarchical Bayesian model. The basic assumption of this model is a
combination of words belonging to different topics

16

. LDA indicated that there may be

various topics in an article and that the wording in that article is attributable to one of its
topics. We can discover the topics among the data pool by using Gibbs Sampling techniques

Processing
Eleven-thousand-two-hundred-twenty articles were found with keyword search “coronavirus”,
dated between January 1st, 2020 and February 20th, 2020. After cleaning the data, 7791
articles remained.

Before applying LDA modeling, we used Python to perform data cleaning and used the
Python package Jieba for data process 18,19. The detailed data process is illustrated in Figure 1.
We next removed Chinese common stop characters, such as “ten”, “a”, “of”, and “it”. We also
built a document-term matrix (DTM) and used TF-IDF to process the data.

To seek a suitable LDA topic number and the explanations to investigate the relationship
between COVID-19 crisis and news reports, we conducted multiple studies. For the selection
of a suitable number of topics, we used a coherence score to evaluate

20

. Topic coherence

measures the consistency of a single topic by measuring the semantic similarity between
words with high scores in a topic, which contributes to improving the semantic understanding
of the topic. That is, words are represented as vectors by the word co-occurrence relation, and
semantic similarity is the cosine similarity between word vectors. The coherence is the
arithmetic mean of these similarities 21. We used Coherence Model from Gensim, the python
package for natural language processing, to calculate coherence value 22. According to Figure
2, the coherence score increased and reached a stable score as the number of topics increased
to 20, then declined after the number of topics reached 25. However, we found that the result
could be uninterpretable for humans if only statistical measures were applied 23. As a result,
we combined statistical measures and manual interpretation and chose 20 topics to analyze
with the help of Python 3.6.1 version and LDAvis tool 16. We set λ = 1 and set 20 topics and
their keywords. Topics’ names were generated according to their corresponding keywords to
expatiate the topics.

We also divided these topics into different themes to study them better. In the visualization, as
in the two-dimensional plane (Figures 3 and 4), 20 topics were represented as cycles. These
circles overlapped, and their centers are determined by computed topic distance

16

. By this

approach, these 20 topics were classified into nine main primary themes and are shown in
Table 1.

Figure 5 shows that the number of relevant news slightly increased after a new death was

18

reported on 9 January 2020. Between 20 to 23 Jan 2020, we observed a sharp increase of

19

relevant news. As the daily news cases decreased since 4 Jan 2020, the number of daily news

20

reports began to drop. The increase in the number of cases on 12 and 13 Feb was due to the

21

updated diagnosis criteria in the COVID-19 protocol (fifth version) 26.

analysis, Theme 4 (Prevention and control procedures) was the most popular theme, accounting

25

for 32·6% of the total. Theme 3 (Medical treatment and research) was involved in about 16·1%

26

of the related news. Theme 7 (Global/local social/economic influences) was included in 11·8%

27

of all news reports of coronavirus. The other six themes each account for less than 10% of news

28

stories. Theme 1 (Confirmed cases) was related to 9·6%. Themes 8 (Materials supplies and

Discussion

59

60

The COVID-19 crisis has aroused great public concern not just in China but also around the

61

world. Topic modeling provides an alternative perspective to investigate the relationship

62

between media reports and the COVID-19 outbreak. We collected media reports and used topic

63

modeling to analyze them. Although several COVID-19 cases were found in December 2019,

64

we observed few news reports about it, showing that the press media did not focus on this
13

65

disease at that time. As the outbreak became severe and more pneumonia cases were confirmed,

66

the number of news reports began to steadily increase, then rapidly increase on January 19th,

67

2020. It takes time and rigorous effort for journalists to choose a topic, investigate the situation,

68

collect data, and verify the authenticity of the material before they can finally present the news.

69

As a result, a delay is unavoidable in most cases. Therefore, mass media news reports lag

70

behind the real-time coronavirus developments, indicating that the media does not play an

71

adequately forewarning function in public health communication and sensitization.

72

73

The topics focused by mass media can be divided into nine classifications. Theme 4

74

(Prevention and control procedure), and Theme 3 (Medical treatment and research) are two

75

major themes that together accounted for around half of the content. The management of

76

important government departments and medical institutions and community control methods

77

are also emphasized. Positive and enthusiastic forecasts backed with active public health

78

interventions are disseminated, which can eliminate the unnecessary public worry and extreme

79

panic, in the meantime aimed at asserting the nation’s confidence in virus containment and

80

victory within a short period.

81

82

Control of sources of infection, interruption of transmission routes, and protection of

83

susceptible people are three major principles to prevent and control infectious diseases. To cope

84

with the COVID-19 crisis, the Chinese government also take measures based on these three

85

principles. The detection of viral infections within public transportation networks aroused great

86

public concerns, given that the outbreak coincided with the spring festival, when many are

87

traveling. Few news reports about this are included in Theme 4 (Prevention and control

88

procedure), suggesting that the mass media might not have been providing sufficient health

89

information about detection within the transportation network.

90

91

The scale of medical treatments and research was the second most popular topic. Our results

92

show that the mass media convey this kind of health information by paying attention to the

93

detection of suspicious cases, drugs that might cure patients, and the transmission route of the

94

virus. However, reports about Theme 4 (Prevention and control procedure) and Theme 3

Influences on activities (home and abroad) were also reported, together with economic

influences, included in Theme 7 (Global/local social/economic influences). These data indicate

100

that the impact of the COVID-19 crisis is not limited to the medical field, but also social and

101

economic fields. It is also a global health issue that requires people around the world to work

102

closely together.

103

104

The term “confirmed cases” appeared in 9·6% of the articles. This indicates that the mass media

105

has served a public health function because case number and its changing rates in news reports

106

can directly give the public intuitive feelings about the speed of viral spread, momentum, and

107

the hazard of this coronavirus. It can also help citizens remain alert about virus transmission

108

and, therefore, change their daily habits accordingly.

109

110

Theme 2 (Medical supplies) and Theme 8 (Materials supplies and society support) connect the

111

material supplies with the COVID-19 crisis. Since the outbreak is so sudden and the

112

transmission is so rapid, people in affected areas require medical material and other necessities,

113

especially after the Chinese government shut the major entrance to Hubei to control the

114

outbreak. The mass media can communicate with other parts of China to call on donations and

115

support.

116

117

There is an emphasis on Wuhan’s story, where news stories focus on an individual’s life instead

118

of the whole city level. We also observed that Theme 6 (Mental health) accounts for 4·4% of all

119

news articles, revealing that there is a need for mental health intervention of patients, medical

120

staff, and the public in the news reports. These two themes indicate the mass media adopts a

121

people-oriented principle when reporting the COVID-19 crisis.

122

123

Limitations

124

In our study, we included a large number of Chinese news articles about COVID-19 from the

125

Huike mass media database which only covers text news articles. However, the mass media

126

recently used new media platforms such as Tik Tok and WeChat (the largest Chinese instant

127

messaging application) to deliver health information through images, snapshots, and short

128

videos. Therefore, we might omit the news content and the impact of mass media on these

129

media platforms. Besides, our study mainly researches the mass media’s role; it would be

130

valuable if we could measure the public’s reaction to our study.

131

132

Conclusion

133

Collecting and analyzing reports on the novel coronavirus shed light upon how the Chinese

134

media have delivered health information during the COVID-19 crisis. Our study provides

135

evidence that the Chinese mass media news lags behind when reporting the major

136

developments of the viral spread. Prevention and control procedures, medical treatment, and

137

research are major themes of the press, but mainly focusing on the whole society level, while

138

instructions on personal and individual prevention, clinic and medicine choices, and detection

139

need to be further enhanced. Global and local influences had been reported as the COVID-19

140

crisis started to impose pressure on public health globally and urge cooperation among all

141

humankind. Further research should be considered to explore the impacts of mass media on the

142

readers through sentiment analysis of news data and the influences of misinformation about

143

COVID-19 delivered through the mass media.
