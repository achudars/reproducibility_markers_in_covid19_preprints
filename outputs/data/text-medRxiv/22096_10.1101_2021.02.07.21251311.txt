ABSTRACT
The use of COVID-19 vaccines will play a major role in helping to end the
pandemic that has killed millions worldwide. COVID-19 vaccine candidates have
resulted in robust humoral responses and protective efficacy in human trials, but
efficacy trials excluded individuals with prior diagnosis of COVID-19. As a result, little is
known about how immune responses induced by mRNA vaccine candidates differ in
individuals who recovered from COVID-19. Here, we evaluated longitudinal immune
responses to two-dose BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination in 13 adults who recovered from
COVID-19, compared to 19 adults who did not have prior COVID-19 diagnosis.
Consistent with prior studies of mRNA vaccines, we observed robust cytotoxic CD8 T
cell responses in both cohorts. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2-naive individuals had
progressive increases in humoral and antigen-specific antibody-secreting cell (ASC)
responses following each dose of vaccine, whereas SARS-CoV-2-experienced
individuals demonstrated strong humoral and antigen-specific ASC responses to the
first dose but muted responses to the second dose of the vaccine for the time points
studied. Together, these data highlight the relevance of immunological history for
understanding vaccine immune responses and may have significant implications for
personalizing mRNA vaccination regimens used to prevent COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION
SARS-CoV-2 has caused hundreds of millions of infections and millions of
deaths worldwide (1). Although repeated infection has been described in isolated cases
(2, 3), resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with reduced susceptibility to
re-infection in animal models (4) and in humans (5). However, it remains unknown how
long this protection lasts. A number of promising vaccine candidates have emerged
including mRNA vaccines, vector-based vaccines, and protein-adjuvant vaccines (6).
Maintenance of protective immune responses via vaccines will be important for
preventing de novo, or recurrent, infection with SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Identification of protective correlates of immunity will be critical to predicting
susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Humoral responses have been identified as a
correlate of immunity for a variety of pathogens (7). In the setting of SARS-CoV-2
infection in non-human primates, humoral responses conferred protection, and T cell
responses were partially protective in the setting of waning antibody titers (8). Indeed,
studies with mRNA vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 have induced robust
humoral responses against SARS-CoV-2 in animal models (9–11) and in humans (12–
17) and were efficacious in large-scale clinical trials (18, 19). In addition to humoral
responses, mRNA vaccines induced type 1 responses in CD4 T cells following mRNA
vaccination, as evidenced by ELISpot and intracellular cytokine staining for interferon
gamma and IL-2 (13, 14). However, the full spectrum of immune responses to the
vaccines have not been evaluated.
Memory is the hallmark of adaptive immune responses and typically results in
faster resolution of infection upon re-exposure. Moreover, mice with a particular
immunological history responded differently to pathogens compared to mice who had
not had prior infections (20, 21). Immunological history can radically shape subsequent
immune responses in other ways. For example, influenza susceptibility has been linked
to strain-specific exposure from decades earlier (22, 23). Moreover, non-neutralizing
antibody responses to acute dengue infection are a risk factor for antibody-dependent
disease enhancement for serodiscordant strains (24, 25). These, and other examples
from the literature (26), further highlight the importance for understanding immunological
history in the context of COVID-19 vaccines. Moreover, large-scale clinical trials
excluded individuals with a prior diagnosis of COVID-19, thereby leaving an unexplored
gap in our understanding of vaccine responses in SARS-CoV-2-experienced individuals.
Indeed, given the scope of the pandemic, addressing this gap in knowledge will be
relevant to hundreds of millions of recovered individuals worldwide.
Here, our goal was to evaluate the effects of prior history of COVID-19 on the
immune response to mRNA vaccination. Following COVID-19, humoral and cellular
immune responses persist (27–29), but little is known about the effects of prior COVID19 on subsequent exposure to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. In an observational study, we
longitudinally evaluated and compared adults who were SARS-CoV-2-naive to those
who were SARS-CoV-2-experienced following mRNA vaccination. Using unbiased highdimensional flow cytometry analyses, we found robust cytotoxic CD8 T cell responses
to vaccination but relatively muted CD4 responses. However, further analysis revealed
subtle differences between cohorts. We found evidence for altered antigen-specific ASC
induction in circulation and altered humoral responses to vaccination depending on prior
history of COVID-19. Better understanding of the effects of prior COVID-19 on the

susceptibility and enable personalized vaccine strategies for maintenance of immunity.

RESULTS
Robust T cell responses to mRNA vaccination
Prior immune history can affect subsequent responses to antigen (20). To test
the effects of immunological history in the setting of COVID-19, we recruited 13
individuals who had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (hereafter labeled SARS-CoV-2experienced) and 19 individuals who did not have documented COVID-19 (hereafter
labeled SARS-CoV-2-naive). Participants’ ages ranged from 24 to 65, with a median
age of 39 for naive adults and 43.5 for SARS-CoV-2-experienced individuals (table S1).
All SARS-CoV-2-experienced adults had mild COVID-19 or asymptomatic infection.
Two individuals were infected with SARS-CoV-2 within 30 days prior to vaccination,
whereas the remaining 11 were at least six months beyond diagnosis of COVID-19. For
these two cohorts, all participants received two doses of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine
in accordance with FDA’s Emergency Use Authorization, and peripheral immune
responses assessed before and after each dose of vaccine (Fig. 1A). Samples were
categorized as Baseline, Post 1st dose (6–9 days after vaccination), Pre 2nd dose
(immediately prior to second vaccination and ~21 days since initial vaccination), Post
2nd dose (6–9 days after second vaccination), and One month post 2nd dose (~4
weeks after second vaccination) (fig. S1A).
To determine the phenotype of circulating T cells responding to vaccination, we
performed high-dimensional spectral flow cytometry longitudinally for all participants (fig.
S1B, table S2). We initially reasoned that T cell responses would be evident following
the second dose, thus we performed cluster analysis (30) and tSNE representation of all
non-naive CD8 T cells (Fig. 1B). Of the 29 clusters identified, only Cluster 12 increased
in abundance at the Post 2nd dose time point compared to Pre 2nd dose (Fig. 1C, and
fig. S1, C and D). Cells in Cluster 12 expressed high levels of multiple proteins
associated with activation, including Ki67, CD38, and ICOS (Fig. 1D). We next
assessed these cells longitudinally using manual gating for Ki67 and CD38. Indeed, we
found that vaccination was associated with robust induction of Ki67+CD38+ CD8 T cells
one week after each vaccination (Fig. 1, E and F), which was consistent with prior
reports of robust induction of cytotoxic T cells after vaccination (31). Compared to
baseline Ki67+CD38+ CD8 T cell frequencies, the first vaccination induced a median
1.7-fold increase for SARS-CoV-2-naive and 1.7-fold increase for SARS-CoV-2experienced individuals. However, compared with the Pre 2nd dose time point, the
second vaccination induced a 2.6-fold and 3.3-fold increase in SARS-CoV-2-naive and experienced subjects, respectively, at one week post second dose. We also considered
whether there might be differential timing of CD8 T cell responses between the two
cohorts, but analysis of time as a continuous variable did not identify a consistent
pattern (fig. S1, E and F). Moreover, Ki67+CD38+ CD8 T cells expressed high levels of
Granzyme B, suggesting strong cytotoxic potential, and responded with memory
kinetics to repeat exposure to SARS-CoV-2 antigens (fig. S1, G and H). Together, these
data show that mRNA vaccination was associated with cytotoxic CD8 T cell responses
in both cohorts.
We next asked if similar changes were evident in circulating CD4 T cells. Here,
cluster analysis and tSNE representation of non-naive CD4 T cells identified 22 clusters,
two of which increased in abundance after the second dose of vaccine (Fig. 1G, and fig.

S1I). Of these responding clusters, Cluster 13 was associated with high expression of
Ki67, CD38, and ICOS (fig. S1, J and K). Indeed, longitudinal analysis revealed
induction of Ki67+CD38+ CD4 T cells following immunization in the SARS-CoV-2-naive
adults, with a 1.9-fold increase after first vaccination compared to baseline and a 1.4fold increase at Post 2nd dose compared to Pre 2nd dose time points. In contrast, we
observed muted CD4 responses in SARS-CoV-2-experienced adults (Fig. 1, H and I).
We considered whether there might be differential timing of CD4 T cell responses
between the two cohorts but again did not identify a consistent pattern (fig. S1, L and
M).
We next asked if these activated CD4 and CD8 T cell responses were correlated.
Indeed, we found strong positive correlation between activated CD4 and CD8
responses after the first dose of vaccine and a weak correlation after the second dose
of vaccine in SARS-CoV-2-naive adults (Fig. 1, J and K). In contrast, activated CD4
and CD8 responses in SARS-CoV-2-experienced adults had a modest correlation after
the first dose and no correlation after the second dose of vaccine. We also considered
other demographic variables in the analysis. Aging has been associated with reduced
vaccine immunogenicity and effectiveness. Indeed, COVID-19 mortality increases with
age (32), and it remains unclear how well COVID-19 vaccine candidates perform in
older adults (33). Here, we observed no correlation with age in activated CD8 T cell
responses but found negative correlations in activated CD4 responses with participant
age following primary and second vaccinations (Fig. 1L, and fig. S1N). These results
indicated the potential for reduced CD4 T cell responses to vaccination with aging and
underscored the need for additional studies to fully understand effects of aging on
mRNA vaccine immune responses.
Differential induction of cTfh by infection history
Most vaccines are thought to confer protection via induction of a class-switched,
affinity-matured antibody response (7). Moreover, maturation of B cell responses within
germinal centers requires help from CD4+ T follicular cells (Tfh) (34, 35). However,
lymphoid tissue is challenging to routinely study in humans. We and others, focused on
a circulating Tfh-like subset with similar phenotypic, transcriptional, epigenetic, and
functional characteristics to lymphoid Tfh (36–40). Indeed, we previously found that
vaccination induced antigen-specific ICOS+CD38+ circulating Tfh (cTfh) which
correlated with plasmablast responses and demonstrated memory kinetics (41).
Furthermore, other studies identified cTfh responses in non-human primates following
mRNA vaccination for influenza (42). However, cTfh have not been evaluated in
humans following mRNA vaccination for protection against COVID-19.
Given the subtle differences in T cell responses following mRNA vaccination
between cohorts (Fig. 1), we next asked if cTfh responses to vaccination were similarly
induced with each vaccination. Antigen-specific ICOS+CD38+ cTfh were found in
circulation 1–2 weeks after yellow fever vaccination (43), which was later than observed
with influenza vaccine (41), thus we scrutinized all time points for evidence of cTfh
responses. Indeed, ICOS+CD38+ cTfh cells increased following vaccination in SARSCoV-2-naive adults and peaked one week after the second vaccine dose (Fig. 2, A and
B). In contrast, SARS-CoV-2-experienced adults did not show similar induction of cTfh
cells following either dose of the vaccine. In prior studies, antigen-specific ICOS+CD38+

cTfh were shown to express CXCR3 following influenza vaccination (39, 41). Here, we
identified an 2.3-fold induction of CXCR3+ cells among ICOS+CD38+ cTfh cells in
SARS-CoV-2-experienced adults after the first vaccine dose, in contrast to 1.7-fold
increase among SARS-CoV-2-naive adults after the first dose (Fig. 2, C and D). There
was minimal change in CXCR3 expression in ICOS+CD38+ cTfh one week after the
second dose of vaccine in either cohort. Together, these data demonstrate that prior
history of SARS-CoV-2 exposure affects cTfh response to mRNA vaccination.
In high-dimensional analyses of non-naive CD4 (fig. S1J), the ICOS+CD38+ cTfh
cells comprised just 8% of the cluster 13 one week after each vaccination and were
more commonly part of other clusters (i.e. ~44% were identified as cluster 16). Thus, we
asked if the cTfh response correlated with the Ki67+CD38+ CD4 response. Indeed,
ICOS+CD38+ cTfh from SARS-CoV-2-naive adults correlated positively with
Ki67+CD38+ CD4 T cells for the fold-change at Post 1st dose compared to baseline
(Fig. 2E) and at Post 2nd dose compared to Pre 2nd dose (Fig. 2F). In contrast, SARSCoV-2-experienced adults had a positive correlation after the first dose and did not have
a correlation after the second dose. We also found negative correlations with age that
was similar between cohorts, similar to what was observed for activated CD4 responses
(Fig. 1).
We also evaluated other well-established cellular correlates of the humoral
response such as plasmablasts (42), CD21lo B cells (44), and CD71+ B cells (45) but
found little or no induction of these subsets in either cohort longitudinally (fig. S2, C to I).
Plasma CXCL13, which has been reported as a plasma biomarker of early germinal
center activity (46), also did not change following vaccination in either cohort (fig. S2J)
but was elevated in an independent cohort of adults with acute COVID-19 (fig. S2K).
Altogether, we found weak induction of ICOS+CD38+ cTfh with subtle
differences between cohorts. Indeed, while the ICOS+CD38+ cTfh frequency continued
to increase in the SARS-CoV-2-naive adults there was no evidence of induction of cTfh
in SARS-CoV-2-experienced adults over the course of the vaccination series. Given that
Tfh provide help to B cells, these data provoked the question as to whether B cell
responses also differed by prior history of COVID-19.
Induction of SARS-CoV-2-specific ASC in circulation after vaccination
We observed subtle differences in induction of ICOS+CD38+ cTfh following
vaccination based on prior history of COVID-19 (Fig. 2). Thus we next asked if antigenspecific B cell responses induced by vaccination are influenced by prior exposure to the
virus. To test this, we performed ELISpot analyses of antibody-secreting cells for
reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 proteins one week after each vaccine dose.
Given the persistence of SARS-CoV-2-reactive B cells in individuals who
recovered from COVID-19 (28), we expected to find a stronger antigen-specific ASC
response in SARS-CoV-2-experienced adults than SARS-CoV-2-naive adults after the
first dose of vaccine. Indeed, after the first dose of vaccine, SARS-CoV-2-naive adults
had few SARS-CoV-2-specific ASCs detected, whereas SARS-CoV-2-experienced
adults had stronger IgG-secreting ASC responses to RBD, S1, and S2 proteins (Fig. 3,
A to C, fig. S3, A and B). Moreover, IgA-secreting ASC were identified predominantly in
SARS-CoV-2-experienced adults after the first vaccine dose, albeit at a lower frequency
than IgG-secreting ASC (Fig. 3D). Few IgM-specific ASC were identified (fig. S3C).

Although global plasmablast frequencies did not change with vaccination (fig. S2, C to
E), we did indeed find evidence of antigen-specific ASC responses following the first
vaccine dose.
We next asked if the second vaccination also induced strong antigen-specific
ASC responses in the two cohorts. Indeed, the second dose of vaccine robustly induced
S1- and RBD-reactive ASC in SARS-CoV-2-naive adults (Fig. 3, E to I). In contrast,
however, the second dose of vaccine induced similar, or weaker, ASC responses in
SARS-COV-2-experienced adults approximately one week after vaccination for all three
SARS-CoV-2 antigens tested (fig. S3D). Antigen-specific ASC induction was correlated
by isotype and antigen in SARS-CoV-2-experienced adults one week after the first
vaccination and SARS-CoV-2-naive one week after the second vaccination (Fig. 3, J
and K, fig. S3, E to H). However, correlations by isotype and antigen were not observed
in the SARS-CoV-2-experienced adults following the second vaccination.
Together, these data demonstrated increased induction of antigen-specific ASC
responses with repeated vaccination in SARS-CoV-2-naive adults, whereas fewer
antigen-specific ASC were observed in circulation with repeated vaccination in SARSCoV-2-experienced adults.
Humoral responses differ by history of COVID-19
ASC induction differed by prior history of COVID-19 (Fig. 3), thus we next asked
whether humoral responses were affected by prior history of COVID-19. To test this, we
first assessed antibody responses to the S1 subunit of the Spike protein (47). As
previously demonstrated (28), anti-S1 IgG antibodies were detectable in individuals who
had recovered from COVID-19 and were not detectable in those who were SARS-CoV2-naive at baseline (median titers 6232 and 25, respectively; P=7.9x10-6; Wilcoxon test)
(Fig. 4A, and fig. S4A). Following first dose immunization, SARS-CoV-2-experienced
adults had a median fold-change of 54 whereas SARS-CoV-2-naive adults had a
median fold-change of 3.2 (P=0.007; Wilcoxon test). However, after second dose
immunization, SARS-CoV-2-experienced adults had a median fold-change of 1.4
whereas the SARS-CoV-2-naive adults had a fold-change of 10 (P=0.001; Wilcoxon
test). Indeed, the two cohorts had similar anti-S1 IgG titers one week after the second
vaccination (P=0.06; Wilcoxon test; fig. S4B) as well as one month after the second
vaccination (P=0.19; Wilcoxon test). A similar pattern was observed for anti-S1 IgA titers
(Fig. 4B), and, as expected, vaccination did not affect levels of anti-nucleocapsid
antibodies (fig. S4C). The change in titer in SARS-CoV-2-experienced adults was
inversely correlated with their titer at baseline (fig. S4D). Thus, these data demonstrate
rapid and robust humoral responses after initial vaccination in both cohorts but minimal
further increase in SARS-CoV-2-experienced adults after the second vaccine dose.
In a subset of participants, we asked if neutralizing antibodies were induced
following immunization. We observed low titers of neutralizing antibodies at baseline in
SARS-CoV-2-experienced adults, whereas sera from SARS-CoV-2-naive adults did not
have detectable neutralizing antibodies (Fig. 4, C and D, and fig. S4E). Following the
first immunization, SARS-CoV-2-experienced adults had a rapid increase in neutralizing
antibody titers to median 6429, whereas SARS-CoV-2-naive adults achieved a titer of
10 (P=0.015; Wilcoxon test). As observed with total binding anti-S1 antibodies,
subsequent neutralizing antibody titers were largely unchanged after second

vaccination, at least over the observed period, in SARS-CoV-2-experienced adults,
whereas the neutralizing titers in SARS-CoV-2-naive adults continued to increase.
Neutralizing titers were similar one week after the second vaccination (fig. S4F).
Antibody avidity has been used to assess affinity maturation following vaccination
(48–50). To assess avidity, urea wash ELISA was performed for anti-S1 IgG antibodies
on serum samples longitudinally. In SARS-CoV-2-naive adults, avidity continued to
increase steadily over the measured time points (Fig. 4E), including at one month post
2nd dose when antibody titers had plateaued. All SARS-CoV-2-experienced adults
assayed had relatively high-avidity antibodies at baseline, but, in contrast to SARSCoV-2-naive adults, avidity decreased in 4 of 5 participants over time and with second
vaccination, which was may have been due to the induction of new, low avidity humoral
responses that had not undergone germinal center maturation.
All together, these data demonstrated pronounced differences in humoral
responses based on prior history of COVID-19.

DISCUSSION
Prior studies have demonstrated the importance of humoral and cellular
responses for susceptibility to COVID-19 (8). Better understanding of factors that affect
immune responses will be critical to the design of next generation SARS-CoV-2
vaccines and their optimal use. Here, we observed subtle differences in cellular
responses and more pronounced differences in humoral responses between individuals
naive to SARS-CoV-2 and those who had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Both
cohorts had similar robust CD8 T cell responses to vaccination, which was typified by
co-expression of Ki67 and CD38, whereas CD4 T cell responses were generally more
muted. In the immune response to mRNA vaccination, reactive T cell responses were
evident following vaccination, particularly in CD8 T cells. Among CD4 responses,
ICOS+CD38+ cTfh expressing CXCR3 increased following vaccination in both cohorts,
but whereas vaccination induced a sharp rise in this subset in SARS-CoV-2experienced individuals, a more gradual increase in this subset was observed in SARSCoV-2-naive individuals. Furthermore, antigen-specific B cell responses differed by
cohort as well. SARS-CoV-2-experienced adults had more antigen-specific ASC in
circulation one week after the first vaccination compared to SARS-CoV-2-naive adults,
but the frequency of antigen-specific ASC after second vaccination did not increase in
previously infected individuals, unlike the SARS-CoV-2-naive adults. Additionally, prior
history of COVID-19 was associated with 100- to 1000-fold increase in anti-Spike IgG
antibody titers following the first vaccination, with limited increase upon the second
vaccination, whereas antibody titers increased steadily over time in SARS-CoV-2-naive
adults.
Prior studies have evaluated adaptive immune responses to mRNA vaccination
(31). Indeed, potent induction of cytotoxic T cell responses was observed in animal
models (31). Consistent with these studies, here we also observed robust induction of
cytotoxic CD8 T cell responses following vaccination. Although we did not observe
Ki67+CD38+ CD4 T cell responses in either cohort, other reports have identified
antigen-specific CD4 T cell responses following mRNA vaccination (14), thus indicating
establishment of CD4 T cell responses following vaccination. Furthermore, we
evaluated cTfh responses which correlated with B cell and humoral responses in prior
studies (37–39). We found induction of CXCR3+ ICOS+CD38+ cTfh with vaccination in
both cohorts, suggesting establishment of memory Tfh populations following
vaccination. Indeed, two prior studies evaluated mRNA vaccination for influenza in
humans and non-human primates and found robust induction of ICOS+CXCR3+PD-1+
cTfh responses and neutralizing antibodies (42, 51), which was similar to our
observations in the current study. Thus, our data are overall consistent with prior studies
of the establishment of robust adaptive immune responses following mRNA vaccination,
particularly in SARS-CoV-2-naive adults.
However, differences in immune responses were observed when comparing
adults who were naive to SARS-CoV-2 to those who had recovered from SARS-CoV-2
infection. Notably, humoral responses were robust after the first vaccination but more
muted after the second vaccination in SARS-CoV-2-experienced adults, and this
difference was evident in anti-Spike IgG, IgA, and neutralizing antibodies. Several
possibilities may explain these differences. For example, the early plateau in humoral
responses could indicate altered B cell differentiation away from antigen-specific plasma

cells, which would be consistent with the relatively poor ASC responses in SARS-CoV2-experienced adults after the second dose. In addition, the reduction in antigen-specific
ASC may have also altered trafficking of ASC following repeat vaccination, perhaps
shifting the peak ASC response earlier than was assessed here. Another possibility is
that the very high titers of anti-S1 IgG responses may restrict antigen availability for
stimulation of non-memory B cell clones following subsequent vaccine doses. Indeed,
there was a strong negative correlation between the baseline anti-S1 IgG titer and the
fold-change in anti-S1 IgG titers after first vaccination. Furthermore, differences
between cohorts could arise from differences in APC priming, as the duration of the
dysregulation of innate immune responses in the setting of COVID-19 (52) remains
unknown. Future studies will be needed to better understand adaptive immune
responses to COVID-19 mRNA vaccination, which will have direct implications for
durable, effective protection from infection.
Ideally, vaccination will result in durable protection from infection. During the
study period, both SARS-CoV-2-naive and SARS-CoV-2-experienced adults achieved
comparable total binding IgG and neutralizing antibody titers, which appeared to peak
one week after second vaccination, consistent with published reports of humoral
responses to mRNA vaccination (12, 18). Moreover, humoral responses continued to
qualitatively change in affinity despite the plateau. In SARS-CoV-2-naive adults, affinity
increased over time, which may reflect germinal center-related affinity maturation (11,
53). In contrast, SARS-CoV-2-experienced adults had reduction in affinity over time,
presumably reflecting the contribution of de novo B cell responses that had not
undergone affinity maturation, rather than loss of high-affinity antibodies. Longer followup will be needed to determine whether humoral responses continue to quantitatively or
qualitatively differ between these two cohorts.
Together, these results highlight the importance of understanding prior
immunological experience on the subsequent immune response to COVID-19 mRNA
vaccines. Future studies will be needed to determine whether such personalized

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design
Thirty-two adults (19 SARS-CoV-2-naïve and 13 SARS-CoV-2-experienced) provided
written consent for enrollment with approval from the NYU Institutional Review Board
(protocols 18-02035 and 18-02037).

Blood samples processing and storage
Venous blood was collected by standard phlebotomy. Blood collection occurred at
baseline, approximately one week after first vaccination (“Post 1st dose”), prior to the
second vaccination (“Pre 2nd dose”), one week after the second vaccination (“Post 2nd
dose”), and one month after the second vaccination (“One month post 2nd dose”), as
depicted in fig. S1A. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from
heparin vacutainers (BD Biosciences) that were stored overnight at room temperature
(RT), followed by processing using Sepmates (Stem Cell, Inc) in accordance with the
manufacturer’s recommendations. Serum was collected in SST tubes (BD Biosciences)
and frozen immediately at -80oC.
ELISA
Direct ELISA was used to quantify antibody titers in participant serum. Ninety-six well
plates were coated with 1 µg/ml S1 protein (100 µl/well) or 0.1 µg/ml N protein diluted in
PBS and were then incubated overnight at 4°C (Sino Biological Inc., 40591-V08H and
40588-V08B). Plates were washed four times with 250 µl of PBS containing 0.05%
Tween 20 (PBS-T) and blocked with 200 µl PBS-T containing 4% non-fat milk and 5%
whey, as blocking buffer at RT for 1 hour. Sera were heated at 56°C for 1 hour prior to
use. Samples were diluted to a starting concentration of 1:50 (S1), or 1:100 (N) were
first added to the plates and then serially diluted 1:3 in blocking solution. The final
volume in all wells after dilution was 100 µl. After a 2-hour incubation period at RT,
plates were washed four times with PBS-T. Horseradish-peroxidase conjugated goatanti human IgG, IgM, and IgA (Southern BioTech, 2040-05, 2020-05, 2050-05) were
diluted in blocking buffer (1:2000, 1:1000, 1:1000, respectively) and 100 µl was added
to each well. Plates were incubated for 1 hour at RT and washed four times with PBS-T.
After developing for 5 min with TMB Peroxidase Substrate 3,3 ,5,5 Tetramethylbenzidine (Thermo Scientific), the reaction was stopped with 1M sulfuric
acid or 1N hydrochloric acid. The optical density was determined by measuring the
absorbance at 450 nm on a Synergy 4 (BioTek) plate reader.

In order to summarize data collected on individuals, the area under the response curve
was calculated for each sample and end point titers were normalized using replicates of
pooled positive control sera on each plate to reduce variability between plates.

Avidity assay
Ninety-six well plates were coated with 0.1 µg/ml S1 protein (100 µl/well) diluted in PBS
overnight at 4°C (Sino Biological). Plates were washed four times with 250 µl of PBS

containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T) and blocked with 200 µl PBS-T containing 4%
non-fat milk and 5% whey, as blocking buffer at RT for 1 hour. Sera were heated at
56°C for 1 hour prior to use. Samples were diluted to a starting concentration of 1:50
and added to the plates in quadruplicate and then serially diluted 1:3 in blocking
solution. The final volume in all wells after dilution was 100 µl. After a 2-hour incubation
period at RT, plates were washed four times with PBS-T. PBS was then added to two
dilution replicate sets and 6 M Urea to the other two dilution replicate sets. Plates were
incubated for 10 min at RT before washing four times with PBST. Antibodies were
detected and plates were developed and read as described in above ELISA assays.
Avidity was calculated by dividing the dilutions that gave an Optical Density value of 0.5
(Urea treatment/no Urea). Scores with theoretical values between 0 and 100% were
generated.

Antibody-secreting cell ELISpot Assays
A direct enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay was used to determine the number
of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein subunit S1-, S2-, and receptor-binding domains (RBD)specific IgG, IgA, and IgM ASCs in fresh PBMCs. Ninety-six well ELISpot filter plates
(Millipore, MSHAN4B50) were coated overnight with 2 µg/mL recombinant S1, S2, or
RBD (Sino Biological Inc., 40591-V08H, 40590-V08B, and 40592-V08H), or 10 µg/mL of
goat anti-human IgG/A/M capture antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory Inc.,
109-005-064). Plates were washed 4 times with 200 µl PBS-T and blocked for 2 hours
at 37°C with 200 µl RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 units/ml of
penicillin G, and 100 g/ml of streptomycin (Gibco), referred to as complete medium.
Fifty µl of cells in complete medium at 10x106 cells/ml were added to the top row of
wells containing 150 µl complete medium and 3-fold serial diluted 3 times. Plates were
incubated overnight at 37°C with 5% CO2. Plates were washed 1 time with 200 µl PBS
followed by 4 times with 200 µl PBS-T. Biotinylated anti-human IgG, IgM, or IgA
antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory Inc., 709-065-098, 109-065-129, 109065-011) were diluted 1:1000 in PBS-T with 2% FCS (Ab diluent) and 100 µl was added
to wells for 2 hours at RT or overnight at 4oC. Plates were washed 4 times with 200 µl
PBS-T and incubated with 100 µl of Avidin-D-HRP conjugate (Vector Laboratories, A2004) diluted 1:1000 in Ab diluent for 1 hour at RT. Plates were washed 4 times with
200 µl PBS-T and 100ml of AEC substrate (3 amino-9 ethyl-carbazole; Sigma Aldrich,
A-5754) was added. Plates were incubated at RT for 5 minutes and rinsed with water to
stop the reaction. Developed plates were scanned and analyzed using an ImmunoSpot
automated ELISpot counter (Cellular Technology Limited).

SARS-CoV-2 microneutralization assay
Viral neutralization activity of serum was measured in an immunofluorescence-based
microneutralization assay by detecting the neutralization of infectious virus in cultured
Vero E6 cells (African Green Monkey Kidney; ATCC #CRL-1586). These cells are
known to be highly susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2. Cells were maintained
according to standard ATCC protocols. Briefly, Vero E6 cells were grown in Minimal

Essential Medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum
(FBS), 2mM L-glutamine, and 1% of MEM Nonessential Amino Acid (NEAA) Solution
(Fisher #MT25025CI). Cell cultures were grown in 75 or 150 cm2 flasks at 37°C with
5% CO2 and passaged 2-3 times per week using trypsin-EDTA. Cell cultures used for
virus testing were prepared as subconfluent monolayers. All incubations containing
cells were performed at 37°C with 5% CO2. All SARS-CoV-2 infection assays were
performed in the CDC/USDA-approved BSL-3 facility in compliance with NYU
Grossman School of Medicine guidelines for biosafety level 3. SARS-CoV-2 isolate
USA-WA1/2020, deposited by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was
obtained through BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH (NR-52281, GenBank accession no.
MT233526). Serial dilutions of heat-inactivated serum (56°C for 1 hour) were incubated
with USA-WA1/2020 stock (at fixed 1x106 PFU/ml) for 1 hour 37°C. One hundred
microliters of the serum-virus mix was then added to the cells and incubated at 37°C
with 5% CO2. Twenty-four hours post-infection, cells were fixed with 10% formalin
solution (4% active formaldehyde) for 1 hour, stained with an -SARS-CoV-2
nucleocapsid antibody (ProSci #10-605), and a goat -mouse IgG AF647 secondary
antibody along with DAPI and visualized by microscopy with the CellInsight CX7 HighContent Screening (HCS) Platform (ThermoFisher) and high-content software (HCS)
(54).

CXCL13 detection
CXCL13 was detected using the Ella instrument (ProteinSimple) and a CXCL13 Simple
Plex Cartridge (ProteinSimple, SPCKB-PS-000375) on serum diluted 1:1 in buffer
according to the manufacturer’s instruction.
Cellular phenotyping
Peripheral blood was collected in sodium heparin collection tubes and maintained at
room temperature overnight. PBMC were isolated using the Sepmate system
(STEMCELL Technologies) in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions. Then, 2 to 5
million freshly isolated PBMC were resuspended in HBSS supplemented with 1% fetal
calf serum (Fisher) and 0.02% sodium azide (Sigma). Cells underwent Fc-blockade with
Human TruStain FcX (Biolegend) and NovaBlock (Phitonex) for 10 minutes at room
temperature, followed by surface staining antibody cocktail at room temperature for 20
minutes in the dark. Cells were permeabilized with the eBioscience Intracellular Fixation
and Permeabilization kit (Fisher) for 20 minutes at room temperature in the dark,
followed by intracellular staining with an antibody cocktail for 1 hour at room
temperature in the dark. All samples were then resuspended in 1% paraformaldehyde
and acquired within three days of staining on a 5-laser Aurora cytometer (Cytek
Biosciences). Antibodies, clones, and catalog numbers are available in Table S2. Initial
data quality control was performed using FlowJo. Non-naive CD8 and CD4 T cells were
analyzed in the OMIQ.ai platform (www.omiq.ai) using Phenograph clustering (30) with
k=20 and a Euclidean distance metric, followed by tSNE projection. Heatmaps and
differential cluster abundance were assessed by edgeR (55) via OMIQ.ai.

Bioinformatics and statistical analyses
Primary data analysis and statistical analysis were performed using the R environment
(version 4.0.2) and all bioinformatics scripts are available at
https://github.com/teamTfh/COVIDvaccines. Statistical tests were performed using the
“rstatix” library (version 0.6.0). Use of parametric or nonparametric tests was guided by
Shapiro-Wilk normality testing. A log(x+1) transformation was performed prior to
significance testing for 2-sample t-tests where sample variances were unequal as
identified by Levene’s test. Correlation analyses were performed as nonparametric tests
using Kendall’s tau statistic. All tests were two-tailed tests with =0.05. Study schematic
was made with BioRender.

(upper) or SARS-CoV-2-experienced (lower) participants. Heatmap shows expression
of Ki67. Circled area indicates region corresponding to Cluster 12. (D) Non-naive CD8
underwent Phenograph clustering. Protein expression for each cluster for SARS-CoV-2experienced adults shown for samples taken one week after the second vaccination. (E
and F) Ki67+CD38+ expression in CD8 T cells by cohort over time measured in days,
relative to the individual’s first (E) or second (L) vaccination. (G) Example for
Ki67+CD38+ CD8 T cell expression of granzyme B in a SARS-CoV-2-experienced
individual. (H) Summary data for Ki67+CD38+ CD8 T cell expression of granzyme B. Pvalues from one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post test. (I) Non-naive CD4 T cells from all
samples were merged for tSNE projection. Colors indicate Phenograph clustering. (J
and K) Protein expression for Phenograph clusters for non-naive CD4 T cells shown for
samples at one week following second vaccination in SARS-CoV-2-naive (J) or SARSCoV-2-experienced (K) participants. (L and M) CD4 T cells shown for expression of
Ki67 and CD38 after vaccination over time measured in days, relative to the individual’s
first (L) or second (M) vaccinations. (N) Correlation between Ki67+CD38+ CD4 T cells
and age one after either first vaccination (left) or second vaccination (right).
