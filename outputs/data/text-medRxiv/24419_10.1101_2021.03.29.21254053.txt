Abstract

16

Understanding disease burden and transmission dynamics in resource-limited, developing

17

countries like Nepal is often challenging due to a lack of adequate surveillance systems. These

18

issues are exacerbated by limited access to diagnostic and research facilities throughout the

19

country. Nepal has one of the highest COVID-19 case rates (915 cases per 100,000 people) in

20

South Asia, with densely-populated Kathmandu experiencing the highest number of cases. Swiftly

21

identifying case clusters and introducing effective intervention programs is crucial to mounting an

22

effective containment strategy. The rapid identification of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants can

23

also provide important information on viral evolution and epidemiology. Genomic-based

24

environmental surveillance can help in the early detection of outbreaks before clinical cases are

25

recognized, and identify viral micro-diversity that can be used for designing real-time risk-based

26

interventions. This research aimed to develop a genomic-based environmental surveillance system

27

by detecting and characterizing SARS-CoV-2 in sewage samples of Kathmandu using portable

28

next-generation DNA sequencing devices. Out of 20 selected sites in the Kathmandu Valley,

29

sewage samples from 16 (80%) sites had detectable SARS-CoV-2. A heat-map was created to

30

visualize transmission activity in the community based on viral load intensity and corresponding

31

geospatial data. Further, 41 mutations were observed in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Some detected

32

mutations (n=9, 2%) were novel and yet to be reported in the global database, with one indicating

33

a frameshift deletion in the spike gene. We also observed more transition than transversion on

34

detected mutations, indicating rapid viral evolution in the host. Our study has demonstrated the

35

feasibility of rapidly obtaining vital information on community transmission and disease dynamics

36

of SARS-CoV-2 using genomic-based environmental surveillance.

Introduction

39

In the past twenty years, several diseases caused by coronavirus have posed significant global

40

health challenges- including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS, 2002), Middle East

41

Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, 2012), as well as the current pandemic of COVID-19 [1,2].

42

COVID-19 is caused by a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus (SARS-CoV-2) which

43

belongs to the Coronaviridae family [2]. The outbreak that was first detected in Wuhan (China)

44

was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020, as it

45

rapidly spread in over 114 countries [3]. As of January 14 (2021), over 108 million cases have

46

been reported worldwide and have claimed over 2.3 million deaths [4]. In Nepal, there are 272,840

47

confirmed COVID-19 cases and 2055 deaths [5]. Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are often

48

common in patients infected with SAR

49

S-CoV-2, with one hospital in the US reporting 70% of GI patients testing positive for coronavirus

50

[6–9]. Although the primary source of transmission is through respiratory aerosol, studies have

51

confirmed fecal shedding [10,11] and potential fecal-oral transmission of coronavirus [12,13].

52

Since SARS-CoV-2 is shed through feces and have also been detected in wastewater [14,15],

53

detecting the virus in sewage and wastewater can serve as an early detection method for identifying

54

communities with circulating virus in densely populated cities.

55

Environmental surveillance (ES) offers a complementary and more feasible approach to clinical

56

disease surveillance. This approach provides unbiased information on a population level and

57

detects viral shedding by symptomatic and asymptomatic patients [1,16], thus providing a snapshot

58

of the outbreak over an entire sewage catchment area and an early indication of clinical cases in

59

the area [17]. Because not all symptomatic patients get tested due to reluctance or lack of access

60

to tests, clinical samples are not a sensitive indicator of the occurrence of cases in a given area

61

[18,19]. As experienced by many countries, clinical and community- based COVID-19

62

surveillance is expensive, technically challenging, and time-consuming, and therefore hard to

63

implement in the manner needed to rapidly inform public health measures to contain the outbreak

64

[10,20,21]. A longitudinal study conducted in Boston (USA) between March-April in 2020 showed

65

a high correlation between environmental samples testing positive for the virus 4-10 days before

66

symptoms presented in people in the sampled areas [16]. Wastewater sampling was as sensitive as

67

stool sampling for viral detection during vaccine-derived poliovirus outbreaks in Cuba [22]. The

68

versatility of environmental samples combined with the implementation of cheaper, user-friendly,

69

and short turnaround sequencing tools such as MinION (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, UK) [23]

70

will be invaluable in rapidly identifying viral strains and detecting clusters of infection going

71

forward.

72

Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of viral pathogens is frequently used in disease surveillance

73

and monitoring, and the importance of genomic surveillance has been widely recognized as an

74

important method of understanding viral evolution [24]. Portable and reliable sequencing tools

75

such as MinION can play a crucial role in conducting genomic surveillance in a developing country

76

like Nepal where access to high throughput DNA sequencing machines is limited. The pocket-

77

sized and field-deployable, the next-generation sequencer has enabled real-time outbreak

78

surveillance of several recent outbreaks of Zika, Ebola, and Lassa viruses [1]. Obtaining whole or

79

partial genome sequences of the virus during outbreak is critical in understanding viral evolution

80

and disease epidemiology, and can help design accurate diagnostic tests for rapidly evolving RNA

81

viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 [25].

82

This study was conducted in some selected areas of Kathmandu (Nepal) to evaluate the

83

effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 detection and characterization from environmental samples using

84

portable DNA sequencing technology (MinION). Studies in other countries have detected SARS-

85

CoV-2 in environment samples collected from wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) [2,16,26–

86

30]. However, Kathmandu has only one functional WWTP (out of five) and therefore, collecting

87

all representative citywide sampling from WWTP is not possible. Since we had mapped sewage

88

lines in some parts of the city for our ongoing surveillance of typhoid using environmental samples,

89

we used the same sampling sites to conduct SARS-CoV-2 environmental surveillance. This cross-

90

sectional study successfully detected, quantitated, and characterized the SARS-CoV-2 virus from

91

environment samples collected from the wastewater outlets and utility holes within catchment

92

areas, providing important information on the circulating strains of the virus in some communities

93

of Kathmandu.

96

Much of the field sampling strategy was derived from our ongoing environmental surveillance

97

work to determine the incidence of Salmonella typhi (the pathogen that causes Typhoid fever) in

98

the Kathmandu valley, with an estimated population of over 4 million people [31]. As part of that

99

study, we had comprehensively mapped sewage lines in the Lalitpur area of the Kathmandu valley.

100

Also, we conducted field surveys to map out population size based on catchment areas. For our

101

SARS-CoV-2 environmental surveillance, we used these sites and identified the catchment areas

102

(n=20).

The initial feasibility and optimization study (May 13-July 5, 2020) was carried out with sewage

108

samples collected around a hospital (Armed Police Force Hospital-APFH) with known COVID-

109

19 patients. Three different sites (Shankhamul (TH-1, N27.678734/E085.334175), Thapathali

110

(TH-2, N27.686754/E085.325203), and Teku (Te-3, N27.693163/E085.305504)) in the

111

Kathmandu valley were also selected based upon catchment area coverage and representative

112

population density.

113

Using an optimized protocol for detection and characterization of SARS-CoV-2, sewage samples

114

were collected for the environmental and genomic surveillance (July 26- December 1, 2020) of

115

three wards (Ward 9- Balkumari; Ward 11- Sankhamul/Jwagal, and Ward 17- Gwarko) located in

116

the Lalitpur Metropolitan city of the Kathmandu valley (Nepal).

117

Sewage samples were collected using an automated robotic pump (Biobot Analytics Inc.,

118

Cambridge, USA). For protocol optimization, a total of 500ml of a composite (20.8 ml/hr) sample

119

of 24 hours [16] was collected from the control site (APFH). But for the environmental

120

surveillance, grab (50 ml) sample was preferred based upon outcome of optimization [34]. The

121

probable reason for the consistent result in grab samples compared to the composite samples could

122

be the dilution of viral particles by sewage discharge of non-viral peak hour [34]. The grab sewage

123

samples were collected during the peak hour from 7:00AM to 9:00AM [35] based on the

124

assumption that toilet activity and sewage discharge would be high during that time period.

125

The samples were transported immediately to our Kathmandu-based laboratory using cold chain

126

for processing. Each sample was pasteurized at 60°C for 90 minutes in a water-bath [16] to

127

inactivate any virus. Pasteurized samples were then subjected to differential centrifugation for

128

virus segregation from sewage sludge by centrifuging at 3000 rpm for 30 minutes to pellet the

129

bacterial cells and debris. The pellet was discarded, and the supernatant was precipitated for virus

130

recovery using 15% PEG-6000 and 2% NaCl and gently shaken for 24 to 48 hours at 4°C [36].

131

The viral precipitates were then pelleted at 8000 rpm for 40 minutes and the pellet was re-

SARS-CoV-2. The viral load quantitation data of each site were visualized geospatially using the

amplicons [39] (Fig 3). 8µl of RNA template was mixed with 1µl of random hexamers and 1 µl of

177

dNTPs and incubated at 65°C for 5 minutes. This mixture was combined with 10µl of synthesis

178

mix consisting 10X RT (2µl), 25mM MgCl2 (4 µl), 0.1M DTT (2µl), RNase Out (1µl) and SSIII

192

Whole-genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 using MinION

193

Library preparation and sequencing using MinION

194

Tiled amplicon sequencing was used to amplify the whole genome of SARS-CoV-2 using ARTIC

195

PCR protocol [45]. This protocol has been widely adopted to sequence the entire genome of SARS-

196

CoV-2 from clinical samples. With a set of 98 PCR primers, ARTIC PCR amplifies ~400bp

197

amplicons spanning the SARS-CoV-2 genome with adjacent ~200bp overlaps. The sequencing

198

library preparation is done by pooling these 98 primers in two pools and running two PCR

199

reactions. We expect environmental samples to be highly degraded, and hence this protocol suits

200

well for our study as smaller-sized amplicon increases the success of whole-genome amplification.

201

25µl reaction volume from each PCR pool were prepared containing 12.5µl Ampligold 360 2X

202

MM, 3.6µl of primers and 2µl template cDNA. The PCR conditions were: 95°C for 30 secs

203

followed by 45 cycles of 95°C for 15 secs, 63°C for 5 mins. The ARTIC PCR amplicons were

204

further cleaned (AMPure bead, Agencourt, Beckman Coulter, USA) and quantified (Qubit 3,

205

Invitrogen Thermofisher Scientific, USA). The PCR amplicons were pooled into a single tube at

206

an equimolar concentration of 100fm. Native barcodes were assigned for each sample using Native

207

barcoding Expansion kit (EXP-NBD104) and ligation sequencing kit (SQK-LSK109) and run in

208

Flongle Flowcell using MinION (Oxford Nanopore, UK). Up to 14 samples were multiplexed in

209

three FLO-FLG001 Flongle flow cells (R9.4.1) and sequenced on MinION Mk1B device in three

210

different sequencing runs.

212

Bioinformatics workflow for consensus genome sequence generation

213

MinKNOW software (Oxford Nanopore, UK) was used to monitor sequencing run, collect the raw

214

data, and perform real-time base calling. The RAMPART v1.2.0 [46] software package developed

215

by the ARTIC network was used to visualize read mapping and genome coverage in real-time for

216

each barcode.

217

Data analysis was done using the ARTIC pipeline v1.1.3 [47] of the ARTIC network’s nanopore

218

bioinformatics protocol [48]. Base-calling was performed in real-time by Guppy v4.4.0 (Oxford

219

Nanopore, UK) integrated within MinKNOW v20.10.3 (Oxford Nanopore, UK) using high-

220

accuracy base calling mode in Thinkpad P72 Mobile Workstation (Lenovo, USA), which

221

generated fast5 and fastq reads.

222

De-multiplexing was performed by Guppy using strict parameters requiring barcodes (indexes) at

223

both ends of the reads and quality filtering (qscore threshold 7) was performed within MinKNOW

224

platform. This generated pass and fail reads for each barcode in individual directories.

225

Further filtering of read length was performed using the ARTIC pipeline with guppyplex option

226

considering parameters of certain threshold length only (range 400 bp -700 bp) that removed

227

obvious chimeric reads.

228

The processed reads were subjected to mapping, aligning, variant and consensus calling using the

229

ARTIC pipeline with the minion option. The reads were mapped against the SARS-CoV-2

230

reference (NC_045512/MN908947) using the Minimap2 v2.17 [49]. The aligned read files were

231

sorted using SAMtools v1.11 [50] to obtain coverage data and a consensus sequence.

Whole-genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 using MiSeq

234

Using identical ARTIC amplicons, the first two positive samples from the study were sequenced

235

in MiSeq (Illumina, USA) platform. The amplicons were cleaned (AMPure bead, Agencourt,

236

Beckman Coulter, USA), and a library was prepared using the Nextera XT library preparation kit

[24]. The data was processed and a consensus sequence was generated using a nextflow-based

242

tool is based on a GLUE data-centric bioinformatics environment that analyzes nucleotide

CoV-2 and generates lists of amino acid replacements and coding region indels. The mutation table

246

data obtained from CoVGlue was formatted to contain column names as follows; “sample",

247

"gene", "variant_class", "amino.acid.change”. Once the data has been formatted, it was imported

248

to R studio and were processed using plugin GenVisR to generate mutation landscape plot

249

(Waterfall plot) [53].

The tool also provides a lineage based on Pangolin classification of SARS-CoV-2 clades and its

251

LWR (likelihood weight ratio) score, which approximates confidence level of clade assignments

252

based on quality of the submitted sequence. The distribution of lineages across the sampling sites

253

were visualized in a map using QGIS v3.16 [32] against a base-map obtained from the Open Street

254

map [33].

Results

256

Optimization of protocol for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and other

257

coronaviruses in sewage samples

258

Four preliminary sites were selected (Armed Police Force Hospital (APFH), Thapathali (TH1),

259

Shankhamul (TH2) and Teku (Te3)) for the initial protocol development and optimization. Along

260

with SARS-CoV-2, we also detected other coronaviruses, including Human coronavirus 229E,

261

Duck-dominant coronavirus, Dromedary camel coronavirus HKU223, and Rat coronavirus, in two

262

preliminary sites (TH1 and Te3) (S1 Table).

263

Whole-genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 using MinION and

264

MiSeq

265

Whole-genome sequencing data of detected SARS-CoV-2 were obtained using MinION and

266

MiSeq from two different sites (TH1 and Te3). The result showed a slight difference in genome

267

coverage and contigs recovered from both the platforms. We observed slightly higher genome

268

fraction coverage on MiSeq than on MinION. In one of the samples (TH1), MiSeq produced

269

relatively high (47.2%) genome fragment sequences compared to MinION (32.2%). A similar

270

result was observed in the other sample (Te3), with MiSeq producing around 42.9% sequences

271

compared to 31.1% from MinION (Table 1).

CoVGlue analyses [52] of consensus genomic sequences from both the sequencing platforms

275

indicated the presence of the same Pangolin lineage (B.1). Major mutations were plotted to

276

visualize and differentiate key differences between MiSeq and MinION using the GenVisR tool in

277

R studio Version 1.4.1103. We detected D614G which is the defining mutation of the G clade

278

[54]. MiSeq did detect more mutations than MinION (Fig 4). This finding can be due to greater

279

sequencing depth (1 million reads) obtained in MiSeq than in MinION using Flongle (378,000

SARS-CoV-2 genomic-based environmental surveillance with sewage

291

samples

292

Out of 20 sites, sewage samples from the 16 sites had detectable SARS-CoV-2 (S2 Table). A heat-

293

map of all these 16 SARS-CoV-2 positive sites was created based on viral load intensity and

294

corresponding geospatial data. With a relatively large number of sampling points, dense

295

populations and detected viral load (295 copies/ml), Ward 11 (est. pop=4632) is colored dark in

296

the heat- map. Although Ward 17 (est. pop=9500 people) had the most intense viral load (242,000

297

copies/ml), the sampling points do not cover the entire area, and hence lightly colored in the heat-

298

map than Ward 11. In Ward 9 (est. pop= 2791 people), we did not detect SARS-CoV-2 (Fig 5).

Whole-genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 on MinION

306

Only samples from 14 sites (GW11, SA2, SA7, CH4, KU1, SA5, GW10, GW13, GW14, SA6,

307

SA4, SA9, GW12 and GW15) yielded PCR amplicons using ARTIC primers, of which only 12

308

samples (GW11, SA2, SA7, CH4, KU1, SA5, GW14, SA6, SA4, SA9, GW12 and GW15) had

309

enough quantifiable PCR products (S3 Table, S4 Table) and were tagged with Native Barcode

310

from NBD01 to NBD012 [24]. The consensus genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 have been

311

submitted to National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank (accession no.

312

MW739929-MW739930). MinION sequencing was performed with 6 samples at a time, and run

313

data is shown in Table 1.

314

All of the consensus sequences obtained from MinION were compared against the reference

315

sequence (accession no. MN908947.3) using the CovGlue web application. B.1 (16.7%), B.1.36

316

(33.3%) and B.1.1 (50.0%) were identified as circulating lineages of SARS-CoV-2 in the

317

environmental (sewage) samples (Fig 6).

(transition=57.5%, transversion=42.4%); and A>C or T> G transversion is rarely detected (16.4%)

Discussion

356

As demonstrated by its successful application in the global efforts to eradicate poliovirus [24], ES

357

can be an important supplement to clinical surveillance. In particular, ES can contribute to several

358

critical areas, such as characterizing regional diversity in areas without clinical surveillance,

359

mapping geographic micro-diversity to inform risk-based interventions, early detection of

360

outbreaks before clinical presentation, and advancing real-time assessment of interventions to

361

inform need for additional public health measures [24]. Compared to clinical surveillance, ES can

362

be inexpensive and fast, but this approach has yet to be fully validated as a viable option for

363

estimating disease burden in a field setting.

364

Rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 in environmental samples (such as sewage) and viral strain

365

characterization using portable genomic tools provide important information on disease

366

distribution at a community level [24]. Such data can help identify transmission hotspots in urban

367

and rural communities and provide information on circulating strains of viruses, an essential

368

consideration for vaccination programs. We have optimized a system of detecting the virus from

369

sewage samples, and based on viral load, we have constructed a heat-map of SARS-CoV-2 in the

370

selected areas of the Kathmandu valley. In resource-limited, developing countries like Nepal,

371

access to tools and technologies required to perform genomic-based detection and surveillance can

372

be limited. This feasibility study has demonstrated that ES based on sewage samples using highly

373

sensitive nested PCR combined with portable next-generation sequencing technology can provide

374

adequate sensitivity, specificity, and sequencing depth to detect, quantify, and characterize SARS-

375

CoV-2 accurately.

376

Whole-genome sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 was obtained using ARTIC primers in two

377

popularly used next-generation sequencing platforms (MiSeq (Illumina, USA) and MinION

378

(Oxford Nanopore, UK)). One of our main objectives was to explore the feasibility of using a

379

portable sequencing platform in Nepal. Using the same protocol, the sequencing data obtained

380

from both these platforms were analyzed, and the results obtained were almost identical,

381

demonstrating the suitability of using portable sequencing devices such as MinION to characterize

382

viral (SARS-CoV-2) strains. However, with CoVGlue analysis, we were able to detect more

383

variants (mutations) in Illumina MiSeq than ONT MinION using Flongle flowcell. We can use

384

Flongle (MinION) for screening for rapid surveillance, and further detailed analysis can be done

385

either on MiSeq or SpotON Flowcell (MinION).

386

In our ES samples, we were also able to detect other coronaviruses such as human coronavirus

387

229E, a known cause of the common cold with global distribution [24,59]. The presence of duck

388

dominant coronavirus and rodent coronavirus in sewage suggests an abundant mixture of various

389

coronaviruses originating from other species. A diversity of coronaviruses in sewage samples

390

highlights the potential for emerging coronaviruses among species in close proximity in the urban

391

setting, especially given the propensity for coronaviruses to recombine [60].

392

Out of 20 different sampled sites, 16 had SARS-CoV-2 present. The heat-map generated based on

393

the intensity of viral load correlated well with the catchment area and population size (Fig 5).

394

Analyzing enough sampling points can provide a good picture of circulating viruses in a

395

community. Further studies can be designed to look into incidence estimation in communities and

396

correlate that with available clinical data.

397

The obtained consensus genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from the sewage samples identified

398

B.1, B.1.36 and B1.1 as circulating lineage. The lineage B.1 was a strain circulating in the United

399

States of America (46.0%), United Kingdom (13.0%), Canada (5.0%), Spain (4.0%), and France

400

(4.0%); and was involved in the Italian outbreak [24,61]. B.1.1 was also widely circulating around

401

the globe (United States of America (27.0%), United Kingdom (22.0%), Canada (6.0%), Germany

402

(6.0%), and Netherlands (5.0%)) and is cited as a European lineage [61]. Lineage B.1.36 was the

403

predominant strain circulating in the United States of America (94.0%), and is known as a USA

404

lineage[61]. Whole-genome data of SARS-CoV-2 from 14 clinical samples have been sequenced

405

at our facility for the Nepal Health Research Council (Government of Nepal). Data are publicly

406

available in the GISAID database [24]. Among these, three samples originate from the Kathmandu

407

valley, and identified lineages include B.1.36 and B.1.130. The detected SARS-CoV-2 lineages

408

(B.1, B.1.1, B.1.36) and key mutations such as D614G in the clinical samples were also circulating

409

in the sewage samples.

410

Among the detected mutations, the majority were transitions that provide a snapshot of the

411

evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in the host. Few novel mutations with possible clinical

412

significance were also detected- such as frameshift and silent deletion mutations in S, NSP13,

413

ORF3a, and NSP2 genes. These novel mutations are yet to be reported in the global database, and

414

their functional characterizations are further required. For example, frameshift deletion in the S

415

gene could have important significance in clinical and epidemiological frames. The D614G (in S

416

gene) was spontaneously detected in almost every sample, a defining mutation for the G clade

417

[54]. This particular mutation is associated with increased infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 [23].

418

Another detected mutation, S477N (in S gene), has been reported to increase the binding affinity

419

of the virus to the host’s angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor giving higher

26

420

transmission capability [62,63]. Similarly, novel missense mutations detected in NSP12, NSP2,

421

and N genes from sites in the same Ward indicated ongoing viral circulation in the community.

422

These inferences tell us that the virus is spreading rapidly throughout the community, which

423

provides the virus opportunities for rapid evolution. Such a scenario creates an environment for

424

the emergence of new variants, which was also the reason behind the origins of emerging variants

425

in the UK (B.1.1.7), South Africa (B.1.351), and South America (P.1) [64]. This finding also

426

highlights the mandates for genomic surveillance to track viral evolution and emerging variants.

427

Three major vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Oxford-AstraZeneca) approved by the

428

WHO target spike protein to produce neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 [65]. The

429

detection of circulating viral variants through genomic surveillance has become more critical than

430

ever to evaluate the efficacy of the vaccine against the evolving virus. For this reason, genomic

431

surveillance is gradually being conducted in many developed countries, with the United Kingdom

432

contributing actively to the global genomic database of SARS-CoV-2 [66]. However, developing

433

countries are still struggling to understand COVID-19 incidences and transmission due to a lack

434

of genomic laboratory capabilities. Genomic surveillance in environmental samples could be a

435

possible solution for resource-strapped countries to identify and estimate SARS-CoV-2 presence

436

at a community level and determine the circulating strains of the virus, which could be used to

437

select the most appropriate vaccine.
