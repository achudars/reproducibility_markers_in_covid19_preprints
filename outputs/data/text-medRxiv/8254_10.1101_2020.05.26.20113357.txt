Summary box
What is already known on the subject:
1) The number of deaths due to COVID-19 have been quantified by the Office of National
Statistics
2) These have also been reported across age groups and regions
What this study adds:
1) We report the number of excess deaths, using weekly mortality data from 1/1/2010
2) We also quantify the number of excess deaths, excluding COVID-19 associated deaths,
which can be attributed to COVID-19 directly (but not coded as such) or indirectly (due to
other urgent but unmet health need)
3) Highest excess mortality, excluding COVID-19 deaths, was observed in the West Midlands,
followed by London and the North West
4) Although males had larger excess mortality rates than females across all age groups,
female excess mortality rates excluding COVID-19 were higher in the 85+ age group,
indicating a large undocumented impact of the virus on older females (direct and/or
indirect)
5) The three provided appendices will be updated weekly on the BMJ-JECH website, to
provide up-to-date information of excess mortality by region, sex and age group

Abstract
Background
Deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic result directly from infection and exacerbation of other diseases
and indirectly from deferment of care for other conditions, and are socially and geographically
patterned. We quantified excess mortality in regions of England and Wales during the pandemic, for all
causes and for non-COVID-19 associated deaths.
Methods
Weekly mortality data for 1 Jan 2010 to 1 May 2020 for England and Wales were obtained from the
Office of National Statistics. Mean-dispersion negative binomial regressions were used to model death
counts based on pre-pandemic trends and exponentiated linear predictions were subtracted from: i) allcause deaths; and ii) all-cause deaths minus COVID-19 related deaths for the pandemic period (07-13
March to 25 April to 8 May).
Findings
Between 7 March and 8 May 2020, there were 47,243 (95%CI: 46,671 to 47,815) excess deaths in
England and Wales, of which 9,948 (95%CI: 9,376 to 10,520) were not associated with COVID-19. Overall
excess mortality rates varied from 49 per 100,000 (95%CI: 49 to 50) in the South West to 102 per
100,000 (95%CI: 102 to 103) in London. Non-COVID-19 associated excess mortality rates ranged from -1
per 100,000 (95%CI: -1 to 0) in Wales (i.e. mortality rates were no higher than expected) to 26 per
100,000 (95%CI: 25 to 26) in the West Midlands.
Interpretation
The COVID-19 pandemic has had markedly different impacts on the regions of England and Wales, both
for deaths directly attributable to COVID-19 infection and for deaths resulting from the national public
health response.

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic began in Hubei Province, China towards the end of 2019, and the first
confirmed cases in Britain were recorded on January 31 2020. As of 21 May 2020 there were 158,488
confirmed cases in England and Wales and 33,081 deaths in people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2.1 In
addition to increased risks for men, older age groups,2 and people with long term conditions such as
cardiovascular disease and diabetes, it was clear from the earliest stages of the pandemic that the
consequences of the outbreak would be more severe for some social groups, generally those already
most affected by health inequalities. In mid-April, deaths involving COVID-19 in England ranged from 25
per 100,000 in the most affluent 10% of areas to 55 per 100,000 in the most deprived 10%, following the
same social gradient as pre-pandemic all cause death rates.3 Similar patterns emerged in Wales. Ethnic
minority groups were also disproportionately affected, with mortality rates in for Bangladeshi and
Pakistani ethnicity over three times higher than for White, and rates for Black ethnicity over four times
higher.4 To some extent, these variations may reflect baseline health inequalities across society, but
social deprivation also appears to increase susceptibility to COVID infection specifically, through factors
including overcrowding, working in a key service or agricultural industry, or having serious underlying
medical conditions that increase the risk of COVID-related mortality.
The COVID-19 pandemic has also generated geographic patterns of impact that interact in complex ways
with social patterns. London, a major international gateway, was the first area to be substantially
affected and as of mid-May was the region with the highest number of confirmed cases. However, in
terms of the confirmed infection rate, London was quickly overtaken by other regions; by 13 May,
COVID-19 rates ranged from 128 per 100,000 in the South West to 348 per 100,000 in the North East,1
and hospital admission rates remained highest in the northern regions,5 where baseline health tends to
be poorer.6 In addition to the impact of the virus itself, a second epidemic emerged as a result of the
public health response. Many of the excess deaths during the pandemic are not associated with COVID19 infection,7 and although this may be partly attributable to underdiagnosis, it raises the possibility that
creating emergency capacity in primary and secondary care has compromised essential care. Patients
have also avoided healthcare providers out of concern for service pressures or fear of infection, leading
to delay of treatment and increases in out-of-hospital events such as cardiac arrest.8 9
If these non-COVID-19 excess deaths are also socially and geographically patterned, the consequences
for health inequalities could be severe. To begin to address this issue, in this study we aimed to quantify
excess mortality in England and Wales during the pandemic, as an aggregate and by region and age
group, for all causes and for non-COVID-19 associated deaths.

Methods
Data
Weekly mortality data for the whole of England and Wales were obtained from the Office of National
Statistics (ONS), covering the period from 1 Jan 2010 to 8 May 2020.10 All-cause deaths and deaths
where the underlying cause was respiratory disease were available for England-Wales as an aggregate,
but also by region (former Strategic Health Authority) and age group (under 1, 1-14, 15-44, 45-66, 65-74,
75-84 and 85 or over) for males and females. Respiratory disease deaths excluded deaths at age under
28 days and were obtained using ICD-10 codes J00-J99. For 2020 data, deaths where COVID-19 was
mentioned in the death certificate were also reported (ICD10 U07.1 and U07.2), as England-Wales
aggregates but also by region and age group. However, respiratory and COVID-19 deaths could be
double-counted. Regional counts do not include residents outside England-Wales or those records
where the place of residence is missing, while age group counts do not include deaths where age was
missing.
Underlying cause of death, as reported in England and Wales, is compatible with WHO
recommendations using ICD rules (with small changes in 2011 and 2014), and is obtained from the death
certificate. The underlying cause of death is defined by the WHO as the disease or injury that initiated
the series of events that led directly to death, or the circumstances of the accident or violence that
produced the fatal injury.11 A condition mentioned in the death certificate may be the main reason or a
contributory reason to the cause of death.
The study used aggregated national mortality data reported by the Office of National Statistics, and
ethical approval was not needed.

Analyses
Data were imported, cleaned and formatted as a time series in Stata v16. Death counts, overall and by
stratum of interest were plotted and the same analysis model was used for each. For the excess
mortality modelling, data from week 9 in 2020 (22-28 February), two weeks before the first official
COVID-19 related deaths (7-13 March) were set to missing. Mean-dispersion negative binomial
regressions were used to model death counts, with the fixed-effect predictors being week (as
categorical, to account for seasonality) and time (as continuous, to account for a potential slope). For
each model and stratum, the natural logarithm of the annual population estimate was used as offset.
We selected negative binomial regression models over Poisson models because of the high variation in
the outcome variable. For weeks 11 (7 to 13 March) to 19 (2 to 8 May), the exponentiated linear
prediction from each model (and its 95% confidence intervals) were subtracted from: 1) all-cause
deaths; and 2) all-cause deaths minus deaths where COVID-19 was mentioned. Excess deaths estimates,
in each stratum and overall, were summed across all weeks, with a pooled estimate for the standard
error used to obtain the 95% confidence intervals.

Results
All-cause excess mortality
During the 9-week period from 7 March 2020 to 8 May 2020, overall excess deaths for England and
Wales were 47,243 (95%CI: 46,671 to 47,815) (Table 1). This total includes negative values at the start of
the study period, when excess deaths were lower than predicted from historical trends, continuing a
pattern of relatively low mortality rates in the first 12 weeks of 2020 (Figure 1). London had the greatest
number of excess deaths at 9,219 (95%CI: 9,185 to 9,254), followed by the North West with 6,951
(95%CI: 6,903 to 6,999) and the South East with 6,656 (95%CI: 6,588 to 6,723). The least affected regions
were Wales with 1,757 (95%CI: 1,730 to 1,784) and the North East with 2,239 deaths (95%CI: 2,209 to
2,270). The age-groups with the largest numbers of excess deaths were 85 or over with 20,173 (95%CI:
19,975 to 20,370) and 75-84 with 14,414 (95%CI: 14,304 to 14,524). We estimated 7,021 (95%CI: 6,963
to 7,078) excess all-cause deaths for people aged 65-74 and 4,811 (95%CI: 4,768 to 4,853) for people
aged 45-64.
All-cause excess mortality per 100,000 population is presented in Table 2, with the average across
England and Wales at 79 (95%CI: 78 to 80). The largest mortality ratios were observed in London (102;
95%CI: 102 to 103), the West Midlands (97; 95%CI: 96 to 98) and the North West (94; 95%CI: 93 to 95),
and the lowest in the South West (49; 95%CI: 49 to 50) and Wales (55; 95%CI: 55 to 56) (Figure 2). The
mortality ratios for people aged 85 or over, 75-84, 65-74 and 45-64 were 1,331 (95%CI: 1,318 to 1,344),
388 (95%CI: 385 to 391), 118 (95%CI: 117 to 117) and 31 (95%CI: 31 to 32), respectively.
Excess all-cause deaths were estimated for all male and female age groups, and were higher for males
for all age groups from age 15, with the exception of the 85+ age group. We estimated 9,086 (95%CI:
9,013 to 9,159) excess all-cause deaths for males aged 85 or over, compared to 11,123 for females
(95%CI: 10,997 to 11,250). However, males aged 75-84 were estimated to have had 8,540 deaths
(95%CI: 8,481 to 8,598), compared to 5,890 (95%CI: 5,836 to 5,944) for females, and males aged 65-74
were estimated to have had 4,662 deaths (95%CI: 4,628 to 4,696), compared to 2,360 (95%CI: 2,334 to
2,386) for females.
Mortality ratios per 100,000 population more clearly demonstrated the higher excess deaths in males.
For males aged 85 or over, 75-84, 65-74 and 45-64, these were estimated at 1,602 (95%CI: 1,589 to
1,615), 503 (95%CI: 500 to 507), 162 (95%CI: 161 to 164) and 42 (95%CI: 41 to 42). Female estimates for
the respective age groups were 1,173 (95%CI: 1,160 to 1,186), 291 (95%CI: 289 to 294), 76 (95%CI: 75 to
77) and 21 (95%CI: 21 to 22).

All-cause excess mortality not attributed to COVID-19
From 7 March 2020 to 8 May 2020, overall excess deaths for England and Wales, excluding cases where
COVID-19 was mentioned in the death certificate, were 9,948 (95%CI: 9,376 to 10,520) (Table 3). It is
important to note that until the week ending 1 May 2020, the total was 11,141 (95%CI: 10,567 to
11,714), but there was a large drop into negative values in the last week of analysis (2 May to 8 May
2020). London was again the worst hit region in terms of number of excess deaths with 1,814 (95%CI:
1,780 to 1,849), followed by the South East with 1,570 (95%CI: 1,502 to 1,637) and the West Midlands
with 1,531 (95%CI: 1,483 to 1,579) (Figure 3). The least affected regions were again Wales with -18
(95%CI: -45 to 9) and the North East with 320 (95%CI: 290 to 351). The age-groups with the largest

numbers of excess deaths were 85 or over with 5,124 (95%CI: 4,926 to 5,321) and 75-84 with 2,207
(95%CI: 2,097 to 2,317). Estimated excess deaths for people aged 65-74 and 45-64 were 1,249 (95%CI:
1,191 to 1,306) and 969 (95%CI: 926 to 1,011), respectively.
Non-COVID-19 excess mortality per 100,000 population is presented in Table 4, with the average across
England and Wales at 17 (95%CI: 16 to 18). The largest mortality ratios were in the West Midlands (26;
95%CI: 25 to 26), followed by the East of England (21; 95%CI: 20 to 21), the North West (20; 95%CI: 19 to
21) and London (20; 95%CI: 20 to 21) (Figure 4). Ratios for people aged 85 or over, 75-84, 65-74 and 4564 were 338 (95%CI: 325 to 351), 59 (95%CI: 56 to 62), 21 (95%CI: 20 to 22) and 6 (95%CI: 6 to 7),
respectively.
Excess all-cause deaths, excluding deaths where COVID-19 was documented cause of death on the
death certificate, were higher for males for all age groups from age 45, with the exception of the 85+
age group. We estimated 3,250 (95%CI: 3,124 to 3,377) excess deaths for females aged 85 or over,
compared to 1,910 for males (95%CI: 1,837 to 1,983). However, males were estimated to have had
1,214 (95%CI: 1,155 to 1,272), 863 (95%CI: 829 to 897) and 614 (95%CI: 587 to 640) excess deaths for
age groups 75-84, 65-74 and 45-64, respectively. By comparison, females were estimated to have had
1,009 (95%CI: 955 to 1,063), 387 (95%CI: 361 to 413) and 352 (95%CI: 334 to 370) excess deaths for age
groups 75-84, 65-75 and 45-64, respectively. Males also had higher non-COVID-19 mortality ratios per
100,000 population, with 337 (95%CI: 324 to 350) for males aged 85 or over, 72 (95%CI: 68 to 75) for
males aged 75-84, and 30 (95%CI: 29 to 31) for males aged 65-74. Female estimates for the respective
age groups were 343 (95%CI: 329 to 356), 50 (95%CI: 47 to 53) and 12 (95%CI: 12 to 13).

Supplementary files
Three dynamic supplementary files are also provided, produced in LaTeX for almost complete
automation, which will be updated weekly. The first appendix reports the graphs presented in the
paper, time-series of excess deaths by region, but also time series of excess deaths by age group and
sex. The second appendix reports absolute numbers, the third reports ratios over 100,000 population,
for each stratum of interest. For the overall England-Wales aggregate, each region and each age group
(sex specific or not), we report the following time-series: mortality, mortality and predictions from the
negative binomial regression model, all-cause excess deaths and all-cause excess deaths where COVID19 is not mentioned in the death certificate. All these time series are reported from the 1st week of
2010, the 1st week of 2019 and the 1st week of 2020 (to allow for a more complete overview).

Discussion
Our models, based on historical mortality trends, illustrate the scale of the COVID-19 pandemic and its
direct and indirect impacts on population health. Over the first nine weeks, there were 47,243 excess
deaths (95%CI: 46,617 to 47,815) in England and Wales, of which over a fifth (9,948, 95%CI: 9,376 to
10,520) were not directly attributed to COVID-19 infection. This likely underestimates the impact of the
virus, as prior to the pandemic mortality rates for 2020 were relatively low, particularly compared with
years with high influenza activity (2015 and 2018). Excess death rates started to increase after 20 March
and peaked between 17 and 24 April, with the highest peaks (up to 26 deaths per 100,000) in London,
the West Midlands and the North West and the lowest peaks in the East Midlands, Wales and the South
West. Non-COVID-19 associated deaths followed similar general patterns. As has been previously
reported, we observed that males had larger excess mortality rates than females across all age groups.
However, female excess mortality rates excluding COVID-19 were higher in the 85+ age group, indicating
a large undocumented impact of the virus on older females, which is likely to be both direct and
indirect.

Strengths and Limitations
This analysis of national data for England and Wales provides a comprehensive picture of excess deaths
due to COVID-19, either directly or indirectly, based on diagnosis by clinicians closely involved with
patient care. This allows for clinical judgment of the contribution of pandemic coronavirus to death, and
does not only rely on a positive test for COVID-19 infection.
However, there are several important limitations. Although counts of deaths are likely to be accurate,
cause of death information is less reliable, as it is reliant on accurate diagnosis and recording by
clinicians dealing with exceptional circumstances. ONS reports of COVID-19 related deaths are based on
clinical judgments, which in some cases will have been made without positive PCR or antibody testing.
Although this confers some advantages compared to solely relying on the presence of a positive test,
particularly when the sensitivity of these tests varies between 60-80%, unexpected deaths in elderly
multimorbid patients or in those with respiratory symptoms may be misattributed to COVID-19. We
controlled for annual population size, while our analyses are weekly, since changes in the population
structure are small and gradual and not available on a weekly basis. Data for the latest weeks are
provisional, subject to updates in later ONS releases, and the ONS reports the date of registration,
rather than date of death, resulting in fluctuations in counts during certain periods (for example, over
Easter). Finally, in assessing the unintended consequences of the public health response, it is important
to note that we estimated net excess deaths. We do not know how many deaths have been avoided by
adopting public health social isolation measures, either through reducing exposure to COVID-19 itself or
through spill-over benefits such as reduced road traffic fatalities. Prediction models estimated that
mortality rates due to COVID-19 infection, in the absence of mitigation, would reach 3,000 deaths per
day in England & Wales by the end of May 2020, and over 460,000 deaths in total by August,12 a much
higher burden of death than observed in this study for both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 related
mortality.

Findings
Around a quarter of excess deaths during the study period did not have a diagnosis of COVID-19
infection recorded on the death certificate. This may be partly attributable to missed diagnoses, for
example where testing did not occur, there was a false negative result or infection did not produce
noticeable symptoms. The risk of missed diagnosis is likely to have reduced over time, as capacity for
testing has increased, the tests have become more accurate and clinicians were encouraged to record
suspected COVID-19 infection on death certificates.13 This may even have resulted in bias in the
opposite direction, with deaths misattributed to COVID-19 infection later in the outbreak, which may
partly explain the negative values for non-COVID-19 excess deaths in the week ending 8 May.
Nevertheless, our results suggest that focusing the health service and wider society on managing a
single disease has had unintended consequences. Creating capacity within the health system to manage
anticipated demand from patients infected with COVID-19 necessitated the cessation of ‘non-essential’
activity - in reality, non-urgent activity. In addition to reduced supply, there was a simultaneous
reduction in demand from patients seeking to protect health services and avoid exposure. As a result,
attendances in A&E departments in England in April 2020 were 57% lower than in 2019 and emergency
hospital admissions were 39% lower,14 while access to health services for people with pre-existing
conditions was 20% lower during the COVID-19 peak period.15 Non-attendance may have serious
immediate consequences, with a reduction in high acuity attendances requiring urgent admission such
as acute coronary syndromes, strokes and heart failure. The focus on protecting the NHS also exposed
those dependent on the social care sector,16 particularly high-risk residents living in close proximity in
care homes. Both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 deaths rose rapidly in these settings,17 accounting for
over half of all excess deaths in England and Wales.
The observed differences in impacts of COVID-19 across the regions of England and Wales have a range
of potential causes that will need to be explored in further detail. COVID-19 spreads through close
human contact, and high rates of infection quickly developed in the major conurbations, particularly
London, Birmingham (West Midlands), Liverpool and Manchester (North West), and this is reflected in
regional excess mortality rates. Following exposure, there are several key risk factors for adverse
outcomes, including age, ethnicity, multi-morbidity (particularly diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and
conditions and treatments suppressing the immune system), smoking and obesity. However, with
respect to age, the regions with the lowest – rather than the highest – proportion of the population over
the age of 65 (London, the West Midlands and the North West) had the highest rates of excess deaths,
although older populations within the regions were most affected. London is an outlier in terms of age,
with only 12.1% of the population over age 65 and 1.7% over age 85 compared to 18.5% and 2.5%
respectively for England and Wales, but it was disproportionately affected by the pandemic in its early
stages. With respect to ethnicity, Wales and the North East have the smallest BAME populations and
London by far the highest.18 Other key risk factors, including obesity, smoking and multimorbidity are
strongly associated with deprivation,19 20 the highest concentrations of which are found in the North
East, North West,21 and the south of Wales.22 Regional rates of excess deaths were not clearly associated
with levels of deprivation, although within regions more deprived communities have been
disproportionately affected,2 reflecting higher prevalence of risk factors, ability to comply with social
distancing requirements and exposure to air pollution.23
To date, trends in non-COVID-19 related excess deaths during the pandemic have followed the same
general pattern as all cause excess deaths, with some English regions and Wales appearing to be

relatively unaffected. This may reflect factors such as differences in: levels of testing, thresholds for
diagnosis, sociodemographic structures, levels of rurality, service engagement by older patients, and
capacities within local health and social care systems. As the pandemic develops, the balance between
COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 related deaths is likely to change, and different patterns may develop
across the regions. These patterns will need to be monitored as the longer-term impacts of the
pandemic and the public health response emerge.

Conclusion
Short term trends in excess deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic have not followed typical regional
patterns for premature mortality in England and Wales, particularly for deaths not directly attributable
to the virus. Some regions where mortality rates tend to be low, for example the South East and East,
have had relatively high rates of non-COVID-19 related deaths. Predicting longer-term impacts requires
caution, but given the sudden and comprehensive re-prioritisation of services, it is likely that a second
wave of non-COVID-19 related need is currently building in the community. When this breaks it could
overwhelm parts of the NHS, and communities with high baseline levels or morbidity are likely to be hit
harder than others and this should be recognised in planning post-pandemic health and social care
services.24 The national response will need to address local variations in viral activity, in health and social
care provision, and in pandemic preparedness, including management of ‘routine’ care during a national
emergency. It will also need to address long-standing structural disadvantages that expose parts of the
country to avoidable harm from both chronic and acute infectious disease.
