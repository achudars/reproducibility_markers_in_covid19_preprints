Abstract
This paper seeks to determine which workers affected by lockdown measures can return
to work when a government decides to apply lockdown exit strategies. This system, which
we call Sequential Selective Multidimensional Decision (SSMD), involves deciding
sequentially, by geographical areas, sectors of activity, age groups and immunity, which
workers can return to work at a given time according to the epidemiological criteria of
the country as well as that of a group of reference countries, used as a benchmark, that
have suffered a lower level of lockdown de-escalation strategies. We apply SSMD to
Spain, based on affiliation to the Social Security system prior to the COVID-19 pandemic,
and conclude that 98.37% of the population could be affected. The proposed system
makes it possible to accurately identify the target population for serological IgG antibody
tests in the work field, as well as those affected by special income replacement measures
due to lockdown being maintained over a longer period.

Version 1.0 – May 3, 2020

1. Introduction
On December 31, 2019, the first case of COVID-19 was reported by China to the WHO1.
On January 30, 2020, the WHO declared a “Public Health Emergency of International
Concern (PHEIC)”2 and on March 11, 2020 declared that COVID-19 could be considered
a pandemic, with cases in 114 countries3. On January 23, Chinese authorities reacted to
mass contagion in the city of Wuhan by imposing major restrictions on the mobility of
people, in other words a lockdown, which was later extended by varying degrees to other
parts of the area affected4. This measure was subsequently applied in Italy, initially only
to certain northern regions and later to the country as a whole. Finally, Spain directly
applied a national lockdown, without exceptions (Royal Decree 463/2020, March 14).
Since then, many of the countries affected have been applying lockdown measures,
although with very different characteristics and to varying degrees and normally adopting
less stringent lockdown measures than those imposed in Spain.
A full-scale nationwide lockdown is a drastic and controversial measure, which affects
both social and economic activities. The benefit it produces has an immediate impact on
health. Mortality is drastically reduced by cutting viral transmission routes, and thereby
preventing health systems from collapsing.5. Furthermore, it allows for a lower incidence
of the disease while an effective vaccine or treatment appears. In contrast to this health
benefit, there are very high costs, especially in terms of the economy. Lockdown reduces
GDP and increases the number of unemployed6. It can also send stock market prices7
tumbling by dissipating financial wealth, added to which it jeopardises the liquidity of
many people and entities8 and with it that of financial institutions, …
In other words, lockdown saves lives, but paralyzes the economy and can trigger an
economic shock of enormous proportions9. This extremely high economic cost makes
deciding when to lockdown a difficult issue for public authorities. Similarly, lifting
lockdown restrictions is also a difficult decision since, if contagion reappears, the country
or region will have borne a very high economic cost without the measures having proved
effective in reducing the effects of the pandemic. Obviously, these decisions are even
more difficult to take when the country is one of those most affected, since it is not known
how effective the measures being taken have been or what the likelihood is of causing a
resurgence of the virus.
As the reproductive rate of the virus has declined, the WHO and the countries affected
have begun to consider criteria for gradually bringing an end to the lockdown. The WHO
establishes public health criteria for lockdown de-escalation strategies, while it is the
governments who must combine these criteria with economic and political considerations
in order to decide who lockdown exit strategy should be applied to as well as when and
how.
In decentralized countries, it is common to see proposals for geographical lockdown exit
strategies. Such is the case of the United States, where public health powers are in the
hands of state governors, or Spain, where health care is under the control of the
autonomous communities (regions) while public health is run by the central government.
Whatever the case, in addition to the political circumstances, selective or asymmetric
geographical lockdown exit strategies are fully understandable in large countries which
have substantial epidemiological differences.
As regards the economic approaches aimed at gradually bringing lockdown to an end,
which is the case in hand, the most obvious criterion is the sectoral criterion. In most
countries, lockdown has been selective by sectors of activity depending on the social

contact involved. It is also reasonable, therefore, to propose that lockdown exit strategies
should follow the same pattern. In the case of COVID-19, it will not be possible for the
lockdown exit strategy to be a symmetrical but reverse process to the lockdown strategy
since, while there is no vaccine, many services will be forced to change their production
organization and it will not be possible to meet demand in the same way as before the
COVID-19 pandemic. However, proposing a selective lockdown de-escalation strategy
by activity sectors based on how the virus has been transmitted is inevitable, since this is
how lockdown was applied.
Furthermore, empirical evidence shows that mortality is directly related to patient age.
Older people tend to suffer from the infection in its most virulent form and many end up
requiring admission to intensive care units or even dying. This means that some countries
promote deconfinement strategies designed to protect the most vulnerable age groups. In
the United Kingdom, the proposal for age-selective lockdown exit strategies has been in
place since the beginning, and there are now proposals for age-selective lockdown exit
strategies10.
Finally, there is the proposal for a lockdown exit strategy by immunity detected through
serological tests. The proposal involves deconfining all of those who test positive for
antibodies by issuing an immunity passport11,12. For this to prove feasible in the
workplace, all workers would need to be tested. However, the WHO opposes this type of
proposal and has issued a scientific note stating that “There is currently no evidence that
people who have recovered from COVID-19 and have antibodies are protected from a
second infection”13. As in the previous case, lack of immunity can lead to ethical and
social justice issues14.
Since there are different possible dimensions for lockdown exit strategies, in this
document we present a system for deciding on the number of workers that could return
to work according to said dimensions. This system involves defining a sequence of
decisions to determine which working population lockdown exit strategy should be
applied to by geographical area, sector of activity, age range, and immunity. The aim of
applying Sequential Selective Multidimensional Decisioning (SSMD) is therefore to
decide the number of workers who can return to work at a given time. It is important to
emphasize that it does not seek to establish a timeframe for a lockdown de-escalation
strategy, although it may be applied at successive moments to define a lockdown exit
strategy timeline.
As an example, we apply the SSMD designed for Spain, whose characteristics in terms
of lockdown and lockdown de-escalation strategies are summarized in Appendix 1. As a
reference, we use data on workers affiliated to the social security system in February
2020, at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and as health criteria we use contagion and
mortality rates. The structure of the SSMD is flexible and can be adapted to different
health criteria and to different levels of geographical, sectoral and age structure
disaggregation.
The work is structured as follows. In section 2, we describe the method to be applied. In
section 3, we include the description of the data used. Section 4 presents the results, and
is followed with a discussion thereof in section 5. Finally, some brief conclusions are
provided in section 6.

2. Methodology
A.- Dimensions for the lockdown de-escalation strategy
Given the economic cost of lockdown, from the moment the virus’ reproductive rate drops
below one, authorities are faced with the decision of what lockdown de-escalation
strategy to adopt. Authorities can either follow the previous course and completely reopen
all economic-social activity, maintaining lockdown in its original state until final
deconfinement, or apply a selective lockdown exit strategy in stages. The first option has
the social and economic benefit of allowing all workers to return to their jobs, which
avoids a deeper recession. However, it has the disadvantage of possible loss of health and
human life if there is a fresh outbreak. The second, the other extreme, has the
disadvantage of the loss of the social and economic benefit associated with economic
paralysis, triggering a longer-lasting recession, although it would prevent the virus from
re-emerging and thus prevent fatalities. In between the two lie all the selective or partial
lockdown de-escalation strategies based on defining criteria related to relevant economic
or social aspects over a longer or shorter period during which a gradual lockdown exit
strategy is applied. The latter seeks to combine health benefits and reduced economic
costs, and thus strike a balance.
The features of lockdown exit strategies can differ according to the type of virus, although
there is always the possibility of a selective or asymmetric lockdown de-escalation
strategy depending on:
-

Geographical criteria: carrying out a selective or asymmetric geographical
lockdown exit strategy, when there are substantial differences in the incidence of
the epidemic.
Sectors of activity: deconfining by sectors of activity depending on the contagion
potential of each type of activity.
Age: by deconfining citizens according to age, given that the disease does not
impact the different age groups equally.
Immunity: by deconfining all citizens who have tested positive through
serological tests and are immune.

Public authorities can establish a one-dimensional lockdown exit strategy, using only one
of these, or a multi-dimensional strategy by combining several of them.
For the lockdown process, Spain used the activity dimension sector, and applied it
throughout the country as a whole: in other words, it used a one-dimensional lockdown
strategy. For its lockdown exit strategy, the Spanish government has developed a selective
multidimensional strategy based on distinguishing by areas and by sector.
B.- The decision on how many workers may return to work
At each point in the lockdown de-escalation process, whether at a single moment or at the
beginning of each phase, public authorities must decide on how many workers to apply
the lockdown exit strategy to. This paper seeks to answer this question. To this end, we
propose adopting a selective multidimensional approach, using the four criteria for the
above-mentioned lockdown exit strategy: geographical, sector of activity, age, and
immunity.
The process we apply is described in the decision tree in Figure 1.

Source: own elaboration.
As shown in the figure above, the process consists of an orderly sequence of selective
lockdown exit strategy decisions.
-

Decision Level I. First, we decide on the selective geographical lockdown exit
strategy, considering the minimum territorial division for which we have data on
all the variables involved.
When health authorities analyse geographical scope, the main concern is to
control the rate of infection. Based on this, for the first decision level, we divided
areas into two groups: low and high COVID-19 cumulative infection rate. To
define this benchmark level, as a reference group we use countries with a below
average rate of lockdown exit strategies in the European Union (plus the UK),
assessed from the data on variation in mobility provided by Google and we
calculate the average cumulative infection rate for the group.
We classify as low mortality areas those below the average European incidence
value, and as high mortality areas those above said value, and we apply the fullscale geographical lockdown exit strategy to areas with a low mortality rate, while
those with a high mortality move on to the second phase of decision.
This geographically selective lockdown exit strategy requires strong border
control and enormous social discipline.

-

Decision Level II. For high mortality areas, we apply a selective sectorial
lockdown exit strategy criterion. We cannot establish any objective system in this
regard since there is no information on the disease that would allow us to deduce
an effective difference between sectors in terms of mortality. The only reference
is that given by the lockdowns. Based on this information, we have divided the
sectors by their capacity for contagion, considering the social relations involved

and following the lockdown criteria generally employed by governments. The
result is two groups of sectors of activity: sectors with high contagion possibility,
if they are usually affected by lockdowns; and low contagion possibility, if they
are usually less affected by lockdowns.
Applying this criterion, for the areas that have moved on to Decision Level II we
fully deconfine sectors that display a low possibility of contagion while those with
a high possibility of contagion pass to the third Decision Level.
The problem here concerns the difficulty involved in complying with social
distancing in the workplace and the pressure being exerted by those sectors which
are pushing for a lockdown exit strategy, given their weight in GDP. In this case,
public authorities must be strict vis-à-vis establishing working conditions and the
provision for demand that will protect the health of both workers and consumers
alike.
-

Decision Level III. For activity sectors in areas still under lockdown and that pass
to this decision level, we apply a selective lockdown exit strategy by age. For the
decision on a lockdown exit process, we again take as a reference the same group
of European countries, but use the mortality rate by age cohort as data, since in
this case what is relevant when deciding in individual health terms is the
possibility of a subject dying due to the disease. We therefore use the average
cumulative mortality rate per 100,000 inhabitants for the group. Thus, if the age
group has a lower mortality rate than the European one, we apply a lockdown exit
strategy to that age group, whereas if it does not, then the age group will move on
to the next decision level. By applying the criterion to the age groups of the
different area sectors of activity that have reached this stage, we can bring a
significant proportion of workers in those sectors back to work. In other words,
the idea is to apply lockdown exit strategies in accordance with the active
population pyramid of the sectors of activity, and responds to the fact that the
virus is not hitting all age groups in the same way.
In this case, protection of workers at the workplace is crucial, and public
authorities must be even stricter when establishing working conditions and
demand provision.

-

Decision Level IV. The result of the previous decision level is that the most
vulnerable age groups in the most vulnerable sectors remain in lockdown only in
areas suffering the highest incidence of the virus. In this case, the serological
criterion would be applied. These workers would be the first to undergo
serological testing, such that if they have antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 they would
be given an immunity passport and could return to work. Obviously, precise data
on incidence will not be available until serological tests are carried out. To fill this
gap, we return to the European reference and, for all available studies15, take the
serological study carried out in Germany on a community with a high incidence
of the disease, Gangelt, which could resemble Spain, and which reports 14%
seropositive16.

Decision Levels III and IV raise ethical issues that force a debate on the matter and require
an assessment of the compensation to be given to those who, because they are more
vulnerable, are forced to remain in lockdown. This compensation is no longer an

emergency compensation, and the amount must therefore be close to replacing the income
lost during lockdown.
Once the calculations of lockdown exit strategies associated with the SSMD have been
made, we calculate the related mortality. For each decision level i and each area k, we
estimate the death toll (DeathTollik). To do this, we calculate the number of liberated
workers in each age group j in that area (LibWorkersik), multiplying the percentage of that
age group with respect to the total in the province (%Workersjk) by the mortality rate for
that age group (MortRateAgeGroupj) which, in the absence of provincial data, we have
taken for the country as a whole. The total number of deaths in the province is obtained
by adding up the four levels. To calculate the total number of deaths, the number of deaths
in each province is added up (DeathTollk). For decision level IV, we set a mortality rate
of 0 because workers are immune.
We perform the calculation from expression (1):

This allows us to calculate the mortality rate per 100,000 deconfined workers: that is, the
mortality rate associated with the applied SSMD.

3. Data
The data on Spain and Europe that we use to apply the SSMD designed are as follows:
A.- Social Security Affiliation Data
The employment situation in Spain prior to the lockdown decision is obtained from the
social security affiliation on February 29, 202017. We have calculated the total number of
those affiliated in each activity group by adding up the corresponding number in all
sections of the national social security system. In the case of the general section and the
sections for self-employed workers, data are provided by the national social security
system. Affiliates of the other special sections have been added to those activity groups
most closely related to them. Specifically:
-

Group A, for agriculture, forestry and fishing, also includes the special section
for agricultural workers and the special section for seafarers, both those who are
salaried and those who are self-employed.
Group B, for mining and quarrying, also includes the special section for coal
mining.
Group T, for household activities such as employers of domestic staff; household
activities such as producers of goods and services for own use, includes the
special section for domestic staff.

Data are included in Appendix 2 (Table A2.1).
For provincial distribution by age, we took provincial data from the general treasury of
the social security18 in average values of the same month. The distribution percentages
are shown in Table A2.2 of Appendix 2.
B.- Epidemiological data on COVID-19 in Spain

We took the epidemiological data of COVID-19 in Spain for April 20, 2020. Table 1
includes provincialized data on cumulative infections and deaths, except for the
autonomous communities of Catalonia and Galicia, for which no data are available. For
these autonomous communities we chose to use aggregate data from them. The last two
columns present the rates per 100,000 inhabitants. To prepare the table, we use data from
the Spanish government website to report on COVID-1919 and the Escovid19data20
website which groups provincial data from various official sources.

C.- Calculation of the Indicator of the Level of Deconfinement in Europe
In Europe, the level of lockdown has differed between countries. The approach adopted
in this work is that if the geographical area of a country has similar data to those of
countries with lower lockdown levels, then it can apply a lockdown de-escalation process
to its workers. Differences in lockdown between countries are so high that it is impossible
to make a comparative assessment. Google recently published mobility data based on the
location of mobile phones as a measure of social distance in what they call COVID-19
Community Mobility Reports23. This database shows five measures of the degree to
which individuals’ mobility has changed during the health crisis. Specifically, it measures
the change in travel to four different types of places: shops, recreation areas, restaurants,
shopping malls or museums; grocery stores, supermarkets and pharmacies; national
parks, beaches, public squares and gardens; transit stations, metros, buses or trains;
workplaces. In general, the figures reflect a drop in the numbers. The database also
measures the degree to which individuals have remained in their places of residence
compared to the pre-pandemic situation.
From the published data, we have used the data referring to the latest available day as of
writing this paper, April 17, 2020, to estimate an index of the degree of lockdown by
taking the average of the absolute values of the percentage of reduction in movement and
increased stay in places of residence offered by Google. We thus obtain an index that

increases with the severity of the lockdown in each country. Table 3 shows this indicator,
ranked from lowest to highest degree of lockdown.

Index

Source: Own elaboration based on data from Google23.
From this index, we calculate the average value of the whole sample of countries, and
which takes the value 42. All the countries below this value, marked in bold, make up the
reference group of countries with a low level of lockdown, which we then use to calculate
the thresholds of lockdown exit strategies in rates of infected and accumulated deaths per
100,000 inhabitants.
D.- Epidemiological data on COVID-19 in Europe
Table 4 includes the epidemiological data for EU countries plus the UK. We understand
that, due to their socioeconomic and health characteristics, they offer an adequate
reference group for comparisons to be made with Spain. Data are taken from the 91st
report on the evolution of COVID-19 issued by the World Health Organization for April
20, 2020. Population data are taken from Eurostat.

4. Results
Applying the described methodology, we built the SSMD for the Spanish case for a
territorial level of provinces that gives the results shown in Figure 2.
For the geographical scope (Decision Level I), the aim is to prevent the spread of COVID19. We thus calculate the threshold corresponding to the accumulated transmission levels
in European countries with a below average degree of lockdown, combining Tables 5 and
6 and obtaining, as a result, a threshold of 118.2 transmissions per 100,000 inhabitants.
Provinces whose mortality rates are below the threshold are Almería, Cádiz, Huelva,
Murcia, and Las Palmas, which represents 1,945,137 social security affiliates who would
be able to return to work. Provinces that fail to meet this requirement are moved to
Decision Level II.
As explained in the methodology section, Decision Level II proposes a lockdown exit by
sector of activity. Since we lack epidemiological data on the pandemic by sector, we
cannot use the threshold level and therefore proceed by taking as low contagion
possibility sectors those that were considered as such by the Spanish government, and
whose activity was not prohibited, except during the two weeks of total lockdown.
Obviously, these sectors must be allowed to return because they operate with a low level
of social interaction.
Sectors excluded due to high social interaction would be the following:

-

Sector G: Wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles
Sector I: Hotels, bars, and restaurants
Sector R: Arts related activities, recreational and leisure activities

The remaining sectors of activity would be included among those qualified as sectors with
a low possibility of contagion, and their workers would return to work. Applying this
criterion would affect 12,773,315 of those affiliated to the social security system who
could then return to work.

Decision Level III involves assessing the lockdown de-escalation process in sectors of
activity considered to be highly contagious in provinces where deconfinement is not fullscale. For this phase, we used the age dimension, given that the disease has a different
epidemiological impact, as seen in Table 2. In this case, in order to determine who can
return to work we again take data from the European reference group. When going down
to the personal level, the fundamental concern is to prevent people who, because of their
age may develop lethal COVID-19, from going to work. As a result, we take as a reference
the average accumulated mortality rate of the reference group, which is 5.6 per 100,000
people. Applying this criterion would mean that in these sectors workers up to 59 years
of age who are not able to work could return to work. Workers aged 60 or over would
move to Decision Level IV. The total number of workers returning to their jobs at this
stage would be 4,195,118.
Workers who would go on to Decision Level IV would be those aged 60 or over, and who
belong to the sectors of activity with a high possibility of contagion in provinces with
cumulative contagion rates above the average of the European reference group of
countries with a low degree of lockdown exit. These workers would be subject to
immunity criteria: serological IgG antibody tests would be carried out, and if they tested

Who can go back to work when the COVID-19 pandemic remits?

positive they could return to work. As already stated, taking as a reference the serological
study carried out in Germany16 on a community with a high incidence of the disease,
Gangelt, which could be deemed to resemble Spain, 14% could test positive. This would
mean that a further 51,218 workers could return to work as they are immune.
The result of applying these criteria to the available data is that 314,627 workers would
be left to return to work after the SSMD. Table 5 shows the relevant figures by province
at each Decision Level. The final column includes the provincial distribution of workers
who would be waiting to return to work and for whom income replacement measures
would be required.

Who can go back to work when the COVID-19 pandemic remits?
Version 1.0 – May 3, 2020

Source: Own elaboration.
Once we have obtained the number of liberated workers by province and age from the
SSMD, we can establish an estimate of the mortality rate associated with this lockdown
exit strategy by applying equation (1). The result we obtain is a mortality rate of 1.35
deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, which marks a low level of mortality associated with the
age composition of the workers and the epidemiological incidence of COVID-19 in their
age groups. Table 6 shows the estimated deaths by province and the national total for each
phase.

5. Discussion
The results presented are a simplified approximation to SSMD-type decision making. The
authorities, in our case the Spanish Government, clearly have information at a much more
disaggregated level that would allow the SSMD results to be fine-tuned to a far greater
degree.
The SSMD presented poses obvious problems in terms of quantification. We have taken
the month of February as a reference, while the Spanish Government is proposing
deconfinement for May. By using February, we underestimate the possibilities of
improving affiliation to the social security system since May presents higher levels of
affiliation due to seasonality. We could have used May 2019 as a reference month, but
we considered February to be preferable as this seasonality is associated with the sectors
whose activities have been prohibited by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Moreover, we maintain a purely quantitative accounting approach: that is, we do not take
into consideration the economic dynamics implicit in the evolution of the economy in the
face of a shock such as that triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic. A more accurate
economic approach to the real number of those who could return to work would require
a much more in-depth analysis of how the economy and employment are likely to evolve,
considering both demand and supply factors. However, it is not our aim to assess the real
effects of the lockdown exit strategies, but rather to examine the difference between
combined multidimensional and one-dimensional lockdown exit strategies.
There are several advantages to the SSMD lockdown exit strategy. On the one hand, it
offers us a target-oriented, rather than tailor-made, view of the problem. Logical
reasoning would initially lead us to consider that equal measures give rise to equal results.
However, nothing could be further from the truth when it is scientifically evaluated. A
country succeeds in reducing daily infections of COVID-19 by lockdown strategies. Yet
in areas of the country where no infections have occurred it has failed to reduce anything.
Isolating those infected, social distancing, frequent hand-washing, wearing a face mask,
avoiding concentrations of people in confined places, preventing long distance travel,
etc., are measures that have a similar effect in any area, while confining an entire
population to their homes can have a negligible effect in a rural area but a very significant
one in a large city like Madrid or Barcelona. The same measures give different results
depending on the initial conditions and the environment. From our point of view, a
lockdown de-escalation strategy must aim to achieve the same results, but not to apply
the same measures. This should be so because we must not incur excessive and avoidable
economic costs. The strategy proposed here adapts to this way of looking at the problem,
and is closer to the viewpoint of the person who must make the decision.
Another advantage of the strategy we propose is that it makes it possible to substantially
reduce the populations targeted by urgent public health measures. In the study, we
identified, for economic purposes, as an urgent target population for serological tests
those workers aged 60 in the wholesale and retail trade and repair of motor vehicles;

Who can go back to work when the COVID-19 pandemic remits?
Version 1.0 – May 3, 2020

hotels, bars, and restaurants; arts related activities, recreational and leisure activities
sectors. In other words, we reduce the immediate need for serological testing to 1.9% of
workers. This relieves the authorities from the pressure of having to get more tests than
are immediately required and it also means the testing procedure can be better organised.
The WHO already applied this approach when it recommended that full-scale testing of
health-care workers should be a priority.
Furthermore, by significantly reducing the affected population by applying geographical
and sectoral criteria, we reduce all the moral problems associated with age-selective
lockdown and the need for an immunity passport, which would also be greatly reduced.
We also curb the public costs derived from having to cover the income of furloughed
employees by positing a high level of lockdown exit measures and by reducing the
number of people affected.
Finally, the proposal is very versatile as it allows for more or less strict public health
criteria to be established, which differ from those being introduced here. Public
authorities can use other criteria that are more in line with public health needs at any given
time without invalidating the method. The flexibility of the strategy is also feasible at
other levels, as we can disaggregate the geographical, sectoral, or age level, while
maintaining the structure of the decision-making system. Disaggregation helps to refine
the result, improve decision-making and reduce health risks.

6. Conclusions
The current health pandemic has become a social and public health crisis that is
unprecedented in our recent history. From the point of view of public health and social
justice, understood from a Rawls and Sen perspective, the first obligation is to save lives
and to support all health workers as well as all of those groups that ensure our day to day
existence. However, although health is the most urgent issue, the resources dedicated to
health protection are related to economic development, and post-pandemic economic
needs may entail enormous social and personal costs. At present, the models developed
considering different contingency scenarios indicate that Spaniards could lose around
3,602 euros per year in terms of lower GDP per capita26, 27, 28, 29, 30. In other words, the
most plausible forecasts for the coming months suggest there will be sharp falls in GDP
and increases in public deficit as needs grow. These same consequences can be extended
to the rest of the world9, 31, where countries will be faced with a trade-off between health
and economy that must be resolved through the lockdown de-escalation strategy.
The work presented here offers a method for structuring this decision for a lockdown deescalation strategy in the countries affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. To do so, we
define a Sequential Selective Multidimensional Decisioning (SSMD) process based on
four dimensions (geographical area, sector of activity, age, and immunity) ordered
sequentially. In each of these dimensions, a decision is made as to which workers may
return to work, considering the epidemiological characteristics of the country, in our case
Spain, and of the reference group of European countries with low levels of lockdown.
Once the strategy has been defined, we quantitatively calculate the incidence of the
lockdown exit strategy for Spain, based on affiliation to the social security system prior
to the pandemic.

Who can go back to work when the COVID-19 pandemic remits?
Version 1.0 – May 3, 2020

Specifically, we conclude that a lockdown de-escalation process involving 98.55% of
those affiliated to the social security system in Spain at the end of February 2020 is
feasible without putting at risk in the workplace the population most likely to be affected
by COVID-19. This is, however, conditional upon ensuring safety, health and social
distancing in those workplaces, guaranteeing that the number of tests carried out is
increased and that an adequate traceability of the network of contacts of cases that do test
positive for COVID-19 is established.
Finally, another fundamental contribution of this work is that the SSMD also makes it
possible to determine the working population targeted by the serological IgG antibody
tests and to evaluate the economic measures needed to replace the income of those
affected.

Version 1.0 – May 3, 2020

Appendix 1
Notes about the situation in Spain.
A.- Lockdown
In Spain, one of the countries most severely affected by the pandemic, a strict lockdown
has been imposed in economic terms. It has been applied nationwide by establishing three
types of activities: essential activities (not affected by lockdown), prohibited activities,
and activities not included in either of the other categories (Royal Decree 463/2020,
March 14). When the virus was at its most propagative, this latter group of activities was
also brought to a standstill for two weeks by establishing compulsory paid rest period for
workers, between March 30 and April 9, which would then involve the hours lost being
recovered later in the year (Royal Decree-law 10/2020, March 29).
The economic activities forbidden were all of those involving social contact with people
and have mainly affected the following sectors: hotel and catering, commerce, leisure,
culture, sport (Royal Decree 463/2020, March 14 (art. 10)). Later, tourism, international
passenger transport and accommodation were also added (Order SND/257/2020, March
19). In addition, face-to-face teaching was immediately prohibited although teaching did
continue because the government imposed teleworking on teachers and other education
staff (Royal Decree 463/2020, March 14 (art. 9)). These measures have been accompanied
by unemployment benefits and subsidies to individuals and companies in order to
partially compensate for the reduction or loss of income. Loans, public guarantees and
deferred payment obligations, including tax obligations, have also been implemented in
order to reduce cash flow stress (Royal Decree-law 8/2020, March 17 and Royal Decreelaw 15/2020, April 21).
In the labour field, the government did not initially prohibit dismissal, which resulted in
the dismissal of many casual workers. Finally, it was prohibited under Royal Decree-law
9/2020, March 27. As an alternative, the government facilitated the implementation of
collective dismissals on a temporary basis – furloughing - (Spanish acronym - ERTE) and
established economic compensation for self-employed workers (appendix of Royal
Decree 463/2020 and Royal Decree-law 11/2020, March 31).
B.- Lockdown exit strategy
The following is a brief description of the lockdown exit procedure established by the
Spanish government32. As we can see, it fails to specify the number of workers who will
be allowed to return to work, which is the problem we aim to address in this document.
Health criteria for the lockdown de-escalation strategy
At the end of April, at the time of writing this paper, the Spanish government began to
define the health criteria and markers for the lockdown de-escalation strategy to be
applied throughout May, for a progressive, gradual and asymmetric exit from lockdown.
There would basically be four markers out of the 27 requirements proposed: infection rate
per each infected person, accumulated incidence of cases, hospital rate, and percentage
of ICU occupancy. The technical proposal (Centre for Coordination of Health Alerts and
Emergencies –CCAES, 2020) is that the lockdown exit strategy and the gradual return to
a new normality should be slow and complex and should begin when:
-

An area has had an infection rate of less than 1 (basic reproduction number R0)
for at least two weeks. This marker indicates that each patient has infected less
than one other person. According to data, in Spain the average at this precise
Luis Ángel Hierro - David Cantarero - David Patiño - Daniel Arenaza

21

Who can go back to work when the COVID-19 pandemic remits?
Version 1.0 – May 3, 2020

moment is exactly one. So far, there are fourteen regions below this indicator,
with Murcia, Extremadura, La Rioja and Asturias being the best placed.
-

The incidence of new cases per day is 2 per 100,000 inhabitants: that is, about
1,000 new cases every day. The issue is that now over 4,000 cases are reported
although both new and old cases are being included; i.e. people who test positive
but who have already overcome the disease. With the latest data offered, the
Balearic Islands, the Canary Islands, and Murcia would meet the requirements,
while Andalusia, Extremadura, and Asturias would be close to doing so.

-

The area must have sufficient health care capacity available, should there be a
fresh outbreak or second wave (as happened a century ago with the Spanish flu of
1918) in order to avoid pushing health care capacity to the limit. The procedure
establishes two criteria: the occupation of beds in ICUs for coronavirus patients
should be less than 50% and the hospitalization rate of this type of patient should
be reduced to 30%. As regards these criteria, not all regions are counting daily
admissions but are reporting the accumulated total instead. Although we do not
have data from both indices, several regions have ICUs vacated above 50%, and
there are many that are close to meeting the maximum hospitalization rate of 30%
of patients with coronavirus.

Another aspect to consider is that hospitals must have the means to maintain a dual entry
circuit in health centres so as to prevent the spread of the virus and must have the capacity
to perform PCR tests on all patients admitted to hospitals. As regards primary care, health
centre capacity to detect COVID-19 cases early must be guaranteed and they must have
the capacity to isolate any cases that arise, as well as monitor contacts epidemiologically.
To this end, there must be specific centres to care for patients with suspected COVID-19
symptoms. In addition, basic protective measures such as maintaining safe distances,
frequent hand-washing and the use of face masks should be fostered.
Social, economic and temporal criteria for the lockdown de-escalation strategy
On April 28, 2020 the Spanish government approved the national plan to progressively
put an end to the lockdown measures in the following months. This plan "for a transition
to the new normality" is based on four different temporary phases, each of which lasts
approximately two weeks. In addition, the implementation of each phase will be based on
the specific situation of each province, i.e. the plan has a geographical dimension.
This forecast is indicative rather than exhaustive. The decisions and specific dates on the
effective lifting of the limitations established during the state of emergency will be
determined by the corresponding legal instruments. The common regime applicable to all
measures may also be adapted, depending on the evolution of the pandemic or other
justified circumstances.
Geographical asymmetry does not mean that lockdown de-escalation will be full-scale by
areas. Rather, what it does is to classify areas according to health criteria and, taking into
account this situation, areas will evolve with a selective gradual lockdown de-escalation
strategy by sectors of activity:
-

PHASE 0 (May 4, 2020): opening of small shops and businesses by appointment
for individual attention. For example, restaurants will offer a food delivery
service. There will be individual training for federated athletes and professional
leagues. There will also be signage of public places in order to ensure social
distancing is maintained. Bathroom facilities must provide maximum protection.

Who can go back to work when the COVID-19 pandemic remits?
Version 1.0 – May 3, 2020

Face masks will become compulsory on public transport. There will be no
interprovincial mobility.
-

PHASE 1 (May 11, 2020): possibility of moving within the same province.
Activities will begin in small shops "under strict safety conditions ", but not in
large stores "where crowds are more likely". Street cafés and terraces will be
allowed to open at 30% of their capacity, without any inflow of customers inside
the premises. Opening of hotels and other tourist accommodation, excluding
common areas and with a preferential schedule for people over 65 years of age.
Agri-food and fishing activities that had been stopped under the decree issuing the
state of emergency will resume. Places of worship can open but are limited to one
third of their capacity. Professional athletes will have fewer restrictions, since
“normal training” will be authorized in professional leagues and in highperformance centres. Hygiene measures and reinforced protection. Face masks
will become compulsory on public transport.

-

PHASE 2 (approx. May 25, 2020): the inner areas of bars and restaurants will be
opened with a third of their capacity, provided there are “guarantees of separation
and only for table service”. The school year will start in September, but in this
phase, exceptions are established to reopen educational centres. They may open
for reinforcement activities, so as to ensure that children under the age of six can
go to the school if both parents must work on site. School will open for university
entrance examinations. Cinemas, theatres, concert halls, and other similar spaces
will reopen with "preassigned seats" and seating will be limited to one third of the
usual capacity. People will also be able to visit monuments and exhibition halls,
with the same restrictions on capacity. In addition, cultural shows such as concerts
can be held in closed spaces, with one third of the usual capacity. If they are
outdoors, up to 400 people will be allowed to congregate if they are seated. The
capacity of places of worship is limited to 50%, as opposed to the one third of the
previous phase. Hunting and sport fishing will resume. Face masks are
compulsory on public transport.

-

PHASE 3 (approx. June 8, 2020): general mobility will be made more flexible
and, although it is the least restrictive phase, the use of face masks on public
transport will remain compulsory, as in all previous phases. Shops: capacity will
be limited to 50%, with the requirement that there be a minimum distance of two
metres between people. Measures in the catering sector will be relaxed, although
strict measures regarding separation between the public will be maintained.

Any permitted activity must be carried out in conditions of safety, self-protection, and
ensuring social distancing. The use of masks outside the home is advisable and strongly
recommended when social distancing cannot be guaranteed. Likewise, the availability of
and access to hydroalcoholic solutions should be provided so as to allow for frequent
hand hygiene.
