Abstract: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is characterized by a high incidence of acute
respiratory failure. The underlying immunopathology of that failure and how it compares to other
causes of severe respiratory distress, such as influenza virus infection, are not fully understood.
Here we addressed this by developing a prospective observational cohort of COVID-19 and
influenza subjects with varying degrees of disease severity and assessing the quality and
magnitude of their immune responses at the cellular and protein level. Additionally, we
performed single-cell RNA transcriptional profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from
select subjects. The cohort consists of 79 COVID-19 subjects, 26 influenza subjects, and 15
control subjects, including 35 COVID-19 and 7 influenza subjects with acute respiratory failure.
While COVID-19 subjects exhibited largely equivalent or greater activated lymphocyte counts
compared to influenza subjects, they had fewer monocytes and lower surface HLA-class II
expression on monocytes compared to influenza subjects and controls. At least two distinct
immune profiles were observed by cytokine levels in severe COVID-19 patients: 3 of 71 patients
were characterized by extreme inflammation, with greater than or equal to ~50% of the 35
cytokines measured greater than 2 standard deviations from the mean level of other severe

patients (both influenza and COVID-19); the other immune profile, which characterized 68 of 71
subjects, had a mixed inflammatory signature, where 28 of 35 cytokines in COVID-19 patients
had lower mean cytokine levels, though not all were statistically significant. Only 2 cytokines
were higher in COVID-19 subjects compared to influenza subjects (IL-6 and IL-8). Influenza
and COVID-19 patients could be distinguished statistically based on cytokine module
expression, particularly after controlling for the significant effects of age on cytokine expression,
but again with lower levels of most cytokines in COVID-19 subjects. Further, high circulating
levels of IL-1RA and IL-6 were associated with increased odds of intubation in the combined
influenza and COVID-19 cohort [OR = 3.93 and 4.30, respectively] as well as among only
COVID-19 patients. Single cell transcriptional profiling of COVID-19 and influenza subjects
with respiratory failure identified profound suppression in type I and type II interferon signaling
in COVID-19 patients across multiple clusters. In contrast, COVID-19 cell clusters were
enriched for alterations in metabolic, stress, and apoptotic pathways. These alterations were
consistent with an increased glucocorticoid response in COVID-19 patients compared to
influenza. When considered across the spectrum of innate and adaptive immune profiles, the
immune pathologies underlying severe influenza and COVID-19 are substantially distinct. The
majority of COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure do not have a cytokine storm
phenotype but instead exhibit profound type I and type II IFN immunosuppression when
compared to patients with acute influenza. Upregulation of a small number of inflammatory
mediators, including IL-6, predicts acute respiratory failure in both COVID-19 and influenza
patients.
Introduction
Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Acute respiratory failure occurs in a subset of COVID19 patients.(1-3) Respiratory failure has occurred in as many as 8% of individuals testing
positive for infection in the Lombardy region of Italy.(4) Understanding the etiology of
respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients is critical for determining the best management
strategies and pharmacologic targets for treatment. Current management of acute respiratory
failure in COVID-19 consists of optimized supportive care,(5, 6) primarily through oxygen
administration and consideration of endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation in the
appropriate context.(7)
Cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) is increasingly proposed as underlying the etiology of
respiratory failure in patients with COVID-19.(8) This model suggests that respiratory failure is
related to significant pro-inflammatory cytokine expression that leads to inflammatory cell
recruitment and tissue damage in the lung. Most of the data supporting this hypothesis in
COVID-19 comes from an early paper that observed high levels of the cytokines IL-2, IL-7, IL10, GCSF, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1α and TNFα in a small cohort of COVID-19 patients cared for
in the ICU. The level of these cytokines was increased in the ICU patients compared with a
group of COVID-19 patients that did not require care in the ICU.(3)
There has been significant interest in modulating the systemic immune response in an
effort to prevent or treat respiratory failure in patients with COVID-19.(2, 9-11) More than one
hundred clinical trials are currently registered at clinicaltrials.gov to evaluate the efficacy of
inflammatory cytokine blocking medications or interventions such as cytokine filtration as
potential treatments for respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients. A thorough understanding of

the underlying inflammatory environment in COVID-19 patients is required to successfully
interpret the findings of these studies.
Acute respiratory failure in influenza patients has also been attributed to significantly
increased inflammation and CSS.(12-14) In order to evaluate the etiology of respiratory failure in
COVID-19 patients, we undertook a comparative investigation of inflammatory responses in a
cohort of influenza patients with severe illness collected during 2019 and 2020, which allowed
us to characterize the immune response in patients with severe COVID-19 specifically in the
context of the more widely studied immune responses seen during influenza disease.
Results
Demographic and Clinical Characteristics
We enrolled a total of 79 symptomatic subjects who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2
RNA using an FDA-approved clinical PCR test. Our comparison cohort consisted of 26
symptomatic influenza subjects recruited during the 15 months immediately preceding the
outbreak of COVID-19 in the Saint Louis region. All tested positive for influenza A or B via a
clinical PCR test obtained during their clinical care. COVID-19 subjects were significantly older
than both influenza and control subjects, and significantly more COVID-19 patients required
hospitalization (Table 1). A higher number of COVID-19 subjects required ICU admission and
mechanical ventilation than influenza subjects, but this was not significantly different. Twentyseven percent of the COVID-19 subjects died during their hospitalization, compared with 8% of
influenza subjects enrolled. Less than 5% of the combined COVID-19 and influenza cohort were
immunocompromised. Many subjects in both cohorts exhibited co-morbidities that increased
their risk for severe disease, including diabetes and chronic lung disease; however, there were no
significant differences between the COVID-19 and influenza subjects in any measured comorbidity (Table 1).
Evaluation of Circulating Immune Cells
We initially characterized circulating immune cells by quantifying the absolute number
+
of CD4 and CD8+ T lymphocytes and CD19+ B cells. COVID-19 and influenza subjects both
exhibited universally reduced populations of these three cell subsets, which generally constitute
the majority of circulating PBMCs in healthy controls (Fig 1A, Supplemental Fig 1A). In
contrast, COVID-19 subjects had significantly more circulating early antibody-secreting B cell
plasmablasts than influenza subjects or controls (Fig 1B). Circulating activated CD8 T cells were
equivalent across all groups, but circulating activated CD4 T cells were significantly lower in
influenza compared healthy controls (Fig 1B). However, when compared with either influenza or
control subjects, COVID-19 subjects exhibited significantly reduced numbers of circulating
monocytes, including all three common classifications of human monocytes (classical,
intermediate, and non-classical; Fig 1C, Supplemental Fig 1B). In line with previous
observations(15), intermediate monocytes were elevated during acute influenza in comparison to
healthy controls.
Given the pronounced variation in monocyte abundance across patient conditions, we
also measured major histocompatibility complex class II expression on the surface of monocytes
to gauge monocyte activation. We noted that COVID-19 subjects had significantly reduced
abundances of HLA-DR on the surface of all three subsets of monocytes when compared with
either controls or influenza subjects (Fig 1D). There was no significant difference in the cell-

surface expression of HLA-DR on B cells or CD8 T cells, but COVID-19 subjects exhibited
significantly less HLA-DR expression on CD4 T cells compared to influenza subjects
(Supplemental Fig 1C).
Cytokine associations with disease and outcome
Plasma cytokine levels were measured from 27 patients with confirmed influenza virus
infection, 79 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and 8 healthy controls. Among the SARSCoV-2 patients, two response profiles were immediately apparent. Three of 79 patient samples
had extremely high concentrations, defined as > 2 standard deviations from the mean, for more
than 17 of the 35 cytokines measured (range: 49%-89%), characteristic of a classic cytokine
storm (see outliers, Supplemental Fig 2). Standard deviations from the mean ranged from 2 up to
10.5 among these subjects, with outlier values ranging from 0.8 to 2 orders of magnitude higher
than the mean for each of the measured cytokines. We excluded these 3 patients from subsequent
comparative analyses.
The dominant response profile among COVID-19 patients consisted of more selective
cytokine upregulation, with a bias towards lower inflammation when compared to influenza
patients (Fig 2A). Among all subjects, we found that for 28 of 35 cytokines, COVID-19 patients
had lower mean cytokine levels, though not all were statistically significant (Supplemental Fig
3). Among the statistically significant reduced cytokines were GM-CSF (padj=0.0499), IFN-γ
(padj=0.038), and IL-9 (padj=0.026, Figure 2B). In contrast, only IL-6 (padj=0.086) and IL-8
(padj=0.01) were near significantly or significantly elevated in the total COVID-19 group
compared to all influenza patients (Figure 2B). Cytokines upregulated similarly in COVID-19
and influenza during infection included chemokines (IP10, MIP1β, MCP1, MIG) and
immunomodulatory cytokines (HGF and IL1-Ra, Supplemental Fig 3). These data indicated that
the majority of COVID-19 patients did not have as profound an inflammatory phenotype as
influenza patients, with certain targeted exceptions.
We and others have previously shown that cytokine levels are often correlated within a
subject based on demographic and environmental factors (e.g., age, prior herpesvirus
exposure)(16). This can obscure variation in cytokine expression patterns within individuals.
Further, the relatively high dimensionality of cytokine data can make it difficult to detect
statistically significant associations due to high false discovery rates. Additionally, the distinct
distributions in our cohorts between severe and mild patients complicate simple overall
comparisons. To address this, we utilized a data-driven modular informatics approach(17) to
identify clusters of co-regulated cytokines across all subjects, to normalize cytokine expression
within subjects, and to identify differences in expression across conditions while adjusting for
the effects of age and days after symptom onset for sampling. These analyses allowed us to
detect a number of co-correlating cytokines across COVID-19 and influenza samples, which we
grouped into distinct co-expression modules using hierarchical clustering (Supplementary Figure
4). Of particular interest were Modules 1 and 2, which included GCSF, IFN-γ, and IL1-β
(MOD1) and Eotaxin, HGF, IL1-Ra, IL-2R, IL-6, IL-8, IP10, MCP1, MIG, and VEGF (MOD2),
respectively. Upon constructing logistic models to assess associations between these cytokines
and a binary infection status (COVID-19 vs. influenza), we observed that lower levels of both
MOD1 and MOD2, as well as a number of their constituent cytokines, were significantly
associated with an increased risk of being COVID-19 positive (Fig 2A). This was particularly
surprising given that IL-6 and IL-8 are frequently associated with severe COVID-19 infection
and were upregulated in COVID-19 compared to influenza subjects in the present study.

However, the modular analysis considers all of the cytokines within a module, as opposed to
individual cytokine associations, and MOD2 contains several other cytokines; indeed, neither IL6 nor IL-8 alone were significantly associated with being COVID-19 positive. Furthermore, the
logistic model specifically regresses out potentially confounding covariates that are otherwise
obscured by simple univariate analysis. These results suggest that overall higher inflammation is
foremost predictive of influenza infection and that a defining feature of COVID-19 disease is
generally reduced inflammation compared to influenza as measured by a number of related
cytokines. Thus, influenza infection was associated with generally higher levels of inflammation,
and when influenza subjects exhibited high expression in one MOD2 cytokine, they were likely
to exhibit high expression across the board. In contrast, COVID-19 subjects were not
characterized by overall high levels of cytokines, but rather exhibited a selective pattern of
inflammation, in which only a subset of inflammatory cytokines are upregulated.
Using this analytical framework further, we next inquired whether particular cytokine
expression patterns were associated with poor clinical outcomes. In considering all infected
subjects, higher levels of Modules 1 and 2 were significantly associated with severe disease,
which we defined as resulting in either intubation or death. Associations between disease
severity and IL1-RA and IL-6 were particularly strong, with high levels of these analytes
predictive of poor outcomes (OR = 3.93 and 4.30, respectively; Fig 2C). Importantly, this
association remained when we repeated the analysis on COVID-19 subjects alone
(Supplementary Figure 5), demonstrating that exacerbation of these specific inflammatory
pathways in COVID-19 in the sickest patients.
Because these earlier analyses included severity as an outcome within a population of
patients with diverse disease presentations, we also tested the robustness of our observations
specifically in hospitalized patients from both groups. Once again, the striking pattern that
emerged was lower levels of multiple cytokines and modules among hospitalized COVID-19
patients compared to hospitalized influenza patients. These included GCSF (padj=0.048), MIG
(padj=0.011), and IL-2R (padj=0.024), and spanned three distinct cytokine modules. Taken
together, COVID-19 is characterized by high levels of specific cytokines (IL-6, IL-8) when
compared to influenza, but the majority of inflammatory mediators are significantly lower, even
among severe patients (Fig 2C-D), especially after accounting for the frequently significant
effect of patient age on cytokine abundance.
Single Cell Transcriptional Profiles of Subjects with Respiratory Failure Reveals
Immunosuppression within Monocytes and Increased Glucocorticoid Response in COVID-19
Subjects
Immune suppression can often occur as a negative feedback from immune activation, so
we sought further resolution of the immune state of severe COVID-19 patients to understand the
dominant regulatory signals determining their trajectory. A total of 29,634 cells from seven
subjects (three COVID-19, three influenza, and one healthy control) were obtained for single cell
gene expression analyses after standard processing and filtering. Using an integration-based
approach that leverages convergent expression signals across samples (see Methods), we
identified 22 putative transcriptional clusters that we were able to categorize into major cell
subsets, including monocytes and macrophages (7 transcriptional clusters, including CD16+ and
CD16- monocytes), CD8+ T cells (5 clusters), CD4+ T cells (3 clusters), B cells (2 clusters),
regulatory T cells (Tregs), mixed cytolytic lymphocyte populations (MCLPs; e.g., NK and NKT
cells ), plasmablasts, mast cells, and three other subsets that we putatively identified as

plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs), platelets, and cell doublets composed in part of platelets.
We then interrogated each of these major groups and their constituent transcriptional clusters for
variation in both relative abundance and gene expression owed to differences in condition (i.e.,
COVID-19-infected, influenza-infected, or healthy control). Although representation of cells
within the clusters were influenced by their abundance in individual patients (Supplementary
Figure 6), the models we leveraged to compare across conditions are robust to such differences,
emphasizing transcriptional variation between conditions among similar subsets.
To broadly survey transcriptional variation as a function of infection status in an unbiased
manner, we ranked gene expression differences between COVID-19-infected and influenzainfected patients for each subset and tested for enrichment of Hallmark gene sets as a function of
these diagnoses. Surprisingly, a number of important immunological pathways were significantly
enriched specifically among cells from Influenza patients across a number of subsets: compared
to the Influenza condition, both IFN-γ and IFN-α response pathways were significantly
downregulated within the COVID-19 condition for B cells, CD8+ T cells, MCLPs, Tregs, PDCs,
and monocyte/macrophage subsets (Fig 3E; Supplementary Figure 7). More exhaustive analysis
using gene ontology pathways related to interferon production, secretion, response, and
regulation demonstrated that these patterns extended to IFN-β and general Type I interferon
pathways across most subsets, but particularly among monocytes (Supplementary Figure 8).
These patterns were concordant with substantial enrichment of inflammatory pathways in
Influenza cells compared to COVID-19 cells across a majority of cell subsets. In contrast,
COVID-19 cells were significantly enriched for a number of pathways involved in cellular
metabolism and proliferation in comparison to Influenza cells across most subsets
(Supplementary Figure 7).
Given the substantial downregulation of HLA-DR among COVID-19 monocytes
observed during flow cytometry analysis, we decided to further investigate potential
transcriptional differences between COVID-19 and Influenza specifically within our
transcriptionally defined monocyte/macrophage subset and clusters. As expected given the flow
cytometry analysis carried out on these same patients, the proportion of cells in
monocyte/macrophage subsets were substantially smaller in COVID-19 compared to both
healthy and influenza subjects (Supplementary Figure 9). We furthermore noted significant
decreases in a number of interferon-induced genes known to play important roles in the innate
immune response to viral insults (Fig 3D). This evidence of decreased, or perhaps dysregulated,
interferon expression and a relative dearth of expression corresponding to inflammatory
processes were accompanied by a significant enrichment of a number of stress and corticoid
response pathways in COVID-19 cells across most subsets, but particularly within
monocytes/macrophages (Fig 3E; Supplementary Figure 10).
Discussion
Understanding the complexities of the systemic inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2
infection is critical to determining the most appropriate treatment for this condition. We have
demonstrated that the immunophenotype of COVID-19 and influenza patients vary widely. Two
forms of COVID-19 immune dysregulation were observed: a cytokine storm phenotype in a
small proportion of patients (3 of 79) and a far more common phenotype characterized by
targeted immunosuppression. The signatures of this common COVID-19 phenotype were highly
elevated IL-6 and IL-8, paired with lower levels (compared to severe influenza) of cytokines in
many other pathways and essentially the absence of any Type I or Type II IFN response. The

suppression in Type I IFN signaling has been noted by others in humans and animal models of
COVID-19 infections(18, 19). At the cellular level, dramatic reductions in overall cellularity and
particularly in the monocyte compartment were observed, with phenotypic and transcriptional
evidence (Class II downregulation) that monocytes were less activated. While lymphocyte
numbers (except for plasmablasts) were reduced in both infected groups compared to healthy
controls, several lymphocyte subsets had functional signatures of suppression in COVID-19
patients, including type I and II IFN signaling. IFN-γ production is critical for effector type I
responses, and its absence may limit antiviral activity. The elevated plasmablast frequencies in
COVID-19 patients may reflect the abundance of viral antigens, which is consistent with the
reported persistence of viral RNA in nasal swabs for up to 15 days after onset of symptoms(20).
The single cell analyses also identified enrichment of several pathways in COVID-19
patients associated with metabolic stress and the general stress response. These results, combined
with the targeted, severe suppression of specific pathways and dramatic leuko- and lymphopenia
led us to consider what pathways might account for this response profile. Previous studies in
animal models had implicated glucocorticoid (GC) signaling in the immunosuppression and
lymphopenia that occurs in the influenza model in mice.(21) In humans, systemic inflammation,
and hydrocortisone specifically, are known to suppress HLA-DR expression on monocytes.(22)
Excessive GC production is an attractive hypothesis to account for the observed immune
dysregulation and disease manifestations in COVID-19. First, the high levels of IL-6
production—one of the two cytokines that were higher in COVID-19 than in severe influenza—
can directly drive excessive cortisol production through multiple mechanisms, including through
the direct induction of corticotropin-releasing hormone and adrenocorticotropin. IL-6 can also
act directly on the adrenal cortex to stimulate GC release.(23) While GCs are generally
immunosuppressive, which is why they are often considered therapeutically, their effects are
uneven across the cytokine landscape, with cortisol failing to suppress IL-6(24), or even
inducing IL-6 and IL-8 in one report.(25) Notably, in this study there were differences in
cortisol’s effects between male and female cells, with more pro-inflammatory effects observed in
males; male sex has been noted as a consistent risk factor in COVID-19.(26) A recent
retrospective cohort study from Germany has also reported increased cortisol levels in a majority
of COVID-19 patients.(27)
Another potential source of cortisol production unique to SARS-CoV-2 infection is
through its modulation of ACE2 levels. ACE2 is the receptor for virus entry, and while it is still
unclear the extent to which its levels are modulated by infection, experience from SARS-CoV-1
and other data suggest that ACE2 expression or activity are lowered. This directly affects the
renin-angiotensin system, enhancing ACE activity and resulting in a shift towards angiotensin II
(Ang II) production and away from angiotensin 1-7. Ang II enhances Il-6 and cortisol
production, while Ang 1-7 suppresses them.(28, 29)
Beyond considering the potential impacts of increased GC production on the
development of the immunosuppressed phenotype we characterized in the vast majority of
COVID-19 patients in this study, we must also consider the possibility that GCs modulate the
immune microenvironment differently in the context of distinct viral encounters. There are
known but underappreciated immunosuppressive features of influenza (30-32); coronaviruses are
similarly known to utilize a number of nonstructural proteins to disrupt host gene expression and
protein synthesis (33, 34), with the potential for profound impacts on various immune signaling
pathways (35). Although the details of these mechanisms in the context of COVID-19 immune
dysregulation remain to be fully elucidated, our own analyses demonstrate enhanced GC

signaling in cells from COVID-19 patients, consistent with an enhanced production of GCs or
enhanced sensitivity to GCs after infection. Together these data suggest a feedforward
amplification of IL-6 and GC signaling, paired with a profound suppression of other potentially
protective immune functions through GC-induced apoptosis and suppression of key antiviral
pathways. GCs can also drive other pathological phenotypes including clotting dysfunction,
consistent with severe manifestations of COVID-19.(36) The direct and indirect effects of
SARS-CoV-2’s unique biology may determine this pathological outcome. Therapeutic
consideration should be given to inhibiting both IL-6 and GC activity in the majority of COVID19 patients exhibiting this phenotype (high IL-6, low IFN signaling, profound cytopenias) versus
the small proportion of patients with a true cytokine storm phenotype. While inhibiting GC
activity alone may cause excessive inflammation, co-administration with IL-6-blocking
antibodies in a dose regulated manner may limit these effects. These data also indicate that
administration of GCs would potentially be deleterious, an outcome consistent with some limited
reports.(37) Other studies have indicated beneficial or neutral effects from GC, and indicate a
focus on understanding their dynamics and activity across the course of infection is an important
direction for future research.(38, 39)
Materials and Methods
Study Design
This is a prospective observational cohort of subjects with viral respiratory illness
symptoms who presented to Barnes Jewish Hospital, St. Louis Children’s Hospital, Missouri
Baptist Medical Center or affiliated Barnes Jewish Hospital testing sites located in Saint Louis,
Missouri, USA. Inclusion criteria required that subjects were symptomatic and had a physicianordered SARS-CoV-2 test performed in the course of their normal clinical care. Some subjects
were enrolled prior to the return of the SARS-CoV-2 test result. Enrolled subjects who tested
negative for SARS-CoV-2 are not included in the current manuscript. This report includes the
first subjects enrolled in the study; however, study recruitment is ongoing. All samples were
collected at the time of enrollment, which was during or immediately following evaluation in a
medical facility. Patient-reported duration of illness and other clinically relevant medical
information was collected at the time of enrollment from the subject, their legally authorized
representative, or the medical record. The portions of the study relevant to each institution were
reviewed and approved by the Washington University in Saint Louis Institutional Review Board
(WU-350 study approval # 202003085) and the Missouri Baptist Medical Center Institutional
Review Board (Approval # 1132). The study complied with the ethical standards of the Helsinki
Declaration.
We also report findings from healthy control subjects and influenza-infected subjects
enrolled in separate, ongoing studies. Control subjects had not experienced symptoms of a viral
respiratory illness at the time of sample collection or within the previous 90 days, and samples
were all collected before October of 2019. Influenza subjects were enrolled in the ongoing
EDFLU study.(15) All influenza subjects were sampled in 2019 and 2020. We enrolled most
influenza subjects during the course of the 2019-2020 influenza season, immediately before the
spread of COVID-19 disease in the Saint Louis region. The last included influenza subject was
enrolled and sampled on March 2rd of 2020. The first case of COVID-19 was reported in Saint
Louis on March 8th of 2020 in a returning traveler. The control and influenza studies were

Multi-Parameter Flow Cytometry
Absolute counts of CD45+ cells in whole blood were determined at the time of blood
collection on fresh samples by flow cytometry with Precision Count Beads (BioLegend).
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), prepared using ficoll separation, were analyzed
using a panel of antibodies directed against the following antigens: CD8 BV421 (clone RPA-T8),
CD20 Pacific Blue (clone 2H7), CD16 BV570 (clone 3G8), HLA-DR BV605 (clone L243), IgD
SuperBright 702 (clone IA6-2), CD19 BV750 (clone HIB19), CD45 Alexa Fluor 532 (clone
HI30), CD71 PE (clone CY1G4), CD38 PE-Cy7 (clone HIT2), CD14 APC (clone M5E2), CD4
Spark 685 (clone SK3), and CD3 Alexa 700 (clone UCHT1). PBMC samples of 0.5-2x106 cells
were stained with a master-mix containing pre-titrated concentrations of the antibodies, along
with BD Brilliant Buffer (BD Biosciences) and Zombie NIR Fixable Viability Marker
(BioLegend) to differentiate live and dead cells. Samples were run on a Cytek Aurora spectral
flow cytometer using SpectroFlo software (Cytek) and unmixed before final analysis was
completed using FlowJo software (BD Biosciences).
Cytokine Quantification
Plasma obtained from subjects was frozen at -80°C and subsequently analyzed using a
human magnetic cytokine panel providing parallel measurement of 35 cytokines (ThermoFisher).
The assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions with each subject sample
performed in duplicate and then analyzed on a Luminex FLEXMAP 3D instrument.
Single-Cell RNAseq
PBMCs were suspended at 1000 cells/µL and approximately 17,400 cells were input to a
10x Genomics Chromium instrument. Each sample was used for two independent reactions, with
all first reactions processed on one chip and second reactions processed on a second chip. Singlecell gene expression libraries were prepared using 5-prime (V2) kits and sequenced on the
Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform at 151x151bp. Individual libraries were processed using
CellRanger (v3.1.0; 10xGenomics) with the accompanying human reference (GRCh38-3.0.0),
which was modified to include the influenza A, influenza B, and COVID-19 (NC_045512.2)
genomes. Processed libraries were subsequently aggregated using CellRanger, randomly
subsampling mapped reads to equalize sequencing depth across cells. Filtered aggregation
matrices were subsequently analyzed using Seurat(40) (v3.1.4), excluding cells from
downstream analyses that exhibited extremes in the total number of transcripts expressed, the
total number of genes expressed, or mitochondrial gene expression. For each cell we inferred cell
cycle phase using markers from Tirosh et al 2016(41) and incorporated module scores from a
number of external gene sets in the same manner.
After filtering, we first sought to characterize putative cell subsets shared across
conditions by detecting integration anchors among the samples, effectively minimizing
condition-associated differences. The top 2,000 variable genes were identified for each library
using the “vst” method, and integration anchors were obtained using canonical correlation
analysis (CCA). Data were integrated using 50 CCA dimensions and scaled to regress out the
effects of total transcript count, percent of mitochondrial gene expression, and module scores
associated with cell phase. Principal components (PC) were calculated and assessed for statistical
significance using random permutation. The first 51 PCs (p < 0.01) were used to identify

transcriptional clusters and for tSNE and UMAP dimensionality reduction. After identifying
clusters on the basis of transcriptional similarities across cells from all three conditions (i.e., the
“integrated” analysis), we performed pairwise differential gene expression analysis between
conditions using Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests as implemented in Seurat, with default parameters.
We also generated an additional UMAP projection using the top 2,000 variable genes across the
entire dataset (excluding TCR and IG genes, which are known to map poorly) irrespective of the
CCA but again using significant PCs; this allowed us visualize cells in a manner that did not
obscure transcriptional differences owed to sample or condition but with previously identified
cell subsets and transcriptional clusters from the integration analysis overlaid. We also looked
within identified subsets and clusters for explicit differences in gene pathway enrichment
between cells from COVID-19-infected and influenza-infected patients, COVID-19-infected and
healthy patients, and influenza-infected and healthy patients. For these analyses, gene expression
differences between conditions were ranked for individual subsets and transcriptional clusters by
calculating differential expression under a generalized linear hurdle model(42). To generate gene
ranks, gene-specific average log fold changes were multiplied by the absolute difference in the
proportions of cells expressing the gene (+1e-4 as a lower boundary) and the inverse of the FDRadjusted p-values, which were re-scaled from 1e-7 to 1 to institute reasonable bounds in the
ranking. These ranks were used as inputs for gene set enrichment analysis(43) using
GSEAPreranked with a classic enrichment statistic and chip-based gene collapsing based on the
Human_Symbol_with_Remapping_MSigDB.v.7.0 chip(44). Gene sets were considered
significantly enriched if they resulted in a nominal p-value < 0.05 and a q-value < 0.20.

Analysis
Flow Cytometry
Lymphocyte subsets were compared across healthy, influenza, and SARS-CoV-2 subjects using
Mann-Whitney U tests. In the HLA-DR expression analysis, there were four negative mean
fluorescence intensity observations, these were replaced with a value of 1. Results were adjusted
for multiple comparisons using the Benjamin-Hochberg approach and considered significant if
the adjusted p-value was less than 0.05 (FDR < 0.05).
Cytokines
Cytokine levels were natural safe-log transformed prior to analysis and compared across healthy,
influenza, and SARS-CoV-2 subjects using Kruskal-Wallis tests. Results were adjusted for
multiple comparisons using the Benjamini–Hochberg approach. Kruskall-Wallis tests with an
FDR-adjusted p-value < 0.10 were selected for further investigation, and were followed up with
post hoc Dunn’s tests to determine which groups differ from each other. P-values obtained from
Dunn’s tests were subjected to multiple testing adjustment and considered statistically significant
a FDR < 0.05.
Cytokine-cytokine co-correlations were investigated using CytoMod(17) utilizing both absolute
and mean-adjusted (i.e., relative) cytokine values of either all COVID-19 and influenza data,
using only using COVID-19 data, or only using data from hospitalized subjects of either cohort.
For these correlations, values below the lower limit of detection were set to the lower limit of

detection, and values above the upper limit of detection were excluded. In each instance we
tested up to k = 12 modules and used gap statistic to identify the optimal k. Logistic regressions
were carried out within the CytoMod framework and controlled for effects of age and the
number of days after symptom onset that a sample was collected. P-values were adjusted for
multiple testing as above, and all significant results reported from logistic models were assessed
an FDR < 0.05.

Figure 2. Selective cytokine upregulation in COVID-19 patients. (A) To visualize cytokine
levels in COVID-19 patients relative to influenza patients, all cytokine levels were normalized to
the median cytokine level in influenza subjects, with respect to cytokine; thus,
the normalized median cytokine level in influenza patients equals 1 for all cytokines and is
represented by the vertical blue line. Bar graphs, and the numbers on them, represent the value of
the normalized median COVID-19 cytokine level relative to the normalized median influenza
cytokine level for a given cytokine. Bars in light red represent cytokine levels lower in COVID19 patients relative to influenza patients (normalized median < 1, n = 28) and bars in dark red
are cytokines higher in COVID-19 patients relative to influenza patients (normalized median >
1, n = 7). (B) Box plots show cytokine concentrations in COVID-19, influenza, and healthy
subjects: Presented p-values are from post hoc Dunn’s tests, following adjustment for multiple
testing. (C) Forest plots depicting the odds ratios obtained from logistic regression analysis
between cytokines and COVID-19 infection (left) and severe disease (i.e., resulting in intubation
or death; right). Logistic regression models utilized absolute log10-transformed cytokine values
and included age and the number of days since symptom onset at sampling as covariates. Results
from each cytokine module are presented, as well as results from each constituent cytokine
Modules 1 and 2, which showed the most variation across tested outcomes; otherwise, cytokines
are only presented if they reached statistical significance in one of the logistic regression models.
Grey shading indicates the area of the plots where odds ratios are less than 1, which are
indicative of negative associations. Presented p-values correspond to the specific module or
cytokine and were adjusted for multiple testing. Odds ratios are indicated with points, and
confidence lines encompass the range between the lower and upper limits. Red points and
confidence lines indicate FDR-adjusted p-values < 0.05. For each model, † indicates that age was
a significant covariate, whereas ‡ indicates that day of sampling was statistically
significant. (D) Cytokine concentrations in hospitalized COVID-19 and influenza

transcriptionally as a function of condition despite the presence of nearly all subsets across the
various conditions, as evidenced in (C). Putative cell subset identities are denoted with (p). (D)
Violin plots demonstrate extreme downregulation of selected interferon-activated (OAS1) or
interferon-induced (IFIT3, MX1) genes among cells from COVID-19 patients (red) compared to
cells from influenza patients (blue). Asterisks indicate significance at FDR < 0.05. (E) In direct
comparison to cells from influenza-infected patients, transcriptional patterns among cells from
COVID-19 patients reveal significant upregulation (red bars) of metabolic pathways, stress
pathways, and glucocorticoid signaling pathways, particularly in monocytes/macrophages; in
contrast, interferon pathways were significantly downregulated (blue bars) among subsets from
COVID-19 patients. Grey bars indicate that tests for enrichment did not meet statistical
significance for a particular subset.

Supplementary Materials:
Supplementary Figure 1. Gating strategy for flow cytometry analysis of myeloid (A) and
lymphoid (B) subsets. (C) Expression of HLA-DR, measured by mean fluorescence intensity, on
B cells, CD8 T cells, and CD4 T cells.
Supplementary Figure 2. Overview of cytokine levels across all subjects, data points from the 3
COVID-19 patients with extremely high cytokine concentrations are shown in red.
Supplementary Figure 3. Box plots of cytokine concentrations in COVID-19, influenza, and
healthy subjects for each of the 35 cytokines measured. P-values presented are raw, unadjusted
Kruskal-Wallis tests or Mann-Whitney U tests.
Supplementary Figure 4. Correlations of absolute cytokine values are visualized after
hierarchical clustering (left), as well as the proportion of times cytokine pairs clustered together
during hierarchical clustering over 1,000 permutations (right) for: (A) all samples from COVID19- and influenza-infected patients, (B) only samples obtained from COVID-19-infected
patients, and (C) only samples obtained from hospitalized patients. Data from healthy patients
were not included in these analyses. Figures were produced using CytoMod.
Supplementary Figure 5. Modular analysis of cytokines as described in the manuscript were
repeated using only samples from COVID-19-infected patients. (A) Odds ratio heatmap from
logistic regression analysis testing for associations between cytokines/cytokine modules and
disease severity (as defined by presentation that resulted in intubation or death, “IntOrDec").
Only statistically significant odds ratios are visualized; all non-grey values correspond to
statistically significant results after multiple testing adjusted to ensure a false discovery rate
<0.05. Asterisks indicate an additional, more stringent Bonferroni multiple testing adjustment,
with *** corresponding to FWER (family-wise error rate) < 0.001 and ** corresponding to
FWER < 0.01. Odds ratios are presented in a color scales that spans from dark purple (OR =
1/2.5), corresponding to a negative association between cytokine expression and severity, to dark
brown (OR = 2.5), corresponding to a positive association between cytokine expression and
severity. Modules were defined by hierarchical clustering of cytokine-cytokine correlations (B).
(C) visualizes the proportion of times cytokine pairs clustered together during hierarchical
clustering over 1,000 permutations. Figures were produced using CytoMod.
Supplementary Figure 6. For each bioinformatically defined transcriptional cluster, the
percentage of cells from each single-cell gene expression library that were assigned to that
cluster is presented. Colors correspond to the patient from which the sample was obtained, with
each patient represented by two independent gene expression libraries constructed from distinct
cell aliquots from the same PBMC sample.
Supplementary Figure 7. Graphs depicting all results of Preranked Gene Set Enrichment
Analysis of Hallmark gene sets when comparing COVID-19-infected and influenza-infected
subjects on a per-cell-subset basis. Red: significantly enriched in cells from COVID-19-infected
patients; blue: significantly enriched in cells from influenza-infected patients; grey: not
statistically enriched in either condition.

Supplementary Figure 8. Graphs depicting selected results from Preranked Gene Set
Enrichment Analysis of Gene Ontology gene sets. Gene Ontology Biological Processes gene sets
that passed default GSEA thresholds were tested, with results adjusted for multiple testing, and
all results with the term “interferon” in the gene set name that were significant in either direction
for at least one cell subset are plotted. Red: significantly enriched in cells from COVID-19infected patients; blue: significantly enriched in cells from influenza-infected patients; grey: not
statistically enriched in either condition.
Supplementary Figure 9. For each transcriptionally identified cell subset, the percentage of
cells from each single-cell gene expression library that were assigned to that subset is presented.
Colors correspond to patient from which the sample was obtained, with each patient represented
by two independent gene expression libraries constructed from distinct cell aliquots from the
same PBMC sample.
Supplementary Figure 10. Graphs depicting selected results from Preranked Gene Set
Enrichment Analysis of Gene Ontology gene sets. Gene Ontology Biological Processes gene sets
that passed default GSEA thresholds were tested, with results adjusted for multiple testing, and
all results with the terms “cortico”, “cortisol”, or “stress” in the gene set name that were
significant in either direction for at least one cell subset are plotted. Red: significantly enriched
in cells from COVID-19-infected patients; blue: significantly enriched in cells from influenzainfected patients; grey: not statistically enriched in either condition.
