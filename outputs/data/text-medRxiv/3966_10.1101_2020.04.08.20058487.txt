A BSTRACT
Background: The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly spread across the globe and is poised
to cause millions of deaths worldwide. There are currently no proven pharmaceutical treatments,
and vaccines are likely over a year away. At present, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are
the only effective option to reduce transmission of the virus, but it is not clear how to deploy these
potentially expensive and disruptive measures. Modeling can be used to understand the potential
effectiveness of NPIs for both suppression and mitigation efforts.
Methods and Findings: We developed Corvid, an adaptation of the agent-based influenza model
called FluTE to SARS-CoV-2 transmission. To demonstrate features of the model relevant for
studying the effects of NPIs, we simulated transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in a synthetic population
representing a metropolitan area in the United States. Transmission in the model occurs in several
settings, including at home, at work, and in schools. We simulated several combinations of NPIs that
targeted transmission in these settings, such as school closures and work-from-home policies. We
also simulated three strategies for testing and isolating symptomatic cases. For our demonstration
parameters, we show that testing followed by home isolation of ascertained cases reduced transmission
by a modest amount. We also show how further reductions may follow by isolating cases in safe
facilities away from susceptible family members or by quarantining all family members to prevent
transmission from likely infections that have yet to manifest.
Conclusions: Models that explicitly include settings where individuals interact such as the home,
work, and school are useful for studying the effectiveness of NPIs, as these are more dependent on
community structure than pharmaceutical interventions such as vaccination. Corvid can be used to
help evaluate complex combinations of interventions, although there is no substitute for real-world
observations. Our results on NPI effectiveness summarize the behavior of the model for an assumed
set of parameters for demonstration purposes. Model results can be sensitive to the assumptions made
about disease transmission and the natural history of the disease, both of which are not yet sufficiently
characterized for SARS-CoV-2 for quantitative modeling. Models of SARS-CoV-2 transmission will
need to be updated as the pathogen becomes better-understood.

Modeling NPIs against SARS-CoV-2 with Corvid

A P REPRINT

1 Introduction
The United States has had nearly 400,000 tested or presumptive cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel
coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 [1]. At the time of writing, there are no approved pharmaceuticals to prevent or treat
cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, the only available option to slow or even stop the epidemic is to use
non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), including school closures, workplace closures, quarantine, and other “social
distancing” measures. The effectiveness of NPIs has been studied mostly in the context of seasonal and pandemic
influenza, but most of the evidence is based on modeling and simulation[2–4]. However, SARS-CoV-2 is not the same
as influenza. SARS-CoV-2 is more transmissible, has a longer incubation period, and may have more asymptomatic
transmission. Therefore, modeling will be a useful tool for evaluating the potential effectiveness of NPIs against
SARS-CoV-2 epidemics.
Here, we describe Corvid, an open-source model that simulates the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in a population. This model
explicitly includes transmission in age-appropriate settings, like schools, workplaces, and homes, which allows us to
study the potential impact of NPIs that target these settings. We used the model to demonstrate how these NPIs could
reduce overall infections by affecting transmission in different combinations of these settings.

2 Results
We ran simulations in a synthetic population that represents an American metropolitan area with a population of roughly
560,000 people. In an unmitigated outbreak starting with five infected people, 81% of the population became infected
when R0 =2.6.
2.1 Modeling layered NPIs
To demonstrate the features of the model, we simulated the effects of using NPIs to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
We first test the effectiveness of workplace-based policies then add additional “layers” of interventions that are enacted
at the same time [2]. We present the impact of these interventions in figures that plot the simulated number of new
symptomatic cases each day and the cumulative percentage of the population that has become symptomatic, and
compare simulations with no interventions to simulations where these policies are started on either day 30 (early) or
day 90 (later) of the epidemic. These simulations are meant to demonstrate features of the model and the qualitative
effects of NPIs–the intervention parameters were not set to reflect any specific real-world setting.
We simulated the workplace-based policies of liberal leave and work-from-home policies. For “liberal leave”, people
who normally go to work have an increased chance of staying home when feeling ill, beyond the normal tendency to
stay home when ill. For “work from home”, a fraction of the employed population stays home instead of going to work.
Both of these interventions can increase the amount of transmission that occurs within a family if other members of the
family are at home during the day, and among people who live near their homes, but it prevents workplace transmission
and the movement of the pathogen between home and work communities. In our examples, we set compliance for these
policies at 50%, so that 50% of workers who would not have stayed home because of illness would stay home one day
after symptom onset and 50% of all workers opt to work from home. When these policies are implemented on day 30
of the epidemic, the epidemic peak was reduced and delayed, and the final attack rate was reduced. This can be seen in
the blue curves in the top panels of Figure 1, which show the simulated number of new symptomatic cases each day and
the cumulative percentage of the population that became symptomatic. Enacting these policies later in the epidemic, on
day 90, reduced the final attack rate but did not delay the peak, as seen in the bottom panels of Figure 1.
As expected, the workplace policies greatly reduced the number of infections occurring in workplaces and slightly
increased the number occurring in the home. Figure 2 shows the number of infections that take place in the model in
the home, at school, in workplaces, and outside these settings for the scenarios described above.
We simulated adding school closures to these workplace policies. When schools close in the model, transmission stops
occurring in schools but children have slightly more potentially infectious contacts in their communities. Preschool
playgroups are not subject to school closures but transmission that occurs in them are counted towards “schools” in the
model, so there will be some apparent school-based transmission after school closures. Adding school closures reduced
the final attack rates even further (red curves in Figure 1). We also ran simulations in which schools re-opened while
workplace-based NPIs were left in place. We observed the epidemic rebound after schools re-opened because we did
not simulate scenarios that resulted in elimination (Figure 3).
Adding shelter-in-place reduced transmission even further. We modeled shelter-in-place by reducing everyone’s
community contacts (contacts outside of home, work, and schools) by 30%. With schools and workplaces already

closed, the shelter-in-place reduced the largest remaining component of transmission, the community (Figure 2).
However, for these demonstration parameters there was still substantial transmission in the home (Figure 2 and Table 2)
Finally, we added three different test-and-isolate strategies to the combination of workplace, school, and community
NPIs described above. We simulated home isolation, self isolation, and home isolation with household quarantine of
ascertained cases. First, we studied a best-case testing scenario in which symptomatic people are tested and results are
ready immediately upon becoming symptomatic. To simulate home isolation, we assumed a person stops going to work
or school after testing positive, though there is still some contact with the community during isolation. In this scenario,
adding home isolation to the other NPIs can reduce transmission in the community (Figures 1– 3 and Table 1). The
impact was not substantial when the other NPIs were already controlling the epidemic (bottom panels of Figure 1),
but its contribution made a qualitative difference when the combined impact of all the NPIs changed the epidemic’s
trajectory from a slow rise to a slow decline, leading to near-elimination (top panels of Figure 1). We simulated self
isolation by blocking transmission to all contacts including household members. For this scenario where individuals
are completely isolated from the susceptible population, self isolation was a little more effective than home isolation,
indicating the role of secondary transmission in the household from the ascertained case. The household quarantine

scenario–home isolation paired with a 14-day quarantine of all household members–was the most effective of the three
strategies. We believe that quarantine of household members addresses both secondary transmission from the index
case as well as the possibility of transmission from other household members that were already infected before the
first symptomatic household member was detected. For all scenarios, when we included a delay in testing, introducing
a 5-day delay between becoming symptomatic and beginning isolation, the impact of these isolation strategies was
reduced (Figure 4). In particular, home and self isolation became equally ineffective, since cases were identified too late
to prevent substantial transmission.

Figure 4: The effect of testing delays on test-and-isolate strategies. We simulated test-and-isolate strategies in which
ascertainment of cases took place immediately upon symptom onset (solid lines) or 5 days after symptom onset (dashed
lines). The simulations with no testing delay (solid lines) are identical to those shown in Figure 1: all NPIs start on
day 30 (top panels) or 90 (bottom panels) of the epidemic, and schools are re-opened on day 180. Three different
isolation strategies were modeled: home isolation, self isolation, and home isolation with family quarantine. 50% of
symptomatic people were tested. The left plots show log-transformed numbers of newly symptomatic people per day
per 100,000 population, and the right plots show cumulative % of the population symptomatic. Each curve represents

When many NPIs are implemented simultaneously, Reffective can be brought below 1.0 resulting in declining prevalence.
One such example was shown in the top panels of Figure 3, in which liberal leave, work-from-home, school closure,
shelter-in-place, and home isolation of 50% of ascertained cases started on day 30 and schools re-opened on day
180. Because elimination did not occur, the epidemic rebounded when schools re-opened. To demonstrate stochastic
effects in the model, we ran the same scenario with different random number seeds (Figure 5). Using different random
number seeds produced different numbers of cases when all interventions were in place from days 30 to 180, and these
differences were amplified after schools re-opened.

Figure 5: Stochastic persistence of SARS-CoV-2 until schools re-open. Liberal leave, work-from-home, school closure,
community contact reduction, and home isolation of 50% of ascertained cases was started on day 30 of the epidemic, and
schools were re-opened after 150 days. Each curve is one of twenty stochastic simulations with the same interventions
simulated. The green lines replicate the stochastic run plotted in Figures 3 and 6. The dashed red line on the bottom
indicates the school closure dates.
To understand what persistence looked like during those 150 days before schools re-opened, we analyzed transmission in
one stochastic simulation run. When the interventions started on day 30, 261 people were infectious, 55 of whom were
symptomatic on that day. The number of people who were infectious continued to rise for about 3 weeks (the infectious
period in the model), peaking at 598 before declining. When schools re-opened on day 180, there were 315 infectious
people who could re-start the epidemic when the schools opened. When school, workplace, community-targeted NPIs
and home isolation were in effect, Reffective was 0.96. Before schools and many workplaces closed, there were chains
of transmission within schools and workplaces (Figure 6, blue and green nodes). When all NPIs were in effect, a
larger proportion of transmission occurred within families (Figure 6, red nodes) and between families by contacts in
the community (Figure 6, brown nodes). This scenario did not include interventions that reduced transmission within
households, so they may sustain the outbreak by amplifying cases that infect new households.
When schools are closed and workplace and other contacts are reduced, there may be high transmission within
households and low transmission everywhere else. The persistence of SARS-CoV-2 could be understood as transmission
between households rather than transmission between individuals [5–8]. We can define a “household” analog of R0 to
be the average number of households that a typical household infects in a totally susceptible population, and Reffective for
households to be this measure at a point in time when the population is not totally susceptible and an intervention may
be taking place. When liberal leave, work-from-home, school closure, shelter-in-place, and home isolation were in
effect at the levels described above, households infected 0.89 other households.

Modeling NPIs against SARS-CoV-2 with Corvid

A P REPRINT

3 Discussion
We introduced and demonstrated the use of a new agent-based model, Corvid, to simulate a variety of NPIs against
SARS-CoV-2. Simulations of single interventions help us understand their contribution to reducing transmission, but
we do not consider them realistic, since interventions can affect the lives of non-targeted people. For example, if
schools are closed, parents may need to stay home to care for their children, creating a de facto work-from-home policy.
Multiple simultaneous NPIs could suppress transmission for long periods of time, but stochasticity (“bad luck”) can
allow SARS-CoV-2 to persist for months under these conditions even if Reffective is slightly below 1. Therefore, when
NPIs were relaxed, the epidemic could rebound. Although we did not include importation of cases in our simulations,
the same sort of rebound could be expected if new cases arrived in the population after NPIs are relaxed. Combinations
of interventions that bring Reffective far below 1 might be required for elimination in a shorter time frame [9]. But even
if elimination does not occur, combinations of NPIs can drastically reduce the prevalence of infections, essentially
“resetting” the epidemic to an earlier and more manageable state. Of course, these interventions are costly to society,
so adaptively modulating them to maintain incidence within a tolerable range is an appealing option if surveillance is
sufficiently broad and timely [9, 10].
Our model results indicate that a large proportion of infections could occur in the household and that the household
secondary attack rates may be high. This conclusion comes from calibrating the model using published observations
of influenza transmission [11–13] and extrapolating using SARS-CoV-2 characteristics. We are not yet aware of a
quantitative synthesis of the evidence for household attack rates and their heterogeneity. In particular, the model
currently assumes that children are a major factor in the spread of SARS-CoV-2, as they are for influenza, which has
not been proven or disproven at this time [14, 15]. If children are less susceptible to infection or are less effective
transmitters than adults with similar clinical presentations, it would impact the effectiveness of school closures and the
rebound following re-opening.
Testing and home isolation of positive cases could serve the broader community more than the families of these cases.
However, our model highlights that untested family members may often be infected before index cases are tested, so
automatic home quarantine for all family members might be warranted if testing them is not possible. Because most
infections in our model come from pre-symptomatic people or from people who never show symptoms, it may be
impossible to prevent most infections with test-and-isolation policies unless non-symptomatic people are also isolated
(e.g., quarantine of families or testing non-symptomatic people). The testing and isolation simulation results are
particularly sensitive to assumptions about asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission [16], neither of which is
yet well-characterized for SARS-CoV-2. Another modeling study found testing with isolation to be more effective,
but their model assumed less asymptomatic transmission than Corvid does currently [17]. Contact tracing might be
required to control SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks [18], but could be more labor-intensive than implementing quarantine
of families of ascertained cases. The proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections that become symptomatic appears to be
age-dependent [19–21], but this is both hard to measure and hard to incorporate in a model. In Corvid, the presence of
symptoms drives testing of cases, and mildly symptomatic people might not be suspected of having COVID-19. We
therefore need to carefully consider how to choose an appropriate symptomatic fraction to model the human behaviors
that drive both disease spread and detection. More extensive testing of asymptomatic contacts would help us understand
the prevalence of asymptomatic infections and the spectrum of disease more generally.
Our model has many obvious limitations. It was developed as the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 was becoming
understood early in the pandemic. We assumed that SARS-CoV-2 could be modeled as a more transmissible influenza
with a longer serial interval. The seasonality of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is not yet known and is not part of the model.
Our model does not estimate hospitalizations or deaths due to COVID-19. Morbidity and mortality rate estimates are
rapidly evolving and depend on local health facilities, and they can be applied to our model output of SARS-CoV-2
infections. Hospitals, healthcare workers, and other high-risk professionals are not included in our model. Finally,
our work is based on an older influenza model [13], so it uses US Census data from the year 2000. The 2000 Census
included a detailed commuter survey that Corvid requires to simulate movement between census tracts, so it would be
difficult to update it with newer Census data.
So far, few models of SARS-CoV-2 explicitly include key settings of transmission [10, 22]. We believe that these
kinds of models are required to mechanistically simulate combinations of NPIs, which would be difficult to simulate
without considering how these interventions target transmission in specific settings but may increase transmission
elsewhere. However, human behavior in response to NPIs is difficult to model, and we believe that model results should
be interpreted cautiously. Many of the population structure assumptions in Corvid were calibrated to match expert
opinion on the relative importance of a few major settings (work, school, home, neighborhood) for seasonal influenza.
As governments enact social distancing measures of unprecedented scale and duration and as public awareness of the
dangers of COVID-19 increase, these assumptions might not hold and models should adapt. Despite these caveats,

Modeling NPIs against SARS-CoV-2 with Corvid

modeling may be one of the best available guides to think through the potential effectiveness of complex combinations
of NPIs.

4 Methods
4.1 Model description
Corvid is based on a previously published influenza transmission model called FluTE, described in detail in [13].
The synthetic populations and the behavior of individuals in the population are taken directly from FluTE. Disease
transmission and natural history parameters were changed to match what is currently known about SARS-CoV-2.
Interventions in the model were modified or added to reflect current discussions about COVID-19. The C++ source code
for Corvid and the scripts used to generate the figures in this manuscript are available at https://github.com/dlchao/corvid.
Version 0.5 of Corvid was used to produce the results in this manuscript. Analyses were performed and plots were
made using the R programming language version 3.6.1 [23] and GraphViz version 2.40.1 (https://www.graphviz.org/).
In brief, Corvid creates communities of about 2000 people, and to simulate larger populations, many little communities
are created and connected through commuting patterns. Synthetic populations for US locations are created by generating
enough communities to represent each census tract, with a population size matching the 2000 US Census data, and
linking those communities using commuter data from that Census. Unfortunately, more recent censuses did not offer the
commuting data. Individuals are in 5 age bins: pre-school, school-aged, young adult, older adult, and elderly. Individuals
are generated by populating the communities with families with the household sizes and age distribution drawn from
the 1% public use microdata sample (PUMS) of the 2000 Census (https://www.census.gov/main/www/pums.html). The
use of PUMS data was introduced to FluTE after the [13] publication.
The model runs in discrete half-day time steps, representing day and night. During the day, people go to institutions
(mixing groups) appropriate to their age, and at night they return to their families (where ages mix). Working-age adults
may commute to different census tracts during the day. We do not distinguish between weekdays and weekends, so
people go to school and work every day. Susceptible people become infected when they are in the same setting as
infected people. Susceptibles also have a small chance of infection if they are in the same community at the same time
as an infectious person. Children and adults are equally susceptible to infection, but children tend to have stronger
“contacts” in the model so are more likely to infect and become infected than adults. Upon infection, a person may
become infectious starting the next day (regardless of symptom status) and their level of infectiousness can change
daily (e.g., exponential, log-normal, etc). A fraction of infectious people become symptomatic after an incubation
period, which is specified as a CDF for flexible parameterization (e.g., can be fixed incubation time, normal, Weibull,
etc). Symptomatic people may choose to stop going to work or school because of illness. Public health interventions,
such as home quarantine or school closures, may be based on the cumulative prevalence of detected symptomatic cases.
Social distancing is implemented by closing settings, like schools, to stop transmission but this is partially offset by
these individuals going elsewhere. Much more detail about model structure and assumptions is in [13].
We ran Corvid in a synthetic population based on 2000 US Census data for the Seattle metropolitan area, which we take
to represent a typical large city in the US. The synthetic population has 563,484 people residing in 124 census tracts
(Figure 7). Tracts have 1181 to 9003 people living in them, and 150 to 36,823 people working in them.
4.2 Model calibration for SARS-CoV-2 transmission
Corvid was calibrated to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Where possible, parameters were derived from the
literature. Other disease parameters were taken from influenza (FluTE’s default parameters). Corvid users should
update and re-calibrate as more information about SARS-CoV-2 becomes available.
We assume that half of people infected will become symptomatic. This is a provisional assumption until we can obtain
more reliable estimates.
For the incubation period distribution (duration from infection to showing symptoms), we used the log-normal fit from
[24] who used data from Shenzhen. They found parameters of log(mean)=1.621 and log(sd)=0.418 (Figure 8). There
are reports that viral detection peaks a few days after symptoms. [25] found pharyngeal shedding to peak 4 days after
symptoms using throat swabs. Therefore, we used the incubation period distribution and added 4 to the mean (the
log(mean) of the distribution is log(exp(1.621)+4)). That makes shedding peak 4 days after the median incubation
period (Figure 8). It might make more sense for shedding to peak right after symptoms appear in an individual instead
of independent of symptom onset. We assume that shedding lasts for 21 days, though the level of shedding is low by the
end of the infectious period. We make asymptomatic individuals half as infectious as symptomatic. So if a person never
becomes symptomatic, infectiousness is simply half that of a symptomatic individual over time. If a person becomes

symptomatic five days after becoming infected, then for the first five days that person is less infectious and after that
approximately twice as infectious. To our knowledge, there is no direct evidence that asymptomatic people are less
infectious than symptomatic, but we assume that the symptoms like sneezing mechanically spread disease. There are
some hints that asymptomatic have viral loads similar to symptomatic [26].
We calibrate R0 by counting the number of people an index case can infect in the model. This captures not only
shedding kinetics, but behavior in response to illness (tendency to stay home) and age-dependent mixing patterns. We
set transmissibility of coronavirus in the model by multiplying contact probabilities by the scalar β, which we can set in
the model. We derive the relationship between R0 and β by running the model with different values of β and counting
the number of people an index case infects in a fully susceptible population. For each value of β that we test, we infect
one randomly selected individual in the population. We fit a line through the average number of secondary cases for
each value of β tested.
The number of people infected depends on the age of the index case. For example, if an index case is a school-aged
child (indicated by “1” on the plot), the number of secondary cases is higher than for other age groups. Also, the
secondary cases are not representative of the general population – school-aged children are also over-represented among
infectees. R0 should be defined as the number of secondary cases generated by a “typical” case. Therefore, we tally the
number of secondary cases generated by all index cases across runs to get a better idea of who is more likely to be a
“typical” infecter. We weight the relationship based on the proportion of secondary cases in each age bin; we put more
weight on the high transmission from school children than the lower transmission from adults in our R0 calculation
(Figure 9). For the default model, we set R0 to be 2.6 (β=0.168206), but we also test R0 =2.0. These estimates are in
line with the literature [26–28]. We often initialize the model with more than one infected individual. When you seed
with one, there is a high probability that an epidemic does not take off.

Figure 8: Incubation period distribution and shedding trajectory in the Corvid model. Black curve is the log-normal
distribution of incubation periods from [24], truncated at day 14. Incubation periods are drawn from this distribution in
Corvid. The blue curve is shedding over time in Corvid, which is a log-normal distribution with a higher mean but same
standard deviation as the incubation distribution. The distribution truncated at day 21. In Corvid, people start shedding
the day after infection regardless of symptomatic status.
Things that affect R0 (and would require model recalibration if changed):
virus’s incubation period

infectiousness over time
tendency of people to stay home when sick
family structure/age structure of the population

We ran simulations in a synthetic population that represents a large American city with a population of over 560,000.
In an unmitigated outbreak starting with five infected people, 81% of the population became infected when R0 =2.6
(Figure 10). The doubling time was initially 5.4 days before slowing 8.4 days, and the average generation time was 8.4
days, median of 8.0 days (Figure 11). The maximum infectious period allowed by the model is 21 days.

A.2 Where do infections occur in the model?
In simulated epidemics, a large proportion of infections occurred within households (Table 1). School and workplaces
contribute less but still comprise a significant share of transmission. The remaining infections come from the general
community. For lower R0 , schools may play a larger role in transmission. For high R0 , the attack rate for all age groups
is high, so the age distribution of cases flattens and adults (and settings with only adults) become more important.

In the model, if an individual becomes infected with SARS-CoV-2, there is a high probability that other family members
will become infected. We can measure the household secondary attack rates by infecting a random individual in the
population with a non-transmissible pathogen (using the method used to compute R0 as described in Section 4.2) and
count the number of infections in that person’s household. For R0 =2.6, if an index case is a child, the household
infection attack rate is 51% for children and 28% for adults (Table 2). If an index case is an adult, the household
infection attack rate is 22% for children and 32% for adults.

by age of the susceptible household member. The rows are the probabilities of an index case infecting other household
members based on the age of the index case.
