ABSTRACT
Early school closures were a consistent, nationwide response to the COVID-19 pandemic in midMarch due to the role that children play in spreading influenza. This left us with limited
understanding of COVID-19 transmission in children until several states reopened schools for the
2020-2021 school year. While early school closures were likely beneficial in protecting children in
the initial stages of the pandemic in the U.S., long-term closures pose significant cumulative effects
in children who rely on schools for instruction and additional social services, and for parents who
need to balance work and childcare obligations. Reopening schools safely is a high priority for
many interested stakeholders.
Proposed in-person school reopening plans include traditional, 100% school capacity, five
days per week instruction, hybrid scenarios with reduced in-person instruction and virtual
learning, and various reduced school capacity schedules with non-pharmaceutical interventions in
place. To assess the potential impacts of different reopening plans, we created a modified SIRtype transmission model that captures multiple known pathways of COVID-19 transmission in a
100,000-person community.
Our results show that plans that utilize consecutive days in school and divide students into
separated smaller cohorts who attend school together, as well as plans that emphasize distance
learning, are better able to suppress disease spread and reduce risk from an introduced infective
into the community. Plans with more consecutive school days are protective for both the
schoolchildren and surrounding community by acting to separate the larger intermixing
population into smaller intermixing subpopulations. The “Five-Day Switch” plan, which separates
students into two cohorts, each of whom attend in-person learning for five consecutive days

followed by five days of distance learning, best captures these protective attributes. All modeled
plans assumed initially disease-free communities and that children’s interactions with the
community are greatly reduced during instructional days, both for in-person and distance learning.

INTRODUCTION
A cluster of idiopathic pneumonia cases in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China was reported via the
Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases (ProMED) on 30 December 2019 (ProMED 2019). The
viral agent was identified by Chinese health authorities as a novel coronavirus on 9 January 2020
(World Health Organization 2020a) and officially named SARS-CoV-2 (World Health Organization
2020b). By 20 January 2020, there were 9,976 cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), including
the first reported U.S. case (Holshue et al. 2020). The World Health Organization issued a
statement on 7 March 2020 in recognition of 100,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide. Within a week,
many U.S. schools closed for an early Spring Break, with most schools remaining closed for the
duration of the 2019-2020 school year. This measure was in part based on knowledge of the
spread of influenza, where children play a key role in disease transmission (Isfeld-Kiely and
Moghadas 2014, Bayham and Fenichel 2020, Russell et al. 2016).
Data on children’s susceptibility to COVID-19 has been inconsistent, especially due to early
school closures as one of the only consistent and prompt national actions in response to the U.S.
pandemic (Auger et al. 2020). Early international evidence showed children were significantly less
likely than adults to become infected (Davies et al. 2020, Gudbjartsson et al. 2020). The Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that, between 12 February and 2 April 2020,
children accounted for less than 2% of all cases of COVID-19 while making up 22% of the U.S.
population (CDC COVID-19 Response Team 2020). A meta-analysis examining 16 studies as of 16
May 2020 found a pooled odds ratio of 0.44 of infections in children compared to adults (Viner et
al. 2020a), while a contemporaneous study from the United Kingdom found no age-related
infection differences (Woodhill 2020). A brief reopening of schools in Israel was followed by

immediate closures two weeks later when safety guidelines were not strictly enforced during a
heat wave (Stein-Zamir 2020). Children were also seen to travel to school via a range of
transportation and to participate in extracurricular activities with differing groups of children.
Without traditional, full-day in-person school, children face food insecurity, slowed
educational progression, and developmental harms, while mothers are disproportionately
burdened with balancing work responsibilities with childcare (Esposito and Principi 2020, Viner et
al. 2020b, Kneale et al. 2020). There is general agreement that schools should implement
measures such as social distancing of at least six feet, lower teacher-student ratios, mask wearing,
and isolation and discharge policies for children who become ill while at school (Riley 2020). These
mitigations may not be fully feasible in terms of both staff and space for many school districts if
all students are present. Many school districts are advocating for timely reopening to alleviate
public health, economic, and emotional consequences for children and parents.
Several U.S. states have published and proposed reopening schedules for the 2020-2021
academic year, which typically begins in mid-August to early September. Many school districts and
state Departments of Education are in favor of a “hybrid” or “blended rotation,” whereby one
cohort of students are present on campus receiving face-to-face instruction, while another cohort
or cohorts participates in distance learning (Hawai’i Department of Education 2020a, MCH
Strategic Data 2020). Many schools also propose tiered plans, with fully in-person schooling under
pandemic precautions of social distancing and mask usage eventually replacing fully online
schedules once certain criteria have been met. Although the majority of states publicly share their
school reopening plans (MCH Strategic Data 2020), few give any references to support their
particular reopening decisions and whether they have considered other possible plans. As such, a

need exists for a comparison between proposed school reopening plans to identify those with the
potential to allow safe school reopenings.
We examined each U.S. state’s published school reopening plan to identify commonalities.
Plans can be categorized by their proposed daily school capacity, division of school population into
two or more, non-mixing cohorts, and by number of consecutive days spent in school. Examples
of reopening plans include traditional five-day per week attendance at 100% school capacity, twocohort half-capacity plans with students alternating days in attendance, and one day per grade
20% capacity plans (Bailey et al. 2020, MCH Strategic Data 2020). The majority of schools favor a
“hybrid” or “blended rotation,” where one group of students are present on campus receiving
face-to-face instruction while the other group(s) participates in distance learning (Hawai’i State
Dept. of Ed 2020b, Illinois State Board of Ed 2020).
Policymakers are looking to predictive modeling efforts to understand the potential
impacts of school reopening in the absence of extensive real-world data, but research to date is
limited. Di Domenico et al. (2020) used demographic data from three regions in France coupled
with a stochastic age-structured epidemic model to predict school closures in the absence of
additional mitigation efforts in the wider community, such as telework, would have limited effect
in reducing the magnitude of peak incidence.
This study aims to quantify the epidemic-level potential for several of the most common
school reopening scenarios being considered in the United States to identify effective
characteristics of each of these strategies to provide recommendations. We examine an idealized
100,000-person community with full susceptibility to COVID-19 infection, including 15,000 school-

aged children. In all reopening scenarios, a single susceptible individual in the population is
replaced with a clinically infected case.

I.

The Basic Model – No School

A single-patch deterministic model is initially postulated that captures all known methods of
transmission by disease status as well as different pathways to testing. The population is stratified
into nine epidemiologic compartments including Susceptible S, Exposed who will become
subclinically infected Es, Exposed who will become clinically infected E, subclinically infectious Is,
pre-clinically Infectious Ip, clinically Infectious Ic, Testing K, Quarantine Q, and Recovered R. It is
assumed that all individuals are initially susceptible, with a single introduced infectious initiating
an epidemic scenario. Susceptible individuals will contract infection at rate 𝛽 times the proportion
of infected individuals and then themselves become subclinically or clinically infectious, first
passing through their appropriate exposed compartment at rate 𝜀. Those who will become
clinically infectious next pass through a preclinical compartment IP, where they have reduced
infectiousness compared to clinically infectious cases IC. Infectious individuals, regardless of
symptomology, recover from infection at rate 𝛾.
Per understanding of COVID-19 disease transmission as of mid-August 2020, three routes
of transmission are possible: from clinically infectious cases, from subclinically infectious cases at
a potentially reduced rate, and from preclinically infectious cases at a known reduced rate. This
population proportion of infectious individuals is summarized in the model as transmission
parameter 𝐵 = 𝛽(𝐼! + 𝜎𝐼" + 𝜅𝐼# )/𝑁. It is further assumed that a proportion 𝑝 of clinically

infectious individuals voluntarily seek confirmatory testing at rate 𝑟$ after symptom onset. While
awaiting their positive test results, these individuals move to quarantine, assumed to be fully
effective. For this study, any testing requirements to be released from quarantine are ignored and
a 14-day quarantine period is assumed. Under mass testing, all non-quarantine compartments are
tested with equal probability 𝑞 at rate 𝑟% . Only preclinical, subclinical, and clinically infectious cases
will have altered disease classification after testing; all other individuals will return to their current
status compartment after testing. Figure 1 depicts the full hypothesized single-patch disease
transmission model.
Methods. To determine transmission rate 𝛽, a simplified single patch model that omits

testing and quarantine was evaluated (Figure 2) to define the system’s basic reproductive number
𝑅& based on model parameters (e.g., van den Driessche P, Watmough J 2002). This modified
disease transmission model corresponds to the following set of ordinary differential equations:

This equation for 𝑅& can be algebraically solved for 𝛽 and parameter values can be substituted
from the “Best Guess” scenario outlined in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
“COVID-19 Pandemic Planning Scenarios” (CDC 2020). Reasonable probability distributions for
each parameter were generated to reflect uncertainty in each value, as summarized in Table 1.
Recovery time 𝛾 was not provided by the CDC and instead was taken as 10-14 days from preclinical
onset based on local case observations. Parameter distributions and a uniformly distributed
𝑅& ~ 𝑈𝑛𝑖𝑓(2.5, 3.0) before interventions were implemented were used to determine a baseline
point value and distribution for 𝛽, which conformed to a Gamma distribution with shape 𝛼 =

The full simple single-patch model with testing and quarantine was coded into R (version
4.0.1, “See Things Now”, R Core Team 2019) and evaluated over ten weeks as a baseline “summer
vacation” scenario. To understand the potential behavior of the baseline model, a total of 10,000
simulations were run using parameters drawn from probability distributions as described in Table
1. Mean curves of susceptibles and infected, as well as confidence bands, are shown in Figure 3.

Results. In the baseline model under initial conditions with no schooling, a total of

60,089.49 (95% CI: 47,355.81, 72,823.17) clinical infections occur in a community of 100,000
individuals (Figure 3, upper). Since this model does not differentiate between schoolchildren and
members of the surrounding community, this 60% infection prevalence includes 60.46% overall
infection rate in children (9,068.94 cases, 95% CI: 5,725.98, 12,411.90). Mitigation levels that
reduce R0 from 2.5 - 3.0 to just over 1.0 - 1.4, acts to “flatten the curve” without reducing total
number of infections (Figure 3, lower).

II.

School Reopening Plans

School reopening plans divide the population into subgroups of “school” and “town” using parallel
single-patch deterministic models so that individuals remain within their subgroup throughout
disease progression. Such stratification is required when the homogeneous mixing assumption is
expected to be violated, such as when children attend school and aren’t expected to be able to
maintain the same mitigation levels to reduce transmission as with adults who do not attend
school. The added model complexity can allow for emergent dynamics when a different set of
parameters pertain to a subset of the population.
In the simplest school reopening model, depicted in figure 4(a), a percentage of the
population is deemed the “school” population. Interaction between subgroups is specified via a
transmission matrix that modifies the transmission rate 𝛽 calculated for the base model depending
on type of interaction: student-student interactions are expected to have a transmission rate > 𝛽
while in school due to a higher frequency of interactions, while student-town interactions are
expected to have a transmission rate < 𝛽 to represent reduced interactions with adults to only

parents and school staff during school days. Under this simplest school reopening scenario, we
assume a student-student transmission rate that is 20% higher than that seen between non-school
individuals, an 80% reduced transmission rate between students and town during school days, and
a 60% reduced transmission between students and town during distance learning days (if
applicable to the plan):

with row corresponding to Town, School and columns corresponding to Town, School.
This simplest school reopening model is evaluated for a traditional five-day week, as well
as in reduced scenarios of four days per week, three days per week, and one day per week under
both an R0 of 2.5 - 3.0 without mitigations and under an RC of 1.01 - 1.40 with mitigations. As a
baseline comparison, a full distance learning plan, i.e., zero days per week attendance, is examined
under both uncontrolled and controlled transmission.
Methods. The baseline 0% capacity school function in R was adjusted to a two-subgroup

model with a larger “town” and smaller “school” group. Susceptible individuals are exposed to
infected individuals in town and school using a transmission matrix. The full student body of 15,000
students (15% of the 100,000-person population) attends school for the specified number of days,
which is modeled as the two subgroups running through compartmentalized disease states in
parallel. A complete week under a school reopening scenario consists of days in school + days in
distance learning + days in weekend + 1 day, where each change in population-level interaction is

modeled using the base mixing model run with the appropriate transmission matrix and
parameters drawn from the stochastic parameter ranges described in Table 1, and for time steps
of days + 1, where the extra day is used to define initial compartmental conditions for the next
week. Each single week school schedule function was run through ten weeks. The total number of
clinically infectious cases, total number of clinical infections in children, and percentage of children
with clinical infections were retained for each model.
Two scenarios were examined for each single cohort school schedule: Scenario A refers to
an initially infected individual introduced into the town subgroup and Scenario B refers to an
initially infected individual occurring in the school subgroup. A baseline of zero days per week, full
distance learning model was also run for comparison.
Results. Table 3 reports the findings for each school scenario run under initial outbreak

conditions and Table 4 reports findings under mitigated conditions. Increased consecutive days in
school offers a slight reduction in total number of cases compared to the baseline of no schooling
by delaying exposure between cohorts. Differences between Scenario A and Scenario B are
negligible. Figure 4 shows mean total cases under Scenario A under R0-type transmission rates and
under RC-type transmission rates. Mean total cases between the two transmission rates are also
nearly identical, but confidence limits under each transmission condition vary and showing
differing trends. Under R0 conditions, confidence intervals show a bowtie pattern, narrowing from
baseline to three consecutive school days, then widening again out to five consecutive school days.
Under RC conditions, confidence intervals are overall lower than for R0 conditions and are skewed
compared to the mean, indicating a probability distribution of means which more often includes
very small outbreaks.

Figure 5 shows mean number of cases in children. In a model run for ten weeks with initial
conditions of a single converted infective case in the community, children show a perceptible
dose-response relationship to additional days in in-person schooling, reducing from approximately
9,069 infections under initial epidemic conditions without schooling to 5,264 cases, a 42%
reduction, under full five-day schooling. Under controlled conditions, cases in children reduce
from approximately 8,086 cases to 5,263, a 35% reduction.
Discussion. Number of continuous days in school has a protective effect compared to no

school by temporarily protecting subpopulations from active infection, as demonstrated by the
five-day scenario being more protective than the one-day scenario. The increased interaction
within school is seemingly offset by their highly reduced interaction with the larger community,
which acts to isolate a significantly sized subpopulation. The non-overlapping confidence intervals
between R0 conditions and RC conditions indicates that further decreasing overall community
spread will be critical for preventing cases within schools. School is most effective for the student
population. Further reduction in childhood infectious cases is expected if the student cohort is
additionally subdivided, as in several school reopening scenarios proposed by school districts.
While these findings and trends are not statistically significant due to included noise in estimated
parameters, further research and understanding of these parameters will reduce such noise and
make the protective effect of days in school more pronounced.

III.

Two Cohort Reopening Plans

Under two-cohort school reopening plans, students are split into two or five cohorts. Like in single
cohort scenarios, cohorts attend school together for consecutive days, with greatly reduced

mixing between students and town assumed on in-person school days and less reduced mixing
between students and town assumed on distance learning days. Cohorts intermix with one
another at reduced rates in the same way that students interacted with town at reduced rates in
the single cohort scenarios, but the additional school cohort requires an expansion of the
transmission matrix. If the school reopening plan includes a cleaning day, this day is treated as a
distance learning day for both cohorts. The transmission matrix for Cohort 1 on in-person
schooling days is shown below:

1.0 0.2 0.4
= 𝛽 b0.2 1.2 0.2c,
0.4 0.2 0.4

with rows corresponding to Town, Cohort 1, Cohort 2 and columns corresponding to Town, Cohort
1, Cohort 2.
The transmission matrix on cleaning days if applicable:
1.0 0.4 0.4
𝑇𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑀𝑎𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑥:1;76+411, = 𝛽 b0.4 0.4 0.4c.
0.4 0.4 0.4

A final proposed 50% capacity, two-cohort plan studied is the AB plan. Under this plan, the two
cohorts each attend school in person every day for a half school day, with one cohort attending in
the morning and the other attending in the afternoon. We assume under this plan that students
do not intermix on their way to and from school, and that classroom surfaces and other shared
facilities cannot transmit COVID-19 between cohorts.
The transmission matrix used on all school days is:

with rows and columns again corresponding to Town, Cohort 1, and Cohort 2, respectively.
Methods. The single-cohort function in R is modified to add an additional school cohort, so

that three cohorts interact. Functions were written to model a single week, as depicted in Figure
4(c-e). In the two-day switch model, shown in Figure 4(c), a first cohort of 50% of students attend
in-person on Monday and Tuesday, then the school is closed for cleaning on Wednesday. The
second cohort of students attend Thursday and Friday, then all students are home for a regular
weekend on Saturday and Sunday. The full week is modeled as two days of Cohort 1 in
school/Cohort 2 in distance learning + one day of full distance learning + two days of Cohort 1 in
distance learning/Cohort 2 in school + two days of weekend + 1 day, with appropriate transmission
matrices used for each run of the base mixing model. Once again, the week includes one additional
day to generate initial conditions for the next week. A subsequent function then runs each scenario
for ten weeks and retains total number of clinically infectious cases, number of clinically infectious
cases in children, and percentage of children clinical infectious in each of 10,000 model
simulations. Confidence intervals were calculated.
In the five-day cohort switching model, shown in Figure 4(d) and which takes two weeks
to repeat, the model is run for five weeks instead of ten, omitting the cleaning day between
cohorts. The full model, repeated for five runs to total ten weeks, is five days of Cohort 1 in
school/Cohort 2 in distance learning + two days of weekend + five days of Cohort 1 in distance
learning/Cohort 2 in school + two days of weekend + 1 day.

In the AB plan model, shown in Figure 4(e), the five-day 100% capacity model was used,
with the transmission matrix expanded for school days to three cohorts in total. Since all students
are in school for part of the day and in distance learning for the remainder of the day, only a single
school-day transmission matrix is required:

1.0 0.2 0.2
𝑇𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑀𝑎𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑥#+411, = 𝛽 b0.2 1.2 0.2c,
0.2 0.2 1.2

where rows and columns correspond to Town, Cohort 1, and Cohort 2, respectively and it
is assumed that all student interactions occur as in a full school day. The single week model is five
days of Cohort 1/Cohort 2 in school and in distance learning + two weekend days + 1 day.
Results. The 50% capacity, two-day switch model under R0 conditions is not effective in

reducing cases counts when compared to either of the baseline comparisons. This reopening plan
is effective in reducing epidemic-level case counts under RC conditions, however, though its
effectiveness varies significantly depending on which scenario of placement of converted
infectious case. The two-day plan is especially effective when the converted infective is a
townsperson, as opposed to a student, reducing overall cases from 58,335.56 to 95.77 (95% CI:
47.14, 194.55) cases, a 99.8% reduction in cases.
Under both uncontrolled and controlled levels of transmission, the 50% capacity, five-day
switch model is very effective in reducing overall case counts and case counts in children. Under
both conditions, the five-day switch model is especially effective at reducing infection in children
when the introduced infective is a townsperson, reducing overall cases from 60,089.49 cases in

the baseline model to 16.72 cases (95% CI: 8.31, 33.63), a 99.97% reduction in cases in the
uncontrolled scenario and from 58,335.56 cases to 3.42 (95% CI: 2.17, 5.41) cases, a reduction
over 99.99%.
The AB school plan, which consists of two cohorts of students each alternately attending
in-person school for a half-day and distancing learning for a half-day, is not effective in reducing
overall cases or cases in children under uncontrolled transmission conditions. Under controlled
transmission conditions, the AB school model is somewhat effective in reducing overall cases,
especially when the initial infective is in town, reducing total infections from 52,104.54 total cases
under baseline distance learning to 17,541.99 (95% CI: 3,241.76, 43,245.67) total cases under the
AB reopening plan, a 66% reduction in infection. With regard to infections in children, the AB
reopening plan reduced total cases from 7,268.02 cases under baseline distance learning to
2,812.03 (95% CI: 561.14, 6,784.60) cases, a 61% reduction in infection. When the introduced
infective is in either school cohort, infection reduction is less effective, reducing total cases by
approximately 10% and cases in children by less than 1%.
Discussion. Split cohort plans in general are very robust against introduced infectious

cases, especially when the initial infection occurs within the town rather than the school
population. The AB plan is overall less effective than either the two-day or five-day switch plans,
and may not be effective at all in uncontrolled transmission situations. It must be recalled that this
modeling exercise assumes no current infections in the community at the start of school and that
people continue to maintain control measures even in the absence of active community cases.
This modeling exercise also assumes that students maintain reduced community mixing on

distance learning days, which is more likely to occur when students receive live virtual lessons with
required attendance.

IV.

Five Cohort Plan

In the five cohort reopening plan students form cohorts by grade level, with each grade level using
school facilities for a single day of in-person instruction. This type of plan makes the most sense
for private schools or public elementary schools, where students generally receive grade-specific
instruction, and would likely be more difficult in high schools were students are less strictly divided
by grade level.
Methods. The two-cohort, 50% school capacity R function was further modified to allow a

total of five interacting school cohorts. Once more, each school cohort, as well as the town,
progress through disease states in parallel, only interacting via a transmission matrix specifying
the levels of interactions between cohorts with respect to an overall rate. The cohort attending
in-person school interacts with each other at 120% 𝛽 and interacts with all other cohorts, including
town, at a reduced 20% 𝛽. Distance learning students are expected to interact at a reduced rate
with all other cohorts, including their own. The transmission matrix for Day is:

The non-school town interacts at rate 𝛽, with in-person schooling students at a reduced rate of
20% 𝛽, and with distance-learning students at a reduced rate of 40% 𝛽. A separate transmission
matrix is used for each school day corresponding to the cohort that experiences in-person school,
with all other students in distance learning. Finally, the weekend consists of an identity matrix
multiplier on transmission for three days, with the third day serving as initial conditions for the
next week. This model was run over ten consecutive weeks as well as six cases overall, one for
each cohort with a single susceptible replaced with an infectious.
Results. Under uncontrolled conditions, the 20% capacity, Five Cohort school reopening

plan reduces total infections from 59,942.76 in the distance learning baseline to 176.90 (95%
CI:48.02, 651.68, a 99.7% reduction) when the converted infectious individual is in town. Clinically
infectious cases in children is reduced from 8,958.00 to 26.33 (95% CI: 7.08, 97.94) when the
converted infectious individual is in town, also a 99.7% reduction in cases. When the converted
infectious person is a child, total cases in town are reduced to roughly 978 cases, a 93.48%
reduction from the full distance learning baseline.
Under controlled conditions, the 20% capacity, Five Cohort school reopening plan reduces
total infections from 52,104.54 in the full distance learning baseline to 10.13 (95% CI: 4.22, 24.36)
total cases, a greater than 99.99% reduction, when the converted infectious person is In town.
When the converted infectious individual is a student, total cases are reduced to slightly less than
52, a greater than 99.95% reduction from baseline comparison.
Discussion. The 20% capacity, Five-Cohort school reopening plan is very protective against

a single converted infectious individual when the overall community has no other active cases,
both when transmission is controlled through protective measures and when it is not. This

reopening plan may be less feasible in practice, however, if a school is unable to operate with only
20% of students in-person per day. This type of reopening plan will probably be more realistic for
elementary schools than middle schools or high schools, because students generally do not move
between classrooms. If students attend classes

V.

CONCLUSIONS AND NEXT STEPS

All school reopening plans were examined under both non-controlled epidemic conditions and
under controlled conditions. It is assumed that the overall population is initially disease-free and
fully susceptible to COVID-19 before an initial infection occurs, either in the town or in schools. If
these two groups regularly interact outside of school attendance, the location of the initial
infection has little effect. A protective effect is seen with increased consecutive days in school
compared to no school or distance learning, though the magnitude of this effect is small. School
reopening plans that reduce a single large population into several sub-populations and limit their
interaction throughout the week are the most effective strategies to reduce overall transmission.
If schoolchildren are isolated at school during school hours but then move around freely within
the larger community during non-school hours, or do not stay home during designated distance
learning days, the protective effect of separating the population is will likely be lost. The most
effective plan is the “Five-Day Switch Plan,” which takes advantage of both benefits by separating
school children into two cohorts and using five consecutive school days per cohort.
In follow up to this study, we will perform a sensitivity analysis of the most promising
scenarios to assess which parameters are most driving these effects. We will additionally examine
threshold levels of transmission differences between school and town populations, and levels and

“flattening of the curve” does not reduce overall cases, but rather spreads them out through time to allow for the
action of contact tracing and more restrictive mitigation measures to reduce community spread and to not overwhelm

FIGURE 4 School Reopening Plans. In baseline (a), no children attend in-person school. This is equivalent to summer vacation, with
all community members interacting and transmitting disease at rate 𝛽" under uncontrolled conditions and 𝛽# under controlled
conditions. In (b), school is open five days per week at 100% capacity, or 15,000 students, reducing the community to 85,000
intermixing non-school individuals. For reduced full day scenarios, some school days are replaced with distance learning mixing
conditions on some days. In the two-day switch model (c), students are split into two, non-mixing cohorts with a first cohort of
7,500 students attending school for two days, followed by one distance learning day for facility cleaning, and then the next 7,500student cohort attends for two days. In the five-day switch model (d), a first 7,500-student cohort attends for five consecutive days
while the second 7,500-student cohort is distance learning at a reduced community mixing rate. In the second week, the first
cohort is distance learning while the second 7,500-student cohort attends in-person schooling. In the AB school reopening plan
(e), two 7,500-student cohorts attend school every day, with one group attending in the morning and the other attending in the
afternoon.

an overall downward trend and protective effect of each additional case of schooling compared to baseline, with a
bowtie pattern of respective confidence intervals on these means, with initially narrower confidence intervals giving
way to wider intervals after three days of consecutive schooling. Proportion of clinically infectious individuals under
RC conditions (blue dots) shows a nearly identical overall downward trend and protective effect of additional schooling
when overplotted onto the proportions calculated under R0 conditions, as well as a bowtie pattern for confidence
intervals. Confidence intervals for school plans under RC do not as readily overlap with confidence intervals, indicating
that the overall community transmission rate plays a large role in the variability seen between simulations.
