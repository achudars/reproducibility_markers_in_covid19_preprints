Abstract
Background
This paper describes the construction of a model used to estimate the number of excess deaths that
could be expected as a direct consequence of a lack of hospital bed and intensive care unit (ICU)
capacity.

Methods
A series of compartmental models was used to estimate the number of deaths under different
combinations of care required (ICU or ward), and care received (ICU, ward or no care) in England up to
the end of April 2021. Model parameters were sourced from publicly available government information,
organisations collating COVID-19 data and calculations using existing parameters. A compartmental submodel was used to estimate the mortality scalars that represent the increase in mortality that would be
expected from a lack of provision of an ICU or general ward bed when one is required. Three illustrative
scenarios for admissions numbers, ‘Optimistic’, ‘Middling’ and ‘Pessimistic’, are described showing how
the model can be used to estimate mortality rates under different scenarios of capacity.

Results
The key output of our collaboration was the model itself rather than the results of any of the scenarios.
The model allows a user to understand the excess mortality impact arising as a direct consequence of
capacity being breached under various scenarios or forecasts of hospital admissions. The scenarios
described in this paper are illustrative and are not forecasts.
There were no excess deaths from a lack of capacity in any of the ‘Optimistic’ scenario applications in
sensitivity analysis.

Classification: Public
Several of the ‘Middling’ scenario applications under sensitivity testing resulted in excess deaths directly
attributable to a lack of capacity. Most excess deaths arose when we modelled a 20% reduction
compared to best estimate ICU capacity. This led to 597 deaths (0.7% increase).
All the ‘Pessimistic’ scenario applications under sensitivity analysis had excess deaths. These ranged
from 49,219 (19.4% increase) when we modelled a 20% increase in ward bed availability over the bestestimate, to 103,845 (40.9% increase) when we modelled a 20% shortfall in ward bed availability below
the best-estimate. The emergence of a new, more transmissible variant (VOC 202012/01) increases the
likelihood of real world outcomes at, or beyond, those modelled in our ‘Pessimistic’ scenario.
The results can be explained by considering how capacity evolves in each of the scenarios. In the
Middling scenario, whilst ICU capacity may be approached and even possibly breached, there remains
sufficient ward capacity to take lives who need either ward or ICU support, keeping excess deaths
relatively low. However, the Pessimistic scenario sees ward capacity breached, and in many scenarios
for a period of several weeks, resulting in much higher mortality in those lives who require care but do
not receive it.

Conclusions
No excess deaths from breaching capacity would be expected under the unadjusted ‘Optimistic’
assumptions of demand. The ‘Middling’ scenario could result in some excess deaths from breaching
capacity, though these would be small (0.7% increase) relative to the total number of deaths in that
scenario. The ‘Pessimistic’ scenario would certainly result in significant excess deaths from breaching
capacity. Our sensitivity analysis indicated a range between 49,219 (19.4% increase) and 103,845 (40.9%
increase) excess deaths.
Without the new variant, exceeding capacity for hospital and ICU beds did not appear to be the most
likely outcome but given the new variant it now appears more plausible and, if so, would result in a
substantial increase in the number of deaths from COVID-19.

Background
The number of deaths from COVID-19 in the UK was 74,125 deaths and the number of known cases was
2,542,069 as of the 2nd January 2021 representing a case fatality rate (CFR) of 2.9%. The Office for
National Statistics (ONS) Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey estimated that 8.7% of people in
England still had antibodies at detectable levels based upon serological testing.(1) Assuming that, as of
the 2nd January 2021, around 10% to 15% of the population of England has been infected (taking into
account those with antibodies no longer at detectable levels, the lag time and the small proportion of
false negative serology), then this would suggest that between 6.7 million and 10 million people have
already been infected representing an infection fatality rate (IFR) of 0.7% to 1.1%.
IFR estimates are typically made in the context of adequate capacity of health care services including
hospital beds and intensive care unit (ICU) beds. Should the demand for ICU beds exceed the supply,
then the IFR would be expected to rise. In this paper we describe a demand and capacity model
designed to estimate the number of deaths that would directly arise from a lack of ICU and ward beds.
In November 2020 we began development of a model to estimate what increases in deaths could be
expected as a direct consequence of a lack of hospital bed capacity, and in particular ICU beds. Due to
availability of data, the model was restricted to England.

Estimating the ICU capacity in England is not straightforward. There were estimated to be 4,114 ICU
beds in England pre-pandemic.(2) However, there are plans in place to allow surges in ICU capacity
when pandemics occur which entails repurposing other hospital resources including anaesthetic rooms,
operating theatres and parts of accident and emergency departments. The aim was to be able to
increase ICU bed capacity across the country by 100% in the event of a pandemic.(3) It is likely that the
increase in capacity will vary by institution and one case study managed to increase capacity by 236%
during the first wave.(4) In the event of a pandemic, the NHS is supposed to respond through a whole
system approach, which has been outlined in the UK CRITCON scoring system. The basis for the system
is that the same non-pandemic ethical standards are applied to treat patients and allocate resources,
unless in the extreme scenario (CRITCON 4). The system was formulated in 2009 for H1N1 and has been
updated in 2020 in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The levels described above extend from a
normal capacity at CRITCON 0 to CRITCON 4 when the system is overwhelmed. A “mutual aid” system
exists to facilitate inter-hospital or regional transfer of patients when the local intensive care capacity is
breached in order to support the principle that no patient should be deprived of the appropriate care if
there is systemwide capacity available. Eighteen intensive care networks in the England and Northern
Ireland manage the capacity and allocation to intensive care in the event of increasing demand.
At the start of the pandemic a series of field hospitals were constructed at eight sites across England.
The capacity is somewhat elastic according to circumstances, but it is estimated that this would
potentially provide an additional 8,000 general ward beds and 500 ICU beds though there may be
staffing constraints that also limit this number.(2)
In this paper we describe a model for estimating the number of additional deaths that occur from a lack
of capacity under different scenarios. These are illustrative scenarios and not forecasts. It is important to
emphasise that parameterization of the model can be modified according to available information and
updated over time.

Methods
Model description
The model can be found at this location on GitHub: Crystallize/COVID19_ExceedingCapacityModel
(github.com).
The model is a series of static compartmental models that estimates the number of deaths under three
conditions: availability of both general ward and ICU care; availability of general ward care but no ICU
care; and no availability of either general ward or ICU care.
The model was developed as an Excel workbook. This was chosen as it allows rapid iteration and
development with transparency for other developers and reviewers as it is a widely available platform.

General outline
The general outline of the model is shown in Figure 1. It operates using a scenario of COVID hospital
admission demand in weekly time steps.
First, we modelled the expected age distribution of admissions. This was important as hospital and
intensive care admission rates and mortality varies substantially by age. Subsequently, the weekly
demand for intensive care and ward beds was modelled by age. The weekly availability of beds was

calculated using estimates of the number of free beds usually available in ICUs in England plus any surge
capacity and additional capacity freed by the cancellation of routine surgery, field hospitals and the use
of private facilities adjusted for the average duration of stay on ICU and in the ward in general.
We then compared the weekly demand for ward and ICU beds with the maximum number of beds
available. This allowed for the number of weekly admissions that fall within or outside of capacity.
Next, we calculated an estimate of the multiplier of the mortality rates when an ICU bed is not available
to someone who needs it, and similarly for general ward care. This was done by compartmentalizing
ward and ICU patients to categories of care for which estimates were made and then aggregated up to
the ward or ICU level again. The assumption is that the ICU mortality rate is multiplied by 1.99 if there is
no ICU bed available, but there is a ward bed, and by 9.02 if there is neither a ward not ICU bed
available. For general ward patients, the multiplier is 3.69 if there are no ward beds available. More
detail on the derivation of this is provided in the section on the “Excess Mortality Model” below.
Sensitivity testing indicated that results were not especially sensitive to small changes in these mortality
multipliers (+/- 20%).
Once mortality rates for ward and ICU patients both within and outside of capacity were calibrated, the
number of deaths occurring ‘within capacity’ and the number that occur directly as a result of being out
of capacity could be calculated. The number of ‘out of capacity’ deaths does not include the number of
deaths that would have been expected to occur if normal care had been received, and so represent
‘excess’ deaths occurring purely because the capacity limit was breached.

Description of each step in the modelling
We will now describe the purpose and workings of the model in more detail.
Principle parameters
The pre-pandemic (i.e. before March 2020) spare bed availability in the general wards is estimated at
9,769 and the ICU spare bed capacity as 817 beds from a study of hospital capacity in the COVID-19
pandemic by the Medical Research Council, Public Health England, The National Institute of Health
Research and Imperial College.(2) The same study estimated an additional 1,810 ICU beds and 52,498
beds could be acquired using field hospitals, the cancellation of routine care and the use of private
hospital facilities. In addition, there are pandemic response plans in place to increase ICU capacity with a
surge in demand. This surge capacity would be intended to increase ICU beds by 100% by using
anaesthetic rooms, operating theatres and other hospital resources.(3) Altogether this would increase
spare ICU capacity to 3,444 beds and spare ward capacity to 62,267 beds. These 62,267 ward beds can
provide for 87,174 patients weekly. These figures are based on an estimated length of stay on ICU of 7
days and length of stay on the general ward of 5 days.(5,6)

Estimating Admissions by Age
For this initial step, the age distribution of admissions was required in 5-year age bands up to the age of
80 years with one category for those 80-years and over. If this data is available directly, it can be applied
in the model. In ICUs, the age distribution is lower with an average age of 62 years and with only a small
proportion of over 80s being fit enough for invasive ventilation.(5) However, we estimated the

distribution of admissions for each age-band for each calendar week by fitting an exponential curve to
age-binned data on admission rates for adults, then interpolating admission rates for each year of age.
Using population estimates from 2019 for each year of age, estimates of the numbers of admissions
were made. These were then recalibrated so that the exact number of admissions in each age group
matched the observed numbers in each corresponding bin.
New patients in hospital
In this step, we applied the distribution of admissions by age to the weekly admission demand from the
scenarios to calculate the percentage of admissions accounted for by each year of age.
Splitting Admissions into ICU and Ward
Next, we calculated the proportion of admissions that require intensive care and ward care by age for
each 5-year age band, with one age bin for those aged 80 or over. This is done using data on the age
breakdown of admissions and total admission numbers to ICU from the ICNARC report of the 18th
December 2020, and the total number of COVID-19 hospital admissions up to the 18th December 2020
from the Gov.UK COVID-19 data dashboard.(7,8)
Ward Demand
In this step, we separated the weekly demand for general ward care by age into two tables; one for
those cared for within the expected hospital capacity, and a second for those who fail to receive any
hospital care when required because of no capacity.
ICU Demand
In this step we separated the weekly demand for ICU care by age into three tables; one for those cared
for within the expected ICU capacity, a second for those who receive only ward care when ICU care is
required because of no capacity, and a third for those who fail to receive any hospital care when
required.
Excess Mortality Model
In this step of the model, we estimated the multiplier of mortality risk for ward and ICU care COVID-19
patients when there is 1) no ICU capacity and 2) when there is neither ward nor ICU capacity. The output
from this sub-model is only dependent on the ‘hospitalised’ compartment and the modelling is not age
dependent. The proportion of patients requiring intensive care was taken from the results of the
modelling step “Splitting Admissions into ICU and Ward” (8%). Those receiving general ward care or ICU
care were segmented into the categories shown in Table 1. The distribution of ward care patients across
the care categories was populated using observation data from the Nottingham Universities Hospitals
Trust.(9) The proportion of ICU patients only requiring supportive care or high flow oxygen was also take
from the Nottingham data. The rest of the ICU categories were populated using data from
Southampton.(10)

The rationale behind the judgements used in the population of the mortality rate assumptions for each
care category and scenario are given in Table 2. They were made by Dr Chris Martin a former clinician
and the principal architect of this sub-model in conjunction with Dr Rahul Sarkar, Respiratory Physician
and Critical Care Consultant at the Medway Hospital Foundation NHS Trust.
The expected numbers of deaths in each category calculated using the assumed mortality rate and
weighted by the proportions in the categories using the formulae below.

𝑐=1 𝑑𝑒𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑠𝑐
ℎ𝑜𝑠𝑝

Where:
𝑞 = probability of dying in this episode of COVID-19
𝑑𝑒𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑠𝑐 = the number of deaths in the care category ‘c’.
ℎ𝑜𝑠𝑝 = the number of people hospitalised with COVID-19.
𝑚 = −(1 − 𝐿𝑁(1 − 𝑞))
Where:
𝑚 = hazard rate for death corresponding to the probability of dying in the scenario, and
𝐻𝑅 =

where 𝐻𝑅 = hazard ratio applied to 𝑚 to find the mortality rate in scenario ‘*’.

We estimated a hazard ratio of 1.99 for mortality in those needing ICU care when no ICU bed was
available but there was a ward bed and 9.02 when there is neither an ICU nor ward bed available. For
those needing ward care only, the hazard ratio is 3.69 when no hospital bed is available. Sensitivity

testing indicated that results were not especially sensitive to small changes in these hazard ratios (+/20%).
Ward Mortality – Treated
In this step, we estimated the in-capacity death rate by age in 5-year age bands interpolating from data
from the cumulative COVID-19 daily deaths report on the NHS England website and using the age
distributions for admissions calculated in the modelling step “Estimating Admissions by Age”.(13) Data
was harvested from the 6th November 2020 dataset as this precedes the peak of the second wave when
pressure may already have been building on internal hospital resources. After estimating the mid-points
of the age-bands, an exponential model is fitted to the death rates for the three age bands from age 40
upwards. This fitted model is then used to interpolate the death rates for the 5-year age bands required.
ICU Mortality – Treated
In this step, we calculated the in-capacity death rates by 5-year age bands in ICU. Data was taken from
the 6th November 2020 ICNARC report on COVID-19 in intensive care.(14) The death rate for each age
band was calculated from the sum of the product of the number of admissions for that age band, the
28-day in-hospital mortality rate and the total number of admissions for that age band. An exponential
model was then fitted to the data to which age bands had been applied in order to allow interpolation
and re-categorising by 5-year age-bands.

Mortality Rates
In this step we took the mortality rates by age calculated in the previous two modelling steps and the
hazard ratios from the ‘Excess Mortality Model’ step to calculate the mortality rates when no ICU beds
and no ward beds are available respectively. The mortality rate under the scenario ‘*’ is calculated using
the equation:
𝑞 ∗ = 1 − (1 − 𝑞)𝐻𝑅
Where:
𝑞 = the death rate in the in-capacity scenario.
𝐻𝑅 = the hazard ratio in scenario ‘*’.
𝑞 ∗ = the death rate in the scenario ‘*’.

Deaths - In capacity
In this step, we calculated the number of deaths each week from the corresponding number of
admissions generated by the ‘Ward Demand’ and ‘ICU Demand’ steps and the in-capacity mortality rates
from the previous ‘Mortality Rates’ step. Observed data is used up to the 9th December 2020, with ICU
deaths calculated as 15% of the total number of deaths (as there are significant delays in reporting the
deaths in the ICNARC data).
Deaths - Outside capacity
In this step, we calculated the numbers of deaths arising each week as a direct result of failing to get an
ICU or ward bed. Observed data is used up to the 9th December 2020. A series of seven calculations were
used:
1. The number of deaths in ICU within capacity as the dot product of the vector of ICU demand
within ICU capacity by age from step 'ICU Demand' and the vector of mortality rates from step
‘Mortality Rates’.
2. The number of deaths in patients requiring ICU care where only ward care was available, as the
dot product of the vector of ICU demand outside ICU by age from step 'ICU Demand' and the
vector of mortality rates from step ‘Mortality Rates’.
3. The number of deaths in patients requiring ICU care where neither ward nor ICU care was
available as the dot product of the vector of ICU demand outside both ICU and ward by age from
step 'ICU Demand' and the vector of mortality rates from step ‘Mortality Rates’.
4. The number of deaths in patients requiring ward care only as the dot product of the vector of
ward demand within ward capacity by age from step 'Ward Demand' and the vector of mortality
rates from step ‘Mortality Rates’.
5. The number of deaths in patients requiring ward care where ward care was not available as the
dot product of the vector of ward demand outside ward capacity by age from step 'Ward
Demand' and the vector of mortality rates from step ‘Mortality Rates’.
6. The total number of deaths each week under the current scenario including both ICU and ward
deaths as the sum of all results in steps 1-5 above.
7. The total number of deaths in each calendar week in both the ICU and ward care groups
calculated in the step ‘Deaths - In capacity’ was taken and subtracted from the capacity
constrained total in step 6 above to provide the number of deaths arising as a direct result of
the lack of an ICU or ward bed.

Scenarios
We applied three scenarios for admission demand from the week beginning 16th December 2020
through to the week beginning 28th April 2021 (Figure 2). In this model, the three scenarios are referred
to as “Pessimistic”, “Middling” and “Optimistic” and were arbitrary but based on the trajectory of the
increase in the multiplier of admissions from one week to the next. The trajectory was calculated as a
linear regression of the last three weeks of the known data taken from the GOV.UK Coronavirus
dashboard.(7) They are illustrative scenarios and not forecasts.

In the Middling scenario, the multiplier continued to increase following the rate over the previous 3
weeks up to three weeks post the introduction of more vigorous countermeasures on 19th December
2020. This is to be expected as the incubation period is nearly a week, so the enhanced
countermeasures would usually take at least a week to result in any observed change. The multiplier
falls below 1.0 after 4 more weeks. The emergence of a new variant of SARS-CoV-2 with higher
transmission rates that became more prevalent from the beginning of December has driven more rapid
growth of infection rates. As the new variant makes up a greater proportion of new cases, the rate of
growth will continue to rise unless effectively mitigated. It remains uncertain at the time of writing how
it will respond to tighter controls, but there is no reason to assume the mortality rates will differ at
present. At the time of writing this new variant has only recently been identified and has not been
factored into the analysis. However, initial indications are that this variant could open up a variety of
more pessimistic scenarios in the short term.
In the Optimistic scenario, the multiplier begins to decelerate from week beginning 16th December,
continues to decelerate after the 16th December and falls below 1.0 after 3 weeks.
In the Pessimistic scenario, the multiplier continued to increase for 4 weeks after week beginning 16th
December before decelerating at the same rate as the other two scenarios. This is not intended as a
worst-case scenario, but one that is somewhat worse than the ‘Middling’ scenario.

Sensitivity analysis
We performed an analysis to assess the sensitivity of the model to the choice of capacity and hazard
ratio parameter values and scenario. Five input parameters were varied independently in turn and the
effect on the model output recorded. The five parameters varied were the ICU and ward capacities and
the hazard ratios for mortality in ward patients when there are no ward beds available and ICU patients

This model has been populated with data specific to England, it could be applied in other geographies
and we have added ways of estimating some data like the age distribution of admissions or the ICU
admission rates by age. Where this data is directly available it can be substituted.
Assumptions
There are several general underlying assumptions to the model.
•
•
•

•
•
•
•
•
•
•

There is no change in the expected mortality as demand grows until the bed capacity is
breached.
Only bed capacity affects excess mortality rates and not other resource constraints such as
staffing, equipment, ambulance availability or other finite resources.
Health care policy and conscious or unconscious clinician behaviour that may affect the
compartments of care through which the patients flow does not change as the pandemic waxes
and wanes.
Surge capacity will be applied before the use of field hospitals or the commandeering of private
facilities.
All the surge capacity, field hospital and private facility beds will be utilised for COVID-19 rather
than any other demand.
The age distribution of admissions remains constant over time.
There is perfect redistribution of bed capacity and resources across the country immediately
according to demand.
Weekly bed availability remains constant.
Capacity estimates are fixed throughout the model when, in fact, new resources may be
recruited over time, or capacity may fall in response to disruption of staffing and supplies.
The mortality rates, including by age, are the same for the old COVID strain and novel
mutations.

Table 4 and Error! Reference source not found.. None of the Optimistic scenario adjustments resulted in
any excess deaths, and in the Middling scenario adjustments, the excess deaths attributable to lack of
capacity alone ranged from 0 to 597 with a 20% reduction in the expected number of ward beds. In the
Pessimistic scenario the number of excess deaths attributable directly to lack of capacity range from
49,219 with a 20% increase in the number of ward beds, and 103,845 with a 20% reduction in the
expected ward bed availability.
The results can be explained by considering how capacity evolves in each of the scenarios. In the
Middling scenario, whilst ICU capacity may be approached and even possibly breached, there remains
sufficient ward capacity to take lives who need either ward or ICU support, keeping excess deaths
relatively low. However, the Pessimistic scenario sees ward capacity breached, and in many scenarios
for a period of several weeks, resulting in much higher mortality in those lives who require care but do
not receive it. ICU capacity is much lower than ward capacity and only a small proportion of all
hospitalized patients need ICU care so the number of deaths from breaches of ward capacity are
proportionally larger than breaches for ICU care. ICU care is assumed to reach capacity before ward
care, so with marginal breaches of capacity, ICU breaches are the source of the excess deaths, but with
large breaches of capacity, the majority will arise from breaching of ward capacity.
The number of excess deaths is most sensitive to ward bed availability in the pessimistic scenario with a
difference of 54,626 between the 20% increase and 20% decrease in the bed availability compared to
5,129 with the same variation in ICU bed availability. However, in the Middling scenario, the excess
deaths are most sensitive to ICU bed capacity with a difference of 597 with +/- 20% variation in the ICU
bed capacity estimate, with no difference arising from the ward bed capacity estimate.
These results are shown graphically in Figure 3. (Please note the different y-axis scales). Excess deaths
are clearly more sensitive to the availability of ICU or ward beds than to the adjustments in the hazard
ratios used here. The greatest loss of life occurs with a 20% reduction in the estimate of ward availability
in the pessimistic scenario with 103,845 (40.9% increase) excess deaths.

Discussion
In none of the Optimistic scenarios are there any deaths that occur as a direct result of lack of capacity.
Several of the ‘Middling’ scenario applications under sensitivity testing resulted in excess deaths directly
attributable to a lack of capacity. Most excess deaths arose when we modelled a 20% reduction
comparted to best estimate ICU capacity. This led to 597 deaths (0.7% increase).
All the ‘Pessimistic’ scenario applications under sensitivity analysis had excess deaths. These ranged
from 49,219 (19.4% increase) when we modelled a 20% increase in ward bed availability over the bestestimate, to 103,845 (40.9% increase) when we modelled a 20% shortfall in ward bed availability below
the best-estimate.

The Middling scenario entails a three-week projection of the rate of increase in the multiplier of cases
observed between 25th November 2020 and 9th. This would be consistent with the lag that occurs
because of the approximate one-week incubation period and testing lag from the 19th December 2020
when more restrictive social distancing measures were introduced in the form of Tier 4. A steady decline
is then applied so that the multiplier falls below ‘1’ after four weeks as may be expected after their
introduction. In the Pessimistic scenario, the rise in the multiplier continues until the first week of
January 2021 as might occur if there is poor compliance with social distancing over the Christmas
holiday.

Figure 3. Results of the sensitivity analysis.

The new variant of SARS-CoV-2 that emerged in the UK (VOC 202012/01) appears to be about 56% (95%
CI 50%-74%) more transmissible than the existing variants though there is no evidence that the
virulence is any different.(15) Alternative explanations for its rise in prevalence and the increased rate of
transmission observed since its appearance at the beginning of October were investigated including
“immune escape” where individuals previously infected return to susceptibility as a result of mutation of
key antigens, increased susceptibility amongst children, and a shorter generation time. None of these
alternative explanations fitted the data as well as increased infectiousness. In addition, a second variant
has emerged from South Africa (501Y.V2) which also appears to have greater transmissibility and an

increased viral load.(16) These unsettling developments increases uncertainty in the future trajectory of
hospital demand and open up a variety of significantly more pessimistic scenarios in the short term that
have not been possible to explore here.

Limitations
Here we list and discuss the limitations of the model:
•

•
•
•
•

The estimate of bed availability is determined using the mean length of stay on the ward or in
ICU. The distribution of occupants by length of stay will change over time which may result in a
slow consumption of capacity that is not captured in this model.
Mortality rates are affected by constraints other than just bed availability including staffing and
equipment.
The model will not capture the transition between low mortality with full capacity and the high
mortality from lack of a bed that arises from stressing of the system before capacity is absent.
Capacity estimates are fixed throughout the model when, in fact, new resources may be
recruited over time, or capacity may fall in response to disruption of staffing and supplies.
Age specific case fatality rates are assumed to be static, but in fact may change, either due to
changes in virulence or improvement in care.

Intensive care resources are constrained not only by bed availability but also by equipment and staffing.
A combination of all three is required for optimal care in ICU. In reality there isn’t a simple binary state
of presence or absence of these factors and skills. A degradation of equipment maintenance and
distribution as well as reductions in the effectiveness of staff, either because staff to patient ratios fall as
demand rises, or because of staff sickness due to COVID-19 or simply the physical and emotional fatigue
as the pandemic continues is also seen. The modelling by McCabe et al suggests that ICU capacity is first
constrained by bed availability, though lack of nurses and junior doctors is close behind.(2) They
included sickness absence rates taken from surveys of union members suggesting 15% of doctors were
off sick in the first wave and may under-estimate the impact of sickness on staffing overall at peak times
in the pandemic.(17) As the pandemic progresses, higher than anticipated absence due to sickness in
these groups could result in lack of limiting capacity before the lack of beds. Reorganisation within
hospitals may mitigate this by training other staff to support ICU work and thereby increasing ICU staff
to bed ratios.(18) One hospital managed to meet demand in the first wave, but reduced ICU nurse to
bed ratios from the normal pre-pandemic of 1:1 to 1:4.(4) Current guidance on nursing staff ratios
during the COVID-19 pandemic advocates a ratio of 1:2.(18)
Decision making may change in the face of increasing demand either with formal revisions of treatment
thresholds as resources become increasingly scarce or with the introduction of triaging. On a less formal
level, the heuristics used by clinicians in their everyday management of patients may vary as competing
pressures rise. For example, at times of abundant capacity, the thresholds for transferring patients into
ICU for a trial to see if a patient with poor chance of survival recovers with a short stay, may be lower
than when there is severe limitation on capacity.
An important but unrealistic assumption in the model is that there is perfect distribution of resources
with respect to demand across the country and that no patient is refused care whilst there remains a
bed anywhere in England. ICUs are organized into networks which facilitate the transfer of patients from
one hospital to another when ICU beds in a hospital run out, but even a delay of a few hours in

transferring a patient to an ICU bed can influence outcome. Furthermore, even in the case of bed
availability in a different hospital, it cannot be assumed that the patient in the referring and at-capacity
hospital may be fit enough to able to be transferred safely. All the ICUs in a network are likely to have
correlated demand and may all run out of space at the same time. In these circumstances, transfers
would need to be arranged between networks or regions and this would entail yet further delay and
challenges with consequent impact on outcomes.
It is notable that the sensitivity of the excess deaths to ICU capacity is much greater than it is to ward
bed capacity at marginal breaches of capacity, but that large scale breaches of capacity are more
sensitive to ward bed capacity. There are far more ward beds than ICU beds, and there is an assumption
that ICU capacity would be exhausted long before ward bed capacity.

Conclusions
Here we describe a demand and capacity model for general hospital and intensive care beds in the
context of the COVID-19 pandemic in England. The model allows a user to understand the excess
mortality impact arising as a direct consequence of capacity being breached under various scenarios or
forecasts of hospital admissions. The scenarios described in this paper are illustrative and are not
forecasts.
We estimated the number of excess deaths up to the end of April 2021 that would arise from lack of
capacity under different demand assumptions from the 16th December 2020. No excess deaths from
excess capacity would be expected under the ‘Optimistic’ assumptions of demand but would reach
between 49,219 and 103,845 under the ‘Pessimistic’ scenario. Without the new variant, exceeding
capacity for hospital and ICU beds was not the most likely outcome, but given the new variant it now
appears more plausible and if so would result in a substantial increase in the number of deaths from
COVID-19.
