Abstract
Background: There is a growing literature on the association of SARS-CoV-2 and other chronic
conditions, such as noncommunicable diseases. However, little is known about the impact of
coinfection with tuberculosis. We aimed to compare the risk of death and recovery, as well as
time-to-death and time-to-recovery, in COVID-19 patients with and without TB.
Methods: We created a 4:1 propensity score matched sample of COVID-19 patients without
and with tuberculosis, using COVID-19 surveillance data in the Philippines. We conducted a
longitudinal cohort analysis of matched COVID-19 patients as of May 17, 2020, following them
until June 15, 2020. The primary analysis estimated the risk ratios of death and recovery in
patients with and without tuberculosis. Kaplan-Meier curves described time-to-death and timeto-recovery stratified by tuberculosis status, and differences in survival were assessed using the
Wilcoxon test.

Results: The risk of death in COVID-19 patients with tuberculosis was 2.17 times higher than in
those without (95% CI: 1.40-3.37). The risk of recovery in COVID-19 patients with tuberculosis
was 25% lower than in those without (RR=0.75, 95% CI 0.63-0.91). Similarly, time-to-death was
significantly shorter (p=0.0031) and time-to-recovery significantly longer in patients with
tuberculosis (p=0.0046).

Conclusions: Our findings show that coinfection with tuberculosis increased morbidity and
mortality in COVID-19 patients. Our findings highlight the need to prioritize routine and testing
services for tuberculosis, although health systems are disrupted by the heavy burden of the
SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

Introduction
As of July 2020, the global burden of the COVID-19 pandemic has reached 15 million cases,
and has caused large-scale outbreaks in many countries [1]. The COVID-19 pandemic is a
substantial strain to healthcare systems worldwide, particularly in resource-limited settings with
high prevalence of comorbid conditions such as tuberculosis (TB). TB is a major cause of
morbidity and mortality, and caused 1.4 million deaths in 2018, the main global infectious cause
of death [2]. TB disproportionately affects low-and-middle income countries, where TB
epidemics are fueled by coinfection with HIV/AIDS [3] and multidrug resistance [4, 5]. The
pandemic has caused disruptions of TB treatment and programs [6, 7], which have
disproportionately impacted socially disadvantaged communities with TB [8]. In particular, fewer
patients have sought medical treatment for TB, research on TB has been reduced, availability of
drugs against TB has decreased, and there are issues regarding food supply and nutritional
support during the pandemic [9].

The COVID-19 outbreak in the Philippines is a continuing public health crisis, with 12,513
reported cases as of May 17, 2020. TB is also a major public health problem in the Philippines
with the third highest incidence of TB globally, and one million individuals have active TB [10].
Most of the research on SARS-CoV-2 has been conducted in high-income countries, and
studies suggest worse outcomes in COVID-19 patients with other respiratory diseases, such as
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [11, 12] and asthma [13]. However, little is
known about the impact of coinfection with TB on COVID-19 outcomes. Pulmonary TB causes
destruction of lung parenchyma [14], which may predispose COVID-19 patients with TB to
aggressive disease and high mortality. We hypothesized that COVID-19 patients with previous
or active TB may have worse clinical outcomes than those without. This study compares the risk
of and time-to-death and recovery in COVID-19 patients with and without TB coinfection in the
Philippines.

Materials and Methods
Data
Data was obtained from the Philippine national COVID-19 surveillance implemented and
managed by the Philippine Department of Health Epidemiology Bureau (DOH-EB). All data on
COVID-19 cases was de-identified, and data came from continuing surveillance efforts by DOHEB as part of an ongoing outbreak investigation. Thus, institutional review board approval was
deemed unnecessary. Part of the case data is publicly available through the DOH DataDrop
initiative [15].

Study Population
We included all reported COVID-19 cases in the Philippines as of May 17, 2020, following them
until June 15, 2020. COVID-19 cases were confirmed with positive real-time reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from laboratories accredited by the DOH and the Research
Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) [16]. Information on confirmed cases were collected using
structured interviews by the physician or nurse on duty at initial consultation as part of routine
surveillance using a case investigation form (CIF), filled out manually or electronically. We used
propensity score matching to create similar populations of COVID-19 patients with and without
previous and active TB. To create the propensity scores, we predicted the risk of having TB using
logistic regression with the potential confounders age, sex, and other comorbid conditions (COPD,
asthma, diabetes, hypertension, cancer, renal disease, cardiac disease, and autoimmune
disorders). We matched one COVID-19 patient with TB to four without, using nearest neighbor
matching of propensity scores, a caliper of 0.05, and with no replacement. For a secondary
analysis, we created a propensity score matched subsample of COVID-19 patients admitted to
hospital.

Exposure
Our main exposure of interest was confirmed TB, which was defined as a history of or a current
diagnosis of TB. Comorbidity data and death certificate data encoded as part of the CIF were
used to determine the status of the TB infection.

Outcomes
The two main outcomes of interest were (1) death and (2) recovery. We modelled this as a
dichotomous (yes/no) variable, as well as a time-to-event variable. The time-to-event variables
for both primary outcomes were the time from symptom onset to death or recovery. Death was
defined as deaths during active COVID-19 and declared as a death by the DOH-EB. Recovery
was defined as cases declared recovered by the DOH-EB based on criteria for testing, clinical
improvement, and additional days of quarantine. We assessed the time from hospital admission
to discharge in patients admitted to hospital with dates validated in medical records. Another
secondary outcome was the relative risk of admission in the propensity score matched sample.

Statistical analyses
Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the sample. Student´s t-test was used to assess
differences in age between patients with and without TB. Pearson chi-square test was used to
examine differences in gender, comorbidities, health status and admission status. The primary
analysis estimated the relative risks (risk ratios) of death and recovery with a modified Poisson
regression with a robust variance estimator and a log link.

Kaplan-Meier curves stratified by TB status were used to plot survival curves of the time-toevent variables. Non-parametric analysis of differences in survival between patients with and
without TB was done using the Wilcoxon test. Individuals were censored at their last date of
follow-up if they did not have the outcome of interest. For the analysis of time-to-recovery, we

censored subjects who were dead on the last day of administrative follow-up for the whole
sample. This was done to not raise the bias estimate of recovery by removing patients who died
as censored observations. All statistical analyses were conducted in R 4.0.0 [17].

Results
Propensity score matching
The initial unmatched sample consisted of 12,513 COVID-19 patients, of which 113 (1.0%) had
confirmed TB. Sex differed significantly between patients with and without TB (p=0.001), as well
as hypertension (p<0.001) and diabetes (p<0.006) (Supplementary Table 1). We removed all
patients with missing covariates on variables from the propensity score matching, including
seven TB patients, and 4,510 COVID-19 patients were included in the final propensity scorematched sample. The final matched sample consisted of 530 patients, with 106 cases with TB
cases and 424 without. Matching successfully created populations with similar baseline
characteristics (all p>0.05; Table 1). The mean age of the total sample was 48.9 years
(SD=18.88; 95% CI: 47.2-50.5), 68.9% were males, 13.4% (n=71) died, and 67.7% (n=359)
recovered. The unmatched sample of COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital consisted of
3,869 people, of which 70 (1.8%) had confirmed TB. In the propensity score matched cohort of
admitted patients, three TB patients had missing covariates, and one TB patient had no control
match. The final subsample included 66 TB patients and 264 matched controls with similar
baseline characteristics (all p>0.05; Table 1).

Patients with TB had 2.17 times higher risk of death than those without (95% CI: 1.40-3.37).
When assessed in hospitalized patients, those with TB had a similar higher risk of death
(RR=2.25, 95% CI: 1.35-3.75). The risk of recovery in patients with TB was 25% lower than in
those without (RR=0.75, 0.63-0.91). The risk of recovery was similar in admitted patients, but

not significant (RR=0.84, 95% CI: 0.68-1.06). There was a 20% higher risk of admission in
patients with TB (RR=1.20, 95% CI: 1.04-1.38) (Table 2).

Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (Figure 1) showed that the time-to-death in patients with TB was
significantly shorter than in those without for both the propensity score matched sample
(p=0.0031) and in the subsample of admitted patients (p=0.0052). The time-to-recovery in
patients with TB was significantly longer than in those without (full sample p=0.0046; admitted
only p=0.02) (Figure 1). The time-to-admission did not differ significantly (p=0.17).

Discussion
The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic poses a challenge for TB prevention and treatment
worldwide. Our findings showed that COVID-19 patients with TB had a two-fold increased risk of
death, and were less likely to recover. Moreover, time-to-death was shorter and time-torecovery longer than in patients without TB. Given that SARS-CoV-2 has caused a substantial
number of deaths worldwide (greater than 600,000 deaths by July 2020) [1], some of the deaths
can be attributable to the increased risk of death and slower recovery in COVID-19 patients with
TB. These deaths can be prevented by continuing to provide essential TB services, particularly
in countries with high TB burden, where TB cases need to continue to be correctly diagnosed
and promptly treated. Moreover, our finding suggests that areas with greater TB burden would
have higher case fatality rates of COVID-19, which is important for public health planning and
resource allocation. As COVID-19 cases are continuing to increase in many low and middle
income countries with high TB incidence, such as countries in Southern Africa, Latin America,
and Asia [1], mitigation strategies need to target individuals with TB in order to reduce the global
burden of COVID-19.

Our findings are consistent with preliminary findings from the Western Cape province of South
Africa, where COVID-19 patients with a current diagnosis had a 2.5 times higher risk of death,
and those with previous TB had a 50% higher risk [18]. Other studies have examined the
association between TB and COVID-19; a case-control study in China demonstrated an
increased susceptibility of TB patients to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and increased severity of
symptom development [19]. Several studies have also described the interrelationship of these
two diseases, such as assessing deaths in patients with TB and COVID-19 co-infection [20] and
the post-TB sequalae in a global cohort of TB patients with COVID-19 [21]. However, studies
with longer follow-ups and adequate sample size needed to make inferential comparisons are
limited. To our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal cohort study investigating the association
between COVID-19 and TB with sufficient sample size in a high-burden TB setting.

There are a number of limitations of the study. We used propensity score matching to adjust for
confounding factors. However, residual confounding could still be an issue for variables we did
not match. Specifically, we had no data on HIV/AIDs in our cohort, and this might have biased
our estimates since patients with TB are more likely to be infected with HIV. However,
propensity score matching on all specified comorbid conditions would reduce confounding
substantially, and any potential residual confounding would be limited. Moreover, as this data
was obtained from the Philippine national surveillance of COVID-19, some dates for the time-toevent outcomes were missing. In survival analyses, we excluded individuals with missing dates,
and conducted statistical tests to ensure that the confounder distribution of the included sample
for each time-to-event analysis did not differ significantly between patients with and without TB
(Supplementary Table 2). In addition, the main outcomes death and recovery could potentially
have some missing data; the survival analysis accounted for missing data by censoring on the
last day of follow-up for patients without the outcome. Furthermore, since the data was collected
as part of a larger surveillance effort, previous TB diagnosis and current TB disease were

aggregated as confirmed TB, and we were unable to distinguish between the effects of these
two groups; even so, the consistently strong effect size demonstrates the consequence of TB
and COVID-19 co-infection, adding to the body of evidence that TB worsens the prognosis of
COVID-19 patients. Additionally, in the interest of rapid reporting of scientific findings during a
pandemic, the patients were only followed up for a short period of time, and we were only able
to determine the short-term outcomes in TB cases with COVID-19. Future longitudinal cohort
studies need to establish the long-term outcomes among those coinfected with TB and COVID19.

Our results demonstrated a direct relationship between COVID-19 and TB, but SARS-CoV-2
also indirectly contributes to TB-related morbidity and mortality. COVID-19 has and will continue
to cause a substantial strain to healthcare systems worldwide, and high mortality is predicted for
TB patients due to TB program disruptions, diagnostic delays, treatment interruptions, and lack
of access to drugs [6, 7, 9]. Moreover, inaccessibility of health facilities and reduced ability to
pay for medical costs disproportionately affect socially disadvantaged populations,
compounding already existing health inequalities, particularly in countries with already
vulnerable health and economic systems [22]. Our findings highlight the need to continue
prioritizing routine and testing services for TB, despite disruptions in health and social systems
during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, since a large proportion of patients with TB are
coinfected with HIV, further research on the co-occurrence of these three infections, as well as
on other endemic communicable and noncommunicable diseases in high TB-burden countries,
is important for accurate assessment of the global burden of SARS-CoV-2. Future studies with
focus on the relationship between TB and COVID-19 are warranted to support appropriate
planning and resource allocation, as SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread around the world.
