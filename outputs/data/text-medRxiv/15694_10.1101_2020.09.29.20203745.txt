ABSTRACT
The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an urgent and unprecedented demand for testing – both
for diagnosis and prognosis. Here we explore the potential for using sebum, collected via
swabbing of a patient’s skin, as a novel sampling matrix to fulfil these requirements. In this
pilot study, sebum samples were collected from 67 hospitalised patients (30 PCR positive and
37 PCR negative). Lipidomics analysis was carried out using liquid chromatography mass
spectrometry. Lipid levels were found to be depressed in COVID-19 positive participants,
indicative of dyslipidemia. Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) modelling
showed promising separation of COVID-19 positive and negative participants when
comorbidities and medication were controlled for, with sensitivity of 75% and specificity of
81% in stratified subsets. Given that sebum sampling is rapid and non-invasive, this work
highlights the potential of this alternative matrix for testing for COVID-19.

1. Introduction
SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus, was identified by the World Health Organization as
originating in the Wuhan province of China in late 2019, 1,2 and causes Corona Virus Disease
2019 (COVID-19). Mass testing has been identified by the World Health Organisation as a key
weapon in the battle against COVID-19 to contain outbreaks and reduce hospitalisations.

Current approaches to testing require the detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA collected from
the upper respiratory tract via polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Whilst these types of tests
are easily deployable and highly selective for the virus, they suffer from a significant
proportion of false negative events; in addition, scarcity of reagents can be an issue for the
scale of testing required. Furthermore, currently deployed approaches carry no prognostic
information.
Approaches that measure the effect of the virus on the host (as opposed to direct
measurement of the virus itself) may offer a complementary solution in clinical or mass
testing settings; for example, one feasibility study has recently identified derangement of
breath biochemistry in COVID-19 patients.

4

As the coronavirus requires lipids for

reproduction, COVID-19 can be expected to disrupt the lipidome 5. Evidence of a dysregulated
lipidome has been observed in patients with COVID-19 via analyses of blood plasma;

6,7,8,9

dysregulation of the skin would also be consistent with the ability of canines to differentiate
COVID-19 positive and negative by smell. 10 Lipidomics therefore offers a promising route to
better understanding of - and potentially diagnosis for - COVID-19. Sebum is a biofluid
secreted by the sebaceous glands and is rich in lipids. A sample can be collected easily and
non-invasively via a gentle swab of skin areas rich in sebum (for example the face, neck or
back). Characteristic features have previously been identified from sebum for a limited

In

addition, whilst the mechanisms for the role of sebum in barrier function are not fully
described, sebum lipids barrier function directly and also through commensal bacteria
interactions; lipid dysregulation would have implications for skin health.

14

In this work, we

explore differences in sebum lipid profiles for patients with and without COVID-19, with a
view to exploring sebum’s future use as a non-invasive sampling medium for testing, as well
as expanding the understanding of sebum as a sampling matrix.
In May 2020 several UK bodies announced their intention to pool resources and form the
COVID-19 International Mass Spectrometry (MS) Coalition.

15

This consortium has the

proximal goal of providing molecular level information on SARS-CoV-2 in infected humans,
with the distal goal of understanding the impact of the novel coronavirus on metabolic
pathways in order to better diagnose and treat cases of COVID-19 infection. This work took
place as part of the COVID-19 MS Coalition and all data will be stored and fully accessible on
the MS Coalition open repository.
2. Methods
2.1 Participant recruitment and ethics
Ethical approval for this project (IRAS project ID 155921) was obtained via the NHS Health
Research Authority (REC reference: 14/LO/1221). The participants included in this study were
recruited at NHS Frimley Park NHS Trust, totalling 67 participants. Collection of the samples
was performed by researchers from the University of Surrey at Frimley Park NHS Foundation
Trust hospitals. Participants were identified by clinical staff to ensure that they had the
capacity to consent to the study, and were asked to sign an Informed Consent Form; those
that did not have this capacity were not sampled. Consenting participants were categorised

by the hospital as either “query COVID” (meaning there was clinical suspicion of COVID-19
infection) or “COVID positive” (meaning that a positive COVID test result had been recorded
during their admission). All participants were provided with a Patient Information Sheet
explaining the goals of the study.
2.2 Sample collection, inactivation and extraction
Patients were sampled immediately upon recruitment to the study. This meant that the range
in time between symptom onset and sebum sampling ranged from 1 day to > 1 month, an
inevitable consequence of collecting samples in a pandemic situation. Each participant was
swabbed on the right side of the upper back, using 15 cm by 7.5 cm gauzes that had each
been folded twice to create a four-ply swab. The surface area of sampling was approximately
5 cm x 5 cm, pressure was applied uniformly whilst moving the swab across the upper back
for ten seconds. The gauzes were placed into Sterilin polystyrene 30 mL universal containers.
Samples were transferred from the hospital to the University of Surrey by courier within 4
hours of collection, whereupon the samples were then quarantined at room temperature for
seven days to allow for virus inactivation. Finally, the vials were transferred to minus 80°C
storage until required. Alongside sebum collection, metadata for all participants was also
collected covering inter alia sex, age, comorbidities (based on whether the participant was
receiving treatment), the results and dates of COVID PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests,
bilateral chest X-Ray changes, smoking status, and whether the participant presented with
clinical symptoms of COVID-19. Values for lymphocytes, CRP and eosinophils were also taken
- here the most extreme values during the hospital admission period were recorded. These
were not collected concomitantly with the sebum samples.

The extraction, storage and reconstitution of the obtained samples followed Sinclair E, Trivedi
D, Sarkar D, et al. 16 Samples were analysed over a period of five days. Each day consisted of
a run incorporating solvent blank injections (n=5), pooled QC injections (n=3), followed by 16
participant samples (triplicate injections of each) with a single pooled QC injection every six
injections. Each day’s run was completed with pooled QC injections (n=2) and solvent blanks
(n=3). A triplicate injection of a field blank was also obtained.
2.3 Instrumentation and software
Analysis of samples was carried out using a Dionex Ultimate 3000 HPLC module equipped with
a binary solvent manager, column compartment and autosampler, coupled to a Orbitrap QExactive Plus mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, UK) at the University of Surrey‘s
Ion Beam Centre. Chromatographic separation was performed on a Waters ACQUITY UPLC
BEH C18 column (1·7 µm, 2·1 mm x 100 mm) operated at 55 ºC with a flow rate of 0·3 ml min -1.
The mobile phases were as follows: mobile phase A was acetonitrile:water (v/v 60:40) with
0·1% formic acid, whilst mobile phase B was 2-propanol:acetonitrile (v/v, 90:10) with 0·1%
formic acid (v/v). An injection volume of 5 µL was used. The initial solvent mixture was 40%
B, increasing to 50% B over 1 minute, then to 69% B at 3·6 minutes, with a final ramp to 88%
B at 12 minutes. The gradient was reduced back to 40% B and held for 2 minutes to allow for
column equilibration. Analysis on the Q-Exactive Plus mass spectrometer was performed in
split-scan mode with an overall scan range of 150 m/z to 2 000 m/z, and 5 ppm mass accuracy.
Split scan was chosen to extend the m/z range from 150 to 2 000 m/z whilst maximising the
number of features identified 17,18. MS/MS validation of features was carried out on Pooled
QC samples using data dependent acquisition mode. Operating conditions are summarised in
Table S1 (Supplementary Information).

2.4 Materials and chemicals
The materials and solvents utilised in this study were as follows: gauze swabs (Reliance
Medical, UK), 30 mL SterilinTM tubes (Thermo Scientific, UK), 10 mL syringes (Becton
Dickinson, Spain), 2 mL microcentrifuge tubes (Eppendorf, UK), 0.2 µm syringe filters (Corning
Incorporated, USA), 200 µL micropipette tips (Starlab, UK) and QsertTM clear glass insert LC
vials (Supelco, UK). OptimaTM (LC-MS) grade methanol was used as an extraction solvent, and
OptimaTM (LC-MS) grade methanol, ethanol, acetonitrile and 2-propanol were used to prepare
injection solvents and mobile phases. Formic acid was added to the mobile phase solvents at
0.1% (v/v). Solvents were purchased from Fisher Scientific, UK.
2.5 Data processing
LC-MS outputs (.raw files) were pre-processed for alignment, normalisation and peak
identification using Progenesis QI (Non-Linear Dynamics, Waters, Wilmslow, UK), a platformindependent small molecule discovery analysis software for LC-MS data. Peak picking (mass
tolerance ±5 ppm), alignment (RT window ±15 s) and area normalisation was carried out with
reference to the pooled QC samples. Features identified in MS were initially annotated using
accurate mass match with Lipid Blast in Progenesis QI, whilst validation was performed using
data dependent MS/MS analysis using LipidSearch (Thermo Fisher Scientific, UK) and
Compound Discoverer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, UK). This process yielded an initial peak table
with 14,160 features. All those features with a coefficient of variation across all pooled QCs
above 20% were removed, as were those that were not present in at least 90% of pooled QC
injections. These features were then field blank adjusted: all those features with a signal to
noise ratio below 3x were also rejected. The remaining set of 998 features were deemed to
be robust, reproducible and suitably distinct from those found in the field blank.

Inclusion criteria were also applied to participant data, requiring both full completion of
metadata and also agreement between the result of the PCR COVID-19 test (Y/N) and the
clinical diagnosis for COVID-19 (Y/N). Whilst these inclusion criteria reduced the total number
of participants from n=87 to n=67, this was considered worthwhile given the potential for
misdiagnosis to confound the development of statistical models.

Data processing and analysis of the pareto-scaled peak:area matrix was conducted through a
combination of the R package mixOmics,

data. Separation and classification was based on mahalabonis distance between
observations. Leave-one-out cross-validation was used for PLS-DA model validation to test
accuracy, sensitivity and specificity; variable importance in projection (VIP) scores were used
to assess feature significance.
3. RESULTS

There were more male participants in the COVID-19 positive group (M:F ratio of 0·57)
compared to the participant population overall (M:F ratio of 0·52); given recruitment took
place in a hospital environment, this may reflect increased severity amongst males.

Age

distributions for COVID-19 positive and negative cohorts were almost identical (mean age of
64·7 years and 65·0 years respectively). Comorbidities are associated with both
hospitalisation and more severe outcomes for COVID-19 infection, but will also alter the
metabolome of participants, representing both a causative and confounding factor. The
impact on classification accuracy of these comorbidities was tested by stratifying participant
data by comorbidity to see if separation improved; this process is described in the following

sections. In this pilot study, comorbidities were less well represented in the cohort of COVID19 positive participants than in the cohort of COVID-19 negative participants.
Levels of C-Reactive Protein (CRP) were significantly higher for COVID-19 participants, whilst
lymphocyte and eosinophils levels were lower. A two-tailed Mann Whitney U test on the CRP
indicator provided a p-value of 0·031, and on the lymphocytes a p-value of 0·004. Effect
sizes (calculated by Cohen's D) were 0·56 and 0·85 respectively. COVID-19 positive
participants were also more likely to present with bilateral chest X-ray changes (21 out of 30
COVID-19 positive patients, versus 2 out of 37 COVID-19 negative patients). COVID-19 positive
participants experienced higher rates of requiring oxygen / CPAP, higher rates of escalation,
and lower survival rates. These observations were in agreement with literature descriptions
of COVID-19 symptoms and progression. 22
3.2 Overview of features identified by Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS)
998 features were identified reproducibly by LC-MS (present in greater than 90% of pooled
QC LC-MS injections, coefficient of variation below 20% across pooled QCs, signal to noise
ratio greater than three) and these formed the basis of the analysis in this work. Differences
between COVID-19 positive and negative participants were observed across a range of lipids
and metabolites, with the most consistent difference seen in reduced lipid levels, especially
triglycerides (Figure 1).

Figure 1: Volcano plot of features for COVID-19 positive (n=30) versus negative (n=37),
labelled features validated by MS/MS, points scaled to significance
Aggregate levels of triglycerides identified by MS/MS were depressed for COVID-19 positive
participants, and also for ceramides, albeit fewer lipids of the latter class were identified and
validated. The distributions of the natural log of aggregated lipid ion counts by class were not
characterised as normal by Shapiro-Wilk normality tests. 23 Two-tailed Mann-Whitney U-tests
were performed to test the significance of aggregate levels of these lipid classes. These
resulted in p-values of 0·022 and 0·015 for triglycerides and ceramides respectively, with
effect sizes (calculated by Cohen's D) of 0·44 and 0·57, indicative of medium effect size. These
results are suggestive of dyslipidemia within the stratum corneum due to COVID-19. The
alteration in levels of triglycerides between positive and negative cohorts is comparable to
that for CRP or for lymphocytes as indicators of COVID-19 status (Figure 2).

Figure 2: Boxplots of diagnostic indicators versus triglyceride levels
Other work has found evidence of dyslipidemia in plasma from COVID-19 positive
patients, 7,6,9 although evidence of whether upregulation or downregulation is dominant for
these lipid classes is mixed. Plasma triglyceride (TAG) levels have been found to be elevated
in blood plasma for mild cases of COVID-19, but TAG levels in plasma may also decline as the
severity of COVID-19 increased. 24
It should be remembered, however, that the primary role of skin is barrier function, and lipid
expression in the stratum corneum depends on de novo lipogenesis – in fact nonskin sources
such as plasma provide only a minor contribution to sebum lipids, 25 which limits the relevance
of broader pathway analysis to this biofluid. To the extent that the virus sequesters lipids for
its own reproduction, it is possible that this causes deficiency in the expression of sebum
lipids.

3.3 Population-level clustering analyses
No clustering was identifiable at the total population level by principal component analysis
(PCA), i.e. by unsupervised analysis. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA)
performed on the same data set revealed limited separation (Figure 3), with the area under
the receiver operating curve (AUROC) over two components of 0.88. AUROC can be inflated
when only used on a single training data set, and so a confusion matrix was constructed using
a leave-one-out approach. Validating accuracy in this way (Table 2) showed sensitivity of just
57% and specificity of 68%. Given the wide range of comorbidities, this is not unexpected.

Figure 3: PLS-DA plot for 67 participants, classified by COVID-19 positive / negative
3.4 Investigation of confounding factors
To test the impact of age and diagnostic indicators (CRP, lymphocytes and eosinophils), these
variables were pareto-scaled and included in the matrix for PLS-DA modelling. Variable
importance in projection (VIP) scores for lymphocytes, CRP, and eosinophils were 2·47, 1·77
and 0.72 respectively, ranking 1, 90 and 465 out of 1,002 total features. As a single feature,
depressed lymphocyte levels show high correlation with COVID-19 positive status, consistent
with lymphocyte count being both a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker. 26 Age as a vector
had a VIP score of just 0·05 (ranking 958 out of 1,002 total features), indicating that age is a
smaller influencer of stratum corneum lipids than other factors.
Overall, PLS-DA separation improved by the addition of lymphocyte and CRP indicators, with
slight model accuracy increases when these two variables were included in the feature matrix
(from 62% to 64% accuracy for the overall population, for example). Given that this work
focuses on sebum sampling, however, in the analyses that follow only features obtained from
sebum are included, i.e. information from other diagnostic indicators is excluded from
classification models.
To test whether separation based on sebum alone would improve in smaller / more
homogenous groups, separate PLS-DA models were built for each split of the population by
comorbidity. If model performance improved (measured by predictive power - Q2Y - and
sensitivity and specificity via leave-one-out cross validation) then this could indicate that
sebum lipid profiling would perform better if models were constructed based on stratified
and matched datasets. Table shows the results for these metrics across the different
modelled subsets.

Separation generally improved as the data were grouped more finely and modelled predictive
power improved. Based on a weighted mean average for these subsets, sensitivity improved
to 75% and specificity improved to 81%. For example, PLS-DA modelling of the subset of
participants under medication for hypertension (Figure 4) showed both good separation and
better sensitivity and specificity (Table 4). These data suggest that comorbidities are
confounders in skin lipidomics.

Figure 4: PLS-DA plot for 15 participants with hypertension, COVID-19 positive / negative
Similarly, PLS-DA modelling of the subset of participants under medication for high
cholesterol showed good separation (Figure S1, Supplementary Information), with sensitivity
of 100% and specificity of 80%. This subgroup was treated with lipid-lowering agents,
specifically statins. The subgroup comprising participants undergoing treatment for ischemic
heart disease (IHD) also showed much better separation (Figure S2, Supporting Material),
with better overall accuracy, with sensitivity and specificity of 50% and 86% respectively. This
subgroup received varied medication, but participants presenting with IHD were also being
prescribed statins. Finally, the subset of participants under medication for T2DM (Figure 4)
also showed both good separation and better sensitivity and specificity (of 71% and 75%
respectively). This subgroup was typically being treated with oral hypoglycaemics, for
example metformin, in some cases with insulin and in some instances with diet control only.
Model performance (Figure S4, Supporting Material) also improved versus the base
population for a stratified dataset based on those participants taking statins (sensitivity of
55% and specificity of 90%). Given that statins control cholesterol and lipid levels, this may

have provided a more similar “baseline” against which to measure perturbance in the
lipidome by COVID-19; patients taking statins which included both participants treated for
high cholesterol and also participants with poor diabetic control or history of ischaemic heart
disease, where statins are routinely added prophylactically to improve long-term outcomes.
Looking across the models, there was commonality in the features identified as significant in
differentiating between COVID-19 positive and negative. Many features featured in all
subsets with VIP scores above 2 (dark grey in Figure 5), but others did not, a possible indicator
of overfitting due to the smaller groups when stratified. Where overlap does occur between
the features, this may reflect the natural overlap between the subset populations, for
example the subsets of participants presenting with ischaemic heart disease and with high
cholesterol are largely subsets of the participants receiving treatment by statins.
Of the features with the highest common VIP scores, the two highest were triglycerides TG(16.1/21.0/22.6) and TG(17.0/22.1/22.6) – as were eight of the highest twenty, consistent
with previous observations that dysregulation of lipids, especially triglycerides, is a
distinguishing feature of COVID-19’s impact on the skin.

4. Discussion
At the aggregate level, analysis of the metadata for the participants in this study illustrates
the challenges involved in constructing a well-designed sample set during a pandemic. Age
ranges of participants were large, and a wide range of comorbidities were present, leading to
many confounding factors. Definitive separation has not proved possible in this pilot study,
given that too few datapoints were available to rigorously stratify by medication or by
comorbidity. Nonetheless, at the aggregate level, participants with a positive clinical COVID19 diagnosis present with depressed lipid levels (triglycerides and ceramides in particular),
with the possibility of reduced barrier function and skin health. Furthermore, these findings
suggest that better stratification of participants could yield a clearer separation of positive
and negative COVID-19 participants by their lipidomic profile. The overall accuracy in the
stratified groups of 79% is comparable to that recently reported using breath biochemistry of
81%, 4 albeit overfitting is a risk in any pilot study with small n. This risk can only be reduced
through both a larger training set of data and subsequently testing the models on future
validation sets, made possible through cohesive efforts such as the work of the MS Coalition.

Another point to note is a possible lack of confounders in the participant population from
seasonal respiratory viruses. Whilst the COVID-negative patients included patients with
respiratory illnesses (e.g. COPD, asthma) and COVID-like symptoms, samples were collected
between May and July, when the incidence of respiratory viruses is generally low. Both the
common cold and influenza have some symptoms overlap with COVID-19 and may possibly
lead to alterations to lipid metabolism that could interfere with the identification of features
related to COVID-19 infection. Such viruses within the UK are more prevalent in autumn and
winter. 27 Whilst it seems unlikely that seasonal respiratory viruses were a major confounding
factor in this work, this is a factor that will need to be taken into account in future studies,
and may also allow the opportunity to test sebum’s selectivity and specificity with regard to
other respiratory viruses.
In conclusion, we provide evidence that COVID-19 infection leads to dyslipidemia in the
stratum corneum. We further find that the sebum profiles of COVID positive and negative
patients can be separated using the multivariate analysis method PLS-DA, with the separation
improving when the patients are segmented in accordance with certain comorbidities. Given
that sebum samples can be provided quickly and painlessly, we conclude that sebum is worthy
of future consideration for clinical sampling for COVID-19 infection.
