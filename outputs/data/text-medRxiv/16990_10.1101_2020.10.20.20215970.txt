Abstract
BACKGROUND
The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance characteristics of early
commercial SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays in mild and asymptomatic subjects to enable the
selection of suitable serological assays for routine diagnostic use within HCA Healthcare UK.
METHODS
We used serum samples from a pre-Covid era patient cohort (n=50, pre-December 2019),
designated SARS-CoV-2 negative, and serum samples from a SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCRpositive cohort (n=90) taken > 14 days post symptom onset (April-May 2020). We evaluated
6 ELISA assays including one confirmation assay to investigate antibody specificity. We
also evaluated one point-of-care lateral flow device and one high throughput
electrochemiluminescence immunoassay.
RESULTS
The ELISA specificities ranged from 84-100%, with sensitivities ranging from 75.3-90.0%.
The LFIA showed 100% specificity and 80% sensitivity using smaller sample numbers. The
Roche CLIA immunoassay showed 100% specificity and 90.7% sensitivity. When used in
conjunction, the Euroimmun nucleocapsid (NC) and spike-1 (S1) IgG ELISA assays had a
sensitivity of 95.6%. The confirmation IgG assay showed 92.6% of samples tested contained
both NC and S1 antibodies, 32.7% had NC, S1 and S2 and 0% had either S1 or S2 only.
CONCLUSIONS
These first generation assays were not calibrated against reference material and the results are
reported qualitatively. The Roche assay and the Euroimmun NC and S1 assays had the best
sensitivity overall in our hands. Combining the assays detecting NC and S1/S2 antibody

be necessary in any future studies of herd and vaccine induced immunity.

Introduction
The current worldwide coronavirus pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in millions of confirmed infections and cases of
the associated COVID-19 disease.1
The clinical manifestations of acute infection vary widely from asymptomatic disease to
severe viral pneumonia and lung failure2,3 and the extent of subsequent chronic organ damage
and COVID-19 disease remains to be established. A definitive diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2
infection currently relies on the use of RT-PCR to identify the virus in respiratory samples 4-6.
This only identifies current illness or a viral carriage. The performance of the RT-PCR test is
dependent on various factors including time of sampling, viral load and how thoroughly the
sample is taken from the nasopharynx; its estimated sensitivity varies and falls around 8085%.7 Consequently, a significant proportion of infected individuals may be missed from
screening programmes.8 In contrast, robust serology assays which reliably detect the presence
of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, can determine whether individuals with or without
symptoms have previously been infected, thus providing valuable information about prior
exposure for epidemiological purposes and the individual patient.9,10
The introduction of serological testing to HCA Healthcare UK was rapidly implemented in
April 2020 to cover a variety of scenarios ahead of National Policy. A strategic decision was
taken to roll out a healthcare worker screening programme for purposes of staff and patient
protection, and to have a robust assay in place in anticipation of evolving national or local
guidance. Accordingly, we scanned the first-generation antibody assay horizon for candidate
tests we could rollout into routine laboratory diagnostics.
During the early months of the pandemic, numerous SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays were
rapidly developed and placed on the market. These assays used different antigenic proteins;

some used whole virus lysate, recombinant nucleocapsid (NC) or full spike (S) proteins,
while some use modified proteins or peptides of the NC or specific domains of the S protein
- glycoprotein 1 (S1), spike glycoprotein 2 (S2) or RBD (receptor-binding domain).
In this study we initially evaluated the analytical performance of CE marked IgG ELISAs and
a lateral flow device, selected based on the availability in the UK at the time. We later
compared these to the analytical performance of the Roche “total antibody by
electrochemiluminescence (CLIA) immunoassay”, chosen because the platform for the Roche
assay (the Cobas system) is already in place at HCA Laboratories.

Materials and methods
Sample set
In total, 140 patient serum samples were obtained from the Serology and Immunology
Departments within HCA laboratories during March and April 2020.

Specificity cohort:
50 pre-COVID era samples taken before December 2019 were collected from the Serology
Department, kept frozen at -20oC.

Sensitivity cohort:
10 serum samples from adult hospitalised patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection
(days post symptoms: mean 21.2 days, range 15 - 33) were obtained from excess serum
samples sent to the Serology Department in March 2020.
A further 80 serum samples from healthcare workers (HCW) employed by HCA and proven
to have had SARS-CoV-2 infection by viral nucleic acid detection (RT-PCR) from an upper
respiratory tract (nasopharyngeal) swab were tested in an accredited laboratory.
Serum was taken from these individuals after their return to work and after two negative
swab tests by RT-PCR, having isolated for 2 weeks after their confirmed RT-PCR positive
result. Staff were asked to report the date of onset of Covid-19 associated symptoms. In all
cases, sensitivity cohort samples were taken > 14 days post symptom onset to optimise
detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Seventeen (17%) subjects were asymptomatic and
sixty-three (63%) had mild symptoms.
The study was an audit of routine sera and was reviewed by the local HCA Audit and
Research Committee. All samples were anonymised, and written consent was obtained from

the HCW individuals for the audit. Consent is not required for surplus samples used for
assay verification.

Methods
Lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA)
The LFIA was only evaluated for specificity using 20 of the pre-COVID era samples due to
the limited number of kits to hand. For sensitivity, 80 of the HCW samples were tested by
staff at HCA Primary Care facilities.
We used the COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test (CTK Biotech Inc, Poway, USA), performed in
accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. The test was accepted if the ‘C’ line
(control line) showed the appearance of a coloured band, with the result designated as either
positive (G and/or M band development) or negative (C line only).

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA)
We assessed 5 qualitative ELISAs and one confirmatory ELISA from 4 different
manufacturers as outlined below. All ELISA assays were run using the automated DS2
Analyser (Dynex® Technologies, Inc).
Due to the speed these assays were brought to market, they were not calibrated against any
reference material (e.g. IRP 67/86 of human serum immunoglobulins) or international
standards. ELISA results were qualitative and based on a calculated ratio (of the relative
antibody concentrations) set by the manufacturer or a “confidence index” assigned by the
manufacturer.

Epitope Diagnostics:
The EDITM Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 IgG ELISA kit (KT-1032, Epitope Diagnostics,
San Diego, USA) utilises a recombinant full length nucleocapsid protein to measure human
anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody in serum. The assay was run as per manufacturer’s
instructions and the results were calculated as recommended.

Euroimmun:
The Anti-SARS-CoV-2 NCP ELISA (IgG) and Anti-SARS CoV-2 S1 (IgG) ELISAs
(Euroimmun Medizinische Labordiagnostika, Lübeck, Germany; EI2606-9620-2G and
EI2606-9601G respectively) were performed according to manufacturer’s instructions.
The NC assay wells are coated with modified nucleocapsid (NC) of SARS-CoV-2 which
according to the manufacturer contains “diagnostically relevant epitopes”, whereas the S1
assay wells are coated with an S1 domain of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 expressed in
the human cell line HEK 293.

Dia.Pro:
The Dia.Pro COVID-19 IgG ELISA and the COVID-19 IgG Confirmation ELISA kits
(Diagnostic Bioprobes Srl, Milan, Italy) are intended for use in conjunction as an initial
screen, and subsequent confirmatory assay, respectively, for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. The
Dia.Pro COVID-19 IgG ELISA contains a mix of recombinant “immunodominant antigens”
(nucleocapsid, S1 and S2) whereas the confirmation test is composed of individual wells
coated with these antigens and hence enables to determine antibody specificity against NC,
S1 and S2 present in the patient’s sample.

NovaLisa®:
NovaLisa® SARS-CoV-2 9 (Covid19) IgG ELISA (obtained from NovaTec
Immunodiagnostica Gmbh, Dietzenbach, Germany, product code COVG0940) utilises
microtiter plates coated with SARS-CoV-2 antigens (antigen names are not provided).

Chemiluminescent assay (CLIA)
The Roche Elecsys total antibody (IgG and IgM) assay was run on the Cobas® e801
analyser. The Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay is an electrochemiluminescence sandwich
immunoassay for qualitative detection of both IgG and IgM in human serum and plasma
against a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen.

Statistical analysis
For each method, sensitivity, specificity and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using
the R statistical computing environment11. A pairwise comparison was performed between
each unique combination of assays using a two-sample Z-test for equality of proportions. A
p-value of ≤0.01 was used as a threshold for significance to correct for multiple testing.

Results
Sensitivities and specificities
Four commercial anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA kits were evaluated initially, all of which
measured antibodies raised against the recombinant nucleocapsid (NC) antigen of the virus.
Subsequently, the Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG S1 ELISA, which measures antibodies
to the S1 (S) domain of the spike protein, became available and was included in the
evaluation.

Table 1 shows sensitivities and specificities of these 5 ELISA assays and the LFIA and
Roche CLIA assay. To maximise specificity and sensitivity for each ELISA, borderline
results were classified as negative for the EDI and DIA.PRO kits, and positive for the
Euroimmun and NOVALisa kits.

The 5 ELISA assays had specificities ranging from 84-100% and sensitivities ranging from
75.3-90.0%%. The LFIA showed 100% specificity and 79.5% sensitivity, although the small
sample sizes should be noted. The Roche CLIA immunoassay showed 100% specificity and
90.7% sensitivity.
The Roche assay and the Euroimmun NC and S1 assays had the best sensitivity overall, all
with 100% specificity and when combined, the Euroimmun NC and S1 assays had a
sensitivity of 95.6%. The Euroimmun ELISAs against 2 viral proteins were therefore chosen
as the ELISA(s) most appropriate for deployment.

Euroimmun assays
The sample cohorts were classified as hospital, mild disease and asymptomatic according to
details given at time of sampling. The results of the Euroimmun NC and S1 are shown in
Table 2 when grouped according to these classifications.

These results show that patients who had severe disease all had either S1 or NC antibodies
however the mild/asymptomatic cohort showed little difference between the groupings. Of
the HCW cohort, 17/80 (21.3%) were asymptomatic.

Discussion
We evaluated analytical performance characteristics of five commercial ELISAs, one POC
rapid test and the Roche CLIA immunoassay, in order to find a suitable assay to make SARSCoV-2 antibody testing available for routine diagnostic use for HCA Healthcare UK’s
COVID19 screening and diagnostic strategy. Our paper relates to an analytical evaluation and
from the immunological perspective; it does not imply that all subjects with positive RT-PCR
for SARS-CoV-2 will make virus specific antibodies. Immunological mechanisms of
humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 infection are still unclear and underlying conditions, e.g.
antibody deficiency, are not considered in this evaluation.
We used a cohort of pre-COVID19 era samples to assess specificity and a cohort of HCA
healthcare workers to assess and evaluate the analytical sensitivity of serological assays in
mild and asymptomatic disease.
We found that the ELISA assay with the highest sensitivity was the Euroimmun NC and S1
kits (90% and 88.9% respectively) and when used in combination, this increased sensitivity
to 95.6%.
The Roche Elecsys was found to have 100% (95%CI 83.4-100) specificity and 90.7%
(95%CI 81.1-95.8) sensitivity. These results were in accordance with another evaluation,
which found this assay had a specificity of 100% (95%Cl 99.1-100) and sensitivity of 86.1%
(95% Cl 76.5-92.8) for samples taken ≥14 days from symptom onset and 86.7% (95%CI
76.8-93.4) for samples taken ≥21 days since symptom onset.12
The Cobas® analyser is a fully automated high throughput platform. This platform,
established in our laboratories, potentially offered considerable logistic advantages to enable
rapid rollout of antibody testing not only for our staff, but also to ensure capacity for high

volumes of sample requests for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in our patients. These elements of
performance and surge capacity prompted our decisions to routinely choose the Roche assay.
We do not have the longitudinal antibody monitoring data to better inform the kinetics of the
antibody responses in our cohort. Similarly, we were not able to establish negative and
positive predictive values since the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection is an estimate and
was not known at the time of the study. Four percent of RT-PCR positive subjects had no
detectable antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 suggesting that not all otherwise healthy individuals
will mount humoral response to the virus. This has been noted by Shields et al.13 and several
research groups.
We noted significant differences in terms of assays sensitivity and specificity (NovaLisa
assay was the least sensitive (75%) and Dia.Pro was the least specific (84%) but the most
sensitive (92%)). There was significant variability between the assays with regards to the
individual sample result (positive/negative) as shown in Table 4. These differences can be
explained by several analytical variances between the assays, for example antigen type and
source and its immunogenicity. The antibody assays we evaluated used a variety of different
viral protein antigens, e.g. recombinant modified or full-length protein, mixed antigens or
antigens not specified (NovaLisa). It is well known that SARS-CoV-2 proteins have complex
3D structure and complex antigens purification process which is a hurdle for the
manufacturers who attempt a fast development of new immunoassays for the emerging
disease.14.
Potential assay interferences may lead to false positive immunoassay results. For example,
the Dia.Pro kit assay insert states that “10% of the reactive normal population collected
before the outbreak showed reactivity to nucleocapsid”. It remains to be established whether
this positivity in the Dia.Pro assay which uses “immunodominant recombinant antigens” is

due to cross-reactivity with other Coronaviridae or it is due to the unknown interferences or
cross-reactions with the components in the sample. In our hands, Dia.Pro had lowest
specificity, calculated at 84%, of all the ELISA assays we evaluated.
The sensitivity and specificity of these assays, in our hands, differed from those reported by
the manufacturers. These early assays came on the market following a quick assay evaluation
using very small or small sample size coming mainly from hospitalised individuals with
severe disease known to make strong antibody response15 and therefore not optimised for
population based serological sampling and investigations of asymptomatic or mildly
symptomatic individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hence, the assay sensitivities and
specificities figures established by the manufacturers were higher than those established by us
and other UK diagnostic laboratories.
The assays results were reported qualitatively and expressed in ratios and arbitrary units and
not as concentrations. The positive cut-offs for the assays were defined by the patient
population chosen by the manufacturer which typically was a group of older hospitalised
patients with severe disease. Ideally, one would perform a ROC curve on each assay using
the same data set which would limit the variability of the results observed from the different
methods.
These early assays were not calibrated against any reference material, unlike the newer
assays, e.g. ELIA Phadia SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays, that use the IgG calibrators traceable to
the International Reference Preparation (IRP) 67/86 of Human Immunoglobulins. The quality
of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays should improve with the 1st WHO international standard
which is expected in December 2020. External quality assurance schemes have now been
established to allow for better quality control of these assays.

It is important to keep in mind that the major use of SARS-CoV-2 serology assays was to be
for screening in populations with low disease prevalence and for determining the prevalence
of SARS-CoV-2 exposure in asymptomatic and individuals with mild disease. CDC has
recommended to combine independent assays to improve positive predictive values16. This
highlights the importance of our data with comparison of different assays and our findings of
best sensitivity and specificity of SARS-CoV-2 antibody assay by combining NC and S1
Euroimmun assays.
The selection of an appropriate antibody assay and the timing of the measurements are of
paramount importance for laboratories and will further inform seroprevalence studies as well
as clinical outcomes17. In the recent systematic review of 491 papers by Huang et al.18, the
most used assays were binding assays led by ELISA. Median time of detection of SARSCoV-2 antibody was 11 days and antibody kinetics varied across the severity gradient, with
antibodies remaining detectable longer after severe illness. There is a knowledge gap here
since antibody kinetics data come from the symptomatic individuals and not from subclinical
or asymptomatic groups.
Assays based on detection of antibodies to nucleocapsid were attractive for commercial
companies since these antibodies are detected sooner post-infection. However, they do not
last at detectable levels in mild disease and they have potential for cross-reactivity with other
coronaviruses. However, spike proteins are the main immunodominant antigens involved in
virus receptor binding (S1) and cell membrane fusion (S2) and anti-spike protein antibodies
are better correlates of viral neutralisation. Therefore, anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines target
spike protein to elicit immune responses2, 17,18.
Recent evidence suggests that deep profiling of the acute humoral immune response to
SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in predicting disease outcomes. Atyeo et al.19 found that spike-

specific antibody responses in hospitalised patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were
associated with convalescence and better outcomes while functional antibody responses to
the nucleocapsid were elevated in deceased individuals. In that study, a combination of five
SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody measurements enabled the authors to distinguish individuals
with different disease trajectories. Hence, the diverging immune response and the signature
with a higher spike: nucleocapsid ratio appears to be a powerful biomarker in disease activity
and in predicting clinical outcomes.
In summary, we have shown our experience in evaluating and implementing fit-for-purpose
SARS-CoV-2 assays for rollout in our routine laboratory diagnostics. Our study
demonstrated that the platforms tested have similar analytical performance (except for the
Dia.Pro assay which in our hands had low specificity). Our results show that diagnostic
laboratories like us can provide data that will inform future diagnostic, prevention and
treatment pathways and in this way can play a role in fighting the pandemic. However, we
also showed that no single assay will be sufficient to dissect antibody response in COVID19
disease. A portfolio of new generation robust antibody assays is necessary to facilitate further
understanding of COVID19 disease and its prevention, similarly to the existing antibody
assays for viral hepatitis. This portfolio should allow the detection of high quality neutralising
antibodies produced as a result of the germinal centre response as well as assays specific for
the individual viral proteins that distinguish between the immunity due to natural infection,
vaccination and recrudescence.
