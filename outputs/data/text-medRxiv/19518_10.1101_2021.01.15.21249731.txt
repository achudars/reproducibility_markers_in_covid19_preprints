ABSTRACT
Background: Reinfection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) has been documented, raising public health concerns. Risk and incidence rate of SARSCoV-2 reinfection were assessed in a large cohort of antibody-positive persons in Qatar.
Methods: All SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive persons with a PCR-positive swab ≥14 days after
the first-positive antibody test were individually investigated for evidence of reinfection. Viral
genome sequencing was conducted for paired viral specimens to confirm reinfection.
Results: Among 43,044 anti-SARS-CoV-2 positive persons who were followed for a median of
16.3 weeks (range: 0-34.6), 314 individuals (0.7%) had at least one PCR positive swab ≥14 days
after the first-positive antibody test. Of these individuals, 129 (41.1%) had supporting
epidemiological evidence for reinfection. Reinfection was next investigated using viral genome
sequencing. Applying the viral-genome-sequencing confirmation rate, the risk of reinfection was
estimated at 0.10% (95% CI: 0.08-0.11%). The incidence rate of reinfection was estimated at
0.66 per 10,000 person-weeks (95% CI: 0.56-0.78). Incidence rate of reinfection versus month of
follow-up did not show any evidence of waning of immunity for over seven months of followup. Efficacy of natural infection against reinfection was estimated at >90%. Reinfections were
less severe than primary infections. Only one reinfection was severe, two were moderate, and
none were critical or fatal. Most reinfections (66.7%) were diagnosed incidentally through
random or routine testing, or through contact tracing.
Conclusions: Reinfection is rare. Natural infection appears to elicit strong protection against
reinfection with an efficacy >90% for at least seven months.

INTRODUCTION
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has caused
extensive disease and death, with heavy social and economic losses [1-4]. In addition to the risk
of first infection, reinfection during this prolonged pandemic has raised additional public health
concerns [5-9].
We recently assessed the risk and incidence rate of documented reinfection in a cohort of
130,266 SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed infected persons in Qatar [5],
a country of 2.8 million population [10, 11] that experienced a large SARS-CoV-2 epidemic [1216]. Benefiting from a centralized data-capture system for nationwide SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing
and using viral genome sequencing, we quantified the risk of reinfection at ~2 reinfections per
10,000 infected persons [5]. Incidence rate of reinfection was estimated at 0.36 (95% CI: 0.280.47) per 10,000 person-weeks [5].
Serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection has been expanding in Qatar during the last few
months [14, 16, 17]. The objective of the present study was to quantify the risk and incidence
rate of documented reinfection in a cohort of 43,044 persons who had a laboratory-confirmed,
anti-SARS-CoV-2 positive result, regardless of whether these persons had ever had a diagnosed
PCR-confirmed infection. Persons with a PCR-confirmed infection could, in principle, be
biologically different from persons with an antibody-confirmed infection, as the former
population is more likely to have experienced symptomatic or even serious primary infection,
while the latter population is more likely to have experienced an asymptomatic or mild primary
infection that may never have been diagnosed. Moreover, some of those with PCR-confirmed
infection may not have developed detectable antibodies [5, 7].

The present study thus provides an independent assessment of the risk of reinfection in a
biologically different population from that of PCR-confirmed infected persons. A major strength
of the present study is the long follow-up time of each antibody-positive person in this cohort,
which had a median of 16.3 weeks for a total cohort follow-up time of 610,832.6 person-weeks,
comparable to or greater than the follow-up time in COVID-19 vaccine trials [18-20]. The study
therefore allows assessment of reinfection for more than seven months after primary infection,
and provides empirical evidence for possible effects of any waning of immunity.
METHODS
Sources of data
We analyzed the centralized and standardized national anti-SARS-CoV-2 serological testing
database compiled at Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC), the main public healthcare provider
and the nationally designated provider for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) healthcare
needs. The database covers essentially all serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 conducted in
Qatar, including both testing done on residual blood specimens collected for routine clinical care
from attendees at HMC [17] and during a series of population-based serological surveys [14, 16].
The antibody database was linked to the HMC national SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing and COVID19 hospitalization and severity database [21]. The latter includes records for all SARS-CoV-2
PCR testing conducted in Qatar since the start of the epidemic. The database also includes all
COVID-19 hospitalizations and their infection severity classifications, assessed through
individual chart reviews by trained medical personnel following World Health Organization
(WHO) guidelines [22]. Antibody data were also linked to the centralized COVID-19 death
registry, which includes all COVID-19 deaths assessed per WHO guidelines [23].

Laboratory methods
Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in serological samples were detected using the Roche Elecsys®
Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay (Roche, Switzerland), an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay that
uses a recombinant protein representing the nucleocapsid (N) antigen for antibody binding.
Results were interpreted according to the manufacturer’s instructions (reactive: optical density
(antibody titer) cutoff index ≥1.0 vs. non-reactive: optical density cutoff index <1.0).
Nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swabs (Huachenyang Technology, China) were collected
for PCR testing and placed in Universal Transport Medium (UTM). Aliquots of UTM were:
extracted on the QIAsymphony platform (QIAGEN, USA) and tested with real-time reversetranscription PCR (RT-qPCR) using TaqPath™ COVID-19 Combo Kits (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, USA) on ABI 7500 FAST (Thermo Fisher, USA). Samples were extracted using a
custom protocol [24] on a Hamilton Microlab STAR (Hamilton, USA) and tested using
AccuPower SARS-CoV-2 Real-Time RT-PCR Kit (Bioneer, Korea) on ABI 7500 FAST, or
loaded directly into a Roche cobas® 6800 system and assayed with a cobas® SARS-CoV-2 Test
(Roche, Switzerland). The first assay targets the viral S, N, and ORF1ab regions. The second
targets the virus’ RdRp and E-gene regions, and the third targets the ORF1ab and E-gene
regions.
All testing was conducted at HMC Central Laboratory or at Sidra Medicine Laboratory,
following standardized protocols.
Suspected reinfection case eligibility and classification
All SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive persons in Qatar with at least one PCR-positive swab that
occurred ≥14 days after the first-positive antibody test were considered as suspected cases of

reinfection. These were classified as showing either good evidence, some evidence, or weak (or
no) evidence for reinfection based on criteria applied to each case (Box 1). We defined the
reinfection swab as the first-positive PCR swab that was identified ≥14 days after the firstpositive antibody test. The 14-day cutoff was incorporated to exclude cases in which antibody
testing and PCR testing were done around the same time as part of clinical care of COVID-19
patients—a PCR-positive swab within few days of an antibody-positive test is likely to reflect
active primary infection under clinical consideration rather than a reinfection.
Suspected reinfection cases with a PCR cycle threshold (Ct) value ≤30 for the reinfection swab
(suggestive of a recent active infection) [25-27] and who had not had a PCR-positive swab for 45
days preceding the reinfection swab (to rule out persisting PCR positivity due to non-viable virus
fragments) [5, 25, 28-30], were considered as showing good evidence for reinfection.
Suspected reinfection cases who had not had a PCR-positive swab for 45 days preceding the
reinfection swab, but whose Ct value for the reinfection swab was >30, were considered as
showing some evidence for reinfection.
Suspected reinfection cases who had a PCR-positive swab within the 45 days preceding the
reinfection swab were considered as showing weak (or no) evidence for reinfection, as they are
likely to reflect prolonged PCR positivity of the primary infection rather than a reinfection [5,
25, 28-30].
Viral genome sequencing and analysis
For a subset of investigated reinfection cases with good or some evidence for reinfection, there
were records indicating prior diagnosis of the primary infection. Viral genome sequencing was
thus conducted to confirm reinfection in this subset of cases whenever it was possible to retrieve

both, the first-infection PCR-positive swab and the reinfection swab. Details of viral genome
sequencing methods are provided in Supplementary Text S1.
Reinfection risk and rate
Risk of documented reinfection was assessed by quantifying the proportion of cases with good or
some evidence for reinfection among all eligible anti-SARS-CoV-2 positive cases with an
antibody-positive test ≥14 days from end-of-study censoring (excluding cases whose residual
blood was tested for antibodies after death).
Incidence rate of documented reinfection was calculated by dividing the number of cases with
good or some evidence for reinfection by the number of person-weeks contributed by all antiSARS-CoV-2 positive cases. The follow-up person-time was calculated starting 14 days after the
first-positive antibody test until the reinfection swab, all-cause death, or end-of-study censoring
(set on December 31, 2020).
Adjusted estimates for the risk of reinfection and the incidence rate of reinfection were derived
by applying the confirmation rate obtained from viral genome sequencing analysis.
Ethical approval
This study was approved by the HMC and Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar Institutional Review
Boards.
RESULTS
Epidemiological analysis
The process for selecting suspected cases of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection is shown in Figure 1,
which summarizes results of their reinfection status evaluation. Of 192,984 persons tested for
anti-SARS-CoV-2 using blood specimens collected between April 16-December 31, 2020,

149,934 had negative test results, and were excluded from further analysis. Six of the remaining
43,050 antibody-positive persons were also excluded because their residual blood was tested for
SARS-CoV-2 antibodies after death. This yielded a retrospective cohort of 43,044 antibodypositive persons for whom possible reinfection was assessed.
The cohort included 8,953 (20.8%) women and 34,091 men (79.2%) of 158 nationalities, broadly
representative of the resident population of Qatar [10, 31]. Median age was 35 years for women
(interquartile range (IQR): 28-45 years) and 38 years for men (IQR: 31-47 years). Only 19,976
(46.4%) of these persons had ever had a PCR-positive swab preceding their first-positive
antibody test. Individual time of follow-up ranged between 0 days and 34.6 weeks, with a
median of 16.3 weeks.
Only 314 persons had a PCR-positive swab ≥14 days after the first-positive antibody test, and
thus qualified for inclusion in the analysis. There were 1,633 swabs (915 positive and 718
negative) collected from these 314 persons, and of these, 1,099 (551 positive and 548 negative)
were collected after the first-positive antibody test.
Investigation of these 314 suspected cases of reinfection yielded 32 cases with good evidence for
reinfection (Ct ≤30 for reinfection swab), 97 cases with some evidence (Ct >30 for reinfection
swab), while evidence was weak for the remaining 185 cases.
Characteristics of the 129 cases with good or some evidence for reinfection are shown in Table 1.
These individuals had a median age of 37 years (range: <1-72 years) and included 92 men
(71.3%). The median time between the first-positive antibody test and the reinfection swab was
52 days (range: 15-212 days). The median Ct value of the reinfection swab was 32.9 (range:
13.9-38.3). Slightly over a third of cases were diagnosed based on clinical suspicion (n=34;
26.4%) or individual request (n=9; 7.0%), while the rest (n=86) were identified incidentally

either through random PCR-testing campaigns/surveys (n=47; 36.4%), through healthcare
routine testing (n=18; 14.0%), through contact tracing (n=15; 11.6%), or at a port of entry (n=6;
4.7%).
At the time of the reinfection swab, eight cases had records in the severity database. One of these
was classified as “severe” and two as “moderate” per WHO classification [22], while the other
five were classified as “asymptomatic.” At time of primary infection, 14 cases had records in the
severity database, one of whom was classified as “critical”, three as “severe”, five as “moderate”,
two as “mild”, and three as “asymptomatic.” For the rest of the reinfection cases, no severity
classification was conducted because of minimal or no symptoms to warrant a clinical
assessment. For the eight asymptomatic cases above that had a severity assessment, the
assessment was conducted because of non-COVID-related hospitalization. No deaths were
recorded for any of these reinfection cases.
Confirmation of reinfection through viral genome sequencing
Among the 129 cases with good or some evidence for reinfection, 62 had records indicating prior
diagnosis of a primary infection. Paired specimens of the first-infection PCR-positive swab and
the reinfection swab were retrieved in 23 cases. Viral genome sequencing results are summarized
in Table 2. Detailed analysis for each genome pair is shown in Figure 2 and Supplementary
Figures S1-S2.
There was insufficient evidence to warrant interpretation for seven sample pairs because of low
genome quality. For seven additional pairs, there were one to several changes of allele frequency
indicative at best of a shifting balance of quasi-species, and thus no evidence for reinfection. For
four pairs, there was strong evidence for no reinfection as both genomes were of high quality, yet
no differences were found. Three of these cases had a Ct <30 for the reinfection swab, indicating

persistent active infection (Table 1). Two of these cases were reported earlier as part of a case
report documenting the existence of prolonged infections [32].
Meanwhile, for one pair, there were few changes of allele frequency offering supporting
evidence for reinfection. For four other pairs, there were multiple clear changes of allele
frequency indicating strong evidence for reinfection. One of the latter pairs also documented the
presence of the D614G mutation (23403bp A>G) at the reinfection swab—a variant that has
progressively replaced the original D614 form [33, 34].
In summary, for the 16 cases where viral genome sequencing evidence was available, five cases
were confirmed as reinfections, a confirmation rate of 31.3%. This confirmation rate was similar
to that found in our earlier study of reinfection among those with a PCR-confirmed infection at
33.3% [5].
Assessment of risk and incidence rate of reinfection
Applying the confirmation rate obtained through viral genome sequencing yielded a risk of
documented reinfection of 0.10% (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.08-0.11%)—that is 31.3% of
129 reinfections in the cohort of 42,272 anti-SARS-CoV-2 positive persons with an antibodypositive test ≥14 days from end-of-study censoring.
The incidence rate of documented reinfection was estimated at 0.66 per 10,000 person-weeks
(95% CI: 0.56-0.78). That is 31.3% of 129 reinfection events in a follow-up person-time of
610,832.5 person-weeks.
Figure 3 shows the incidence rate of documented reinfection versus month of follow-up in this
cohort of antibody-positive persons. There was evidence for a decreasing trend in the incidence

rate of reinfection with each additional month of follow-up (Mantel-Haenszel trend analysis pvalue: <0.001).
DISCUSSION
The results provide concrete evidence for the presence of reinfection in some individuals with
detectable antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 infection, even in some with high antibody titers (Table
1). However, the risk of documented reinfection was rare, at ~1 per 1,000 infected persons, at
least for a few months after the first antibody-positive test. There was also no evidence that
antibody-positive persons experienced any waning of protective immunity over time, as the
incidence rate of reinfection versus month of follow-up did not show an increasing trend over
seven months following the first antibody-positive test (Figure 3). To the contrary, there was a
trend of decreasing incidence rate, possibly explained by the (very) slowly declining incidence
rate in the wider population of Qatar over the last six months [15, 35], or possibly by
strengthening of protective immunity due to repeated exposures that did not lead to established
infection. Notably, a recent study from Qatar indicated an association between higher antibody
titers and repeated exposures to the virus [17]. Further follow up of this cohort of antibodypositive persons over time may allow a more long-term assessment of the persistence of
protection against reinfection.
Remarkably, the incidence rate of reinfection found here for those with antibody-confirmed
infection at ~1 per 10,000 person-weeks is very similar to that found for those with PCRconfirmed infection, as reported in our earlier reinfection study [5]. This suggests that these two
populations are functionally similar. Evidence of exposure to SARS-CoV-2, regardless of the
biomarker used to assess infection, appears sufficient to indicate protection against reinfection.

These findings are striking, as the epidemic in Qatar has been intense, with half of the population
estimated to have acquired this infection at some point since its introduction into Qatar early in
2020 [14-17, 35]. It is highly probable that a proportion of the population has been repeatedly
exposed to SARS-CoV-2, but such re-exposures did not lead to more than a limited number of
documentable reinfections. Other lines of evidence also support a low frequency of reinfection.
The epidemic in Qatar grew rapidly and declined rapidly [15, 35], consistent with a susceptibleinfected-recovered “SIR” epidemic dynamic in which infection elicits strong immunity against
reinfection. No second wave has materialized since the epidemic peaked in May of 2020, despite
easing of most restrictions [15, 35]. A recent study on health care workers in the United
Kingdom also indicated lower incidence of infection in those antibody-positive [36], and a study
of immunological memory in a cohort of COVID-19 patients indicated durability of the immune
response for at least 6-8 months [37].
An indirect outcome of this study is a provisional estimate of the efficacy of natural infection
against reinfection. The average incidence rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population of
Qatar (throughout the epidemic until the end of 2020) has been estimated using mathematical
modeling at ~150 per 10,000 person-weeks [15]. With the incidence rate of reinfection assessed
here and in our earlier reinfection study at ~1 per 10,000 person-weeks [5], the efficacy of
natural infection against documented reinfection is estimated at 1 −

 99% .
150

While this efficacy is estimated only against documented reinfection, it is possible to extend this
estimate to factor undocumented reinfections. A nationwide population-based survey in Qatar
found that only 9.3% (95% CI: 7.9-11.0%) of antibody-positive persons had a prior documented
PCR-confirmed infection [14], suggesting that undocumented reinfections are perhaps ten-fold

higher than documented reinfections. Applying this adjustment, the efficacy of natural infection
against both documented and undocumented reinfection is crudely estimated at 1 −

—similar to the efficacy reported for two recently-developed COVID-19 vaccines [18, 19].
While one reinfection was severe, none were critical or fatal and a large proportion of
reinfections were minimally symptomatic (if not asymptomatic) to the extent that they were
discovered only incidentally, such as through contact tracing or random testing
campaigns/surveys (Table 1). The severity of reinfection was also less than that of primary
infection. These findings suggest that reinfections (when they rarely occur) appear well tolerated
and no more symptomatic than primary infections.
This study has some limitations. By study design, primary infection was indirectly ascertained
through serological testing, thereby including only a subset with documented PCR-confirmed
primary infections. Having said so, serological testing was based on a high-quality, validated
platform, the Roche platform, one of the best available and most extensively used and
investigated commercial platforms, with a specificity of at least 99.8% [38, 39]. Thus, it is
unlikely that misclassified antibody-positives could have biased our findings. Viral genome
sequencing analysis was possible for only a subset of reinfections, either because primary
infection was only identified through antibody testing with no record of earlier PCR testing, or
because the reinfection swab could not be retrieved. Reinfections were confirmed by noting
differences in the viral genome between the primary infection and the reinfection. While not
likely, it is theoretically possible that these differences may have occurred due to within-host
evolution of the virus, as in the context of a prolonged infection [32, 40]. The potential effect of

these limitations is likely an overestimation, rather than underestimation, of the incidence of
reinfection, thereby affirming the conclusion of the rarity of reinfections.
In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 reinfection was investigated in a large cohort of antibody-positive
individuals who were followed for as long as 35 weeks. While the study documented some
reinfections, they constitute a rare phenomenon, with natural infection eliciting protection
against reinfection with an efficacy >90%. This points to development of robust immunity
following primary infection, which lasts for at least seven months. These findings may suggest
that prioritizing vaccination for those who are antibody-negative, as long as doses of the vaccine
remain in short supply, could enhance the health, societal, and economic gains attained by
vaccination.

Box 1. Classification of suspected cases of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection based on the strength of
supporting epidemiological evidence.
Suspected cases of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection: All antibody-positive persons with at least one PCR-positive swab
that occurred ≥14 days after the first-positive antibody test.
Good evidence for reinfection: Individuals who had a PCR-positive swab with a Ct value ≤30 at least 14 days
after the first-positive antibody test and who had not had a PCR-positive swab within the 45 days preceding the
reinfection swab.
Some evidence for reinfection: Individuals who had a PCR-positive swab with a Ct value >30 at least 14 days
after the first-positive antibody test and who had not had a PCR-positive swab within the 45 days preceding the
reinfection swab.
Weak evidence for reinfection: Individuals who had a PCR-positive swab at least 14 days after the first-positive
antibody test, but who had one or more PCR-positive swabs within the 45 days preceding the reinfection swab.
Ct, cycle threshold; PCR, polymerase chain reaction.

The category “individual request” refers to testing conducted at a healthcare facility based on the individual’s request, often because of some
requirement for testing, such as for travel.
‡
The category “port of entry” refers to testing conducted at the border or airport upon return from travel.
§
The category “clinical suspicion” refers to testing conducted at a healthcare facility based on presence of signs or symptoms, or reported history
of exposure.
**
The category “survey” refers to surveillance random PCR testing campaigns conducted in workplaces and residential areas.
††
The reason for the swab in the hospital record was “clinical suspicion”, but no further details were provided and the person was reported to have
no COVID-19 symptoms.

Text S1. Details of the viral genome sequencing methods.
Viral RNA was extracted using Quick-RNA Viral Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, USA; Cat. No.
R1041) and eluted in 30ul of nuclease-free water. RNA quality was assessed with real-time
quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) using SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) CDC
qPCR Probe Assay Research Use Only (RUO) kit (Integrated DNA Technologies, USA; Cat
number 10006713) and Luna Universal Probe One-Step RT-qPCR Kit (New England BioLabs,
USA; Cat number E3006E) on Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR instrument
(Applied Biosystems, CA, USA).
Next-generation sequencing (NGS) library construction was performed using CleanPlex SARSCoV-2 Panel (Paragon Genomics, USA; SKU: 918012). Gel-size selection on a 3% agarose gel
was utilized to prevent formation of adapter dimers. NGS libraries were quantified using KAPA
Library Quantification Kit (Roche, USA; KK4824), and normalized, pooled, and sequenced on
an Illumina MiSeq instrument using a paired-end 150bp kit (Illumina, USA; MS-102-2002). All
procedures were implemented following manufacturers’ protocols.
Raw sequences were processed with CUTADAPT (v2.10) [1] to exclude the contaminating
adapter sequences. Adapter trimming was performed using parameters -g
CCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT -a AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAA -A
AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGG -G TTCAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCT -e 0.1 -O 9
-m 50 -n 2. Only paired reads with minimum length of 50bp were retained for analysis. The
latter filtered reads were aligned to SARS-CoV-2 reference genome (NC_045512) using BWAMEM [2]. FGBIO (v1.3.0) was subsequently used to remove PCR primer sequences from the
resulting BAM file.

Variant calling and genotyping were performed with VarScan multi-sample mpileup [3] with the
pileup file generated using SAMTOOLS mpileup (v1.10) [4] with --min-BQ 20 and --min-MQ
20 parameters. The mpileup2snp function of VarScan was then applied with the filtering
parameters --min-var-freq 0.2, --min-coverage 5, and --min-avg-qual 20, to generate the final
VCF file.
