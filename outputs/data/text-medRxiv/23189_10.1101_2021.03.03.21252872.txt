ABSTRACT

31
32

Novel mRNA vaccines for SARS-CoV2 have been authorized for emergency use and are

33

currently being administered to millions of individuals worldwide. Despite their efficacy in

34

clinical trials, there is limited data on vaccine-induced immune responses in individuals with

35

a prior SARS-CoV2 infection compared to SARS-CoV2 naïve subjects. Moreover, how mRNA

36

vaccines impact the development of antibodies as well as memory B cells in COVID-19

37

experienced versus COVID-19 naïve subjects remains poorly understood. In this study, we

38

evaluated antibody responses and antigen-specific memory B cell responses over time in 33

39

SARS-CoV2 naïve and 11 SARS-CoV2 recovered subjects. mRNA vaccination induced

40

significant antibody and memory B cell responses against full-length SARS-CoV2 spike

41

protein and the spike receptor binding domain (RBD). SARS-CoV2 naïve individuals

42

benefitted from both doses of mRNA vaccine with additional increases in antibodies and

43

memory B cells following booster immunization. In contrast, SARS-CoV2 recovered

44

individuals had a significant immune response after the first dose with no increase in

45

circulating antibodies or antigen-specific memory B cells after the second dose. Moreover,

46

the magnitude of the memory B cell response induced by vaccination was lower in older

47

individuals, revealing an age-dependence to mRNA vaccine-induced B cell memory. Side

48

effects also tended to associate with post-boost antibody levels, but not with post-boost

49

memory B cells, suggesting that side effect severity may be a surrogate of short-term antibody

50

responses. The frequency of pre-vaccine antigen-specific memory B cells in SARS-CoV2

51

recovered individuals strongly correlated with post-vaccine antibody levels, supporting a key

52

role for memory B cells in humoral recall responses to SARS-CoV2. This observation may

53

have relevance for future booster vaccines and for responses to viral variants that partially

54

escape pre-existing antibodies and require new humoral responses to be generated from

55

memory B cells. Finally, post-boost antibody levels were not correlated with post-boost

56

memory responses in SARS-CoV2 naïve individuals, indicating that short-term antibody

57

levels and memory B cells are complementary immunological endpoints that should be

58

examined in tandem when evaluating vaccine response. Together, our data provide evidence

59

of both serological response and immunological memory following mRNA vaccination that is

60

distinct based on prior SARS-CoV2 exposure. These findings may inform vaccine distribution

61

in a resource-limited setting.

INTRODUCTION

64
65

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in more than 100 million infections and 2.5 million

66

deaths worldwide. Novel vaccines have recently been issued emergency use

67

authorization by the FDA and are currently being administered to front-line workers and

68

at-risk individuals. Early data from clinical trials suggest that these vaccines are safe and

69

effective1,2, however there is still a paucity of information interrogating how these novel

70

mRNA vaccines elicit immune responses at the cellular and molecular level.

71
72

The humoral immune response to infection or vaccination results in two major outcomes:

73

the production of antibodies by antibody secreting cells (ASC), which can provide rapid

74

protective immunity, and the generation of long-lived memory B cells capable of mounting

75

recall responses3. If circulating antibodies fail to confer protection to a future exposure,

76

memory B cells drive the recall response by producing new antibodies through formation

77

of new ASC or re-initiating germinal center reactions to generate new high-affinity B cell

78

clones through additional rounds of somatic hypermutation. In the context of acute SARS-

79

CoV2 infection, immunological memory in the form of antibodies and memory B cells has

80

been shown to be durable for over 8 months post-symptom onset4–6. However, studies

81

on vaccinated individuals have largely focused on measuring binding and/or neutralizing

82

antibodies as primary endpoints7,8. Although antibodies are a central component of

83

vaccine efficacy, immunological memory in the form of memory B cells may be important

84

for long-term protection, responses to subsequent infection, and the ability to respond to

85

emerging variant strains. The induction of memory B cells by mRNA vaccines remains

86

poorly understood. Furthermore, it is unclear how memory B cell responses relate to

87

serological responses, and how both antibody and memory B cell responses differ in

88

subjects who previously experienced SARS-CoV2 infection versus those who are SARS-

89

CoV2 naïve.

90
91

A related question is whether individuals who experienced prior SARS-CoV2 infection

92

require a second dose of mRNA vaccine. This question is particularly important given the

93

currently limited vaccine supply and challenges with deployment. As these individuals

4

94

have already generated a primary immune response to SARS-CoV2 during their natural

95

infection, it is possible that a single dose of vaccine could be enough to sufficiently boost

96

their antibody and memory B cell responses. Indeed, several recent studies have

97

indicated that antibody responses can be robustly induced in SARS-CoV2 experienced

98

individuals, consistent with an anamnestic response9–12. Although one study suggests

99

that memory B cells might also be boosted after a single vaccine dose13, it remains

100

unclear how well memory B cell responses are induced in SARS-CoV2 naïve versus

101

SARS-CoV2 experienced subjects after one versus two doses of mRNA vaccine.

102

Moreover, how antibody levels predict or relate to memory B cell responses following

103

mRNA vaccination remains to be determined. These key gaps in our understanding

104

require longitudinal analysis of antibodies together with memory B cell responses after

105

the first and second dose of mRNA vaccine in SARS-CoV2 naïve and experienced

106

subjects.

107
108

In this study, we established a longitudinal cohort of SARS-CoV2 naïve and SARS-CoV2

109

recovered individuals who received mRNA vaccines at the University of Pennsylvania

110

Health System. From these longitudinal samples, we assessed both circulating antibodies

111

and antigen-specific memory B cells over the course of first and second immunization.

112

We further integrated these serologic and cellular assays with clinical metadata and

113

compared these immune responses with those from non-vaccinated SARS-CoV2

114

recovered subjects. These studies revealed several key findings. First, as others have

115

reported, vaccination boosts antibody levels more quickly in SARS-CoV2 recovered

116

versus naïve subjects. Second, memory B cell responses are also robustly induced by

117

the first dose of vaccine in SARS-CoV2 recovered subjects, but no additional boosting is

118

observed after the second vaccine dose. In contrast, memory B cell responses continue

119

to improve after the second vaccination in SARS-CoV2 naive subjects. Third, although

120

subjects of all ages benefit from induction of serological and cellular immunity, vaccine

121

induction of memory B cells declines with age. Fourth, there was a trend for mRNA

122

vaccine-induced antibody levels to be higher in subjects with more systemic side effects,

123

but side effects had no relation to memory B cell responses. Finally, there was no

124

relationship between post-vaccination serum antibody and memory B cells in SARS-

125

CoV2 naïve subjects, indicating that measuring short-term antibody titers alone may fail

126

to predict long-term immunity elicited by the vaccine. Pre-existing memory B cells did

127

strongly correlate with post-vaccination antibody responses in SARS-CoV2 recovered

128

subjects, further emphasizing the importance of measuring these cells. These data

129

highlight the efficacy of SARS-CoV2 mRNA vaccines and support a single-dose vaccine

130

regimen in SARS-CoV2 recovered subjects, which may allow more effective distribution

131

of vaccines to the general population.

METHODS

133
134

Recruitment and Clinical Sample Collection

135

44 individuals (33 SARS-CoV2 naïve, 11 SARS-CoV2 recovered) were consented and

136

enrolled in the study with approval from the University of Pennsylvania Institutional

137

Review Board (IRB# 844642). All subjects received either Pfizer (BNT162b2) or Moderna

138

(mRNA-1273) mRNA vaccines. Samples were collected at 4 timepoints: baseline, 2

139

weeks post-primary immunization, day of booster immunization, and 1 week post-booster

140

immunization. 80-100mL of peripheral blood samples and clinical questionnaire data were

141

collected at each study visit. Full cohort and demographic information is provided in figure

142

S1. Non-vaccinated recovered COVID-19 donors (RD) were adults with a prior positive

143

COVID-19 PCR test by self-report who met the definition of recovery by the Centers for

144

Disease Control14.

145
146

Sample Processing

147

Venous blood was collected into sodium heparin and EDTA tubes by standard

148

phlebotomy. Blood tubes were centrifuged at 3000rpm for 15 minutes to separate plasma.

149

Heparin and EDTA plasma were stored at -80C for downstream antibody analysis.

150

Remaining whole blood was diluted 1:1 with RPMI + 1% FBS and layered onto SEPMATE

151

tubes (STEMCELL Technologies) containing lymphoprep gradient (STEMCELL

152

Technologies). SEPMATE tubes were centrifuged at 1200g for 10 minutes and the PBMC

153

fraction was collected into new tubes. PBMCs were then washed with RPMI + 1% FBS

154

and treated with ACK lysis buffer (Thermo Fisher) for 5 minutes. Samples were washed

155

again with RPMI + 1% FBS, filtered with a 70um filter, and counted using a Countess

156

automated cell counter (Thermo Fisher). Aliquots containing 5x106 PBMCs were

157

cryopreserved in 90% FBS 10% DMSO.

158
159

Detection of SARS-CoV2-Specific Antibodies

160

Plasma samples were tested for SARS-CoV2-specific antibody by enzyme-linked

161

immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as previously described15. Plasmids encoding the

162

recombinant full-length spike protein and the receptor binding domain (RBD) were

163

provided by F. Krammer (Mt. Sinai) and purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin

164

(Qiagen). ELISA plates (Immulon 4 HBX, Thermo Fisher Scientific) were coated with PBS

165

or 2 ug/mL recombinant protein and stored overnight at 4C. The next day, plates were

166

washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween-20 (PBS-T) and blocked

167

for 1 hour with PBS-T supplemented with 3% non-fat milk powder. Samples were heat-

168

inactivated for 1 hour at 56C and diluted in PBS-T supplemented with 1% non-fat milk

169

powder. After washing the plates with PBS-T, 50 uL diluted sample was added to each

170

well. Plates were incubated for 2 hours and washed with PBS-T. Next, 50 uL of 1:5000

171

diluted goat anti-human IgG-HRP (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) or 1:1000

172

diluted goat anti-human IgM-HRP (SouthernBiotech) was added to each well and plates

173

were incubated for 1 hour. Plates were washed with PBS-T before 50 uL SureBlue

174

3,3’,5,5’-tetramethylbenzidine substrate (KPL) was added to each well. After 5 minutes

175

incubation, 25 uL of 250 mM hydrochloric acid was added to each well to stop the

176

reaction. Plates were read with the SpectraMax 190 microplate reader (Molecular

177

Devices) at an optical density (OD) of 450 nm. Monoclonal antibody CR3022 was

178

included on each plate to convert OD values into relative antibody concentrations.

179

Plasmids to express CR3022 were provided by I. Wilson (Scripps).

180
181

Detection of SARS-CoV2-Specific Memory B Cells

182

Antigen-specific B cells were detected using biotinylated proteins in combination with

183

different streptavidin (SA)-fluorophore conjugates4,6. Biotinylated proteins were

184

multimerized with fluorescently labeled SA for 1 hour at 4C. Full-length spike protein (R&D

185

Systems) was mixed with SA-BV421 (Biolegend) at a 10:1 mass ratio (e.g., 200ng spike

186

with 20ng SA; ~4:1 molar ratio). Spike RBD (R&D Systems) was mixed with SA-APC

187

(Biolegend) at a 2:1 mass ratio (e.g., 25ng RBD with 12.5ng SA; ~4:1 molar ratio).

188

Biotinylated influenza HA pools were mixed with SA-PE (Biolegend) at a 6.25:1 mass

189

ratio (e.g., 100ng HA pool with 16ng SA; ~6:1 molar ratio). Individual influenza HA

190

antigens corresponding with the 2019 trivalent vaccine (A/Brisbane/02/2018/H1N1,

191

B/Colorado/06/2017; Immune Technology) were biotinylated using an EZ-Link Micro

192

NHS-PEG4 Biotinylation Kit (Thermo Fisher) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

193

Excess biotin was subsequently removed using Zebra Spin Desalting Columns 7K

194

MWCO (Thermo Fisher) and protein was quantified with a Pierce BCA Assay (Thermo

195

Fisher). SA-BV711 (BD Bioscience) was used as a decoy probe without biotinylated

196

protein to gate out cells that non-specifically bind streptavidin. All experimental steps were

197

performed in a 50/50 mixture of PBS + 2% FBS and Brilliant Buffer (BD Bioscience).

198

Antigen probes for spike, RBD, and HA were prepared individually and mixed together

199

after multimerization with 5uM free D-biotin (Avidity LLC) to minimize potential cross-

200

reactivity between probes. For staining, 5x106 cryopreserved PBMC samples were

201

prepared in a 96-well U-bottom plate. Cells were first stained with Fc block (Biolegend,

202

1:200) and Ghost 510 Viability Dye (Tonbo Biosciences, 1:600) for 15 minutes at 4C.

203

Cells were then washed and stained with 50uL antigen probe master mix containing

204

200ng spike-BV421, 25ng RBD-APC, 100ng HA-PE, and 20ng SA-BV711 decoy for 1

205

hour at 4C. Following incubation with antigen probe, cells were washed again and stained

206

with anti-CD3 (BD Bioscience, 1:200), anti-CD19 (Biolegend, 1:100), anti-CD20 (BD

207

Bioscience, 1:500), anti-CD27 (BD Bioscience, 1:200), anti-CD38 (BD Bioscience,

208

1:200), anti-CD71 (BD Bioscience, 1:50), anti-IgD (BD Bioscience, 1:50), anti-IgM

209

(Biolegend, 1:200), and anti-IgG (Biolegend, 1:400). After surface stain, cells were

210

washed and fixed in 1% PFA overnight at 4C.

211
212

Flow Cytometry

213

Samples were acquired on a BD Symphony A5 instrument. Standardized SPHERO

214

rainbow beads (Spherotech) were used to track and adjust photomultiplier tubes over

215

time. UltraComp eBeads (Thermo Fisher) were used for compensation. Up to 5x106 cells

216

were acquired per sample. Data were analyzed using FlowJo v10 (BD Bioscience). Full

217

gating strategy is shown in figure S2.

RESULTS

225
226

For this study, we recruited 44 individuals who received SARS-CoV2 mRNA vaccines

227

(Pfizer BNT162b2 or Moderna mRNA-1273) at the University of Pennsylvania Health

228

System. Of this cohort, 11 individuals had a prior SARS-CoV2 infection. Peripheral blood

229

samples were collected for immunological analysis at 4 key timepoints (figure 1A): pre-

230

vaccine baseline (timepoint 1), 2 weeks following the first dose (timepoint 2), the day of

231

second dose (timepoint 3), and 1 week following the second dose (timepoint 4). This study

232

design allowed us to investigate the kinetics of immune responses following both primary

233

and secondary immunizations.

234
235

We first measured circulating antibody responses in longitudinal serum samples by

236

ELISA. At baseline, SARS-CoV2 naïve individuals had undetectable levels of IgG

237

antibodies specific for either full-length spike protein or the spike receptor binding domain

238

(RBD) (figure 1B). Primary vaccination induced a significant increase in SARS-CoV2-

239

specific antibodies, that was further enhanced by the booster dose (figure 1B). In

240

contrast, all SARS-CoV2 recovered individuals had detectable levels of anti-spike and

241

anti-RBD IgG at baseline and these antibody responses were significantly increased after

242

the first dose of vaccine (figure 1B). However, in SARS-CoV2 recovered subjects, there

243

was no additional increase in antibody levels following the second vaccine dose (figure

244

1B). Notably, the levels of anti-RBD IgG were similar in the SARS-CoV2 naïve and SARS-

245

CoV2 recovered individuals at 1 week post-boost (timepoint 4) (figure 1B).

246
247

We next asked how mRNA vaccination impacted the responses of memory B cells

248

specific for SARS-CoV2. To address this question, we developed a flow cytometric assay

249

using fluorescently labeled antigens as probes to track induction of virus-specific memory

250

B cells in longitudinal PBMC samples (figure 2A). Consistent with the antibody data,

251

SARS-CoV2 naïve individuals had minimal spike-specific memory B cells at baseline,

252

whereas SARS-CoV2 recovered individuals had a significant population of spike-specific

253

memory B cells ranging from ~0.15-0.8% of total memory B cells (figure 2B). The

254

frequency of these antigen-specific memory B cells was comparable to a separate cohort

10

255

of non-vaccinated SARS-CoV2 recovered donors (figure 2B). Similar trends were

256

observed for memory B cells targeting the spike RBD (figure 2B). After primary

257

immunization, SARS-CoV2 naïve individuals had a significant increase in spike-specific

258

and RBD-specific memory B cells over baseline (figure 2B). These memory B cells were

259

also significantly boosted after adminstration of the second dose, approaching the levels

260

of memory B cells observed in non-vaccinated SARS-CoV2 recovered donors (figure

261

2B). In contrast, SARS-CoV2 recovered individuals had a robust expansion of spike- and

262

RBD-specific memory B cells following primary immunization, but had no additional

263

boosting after the second vaccine dose (figure 2B), suggesing minimal benefit of the

264

second dose in these recovered subjects. As a control we also examined the frequency

265

of influenza hemagglutinin (HA)-specific memory B cells in both SARS-CoV2 naïve and

266

recovered individuals following SARS-CoV2 vaccination. The frequency of these antigen-

267

unrelated memory B cells remained stable throughout the mRNA vaccination timecourse

268

(figure 2B), confirming the specificity of this memory B cell assay. Together, these results

269

demonstrate robust induction of SARS-CoV2-specific memory B cells by two doses of

270

mRNA vaccine in SARS-CoV2 naïve subjects. Alternatively, a single dose of mRNA

271

vaccine amplified pre-existing antigen-specific memory B cells in SARS-CoV2 recovered

272

subjects, with no additional quantitative benefit after the second vaccine dose.

273
274

We further analyzed the immunoglobulin isotype of SARS-CoV2 specific memory B cells.

275

On day 15 after primary immunization, ~25-30% of responding spike-specific memory B

276

cells were IgG+ and ~40-50% were IgM+ in SARS-CoV2 naïve individuals (figure 2C).

277

The frequency of IgG+ memory B cells increased to >50% following the second dose of

278

vaccine in these subjects (figure 2C-D), consistent with a qualitative improvement in B

279

cell memory formation after the boost. Conversely, in SARS-CoV2 recovered individuals,

280

~60-70% of spike-specific memory B cells detected prior to vaccination were IgG+ (figure

281

2C-D). Although the frequency of IgG+ memory B cells increased slightly to ~75%

282

following the first dose of vaccine, further increases were not observed after the second

283

immunization (figure 2C-D). A similar pattern of IgG frequency was observed for RBD-

284

specific memory B cells (figure 2C-D). In addition, the fraction of spike-specific memory

285

286

individuals. In SARS-CoV2 naïve subjects, the fraction of the overall spike-specific

287

memory B cell response that was focused on RBD increased over time, becoming

288

equivalent to that observed in SARS-CoV2 recovered individuals after the second vaccine

289

dose (figure S2). Overall, these data indicate a qualitative benefit to the virus-specific

290

memory B cell response following both doses of vaccine in SARS-CoV2 naïve individuals,

291

and limited qualitative improvement following the first but not the second vaccine dose in

292

SARS-CoV2 recovered subjects.

293
294

Several previous studies have reported a negative association between age and vaccine-

295

induced antibody titers after a single dose of mRNA vaccines16,17. We therefore

296

investigated potential relationships between sex or age and B cell responses after one or

297

two doses of vaccine. In our cohort of SARS-CoV2 naïve vaccinees, there were no

298

associations between sex and either antibody or memory B cell responses (figure 3A,

299

3C). Although there was no association between age and spike-specific IgG after the first

300

immunization (i.e. pre-boost), there was a modest trend towards a negative relationship

301

between RBD-specific IgG titers and age after the first vaccine dose (figure 3B). There

302

was no significant correlation between age and either spike- or RBD-specific serum IgG

303

after the second dose (figure 3B). In contrast, there was a clear negative correlation

304

between the post-boost frequency of antigen-specific memory B cells and age (figure

305

3D). Although this relationship represented weaker induction of memory B cells with older

306

age, all age groups still displayed an increase in the frequency of SARS-CoV2 specific

307

memory B cells compared to pre-vaccine baseline (figure S3A-D). There was also no

308

change in the frequency of total memory B cells by sex or age, indicating the antigen-

309

specific nature of this effect (figure S3E). While our cohort is not extensively enriched in

310

those over 50 years old, and does not directly address elderly vaccinees, age

311

associations with weaker vaccine-induced antibody responses appeared to normalize

312

following the second dose of vaccine. Conversely, the effect of age on memory B cell

313

responses was more prominent after the second immunization. These data point to

314

potentially relevant age-related changes in immune response to vaccination.

316

An additional question is whether vaccine-induced side effects have any relationship to

317

immune responses9. We addressed this question by comparing vaccine-induced antibody

318

and memory B cell responses in subjects with or without self-reported systemic side

319

effects (i.e. fever, chills, headache, fatigue, myalgia). In SARS-CoV2 naïve vaccinees

320

with systemic side-effects following the second dose, there was a trend towards increase

321

in antibody responses at the post-boost timepoint (figure S4). Such a trend was not

322

observed for the memory B cell response. Although these data only represent a statistical

323

trend, they do provoke questions about potential relationships between early vaccine-

324

induced inflammation and the induction of antibody responses, which should be

325

addressed in future studies.

326
327

Finally, we investigated the potential relationships between antibody and memory B cell

328

responses. In SARS-CoV2 naïve subjects, we examined the relationship between

329

circulating antibody responses and memory B responses after two doses of vaccine.

330

Despite strong induction of both spike- and RBD-specific antibody and memory B cells in

331

these subjects, there was no association between the levels of post-boost antibodies and

332

B cell memory (figure 4A), indicating that short-term serologies and cellular memory are

333

distinct immunological measures of vaccine efficacy. Similarly, pre-vaccine baseline

334

antibody levels did not correlate with baseline memory B cell frequencies in SARS-CoV2

335

recovered individuals (figure 4B). We next asked which measure of humoral immunity

336

predicted antibody recall responses post-vaccination. Interestingly, the baseline levels of

337

SARS-CoV2-specific antibody did not correlate with the level of antibody achieved after

338

primary vaccine (timepoint 2) in SARS-CoV2 recovered donors (figure 4C). However, the

339

baseline frequency of antigen-specific memory B cells (timepoint 1) strongly correlated

340

with post-primary vaccine antibody levels (timepoint 2, figure 4D), consistent with the

341

notion that these pre-vaccination memory B cells are major contributors to the SARS-

342

CoV2 antibody recall response. Overall, these data highlight the importance of measuring

343

antigen-specific memory B cells in addition to more conventional serologic approaches

344

as an immunological correlate of vaccine-induced immunity.

DISCUSSION

346
347

Our data indicate that mRNA vaccines induce significant antibody and memory B cell

348

responses to full-length spike and the RBD. These results are encouraging for both short-

349

and long-term vaccine efficacy. Overall, these data also add to our understanding of

350

SARS-CoV2 mRNA vaccine-induced immune responses in several ways. First, our

351

serological data is consistent with several other recent studies9,10,12,13,16,17 indicating

352

robust boosting of antibody responses in SARS-CoV2 recovered subjects after the first

353

vaccine dose, but little benefit to antibody titers after the second vaccine dose. Moreover,

354

we identified a similar effect for virus-specific memory B cells, demonstrating that both a

355

quantitative and qualitative plateau in vaccine-induced memory B cells is achieved

356

following the first dose of vaccine with little additional change to the memory B cell

357

response following booster vaccination. These data advocate for only a single vaccine

358

dose in individuals confirmed to have previously been infected with SARS-CoV2. It is

359

important, however, to point out that our cohort consisted of individuals who were not

360

hospitalized during their SARS-CoV2 infections, and it may be necessary to address this

361

question in individuals who experienced more severe COVID-19.

362
363

It remains unclear if the second vacccine dose in recovered individuals has other

364

immunological effects not reflected in overall antibody titers or memory B cell frequencies,

365

such as expansion of specific, high-affinity B cell clones. Additional analysis of BCR

366

sequences and memory B cell differentiation states is necessary to fully address these

367

questions. It is also possible that booster vaccination has some beneficial effects on virus-

368

specific T cell responses in SARS-CoV2 recovered individuals, and this topic should also

369

be investigated. A second related point is that in SARS-CoV2 naïve individuals, both the

370

antibody response and the memory B cell response displayed considerable benefit from

371

the second dose of mRNA vaccine. It is possible that some of this serological and memory

372

B cell maturation would occur over time in the absence of a booster vaccination, but the

373

spike- and RBD-specific antibody titers appeared to plateau between the first and second

374

doses of vaccine. Moreover, the frequency of the memory B cell response that was IgG+

375

and the fraction of the overall spike-specific memory B cell response that was focused on

14

376

RBD both improved after booster vaccination, arguing strongly for the benefit of a two

377

dose mRNA vaccine schedule in SARS-CoV2 naïve individuals.

378
379

In this cohort we also observed a negative association of age with induction of B cell

380

memory. Although others have reported a negative association between age and serum

381

antibody titers after a single mRNA vaccine dose16,17, we found that this relationship was

382

not significant following two doses of mRNA vaccination. However, we observed that the

383

magnitude of the memory B cell response following the second dose was lower with

384

increased age, confirming age as a key variable in mRNA vaccine induced immunity. It

385

remains unclear if the age-associated effect on memory B cell induction represents a true

386

difference in the magnitude of response or a difference in kinetics that will resolve at later

387

timepoints. It is also challenging to define an exact threshold for how much immunological

388

memory is sufficient to provide long-term protection. Although all subjects, regardless of

389

age, had significant humoral and memory B cell responses to vaccination, these data

390

highlight a need to further understand the age-related changes in responses to mRNA

391

vaccination. In examining correlates of vaccine-induced immune responses, we also

392

uncovered a trend suggesting that vaccine-induced side effects may be related to post-

393

vaccination serum antibodies, but not memory B cells. While more data are needed, it is

394

possible that systemic inflammation early after vaccination could contribute to an initial

395

induction of antibody with less of an impact on the development of memory B cells. Larger

396

cohorts and more quantitative measures of vaccine-induced side effects may further

397

clarify these relationships.

398
399

Finally, our data demonstrate the importance of interrogating vaccine-induced memory B

400

cell responses. The strong correlation of pre-existing antigen-specific memory B cells with

401

post-vaccination serum antibody underscores the immunological connection between

402

memory B cells and recall antibody responses. This relationship likely indicates a role for

403

antigen-specific memory B cells as a source of new antibody secreting cells, as well as

404

potentially contributing to new germinal center responses18. Although high circulating

405

titers of neutralizing antibodies are common surrogates of protective immunity, there are

406

many scenarios where circulating antibodies may not achieve sterilizing immunity and

15

407

additional immune responses will be necessary19. For example, high dose viral

408

innoculums may require rapid generation of additional antibody from memory B cells. In

409

addition, if circulating antibodies wane over time, durable memory B cells are likely to

410

provide a rapid source of protective antibody upon antigen re-exposure. Future booster

411

vaccinations, if needed, will focus at least partly on reactivating these antigen-specific

412

memory B cells. Lastly, infection with variant strains that partially escape neutralization

413

by existing circulating antibodies might require strong memory B cell populations that can

414

rapidly re-seed germinal centers and diversify to respond to novel spike antigens20. Thus,

415

including analysis of B cell memory in our monitoring of vaccine-induced immune

416

responses not only provides insight into immunological mechanisms of immunity to

417

SARS-CoV2, but may also be useful to inform vaccine implementation decisions across

418

different populations.
