ABSTRACT:
Background
Accurate detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is
necessary to mitigate the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, the test
reagents and assay platforms are varied and may not be sufficiently robust to diagnose
COVID-19.
Methods
We reviewed 85 studies (21,530 patients), published from five regions of the world, to
highlight issues involved in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in the early phase of the pandemic,
following the standards outlined in the PRISMA statement. All relevant articles, published up
to May 31, 2020, in PubMed, BioRiXv, MedRiXv, and Google Scholar, were included. We
evaluated the qualitative (9749 patients) and quantitative (10,355 patients) performance of
RT-PCR and serologic diagnostic tests for real-world samples, and assessed the
concordance (5,538 patients) between methods in meta-analyses.
Results
The RT-PCR tests exhibited heterogeneity in the primers and reagents used. Of 1,957
positive RT-PCR COVID-19 participants, 1,585 had positive serum antibody (IgM +/- IgG)
tests (sensitivity 0.81, 95%CI 0.66-.90). While 3,509 of 3581 participants RT-PCR negative
for COVID-19 were found negative by serology testing (specificity 0.98, 95%CI 0.94-0.99).
The chemiluminescent immunoassay exhibited the highest sensitivity, followed by ELISA and
lateral flow immunoassays. Serology tests had higher sensitivity and specificity for
laboratory-approval than for real-world reporting data.
Conclusions
The robustness of the assays/platforms is influenced by variability in sampling and reagents.
Serological testing complements and may minimize false negative RT-PCR results. Lack of
standardized assay protocols in the early phase of pandemic might have contributed to the
spread of COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION
In December 2019, there was a cluster of unexplained pneumonia cases in Wuhan,
China, and a novel coronavirus was identified as the causative agent.1 The virus was named
as severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the disease as
corona virus disease-19 (COVID-19).2 The clinical spectrum ranges from asymptomatic
forms to acute respiratory failure and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome, coagulopathy, and
death.3,4 In February 2020, the World Health Organization described the spread of these
infections as a pandemic, which persists as a global crisis. Robust diagnostic tests are
required to mitigate the spread of this virus and thereby to minimize the impact of COVID-19
on the health, economy, and social well-being of mankind.
The standard diagnosis of COVID-19 is based on clinical and radiologic evidence and viral
genome detection by RT-PCR in respiratory samples.5 Gene-specific primers are used in the
RT-PCR assays; structural genes include envelope (E), nucleocapsid (N), and/or spike
(S)-genes; non-structural genes include RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) or open
reading frame1ab (ORF1ab)

6,7

Some studies used only a single-gene specific primer, and

others used multiple-gene primers. Since studies published in the early phase of the
pandemic reported a 3%-41% range of false-negativity by RT-PCR, a repeat RT-PCR testing
was suggested.8,9 Furthermore, false negativity was attributed to either mutations in the
regions to which the primers bind or to sampling and laboratory practices, including collection,
transportation, and handling.10 Timing of sample collection with respect to the course of
infection and the sample type also influence test results.11 Alternatively, the diagnosis can be
made by detection of antigens (E, N, or S) and/or antibodies (IgM or IgG or both) in blood
samples.12 However, these tests have the potential for false positives owing to
cross-reactivity with other human corona viruses.13,14 Due to the unprecedented public health
emergency, the FDA authorized, on June 1, 2020, EUA requests for more than 15 diagnostic
and serologic tests. Though serology testing can detect the false positives of RT-PCR tests in
clinically suspected patients, its value in COVID-19 diagnosis as a complementary assay in

the mitigation of the pandemic is not well defined.

However, given the complexities in

COVID-19 testing, there is a need for a review of performance for tests commonly used.
In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we examine current tests for the diagnosis
of COVID-19 and evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of serological tests relative to
RT-PCR tests. Our objective was to identify reasons for variability in COVID-19 diagnostic
tests in the early phase of the pandemic that might have contributed to the spread of
COVID-19. In particular, we assessed the uniformity of primer usage in RT-PCR assays and
evaluated whether primers used in gold-standard RT-PCR tests affect the validity of
serological tests. Furthermore, we compared the performance of serological tests/platforms
in approval contrived/laboratory vs. real-world data.
METHODS
Literature Search
This research was accomplished according to standards outlined in the Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement.15 To find
relevant studies, international databases, including PubMed, MedRiXv, BioRiXv, and Google
Scholar, were searched for articles published until May 31, 2020. The following search terms
were used (selected using English MeSH keywords and Emtree terms): [SARS-CoV-2 AND
diagnosis] OR [2019-nCoV AND diagnosis]" OR ["COVID-19 AND diagnosis] and
[SARS-CoV-2 AND RT-PCR] OR, [2019-nCoV AND RT-PCR]" OR ["COVID-19 AND
RT-PCR] and [SARS-CoV-2 AND serology] OR [2019-nCoV AND serology]" OR ["COVID-19
AND serology]. Additional searches were performed for references listed in the included
studies.
Eligibility Criteria
Relevant articles that reported diagnostic information for infected patients were included
in the analysis. Pre-print articles with non-peer review were considered for inclusion. Articles
were excluded if appropriate information was not reported or if they were in the Chinese

language. Population sample sizes of <5 participants were not included; reviews and
editorials were not considered. For meta-analysis and approval vs. real-world performance,
studies that reported percent sensitivity/specificity without including patient numbers were
also excluded.
Data Extraction and Report Quality Evaluation
Two authors (CS and VL) screened and evaluated the literature independently.
Discrepancies were resolved by consensus after evaluation by a third author (MB). The
following were extracted for review and meta-analysis: journal name, authors, period of
publication (end of May, 2020), location of study, total number of patients, tissue of origin for
samples tested, whether samples were from upper or lower respiratory tract (or both),
primers for RT-PCR, platforms for serology tests, and antibodies tested for serology. Counts
of true positives, false negatives, true negatives, and false positives were used in the
meta-analysis.
An author (MB) extracted and analyzed the approved testing kit performance data from
the following sources: FDA EUA Authorized Serology Test Performance,16 the Foundation for
Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND) SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic pipeline,17 and package inserts
provided on company websites for each product. Real-world sample testing data from kits in
meta-analyses were compared against the performance of the same kits, or platforms,
reported in approval documentation. Variables abstracted were study authors/test developer,
name of test, test platform, and true positives, false negatives, true negatives, and false
positives for each antibody or antibody combination measured (IgM, IgG, IgA, combined, and
Pan-Ig). Risk of bias within individual studies of meta-analysis was assessed using the
QUADAS 2 tool for assessment of diagnostic studies.18
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed with R version 6.3.2 (2019-12-12).19 The package
“meta” was used for meta-analyses.20 Random effects models were used to measure

sensitivity and specificity of outcomes across studies. Subgroup analysis was performed to
evaluate the effect of assay, RT-PCR primer type, and setting (laboratory vs. real-world) upon
serum test performance. Heterogeneity across studies and subgroups was evaluated using
Cochrane’s Q statistic, and residual heterogeneity was quantified as a percentage with the I2
statistic. An I2 measure of 0% shows no observed heterogeneity, with increasing values from
0%-100% indicating higher levels of heterogeneity.

An assumption of homogeneity was

rejected for p-values < 0.1. Evaluation of publication bias was not possible in approval data.

RESULTS
Search Results and Population Characteristics
Our search generated 112 publications with potential relevance to the performance of
COVID-19 diagnostic tests. After excluding duplicate publications, manuscripts that did not
report numbers of patients used for sensitivity/specificity calculations and studies with a
sample size of <5 patients, 85 studies were selected for qualitative synthesis of RT-PCR
primer usage. From this set, a sub-set of 30 publications were selected for the quantitative
meta-analysis of serologic vs. RT-PCR diagnostic testing for COVID-19 (Table S1). Ancillary
analysis compared the performance of these 30 real-world studies to that reported in
laboratory approval data from 47 diagnostic serum-based tests. In all, our qualitative
synthesis of RT-PCR studies included 85 studies and 21,530 patients. From this synthesis, a
group of 30 studies with 10,355 patients from 5 regions of the world were selected for
meta-analysis and comparison to performance from laboratory approval data (Fig S1).
Uniformity of Primer Usage in RT-PCR Diagnostic Tests
We reviewed use of single primer of structural genes as compared to use of both
structural and non-structural gene primers in 56 population-based studies with 9,872
participants. Overall, high proportions of studies employed both structural and non-structural
gene primers in RT-PCR testing (58% in studies and 56% of total participants). Additionally,
29 studies (11,658 patients) did not report RT-PCR primer data. Single markers were most

frequently tested in China and North American studies (Table 1). In general, the most tested
samples were from the upper respiratory tract, regardless of primer status. Sample source
and location in the respiratory tract were not reported for 8-20% of patients, and this was
more common for studies using single gene primer.
Meta-Analysis: RT-PCR vs. Serum Antibody Testing
In general, patient sera were tested for IgM and IgG antibodies. China was the region
with the highest frequency of antibody testing, and lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) and
chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) testing platforms were most often utilized. Of the 45
studies included in the qualitative synthesis, 30 manuscripts reported both serum antibody
testing and RT-PCR testing for the same patients. Key characteristics of this population
include: China as the regional location for research; lack of reporting of RT-PCR primer
information for ~33% of all studies; most studies used IgM and IgG serum-based antibody
tests; and LFIA, CLIA, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) platforms were
common across studies (Table 2).
We used the IgM+/-IgG serum antibody test since it was most commonly utilized across
studies. Of 1,957 participants (sensitivity 0.81, 95%CI 0.66-0.90) with a positive RT-PCR
COVID-19 result, 1,585 were also detected as positive with serum antibody tests. Of 3,581
true negatives in RT-PCR, 3,509 negatives were also found by serum antibody testing
(specificity 0.98, 95%CI 0.94-0.99). For both models, heterogeneity between studies was
significant (p<0.01 for both, I2=97% and I2 =98% for sensitivity and specificity, respectively).
Sub-analyses of differences based on the testing platform found that sensitivity between
groups differed (p <0.0001), with CLIA tests performing best (0.99, 95%CI 0.97-0.99); ELISA
as next-best (0.89, 95%CI 0.82-0.93); and LFIA as having the poorest sensitivity (0.67,
95%CI 0.50-0.81). LFIA test sensitivity also showed heterogeneity between studies (p<0.01,
I2 95%). For IgM/IgG tests, specificity did not differ significantly by platform (p= 0.06).
However, a performance trend followed sensitivity, with LFIA underperforming (Figure 1).

Serum Antibody Testing Performance: Approval Data vs. Real-World Data
For manufacturer-based, laboratory approval data, IgM+/-IgG testing detected COVID-19
positivity for 1,045 of 1,068 RT-PCR-determined “true” positive patients (sensitivity 0.98,
95%CI 0.92-1.0). In the same group, serum testing correctly identified 1,928 of 1,967
(specificity 0.98, 95%CI 0.95-.099) true negatives by RT-PCR. For both models (sensitivity
and specificity), there was evidence of heterogeneity (p <0.01 for both and I2=93% and I2=94%
for sensitivity and specificity, respectively).
We evaluated IgM+/-IgG serum test performance in subgroup analyses comparing
laboratory approval performance data to real-world performance in study data. In
manufacturer data presented for approval, serum antibody testing detected 1,047 of 1,068
“true positive” cases of COVID-19 (sensitivity 0.98, 95%CI 0.92-1.0). Real-world use of serum
IgM+/-IgG testing was evident for 2,450 of 3,025 participants diagnosed with COVID-19 by
RT-PCR (sensitivity 0.81, 95% CI 0.66-0.90). For both groups, there was heterogeneity
between studies (p <0.01 for both, I2=93% and I2 =97% for approval and real-world specificity,
respectively) (Figure 2). In addition, the overall sensitivity between approval and real-world
testing groups differed significantly (Q=8.37, p=0.004). An analysis of specificity by the same
subgroups found no significant difference between laboratory approval and real-world data.
Laboratory data identified 1,928 of 1,967 participants with true COVID-19 negative status
(specificity 0.98, 95% CI 0.95-0.99). Real-world data found 5,437 of 5,548 true negatives
(specificity 0.98, 95% CI, 0.96-0.99) (analysis not shown).
Since, in IgM+/-IgG tests, there were differences in sensitivity between platforms, we
evaluated the effect of approval-based data vs. real-world data by the type of platform. In an
analysis stratified for ELISA, CLIA, and LFIA, there was no significant difference in specificity
between approval and real-world data (data not shown). However, for ELISA tests, real-world

capacity to detect true positives was lower than in laboratory-based analyses. In real-world
studies, the sensitivity of ELISA was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.82-0.93), different from laboratory
sensitivity for the same platform (0.94, CI95% 0.91-0.96, Q =4.74, p=0.03). The LFIA platform

Laboratory/real-world groups for CLIA platforms were too small to be tested reliably (1 and 2
groups, respectively).
Serum Antibody Testing Performance: Effect of Primer Choice on Test Validity
To evaluate the reliability of RT-PCR as a gold standard for serum-based test
performance, we tested the consequences of using structural and non-structural primers in
RT-PCR reference testing of serum. Analyses were divided into three subgroups based on
antibody targets: IgM, IgG, and IgG+/-IgM combined. In IgM and combined IgG+/-IgM testing,
the primer choice had no significant influence on sensitivity or specificity. However, for IgG
antibody tests, use of both a structural and a non-structural gene-specific primers in RT-PCR
resulted in reduced sensitivity for serum testing (Figure 3, Q=6.17, p=0.013). Furthermore,
although not statistically significant, the sensitivity of both IgM and IgG+/-IgM combined data
sets was lower when using a referent RT-PCR test with both primer types.

DISCUSSION
Because of the highly infectious nature of COVID-19, a prompt, accurate, and early
diagnosis is necessary to deal with the ongoing pandemic, for such diagnoses can help
reduce the spread of infection and its associated risk for mortality. Currently, the COVID-19
diagnosis is generally based on RT-PCR assays.8 Alternative methods such as antigen- and
antibody-based serology tests, although available, have uncertain value. The current
systematic review and meta-analysis addresses the challenges encountered in the diagnosis
of COVID-19 by various methods. It also analyzes differences between the FDA-approved
EUA data and real-world data. There is worldwide non-uniformity in the performance of

RT-PCR, including the number and types of primers and reagents used for COVID19
diagnosis, which raise questions about its generalized applicability. Similarly, the studies
based on serological tests showed diagnostic inaccuracies owing to individual differences in
mounting an immune response as well as dependency on the time duration after the onset of
symptoms. Overall, the sensitivity between RT-PCR and serology tests was 0.81 (95% CI,
0.66-0.90), and specificity was 0.98 (95% CI, 0.94-0.99). Among the various platforms for
serodiagnosis, the highest sensitivity was exhibited by ELISA, followed by CLIA and LFIA.
Furthermore, use of primers (structural, non-structural, or both) had a variable effect on
sensitivity based on antibody targets. Sensitivity was significantly higher for IgG serology
tests using structural-primer-only RT-PCR tests as a referent. Serology tests had higher
sensitivity for approval-based data than for real-world reporting. This difference was
significant for ELISA-based platforms, and a non-significant trend towards inflated
approval-based sensitivity was evident for both CLIA and LFIA platforms. These observations
highlight the inconsistencies/challenges in the COVID-19 diagnosis by RT-PCR, which is the
current gold standard, as well as in serologic testing.
For RT-PCR assays, the targets in SARS-CoV-2 include structural genes like E, N and S,
and nonstructural genes, including that for RdRp or ORF1ab.22 In the early phase of the
pandemic, some studies used a two-step diagnosis that included an initial screening phase
using structural genes followed by a confirmatory phase using nonstructural genes. 6,7,23 The
test is considered positive when both structural and non-structural markers are positive.24,25
However, currently both types of primers are used simultaneously to diagnose COVID-19.
The viral load or copy number of the viral genome is expressed as a Ct-value, which when
<37 is indicative of a positive test, and a value of ≥ 40 is considered negative. A Ct value
between >37 and < 40 requires repetition of RT-PCR analysis to confirm the diagnosis.24
However, the Ct value range varies widely according to assays and laboratory practices. A
COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay has a higher sensitivity than a conventional RdRp-P2 assay
irrespective of the type of sample.26 Overall, higher proportions of studies (58%) employed

both structural and non-structural gene primers in RT-PCR testing. Single markers were used
in some Chinese and North American studies. These findings are indicative of non-uniformity
in the RT-PCR methodology. We note that half of the positive, symptomatic patients became
negative by the second week, when they became asymptomatic. In contrast, the
asymptomatic, positive patients became negative two days after hospital admission,
indicating the importance of a temporal factor in COVID-19 diagnosis by RT-PCR.27,28
Published in the early phase of the pandemic, 11 of 85 studies had clinically suspected
COVID-19 patients. In these studies, the average test positivity by RT-PCR, regardless of the
sample source, was 44% (Supplementary Table 1), and test sensitivity was influenced by
sample source (upper vs. lower respiratory vs. other samples), issues related to testing
performance, and delay after onset of symptoms.29 In the early phase of the COVID-19
pandemic, for studies evaluating suspected COVID-19 cases, the total positive RT-PCR for
throat swabs was in the range of 30–60% at initial presentation.8,30 One study reported a yield
of 72-93% positive cases for lower respiratory samples (bronchioalveolar lavage and sputum)
as compared to 32-63% positivity for upper respiratory samples (oral and nasopharyngeal
swabs) and 29% for stool samples.29 Hence, a negative COVID-19 test based only on an
upper respiratory sample at a single time point is questionable. For most studies, the testing
sample was from the upper respiratory tract, regardless of primer type used. However, the
sample source was not reported for 8-20% of patients, which was more common for studies
using only structural gene primers. For stool samples testing positive for COVID-19, 66.7%
also tested positive on pharyngeal swabs. Of the stool samples, 64.3% remained positive
after pharyngeal clearance of the virus.31 In contrast, none of the patients showed a positive
test on upper respiratory samples after the anal swabs tested negative.31 These findings raise
concerns about whether patients with negative respiratory swabs are truly virus-free, and
sampling of additional body sites is needed. As determined by various studies, the
performance of the RT-PCR depends on usage of comparable protocols, including primers

and reagents.32 Additionally, it is unknown whether the currently used RT-PCR primers detect
all SARS-Cov-2 strains.
The specific immune response to SARS-CoV-2 can be measured by serological testing.
Several rapid serological tests, including point-of-care tests, are being developed. Even
though some of these tests have been approved by the FDA through EUA, their accuracy
needs to be validated.33 A minimum of 1–2 weeks after the onset of infection is needed for
seroconversion. Hence, antibody testing is of no value in the early phase of infection.
Additionally, its value is limited by its cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses.34,35 The initial
RT-PCR positivity during the early stages (<15 days) of SARS-CoV-2 infection declines to
66.7% in the later phase (15-39 days), during this period, the antibody test can supplement
RT-PCR in the diagnosis of COVID-19.34,35 Additionally, serology testing becomes valuable
for clinically suspected and RT-PCR negative (false-negative) individuals.
This research has limitations. Due to the dynamic reporting of COVID-19 testing
research and inconsistencies in reporting of predictive variables across studies, bias in
sampling may have some effect on our results. Patient flow analysis suggests that lack of
consistent RT-PCR reference standard given to patients in the same study, as well as the
unclear reporting of patient selection methods could contribute to bias in these results (Fig.
S2). In addition, the observed heterogeneity between studies in the meta-analysis suggests
that we must consider the possibility that the differences in results may be due to chance.
Lastly, it is questionable to compare two separate testing methods of RT-PCR and
seroprevalence in sensitivity/specificity analysis. In particular, given the relationship between
time since diagnosis and accuracy of serology testing, a contributor to the observed
differences in performance is time.
The effective containment of COVID-19 involves accurate diagnoses and isolation of
SARS-CoV-2-infected persons. Robustness of the assays/platforms is determined by
variability of the samples, primers, and reagents used. Serological tests alone are of value
only during the latter times of infection; however, they complement RT-PCR when used in

conjunction and minimize false negative RT-PCR results. Additionally, some of the approved
serological assays/platforms, particularly those developed using contrived/laboratory data,
perform poorly when applied to real-world samples. We are currently in a new phase of the
pandemic, and there is a need for a reliable/robust diagnostic test to mitigate the spread of
COVID-19.
Our analyses of studies published in the early-phase of the pandemic have highlighted
issues related to COVID-19 diagnosis that need to be addressed as follows: 1) The high
mutational rate exhibited by the SARS-CoV-2 virus may lead to the generation of new strains.
Therefore, like for influenza virus, the existing diagnostic kits need to be modified constantly
to optimize the detection of new strains; 2) Though RT-PCR diagnosis of COVID-19 is the
gold standard, its combination with a serologic test may increase the accuracy of
SARS-CoV-2 detection; 3) Approval agencies must account for the type of data (contrived
versus real world) presented by diagnostic kit developer; 4) Although agencies employed
EUA processes for the approval of diagnostic kits, there is a need to monitor their
performance and assess their robustness in real-world samples, to permit continued use of
these kits; and 5) Standardized assay protocols need to be developed and continually
updated to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic.
