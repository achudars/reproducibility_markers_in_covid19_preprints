Evidence before this study
We searched on Medline, EMBASE, and Pubmed for articles published from January 2020
to August 2020 using various combinations of the search terms “sex-difference”, “gender”
AND SARS-Cov-2, or COVID. Epidemiological studies indicate that men and women are
similarly infected by COVID-19, but the outcome is less favorable in men, independently
of age. Several studies also showed that patients with hypogonadism tend to be more
severely affected. A prompt intervention directed toward the most fragile subjects with
SARS-Cov2 infection is currently the only strategy to reduce mortality. glucocorticoid
treatment has been found cost-effective in improving the outcome of severe cases.
Clinical algorithms have been proposed, but little is known on the ability of genetic
profiling to predict outcome and disclose novel therapeutic strategies.
Added-value of this study

In a cohort of 1178 men and women with COVID-19, we used a supervised machine
learning approach on a synthetic representation of the uncovered variability of the human
genome due to poly-amino acid repeats. Comparing the genotype of patients with extreme
manifestations (severe vs. asymptomatic), we found that the poly-glutamine repeat of the
androgen receptor (AR) gene is relevant for COVID-19 disease and defective AR
signaling identifies an association between male sex, testosterone exposure, and COVID19 outcome. Failure of the endocrine feedback to overcome AR signaling defect by
increasing testosterone levels during the infection leads to the fact that polyQ becomes
dominant to T levels for the clinical outcome.
Implications of all the available evidence
We identify the first genetic polymorphism predisposing some men to develop a more
severe disease irrespectively of age. Based on this, we suggest that sizing the AR polyglutamine repeat has important implications in the diagnostic pipeline of patients affected
by life-threatening COVID-19 infection. Most importantly, our studies open to the
potential of using testosterone as adjuvant therapy for severe COVID-19 patients having
defective androgen signaling, defined by this study as ≥23 PolyQ repeats and inappropriate
levels of circulating androgens.

ABSTRACT
Background COVID-19 presentation ranges from asymptomatic to fatal. The variability in
severity may be due in part to impaired Interferon type I response due to specific mutations
in the host genome or to autoantibodies, explaining about 15% of the cases when
combined. Exploring the host genome is thus warranted to further elucidate disease
variability. Methods We developed a synthetic approach to genetic data representation
using machine learning methods to investigate complementary genetic variability in
COVID-19 infected patients that may explain disease severity, due to poly-amino acids
repeat polymorphisms. Using host whole-exome sequencing data, we compared extreme
phenotypic presentations (338 severe versus 300 asymptomatic cases) of the entire (men
and women) Italian GEN-COVID cohort of 1178 subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2. We
then applied the LASSO Logistic Regression model on Boolean gene-based representation
of the poly-amino acids variability. Findings Shorter polyQ alleles (≤22) in the androgen
receptor (AR) conferred protection against a more severe outcome in COVID-19 infection.
In the subgroup of males with age <60 years, testosterone was higher in subjects with AR
long-polyQ (≥23), possibly indicating receptor resistance (p=0.004 Mann-Whitney U test).
Inappropriately low testosterone levels for the long-polyQ alleles predicted the need for
intensive care in COVID-19 infected men. In agreement with the known antiinflammatory action of testosterone, patients with long-polyQ (≥23) and age>60 years had
increased levels of C Reactive Protein (p=0.018). Interpretation Our results may
contribute to design reliable clinical and public health measures and provide a rationale to
test testosterone treatment as adjuvant therapy in symptomatic COVID-19 men expressing
AR polyQ longer than 23 repeats. Funding MIUR project “Dipartimenti di Eccellenza

INTRODUCTION
This study was based on a preliminary descriptive analysis of a cohort of 35
hospitalized COVID-19 patients that was used to pinpoint a combined model of rare and
common host genetic variants.1 After this initial study, we extended the cohort to more
than 1,000 Italian SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive subjects.2 Among them, 25% were
asymptomatic, 25% were very severe, and the remaining presented with different levels of
respiratory failure and multi-organ involvement.2
Alongside the mode of transmission, viral load, comorbidities, and demographic
factors (such as age and sex), the host genetic background appears to play an important
role in COVID-19 severity and progression.3 Data from classical methods of analysis, such
as Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) or burden gene test on whole-exome
sequencing (WES) data, have pinpointed a limited number of genetic factors that do not
entirely explain how the host’s genetic background contributes to COVID-19 severity4.
Two groups have recently identified rare variants in the interferon type I pathway that are
responsible for inborn errors of immunity in a small percentage of patients and autoantibodies against type I interferon genes in up to 10% of with severe COVID-195,6,7. We
hypothesized that most patients might instead have a more complex genetic background
consisting of mutations arising in common susceptibility genes where additional private,
rare, or low-frequency mutations provide the virus with the most favorable environment
for replication, spread, and organ damage. Thus, we have considered the possibility that
poly-amino acids repeat polymorphisms may contribute to COVID-19 severity. Our
hypothesis was tested using a method of analysis based on a synthetic approach to genetic
data representation. Specifically, we considered that polymorphisms in the polyQ tract of
the Androgen Receptor (AR) may protect against the development of severe COVID-19.
AR contains in its N-terminus domain a polymorphic polyQ tract, ranging between 9 and

36 repeated CAG units in the normal population8. In vitro and in vivo studies have
demonstrated that the transactivation potential of AR is inversely correlated to repeat
length and Q-tract length can significantly influence androgen-dependent physiological
processes8-11.
Several lines of evidence lead to the concept that androgens are relevant to both
SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease presentation; however, they seem to have a
Janus bifacial way of action12,13. On one side, androgens promote the transcription of the
TMPRSS2 gene that encodes a serine protease known to prime the spike (S) protein of
coronaviruses, facilitating viral entry into the cells14. On the other hand, hypogonadism
and not hypergonadism is known to correlate with severe COVID-1915 and other chronic
conditions, partly due to the loss of attenuation of the inflammatory immune response by
testosterone16-18. Functional hypogonadism is also very common in male obesity and
diabetes mellitus, two recognized factors of poorer prognosis in COVID-19 patients. The
synthetic supervised genetic approach reported here contributes to disentangling this
complex androgen-COVID-19 relationship. It may also have significant implications for
further development of precision medicine in COVID-19 and identifies the use of
androgens as a potential way to shape disease outcome as earlier proposed for
glucocorticoids19, and subsequently demonstrated in a clinical trial20.
RESULTS
Testing the role of common poly-amino acid repeat polymorphisms in COVID-19
outcome
In order to test the role of common poly-amino acid repeat polymorphisms in
determining COVID-19 clinical severity, we performed a nested case-control study
(NCC), selecting the extreme phenotypic ends of our entire GENCOVID cohort (Table 1).
(Figure 1). Among 18,439 annotated genes we selected those with amino acid repeats,

namely 43 genes, and represented them as a boolean. Logistic regression with LASSO
regularization analysis identified AR as the only protective gene (Figure 1, panel A). As
expected, the grid search curve of the cross-validation score (Figure 1, panel C) shows a
maximum for an intermediate value of the L1 regularization parameters, and the chosen
parameter is 6.31. With this calibration setting, the 10-fold cross-validation provides good
performances in terms of accuracy (77%), precision (81%), sensitivity (77%), and
specificity (78%) as shown in Figure 1, panel D. The confusion matrix is reported in
Figure 1, panel B, whereas the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (Figure 1,
panel E) provides an Area Under the Curve (AUC) score of 86%.

Validation of polyQ polymorphism by sizing the PolyQ repeat of the AR receptor
gene
In order to validate the results on AR obtained by LASSO logistic regression, we
seized the male subset (351 subjects) using the gold standard technique that uses a
fluorescent PCR reaction followed by the use of GeneScan Analysis software® (Applied
Biosystems) for sizing the number of triplets21. Based on the AR polyQ length, male
patients were subdivided into two categories, those having a number of PolyQ repeats less
than or equal to 22 repeats, and those having a number of PolyQ repeats greater than or
equal to 23 repeats, being 23 repeats the reference sequence on genome browsers. We
found that PolyQ repeats below 22 are enriched in the asymptomatic cohort of males. The
difference was statistically significant in the group of males younger than 60 years of age
in which genetic factors are expected to have a major impact (p-value 0,024) (Table 2;
Supplementary Table S1; Supplementary Table S2).

Validation of polyQ polymorphism in the Spanish Cohort

We then seized the polyQ repeat in an independent cohort of 158 males from
Spain, with age < 60 years and without known comorbidities (117 cases and 41 controls).
The association with shorter repeats (≤ 22) and protection was confirmed (p-value
0,014139 by χ2 test) (Table 3).

Males with longer polyQ have receptor resistance
To functionally link the length of the PolyQ repeats to AR functionality, we
measured total testosterone (TT) in 183 men using LCMS/MS (Supplementary Table
S1). TT was higher in patients carrying ≥23 vs ≤22 glutamines (13.45 vs 11.23 nmol/L, pvalue of 0.0422), reflecting reduced negative feedback from the less active receptors
present in patients carrying a PolyQ repeat of ≥23 (Fig. 2a).

Unbalanced Testosterone-AR axis in males with longer polyQ repeats
Hormonal status of the entire male set sized for polyQ according to the age group
revealed lower TT and calculated free T levels and higher SHBG levels with increasing
age (Supplementary Table S3).
To evaluate whether the AR receptor reduced activity resulted in signs and symptoms
of hypogonadism, subjects were interviewed, post-infection, using a modified version of
the Androstest®22. Interviews were available for 61 subjects (representative of the
extremes genotypes of the cohort: 43 with ≤19 repeats and 18 with ≥25 repeats). An
Androtest score ≥8 was found in 38% of men with ≥25 repeats as compared to 16% of
those with ≤19 glutamines (likelihood ratio, p=0.046). Similarly, cryptorchidism (11% vs.
2%), anemia (11% vs 2%) and severe erectile dysfunction (22% vs. 9%) were more
frequently reported in subjects with ≥25 repeats, but not osteopenia/osteoporosis (6% vs
7%). These results indicate a trend toward clinical hypogonadism for those with longer
repeats. Conversely, in the entire male dataset, 6 cases of prostate cancer were found

annotated in the past-medical history, all in the ≤22 glutamines group, suggesting an
increased prostate sensitivity to androgens. No difference was found in the prevalence of
BPH or 5-alfa-reductase inhibitors use.
As the reduced signal transduction of AR might be compensated by higher
testosterone levels, as shown in Fig 2a, we tested whether the feedback was sufficient to
overcome polyQ repeats. A binomial logistic regression was performed to ascertain the
interaction between age, testosterone levels and polyglutamine receptor length on the
likelihood that subjects require intensive care during COVID infections. The logistic
regression model was highly significant (χ2 (3) = 18,881, p<0.0001), with the model
explaining 7.5% (Nagelkerke /R2) of the variance in COVID19 outcome (Supplementary
Table S4). A significant testosterone by polyglutamine length interaction was found
(p=0.018), suggesting impaired feedback as predictor of the worst outcome, namely
intubation or CPAP/BiPAP versus hospitalization not requiring respiratory assistance. To
provide a graphical representation, we plotted the ratio between TT serum concentrations
and polyQ number vs. clinical outcome (Fig. 2b). Results show a decreased mean ratio, a
sign of an inappropriate rise of TT for increasing polyglutamine repeats, was associated
with a worse outcome (p=0.00038).

Older severely affected males with longer polyQ repeats display a more pronounced
inflammatory phenotype
Finally, we tested the relationship between the AR polyQ repeat size and 5
laboratory markers of immunity/inflammation, including CRP, Fibrinogen, IL6, CD4 and
NK count. We found that older (≥60) males with AR polyQ tract ≥23 have a higher (55.92
versus 48.21 mg/dl) mean value of CRP (p=0.018) and lower mean value of Fibrinogen
and a trend of higher IL6 (Table 4).

DISCUSSION
We employed machine learning methodologies to identify a set of genes involved
in the severity of COVID-19. In the presence of very high dimensionality, as for instance
in a WES study, it is crucial to select the most predictive genes representing patterns of
variation (mutations or variants) in subjects with different classes of response (i.e., disease
state: from asymptomatic to severe cases). This problem is even more complex in diseases
where multiple genes are involved in determining the severity and clinical variability of
the pathology. Here, we wanted to represent poly-amino acids repeat polymorphisms that
are typically missed in classical GWAS analysis, which concentrates on bi-allelic
polymorphisms.
We used a machine learning approach and logistic regression with a LASSO
regularization to test if using such a simplified representation could lead to a reliable
prediction of extreme clinical outcomes (asymptomatic versus severely affected). This
approach enabled us to predict such clinical outcomes with 77% sensitivity.
AR contains a highly variable polyglutamine repeat (poly-Q) located in the Nterminal domain of the protein, spanning from 9 to 36 glutamine residues in the normal
population5. AR polyQ length correlates with receptor functionality, with shorter
polymorphic glutamine repeats typically associated with higher and longer PolyQ tracts
with lower receptor activity.5 AR is expressed in both males and females, but the
bioavailability of its ligands testosterone (T) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) differs
significantly, being much higher in males. As previous studies linked male hypogonadism
to a poorer outcome we decided to focus on male patients and demonstrated that shorter
polymorphic glutamine repeats (<22) confer protection against life-threatening COVID-19
in a subpopulation of individuals with age <60 years.

We also confirmed the functional association between polyQ size and receptor
activity. Specifically, we showed that longer polyQ size (≥23) is associated with higher
serum T levels, suggestive of impaired negative feedback (p=0.0046 at Mann-Whitney U
test) at the level of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, therefore confirming the
association between functional hypogonadism and severe COVID-19 infection.
As T is known to have an immunomodulatory activity attenuating inflammatory
immune responses,23-27 we hypothesized that a long PolyQ repeat would lead to a proinflammatory status heralded by increased proinflammatory markers18,28 by conferring
decreased AR transcriptional activity. Conversely, men with a more active receptor (short
PolyQ tract) would be protected because they can tame the inflammatory response and
increase survival regardless of serum T levels. We found that
-CRP-, one of the main inflammatory markers, was higher in subjects with a long AR
PolyQ tract. This observation not only is in line with the known anti-inflammatory
function of testosterone, but also reinforces the functional importance of the AR PolyQ
tract and its association with COVID-19 clinical outcome. Furthermore, this observation
suggests that CRP is hierarchically more indicative than serum T level, which can be
inappropriately normal and mask a functional hypogonadism in men with a long PolyQ
repeat.
The allele distribution of the PolyQ repeat length varies among different
populations, with the shortest in Africans, medium in Caucasians, and longest in Asians29.
Interestingly, WHO data on mortality rates during the first pandemic wave indicated a
higher fatality rate in China and Italy (https://covid19.who.int/)30 with respect to African.
Hence, AR polyQ length variability could represent an explanation for the observed
differences in death rate. Moreover, Africans seem to be more prone to infection31. This
observation could be due to a more active AR receptor, leading to a higher expression of
TMPRSS2, a protease essential for SARS-CoV-2 spread14.

Different studies have shown an association between hypogonadism and severe
COVID-1915 and other chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases16,17. Our results are in line
with these initial observations and contribute to explain a possible mechanism leading to
these associations. The present study brings the observations to the upper level, revealing
that is the overall androgenic effect -resulting from the interaction of polyQ polymorphism
and circulating testosterone levels- to predict the need for intensive care. In infected men,
we observed impaired feedback no longer sufficient to compensate for the reduced AR
transcriptional activity, leading to the fact that polyQ becomes dominant to T levels. The
latter helps to solve some inconsistencies, including the early reports of a slightly better
outcome in prostate cancer patients -who tend to have lower polyQ, as in our cohort when compared to other cancers.
An improvement in peak oxygen saturation in men receiving testosterone
replacement therapy has been demonstrated in a randomized controlled trial32 and could be
one of the mechanisms responsible for the observed protective effect of AR’s with shorter
polyQ tract in COVID-19 patients. Thus, our study has important implications and
suggests that androgen therapy could be tested as an adjuvant treatment in COVID-19infected men with functional hypogonadism. Based on the evidence discussed in this
paper, a proper randomized controlled trial (RCT) is warranted in COVID-19 male patients
with signs of hypoandrogenism and longer AR polyQ tract to test the safety and efficacy of
AR agonists, like testosterone, in improving outcome. A simple genetic test measuring the
AR receptor PolyQ repeat in male patients could then be introduced to screen individuals
more likely to benefit from testosterone therapy.
Variants of another X-linked gene, TLR7, have been associated with severe
COVID-19 outcomes in young men6. In the 2 reported families, the rare TLR7 mutations
segregated as a highly penetrant monogenic X-linked recessive trait. While variants in
TLR7 gene are expected to account for a small number of severely affected cases, our

findings involve a much larger number of subjects, as although the OR is relatively small,
long polyQ alleles are relatively common (27%)33. Overall, X-linked genetic variants keep
coming up as important for defining severe COVID-19 cases in males.
In conclusion, we present a method that can predict if subjects infected by SARSCoV-2 are at risk for life-threatening complications. This approach has 77% accuracy,
81% precision, 77% sensitivity, and 78% specificity. Furthermore, we present evidence
suggesting that a more active AR has the potential to confer protection against COVID-19
severity. If confirmed, these observations should be followed by properly conducted
clinical trials studying if testosterone helps decrease morbidity and mortality in patients
affected by the most severe forms of the disease. Finally, as shown by regression analysis,
ORs ranges between 1.26 and 1.45, therefore the risk of carrying a longer AR is much
smaller than other already known strong predictors such as age and sex, but still is highly
significant, relatively common, and among the very few known genetic predictors of
COVID19 outcome.

METHODS
Patients.
We performed a nested case-control study (NCC). Cases and controls were drawn
from the Italian GENCOVID 2 cohort of 1178 subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2
diagnosed either by RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swab, or by serology test. 2 Demographic
characteristics of patients enrolled in the cohort are summarized in Table 1 according to
their clinical status. In particular, the cohort was subdivided into 5 groups, based on the
type of the respiratory and medical support that was given to the patients: i. endotracheal
intubation; ii, CPAP-biPAP ventilation; iii. oxygen administration; iv. hospitalization
without respiratory support; v. no hospitalization either because asymptomatic or with
minor symptoms of COVID-19 (mild fever, cough, sore throat, etc.). Subjects of the cohort

were recruited by Italian hospitals and primary care clinics participating in the
GENCOVID Multicenter study previously described 2.
In the current NCC study, cases were selected according to the following inclusion
criteria: i. CPAP/biPAP ventilation (230 subjects); ii. endotracheal intubation (108
subjects). As controls, 300 subjects were selected using the sole criterion of not requiring
hospitalization. Cases and controls show the extreme phenotypic presentations of the
GENCOVID cohort. Exclusion criteria for both cases and controls were i. SARS-CoV-2
infection not confirmed by PCR; ii. not-caucasian ethnicity. Demographic characteristics
of the subjects in the NCC study are summarized in Table 1.

Analysis of triplets size in the AR locus
To establish allele sizes of the polymorphic triplet in the AR locus, we used the
HUMARA assay with minor modifications21. Specifically, we performed a fluorescent
PCR followed by capillary electrophoresis on an ABI3130 sequencer. Allele size was
established using the Genescan Analysis software.

Binary representation of WES data
In this paper, one of several synthetic approaches to genetic data variability
representation is used: poly-amino acids repeat polymorphisms (Benetti et al., Topological
Data Analysis on boolean representation of genome variability as a method for discovering
the genetic bases of complex disorders. Paper in preparation). Reads were mapped to the
hg19 reference genome by the Burrow-Wheeler aligner BWA. Variants calling was
performed according to the GATK4 best practice guidelines. Namely, duplicates were first
removed by MarkDuplicates, and base qualities were recalibrated using BaseRecalibration

GenotypeGVCF. In order to improve the specificity-sensitivity balance, variants quality
scores were calculated by VariantRecalibrator and ApplyVQSR, and only variants with
estimated truth sensitivity above 99.9% were retained. Variants were annotated by
ANNOVAR. WES data were represented in a binary mode on a gene-by-gene basis.
Representation of poly-amino acids triple repeats: A set of binary variables was included
to correctly describe non-frameshift variants in gene portions with repeated triplets. A total
of 43 genes with triplet repeat variability were taken from UniProtKB
(https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=reviewed:yes%20keyword:%22Triplet%20repeat
%20expansion%20%5BKW-0818%5D%22). For any of these genes a variant Dij was
defined as equal to 1 if the i-th gene presented a deletion in the region characterized by
repeated triplets. Non-informative genes, with either all 0 or all 1, are removed from the
dataset.

LASSO logistic regression
The problem of extracting knowledge on the most relevant genes involved in the
classification tasks of COVID-19 disease can be interpreted in the classical framework of
feature selection analysis. Due to the specificities of the problem (i.e., the complex
classification task), we adopted the embedded method of the LASSO logistic regression
model. By denoting with ௞ the coefficients of the logistic regression and by lambda (λ)
the strength of the regularization, the LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection
Operator) regularization34 term of the loss,  ∑௞ୀଵ
௣

|௞ |, has the effect of shrinking the

estimated coefficients to 0. This provides a feature selection method for sparse solutions
within the classification tasks able to enforce both the sparsity and the interpretability of
the results. The weights of the logistic regression algorithm can be interpreted as the
feature importances of the subset of the most relevant features for the task35. The input
features are the poly-amino acids triplet repeats presented in the previous section as well as

gender, comorbidity (1 if there is at least one comorbidity) and the age, the latter as a
continuous variable normalized between 0 and 1.
The fundamental hyper-parameter of the logistic regression algorithm is the
strength of the LASSO term, which is tuned with a grid search method on the average area
under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve for the 10-fold cross-validation.
The regularization hyperparameter varies in the range [10 ିଷ , 10ଶ ] with 50 equally
spaced values in the logarithmic scale. The optimal regularization parameter is chosen by
selecting the most parsimonious parameter whose cross-validation score falls in the range
of the best one along with its standard deviation. This choice is related to the aim of the
work that is to select the most important genes (and not necessarily the entire set of genes
contributing to COVID-19 variability). During the fitting procedure, the class slight
unbalancing is tackled by penalizing the misclassification of the minority class with a
multiplicative factor inversely proportional to the class frequencies. The data preprocessing was coded in Python, whereas for the logistic regression model the scikit-learn
module with the liblinear coordinate descent optimization algorithm was used.
Performances of the model were evaluated using the cross-validation confusion matrix as
well as by computing precision, sensitivity, specificity, and the Receiver Operating
Characteristic (ROC) curve.

Total Testosterone measurement.
Blood samples were collected after an overnight fast, immediately centrifuged at 4
°C and stored at -20 °C until assayed. Blood samples were collected after an overnight
fast, immediately centrifuged at 4 °C and stored at -20 °C until assayed. Serum total
testosterone was measured using the Access testosterone assay (Beckman Coulter Inc.,
Fullerton, CA, USA) with a minimum detection limit of 0.35 nmol/L. Reference range for
this assay was 6.07-27.1 nmol/L. Thawed plasma underwent 15 min incubation at 56°C for

virus inactivation. Afterward, plasma total testosterone was measured by liquid
chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) according to a previously
validated method provided with reference values between 9.8 - 28.4 nmol/L36. In the
present study, measurement was performed in 100 µl plasma, with sensitivity limit being
0.270 nmol/L, imprecision ranging 9.8 to 0.7% and accuracy 90.6 to 101.5% at
concentration levels between 1.12 and 39.2 nmol/L. A stability test under viral inactivation
conditions was performed in 6 samples, revealing a testosterone mean (min-max) % loss of
9.7% (4.6-16.7%). SHBG levels were measured in plasma samples using Quantikine
ELISA Kit (DSHBG0B, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) according to the
manufacturers' instructions. Serum LH was measured using “Access LH assay “ a
chemiluminescent, two-step enzyme immunoassay (Beckman Coulter Inc., Fullerton, CA,
USA). Sensitivity for the LH determination is 0.2 mIU/mL. Reference range in adult males
for this assay is 1.2-8.6 mIU/mL

Statistical analysis.
Since serum and plasma Testosterone values were not normally distributed, the
statistical analyses were performed using non-parametric tests. In particular, we used the
Mann-Whitney U test to compare testosterone levels in males with AR long-polyQ (≥23)
versus males with short polyQ (≤22). Logistic regression analysis was performed to
ascertain the interaction between age, testosterone, and the number of polyglutamine
repetitions and COVID19 outcomes. Box-Tidwell procedure was used to assess linearity
and the Hosmer and Lemeshow to assess goodness of fit test.

FIGURE LEGENDS
Figure 1 LASSO logistic regression.
This histogram of the LASSO logistic regression weights represents the importance of
each feature for the classification task (Figure 1) (Panel A). The positive weights reflect a
susceptible behaviour of the features to the target COVID-19 disease, whereas the negative
weights a protective action. The calculated odd ratio of AR short repeats (≤22) is 0,79 i.e.
protective. Therefore, the odd ratio of long repeats (≥23) is 1/0,79= 1,27 i.e. severity.
Panel B: Confusion matrix for the aggregation of the logistic regression predictions in the
10 folds of the cross-validation. Panel C: Cross-validation ROC-AUC score for the grid of
LASSO regularization parameters; the error bar is given by the standard deviation of the
score within the 10 folds; the red point corresponds to the parameter chosen for the fitting
procedure. Panel D: Boxplot of accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and ROCAUC score for the 10-fold of the cross-validation. The box extends from the Q1 to Q3
quartile, with a line at the median (Q2) and a triangle for the average. Panel E: ROC curve
for the 10 folds of the cross-validation.

Figure 2 Relationship between Total Testosterone and polyQ repeats and clinical
outcome
Panel A: Increased Total Testosterone levels in patients with longer polyQ repeats.
