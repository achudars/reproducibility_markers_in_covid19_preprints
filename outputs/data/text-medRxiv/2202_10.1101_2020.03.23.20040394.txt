Abstract
Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) first emerged in Wuhan, China, and
soon caused an ongoing pandemic globally. In this study we conducted a retrospective study
to evaluate the safety and efficacy of combined spinal-epidural anaesthesia (CSEA) and
infection control measures on perinatal care quality of 30 pregnant women with confirmed
and suspected COVID-19.

Methods Individual demographic data, clinical outcomes, laboratory investigations of
pregnant women and their newborns were collected from electronic medical records of the
Maternal and Children Health Hospital of Hubei Province, during January 24 to February 29,
2020. Anaesthesia and surgery results were compared between pregnant women with
confirmed and suspected COVID-19 infection.

Results Using CSEA in cesarean section was effective and safe for pregnant women with
confirmed and suspected COVID-19 infection. Administration of dezocine and morphine was
effective as postoperative analgesia, and well tolerated in COVID-19 patients. The
assessment of surgery outcomes also showed similar results in both confirmed and
suspected cases. No respiratory failure nor distress were found in the mothers with
confirmed COVID-19 infection and their neonates. None of these patients experienced
severe obstetric complications related to anaesthesia and surgeries. No COVID-19 infection
was reported in the neonates born to the mothers with confirmed COVID-19 infection and
healthcare workers in these operations.

Conclusions In cesarean section for pregnant women with COVID-19 infection, CSEA was
safe and efficient in achieving satisfactory obstetrical anaesthesia and postoperative
analgesia. No cross-infection occurred in the HCWs working in these operations.
Key word: anaesthesia, cesarean section, COIVD-19, infection control, pregnant women.

Introduction
The epidemics of 2019 coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) first emerged in Wuhan,
China, and soon spread throughout China and more than 100 other countries within three
1

months . As of March 4, 2020, there are cumulatively 80,424 and 12,553 cases of COVID-19
infection inside and outside China. The causative pathogen was identified as SARS-CoV-2
which was genetically related to two previous highly-pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV
2

(79% similarity) and MERS-CoV (50%) . Epidemiological studies in China have found that
3

SARS-CoV-2 had a higher transmission rate (basic reproductive number ranges from 2 to 3) ,
and a varying case fatality rate across age groups (range from 0 in children to 14.8% in
4

patients aged 80 years or over) .
Although SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have caused high mortality and severe complications
in pregnant women

5, 6

, current evidence did not support that SARS-CoV-2 infection caused
7

acute respiratory distress, miscarriage, and stillbirth . The data on neonates born to the
8

mothers with COVID-19 infection were also limited so far . However, since SARS-CoV-2 is
highly contagious, it poses a big threat to healthcare workers, other pregnant women and
infants.
In the COVID-19 epicenter Wuhan, a total of 49,540 cases and 2,871 deaths have been
reported as of 4 March 2020. As one of the largest maternal and children hospitals in
Wuhan, the Maternal and Children Health Hospital of Hubei Province has 1,500 hospital
beds in total. From January 24 to March 15, 2020, there were 3,294 pregnant women who
had vaginal or operative deliveries in this hospital, of whom 110 with suspected and
confirmed COVID-19 infection. Given an increasing number of pregnant women in our
hospital, COVID-19 infection has been as one indication for cesarean section since 24
January 2020.

Anesthesiologists had a high exposure risk to SARS-CoV-2 when conducting cesarean
section for pregnant women with pneumonia. In response, we upgraded infection
9

prevention and control practice to the highest level according to the national guideline .
One negative pressure operating room (OR) was dedicated to all operations on pregnant
women with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. The suspected cases were operated in two
other operating rooms in the designated area. A series of training and monitoring
procedures have been implemented in our hospital to enhance the adherence to the
infection prevention and control guidelines, particularly on hand hygiene, donning and
doffing of PPE, contact and airborne precautions.
To minimize the occupational risk of anesthesiologists, we made a special arrangement
of using the combined spinal-epidural anaesthesia (CSEA) for COVID-19 patients, if no
contraindications were indicated. According to the Practice Guidelines for Obstetric
Anaesthesia by the American Society of Anesthesiologists Task Force on Obstetric
Anaesthesia and the Society for Obstetric Anaesthesia and Perinatology

10

, CSEA has the

advantages of combining anaesthesia during operations with postpartum patient controlled
epidural analgesia. Compared to epidural anaesthesia, CSEA can provide a more effective
and rapid onset of analgesia for labor

11

. Moreover, anaesthesia nurses are exempted from

entering isolation rooms for managing epidural catheters of postpartum patients, thereby
further minimizing occupation exposure risks and the chance of cross-infection.
This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CSEA and infection control
measures on perinatal care quality of 30 pregnant women with confirmed and suspected
COVID-19 infection.

Methods
Patients
Medical records of pregnant women who were admitted into our hospital for scheduled
or emergency cesarean section were retrospectively retrieved during the period of January
24 â€“ February 29, 2020. The diagnosis criteria followed the guideline by the National Health
Commission of China

12

. Suspected COVID-19 infection fulfilled at least two of following

criteria: having an exposure history; having fever, lymphopenia or lower counts of WBC;
typical chest CT images of COVID-19 infection (multiple ground-glass opacity). Throat swabs
were collected from all suspected cases and sent to the Wuhan Provincial Centre of Disease
Prevention and Control for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests.
COVID-19 infection was confirmed if patients were tested positive.

Infection prevention and control
All healthcare personnel working in the negative pressure OR were required to enter the
anteroom for donning the full set of personal protection equipment (PPE): N95 respirator,
fluid resistant protective gown, gloves, full face shield and goggles, before entering the OR.
A nursing staff stood by in anteroom to cater emergency requests and coordinate patient
movement. Hypochlorite disinfectant at 2000mg/L was used for surface and floor
decontamination before and after operation. Air disinfection was conducted by hydrogen
3

peroxide air spray (1%, at 10ml/m ), followed by one hour disinfection of ultraviolet lights
and a movable air disinfection machine. Body fluid spillover was cleaned by paper towel and
then disinfected by hypochlorite disinfectant for 10-30min.

Anaesthesia procedure
The procedure of CSEA followed a standard protocol of our hospital. After giving 500ml
lactated Ringer's solution by rapid intravenous infusion, intraspinal anaesthesia (0.5%

ropivacaine at 10-15mg) was administered using pencil-point spinal needles at L2-3. An
epidural catheter was inserted toward the head as a rescue pathway during operation and
also for postoperative analgesia. For postoperative analgesia, dezocine (5mg/ml) at 5-10mg
was immediately administered by intravenous infusion after delivery, combined with
morphine (0.2mg/ml) at 2mg injected via epidural catheter at the end of caesarean section.
Some patients also used patient epidural analgesia (PEA). The loading dose was morphine
(0.1mg/ml) at 1mg, followed by 50ml epidural solution that contains 0.75mg/ml ropivacaine
and 0.04mg/ml morphine, at a basal infusion rate of 2ml/hr.

Data collection and analysis
The encrypted individual demographic data, clinical data, laboratory investigations,
discharge or transfer records of pregnant women and their newborns were collected from
electronic medical records. Descriptive statistics such as mean and standard deviation were
calculated for continuous data and frequencies were calculated for categorical data. Fisherâ€™s
exact tests and Mann-Whitney U tests were conducted to compare between patients with
confirmed and suspected COVID-19 infection. All analysis was conducted using the R
software version 3.6.2.

Results
Demographic characteristics and clinical outcomes of patients
There were fourteen patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection, and sixteen suspected
cases who had cesarean section during the study period. The demographic and clinical
characteristics of patients are shown in Table 1. More than 70% of these patients had
complications in pregnancy. Three (20.0%) confirmed cases and three (17.6%) suspected
cases had pre-term delivery. No respiratory failure nor distress were found in the mothers
and their neonates. No COVID-19 infection was reported in these neonates.

Anaesthesia and surgery evaluations
Anaesthesia results are summarized in Table 2. Most patients had sensory blockade
levels above T5 and Bromage scale of 3 during operation. The confirmed cases showed as
good tolerance to anaesthesia as suspected ones. Four suspected COVID-19 cases, but none
of confirmed cases, experienced intraoperative hypotension. None of these patients
required intraoperative sedation nor airway management. The majority ranked the grade 1
in anaesthesia effect.
The mean duration of surgery was 39.4 and 37.3 minutes for confirmed and suspected
cases, respectively (Table 3). It took an average of 3.7 minutes for anesthetists to complete
puncture. The patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection had more bleeding and longer
time to anal exhaust. The other results were similar between two groups.

Safety and side effects
The vital signs of patients remained stable during the surgery (Figure 1). Both groups
achieved satisfactory visual analogue scale (VAS) and Bruggrmann Comfort Scale scores
(BCS). Some minor complications were reported in these patients, including itchiness (n=1,
probably due to allergy to Morphine), postoperative vomit and nausea (n=2, probably

caused by analgesia medicine), pain at anaesthesia injection site (n=3). None of the patients
reported the incidence of severe obstetric complications related to anaesthesia and
surgeries, such as incision wound infection, postpartum haemorrhage, intestinal adhesion,
intestinal obstruction, or venous thrombosis. No events of atelectasis or hypoxia occurred in
these patients.

Discussion
In this retrospective study, we found that the CSEA generally achieved a satisfactory
performance and was a safe alternative to epidural anaesthesia we usually used in noncontagious mothers. As of 13 March 2020, none of our staff at the Anaesthesia Department
were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection. No vertical transmission of COVID-19 was found in
the neonates born to the mothers with confirmed infection, which was consistent with a
7

recent case report in another tertiary hospital of Wuhan .
Favre et al suggested that when possible, vaginal delivery should be preferred over
surgical delivery in pregnant women with COVID-19 infection to reduce the risk of severe
maternal complications

13

. Our study showed that cesarean section with CSEA was safe for

contagious pre-laboring women with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection, in either
scheduled or emergency surgeries. We found that COVID-19 infection caused relatively mild
symptoms in pregnant women, who rarely had hypoxia or respiratory failure. The maternal
and neonatal outcomes were also comparable to other pregnant women without infection
14

. Compared to cesarean section, the exposure risk of HCWs inside labor room could

increase to a greater extent due to longer duration of vaginal delivery. The lessons from the
previous SARS outbreak also found that the GA was a high-risk procedure for both HCWs
and patients. One previous study in Canada reported that one critical care doctor infected
SARS-CoV when conducting a prolonged intubation procedure for GA of SARS patients,
despite that this doctor was wearing an N95 respirator and goggles
Given the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2

, contact and airborne precautions have

been stringently enforced in the operation theaters designated to patients with confirmed
or suspected COVID-19 infection in our hospital. However, the highest level of infection
control measures could have prompted the adverse emotional response of pre-laboring

mothers. Anxiety and stress have been widely reported in Wuhan residents

17

. Pregnant

women might also worry about health status of their newborns, although there is limited
evidence to suggest a vertical transmission could occur in COVID patients

7, 14, 18

. The CSEA

could have provided rapid onset of analgesia during cesarean section, which could benefit
patients by effectively shorten the surgery period and partially relieve mental stress of
patients.
Early clinical reports of COVID-19 infection in general populations have found fever and
cough was the most common symptoms on admission

19

. By contrast, less than 30% of

pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 presented fever on admission, and about 20%
did not develop fever during hospital stay. This highlights the difficulty of early detection of
the potentially contagious patients in obstetric wards. Interestingly, over 85% of them (12
out of 14) already had abnormal chest CT imaging in single lungs or both lungs on admission.
Hence, in the absence of point-of-care rapid reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) tests, low-dose chest CT scan could be used as an alternative screening tool for
COVID-19 infection.
The infection prevention and control guidelines in our hospital are in line with those
recently proposed by Peng et al. based on the previous experience of the 2003 SARS
outbreak

19

. Although SARS-CoV-2 had a lower case fatality ratio than SARS-CoV and MERS-

CoV, its transmissibility is much higher than previous coronaviruses

16

. As of February

11,2020, there were 1716 HCWs infected by SARS-CoV-2, of whom 14.8% were severe or
4

critical cases and five deaths reported . Therefore, strict adherence to the infection
prevention and control guidelines is critical to reduce the risk of cross infections between
HCWs and patients. Our hospital has held regular online trainings and practical workshops
to all HCWs and supporting staff. Wearing the full set of PPE did not affect the performance

11

of anaesthesia and effectively protected the frontline staff from occupational exposure to
COVID-19 infections. It is of note that even in countries with relatively small numbers of
cases, HCWs still need to maintain high vigilance against this virus, given the RT-PCR test
capacity might be limited in some areas and cases are seriously underreported at the early
stage of the epidemic

20

. As the epidemic progresses, an exponential increase of patient

numbers could cause a serious shortage of PPE in healthcare settings.
Our study has a few limitations. First, we have a small sample size of 34 pregnant women,
although this is the largest sample for pregnant women with COVID-19 infection to date.
Second, all patients were in the third trimester. All of them had relatively mild infection and
most did not show any respiratory symptoms on admission. Hence, it is not clear that our
findings can also be applied to patients with moderate and severe infection, since they
might require endotracheal intubation or other airway management during surgery. Last
but not least, this is a one-center retrospective study at the epicenter of COVID outbreaks,
so the results might be generalized to other settings.

Conclusions
In cesarean section for pregnant women with COVID-19 infection, CSEA was safe and
efficient in achieving satisfactory obstetrical anaesthesia and could also assist
administration of dezocine and morphine for postoperative analgesia. No adverse events
associated with anaesthesia and surgery were found in these patients, and no crossinfection occurred in the HCWs working in these operations.
