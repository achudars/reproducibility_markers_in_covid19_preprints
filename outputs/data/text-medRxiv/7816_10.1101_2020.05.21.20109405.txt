Abstract
We apply tools from functional data analysis to model cumulative trajectories
of COVID-19 cases across countries, establishing a framework for quantifying and
comparing cases and deaths across countries longitudinally. It emerges that a country’s trajectory during an initial first month “priming period” largely determines
how the situation unfolds subsequently. We also propose a method for forecasting
case counts, which takes advantage of the common, latent information in the entire
sample of curves, instead of just the history of a single country. Our framework
facilitates to quantify the effects of demographic covariates and social mobility on
doubling rates and case fatality rates through a time-varying regression model. Decreased workplace mobility is associated with lower doubling rates with a roughly
two week delay, and case fatality rates exhibit a positive feedback pattern.

Introduction

As of May 1, 2020, more than 3 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported worldwide,
leading to more than 200, 000 coronavirus related deaths [1]. The World Health Organization declared the situation a pandemic on March 11, 2020, and nearly all countries have
been exposed to SARS-CoV-2, the betacoronavirus which causes the disease [2]. Despite
the far reach of the virus, the pattern and rate of its spread within a population is not
uniform. Some countries like the US have seen marked increases in case and death counts
per capita, even after implementing distancing measures, while others like Japan have
been able to keep the spread of disease low for long durations despite comparatively lax
social restrictions. Measures that mitigate spread in one case may not work uniformly
across countries due to effects of demographics and timing, among other factors. Datadriven analyses of the time-dynamics of cases and deaths are of central importance to
characterize underlying forces and unexplained variation.
Global efforts to “flatten the curve” of COVID-19 cases translate quantitatively to
decreasing epidemiological statistics like doubling rates via social distancing campaigns,
improved hygiene and case tracking. Early statistical inquiries have focused on estimation
of doubling rates and case fatality rates with SIRD and SEIM models [3, 4] and forecasting
the number of cases worldwide using time series analysis [5]. The analysis of the effects of
prevention efforts like social distancing for specific countries has also received increasing
attention [6, 7].
Processes that grow exponentially, such as the case load of unmitigated COVID-19
transmissions are characterized by a fixed doubling time. In reality, however, the doubling
time is a dynamic quantity, which changes every day due to mitigation efforts and the
changing inherent dynamics of virus spread. It is then vital that policy makers have

access to frequent and up-to-date estimates of doubling time [8]. In recent work [9, 10]
the basic reproduction number and doubling time have been studied in a dynamic manner
by considering a varying coefficient model with daily new cases as the response and time
as a predictor. Similar work has considered the real-time estimation of case fatality
rate using Poisson mixture models [11]. Our analysis complements these studies and we
propose an alternative way of obtaining relevant dynamic quantities. Associating metrics
of disease progression with baseline covariates is also of central interest. Recent research
has queried the effects of population age, temperature, humidity [12, 13], community
mobility patterns [14, 15] and other factors on the spread of the virus. Modeling the
transmission dynamics of COVID-19 based on predictors is key to understanding the
impact of distancing practices and other policies on spread mitigation and prevention.
We refer to [16] for a more thorough review of recent epidemiological analyses.
It should be noted that COVID-19 analyses based on published case and death counts,
including those conducted here, are subject to the same biases which affect the accuracy
of the data, primarily due to under-reporting [17], the degree of which varies by country [18]. The reasons for such under-reporting are many, including insufficient testing
materials, political incentives, and administrative delays. With this caveat in mind, the
study of available data may nevertheless provide useful insights and stimulation for further
research.
We propose here functional data analysis as a tool for analyzing the time-dynamics
of COVID-19 as quantified by case and death numbers across countries. Functional data
analysis (FDA) [19, 20, 21] aims to detect patterns and quantify samples of random
trajectories through functional principal component analysis [22, 23], empirical dynamics
[24] and other methods where entire curves are viewed as data atoms. This methodology

is uniquely suited for the analysis of COVID-19 data since the cumulative case counts
across countries amount to a sample of random curves observed over time.
The cumulative COVID-19 case and death count trajectories per million people (in
log scale) for 64 countries are shown in Figure 1 (see Methods for further details). The
trajectories are shown for a 67-day interval after the first time a country reports at least
20 confirmed cases which is defined as the origin of the time scale and thus corresponds
to different calendar times (see Data).

case counts and to quantify the performance of various countries as the pandemic progresses. We also showcase an approach for predicting future case counts which may be
used to understand whether a country is doing better or worse than expected. Finally,
we explore the role of variables such as population density, fraction of the population
over 65 and mobility reduction efforts for the spread of the infection as it varies over
time. Throughout, our focus is on associations which may suggest but do not establish
causality.

Results
COVID-19 dynamics across countries
Main patterns of disease propagation

For the 64 countries in the study, case counts per million generally follow one of four
paths over time. They are either 1. consistently higher than average (e.g., Switzerland),
2. consistently lower than average (e.g., India), 3. initially lower but then experience a
dramatic increase over time (e.g., the US), or 4. initially higher before entering a period
of control (e.g. Slovenia). These archetypes are derived from the extreme ends of the two
main modes of variation [25, 26] observed for the sample, which emerge from functional
principal component analysis (FPCA, Figure 2). FPCA is similar to ordinary principal
component analysis in the sense that it projects high dimensional curve data into a low
dimensional space, representing them as a random vector of functional principal component (FPC) scores (see Methods). These scores are matched with smooth eigenfunctions,
which reveal the primary patterns of variation in the sample of functional objects. For the
case load trajectories, a 2-dimensional representation was found to adequately represent

the sample of cumulative case trajectories.
An inspection of the eigenfunctions and their corresponding FPC scores reveals which
of the four patterns a country generally follows (Figure 2). FPC scores of countries
with consistently higher case trajectories are located in the right half-plane, and those
with uniformly lower rates in the left. Analogously, countries which experience a dramatic
increase in cases per million lie in the upper half of the plane, and those which successfully
slow their spread in the lower half. Countries which follow similar trajectories are clustered
together in FPC space, with outliers located in the outskirts of the point cloud. While
some outliers are apparent from a simple visual inspection of the original curves (e.g.
Luxembourg, Thailand, India and Japan), other atypically-shaped trajectories are initially
obscured in the crowd of curves until revealed in FPC space (e.g. the US).
The concept of modes of variation is useful for visualizing the range of FPC scores
as a spectrum of curves (Figure 3). For example, India’s deviation from the mean curve
is largely explained by just the first mode of variation. Its very negative first FPC score
places it far below the mean throughout the entire interval. In this sense the first FPC
score is similar to a random intercept in a linear mixed model, since the first eigenfunction
is roughly constant over time. Incidentally, the slight curvature exhibited in this eigenfunction allows for flexible modeling of the “curve bending” phenomenon as demonstrated
by Switzerland, which has a very positive first FPC score.
The US departs from the typical mean trajectory in a different way: Its case count per
capita has increased dramatically by the end of the time interval, which is seen by its very
positive second FPC score. The second mode of variation captures a subtle curvature that
would be missed in parametric modeling. In this sense the second FPC score modulates
the shape of the curve rather than its magnitude. Nearly all cumulative case trajectories

begin to level off after roughly t = 25 days, a trend which is illustrated neatly by the
inflection point in the second mode of variation. One may then interpret the first month
of exposure as a sort of “priming period,” after which (non-outlier) trajectories exhibit
more stable trends. This interpretation echoes the findings of [27], who also identify the
first few weeks of exposure as a critical time for disease management.
Countries which are clustered together in FPC space may also share other underlying
structures such as geographic proximity, exemplified by the Western European countries
in the upper-right quadrant of Figure 2(b). In some cases, far-flung places may act as if
they are part of a distinct geographic cluster, such as Panama and Qatar with trajectories
that are very similar to those in the Scandinavian block.
Countries’ performances in the two main modes of variation can be evaluated by
comparing their respective FPC scores. Higher scores indicate higher rates of spread for
both modes of variation. For example, Switzerland has a much higher first FPC score
than India, reflecting that the case count per capita is higher for Switzerland throughout
the time period. Similarly, the case trajectory in the US is seen to have shot up much
more over time than that of Slovenia, say, since the second FPC score of the US is very
large and positive while it is negative for Slovenia.

2.1.2

Comparisons via rank dynamics

While FPC scores are useful for comparing and classifying country trajectories, they require multivariate comparisons, since each country has two scores. It is useful to complement these comparisons by ranking each country by cumulative cases counts per million,
where higher percentile ranks correspond to increased infection rates and a generally worse
situation. Such rankings can be done at each fixed time and then analyzed with rank dy-

namics [28]. The percentile ranks and their time-evolutions are illustrated in Figure 4
with a few notable curves highlighted. Higher percentiles signify more cases per capita.
Switzerland’s transmission rates have been among the most severe, while India has performed well consistently throughout the time period. Both countries’ integrated ranks
are among the highest and lowest, respectively, where integrated rank is the average rank
over time. Both display low rank volatility (see Section S.6 in the Supplement), which
is a measure of how ranks change over time, as their overall positions remain relatively
stable throughout the time period.
In terms of ranks, the situations in Spain and the US have substantially worsened
over the time period, in line with the FPCA results, where Spain and the US were found
to have large second FPC scores with associated strong increasing trends. These large
shifts are reflected in their rank volatility, where Spain and especially the US visibly
stand out (Section S.6 in the Supplement). On the other hand, the epidemic situations
in Norway and Singapore have improved over time relative to other countries, especially
during the first 40 days for the latter. However, Norway still has a somewhat severe
situation overall, and Singapore’s percentile rank starts to rise in the last one third of the
period. In contrast to these extremes, Poland has relatively stable ranks over time and
also moderate epidemic situations compared to other countries. Overall the percentile
trajectories are more volatile during the first 25 days. By the end of the interval however,
the ranks have become relatively stable, as seen by the fewer number of intersections
between paths.

Time evolution and forecasting of case trajectories
Frequently-updating forecasts for viral transmission

Since the virus reaches countries at staggered times, countries with earlier exposure times
hold valuable information for predicting those which were more recently exposed. This
makes it possible to employ a dynamic FPCA approach to make short-term predictions of
future trajectories by borrowing “future” information from countries for which a trajectory
over a longer time interval is available, due to their earlier exposure in calendar time. Like
FPCA, this is based on the assumption that there are common shape features that explain
much of the variation. Borrowing of information from trajectories observed over a longer
time stretch to inform trajectory prediction for those observed over a shorter time period
is the key for dynamic FPCA.
The dynamic FPCA (dynFPCA) approach aims at continuously predicting future trajectories based on the most recently available data. Motivated by the rapidly updating
nature of the COVID-19 case trajectories and their FPCA representation, dynFPCA harnesses the evolving trajectory data to predict future cumulative case counts. We illustrate
this for 10-day-ahead predictions that are constructed on repeating intervals. Then, after
the 10-day forecast has passed, one can compare the actually observed trajectories with
the predicted trajectories over this interval. If the prediction underestimates the number
of cases per capita this means that the country experienced a higher caseload than expected which could be due to a worse than average performance or to increased testing.
Similarly an over-estimate in the prediction signifies a better than expected performance
at the time of the prediction.
Since FPCA summarizes an observed curve as a finite vector of FPC scores, it is
enough to predict just the FPC scores for the curve we wish to forecast. The scores

may then be translated back into a curve on the entire interval, even if the scores are
only estimated using a partially observed trajectory (see Methods: dynFPCA). The FPC
scores are estimated using the conditional expectation approach [29], and the number
of scores to estimate was chosen by an AIC criterion. The expression for conditional
expectation contains quantities which are estimated from the entire sample of curves and
thus the predictions borrow strength from the data of all countries. See the discussion in
Methods for more technical details.
The predictions can be viewed in conjunction with the reduction in workplace mobility per country as reported by Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports [30] to
quantify the magnitude of voluntary or mandated lock-downs (see Methods: Data). Early
studies of the effects of lock-downs have estimated the delay until they affect the caseload
to be roughly two weeks, roughly in line with the delay between infection and a recorded
positive test result [6, 31].
Japan is a visible outlier in both measures (Figure 5), in the sense that it has a very
low and flat cumulative case curve, while mobility levels do not decrease much, as the
Japanese government did not issue lock-down orders and employers by and large continued
to require physical presence at the workplace. Other countries with relatively flat curves
include India and the Philippines. These countries acted early, as evidenced by major
drops in workplace mobility early in the trajectory when the total caseload was still low.
Another group of countries with early drops in mobility includes Argentina, Chile and
some other countries in South America as well as Poland. For countries that quickly
reduced mobility, dynFPCA forecasts (and the eventually observed counts) reach much
lower heights than those which did not. On the other hand, a group of mostly European
countries (including Germany, the UK, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Spain and Switzer-

land) showed reduced mobility only after there were already a significant number of cases
present in the population, which appears to have been too late to slow the momentum of
infectious spread. As a consequence, their trajectories not only increase more rapidly but
also reach higher overall levels than predicted. After the first two 10-day periods, which is
characterized by high volatility as seen in the rank analysis, the dynFPCA method tends
to predict the trajectories very accurately once curves begin to bend flatter.

2.2.2

Time-dynamics for correlates of doubling rates and case fatality

To quantify the effect of mobility reduction on dynamic FPCA predictions, we studied
its effect on doubling rate, in addition to the effects of other demographic predictors that
might play a role in shaping the trajectories. Understanding the factors which correlate
with increased or decreased rates of infection is critically important for policymakers
and societies. As local situations evolve and the pressure to reopen mounts, an equally
important aspect is understanding how these associations might change over time, and
when predictors are particularly relevant, as it is likely that the effect of predictors is not
stationary but rather varies over the course of the infection.
To investigate the time-varying relationship between a country’s demographics and
mobility reduction and outcome measures like the doubling and case fatality rates, we
applied a functional concurrent regression model and empirical dynamics (see Methods).
Doubling rate, γ(t), and case fatality rate, CFR(t), as time-varying responses have been
traditionally used in epidemiological modeling [16, 27, 32, 33]. Low doubling rates indicate
successful containment of viral transmissions, while low case fatality rates indicate better
outcomes in terms of the mortality of infected populations. Mean doubling rate and case
fatality rates over time are depicted in Figure 6. We caution that estimates of the case

functions for each regressor are displayed alongside their 95% confidence bands in Figure 7.
A stretch of time where the confidence band does not touch 0 suggests that the effect of
that predictor is locally significant during that time interval.
Doubling Rates
Higher doubling rates reflect faster spread of infection and our analysis shows that they
are not associated with higher population density in a consistent positive or negative
way. The fraction of population over age 65 has a significant but complex effect on
doubling rates. During the priming period, the doubling rate is positively correlated
with demographically older populations, but this effect goes into reverse from day 25 on,
perhaps as the presence of older members of society promotes additional self-isolation;
however it is quite possible that this association is due to the potential confounding effect
that many later mobility-reducing countries have older populations.
The additional effect of total cases per capita is significantly positive at the very
start, but the concurrent regression slope estimate tends to be negative in the following
period, which portends a dynamic regression to the mean effect [24], i.e., countries with
doubling rates away from the mean tend to gravitate back to the mean during the early
time period, reflecting declining variation across countries. The mean curve in Figure 6
indicates monotone declining doubling rates, so countries which did not have many cases
in this period tend to catch up to the mean behaviour. Doubling rates are for the most
part positively correlated with the size of the decline in workplace mobility with a lag of
13 days, which suggests that reduced mobility may significantly slow the growth rate of
confirmed cases, though this benefit is only seen approximately 2 weeks later.
Figure 8 shows the predicted doubling rate for sixteen countries according to the
historical functional linear model (see Section S.4 in the Supplement). Japan only has

predictions after day 15 because the earlier mobility information is not available. Domains
where the observed doubling rate is higher than the predicted indicate periods when the
countries are doing worse than expected. The doubling rate of most countries is less
predictable in the early stage but can be very well predicted later on, which may be
partly a consequence of the dynamic regression to the mean effect as visualized in the left
panel of Figure 6. Countries with relatively poorly predicted trajectories include Japan,
India, Egypt, the Philippines and the US. This may be due to low testing rates, where
the testing rate in Japan is reported to be much lower than other countries. The US had
an incredibly low doubling rate in the beginning but also low levels of testing. It did
much worse after 10 days and observations were in line with predictions only after day
35. Poland also behaved worse in the beginning but the doubling rate dropped to the
predicted rate at day 10. The time points when improvement set in were about 1.5 to 2
weeks after the workplace mobility began to drop. This possibly indicates the lockdown
policy was particularly effective in these two countries.
Case Fatality Rates
Case fatality rates exhibit explosive behavior dynamics as seen in the effect curve of
CFR(t), which is positive after day 15. This means that case fatality rates either above
or below the mean fatality rate curve in Figure 6 tend to move even further away from
the mean as time progresses, as seen in Italy’s curve, for example. A possible explanation
for this could be that an already overwhelmed healthcare system is predestined for future
worse outcomes as the disease continues to spread and resources get even more scarce.
Higher case fatality rates generally do not correlate strongly with population density, but
are positively associated with demographically older countries, which is not surprising.

Discussion

In this study, we have explored a battery of functional approaches for modeling the cumulative COVID-19 case trajectories by pooling data across countries, which is facilitated
by the curve-based methodology of functional data analysis. These techniques provide a
natural and intuitive framework for comparing case trajectories, constructing principled
forecasts for future case counts, and quantifying the time-varying effects of covariates.
A major strength of the functional data approach is the borrowing of information across
curves, i.e., models and predictions for case counts carry knowledge gained from the entire
sample of curves and not just that of a single country’s data. This approach enables the
modeling of time-varying associations and results in dynamic effects which are reflective
of the changing nature of the infectivity cycles and their dependence on covariates. It
also offers a flexible and non-parametric alternative to rigidly-structured epidemiological

models.
The advantages afforded by a functionally-minded approach are not immune to limitations imposed by data quality, however. The bias in COVID-19 case count is difficult
to control for, as the causes of under-reporting are several and complex (e.g., the delay
between infection and confirmation, confounds in testing availability, prevalence of asymptomatic carriers, etc.). Findings regarding individual countries must be evaluated in light
of the their unique set of biases. Indeed, this issue does not yet have a clear solution and
warrants continued attention. A feature of our analysis that is favorable is that while
absolute case counts may be subject to reporting error, the trends in time-dynamics on
which we focus here are more robust, in the sense that biases for a given country may
affect the entire trajectory, although to a different degree over time as for example testing
is ramped up.
Applying functional PCA led to the discovery of four main patterns of disease progression since initial exposure and to identify the countries which follow them. A complementary analysis of percentlle rank dynamics allows for comparison of relative performance
of countries at different points in time. In terms of predictive modeling, we introduce
a dynamic FPCA approach for forecasting country-specific case counts, illustrated with
10-day forecasts. These forecasts, when compared to the eventually observed curves, can
illustrate whether a country over- or under-performs during a given shorter time period.
Lastly, we apply concurrent regression to quantify the effects of baseline and time-varying
covariates, such as population density and reduction in social mobility over time. We distill the results of our analysis into seven key messages, summarized with their associated
methods as follows:
• The mean trajectory of log-cumulative case counts per capita increases linearly

(representing exponential growth) until around day 25 at which time it starts to
bend. Variations from this mean trend behave according to a combination of two
distinct and uncorrelated patterns of growth. The first pattern corresponds to a
baseline level of viral spread which changes little over time; the second corresponds
to a marked increase or decrease of the transmission rate after the first 25 days of
exposure (Functional PCA, Figures 2 and 3).
• A country’s relative performance in terms of prevention stabilizes after an approximately month-long priming period. How well a country handled the situation during
this initial window largely determined their final standing after 67 days of exposure
(Rank Dynamics, Figure 4).
• Countries which were late to reduce social activity perform worse both relative to
other countries and in terms of their own projected case counts (Dynamic FPCA,
Figure 5).
• Trajectories of countries with earlier exposure times contain valuable information
for forecasting case counts for more recently exposed nations. The curve-based
methods of functional data analysis are uniquely suited for pooling information
across a sample of trajectories, including those which are only partially observed.
(Dynamic FPCA, Figure 5)
• Reduction in workplace mobility is associated with lower spread of the virus, though
the effects are lagged. Benefits of reduced social mobility are delayed by roughly
two weeks (Functional Concurrent Regression).
• Baseline demographics are significantly associated with doubling rates during specific time windows. More densely populated countries had higher initial rates of

viral transmission, though this association faded after 20 days of exposure. Demographically older countries typically experience higher rates of spread during the
first 25 days of exposure before course-correcting and enjoying lower doubling rates
thereafter (FCR, Figures 6, 7 and 8).
• Case fatality rates exhibit positive-feedback patterns of severity. After the first
two weeks of exposure, higher than average case fatality rates foreshadow increased
mortality in the future. Meanwhile, countries which boast lower than average case
fatality rates typically improve upon them even further. Demographically older
countries also suffer higher case fatality rates, as expected. (FCR, Figures 6 and 9)
The first three key messages highlight the importance of early responses to the exposure, particularly during the first 25 days, a period that we have reason to characterize
as a priming period. For example, the UK and Greece both have average baseline levels
of spread, but Greece successfully maintains a level of containment while the UK suffers
increased spread of the virus. The differences in initial responses across countries with
similar baselines may be the key to understanding the factors which cause a country’s
case load to escalate rapidly. The two patterns of growth identified here may serve as
a useful jumping-off point for answering other similar lines of questioning. The importance of enacting preventative measures early is reaffirmed by our analysis, as countries
who decreased social mobility before reaching high levels of spread did better than their
predicted case counts and generally had less severe situations at the end of the interval.
The last three points highlight how factors may be relevant only during specific time
periods. For example, one might hypothesize that a country with high population density
would experience elevated transmission rates uniformly through time, as the population
density is more or less constant. Our findings, however, suggest that this is not the case, as

population density is uncorrelated with the doubling rate after the initial priming period.
Careful consideration of baseline predictors with dynamic effects may indirectly reveal
the mechanism through which the predictor acts on the response. Here, the detrimental
impacts of high density living may be lessened or completely eliminated by the adoption
of mobility reduction efforts.
The positive-feedback behavior seen in case fatality rates likely reflects the range in
the ability of healthcare systems to cope with surges of cases. Struggling countries are
expected to have elevated mortality rates, and as outbreaks become more severe, hospitals
which are already overwhelmed suffer even higher rates of death. Conversely, we expect
countries who have ample healthcare resources to have lower case fatality rates. Systems
which are managing well eventually go on to enjoy even lower rates of mortality, perhaps
as medical workers gain experience at treating the disease.
The code for implementing the methods employed for this analysis and also various
other functional methods is publicly available in the R package fdapace [34].

Data

Our analysis focuses on modeling and predicting the cumulative number of cases per
million individuals in log scale, using information obtained from the COVID-19 Data
Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins
University, which was accessed on May 18, 2020. The data consist of the cumulative
number of confirmed cases and deaths per day since Jan 22, 2020 for several countries
and is publicly available on Github at https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19.

Since the pandemic reached individual countries at staggered times, we consider a time
interval T = [0, 66] consisting of 67 days where the initial time t = 0 represents the
earliest date at which at least 20 confirmed cases were reported.
The cumulative number of cases per million individuals on log scale is formally defined
as

Population size

where t ∈ [0, 66]. Defining the initial time t = 0 in such a way aligns trajectories according
to the onset of the pandemic in a given country and allows for temporal comparisons across
nations even if they were first exposed to the virus at different times. We include in our
analysis countries with population size at least 100, 000 by 2018 that have suffered at
least 5 deaths by May 18, 2020 and have been exposed to the virus for at least 67 days,
which results in n = 64 countries. A table of the selected countries and of the dates
corresponding to t = 0 for all countries can be found in the Supplement S.1.
Data for population density and demographic percentage above 65 years old as
of 2018 was obtained from the World Bank database which is available at https:
//www.worldbank.org/.

For Iran we used the 2017 data as the 2018 input from

worldbank was unavailable. Taiwan covariate information was not available in worldbank and was obtained from https://www.indexmundi.com/taiwan/#Demographics.
We also use Google community mobility data as a time-varying covariate, available at
https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/. The following countries did not have
Google mobility data available: Albania, Algeria, China, Iceland, Iran, and Russia. See
Supplement S.1 for more details.

4.2

Functional PCA

The key to FPCA comes from the functional analogue of the spectral decomposition for
covariance matrices. To extend this notion to functions, we consider a generic squareintegrable stochastic process C(t), t ∈ T , with mean function µ(t) = E(C(t)) and covariance function G(s, t) = Cov(C(s), C(t)), s, t ∈ T .
Under certain conditions, G(s, t) admits an orthogonal expansion

0 for k 6= l. Here ξk is the functional principal component score (FPC) of X(·) associated with the k th eigenfunction ϕk . Thus, the FPC scores are projections of the centered
stochastic process onto the directions given by the eigenfunctions and summarize how a
function changes from the mean curve along the principal modes of variations. Moreover,
from (4) the centered process is equivalent to ξ1 , ξ2 , . . . .
By truncating the representation in (4) to a finite number of K components one
achieves dimension reduction and can approximate the original stochastic process through

k=1 λ̂k /
K = 2 meets this criterion. Further details can be found in [29].
The modes of variation illustrate the individual effect that each of the scores has on
√
the function C(t). The first mode of variation corresponds to the curve µ(t) + α λ1 φ1 (t),
where α ranges in the interval [−2, 2]. This represents the effect of the first score on C(t)
as it varies between ±2 standard deviations away from the mean. Similarly, the second
mode of variation is obtained by replacing λ1 and φ1 (t) by λ2 and φ2 (t), respectively, in
the previous expression.

4.3

Dynamic FPCA

The approximation in (5) provides a straightforward method for predicting a curve Ci (t),
if we have access to estimates of the mean function, eigenfunctions, and the FPC scores.
We follow the Principal Components Analysis through Conditional Expectation (PACE)
approach proposed for sparse longitudinal data [29]. For dynamic forecasting we proceed
as follows: Suppose there are n countries for which trajectories have been observed for
t0 + ∆t days, i.e., for the ith country, i = 1, ..., n, the current span of observations [0, Ti ]
is such that Ti > t0 + ∆t. If the number of countries n is not too small, the idea is to
predict the future trajectory of the n + 1st country by borrowing information from the
other n countries which have been observed for the time span to be predicted. Suppose

Empirical Dynamics

The severity of infectious disease spread is commonly modeled using doubling time and
case fatality rates. Here we describe time-varying regression models for these quantities
inspired by empirical dynamics [24], which is an approach which systematically models the
derivatives of smooth processes using the process itself. Technical details about empirical
dynamics can be found in Section S.5 of the Supplement.

Doubling Rates

Let Nc (t) denote the total confirmed cases at time t. Then the doubling time κ(t) at time
t is such that
Nc (t + κ(t))
= 2.

We use the data adaptive criterion described in Section S.5 of the Supplement to select
an optimal choice of lag ∆, which for our analysis is 14 days. Figures 3 and 4 in Section
S.7 of the Supplement illustrate the strong multi-collinearity among the different community mobility patterns, so we utilize only workplace mobility. Note that in (9) we model
the doubling rate γ(t) instead of the doubling time κ(t) which circumvents the numerical
issues involved with a vanishing
