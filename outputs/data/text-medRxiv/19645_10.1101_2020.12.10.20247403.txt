COVID-19 has shown a high potential of transmission via virus-carrying aerosols as supported by growing evidence.
However, detailed investigations that draw direct links between aerosol transport and virus infection are still lacking.
To fill in the gap, we conducted a systematic computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-based investigation of indoor air
flow and the associated aerosol transport in a restaurant setting, where likely cases of airborne infection of COVID-19
caused by asymptomatic individuals were widely reported by the media. We employed an advanced in-house large
eddy simulation (LES) solver and other cutting-edge numerical methods to resolve complex indoor processes simultaneously, including turbulence, flow–aerosol interplay, thermal effect, and the filtration effect by air conditioners.
Using the aerosol exposure index derived from the simulation, we are able to provide a spatial map of the airborne
infection risk under different settings. Our results have shown a remarkable direct linkage between regions of high
aerosol exposure index and the reported infection patterns in the restaurant, providing strong support to the airborne
transmission occurring in this widely-reported incidence. Using flow structure analysis and reverse-time tracing of
aerosol trajectories, we are able to further pinpoint the influence of environmental parameters on the infection risks
and highlight the needs for more effective preventive measures, e.g., placement of shielding according to the local
flow patterns. Our research, thus, has demonstrated the capability and value of high-fidelity CFD tools for airborne
infection risk assessment and the development of effective preventive measures.

The COVID-19 pandemic (caused by the SARS-CoV-2)
has led to more than 69 million infections and 1.5 million
deaths as of writing. A growing number of evidence has
suggested airborne transmission of respiratory droplets, either both produced from asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic
individuals or none, is a potential pathway that contributes
to the wide spread of the disease1–4 . In particular, an incidence in a restaurant in Guangzhou, China, where a single asymptomatic COVID-19 patient caused the infection of
eight people sitting in the same and two adjacent tables, has
been widely reported in the media5,6 and recent scientific

breathing or talking can stay suspended in the air for hours,
and they can accumulate, particularly in indoor spaces with
poor ventilation, imposing high infection risk to individuals
who inhale them7–11 . Under such circumstances, the commonly adopted social distancing rules can no longer serve as
a proper preventive measure12 . As a result, there is a dire
need for science-driven risk assessment tools that can provide actionable and more appropriate guidelines under different practical settings. Despite numerous analytical and
numerical modeling work that provide the first order estimate of aerosol exposure and corresponding airborne infection risk13–15 , only recently, the computational fluid dynamics

Our simulation employs an advanced in-house CFD solver
and uses cutting-edge numerical methods (i.e., advanced immersed boundary (IB) method, stochastic modeling of Brownian motion and effect of subgrid-scale (SGS) flow structures on aerosols, Cunningham slip correction, etc.) to resolve complex indoor processes, including turbulence, flow–
aerosol interaction, thermal effect, and the filtration effect by
air conditioners. Such a combination of high-fidelity numerical methods, several of which has not been adopted in the
past simulation work of indoor airflow, allows us to depict a

velocity fluctuation.
Figure 4 shows the streamlines of the mean flow traced forward from the outlets of the ACs, under different ventilation
rates and thermal settings. The flow structures in the cases
without the consideration of thermal effect are displayed in
Figs. 4(a) and (c). It is observed that a recirculation flow with
the size of the width of the room is formed in front of the ACs
in cases AC14DT00 and AC112DT00, where the air ejected
from the ACs first moves along the initial jet direction, turns
to the floor direction once it reaches the wall, moves downward until reaching the floor, turns back towards the ACs,
moves under the tables, and in the end, is sucked into the ACs
through the inlets. In the cases with the consideration of thermal effect, the flow structures are more complex, as shown in
Figs. 4(b) and (d). It is found that the cold air blown from
the ACs moves downward at an angle due to the interaction
between the cold jet of a higher density and the rising thermal
plume of a lower density near T3. Before reaching the floor,
the cold air is heated by the interaction. Comparing cases

The exchange between the indoor and outdoor airs is investigated. To reduce the concentration of virus-laden aerosols,
besides applying the filtration system, the most commonly
used method is to keep exchanging indoor and outdoor airs.
Fresh outdoor air can reduce the indoor aerosol concentration through the dilution effect. Figure 5 shows the streamlines of the mean flows traced backward from the restroom.
As shown, the range covered by these streamlines varies
with indoor conditions. The shortest range is from the tables in front of AC4 to the restroom, which occurs in cases
AC14DT00 and AC112DT00, while the longest range is from
the space in front of AC1 to the restroom, which happens in
case AC112DT10. Figure 5 also shows that there are barely
any streamlines near T1-3 that are directly connected to the
restroom and thus it is less likely for the aerosols in this area
to exit the restaurant, which is consistent with the measurement by Li et al.9 .

through the fluctuating shear forces ft + f pt . The aerosol exposure index in the statistically steady state results from the
combination of all these effects.

Figure 7 shows the iso-surfaces of aerosol exposure index
C for C = 0.1Cmax (in black) and C = 0.01Cmax (in yellow)
under different ventilation rates and thermal settings, where
Cmax is the maximum of C. Comparing the iso-surfaces
of 0.1Cmax and 0.01Cmax , we can see that the former is
closer to patient zero and located around T2, while the latter reaches T1 and T3 in cases AC14DT00, AC112DT00,

fore, there are more aerosols concentrated inside the isosurface of 0.01Cmax in case AC14DT00 than the other three
cases, because the stronger air flows due to the higher qAC
and thermal effect in cases AC14DT10, AC112DT00, and
AC112DT10 drive more aerosols to collide and deposit on the
walls near T1-3, so that the total numbers of aerosols have
lower values in the latter three cases. Comparing the range
reached by the iso-surfaces of 0.01Cmax in the x−direction
with that reached in the z−direction, we can observe that in all
the cases the aerosol exposure index decays faster along the
x−direction than in the z−direction, since the mean flow drag
fm is dominant in the z−direction over in the x−direction due
to the jet flow from AC1. Moreover, the topography of the
iso-surface of 0.01Cmax varies with the ventilation rates and
thermal settings. Figures 7(a) and (c) display an L-shaped
contours of C inside the iso-surface of 0.01Cmax in cases
AC14DT00 and AC112DT00. The lower aerosol exposure index in the region between the two sides of the L-shape is due
to the turbulent dispersion around the jet flow. Figures. 7(b)

the region close to patient zero to the wall and the inlet
of AC1. The isolines of C/Cmax displayed in Figs. 11(a)
and (c) are elongated in the same direction around T3, from
C/Cmax = −1.2 to C/Cmax = −1.9. The elongation indicates
the aerosol spreading, which is due to the transport by the
mean flow shown in Figs. 11(a) and (c). Comparing Fig. 11(a)
with (c), the isolines in the latter figure are sharper near the
spot below AC1. This is because the stronger suction in case

As shown in Figs. 11(b) and (d), in both the cases AC14DT10
and AC112DT10, there exists a peak of the iso-surface of
C/Cmax = −1.8, which is located above the surface of T3.
The isoline of C/Cmax = −2.1 in Fig. 11(b) indicates a local high aerosol exposure index region, which corresponds
to the peak observed in Fig. 10(b) in case AC14DT10. Also
in Fig. 11(d), from C/Cmax = −1.4 to C/Cmax = −2.2, the
elongation of the isolines above T2 corresponds to the peak
observed in Fig. 10(d). The streamlines in parallel with the

Prediction of infection risk based on the simulated results

In this section, first, a discussion about using the simulated
results to predict the infection risk of COVID-19 is presented.
Then, the simulation-based distribution of the infection risk
is illustrated and explained by linking it to the analysis in
Sec. III B.
There are various factors that can determine the total infection risk of COVID-19 associated with airborne transmission.
According to Mittal et al.50 , the total infection risk Rin is the
product of the risk functions of a series of complex factors
and processes, which can be expressed as

associated with the heated air to interact with the cold air
in the jet above T3. Comparing the peak observed in case
AC14DT10 with the one observed in case AC112DT10, the
latter is located lower, because in the latter case, the cold jet
from AC1 has stronger momentum, which makes the converging point closer to the surface of T3.
