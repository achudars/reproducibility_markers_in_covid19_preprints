Dynamics and Development of the COVID-19 Epidemics in the US
– a Compartmental Model with Deep Learning Enhancement
Qi Deng, DBA12*
Abstract
Background: Compartmental models dominate epidemic modeling. Estimations of
transmission parameters between compartments are typically done through stochastic
parameterization processes that depend upon detailed statistics on transmission characteristics,
which are economically and resource-wide expensive to collect. We apply deep learning
techniques as a lower data dependency alternative to estimate transmission parameters of a
customized compartmental model, for the purposes of simulating the dynamics of the US
COVID-19 epidemics and projecting its further development.
Methods: We construct a compartmental model. We develop a multistep deep learning
methodology to estimate the model’s transmission parameters. We then feed the estimated
transmission parameters to the model to predict the development of the US COVID-19
epidemics for 35 and 42 days. Epidemics are considered suppressed when the basic
reproduction number ( ଴ ) becomes less than one.
Results: The deep learning-enhanced compartmental model predicts that ଴ will become less
than one around June 19 to July 3, 2020, at which point the epidemics will effectively start to
die out, and that the US “Infected” population will peak round June 18 to July 2, 2020
between 1·34 million and 1·41 million individual cases. The models also predict that the
number of accumulative confirmed cases will cross the 2 million mark around June 10 to 11,
2020.
Conclusions: Current compartmental models require stochastic parameterization to estimate
the transmission parameters. These models’ effectiveness depends upon detailed statistics on
transmission characteristics. As an alternative, deep learning techniques are effective in
estimating these stochastic parameters with greatly reduced dependency on data particularity.

Introduction
The COVID-19 pathogen that ravages China, Europe and the US since December
2019 is a member of the coronavirus family, which also includes the SARS-CoV and MERSCoV. In the US, as of June 4, 2020, there have been 1,872,660 confirmed cases and 108,211
deaths.
The COVID-19 pandemic is still in progress, and most of the noticeable early
research is of descriptive nature, focusing on reported cases to establish the baseline
demographic parameters for the disease, such as age, gender, health and medical conditions,
in addition to the disease’s clinical manifestations, in a Chinese context. These studies
includes reports on demographic characteristics, epidemiological and clinical characteristics,
exposure and travel history to the epicenter, illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases1–5,
as well as epidemiological information on patients from social networks, local, national and
international health authorities6. The spread of SARS-CoV-2 outside of China (e.g. Iceland)
is also analyzed7, albeit limitedly. From a US perspective, concerned with the worsening
situation in New York City, researchers characterize information on the first 393 consecutive
Covid-19 patients admitted to two hospitals in that city8.
Some stage-specific studies on COVID-19 patients have also been carried out,
including a single-centered, retrospective study on critically ill adult patients in Wuhan,
China9, and a retrospective, multi-center study on adult laboratory-confirmed inpatients (≥ 18
years old) from two Wuhan hospitals who have been discharged or have died10.
COVID-19 epidemic modeling
There have been attempts to model the COVID-19 epidemic dynamics. These studies
all add a worldwide mobile dimension, reflecting a higher level of mobility and globalization

in 2020 than 2003 (SARS) and even 2013 (MERS). The SEIR model is used to infer the
basic reproduction ratio, and simulate the Wuhan epidemic11; it considers domestic and
international air travel to/from Wuhan to other cities to forecast the national and global
spread of the virus. More sophisticated models have also been developed to correlate risk
levels of foreign countries with their travel exposure to China12–13, including a stochastic
dual-SEIR approach on both Wuhan population and international travelers to estimate how
transmission have varied over time from Wuhan to international destinations13. Simulations
on the international spread of the COVID-19 after the start of travel ban from Wuhan on Jan
23, 2020 have also been conducted14, which apply the Global Epidemic and Mobility Model
(GLEAM) to a multitude of Chinese and international cities, and a SEIR variety (SLIR) to
project the impact of human-to-human transmissions.

To simulate the transmission

mechanism itself, a Bats-Hosts-Reservoir-People (BHRR) network is developed to simulate
potential transmission from the infection sources (i.e., bats) to humans15.
Since March 2020, with the COVID-19 outbreak winding down in China, researchers
have dedicated more efforts in analyzing the effectiveness of containment measures.
Mobility and travel history data from Wuhan is used to ascertain the impact of the drastic
control measures implemented in China16. A research investigates the spread and control of
COVID-19 among Chinese cities with data on human movements and public health
interventions17. Utilizing the contact data for Wuhan and Shanghai and contact tracing
information from Hunan Province, a group of researchers build a transmission model to study
the impact of social distancing and school closure18.
Theoretical Foundation
Compartmental models dominate epidemic modeling on COVID-19 epidemics (and
previous coronavirus outbreaks), and they require detailed statistics on transmission

characteristics to estimate the stochastic transmission parameters between compartments.
Essentially, these models correlate factors such as geographic distances and contact
intensities

among heterogeneous subpopulations with

gradient probability decay.

Technically, transmission parameterization applies Bayesian inference methods, such as
Marcov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) or Gillespie algorithm19 simulations to form probability
density functions (PDFs) on cross-section, in order to estimate parameters for each timestep
of a multivariate time series construct.

These detailed statistics on transmission

characteristics are economically and resource-wide expensive to collect.
We are particularly interested in extended compartmental models that cover multiple
inter-connected and heterogeneous subpopulations10,15,20. There are also some pure time
series analyses on epidemic dynamics outside of the compartmental modeling mainstream,
for example, the AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) approach21 that is
typically found in financial applications. They provide another perspective.
We develop a multistep, multivariate deep learning methodology to estimate the
transmission parameters.

We then feed these estimated transmission parameters to a

customized compartmental model to predict the development of the US COVID-19 epidemic.
We establish a SEIR-variety discrete time series on a daily interval as the theoretical
foundation for a deep learning-enhanced compartment model. We start with the construction
of a so called SEIRQJD (SEIR-Quarantined-Isolated-Deceased) model (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1. – The SEIRQJD Model
We use the US COVID-19 epidemic datasets from John Hopkins University Center
for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE) Github COVID-19 data depository, which
do not include direct Exposed (E) and quarantined (Q) data, we set all transmission
parameters to/from the “E” and “Q” compartment ( ,

,

) to zero. Furthermore, the

datasets assume that all Deaths (D) arise from the Isolated population (J), thus we also set the
transmission parameter from Infectious (I) to Deceased (D),

, to zero. We then simplify

the SEIRJD model to a SIRJD (SIR-Isolated-Deceased) construct, in which a population is
grouped into five compartments:
1. Susceptible (S): The susceptible population arises at a percentage ( ) of a net influx
of individuals ( ).
2. Infectious (I):

The infectious individuals are symptomatic, come from the

Susceptible compartment, and further progress into the Isolated or Recovered
compartments.
3. Isolated (J): The isolated individuals have developed clinical symptoms and have
been isolated by hospitalization or other means of separation. They come from the
Infectious compartment and progress into the Recovered or Deceased compartments

4. Recovered (R):

The recovered individuals come from Infectious and Isolated

compartments and acquire lasting immunity (there has yet any contradiction against
this assumption).
5. Deceased (D): The deceased cases come from Infectious and Isolated compartments.

Data
We collect the following US COVID-19 datasets from the JHU CSSE data
depository①.
1. Dataset 1: The JHU CSSE updates daily records (confirmed, active, dead, recovered,
hospitalized, etc.) from April 12, 2020. We use these detailed case data to construct
the compartmental model.
2. Dataset 2: The JHU CSSE updates two time series on daily basis.

One tracks

confirmed cases and the other dead cases, both starting January 22, 2020. We use the
confirmed/dead cases to form training data for deep learning.
The JHU CSSE dataset has an almost precise period of 7 days (±1 days), reflecting
that a majority of the reporting agencies in the country choose to update their respective
statistics on a weekly, fixed-calendar interval. We run a 7-day moving average on the dataset
to smooth out this “unnatural” data seasonality.
Methodology
We then conduct the following step-by-step operations, to model the US epidemic:
1. We construct an in-sample SIRJD time series starting April 12, 2020 with Dataset 1.
2. We use the in-sample SIRJD time series constructed in Step 1 to come up with an insample time series for the two most critical daily transmission parameters ( and ! ோ).

3. We construct a confirmed/dead-case time series starting from January 22, 2020 (insample) with Dataset 2.
4. We apply two deep learning approaches, the standard DNN (Deep Neural Networks)
and the advanced RNN-LSTM (Recursive Neural Networks – Long Short Term
Memory), to fit the confirmed/dead in-sample time series from Step 3, and predict the
further development of confirmed/dead cases for 35 and 42 days (out-of-sample).
5. We use the confirmed/dead in-sample time series from Step 3 as training data and the
in-sample

and ! ோ time series from Step 2 as training label, and apply the DNN and

RNN-LSTM techniques to predict

and ! ோ for 35 and 42 days (out-of-sample).

6. Finally, we use the predicted (out-of-sample) transmission parameters ( and ! ோ ) from
Step 5 to simulate 35-day and 42-day progressions (out-of-sample) of the SIRJD
model (particularly the SIR portion) in a recursive manner, starting with the data point
of the last timestep from the in-sample SIRJD time series from Step 1.

Results
The results are illustrated in Figs. 3–6 (35-day forecast) and Figs. 7–10 (42-day

In Fig. 3 (35-day forecast), the DNN method predicts on July 3, 2020, the “Infectedto-Recovered” transmission parameter

will rise above and stay above the “Susceptible-to-

Infected” transmission parameter . This means that the value of the basic reproduction rate,
, will become less than one and that the spread of COVID-19 in the US will effectively end

on that day. In Fig. 4 (35-day forecast), the RNN-LSTM method gives a more aggressive
prediction that ! ோ will overtake

on June 22, 2020. Thus, with 35-day forecast, we predict

that the tide of the US epidemic will turn around June 22 to July 3, 2020 timeframe.
In Fig. 5 (35-day forecast), the DNN method predicts that the US “Infected”
population will peak on July 2, 2020 at 1,406,136 individual cases. In Fig. 6 (35-day
forecast), the RNN-LSTM method predicts that the US “Infected” population will peak on
June 21, 2020 at 1,359,619. For 35-day forecast, the deep learning methods predict that the
number of accumulative confirmed cases will cross the 2 million mark on June 10, 2020 at
2,000,525 by DNN (Fig. 5) and on June 11, 2020 at 2,019,923 by RNN-LSTM (Fig. 6).
In Fig. 7 (42-day forecast), the DNN method gives the same prediction (as 35-day
forecast) that ! ோ will overtake

on July 3, 2020. While in Fig. 8 (42-day forecast), the RNN-

LSTM method gives a more aggressive (than 35-day forecast) prediction that ܴ଴ will become
less than one on June 19, 2020. Comparing Figs. 7–8 with Figs. 3–4, we observe that the 42day forecast gives a wider range (June 19 to July 3, 2020) than the 35-day forecast (June 22
to July 3, 2020) on turnaround timeframe. The reason is that, for the same (in-sample)
training data size, longer forecast produces wider probability distributions.
In Fig. 9 (42-day forecast), the DNN method predicts that the US “Infected”
population will peak on July 2, 2020 at 1,406,404 individual cases. In Fig. 10 (42-day
forecast), the RNN-LSTM method predicts that the US “Infected” population will peak on
June 18, 2020 at 1,341,021. For 42-day forecast, the deep learning methods predict that the
number of accumulative confirmed cases will cross the 2 million mark on June 10, 2020 at
2,000,585 by DNN (Fig. 9) and on June 11, 2020 at 2,018,776 by RNN-LSTM (Fig. 10),
which are consistent with the 35-day forecasts.

Discussion
We apply DNN and RNN-LSTM techniques to estimate the stochastic transmission
parameters for a SIRJD model with a discrete time series construct. We then use the
predicted transmission parameters to forecast the further development of the US COVID-19
epidemics.
We make use of two US COVID-19 datasets from the JHU CSSE data depository.
The first dataset includes detailed daily records (confirmed, active, dead, recovered,
hospitalized, etc.) starting from April 12, 2020, from which we construct the SIRJD model.
The second dataset includes time series tracking confirmed and dead cases starting from
January 22, 2020, which we use to construct training data for deep learning. The JHU CSSE
data has an almost precise period of 7 days (±1 days) that masks the true epidemic dynamics,
thus we run a 7-day moving average on the dataset to smooth out this data seasonality.
We then apply DNN and RNN-LSTM deep learning techniques to fit the
confirmed/dead series to predict the further development of confirmed/dead cases, as well as
to predict the “Susceptible-to-Infected” and “Infected-to-Recovered” transmission parameters
( and ! ோ) for 35 and 42 days. Finally, we use the predicted transmission parameters ( and

! ோ) from simulate the epidemic progression for 35 and 42 days.
The deep learning implementations for 35-day forecast predict that the basic
reproduction rate (ܴ଴ ) will become less than one around June 22 to July 3, 2020, and for 42day forecast around June 19 to July 3, 2020, at which point the spread of the coronavirus will
effectively start to die out.
The implementations for 35-day forecast predict that the US “Infected” population
will peak around June 21 to July 2, 2020, between 1,359,619 and 1,406,136 individual cases,

respectively. The implementations for 42-day forecast predict that the peak will arrive on
June 18 to July 2, 2020, between 1,341,021 and 1,406,404 individual cases.
All implementations indicate that the number of accumulative confirmed cases will
cross the 2 million mark around June 10 to 11, 2020.
With the introduction of the deep learning-enhanced compartmental model, we
provide an

effective

and

easy-to-implement

alternative

to prevailing

stochastic

parameterization, which estimates transmission parameters through either probability
likelihood maximization, or Marcov Chain Monte Carlo simulation. The effectiveness of the
prevalent approach depends upon detailed statistics on transmission characteristics among
heterogeneous subpopulations, and such statistics are economically and resource-wide
expensive. On the other hand, deep learning techniques uncover hidden interconnections
among seemly less related data, reducing prediction’s dependency on data particularity.
Future research on deep learning’s utilities in epidemic modeling can further enhance its
forecasting power.
