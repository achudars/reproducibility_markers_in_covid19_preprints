Abstract:
We sought to discover links between antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 and patient clinical
variables, cytokine profiles and antibodies to endemic coronaviruses. Serum from patients of
varying ages and clinical severity were collected and used to probe a novel multi-coronavirus
protein microarray containing SARS-CoV-2 proteins and overlapping protein fragments of
varying length as well as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 proteins.
IgG, IgA and IgM antibody responses to specific epitopes within the spike (S), nucleocapsid (N)
and membrane proteins (M) were higher in older adult patients. Moreover, the older age group
displayed more consistent correlations of antibody reactivity with systemic cytokine and
chemokine responses when compared to the younger adult group. A subset of patients, however,
had little or no response to SARS-CoV-2 antigens and disproportionately severe clinical
outcomes. Further characterization of these serosilent individuals with cytokine analysis revealed
significant differences in IL-10, IL-15, IP-10, EGF and sCD40L levels when compared to
seroreactive patients in the cohort.

Introduction:
With cases continuing to rise in the United States as we pass the annual mark since the beginning
of the pandemic, the scientific community continues to strive to further characterize the immune
response to SAR-CoV-2 infection. COVID-19 leads to a wide range of clinical responses,
varying from minor symptoms, effective immune response and viral clearance to major
respiratory compromise, significantly uncoordinated immune response and subsequent death (1).
Defining antibody responses, both qualitatively and quantitatively, is necessary in characterizing
illness severity, assessing treatment strategies and understanding long-term protection after
vaccine administration.
The antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection consists of a rise in immunoglobulin-M (IgM),
and a simultaneous or nearly synchronous rise in immunoglobulin-G (IgG) within the first 14-20
days of infection, plateauing on average about 6 days after seroconversion (2,3). Antibodies
targeting the nucleocapsid (N) protein, a 488 amino acid (aa) SARS-CoV-2 internal structure that
functions in compaction and protection of the viral RNA genome, and spike (S) protein, a 1273
aa protein that functions in fusion of viral to host cell membranes by binding to cellular
receptors, have been implicated as the dominant antibodies through the course of infection (4–6).

Correlation of antibody levels to severity of disease in previous studies have yielded mixed
results, owing to the heterogeneity of immune responses seen in COVID-19 infection (4,7).
There is limited data, however, on antibodies to specific epitopes within these viral proteins and
their association with disease severity.
A large cohort study consisting of over 17 million patients identified common patient
characteristics and comorbidities as predictors of death from COVID-19. Among these, age was
found to be the strongest predictor of poor outcome (8). This, therefore, raises the question of the
differences in antibody response to infection between age groups. Prior studies have shown that
older age is associated with increased antibody response (9). Other studies suggest that older age
promotes uncoordinated interactions between the branches of the adaptive immune response
which ultimately leads to poor outcomes (10). This suggests that the wide range of clinical
presentations of COVID-19 could be attributed to multiple interactions between the components
of the adaptive response which are influenced by patient demographics and comorbidities.
Given the consistent circulation of endemic coronaviruses in the population, also known as
“common cold” coronaviruses, there is interest in the cross-reactivity of antibodies directed to
these viruses with SARS-CoV-2 and their subsequent effect on clinical outcomes of COVID-19
(11). The endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV) include alpha (HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63)
and beta (HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1) subgroups, with the latter also made up of B
(containing SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) and C (containing MERS-CoV) lineages (11).
Whether it be through cross-protection or antibody-dependent enhancement of infection, more
studies are needed to determine the immune interaction between responses to endemic
coronaviruses and how they affect disease severity from COVID-19.
We sought to fill some of these knowledge gaps through use of a novel multi-coronavirus protein
microarray with its ability to identify antibody responses to small epitopes using various sized
viral protein fragments of SARS-CoV-2. Serum from COVID-19 patients were exposed to these
arrays with subsequent correlation of relevant clinical data collected from medical records. This
microarray also allowed for correlation of the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 to
coronaviruses of other subtypes and lineages. Overall, we looked to further characterize specific
antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2, their correlation with other known coronaviruses and their
association with patient clinical data.

Results:
The multi-coronavirus protein microarray used in this study included four structural proteins and
five accessory proteins of SARS-CoV-2 created through coupled in vitro transcription and
translation (IVTT): S, envelope (E), membrane (M), N, open reading frames (ORF’s) 3a, 6, 7a, 8
and 10. Fragments of these nine proteins were made through IVTT in 50% overlapping segments
of 30 aa, 50 aa and 100 aa lengths. There were additional structural proteins from SARS-CoV,
MERS-CoV, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43, plus overlapping 13-20 aa peptides of the SARSCoV structural proteins and of the S proteins of MERS-CoV, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43
(Table S1). Serum samples were collected from COVID-19 patients of varying ages and disease
severity from April 2020 until July 2020. Thirty of these serum samples were used to probe the
multi-coronavirus protein microarray. Clinical data including patient medical history, clinical
laboratory assays and clinical course were collected from electronic medical records (Tables 1,

Both IgA and IgG antibodies showed higher reactivity to the full-length N protein in the older
age group when compared to younger age group (Fig. 1). Within the N protein, there were
significant differences with respect to age in both IgA and IgG antibody responses to protein
fragments of the 151 to 419 amino acid (aa) region (Figs. 1A and 1B). Within this specified N
region, protein fragments overlap to create an area of congruency in the aa 201-250 region which
showed a higher IgA and IgG response in the older age group when compared to the younger age
group. There was also significantly higher IgA response in the older age group compared to the
younger group in the aa 351-400 region. The IgG response also differed in the N aa 351-400
region although not entirely to significance (p =0.052, fragment 301-400; p =8.2 x 10-3, fragment
351-419). The S1 protein, although displaying overall less reactivity than S2 and N proteins in
this cohort, showed higher IgA and IgG response to aa 551-650 with overlap response at aa 551600 in the older age group compared to the younger adult patients (Fig. 1A). Within the S2
protein, there was significant difference in IgA antibody response between older and younger
patients at aa 451-550. The difference in IgG antibody response between age categories reached
significance for the whole M protein, with a highlighted area of interest at the aa 1-30 region.
The findings from Camerini et al (submitted concurrently) demonstrated similar antibodyreactive regions when looking at patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to
negative controls. Identical regions of interest occurred within the N protein at aa 151-419, S1 aa
551-650 and M aa 1-50 in this cohort and were found to have significant differences in antibody
response in the older compared to younger patient groups in our cohort. Within the S2 protein,
similar reactive regions were detectable in positive patients as in Camerini et al although these
were not found to be significantly different between older and younger patients in this cohort: S2
aa 51-100, S2 aa 201-350 and S2 aa 451-480. There was, however, a significant difference
detected in the IgA response to S2 aa 451-550 between age groups. While this fragment was
found to be also reactive to IgG in this cohort, the difference in reactivity between age groups did
not reach significance (p=0.082). The IgM response in the S2 aa 251-300 region was also found
to have significant differences in reactivity between age groups. Notably, regions within the S2
protein have higher sequence homology between SARS-CoV-2 and the endemic HCoVs
compared to the S1 region. In comparison, antibody response to full-length N, S1, S2 and RBD
proteins by Milliplex analysis did not show significant differences between age groups (Fig. 1A)
Antibody reactivity to antigenic regions were further stratified by ventilator status within the
older age group, but this did not reveal any significant differences in responses when analyzed
between the three groups (i.e. older ventilated, older non-ventilated and younger patients) (Fig.
S1).

SARS-CoV-2 protein fragments identify higher levels of antigenic reactivity in older adult
patients than younger adult patients

SARS-CoV-2 for each gene. Proteins and protein fragments produced in vitro are indicated by bars and
show length and position of each fragment in each protein. Each fragment is drawn twice and shows
group mean log2 normalized signal intensity (SI) of antibody binding to each fragment for COVID-19
patient serum samples in the older age group (“O”, 69-83 yr) and the younger age group (“Y”, 26-39 yr).
Signal intensity is shown by color gradients: IgG (grey to blue), IgA (grey to red), and IgM (grey to
green). Bar pairs shown with gold outline represent significantly differential antibody binding between
older and younger COVID-19 patients, defined as a mean log2 signal intensity ≥ 0.1 in at least one group
and a t-test p value ≤ 0.05. The regions of greatest reactivity for each protein are outlined in magenta. The
inner circle bands represent the responses to full-length S1, S2 and N and the receptor binding domain
(RBD) in the Milliplex assay. (B) A sector of the circular graphic enlarged and labeled in more detail as a
guide to interpreting the full figure. IgG reactivity with the C-terminal region of N protein, spanning aa
sequence 151 to 419 is shown.

Patient serum reactive antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 fragments were then arranged on a
heat map for comparison to patient clinical characteristics and responses to other HCoVs (Fig.
2A). This demonstrated overall higher reactivity of antibody response among the older patients
compared to the younger patients. This was most striking in IgG responses but could also be seen
in IgA responses, although with varying consistency in reactivity levels between the two isotypes
(i.e. a patient with high IgG levels to a specific SARS-CoV-2 fragment did not always have
corresponding high levels of reactivity with IgA and visa-versa). However, antibody reactivity
displayed substantial heterogeneity within age and severity groups with some patients showing
little to no IgG, IgA and IgM response to all SARS-CoV-2 fragments. Notably, patients without
antibody reactivity to protein fragments did have reactivity to proteins of other HCoVs. The
serum IgG response to HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 appeared robust in most patients, but
serum IgA and IgM responses to these HCoVs had less signal intensity.

Correlation of clinical data to antigenic regions of SARS-CoV-2 show association of
antibodies with duration of illness

Linear models were created to observe correlations between patient clinical data and antibody
binding to SARS-CoV-2 fragments which were reactive in at least 10% of the population. After
adjustment for age, sex and ventilator status, a significant correlation was found between IgG
response and days from symptom onset (Fig. 2B). A region of notable correlation was found in
the S1 aa 551-600, which was further supported by significant correlation seen with S1 aa 551650 fragment and S1 aa 501-600 fragment. S2 aa 501-588 was additionally found to have
significant correlation with days from symptom onset. There was also a significant correlation
found between IgG antibody response and length of hospital stay (Fig. 2C). As with days of
illness, this correlation was found to be most notable regarding the S1 aa 551-600 region, further
supported by significant correlation in the S1 aa 551-650 and S1 aa 501-600 fragments.
Additional correlation with length of hospital stay was also seen in the S2 aa 501-588 region.

Figure 2. Heatmap depicting relative IgG (left panel), IgA (middle panel) and IgM (right panel)
antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 as compared to other HCoVs and clinical data.
(A) The heatmaps present the signals of antibody binding to individual proteins and protein fragments
within the antigenic regions of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the full-length structural proteins of MERS-CoV,
HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43, for individual samples. Columns represent serum samples, and rows
represent proteins or protein fragments; 128 SARS-CoV-2 proteins or fragments, five proteins each of
MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63. Antibody log2 signal intensity is shown on a color scale
from grey to red. Sample clinical information is overlaid above the heatmaps and includes sex (M/F), age
category, clinical status (hospitalized, admitted to ICU, ventilated and/or deceased), longevity of
symptoms (days sick prior to sample collection and length of stay “LOS” at hospital), maximum oxygen
levels required and patient measurements including maximum body temperature, body mass index
(“BMI”) and composite score encompassing patient’s other comorbidities (“Comorbidity Score”).
Protein/fragment information is annotated to the left of the heatmaps and includes the virus, full-length
protein name and the amino acid length of the protein fragments (“Tile Length”, as full length, 100, 50 or
30 aa). (B-C) The volcano plots show the statistical effect estimates of days sick prior to serum sample
collection and the length of hospital stay on IgG levels, respectively. The x-axis shows the linear
regression coefficients that were adjusted by age category, sex and requirement of ventilator, and the yaxis shows the inverse log10 p values for each of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins that were reactive (normalized
log2 signal intensity > 1.0) in at least 10% of the study population. The proteins/fragments showing
significant associations after correction for the false discovery rate are highlighted as red triangles and red
labels.

We then assessed the association between antibody reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 fragments
adjusted for age, sex and ventilator status, and cytokine levels in each patient sample analyzed
with the MILLIPLEX® MAP Human Cytokine/Chemokine/Growth Factor Panel (48 Plex; Fig
S2). There were significantly positive correlations seen in IgG, IgM and IgA antibody response
and levels of interleukin-5 (IL-5), tumor necrosis factor-β (TNF-β), platelet derived growth
factor-AB/BB (PDGF-AB/BB), epidermal growth factor (EGF), soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L)
and interleukin-17A (IL-17A) in serum samples. Negative correlations were seen between
antibody responses and levels of interleukin-10 (IL-10), interferon gamma-induced protein 10
(IP-10, or chemokine ligand 10, CXCL10), interferon-α2 (IFN-α2), tumor necrosis factor-α
(TNF-α) and interleukin-15 (IL-15).

Correlations between antibody reactivity to antigenic protein fragments and cytokine/chemokine
levels in patient serum samples were then stratified by age group (Fig. 3). This revealed the same
positive and negative correlations consistently represented in the older age group. In contrast, the
younger adult patient group demonstrated notable heterogeneity in its correlations with antibody
responses. Furthermore, correlations that were significantly positive or negative in the older age
group at times showed a reverse correlation in the younger age group. For instance, IL-10 was
significantly negatively correlated to IgG response most notably to the N and S2 fragments in the
older age group. This, however, was not consistent with the younger age group where
correlations between IgG response to these regions and IL-10 are, although variable, mostly
positive. However, similar correlations did occur regardless of age group, such as with the
significantly positive correlation seen between the IgG response to N aa 200-400 and levels of
IL-5.

Figure 3. Correlation between reactive SARS-CoV-2 proteins and fragments with selected
cytokine/chemokine levels stratified by age group. The heatmap shows the Pearson’s correlation
coefficient between antibody and cytokine levels on a colorimetric scale from negative correlation in
green to positive correlation in red. Significance of the correlations are shown by overlaid asterisks (* =
p<0.05, ** = p<0.005, *** = p<0.0005). Plots are separated by the younger age group (26-39 yr, left) and
older age group (69-83 yr, right). The antigens displayed correspond to proteins and fragments produced
in vitro that were seropositive (≥ 1.0 log2 normalized signal intensity) in at least 10% of the study
population. The cytokines displayed were selected based on significant associations with antibody levels
in linear mixed effects regression models, adjusted for age category, sex and requirement of ventilator.
IL-17A and IL-5 were selected due to significant associations with individual antibody responses in
ordinary least squares regression models adjusted for age category, sex and ventilator. Protein/fragment
information is annotated to the right of the heatmaps and includes the protein name and the amino acid
coordinates in parentheses and the length of the protein fragments (“Tile Length”).

IgG responses to SARS-CoV-2 S2 protein correlate with IgG responses to homologous
endemic human coronavirus S2 proteins
We further assessed the correlation of the IgG response to the S2 and N proteins of SARS-CoV-2
to that of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 (Fig. 4). There were strong linear correlations seen
between antibody reactivity to the S2 protein of SARS-CoV-2 and the S2 proteins of HCoVOC43 and HCoV-NL63 regardless of age or ventilator status (Figs. 4, S3A and S3B). This was
inconsistent with correlations observed between IgG responses to N proteins, which were weakly
correlated, in part due to individuals with little or no reactivity (log2 normalized signal intensity
< 1.0), that suggested a population with either delayed or negative seroreactivity, henceforth
“serosilent” individuals. This was further exemplified through density plots highlighting the
differences in bimodal antibody responses between responding and non-responding individuals.
Notably these individuals were responsive to S2 and N proteins of endemic HCoVs and appeared
to be non-responsive to solely SARS-CoV-2 proteins (Fig. 4).

human coronaviruses. Correlogram depicting the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (Rho) between
IgG normalized signal intensity to SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 full-length S2 and N
proteins produced in vitro. The lower left half of the diagonal shows correlations between reactivity of
sera in the younger age group (27-39 yr), and the upper right half of the diagonal shows the older group
(69-84 yr). Ventilated patients are represented by teal dots and non-ventilated patients are represented by
red dots. Lines of seropositivity defined as a normalized log2 signal intensity ≥ 1 are depicted by
horizonal and vertical dotted lines within each scatterplot. The Rho coefficient is listed in blue lettering in
each box. Outer most right and bottom boxes represent density plots for older and younger age groups,
respectively.

Positive correlations between S2 responses to SARS-CoV-2 and endemic HCoVs were not
observed for IgM, largely owing to the limited IgM response seen to HCoV-OC43 and HCoVNL63 as discussed earlier (Fig. S4A). While similar correlations as with IgG were seen when

comparing IgA responses to S2 proteins of endemic HCoVs, this did not extend to N proteins,
again, due to the limited IgA response in serum (Fig. S4B). When comparing the antibody
response to individual SARS-CoV-2 fragments to endemic coronaviruses, there were diffusely
positive correlations seen between S2 fragments with S2 proteins of endemic coronaviruses,
most notably to HCOV-OC43 (Fig. S5).
Given the notable separation seen in non-responding individuals compared to the rest of the
cohort, cytokine profiles were then assessed in these patients. As the majority of these
individuals were in the older age group, cytokines/chemokines from the older age group were
compared (Fig. 5). We identified four serosilent individuals to both immunodominant SARSCoV-2 proteins, N and S2 (N-, S2-), with an additional two patients that were seronegative to S2
protein (S2-) but seroreactive to N protein (N+) (Fig. S6). Analysis of cytokine/chemokine
responses to all six patients revealed significantly higher IL-10, IL-15 and IP-10 in serosilent
individuals when compared to the rest of the older age group. It also displayed significantly
lower levels of EGF and sCD40L in serosilent individuals (Fig. 5).

Figure 5. Differences in cytokine and chemokine levels between serosilent and seroreactive older
adult COVID-19 patients. The boxplot illustrates the top eleven differences in cytokine levels of those
nonresponding to SARS-CoV-2 full length S2 proteins (S2- “serosilent”; represented by white boxes) and
those responding (S2+ “seroreactive”; represented by grey boxes). Cytokine/chemokine levels are plotted

Discussion:
While this study revealed epitopes seen within SARS-CoV-2 proteins, which corresponded to the
concurrent study by Camerini et al, it additionally revealed how reactivity differed between age
groups and how these same regions correlated with clinical and laboratory data. Although
differences between antibody responses did not reach significance when separated by severity
(i.e., those ventilated vs those who did not require ventilation), there were significant differences
seen between age groups, with higher antibody reactivity apparent in the older age group. We

were additionally able to see correlations in antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 antigenic
fragments and serum cytokine/chemokine profiles along with correlations in reactivity to
endemic HCoVs.
Among the regions of interest highlighted in our study was S1 aa 551-600 region, an area just
past the RBD at the C-terminus of the S1 protein, which has also been noted in other recent
studies involving SARS-CoV-2 epitope mapping (12,13). In our study, IgG reactivity to this
region was not only higher in the older COVID-19 patient cohort but was significantly correlated
with hospital length of stay and days of illness. While differences in reactivity did not reach
significance regarding ventilator status in this small cohort, the correlations found in this study
suggest unfavorable clinical outcomes associated with large levels of antibodies to this region.
Previous studies have also shown a correlation between IgG responses to S1 protein and days of
illness, which likely can be attributed, at least in some part, to reactivity within this region (14).
We further highlighted three regions within the S2 protein: S2 aa 51-100, S2 aa 201-350 and S2
aa 451-480, which have also been implicated in recent epitope mapping studies (12,13). While
small sample size may have limited our ability to see true differences in IgG reactivity within
these regions with respect to severity and age, we were able to see a correlation between
reactivity within the S2 aa 201-350 and hospital length of stay, highlighting clinical implications
to having antibodies to this region.
When antibody reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 was correlated with cytokine/chemokine profiles in
these serum samples, we found consistent correlations existed within the older patient group
while large variations occurred in younger COVID-19 patients. This suggests a clinically
unfavorable cytokine/chemokine profile that correlates with higher antibody reactivity, which
more commonly occurs in older patients. IL-5, a type 2 (Th2) cytokine shown by Lucas et al to
correlate with severe COVID-19 disease, was shown to have a significantly positive correlation
to antibody response to the N aa 200-400 region, which may further suggest poor outcomes
related to Th2 responses (15). Additionally, IL-10 had significant negative correlations to
antibody responses to S2 and N proteins in the older age group, which is consistent with its
known anti-inflammatory properties. Interestingly IL-10 has been implicated in numerous other
viral, bacterial, and protozoal infections whose clinical outcomes were observed to be timedependent of peak IL-10 production and its ability to cause either inhibition of effective
pathogen clearance or prevention of excessive immune response to foreign infectious antigens
(16).
We also found strong correlations between the IgG response to SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-NL63 and
HCoV-OC43 S2 proteins, which have also been noted in other recent epitope studies (12,13).
This has been attributed to considerable sequence homology observed between S2 proteins of
SARS-CoV-2 and endemic HCoVs, particularly to the more closely related endemic
betacoronaviruses (HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1). Associations found in this study suggest
either cross-reactivity of newly produced antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 with other HCoV antigens
in the array or cross-reactivity in which preexisting antibodies to other coronaviruses can
recognize SARS-CoV-2 antigens. While this is difficult to determine without analysis of patient
serum prior to infection, we see evidence of both phenomena occurring in our cohort. Lack of a
concomitant serum IgM response observed in this cohort to endemic HCoVs along with lack of

observed correlation between the IgM response to S2 proteins between them suggests a
preexisting, boosted IgG rather than new, acute antibody production. However, the magnitude of
reactivity to S2 protein and the positive correlation of anti-S2 IgG between SARS-CoV-2 and
endemic HCoVs suggests likely a component of new antibody reactivity to some epitopes due to
significant immune activation. Preexisting, cross-reacting antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 would
allow an opportunity for cross neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 antigens and raises the possibility
of improved clinical outcomes in these patients. This may further explain why children, who are
known to have more consistent exposures to endemic HCoVs, may be more protected from
severe COVID-19 infection (12). However, of note, in our analysis, correlations of antibodies to
S2 proteins between SARS-CoV-2 and endemic HCoVs were apparent regardless of age or
ventilator status, possibly suggesting less of an influence on clinical outcomes.
There was also notably absent antibody reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 proteins among a subset of
individuals in this cohort. Given that these patient samples were collected at a single time point,
it is difficult to know if these represent patients with no response throughout the entire illness
course or are individuals in which antibody levels were slow to respond. Wajnberg et al found
the latter in assessment of longitudinal samples, noting that in addition to a slow antibody
response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, peak titers were lower than patients with a more robust
initial response (17). This may be clinically relevant, as patients with low and slow antibody
response may be those likely to benefit most from SARS-CoV-2 antibody treatment regimens.
We then further characterized serosilent patients by looking at their clinical characteristics and
immune response. Although conclusive analysis is limited by sample size, two out of the four
serosilent (N-, S2-) older adults required ventilation, three were admitted to the ICU and two
were the only deceased patients in the study, suggesting negative clinical outcomes associated
with minimal antibody response in these patients. In contrast to severe COVID-19 disease linked
with high antibody response as discussed above, serosilent patients suggest an alternative
immunologic profile to infection providing an additional avenue for poor clinical outcomes.
Among the cytokine differences discovered between serosilent and responsive patients, IL-10
was implicated as one of the most differential, with serosilent individuals displaying significantly
higher levels compared to the rest of the older patient cohort. This is again congruent with
known influences of IL-10 as discussed above and highlights its potential role in the serosilent
patient cytokine profile (16). We additionally found a significant decrease in sCD40L in
serosilent patients compared to the rest of the group, which is consistent with sCD40L’s known
ability to promote B cell proliferation, differentiation and immunoglobulin production (18).
A substantial limitation in our study was the small sample size which likely limited our ability to
detect relationships between epitopes, cytokines, and clinical outcomes. This further limited in
our ability to statistically analyze and classify our serosilent samples and therefore were
categorized subjectively based on full length IVTT N and S2 protein reactivity. As this small
cohort is meant for hypothesis generation, a larger cohort is needed to further validate our
findings. Our study is also limited to epitopes produced in Escherichia coli which restricts our
ability to see epitopes that require eukaryotic post-translational modification such as
glycosylation. This is particularly relevant in regards to the spike protein, which exists as a
trimer on the virion surface and undergoes conformational changes during viral entry into cells
(6). As addressed in Camerini et al we also observed similar limitations in response to S1

Patients who tested positive for COVID-19 by PCR at the University of Virginia Medical Center
had residual routine lab specimens collected into a biorepository. Serum samples of patients of
varying age and severity were collected from April 2020 until July 2020. Blood collected in
EDTA was centrifuged at 1300 x g for 10 minutes, then plasma was aliquoted and stored at 80°C until testing. Thirty of these serum samples were provided to Antigen Discovery Inc. to be
exposed to protein microarrays as described below.

The first generation multi-coronavirus protein microarray, produced by Antigen Discovery, Inc.
(ADI, Irvine, CA, USA), included 935 full-length coronavirus proteins, overlapping 100, 50 and
30 aa protein fragments and overlapping 13-20 aa peptides from SARS-CoV-2 (WA-1), SARSCoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43. Purified proteins and peptides were obtained
from BEI Resources. All these coronavirus proteins were produced in Escherichia coli except the
SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV S proteins, which were made in Sf9 insect cells and the SARSCoV-2 RBD, made in HEK-293 cells. Other proteins and protein fragments were expressed using
an E. coli in vitro transcription and translation (IVTT) system (Rapid Translation System,
Biotechrabbit, Berlin, Germany) and printed onto nitrocellulose-coated glass AVID slides (Grace
Bio-Labs, Inc., Bend, OR, USA) using an Omni Grid Accent robotic microarray printer (Digilabs,
Inc., Marlborough, MA, USA). Microarrays were probed with sera and antibody binding detected
by incubation with fluorochrome-conjugated goat anti-human IgG or IgA or IgM (Jackson
ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA or Bethyl Laboratories, Inc., Montgomery, TX, USA).
Slides were scanned on a GenePix 4300A High-Resolution Microarray Scanner (Molecular
Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), and raw spot and local background fluorescence intensities, spot
annotations and sample phenotypes were imported and merged in R (R Core Team, 2017), in which
all subsequent procedures were performed. Foreground spot intensities were adjusted by
subtraction of local background, and negative values were converted to one. All foreground values
were transformed using the base two logarithm. The dataset was normalized to remove systematic
effects by subtracting the median signal intensity of the IVTT controls for each sample. With the

Methods:

Clinical data including patient medical history, lab work and clinical course were collected from
the electronic medical record using honest brokers with unique study numbers to ensure
confidentiality (Tables 1, S2). Days from symptom onset were determined through assistance
from an honest broker who read through history and physical exam notes, emergency department
notes, progress notes and discharge summaries of patients with COVID-19. Comorbidity scores
were derived from hazard ratios presented in the OPEN Safely trial by Williamson et al to
appropriately weigh patient comorbidities with previously observed associations in risk of death
from COVID-19 (8). Collection of blood samples and deidentified patient information was
approved by the University of Virginia Institutional Review Board IRB-HSR #22231 and
200110.

Data from the protein microarray was compared to the same thirty samples analyzed with
MILLIPLEX ® SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Panel 1 IgG, IgA, and IgM for comparison (Millipore
Sigma, St. Louis, MO). IgG, IgA and IgM antibodies are captured by specific bead-region
microspheres, each conjugated with SARS-CoV-2 antigen subunits S1, S2, RBD, or N, and are
measured by median fluorescent intensity (MFI). The four antigens are recombinant poly-histagged. Kit instructions were followed. Samples were diluted 1:100 in assay buffer. Ninety-six
well plates were pre-wetted with 200 µL wash buffer, covered with plate sealer and incubated for
10 minutes at room temperature with shaking, then emptied. To all wells, 25 µL of Assay Buffer
was added. Twenty-five µL of each diluted sample was added to the sample wells and 25µL of
Assay Buffer was added to background wells. Sixty µL of both sonicated (30 seconds) and
vortexed (1 minute) analyte and control bead was combined and brought to a final volume of 3
mL with the addition of Assay Buffer. After vortex, 25 µL of bead mixture was dispensed into
each plate well. The plate was sealed and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature with
constant shaking. A handheld magnetic plate washer was used to retain magnetic beads while
liquid contents were discarded appropriately. Wells were washed 3 times with 200 µL wash
buffer. Fifty µL of phycoerythrin-anti-human immunoglobulin (IgG, IgA or IgM per kit in use)
detection antibody was added to each well, plate sealed and incubated 90 minutes at room
temperature with constant shaking. Plates were washed three more times with magnetic plate
washer. 150 µL sheath fluid was added to each well, the plate was then sealed and shaken at
room temperature for 5 minutes. The plate was then read on a Luminex ® MAGPIX™
Instrument System with a minimum of 50 beads of each analyte collected per well. Cytokine
levels were additionally measured in each sample via MILLIPLEX® MAP Human
Cytokine/Chemokine/Growth Factor Panel A (48-Plex) through similar methods.

Student’s t-tests were used for comparison of the individual antibody response means between
the younger and older age groups. Proteins or protein fragments expressed using the IVTT
system were classified as reactive antigens based on a 1.0 normalized signal intensity
seropositivity threshold and seroprevalence cutoff of 10% of the study population (i.e. at least 3
seropositive responses) for IgG, IgA or IgM. Multivariable ordinary least squares (OLS)
regression was used to model associations between antibody and patient information obtained
from electronic records. Antibody responses to individual reactive antigens (n=52) were modeled
as dependent variables, and the following variables were modeled as independent variables: sex,
age category, requirement of a ventilator, days symptomatic prior to sample collection, length of
hospital stay, admission to the ICU, maximum required supplemental oxygen category,
comorbidity score, maximum body temperature during while admitted, body-mass index (BMI),
maximum CRP, maximum ferritin, maximum D dimer, minimum lymphocytes, maximum AST

and troponin lab levels, and the base 2 log-transformed measurements from the Milliplex serum
analysis. Due to the moderate sample size of the study, not all independent variables were
modeled simultaneously. Three “base” variables were used to adjust the effect estimates of all
other independent variables in separate 4-variable models; these base variables were sex, age
category and requirement of a ventilator. Adjustment for the false discovery rate was performed
using the “p.adjust” function in R (19). To select variables associated with SARS-CoV-2-specific
antibodies, linear mixed effects regression (LMER) was used to model all antibody responses
against SARS-CoV-2 reactive antigens with random intercepts at the sample level and antigen
level to adjust for repeated measures. Similar to the approach with OLS regression, LMER
models used the same 3 base variables to fit separate models for all other fixed effects variables.
All coefficients were returned from models fit using restricted maximum likelihood (REML). To
generate P-values for LMER models, the models were refit using maximum likelihood (ML) and
compared by ANOVA against null models with the coefficient removed using ML. Cytokines
and chemokines that were significantly associated with antibody levels in LMER models were
correlated with SARS-CoV-2 reactive antigens using Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Clinical
patient variables were associated with cytokine levels using OLS regression, similarly to
antibody models. Correlation between SARS-CoV-2 S2 and N proteins with HCoV-OC43 and
HCoV-NL63 S2 and N proteins was assessed using Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Samples
were categorized as “serosilent” if full-length S2 IgG responses were less than 1.0 normalized
signal intensity. Differences in median log2 cytokine levels between serosilent and seroreactive
subjects was assessed using Wilcoxon’s rank sum test. Data visualization was performed using
the circlize (20), ComplexHeatmap (21), ggplot2 and corrplot (22)packages in R. The p-values
presented for full-length and overlapping fragments of SARS-CoV-2 proteins were not adjusted
for the false discovery rate, because the measurements are not independent and an appropriate
method of p-value correction was not to our knowledge available for the extent of dependence in
the antibody measurements. As expected, there were high levels of colinearity in the antibody
response to overlapping fragments of different sizes in the reactive regions of SARS-CoV-2
proteins. Although unadjusted p-values were used in these comparisons, the concordance of
fragment antibody binding and differential immunoreactivity in the independent study reported
concurrently in Camerini et al lends confidence that the responses reported are unlikely to be due
to chance. The full results from linear models are included in Supplemental File 1. However,
further studies will be able to validate these findings.
