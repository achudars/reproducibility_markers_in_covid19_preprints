ABSTRACT

22

Objective The outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) imposed

23

a substantial health burden in mainland China and remains a global epidemic

24

threat. Our objectives are to assess the case fatality risk (CFR) among COVID-19

25

patients detected in mainland China, stratified by clinical category and age group.

26

Methods We collected individual information on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19

27

cases from publicly available official sources from December 29, 2019 to

28

February 23, 2020. We explored the risk factors associated with mortality. We

29

used methods accounting for right-censoring and survival analyses to estimate

30

the CFR among detected cases.

31

Results Of 12,863 cases reported outside Hubei, we obtained individual records

32

for 9,651 cases, including 62 deaths and 1,449 discharged cases. The deceased

33

were significantly older than discharged cases (median age: 77 vs 39 years,

34

p<0.001). 58% (36/62) were male. Older age (OR 1.18 per year; 95%CI: 1.14 to

35

1.22), being male (OR 2.02; 95%CI: 1.02 to 4.03), and being treated in less

36

developed economic regions (e.g., West and Northeast vs. East, OR 3.93; 95%CI:

37

1.74 to 8.85) were mortality risk factors. The estimated CFR was 0.89-1.24%

38

among all cases. The fatality risk among critical patients was 2-fold higher than

39

that among severe and critical patients, and 24-fold higher than that among

40

moderate, severe and critical patients.

41

Conclusions Our estimates of CFR based on laboratory-confirmed cases

ascertained outside of Hubei suggest that COVID-19 is not as severe as severe

43

acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome, but more

44

similar to the mortality risk of 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic in hospitalized

45

patients. The fatality risk of COVID-19 is higher in males and increases with age.

Our study improves the severity assessment of the ongoing epidemic and can

Introduction

53

As of March 3, 2020, a total of 80,270 cases of novel coronavirus disease 2019

54

(COVID-19) have been reported in mainland China, including 2,981 deaths. The

55

outbreak is caused by a novel coronavirus of presumed zoonotic origin, the

56

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)1. COVID-19 cases

57

have now been identified in 72 countries, some of which have reported onward

58

local transmission and deaths2. The unprecedented scale of the epidemic has

59

prompted an urgent need for clinical severity assessment, of which the case

60

fatality risk (CFR) is a key metric.

61

A few studies have assessed the fatality risk of COVID-19 but estimates have been

highly variable. Wu et al. estimated that the fatality risk among hospitalized cases

63

was 14% during the early phase of outbreak in Wuhan3. Dorigatti et al. estimated

64

that the CFR among laboratory-confirmed cases was 18% in Hubei province and

65

ranged from 1.2-5.6% outside mainland China4. A recent report of the World

66

Health Organization (WHO)-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019

67

estimated the case fatality risk as 3.8% by dividing the number of deaths at the

68

time of analysis by the number of laboratory-confirmed cases at the time of

69

analysis5. They also reported a higher case fatality risk in Hubei than that in other

70

provinces (5.8% vs. 0.7%)5. However, those estimates would be a lower bound on

71

the CFR for the laboratory-confirmed cases because many cases were still in the

72

hospital and had not reached a final outcome of either death or discharge after

73

recovery6.

74

In the present study, we aimed to assess the CFR among laboratory-confirmed

75

COVID-19 cases detected in mainland China, stratified by different clinical

76

categories (e.g. mild-, moderate-, severe- and critical-patients) and by age group.

77

We also explored the risk factors associated with fatal outcomes.

system to record information on COVID-19 cases since the start of the outbreak

84

of atypical pneumonia cases in Wuhan in late December 2019. A description of

85

the surveillance system is provided elsewhere7. As the epidemic evolves, a total

86

of six versions of case definitions for suspected- and laboratory-confirmed-cases

87

have been issued by NHC7-9. Details are provided in the Appendix table S1.

88

Four clinical categories of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients have been

89

identified by NHC, including mild-, moderate-, severe-, and critical-patients 7-9.

90

Mild patients, introduced in the fifth and sixth versions of COVID-19 case

91

definition, refer to patients with mild symptoms and no radiographic evidence of

92

pneumonia. Moderate patients, introduced in the fourth version of the case

93

definition, refers to patients with fever, respiratory symptoms, and radiographic

94

evidence of pneumonia. Severe patients, introduced in the second version, refers

95

to patients with any breathing problems, finger oxygen saturation, and low

96

PaO2/FiO2 (PaO2 denotes partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood; FiO2

97

denotes fraction of inspired oxygen), etc. Critical patients, a definition used from

98

the very beginning of the outbreak, refer to patients having any respiratory

99

failure, shock, and any other organ failure that requires ICU admission.

100

Patients were discharged when they met all the following criteria: 1) normal

101

body temperature for more than 3 days, 2) significantly improved respiratory

102

symptoms, 3) significant inflammation absorption in lung radiographic findings,

103

and 4) negative nucleic acid detection by real-time RT-PCR using respiratory

Data collection

107

Daily aggregated data (hereafter called aggregated dataset) on the cumulative

108

number of cases were extracted from the websites of national, provincial, and

109

municipal Health Commissions. Individual records on laboratory-confirmed

110

COVID-19 cases (hereafter called individual dataset) were collected from two

111

official publicly available sources from December 29, 2019 through to February

112

23, 2020, including: 1) the websites of national, provincial, and municipal Health

113

Commission; 2) the websites of national and local government affiliated medias.

114

Individual information was extracted and entered into a structured database

115

comprising demographic characteristics, dates of symptom onset, first healthcare

116

consultation, hospital admission, official announcement (reporting date), as well

117

as outcome information (e.g. death/discharge and corresponding dates). Each

118

individual record was extracted and entered by three coauthors and was

119

cross-checked to ensure data accuracy. Conflicting information was resolved

120

based on the Health Commission data. Details on the collection of individual data

121

and assessment of completeness of variables used in the study are provided in

122

125

We restricted analyses of demographic characteristics, risk factors associated

126

with fatal outcome, and key time to event intervals to the provinces outside

127

Hubei, where the majority of individual records were obtained (97.6%,

128

9,651/9,886) as of February 23, 2020. We implemented a multivariate logistic

129

regression model to explore the risk factors associated with death. We included

130

age, sex, economic region10, time interval from symptom onset to first medical

131

consultation, first hospital admission, and laboratory diagnosis. We categorized

132

China into three economic regions (East, Central, West and Northeast) according

133

to gross domestic product per capita in 2018 (see Appendix Figure S1 for map)10.

134

We estimated key time-to-event distributions including symptom onset to first

135

healthcare consultation, hospital admission, laboratory diagnosis, and death or

136

discharge, and from hospital admission to death or discharge. We fitted three

137

parametric distributions (Weibull, gamma, and lognormal) to time-to-event data

138

and selected the best fit based on the minimum Akaike information criterion.

139

We used three methods to estimate CFR among COVID-19 cases. Firstly, we

140

calculated a crude CFR based on the cumulative number of deaths divided by the

141

cumulative number of laboratory-confirmed cases, ignoring the time-lag between

142

symptoms onset and death and resulting right-censoring of outcomes5.

143

In a second approach, we adjusted for delays between hospitalization and death

144

to obtain more accurate estimates of CFR, using the method described by Garske

145

et al. for pandemic influenza A/H1N1 in 200911. For above two methods, we used

146

the aggregated dataset as of February 23, and binomial distributions were used

147

to estimate the 95%CIs.

148

Thirdly, to allow for incomplete information about outcomes, we used survival

149

analyses to allow inclusion of all cases admitted to hospital in the individual

150

dataset, incorporating data for patients who were still in hospital at the time of

151

analysis. In our individual dataset, the outcome was unavailable for some

152

patients because the information was not communicated through public

153

channels, although these patients may have been discharged or died at the time

154

of this writing (hereafter denoted as missing outcome). This is different from the

155

issue of right-censoring for patients still hospitalized whose illnesses have yet to

156

be resolved. The cases who were still hospitalized and those with missing

157

outcome were treated as unresolved in our analysis. A multiple imputation was

158

used to generate outcomes for these patients.

159

For each date , we calculated the number of discharged/deceased patients that

160

required imputation by subtracting the number of discharged/deceased patients

161

in our individual dataset from that in the aggregated dataset (Table S4 in

162

Appendix). All these patients with missing data for outcomes before date were

163

considered for imputation on date . They were randomly selected as discharge

164

or death according to probability calculated using the density of interval from

165

hospital admission to discharge/death. This imputation procedure was repeated

166

100 times to generate 100 imputed datasets for further estimation of CFR.

167

We employed a dual-outcome (discharge or death) time to event framework to

168

estimate CFR based on the fraction F1/(F1+F2)12. F1 and F2 stand for the

169

admission to death distribution and the admission to discharge distribution,

170

respectively.

176

estimates across 100 imputed datasets13.

177

For the survival analysis, we restricted analyses to the provinces outside Hubei,

178

considering the completeness of individual records obtained. When estimating

179

CFR, we excluded cases hospitalized beyond 17 days on each date in the baseline

180

analysis. The choice of 17 days was based on the 90th percentile of the

181

distribution of the time from hospitalization to outcome (discharge/death)

182

among COVID-19 cases in the provinces other than Hubei as of February 23. As a

183

sensitivity analysis, we also considered the 80th and 50th percentiles of this

184

distribution, corresponding to 14 days and 10 days, respectively. As mentioned

185

above, patients were discharged only after testing negative by nucleic acid

186

detection tests on two consecutive days9. Hence, we assumed that these patients

187

had biologically recovered three days prior to the reported date of discharge,

188

accounting for one additional day for delay of laboratory confirmation and

189

official reporting. Accordingly, for the discharged patients, their time from

190

hospitalization to discharge was cut down by three days when estimating the

191

90th, 80th and 50th percentiles of the distribution of the time from hospitalization

192

to outcome.

193

All deaths occurred among critical cases, as reported by China CDC5. Separately

194

for mainland China, Hubei Province, and the provinces outside Hubei, we further

195

estimated CFRs among severe and critical patients by dividing the above derived

196

CFR by proportions of severe and critical patients among all reported COVID-19

197

cases. We used the average of daily proportions among COVID-19 cases who were

198

still in hospitals on each day other than the clinical severity on admission, which

199

were obtained from the aggregated dataset and showed very stable (Table S2,

200

and Figure S2-3 in Appendix). Only Guangdong Province officially reported

201

aggregated data on mild-, moderate-, severe- and critical patients. And thus, for

202

the provinces outside Hubei, we additionally estimated the CFR by these clinical

203

categories using the corresponding proportions in Guangdong Province.

Results

212

As of February 23, 2020, a total of 77,150 laboratory-confirmed cases with 2,592

213

deaths, 24,711 discharged and 49,847 patients who were still hospitalized were

214

reported in mainland China (see Table S2 for details of each province). Of these,

215

provinces outside Hubei accounted for 12,863 (16.7%, 12,863/77,150)

216

laboratory-confirmed cases including 97 deaths (3.7%, 97/2,592), 7,973 (32.3%,

217

7,973/24,711) discharged cases and 4,793 (9.6%, 4,793/49,847) patients who

218

were still hospitalized. We collected individual information from publicly

219

available official sources on 9,651 laboratory-confirmed cases detected outside

220

Hubei by February 23, accounting for 75.0% (9,651/12,863) of total cases

221

reported, 63.9% (62/97) of deceased patients, 18.2% (1,449/7,973) of recovered

222

patients. Of 9,651 cases, unresolved patients accounted for 84.3% (8,140/9,651)

223

(Table 1). See Figure S4 for the epidemic curve of cases with available individual

224

information.

225

The median age of the cases outside Hubei was 45 years (range, four days-97

226

years), and 51% (4,956/9,651) were male. Those who died were significantly

227

older than discharged cases (median age: 77 vs 39 years, p<0.001). 77% (48/62)

228

of deaths occurred in the older adults aged 65 years or above, and 58% (36/62)

229

were male. (Table 1) Multivariate logistic analysis revealed that increasing age,

230

being male, and living in less developed economic regions (e.g. Central region or

231

West and Northeast region) were risk factors for mortality (Table 2). The

232

univariate logistic analysis is shown in Appendix Table S5.

233

The intervals from symptom onset to first healthcare consultation, from

234

symptom onset to hospitalization, and from symptom onset to laboratory

235

confirmation were consistently longer for deceased patients than for those who

236

recovered. Overall, the time interval from symptom onset to death was estimated

237

to be 12.9 days (95%CI: 2.2 to 40.2), and from symptom onset to discharge was

238

16.7 days (95%CI: 8.6 to 28.9). (Table 3)

239

Based on the total patients reported to the surveillance system, the CFR

240

estimated by Garske’s method11 and survival analyses were all higher than the

241

crude CFR (Table 4 and Appendix Table S6). The CFR estimated by Garske’s

242

method11 was 4.52% (95%CI: 4.47% to 4.67%) in mainland China, with highest

243

estimate in Wuhan (6.19%, 95%CI: 6.12% to 6.41%), and lowest in the provinces

244

outside Hubei (0.89%, 95%CI: 0.83% to 1.06%). The CFR estimated by survival

245

analyses was 1.24% (95%CI: 1.24% to 1.24%) among all cases, and 11.21%

246

(95%CI: 11.21% to 11.21%) among severe and critical patients outside Hubei.

247

There was no difference in both overall CFR and that among severe and critical

248

patients outside Hubei estimated by survival analyses or Garske’s method

249

(p>0.05) (Table 4). In sensitivity analyses, we excluded all cases hospitalized for

250

longer than 14 and 10 days, and the estimates were all consistent with those of

251

the baseline analysis, in which we excluded cases with hospitalizations longer

252

than 17 days (p>0.05) (Appendix, Figure S5-6).

253

In the provinces other than Hubei, the CFR increased with age, with highest

254

estimates among patients aged ≥70 years (Figure 1 panel B). The fatality risk

255

among critical patients was 23.8-33.3%, which was 2-fold higher than that

256

among severe and critical patients, and 24-fold higher than that among moderate,

257

severe and critical patients (Figure 1 panel B). The CFR among all cases

258

estimated by survival analyses declined rapidly from 8% on January 25 to around

259

1% on January 28, and remained at 1.2-1.5% afterwards. Patterns were similar

260

for estimates using Garske’s method (Figure 2).

261
262

Discussion

263

We have shown that the fatality risk among detected cases was 0.89-1.24% in the

264

provinces outside Hubei in mainland China and increased with clinical severity.

265

Further, the CFR was estimated at 8.02-11.21% among severe and critical

266

patients. Estimates accounting for right-censoring of unresolved cases were

267

higher than crude estimates. Male patients, older age, and less developed regions

268

were factors associated with a higher CFR. These estimates could represent the

269

most accurate estimates of CFR in China so far.

270

Our study is strengthened by accounting for unknown outcomes among patients

271

who were still in hospital at time of data cutoff. We used Garske’s method

272

developed for pandemic influenza A/H1N1 in 200911, as well as survival analyses,

273

both of which consider censoring. Compared to the crude CFR, Garske’s method

274

improved estimates by adjusting for the cumulative density of intervals from

275

hospital admission to death/discharge. Survival analysis was a useful tool for

276

comparison as it relied on a very large individual dataset comprising a total of

277

9,651 reported cases. Availability of individual data enabled us to explore

278

mortality risk factors and estimate CFR by age group. Estimates have not been

279

reported previously based on such a large sample size and a competing risk

280

model of survival analysis with 90th quantile truncation. There was no difference

281

in CFR estimates by the two methods, which lends support to our estimates.

282

Our study has some limitations. First, in the individual dataset, the clinical profile

283

of patients was not available. Hence, we could not provide direct estimates of

284

fatality risk stratified by clinical categories using survival analysis. Instead, we

285

divided the estimated CFR among all cases by the proportions of different clinical

286

categories obtained from the aggregated dataset. This is a reasonable approach

287

method because all deaths occurred among critical cases 5.

288

Second, the analyzed individual records were retrieved from publicly available

289

official sources, ensuring accuracy and reliability of information. However, we

290

were only able to collect few individual records in Hubei because they did not

291

release complete individual information. And thus, we were unable to estimate

292

CFR in Hubei using survival analyses. Moreover, assessment of clinical severity in

293

Hubei, especially in the epicenter of the outbreak in Wuhan, is challenging

294

because disease severity may be increased by bottlenecks in local healthcare

295

capacity, as COVID-19 cases surged. In addition, case surveillance and clinical

296

management were biased towards severe cases in Hubei, especially in the early

297

phase of the epidemic. Our estimates of the CFR in Hubei and Wuhan using

298

Garske’s method11 should be viewed cautiously as the sensitivity of surveillance

299

of both deaths and cases remains unclear.

300

Our study only addresses CFR among detected cases. The level of ascertainment

301

of mild cases remains unclear. More estimates that include fatality risk among

302

syndromic patients and asymptomatically infected individuals can only be

303

available through enhanced routine surveillance, such as increased testing of

304

patients with influenza-like-illnesses, and by analysis of future

305

sero-epidemiological studies.

306

Our CFR estimates of 0.89-1.24% among detected COVID-19 patients outside

307

Hubei province are higher than the crude CFRs reported by WHO and China CDC,

308

which is 0.4-0.7%5,14. It is expected that the crude CFR obtained by dividing the

309

cumulative number of reported deaths by the cumulative number of reported

310

cases is an underestimate due to the inevitable delay between symptom onset

311

and death. Our findings reveal that older individuals and male patients

312

experience higher fatality risk, which is consistent with the WHO report 14.

313

Additionally, WHO reported that patients with underlying conditions had much

314

higher fatality rates14. Our study was unable to address the relative risk of fatal

315

outcome among patients with underlying diseases compared to healthy people,

316

because limited information on underlying conditions was available from

317

publicly available data sources.

318

A clinical study conducted in Wuhan showed that 4.3% of hospitalized patients

319

died15. Another study relying on patients from 552 hospitals across 30 provinces,

320

found that 1.4% of patients died 16, in which less study participants (28%) were

321

from Wuhan. The estimates of these clinical studies would be the lower bounds

322

for the CFR since separately 62% and 94% of patients were still in hospitals. The

323

fatality risk from these clinical studies is higher than our CFR estimates, probably

324

due to shortage of health services in Wuhan, e.g., advanced health care facilities

325

for critically ill patients as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

326

Our CFR estimates outside Hubei province indicate that the severity of

327

SARS-CoV-2 is lower than that of other diseases caused by zoonotic

328

coronaviruses, including Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which had

329

an estimated CFR of 34.4% globally17, and severe acute respiratory syndrome

330

(SARS) with an estimated CFR of 10.9% across the world and 7% in mainland

331

China18. In contrast, the CFR of SARS-CoV is in the same order of magnitude as

332

that of pandemic 2009 influenza A(H1N1) virus hospitalizations, which has an

333

estimated CFR of 1.4% among hospitalized patients in Asia19. In the long run,

334

depending on how much of the severity pyramid of SARS-CoV2 is captured in our

335

data, the absolute severity of SARS-CoV2 may prove to be similar, to somewhat

336

more severe, than the 2009 influenza pandemic, albeit with a different age profile.

337

Comparison of clinical data from China and other countries will prove useful to

338

settle this question.

339

Outside Hubei province, close contacts of laboratory-confirmed cases were kept

340

in quarantine for 14 days, and local hospitals tested patients with respiratory

341

symptoms (e.g., fever and cough) and epidemiological links to Hubei province or

342

other cases. This strategy would have enabled detection of many mild cases.

343

However, a small number of mild cases were captured. In our aggregated dataset

344

for Guangdong province for instance, only 8% of reported cases were mild, while

345

the majority (83%) of reported cases had moderate disease severity with

346

presence of pneumonia. And thus, our CFR estimates could approximately

347

represent the fatality risk among laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases with

348

chest x-ray confirmed pneumonia. Even though clinical information for these

349

patients was not available from publicly available sources, we believe that our

350

CFR estimates could be viewed as the fatality risk among hospitalized COVID-19

351

cases. Chest x-ray confirmed pneumonia is a threshold for hospital admissions in

352

in China. This may vary among countries due to different clinical practices and

353

health service capacity.

354

Clinical studies have reported a higher proportion of severe patients among older

355

age group (29% vs. 14%)16. No specialized treatment for COVID-19 patients has

356

been identified, and the mainstay clinical management has been supportive care.

357

For non-critically ill patients, close follow-up is likely to be sufficient to manage

358

the disease. But critically ill patients were more likely to develop ARDS and

359

require ICU admission20. That could explain our findings that severe patients had

360

a higher fatality risk. The high observed CFRs of COVID-19 in older adults is

361

consistent with the age profile of MERS, SARS, pandemic H1N1 2009, and

362

seasonal influenza.19

363

Compared to the Eastern region, cases detected in the less developed Central

364

region had a 2.45-fold higher risk of death, and those in West and Northeast

365

region had a 2.93-fold higher risk. It is important to note that those variations in

366

CFR do not reflect underlying differences in clinical disease severity. CFR will

367

vary regionally depending on the sensitivity of surveillance systems to detect

368

cases at different levels of the severity pyramid and clinical care offered to severe

369

and critical patients. More attention should be paid to less developed settings

370

with limited health services like Iran, which reports a larger ratio of deaths to

371

cases than other countries2.

372

Notably, the definition of suspected cases eligible for laboratory testing used in

373

China shifted from a narrow clinical criteria based on three symptoms early in

374

the outbreak (fever; radiographic findings of pneumonia; normal or reduced

375

white blood cell count, or reduced lymphocyte count at early onset of symptoms),

376

to a broader criteria including any two of three symptoms by January 27. This

377

would bias our sample towards more clinically severe cases before January 27. In

378

addition to improvement in therapeutic capacity, the shift in surveillance

379

definition could partially explain the declining trend of CFR from 8% to around 1%

380

at the end of January, which remained stable afterwards. Accordingly, our CFR

381

estimate for February could provide a true picture of the severity of

382

laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19.

383

In conclusion, our estimates of CFR among laboratory-confirmed cases suggest

384

that COVID-19 is not as severe as SARS and MERS, but similar to that of pandemic

385

2009 H1N1 among hospitalized patients. The fatality risk of COVID-19 cases is

386

higher in male, and increases with age, particularly in adults aged 70 years and

387

above. Our findings can inform the severity assessment and response to the

388

on-going COVID-19 outbreak, and assist preparations for a global epidemic of

389

COVID-19.
