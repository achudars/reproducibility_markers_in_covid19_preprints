Abstract
The evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic can be monitored through the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA
in sewage. Here, we measured the amount of SARS-CoV-2 RNA at the inflow point of the main waste
water treatment plant (WWTP) of Montpellier, France. We collected samples 4 days before the end
of lockdown and up to 45 days post-lockdown. We detected increased amounts of SARS-CoV-2 RNA
at the WWTP, which was not correlated with the number of newly diagnosed patients. Future
epidemiologic investigations may explain such asynchronous finding.

Main text
SARS-CoV-2 is the etiologic agent responsible for the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
pandemic. Wastewater-based epidemiology represents an attractive strategy to surveil the evolution
of virus circulation in populations (Bivins et al., 2020, Carducci et al., 2020), contributing to costeffective virus control without infringing on individual liberties. About half of symptomatic patients
shed SARS-CoV-2 RNA in their stools, with persistent fecal viral shedding reported (Chen et al., 2020,
Wang et al., 2020, Wu et al., 2020, Xiao et al., 2020, Xu et al., 2020). Recently, an asymptomatic child
was reported as negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA based on throat swab specimen, while his stools were
positive (Tang et al., 2020), suggesting that symptomatic and asymptomatic persons are likely to
release SARS-CoV-2 RNA in city sewerages. Indeed, several reports indicate that SARS-CoV-2 RNA was
readily detected in wastewater, and it is proposed that such approach could anticipate the occurrence
of novel COVID-19 outbreaks in low prevalence regions (Ahmed et al., 2020, La Rosa et al., 2020,
Medema et al., 2020, Orive et al., 2020, Randazzo et al., 2020). The end of the stringent lockdown
(that occurred in France on May 11th) is therefore an adequate time to measure the re-emergence of
the virus through the monitoring of wastewater.
Here, we collected effluent composite samples (using a 24-hour automatic sampler) in waste water
upstream of the main waste water treatment plant (WWTP) of Montpellier metropolitan area located
in Lattes, France. The sampling dates were May 7th, 18th, 26th, June 4th, 15th and 25th, to monitor SARSCoV-2 RNA expression levels during lockdown and up to 45 days after its end. At this time, the virus
was still circulating in the area, but the incidence was low (number of newly diagnosed COVID-19
patients per day < 20).
Collected wastewater was processed as follows: on the day of water collection, samples were
maintained at 4°C for transport and immediately cleared by centrifugation at 4500 g for 30 min at 4°C.
The supernatant was passed through a 40 µm cell strainer (Corning) to remove large floating
components. At this stage, the samples were frozen at -20°C for later analyses with samples collected
at other timepoints. Upon thawing, RNAs were concentrated on a Vivaspin 50 kDa MWCO filter
membrane (Sartorius). Starting from 50 ml of water, the sample was concentrated down a hundred
times to an adjusted volume of 500 µl. RNA extraction using the NucleoSpin RNA Virus kit (MachereyNagel) and RT-qPCR was performed on 10 µl of purified RNA using the TaqPath One-Step RT-qPCR, CG
master mix (ThermoFisher Scientific). The N1 and N3 primer/probe sets designed by the center for
disease control (CDC) were used to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA and a standard curve was run in parallel
using a positive control plasmid (Integrated DNA Technologies) coding for the nucleoprotein (N) of
SARS-CoV-2. Using RNA extracted from Vero E6 cells either non-infected or infected with SARS-CoV-2
in vitro, we showed that the N1 and N3 primer/probe sets recognized solely the RNA from infected
cells (Table 1). A recent study used a Dengue virus (DENV) sequence surrogate to determine PCR
efficiency (Medema et al., 2020) but in Montpellier area, this approach would be risky, as
autochthonous DENV infections have been repeatedly reported in the south of France (European
Centre for Disease Prevention and Control). In order to determine the RT-qPCR efficiency intrinsic to
each sample, we used a sensitive primer/probe set previously described (Ro et al., 2017) that target
the VP40-encoding RNA of Ebola virus (Zaire strain). First, we showed that the Ebola standard (Ebo
Std) primer/probe set was not detecting RNA from SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero E6 cells (Table 1). Using
water samples from upstream WWTP of the Montpellier metropolitan area collected on June 15th, we
found that the Ebo Std primer/probe set gave no signal while the primer/probes N1, N3, and RLP27
(targeting the human rlp27 gene) returned positive signals (Table 1).

Ebo Std primer/probe set was purchased (Integrated DNA Technologies) to be used as an internal
normalization standard. Standard curves were run using the N control plasmid (N1 and N3
primer/probe sets) or the Ebo Std RNA (Ebo Std primer/probe set) to estimate copy numbers (Figure
1). Of note, the Ebo Std primer/probe set was less sensitive than N1 and N3, probably because the
Ebo Std synthetic template RNA is relatively fragile and short (91 nucleotides).

Next, we evaluated the relative efficiency of RNA extraction and RT-qPCR reaction for each sample by
adding 107 copies of synthetic Ebo Std RNA before RNA extraction. This step allows quantitative
comparison of samples collected at different dates. Our data show that RNA extraction and RT-qPCR
(RERP) efficiency was marginally affected according to the collection date (Table 2).

by dividing the copy number of Ebo Std RNA measured by RT-qPCR (using the standard curve in Figure

Next, we measured the SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels using N1 and N3 primer/probe sets in wastewater
collected upstream of the main WWTP of the Montpellier metropolitan area on May 7th, 18th, 26th,
June 4th, 15th and 25th (Figure 2A). Of note, the Montpellier wastewater network is partially united and
thus, we checked that rain precipitation was negligible and would not significantly dilute the samples
according to the collection date (Figure 2B).
Our data highlights that the wastewater from the two later dates (June 15th and 25th) contained more
viral RNA than the ones from previous dates (Figure 2A and color-coded in Figure 2C-D). In contrast,
the number of daily COVID-19 patients hospitalized in the Hérault department (> 40% inhabitant living
in the Montpellier metropolitan area) and the newly diagnosed patients (Figure 2E-F) is overall
decreasing since April 1st. From these observations, it seems that there is no direct temporal
correlation between SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in wastewater and the epidemiological features
associated with COVID-19, at least on such a short time window. This intriguing result is reminiscent
of a recent Spanish study, in which the authors could detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater weeks
before the first COVID-19 cases were reported (Randazzo et al., 2020). However, they could not see a
correlation between SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels in wastewater and the number of newly diagnosed
COVID-19 patients. On the same line, Medema & colleagues showed a correlation between the
cumulative cases of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 RNA although the data were not correlated as a
function of time (Medema et al., 2020).
In conclusion, we report effective detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the wastewater of Montpellier area
upstream of the treatment plant and identified a recent increase of the amount of detected viral RNA.
At this stage, we are unable to determine whether this increase is due to an upcoming increase of
COVID-19 cases in the area or to intrinsic SARS-CoV-2 RNA variations associated with uneven virus
shedding (from patient-to-patient and depending on the stage of the disease for a given patient).
Moreover, various other parameters might also impact these results, such as people from distant
clusters moving to second homes and tourist accommodation, the chronic underestimation of
prevalence rates, or local variability in the geographical pattern of virus spread. Both hypotheses are
non-exclusive and future multiparametric investigations are required to better determine whether
the monitoring of wastewater could be a powerful predictive tool to future epidemic outbreaks.

(A) The number of SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies was measured using either the N1 or N3 primer/probe set.
Each dot corresponds to the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater measured from the sum
of the RNA copy number calculated from two RNA extractions and four RT-qPCR reactions performed
in two individual runs. Sterile water wells were included in duplicates for each primer/probe set in
each plate as negative control and always returned “No Ct” (not shown on the graph). Of note, the
