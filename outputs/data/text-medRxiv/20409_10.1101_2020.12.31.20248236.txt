We report a rapid isothermal method for detecting SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for
COVID-19. The procedure uses a novel reverse transcriptase-free (RTF) approach for
converting RNA into DNA, which triggers a rapid amplification using the Exponential
Amplification Reaction (EXPAR). Deploying the RNA-to-DNA conversion and amplification
stages of the RTF-EXPAR assay in a single step results in the detection of a sample of patient
SARS-CoV-2 RNA in under 5 minutes.
In order to reduce the rate of spread of COVID-19, an accurate and efficient virus testing strategy is
imperative. A key part of this strategy is continuous assay development, with the aim of reducing
detection times and increasing sample throughput. The research community and diagnostics industry
has responded rapidly to this unprecedented crisis in developing a range of detection platforms.1-4
The most sensitive assays detect viral RNA, with the current gold standard being reverse transcriptase
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), a two-step assay that takes more than 60 minutes per sample.
First, reverse transcriptase converts viral RNA to complementary DNA (cDNA), a process that can
take up to 30 minutes.5 Then a quantitative PCR (qPCR) amplifies the cDNA, which is detected using
a fluorescent dye, a process that takes up to an hour.6 To reduce assay times, a plethora of new
approaches to SARS-CoV-2 detection have appeared in the literature over the past year. As far as
Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests (NAATs) are concerned, which are more sensitive than current 30minute lateral flow antigen (immunoassay) tests,7 focus has turned towards isothermal DNA
amplification approaches, which increase amplification speeds and hence reduce assay times. The
most common isothermal amplification system is Loop mediated isothermal AMPlification (LAMP).8
LAMP assays have been developed for SARS-CoV-2 but take, on average, 20 minutes for a result,
with further decreases in LAMP assay time proving challenging.4,9,10 Herein, we demonstrate an
alternative isothermal approach based on the Exponential Amplification Reaction (EXPAR),11 a
simpler and faster amplification method than LAMP. By combining EXPAR with a novel reverse
transcriptase-free (RTF) step, this new assay, RTF-EXPAR, can accurately identify viral RNA
derived from COVID-19 patient samples in less than 5 minutes.
The key to the speed of EXPAR is twofold; firstly, the amplification occurs at a single temperature,
thus avoiding lengthy heating and cooling steps, and secondly the amplicon is relatively small
(typically 15-20 bases long), compared to both PCR and LAMP. These two factors result in EXPAR,
once triggered, producing up to 108 strands of DNA product in a matter of minutes.11,12 A singlestranded DNA fragment (the trigger) starts the EXPAR reaction by binding a DNA template. Large
quantities of short double stranded DNA sequences are then generated in an isothermal cycle
involving a DNA polymerase to extend the sequence and a nicking endonuclease to cut it, while
leaving
the template intact (Scheme 1a). As with the RT-PCR COVID-19 assay, duplex formation is

A crucial element to developing a successful EXPAR assay is the identification of optimal nucleotide
sequences in the target genome. Qian et al previously found that the type of trigger sequence used in
EXPAR plays a vital role in determining its efficiency.13,14 Using their approach, we designed a 17mer DNA trigger for EXPAR (Trigger X, Scheme 1a and Table 1) containing a sequence
complementary to one within the conserved gene Orf1ab in the SARS-CoV-2 genome
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947.3?report=fasta). We first analysed the speed and
sensitivity of EXPAR using Trigger X in the presence of Template X´-X´ (Supplementary Figure
1). Rapid rises in SYBR Green fluorescence were observed, with amplification times revealing an
expected dependence on trigger concentration (e.g. time to 10-sigma: 3.17 ± 0.14 minutes at 10 nM,
8.67 ± 1.08 minutes at 10 pM). These results demonstrate that EXPAR is a faster amplification
method than LAMP. Next, we analysed the specificity of the reaction by investigating three other
triggers (Triggers A, B and C), each at a concentration of 10 nM, that were non-complementary to
Template X´-X´ (Supplementary Figure 2). Each of these three triggers produced no signal within
10 minutes under the same conditions, confirming the specificity of the EXPAR reaction, with only
the trigger sequence fully complementary to the template (Trigger X) resulting in rapid amplification.
In the standard RT-PCR COVID-19 assay, reverse transcriptase converts the RNA of SARS-CoV-2
into cDNA prior to amplification (vide supra). The speed of this initial polymerisation reaction is a
significant limitation for this or potentially any other RNA detection method that proceeds via cDNA
amplification, including LAMP or EXPAR. We hypothesised that a faster method could be achieved
by generating a short DNA trigger sequence directly from the RNA genomic strand, without the need
for a lengthy reverse transcriptase step. Murray et al had previously demonstrated that the restriction
enzyme BstNI could act as a nicking enzyme by selectively cleaving DNA within RNA:DNA
heteroduplexes.15 We considered that this enzyme could be used to generate the desired DNA
fragment for triggering the EXPAR reaction. To achieve this, we designed a 30-mer oligonucleotide
(called Binder DNA, Table 1) possessing a 5-base recognition site for BstNI, as well as two partially
overlapping sequence stretches complementary to part of Orf1ab in the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome
and the EXPAR DNA template (Template X´-X´). Site-selective cleavage of Binder DNA using
BstNI would only occur in the presence of the RNA target from SARS-CoV-2, generating a shorter
strand of DNA, Trigger X (Scheme 1b). This shorter strand would now release from the heteroduplex
and bind preferably to the DNA template, as it can still form a fully-complementary 17-mer duplex
with the latter. Binding to the template would trigger EXPAR, with the newly released RNA strand
able to bind more Binder DNA to generate more Trigger X.
Applying this novel EXPAR approach in a two-stage process, we first undertook an enzymatic
digestion at 50 °C for five minutes of Binder DNA (1 µM) in the presence of a sample of patient
SARS-CoV-2 RNA (72.7 copies/µL)16 obtained from PHE, before adding this solution to the EXPAR
reagent mix for the amplification step. This stage, performed in triplicate, gave an amplification time
of 3.17 ± 0.24 minutes, whereas no amplification was observed for the negative sample within 10
minutes (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Figure 3). To increase the speed of the RTF-EXPAR assay further,
we next investigated a “one-pot” approach by introducing BstNI and Binder DNA to the EXPAR
reagents at the same time, before incubating and amplifying simultaneously at 50 °C. These assay
conditions gave an amplification time of only 4.00 ± 0.72 minutes for the positive sample, halving
the total assay time compared to the “two-pot” method (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Figure 4). Once
again, no signal change for the negative sample was observed within 10 minutes. As expected, this
was also the case for control experiments on the positive RNA sample in the absence of either Binder
DNA or Template X´-X´ (see Supplementary Figures 5 and 6 respectively), and a sample of RNA
isolated from the CFPAC-1 human ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line (see Supplementary
Figure 7).
In conclusion, through the use of a new reverse transcriptase-free isothermal amplification method,
RTF-EXPAR, involving a DNA-selective restriction endonuclease, we have demonstrated the

successful detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in a total assay time of less than 5 minutes. This time is
not only much faster than RT-PCR (assay time of at least 60 minutes) but also outperforms LAMP
and 30-minute lateral flow antigen tests in current deployment. RTF-EXPAR would be completely
compatible (i.e. deployment ready) for use on equipment currently used for RT-PCR COVID-19
assays. Furthermore, the simplicity and speed of the assay enables this method to be modified to
detect a range of infectious diseases caused by RNA-based pathogens (e.g. Ebola, RSV).

(b) Reverse Transcriptase-Free EXPAR (RTF-EXPAR)

Scheme 1. (a) Reaction Scheme for EXPAR: Trigger X anneals to Template X´-X´ and is extended by a
DNA polymerase (Bst 2.0 polymerase); the top strand of the newly formed duplex DNA is then cut by a nicking
enzyme (Nt.BstNBI); the released DNA (which is displaced by DNA polymerase in a subsequent extension
reaction) is identical to Trigger X and is therefore able to prime another Template X´-X´. (b) Reaction Scheme
for Reverse Transcriptase-Free EXPAR (RTF-EXPAR): Binder DNA anneals to viral RNA; the DNA strand
of the DNA:RNA heteroduplex is cut by the restriction endonuclease BstNI, which acts as a nicking enzyme
by cutting the DNA strand only, the released DNA strand is Trigger X, which is then amplified by EXPAR.

Author Contributions

Materials: Milli-Q water purified with a Millipore Elix-Gradient A10 system (resistivity > 18
μΩ.cm, TOC ≤ 5ppb, Millipore, France) was used in all the experiments. Nt.BstNBI, BstNI and Bst
2.0 Polymerase were obtained from New England Biolabs (Hitchin, UK) as was the buffer, 10x
Isothermal amplification buffer (200 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM (NH4)2SO4, 500 mM KCl, 20 mM
MgSO4, 1% Tween 20, pH 8.8) which was used in all the experiments. Superscript IV Reverse
Transcriptase was obtained from ThermoFisher (Paisley, UK), DMSO (> = 99%) was obtained from
Fisher Scientific (Loughborough, UK) and dsGreen 100x (an analogue of SYBR Green I), was
obtained from Lumiprobe (Hannover, De). Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA, diluted to 4 mg/mL in
water) and Single-Stranded Binding Protein (SSB, solution of 0.5 mgs in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0,
0.5 M NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM DTT, 50% Glycerol) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Dorset,
UK). All the nucleotide triphosphates and oligonucleotide sequences (desalted) were obtained from
Sigma-Aldrich (Dorset, UK).
PHE samples: All clinical specimens were handled in a Containment Level 2 laboratory. To prepare
each sample, Viral Transfer Medium (VTM, 300 µL, Medical Wire ViroCult) from a nose and throat
swab was added to Buffer AL (Qiagen) in a 1:1 ratio and heated to 60 °C for 30 minutes in a calibrated
heat block. Samples were then extracted on the MagNAPure96 (Roche) automated extraction system
and then run on the Abbott M2000 RT-qPCR Test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA Detection. For EXPAR
assay development, positive and negative samples from the SARS-CoV-2 RNA assays were
separately combined in MagNA Pure elution buffer (giving 29,080 RNA copies/µL for the combined
positive sample). Upon receipt from PHE, each sample was diluted 400-fold with water, aliquoted
into 50 µL vials and stored at -80 °C. Prior to use, each sample was submerged in ice and allowed to
slowly melt; once melted the sample was used immediately before being cooled again for storage at
-80 °C.
Data Analysis and classification: To analyse the EXPAR real-time fluorescence amplification
curves and data, a program in C# was developed. The program analyses the first 10 data points and
calculates the mean value and standard deviation as a base line. Following generation of these two
values, each subsequent data point is analysed to determine if its value minus the average value is
greater than 10 standard deviations away from the mean. The cycle which meets this criterion is
converted into a time and used as the minimum amplification time. Under the concentrations and
conditions used in the RTF-EXPAR assay protocol, should the amplification time be less than 10
minutes, the output indicates the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (true positive). For amplification
times greater than 10 minutes, the output indicates a complete test and the absence of SARS-CoV-2
RNA (false positive).
