Abstract
Objectives: Elderly people had suffered disproportional burden of COVID-19. We hypothesized
that males and females in different age groups might have different epidemic trajectories.
Methods: Using publicly available data from South Korea, daily new COVID-19 cases were
fitted with generalized additive models, assuming Poisson and negative binomial distributions.
Epidemic dynamics by age and gender groups were explored with interactions between
smoothed time terms and age and gender.
Results: A negative binomial distribution fitted the daily case counts best. Interaction between
the dynamic patterns of daily new cases and age groups was statistically significant (p<0.001),
but not with gender group. People aged 20-39 years led the epidemic processes in the society
with two peaks: one major peak around March 1 and a smaller peak around April 7, 2020. The
epidemic process among people aged 60 or above was trailing behind that of younger people
with smaller magnitude. After March 15, there was a consistent decline of daily new cases
among elderly people, despite large fluctuations of case counts among young adults.
Conclusions: Although young people drove the COVID-19 epidemic in the whole society with
multiple rebounds, elderly people could still be protected from virus infection after the peak of
epidemic.

Introduction

The novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome associated beta-coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) of
unknown origin, appeared in Wuhan, China in late December 2019 and has swept the world over
the past few months (Anderson et al. 2020; Li et al. 2020a; Zhu et al. 2020), causing over
491,500 deaths worldwide (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html, accessed on June 26, 2020)
and significantly disrupting both societal activities and person life(Center 2020). Although
several early studies described the dynamics of the epidemic process in details (Li et al. 2020a;
Wu and McGoogan 2020), many uncertainties remained. For example, diagnosis criteria varied
significantly across countries. During the early epidemic in Wuhan, China, patients were
required to have serious pneumonia symptoms plus lab confirmed virus detection (Huang et al.
2020; Zhu et al. 2020), thus missing most mildly symptomatic and all asymptomatic patients. As
suggested in a modeling study, probably 86% of COVID-19 cases might be undocumented in
Wuhan (Li et al. 2020b). Many epidemic measures such as basic reproduction number based on
early epidemic in Wuhan were questioned by later studies due to possible underestimating the
true parameters (Nishiura et al. 2020; Zhao et al. 2020a; Zhao et al. 2020b). On the other hand,
some countries such as South Korea and Singapore classified patients only based on lab tests,
yielding a better picture of the epidemic.
To fully understand the epidemic process of COVID-19, accurate and complete epidemic data
are indispensable. Data from South Korea have been generally considered of highest quality,
mainly due to two notable strategies adopted by the South Korea government from the beginning
of the epidemic: extensive contact tracing and massive testing to identify possible cases in
addition to case isolation (Shim et al. 2020). South Korea identified the first COVID-19 case on
Jan 20, 2020, and the outbreak started its exponential growth after Feb 19, 2020. In an outbreak

occurred in a call center, 1,143 people were tested, 97 were positive and confirmed (positive rate
8.5%) (Park et al. 2020). After tracing all contacts of those 97 cases, about 16% were tested
positive (secondary attack rate). In addition, South Korea also installed roadside testing stations
to test any person who had concerns about his/her infectious status, in addition to those who had
contacted known patients. Such extensive controlling measures not only halted the epidemic
successfully but also produced a more complete picture of the COVID-19 epidemic.
A striking phenomenon in COVID-19 was that people aged 65 or older suffered the heaviest
burden of the disease (Richardson et al. 2020; Wu and McGoogan 2020) and the proportion of
cases was higher in men than that of women. According to a recent CDC report, about 80% of
deaths occurred among elderly people, and those aged 80 or above had almost 15% chance of
dying if infected (CDC 2020; Garg et al. 2020). In our previous analysis based on Florida
COVID-19 data, we found that people aged 65 or older accounted for 54% of hospitalizations
and 82% of deaths. The mortality rate was 14% among elderly people who were infected with
coronavirus (Yu 2020a).
Furthermore, since May 1, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has been waning down across the
world (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html), pressing many countries to consider re-opening the
business. Many public health experts warned a possible rebound of new cases if current
interventions were relaxed (Chowell and Mizumoto 2020; Ferguson et al. 2020; Kissler et al.
2020). A recent model predicted that COVID-19 epidemic might last more than a year and
multiple waves of outbreaks were possible (Kissler et al. 2020). It is likely elderly people may
still suffer the heaviest disease burden during the return of outbreak (Hay et al. 2020).
However, it was unknown whether and how the epidemic processes were different between
young and old people. In this study, we aim to statistically learn the dynamics of the COVID-19

pandemic based on data from South Korea. In addition to identifying the best fit of the epidemic
process, we explore gender- and age group- specific trajectories of COVID-19 to facilitate our
understanding of the disease and its impact on different populations, and inform the potential and
severity of COVID-19 rebound.

Materials and Methods

The daily counts of confirmed new COVID-19 cases and deaths were obtained from the open
source (https://github.com/jihoo-kim/Data-Science-for-COVID-19, accessed on May 2, 2020),
which were systematically gathered from Korea Center for Disease Control (KCDC) daily
reports. All cases were verified against KCDC reports. The line list file included patientâ€™s age,
gender and date of virus infection confirmation. However, the line list file excluded almost all
cases occurred in the city of Daegu (more than 6,000 cases), and thus cases from Daegu were
excluded from our study. We further excluded cases with missing confirmation date (n=3). Age
was grouped (in years) as 0-19, 20-39, 40-59, and 60 or above. Those with missing gender
information (n=78) or missing age information (n=86) were retained in the analysis for overall
trajectories (total sample size n=3349), but were excluded in the gender or age specific analysis.
Since our purpose in this study was not to predict new cases in the future but to model the
epidemic process, we adopted a semi-parametric Generalized Additive Model (GAM) to obtain
fitted daily case counts and also account for non-linear patterns of epidemic process (Wood
2017). The time was modeled as a continuous variable with smoothing terms (thin plate
regression splines with 8 knots). Interactions between smooth terms and gender (or age group)
were modeled as separate smoothing function for each group. Specifically, for interaction models:

where Yij represents the observed case counts of day i and group j that follows a certain
distribution. In this study, we focused on Negative Binomial (NB) or Poisson distributions due to
their robustness. We use variable timei to represent day starting from 1, Ij( ) is an indicator
variable (0/1) denoting if daily counts of new cases is for group j (1) or not (0), bk( ) represents a
basis function for the kth term to smooth temporal trend, and Î²j,k are regression coefficients for
smooth term k and group j (representing group-specific effects). Parameters were estimated via
the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) approach. The Generalized Cross Validation
criterion with Mallowsâ€™ Cp (GCV.Cp) and Maximum Likelihood (ML) methods were also
explored. Therefore, the above GAM framework allows us to compare different trajectories
through examining the interactions between smoothed time term and age/gender groups with a
focus on comparing the overall trajectories rather than point-wise comparisons. Statistics R2 and
percent of deviance explained by the models were used to identify the best fit model. R package
mgcv was used to fit the GAM model (Wood 2017). The data and programs are available online
at https://github.com/Jiasong-Duan/COVID-19-epidemic-trajectories.
Results:
From Feb. 19 to Apr. 30, 2020, there were 3,349 COVID-19 cases (1,439 males, 43%) identified
outside the Daegu city. Those with age 0-19 accounted for 6% (n=202) of total cases, and age
20-39 for 37% (n=1,227), age 40-59 for 31% (n=1,034), while those with age 60 or above
accounted for 24% (n=800) of total cases. As shown in Figure 1, the epidemic outside the Daegu

city peaked around Mar. 1, 2020 and declined afterwards except for a second small peak around
March 28, 2020.
The fitted curves to the observed daily new cases were overlaid on the observed counts in Figure
1. Predictions from both NB and Poisson models were indistinguishable. However, the
confidence intervals from NB model were much wider than that of Poisson model. As shown in
the model comparison table (Table 1), there was no difference in the adjusted R2 and percent
deviance explained by the same model between different estimating methods. The adjusted R2
was 0.839 with 89.2% deviance explained by the Poisson model, while the adjusted R2 from NB
model was 0.838 with 90.3% deviance explained by the model (Table 1). Although both models
resulted in similar model fitting parameters, the NB model also estimated a dispersion factor of
18.2, implying Poisson distribution might not be a suitable choice to fit the data. In addition, the
wider confidence intervals from the NB model covered a larger range of observed values. Thus,
to be conservative, the model based on NB distribution was selected and implemented in the
subsequent analyses. The confidence intervals from the fitted models were omitted in the
subsequent plots to emphasize different overall patterns in the epidemic process.
Figure 2a-b presented the fitted epidemic processes by gender and age groups. The epidemic
curve for males fell significantly below that of females (p = 0.0006). Although the epidemic
curve of males peaked about one day earlier than that of females as shown in Figure 2a, the
shapes of the curve were not significantly different between males and females (p for interaction
=0.35). On the other hand, age-specific epidemic curves depicted significantly different patterns
across age groups (p for interaction<0.001) (Figure 2b). The epidemic curve in the youngest
group (aged 0-19) showed lowest daily case counts and largely stable over the whole period,
while there were two peaks in the epidemic process among people aged 20-39 years. In fact, the

epidemic among people aged 20-39 led the whole epidemic process in the total population such
that not only did young adults have more daily new cases than that of other age groups, but also
the epidemic processes among people aged 40-59 and 60+ years were trailing one to three days
behind that of aged 20-39.
To further explore age and gender effects on the epidemic process, Figure 3a-b presented the
fitted epidemic curves by age groups for males and females separately. Among males, people
aged 20-39 had highest predicted daily counts and experienced two peaks over time, while those
aged 60 or older had much lower daily case counts and decreased consistently over time despite
the large changes of epidemic in young adults. Those aged 40-59 also experienced two peaks in
the epidemic but were at a smaller scale than young adults.
The patterns of epidemic processes by age groups among females were different from that of
males. Those females aged 40-59 and aged 20-39 had similar epidemic processes during the first
peak of epidemic. The daily case counts among females aged 20-39 also increased after April 1,
2020. Females aged 60 or above had smaller magnitude of epidemic but overall, similar to that of
females aged 40-59.
Discussion
In this study, we demonstrated different trajectories of COVID-19 epidemic between gender and
age groups based on South Korea data. First, based on case reporting date and assuming similar
incubation periods and reporting delays across all groups and over the whole study period, young
people aged 20-39 years led the epidemic processes in the whole society and also had
experienced two peaks about one-month apart, one major peak around March 1 and a smaller
peak around April 7, 2020; Second, school age people (aged 0-19) had much smaller magnitude

of epidemic overall; and finally, the epidemic process among people aged 60 or above was
trailing behind that of younger people, and the magnitude of epidemic was smaller than that of
people aged 20-39 or 40-59. After March 15, there was a steady decline of daily new cases
among people aged 60 or above, despite large fluctuations of case counts among young adults.
Our findings were consistent with other reports in which younger people accounted for most
confirmed COVID-19 cases (Guan et al. 2020; Wu and McGoogan 2020; Zhang et al. 2020). Our
empirical evidence from high quality data supported that COVID-19 epidemic was driven by the
infection among young adults. In addition, school age children had the least burden of disease,
possibly due to early school closure and vacation breaks during that period. This pattern was
different from that of typical respiratory infection diseases such as seasonal flu in which most
cases were school age children.
Worldwide, people aged 60 or above endured a disproportional burden of COVID-19 disease
(Wu and McGoogan 2020). They had a higher risk of hospitalizations, and about 80% deaths
occurred in this age group(Garg et al. 2020). However, it was unclear whether elderly people
were more likely to get infected, whether virus transmissibility was higher among elderly, or
whether elderly people were merely more likely to have severe diseases than younger people
(Hay et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2020). Elderly people generally have weaker immune system than
younger people. Meanwhile, they have been exposed to many viruses over lifetime that may
shield them from getting infected by a new virus, but there was no evidence for any prior
immunity to the SARS-CoV2. Nonetheless, our findings provided some hope for mitigating the
impact of epidemic on this vulnerable population. As demonstrated in Figure 2b and 3a-b, fitted
daily case counts among those aged 60 or older declined consistently after March 15, 2020,
despite a second peak occurred in early April among people aged 20-39. Although we did not

have detail information about health conditions and behavioral changes among South Korea
elderly people during the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe by promptly isolating cases,
extensive contact tracing and quarantine at risk people early and efficiently, together with social
distancing, avoiding contacting with young cases and proper personal protection (Anderson et al.
2020; Shim et al. 2020), elderly people could be effectively protected from virus infection
despite a second rebound in young adults. South Korea had set an excellent model for other
country to consider. For example, there were only about ten thousand cases and 282 deaths so far
during the COVID-19 epidemic in South Korea (http://www.cdc.go.kr/cdc_eng/, accessed on
June 25,2020).
In addition, although overall gender difference in the COVID-19 epidemic was moderate, age
and gender specific analyses suggested that females (and to a less extent, males) aged 40-59 had
similar experience of epidemic to that of people aged 20-39. This might be because this age
group often had close and frequent contacts with younger people in work or within households.
Though the risks of hospitalizations and deaths were low among this population, they were
higher than that of regular respiratory infectious diseases such as seasonal flu. Thus, the disease
burden among this middle age group should not be neglected.
There were some limitations in this study. First, our study excluded cases from the city of Daegu
(over 6000 cases) because detail information about cases from that city was not released to the
public. Although it was unlikely to bias our results, information from such a large outbreak could
provide some additional insights on how the epidemic unfolded among people of different age
and gender. However, during the early stage of epidemic, little gender and age stratified data
were publicly available, and most individual level data from other regions were incomplete as
well.

Second, we employed statistical methods to examine the trajectories of epidemic. There were
two perspectives to model the epidemic process (Hethcote 2000; Unkel et al. 2012). One
common approach was to model the process based on the mechanisms of the epidemic. For
example, the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model and its variants had been
used to assess the dynamic of epidemic, obtain epidemic parameters, and evaluate the impact of
various control measures on the epidemic (Kucharski et al. 2020; Peak et al. 2017; Prem et al.
2020; Yu 2020b). Agent-based models were also used to simulate the epidemic process and
assess the effects of various interventions (Ferguson et al. 2020; Wu et al. 2020). The other
perspective was based on traditional statistical models. Non-linear models such as generalized
logistic growth model (Chowell 2017) were used to model the growth of the epidemic and
estimate the growth rate of cases over time. In addition, some researchers directly modeled the
epidemic curve with regression techniques, assuming daily counts follow some distributions such
as Poisson or negative binomial distributions. For example, models based on time series of count
data were adopted to predict the COVID-19 deaths in the US, such as those models from
Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) (IHME 2020) and University of Texas-Austin
(Woody et al. 2020). Our previous research also used vector autoregressive models to examine
the risk interactions across age groups after the peak of COVID-19 Epidemic (Yu 2020c). While
there were many uncertainties among different gender and age groups about contact patterns,
virus transmissibility and behavioral changes during the epidemic, since the epidemic data from
South Korea were more likely to be complete, it is possible to directly model the daily counts
with regression models assuming a common distribution for count data. We believed that out
models avoided many unfounded assumptions in the more complicated epidemic process models.

Third, we only have case reporting or lab confirmation dates in this study which were likely 3-5
days away from the actual virus infection date. The average incubation date for COVID-19 was
about 5 days (Lauer et al. 2020) and the report delay in South Korea was unknown but likely
very short due to extensive testing. Thus, we make some untestable assumptions in comparing
epidemic trajectories between age and gender groups. The incubation period and reporting delay
were assumed to be the same across all groups and over the whole study period. This should be
pertinent in South Korea as they started mass testing and contact tracing from the beginning of
the epidemic (Shim et al. 2020) but may not be appropriate for the regions that testing is severely
limited and delayed.
Finally, we only analyzed data from South Korea. The epidemic processes of COVID-19 in
different countries were likely different due to different population structure and different
interventions to mitigate the epidemic (Anderson et al. 2020; Chowell and Mizumoto 2020; Hay
et al. 2020; Lipsitch et al. 2020). Meanwhile, we expect our findings provided a general picture
of the epidemic trajectories of COVID-19 and can serve as a reference to other regions. In
addition, as witnessed in the COVID-19 epidemic, politics and ideology often overtook science
and public health, so that effective interventions were sometimes implemented too late and
incomplete, leaving the public at lost and public health practitioners in conundrum.
The main strength of our study was our straightforward analyses to explore different epidemic
processes based on high quality data. Insights often emerge through such modeling exercise. We
stratified the models by age and gender groups and discovered their different trajectories in the
epidemic. Recent studies had predicted a long-lasting epidemic for COVID-19 and possible
multiple waves of outbreaks after societal re-opening(Kissler et al. 2020). Our findings were

unique in providing empirical evidence for designing effective public health strategies to
mitigate the impact of recurrent COVID-19 epidemics and protect vulnerable populations.
Conclusions
In summary, in South Korea, and likely in other countries, COVID-19 epidemic processes had
distinctive dynamic patterns among age and gender groups. Epidemic among young adults led
the epidemic process in the whole population, and a second peak occurred in people aged 20-39
years. More importantly, during the post-peak period of the COVID-19 epidemic and in the
process of gradually returning the society and economy to normalcy, elderly people could be
protected effectively though case isolation, contact tracing, mass testing, and proper personal
protections, as exemplified in South Korea.
