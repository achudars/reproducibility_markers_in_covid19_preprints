Abstract
Background: COVID-19 diagnosis is a critical problem, mainly due to the lack or delay in the test
results. We aimed to obtain a model to predict SARS-CoV-2 infection in suspected patients reported to
the Brazilian surveillance system.
Methods: We analyzed suspected patients reported to the National Surveillance System that
corresponded to the following case definition: patients with respiratory symptoms and fever, who
traveled to regions with local or community transmission or who had close contact with a suspected or
confirmed case. Based on variables routinely collected, we obtained a multiple model using logistic
regression. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and accuracy indicators
were used for validation.
Results: We described 1468 COVID-19 cases (confirmed by RT-PCR) and 4271 patients with other
illnesses. With a data subset, including 80% of patients from Sao Paulo (SP) and Rio Janeiro (RJ), we
obtained a function which reached an AUC of 95.54% (95% CI: 94.41% - 96.67%) for the diagnosis of
COVID-19 and accuracy of 90.1% (sensitivity 87.62% and specificity 92.02%). In a validation dataset
including the other 20% of patients from SP and RJ, this model exhibited an AUC of 95.01% (92.51%
– 97.5%) and accuracy of 89.47% (sensitivity 87.32% and specificity 91.36%).
Conclusion: We obtained a model suitable for the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 based on routinely
collected surveillance data. Applications of this tool include early identification for specific treatment
and isolation, rational use of laboratory tests, and input for modeling epidemiological trends.
Keywords: COVID-19; surveillance; multiple regression model; clinical diagnosis; accuracy.

INTRODUCTION
The pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus, Sars-Cov-2, challenges the capabilities of health
care services, especially in low- and middle-income countries [1]. A major issue is to meet the
diagnostic requirements of the suspected cases reported to the surveillance system [2]. The proportion
of suspected cases being tested in each country is not systematically presented in most of the
epidemiological reports [3–5]. However, with the increasing number of new suspected cases of the
disease (COVID-19) worldwide, the diagnosis has become a growing problem, mainly due to the lack
or delay in the test results [6,7].
Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are unspecific and include respiratory symptoms, fever,
cough, dyspnea, and viral pneumonia [8–10]. Polymerase chain reaction by real-time reverse
transcriptase (RT-PCR) is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
However, its limited availability and the strict laboratory requirements delay diagnosis, which
represents an unprecedented challenge to control transmission and provide timely health care [11,12].
The incorporation of predictive diagnostic models based on surveillance data could help
identify patients who could need specific treatment and early isolation. Consequently, we aimed to
describe the profile of COVID-19 patients and to obtain a multiple model to predict the diagnosis among
suspected cases reported in Brazil, based on data routinely collected by the surveillance system.

METHODS
Study design and population
This observational study corresponded to a developing and evaluation of diagnostic
technologies, nested in surveillance data obtained by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. We studied the
reported cases, which corresponded to the following case definition: patients with respiratory symptoms
and fever, who had traveled to regions with community or local transmission or who had close contact
with a suspected or confirmed case. We did not establish restrictions based on age or underlying
conditions for this study. Records with inconsistent or illogical data were excluded.

Procedures
We included the patients reported between 11/01/2020 and 25/03/2020. All data were collected
from the national surveillance information form, created on RedCap® platform, which included
demographic, temporal, and easy to obtain clinical information such as symptoms, signs, comorbidities,
travel history, and contact information. Another variable considered was the time since notification of
the first case that was subsequently confirmed in the corresponding Federal Unit (FU). In the FU without
notification and for its first confirmed case, this variable was zero.
During the period of data collection analyzed, the ministry's recommendation was to test all
suspected cases, according to the definition presented above [13]. SARS-CoV-2 infection was
considered confirmed only by Real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction RT-PCR
testing, following the WHO and CDC protocol result for pharyngeal swab specimens [12]. Because the
study population refers to symptomatic cases, in this paper we used the terms SARS-CoV-2 infection
and COVID-19 interchangeably.
The reference definition of COVID-19 was a reported case with a RNA test positive. Because
the target population was the suspected cases identified through the surveillance system, the COVID-

19 group was compared with the reported cases with RNA test negative (henceforth named other illness
[OI] group).

Data analysis
Demographic and clinical information was entered in an electronic database and then analyzed
using Excel and STATA (version 15.0, Stata Corp LP, College Station, TX, USA). Data analysis
included a description of the manifestations of the disease, according to etiology (COVID-19 vs. OI).
During the univariable analysis, we sought the most functional form of the available variables. This
included the evaluation of composite variables for categorical predictors and the evaluation of the linear
relationship between quantitative variables and the frequency of the outcome.
Age showed a biological gradient with COVID-19; therefore, a simple imputation was made
for cases with missing values of this variable, considering the frequency of the diagnosis. Thus, the
value of 37.38 years was calculated to impute unregistered age (in 1.4% of patients with etiological
diagnosis). This value corresponded to the expected age ( ), considering the COVID-19 odds in the
missing group (
) and the coefficient (
) of a simple logistic regression of this outcome on
age in the other patients. For this imputation, we took as reference values the odds (
) and mean
age ( ) of the decile with the odds closest to that of the missing-age group (sixth decile, aged between
34.3 and 38.1, mean: 36.28 years old). Explicitly,

The information from São Paulo (SP) and Rio de Janeiro (RJ) was used to obtain and validate
the predictive model. This choice was because these were the FUs with the largest number of confirmed
cases and the earliest establishment of the surveillance system. Thus, we used a subset of 80% of
randomly selected patients from SP and RJ (modeling dataset) to specify the multiple model. We
selected the covariates by a non-automatic stepwise procedure using logistic regression. Age and days
after notification of the first confirmed case (DNFCC) were used to create interaction terms with each
of the other independent predictors. During modeling, a p-value of 0.15 was considered as a criterium
to enter the variable and 0.20 to exclude it. After evaluating all the variables, exclusions were made
until obtaining a model including only covariates with p <0.10. To obtain a final predictive function we
integrated the multiple model and variables that perfectly predicted the outcome.
The predicted values were used to estimate the area under the ROC curve (AUC). We
interpreted the AUC as an indicator of goodness of fit such that values between 0.9 and 0.99 are
excellent, 0.8 – 0.89 good, 0.7 – 0.79 acceptable, and 0.51 – 0.69 are poor [14]. We also plotted the
observed COVID-19 proportion by decile of predictions to illustrate the calibration of the model. Next,
the model was applied to the 20% of patients from SP and RJ who were not included in the modeling
dataset (validation dataset). We chose that sample distribution (80% and 20%) looking to have more
than 100 events in the validation dataset [15]. Moreover, we applied the model to patients from FUs
other than SP/RJ to evaluate the applicability in a very different scenario. We also calculated the overall
accuracy to classify events of a predicted probability of ≥0.5 [16].
We presented some cut-off points of the predicted value based on optimized accuracy indicators
(in SP/RJ patients). These cut-offs included: the preset predicted value of 0.5; the highest value with a
sensitivity >95%; the lowest with specificity >95%; the value with the highest overall accuracy; and the
value with the best balance between sensitivity and specificity (based on the product thereof). Accuracy
indicators of these selected cutoffs were described for both the SP/RJ patients (modeling + validation
dataset) and those from the other FUs.
Finally, by applying the sum of the predicted values and by using the chosen cut-off points, we
calculated the probable number of COVID-19 cases in the total reported patients and among those who
were reported as being hospitalized.

RESULTS
Until March 25, 2020, the surveillance system had received 67,344 records of suspected cases,
including 5674 with registered hospitalization. Of the total, 165 records were excluded because of
inconsistent data. Overall, 5739 were tested by RT-PCR, of which 1468 were positive and 4271
negative.

COVID-19 proportion

COVID-19 cases were older and more frequently men compared with OI patients (Table 1).
COVID-19 patients were reported in median 16 days after the first confirmed case, which was
significantly later than OI patients were (median of seven days). Both age and time from the first
confirmed case exhibited a gradient for the COVID-19 frequency (Figures 1 and 2).

Most of the clinical manifestations were more frequent in OI patients than COVID-19 in the
univariable analysis. Only the myalgia or arthralgia variable was significantly more frequent in COVID19 than OI (30.7% vs. 23%, p<0.001). No COVID-19 infections were observed among patients with
liver disease or among those that claimed not to have been in contact with a suspected case. On the
other hand, COVID-19 patients less frequently referred to making a trip outside Brazil in the last 14
days (Table 1).

Multiple model
The states of SP and RJ jointly had 683 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 864 with OI, of which
541 and 702 were selected to the modeling dataset, respectively. During the modeling, patients with
liver disease (n = 4) and those who reported not having had contact with a suspected case (n = 69) were
not considered, as these categories perfectly predicted absence of COVID-19 and were significantly
more frequent in the OI group (Table 1).
We obtained a model integrating 15 covariates, including age, days from notification of the first
confirmed case (DNFCC) in the corresponding FU, eight variables about clinical manifestations, two
on comorbidities, trip history, and two interaction terms (Table 2). The AUC of this multiple model was
estimated at 95.36% (95% CI: 94.2 – 96.52%) with an accuracy of 89.5%.

To obtain the final function, patients with a history of liver disease and those who denied having
had any contact with a suspected case were considered with a predicted value equal to zero; otherwise,
the predicted value was calculated by applying the model described in table 2. With this predictive
function, the area was 95.54% (95% CI: 94.41% – 96.67%) for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in the
modeling dataset and 95.01% (92.51% – 97.5%) in the validation dataset (Figure 3). Accuracy in these
datasets was 90.1% (sensitivity 87.62% and specificity 92.02%) and 89.47% (sensitivity 87.32% and
specificity 91.36%), respectively. Furthermore, the calibration plots suggested reliable predictive
performance in the validation group, similar to displayed in the modeling dataset (Figure 4).
When this function was applied in patients from the other FUs, which included 785 cases of
COVID-19 compared with 3407 with other diseases, the ROC area was 73.16% (95% CI: 71.35 –
74.96%), and the accuracy was 73.43% (sensitivity 46.37% and specificity 79.66%). In table 3, we
described the diagnostic accuracy indicators of selected predicted-value cutoffs in both the SP/RJ and
the other FU groups. Considering the sum of predicted values as well as the different cutoffs, the number
of COVID-19 cases among reported patients (adding together confirmed and predicted by our model)
would be between 22826 and 25190 in SP/RJ, and between 22704 and 28837 in other FUs (Table 4).
Of them, between 2050 and 2196 were hospitalized in SP or RJ, and between 1657 and 2196 in the
other FUs. All the calculations suggested that more than 95% of COVID-19 cases have not been
confirmed.

DISCUSSION
The growing number of cases suspected of COVID-19 is alarming [3]. Moreover, we observed that
only a small proportion of the cases have a laboratory study. Therefore, most cases are being left with
an uncertain diagnosis, which limits establishing specific measures and estimating the burden of the
disease. In this study, we identified a set of variables that may help differentiate COVID-19 cases from
other diseases. The model obtained exhibited an excellent AUC in the SP/RJ dataset comparable to
more complex tools, including imaging and laboratory tests [11,17–19]. This is impressive, considering
that it is based solely on variables collected by the surveillance system.
An essential caveat in these models is that the predictors should not be interpreted individually.
However, some associations are consistent with what is known about this coronavirus. For example,
age was directly associated with the diagnosis, which could be explained by the increased pathogenicity
in older people. Therefore, an overrepresentation of the elderly is expected among the confirmed
patients.

Another interesting finding is the relationship between the time since the notification of the first
confirmed case and the probability of COVID-19. This association indicates the importance of
contextualizing according to the timing of the epidemic. Furthermore, this demonstrates that these
models should be continuously updated and adapted to the epidemiological situation.
Most of the clinical manifestations included in the model were negatively associated with the
SARS-CoV-2 infection. It does not mean that they cannot be presented by patients with COVID-19,
but that they were more frequent in other diseases. This finding highlights why the circulation of other
infectious agents could be a determinant of the predictors' discriminatory capacity, as has already been
suggested for other conditions [20].
Moreover, it is expected that variables determining the notification (e.g., respiratory symptoms and
international travel) and, therefore, inclusion in the study, tend to be negatively associated with the
outcome due to collider-like phenomena [21]. For this reason, both causal inference interpretation, and
extrapolation to the general population of the associations would be biased. Consequently, our model
must be considered only for diagnostic prediction in the specific group of reported suspected patients.
The claim not to have had contact with an exposed case perfectly predicted the absence of COVID19. This finding should be interpreted with caution because it is very likely that as the epidemic
progresses, this variable could lose discrimination capacity once the prevalence of infectious hosts,
including those undetectable, increases in the community.
Regarding external application, we observed that the model had a considerably lower AUC in FUs
other than SP and RJ. This difference could occur due to the epidemiological context variability. For
example, regional differences in the prevalence of respiratory pathogens other than SARS-CoV-2 can
reduce the specificity of the clinical predictors. Moreover, the chronology of the COVID-19 epidemic
itself (which started later in most of UFs other than in SP and RJ [22]) could affect its recognition as a
public health priority and, therefore, the implementation and acceptability of its surveillance [23]. These
factors could introduce heterogeneity of both the clinical profile of reported cases and the data recording
quality, compromising the generalizability of the model performance. Despite this, the AUC in these
other FUs can be considered acceptable, and although lower, the model proposed could also help guide
the preliminary diagnosis in scenarios different than those obtained.
We take some steps to avoid biases frequently identified in models for diagnosis of COVID-19
[24]. For example, we did not exclude patients based on manifestations or evidence of other infections.
In this way, our model could be applied to all reported to the surveillance systems during the emergency
of COVID-19. In addition, the reference standard test was the same for all patients (RT-PCR), and no
predictor was part of the outcome definition. Moreover, quantitative predictors were modeled without
dichotomized them, allowing us to consider the continuous gradients of association with the outcome.
Applications of the proposed model include early case identification for specific treatment and
isolation, as well as the rational use of laboratory tests. Furthermore, this model may predict the number
of both total cases and hospitalizations attributed to this infection based on the surveillance data. This
application is relevant because one of the challenges that this pandemic represents is the organization
of healthcare resources. In this way, our results may help to model and forecast the availability of funds
for patient care.

Conclusions
This study obtained and validated a model function suitable for the clinical diagnosis of
COVID-19 during the early stage of the Brazilian epidemic. This tool was entirely based on data
routinely collected. Therefore, it may help early identification and treatment of patients, establish
preventive measures, and improve the accuracy of epidemiological surveillance of this disease.
