Abstract
Background
To examine whether outdoor exposures may contribute to the COVID-19 epidemic, we
hypothesized that slower outdoor windspeed is associated with increased risk of transmission
when individuals socialize outside.
Methods
Daily COVID-19 incidence reported between 3/16/2020-12/31/2020 was the outcome. Average
windspeed and maximal daily temperature were derived from the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration. Negative binomial regression was used to model incidence,
adjusting for susceptible population size.
Results
Cases were very high in the initial wave but diminished quickly once lockdown procedures were
enacted. Unadjusted and multivariable-adjusted analyses revealed that warmer days with
windspeed <5.5 MPH had increased COVID-19 incidence (aIRR=1.50, 95% C.I.=[1.25-1.81],
P<0.001) as compared to days with average windspeed ≥5.5 MPH.
Conclusion
This study suggests that outdoor transmission of COVID-19 may occur by noting that the risk of
transmission of COVID-19 in the summer was highest on days when wind was reduced.

Background
The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which causes a potentially deadly disease called COVID19 began spreading in China (1), and Italy (2) before arriving in the U.S. COVID-19 first hit in
the U.S. in regions, such as NY and California, where global travelers often arrive into the U.S.
(3). [COUNTY] experienced its first wave of infections early in March, when the pandemic had
just arrived, causing a high degree of transmission and large numbers of COVID-related deaths.
COVID-19 transmits via aerosolized viral particles that begin shedding before symptoms are
evident (4), making it difficult to trace patterns or locations where exposures are occurring. As a
result, approximately half of those diagnosed with COVID-19 report not knowing where they
may have become infected (5). The most likely explanation for this lack of known exposures is
that COVID-19 transmits in spaces that are thought to be safe. A handful of studies have made
some headway in identifying such situations. For example, one study found that COVID-19
could transmit through the air over relatively long distances (6) and another highlighted the
impact of air conditioning vents (7). A third study found that a cluster of 17 cases could be traced
to indirect transmission in shared spaces at a shopping mall in Wenzhou, China (8). Still other
studies have revealed that individuals in a constricted space could spread COVID-19 via inhaled
transmission over potentially large distances by following air flow within a restaurant (7) and
within the Diamond Princess cruise ship (6).
A recent review concluded that transmission within constricted indoor spaces is critically
important, but outdoor exposures may be possible yet little is known about their dynamics or
specific pathways (9). There are reports of sporadic outbreaks in outdoor environments,
including at a construction site in Singapore (10, 11), jogging (10), or during conversation (12).

Because of much lower risk outdoors, close outdoor contacts are often discussed as though they
are risk-free and exposure-mitigating strategies have focused on promoting the use of exterior
spaces when conducting social activities in efforts to mitigate risk of exposure. If exposure
occurs outside, it is likely to be hampered by the same factors as are commonly seen in studies of
indoor transmission including the air turnover rate. In the current study, we hypothesized that
lower exterior wind speed would be associated with increased risk of transmission during
warmer days, when individuals were most likely to be socializing outside.
Method
To examine the potential for exterior exposure risk, we modeled incidence of cases reported to
the [COUNTY] Department of Health from March 16th, when data first began being recorded
reliably using an electronic interface, until December 31st, 2020, at which time the COUNTY
was enduring a second wave. Data were shared with [INSTITUTION BLINDED] for the
purposes of supporting the COVID-19 modeling efforts at the local level.
Ethics
The analysis of publicly available deidentified case counts retrieved from the internet are
considered to be not human subjects research and are exempt from ethics review.
Measures
The main outcome was the number of daily confirmed incident cases as reported by the
[COUNTY] Department of Health. We limited analysis to dates following March 16th, 2020 with
the opening of multiple drive-through testing sites throughout the area and when case-reporting

routines were established. Population at risk estimates come from population estimates for the
county derived from the U.S. census; susceptible population counts were updated for daily death
counts, and for the reported number of COVID-19-related disease counts.
Since daily case counts exhibit temporal dependence that is primarily determined by the
underlying community force of infection, which cannot be measured directly, in a secondary
analysis, we use an alternative outcome measure of a relative change in daily case counts
compared to an 8-day forward/backward moving average defined as:
1
!𝑐𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑠(𝑡 ) − 8 ∑!"#
$%!&# 𝑐𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑠 (𝑘 )/
∀𝑘 ≠𝑡
1
(
)
!8 ∑!"#
𝑐𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑠
𝑘
/
$%!&#
The 8-day forward/backward moving average serves as a proxy measure of underlying force of
infection allowing to partially capture the variability in absolute case counts that is due to
“natural” transmission patterns rather than external shocks such as wind speed. It is important to
note that, on average, this measure would be zero when case counts remain relatively constant
over time, however during the periods of exponential rise and decay of an epidemic, this measure
would on average be negative, and it would be positive around the peak of an epidemic curve. It
is therefore important to take these distinct behaviors into account.
Maximal daily temperature as well as average windspeed were derived from the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) data portal (w2.weather.gov); data were
recorded at a central location at the [LOCATION BLINDED]. Total snowfall and rainfall were
also recorded in inches. While warmer temperatures are likely to be protective, as warm days
allow individuals to socialize outside, where exposure appears to be markedly lower, increased
windspeed may have diverging effects depending on temperature. In the summer, higher

windspeed increases air flow and may reduce risk versus in the winter when it may work to push
social contacts that were occurring outside to shelter in indoor spaces. When exterior
temperatures are warm enough to allow for outdoor social contacts to occur comfortably, we
anticipated that increased windspeed would reduce overall outdoor risk. In contrast, on days
where exterior temperatures were cooler, increased windspeed might cause individuals to retreat
indoors for social occasions.
Covariates
We adjusted for number of days since lockdown (March 16th, 2020) and days since reopening
began in [COUNTY]. To account for differences in daily reporting patterns, we incorporated a
categorial variable indicating the day of the week that cases were reported. Noting that there has
been significant spread in [COUNTY] following holidays, we incorporated an indicator of
holidays that also incorporated the most significant weekend nearby. We also included covariates
measuring rainfall and snowfall as these weather conditions are hypothesized to correlate with
windspeed as well as social activities outdoors. In the primary analysis, we also adjust for the 8day forward/backward moving average daily case count.
Statistical Modeling
Descriptive characteristics include time-related trends in maximal temperature, daily windspeed,
and daily case counts. Trends in maximal temperature and in average windspeed were provided
alongside smoothed polynomial best-fitting trend lines.
In the main analysis, incidence of COVID-19 positive caseload is reported as counts per day and,
therefore, multivariable-adjusted modeling relied on negative binomial regression (13). Negative

binomial regression was chosen over alternatives including Poisson because we were concerned
about the potential for over-dispersion in the outcome (14) since the infectious disease case load
is highly variable, and because COVID-19 appears to spread commonly through superspreading
clusters (15). A nine-day lag between exposure and case registration was assumed, consistent
with epidemiological estimates of the incubation period for COVID-19 (16, 17) coupled with a
two-day testing and one-day reporting lag period for available estimates online. Unadjusted and
multivariable-adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% C.I.) were
reported. The interval between infection and disease ascertainment is not well known and varies
geographically because it depends substantially on local testing availability and reporting
systems – it can be reduced in places where testing is easy to find and lengthened in places where
testing is difficult or requires hospitalization. As such, we conduct a sensitivity analysis
considering the values of time intervals between exposure and case reporting between 5-15 days.
For our lagging period, we allowed five days was chosen because our experience suggests that it
takes two days to report results of testing to the DOH and an additional day to report those
results online. Fifteen days was selected as a ceiling for index case analysis to reduce the risk of
sequential effects of prior case/exposure cycles; however, sensitivity analyses reported results
from 5-21 days to clarify the impact of those choices. The log-likelihood estimate was reported
to compare model fit for different lags.
We analyzed the secondary outcome – a relative measure of daily case counts – using linear
regression with the same set of covariates as the primary outcome measure and exploring the
results for a range of reporting lags.

Since we hypothesized the effect heterogeneity of windspeed on transmission depending on the
temperature, cutoffs for “warm” days and for days when windspeed was sufficiently fast were
determined by comparing Akaike’s information criterion (AIC) across multiple models using
different details as modeled parameters. We compared AIC between models to determine that
>60°F [15°C] was an optimal cutoff for temperature. Because cutoffs may be useful when
adjudicating risk at the local level, we similarly used AIC and compared model fit using
multivariable adjusted models to identify optimal cutoffs for windspeed and ultimately identified
low windspeed as days where windspeed was <5.5 MPH as the optimal cutoff for these models.
Since the relative measure of daily case counts only partially adjusts for the community force of
infection and underlying “natural” epidemic dynamics, we also conducted additional stratified
sensitivity analyses cut into time periods when case counts were relatively flat (06/07/202011/03/2020) and when epidemic was exponentially increasing (03/16/2020-04/10/2020 and
11/04/2020-12/31/2020) or decaying (04/11/2020-06/06/2020). We use two criteria: daily
temperature (warm/cool) and epidemic dynamics pattern (flat versus rising or decaying) to
determine subsets for stratified analyses. Analyses were completed using Stata 16/MP
[StataCorp].
Ethics
Data used in this study are secondary analyses of de-identified case counts reported on a publicly
available website and therefore this was not human subject’s research.

The average temperature was 67.6 ± 14.4 °F, the average daily windspeed was 8.7 ± 3.6 MPH.
Trends in daily temperature and windspeed are depicted throughout the analytic period (Figure
2). Most days between May 1st, 2020 and October 24th, 2020 were characterized by temperatures
exceeding 60°F (blue dashed lines; solid trend line). Windspeed diminished slowly over time,
and then began to increase again in December 2020.

Further interrogating the functional shape of the relationship between the windspeed and
incidence (Figure 3), we found that during “warm” time period higher windspeed was associated
with diminishing degree of protection. Using the logarithmic transformation to capture this
tapering in a multivariable-adjusted model, we found that while an increase in windspeed from 1
to 2 MPH is associated with a 4.2% reduction in caseload as compared to days when the air was
still, a similar increase from 10 to 11 MPH was only associated with a 0.08% decrease in
caseload on the “warm” days.

As noted in the Methods section, cutoffs were determined to be >60°F [21°C] in temperature,
and <5.5 MPH in windspeed. Using these cutoffs, in Table 2 we examined the risk associated
with lower windspeed (<5.5 MPH) on warmer days (>60°F). Analyses revealed that on warmer
days, having windspeed <5.5 MPH was associated with a 50% increase in incidence in
multivariable adjusted models.

Sensitivity Analysis
We examined the sensitivity of the results to analytic choices by first examining whether reliance
on different outcomes made differences to the results. For the relative change in daily case
counts compared to an 8-day forward/backward moving average, the results were substantively
similar (B = -16.12 [-27.78, -4.45], P=0.007) on warmer days; in other words, as windspeed
decreased by one MPH, incidence increased by 16.12% (Table S1). We also examined whether
choices in the lag between exposure and case reporting changed our results. While the results
shown theoretically represent the appropriate timing, we also examined variation in periods
between exposure and case recording from 5-21 days. We found that while the nine-day
reporting average was the best performing within our hypothesized observational window

13

(Figure S1), that the 16-day reporting lag was the best performing lag structure. Across all lags, a
consistently association was identified linking slower windspeed days with lower follow-up case
counts (Table S2). Finally, we stratified analysis dates into periods characterized by rising,
falling, and stable exposures as defined by rapid sustained increases resulted in the same overall
association (aIRR>5.5MPH = 0.87 [0.75-1.03]; aIRRLn-MPH = 0.88 [0.75-1.05]) though insufficient
observations to achieve statistical power (power = 0.65).
Discussion
COVID-19 is a pandemic that has caused an immense toll on the American population and has
inflicted enormous economic damage. To date, relatively little remains clear about the exposure
dynamics of the disease. Current evidence suggests that COVID-19 is airborne and is
predominantly spread indoors. The present study examined variation in windspeed under the
hypothesis that higher winds may disperse COVID-19 viral particles away from individuals who
are socializing outdoors, thereby offering increased protection among individuals who may have
been exposed to COVID-19 outdoors. We found that slow average windspeed (<5.5 MPH) was
associated with increased incidence on days that were warm enough (>60°F [15°C]) to allow
individuals to socialize outdoors (aIRR = 1.50 [1.25-1.81], P < 0.001). This study supports the
view that outdoor transmission of COVID-19 may be occurring by noting that the risk of outdoor
transmission of COVID-19 was highest on days where wind was reduced.
This study suggests that outdoor exposures may be a pathway of COVID-19 transmission. This
aligns with a number of anecdotal reports from Departments of Health in [COUNTY] (CITE
personal communication) and from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (18), who
have noted that gatherings of increased risk include outdoor social gatherings such as “Backyard

14

barbecues” despite no scholarly evidence to support that conclusion. Indeed, backyard barbecues
have been thought in [COUNTY] to be a main source of exposure despite being outdoors. One
interpretation of this evidence was that individuals may be using shared indoor spaces, such as
bathrooms, where viral particles may be concentrated. However, an alternative may be that
airborne transmission in shared outdoor spaces is feasible on days when wind is insufficient to
disperse viral particles, and the data presented here support this alternative hypothesis.
Limitations
Despite examining a large population (~1.5 million) where a large number of cases (96,057
between March-December 2020) were identified, this study is limited in examining the
experience of a single U.S. county. While this analysis suggests that county residents had fewer
cases arising from days where winds were greater, we cannot conclusively state that individuals
were protected because of higher windspeed. Our results were strongly influenced by covariates
as evidenced by the change in IRR observed in unadjusted versus adjusted models; it is always
possible that key confounders were missing from our model. However, our sensitivity analysis
examining percent change of new cases on a given day relative to the 8-day backward/forward
average case count, attempted to address temporal changes in incidence patterns directly within
the outcome variable, and our results were similar. Follow-up research is necessary to determine
specifics about exposures including distances that COVID-19 viral particles can travel and
reliably infect individuals as well as microclimate differences that may affect specific geographic
differences that may moderate these results.
To obtain a measure of windspeed for this analysis, we relied on data from a central airport.
While this provided highly consistent measures of windspeed for the island, it also provides

15

measures that may not be generalizable to microclimates that can occur in the lea of hills,
fenced-in backyards, or forests. Notably, this choice may mean that cutoffs used here may not
apply in other situations and more analysis is necessary if weather data are going to be relied
upon to help understand caseload in other areas. We reported results from a 9-day exposure-test
positive reporting lag structure; however, sensitivity analyses suggested that a 16-day lag
structure may work better. The 16-day lag is outside of the expected lag period for cases in our
area, but we felt that it might indicate that case dynamics could proceed from asymptomatic
younger individuals to cause secondary cases in older individuals reported 16 days later. As
such, future work should anticipate that different cutoffs will be necessary when windspeeds are
measured in different places and in locations where wind is highly sensitive to local geography.
Implications
Throughout the U.S. epidemic, the role of outdoor shared spaces such as parks and beaches has
been considered and ultimately beaches and parks remained open. This analysis does little to
suggest that either should be closed, since the level of risk due to outdoor exposures should be
weighed in relation to the much higher risk of exposure in shared interior spaces such as houses,
restaurants, or public transport. Instead, this study suggests that individuals socializing outdoors
are not entirely safe by virtue of being outdoors and should remain vigilant. In this case, outdoor
use of increased physical distance between individuals, improved air circulation, and use of
masks in outdoor environments may be useful.
