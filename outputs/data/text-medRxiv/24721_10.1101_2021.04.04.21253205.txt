Research in context
Evidence before this study: Information regarding changes seen in COVID-19 has accumulated
very rapidly over a short period of time. Studies often rely on examination of normal samples
and model systems, or are limited to peripheral blood or small biopsies when dealing with tissues
collected from patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. For that reason, autopsy studies have
become an important source of insights into the pathophysiology of severe COVID-19 disease,
highlighting the emerging role of hyperinflammatory and hypercoagulable syndromes. Studies of
autopsy tissues, however, are usually limited to histopathologic and immunohistochemical
evaluation. The next frontier in understanding COVID-19 mechanisms of disease will require
generation of highly dimensional, patient-specific datasets that can help dissect this complex and
heterogeneous disease.
Added value of this study: Our work illustrates how high-resolution molecular and spatial
profiling of COVID-19 patient tissues collected during rapid autopsies can serve as a hypothesisgenerating tool to identify key mediators driving the pathophysiology of COVID-19 for
diagnostic and therapeutic target testing. Here we employ bulk RNA sequencing to identify key
regulators of COVID-19 and list specific mediators for further study as potential diagnostic and
therapeutic targets. We use single-nuclei RNA sequencing to highlight the diversity and
heterogeneity of coronavirus receptors within the brain, suggesting that it will be critical to
expand the focus from ACE2 to include other receptors, such as BSG and ANPEP, and we
perform digital spatial profiling of lung and lymph node tissue to compare two patients with
different clinical courses and symptomatology.
Implications of all the available evidence: COVID-19 is a far more heterogeneous and
complex disease than initially anticipated. Advanced molecular tools can help identify specific

pathways and effectors driving the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and lead to novel biomarkers
and therapeutic targets in a patient-specific manner. Larger studies representing the diversity of
clinical presentations and pre-existing conditions will be needed to capture the full complexity of
this disease.

Abstract
Background: Current understanding of COVID-19 pathophysiology is limited by disease
heterogeneity, complexity, and a paucity of studies evaluating patient tissues with advanced
molecular tools.
Methods: Autopsy tissues from two COVID-19 patients, one of whom died after a month-long
hospitalization with multi-organ involvement while the other died after a few days of respiratory
symptoms, were evaluated using multi-scale RNASeq methods (bulk, single-nuclei, and spatial
RNASeq next-generation sequencing) to provide unprecedented molecular resolution of COVID19 induced damage.
Findings: Comparison of infected/uninfected tissues revealed four major regulatory pathways.
Effectors within these pathways could constitute novel therapeutic targets, including the
complement receptor C3AR1, calcitonin-like receptor or decorin. Single-nuclei RNA sequencing
of olfactory bulb and prefrontal cortex highlighted remarkable diversity of coronavirus receptors.
Angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 was rarely expressed, while Basignin showed diffuse
expression, and alanyl aminopeptidase was associated with vascular/mesenchymal cell types.
Comparison of lung and lymph node tissues from patients with different symptomatology with
Digital Spatial Profiling resulted in distinct molecular phenotypes.
Interpretation: COVID-19 is a far more complex and heterogeneous disease than initially
anticipated. Evaluation of COVID-19 rapid autopsy tissues with advanced molecular techniques
can identify pathways and effectors at play in individual patients, measure the staggering
diversity of receptors in specific brain areas and other well-defined tissue compartments at the
single-cell level, and help dissect differences driving diverging clinical courses among patients.

Introduction
Concerted research efforts are quickly advancing our understanding of COVID-19
pathophysiology, highlighting pathways that influence uncontrolled cytokine release and
vascular injury1,2,3, and suggesting distinct disease stages4. Studies directly evaluating patient
tissues5,6,7, however, often lack the resolution afforded by interrogation with advanced molecular
methods. Highly dimensional, patient-specific datasets can be generated through multi-scale,
next-generation sequencing of well-preserved rapid autopsy tissues. Bulk sequencing yields
high-read depth profiling, while single-nuclei methods and spatial profiling can interrogate
distinct cellular subpopulations. Mining of such datasets can facilitate novel hypothesis
generation, thus advancing the molecular understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID19 disease mechanisms.

Methods
Tissue collection: Rapid autopsies (6 hours) were performed with appropriate consent and
following COVID-19 safety protocols8. Fresh tissues were frozen on dry ice and stored at -80ºC.
Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues (FFPE) were collected and processed following
routine protocols.
Bulk RNASeq and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA): Bulk RNASeq was performed
from two technical replicates across ten tissues harvested from Patient 1 (see Supplemental
Methods).
Single-nuclei RNASeq (snRNASeq): Debris-free nuclei (~10,000) were isolated from frozen
olfactory bulb (OB) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) tissue from Patient 1. Paired-end cDNA libraries
were prepared using the 10x Chromium platform (v3 protocol) and sequenced on a NovaSeq

instrument (Illumina) to a read depth of 50,000-100,000 reads per nucleus. Cell types were
annotated through machine learning based on published data9 (see Supplemental Methods).

Digital Spatial Profiling (DSP): Unstained 4µm-thick sections were cut from FFPE blocks from
two patients and immunoflourescently labeled with PanCK, CD45, CD68 and DAPI. Twelve
regions of interest (ROIs) per slide were selected for targeted spatial transcriptomics (GeoMx,
Nanostring) with >1,600 cancer atlas transcripts and 10 additional SARS-CoV-2 genes (see
Supplemental Methods).

Results
Fresh-frozen tissue from several organs was obtained at the time of autopsy for Patient 1, a male
in his 60s with a complex medical history including HIV, status post-transplant and cancer in
clinical remission whose COVID-19 hospital admission lasted over a month (Figure 1A). Bulk
RNASeq evaluation revealed viral RNA in the nasopharynx and lung (148 and 120 reads,
respectively, mapping to SARS-CoV-2 reference genome), but not in OB, PFC, oropharynx,
salivary gland, tongue, heart, liver or kidney (Figure 1B). Differential gene expression analysis
between infected and uninfected tissues resulted in 4,376 differentially expressed genes (FDR
<0.05). To assess biological significance, GSEA was performed to probe for Gene Ontology
(GO) categories significantly overrepresented in infected versus uninfected tissues (FDR < 0.05)
(Figure 1C). The top four connected GO categories include “blood vessel development”,
“cytokine production”, “cell activation”, and “structure and degradation”. All four pathways
share TNFα induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3), complement 3a anaphylatoxin chemotactic receptor
(C3AR1), and ADAM8, a metalloproteinase involved in leukocyte extravasation. Other

examples of conserved molecules across multiple pathways include angiopoietin 1 (ANGPT1),
calcitonin-like receptor (CALCRL), and decorin (DCN), an activator of autophagy.
snRNASeq was performed on OB and PFC of Patient 1 (Figure 2A). Dimensionality reduction
and clustering showed expected separation between OB and PFC (Figure 2B) and identified 25
unique subpopulations (Figure 2C) that were annotated using existing databases (Figure 2D, see
Supplemental Methods). Expression levels of any transcript from nuclei within these
subpopulations can inform hypotheses unresolvable by bulk RNA analyses. For example,
examination of multiple coronavirus-associated receptors reveals only scattered expression of
angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in rare cells and robust expression of Basignin (BSG)
throughout, while alanyl aminopeptidase (ANPEP) is exclusively expressed in two
subpopulations enriched for pericytes, vascular, fibroblastic, and stromal cells (Figure 2E).
Digital Spatial Profiling (DSP) was performed on FFPE tissue across multiple organs from two
COVID-19 autopsy patients. Patient 1, as above, and Patient 2, a male in his 60s with diabetes
and heart failure who died after only 3 days of symptoms (Figure 3A). Following
immunostaining, 12 ROIs per slide (Figures 3B,D) were selected for targeted spatial sequencing.
Viral transcripts (ORF1ab and S) were detected in the lungs of Patient 2 (Figure 3C), along with
a more robust inflammatory response compared to Patient 1, including higher expression of
MX1, an interferon-induced GTPase with antiviral activity against RNA viruses, interleukin-1
receptor-like 1 (IL1IR1), and interferon alpha-inducible protein 6 (IFI6), a negative regulator of
apoptosis (Figure 3C). Comparison of lymph node ROIs between these two patients showed
diverging inflammatory signatures (Figure 3E). Patient 1 had higher expression of the
chemotactic factors CCL15 and CCL18, along with TNF and ITGB2, a receptor for the iC3b
complement fragment and fibrinogen, while Patient 2 had higher expression of transcripts related

to cell proliferation and division, including thymidylate synthetase (TYMS), CCNA2, NASP,
lymphocyte antigen 6E (LY6E) and multiple histone subunits (Figure 3E).
Discussion
Here we present multi-scale, high resolution molecular profiling of select tissues from COVID19 patients collected at autopsy and demonstrate how these technologies can facilitate hypothesis
generation. First, we employed bulk RNASeq to evaluate presence of viral RNA across organs
from Patient 1; then compared infected and uninfected tissues to determine key regulatory
pathways associated with infection, including “blood vessel development”, “cytokine
production”, “cell activation”, and “structure and degradation”. Numerous specific regulators are
listed including C3AR1, a complement receptor controlling neutrophil extracellular trap (NET)
formation that can lead to a pro-thrombotic state10, both important mechanisms implicated in
COVID-19 progression4. C3AR1 is thus one of many examples that could serve as valuable
target.
We next performed snRNASeq in the OB and PFC of Patient 1. While significant attention has
been directed to ACE2, there are numerous coronavirus-associated receptors11. In the brain
tissues analyzed here we found that ACE2 was rarely expressed, while BSG was more widely
expressed, and ANPEP showed preferential expression in vascular cell types, such as endothelial
cells and pericytes. Understanding the true complexity of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19
disease will require careful mapping of all receptors and factors in a manner that can resolve
each cellular niche.
Lastly, we demonstrate DSP on FFPE tissues, emphasizing the importance of integrating
transcriptional profiling with histologic features and microanatomical detail. This technology
allows evaluation of a larger sample set, yet still provides viral detection and the ability to

compare patients with different characteristics and disease courses. While many factors could
account for the differences seen between our two patients, it is tempting to speculate that some of
our findings reflect early- versus late-stage COVID-19, both in terms of viral presence and
robustness of lymphocytic activation in Patient 2, with a shorter disease course; and phagocytic
and coagulopathic signatures in Patient 1, with a prolonged hospitalization and extended organ
damage. The limited cohort size and the complexity of the clinical histories precludes further
generalization of these findings.
In summary, we describe four key pathways in severe COVID-19 and provide specific effectors
for further study as potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets. In addition, we reveal
remarkable heterogeneity of coronavirus receptors within well-defined anatomic compartments,
and diverging molecular signatures between patients with different clinical courses, underscoring
the need to deploy advanced molecular techniques to dissect the complexity of COVID-19
pathophysiology.
