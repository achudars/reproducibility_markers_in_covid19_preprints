Abstract: Since the Covid-19 outbreak, researchers have been predicting how the epidemic will
evolve, especially the number in each country, through using parametric extrapolations based
on the history. In reality, the epidemic progressing in a particular country depends largely on its
policy responses and interventions. Since the outbreaks in some countries are earlier than
United States, the prediction of US cases can benefit from incorporating the similarity in their
trajectories. We propose an empirical Bayesian time series framework to predict US cases
using different countries as prior reference. The resultant forecast is based on observed US
data and prior information from the reference country while accounting for different population
sizes. When Italy is used as prior in the prediction, which the US data resemble the most, the
cases in the US will exceed 300,000 by the beginning of April unless strong measures are
adopted.

When facing an epidemic, people and government of a country may underestimate its
seriousness in the beginning but will eventually step up their responses. Hence the case
numbers tend to increase exponentially in the early stage, while the trends will gradually bend
and plateau. Therefore, similarities in the case number trajectories can be observed in different
countries, though the timing and severity can differ substantially due to different responses.
Figure 1 displays the trajectories of total Covid-19 case numbers for China, S. Korea, Italy,
France, Iran, Germany, Spain and USA using Johns Hopkins data. These countries have more
days from time zero than US, where time zero is defined as first day with 100 or more (100+)
cases as a heuristic but widely used choice1. The curve of South Korea increased rapidly early
on but quickly bended and plateaued, for which S. Korea’s swift and deterministic policy
responses are credited2. China exhibits similar but later flattening pattern, which agrees with its
missing early intervention window, but later extreme lockdown policy implementation3. On the
other hand, the cases in Italy and France have grown exponentially until recent days, which
have partially been attributed to their late and weak policy responses4. The US trajectory is
almost linear on the logarithm scale. While the US government is catching up with policies such
as work/study from home, social distancing and self-quarantine, the effect has not seen in the
trajectory.
Existing Covid-19 forecasting are extrapolations into the future time5-11. Their validity
relies on the crucial but unrealistic assumption that the future trajectories are completely
determined by the history. This by design cannot incorporate government responses yet to
come. Not surprisingly, these predictions can be off the target. For example, Fanelli and Piazza7
predicted a maximum number of cases in Italy to be 15,000, where the real cases have already
multipled. Batista8 predicted the pandemic should peak around Feb 9th, 2020, but it shows no
sign of slowing down into late-March, 2020. Zheng et al9 predicted about 20,000 cases in South
Korea, which is unlikely to happen given its current flat trend around 9,000. Models used in

these forecasting are mainly the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) models and its variants5-8.
Others include state transition model9, parametric growth curve models such as logistic
curves10, and auto regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models11.
Proposed Methods
We propose an empirical Bayesian time series framework to forecast the US trajectory by
utilizing the idea of internal time. Since the virus spread to different countries at different time,
their trajectories are different in calendar time but comparable in internal time. We define time
zero as the first day with 100 or more cases in a given country. We first model the trajectories of
the eight countries by a functional mixed effects model12, where different countries shared a
similar mean trajectory over time, and each country has its own random deviation curve. An
additional scalar fixed effect parameter is incorporated to account for different population sizes
on the natural logarithm scale. The estimated coefficient is 0.34, suggesting while the
population size has some effects on the cases numbers, it is not fully proportion to the
population. Both the population-average curve and random deviation curves are modeled by
cubic splines. The model is then casted into state space model for computational efficiency and
forecasting. The smoothing parameters and the variances are estimated through maximum
likelihood.
Based on the estimated parameters using the eight countries, our next task is forecast
the US cases while incorporate one of the countries as the prior information. This is done
through constructing conditional state space model from the functional mixed effects model
conditional on the observed data of the specified country13. By running the Kalman filter forward
on the conditional state space model with the US time series data and into the future, the results
are the posterior prediction incorporating both the prior information from the specific country and
the observed US data. As the reference country is only specified as the prior, the posterior can
be substantially different from the prior, suggesting strong deviation from the reference country.

In addition, the observed US data can be substantially different from posterior prediction,
indicating that the US case are following a different trajectory because of different policy
responses. More technical details are given in the Supplement.
Data Analysis
The Johns Hopkins University CSSE data were downloaded from its GitHub repository
(https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). We modeled the natural logarithms of the
case numbers as the outcome. The data were then used for prediction using the proposed
method. After the posterior means and variances were calculated and the 95% prediction
intervals were constructed, they were taken exponential to transform back to the original scale.
The whole data analysis from reading in the data to plotting the results took less than 10
seconds on personal computer with Intel® Core™i76600U CPU @ 2.60GHz, 2801Mhz, 2
Cores, 4 Logical Processors.
Results
Results based on US data up to March 26th, 2020 are shown in Figure 2~4. Two important
observations can be made from these figures. There is no apparent slowing down yet for US
trajectory based on either the observed trend or predicted trend. This indicates that US is still in
its exponentially increasing phase in the near future.
Figure 2 displays the results using Italy as prior. It shows that US and Italy have similar
patterns and majority of the observed US data are in the 95% prediction intervals. This suggests
that the trajectory in Italy serves as a good prior for the US prediction. Based on this prediction,
on the next day as March 27th, 2020, US may have as many as 108,595 cases. In about 10
days, the US case number will exceed 300,000 around April 4th, 2020 shall the US policy
responses have similarly effects as Italy.

Figure 3 displays the results using China as prior. It shows that the observed US case
numbers are already higher than the predicted values. Even if the US policy responses have
similar effect as China, US case numbers will exceed 150,000 around April 11th, 2020. The
results using South Korea as prior are displayed in Figure 4. US case numbers are predicted to
exceed 200,000 around April 6th, 2020. Since the observed US data are already well above the
upper bound of the 95% prediction intervals, the data from China and South Korea are not good
priors for the US prediction, suggesting that the situation in the US will be much worse than
those in China and South Korea.

Conclusion
We have proposed a new prediction method for predicting total COVID-19 cases of US by
incorporating the information from other countries. While we demonstrated our method in
predicting US cases, our method can be used for predicting state-by-state data as well as
hospital-by-hospital data. Our prediction intervals are much smaller than most exiting methods
due to the additional information from the reference country. We show that the current trajectory
in US is most similar to that in Italy. The stronger response from Italy has led to slowing down of
the spread in the last few days, while the effect of social distancing in the US has not shown in
the observed data.
It is well-known that there are serious under-reporting or under-detection of cases in
various countries and under-reporting rates may be very different across counties. This can
contribute to substantial differences in the trajectories. With the advance of testing techniques,
more and more people are tested in the US. This may also explain why the reported cases in
the US are substantially higher than other countries in the same stages.

Let 𝑁𝑖𝑗 be the number of total COVID-19 cases for the 𝑖 𝑡ℎ country on the 𝑗 𝑡ℎ day, where day 1 is

Predict US trajectory.
The US trajectory was predicted by running the 𝑛𝑈𝑆 observations 𝑦̃𝑈𝑆,𝑗 = 𝑦𝑈𝑆,𝑗 − 𝛽̂ log(𝑝𝑈𝑆 )
through the conditional SSM constructed above with an observation matrix 𝐹 =
(1 0 0 0

1 0). For 𝑗 = 1, … , 𝑛𝑈𝑆 , the first two equations in (7) generated the one-step

ahead prediction, while the last two equations generate the filtered values. Further running the
model for 𝑗 = 𝑛𝑈𝑆 + 1, … , 𝑛𝑖 generated predictions into the future time for US. 𝛽̂ log(𝑝𝑈𝑆 ) was
then added back to recover the effects of population size.
