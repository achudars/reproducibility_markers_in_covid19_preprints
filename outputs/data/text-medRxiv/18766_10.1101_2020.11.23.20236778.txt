Abstract
Objectives
The Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to impose formidable challenges on
healthcare services. The dramatic curtailment of endoscopy and CT colonography capacity has
adversely impacted on timely diagnosis of colorectal cancer (CRC). We describe a COVIDadapted pathway rapidly implemented to mitigate risk and maximise cancer diagnosis in
patients referred with symptoms of suspected CRC during the pandemic.

Design
The “COVID-adapted pathway” integrated multiple quantitative faecal immunochemical tests
(qFIT), to enrich for significant colorectal disease. CT with oral contrast was used to detect
gross pathology. Patients reporting ‘high-risk’ symptoms were triaged to qFIT+CT and the
remainder underwent initial qFIT. Prospective data collection comprised referral category,
symptoms, blood results, medical history, time to first test, qFIT and CT results.

Setting
Tertiary colorectal unit which manages over 500 cancer patients annually.

Participants
All patients referred as ‘urgent suspicious of cancer’ (USOC) were included. Overall 422
patients (median age 64 years, 220 females) were triaged using this pathway.

Main outcome measures
Outcomes comprised cancer detection frequency.

Results
Compared to the same time period (1st April – 31st May) in 2017-2019, we observed a 43%
reduction in primary care referrals with suspected CRC (1071 referrals expected reducing to
609). Overall 422 patients (median age 64 years, 220 females) were triaged using this pathway.
Most (84·6%) were referred as USOC. Of the 422 patients, 202 (47·9%) were triaged to CT
and qFIT, 211 (50·0%) to qFIT only, eight (1·9%) to outpatient clinic, and one to colonoscopy.
Fifteen (3·6%) declined investigation and seven (1·7%) were deemed unfit. We detected 13

cancers (3·1%); similar to the mean cancer detection rate from all referrals in 2017-2019
(3·3%).

Conclusions
The response to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a marked reduction in referrals and
cessation of key diagnostic services. Although this COVID-adapted pathway mitigated the
adverse effects on diagnostic capacity, the overall reduction in expected diagnoses is very
substantial. It is clear that the adverse impact of measures taken to constrain the pandemic will
lead to many undetected cancers due to the decrease in referrals.

Introduction
The collateral damage from the COVID-19 pandemic will have a lasting impact on colorectal
cancer (CRC) survival1,2. The aerosol generating potential of endoscopy, coupled with
COVID-19 faecal presence3–6, led to multiple colorectal and gastroenterology societies
suggesting immediate cessation of all but emergency colonoscopy7,8. This resulted in
suspension of the UK national bowel screening programme, which detected 20·3-20·9% of all
colorectal cancers (CRC) since the start of bowel cancer screening in our unit in 2018. A similar
rationale led to a pause in full CT colonography (CTC) suggested by the British Society of
Gastrointestinal and Abdominal Radiology9. It was clear, through a combination of delayed
presentation to primary care, decreased referral rates and lack of diagnostics, there would be
an inevitable delay in CRC diagnosis.

Given the foreseeable fallout from a tertiary unit managing over 500 colorectal cancer patients
annually, we assembled a team to ensure rationing of available diagnostics was evidence-based
and would further enrich the traditional symptom-based approach10. Whilst the sensitivity of
unprepared CT scans for CRC compared to CTC is lower (75-80% vs 95%), guidance advised
deferral of luminal investigation in patients with a negative standard CT scan9,11. The other tool
available for CRC detection was the quantitative faecal immunochemical test (qFIT) used for
screening and as a triage tool in ‘low risk’ populations12,13. qFIT does enrich for bowel
pathology but cannot be used as a ‘rule-out’ for CRC given the test sensitivity14.

Hence, we designed and rapidly implemented a pragmatic approach to mitigate risk and
maximise cancer diagnosis utilising plain CT and qFIT15. A collaborative approach involved
colleagues from biochemistry, radiology, general practice (GP) and gastroenterology. GP
referrals of ‘urgent suspicion of cancer’ patients (USOC) were triaged daily by colorectal
consultants using age, symptoms (‘high-risk vs low-risk’) and haemoglobin to prioritise those
most likely to have CRC13. Patients were triaged to the limited diagnostics accounting for the
limited availability of both surgical and oncological services, staff and appropriate personal
protective equipment (PPE). Here, we present the outcomes of this approach and assess the
extent to which our COVID-adapted pathway for USOC patients mitigated the risk of delayed
diagnosis due to the pandemic.

Methods

To support referrals for USOC patients during the pandemic a triage process was developed
based on local endoscopy and imaging capacity and qFIT testing. This was done to channel the
type and timing of investigations, interspersed with safety-netting mechanisms including
telephone or outpatient assessment and prioritisation to urgent colonoscopy as appropriate. A
summary of our COVID-adapted pathway is shown in Figure 115.

Eligibility criteria and index testing
Through direct communication GPs were advised to continue to refer USOC patients or those
with symptoms suggestive of serious lower gastrointestinal (GI) disease.

All patients referred with USOC symptoms (palpable abdominal mass, persistent change in
bowel habit to looser stool not just simple constipation, repeated rectal bleeding without an
obvious benign anal cause or blood mixed in with the stool, abdominal pain with weight loss
+/- iron deficiency anaemia [IDA]) consecutively entered the pathway between 1 st April to 31st
May 2020. All patient referrals were electronically triaged by colorectal consultants to one of
three arms:
1. ‘High-risk’ symptoms +/- IDA: In this patient group a qFIT and CT minimal
preparation scan were requested at the same time. Scans were reported by consultant
radiologists as being ‘grossly normal’, ‘equivocal’ or ‘definite cancer’. All equivocal
CT findings were double-reported by a second consultant radiologist. Those with an
elevated qFIT but negative CT underwent repeat qFIT testing +/- colonoscopy.
2. Palpable rectal mass: These patients were seen in person at clinic. In the absence of a
mass, qFIT tests were ordered to inform the next investigation.
3. Those with ‘lower risk’ symptoms underwent qFIT testing only initially. Patients were
then stratified according to qFIT values to enrich for those most likely to have serious
bowel pathology.
It would not have been pragmatic to use 10μg/g as the threshold for investigation given data
from several health boards suggests the positivity rate is ~23%. The initial threshold for further
investigation was therefore based on the Scottish bowel screening guidelines (80μg/g)16. All
patients who returned a test <80μg/g underwent repeat testing. Following two qFITs <80μg/g,

and a negative CT for some patients, safety-netting advice was given. For all patients who
returned tests at an intermediate level (80-399μg/g) a repeat qFIT test and CT was ordered. All
those with a qFIT >400μg/g proceeded to CT without a second qFIT result. CT colon minimal
preparation was a plain CT with the patient taking oral contrast at home and without rectal
insufflation.
Colonoscopy was only performed on those patients with the most urgent need e.g. those with
a CT result highly suspicious but not diagnostic for cancer that required a biopsy.
Safety-netting and post-acute pandemic plans
Safety-netting protocols were enabled to allow for further clinical assessment if symptoms
persisted or worsened. Patients in the ‘low-risk’ symptoms arm who had negative qFITs were
reassured via letter their results suggested a low residual risk of cancer but further investigation
based on symptoms may be required later. Patients were not discharged from the pathway on
the basis of a single qFIT test alone. Investigations in vulnerable patients who met the referral
criteria but were shielding were deferred based on patient preference after telephone
consultation17. The pathway was adapted following the return of limited access to CTC and
colonoscopy in June 2020. Due to the initial wide variability observed in double-testing all
patients with two negative qFITs were offered a CT-minimal preparation scan. Those with tests
of 10-399μg/g underwent CTC and those >400μg/g were referred for colonoscopy.

Statistical analysis
All pathway patients were prospectively entered into a Microsoft EXCEL spreadsheet. Data
was collected on entry route, triage category, demographics, presenting symptoms, blood
results and past medical history. Results of all qFITs and colorectal investigations were
recorded when complete. Given the limited access to CTC and colonoscopy there was no
reference standard. Cancer detection rates during the pandemic were therefore compared to
those from previous years where patients had undergone the standard diagnostic pathways. All
clinical information was available to those reviewing both qFIT and CT results. All patients
(including those who did not have a complete set of tests) were included in the analysis.
Statistical analysis was performed using software R version 4.0 (http://www.R-project.org)
with appropriate packages. Shapiro-Wilk’s method was used to test for normality. Nonparametric data are presented as median and interquartile range (IQR). Variability in two qFIT
tests was measured using Pearson’s correlation coefficient.

Patient and public involvement
Patients and the public were not involved in the design or implementation of this pathway.

Results
Patient demographics and initial triage outcomes
The first iteration of the COVID-adapted pathway ran from 1st April to 31st May 2020. There
were 422 patients included, median age 64 years (55-74) with 220 being female. Patients were
predominantly referred under the USOC category (357), with 48 urgent and 17 routine referrals
being upgraded to USOC by the triaging colorectal consultant.
The time to first test was a median of 14 days (IQR 10-18) and there was no difference between
testing time in CT (median 15 days, IQR:10-24) or qFIT (median 13 days, IQR:10-17). The
median time from referral to qFIT completion was 22 days (IQR: 15-37).
Of the 422 patients, 202 (47·9%) were triaged to CT and qFIT based on ‘high-risk’ symptoms,
211 (50·0%) to qFIT only based on ‘low-risk’ symptoms, eight (1·9%) straight to the outpatient
clinic as ‘palpable mass PR’, and one to colonoscopy and qFIT due to the patient having
undergone a recent CT with a suspicious finding requiring luminal investigation. Of the
patients who entered the pathway 15 (3·6%) declined any investigation and seven (1·7%) were
deemed unfit due to shielding, severe cognitive impairment or being admitted to hospital for
other reasons at the time of testing. There were 82 (19·4%) patients who had an incomplete set
of results; they did not return either qFIT test within six weeks despite pro-active
encouragement from nursing teams or declined to attend for CT (17). Thirty-six of these
patients were from the ‘high-risk’ arm. The COVID-adapted pathway detected 13 CRCs
(3·1%). This was on par with our performance of a yearly 3·3% cancer detection rate from all
referrals in 2017-2019. The flow of patients leading to cancer diagnosis is shown in Figure 2.

Change in activity during the pandemic
The number of overall referrals and activities were compared with the previous three years
(2017-2019) during the same period (April and May). The total number of referrals decreased
by 43% from an average of 1071 to 609 during the pandemic, with a 79% reduction in urgent
(324 to 69) and 64% reduction in routine (581 to 211) referrals. However, the number of USOC

referrals increased by 40% (235 to 329). The decrease in overall referral numbers highlights
that there may be as many as 50% more CRCs in the community that are yet to present or be
referred. The average number of monthly cancer diagnosis in our unit was 44 during the last
three years (2017-2019) whilst the average since February of this year was 30 per month. A
comparison of referral rates from primary care over the four years is shown in Figure 3. A
further 16 cancers were diagnosed as emergencies during April and May; an increase of 33%
on 2019. Following the initial peak of the pandemic, referral numbers for June and July 2020
did not increase (377 and 337 respectively, down from 425 and 500 the previous year).

qFIT results
Of 422 patients, 366 (86·7%) completed at least one qFIT test. The majority of patients (266,
72.7%) had ‘not detected’ (<10ug/g) results, 51 patients (13·9%) had levels between 1079µg/g, 18 patients (4·9%) had levels between 80-399µg/g and 31 patients (8·5%) had levels
400µg/g. The overall positivity rate was higher (27·3%) than our qFIT levels in symptomatic
populations pre-COVID (22% from audit data) suggesting an already enriched population
presenting and completing the tests.

263 patients (62·3%) completed at least one qFIT test and either a CT or colonoscopy as a
definitive colorectal investigation on the pathway: 72·0% had an undetected qFIT, 12·6% had
a result between 10-79µg/g, 6·3% had a result between 80-399µg/g and 9·1% had a qFIT at or
over 400µg/g. Interestingly, we noted differences in the distribution of qFIT values between
'high-risk' and 'low-risk' groups. Contrary to intuitive assumptions, there were more patients
with undetected qFITs in the 'high-risk' group (78·4%) compared to the 'low-risk' group
(68·8%), whilst there were more patients with a qFIT over 400µg/g in the 'low-risk' group
(9·5%) compared to the 'high-risk' group (7·0%). However, these differences were not
statistically significant (p=0·19).

Double qFIT testing
There is limited published data on the use of double qFIT testing to enrich or safety net CRC
patients. Although multiple tests may enrich a few patients, we found considerable variation in
interval double‐test qFIT values (two tests at least two weeks apart). Two-hundred and twenty
patients (52·1%) completed two qFIT tests of whom 184 (83·6%) had both qFIT values under
80µg/g. Eighteen patients (8·2%) had at least one qFIT >80µg/g which triggered a CT and a

further 18 patients (8·2%) had both qFIT values >80µg/g. There were three cancers amongst
those who had two <10µg/g qFIT tests. Two patients had both qFITs under 80µg/g and one
patient had both qFITs above 80µg/g as shown in Figure 5. Pearson’s correlation coefficient
was 0·63 showing moderate test-retest reproducibility, and the proportion of patients who had
one qFIT <80µg/g and another qFIT >80µg/g was 8% (potential incremental diagnostic yield).

CT scan results
Of 265 CTs done, 241 were reported as normal, 15 as equivocal and nine as cancer: one of the
15 equivocal scans was found to be cancer and one of the patients with a scan reporting cancer
was subsequently found to have benign disease. The rest of the 'equivocal' findings were
investigated by endoscopy or CTC: five patients had diverticular disease, four patients were
found to have polyps, two patients had colitis (UC, collagenous colitis), one was normal, one
was presumed to be normal change due to previous surgery but awaiting MRI for further
clarification, and one did not attend the endoscopy appointment.

Cancer diagnosis
Thirteen CRCs were diagnosed overall. The median age at cancer diagnosis was 71 years (6778) with six patients being female. The distribution of pathology and initial treatments are
shown in Table 1 along with final TNM staging for those patients who have already proceeded
to surgery. One patient had metastatic disease in the liver at presentation.

Seven cancers were identified from the CT and qFIT arm (3·5%), two cancers from the qFIT
only arm (0·9%), and four cancers from the outpatient clinic arm (50%). These results highlight
that our pathway design, based on symptoms, was appropriate given the greatest number of
cancers came from the CT and qFIT arm (54%). Four cancers were diagnosed in the group
with qFIT > 400µg/g, two with qFIT results of 10-79 µg/g and three patients with a qFIT result
<10µg/g (Figure 4). Of those patients with a qFIT <10µg/g one patient had frequency and
tenesmus, another loose stool, anaemia and weight loss and the final constipation and rectal
bleeding. Given the smaller number of cancers diagnosed in this group there is potential that
there are patients with undiagnosed cancer. Results of this will become apparent over time and
once safety-netting investigations are complete. Two hundred and twenty-two (52·8%) out of
422 referrals had documentation of digital rectal examination by primary care, of whom 12
stated there was the possibility of a rectal mass. Eight of these patients were fast-tracked to the
outpatient clinic. Of the remaining four, two were triaged to CT and qFIT and two to qFIT

only. Only one patient with a palpable mass had a qFIT undertaken with the result being
21µg/g. Of the cancers that were anorectal a further two would have been diagnosed by rectal
examination had it been done. There were a range of other diagnoses in those without the target
condition that are summarised in Table 2.

Adverse events from index tests
No adverse events were reported from the qFIT test. There were no perforations in those
patients who proceeded to colonoscopy. One patient who was radiologically diagnosed as
cancer was found to have complicated diverticular disease at final pathology but was
symptomatic enough to require operation. One patient did not undergo CT scan due an iodine
allergy. Two patients died following referral with neither starting the pathway. One patient had
a CT-confirmed diagnosis of advanced cirrhosis and died with decompensated liver and cardiac
failure 21 days following referral. Another died within nine days of referral of an unknown
cause, they had a history of weight loss and anaemia but declined investigation for this the
previous year.

Discussion
We describe a novel COVID-adapted triage pathway for colorectal cancer detection which has
mitigated risks for those referred with USOC symptoms during the pandemic. We have shown
that it is possible to implement change rapidly if all stakeholders are committed and in doing
so have highlighted the impact of delayed presentation to primary care on the potential number
of missed cancers during this period. We have examined the impact of using qFIT and CT
minimal preparation scanning on cancer detection rates and have demonstrated that the use of
this novel COVID-adapted pathway has allowed us to match the expected cancer detection rate
in those referred. The variability in double qFIT testing further emphasises the importance of
clinical examination and adequate referral information. This pathway has helped to standardise
treatment and optimise the balance between delivery of effective cancer care and minimisation
of risks to patients and staff. We have developed a responsive framework which is ready to be
utilised during further COVID-19 peaks.
These data have shown that there was a 43% reduction in referral numbers. This was possibly
due to the blanket “lockdown” message by the government and media encouraging people to
stay at home, compounded by the cessation of cancer screening services. Patient anxiety about

attending hospital also increased in the elderly in particular – a group at high risk from COVID19 but also most likely to have serious bowel pathology. It was expected that red flag symptoms
such as rectal bleeding or a new lump would continue to present, however there was concern
that more vague symptoms including change in bowel habit, symptoms of anaemia or weight
loss would be dismissed by patients for fear of wasting doctors time for non-COVID-19
problems18–20.

The decrease in referral numbers was potentially increased by the reduced availability of face
to face appointments in primary care and the huge shift towards telephone triage. As we have
shown half of those patients referred with a rectal mass had a malignancy, suggesting many
may have missed examination findings due to the increased use of remote consulting. This
style of consultation is also less suited to those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds thus
potentially increasing inequalities that are already exist in cancer care21.

It is expected that given the drop in referral numbers, there will be a significant number of
patients in the community with CRC who are as yet undiagnosed. Large scale modelling studies
have estimated >4700 deaths to be attributed to a three-month delay to all cancer surgery in
England with further impacts on death and life years lost if diagnostic services are delayed in
returning to normal1,22. There are likely to be many patients presenting with cancer symptoms
or advanced cancer as emergencies in the future. For patients with localised CRC the risk of
delay in presentation is not known, however, it may lead to upstaging of disease with one study
predicting delays in diagnosis and management may lead to a 17·2% reduction in survival for
those with stage one disease increasing to >29% in those presenting with stage three disease2.
Delays in diagnosis not only lead to reduced survival but also potentially more morbid surgery
and increased likelihood of neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatments. Patients presenting as
emergencies are also more likely to require longer hospital stays and critical care23.

In June 2020, following the end of the initial pathway, referral numbers had not returned to the
usual expected numbers. There was increased, but considerably constrained, access to
endoscopy and CTC. Unless capacity is markedly increased there will continue to be delays to
diagnosis and management of these patients which may persist over a long period of time. Our
median time to index test was 14 days. Given the existing prolonged endoscopy waiting lists
in many centres, the use of this pathway to triage patients will be required for the foreseeable
future. COVID-19 has generated the opportunity to overhaul unwieldy triage systems and

implement a stream-lined approach to patient assessment24. Hence, planning at the outset was
undertaken to embed the pathway into routine service so as to reduce the never-ending burden
on colonoscopy lists. There remains a residual risk for patients and safety-netting plans have
been initiated to offer all patients who return a qFIT test <80 µg/g a second qFIT and CTminimal preparation scan. There was considerable variation in initial triage category assigned
by individual consultants and this should be standardised following the acute phase. qFIT is a
useful test to prioritise access to endoscopy and CTC, with the caveat that symptomatic patients
with a negative test will ultimately require investigation in the long term25.

Limitations
It was not possible to validate the use of qFIT or CT minimal-preparation scan at this time
given the inability to compare it to a reference standard. Our approach was based on the ability
of the tests to diagnose gross pathology and as such this data will become available over time.
We have focussed solely on the detection of overt CRC, with the detection rate of advanced
polyps currently unknown. The sensitivity of qFIT for advanced adenomas has been shown to
be low at 35·7%26. The value of qFIT is known to be significantly lower for more proximal
adenomas and cancers compared to those found distally, with double qFIT testing enriching
for pathology26. Although there were three cancers diagnosed in patients with a negative qFIT
only one was a caecal malignancy, the others being sigmoid and anorectal lesions. The number
of cancers diagnosed in those with two negative qFITs was too small to comment on whether
double-testing enriched for pathology. Throughout the devolved nations different thresholds
have been used to determine what constitutes a positive result for screening patients (80μg/g
in Scotland, 120μg/g in England and 150μg/g in Wales)27. The threshold for determining an
abnormal result is lower (10μg/g) in the symptomatic population28. It is used to enrich
information and target patients with ‘low risk but not no risk’ symptoms29. Therefore, even a
negative result may require further investigation in order to manage risk and demand. There
are concerns therefore that the use of qFIT testing alone could miss cancers in some patients.

A small percentage of USOC referrals as shown lead to the eventual diagnosis of other cancers
or pathologies. It is not known how a qFIT alone based triage system would impact on these
diagnoses. We focussed on patients referred with USOC symptoms and did not include those
referred via routine referrals or those under long-term polyp or genetic surveillance.

Conclusion
The coronavirus pandemic led to a marked decrease in referrals and cessation of key diagnostic
services. Public awareness campaigns should encourage those with ‘high-risk’ symptoms to
come forward, stressing the importance of timely cancer diagnosis. Prioritisation of
symptomatic patients through the use of qFIT and CT minimal preparation scans has been
shown to be a rational approach to mitigate risk and prevent delay to treatment when access to
endoscopy was limited. It is likely that the effect of the pandemic on non-COVID patients will
out-weigh the current effects on health and economy.

Summary box
What is already known on this topic

The Coronavirus-19 (COVID19) pandemic has resulted in a severe limitation of access to
endoscopy and CT colonoscopy services for patients with colorectal cancer due to fears
surrounding its aerosol generating potential. Never before has there been the need to rapidly
implement an alternative pathway for patients presenting with symptoms suspicious for
colorectal cancer. Most data on the use of qFIT relates to the screening population with little
known about its value in those who are symptomatic.

What this study adds

We have described a novel COVID-adapted pathway to mitigate risk and instigate treatment
for those presenting with symptoms of colorectal cancer during the pandemic. We combine the

best available testing data (qFIT and CT minimal preparation scan) to provide a detailed
assessment of the impact of reduced availability of diagnostic testing on cancer detection rates.
Colorectal cancer is common. Reductions in referral numbers during the pandemic indicates
the potential for missed diagnoses. The combination of qFIT and CT minimal preparation has
the ability to mitigate risk and could be incorporated into global healthcare systems in the
longer term in order to provide safety netting of patients until normal diagnostic services
resume.

A summary of the COVID-adapted pathway. Patients were triaged by colorectal consultants with information provided from general practice. They proceeded through the pathway in a step-wise fashion
19
being stratified by qFIT results.
CT: computed tomography scan, CRC: colorectal cancer, IDA: iron deficiency anaemia, qFIT: quantitative faecal immunochemical test, OPD: outpatients department, USOC: urgent suspected of cancer.
