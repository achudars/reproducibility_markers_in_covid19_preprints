Abstract
This paper studies the direct and indirect effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccines among vaccinated
healthcare workers and their unvaccinated adult household members in a mass vaccine program
in Finland.
Methods
We used national databases that record all polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2
infections and mRNA-based (BNT162b2 by Pfizer-BioNTech or mRNA-1273 by Moderna) vaccine
doses administered in Finland since the beginning of the epidemic. These data were merged with
administrative full population datasets that include information on each person’s occupation and
unique identifiers for spouses living in the same household. To estimate the direct and indirect
effectiveness of mRNA-based vaccines in a household setting, we compared the cumulative incidence
of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections between vaccinated and unvaccinated healthcare workers
as well as between their unvaccinated spouses.

Findings
Our estimates imply indirect effectiveness of 8.7% (95% CI: -28.9 to 35.4) two weeks and 42.9%
(95% CI: 22.3 to 58.1) 10 weeks after the first dose. The effectiveness estimates for unvaccinated
household members are substantial, but smaller than the direct effect and occur more gradually
among unvaccinated household members than among vaccinated individuals.
Interpretation
Our results suggest that mRNA-based vaccines do not only prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections among
vaccinated individuals but lead to a substantial reduction in infections among unvaccinated household
members. The results are consistent with the notion that mRNA-based vaccines affect susceptibility
in vaccinated individuals and prevent transmission from vaccinated to unvaccinated individuals.

Governments around the world are hoping to lift Covid-19 restrictions as vaccination coverage increases.
Simultaneously, many under-vaccinated countries and territories have yet to design and initiate their mass
vaccination campaigns. Vaccines have been shown to be effective in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infections
among vaccinated individuals both in clinical trials and in nationwide mass vaccination settings.1–4
However, there is only little real-world descriptive evidence about the indirect effects of Covid-19 vaccinations.5–8
We studied the direct and indirect effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccines in reducing the cumulative
risk of infection among vaccinated healthcare workers and their unvaccinated adult household members
in a mass vaccine program in Finland. We used national databases that record all polymerase chain
reaction (PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and mRNA-based (BNT162b2 by Pfizer-BioNTech or
mRNA-1273 by Moderna) vaccine doses administered in Finland since the beginning of the epidemic.
These data were merged with administrative full population datasets that include information on each
person’s occupation and unique identifiers for spouses living in the same household. To estimate the direct
and indirect effectiveness of mRNA-based vaccines in a household setting, we compared the cumulative
incidence of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections between vaccinated and unvaccinated healthcare
workers as well as between their unvaccinated spouses (see Supplementary Appendix Table A2 for the
covariate balance between the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups). The estimates were adjusted for the
state of the epidemic (calendar time fixed effects), age and sex.
Figure 1 shows the effectiveness estimates of mRNA-based vaccines for preventing Covid-19 infections
among working-age healthcare workers and their spouses between the start of the mass vaccination

program (December 27, 2020) and March 24, 2021 in Finland. We report estimates by follow-up week
after receiving the first dose. We included only persons who had not been infected before the event date.
For unvaccinated individuals, we randomly assigned a placebo event date for vaccine administration
during the observation period (see the Supplementary Appendix, Section D, for details). Using this novel
approach, we ensure that the vaccine effectiveness estimates are not biased by the changing nature of
the epidemic between the treatment and control groups during the follow-up period. Our results remain
qualitatively unaltered if we follow all individuals in the control group from the beginning of the mass
vaccination program (Supplementary Appendix, Figure A3). We used a log-binomial model as it allows
direct estimation of vaccine effectiveness in terms of risk reduction.
Our estimates imply a gradual increase in direct effectiveness over time (Figure 1, Panel A): 26.8%
(95% CI: 7.5 to 42.1) two weeks and 69.0% (95% CI: 59.2 to 76.3) 10 weeks after the first dose. These
estimates are consistent with the results from previous clinical trials and observational studies. Our
results document vaccine effectiveness in a real-world setting, in which it is difficult to separate the
longer-term effects of first- and second-dose vaccinations. Over 40% of individuals included in our sample
received their second dose four weeks after the first dose (Supplementary Appendix, Figure A1).
Our estimates imply indirect effectiveness of 8.7% (95% CI: -28.9 to 35.4) two weeks and 42.9%
(95% CI: 22.3 to 58.1) 10 weeks after the first dose (Figure 1, Panel B). The effectiveness estimates
for unvaccinated household members are substantial, but smaller than the direct effect and occur more
gradually among unvaccinated household members than among vaccinated individuals.
Our results suggest that mRNA-based vaccines do not only prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections among
vaccinated individuals but lead to a substantial reduction in infections among unvaccinated household
members. The results are consistent with the notion that mRNA-based vaccines affect susceptibility in
vaccinated individuals and prevent transmission from vaccinated to unvaccinated individuals.9
The present study is uniquely suited to evaluating the effect of mRNA-based Covid-19 vaccines on
secondary transmission from vaccinated to unvaccinated household members. We were able to merge
individual-level health records to full population data containing detailed information about individuals’
occupations and household IDs, allowing us to estimate the indirect effects of vaccines in a large sample
of couples with discordant vaccination status. Our study is limited by the fact that SARS-CoV-2 virus
exposure may differ between vaccinated and unvaccinated healthcare workers as persons directly involved
with Covid-19 patients are more likely to be vaccinated. Taken together, our result may provide support
for designing effective vaccination strategies, societal control measures and travel recommendations for
vaccinated individuals.

Figure 1: Vaccine effectiveness on vaccinated individuals and unvaccinated spouses living in the same
household
Notes: This figure plots the vaccine effectiveness estimates by week after the first dose of mRNA-based vaccination.
The dependent variable is a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection as recorded in the Finnish
National Infectious Diseases Register. Panel A shows our direct effectiveness estimates (relative risk reduction) for vaccinated
individuals compared to the control group, which is constructed by randomly assigning a placebo vaccination date for
non-vaccinated individuals. Panel B shows the effectiveness estimates (relative risk reduction) for the non-vaccinated
spouses (including cohabiting partners) of vaccinated individuals who lived in the same household with the vaccinated
person as of December, 31, 2019. See Supplementary Appendix for details on sample restrictions. Coefficients in both
panels are estimated using individual-date data collapsed to individual-week data. To construct the relative risk reduction
(RRR) estimates, we first run a log-binomial regression model using a vaccination status indicator variable (vaccinated vs.
unvaccinated) by the event week (follow-up week after vaccine administration) and transform the obtained estimates into
risk ratio coefficients. We then compute the relative risk reduction using the formula RRR = 1 - risk ratio. The solid black
dots show relative risk reduction by week after receiving the first dose of mRNA-based vaccination. Error bars denote the
95% confidence intervals clustered at the individual level using endpoint transformation of originally estimated confidence
intervals.
