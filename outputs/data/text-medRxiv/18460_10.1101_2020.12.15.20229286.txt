ABSTRACT:
Background:
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has made necessary to rationalize healthcare resources, but there are no published data to this moment regarding ambulatory
management of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.
Objective:
Evaluate the results of a protocol for ambulatory management of patients with COVID-19
pneumonia according to the rate of readmissions, admission into the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)
and deaths. Identify unfavorable prognostic factors that increase the risk of readmission, ICU
admission and/or death.
Methods:
Prospective cohort study of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia discharged from the emergency
ward of Infanta Cristina Hospital (Madrid, Spain), that met the criteria of the hospital protocol
for outpatient management. We describe outcomes of those patients and compare those who
needed readmission versus those we did not. We use logistic regression to explore factors
associated with readmissions.
Findings:
314 patients were included, of which 20 (6.4%) needed readmission, 3 (1%) developed severe
respiratory failure, and none needed ICU admission nor died. 29.9% of patients had any one
comorbidity. Hypertension, leukopenia, lymphocytopenia, increased lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH), increased aminotransferases were associated to a higher risk of readmission. A clinical
course of 10 days or longer, and an absolute eosinophil count over 200/µL were associated with
a lower risk. After multivariate analysis, only hypertension (OR 4.99, CI 1.54-16.02), temperature
over 38ºC in the emergency ward (OR 9.03, CI: 1.89-45.77), leukopenia (OR 4.92, CI 1.42-17.11)
and increased LDH (OR 6.62, CI 2.82-19.26) remained significantly associated to readmission.
Conclusion
Outpatient management of patients with low-risk COVID-19 pneumonia is safe, if adequately
selected. The protocol presented here has allowed avoiding 30% of the admissions for COVID19 pneumonia in our hospital, with a very low readmission rate and non-existing mortality.

INTRODUCTION
Spain has been one of the countries most severely hit by the worldwide SARS-CoV-2 pandemic,
with over 230,000 confirmed cases by May 31th 2020 and approximately 28,000 deaths1. When
COVID-19 arrived in Spain, little was known about its course and development. Although most
patients only presented with mild episodes, many developed pneumonia and some of them
developed severe respiratory failure and, eventually, death. As it was especially difficult to
identify the patients at higher risk of unfavorable evolution, the initial clinical strategy was to
admit all patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and pneumonia for treatment and close monitoring.
However, the great accumulated incidence of pneumonia cases in a short time span, showing
an exponential growth of the amount of hospital admissions, led not only to a shortening in
material and human resources, but also to a high risk of collapse for the health system, which
could itself lead to a decrease in the quality of patient care and hence to an increase in mortality.
It became necessary to create a strategy to rationalize health-care resources and prioritize
inpatient attention to those in greater need. Within the Section of Emergency Medicine and
Internal Medicine at the Infanta Cristina Hospital (ICH) in Madrid, Spain, we developed a
protocol in order to select those patients which would truly benefit from inpatient care and
those who could be cared for via outpatient telephonic follow-up, based on established criteria.
In this study, we describe the protocol of ambulatory care for patients with low risk COVID-19
pneumonia and evaluate its results in our setting during the current pandemic.
METHODS
Study design and sample:
A cohort of patients discharged between March 17th and April 25th 2020 from the emergency
ward of the ICH with clinical and radiological diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia was
prospectively evaluated.
Among all patients managed as outpatients, only those who met the discharge criteria
established in the hospital protocol were included. Said criteria (Table 1) were elaborated after
reviewing the literature available at the moment, emphasizing the work of and Fei Zhou et al,2
and Chaomin Wu et al,3 where they describe both favorable and unfavorable prognostic factors
in COVID-19 patients. According to said protocol, a chest radiograph was performed on all
patients with fever and/or other symptoms suggesting COVID-19. Those with no pathological
findings in the radiograph were discharged whenever their clinical status allowed for it. In
radiologically dubious cases, chest CT or lung ultrasound were performed. Blood tests including
blood cell count, biochemical analysis and coagulation study were performed to all patients with
radiological image compatible with COVID-19 pneumonia; in case of hypoxemia, blood gas
analysis was also performed. The protocol also recommended performing a simplified walkingtest in order to assess lung capacity. Said test consisted in having the patient walk fast 30 meters;
it was considered positive whenever oxygen saturation, as measured by pulse oximetry,
decreased by 5 percent or more. RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was performed via nasopharyngeal
swab, according to the instructions from the official health authority at the time of each
evaluation. Patients with suspected COVID-19 pneumonia could be discharged whenever they
did not meet major admission criteria (Table 1). Admission was to be considered in cases with
multiple coexisting minor criteria. However, and due to the absence of strong evidence, the
ultimate decision was always left to the judgment of the physician in charge. The telephone
number of the patient was registered upon discharge and the case was reported to the follow3

up team in order to continue ambulatory surveillance. All patients were discharged with home
therapy, according to the protocol of the hospital valid at the time of discharge.
The telephone follow-up started the day after discharge, which could be daily or once every
other day, according to the patient’s status. In each call, a basic questionnaire was performed,
which included questions about the presence of fever, dyspnea, cough, chest pain, digestive
symptoms and drug tolerability. The importance of isolation measures was also emphasized
during the call. Patients with non-relenting fever despite medication, fever persisting longer
than 3 days after the start of follow-up, resting or minimal-exertion dyspnea, inability to feed or
limiting asthenia, were referred back to the emergency ward for on-site evaluation,
complementary work-up or, eventually, inpatient admission. During the study period, some
digital pulse oximeters became available, and they were lent to the patients at highest risk,
which allowed for a more adequate surveillance of their respiratory status.
Those patients that did not meet the protocol criteria but were also discharged (e.g. those
meeting major admission criteria) were excluded from analysis, as were those for which the
telephone follow-up was deemed unfeasible because of mental illness, language barrier, etc.
Pregnant patients have also been excluded, as they were followed by the Section of Gynecology
and Obstetrics of our institution. Patients with intermediate to low clinical suspicion and
negative RT-PCR were also excluded.
Study objectives
The main goal was to evaluate the results of the protocol for ambulatory management according
to the rate of readmissions due to complications or worsening, the rate of admission into the
Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and the rate of deaths. Secondary objective was to identify unfavorable
prognostic factors that increase the risk of readmission, ICU admission and/or death.
Statistical analysis:
IBM SPSS 16.0 was used for analysis. Quantitative variables are displayed as median,
interquartile range (IQR) and eventually range; categorical variables are displayed as absolute
and relative (%) frequency. For comparative analysis, both the χ² and Fisher’s exact test were
used in the case of categorical variables, and Mann-Whitney’s test for non-categorical
quantitative variables. In order to explore the risk factors associated to readmission, both
bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used. After bivariate analysis,
considering the low rate of readmission (20 in total), only 4 variables were used in the
multivariate analysis. Only those differences with an associated bilateral alpha error lower than
0.05 were considered significant.
RESULTS
Clinical and demographical features of the sample are shown in Table 2. The age median was 45
years (IQR 40-53), and range was 18-70. 52.5% were female. 29.9% of the patients had any one
comorbidity (median 0, IQR 0-1), and 10% had 2 or more simultaneous comorbidities (range 05). The most common ones was hypertension (14.3%), followed by diabetes mellitus (DM) and
obesity (5.4% each), and persistent asthma (4.8%). No patient had kidney or liver failure. The
median time from the initial symptoms was 7 days, and 37.7% of the patients presented on the
10th day of disease progression or later. 71.0% showed a normal pulmonary auscultation, and

only 3.8% of the patients had a temperature equal to or higher than 38ºC at the time of
evaluation.
Laboratory tests are available for all but one patient (Table 3). Among the most commonly seen
abnormalities were elevated aminotransferases (38.5%), elevated D-dimer (27.8%), low
lymphocyte count (25.5%) or low total white blood cell count (8.6%). All patients had a CURB-65
score of 0 to 1 points (94.6 and 5.4% respectively). The statistical distribution of radiological
pulmonary abnormalities is shown in Table 3. The most common infiltrate pattern was a bilateral
affection under 50% of the lung fields (54.8%), followed by unilobar affection (33.4%) and
unilateral multilobar affection (10.5%). Three patients had a normal chest radiograph, and the
diagnosis of pneumonia was made via lung ultrasound or chest tomography. RT-PCR for SARSCoV-2 was performed on 138 (43.9%) patients; 93 were positive (67.4% of the performed PCR
tests), 40 were negative (29.0%) and 5 gave indeterminate results (3.6%). The patients included
in the ambulatory management program had a median of two minor criteria (IQR 1-3; range 08). Only 11.1% of patients had four or more minor criteria. Among them, 15.6% required
readmission.
Table 4 shows the therapy prescribed upon discharge. It shows also the data of the follow-up
and the development of the patients. The telephone follow-up period had a median of 5 days
starting from the day of discharge (IQR 4-6, range 1-11), with a median of 3 telephone calls per
patient (IQR 3-4, range 1-10). Depending on the availability in each moment, in the end 15.6%
of patients were given a portable pulse oximeter to facilitate their monitoring. 62 patients
(19.7%) were reevaluated in the emergency ward at least one second time. Half of them (9.9%)
were referred because of medical criteria (almost all of them because of persistent fever or
dyspnea), whereas the other half (9.9%) presented by their own choice. 42 of those patients
were newly discharged, so 20 patients (6.4%) ultimately needed inpatient hospital admission.
The most common reason for readmission (50%) was respiratory worsening with development
of hypoxemia (SatO2 < 95%), with one only case of respiratory failure (SatO2 88%). One patient
was readmitted with a diagnosis of segmental pulmonary embolism. 60% of readmissions
presented again by their own choice. All patients that were readmitted did so within the first 6
days of follow-up (median 3, IQR 2-4, range 1-6). During admission, three patients developed
severe respiratory failure. No patients needed ICU admission or died.
Secondary objectives
The patients requiring readmission were compared with the ones that did not require it in order
to detect significant differences. As shown in Table 2, there were no differences regarding age
or sex. Among the patients that required readmission, there was a higher proportion of
hypertension (30.0% vs. 13.3%, p 0.039). The frequency of diabetes and obesity was also higher,
but did not reach statistical significance (15% vs. 4.8% in both cases, p 0.085). There was no
difference regarding other comorbidities, neither in the total amount of comorbidities per
patient. Referred symptoms were similarly distributed in both groups, but a temperature equal
or higher 38ºC measured within the emergency ward was more frequent among the patients
that did require readmission (20.0% vs. 2.4%, p 0.003). The readmitted patients showed a
significantly shorter time period since the initial symptoms (7.0 vs. 8.0 days; p 0.009). Not one
patient with 10 or days of disease progression at the time of presentation was readmitted.
The patients that required readmission showed significantly lower total white blood cell,
lymphocyte, eosinophil and platelet counts, and subsequently a higher rate of leukopenia,
lymphocytopenia and thrombocytopenia (Table 3). There were no readmissions among the 28

patients with more than 200 eosinophils per microliter. Readmitted patients had higher levels
of LDH, C reactive protein, creatinine and liver enzymes. There were no differences in D-dimer
or prothrombin activity.
No significant differences were detected in radiological patterns, although a lower rate of
unilobar pneumonia was observed in the patients that were readmitted (Table 3). There was
also a higher proportion of patients with positive RT-PCR in that group, but it did not reach
statistical signification.
The readmitted patients received beta-lactams significantly more (55.0 vs. 32.8%, p 0.043) and
azithromycin significantly less (55.0 vs. 86.7%, p <0.001). There were no differences between
groups regarding hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir or NSAIDs.
In the bivariate analysis, hypertension, leukopenia, lymphocytopenia, increased LDH, increased
aminotransferases and use of beta-lactams were associated to a higher risk of readmission
(Table 5). On the contrary, a clinical course of 10 days or longer, an absolute eosinophil count
over 200/µL and use of azithromycin were associated with a lower risk. However, after
multivariate analysis only hypertension (OR 4.99, CI 1.54-16.02), temperature over 38ºC in the
emergency ward (OR 9.03, CI: 1.89-45.77), leukopenia (OR 4.92, CI 1.42-17.11) and increased
LDH (OR 6.62, CI 2.82-19.26) remained significantly associated.
DISCUSSION
This study describes the experience of applying a management protocol within an emergency
Ward to patients with COVID-19, identifying those patients presenting mild cases and a low risk
for unfavorable evolution, performing outpatient treatment and follow-up, and avoiding their
admission as inpatients. The discharge criteria gathered in this protocol were based on the risk
factors for unfavorable development that were described in the available literature,2,3 which
have been described for hospitalized patients but lack validation for use on outpatients.
The results of our study show that the ambulatory management of patients with low-risk COVID19 pneumonia is safe, by showing a very low rate of readmissions and no associated mortality.
As a reference, both the readmission (6.4%) and mortality (0%) rates of our 314-patient cohort
is akin to the FINE I (5.1% readmissions, 0% mortality) and II (8.2% and 0.4%) categories used for
community-acquired pneumonia, as published in 1997 by Fine MJ et al4 on a cohort of 587 and
244 patients respectively. Currently, there are no therapies available with proven efficacy
against mild COVID-19, and hence, it is likely that the good prognosis of our patients is more
closely related to having been adequately identified than to the therapy administered. Our study
shows that it is possible to manage patients with some comorbidities such as hypertension, DM,
obesity or asthma as outpatients, whenever such patients are in a good clinical condition.
However, the frequency of other conditions (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ischemic
heart disease, kidney disease or chronic liver disease) in our cohort has been very low, so we are
not able to surely say that our results are applicable on such patients.
Secondly, applying a protocol like the one proposed allows avoiding a sizable amount of
inpatient admissions for COVID-19 pneumonia (almost 30% in our experience). The lower
pressure on the health-care system due to this lower amount of admissions leaves more
resources, both material and human, available in the emergency and hospitalization wards.
Those resources may be then used for the care of severely ill patients, which could account for
a benefit in their clinical development.

Our program has relied on a telephone follow-up after discharge. This follow-up had two goals:
on one hand, to monitor the program itself in order to ensure that the proposed management
strategy (with no background or prior experience to support it in the available literature) was
safe and effective; and on the other hand, to identify and rapidly readmit those patients that
showed worsening condition. However, the rate of readmissions has been very low, the severe
complications very scarce and mortality has been non-existent in our sample. Moreover, 60%
patients that were readmitted had gone back to the emergency ward by their own choice, and
the clinical status of the patients reevaluated in the emergency ward was good in general (only
one patient showed respiratory failure at the time of readmission). All this suggests that
telephone follow-up, once the safety of our protocol is validated, might not be essential, but it
might have a role in avoiding a greater number of consultations by providing the patients with
a close follow-up and a greater security.
Thirdly, this study allows us to identify the prognostic factors for both good and bad evolution
in outpatients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Some of these factors have been previously described
for hospitalized patients. Such is the case of hypertension, leukopenia, lymphocytopenia, renal
function impairment or LDH and liver enzyme elevations. Some studies like the one done by Liu
F et al,5 or Sun Su et al6 hint at the fact that a high eosinophil count might be a positive prognostic
factor. On that note, the patients in our sample that were not readmitted showed a greater
eosinophil median, and no patient with an eosinophil count over 200/µL was readmitted. Some
clinical variables seem to be strongly associated with the odds of requiring readmission, such as
fever (temperature over 38ºC) at the time of evaluation in the emergency ward. The fact that
no patient discharged being on their 10th day of disease progression or later required
readmission is noteworthy. This coincides with what has been described about the COVID-19
pathogenesis.7 Once the first week has been overcome, patients might enter an inflammatory
phase with progressive worsening, (in which case they would meet admission criteria) or start
recovering until the fever and the respiratory symptoms are resolved.
There is an important discussion about the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs) in patients with COVID-19.8-12 In our study, there was no significant relationship to be
found between the use of ACE-inhibitors, ARBs or NSAIDs and a bad prognosis. We have not
detected that neither the presence nor the absence of certain symptoms (fever, cough, dyspnea,
diarrhea) predicts good or bad development, and we also do not observe any significant
relationship between the clinical development and the radiological pattern (at least when the
injuries affect less than 50% of the lung fields). In our cohort, the D-dimer levels were not
correlated with the evolution of the patients, although no patient had a D-dimer level above
1,000 ng/mL (being an exclusion criterion). The association of D-dimer and severity is well
described in the literature,13,14 but its association with respiratory distress and/or mortality
significantly increases with values above said threshold. Therefore, it is possible that its
differentiating role is much less relevant for values below 1,000 ng/mL.
Our study has observed a higher rate of beta-lactam use and a lower one for azithromycin in the
group that was eventually readmitted. These findings shall be interpreted cautiously, since the
study is not designed to evaluate their efficacy and it is highly likely that there are numerous
biases affecting them. The therapeutic protocols for COVID-19 have varied very rapidly along
the course of this epidemic, and the therapies prescribed may have been strongly affected by
subjective criteria depending on each physician, due to the scarce available evidence.

Retrospective analysis of our findings allows us to propose some improvements for our protocol.
Slightly elevated D-dimer (yet below 1,000 ng/dL) seems to be of no prognostic value, so they
might be withdrawn from the list of minor criteria. To simplify clinical decision-making, the
maximum number of minor criteria could be limited to three, which would still include 88.9% of
the analyzed patients, but would slightly reduce the risk of readmission. Besides, a short
observation period (less than 24 hours) before discharge might be convenient for patients
presenting high fever at the time of evaluation in the emergency ward. In any case, new studies
are needed to confirm such findings.
Limitations of this study:
This study has some limitations, including having been performed only in one hospital, which
may hinder its external validity. Older or more comorbid populations might account for a lower
proportion of ambulatorily manageable patients, although some select patients might benefit
from it. Another relevant issue is the fact that the study does not include information about the
cases that were admitted into hospital upon their first visit, so we do not know if there may have
been patients that met discharge criteria but were indeed admitted as inpatients and then
eventually required ICU admission or died. However, and as a consequence of the great pressure
on the emergency ward of our hospital during the pandemic, the ambulatory follow-up program
included almost 50% more patients than the ones analyzed, who did fulfil major admission
criteria but were discharged for being clinically stable. Those patients have not been included in
the protocol analysis, but they somehow show that the trend at the moment was prioritizing
outpatient management whenever possible. It shall be noted that those patients evolved well
in general.
Thirdly, the results of the RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 is only available in 44% of the cases, and a
positive result is only present in 30% of the cohort. We consider this to be a consequence of two
factors. The protocols from the valid health authority at each moment have changed widely
during the pandemic. During most of the study period, performing the test was only authorized
in dubious cases, and hence the diagnosis of typical cases was based on clinical, radiological and
laboratory findings. Besides, 29% of the patients on whom PCR was performed have a negative
result. We do not believe this fact to impair the reliability of our results, since PCR sensitivity in
our institution was found to be 65-70%, only PCR-negative patients with high clinical suspicion
were included in the study, and positive predictive value for COVID-19 diagnosis in Madrid,
during the peak of the pandemic was remarkably high. In addition, there were more tested
patients among those who were readmitted. The explanation could be that chances of be tested
were higher for them, as they were finally admitted into hospital for a clinical deterioration.
Finally, we have detected a great difference between groups regarding the prescribed
treatment. This might be a problem in the setting of highly effective treatments, but the
evidence available at the moment does not suggest that beta-lactams or azithromycin have a
relevant therapeutic role in COVID-19 pneumonia.15-17
CONCLUSIONS
In the setting of a great overload of the healthcare system and risk for collapse, the identification
of low-risk patients for their ambulatory management is fundamental in order to free hospital
resources that then may be destined for more severe patients in greater need. The outpatient
management of patients with low-risk COVID-19 pneumonia is safe, whenever they are
adequately selected. The management protocol presented in this study has allowed avoiding
30% of the admissions for COVID-19 pneumonia in our hospital, with a very low readmission

rate and non-existing mortality. Hypertension, high fever at the time of evaluation, leukopenia
and increased LDH were associated to a higher risk for readmission, while a high eosinophil
count and a longer time since the start of symptoms were associated with low risk. In addition,
mild elevation of D-dimer did not seem to have prognostic relevance.
