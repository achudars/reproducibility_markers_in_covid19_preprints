Abstract—The use of face masks is recommended worldwide
to reduce the spread of COVID-19. A plethora of facial coverings
and respirators, both commercial and homemade, pervade the
market, but the true filtration capabilities of many homemade
measures against the virus are unclear and continue to be
unexplored. In this work, we compare the efficacy of the following
masks in keeping out particulate matter below 2.5 microns:
N95 respirators, surgical masks, cloth masks, cloth masks with
activated carbon air filters, cloth masks with HVAC air filters,
lightly starch-enhanced cloth masks, and heavily-starched cloth
masks. The experiments utilize an inhalation system and aerosol
chamber to simulate a masked individual respiring aerosolized
air. COVID-19 disproportionately affects people in low-income
communities, who often lack the resources to acquire appropriate
personal protective equipment and tend to lack the flexibility to
shelter in place due to their public-facing occupations. This work
tests low-cost enhancements to homemade masks to assist these
communities in making better masks to reduce viral transmission.
Experimental results demonstrate that the filtration efficacy of
cloth masks with either a light or heavy starch can approach the
performance of much costlier masks. This discovery supports
the idea of low-cost enhancements to reduce transmission and
protect individuals from contracting COVID-19.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), also known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), is a highly infectious virus that has changed the modern
global landscape with over 15 million confirmed cases and
633,000 deaths as of this paper submission and growing
[20]. COVID-19 is transported primarily through respiratory
droplets and contact routes. Respiratory droplets are droplet
particles with a diameter between 5 µm and 10 µm, and
contact routes include direct contact of mucosal surfaces with
infected people or fomites [24]. A sneeze can generate as many
as 40,000 droplets, which can evaporate to particles in the
0.5µm to 12µm range [6]. During this pandemic, numerous

countries deemed the use of cloth masks in public mandatory
or highly encouraged to minimize the ability of sneezes and
other droplet-emitting actions to spread the virus [13]. The
CDC released a statement supporting the efficacy of masks
in reducing the spread of the virus from infected individuals
with and without external symptoms [4]. However, healthcare
personal protective equipment (PPE) resources are already
stretched thin, and encouraging the public to purchase masks is
further dwindling hospitals’ limited supplies [2]. Low-income
communities suffer disproportionately from COVID-19, having both a higher risk for transmission and a lower probability
of recovering fully. A large factors of this is due to the lack of
PPE [11]. To combat these issues, people make cloth masks
at home, both for personal use and to donate to communities
in need. Although these efforts are with good intent, the
efficacy of these cloth masks in providing adequate protection
is unclear. A study before the COVID-19 pandemic shows that
penetration of cloth masks by sodium chloride particles within
a specified size range is almost 97% while that of medical
masks is 44% [14]. For this reason, the ability to manufacture
low-cost facial masks with higher performance at home is
especially valuable in these low resource communities.
The availability of resources for both hospitals and civilians
is increasingly limited. Thus, we study the potential of lowcost materials and homemade masks in reducing the spread
of the virus to spare medical resources for hospitals and
encourage the use of effective filtration techniques in everyday
life. In this work, we test various low-cost mask systems
alongside popular medical and high-performance masks such
as N95 masks. N95 masks use electrostatic filtration to trap
particles [1]. Sars-CoV2 has amino acids that are chemically
attached to sugars which can be charged, and is negatively
charged at a neutral pH [1]. Thus, electrostatic surfaces like
that of an N95 mask trap virus particles very effectively,
adding an extra layer of filtration beyond the physical barriers
of a mask [5]. To analyze the efficacy of the various masks in

reducing the spread of the virus, we measure their ability to
block aerosol particles that are similar to respiratory droplets
that transmit COVID-19.
II. M ASK T YPES
We test a variety of masks which are described below.
A. N95
N95 respirators are Filtering Facepiece Respirators, FFRs,
that filter at least 95% of airborne particles. They are designed
to seal tightly around the user’s mouth and nose, although
some leakage is still expected. N95 respirators currently must
be disposed of, after each use. They limit the user’s exposure
to particles like the small aerosol droplets in which the virus
travels, but they do not necessarily filter the air that the user
exhales [9]. We use a variety of N95 mask models and brands,
including some with extra filtration; this accounts for the
variation of data observed within N95 results.
B. Surgical
Surgical masks are face masks that are meant to block largeparticle contaminants such as sprays or splatters from reaching
the user’s mouth or nose [19]. They are designed to be loosefitting and do not protect from small airborne particles, such
as those disseminated from coughs or sneezes [19]. Surgical
masks are single-use, disposable face coverings.
C. Cloth
Cloth masks are face coverings that are widely available
for the public and can be easily made at home. The CDC
recommends that people use cloth masks whenever they exit
their homes, because they may prevent virus-carrying individuals from spreading it to others [4] They vary in design
and material, but in this study, we use a wide range of cotton
fabrics to best mimic usage in the public [15]. We also include
cloth masks made from the government-supplied mask fabric
distributed in the slums of Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh, India.
D. Activated Carbon Air Filter
Activated carbon, or activated charcoal, air filters use adsorption to purify the air of volatile organic compounds, odors,
and other pollutants [18]. We use the cloth mask design with
a pocket for the activated carbon filter.
E. HVAC Air Filter
HVAC air filters are commonly used in heating, vacuuming,
and air conditioning to filter a variety of pollutants and
biological contaminants [8]. HVAC filters are effective in
filtering particles as small as 0.3 microns [8]. We place an
HVAC filter in the cloth mask pocket. We use a variety of
cloth masks, which explains the variability in the performance
of the HVAC filter masks.

F. Starch
Rice is a staple food in many Asian communities and is
consumed around the world [7]. Rice starch can be easily
extracted by draining boiling rice before it is fully cooked.
Starch is commonly used to stiffen cloth. We make starched
cloth masks to better filter and trap aerosol particles that
can potentially carry the virus. Starch has two components:
amylose and amylopectin. The former has a linear structure of
glucose molecules, while the latter has a branching structure.
Long-grain rice varieties have higher amylose content while
short-grain rice varieties have higher amylopectin content [17].
Due to its structure and hydroxyl groups, amylopectin is easily
dissolved in water, so longer grain rice varieties produce less
starch because of their higher swelling temperatures [23]. The
government-supplied rice for the slums of Tirupati, Andhra
Pradesh, India is medium-grain, so we use the same type to
accurately replicate their amylose and amylopectin content.
The hydroxyl groups in starch make starch a polar molecule.
This may give starched cloth masks both the physical and
polar barrier capabilities of an N95 mask [16]. The procedure
for producing the starch masks is as follows: (1) cook rice in
a 1:5 rice-to-water ratio, (2) sieve out the starchy water when
the rice is 75% cooked, (3) soak a cloth mask overnight in
the starch water. For the light starch mask, we squeeze out
the starchy water from the mask in the morning and allow it
to dry. For the heavy starch mask, we allow the mask to dry
naturally without squeezing out the water. Although the heavy
starch mask is more effective in filtering out particulate matter,
the light starch mask is less stiff and offers more comfort.
G. Price Comparison
The price of masks can be a key concern in low-income
communities. We look through CDC-recommended mask
models, average mask prices in various online providers, and
speak to community groups overseeing mask making in rural
India to identify accurate prices. Many masks and materials,
such as N95 respirators, surgical masks, activated carbon filters
and masks, and HVAC air filters, are typically sold in bulk.
We divide the bulk prices by the number of mask units to
display the per-unit prices of masks and materials in Figure
1. Activated Carbon (filter only) refers to the per-unit price
of purchasing an Activated Carbon filter in a pack, while
Activated Carbon Cloth Mask is the price of purchasing a
pre-made mask. Cloth (low-income India) masks are charitydistributed masks in the city of Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh, India
[21]. Cloth (retail USA) masks are the masks found when one
searches for cloth masks on Amazon or Google in the US.
III. M ETHODS AND E XPERIMENTAL D ESIGN
We simulate an individual breathing air containing respiratory droplets through a mask by building a chamber in which
a masked mannequin inhales the aerosolized 0.9% saline
solution, a polar molecule. N95 masks serve as the gold standard and no masks serve as a negative control. Experiments
record the efficacy of surgical masks, cloth masks, cloth masks
with activated carbon air filters, cloth masks with HVAC air

filters, lightly starched cloth masks, and heavily starched cloth
masks in comparison to the controls. The experiments collect
particulate matter readings through the use of no mask, N95
mask, surgical mask, activated charcoal carbon cloth mask, air
conditioning filter cloth mask, light starch cloth mask, heavy
starch cloth mask, and regular cloth mask in an aerosolized
setting. Our design for the cloth masks, shown in Figure 2, is
worn like an N95 mask and tied in the back to maximize facial
coverage and minimize leakage. Figure 3 shows the pores of
a starched cloth mask beside the pores of a regular cloth mask
to highlight starch’s ability to reduce pore size in cloth masks.
We compare the PM2.5 concentration of each mask across
numerous experimental trials, using no mask data as a negative
control and N95 mask data as a positive control. These values
represent how many aerosol particles of size 2.5 microns
or less pass through the mask. Although respiratory droplets
typically are in the 5 to 10-micron size range, droplet nuclei
or aerosols in the size range of 0.3 to 5 microns can travel
farther and remain in the air for longer [22] [10]. In this paper,
particles of size 2.5 microns and below (PM2.5) remain the
primary focus to conservatively account for droplet nuclei,
considering the assumption that masks effective at filtering
such minuscule particles will also be effective in filtering
larger droplets.
The materials used in this experiment include the masks,
a 30 L plastic container with an airtight lid, a Styrofoam
mannequin head, two PMS5003 dust laser sensors from the
Atmosome Measurement System, two 12000 RPM mini DC
motors with attached plastic propeller blades, two L293D
motor drive shields, an Arduino Uno, one 2 cm x 24 cm
vacuum tube, an aerosol nebulizer, and saline solution [3].
Figure 4 displays the experimental setup.

vacuum tube, 2 cm diameter and 24 cm long, and sealed
with hot glue. The motor is connected to a motor shield and
Arduino outside the bottle and plugged into a power socket.
We programmed the motor to mimic tidal breathing with
cycles consisting of 2 seconds inhale and 3 seconds pause
(exhale), totaling 12 breaths per minute like a human being
at rest. As the purpose of the circuit was to test the filtration
capabilities of a mask, the exhale was not done through the
mask, but rather simulated by pausing the motor.

energy ultrasonic waves that pass through the solution and
emit tiny aerosol particles through a micromesh. Wound wash
sterile saline solution, consisting of purified water and 0.9%
sodium chloride, represents respiratory aerosols that the virus
travels through. Since the saline solution is polar, it more
accurately represents the chemical properties of a virus [1].
The aerosolized liquid then pops out through the micromesh
holes of the metal in atomized particles.
B. Aerosol Chamber
A plastic container with a foam-lined, airtight lid houses
the mannequin and simulates an indoor room in which an
individual could be resting that contains aerosols that the virus
could travel in. The mannequin head sits at the end of the
chamber, with its inhalation system resting outside the box
through a hole. The aerosol nebulizer sits at the other end,
with another PMS5003 sensor, DC motor fan. We regulate a
constant level of PM2.5 particles in this chamber by ensuring
that the PMS5003 sensor values remain within a constant
range. The DC motor fan blows down directly onto the aerosol
stream to ensure that the particles circulate throughout the
chamber.
C. Inhalation System
An Arduino-based suction pump system emulates respiration. A 12000 RPM Mini Magnetic Motor with propeller
blades affixes to the inside bottom of a 9 cm diameter bottle.
The bottom has two circles of five 0.5 cm holes each drilled.
The mouth of the bottle is attached to a lightweight plastic

First, we turn on the aerosolizer and allow the sodium
chloride particulate count of size 2.5 microns and less to build
up to an average saturation range of 8500 to 9500. We maintain
this concentration in the aerosol chamber throughout the trial.
Next, the mannequin begins respiration through the mask.
We begin recording data after 45 seconds, to allow for the
sensor to stabilize its output. Then, we record PM2.5 readings
from the mannequin’s sensor as the mannequin respires for 2
minutes. With a resting breathing rate of 12 breaths/minute,
alternate breaths are recorded to allow for maximum variability
in the data. Each mask type has 16 individual trials with new
masks in each trial. Between each measurement, we ventilate
the container to reset the particulate matter count. We cycle
through all masks before conducting a second trial, again
maximizing the variability of data between masks of the same
type. Figure 5 displays this nested experimental design. The
means of every experimental trial and the comprehensive data
sets are important for analysis, because the former provides
independent data points and the latter provides a larger pool of
data. We analyze the results through raw data visualizations,
ANOVA models, nonparametric tests, and post-hoc tests on
both the mean subsets and the whole data. We clean, visualize,
and analyze the data using several Python packages, including
NumPy, Pandas, StatsModels, Pingouin, SciPy, and Matplotlib.
IV. E XPERIMENTAL R ESULTS
Results show that activated carbon masks and HVAC air
filter masks are nearly as effective as N95 respirators. Surgical masks and heavy starch cloth masks are almost equally
effective, followed closely by light starch cloth masks. Regular
cloth masks do provide some filtration in comparison to the
no mask control, but not by much. These findings can inform
actionable public health and safety recommendations, because
they suggest that low-cost enhancements to masks can be
performed within households to significantly improve mask
performance and, ultimately, reduce the spread of the virus.
Figure 6 shows the distribution of PM2.5 concentrations
for each mask over a 2-minute series of readings. This graph
suggests that the masks have varying filtration capabilities.
Figure 7 visualizes the spread of PM2.5 concentration across
each mask type.

Fig. 4. Experimental setup. Primary components include the inhalation simulation (left half of setup until end of mannequin) and aerosol chamber design
(rectangular prism with sensor and fan). The materials in this setup include the masks, a 30 L plastic container with an airtight lid, a Styrofoam mannequin
head, two PMS5003 dust laser sensors, two 12000 RPM mini DC motors with attached plastic propeller blades, two L293D motor drive shields, an Arduino
Uno, one 2 cm x 24 cm vacuum tube, an aerosol nebulizer, and saline solution.

Fig. 5. Nested experimental design. For each type of mask, we conduct
16 independent experimental trials with new mask models in each trial. Each
trial consists of 12 individual readings. We study both the means of these
trials and the comprehensive data in the experimental results.

statistics for the masks, ordered from least to most effective,
are displayed Figures 8 and Table I. The statistics indicate that
the mean concentration of PM2.5 inhaled by the mannequin
wearing a lightly starched cloth mask provides a three-fold
improvementment in filtration ability over that of a regular
cloth mask. The differences in box sizes in Figure 8 and
the varying standard deviations across mask types in Table

I reflect that the data lacks homogeneity of variance between
categories; the Bartlett’s test for equality in variances confirms
these observations. Thus, we use the Welch ANOVA model,
as opposed to another model which assumes homogeneity of
variance, to confirm the statistical significance of the results
shown in Figures 6 and Figure 8.
We adopt a conservative significance standard, with a pvalue ¡ 0.001 considered significant in our results. The Welch
ANOVA test returns an F-statistic of 554.83 and a p-value
much lower than 0.001, concluding that there is sufficient
evidence for at least one of the mask types to be significantly
different from the others in filtering particulate matter under
2.5 microns.
We examine these differences by performing pairwise ttests between each mask type and the cloth mask, with
the assumption of equal variance set to false. Since the pvalues are far less than 0.001, there is sufficient evidence
that each mask type is significantly different from the cloth
mask. For instance, this shows evidence that the regular cloth
mask allows more particulate matter to permeate through it,
confirming that starching a cloth mask provides significantly
better protection.
We check our assumptions for normality using the ShapiroWilks test and Q-Q plots. The independent trials for each mask
type do reflect a normal distribution, but the small sample sizes
make it difficult to assume normality despite these results.
Non-parametric tests allow for a conservative verification of
the previous parametric results because they do not assume
normality.
We conduct the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test, which

Fig. 6. Time series of concentration of particulate matter below 2.5 microns (PM2.5) that passes through each mask over a 2-minute period during
respiration. We record data at alternate breaths to allow for maximum variability. This plot suggests that the efficacy of the masks takes the following order,
from most to least effective at filtration of PM2.5: N95 Respirator, HVAC filter and Activated Carbon filter, Surgical Mask and Heavy Starch Mask, Light
Starch Mask, Cloth Mask.

Fig. 7. Distributions of the mean concentrations of particulate less than or equal to 2.5 microns that pass through each mask, in individual trials.
The wider spread of data indicates a higher permeability of particulate matter in the cloth mask, with the distribution skewed toward higher particulate
concentrations than the other masks. Some distributions look fairly normal, while others do not. The small sample sizes make it difficult to determine whether
parametric tests, which require data to be in normal distributions, can be performed or not.

returns a statistic of 121.05 and a p-value much below 0.001.
These results confirm again that the samples are not drawn
from a similar distribution and that there is sufficient evidence
that at least one of the mask types is significantly different
from the others in filtering particulate matter.
As the Kruskal-Wallis test does not indicate which samples
differ or by how much, we use the Mann-Whitney U test, a
non-parametric statistical significance test for determining if
two samples are drawn from the same distribution, to confirm
the results of the t-tests. In this test, all the other types of
masks compare against the cloth mask. All the tests yield the
following result: the result statistic of 0.000 indicates that all
the particulate values for the cloth sample are greater than
all the values for the light-starch, heavy-starch, N95, activated
carbon, HVAC filter, and surgical samples. The p-value is less
than 0.001, indicating that the samples belong to different
distributions.
B. Analysis of the Comprehensive Data Set
In order not to violate the assumption of independence
between observations in the aforementioned tests, the results
only analyze the means of experimental trials instead of the
entire data sample. In this section, we leverage the complete
data set described in the nested experimental setup of Figure
5. This significantly increases the sample size per mask trial
from 1 mean to 12 readings, producing a resultant data set
of 192 readings per mask type, as opposed to the 16 readings
used in the Welch ANOVA. The parametric repeated measures
ANOVA test is for related groups, such as those in the nested
model, and does not rely on the independence of observations.
The Greenhouse-Geisser corrected p-value adjusts for high
sphericity, or unequal variance, in the repeated measures
ANOVA test. The resulting p-value is much below 0.001,
confirming that the statistical significance in the difference
between each mask type is true for larger data sets as well.
Although the Shapiro-Wilks test shows some evidence that
the complete data set is not normally distributed, this result
is not fully conclusive due to the small sample size. We also
implement the Friedman Test, the non-parametric version of
the repeated measures ANOVA test, in case the normality

of the distributions is compromised. The very low p-value
returned by the Friedman test confirms our conclusions from
the Repeated Measures ANOVA model.
To test whether the larger data set replicates the results of
the pairwise t-tests for independent observations in showing
that each mask is different from every other mask and to
measure the magnitude of this difference, we conduct the
non-parametric, pairwise Games-Howell test. Table II shows
these results. The low p-values confirm that the differences
in mask performance are statistically significant throughout
the data set. The difference between means column shows
the magnitude of the disparity in efficacy between masks, by
comparing the concentration amount that mask A filters to the
concentration amount that mask B filters. For instance, the
difference in concentration between cloth masks and heavy
starch masks is almost equivalent to the difference between
cloth masks and surgical masks, which explains that heavy
starch masks and surgical masks are almost equally efficient.
After both parametric and non-parametric analysis of the
data, which account for any assumptions, the results confirm
that the mask types come with different filtration abilities.
Thus, the masks’ efficacy in filtering PM2.5 takes the following order, from most effective to least effective: N95, activated
carbon, HVAC filter, surgical, heavy starch, light starch, and
regular cloth mask.
V. C ONCLUSIONS
Evaluating the efficacy of some popular and some novel
low-cost materials in boosting filtration characteristics of
masks can help equip communities to make and donate better
protective masks with little to no additional cost (and even
reducing the cost in some cases). In rural and impoverished
areas where COVID-19 breakouts are occurring [12] where
purchasing masks may not be an option, soaking a homemade
cloth mask in rice starch can make a simple cloth mask much
more effective. It is also crucial for people around the world
to understand that cloth masks tend to offer a false sense of
security and that they can take simple measures in their own
homes to increase the efficacy of these masks threefold. With
the highly contagious nature of the virus, each member of

TABLE II
PAIRWISE G AMES -H OWELL TEST RESULTS . T HE RESULTS ALL HAVE P - VALUES MUCH LESS THAN 0.001, WHICH THE TEST ROUNDS TO 0.001. T HESE
RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT EACH TYPE OF MASK IS SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM EVERY OTHER TYPE OF MASK IN ITS FILTRATION
CAPABILITIES . T HE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MEANS COLUMN SHOWS THE MAGNITUDE OF THIS DIFFERENCE , BY COMPARING THE CONCENTRATION
AMOUNT THAT MASK A FILTERS TO THE CONCENTRATION AMOUNT THAT MASK B FILTERS . F OR INSTANCE , THE DIFFERENCE IN CONCENTRATION
BETWEEN CLOTH MASKS AND HEAVY STARCH MASKS IS ALMOST EQUIVALENT TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CLOTH MASKS AND SURGICAL MASKS ,
WHICH EXPLAINS THAT HEAVY STARCH MASKS AND SURGICAL MASKS ARE ALMOST EQUALLY EFFICIENT.

every community must take the necessary precautions to keep
themselves and others safe.
The primary limitation of this study is that it has not been
performed with real respiratory droplets or virus particles. We
attempted to simulate such an environment with particles of
a similar size and chemical nature. However, there may be
some inaccuracy in the results due to differences between
the simulation and real-world scenarios. In addition, due to
limited resources, we were unable to test masks with a variety
of brands for one kind of filter or cloth, so the efficacy of
other types of cloth masks may vary. Other types of starch
with differing concentrations of amylose and amylopectin may
also minorly affect the filtration properties of the masks. The
fit of the masks on the mannequin may not also not perfectly
replicate the leakages created when worn by a person, because
the focus of this study is primarily to compare the filtration
abilities of the materials themselves.
