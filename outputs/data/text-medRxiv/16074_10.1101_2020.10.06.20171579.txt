Abstract
Introduction
The severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19), created a pandemic in late 2019. Acute respiratory distress syndrome
can occur in patients with COVID-19 due to viral replication and an uncontrolled immune
reaction. Therefore, antiviral and anti-inflammatory treatments are of particular interest to
clinicians. We compared the efficacy of methylprednisolone and dexamethasone in reducing
inflammation and improving the partial pressure of arterial oxygen and fraction of inspired
oxygen (PaO2/FiO2 or P/F) ratio in COVID-19 patients.
Methods
We selected 60 files for this retrospective quasi-experimental study using a convenient sampling
technique and divided them into two groups of 30 patients each who had received either

dexamethasone or methylprednisolone. The data were taken from the medical records of the
treated patients. Group 1 patients were given dexamethasone 8 mg twice daily, and Group 2
patients were given methylprednisolone 40 mg twice daily for eight days during their stay in our
high dependency unit and our Intensive Care Unit. The remaining treatment was the same for
both groups using antibiotics and anticoagulation. We reviewed C-reactive protein (CRP), serum
ferritin level, and P/F ratio before and after the administration of both drugs for eight days. We
used a paired t-test to assess the effectiveness of both drugs on the P/F ratio of participants.
Results
The initial mean CRP level of Group 1 was 110.34 mg/L, which decreased to 19.45 mg/L after
administration of dexamethasone; similarly, the CRP of Group 2 was 108.65 mg/L, which
decreased to 43.82 mg/L after administering methylprednisolone for eight days. Both
dexamethasone and methylprednisolone significantly improved the P/F ratio (p<0.05), and
dexamethasone was significantly more effective than methylprednisolone (p<0.05).
Conclusion
Steroids’ ability to reduce inflammation and suppress the immune response make them an
effective tool in the treatment of COVID-19. Steroid therapy is effective in controlling
inflammation markers, and, specifically, dexamethasone is effective in improving the P/F ratio in
COVID-19 patients. Physicians should consider the use of dexamethasone use in appropriate
patients with COVID-19.

Introduction
The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory
syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) originated in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.
Although most infected patients undergo an uneventful recovery, approximately 19% of patients
experience severe pneumonia and 14% experience a progressive worsening to critical pneumonia
[1].
Patients with severe COVID-19 quickly progressed to acute respiratory failure, pulmonary
edema, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [2], which occurred not just because of
an uncontrolled viral replication but also because of an uncontrolled immune reaction from the
host. With the existence of uncontrolled viral replication, the presence of an increased number of
damaged epithelial cells and cell debris activate a massive cytokine release, also known as a
cytokine storm, with hyperinflammation and immune inhibition, characterized by decreased
memory cluster of differentiation-4 þ T helper cells and an increased cluster of differentiation-8
cytotoxic activity [3].
As a result, antiviral and anti-inflammatory treatments have become an increasing concern for
clinicians [4]. A randomized clinical study demonstrated that corticosteroid therapy could reduce
inflammatory responses, reduce treatment failure, and reduce the time to clinical stability in
community-acquired pneumonia without major adverse effects [5].
Recently, Villar et al. reported that early administration of dexamethasone shortened mechanical
ventilation time and overall mortality for patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS [6].
Corticosteroid therapy was associated with improved clinical outcomes in severe COVID-19

patients in clinical practice. Zhou et al. reported that corticosteroid therapy improved the clinical
symptoms and oxygenation of patients with COVID-19 [7].
Wang et al. also found that, for patients with severe COVID-19, corticosteroid therapy reduced
hospital length of stay and intensive care unit (ICU) stays [8]. Chinese experts considered it
prudent to administer short courses of corticosteroids at low-to-moderate doses for critically ill
patients with COVID-19 [9]. Wu et al. reported that treatment with methylprednisolone
decreased the risk of death for individuals with COVID-19 with ARDS [10].
Objective
Using steroids in moderate to severe disease is a standard practice in management of COVID19
and we have been following the same. Some cases were treated with methylprednisolone where
others were treated with equivalent doses of dexamethasone. This has automatically created a
patient pool consisting of two groups.
The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of dexamethasone and
methylprednisolone in COVID-19 patients as well as compare both drugs in regards to partial
pressure arterial oxygen and fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2 [P/F]) ratio improvement. A
significant amount of research has been published on the effectiveness of steroids in COVID-19
patients, but there is limited literature on comparing the effectiveness of dexamethasone and
methylprednisolone.
Hypothesis
We created two hypotheses: the H1 (alternate hypothesis) and the H0 (null hypothesis). The H1
hypothesis states that methylprednisolone and dexamethasone can improve the P/F ratio in

COVID-19 patients. The H0 hypothesis states that methylprednisolone and dexamethasone
cannot improve the P/F ratio in COVID-19 patients.
Materials and Methods
We used a retrospective quasi-experimental study design to assess the effectiveness of
methylprednisolone and dexamethasone in the improvement of the P/F ratio in COVID-19
patients. We used a convenient sampling technique to select files (medical record) of 60
participants, all of whom had been admitted and treated in the HDU/ICU and had been on bilevel positive airway pressure. These 60 patients (medical records) were divided into two groups:
Group 1 who had received dexamethasone, and Group 2 who had received methylprednisolone.
Each group consisted of 30 participants (medical records of 30 patients). It needs to be
reemphasized that these cases were already treated and had been concluded. They were treated
by different treating teams. One group was pro-dexamethasone who used to give dexamethasone
to their patients while other team had been favoring and used methylprednisolone in equivalent
doses to dexamethasone. Apart from the type of steroid used all other management was same for
both groups of patients including anticoagulation and we would like to declare that both groups
were on therapeutic anticoagulants. We had administered dexamethasone 8 mg twice daily to one
Group (labelled as Group 1) participants and methylprednisolone 40 mg twice daily (almost
equivalent dose to dexamethasone) to now labelled as Group 2 participants. The duration of
treatment compared was for eight days. Laboratory specimens were being sent daily during the
morning shifts to enable the treating clinicians to take decisions during their treatment periods.
We have chosen two sets laboratory values for this study one set which was taken on the first day
of hospitalization and second set from eighth day of administration of drugs, from their medical
records. Similarly for the P/F ratio comparison, we took the PaO2 values from their daily

data in descriptive form (frequencies and percentages); laboratory values were analyzed in the
form of mean, and comparison between dexamethasone and methylprednisolone effectiveness of
the P/F ratio was analyzed using a paired t-test.
Results
Our results are presented in three parts. Part I includes demographic characteristics of
participants, Part II includes outcomes of laboratory value changes in response to dexamethasone
and methylprednisolone, and Part III includes a comparison of outcomes in response to both
drugs.
Part I
Sixty patients’ medical records was selected for this study, with 30 participants in each group.
Group 1 which had received dexamethasone for eight days, and Group 2 which had received
methylprednisolone for eight days. Both groups were on therapeutic anticoagulants. In Group 1,
33.33% were women, and 66.67% were men; similarly, in the Group 2, 30% were women, and
70% were men (Figure 1). The mean age of Group 1 was 53.8 years, and the mean age of Group
2 was 53.9 years (Table 1).

The focus of this study was the evaluation of the P/F ratio in both groups after the administration
of methylprednisolone and dexamethasone. According to Table 4, the P/F ratio of Group 1 at the
initial stage was 118.20, improved to 170.41 after the administration of dexamethasone for eight
days. Both values were in the range of moderate respiratory failure, but the P/F ratio had
improved. Similarly, in Group 2, the P/F ratio at the initial stage before methylprednisolone
therapy was 105.66 and improved to 136.25 after the administration of methylprednisolone.

Part III
This section consisted of outcomes comparison after administering methylprednisolone and
dexamethasone. As mentioned previously, the main focus of this study was to assess the
effectiveness of dexamethasone and methylprednisolone on the P/F ratio. To compare the preand post-P/F ratio, we applied a paired sample t-test to check the effectiveness of both drugs.
Findings revealed that the mean P/F ratio after dexamethasone (170.4130) was significantly
higher than the mean P/F ratio before dexamethasone (118.2067; p=.000). Similarly, the P/F
ratio after methylprednisolone (136.2575) was higher than the P/F ratio before administration
methylprednisolone (105.6609) for eight days (p=.009; Table 5). As these p-values indicate,
dexamethasone improved the P/F ratio significantly more than methylprednisolone.
The H1 alternate hypothesis (methylprednisolone and dexamethasone are effective in improving
P/F ratio in COVID-19 patients) can be accepted, and the H0 null hypothesis
(methylprednisolone and dexamethasone could not improve the P/F ratio in COVID-19 patients)
can be rejected on the basis of the paired t-test.

Discussion
The mean age of patients in this study was 53.3 years, and most patients (66.67%) were men, and
33.33% were women. Spagnuolo et al. showed that the median age of participants was 63.5 years
(53.5 to 74.0 years), and 34% of patients were older than 70 years [11].
We found that corticosteroids reduced CRP levels. A similar study conducted in 2005 indicated
that the withdrawal of inhaled corticosteroids increased serum CRP levels. The reintroduction of
the inhaled steroids suppressed the CRP levels. Hence, corticosteroids can reduce serum CRP
and other circulating inflammatory cytokine levels in some acute inflammatory states [12].
In the present study, the initial mean serum ferritin in both drug groups were reduced after eight
days. A study conducted on Mycoplasma pneumoniae in November 2015 elaborated that ferritin
levels may be useful as indicators of the severity of pneumonia for initiation of corticosteroid
therapy [13].
The findings of the present study revealed that both dexamethasone and methylprednisolone
were effective in improving the P/F ratio. Spagnuolo et al. assessed the effectiveness of steroids
in COVID-19 patients, where differences between patients taking steroids and patients not taking
steroids were observed [11]. A remarkable improvement in P/F ratio was observed. The
proportion of patients with a baseline PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 200 mmHg was 45.8% for patients taking
steroids compared to 34.4% in patients not taking steroids (p=0.023). The proportion of patients
with a baseline PaO2/FiO2 ≤100 mmHg was 16.9% for patients taking steroids compared to
12.7% who were not taking steroids (p=0.027). Steroid use also decreased the length of
hospitalization (20 vs. 14 days; p<0.001) [11].

There were certain limitations of the present study. We did not include a control group, did not
assess any underlying comorbidities, and did not compare the effectiveness of steroid therapy in
regard to age, sex, and severity of illness. Randomized controlled clinical trials are required to
confirm the effectiveness and safety of corticosteroid therapy and to further study the long-term
outcomes after discharge with a large sample size for better generalization of findings.
Conclusion
Steroids have long been known to reduce inflammation and suppress immune reactions. These
actions make steroids an effective tool in the treatment of COVID-19, and they have become a
standard of treatment all over the world. Dexamethasone is more effective in improving the P/F
ratio in COVID-19 patients compared to methylprednisolone. Physicians should consider the use
of dexamethasone use in appropriate patients with COVID-19.
