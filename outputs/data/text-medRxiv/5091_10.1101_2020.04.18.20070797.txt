MATHEMATICAL MODELING FOR TRANSMISSIBILITY OF
COVID-19 VIA MOTORCYCLES
BENARD OKELO
Abstract. In this paper, we present a mathematical model of trigonometric
type for transmissibility and deaths as a result of COVID-19. In the model, we
analyze the spread of COVID-19 by considering a new parameter, the motorcycle as a means of public transport, which has not been considered in several
other models for COVID-19. We use the mathematical model to predict the
spread and deaths and we suggest strategies that can be put in place to prevent
the spread caused by motorcycle as a means of public transport.

Keywords: Mathematical model, COVID-19, Motorcycle.
1. Introduction
The outbreak of COVID-19 was detected in December 2019 in mainland China
with the city of Wuhan as the recognized epicenter(see [1]-[29] and the references
therein). COVID-19 has since then been exported to other countries all over the
world[7]. To describe and determine the dynamics of COVID-19, several mathematical models have been constructed by several researchers[2]-[6]. We realize
that the insights that can be drawn from these models are discussed, especially as
inputs for designing strategies to control the epidemics. Proposed model-based
strategies on how to prevent the spread of the disease in local setting, such as
during large social gatherings, are also discussed in details[8]-[13]. One of the
parameters considered in most of the models is the exposure time which is an instrumental factor in spreading the disease[14]. With a basic reproduction number
equal to 2, and 14-day infectious period, an infected person staying more than 9
hours in the event could infect other people [15]. As at now, there is an urgent
need to develop a mathematical model to estimate the transmissibility and dynamic of the transmission of the virus[16]-[19]. Several researches [17], [18], [21],
[22], [22] and [25] have focused on calculating the basic reproduction number R0
by using the serial intervals and intrinsic growth rate or using ordinary diﬀerential
equations and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods[23] and [24]. A lot of these
researches have certain similar characteristics: They show that social distancing
can signiﬁcantly slow down the spread of the COVID-19; They stipulated that
the eﬀectiveness depends very much on the initial and boundary conditions of
social distancing and the results strongly vary by orders of magnitude if the process is initiated a few days earlier or later or the eﬀectiveness of the measure is
only slightly higher or lower; The details of the studies are diﬃcult to understand
for many readers and therefore a widespread trust on the eﬃciency on the actual
measures regarding the COVID-19 pandemic can not easily be derived from scientiﬁc literature. Results from [26] show that the eﬀectiveness of social distancing

is particularly great for pandemic with a basic reproductive number of R0 = 1.5
- 2.5. For the COVID-19 pandemic, a basic reproduction number R0 = 2.6 is
estimated, with an uncertainty range from 1.5 to 3.5 as seen in [27]. R0 speciﬁes
how many new cases are caused by an existing case on average. With R0 ¿ 1, the
virus spreads exponentially at times, but for R0 ¡1 the spread stops on its own
[30]. A large number of studies have now calculated the number of basic reproductions, the incubation period and the duration of the infectiousness based on
the number of cases from China [30]. However, the transmission through use of
motorcycles as a means of public transport particularly in developing economies
have not considered in the published models. The COVID-19 therefore is still a
world pandemic and is currently a challenge for several countries all over the the
world but worse for the developing countries. The goal of this paper is to present
a mathematical model of trigonometric form for the spread of the COVID-19,
where we concentrate on a new parameter called the use of motorcycles as a
means of public transport to predict spread and number of deaths due to the
COVID-19.

2. Materials and methods
The reported cases of COVID-19, were collected for the modelling study from
the World Health Organization oﬃcial website. The epidemic curve from a sample of 30 days is presented. Simulation methods and statistical analysis was done
using MATLAB version 9.7. The fourth-order RungeKutta method, with tolerance set at 0.001, was used to perform curve ﬁtting. Selected preliminary models
of COVID-19, published in oﬃcial webpages of academic/research institutions,
as preprints, or as journal articles since the outbreak are reviewed. Important
insights from the results of these models are discussed. Moreover, a model using
a Susceptible-Exposed-Infected (SEI) framework is has been carefully reviewed
to propose measures to prevent epidemics during large events, e.g., during parties
or concerts with huge crowds. The parameter values used in this model are based
on the known information about COVID-19. The model is represented by a system of instantaneous and noninstantaneous diﬀerential equations, and simulated
using MATLAB version 9.7. The Diﬀerential equations are then reduced into a
trigonometric form and later analysed. Motorcycles are used in most developing
countries for public transport. In Kenya, they are called ”Boda Boda”, while in
Nigeria they are commonly known as ”Okada.” Most people in the cities, towns
and even in rural areas prefer motorcycle because they are faster, relatively cheap
and can be used to avoid traﬃc jam in roads. Despite their usefulness, motorcycles contributes immensely to the spread of COVID-19 because the operators do
not follow the traﬃc rules. For instance, they don’t put masks and helmets, they
carry excess passengers, they don’t wash their hands as required. Hence, social
distancing is not taken care of. Due to these factors, we study the transmissibility
of COVID-19 as a result of the risk factors from the motorcycle operators.

MATHEMATICAL MODEL FOR COVID-19

3. Derivation of the mathematical model
We consider the use of motorcycles as a parameter presented in form of diﬀerential equations with instantaneous impulses and we compare it with the case of
noninstantaneous impulses.
Case I. Instantaneous impulses. Let an increasing sequence of points {ti }p+1
i=1
be given such that 0 ≤ ti < ti+1 , i = 1, 2, . . . , p, limk→∞ tk = ∞ Let t0 ∈ Rn be
a given arbitrary point. Without loss of generality we assume that t0 ∈ [0, t1 ) .
Consider the Initial Value Problem (IVP) for the nonlinear Instantaneous Impulsive Diﬀerential equation (IDE)
x′ = f (t, x) f or t =
̸ tk k = 1, 2, . . .
x (tk+1 ) = x (tk ) + Ik (x (tk − 0))

f or k = 1, 2, . . .

(3.1)

x (t0 ) = x0 ,
where x, x0 ∈ Rn , f : [t0 , ∞) × Rn → Rn , Ik : Rn → Rn , (k = 1, 2, 3, . . .). The
points tk , k = 1, 2, . . . are called points of instantaneous impulses and the functions Ik (x), k = 1, 2, . . . are called instantaneous impulsive functions. The solution x (t; t0 , x0 ) in the general case is a piecewise continuous function which is
satisfying the integral equation
∫

x (t; t0 , x0 ) = x0 +

f (s, x (s; t0 , x0 )) ds +
t0

∑

Ii (x (ti ; t0 , x0 ))

(3.2)

i:t0 <ti <t

Case II. Noninstantaneous impulses. Let two increasing ﬁnite sequences
p
of points {ti }p+1
i=1 and {si }i=0 be given such that s0 = 0 < ti ≤ si < ti+1 , i =
1, 2, 3, ..., p and points t0 , T ∈ R+ are given such that s0 = 0 < t0 < t1 , tp < T ≤
tp+1 , p is a natural number. Consider the Initial Value Problem(IVP) for the
nonlinear Noninstantaneous Impulsive Diﬀerential Equation(NIDE)
x′ = fk (t, x) f or t ∈ (sk , tk+1 ] ∩ [t0 , T ], k = 0, 1, . . . , p
x(t) = ϕk (t, x(t), x(tk − 0)) f or k = 1, 2, . . .

(3.3)

x(t0 ) = x0
where x, x0 ∈ R, fk : [sk , tk+1 ] ∩ [t0 , T ] × R → R, k = 0, 1, 2, . . . , p, ϕk : [tk , sk ] ×
R × R → R, k = 1, 2, 3, . . . The intervals (sk , tk+1 ], k = 1, 2, . . . are called intervals of noninstantaneous impulse and the function ϕk (t, x, y), k = 1, 2, ..., are
called noninstantaneous impulsive function. In the special case sk = tk+1 , k =
0, 1, 2, . . . each interval of noninstantaneous impulses is reduced to a point, and
the problem in Equation 3.3 is reduced to an IVP for an IDE in Equation 3.1
with points of impulses tk and impulsive functions x (tk + 0) = Ik (x (tk − 0)) ≡
ϕk (tk , x (tk − 0) , x (tk − 0)) − x (tk − 0) Let k ≥ 0 be a given integer, τ ∈ [tk , sk )
be a given point and consider the corresponding IVP for ODE
x′ = f (t, x) for t ∈ [τ, sk ] with x(τ ) = x̃0 , where x̃0 ∈ Rn .

Case II.2 . If there exists a natural number k : ak = 0, then the solution of
Equation 3.11 is zero for t > tk , i.e., all solutions in spite of the initial value x0
coincide for t > tk .
Case II.3 . If ak = e−k , tk = k, k = 1, 2, . . . , then the solution of the problem
in Equation 3.11 is x(t) = x0 et−k for t ∈ (k, k + 1] and the solution is a periodic
function.
Case II.4 . If ak = e−2k , tk = k, k = 1, 2, . . . , then the solution of the problem
in Equation 3.11 is x(t) = x0 et−2k for t ∈ (k, k + 1] and the solution being a
piecewise continuous function approaches 0.
Case II.5. If ak = e−2k , tk = k, k = 1, 2, . . . , then the solution of the problem

It can be shown that a Lyapunov function V (x, y) for the Equation 3.15 is given
by

and the origin (0, 0) is a stable equilibrium point of the system of diﬀerential
Equation 3.15. In fact Equation 3.14 is but a particular case of Equation 3.15.
One easily deduces that though the origin (0, 0) is stable, it is not asymptotically
stable.
Data was collected over 30 days with regard to positivity indices from COVID19 cases and questions were asked from the respondents with regard to use of
motorcycles a public means of transport in diﬀerent countries all over the world.

Figure 2. The curve of COVID-19 transmissibility over thirty day
period through motorcycle operations.
The curve in Figure 2 shows that the COVID-19 is spread through the use of
motorcycle and the rate of infection is continuous. The curve reaches the peak
but the rate of reduction in terms of death and infections is not rapid. Therefore,
the pandemic might take longer than expected for it to be contained and to be
declared not to be a pandemic anymore.
4. Conclusion
The results from this study is in agreement with the recommendation of World
Health Organization [22] that it is still possible to interrupt virus spread, provided
that countries put in place strong measures to detect disease early, for example,
development of rapid diagnostic tests, and increasing eﬀectiveness of passenger
screening in airports in which thermal screening for COVID-19 infection is estimated using simulation to be 46 percent. Moreover, motorcycle operators are not
indispensable when it comes to observing recommendation of World Health Organization and therefore if they adhere strictly to these recommendations, there
will be a tremendous decrease in new infections and consequently reduces deaths
due to COVID-19.
