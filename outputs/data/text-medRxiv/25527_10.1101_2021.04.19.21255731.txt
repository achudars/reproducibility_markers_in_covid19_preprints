Abstract. In this work we analyze the effectiveness of vaccination strategies for the COVID-19 epidemic in the Brazilian state of
Minas Gerais. Firstly we study the effectiveness of general vaccination in the decreasing of the number of infected individuals using
a traditional non structured SEIR model. Secondly we consider
an age-structured SEIR model with 3 age groups (youngster, adult
and elderly) and we analyze the current strategy in the Brazilian
state of Minas Gerais, of focusing the vaccination on the elderly
group. We conclude by showing this strategy to be mistaken and
that a vaccination focusing on the age group of the adults would
be much more efficient in decreasing the total number of infected
individuals.

1. Introduction
Several cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology were detected in
the Chinese city of Wuhan around the end of 2019. The World Health
Organization 1was informed and reported that a novel corona virus (officially named COVID-19) was identified on January 7th as the possible
cause of such infections. An international alert was issued by WHO because of the imminent potential for the spreading of such an infectious
disease worldwide. The disease quickly spread in all countries of the
world with several different degrees of seriousness causing the WHO

to declare it a pandemic on March 11th , due to the seriousness of the
situation.
Although the WHO has constantly advised the international community for the need of social isolation and massive testing many countries, among which notably Brazil, have not taken the advices seriously
enough and the number of infected individuals in the world has reached
the incredible mark of 121, 164, 126 causing 2, 679, 841 deaths, leaving
97, 661, 975 recovered cases and 20, 822, 310 active cases by March 16th
a little bit over an year after the outbreak, according to the site Worldometers (see [16]).
Brazil has around 2.72% of the world population and yet has officially
11, 594, 204 cases of infected individuals which adds up to 9.57% of the
total cases of the whole world. The official number of deaths in Brazil
due to COVID-19 is 281, 626, indicating a lethality rate of around 2.43%
while the world average lethality rate is around 2.21%. So Brazilian
lethality rate is about 10% higher than the world average rate. Many
reasons could be credited to such horrifying number from Brazil but in
one word one can say the main cause of such a huge number of lives lost
for COVID-19 was the Brazilian Government approach to the sanity
crisis.
The Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, geographically located at the
central part of Brazil with important and populous neighbor states
as Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo has a dense web of road routes as
well as an important aerial hub connecting several parts of the whole
country. Minas Gerais has around 10% of the Brazilian population and
a rich diversity of races, cultures, ages, genders and economic income
distribution. All these reasons justifying us considering an analysis of
the development of the spreading of the epidemic in the state of Minas
Gerais as a good lab for the development of the disease nationwide.
After a very intensive effort of the international scientific community,
the first samples of vaccines were presented to the world around the
end of November of 2019. On January 20t h Brazil started it vaccination program yet at a very low rate of around 200, 000 individuals/day.
The state of Minas Gerais started the vaccination program on January 25th at an approximate rate of 20, 000 individuals/day. As it has
being happening worldwide the elderly have been prioritized (besides
the health agents) in this first stage of the vaccination program due to
their clear vulnerability.
There are several forms of control measures that work by reducing
the average amount of transmission between infectious and susceptible
individuals. Which control strategies, and/or mix of strategies, are
used will depend on the disease, hosts, and size of the epidemic [9]. One

such tactic is continuous vaccination (permanent vaccination), another
one is ”pulse vaccination”, where instead of constantly vaccinating an
extremely large proportion of all susceptible individuals, it is proposed
to vaccinate a fraction of the entire susceptible population in a single
pulse, which should be administered every T periods of time [13]. The
importance of the use of vaccination, either continuous or pulse, as a
means of protection against many diseases can be grounded on two
counts: - The decrease in new cases of infectious diseases directly and
indirectly, that is, both for those who have been vaccinated and for
those who have not yet been. (This indirect protection produces an
increase in the epidemic interval and therefore an increase also in the
average age of infection.) - The low cost of the vaccine compared
to treating the disease or not treating it at all. Theoretical results
show that the ”pulse vaccination” strategy can distinguish conventional
leading strategies for disease eradication at relatively low vaccination
values [1]. In contrast, conventional vaccination strategies are predicted
to lead to epidemic control if the proportion of successfully vaccinated
individuals is greater than a certain critical value.
The goal of this study is to assess through the analysis of different
vaccination strategies the best one for the state of Minas Gerais. The
reason behind our argument is that, assuming that the vaccination
helps decreasing the rate of transmissibility of the disease, we claim
that vaccination of elderly people, which are relatively socially isolated,
will basically protect only the own vaccinated individual meanwhile
vaccination of adults (or even youngster) would protect not only the
vaccinated individual but several other individuals which are socially
related to the vaccinated one leading to a quicker decrease in the total
number of infected individuals.
We point out that even though Minas Gerais is considered for the
scope of this paper, the techniques and tools used in this study can be
easily adapted for any other city, state or country in the world. We
point out that a more strict assess involving the strategies of vaccination of youngsters was neglected in this paper because most of the
vaccines currently available in the world have not yet been tested in
such an age group, thus practically no countries in the world are vaccinating individuals younger than 18 years old.
The paper is organized as follows: In section 2, the classical SEIR
model with vaccination is presented. Based on the public official available data of the number of infected individuals we perform a fitting of
the parameters and compare the curve of infected individuals given by
the fitted model to the real number of cases. We further study the effectiveness of vaccination in the decreasing of total number of infected

individuals using the classical SEIR model. In section 3, the age structured SEIR model with vaccination is presented. Due to the fact that
the beginning of the vaccination program in Minas Gerais happened on
January 25th , 2021 we have chosen to study the model considering the
initial conditions to be the ones related to January 1st of 2021. In section 4, after the parametric fitting for the age structured SEIR model
is done, we use such a model to project the total number of infected
individuals considering different strategies of vaccination depending on
the parameters ν1 , ν2 and ν3 which represent the rates of vaccination
in the 3 analyzed age groups. The conclusion is presented in section 5.

2. The Classical SEIR model
The classical SEIR model with vaccination and without vital dynamics is given by

S 0 (t) = −β S(t) I(t) − ν S(t) ,
(2.1)

E 0 (t) = β S(t) I(t) − σ E(t) ,
I 0 (t) = σ E(t) − γ I(t) ,
R 0 (t) = γ I(t) + ν S(t) .

The above parameters are all non-negative, β represents the transmission rate, σ is the rate at which exposed individuals become infected, γ is the recovery rate and ν represents the rate of vaccination.
As we have already mentioned we shall consider the development
of the epidemic from day one (i.e., January 1st , 2021) on. For this
we consider the total number of infected individuals in Minas Gerais
546, 884 (see [12]). The parameters β, σ and γ can be adjusted so that
the SEIR curve fits well the real data. To achieve that, the difference
between the SEIR curve and the real data values for the number of
infected individuals is minimized using a least square minimizing algorithm from an inner routine in software Mathematica (see [11] for
algorithm description). This set of parameters is used in section 3 to
adjust the age-structured model 3.1. The values for the parameters
were found to be

β = 1.98321, σ = 0.00242574, γ = 0.00366076, ν = 0.216118.
The initial conditions used for the algorithm were β ∗ = 0.8481 ,
σ ∗ = 0.2682 , γ ∗ = 0.0870, which were obtained from the national case
(see [3]).

Figure 1. The fitted curve for the total number of infected individuals for the classical SEIR model together
with the real data.
The effect of the vaccination on the prevalence curve, I(t), is twofold:
it decreases the maximum value of it but it anticipates the date of its
occurrence, see figure 2.
This reasoning could lead us to ask “how much earlier is the Public
Health System of Minas Gerais (PHS-MG) able to deal with such a
maximum of the number of infected cases ?” In fact we need not to
worry about this question because we observe that, the summit reached
with the vaccination strategy going on, is lower than the corresponding
value for the number of infected individual if no vaccination was taking
place. Yet we want the PHS-MG to be able to deal with such a high
number of infected individual in need of intensive care units (ICU).
According to the its health department (see [5]) the state of Minas
Gerais has 4, 199 ICU beds in the PHS-MG, so that 3, 360 corresponds
to 80% of this total and we shall analyze what should be the vaccination
effort, ν necessary to keep the level of occupation of such beds below

this number. According to BBC web site (see [2]) between 5% to 15%
of the total number of infected individuals needs intensive hospital care.
This implies that the maximum number of simultaneously infected individuals in Minas Gerais should be between 22, 400 and 67, 200. The
average period of hospitalizations is accounted to be around 15 days.
So, we consider the function inf (ν, t) and rem(ν, t) representing the
total number of infected individuals and the total number of removed
(causalities+recoveries) individuals respectively, numerically obtained
from the system of differential equations given by (2.1) and we construct the auxiliary function of simultaneously infected individuals as
sick(ν, t) = inf (ν, t) − rem(ν, t) − (inf (ν, t − 15) − rem(ν, t − 15)) the
graphic of which, for several values of the vaccination parameter, ν, is
presented in figure 3 together with the maximum accepted numbers of
simultaneously infected individuals L1 = 22, 400 and L2 = 67, 200.

This result indicates that even if we drastically increase the current rate of number of vaccinated individuals per day from 75, 000 to
1, 500, 000 the number of individuals simultaneously in need of an ICU
bed would be below 80% of the full capacity of the PHS-MG around
90 days (or 120 days in the worst scenario) after the effects of the
vaccination has begun.

3. The Age-structured SEIR model
Since age is an important factor on the COVID-19 epidemic, it will
be assumed that the population is age structured (see [6], [14], [4] for
continuous models and [10], [15] for discrete models). Three age classes
are used; i = 1 : infants with ages in the interval [0, 17], i = 2 : adults
with ages in the interval [18, 59], and i = 3 : elderly with ages in the
interval [60, 110].
Let Si (t), Ei (t), Ii (t), Ri (t) represent the number of susceptible ,
exposed, infected and removed individuals at age class i respectively
at time t ≥ 0 measured in days. The system of ordinary differential
equation we wish to analyze is

The parameters are all non-negative and they are described in Table 1. Typically, it will be assumed that βij = βji .
The total population of the state of Minas Gerais is of 21, 204, 000
inhabitants at the end of 2019 and the age distribution is given in table
(2), (see [8])
According to the daily epidemiological bulletin of the health department of January 1st , 2021 Minas Gerais has had 546, 884 confirmed
cases of COVID-19 and a total number of 12, 001 deaths officially
caused by the disease featuring a lethality rate of η = 2.2%.
According to [8] Minas Gerais had 258, 665 births and 141, 451 deaths
in 2019, featuring a net increase of 0.55% by the end of 2019. We
assume the casualties caused by Covid are totally atypical so we estimate the total population of Minas Gerais at the end of 2020 to be
1.0055 × 21, 204, 000 − 12001 = 21, 308, 621. According to health department of the State of Minas Gerais (see [8]) on January 1st , 2021

As already mentioned, we analyze the development of the epidemic
from January 1th , 2021 onwards, therefore, by allusion to the usual
situation, we shall call it the “steady state”. We denote by Si∗ =
ci S0 , Ei∗ = ci E0 , Ii∗ = ci I0 , Ri∗ = ci R0 and at the steady state we
have
(3.2)

S1∗ = 5.20937 ∗ 106 , S2∗ = 1.16235 ∗ 107 , S3∗ = 3.38194 ∗ 106 ,

equilibrium, using the values for the population distribution at the
equilibrium values, one must have

Before we proceed, we need to adjust the parameters for the age

does have an impact on the level of transmissibility of the virus. This
is a reasonable supposition not yet proved but taken for granted in this
study.

The algorithm fits these parameters to the available data of Minas
Gerais’s total number of reported cases for the number of infected individuals of the 15 first days of 2021 by a least squares method. The
distance between the predicted curve
I(t) = I1 (t) + I2 (t) + I3 (t)
and the data curve is minimized. The initial parameters for the minimization search algorithm are the ones found for the classical (unstructured) SEIR model (2.1) taking into consideration the population percentage of each age class. Let ci be the population percentage of each
class, that is (see Table 2), c1 = 0.2249, c2 = 0.6022 and c3 = 0.1729.

The control measures for the age structured model with vaccination will be done through a numerical analysis of the total number of

our numerical simulations of such a possible vaccination strategy for it
could be shown to be useful in the future.
Firstly we compare the strategy of vaccination involving only the
youngster and the adults. In Figure 4 (left) we show the total number
of infected individuals when the full effort of vaccination is put on vaccinating either only the youngster or only the adults. We clearly see
that the strategy of focusing the vaccination totally on the youngsters
does not produce a high decrease in the total number of infected individuals as the strategy of focusing the vaccination totally on the adults.
Similarly in Figure 4 (right) we show the total number of infected individuals when the full effort of vaccination is put on vaccinating either
only the youngster or only the elderly. We clearly see that the strategy
of focusing the vaccination totally on the youngsters does not produce
a high decrease in the total number of infected individuals as the strategy of focusing the vaccination totally on the elderly. Clearly a deeper
study would be necessary to really determine whether another choice
of strategy involving the youngster could produce higher decrease in
the total number of infected individuals. We prefer to let this analysis
for a future study and proceed here with a focus on the comparison
between vaccination strategies involving only the age groups of adults
and elderly.
The immunization strategy used in the state of Minas Gerais follows
the national plan of focusing the vaccination on the more vulnerable
people which, due to its high lethality rate, clearly is the age group
of elderly. We study here whether this strategy is really a good one.
Minas Gerais started vaccinating its population on January 25th . Due
to the lack of sufficient quantities of vaccine doses by April 9th only
around 10% of the population of Minas Gerais had been vaccinated
and the great majority of it were the elderly (the government vaccination policy prioritizes the elderly and the health agents working on

the front lines). By April 9th around 70, 000 people/day were being
vaccinated. We analyze the total number of infected individuals in Minas Gerais in all possible ways of distributing the daily 70, 000 doses of
vaccines among adult and elderly individuals only. In order to do that
we consider a function, F , of the total number of infected individual
of ages groups 2 (adults) and 3 (elderly) at time t considering a daily
rate of vaccination νi for the age class group i. So we have F (t, ν2 , ν3 )
and then we consider the daily rate (of beginning of April) of individuals been vaccinated in Minas Gerais to be V max = 70, 000. We
have analyzed the function F (t, rV max, (1 − r)V max) for all values of
t ∈ [0, 60] and r ∈ [0, 1] which clearly represents the effects over the
total number of infected individuals during 60 days after the vaccines
start to work and considering all the possible ways of distributing the
vaccines among adults and elderly. Because the values of function F
are very big and its variation is very small, in order to have a better visualization of the results, we prefer to shows the graphic of an auxiliary
function: G(t, r) = Exp(F (t, rV max, (1−r)V max)/106 ) together with
the graphic of the plane z = 3.5 in such a way that we can more clearly
see that the minimum does occurs at r = 1 (see figure (5)). Figure (6)
shows the graphics of G when r = 0, r = 0.25, r = 0.5, r = 0.75 and
when r = 1. We can clearly see that at a short time interval (20 days
after the effects of the vaccines begin to work) the minimum number of
infected individuals is obtained when r = 1, that is to say when all the
vaccination effort is put on the age group of the adults. For a longer
time interval the graphics point out that the minimum occurs when
r = 0.

5. Conclusions
We have introduced an age structured SEIR model with vaccination.
Three age groups were considered: infants (0 to 17 years), adults (18
to 59 years) and elderly (60 to 110 years). Firstly we studied the associated classical (unstructured) SEIR model without vital dynamics.
The parameters were fitted by a least-square algorithm and the impact
of the vaccination parameter ν was studied. As we expected the maximum number of infected individuals decreases as the vaccination rate
increases. Also it was observed that the maximum number of infected
cases happens earlier than if no vaccination were done, yet such a pick
is still smaller than the corresponding value of the number of infected
individuals of the non vaccination situation which clearly justifies the
strategy of vaccination at any rate.

However it has also been shown that at the current rate of vaccination or even if such rate is multiplied by 20, vaccination procedures
alone are not enough to keep the number of seriously ill hospitalized
individuals below 80% of the public health system full capacity. Thus,
this study clearly indicates that the need of strict rules of social distancing, frequent hands washing and other similar measures of avoiding
crowdedness should be implemented and stimulated by the local governments.
Furthermore, in order to analyze different vaccination strategies the
parameters obtained for the unstructured SEIR model were used to
adjust the parameters for the age-structured SEIR model with vaccination. We compared vaccination strategies involving only adults and

elderly for this case is closer to the present reality since at the moment non of the vaccines under use in the world has been completely
tested on youngsters. We postpone to future works the studying of different strategies of vaccination involving youngsters. Using this data,
we analyzed the possible strategy of vaccinating rV max adults and
(1 − r)V max elderly, letting r ∈ [0, 1]. We have numerically computed
the total number of infected individuals and have shown that the strategy with r = 1 produces the best results. The final conclusion is that
in order to minimize the number of infected individuals the current
strategy of vaccination with total focus on the elderly (r = 0) has to
be radically changed to a vaccination strategy with total focusing on
the adults, i.e. only adults should be vaccinated (at least at the first
20 days) if the current rate of V max = 70, 000 individuals per day is
maintained.
