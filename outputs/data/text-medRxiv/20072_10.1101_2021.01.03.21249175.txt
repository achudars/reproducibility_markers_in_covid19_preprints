Abstract— The COVID-19 pandemic has been
particularly threatening to the patients with end-stage
kidney disease (ESKD) on intermittent hemodialysis and
their care providers. Hemodialysis patients who receive
life-sustaining medical therapy in healthcare settings, face
unique challenges as they need to be at a dialysis unit
three or more times a week, where they are confined to
specific settings and tended to by dialysis nurses and
staff with physical interaction and in close proximity.
Despite the importance and critical situation of the
dialysis units, modelling studies of the SARS-CoV-2
spread in these settings are very limited. In this paper, we
have used a combination of discrete event and agentbased simulation models, to study the operations of a
typical large dialysis unit and generate contact matrices to
examine outbreak scenarios. We present the details of the
contact matrix generation process and demonstrate how
the simulation calculates a micro-scale contact matrix
comprising the number and duration of contacts at a
micro-scale time step. We have used the contacts matrix
in an agent-based model to predict disease transmission
under different scenarios. The results show that microsimulation can be used to estimate contact matrices,
which can be used effectively for disease modelling in
dialysis and similar settings.

I. Introduction

T

he COVID-19 pandemic has had a massive impact on all
facets of public health. As a disease, it is particularly
threatening to patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD)
on intermittent hemodialysis and their care providers. Full
compliance with mitigation strategies for reducing infection
spread, such as physical distancing and avoidance of highdensity areas including healthcare facilities is usually not
feasible. Patients with ESKD who receive in-centre
hemodialysis, face unique challenges. They are obligated to be
at a dialysis unit three or more times a week, where they are
confined to specific seating and tended to by dialysis nurses at
close proximity. Dialysis patients are already at higher risk of
experiencing more severe manifestations of disease due to
their poor functional immune status and their increased burden
of co-morbidities [1]. Furthermore, ESKD patients who have
not been tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 are not able to
effectively quarantine and must travel to the hospital for their
regular treatments, often using public transportation [2], hence
increasing the risk of viral spread to the population at large,
and more specifically to the dialysis unit staff. Not
surprisingly, the first COVID-19 associated death in the
United States was a hemodialysis patient at the Northwest
Kidney Center in the State of Washington [3].
Many in-centre dialysis facilities have experienced
outbreaks among dialysis patients, physicians, and nursing
staff leading to nursing and physician shortages in an already
overburdened healthcare system [4]. These outbreaks have
downstream effects throughout the healthcare centres in which
they are based. Therefore, several proposals have been put
forward to reduce the risk of infectious spread in dialysis units
during the COVID-19 pandemic.
It is important to understand the potential impact of an
outbreak and the pathways through which the virus can
propagate in the dialysis unit environment. Currently, only a
limited number of modelling studies of the SARS-CoV-2
spread and containment in hospital settings, particularly
hemodialysis units are available. This study aims to fill this
gap by using a combination of discrete event and agent-based
simulation to model the operations of a large Canadian
dialysis setting in Toronto and the impacts of the infection and
infection protection measures.

II. BACKGROUND
The maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) population is highly
susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 and at the same time,
there is a high risk of outbreaks of COVID-19 in MHD centres
[5]. MHD patients are at increased risk of COVID-19 and its
complications because they tend to be older and have multiple
comorbidities including hypertension and suppressed immune
systems [5]. Hemodialysis patients attend dialysis facilities
several times a week each time spending between 3 to 5 hours
for their treatment [6]. Home-based dialysis has a clear
advantage during a pandemic as patients do not need to travel
and maintain physical distancing. The need for frequent trips
to dialysis units and unavoidable patient clustering during
dialysis shifts, further increase the risk of viral transmission
[7]. Transportation to dialysis centres may require interactions
with transportation personnel and other passengers in the
public transit systems. In addition, MHD unit daily operations
incorporate several patient-to-patient and patient-to-caregiver
operations that increase the risk of COVID-19 transmission.
This is because synchronous schedules of dialysis that have
patients entering and exiting the department at the same time,
as well as close contacts with healthcare workers that have a
similar type of interaction with other patients. Moreover,
because of the unique characteristics of MHD patients and
MHD units, it is more difficult to prevent and control
infectious diseases in these settings compared to imposing
control measures for the general population and in other
settings [8].
Early reports from Canadian healthcare facilities also
confirms that MHD patients are highly susceptible to COVID19 infections and vulnerable to their severe consequences.
According to the Canadian Institute for Health Information
[9], about 620 MHD COVID-19 positive patients (excluding
Quebec) were hospitalized in Canada from January to March
2020 (Table I). Currently, all MHD with suspected or
conﬁrmed COVID-19 infections are being triaged to hospitals
[10].
Table I. COVID-19 hospitalizations of dialysis patients (including
intensive care unit admissions) and associated characteristics in
Ontario and Canada (January to March 2020)

As such, the COVID-19 pandemic presents a particular
challenge to MHD patients and in-centre units in hospitals as
the risk of transmission to the medical staff, facility workers,
patients, and family members is considerably higher [11].
While previous studies have examined the impacts of disasters
such as earthquakes, ﬂoods, and hurricanes on dialysis units
and their service clients and patients [12], studies on the
impacts of a global pandemic are very limited. In this section,

we will review the status quo, current challenges and
concerns, and emerging solutions and recommendations for
the SARD-Cov-2 outbreak in MHD units.
A. COVID-19 and hemodialysis patients and dialysis
units
Near 14.5 million people are living with ESKD globally
[13]. Most of these individuals (more than 95%) dialyze in
specialized facilities [6]. Compared to the general public,
dialysis patients are at short-term mortality of 20% or higher
with COVID-19 [14]. According to the Canadian Institute for
Health Information [15], 40,289 Canadians (excluding
Quebec) were living with ESKD at the end of 2018. In Ontario
alone, there are about 13,330 chronic dialysis patients [16]. In
Canada, MHD is provided by not-for-profit Renal Programs in
large academic in-centre hemodialysis associated with medical
schools and community hospitals [17]. Ontario has 27 Renal
Programs treating MHD patients and delivers HD at
approximately 100 sites [16]. Many personnel in hemodialysis
facilities are also involved in providing dialysis services that
should not be halted even during a pandemic.
Infection rates in dialysis centres are twice of in-home
dialysis patients [14]. Only a small portion of the MHD
patients (ranging between 1 to 5 %) fall under the category of
home-based dialysis [18]. The expansion of home-based
dialysis is now a public health discussion. Since implementing
some of the basic control measures may not be feasible in
dialysis units and considering the lower risk of COVID-19
exposure in home-based dialysis, initiatives such as the ESKD
Prospective Payment System and the Executive Order on
Advancing American Kidney Health are underway in some
countries to reform the existing dialysis services from centrebased to home-based services to reduce the risks.
In earlier phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, not all
hemodialysis facilities had not adapted their workflow
processes to the situation. Some dialysis facilities did not have
testing capabilities and thus, before the infected people were
identified, several others (patients and staff) were already
infected [19]. Limited studies in different parts of the world
such as Wuhan, China [6], United Kingdom and Ontario,
Canada, and France [20] show the infectious rate of COVID19 amongst MHD had been somewhere from 1% to 16.1%.
Mortality rates in MHD patients with COVID may be as high
as 20% [14]. Additionally, a significant number of dialysis
patients live in long-term care facilities [21]. Liu, Ghai,
Waikar and Weiner [19] examined the prevalence of COVID19 infection at two dialysis centres and found that patients
who lived in long-term care facilities suffered from much
higher infection rates of 37% and 88%.
B. COVID-19 challenges for dialysis centres
An outbreak in hemodialysis centres can cause staff
shortages and thus, puts a strain on health professionals and
technicians that run these facilities [22]. This can lead to
increased waiting time for dialysis and more exposure, or
otherwise, patients who skip their dialysis shifts due to fear
from the pandemic, putting them at risk of fluid overload and
metabolic emergencies [23]. One study in a hospital in Madrid
found that 20% of the healthcare staff in the Nephrology
department were diagnosed with COVID-19 [1]. Resource

scarcity is compounded by a general shortage of medical
equipment, and PPEs during a pandemic [6]. Therefore, the
protection of staff working in dialysis units is very important.
The ability of a dialysis centre to provide effective physical
distancing for all its members is constrained by several factors
including the physical layout of the unit which cannot be
reconfigured without a major overhaul [19]. Space is limited,
and there is little flexibility in the scheduling to allow the
following special precautions for cohorting COVID-19
infected patients. Most dialysis units operate at maximum
capacity. The nature of care for these patients require close
proximity to nurses operating with the HD machine. These
nurses may interact with 3 or 4 patients simultaneously.
Although contacts with healthcare providers can be limited, it
cannot be eliminated. Asymptomatic spread in the HD unit is
another challenge [1]. As a consequence of a relatively
suppressed immune system, the proportion of asymptomatic
infection in MHD populations may be higher than average
[24, 25].
According to Hsu and Weiner [14] to mitigate the impact of
COVID-19 in dialysis units, we should focus on three main
areas including dialysis facilities, transportation, and patients’
communities. Although MHD centres have little control over
the latter two, they can mitigate transmission risks within their
facilities. In order to address these challenges, hospitals,
nephrology departments, and hemodialysis centres have
adopted recommended protocols and guidelines internally and
externally. These guidelines focus on three transmission
routes: transmission from patients; transmission from
healthcare professionals, and transmission from the surface
[1].
III. MATERIALS AND METHODS
A. Index hemodialysis centre
We build our simulation platform and models based on the
University Health Network (UHN) in-centre dialysis program.
UHN has one of the largest in-centre hemodialysis programs
in Toronto, situated at Toronto General Hospital (TGH). This
unit serves 308 patients, of which 278 do intermittent
hemodialysis three to six days a week, and 30 are

nocturnal/evening dialysis patients who dialyze three days a
week. There are two separate but contiguous units at TGH
(“Hemo-east” and “Hemo-west”, separated by a corridor) with
a total of 55 dialysis chairs that serve 55 patients at a time
(Fig. 1). The westward treatment area is 580 m2 consisting of
a 165 m2 corridor and 245 m2 for dialysis stations with an
average area of 9 m2 per station. The eastward treatment area
is 1235 m2 and consists of a 299 m2 corridor and 301 m2 for
dialysis stations with an average area of 9.7 m2 per station.
Regular dialysis stations are divided by curtains and isolate
dialysis stations have divider partitions. Regular dialysis
stations are located in the perimetral and middle of the wards.
The hemodialysis unit is staffed by nephrologists, nurses,
assistants (technicians), pharmacists, dieticians, social
workers, and other clerical and support staff. There are three
daily shifts and a nocturnal shift from Mondays to Saturdays.
The working time in the hemodialysis department had been
scheduled in three 10-hour shifts that overlap each other about
two and four hours in the nocturnal and daily shifts,
respectively. Nurses are assigned to specific dialysis stations,
and not to patients. Patients are randomly assigned to the
stations and there is no consistency regarding which stations
they are assigned. Patients will likely be assigned different
nurses each day. Thus, the nurses will not consistently take
care of the same patients on the next appearance of the patient
in the centre. Patients are neither assigned to the same stations,
although some have their preferred spot. It is done to maintain
maximum flexibility and interchangeability. Nurses will often
finish their shifts while their patients are being dialyzed. They
will therefore handover patient care to the nurses from the
next shift. Nurses rotate between patients during dialysis
intermittently, assessing blood pressure (BP-automatically
checked by the machine every 15 min to 30 min), blood flows,
and circuit pressures. The nurses congregate at the nursing
station closest to their patients. After the patient is served and
left the station, the housekeeping staff cleanse the chair/bed,
replace linens, and clean the area. The nurse is responsible for
cleaning the patient chart and BP cuff.

Before, or between the shifts, hemodialysis assistants (HAs)
set up the dialysis machines. This includes putting on
dialyzers, putting tubes onto the machine, ensuring the
machines are cleaned and sterilized according to the protocol,
and ensuring other needed equipment is available at the
station. There are three HAs per shift for each of the two
wards (east ward and west ward). When they are not actively
preparing machines, the HAs usually sit at nursing stations.
Ten different nephrologists are responsible for the 12 shifts
(six on each of the two wards). A nurse practitioner (NP)
assists the nephrologists in each shift. Nephrology fellows are
also assigned to round in the unit on behalf of the most
responsible physician (MRP). The MRP spends approximately
1-2 hours in the dialysis unit, once a week, while the NP
and/or the nephrology fellow spend approximately 1-2 hours
per shift rounding on the patients on both wards. When the NP
or fellow is not actively seeing patients, they may stay in their
office area or simply leave the unit.
Table II shows the current key infection mitigation
measures used in the dialysis centre. Nurses, physicians, and
other staff in the unit wear face masks and face-shields,
especially when interacting with the patients at close range.
All health care providers don gloves and gowns when
interacting with patients who are on droplet precautions (any
patients who screen positive or are positive for any respiratory
infection). Patients are asked to socially distance (2 meters)
when in the waiting room of the dialysis unit. All patients are
screened as they enter, and those who screen positive are
prioritized to enter the unit and are tested with nasopharyngeal
swabs for viral detection.

transmission based on the contact matrices generated by the
pedestrian model. The contact matrices were created based on
three different types of interactions: patient to patient, patient
to staff (health care providers), and staff to staff.
To model the workflow and disease transmission in the
dialysis department, we used discrete event and agent-based
simulation capabilities of the AnyLogic® simulation modelling
software (version 8.7.0). AnyLogic® provided an environment
that enables simulation of the geometry of the centre and
processes such as scheduling, workflow, peoples, and their
attributes.
Contacts between the patients and the dialysis staff can be
loci of infectious spread. The probability of virus transmission
is a function of the number of contacts, average contact
duration, and the distance of the subject with the substance
[26]. To model disease spread, we recorded agent movements
and created contact matrices that includes this information.
The contact matrix is one of the mathematical components
used for disease modelling among different groups of
individuals in an environment. This matrix meets the
reciprocity of contacts which makes the contacts rate matrix
symmetric [4]. To obtain such a matrix for our case study (the
dialysis unit), we simulated the real setting of the dialysis
centre and its workflow processes. Agent movements were
simulated using the Pedestrian library in AnyLogic® software.
Agents moved according to predefined physical rules for the
simulation. They interacted with the surrounding objects,
including other agents, walls, and escalators, and avoided
potential collisions. The user of the model (hereafter: user) can
assign individual properties, preferences, and states to these
agents – here, pedestrian agents. Using the pedestrian model,
we simulated the movements of staff and patients based on
their schedules and workflows. Using this simulation, we
found the number of contacts and the duration in which the
agents were in proximity. These values are presented as
contacts matrices, that can be applied to disease transmission
models.
Dialysis Centre

In the hemodialysis units, there are five rooms with
negative pressure isolation that are used for COVID positive
or presumptive positive patients. If there are more, eight other
stations have been identified where COVID patients will be
preferentially dialyzed. All stations have at the very least
curtains to separate if needed.
B. Dialysis centre simulation and contacts calculator
model
In this study, we used a two-stage approach to model the
dialysis centre operation and disease spread among the staff
and patients. We used a combination of discrete event
pedestrian and agent-based modelling to simulate various
agents’ movement in our study hemodialysis centre and an
agent-based disease transmission model to simulate disease

Fig. 2 General structure of the agent-based simulation model (Left:
Agents, Right: Environment Detail)

In general, we can define active or inactive agents in
AnyLogic® agent-based simulation platform. Active agents
(i.e., human agents) in our case are the staff and patients, and
inactive agents are dialysis machines, beds/chairs, and
furniture in the department (Fig. 2). We defined MRPs,
nephrologists, nurses, assistants, clerks, housekeepers, and

patients as the active agents, and beds/chairs as inactive
agents. Although staff such as pharmacists, dieticians, social
workers, etc. work in the same unit, for convenience and
simplicity, we assumed that they had very limited contacts
with patients. The model boundary in this simulation
(environment of agents) is the dialysis department comprising
of common hallways and areas, and wards that were
embedded in the model in full scale and details. Active agents
could interact and move in the predefined areas according to
their assigned duties. The movement of the agents was
controlled by the built-in Pedestrian library of the AnyLogic®
software.
Workflows for staff and patients were assigned based on the
treatment process (Fig. 3). These workflows ran in parallel
(i.e., simultaneously) through the simulation run using an
event manager. Table III presents the number of staff and their
shift assignments. We assumed that all staff and patient
schedules are fixed on a weekly time basis. All in-shift staff
enter through the north entrance, check their daily assignment
at a board in the eastward corridor entrance, and go to their
locker room to change into uniform and get ready. Female and
male locker rooms are located in the east and west wards
respectively. There is one station for all physicians in the east
ward and several stations for other staff in both wards (Fig. 1).
Patients come from the main entrance (south of the building),
register at the clerk’s desk, and wait in the lobby area for their
treatments' turn. The admission is on a first come first serve
basis (FIFO model). The patients sit in the lobby based on the
order they entered the environment. After a dialysis station is
prepared by an assistant, the patient is directed to the ward by
a receptionist clerk. The dialysis treatment takes about 3.5 to
4.5 hours. During the treatment period, the nurses supervise
the process. The nurses circulate between the dialysis stations
and their assigned patients. We assumed that checking the
patients takes place once every 15-minutes. At the end of the
dialysis, the nurse disconnects the dialysis machine from the
patient and the patient returns to the lobby, to depart. Some
patients stay in the lobby for a while before they leave the
dialysis unit. Patients receive treatment 3 to 6 times a week,
four shifts a day, and we assumed are familiar with the
process.
In the agentSource block of each agent in the workflow
(Fig. 3), agents are created at the beginning of the simulation
in their virtual homes, which is just outside the hospital
environment. The agents of a certain shift start to attend the
centre at the start of their shift. Staff find their shift
assignment (number of dialysis stations that should be served
during the shift) and go to their locker room based on their
gender then going to the nearest station to their assignments.
At this location, agents check to find if their assigned
station(s) need their service or not. This check is regulated by
a virtual event manager every one second. The chain of steps
for a dialysis station is: 1) cleaning by a housekeeper; 2)
preparing the machine by an assistant; 3) getting a patient; 4)
connecting the machine to the patient by a nurse; 5) multiple
checkups of the patient by the assigned nurse during the
service; and 6) disconnecting the machine from the patient by
the nurse after the treatment is over. Physicians (MRPs)
randomly visit patients that need advice. Patients come to the
lobby, lineup, get screened at the reception and wait for a

message from an assistant declaring that the dialysis station is
ready. When patients reach their assigned station, they stay
there until the end of the treatment. Once the treatment is over,
the patients return to the lobby and wait for a short time and
then and leave the environment. There is a break time for the
staff during their shift, during which the staff who wait in the
centre with no assignment leave the area and go to the
breakroom for a maximum of 40 minutes. These processes
repeat during a workday to serve all incoming patients. Table
IV shows the used parameters in the model.

By using the Pedestrian library for the active agents in this
model, the movement of the patients and staff and their
proximity is simulated during each shift in the dialysis centre.
We directly calculated close contacts between all people in the
centre as well as the time-length of the contacts. In the dialysis
model, in total, 486 active agents and 58 inactive agents were
defined. Due to the weekly cyclic and random schedule of the
active agents, every agent had the probability of contacts with
the 485 active agents in the same or different categories. For
example, a nurse could come to close contacts with 109

nurses, 30 assistants, 308 patients, 22 physicians, 10
housekeepers, 6 clerks, and all beds/chairs in the dialysis
department during a week. To calculate the contacts, we
assumed proximity less than 2 meters is a contact. For every
agent, we defined an array for each category of agent instances
with the size of the total members of that agent to store the
history of the contacts between the agents. A simple sample of
this array for an agent (we call it centre agent) between eight
agents from three categories has been presented in Fig. 4.
Three arrays (A, B, and C) have been defined for these
categories. Every element of each array represents one of the
eight agents that the centre agent may become to close
contacts with. This element comprises a three-element array
that stores the time of connection, number of contacts with
that agent, and the cumulative time of the connection. In every
second for the centre agent, the nearest (< 2 meters distance)
agents are geometrically defined. These agents have been
located inside the circle with the centre point of the central
agent in Fig. 4. For each agent in proximity, the close contacts
time is stored in the corresponding element of the array of the
centre agent. If this agent at the previous time step was not in
proximity, one close contact is added to the corresponding
counter of the agent otherwise this contact is not encountered
as a new contact. One second is also added to the
corresponding element of the cumulative time of connection.
Simulating for an arbitrary time, we can record the number
and duration of contact for all agents in the arrays. Using such
arrays for all agents of a category, the statistical variables of
contact parameters between different or the same category of
agents can be evaluated and used for the disease transmission
model.

well as self-isolation, hospitalization, and deceased
compartments.
Fig. 5 shows our agent-based model’ state chart for each
person including staff and patients. In this model, all persons
are initially susceptible. Once an individual is infected and
arrives in the hospital, it starts contaminating others based on
the estimated contact rates that s/he has with other individuals
and the probability of infections. These values vary depending
on the type of person. If positive disease status is known, the
person will be isolated, and the isolated individuals will no
longer able to transmit the virus. The agent-based parameters
used to run the base model are listed in Table V.

C. Disease transmission model
Although the contacts calculator model can precisely
simulate the process and provide micro-scale contacts
parameters in our case study dialysis unit, it takes a long time
to be run and generate the results for long-term simulation. To
simulate the disease transmission quicker and in more
flexibility for examining various scenarios, we developed
another agent-based model. We used a modified version of the
SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, and Recovered) disease
transmission model in this study. Other than the usual

IV. RESULTS
Depending on the prespecified input parameters, the
model generates a multitude of different results. In this
section, we present results from a few simulation
experiments and scenarios. We first present the result of the
dialysis centre workflow that generated the contact matrices
for us, and then use the generated matrices in a sample
experiment of our disease transmission model.

A. Contacts model and simulation results
To obtain the parameters of the contacts generator model,
we ran the dialysis unit simulation model in one-second time
steps for a full week, using two scenarios: a) “base model”;
and b) a model without a break schedule (following COVID19 guidelines that strongly recommends not to have any
unnecessary gatherings of the healthcare workers and the
staff). In the base model (i.e., normal schedule scenario), all
workflow steps in Fig. 3 are done, while in the second
scenario, break and gathering in the break room are omitted.
Repeating the scenario runs or running the model for a long
time did not change the contacts parameters significantly.
Fig. 6 illustrates the duration of close contacts between
agents in the same or different categories in terms of
cumulative hourly (sum of 3600 seconds) and daily (sum of
24 hours) time series.

when the unit is closed. As expected, the hourly contact
parameters have fluctuations during the day and days of a
week due to the randomness of both the staff work and
patient treatment schedules. However, the daily averages of
the contact parameters have fewer fluctuations. We can
calculate matrices of the average time of contact and the
number of contacts between all agent categories in any
desired time span. We call this matrix micro-scale contacts
matrix (MSCM) which can be calculated in every arbitrary
time span. Assuming the daily values of contact parameters
affect disease transmission, we use the daily contact matrix
in our transmission model. Table VI summarizes the contact
parameter in the normal schedule and without break
condition. These contact matrices are symmetric, as expected
[4]. As explained above in the methods section, the contact
parameters of the same category staff are generally increased
when the break is omitted from the workflow.

Fig. 6. Time series of hourly cumulative time of connections between
agents. a) normal schedule b) normal and without break time scenario

As can be seen in Fig. 6, between the time 13:00 and
18:00, as well as between 21:00 and 23:00 every day, when
the schedules of staff from different shifts overlap, the time
and number of contacts between agents increases. At other
times, the hourly parameters of contacts remain slightly
constant. At the nocturnal shift, the contacts are reduced due
to the limited capacity of overnight patient admission to one
unit of the department. At this time, the number of patients,
nurses, and assistants is almost cut in half, but it is assumed
that the number of clerks remains the same. The hourly
length of contacts between clerks and the reduced number of
contacts between other categories are well captured by the
model. Comparing the assistant-to-assistant contacts and
assistant-to-clerk contacts (Fig. 6b) highlights the effect of
break time in the connection parameters. If no gathering
happens during the break times (13:00 to 14:00, 16:00 to
17:00, and 00:00 and 1:00), the number of contacts between
different categories of staff are reduced. However, if agents
do not leave their stations during the break time, the overall
contacts between the agents of the same categories or the
same station are increased in this time window.

cumulative time and numbers of connections during a oneweek simulation. Daily charting starts from Monday at 7:00
AM, and day 7 of the model simulation represents Sunday

and time (right charts) of connections during a one-week simulation of

B. Disease transmission model and simulation results
Based on the modified SEIR disease transmission model
that we developed for the agents and based on the contacts
matrices developed by the simulation model, we ran this
simulation for a base scenario (a normal condition with
minimum protection and COVID-19 infection). We then
focused on the impact of random testing of staff and patients
on disease propagation. We used our model to examine the
impact of break time on the results. Fig. 8 and Table VII
summarize these model results for 45 days of simulation. At
the start of these simulations, a random asymptomatic person
from each category comes to the hospital and the spread of
disease among all people is evaluated. Each simulation has
run 500 times using different random seeds and the average
results are presented here. For the testing scenario, five
patients and five staff randomly tested for COVID-19 each
week and if the test result is positive, they will be isolated
until they are recovered. In Table VII the maximum

percentage of exposed individuals and the time that this
maximum happens are presented.
MRPs and nephrologists have the least connection with
the patients and staff with a shorter working time than other
staff, and it is assumed they are not gathering in the break
room with other staff. So, they have less probability of
infection in the dialysis unit. They also work in different
shifts and their connection together rarely happens.
Therefore, all physicians are less likely to get infected, and if
they are infected but are asymptomatic, their disease affects
few individuals and remains limited to their assigned dialysis
unit. The existence of an asymptomatic clerk, housekeeper,
assistant, or nurse creates a condition that over 50 percent of
staff in the unit would get infected. The time of reaching the
maximum number of exposed people is shorter in this
scenario.

the dialysis unit (column Nur.NoBr.), the number of exposed
individuals who are working with the nurse does not increase
significantly. However, the results are different for clerks. In
the no-break condition, clerks do not go to the break or
lounge room, thus they do not experience close contact with
other staff. In the case of an asymptomatic patient in the nobreak condition, the number of exposed individuals does not
significantly vary. This scenario confirms the importance of
measures that reduce disease transmission between staff once
more.

An asymptomatic nurse or assistant brings the riskiest
condition of disease spread in the dialysis unit. The time of
reaching the maximum number of exposed people is shorter
in this case. Comparing the columns Pat.Tes. and Pat. in
Table VII shows that random weekly testing of about 0.5%
of all individuals can reduce all exposed individuals by 2%.
Examining this scenario with more random testing showed
that random testing can reduce disease transmission that is in
conformance with other studies [34]. It reduces the daily
infection rates. Staff in dialysis units are also very more
vulnerable. Our results show that asymptomatic staff poses
more risk than an asymptomatic patient. These results
suggest that testing and disease transmission prevention
measures for staff can be even more important and effective
than for the patients. Results of the second scenario (no
gathering during the breaks) are presented in Table VII.
According to these results, if an asymptomatic nurse enters

V. DISCUSSION
In this paper, we firstly provided some background
related to the current situation, issues, and challenges of the
SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Hemodialysis departments.
Subsequently, the results of the two developed models of a
typical dialysis department were presented. These models
were simulating the department's operations and disease
transmission. The first model provided the real operation of
the dialysis department, considering the schedules of work
and treatment, the entrance of patients and staff, their stay in
the lobby, stations, locker rooms, units, and movement and
order of workflow in the dialysis department. The workflow
of the patients, physicians, nurses, assistants, clerks, and
housekeepers was simulated as a parallel and in-order
process using the pedestrian library of the AnyLogic®
software. The real number and time of contact for the agents
in the hospital were evaluated and presented as a contacts
matrix that was used for the simulation of disease
transmission.
Another model was simulating disease transmission using
the modified SEIR model that included asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic components. The results
show that under the base scenario that is with limited
protection and in the early stages of the pandemic, an
asymptomatic unchecked patient, nurse, assistant, and clerk
can have a significant impact on disease propagation in the
system due to the large social mix of agents involved in the
dialysis process. This paper shows the capability of the
agent-based simulation for modelling the spread of a disease
through a dialysis unit and provides an opportunity to
identify modifiable factors and behaviors that lead to
increased infection rates. This would provide evidence-based
targets to direct resources for virus transmission mitigation.
Our simulation covers a work flowchart of a typical

dialysis unit in a normal condition and takes the distancebased direct contacts between individuals as the reason for
disease transmission. Other parameters such as the density of
virus in the air, ventilation system, and infected surfaces can
affect the spread of disease transmission.
CDC defines close contact as: “someone who was within 6
feet of an infected person for a cumulative total of 15
minutes or more over a 24-hour period starting from 2 days
before the illness onset (or, for asymptomatic patients, 2
days prior to testing specimen collection) until the time the
patient is isolated” [35]. This is used as an operational
definition for contact investigation due to the limited
available data. Other parameters such as the type of
symptoms of infected individuals and environmental factors
(crowding, adequacy of ventilation, whether exposure was
indoors or outdoors) can affect these values. In general, in a
large population, there is no way or method to define the
average number of individuals and infected individual
meetings [36]. Sensitivity analysis and calibration of the
mathematical models based on the real data are used to
define these parameters for large populations. For example,
Zeng, Guo, Deng, Luo and Zhang [36] calculated the average
number of contacts per exposed individual per day of 20 and
24 for these locations Hubei Province and Outside Hubei
Province of China. Also, statistical analysis for closed
environments can estimate the contact rate between the
individuals. The contact rate among the people who are
working or receiving treatments in a hospital varies
depending on the type of work and hospitalization. Baek,
Lee, Cho, Hyun, Kim, Sohn, Kim, Ahn, Jeong, Ku, Yeom,
Lee and Choi [4] used the value of contact duration of about
5 hours for the hospital wards and less than 0.5 hours for the
outpatient department and emergency room for physicians,
nurses, and other caregivers. Patients and caregivers in the
hospital wards have the longest contact time. The contacts
between the same category of agents have been assumed to
be higher than the other probable contacts. Using the agentbased simulation, we calculated the time series of the
number of contacts and time-length that people spend
together in the dialysis unit (Table VI). The simulation
showed that individuals who have the same station or are in
the same category, have the maximum rate of contact and
spend more time together. The contact parameters vary
during a day and increase when the schedule of staff is
overlapped. Staff who are working in the same station are
spending more than 15 minutes during a working shift and
based on the CDC [35] definition, they will probably be
exposed if one of them is infected.
It is important to highlight some of the limitations of the
current study that we are currently working on. As our
contacts matrices have been developed based on one dialysis
unit with a specific workflow, more simulations of this type
in other units need to be developed to examine if the same
contacts patterns exist. Having said that our disease
transmission model allows for new contacts matrices to be
used. Moreover, the contacts matrices generated in this
study need to be validated against some real measurements
which require field observations and measurements that were
not possible under the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic

conditions.

Fig. 8 Number of individuals exposed from a category (Title of each
chart) over time (day) under different scenarios (Shown in the legend)
such as: entering an asymptomatic person, without break, and random
testing in the dialysis unit.

VI. CONCLUSION
Results of the high-resolution calculation of contact
parameters show a wide range of contact and various contact
time among all agents during a workday which is important
in virus transmission. Using this time series of contact we
can minimize or optimize the workflow of the agents to have
the lowest probability of the disease spread in hospitals. It is
recommended that new studies on disease transmission
consider these variations in contact parameters to find more
realistic transmission parameters. The presented results here
are based on some sample experiments which need to be
expanded to include more variations of parameter values and
virus protection measures. The current model does not
capture all the complexity of interactions that are affecting
disease transmission. During the pandemic, the UHN dialysis
unit guidelines for preventing infection have changed several
times based on emerging evidence and fortunately, the actual
infection rates were low. The contact matrices generated by
our simulation provide reasonable results when entered into
the disease transmission model. We aim to continue further
assessment and validate our model, to use it for policy and
scenario analyses in the future. This study provides
promising results for using agent-based simulation at a
micro-scale to develop various contact matrices that can be
used for detailed disease modelling and investigation of
various mitigation measures. However, more studies like this
and cross-validations are needed.
