Abstract

Objective: This study aimed to determine whether serum vitamin D is independently
associated with COVID-19 infection and outcomes in patients with COVID-19.
Methods: We identified relevant studies by searching the PubMed, Embase, and
medRxiv databases from December 2019 to October 1, 2020. Odds ratios (ORs) were
pooled using random-effects models. Only reports with multivariate adjusted results
were included to avoid the impact of potential confounding factors.
Results: A total of six studies with 377,265 patients were identified. Overall, in the
categorical analysis, a low serum vitamin D level was associated with an increased
risk of COVID-19 infection (OR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.09- 1.97, I2=81%), hospitalization
(OR: 1.83, 95% CI: 1.22-2.74, I2=0%), but not in-hospital death (OR: 2.73, 95% CI:
0.27-27.61). Notably, when vitamin D level was analyzed as a continuous variable,
each 5 ng/ml increase in vitamin D level was not associated with any increased risk of
COVID-19 infection (OR: 1.04, 95% CI: 0.96-1.12, I2=74%) or in-hospital death (OR:
1.02, 95% CI: 0.93-1.12).
Conclusions: Low serum vitamin D is associated with an increased risk of
COVID-19 infection and hospitalization. In-hospital death showed a tendency to be
increased in COVID-19 patients with low vitamin D levels. The ongoing clinical trials
for evaluation of vitamin D supplementation will be key to the validation of this
adjunctive treatment for COVID-19 patients.

Introduction
Recent studies have highlighted that mean plasma vitamin D level is significantly
lower among those who tested positive for COVID-19 than among those who tested
negative[1]. Rhodes et al.[2] found that all countries that lie below 35 degrees north
latitude have relatively low mortality for patients with COVID-19. These results
suggest that low levels of vitamin D may be associated with increased COVID-19
infection rates and worse outcomes in COVID-19. Consistently, several studies have
reported that serum vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increased risk of
COVID-19 positivity and worse outcomes (e.g., severe COVID-19 and in-hospital
death)[3-5]. For example, in Radujkovic's cohort (N=198), vitamin D deficiency was
associated with a higher risk of invasive mechanical ventilation and/or in-hospital
death (HR: 6.12, 95% CI: 2.79–13.42 and HR: 14.73, 95% CI: 4.16–52.19,
respectively)[5]. However, a larger cohort-based study from the UK Biobank showed
a positive association between serum vitamin D concentration and severe COVID-19
infection (per 10 nmol/L vitamin D, HR: 0.93; p<0.001) and mortality (per 10 vitamin
D nmol/L, HR: 0.92; p=0.016) in univariate analysis, but not after adjustment for
confounders (COVID-19 infection HR: 1.00; p=0.89; mortality HR: 0.98; p=0.69)[6].
Similarly, two other studies also found no association between vitamin D level and
COVID-19 positivity[7, 8]. Therefore, the impact of vitamin D on COVID-19 is still
controversial, and a definite conclusion has not yet been drawn. We therefore aimed to
conduct a meta-analysis to clarify the association between serum low vitamin D and
COVID-19.

Methods
This study was performed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
reviews and Meta-Analyses Statement (PRISMA) guidelines.

Literature Search and study Selection

Two authors independently searched several databases (PubMed, Embase, medRxiv)
using the following two groups of keywords with no language restrictions:
2019-novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, 2019-nCoV, and vitamin D. In
addition, we searched the reference lists of other relevant publications to identify
further studies. Inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) human studies, not laboratory or
animal studies, that were published as original articles; 2) case-control study or cohort
study; 3)

reports with multivariate analyses with estimate effect (odds ratio) and its

95% confidence intervals (CIs) results that reported vitamin D and COVID-19 (e.g.,
COVID-19 infection risk, severity, and in-hospital death). When multiple papers
reporting on the same study were identified, the most informative or complete article
was included.
Data extraction and statistical analysis
Two authors independently extracted all data from included studies. In cases of
discrepancies, disagreement was resolved by collegial discussion. The following
information was extracted: first author, country, publication year, gender, mean or
median age, study design, sample size, vitamin D level, OR or RR with the 95% CI
for each category (results adjusted according to most potential confounders), and

adjusted variables.
Odds ratios (ORs) were pooled using random-effects models. We calculated
study-specific slopes (vitamin D per 5 ng/ml decrement) and 95% CIs from the
natural logs of the reported RRs and CIs across categories of vitamin D level[9, 10].
Cochran Q and I2 statistics were used to detect statistical heterogeneity between
studies. The overall quality of included studies was assessed by Newcastle-Ottawa
quality assessment scale (NOS), with a NOS score of ≥6 stars was regarded as
high-quality[11]. All statistical analyses were conducted by using Review Manager
version 5.3 (The Cochrane Collaboration 2014; Nordic Cochrane Center Copenhagen,
Denmark). All statistical tests were double-sided, and P < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
Results
Study selection
As shown in Figure 1, we identified 486 studies in the initial database search. After
removing duplicates(n = 257) and studies with insufficient information on vitamin D
and COVID-19, a total of six[3-6, 12, 13] studies with 377,265 patients remained.
Study characteristics and quality
Each study is listed in Table 1. Four[3, 6, 12, 13] studies reported vitamin D levels
and COVID-19 positivity, and four[3, 5, 6, 12] reported the association of vitamin D
levels and COVID-19 outcomes. Of the six studies, 3 were cohort studies and 3 were
case-control cohort studies. Most of studies (n = 3) were performed in USA, 1 was
performed in UK, 1 in Israel and 1 in Germany. The overall quality of included

studies was high (NOS score ≥ 6)(Table 1).
The effect of vitamin D level on COVID-19
Overall, in the categorical analysis, low serum vitamin D level was associated with
increased risk of COVID-19 infection (OR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.09-1.97, I2=81%),
hospitalization (OR: 1.83, 95% CI: 1.22-2.74, I2=0%) but not in-hospital death (OR:
2.73, 95% CI: 0.27-27.61) (Figure 1.A). When vitamin D level was analyzed as a
continuous variable, each 5 ng/ml increase in vitamin D level was not associated with
an increased risk of COVID-19 positivity (OR: 1.04, 95% CI: 0.96-1.12, I2=74%) or
in-hospital death (OR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.93-1.12) (Figure 1.B). The publication bias of
POAF was not conducted as limited studies (N<10) according to the guidelines [14].
Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to investigate the
association between serum vitamin D and COVID-19 positivity rates and outcomes in
patients with COVID-19. Our results showed that low vitamin D independently
increased the risk of COVID-19 infection and hospitalization by 47% and 83%,
respectively. However, we did not find a significant positive association between low
vitamin D and in-hospital death (P=0.56). Considering the limited number of studies
in the present study, more studies with a larger sample size are needed to verify these
results. Several studies have found a positive correlation between mean serum vitamin
D levels and the number of in-hospital deaths caused by COVID-19 cases and
mortality in European countries[2, 15, 16]. In another study with a small sample size
(N=46), a survival analysis outlined that patients with severe vitamin D deficiency

(<10 ng/ml) had a 50% increase in mortality probability compared with patients with
vitamin D >10 ng/ml[17]. Furthermore, Mendy et al.[4] also found that vitamin D
increased the risk of severe COVID-19 risk and ICU/in-hospital death in multivariate
analysis. Another study reported that vitamin D insufficiency increased the risk of
IMV/in-hospital death by 5.75-fold after adjusting for age, gender, and
comorbidities[5]. Therefore, whether vitamin D insufficiency increases the severity of
the disease and consequently the risk of in-hospital death is still controversial. More
studies adjusted for clinical cofounders are needed to clarify this issue in future
research.
Notably, we found that the results for vitamin D level analyzed as a categorical
variable and as a continuous variable are inconsistent. Apart from the limited number
of studies included in the continuous analysis, we speculate that this might be
explained by a nonlinear dose-response relationship between serum vitamin D and
COVID-19. Such a nonlinear dose-response relationship between vitamin D and
disease susceptibility/severity is common[18-20], reflecting a significant difference in
the effects of high vitamin D and low vitamin D levels on COVID-19. Therefore, a
linear model (continuous variable) may be unable to actually detect the impact of low
vitamin D on COVID-19.
There are several potential underlying pathophysiological mechanisms for the
association between serum vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19. First, various
studies have shown the antiviral activities of vitamin D through effects on dendritic
cells and T cells[21]. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials also

demonstrated that vitamin D treatment for patients with vitamin D deficiency can
reduce viral respiratory infections, among which coronaviruses are common causative
organisms[22]. Another vital mechanism might be the inhibition of the
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Our previous meta-analyses have
suggested that ACEI/ARB treatment by inhibiting RAAS might reduce COVID-19
infection and improve outcomes in patients with COVID-19[23]. Vitamin D could
inhibit AT-1R and stimulate ACE2, thus inhibiting inflammatory responses, including
limiting the inflammatory cytokine storm (e.g., IL-6, TNFα)[24].
Based on the positive association between vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19, it is
reasonable to suggest that vitamin D supplementation might reduce the risk of
COVID-19 infection and improve outcomes in patients with COVID-19. The benefits
of vitamin D supplementation in people who are vitamin D deficient are known to
include reducing other viral respiratory infections (e.g., respiratory syncytial virus and
influenza infection). Furthermore, a meta-analysis of individual participant data also
showed that vitamin D supplementation substantially reduced the severity of
COPD[25]. Therefore, we hypothesize that vitamin D supplementation might be
useful to reduce the incidence and burden of COVID-19. However, there are no
published articles that assess the effect of vitamin D supplements on COVID-19.
Ongoing clinical trials (e.g., NCT04407286 and NCT04482673) for the evaluation of
vitamin D supplementation will be key to the validation of this adjunctive treatment
for COVID-19 patients[24].

The present meta-analysis has several limitations. There is high heterogeneity in our
meta-analysis, which might derive from the study design and variability in baseline
characteristics. For example, several studies have shown that the mortality rate for
black patients is higher than the rate for white COVID-19 patients[26, 27]. Second,
many factors can modulate vitamin D status, including genetic polymorphisms, age,
health, sun exposure behavior, season, and so on[21]. Although we only included
studies that performed multivariable analysis, some potential risk factors were not
fully adjusted, which might also have affected our results. Therefore, further research
might adjust for additional confounding factors.
Conclusion
Low serum vitamin D is associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 infection and
hospitalization. In-hospital death showed a tendency to be increased in COVID-19
patients with low vitamin D levels; however, this trend did not reach statistical
significance, which might be due to the small sample size. Further larger studies
controlling for confounding factors are needed to investigate the association between
low vitamin D and COVID-19 related death. The ongoing clinical trials for evaluation
of vitamin D supplementation will be key to the validation of this adjunctive
treatment for COVID-19 patients.
