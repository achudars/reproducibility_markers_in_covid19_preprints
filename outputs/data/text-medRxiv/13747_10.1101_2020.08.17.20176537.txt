ABSTRACT

Background & Objective

: The covid-19 epidemic is rapidly escalating in India and unlike developed

countries there is no evidence of plateau or decline in the past 6 months. To evaluate association of
state-level sociodemographics with incident cases and deaths we performed an ecological study.
: Publicly available data sources were used. Absolute number of covid-19 cases and deaths

Methods

were obtained and cases and deaths/million in each state calculated from February to July 2020. To
assess association of state level disease burden with sociodemographic variables (urbanization, human
development, healthcare availability, healthcare access and quality etc.) we determined Pearson’s
correlation and logarithmic trends.
: Covid-19 in India has led to >2,000,000 cases and 45,000 deaths by end July 2020. There is large

Results

variation in state-level cases/million ranging from 7247 (Delhi), 3728 (Goa) and 3427 (Maharashtra) to
less than 300/million in a few. Deaths/million range from 212 (Delhi), 122 (Maharashtra) and 51
(Tamilnadu) to 2 in north-eastern states. Most of the high burden states (except Delhi) are reporting
increasing burden and deaths with the largest increase in July 2020. There is a significant positive
correlation of urbanization with covid-19 cases (r=0.65, R2=0.35) and deaths (r=0.60, R2=0.28) and
weaker correlation with other sociodemographic variables. From March to July 2020, stable R2 value for
urbanization is observed with cases (0.37 to 0.39) while it is increasing for deaths (0.10 to 0.28).
Conclusions

: Covid-19 epidemic is escalating in India and cases as well as deaths are significantly greater

in more urbanized states. Prevention, control and treatment should focus on urban health systems.

INTRODUCTION

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) related to novel coronavirus (covid-19) has rapidly spread
globally. Initial cases were reported from China from where it rapidly spread to Europe, East Asia,
Europe, North and South America and lately to Africa and South Asia.1 India is currently facing the
maximum impact.2,3 The disease has been an urban phenomenon globally and has been mainly reported
from densely populated urban conglomerations in China and low socioeconomic status urban locations
in Europe and North America.4 United Nations estimates that 90% of all Covid-19 cases are urban and
there is only limited evidence of rural spread.5 Covid-19 related burden has been controlled in many
countries across the globe using well known public health strategies of testing and tracing of cases (using
laboratory methods) and isolation.6 This strategy combined with universal masking, hand hygiene and
sanitation, avoidance of crowding and physical distancing has led to virtual disappearance of covid-19
from some countries.7 Drug therapies for prophylaxis or treatment are yet not available as none has
proved successful in randomised controlled trials.8 Vaccine is under development.
In India, the epidemic is now a semester (6 months) old. Epidemiological transition of the disease
from contacts of returning travellers from Asia and Europe to metropolitan cities and large townships
has been reported.9 The disease has now transited from the major metropolises to smaller cities, towns
and townships with limited spread to the rural.10 The disease initially presented in low socioeconomic
urban locations and gradually spread to rural locations due to large scale urban to rural migration.9
However, it remained ensconced in urban areas also and with the release of government-instituted
lockdown and subsequent crowding the epidemic has resurfaced in urban locations.11 This is unlike the
olden epidemics whence disease would transmit from the rich to poor people and urban to rural
locations.12,13 Understanding macrolevel determinants of this transition is important for understanding
covid-19 dynamics and to formulate policies for controlling it. In the present article we describe covid-19
related disease and death burden in terms of absolute numbers and per million populations in all states
of the country using publicly available data over the first semester of the India epidemic, February to July
2020. We have also estimated association of disease burden and mortality with various
sociodemographic indices using univariate analysis to identify important drivers.
METHODS

The study has been conducted using publicly available data.9,14 The project proposal was submitted
to institutional ethics committee as part of covid-19 registry being maintained at our centre. The
committee approved use of secondary data for this report. Daily data on covid-19 in various states and

regions of India are being regularly updated at a non-commercial public website,
www.covid19india.org.14 This website updates daily data on covid-19 related cases, deaths, recovery and
testing at the state level of India. We obtained data for all the states in the country and clubbed daily
data into weekly and monthly numbers beginning February 2020 to end of July 2020. The data were
collated on spreadsheets. We then calculated number of cases and deaths per million population (2020
estimates) for each state. We also obtained data on multiple sociodemographic indices of each state
from public websites. The following indices were used: urbanization index (UI, proportion of urban to
rural population), human development index (HDI), social development index (SDI),sociodemographic
index (SI), epidemiological transition index (ETI, proportion of disability adjusted life years due to
communicable, maternal, neonatal and nutritional diseases to non-communicable diseases), healthcare
availability and quality index (HAQI), healthcare availability index (HAI), and social vulnerability index
(VI). (Supplementary Table 1). Details of estimation of each of these indices have been reported
earlier.15,16
To determine association of the state-level sociodemographic variables with covid-19 cases and
deaths we initially calculated Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r value) using MS Office Excel-2007. MS
Office Powerpoint-2007 was used to plot scatter-graphs for estimation of correlation of various
sociodemographic indices with total cases/million and deaths/million at end of 6 months of the data
(July 2020). Logarithmic trend-line was drawn to calculate trends (R2). SPSS Statistical Package was used
to calculate univariate and multivariate regression association statistics. To identify monthly change in
sociodemographic association with covid-19 cases/million and deaths/million we calculated R2 values for
months of April, May, June and July.
RESULTS

India is currently (July 2020) reporting more than 50,000 covid-9 cases and 1,000 covid-19 related
deaths daily and the cumulative burden is high for cases (>1,800,000) as well as deaths (38,000). India is
among the top-5 countries in terms of absolute number of cases and deaths.17 Although, the number of
cases and deaths per million (cases 1300, deaths 30) is low, it is the only large country where the
epidemic is escalating.
There is significant state-level variation with five states- Maharashtra, Tamilnadu, Andhra Pradesh,
Delhi and Karnataka accounting for more than two-thirds of cases and deaths (Figure 1). Cases and
deaths per million also show large variation with cases per million highest in Delhi (7247), Goa (3728),
Maharashtra (3427), Tamilnadu (3158) and Andhra Pradesh (2614) and deaths per million the highest in

Delhi (212), Maharashtra (122), Tamilnadu (51), Gujarat (38) and Pondicherry (35) (Figure 2). Absolute
number and numbers/million population of monthly covid-19 cases in various states of the country are
shown in Table 1.The cases were low in Feb to May 2020 but have increased rapidly in the following
months with greatest escalation in July 2020. Significant diversity is observed in trends of increase in
monthly number of cases and cases/million across various states of the country. Greatest month-onmonth increase is observed in a few states: Delhi, Goa, Maharashtra, Tamilnadu and Andhra Pradesh
(Figure 3). Absolute number of deaths/month and death/million/month are shown in Table 2. Similar to
cases, deaths are the highest in Maharashtra, Delhi, Tamilnadu, Gujarat and Karnataka while
deaths/million are the highest in Delhi, Maharashtra, Tamilnadu, Gujarat and Pondicherry. State-level
trends in monthly deaths/million reveal rapidly escalating trends in Delhi, Maharashtra, Tamilnadu,
Gujarat and Pondicherry. ON the other hand, a decline in trends of deaths/million is observed in Delhi
and Andhra Pradesh (Figure 3).
We correlated cumulative covid-19 cases and deaths/million at July 2020 with various
sociodemographic indices (Table 3). A significant correlation of state-level urbanization index is observed
with cases/million (r= 0.58, R2= 0.35) as well as deaths/million (r= 0.55, R2= 0.28) (Figure 4). Significant
correlation (r value) is also observed for cases/million with HDI (0.42), sociodemographic index (0.60),
ETI (-0.44) and HAQI (0.50) and non-significant correlation with SDI (-0.20), HAI (0.12), and VI (0.01).
Significant correlation for deaths/million is observed for UI and sociodemographic index (0.50) only
(Table 3). Multiple regression analysis reveals that the only significant association for covid-19 related
deaths is with urbanization index (B= 0.55+0.24, standardized beta= 0.52, p=0.040).
To evaluate monthly trends in association of cases and deaths/million with urbanization index we
performed monthly analysis from April to July 2020 (Figure 5). Association of urbanization with
cases/million for months of April, May, June and July, respectively, is similar (R2= 0.38, 0.37, 0.38 and
0.29) while with deaths/million it is increasing (R2= 0.10, 0.20, 0.21 and 0.28).
DISCUSSION

This study shows rapidly increasing burden of covid-19 cases and deaths in terms of absolute
numbers as well as proportion per million in all regions of India. The burden is significantly greater in
more urbanized states and mortality from the disease is increasing in these states during the first six
months of the epidemic.
Observational data from Europe and North America have not highlighted urban-rural difference in
covid-19 burden.5 This could be due to the fact that most of these countries are highly urbanized (705

90%). In countries with larger proportion of rural individuals, such as China, Brazil, Iran, Mexico and
South Africa, reports have highlighted the predominant urban nature of the disease,5 similar to our
study. Reports from China, Europe, UK and USA have also reported that urban low socioeconomic status
individuals, especially the minorities, are at greater risk of disease and deaths from covid-19.18,19,20 The
UK Office of National Statistics has reported that the age-standardized mortality rate from covid-19 in
the most deprived areas was 55.1/100,000 compared to 25.3/100,000 in the least deprived areas.21 In
USA, a study from New York reported that number of patients hospitalized/100,000 (moderate to severe
disease) population was the highest in the borough of Bronx (634) and lowest in Manhattan (331), and
number of deaths/100N000 population was also the highest in Bronx (224) and lowest in Manhattan
(122).22 The Bronx has the highest proportion of ethnic minorities, the most persons living in poverty and
the lowest levels of educational attainment as compared to other boroughs of New York. Clinical
registries from China, Europe and North America have highlighted a specific phenotype that is more
prone to mortality from this infection- older age, male sex, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, concomitant
cardiovascular disease and heart failure- especially in low socioeconomic status individuals.19,20,23,24,25
Because data on these variables is not available to us we cannot comment of association of these
comorbidities with risk of developing or dying from covid-19 in India. However, epidemiological studies
have consistently reported greater prevalence of elderly, obesity, hypertension, diabetes and
cardiovascular diseases at the urban locations in India.26,27,28,29
In the present study we have not evaluated the patient-level socioeconomic or ethnic characteristics
as such data are not available. However association of state-level development and healthcare related
characteristics show insignificant correlation when adjusted for urbanization (Table 3). On the other
hand, non-peer reviewed data from India has reported that more than two-thirds of the patients are
concentrated in 13 Indian cities.30 Initial concentration of patients in low socioeconomic status localities
within the urban locations has been reported.9 More studies regarding socioeconomic macro- and
micro-level determinants of covid-19 infection are required from India as it has been predicted that
covid-19 epidemic shall ultimately reside among the lower socioeconomic stratum in most countries.12
Public health strategies that have been successful in various high-income countries of Asia and
Europe have focused on widespread testing for covid-19 virus using appropriate technologies, social
(physical) distancing, quarantining of the cases using either hospital or home isolation and aggressive
and rapid tracing of contacts and their isolation.31 Other interventions include protection of healthcare
workers; monitoring hotspots; watching for imports; clear and honest communication; avoiding going

back to ‘normal’; and investing in finding alternate strategies.32 Consideration for economic effects,
social isolation, family relationships, health related behaviours, disruption to essential services,
disruption of education, traffic, transport and green spaces, social disorder and psychosocial impacts is
essential.33 Lockdown has led to both macro- micro-level adverse economic consequences in India and
most developing countries.34 Development of preventive medicines and vaccines is a work in progress.35
Controlled initiation of population-wide (herd) immunity has been suggested as the only alternative for
India,36 but if uncontrolled can lead to disastrous health consequences.
The essential urban nature of the disease and rapid spread of the disease in slums pose a challenge
to control the epidemic in India and similar countries.5 Urban locations in India and slums are least
prepared for the pandemic of covid-19 as most basic needs such as regular water supply, toilets, waste
collection and adequate and secure housing are almost non-existent.37 Interventions that have been
found useful in China and European countries may be impractical. Corburn et al suggest science-based
policies for arresting course of the disease, improving general medical care, provision of economic, social
and physical improvements, and focus on urban poor including migrants and slum-communities and
certain microlevel strategies.38 Focus on using social and behavioural science techniques is essential to
harness of benefits of such interventions.39 Focus on universal health coverage and creating resilient
health infrastructure is crucial.40,41 Lessons from the covid-19 epidemic should guide policymakers to
improve urban primary care and district hospitals.42
The present study shows that the covid-19 epidemic in India is still an urban phenomenon. It is
probably in an intermediate stage of epidemiological transition.9 Non-pharmaceutical and multifocal
policy level interventions are the most effective method to decrease the burden of this disease, although
randomised trials are needed.43 A judicious strategy targeted to the urban population, especially the
poor, with proper testing and containment, facilities for physical distancing and personal protection
would be the most appropriate intervention.
