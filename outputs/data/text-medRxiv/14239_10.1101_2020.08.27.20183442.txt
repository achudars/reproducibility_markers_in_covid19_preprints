ABSTRACT <<250 of maximum 250 words>>
BACKGROUND
COVID-19 is associated with immune dysregulation and hyperinflammation. Tocilizumab is
an anti–interleukin-6 receptor antibody.
METHODS
Patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 pneumonia receiving standard care were
randomized (2:1) to double-blinded intravenous tocilizumab 8 mg/kg or placebo. The primary
outcome measure was clinical status on a 7-category ordinal scale at day 28 (1,
discharged/ready for discharge; 7, death).
RESULTS
Overall, 452 patients were randomized; the modified-intention-to-treat population included
294 tocilizumab-treated and 144 placebo-treated patients. Clinical status at day 28 was not
statistically significantly improved for tocilizumab versus placebo (P=0.36). Median (95%
CI) ordinal scale values at day 28: 1.0 (1.0 to 1.0) for tocilizumab and 2.0 (1.0 to 4.0) for
placebo (odds ratio, 1.19 [0.81 to 1.76]). There was no difference in mortality at day 28
between tocilizumab (19.7%) and placebo (19.4%) (difference, 0.3% [95% CI, –7.6 to 8.2];
nominal P=0.94). Median time to hospital discharge was 8 days shorter with tocilizumab than
placebo (20.0 and 28.0, respectively; nominal P=0.037; hazard ratio 1.35 [95% CI 1.02 to
1.79]). Median duration of ICU stay was 5.8 days shorter with tocilizumab than placebo (9.8
and 15.5, respectively; nominal P=0.045). In the safety population, serious adverse events
occurred in 34.9% of 295 patients in the tocilizumab arm and 38.5% of 143 in the placebo
arm.

In this randomized placebo-controlled trial in hospitalized COVID-19 pneumonia patients,
tocilizumab did not improve clinical status or mortality. Potential benefits in time to hospital
discharge and duration of ICU stay are being investigated in ongoing clinical trials.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly developed into a global health threat since
emerging in China in late 2019.1 Severe COVID-19 pneumonia, occurring in approximately
15% of patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2), is associated with high mortality rates and places extensive burden on intensive care units
to provide mechanical ventilation and other advanced forms of life support.2,3 Similar to
Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome and SARS-CoV-1,4 an initial phase of COVID-19
with high viral replication precedes a second disease phase that may be driven by the host
immune response. This can lead to rapid increase in proinflammatory cytokines, an
uncontrolled inflammatory response, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and
multiple organ failure.4,5 Interleukin-6 levels correlate with COVID-19 severity,6,7 suggesting
that, in this setting, immune dysregulation and ARDS might be influenced by interleukin-6.5,8
Accumulation of lymphocytes and inflammatory monocytes, endotheliitis, apoptosis,
thrombosis, and angiogenesis in the pulmonary vasculature of patients with COVID-19
suggests that vascular inflammation and dysfunction contribute to the pathophysiology of
severe COVID-19 pneumonia.9,10 Interleukin-6 promotes endothelial dysfunction and
development of vascular permeability and might play a role in the vascular dysfunction of
this disease.11
The potential role of interleukin-6 in COVID-19 pneumonia5,8 provides rationale for
investigation of interleukin-6 signaling inhibitors. Tocilizumab is a monoclonal anti–
interleukin-6 receptor-alpha blocking antibody used to treat certain inflammatory diseases.12
Improvements in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia who received tocilizumab were
observed in case reports13-15 and supported by retrospective observational cohort studies that
showed rapid reduction in fever, reduced need for oxygen support and mechanical
ventilation, and improvement in lung manifestations.16-21

This is the first global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to investigate
whether tocilizumab has clinical benefit in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19
pneumonia.

PATIENTS AND METHODS
Trial Design and Oversight
COVACTA is a global, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3
trial investigating the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in patients with severe COVID-19
pneumonia (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04320615). Patients 18 years or older with severe
COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed by positive polymerase chain reaction test in any body
fluid and evidenced by bilateral chest infiltrates on chest x-ray or computed tomography were
enrolled. Eligible patients had blood oxygen saturation ≤93% or partial pressure of
oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen <300 mm/Hg. Patients were excluded if the treating
physician determined that death was imminent and inevitable within 24 hours or if they had
active tuberculosis or bacterial, fungal, or viral infection other than SARS-CoV-2. Standard
care per local practice (antiviral treatment, low-dose steroids, convalescent plasma,
supportive care) was permitted; however, concomitant treatment with another investigational
agent (except antivirals) or any immunomodulatory agent was prohibited. Informed consent
was obtained for all enrolled patients. The study was conducted in accordance with the
International Council for Harmonization E6 guideline for good clinical practice and the
Declaration of Helsinki or local regulations, whichever afforded greater patient protection.
The protocol was reviewed by institutional review boards or ethics committees.
Eligible patients were randomized (2:1) to receive intravenous tocilizumab (8 mg/kg infusion,
maximum 800 mg) or placebo plus standard care using an interactive voice or web-based

response system and permuted-block randomization. Randomization was stratified by
geographic region (North America, Europe) and mechanical ventilation (yes, no). If clinical
signs or symptoms did not improve or worsened (defined as sustained fever or worsened
ordinal scale clinical status), a second infusion could be administered 8 to 24 hours after the
first. The primary analysis was performed at day 28, and the final study visit occurred at day
60.
Outcome Measures
The primary efficacy outcome was clinical status assessed on a 7-category ordinal scale (1,
discharged or ready for discharge; 2, non–intensive care unit [ICU] hospital ward, not
requiring supplemental oxygen; 3, non–ICU hospital ward, requiring supplemental oxygen; 4,
ICU or non–ICU hospital ward, requiring noninvasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen; 5,
ICU, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation; 6, ICU, requiring extracorporeal
membrane oxygenation or mechanical ventilation and additional organ support; 7, death) at
day 28. Clinical status was recorded at baseline and every day during hospitalization. Key
secondary efficacy endpoints were clinical status at day 14 on the 7-category ordinal scale,
mortality at day 28, ventilator-free days to day 28, time to improvement from baseline in ≥2
categories on the 7-category ordinal scale, and time to hospital discharge (or ready for
discharge [defined as normal body temperature and respiratory rate and stable oxygen
saturation on ambient air or ≤2 L supplemental oxygen]). Other secondary endpoints included
time to clinical failure defined as death, withdrawal during hospitalization, mechanical
ventilation, or ICU transfer (for patients intubated or in the ICU at baseline, a 1-category
worsening of clinical status was considered clinical failure); incidence of mechanical
ventilation (among those not mechanically ventilated at randomization); incidence of ICU
transfer (among those not in ICUs at baseline); and duration of ICU stay. Adverse events

were recorded according to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities system organ class
and preferred term.
Statistical Analysis
Efficacy was assessed in the modified-intention-to-treat (mITT) population (any randomized
patients who received study medication) for the primary and secondary endpoints according
to treatment assigned at randomization. Analyses were stratified by region and mechanical
ventilation status at randomization except for some subgroup analyses, as specified. The
primary endpoint compared distribution of the ordinal scale of clinical status between
treatment groups using a nonparametric van Elteren test. The ratio of the odds of being in a
better clinical status category for tocilizumab versus placebo was determined using a
proportional odds model to give odds ratios and 95% CIs. Data from the last available
postbaseline assessment on the ordinal scale were used for patients who withdrew before day
28, and all deaths and hospital discharges were carried forward. Differences in mortality were
analyzed using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test, differences in the number of ventilatorfree days were assessed using the van Elteren test, and time-to-event secondary endpoints
were assessed using a log-rank test with Kaplan-Meier plots produced (deaths were rightcensored for all time-to-event endpoints assessing improvement). Cumulative incidence plots
were generated using the nonparametric Aalen-Johansen estimator, where death is a
competing risk. Safety was assessed in the safety-evaluable population (all patients who
received any study medication) according to treatment first received. An estimated mITT
population sample size of 450 patients randomized to tocilizumab or placebo was determined
to give 90% power for the primary endpoint using the van Elteren test and an assumed
distribution of the ordinal scale (Appendix 2). If significance was met, mortality at day 28
would be tested at the 5% level, but no other adjustment for multiplicity was planned.

RESULTS
Patients
Overall, 479 patients from 9 countries (Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy,
Netherlands, Spain, United Kingdom, United States) were screened, 452 patients were
randomized, and 438 received study treatment (Figure 1). The mITT population included 294
patients randomized to tocilizumab and 144 to placebo. The safety population included 295
and 143 patients, respectively, because 1 patient randomized to placebo received tocilizumab.
Overall, 224 of 301 patients (74.4%) randomized to tocilizumab and 108 of 151 patients
(71.5%) randomized to placebo completed the 28-day follow-up. Excluding those who died,
20 patients (6.6%) from the tocilizumab arm and 14 (9.3%) from the placebo arm
discontinued before day 28; none discontinued because of safety reasons.
Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were generally balanced between
treatment arms. Approximately 70% of patients in each arm were men; 176 patients (59.9%)
were white and 40 (13.6%) were black in the tocilizumab arm compared with 76 (52.8%) and
26 (18.1%), respectively, in the placebo arm. Mean age was 60.9 ±14.6 years in the
tocilizumab arm and 60.6 ±13.7 years in the placebo arm.
At baseline or any time during the study, lower proportions of patients in the tocilizumab
than the placebo arm received steroids (106 [36.1%] vs 79 [54.9%]), antiviral treatment (87
[29.6%] vs 51 [35.4%]), and convalescent plasma (10 [3.4%] vs 6 [4.2%]) (Table 1).

The primary endpoint was not met; clinical status on the 7-category ordinal scale at day 28
was not statistically significantly improved for tocilizumab versus placebo (van Elteren
P=0.36). Median (95% CI) 7-category ordinal scale clinical status values at day 28 were 1.0
(1.0 to 1.0) for tocilizumab and 2.0 (1.0 to 4.0) for placebo; ordinal logistic regression odds
ratio was 1.19 (0.81 to 1.76) (Table 2, Figure S1). Missing data were minimal for the primary
endpoint of clinical status for the mITT population (3.7% tocilizumab, 2.1% placebo).
Secondary Outcomes
All P values for secondary endpoints are nominal because the primary endpoint was not met.
Median (95% CI) clinical status values on the 7-category ordinal scale at day 14 were 3.0 (2.0
to 4.0) in the tocilizumab arm and 4.0 (3.0 to 5.0) in the placebo arm (van Elteren P=0.05;
odds ratio 1.42 [0.99 to 2.05]) (Table 2, Figure S2A). Fifty-eight patients (19.7%) in the
tocilizumab arm and 28 (19.4%) in the placebo arm died by day 28 (weighted difference,
0.3% [95% CI –7.6% to 8.2%]; Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel P=0.94) (Table 2). The median
(95% CI) number of ventilator-free days was 22.0 (18.0 to 28.0) with tocilizumab and 16.5
(11.0 to 26.0) with placebo (difference, 5.5 [–2.8 to 13.0]; van Elteren P=0.32) (Table 2).
Median (95% CI) time to improvement from baseline in ≥2 categories on the 7-category
ordinal scale was 14 days (12 to 17) in the tocilizumab arm and 18 days (15 to 28) in the
placebo arm (log rank P=0.08; Cox proportional hazards ratio 1.26 [95% CI 0.97 to 1.64])
(Table 2, Figure 2A). Median (95% CI) time to hospital discharge/ready for discharge was 20
days (17 to 27) in the tocilizumab arm and 28 days (20 to nonevaluable) in the placebo arm
(log rank P=0.04; Cox proportional hazards ratio 1.35 [1.02 to 1.79]) (Table 2, Figure 2B).
Median duration of ICU stay was 9.8 days in the tocilizumab arm and 15.5 days in the
placebo arm (difference, –5.8 days [95% CI –15.0 to 2.9]; van Elteren P=0.05) (Table 2).
Cumulative incidences of time to improvement in clinical status, time to hospital
discharge/ready for discharge, and mortality are shown in Figure S3.

Subgroup Analyses
Among 122 patients with baseline ordinal scale category 3 and 133 patients with baseline
category 4, odds ratios (95% CIs) for improved clinical status at day 28 were 1.27 (0.48 to
3.37) and 1.59 (0.78 to 3.24), respectively; among 60 patients with baseline category 5 and
108 patients with baseline category 6, odds ratios for improved clinical status were 1.10 (0.38
to 3.15) and 0.88 (0.44 to 1.78), respectively (Figure 2C, Figure S2B). There was no
significant difference in clinical status on the ordinal scale at day 28 between tocilizumab and
placebo among patients mechanically ventilated at randomization (median [95% CI], 5.0 [3.0
to 5.0] (n=111) vs 5.0 [4.0 to 6.0] (n=54); odds ratio 1.04 [0.58 to 1.85]) or those not
mechanically ventilated at randomization (1.0 [1.0 to 1.0] (n=183) vs 1.0 [1.0 to 1.0] (n=90);
odds ratio 1.34 [0.79 to 2.27]) (Figure S4).
The incidence of mechanical ventilation among patients not mechanically ventilated at
randomization was 27.9% (51/183) in the tocilizumab arm and 36.7% (33/90) in the placebo
arm (weighted difference, –8.9% [95% CI –20.7% to 3.0%]; Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel
nominal P=0.14). The incidence of ICU transfer among patients not in ICUs at baseline was
23.6% (30/127) in the tocilizumab arm and 40.6% (26/64) in the placebo arm (weighted
difference, –17.2% [95% CI –31.3% to –3.0%]; Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel nominal P=0.01).
In post hoc analysis, among patients not mechanically ventilated at randomization, 53 of 183
(29.0%) in the tocilizumab arm and 38 of 90 (42.2%) in the placebo arm experienced clinical
failure (includes those who died, withdrew during hospitalization, were transferred to an ICU,
or required invasive mechanical ventilation within 28 days of baseline, as defined in
Methods) (hazard ratio 0.614; 95% CI 0.40 to 0.94; nominal P=0.03).

In the safety population, adverse events were reported in 77.3% of 295 patients in the
tocilizumab arm and 81.1% of 143 patients in the placebo arm through day 28 (Table 3);
serious adverse events were reported in 34.9% and 38.5%, respectively. Fatal events occurred
in 58 patients (19.7%) in the tocilizumab arm and 28 (19.6%) in the placebo arm through day
28. The most commonly reported cause of death was COVID-19 pneumonia. Adverse events
of special interest for tocilizumab were generally balanced between treatment arms. No
tocilizumab-treated patients experienced anaphylaxis. Seventy-six serious infections were
reported in 62 patients (21.0%) in the tocilizumab arm and 49 in 37 patients (25.9%) in the
placebo arm through day 28. Similar proportions of patients in each treatment arm
experienced adverse events and serious adverse events through the clinical cutoff date of June
24, 2020 (Table S1).

DISCUSSION
COVACTA, the first randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of tocilizumab in
COVID-19 pneumonia, included patients from 9 countries. The primary endpoint was not
met; there was no significant difference between tocilizumab plus standard care and placebo
plus standard care in clinical status assessed using a 7-category ordinal scale at day 28, and
no mortality benefit was demonstrated. However, tocilizumab appeared to be safe, and
potentially clinically meaningful benefits were identified in time to hospital discharge/ready
for discharge and duration of ICU stay. Among patients not mechanically ventilated at
randomization, fewer treatment failures (progression to mechanical ventilation, ICU
admission, or death) occurred in tocilizumab-treated than placebo-treated patients. Because
the primary endpoint of the study was not met, these findings require validation in additional
studies. Adverse events, including those of special interest for tocilizumab (bleeding events,

hepatic events, cardiac events), were generally balanced between tocilizumab and placebo,
and incidences of infections or serious infections were lower in the tocilizumab arm.
The design and conduct of clinical trials in patients with COVID-19 present unique
challenges and limitations. The COVACTA study population was intentionally chosen to be
heterogeneous with regard to patient characteristics, previous/concurrent treatments, and
disease severity to allow assessment of potential benefit across a broad range of patients and
to reflect real-world practice in the expanding pandemic. Despite this heterogeneity, the
proportion of patients discharged or ready for discharge by day 28 was higher in the
tocilizumab arm than the placebo arm across the baseline ordinal scale of clinical status
categories, whereas no consistent pattern was observed for mortality. The lack of
standardized treatment across study sites and countries is an important limitation of this study
considering potential interactions with antivirals and steroids. More patients in the placebo
arm than the tocilizumab arm received concomitant steroids, which might have created bias
toward lower mortality in the placebo arm22; however, this imbalance is unlikely to have
obscured a significant treatment effect because the mortality rate was similar between
treatment arms regardless of steroid use and was higher in patients who received steroids in
both treatment arms than in those who did not (Table S2). Since our study was initiated,
standard care treatment and understanding of the natural history of COVID-19 and its
associated complications have evolved substantially. Based on current knowledge, optimal
endpoints for clinical trials and effective treatments are likely to be different for different
stages of disease. Future trials should be more narrowly focused or much larger to allow for
further stratification based on disease severity and other baseline characteristics.
Results of this study must be interpreted in the context of therapies for severe
COVID-19. Among treatments for patients hospitalized with COVID-19 investigated in
randomized controlled trials, dexamethasone reduced mortality in patients receiving

mechanical ventilation or supplemental oxygen at randomization, but not in patients not
receiving respiratory support.22 Remdesivir shortened time to recovery, but there was no
statistically significant difference in 14-day mortality.23 Clinical trials investigating potential
treatments—including other antivirals, anti-inflammatories, other targeted
immunomodulators (sarilumab, anakinra, baricitinib, canakinumab), anticoagulants, and
antifibrotics (tyrosine kinase inhibitors)—are underway,24 but the urgent need for effective
treatments remains. In the absence of a more effective therapy, treatments such as
tocilizumab, which this study suggests might hasten recovery and decrease the need for
intensive care without increasing the risk for infections, serious infections, or other adverse
events, might be clinically useful, even without a demonstrated mortality benefit.
Additional studies are ongoing and might expand the findings of COVACTA and
address outstanding scientifically and medically relevant questions regarding the risk/benefit
profile of tocilizumab in COVID-19 in more narrowly defined patient populations and in
conjunction with current treatments.

7-category ordinal scale: 1, discharged or ready for discharge; 2, non–ICU hospital ward, not
requiring supplemental oxygen; 3, non–ICU hospital ward requiring supplemental oxygen; 4, ICU or
non–ICU hospital ward, requiring noninvasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen; 5, ICU, requiring
intubation and mechanical ventilation; 6, ICU, requiring ECMO or mechanical ventilation and
additional organ support; 7, death.
(A, B) Data are plotted as one minus the Kaplan-Meier estimator. Patients who discontinued or were
lost to follow-up for any reason before the event were censored at their last ordinal scale assessment.
Patients who died were censored at day 28. (C) Death or hospital discharge were carried forward,
including deaths that occurred after withdrawal. Any remaining missing data were imputed using the
last postbaseline observation carried forward method.

Category 6 includes a patient who died on study day 1 (ordinal category 7) but was in category 6 on
day 1 before receiving study treatment; this patient was not included in the calculation of medians.
NE, not evaluable.
