Abstract

Background

43

Reported mortality of hospitalised COVID-19 patients varies substantially, particularly in critically ill

44

patients. So far COVID-19 in-hospital mortality and modes of death under optimised care conditions

45

have not been systematically studied.

46

Methods

47

This retrospective observational monocenter cohort study was performed after implementation of a

48

non-restricted, dynamic tertiary care model at the University Medical Center Freiburg, an

49

experienced ARDS and ECMO referral center. All hospitalised patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-

50

2 infection were included. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality, secondary endpoints

51

included major complications and modes of death. A multistate analysis and a Cox regression analysis

52

for competing risk models were performed. Modes of death were determined by two independent

53

reviewers.

54

Results

55

Between February 25, and May 8, 213 patients were included in the analysis. The median age was 65

56

years, 129 patients (61%) were male. 70 patients (33%) were admitted to the intensive care unit

57

(ICU), of which 57 patients (81%) received mechanical ventilation and 23 patients (33%)

58

extracorporeal membrane-oxygenation (ECMO) support. According to the multistate model the

59

probability to die within 90 days after COVID-19 onset was 24% in the whole cohort. If the levels of

60

care at time of study entry were accounted for, the probabilities to die were 16% if the patient was

61

initially on a regular ward, 47% if in the ICU and 57% if mechanical ventilation was required at study

62

entry. Age ≥65 years and male sex were predictors for in-hospital death. Predominant complications

63

– as judged by two independent reviewers – determining modes of death were multi-organ failure,

64

septic shock and thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications.

65

Conclusion

66

In a dynamic care model COVID-19-related in-hospital mortality remained substantial. In the absence

67

of potent antiviral agents, strategies to alleviate or prevent the identified complications should be

68

investigated. In this context, multistate analyses enable comparison of models-of-care and treatment

69

strategies and allow estimation and allocation of health care resources.

74

Background

75

The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is a public health emergency of international concern, which

76

poses immense challenges on health care systems (1). Although modulated by host factors like age

77

and comorbidities, overall about 10-15% of SARS-Cov-2 infected patients require hospitalisation and

78

20-30% of hospitalised patients develop critical or life-threatening COVID-19 manifestations (2).

79

Reported mortality rates of COVID-19 patients are in the range of 20-40% (1;3-5) for hospitalised

80

patients and 30-88% for critically-ill or ICU patients with substantial differences between countries

81

and regions (3-10). Several reasons may account for the observed wide range of these estimates.

82

Referral strategies to the hospital may differ. A high local COVID-19 incidence may put pressure on

83

health care systems leading to restrictions in care with the need to triage patients, and possibly

84

results in high numbers of infected health care workers. Moreover, intensive care unit (ICU) and

85

therefore ventilation and extracorporeal membrane-oxygenation (ECMO) capacities may

86

substantially vary, which may influence e.g. admission strategies and decisions on treatment

87

withdrawal.

88

Compared to neighbouring countries, in Germany the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic started later, with single

89

cases at the end of February. This delay provided the health care system and particularly the

90

inpatient sector with valuable time to prepare for a rising case load, and therefore allowed to avoid

91

inpatient bed and ICU capacity shortages. The Freiburg University Medical Center, a center with

92

profound expertise in ARDS treatment and ECMO support, formed a Coronavirus task force at the

93

end of January 2020. In the following weeks a COVID-19 dynamic care model was developed and

94

implemented. These preparations together with a relatively high SARS-CoV-2 testing capacity and

95

early lock-down strategies in Germany yielded a situation, in which regional treatment capacities

96

were sufficient at any stage of the pandemic and at any level of care despite a regional COVID-19

97

peak incidence of 120 cases/100.000 inhabitants per week at the beginning of April.

98

We hypothesised that this constitutes a unique opportunity to study the COVID-19-related morbidity

99

and mortality in patients requiring hospitalisation in a setting of non-restricted care. Here we briefly

100

outline the implemented dynamic care model and summarise the corresponding outcomes. Specific

101

aims of the study are i.) to assess COVID-19-related in-hospital mortality in a dynamic and non-

102

restricted care model at an ARDS and ECMO referral center; ii.) to define major complications and

103

modes of death in a setting of extended care with maximum supportive therapy; and iii.) to

104

propagate and stimulate reporting of clinical studies in COVID-19 research using multistate models.

108

The current study constitutes a post hoc analysis of data collected within a retrospective cohort study

109

conducted at the University Medical Center Freiburg. This 1,600-bed tertiary care institution serves

110

the southwest region of the German state of Baden-Württemberg and is one of the largest ARDS and

111

ECMO referral centers in Germany. All hospitalised patients with detection of SARS-CoV-2 using PCR

112

in a respiratory sample between February 25 and May 8, 2020 were eligible and included. The last

113

day of follow-up that was included was June 19.

114

Beginning in January 2020 the Coronavirus task force at the University Medical Center Freiburg

115

developed a dynamic care model for COVID-19 patients (outlined in

116

Patients were treated on COVID-19 regular wards, COVID-19 intermediate care and intensive care

117

units (ICU) run by different departments. Patients were followed during their hospital stay by

118

Infectious Diseases (ID) physicians performing daily COVID-19 rounds or being involved via the ID

119

consultation service. The measures implemented in the COVID-19 response, the evolution of the

120

peak incidences in the region and the corresponding number of admissions in our center are shown

Variables collected and definitions

124

Demographic variables, comorbidities, diagnostic procedures and data on treatment modalities,

125

complications and outcome were extracted by reviewing the admission, transfer and discharge

126

reports and the electronic patient record. Patients were followed until hospital discharge or death.

127

Comorbidities were recorded in the following eight categories: lung disease (COPD or other chronic

128

pulmonary disease), heart disease (coronary artery disease/ischemic cardiomyopathy or heart failure

129

NYHA II-IV), diabetes mellitus, chronic liver disease (Child B or C), active malignancy, primary or

130

secondary immunodeficiency (the latter being immunosuppressive drugs incl. corticosteroids of

131

≥20mg/day prednisolone-equivalent), obesity (body mass index [BMI]>30kg/m²) and neurological

132

disease (dementia, stroke or Parkinson’s disease). For Cox regression analysis patients were divided

133

into the groups ‘no comorbidity’ and ‘at least one comorbidity’ present. Hospital-acquired COVID-19

134

was assumed in the setting of prolonged hospitalisation and if contact tracing yielded contact with

135

other COVID-19 patients or health-care workers in the hospital as the only relevant exposure.

136

A thorough case review by two independent investigators (intensivists [ICU patients] or ID physicians)

137

concerning complications and modes of death was performed for all patients. All discrepancies

138

between the two reviewers were reviewed and resulted in an additional assessment by a third

139

investigator in order to obtain a final decision. A detailed documentation of this review process is

140

outlined in Supplementary Table 1.

141

Classification of ARDS severity was performed according to the Berlin Definition (11). Indication for

142

ECMO support was in accordance with the guidelines of the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization

143

(ELSO) (12) and did not deviate from usual indications. Multi-organ failure (MOF) was defined as

144

combination of two or more severe organ system dysfunctions. Predominant terminal organ failure

145

during dying process was defined as severe organ dysfunction that either resulted directly in

146

patient´s death or in withdrawal of life support. Concerning the categories ‘Life support in dying

147

process’ and ‘Involvement of COVID-19’, patients were allocated to one category. Reviewers

148

designated each death to ‚related to COVID-19‘ or ‚unrelated to COVID-19‘.

149

Ethical consideration

150

The study and data collection were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University

151

Medical Center Freiburg (348/20) and was registered in the German Clinical Trials Register (identifier

152

DRKS00021775). We followed the ethical standards set by the Helsinki Declaration of 1964, as

153

revised in 2013, and the research guidelines of the University of Freiburg. The Institutional Review

154

Board of the University Medical Center Freiburg considered the collection of routine data as

155

evaluation of service and waived the need for written informed consent.

156

Statistical analysis

157

The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality. Secondary endpoints included major complications

158

and modes of death. Baseline epidemiological and clinical characteristics, complications and

159

outcomes of patients with and without ICU stay were compared using the t-test or Mann-Whitney-U-

160

test for continuous variables and the χ2 test or Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables.

161

We performed a multistate analysis to investigate the mean length of hospitalisation, the mean

162

duration of mechanical ventilation (MV) and ECMO as well as the risks of death and discharge. The

163

model is shown in

164

hospitalisation in a ‘regular ward’, ‘ICU’, ‘MV’, ‘ECMO’ as well as ‘discharge alive’ and ‘death’.

165

Patients entered the study at the time of hospitalisation due to COVID-19 or at the time of a positive

166

SARS-CoV-2-PCR (in hospital-acquired COVID-19 cases) and were under observation until discharge or

167

death. We accounted for the fact, that some patients were directly admitted to the ICU either with or

168

without MV. A patient requiring ECMO was defined to have at least 0.5 days of MV beforehand and

169

(in case the patient did not die under ECMO) afterwards.

170

For the risk factor analysis, we used a competing risks model to study effects on the time from

171

hospitalisation to death in the hospital. In this model, the different states of hospitalisation (regular

172

ward, ICU, MV, ECMO) were not differentiated. First, we estimated cause-specific hazard ratios for

173

death and discharge. These gave information on both direct and indirect effects on the risk of in-

174

hospital death. Then, we estimated the subdistribution hazard ratio of death, which quantifies the

Epidemiological and clinical characteristics

181

A total of 213 COVID patients were included in the study (Table 1). The median age was 65 years, 129

182

patients (61%) were male. Fifty cases (23%) were considered to be hospital-acquired infections.

183

While 56 patients (26%) were without significant comorbidities, 79 patients (37%) reported one, and

184

78 patients (37%) two or more comorbidities, with coronary artery disease/ischemic cardiomyopathy

185

(21%), diabetes mellitus (20%) and obesity (BMI>30mg/m², 24%) being the most prevalent diseases.

186

The median time from onset of symptoms to hospitalisation was 6 days. Overall 27 patients (13%)

187

were ICU-referrals from regional hospitals due to complex respiratory or ARDS management and/or

188

the need of ECMO support. During hospitalisation 70 patients (33%) were admitted to the ICU

189

(median SAPS2-score of 46, median Horovitz-index on day 1 of ICU admission 110), of which 57

190

patients (81%) received invasive MV (median duration 17 days), and 23 patients (33%) needed ECMO

191

support (median duration 11 days, range 1-68 days) (Table

192

lopinavir/ritonavir (54 patients), hydroxychloroquine (92 patients), and remdesivir (1 patient). Seven

193

patients received tocilizumab. 161 out of 213 patients were discharged alive and 51 patients died. Of

194

the latter, 32 deaths occurred in the ICU (one death after ICU discharge) and 18 deaths on regular

195

wards. At the end of follow-up, one patient, though recovered from COVID-19, was still hospitalised

196

on a regular ward for treatment of an underlying malignancy.

197

Multistate model analysis

198

Considering all 213 patients in the described dynamic tertiary care model, the population averaged

199

probability to have died 90 days after hospitalisation with COVID-19 was 23.9%. The chance for being

200

discharged alive was 75,6%. There was a 0.5% chance to still be in the hospital after 90 days. A

care. These correspond to the coloured area between two curves.

205

By accounting for the levels of care when entering the study, i.e. regular ward, ICU, MV, the

multistate model allows for an estimation of the approximate length of hospital stay and the

admitted to a regular ward stayed on average 13.6 days in the hospital, 0.8 days in the ICU, 1.4 days

83%, the probability to die was 16%. In contrast, a patient that was admitted to the ICU needed 21.5

212

days in the ICU, 13.9 days of these with MV and 2.0 days with ECMO. The probability to be

213

discharged alive in the following 90 days was 52%, the probability to die was 47%. Patients that

214

directly required MV stayed 23.6 days on MV, and 8.0 days of these with ECMO. Once MV was no

215

longer required, the patient stayed on average 2.4 more days in the ICU and another 4.0 days on the

216

regular ward. The chances to be discharged alive were only 42%.

217

Multivariable cause-specific Cox regression analysis

218

The multivariable regression analysis constitutes a competing risks model with the endpoint in-

219

hospital death and the competing risk discharge alive. According to the cause-specific Cox regression

220

older patients have a higher death hazard (HR 3.45, 95% CI 1.49-7.98, for patients 65-74 years of age,

221

and HR 3.56, 95% CI 1.74-7.30 for ≥75 years-aged patients). Additionally, we found that the discharge

222

hazard is significantly decreased for males (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.50-0.94) (Table 3). A higher number of

223

comorbid conditions was not significantly associated with altered death or discharge hazards.

224

In the Fine and Gray model yielding subdistribution hazard ratios, the probability to die was

225

significantly increased for males (HR 1.90, 95% CI 1.04-3.48) and patients aged 65 years or older (HR

226

4.16, 95% CI 1.82-9.49 for age group 65-74 years, and HR 4.13, 95% CI 2.05-8.32 for ≥75 years of

227

age). For males the decreased discharge hazard leads to a prolonged length of stay and therefore

228

increased the risk of death in the hospital. The increased death risk for patients older than 65 is

229

explained by a direct effect on the death hazard. Stacked probability plots (Supplementary

Complications and presumed modes of death

235

According to the individual case review, ICU patients (both, survivors and non-survivors) suffered

236

from a multitude of complications (Table 2), the four dominant ones being septic shock in 43 patients

237

(61%), acute kidney injury with the need for renal replacement therapy in 26 of 70 patients (37%), as

238

well as thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications. Pulmonary embolism was diagnosed in 16

239

patients (23%). Replacement of extracorporeal devices due to thrombosis had to be performed in 11

240

of 26 patients (42%) on renal replacement therapy and 12 of 23 patients (52%) on ECMO. Ischemic

241

stroke occurred in 9 of 70 patients (13%). Major hemorrhagic manifestations were intracerebral

242

bleeding in 11 patients (16%) and pulmonary hemorrhage in 8 patients (11%).

243

As of June 19, 2020, 18 patients died on regular wards. The median age of these patients was 80

244

years – in accordance to the patients’ will, ICU transfer/treatment and MV was withheld in these

245

patients. Death was due to respiratory failure in 12 patients and multi-organ failure in 6 patients.

246

All but four patients that received ICU care succumbed due to multi-organ failure (Tables 2 and 4). A

247

median of three organ systems were involved with lung failure (32 patients), kidney/renal failure (24

248

patients), brain injury (17 patients), heart failure (14 patients) and gastrointestinal injury (13 patients,

249

in particular acute mesenteric ischemia) being the predominant terminal organ failures involved. In

250

21 of 33 patients (63%) septic shock was a critical complication considered to be relevant for multi-

251

organ failure and death.

252

Of 51 patients that died, death was presumed to be secondary to COVID-19 in 30 patients with

253

frailty/comorbidities. Sixteen patients (31%) without relevant comorbidities, i.e. without underlying

254

diseases impacting on life expectancy, died due to COVID-19 or COVID-19-related complications.

255

Time points of death are depicted in the cohort plot in Supplementary Figure S4.

257

Discussion

258

The principal findings of this study are as follows. i.) In the implemented care model yielding non-

259

restricted conditions at an experienced ARDS and ECMO referral center, COVID-19-related in-

260

hospital-mortality remained high at around 25%. ii.) Older age and male sex were independent risk

261

factors for death. iii) In patients requiring ICU care, 1 out of 2 patients died with critical events being

262

lung and multi-organ failure, septic shock, and thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications. iv.)

263

In the setting of a referral center the average length of stay in the hospital for COVID-19 patients was

264

16 days if admittance was to a regular ward, 26.5 days for patients admitted to the ICU, and 30 days

265

in the case of initial MV in hospital. In the latter group 11 days of ECMO support were required.

266

In the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic solid estimates on patient outcomes such as mortality and

267

major complications, and on the required health service resources, are pivotal, yet difficult to

268

generate (13). Although COVID-19 studies are published at unprecedented frequency and speed,

269

comparability of studies is hampered by the use of different study designs, varying standards of

270

reporting and the statistical approaches used. So far, the majority of studies, particularly those in

271

critically-ill or ICU patients, reported on preliminary in-hospital mortality rates, as 23-72% of patients

272

were still hospitalised at the time of reporting (5;7-10).

273

We believe our study provides superior estimates on mortality, complications and length of stay, as

274

different study set up and analytical approaches compared to previous studies were employed. First,

275

by implementing a dynamic care model, we excluded that the need to triage patients, or the

276

availability of limited ICU capacities impacted on mortality rate in a major way. Moreover, given the

277

experience of a large interdisciplinary ARDS and ECMO referral center together with a highly active ID

278

service, the conditions to manage critically ill COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia and

279

development of ARDS adhered to highest international standards. However, the COVID-19 related in-

280

hospital mortality rate of 24% overall, of 47% in the ICU subgroup and of 57% in the MV subgroup

281

remained substantial even under maximal respiratory support with prolonged provision of ECMO and

282

other advanced therapies including prone-positioning. Of note, about one third of patients that died

283

were without relevant comorbidities and were believed to have a normal life expectancy prior to

284

SARS-CoV-2 infection.

285

The identified risk factors for death, namely age and male sex, are in line with findings of published

286

studies. Interestingly, usage of a competing risk model identified male sex to be associated with a

287

decreased discharge hazard, thereby contributing indirectly to an increased risk of death.

288

Comorbidities were either equally distributed or more often prevalent in the ICU subgroup, with the

289

only exception of immunodeficiency, which was more frequent in the Non-ICU group.

290

The present study comprises 70 ICU patients, including 23 patients with ECMO support. It is the first

291

study with a completed follow-up, as all patients were discharged from the ICU. The only patient still

292

in hospital has recovered from COVID-19. Importantly, our study provides detailed information on

293

complications and presumed modes of death. This detailed analysis reveals that in the course of

294

prolonged respiratory support a range of serious and outcome-relevant complications arise. The

295

observed pattern with multi-organ failure implicates that COVID-19, at least in critically ill patients,

296

should be regarded as a multi-system disease that reaches far beyond the respiratory tract and

297

severe ARDS. This is in line with recent reports on endothelial cell involvement and diffuse vascular

298

organ changes (14;15). Further investigations including histopathological analysis of organ biopsies

299

(ante- and post-mortem) are needed to elucidate critical organ involvement, as well as underlying

300

pathophysiological mechanisms. The high rate of thromboembolic complications corroborates recent

301

findings in case series and autopsy studies of a pronounced coagulopathy in severe COVID-19 (16-

302

19). The observed high incidence of septic shock possibly contributed to a compromised

303

microcirculation, but may also be a consequence thereof. However, given the severity of COVID-19 in

304

the ICU subgroup (indicated by the high proportion of moderate and severe ARDS, low Horovitz

305

indices and the high rate of complications) it is noteworthy that 1 out of 2 ICU patients could was

306

discharged alive.

307

In the context of COVID-19 randomised controlled trials cannot be realised for all treatment

308

modalities (pharmacological or supportive). Therefore data of observational studies will need to be

309

analysed and compared (20;21). In the current study we take advantage of a multistate model

310

analysis (22). This approach provides insights into time-dynamic effects and clinical outcomes, avoids

311

common survival biases, and acknowledges active cases by taking into account censoring. In addition

312

to the predicted probabilities for discharge and death, expected average durations in hospital can be

313

calculated for the different states (23). Visualisation using a stacked probability plot provides easy-to-

314

interpret, yet compact and comprehensive information on the patients’ clinical progress. This is in

315

line with the proposals of the WHO and the COMET initiative regarding endpoints in clinical COVID-

316

19 studies (24) . By applying such a multistate analysis our study provides firm estimates of in-

317

hospital mortality rates and allows a more precise calculation of required ICU and ECMO capacities

318

and therefore allocation of resources in a given care model (25).

319

Our study has limitations, primarily those inherent to its retrospective observational design. It is a

320

monocenter study, which may limit generalisability. Yet the monocentric design may be considered a

321

prerequisite to study treatment results in a specific care model at an experienced ARDS center. The

322

limited number of patients precluded an analysis of specific treatment strategies, both in terms of

323

antiviral or anti-inflammatory agents and time-sensitive supportive strategies. While the primary

324

endpoint of in-hospital death is reliably determined retrospectively, uncertainties remain in

325

evaluating the mode of death. We tried to minimize this uncertainty by performing individual case

326

review by two independent experienced physicians and explicitly avoiding causal assumptions.

327

Conclusions

328

In summary, our study delineates COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality under non-restricted

329

conditions. Thereby research needs that aim to minimize SARS-CoV-2-related complications are

330

identified. By using a multistate model solid estimates for required ICU and ECMO capacities are

331

provided. Finally, this work exemplifies, how best to report on COVID-19 studies to allow for

332

meaningful comparisons of different treatment and care modalities.

Stacked probability plot for the multistate model. The plot is based on the complete dataset (n=213)
and illustrates within a single graph the probabilities to be in a specific state over time as well as the
expected average mean duration spent in each state. The probability to be on a regular ward, in the
ICU, on mechanical ventilation (MV), on ECMO support, discharged alive or dead over the course of
time corresponds to the distance between two curves. The area between two curves corresponds to
the mean time spent in the specific states.

Patient flow in the dynamic care model established by the Task force Coronavirus (consisting of
representatives of the ID department, Emergency department, Virology and Infection control
Departments and the Pandemic Operational Committee of the University Medical Center Freiburg):
Patients from the outpatient setting or inter-hospital tranfers were evaluated in dedicated areas in
the emergency department. Confirmed COVID patients were distributed according to severity of
disease on regular wards with or without monitoring. Patients with suspicion of COVID were
admitted to separate holding areas. Unstable patients, ICU transfers or admissions to the ECMO
facility were managed via the ICU coordinator and allocated to dedicated ICU and ECMO facilities.

516
517
518

The dynamic care model included an escalation strategy, in which additional regular wards and ICU
beds were equipped, physicians and nursing staff were trained and these wards were subsequently
recruited upon utilisation of a certain threshold of COVID bed capacities.

The six state model considers the events hospitalisation in 1) regular ward, 2) ICU, 3) mechanical
ventilation (MV), 4) ECMO, 5) discharge and 6) death. The boxes represent the possible states a
patient may encounter and the arrows represent the possible transitions from one state to another.
Thus, the arrows between the states show which transitions are possible.
