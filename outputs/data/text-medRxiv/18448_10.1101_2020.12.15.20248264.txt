Abstract:
As increasing numbers of people recover from and are vaccinated against COVID-19, tests are
needed to measure levels of protective, neutralizing antibodies longitudinally to help determine
duration of immunity. We developed a lateral flow assay (LFA) that measures levels of
neutralizing antibodies in plasma, serum or whole blood. The LFA is based on the principle that
neutralizing antibodies inhibit binding of the spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) to
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The test classifies high levels of neutralizing
antibodies in sera that were titered using authentic SARS-CoV-2 and pseudotype neutralization
assays with an accuracy of 98%. Sera obtained from patients with seasonal coronavirus did not
prevent RBD from binding to ACE2.

As a demonstration for convalescent plasma therapy, we

measured conversion of non-immune plasma into strongly neutralizing plasma. This is the first
report of a neutralizing antibody test that is rapid, highly portable and relatively inexpensive that
might be useful in assessing COVID-19 vaccine immunity.

Introduction
The pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARSCoV-2) continues to be transmitted by person to person spread from its origin in Wuhan, China
in December 20191–3 . Vaccine trials are ongoing, and preliminary results from at least 2
vaccines appear to elicit protective immunity, but durability of vaccine responses is not known4.
Molecular tests such as PCR detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in nasopharyngeal
secretions and saliva and are diagnostic of infection5. These molecular tests can determine the
rate of infection, potential re-infection and, when negative, indicate when patients clear the
virus. In response to infection, all immunocompetent hosts generate antibodies against the
virus. Patients may have a positive serologic test result as well as a PCR-positive test result if
they are early in convalescence6,2–4. For SARS-CoV-2, antibodies to spike protein do not
always predict recovery from COVID197.
Almost everyone infected with SARS-CoV-2 generates antibodies against the virus.
However, since not all antibodies are created equal, it is essential to know which individuals
generate high levels of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) so that they can resume normal activities
without fear of being re-infected and spreading the virus to others8–10. The goal of COVID-19
vaccines is to induce NAbs that prevent infection/re-infection. Additionally, development of
NAbs indicates which individuals might be optimal donors for convalescent plasma protocols.
Although NAbs are important for elimination of the virus and protection from subsequent
infection, it has been reported by several groups that up to one-third of convalescent plasma
from individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 do not neutralize SARS-CoV-2 or spike
pseudotype virus infection11–13.
Viral neutralization assays measure levels of antibodies that block infection of host cells.
Two main types of viral neutralization assays are utilized for SARS-CoV-2. Authentic
neutralization assays measure reduction of viral plaques or infectious foci in microneutralization

assays in susceptible host cells using SARS-CoV-2 under BSL3 conditions. These assays are
slow, laborious, require highly trained personnel and require a BSL3 facility. Pseudotype virus
neutralization assays have been developed in which SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is expressed in
a virus such as vesicular stomatitis virus or lentivirus14,15. These assays are faster and less
dangerous than authentic neutralization assays, but still require BSL2 conditions and 24-48
hours for results. Another challenge is that both authentic and pseudovirus virus assays
depend on host cells for infection which adds variability to the assay.
It is known that SARS-CoV-2 uses RBD on spike protein to bind ACE2 on host cells and
appears to be the principal neutralizing domain of SARS-CoV-216,17. Using this knowledge, we
developed an LFA that measures levels of (neutralizing) antibodies which block RBD from
binding to ACE2. Other groups have developed RBD-ACE2-based competition ELISAs18,19 but
none have developed a rapid, highly portable semi-quantitative point-of-care (POC) test.

Methods
Human Subjects and Samples
Peripheral blood, serum and plasma were collected for this study under an Arizona State
University IRB approved protocol #0601000548 and Mayo Clinic IRB protocol #20-004544.
Plasma was obtained by ficoll gradient separation of peripheral blood and serum was obtained
by centrifugation 30 minutes after drawing blood. Plasma and serum samples obtained from
excess clinical samples at Mayo Clinic were pre-existing, de-identified and leftover from normal
workflow. COVID-19 samples ranged from 3 to 84 days post PCR diagnosis.

Pseudotype Virus and Authentic SARS-CoV-2 Neutralization Assays
Titers were obtained from 60 COVID-19 patient sera using a VSV spike protein
pseudotype assay as previously reported14. Inhibitory concentrations for which 50% of virus is
neutralized by serum antibodies (IC50 values) were obtained using a different set of 38 COVID-

19 sera in an authentic SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay using a recombinant SARS-CoV-2
that expresses mNeonGreen (SARS-CoV-2ng) during replication in permissive cells20. Sixty µl
aliquots of SARS-CoV-2ng were pre-incubated for 1 h in 5% CO2 at 37ºC with 60 µl serial 2-fold
serum dilutions, and 100 µl were inoculated into Vero-E6 monolayers in black polystyrene 96well plates with clear bottoms (Corning). Each serum was tested in duplicates. The final amount
of the virus was 200 PFU/well, and the starting serum dilution was 1:20. Cells were maintained
in Minimal Essential Medium (ThermoFisher Scientific) supplemented by 2% FBS (HyClone)
and 0.1% gentamycin in 5% CO2 at 37ºC. After 2 days of incubation, fluorescence intensity of
infected cells was measured at a 488 nm wavelength using a Synergy 2 Cell Imaging Reader
(Biotek). The signal readout was normalized to virus control aliquots with no serum added and
was presented as the percentage of neutralization. IC50 was calculated with GraphPadPrism 6.0
software. Work with infectious SARS-CoV-2ng was performed in a BSL-3 biocontainment
laboratory of the Galveston National Laboratory.
Lateral Flow Assay
The LFA contains a test strip composed of a sample pad and blood filter, conjugate pad,
nitrocellulose membrane striped with test and control lines, and an absorbent pad to wick
excess moisture (Axim Biotechnologies Inc, San Diego, CA). Test strips are secured in a
cassette that contains a single sample port (Empowered Diagnostics, Pompano Beach, FL). For
procedural control purposes, the LFA also contains a control mouse antibody conjugated to red
gold nanospheres and corresponding anti-mouse control line. Thus, a control line should be
visible in every assay. In the absence of a developed control line, results are not valid, and the
test should be repeated.
The test leverages the interaction between RBD-conjugated green gold nanoshells
(Nanocomposix, San Diego, CA) and ACE2, to detect RBD-NAbs in COVID-19 convalescent

plasma (CCP). As indicated by the competitive nature of this assay, test line density is inversely
proportional to RBD-NAbs present within the sample. Thus, an absent or faint test line indicates
high levels of RBD-NAbs, whereas a dark or strong test line suggests lack of RBD-NAbs within
a given plasma sample.
To demonstrate the ability of the test to measure NAbs in whole blood, 10µg of a
neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) based on the sequence of B-3821(Axim
Biotechnologies, Inc, San Diego, CA) was mixed with 10µl of normal donor whole blood
collected in a heparinized blood collection tube. Two-fold dilutions were made in whole blood to
a final concentration of 0.625µg neutralizing mAb. Then, 10µl of each dilution were transferred
to LFA cassettes, chased with 50µl running buffer, and read with an LFA reader after 10
minutes.
LFAs were performed at ambient temperature and humidity on a dry, flat surface and left
to run undisturbed for 10 minutes prior to reading results. First, 10µL of plasma or whole blood
were transferred to the cassette sample port and immediately followed by two drops (~50µL) of
chase buffer. After 10 minutes, each test was placed in a Detekt RDS-2500 LFA reader (Austin,
TX, USA) and the densities of both test and control lines were recorded electronically.
Conversion of Non-immune Normal Human Plasma (NIHP) into Neutralizing Plasma
To convert NIHP into strongly neutralizing plasma (SNP), plasma from a convalescent
donor who demonstrated the ability to block RBD from binding to ACE2 (M21) was mixed with
NHP collected prior to December 2019. For example, for a 1% mixture, 1ul of SNP was mixed
with 99ul NIHP; for a 5% mixture 5ul of SNP was admixed with 95 ul NIHP, etc. We performed
the test with 10ul of 1%, 5%, 10%, and 20% SNP admixed into NIHP.

Data Analysis
To establish and compare the validity of the LFA and the VITROS® Anti-SARS-COV-2
IgG assay (Ortho Clinical Diagnostics), regression analysis using IC50 values was performed to
evaluate consistency18 while Bland-Altman plots were constructed to assess agreement and
bias22,23. Regression analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel (Redmond, WA); BlandAltman plots were visualized using IBM SPSS (Armonk, NY). For two-group analysis, IC50 values
corresponding to >240 were categorized as titer of ≥1:320 (neutralizing), whereas IC50 values
≤240 were categorized as ≤1:160 (non-neutralizing). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
analysis was performed to assess classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the LFA
and Ortho methods in assessing neutralizing capacity; optimal cutoffs for each method were
established to maximize area under curve (AUC)24,25. ROC analysis was conducted using R
(version 3.6.2).

Results
The lateral flow assay reported here is a rapid 10-minute POC test. As shown in the
schematic in Figure 1, this test utilizes serum, plasma or whole blood to semi-quantitatively
measure levels of NAbs.

An example of strong, moderate and non-neutralizing sera is shown in Figure 2. As
diagrammed in Figure 1, levels of NAbs in serum or plasma are reflected by the intensity of the
test line which can be read on a hand-held densitometer or compared visually to a scorecard
(Supplemental Figure 1). Figure 2A is representative of highly neutralizing sera, while Figure
2B and 2C represent moderately neutralizing sera. Figure 2D represents sera that do not
contain NAbs or have undetectable levels of Nabs.

We tested serum samples with known neutralization titers from a VSV-based spike
pseudotype assay in our LFA. De-identified serum samples were sent from Mayo Clinic
Rochester to our laboratories. Personnel running the LFA were blinded to the titers of each
sample. After de-coding, the LFA tracked with serum titers, especially at higher titers and
correctly distinguished all non-neutralizing serum (Figure 3A).
To further support the application of our lateral flow test to measure levels of antibodies
that neutralize SARS-CoV-2, we tested a different set of 38 serum samples that were assigned

IC50 values in an authentic SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay20. Again, the experiment was
performed in a blinded manner such that personnel running either the LFA or the
microneutralization assay did not know the results of the comparator test. When line densities
from the LFA are plotted against IC50 values determined in the SARS-CoV-2 microneutralization
assay, serum samples with strong neutralization activity also demonstrate low line densities

Plasma from seasonal respiratory virus infections

Figure 4. Plasma samples collected with PCR-confirmed diagnosis of seasonal respiratory
viruses (OC43, blue; HKU-1, green; NL-63, pink; influenza A, orange, influenza B, red ;
parainfluenza, purple ; rhinovirus, teal ; respiratory syncycial virus, yellow ; and adenovirus,
black were run on the LFA as described in Methods. A positive control serum from a
convalenscent COVID-19 patient is shown on the far right of the bar graph in white. Cutoff
value of 263,000 density units was calculated based on receiver operating characteristic curves
in a later figure.

We evaluated how the Ortho assay and our LFA compared to IC50 values determined in
an authentic SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay using 38 COVID-19 sera (different from the 60
sera in Figure 3A with known titers). FDA guidance indicates that an Ortho VITROS SARS-CoV2 IgG assay of ≥12 meets a threshold for convalescent plasma use in patients with COVID-19.
To determine the agreement between our lateral flow assay and the Ortho VITROS SARS-CoV2 IgG assay, density units from our LFA and values from the Ortho test were regressed onto IC50
values (Figure 5). LFA values accounted for roughly 52% of observed variance inIC50 values,
while Ortho VITROS accounted for approximately 27% of IC50 variance. Since the format of the
LFA reports decreasing density values as neutralization increases, LFA was significantly inversely
correlated with IC50 values (r = -0.720, p < 0.001), while Ortho values showed a significant positive
correlation to IC50 values (r = 0.522, p = 0.001). Additionally, LFA and Ortho values showed a

Both LFA and Ortho values showed high agreement with titer, although Ortho showed a
tendency to underestimate neutralizing capacity while the LFA method showed no bias. As can
be seen in Figure 7B and 7D, the LFA misclassified one non-neutralizing sample (Neg—1:160)
as neutralizing (≥1:320). In contrast, Ortho misclassified that same non-neutralizing sample as
neutralizing, in addition to incorrectly classifying five additional neutralizing samples as non-

neutralizing. Importantly, our LFA method exhibited a greater dynamic range of differential values
as compared to Ortho (Figure 6), translating to superior classification accuracy of the LFA method
in detecting neutralizing samples (titer ≥ 1:320) compared to Ortho (Figure 7A and 7C).

samples (AUC = 0.978), while the Ortho assay showed modest accuracy for classification of
neutralizing samples (AUC = 0.856). Furthermore, while the LFA method showed a narrow
confidence interval (95% CI: 0.908—1.00), ROC analysis of Ortho values showed a wider range
(95% CI: 0.697—0.953), indicating less certainty. Notably, while both methods showed roughly
90% specificity, Ortho showed only 70% sensitivity. In contrast, the novel LFA method showed
perfect sensitivity (100%) in this analysis of 38 samples.
Optimal cutoffs were computed to maximize AUC. For the LFA, density unit values below
263,000 classify samples as neutralizing and correspond to titers ≥1:320. Density unit values
above this LFA cutoff classify samples in the non-neutralizing group. For the Ortho assay, values
between 0 and 23.3 were representative of non-neutralizing capacity, whereas values above 23.3
were reflective of the neutralizing group. If we used the FDA cutoff of 12 instead of the 23.3 value
calculated using our results, AUC would be reduced to 0.69 (sensitivity = 0.55, specificity = 0.83).
The principle of infusing convalescent plasma from recovered individuals into patients
fighting COVID19 is to transfer NAbs from the donor to the recipient as has been done for
several other diseases26–28. The rapid test described here, could quickly and efficiently classify
COVID19 convalescent plasma (CCP) units so that the sickest patients might receive the most
potently neutralizing plasma. Although levels of neutralizing antibody to achieve in patients
receiving CCP remains undefined, our point-of-care test might be useful at the bedside to
monitor a patient receiving highly neutralizing CCP as he/she begins to demonstrate NAbs in
circulation, as shown in Figure 8A. It could help in deciding whether to administer another unit
of highly neutralizing CCP to a patient fighting COVID19. The same scenario might also be
applied to hyperimmune gammaglobulin or neutralizing monoclonal antibody infusion.
To demonstrate the utility of our LFA to measure NAbs in whole blood, we used a lateral
flow strip with a blood filter and performed an experiment in which a neutralizing monoclonal

Discussion
Serologic tests that detect responses to infection are an important population
surveillance tool during pandemics because they provide data on pathogen exposure, especially

when a subset of the population is asymptomatic and would not have been diagnosed by
molecular methods29,30. While over 90% of individuals diagnosed with COVID19 generate
antibody responses29 we are only beginning to learn about the prevalence and duration of NAbs
induced by a natural infection. This lack of knowledge is mainly due to the fact that virus-based
neutralization assays require i) BSL2 or BSL3 facilities, ii) highly skilled personnel, iii)
permissive cells and quantified virus, and iv) take longer than 24 hours to obtain results. Since
every viral vaccine, including COVID19 vaccines, administered to humans is designed to elicit
antibodies that neutralize virus by blocking host cell infection, development of NAbs is a
hallmark of protection from disease. Therefore, there is a need for rapid, accurate tests that
measure levels of NAbs.
We developed a rapid, 10-minute lateral flow test that measures levels of NAbs in serum
and plasma. As shown in Figure 3, the lateral flow test correlates well with serologic titers
determined using a VSV-based pseudotype assay, and IC50 values in an authentic SARS-CoV-2
microneutralization assay, especially when serum sample titers are ≥640 and IC50 values
are >250. Samples with less potent NAbs in both viral assays correlated with decreased ability
to block RBD from binding to ACE2 in the LFAs.
The LFA and Ortho methods showed a strong, significant correlation with each other (r =
-0.572, p < 0.001), displaying an appreciable degree of linear relation31.

Importantly, LFA

accounts for 52% of observed IC50 variance (R2 = 0.5187) while, in comparison, Ortho accounts
for 27% (R2 = 0.2725). Although absolute quantitation of a construct demands an excellent
coefficient of determination (R2 ≥ 0.99)32, variables with R2 ≥ 0.5 are highly predictive in univariate
regression models while measures with R2 < 0.5 are recommended for use in multivariate models
in combination with complementary measures to increase predictive accuracy33,34. Additionally,
Bland-Altman analysis (Figure 6) showed Ortho to be prone to underestimation of IC50 values. In
contrast, the LFA method did not exhibit any over- or underestimation bias. Furthermore, across

mean values for both methods, LFA showed discrete differential values while Ortho struggled to
differentiate samples with high neutralizing capacity (IC50 values).

Since the Ortho Vitros IgG assay uses S1, which includes RBD, it is likely that antibodies
reactive with other parts of S1–even some that may neutralize via N-terminal domain–are
responsible for increased reactivity to S1 when they are not neutralizing in our RBD-ACE2
competition assay. Advantages of our POC test is that it can be inexpensively and rapidly
deployed in studies to determine levels of NAbs that protect against re-infection and limit
transmission of the virus. Moreover, rapid inexpensive tests can be used longitudinally to
evaluate duration of protective immunity in both naturally infected and many more vaccinated
individuals than could ever be evaluated using BSL2 or BSL3-based neutralization assays.

In the setting of much debated CCP, a rapid test could be used to measure levels of
NAbs in a CCP product prior to infusion, or potential donors who recovered from COVID-19.
During infusion of CCP, a rapid test could be used to help decide if a patient fighting COVID-19
requires another unit of highly neutralizing plasma. If a particular donor’s CCP has very high
levels of CCP, patients might need only one unit. On the other hand, if donor CCP contains
moderate levels of NAbs, the patient may require multiple units to achieve therapeutic levels of
NAbs. However, since we do not know what an adequate therapeutic dose of NAbs is, this
rapid test could be a valuable tool in trials to determine under what conditions CCP,
hyperimmune globulin, and neutralizing mAbs are effective therapeutic agents for COVID19
patients.

Limitations of the LFA are that it uses only the RBD portion of SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein. Although the vast majority of reports indicate that the principle neutralizing domain is
RBD portion of spike protein, mAbs have been reported that neutralize SARS-CoV-2 by binding

to the N-terminal domain of spike protein35,36. Also, since the spike protein assumes several
conformations during viral binding and entry37, neutralizing epitopes exist on the quaternary
structure of spike36. Although RBDs on the nanoparticles may associate, it is unlikely they
assume a native quaternary conformation.
Other limitations are the binary nature of the data analysis (neutralizing and nonneutralizing) of a continuous assay. Clearly, line densities demonstrate moderate levels of
neutralization. Since blood draws and subsequent assays are a “snapshot in time” of
neutralizing antibody activity, levels were undoubtedly increasing in some patients and
decreasing in others. LFAs are generally inexpensive and highly portable compared to other
laboratory-based tests, so neutralizing antibody levels could be measured using the LFA to
longitudinally assess protective neutralizing antibody immunity. Another limitation is that the
LFA does not differentiate high affinity anti-RBD NAbs from an abundance of lower affinity antiRBD NAbs. In related experiments, we have observed patient sera that bind strongly to RBD,
but do not demonstrate neutralizing activity (data not shown).
This test may prove very useful in monitoring COVID-19 vaccine recipients. Although
vaccines have now been approved for distribution and administration, durability of protective
immunity elicited by any COVID-19 vaccine is unknown. It is the goal of all COVID-19 vaccines
to induce protective NAbs. However, since clinical trials of vaccines have enrolled 30,000 to
60,000 participants, it is not logistically possible to draw a tube of blood from each vaccine
recipient longitudinally to determine duration of protective NAbs. Application of our test in
vaccine recipients using a drop of blood obtained from a finger-stick as shown in Figure 8B
might lead to more comprehensive longitudinal monitoring of increases and decreases in
protective humoral immunity.
