Background
In the most severe cases, Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) leads to acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS) that is characterized by alveolar epithelial and endothelial
injuries [1,2]. Evaluating the temporal changes of established alveolar tissue injury
markers[3] can provide insights regarding the time course and specific contribution of
alveolar epithelial and of endothelial injury to the pathogenesis of COVID-19 ARDS.
Recently, Spadaro et al. have reported that COVID-19 ARDS is characterized by the
increases of circulating endothelial injury markers[4]. However, the detailed temporal
characteristics of changes in these markers are still not clear. In this preliminary study,
we investigated the levels of a circulating alveolar epithelial injury marker; soluble
receptor for advanced glycation end-products (sRAGE), an endothelial injury marker;
angiopoietin-2 (ANG-2), and an alveolar barrier permeability indicator; surfactant
protein D (SP-D) in serum from COVID-19 patients with or without ARDS.

Methods
The patients diagnosed as COVID-19 by real-time polymerase chain reaction and
admitted to Yokohama City University Hospital from January to August 2020 were
included in this retrospective observational study (ethics reference number:

B200700100). Concentrations of sRAGE, ANG-2, and SP-D in the residual serum
samples were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (human RAGE:
DY1145, human ANG-2: DY623, human SP-D: DY1920, R&D systems, MN, USA).
We compared the concentrations of these markers on the first or second hospital day
between ARDS and non-ARDS patients. Moreover, we analyzed temporal changes of
these markers during the first eight hospital days in ARDS patients.
The data between ARDS and non-ARDS patients were compared with the
Mann-Whitney U test. Temporal changes of the markers were analyzed with Friedman
test and post-hoc Dunn’s test. The peak day of the each of the markers were analyzed
with Kruskal-Wallis test and post-hoc Dunn’s test. All statistical analyses were
performed using Prism 9.0 software (Graphpad Software, CA, USA). Statistical
significance level was set at P < 0.05.

Results
Eleven ARDS and ten non-ARDS patients, all with COVID-19, were included in the
study. Patient characteristics are shown in Table 1. The diagnosis of ARDS was made
on the first or second hospital day. The initial serum levels of sRAGE and SP-D were

significantly higher in the ARDS group than in the non-ARDS group, however the
ANG-2 level was not (Table.1).
Analysis of the temporal changes of these markers in ten ARDS patients excluding one
patient with missing data revealed that serum sRAGE level peaked just after admission,
and it gradually decreased with hospital days (Fig.1). In contrast, serum ANG-2 and
SP-D did not significantly decrease during first eight hospital days and the peak timings
of these markers were during a later disease stage (Fig.1).

Discussion
The present study indicates that alveolar epithelial injury occurring at the very early
disease stage, which is indicated by the increase in sRAGE level, is a hallmark of
COVID-19 ARDS pathogenesis. On the other hand, levels of ANG-2 peaked at later
time points, suggesting that the endothelial injury continue to exacerbate for several
days after admission. Moreover, the trajectory of ANG-2 level, rather than of sRAGE
level, was parallel with the trajectory of SP-D, an indicator of alveolar barrier
permeability. These data suggest that the endothelial injury contribute to the
exacerbation of the alveolar barrier disruption during the later disease stage.

The difference in the peak timing of epithelial and endothelial injury markers suggests
the distinct mechanisms for injury to each type of cell. A hypothesis generated from our
results is that the initial alveolar epithelial injury might be a trigger of the subsequent
endothelial injury. To obtain insights into the pathogenesis of alveolar tissue injury
during COVID-19, further studies are warranted.
