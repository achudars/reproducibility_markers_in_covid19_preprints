Key Points
Question

How well can a multivariable risk model predict the risk of hospitalization,

intensive care unit (ICU) stay, or death due to COVID-19 in patients with inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD)?

Findings

Multivariable prediction models developed using data from an international

voluntary registry of IBD patients and available for use online (https://covidibd.org/) have
very good discrimination for predicting hospitalization (Test set AUC 0.79) and excellent
discrimination for ICU admission (Test set AUC 0.88) and death (Test set AUC 0.94). The
models were developed with a training sample of 2009 cases and validated in an
independent test sample of 700 cases comprised of a random sub-sample of cases and all
cases entered in the registry during a one-month period after model development.

Meaning

This risk prediction model may serve as an effective tool for healthcare providers

to facilitate conversations about COVID-19-related risks with IBD patients.

Death

We assessed the resulting models’ discrimination using the area under the curve (AUC) of
the receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curves and reported the corresponding 95%
confidence intervals (CIs).

Results
We included 2709 cases from 59 countries (mean age 41.2 years [s.d. 18], 50.2% male). A
total of 633 (24%) were hospitalized, 137 (5%) were admitted to the ICU or intubated, and
69 (3%) died. 2009 patients comprised the training set and 700 the test set.

The models demonstrated excellent discrimination, with a test set AUC (95% CI) of 0.79
(0.75, 0.83) for Hospitalization+, 0.88 (0.82, 0.95) for ICU+, and 0.94 (0.89, 0.99) for Death.
Age, comorbidities, corticosteroid use, and male gender were associated with higher risk of
death, while use of biologic therapies was associated with a lower risk.

Introduction
Since the onset of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, almost 50

million cases have been reported globally. Many countries, including the United States

5

(US), are reporting record numbers of new cases as of November 2020 . While the majority

of cases are mild, patients with at least one comorbidity are at higher risk of adverse

6,7.

outcomes, including hospitalization, respiratory failure, or death

Risk calculators can

1

facilitate shared decision making between patients and healthcare providers , and such

tools have been created to predict death due to COVID-19 in US patients 65 years and

8

9

older , to determine hospitalization risk , and to guide early vaccine allocation.

Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are prescribed immunosuppressive

medications such as corticosteroids, immunomodulators, biologic therapies, and Janus-

10,11.

kinase inhibitors, which are linked with a higher risk of viral infection

To help

healthcare providers and patients navigate these myriad potential risk factors, we

developed and validated penalized multivariable logistic regression models for predicting

the probability of hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and death due to

COVID-19 in patients with IBD. We utilized an international registry of 2,709 IBD patients

with COVID-19 from 59 countries. We also developed a free, publicly available

personalized risk calculator utilizing the final models that is available online

https://covidibd.org/covid-19-risk-calculator/). Reporting follows Transparent reporting of a

study outcomes of COVID-19 in pediatric and adult IBD patients

SECURE-IBD is a

voluntary registry with ongoing data collection where healthcare providers can report

cases of COVID-19 in IBD patients, confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or

antibody testing. Healthcare providers are instructed to report cases of severe outcomes

after a minimum of seven days from the onset of symptoms and after a sufficient time has

passed to observe the disease course through the resolution of acute illness or death. In the

event that a patient’s status changed after submission, reporters are instructed to re-report

and contact the research team. Reporters were not explicitly informed of what data could

be used as predictors or outcomes, but being a voluntary registry, reporters were not

blinded. A fuller account of the data collection is given in Brenner et al. (2020)

Participants
We included all patients reported to the registry from March 13, 2020, the data collection

, 2020. For model development, a training sample consisting

start date, through October 20

of 85% of the entire surveillance data set available as of September 15, 2020 was used. The

random split was done using stratified random sampling based on an ordinal version of the

outcome. The test data set consisted of the remaining 15% of the data available on

September 15, plus all of the additional cases reported to the registry between September

16, 2020 and October 20, 2020.

Outcomes
We examined three primary outcomes: 1) hospitalization or death (Hospitalization+), 2)

ICU admission, mechanical ventilation or death (ICU+), and 3) death due to COVID-19

related causes (Death). Patients may experience multiple outcomes. All outcomes were

reported by the patient’s healthcare provider at the time of the case report.

Predictors
As our aim was to create models and a risk stratification tool intended to allow physicians

to inform patients of their risk before presenting with COVID-19, we restricted our

attention to predictors that would be available during a routine consultation. COVID-19

presenting symptoms and information about the COVID-19 treatment received were

therefore not included in this analysis. All predictors were reported by the patients’

healthcare provider.

A full description of the predictors is available in

Supplement document eTable 1.

Demographic predictors included age, country of residence, state of residence (for US

cases), gender, race, and ethnicity. Racial indicators included White, Black, and Asian.

American Indian and Pacific Islander indicators were excluded due to low prevalence.

Multi-racial patients belong to multiple categories. As only one patient had reported a

gender other than male or female, only two genders were considered in the analysis. Due to

the nature of reporting, ethnicity, gender, and race should be interpreted as provider-

perceived race and gender. Assessing race and ethnicity is important for identifying

potential health inequities in COVID-19 related outcomes. For cases from US states with

very low prevalence in the registry, a more general geographic predictor (census region or

census division) was used in place of the state itself. Clinical predictors included height,

weight, body mass index (BMI, study derived), IBD diagnosis [Crohn’s disease (CD),

ulcerative colitis (UC), or IBD unspecified (IBDU)], and IBD disease activity as defined by

physician global assessment. We also included IBD medication indicators for overall drug

category (e.g., biologic therapy) and subcategory [e.g., anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)] at

the time of COVID-19 diagnosis. Additionally, dosage information was included for

prednisone, 6-mercaptopurine, and azathioprine.

For categorical (including binary) predictors without a meaningful reference level, all

levels were included in the model. Quadratic terms were considered for all continuous

covariates. Interactions were considered based on a combination of subject matter expert

advice and a minimum threshold of thirty observations for every cell for interactions

involving two binary predictors.

Missing Data

Multiple imputation

of the covariates and outcomes was performed using multivariate

imputation by chained equations (MICE)

to address missing data. A total of thirty

imputed data sets were created. Imputation was performed separately on the training and

test data to prevent inducing dependence between the training and the test data through

the imputation models. For transformed variables that are derived from other covariates

(e.g., BMI from height and weight), we imputed the missing root variables and then created

the transformed variable to ensure that the relationship between the transformed variable

and its inputs was preserved.

Table 1 includes the level of missing data in each of the covariates included in the analysis.

Medication variables, clinical descriptions of disease and severity, location, age, and gender

all had very low levels of missingness, ranging from zero to under five percent. There were

three covariates with a moderate amount of missing data — height, weight, and ethnicity

were missing in approximately 20% of patients.

Statistical Analysis
The 10-fold cross-validation deviance averaged across each of the imputed data sets was

To assess the performance of the resulting predictions, we created Receiver Operator

Characteristic (ROC) curves and calculated the corresponding area under the curve (AUC)

using the held-out test data set for the imputed data sets

We provide two graphical

summaries of the resulting models: 1) a summary of the sign distribution showing, across

bootstrap replications and imputed data sets, the proportion of estimated associations

which were negative (better outcomes), zero, or positive, and 2) box plots of the estimated

effect on the log-odds scale. We opted to show box plots instead of confidence intervals to

highlight the exploratory nature of the results for individual predictors. Lasso estimates are

biased, and the lack of a priori hypotheses makes statistical significance testing

inappropriate. We first defined a set of contrasts in order to make meaningful comparisons

while accounting for the second-order terms in the model rather than report results for

every parameter. The contrast matrices are available on a public repository

https://github.com/KosorokLab/CovidIBDRiskCalc in a CSV format.

Predictions are averaged over bootstrap replications and imputed data sets, and so there is

no single set of model coefficients to report. Because the logistic link function is non-linear,

the predicted probability from averaging over predictions from each fitted model does not

equal the predicted probability from averaging over coefficients across the models.

Additionally, averaging the model coefficients would result in none of the coefficients being

equal to zero unless that coefficient is equal to zero in

every fitted model. Instead of

reporting a misleading model summary, we opted to make all the model coefficients

available online (https://github.com/KosorokLab/CovidIBDRiskCalc).

Results
Participants
A total of 2,709 patients were reported to the registry, split into a training set of 2009

patients and a test data set of 700 patients. The test data set was comprised of 366 from the

15% split and 334 patients added to the registry after model fitting and before manuscript

submission. Table 1 provides demographic, clinical, medication, and outcome descriptive

summaries for the training set, test set, and the whole sample. A total of 633 (24%) patients

were hospitalized, 137 (5%) were admitted to the ICU or intubated, and 69 (3%) patients

died. The cohort has 1076 (40%) patients from the United States, with the rest coming

from a variety of other countries summarized in

Table 1.

Model Performance
The models have excellent discrimination, with an AUC and associated 95% confidence

interval estimated on the test data set averaged over the imputations of 0.79 (0.75, 0.83)

for Hospitalization+, 0.88 (0.82, 0.95) for ICU+, and 0.94 (0.89, 0.99) for death.

Figures 1 & 2 show the estimated coefficient sign distribution and the effect on the log-odds

scale for the ten contrasts most strongly associated with each outcome respectively.

7,31

Consistent with other studies

on risk factors for hospitalization and death, we find older

age, male gender, and comorbidities to be associated with worse outcomes due to COVID-

19. White race is associated with a lower risk of Hospitalization+ in 89.2% of our

replications but is not consistently selected in the models for ICU+ (30%) or death (10%).

These plots, not restricted to the top ten effects, are available in the supplement for all

demographic, clinical, and medication predictors (eFigures 1 & 2), for countries (eFigures 3

& 4), and for US regions (eFigures 5 & 6).

Corticosteroids are associated with a higher risk of Hospitalization+, ICU+, and death. Oral

corticosteroid use is the most important predictor, in terms of the magnitude of the

absolute value of the coefficient, for Hospitalization+, ICU+, and death (Figure 2). Biologic

medicines are associated with a lower risk of Hospitalization+, ICU+, and death, with

integrin antagonists having directionally smaller effects than tumor necrosis factor (TNF)

antagonists or interleukin (IL) 12/23 inhibitors.

for two example patients and their associated probabilities (and 90% confidence intervals)

provide a reliable basis for distinguishing between high- and low-risk patients to aid in

personalizing clinical guidance on decisions about precautions, returning to normal

activities, and vaccination.

Discussion
We developed and validated risk prediction models for hospitalization, intensive care stay,

and death resulting from COVID-19 in patients with IBD using data from 2,709 cases from

59 countries reported through an international voluntary registry.

The models

demonstrated excellent discrimination, with a test set AUC (95% CI) of 0.79 (0.75, 0.83) for

and predicting mortality among

US patients aged 65 years and older . Our risk tool is unique in at least three ways. First,

we focus on a specialized population of patients with IBD, a chronic, immune-mediated

condition frequently treated with immune suppressive medications and often affected by

13

other comorbidities. Second, our model focuses on predictors that are known before a

patient were to contract COVID-19 and thus can be used to inform lifestyle or treatment

decisions to prevent infection or downstream complications. Finally, we examine a

broader range of outcomes than tools focused solely on mortality.

Our work can serve as a

model for other disease areas, and our code is publicly available and could be adapted for

similar online risk tools in other settings or populations.

Strong associations with worse adverse COVID-19 outcomes were oral corticosteroids,

older age, comorbidities, gender, and white physician-reported race (for Hospitalization+).

Caution must be used when interpreting penalized regression results because the

coefficients are biased, but the results for oral corticosteroids were particularly dramatic.

Compared to not taking an oral corticosteroid, taking a daily dose equivalent of 40mg of

prednisone was associated with a ten times greater adjusted odds of death. Biologic

therapies were associated with a lower risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes, with small

differences between the subcategories of biologic therapies. Compared to not taking a

biologic therapy, TNF inhibitors were associated with an adjusted odds ratio of 0.62 for

14,32,

death. In contrast to earlier studies using this database

we did not find a consistent

association between 5-aminosalicylates and a higher risk of adverse outcomes; depending

on the imputation and bootstrap replication, the sign would often change from positive to

negative.

The worldwide collaboration that enabled this study and the detailed clinical data reported

by physicians or trained medical staff is an important strength of this study. The machine

learning approach allowed us to consider a wide variety of potential associations with

14

adverse outcomes, and we examined multiple adverse COVID-19-related adverse outcomes

enabling preliminary comparisons between risks. Certain comorbidities, including COPD,

CVD, and cancer, were not as strongly associated with Hospitalization+ as they were for

death. In contrast, severe IBD disease activity was an important predictor of

Hospitalization+ but was not consistently associated with a higher risk of ICU+ or death.

Limitations
The data for this study comes from a voluntary registry, and the sampling process is

unknown. Reported cases may underrepresent both low-risk asymptomatic cases and

severely ill patients who may be hospitalized at an outside hospital or die without their

healthcare provider’s knowledge. Our results are associational, not causal — when using

the online risk calculator, healthcare providers should not use it to answer “what-if”

questions (e.g., how an individual’s risk would change if they altered the medications they

33.

were taking) which are inherently causal questions

While the registry has a wealth of

clinical data, it does not collect granular data on many social determinants of health.

Additionally, insurance status is not collected, which, for patients in the US, likely factors

into the decision making of whether to visit a hospital. Lastly, we cannot compare the risk

of adverse COVID-19 outcomes in IBD patients to that in the general population.

Conclusions
This prognostic model can effectively predict which IBD patients may be at higher risk for

COVID-19-related morbidity. The free and publicly available (https://covidibd.org/covid-

19-risk-calculator/) risk calculator should facilitate patient-provider discussions regarding

the individualized risk of COVID-19 based on patient and treatment-related factors.

As

COVID-19 cases continue to rise in the US and the rest of the world, this tool will be

important in assisting physicians in identifying high-risk patients with downstream clinical

implications. This tool can inform public health efforts to promote rational vaccine

allocation and could help providers target their outreach to higher-risk patients. We

believe this approach can also serve as a model for risk stratification in other chronic

diseases.
