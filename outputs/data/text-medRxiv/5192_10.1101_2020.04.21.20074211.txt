Abstract

The SARS-CoV-2 driven disease, COVID-19, is presently a pandemic with increasing human
and monetary costs. COVID-19 has put an unexpected and inordinate degree of pressure on
healthcare systems of strong and fragile countries alike. In order to launch both containment
and mitigation measures, each country requires accurate estimates of COVID-19 incidence as
such preparedness allows agencies to plan efficient resource allocation and design control
strategies. Here, we have developed a new adaptive, interacting, and cluster-based
mathematical model to predict the granular trajectory COVID-19. We have analyzed
incidence data from three currently afflicted countries of Italy, the United States of America,
and India, and show that our approach predicts state-wise COVID-19 spread for each country
with high accuracy. We show that R0 as the basic reproduction number exhibits significant
spatial and temporal variation in these countries. However, by including a new function for
temporal variation of R0 in an adaptive fashion, the predictive model provides highly reliable
estimates of asymptomatic and undetected COVID-19 patients, both of which are key players
in COVID-19 transmission. Our dynamic modeling approach can be applied widely and will
provide a new fillip to infectious disease management strategies worldwide.
Introduction
Since the first reports from China1‚Äì3, COVID-19 has spread to all the continents resulting in
the infection of more than 1.5 million people and a death toll of more than 100,0004,5. Due to
the severity of the pandemic, many countries have implemented complete or partial
lockdowns and international travel restrictions6‚Äì8 to stem disease transmission9,10. As the
COVID-19 pandemic presents a very dire economic and humanitarian scenario for most
countries worldwide, it is imperative that afflicted governments have ready access to highly
reliable estimates of COVID-19 spread across their states and regions. Such predictive
incidence data will enable deployment of resource allocation strategies, development of new
socio-economic policies and upgradation of healthcare facilities so as to minimize
detrimental effects in each country7,8,11.
Several studies have modeled the COVID-19 pandemic at the city, state, or country level6,8,12‚Äì

population is divided into four categories of which ‚Äúsusceptible‚Äù individuals may become
‚Äúexposed‚Äù to the virus through ‚Äúinfected‚Äù people who will eventually be ‚Äúremoved‚Äù (that is,
they can no longer infect others). Removed population refers to the individuals who have
recovered or died. The traditional SEIR model when applied to model COVID-19, however,
suffers from the following two major limitations: (i) it assumes homogeneity in a large
population via keeping the basic reproduction number R0 a constant (i.e., local variations in
the transmission dynamics within a large population are not accounted for) 15‚Äì17, and (ii) it
assumes a ‚Äúclosed population‚Äù without demographic variation stemming from births, deaths
or migration15.
China reported its first case on 31 December 2019, with a peak in cumulative cases in an
eight-week interval and thence a plateauing. Italy followed the same trajectory after ~11
weeks and then the USA after ~13 weeks (of the first case in China). In India, cases rose after
~12 weeks of the first case in China, and although both cases and deaths are still on the rise
in the USA and India, Italy is already witnessing a decrease in daily new cases. To
understand the trends of this epidemic, many studies in different countries have employed the
R0 that was estimated from China. As in other directly contagious diseases, COVID-19
spreads primarily due to human transmission of the pathogen (coronavirus) from city-to-city,
or state-to-state, or country-to-country, and this involves significant migration of
humans6,12,13. The dynamics of disease spread, therefore, involves a few primary cases and an
index case up to which point the R0 is limited in its value. Beyond this, when the infection
starts to move from index cases to their contacts, the R0 assumes greater magnitude and then
it can drive community transmission that is currently being witnessed in many countries and
feared in others that are behind in their epidemic evolution.
Although R0 is a measure of communicability of COVID-19, its upper range determines the
speed of spread. Estimation of R0 assumes that everyone around a primary case is equally
susceptible to the infection and thereby suggests that it is dependent on the causative agent
alone. However, R0 is a function of direct and indirect interactions between the agent, host
and environment. The hosts‚Äô immune status, genetic makeup, comorbidities, gender and
smoking can contribute towards disease transmission. Equally, the environment that supports
transmission is dynamic via variations in temperature, humidity, population density,
migration, adaptive interventions like quarantine/isolation/social distancing, socio-economic
conditions and so on18‚Äì22. Hence, the use of a constant value for R0 cannot capture the
evolving transmission dynamics accurately. To address this challenge, we first estimated the
spatio-temporal variations of R0 in Italy, USA and India (see Figure 1). Specifically, we
tracked COVID-19 spread in each state/region within these countries and then computed R0
by explicitly solving the SEIR equations. Interestingly, we observed that R0 exhibited
significant spatial and temporal variations (see Figure 1), and hence it was deemed
inappropriate to be used as a constant for any large population.
To address the granularity in R0, we developed a new adaptive, interacting, cluster-based
SEIR (AICSEIR) model that, we show, can capture the transmission dynamics of the
COVID-19 pandemic within a heterogeneous population to high accuracy (Figure 2).
Hereon, the term state represents a subpopulation (or a cluster) in a country. State, therefore,
corresponds to the geo-administrative boundaries within India and the USA, and regions in
Italy. Our new model divided any given country‚Äôs entire population into multiple, interacting
clusters that mingled stochastically. This enabled us to predict the trajectories of COVID-19
transmission in three heterogeneous populations of Italy, USA, and India up to the
state/region level. Typically, R0 is estimated by fitting an exponential curve in the early

infection stages following the assumption that ùêº(ùë°) ‚âà ùêº(0)ùëí ([#! $%]'() . However, due to the
paucity of new cases in the early phases, the dynamics can be highly stochastic and
influenced by large, noisy fluctuations, which together cause R0 estimates to be
unreliable15,16,23. By the time stochastic fluctuations become negligible, the epidemic
behavior will tend to be nonlinear due to recoveries or deaths in infected populations
rendering the exponential approximation invalid15. In such cases, the exponential approach
will lead to a significant underestimation of R0 due to the removed population (as it is not
accounted for in the exponential model). To address these caveats, we computed R0 by
optimizing predictions from the SEIR model for each state within a country as a function of
time (see Methods). This new approach is able to capture the time dynamics of R0 that
emanate as a result of public health interventions in a given country. In particular, we
decided to re-estimate R0 on a fortnightly interval in order to capture its variability.
Methodology
(i)
Dataset
The datasets used for the study include the following. (i) The total number of COVID-19
active, and removed cases in three countries‚ÄîItaly, the USA, and India, along with the state/region-wise details. These data are obtained from the WHO and the respective government
databases4,24‚Äì29. (ii) Population data of each of the states-/regions in the three countries. (iii)
Distance between the capital cities of the states in each of the countries is directly calculated
from the latitude and longitude of the respective cities. Complete data used in the study are
provided in the Supplementary Material.

considered and therefore set to zero.

with the population of remaining (ùë† ‚àí 1) states and b/0 is the fraction distance between
capital cities from the feeder state‚Äôs capital normalized with distance to the capital cities of
the remaining (ùë† ‚àí 1) states.

The parameter ùõæ is called the removal or recovery rate, defined as the reciprocal of the
average infectious period. In this study, the average infectious period is considered to be
three days. ùõΩ* (ùë°) the parameter indicates the cluster-wise spread of the disease as a function
of time. ùõΩ* (ùë°)is evaluated as ùõΩ* (ùë°) = ùõæùëÖ*, (ùë°) where ùëÖ*, (ùë°) is the time-varying basic
reproductive ratio, a key measure that governs the spread of the epidemic. ùúé parameter is the
inverse of the average latent period or average incubation period. In this study, the average
incubation period is assumed to be seven days8,30.
The variable ùëô*+ measures the rate at which individuals leave their home population ‚Äòj‚Äô and to
subpopulation ‚Äòi‚Äô, and ùëü*+ measures the rate at which individuals leave the subpopulation ‚Äòi‚Äô
and to their home population ‚Äòj‚Äô. We have assumed that during the onset of an epidemic, any
individual in the home population would choose to stay there and a fraction of the individuals
that live in population ‚Äòi‚Äô, may return to their home population ‚Äòj‚Äô. Therefore, we have
considered ùëô*+ to be zero in the model, while ùëü*+ is modeled as a stochastic parameter. To this
extent, we have assumed that the fraction of the home going migrant population from each
subpopulation ‚Äòj‚Äô per day will be capped to a fraction ‚Äòfrac‚Äô of the subpopulation. Hence, the
matrix ùëü is generated as a ùëÜ √ó ùëÜ matrix, where ùëÜ denotes the total number of states in a
country, with each element ùëü*+ is sampled from ùëü*+ ‚àº ùëà[0, ùëìùëüùëéùëê ], where ùëà is the Uniform
distribution, with a restriction of ùëöùëéùë•Sùëü*+ T = ùëìùëüùëéùëê. In the study, without loss of generality,
frac is set to be 0.10.
Once ùëü*+ is frozen, the next step is to calculate ùëã** and ùëã*+ . This involves the allocation of the
home going migrant population from a native subpopulation to (ùë† ‚àí 1) other native
subpopulations. To this extent, we have assumed that the home of the migrant population is
distributed to (ùë† ‚àí 1) other subpopulations in a ratio directly proportional to the population
of the receiver state and inversely proportional to the distance between them. Further, for
simplicity, we assume the state capitals are the point of entry and exit points of the migrant
population. If we denote ùëÜ* be the total population of state ùëñ, then ùëã** = (1 ‚àí ùëü** )ùëÜ* and ùëã*+ =

The infected population matrix ùëå is initialized with ùëå** is equal to the actual number of cases
reported in the state ùëñ at the start of the simulation day and ùëå*+ set to zero for all the states.
Also, the exposed population matrix ùëä is initialized identically to that of the infected
population matrix ùëå to start the simulation. Further, we add an inter-cluster restriction
parameter ùê∂ to tune effect of restrictions imposed, as the result of various interventions
enforced by the state/central administrations, on the mobility of the migrant population from
feeder state to receiver state with C = 0 representing zero mobility, and C = 1 representing
restriction-free mobility.

In this study, ùëÖ, is computed by directly fitting the observations to the proposed model by
minimizing the prediction of infections. The optimization formulation for computing ùëÖ, is
given below:

Œ≤* (ùë°) = ùëéùëüùëî1$(&) Sùëå** ‚àí ùëå**23456758 T ùëÑSùëå** ‚àí ùëå**23456758 T

Eq. (10)
(ùëñùëñ) Œ≤(ùë°) ‚àà ùëÖ:
Eq. (11)
Here, ùëå** , ùëå**23456758 , ùëÑ, ùëÖ: are infections predicted by the model, observed infections, a
suitable weight, and a set of real numbers, respectively. Once Œ≤* (ùë°) is computed,

interventions of state-wise and country-wise interventions ùëÖ*, (ùë°) would be varying over time.
Hence, to make our study realistic, we adaptively re-estimate ùëÖ*, (ùë°) using every 14 days data
by employing Eq. (9)‚ÄìEq. (11).
(iv)
Model correction using real-time observations
It is imperative to reconcile the model predictions of AICSEIR model with clinically
diagnosed infected case due to the following reasons: (i) Model predictions will be
overestimating the total number of infected cases as predictions only depend on ùëÖ, and the
initial infected population. (ii) Clinically diagnosed cases will be underestimating the total
number of infected cases due to the testing limits or saturation. Hence, a realistic estimate of
the total number of infected cases will be following a middle ground between the two. To this
extent, we propose a weighted prediction correction strategy motivated by Kalman filter
estimates:
ùëå 54(*;<(5 (ùë°) = ùëå(ùë°) + ùêøgùëå 23456758 (ùë°) ‚àí ùëå(ùë°)h

Eq. (12)

Here, ùëå 23456758 (ùë°) is the clinically diagnosed infected cases, ùëå 54(*;<(5 (ùë°) is a realistic
estimate of infected cases, and ùêø is the weighting factor with |ùêø| ‚àà [0,1] and can be tuned
based on the real scenarios. L value of 0 implies 100% confidence in the model, while an L
value of 1 implies 100% confidence in the observation31.

Results
(i)
Basic reproduction number of COVID-19
To validate our approach, we used the SEIR model to fit actual COVID-19 incidence data for
Lombardia of Italy (Figure 1(a), see Methods), and then computed its R0 values4,24‚Äì29. The
high R2 value associated with the fit suggests that the derived R0 values are reliable for the
time-period considered (Figure 1(a) and Supplementary Material). We then proceeded to do
this for all the 30 states within India, 45 within the USA and 20 regions of Italy (Figures
1(b)‚Äì(e)). While in few cases, the R2 fits were poor due to low initial infection load, most
states in the three countries produced highly reliable R0 values (Figures 1(c)‚Äì(e) and
Supplementary Material). It was noted that states with high incidence returned very robust R2
values and thus, we considered all R0 values with R2 > 0.8. For the few other states, R0 was
assumed to be the country average. Such analyses resulted in a dynamic R0 profile for each of
the three countries in the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak (Figure 1(b)). Interestingly,
we observed that for both Italy and the USA, the R0 values exhibited significantly broader
distribution ranging from ~2-14 and ~4-12, respectively (detailed state-wise plots for
estimating R0 along with the exact R0 scores are provided as Supplementary Material). On the
contrary, in the case of India, we observed that R0 values ranged from ~ 2-6 (Figure 1(b)).
This evident variation in the ranges of R0 values is in congruence with the observed slower
rate of early COVID-19 spread in India when compared to the USA and Italy despite the fact
that all three countries reported their first COVID-19 case at the end of January 2020.
We next analyzed the temporal variations in R0 as it is significantly altered due to many
factors, including travel restrictions, state-wise lockdowns (as in part of USA) and
countrywide lockdown (as for Italy and India). We, therefore, calculated R0 for Italy prior to
lockdown (that is before 9 March 2020), two weeks into lockdown and four weeks into
lockdown (Figure 1(c)). For the USA, we estimated R0 with a two-week interval period
(Figure 1(d)). Moreover, in the case of India, due to the delayed onset of the spread of
disease, we computed a single R0 (Figure 1(e)). These data provide the R0 landscape as a
choropleth map for each country (Figure 1(c)‚Äì(e). As is evident, the R0 for Italy decreased
significantly due to its lockdown routines (Figure 1(c)). Indeed, enforcement of stricter
mobility restrictions has reduced Italian R0 values closer to unity thereby controlling the
growth of the epidemic (Figure 1(c)). For the USA, it is clear that only the states that
implemented substantial restrictions have managed to reduce their R0 values (Figure 1(d)).
For India, the strict screening of incoming international travelers and early imposition of
lockdown resulted in reduced R0 values in comparison to Italy and the USA. These analyses
therefore immediately reveal the benefits of public health interventions, and such modeling
approaches may be used widely and routinely for assessment of intervention outcomes.

Figure 2. Countrywide spread of COVID-19. Evolution of the pandemic in (a) Italy (b) the
USA and (c) India with respect to time. This is based on the traditional SEIR (single cluster)
and AICSEIR models with C = 1.0, 0.5, 0.1. C represents the inter-cluster mobility of the
population where C = 0 represents zero mobility and C = 1 representing restriction-free
mobility. INSET for (a), (b), and (c) show fit of model predictions and observed infected
cases (square markers). We noted that the variance in comparison to the mean trajectory is
significantly small, and it was hence omitted in these figures. The best estimates considering
the error between model and observation for (c) Italy, (d) the USA, and (e) India with L =
0.25, 0.50, and 0.75. Note that a lower value of L suggests increased confidence in the
observation, while a higher value of L suggests increased confidence in the model. Time T =
0 corresponds to 24 February 2020 for Italy, 4 March 2020 for the USA and 10 March 2020
for India.
Based on revised R0 profiles, we then used our AICSEIR model (see Methods for details) to
predict COVID-19 spread in Italy, the USA, and India. For this, our model required total state
population, values of distance between the capital cities of two-states, initial infected number
(it could be zero) and the temporal variations in R0 (as estimated in the previous section, see
Methods). The total population of any state was divided into native and migrant categories
(latter was set to 10%). It was assumed that the distribution of a state‚Äôs migrants was directly
proportional to the population of the home state and was inversely proportional to the inter8

capital distance. Therefore, two implicit assumptions in these analyses are: (a) people are
prone to migration from a highly populated state, and (b) the likelihood of choosing a nearby
state for migration is higher. Further, indirect measures of migration, such as airline/train/bus
data and the number of tourists, were ignored.
We then compared directly the trajectories of infection prevalence in Italy, the USA, and
India using both the traditional SEIR model (represented as single in Figure. 2(a)‚Äì(c)) and
our new AICSEIR model (Figure 2(a)‚Äì(c)). A new parameter C was introduced wherein
values of 1.0, 0.5, and 0.1 represent the inter-cluster interaction restrictions (C of 0 and 1
denote the absence of migration versus free migration, see Methods for details). All presented
models were run extensively with multiple random seed values to account for the stochastic
parameter ùëü*+ that models migration as a random event (see Methods). Using this, a direct
comparison of the predictive robustness of SEIR and AICSEIR models in the context of true
incidence in the three countries is possible (Figure 2(a)‚Äì(c)). We observed SEIR significantly
overestimates the peak-infected population (five-fold for Italy and up to 1.8 fold the USA and
India). In contrast, the AICSEIR provided a significantly closer estimation of infected cases
(Figure 2(a)‚Äì(c)). Thus, our approach was able to recapitulate the epidemiological trends both
qualitatively and quantitatively not only on a countrywide scale but also for its constituent
states/regions.
It is noteworthy that the model provides a prediction for total infected, but the observations
are based on clinically detected cases. Therefore, both these estimates suffer from the
following deficiencies. The clinically detected cases will always underestimate the number of
infected cases as the number of tests conducted limits the detection. Besides, all
asymptomatic infections shall be missed. On the other hand, our model might still
overestimate the total number of cases (but not as much as the SEIR approach) as it is based
on the initial conditions and infection dynamics as per R0 values. Indeed, there are a host of
other confounding factors that can govern R0 such as the climatic conditions, host genetics,
immune status, age, gender and co-morbidities. Therefore, the best estimate of total infected
population lies between model predictions and actual observation (Figure (d)‚Äì(f)). While
their difference could be small in the early stages, the disparity could be staggering at later
stages. To account for this unreliability, we have added a model correction factor L, inspired
by the Kalman filter that provides an estimate of the infected population33. Here, the estimate
of the infected population at any time ùë° is computed as the sum of the infected population in
the previous timestep ùë° ‚àí 1 and the difference between observed and model prediction at ùë°
weighted with L (see Methods). |L| resides between 0 and 1 based on the confidence of the
model and observation: L value of 0 implies 100% confidence in the model, while a value of
1 implies 100% confidence in the observation. We suggest that former (L = 0) can be used in
countries with a scarce level of COVID-19 testing while the latter (L = 1) can be used where
there is ample testing capacity (Figures 2(d)‚Äì(f)). In this scenario, the real observations
provide a lower bound of the infected cases while our AICSEIR model provides the upper
bound. This, in turn, allows the estimation of infections that may be undetected or
asymptomatic, as both play major roles in the transmission of the infections.

infections as predicted by AICSEIR model in comparison to the observed data. Progression
of COVID-19 in three states (d) Veneto (Italy), (e) Washington (the USA), and (f) Uttar
Pradesh (India) with non-zero initial infections. It is noteworthy that in both scenarios, our
model is able to predict the observed trends to high statistical reliability.
Another facet of our AICSEIR model is its ability to predict the evolution of the infection in
state-wise or in clusters. Indeed, the country-wise predictions were computed as the
summation of sub-populations (state-wise). To validate further, we selected two states from
each country and mapped their COVID-19 burden (Figure 3). The initial, exposed, infected,
and removed populations of Calabria and Veneto (Italy), Idaho and Washington (USA),
Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh (India) were assessed (Figure 3). Note that for each
country, at least one state chosen had zero initial infected population. For the initiation of
infection in these virgin territories, the importation of infected persons would be required
based on the cluster interaction term C (C = 0 would maintain zero infection). We observed
that infection trajectories predicted by the model were in excellent agreement with the
observed cases for states with zero initial infected population and finite infected population.
In other words, through the cluster interaction term, the model is able to realistically predict
the spread of COVID-19. We have provided detailed state-wise mapping of populations
likely to be infected in future for each state in each of the countries (30 in India, 45 in the
USA, and 20 Italy, Supplementary Material). These data will facilitate state-level and
national authorities to devise plans for the allocation of public health resources judiciously at
a granularity that addresses state-wise disease burden.

Conclusion
To our knowledge, previous studies on the COVID-19 pandemic have used a constant value
of R0 to assess disease spread 6,8,12,32. We have clearly demonstrated that R0 is not constant
and indeed exhibits significant spatio-temporal variations. These fluctuations in R0 need to be
incorporated in the development of robust and realistic epidemiological models. We show the
utility of the SEIR model for estimating R0 wherein a simple exponential fit may, in the best
case, lead to over-/under estimation of R0, and in the worst case, may simply be not valid due
to the non-linear variations in disease spread. We propose that temporal variations in R0
should be included in an adaptive fashion, while the spatial variations should be included in a
granular, cluster-wise model. This approach is capable of capturing realistic infection
dynamics across each nation or indeed worldwide. AICSEIR with its tunable interaction
parameters, can indeed be applied to other infectious diseases.
There are several outcomes of immediate public health value from our work: (i) we provide
robust estimates of infection burden with timelines and this will facilitate proactive
development of resource allocation strategies locally33,34, (ii) our model provides a caution
for regions with low caseload presently as they are likely to follow trends of other highly
affected areas in the absence of substantial mobility restrictions, (iii) we suggest a locally
graded contextual interventional responses that can factor socio-economic factors and
morbidity (note that complete longer-term lockdowns will have notable detrimental economic
fallouts resulting in exaggerated impacts on society), (iv) our revised novel coronavirus
burden estimates will help map the true extent of infection that includes undetected cases and
asymptomatic infections. Although epidemic prediction models tend to discount pivotal
contributions from the host and environmental confounders35,36, two useful extrapolations of
our model are to assess case volumes that may require intensive care and to calculate the true
case fatality rates (CFR)37,38. The AICSEIR model can thus serve as a valuable tool for
strategizing containment and for stemming mortality associated with the COVID-19
pandemic.
