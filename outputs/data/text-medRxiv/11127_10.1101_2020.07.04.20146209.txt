We present a mathematical model of infection dynamics that might
explain slower approaching the herd immunity during the covid-19 epidemy in Sweden than it was predicted by a variety of other models;
see graphs Fig. 2. The new model takes into account the hierarchic structure of social clusters in the human society. We apply the
well developed theory of random walk on the energy landscapes represented mathematically with ultrametric spaces. This theory was
created for applications to spin glasses and protein dynamics. To
move from one social cluster (valley) to another, the virus (its carrier) should cross a social barrier between them. The magnitude of a
barrier depends on the number of social hierarchy’s levels composing
this barrier. As the most appropriate for the recent situation in Sweden, we consider linearly increasing (with respect to hierarchy’s levels)
barriers. This structure of barriers matches with a rather soft regulations imposed in Sweden in March 2020. In this model, the infection
spreads rather easily inside a social cluster (say working collective),
but jumps to other clusters are constrained by social barriers. This
model’s feature matches with the real situation during the covid-19
epidemy, with its cluster spreading structure. Clusters need not be
determined solely geographically, they are based on a number of hierarchically ordered social coordinates. The model differs crucially
from the standard mathematical models of spread of disease, such as
the SIR-model. In particular, our model describes such a specialty of
spread of covid-19 virus as the presence of “super-spreaders” who by

Introduction

The dynamics of propagation of the covid-19 pandemy has many unusual features that were not reflected by classical matematical modeling of epidemic dynamics (see, e.g., [1]-[4]). In spite the tremendous
efforts [5]-[11], we still do not have a mathematical model describing
adequately this dynamics. In this complex situation, one can consider
models reflecting only some specialties of propagation of covid-19 infection throughout the human society. This paper is a step in this
direction. We want to explain essentially slower than expected approaching the herd immunity1 in Swedish population (see, e.g., [12]-[14]
for reports from Public Health Institute of Sweden, [7]-[9] for attempts
of mathematical modeling and [32]-[36] for reports from massmedia).2
Our model is is based on the advanced mathematics, theory of random
walks on hierarchic structures. We use the results of the well known
paper [19] on random walk on p-adic trees, the simplest hierarchic
structures endowed with ultrametric.
The main output that can be interesting say for epidemiologists are
the graphs presented in section 4 showing t−a dynamics of probability
to become infected in clustered society in long run of an epidemy; so
to say at the phase of approaching of some immunity level. The model
differs crucially from the standard models of spread of disease, such
as the SIR-model [4]. Besides explaining slow growth of immunity,
our model describes such a specialty of spread of covid-19 virus as
the presence of “super-spreaders” who by performing a kind of random walk on a hierarchic landscape of social clusters spreads infection
(section 5). In future, the model will be completed by adding the
SIR-type counterpart. But, the latter is not a specialty of covid-19

In particular, the mathematical model of covid-19 epidemy dynamics of Tom Britton
[7, 8] that was used by Swedish State Health Authority predicted that the herd immunity
will be approached already in May.

As is well known and widely debated in mass-media, the Swedish government chosen
its own way to handle covid-19 epidemy, namely, without any kind of lock-down. The
main aim of such a policy is approaching the herd immunity.

spreading. We hope that this paper may attract attention of experts
in epidemiology and sociology (the model explores the structure of
social connections in the society) who may stimulate its further development.
Our basic assumption (that, in fact, led to consideration of the ultrametric mathematical model) is that infection’s distribution in the
society has the structure of disjoint social clusters.3 Such a cluster can
be a collective of some enterprise or a state department, say clerks of
community office of some town or the personal of some hospital. Inside such a cluster people still have relatively high degree of social
connections (see appendix 2). However, even the mild isolation policy of Swedish authorities erected sufficiently high barriers between
clusters, because people terminated many sorts of social contacts. In
particular, the government did not recommend travels inside the country or abroad. (They were not strictly forbidden, but the majority of
citizens followed these recommendations.) Another characteristic feature of the model is that connections between social clusters that can
be used by the virus to spread have the hierarchic structure. For example, the community office has higher level in the social hierarchy
than the working place. Any worker can have some things to do with
community even during the period of epidemy.
Thus the basic assumption of our model is the following one:

The problem of approaching the herd immunity is especially important in the light of Swedish experience and its consequences for states’
policies in preparation to the second wave of covid-19 or other similar viruses. The herd immunity is mathematically formalized through
the probability for a person to become infected at time t, see Fig. ??
(section 4).
To model cluster dynamics, we use random walk on ultrametric
spaces [19]. It was widely used in studied in physics and microbiology,

“Disjoint” has the meaning of separation in social space. In physical space, clusters
can essentially overlap. Social separation does not complete, say of the form of walls.
There are social barriers, but a person (virus-carrier) can hope over barriers, with some
probability.

see [19], [20]-[25] and references herein. Geometrically ultrametric
spaces have the treelike structure. The simplest trees are homogeneous
trees with the fixed number of branches p leaving each vertex, p-adic
trees.
Random walks on trees describe dynamics on energy landscapes.
There are given energy barriers ∆m separating valleys, movement from
one valley to another valley is constrained by necessity to jump over
a barrier between them.
In our model of the covid-19 epidemy, the virus (or its carrier)
randomly walks in socially clustered society. In our model, it starts
just from a single social cluster (this assumption is used for mathematical simplicity); it spreads relatively easily inside any cluster, but
to approach other social clusters it should “jump over social barriers”.
Dynamics depends heavily on two parameters: on the magnitudes of
the social barriers (the type of their growth between different levels of
hierarchy) and on the social analog of temperature. The magnitude
of a social barrier depends only on the number of hierarchy levels
composing it, but not on a social cluster. This is the very important
constraint on the population, it should be sufficiently homogeneous
with respect to the magnitudes of social barriers.
The configuration space of dynamics is the tree of social connections between people. In epidemy modeling, it is natural to assume
the presence of the hierarchic structure in social clustering of people,
by ranging basic social parameters coupled to infection. This representation of individuals, as vectors of hierarchically ordered social
coordinates have been already used by the author and his collaborators in a series of studies in cognition, psychology, and sociology
[26]-[31].
Just before submission of this preprint, I discovered the recent
paper of Britton et al. [15]. One of its authors, Britton, initiated intensive mathematical modeling of spreading covid-19 in Sweden and,
in particular, he is famous in Sweden for his prognoses of approaching
the herd immunity in Swedish population [7]-[9]. However, his prognoses did not match with the real dynamics of epidemy in Sweden.
In the new modeling [15], Britton et al. started to take into account
heterogeneity of population (cf. [16]-[18]). This is a step towards coupling with our model. Before to discuss similarities and differences of
two models in more detail, I should study article [15] more carefully.

Social trees

We represent the human society as a system of hierarchically coupled
disjoint clusters. There are many ways of creation of such representa-

tions. We present one of these possibilities that was used in my works
of ultrametric modeling in cognition and sociology (see, e.g., [26]-[30]).
The treelike representation of social types is based on selection of hierarchically ordered social factors enumerated as m = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...; factor
m = 0 is the most important, m = 1 is less important and so on. A
social type is represented by a vector
x = (x0 , x1 , ..., xn−1 ),

where its coordinates xm take (typically) discrete values quantifying
the m-th factor. In the simplest case, xm takes two values, “yes”/“no”,
or 1/0. We call numbers (xm ) social coordinates. The vector representation of social types and individuals is widely used in sociology and
psychology. The main distinguishing feature of our model is endowing
the space of vectors with the special metric reflecting the hierarchic
structure corresponding the order of social factors (see, e.g., [26]-[30]
on application to cognition and psychology). The space of all vectors
of the form (4) is called the hierarchic social space.
Since in the covid-19 situation the state plays the crucial role as
the policy determining organ, it is natural to select m = 0 as the
state that population is under consideration. However, since the majority of states selected the lock down policy that was not oriented
towards approaching the herd immunity, we restrict consideration to
the Swedish population and use m = 0 for the next basic social factor,
namely, for individual’s age, then say m = 1 for the presence of one
chronic diseases, m = 2 for gender, m = 3 for race, m = 4 for the
town of location, m = 6 for profession, m = 7 for the level of social
activity, m = 5 the district in the town, m = 8 for the number of children, and so on. We understand that such ranking of the basic social
factors related to the covid-19 epidemy may be naive and incomplete.
The contribution of sociologists, psychologists, and epidemiologists
can improve the present model essentially.
For mathematical simplicity, we consider p-adic coordinates, xm =
0, 1, ..., p − 1, where p > 1 is a prime number. The space of all such
vectors denote by the symbol Zp;n (p is fixed). For analytical computations, it is convenient to represent elements of this space by natural
numbers
x = x0 + x1 p + x1 p2 + xn−1 pn−1 , xm ∈ {0, 1, ..., p − 1}.

Thus the points of the hierarchic social space can be represented by
natural numbers, Zp;n = {0, ..., pn −1}. The number of its points grows
exponentially with the number of social coordinates n.
We now turn to the definition of a metric on Zp;n . Consider two
social vectors x = (x1 , ..., xn−1 ) and y = (y1 , ..., yn−1 ). Let their firts

k coordinates are equal, x0 = y0 , ..., xk−1 = yk−1 , but the kth coordinates are different, xk 6= yk . Then the hierarchic social distance
between these social types, d(x, y) = n−k. The first social coordinates
are the most important: longer the common initial segment of vectors
corresponds to closer social type, increase of k implies decrease of distance between two social types. For example, let k = n − 1, i.e., two
points differ only in the last coordinate, then d(x, y) = 1. This is the
minimal possible distance in Zp;n . (The coordinate xn has the minimal
degree of importance.) If the vectors differ already by the first coordinate, i.e., x0 6= y0 , then d(x, y) = n. This is the maximal possible
distance between points in space Zp;n . Distance d is ultrametric, it
satisfies the strong triangle inequality:
d(x, y) ≤ max{d(x, z), d(y, z)},

for any triple of points x, y, z ∈ Zp;n . Here in each triangle, the third
side is less or equal not only to the sum of two other sides (as usual),
but even to their maximum.
As usual in a metric space we can introduce balls, BN (a) = {x ∈
Zp;n : d(a, x) ≤ N }, where N = 1, ..., n, and a = (a0 , .., , an−1 ) is some
point in Zp;n , ball’s center. In an ultrametric space, any two balls are
either disjoint or one is contained in another and any point of a ball
can be selected as its center.
For our modeling, it is important that the space Zp;n can be split
into disjoint social clusters. (As we shall see soon, these clusters are,
in fact, balls.) Each cluster is determined by fixing a few first (the
most important) social coordinates,
Zp;n = ∪p−1
j=0 Cj ,
where Cj = {x : x0 = j}. This cluster representation corresponds to
the first level of social hierarchy, we distinguish points by their most
important coordinate. Each of clusters Cj can be represented similarly
as
Cj = ∪p−1
j=0 Cji ,

203
204
205

where Cji = {x : x0 = j, x1 = i} are clusters of the deeper hierarchic
level and so on, up to the single-point clusters corresponding to fixing
all social coordinates.
Clusters are, in fact, ultrametric balls:
Ci0 ...ik −1 = {x : x0 = i0 , ..., xk−1 = ik−1 } = Bn−k (a),

206
207

where a is any point of the form a0 = i0 , ..., ak−1 = ik−1 and arbitrary
coordinates aj , j = k, ..., n − 1.

Geometrically space Zp;n is represented as a homogeneous tree with
p branches leaving each vertex. Cluster is a bunch of branches having
the common root. By extending this root we split the cluster into
subclusters.
Now we consider the procedure of extension of a social tree by
adding new social coordinates, so from tree Zp;n to tree Zp;N , where
N > n. As the result of such an extension, each point of social space
Zp;n becomes a social cluster in social space Zp;N . In principle, it is
impossible to determine a social type by fixing any finite number of
social coordinates. Hence, We have to consider infinite sequences of
coordinates:
x = (x0 , x1 , ..., xn−1 , ...), xj = 0, 1, ..., p − 1.

221

Denote the space of such sequences by the symbol Zp . This is the
complete hierarchic social space. Points of finite trees represent social
clusters.

Dynamics

Consider a tree with n levels of social hierarchy, Zp;n . Suppose that
initially infected people are concentrated just in one social cluster
represented by a single point x ∈ Zp;n . Consider the initial probability
for a person in this cluster to become infected, P (y, 0) = δ(y − x).
The virus plays the role of a system moving through barriers in
models of dynamics on energy landscapes (see [19], [20]-[25] and references herein). In our case, these are social barriers between social
clusters of population. The virus performs a complex random walk
motion inside each social cluster moving in its sub-clusters, goes out
of it and spreads through the whole population, sometimes the virus
comes back to the original cluster from other social clusters that have
been infected from this initial source of infection, and so on. During
this motion the virus should cross numerous social barriers.
Instead of virus walking through the social tree, we can consider
a person. A person of the social type x = (x1 , ..., xn ) can interact
with persons of the social type, y = (x1 , ..., xk − 1, yk , ..., yn ), where
xk 6= yk by crossing the social barrier for n − k levels of hierarchy. The
temporal sequence of social contacts of some persons can have a very
complicated trajectory, visiting numerous clusters (but the probability
of approaching a cluster depends crucially on social barriers).
We are interested in the relaxation process that is understood as
the evolution of the probability to become infected for a person from
the social cluster x, i.e., in the time dependence of the quantity P (x, t).

We do not want to go into details, since the problem of relaxation
was well studied in physics and microbiology, see [19], [20]-[25] and
references herein. The relaxation regime depends crucially on the
barriers’ magnitude, how rapidly they grow up on the way from one
cluster to another.

4 Random walk on on infinite trees:
temporal behavior of probability
As in the previous section, we a random walk on a finite tree. Here
we follow the paper of Ogielski [19]. Let us consider a finite tree with
n levels. Thus there are 2n points at the last level. They enumerate
the total population: i = 0, ..., 2n − 1.
Let virus encounters a barrier of size ∆m , in hopping a distance m
(crossing m levels of hierarchy), where ∆1 < ∆2 < ... < ∆m < .... It
is supposed that barriers ∆m are the same for all social clusters, i.e.,
they depend only on distance, but not on clusters.
The probability to jump over the barrier ∆m has the form (up to
the normalization constant):
P(m) = e−

,

where T is model’s parameter; in physics it has the meaning of temperature of the environment; we also interpret it similarly, as a kind of
social temperature, cf. [29]. Probability P(m) grows with growth of
social temperature T. For high social temperatures, jumps are easier.
Consider the energy landscape with a uniform barrier ∆, at every
branch point; that is, a jump of distance 1 involves surmounting a
barrier ∆, of distance 2, a barrier 2∆, and so on. Hence, barriers
linearly grow with distance m,
∆m = m∆, m = 1, 2, ....

It seems that this type of behavior is the most natural from the
viewpoint of social connections during the covid-19 epidemy in Sweden. Barriers are sufficiently high, but they still are not walls as during
the rigid quarantine (as say in Italy, France, or Russia). The probability to jump over the barrier ∆m has the form (up to the normalization
constant):
m∆
P(m) = e− T .
(7)
The probability depends on the height ∆ of the minimal social barrier,
but, for large m, its contribution to is not so important.

By using random walk on the tree with n levels of hierarchy and
approaching n → ∞ one can derive the following asymptotic behavior
of the relaxation probability:

281

P (x, t) = t−T ln p/∆ , t → ∞.

(8)

Set κ = T ln p/∆. If κ << 1, e.g., the social temperature is low and
the primary social barrier ∆ is relatively large, then the probability for
a person in the original social cluster x to become infected decreases
rather slowly, see Fig. 1.

5 Average social distance traveled by
infection spreader
In our mathematical model, any infection spreader travels through the
social tree, he-she visits a few social clusters and infects people in these
clusters. Theory of random walks in ultrametric spaces predicts the
average social distance for spreader’s travel through clusters, starting
at some fixed cluster x and jumping to other cluster y,

For linearly growing social barriers, and n → ∞, the asymptotic
behavior has the following form:

This average distance goes to infinity. (As can be expected, higher
social temperature T and lower one-step social barrier ∆ induce more
rapid growth.) Although the log-growth is relatively slow, it, nevertheless, implies very extended spread of the infection. Unsoundness of
hd(x, t)i can be associated with the presence of super-spreaders who
jump even over high social barriers and spread the virus to social clusters that are far from the original source of infection. We repeat once

Concluding remarks

The presented ultarmetric model with random walk dynamics on energy landscapes describes well the social cluster structure of spreading of covid-19. The model was designed to explain mathematically
the slow approaching the herd immunity in Swedish population during March-June 2020, essentially slower than it was predicted by all
mathematical models.4 The model elevates the role of the social dimension of infection spreading comparing with its purely bio-medical
dimension. The bio-medical restrictions in Sweden were very soft; in
particular, no face-masks, 1,5 meter social distance, public transportation worked more or less as usual (see appendix 2 for details). The
most typical infecting took place in working collectives in that social
contacts were not occasional, as say in metro, or in a bus, or even in
a restaurant during lunch, but close and permanent, on the everyday
basis.
We applied to the new area of research, to epidemiology, mathematical theory developed for applications in statistical physics (spin
glasses) and microbiology (protein folding): ultrametric random walk
describing dynamics on complex energy landscapes with the hierarchic
structure of barriers between valleys. The presence of social barriers
growing with hierarchy’s levels makes the evolution of epidemy essentially slower than in models which do not take into account the
cluster-character of infection spreading. In particular, our model is
purely diffusional, cf. with standard SIR-model [4]. We motivate consideration of linearly growing social barriers in Sweden with its soft
epidemiological restrictions.
Although the model is very simplified it reflects some features of
the covid-19 epidemy, especially its the social cluster character. We
hope that our model will stimulate further development of ultrametric
epidemiological models that take into account the hierarchic social
clustering of population.

See appendix 1; finally, the state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell pointed that it seems
meaningless to appeal to mathematical models at all, since they do not reflect even approximately the real situation.

Appendix 1: Growth of the herd immunity in Sweden

372

Our model can be interesting only for Sweden, where the “experiment”
for approaching the herd immunity was performed in its clean form,
without overshadowing by quarantine. The main concern of Swedish
authorities, including Anders Tegnell, is that the dynamics of getting
antibodies for covid-19 in Swedish population is essentially slower than
it was expected. Since the end of April 2020, Anders Tegnell, the chief
state epidemiologist of Sweden, started to announce (see, e.g., [32])
that very soon we, Swedish citizens, will become immune against the
virus. This announcement was repeated a few times during May-June
2020, but it still not clear whether it happened or not (see, e.g., [34][36]). Moreover, Stockholm university made recently (June 24 []) the
update that, in fact, already the level 60% can be considered as the
herd immunity state. So, it seems that there is no hope to approach
70% level of immunity.
On June 24, 2020, it was announced [35] that: “A total of 7.3
percent of the blood samples collected from people in Stockholm were
positive, 4.2 percent in Skane and 3.7 percent in Västra Götaland.
The numbers reflect the situation in early April, as it takes time for
the antibodies to develop. The authority’s modeling has previously
shown that 26 percent of the population in Stockholm would have been
infected on May 1. Tom Britton, professor of mathematical statistics
at Stockholm University, comments on these and says that the figures
are “clearly lower”, than he thought. “Firstly, I am thinking about
the modeling, if there is any mistake that I and the Public Health Authority have made. Then you also wonder if some have been infected
but do not have detectable antibodies, for example people who are
mildly infected.”
The level of the herd immunity depends on the age group. On
June 2, 2020, it was pointed out that for the youngsters up to 19
years old around 8% Andelen med antikroppar mot covid-19 bland
yngre upp till 19 år var närmare åtta procent, för åldersgruppen 2064 låg motsvarande siffra på 6-7 procent. För personer över 65 år låg
siffran på cirka tre procent. Det kan finnas flera skäl till att det är
lägre nivåer för vuxna och äldre, enligt Karin Tegmark Wisell.
