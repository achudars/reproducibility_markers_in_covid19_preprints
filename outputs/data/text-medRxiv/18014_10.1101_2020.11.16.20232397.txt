Importance: Patients with COVID-19 may exhibit 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency,

2

but the beneficial effects of vitamin D3 supplementation in this disease remain to be

3

proven by randomized controlled trials.

4

Objective: To investigate the efficacy and safety of vitamin D3 supplementation in

5

patients with severe COVID-19.

6

Design, Setting, and Participants: This is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized,

7

placebo-controlled trial conducted in two centers (a quaternary hospital and a field

8

hospital) in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The trial included 240 hospitalized patients with severe

9

COVID-19. The study was conducted from June 2, 2020 to October 7, 2020.

10

Interventions: Patients were randomly allocated (1:1 ratio) to receive either a single

11

oral dose of 200,000 IU of vitamin D3 or placebo.

12

Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was hospital length of stay,

13

defined as hospital discharge from the date of randomization or death. Secondary

14

outcomes were mortality, admission to ICU, mechanical ventilation requirement, and

15

serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, creatinine, calcium, C-reactive protein, and D-

16

dimer.

17

Results: Of 240 randomized patients (mean age, 56 years; 56% men), 232 (96.7%)

18

were included in the primary analysis. Log-rank test showed that hospital length of stay

19

was comparable between the vitamin D3 supplementation and placebo groups (7.0 days

20

[95% CI, 6.1 to 7.9] and 7.0 days [95% CI, 6.2 to 7.8 days]; hazard ratio, 1.12 [95% CI,

21

0.9 to 1.5]; P = .379; respectively). The rate of mortality (7.0% vs 5.1%; P = .590),

22

admission to ICU (15.8% vs 21.2%; P = .314), and mechanical ventilation requirement

23

(7.0% vs 14.4%; P = .090) did not significantly differ between groups. Vitamin D3

24

supplementation significantly increased serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels compared to

Conclusions and Relevance: Among hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19,

vitamin D3 supplementation was safe and increased 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, but

did not reduce hospital length of stay or any other relevant outcomes vs placebo. This

trial does not support the use of vitamin D3 supplementation as an adjuvant treatment of

patients with COVID-19.

Introduction

2

A growing body of evidence has indicated that vitamin D may enhance the innate1-3 and

3

adaptive immunity.4, 5 Since antigen-presenting cells have the ability to synthesize 1,25-

4

dihydroxyvitamin D (the active form of vitamin D) from 25-hydroxyvitamin D, it has

5

been postulated that vitamin D supplementation could improve the function of

6

macrophages and dendritic cells, thereby ameliorating overall immune response.6 In

7

fact, insufficient vitamin D status has been suggested as a potential risk factor for non-

8

communicable7 and acute respiratory tract diseases,8, 9 including viral infections.10

9

In this context, it has been recently conjectured that optimal levels of vitamin D could

10

play important immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory roles, thereby benefiting

11

patients with COVID-19.11, 12 However, the putative benefits of supplementary vitamin

12

D3 to patients with COVID-19 remain speculative and partially supported by limited

13

data from observational studies and one small-scale, non-randomized clinical trial.13-15

14

To our knowledge, this is the first randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to

15

investigate the safety and efficacy of vitamin D3 supplementation on hospital length of

16

stay and other relevant clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-

17

19. Our main a priori hypothesis was that a single dose of 200,000 IU of vitamin D3

18

supplementation would increase 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and shorten hospital

19

length of stay among these patients.

Study design and treatment

12

This was a multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, randomized placebo-controlled

13

trial. Eligibility screening was performed between June 2, 2020 to July 21, 2020 at

14

Clinical Hospital of the School of Medicine of the University of Sao Paulo (n = 122),

15

and from July 22, 2020 to August 27, 2020 at Ibirapuera Field Hospital (n = 118). The

16

final follow-up in both centers was on October 7, 2020. Eligible patients were assigned

17

in a 1:1 ratio into either the vitamin D3 supplementation group or the placebo group.

18

The randomization list was created using a computer-generated code, which was

19

managed by a staff member who had no role in the study. We assessed patients’ clinical

20

status, coexisting chronic diseases, demographic characteristics, self-reported body

21

weight and height, and ethnicity on hospital admission. Outcomes were assessed at

22

baseline and on hospital discharge or death records.

23

The vitamin D3 supplementation group received an oral, single dose of 200,000 IU of

24

vitamin D3 dissolved in a 10 mL of peanut oil solution on the same day of

25

randomization. The selected dose is within the recommended range for effectively

promoting vitamin D sufficiency.16 Patients in the placebo group received 10 mL of

2

peanut oil solution. The vitamin D3 and placebo solutions were identical in color, taste,

3

smell, consistency, and container. Both were prepared by the pharmacy unit of Clinical

4

Hospital and labeled by a staff member who did not participate in the study. Allocation

5

blindness was kept until the final statistical analysis.

Outcome measures

8

The primary outcome was hospital length of stay, defined as the total number of days

9

that patients remained hospitalized from the date of study admission until the date of

10

hospital discharge or death. The criteria used for patient discharge were: 1) no need for

11

supplemental oxygen in the last 48 hours; 2) no fever in the last 72 hours; and 3)

12

oxygen saturation > 93% in room air without respiratory distress.

13

The secondary outcomes were: 1) mortality; 2) number of patients admitted to the

14

intensive care unit (ICU); 3) number of patients who needed mechanical ventilation and

15

duration of mechanical ventilation; and 4) serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D

16

(assessed by a chemiluminescent immunoassay), calcium (assessed by a NM-BAPTA

17

method), creatinine (assessed by a colorimetric assay based on kinetic Jaffe’s reaction),

18

and C-reactive protein and D-dimer (both assessed by an immunoturbidimetric assay).

19

The biochemical analyses were carried out in an accredited laboratory from Clinical

20

Hospital.

22

Statistical Analysis

23

Considering the lack of data available for sample size determination based on the

24

primary outcome (i.e., hospital length of stay after vitamin D3 supplementation in

25

patients with severe COVID-19), the number of participants was chosen on the basis of

feasibility, such as resources, capacity of research staff and facility, and available

2

patients, in line with current recommendations.17, 18 Subsequently, we calculated sample

3

size assuming a 50% between-group difference in hospital length of stay (considering 7

4

days as a median time of stay, with an expected variability of 9 days). By considering a

5

power of 80% and a 2-sided significance level of 5% (α = .05), the total sample was

6

estimated to be 208 patients (104 in each arm). Considering possible dropouts, and to

7

increase the power for secondary outcomes, we opted by increasing the sample size by

8

approximately 15%.

9

All analyses were carried out following the intention-to-treat principle for all

10

randomized patients, with no imputation for any missing data. Proportions were

11

compared between groups using c2 test and Fisher's exact test. Student's t-tests were

12

used for comparing continuous variables at baseline. The log-rank test was used to

13

compare the Kaplan-Meier estimate curves the number of days for hospital length of

14

stay, the primary outcome. Cox regression models for hospital length of stay, admission

15

to ICU and mechanical ventilation requirement were adjusted by potential confounders

16

that were not fully balanced by randomization (P < .2) to estimate hazard ratios (HR),

17

with corresponding 2-sided 95% CI. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) for

18

repeated measures were used for testing possible differences in laboratory parameters,

19

assuming group and time as fixed factors, with marginal distribution, and a first-order

20

autoregressive correlation matrix to test the main and interaction effects. Post-hoc tests

21

with Bonferroni’s adjustment were performed for multiple comparisons. The

22

aforementioned statistical procedures were also carried out in post-hoc sensitivity

23

analyses involving patients exhibiting 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency (i.e., < 20

24

ng/mL).

Results

2

Patients

3

Of 1208 patients assessed for eligibility, 240 were eligible and randomly assigned to

4

either the vitamin D3 group or the placebo group. Patients were non-eligible due to the

5

following reasons: 284 were at ICU, 263 had hospital discharge within 24 hours, 217

6

did not have COVID-19 confirmation, 95 had renal dysfunction, 37 had dementia or

7

severe mental confusion hampering their ability to provide the inform consent for

8

participation, 30 were pregnant or lactating women, 14 had hypercalcemia due to

9

metastatic neoplasm, 11 were receiving vitamin D3 (≥ 1000 IU/day), 9 were younger

10

than 18 years, 6 were illiterate and, therefore, unable to read and sign the informed

11

consent, and 2 died before randomization.

12

Of the 120 patients who were randomized to the vitamin D3 group, 3 did not receive

13

intervention (1 withdrew the consent, 1 vomited immediately after ingesting the

14

supplement, and 1 was admitted to the ICU before taking vitamin D3) and 3 were lost to

15

follow-up. Of the 120 patients who were randomized to the placebo group, 2 withdrew

16

the consent. Thus, of the 240 patients randomized, 232 (96.7%) completed the follow-

17

up (Figure 1).

18

Overall, patients’ age was 56.3 years (SD, 14.6), BMI was 31.6 kg/m2 (SD, 7.1), 56.3%

19

were men, 55% were white, 52.5% had hypertension, 35% had diabetes, 13.3% had

20

cardiovascular diseases, and 6.3% had asthma. The mean time between the onset of

21

symptoms and randomization was 10.2 days (SD, 4.3); 89.6% required supplemental

22

oxygen at baseline (183 were on oxygen therapy and 32 were on non-invasive

23

ventilation), and 59.6% had computed tomography scan findings suggestive of COVID-

24

19. Demographic and clinical characteristics did not significantly differ between groups,

25

except for sore throat, which was more prevalent in the vitamin D3 group vs placebo

Primary Outcome

5

Hospital length of stay (Figure 2) was comparable between the vitamin D3 group and

6

the placebo group (7.0 days [95% CI, 6.1 to 7.9] and 7.0 days [95% CI, 6.2 to 7.8 days],

7

HR, 1.12, [95% CI, 0.9 to 1.5]; P = .379; respectively). The Cox regression model did

8

not show any significant associations between this outcome and potential confounders.

9
10

Secondary Outcomes

11

There were no significant differences between the vitamin D3 group and the placebo

12

group for mortality (7.0% vs 5.1%; P = .590), admission to ICU (15.8% vs 21.2%; P =

13

.314) and mechanical ventilation requirement (7.0% vs 14.4%; P = .090) (Figure 3).

14

Duration of mechanical ventilation was also comparable between the vitamin D3 group

15

(18.1 days [95% CI, 3.5 to 32.7]) and the placebo group (11.4 days [95% CI, 7.1 to

16

15.6]; P = .549, respectively).

17

The Cox regression model did not show significant associations between secondary

18

outcomes and potential confounders.

19

Vitamin D3 supplementation significantly increased 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels vs

20

placebo (difference, 24.0 ng/mL [95% CI, 21.1- 26.9]; P < .001) (Figure 3). Following

21

the intervention, 86.7% of the patients in the vitamin D3 group showed 25-

22

hydroxyvitamin D levels above 30 ng/mL (vs 10.9% in the placebo group), and only

23

6.7% of the patients in the vitamin D3 group exhibited 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency

24

(vs 51.5% in the placebo group).

Post-hoc Sensitivity Analyses

2

In a sensitivity analysis involving patients with 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency at

3

baseline (n = 116) (Supplementary Table 1), vitamin D3 supplementation significantly

4

increased 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels vs placebo (difference, 22.7 ng/mL [95% CI,

5

19.3 to 26.1]; P < .001) (Figure 3). Among the patients with 25-hydroxyvitamin D

6

deficiency, no between-group differences were observed in length of hospital stay

7

(Figure 2). In addition, there were no significant differences between the vitamin D3

8

group and the placebo group for mortality (7.0% vs 1.7%; P = .206), admission to ICU

9

(17.5% vs 15.5%; P = .806), and mechanical ventilation requirement (7.0% vs 8.6%; P

10

> .999) (Figure 3). Duration of mechanical ventilation did not differ between the

11

vitamin D3 group (15.0 days [95% CI, -12.0 to 42.0]) and the placebo group (12.6 days

12

[95% CI, -7.6 to 26.0]; P = .730).

13
14

Safety and Adverse Events

15

There were no changes in any health-related laboratory markers following the

16

intervention (Table 2). Vitamin D3 supplementation was well tolerated and no severe

17

adverse events were reported throughout the trial, with the exception of one patient who

18

vomited following vitamin D3 administration.

19
20

Discussion

21

This is the first randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to show that vitamin

22

D3 supplementation is safe and increases 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, but is ineffective

23

to improve hospital length of stay or any other clinical outcomes among hospitalized

24

patients with severe COVID-19.

1

Vitamin D has been postulated to play an important role on immune system, acting as a

2

regulator of both innate and adaptative responses.6, 19 Observational studies have shown

3

that 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are associated with better clinical outcomes in

4

respiratory diseases.20 Positive associations between low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels

5

and poor prognosis among patients with COVID-19 have also been observed.21

6

Furthermore, a small-scale, non-randomized trial demonstrated that the administration

7

of regular boluses of vitamin D3 before the infection was associated with better survival

8

and less severe disease among older, frail patients with COVID-19.22 In the current trial,

9

however, a single dose of 200,000 IU of vitamin D3 supplementation failed to promote

10

any clinically relevant effects among hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19,

11

contesting the utility of supplementary vitamin D3 as a treatment in this disease.

12

The lack of clinical benefits seen in this study was independent of the ability of vitamin

13

D3 supplementation to increase serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. In fact, following

14

the intervention, 86.7% of the patients in the supplementation arm achieved vitamin D

15

sufficiency (≥ 30 ng/mL) vs 11% only in the placebo group. In a sensitivity analysis

16

confined to the patients exhibiting 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency, vitamin D3

supplementation remained effective in increasing 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels vs

18

placebo; yet, no clinical improvements were noted. Collectively, these analyses indicate

19

that a single oral dose of 200,000 IU of supplementation can rapidly increase 25-

20

hydroxyvitamin levels, in agreement with our hypothesis, so that the present null

21

findings cannot be attributed to the failure of increasing serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D

22

levels.

Despite the clinical inefficacy of vitamin D3 supplementation, the intervention was not

24

associated with any important adverse events or meaningful changes in laboratory

1

parameters, suggesting that a relatively high-dose of vitamin D3 can be well tolerated in

2

general and free of adverse effects in patients with COVID-19.

3

The strengths of this study include the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled

4

experimental design, the adequate power, particularly for the primary analysis, the very

5

low attrition rate (3.3%), the concomitant assessment of 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels

6

along with clinical outcomes, and the assessment of hospitalized patients with severe

7

COVID-19.

Limitations

10

This trial has several limitations. First, the sample size could have been underpowered

11

to detect significant changes for the secondary outcomes. Second, as the patients had

12

several coexisting diseases and were subjected to a diverse medication regimen, the

13

results could have been affected by the heterogeneity of the sample and its treatment.

14

Third, the proportion of patients with 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency enrolled in this

15

study was considerably lower than those reported in other cohorts,23 possibly as a

16

consequence of differences in geographic locations. Although we conduced sensitivity

17

analyses involving patients with 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency, one could argue that

18

they could have been underpowered, as previously pointed out. Therefore, caution

19

should be exercised in generalizing these findings to patients from other geographical

20

regions. Finally, the findings should be also confined to the dose and supplementation

21

strategy used in this trial. Further studies should determine whether preventive or early

22

vitamin D3 supplementation could be useful in the treatment of patients with COVID-

23

19, especially those with a mild or moderate disease.

Conclusions

2

Among hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19, a single dose of 200,000 IU of

3

vitamin D3 supplementation was safe and increased 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, but

4

did not reduce hospital length of stay or any other clinically relevant outcomes vs

5

placebo. Thus, this trial does not support the use of vitamin D3 supplementation as an

6

adjuvant treatment of patients with COVID-19.

1.5; P = .379) for the vitamin D3 group (7.0 days [95% CI, 6.1 to 7.9]) vs the placebo

comparisons between the vitamin D3 and placebo group for all patients (n = 240) (Panels
A and B) and for those with 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency (< 20 ng/mL) (n = 116)

admission to ICU (15.8% vs 21.2%; P = .314), and need of mechanical ventilation (7.0%
vs 14.4%; P = .090). Vitamin D3 supplementation significantly increased 25hydroxyvitamin D levels vs placebo (difference, 24.0 ng/mL [95% CI, 21.1- 26.9]; P <
.001). For patients with 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency, there were no significant
differences between the vitamin D3 group and the placebo group for mortality (7.0% vs
1.7%; P = .206), admission to ICU (17.5% vs 15.5%; P = .806), and mechanical
ventilation requirement (7.0% vs 8.6%; P > .999). Vitamin D3 supplementation
