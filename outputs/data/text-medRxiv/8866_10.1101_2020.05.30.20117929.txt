Abstract
Objective: To evaluate differences in morbidity and mortality among mechanically ventilated
patients with COVID-19 treated with therapeutic versus prophylactic anticoagulation.

Methods: We performed a retrospective review of 245 COVID-19 positive patients admitted to
the ICU requiring mechanical ventilation from March 1, 2020 through April 11, 2020 at Mount

Sinai Hospital. Patients either received therapeutic anticoagulation for a minimum of 5 days or

prophylactic dose anticoagulation. Morbidity and mortality data were analyzed.

Results: Propensity score (PS) weighted Kaplan-Meier plot demonstrated a survival advantage
(57% vs. 25%) at 35 days from admission to the ICU in patients who received therapeutic

anticoagulation for a minimum of 5 days compared to those who received prophylactic

anticoagulation during their hospital course. A multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression

model with PS weights to adjust for baseline differences found a 79% reduction in death in

patients who were therapeutically anticoagulated HR 0.209, [95% CI (0.10, 0.46), p <0.001].

Bleeding complications were similar between both groups. A 26.7% [95% CI (1.16, 1.39),

p<0.001] excess mortality was found for each 1 mg/dL rise in serum creatinine over a 21-day

period.

Conclusions: Therapeutic anticoagulation is associated with a survival advantage among
patients with COVID-19 who require mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

Introduction
Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel single-stranded RNA virus and the causative agent

of the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 is related to severe acute respiratory syndrome

coronavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1) and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV),

which were responsible for epidemics of viral pneumonia in 2003 and 2012 respectively

1

. Like

SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, the pathophysiology of severe disease caused by COVID-19 appears

to be partly due to endothelial injury leading to severe inflammation and dysregulated

thrombosis in both the lungs and extrapulmonary organs

1-14

.

In the lungs, the degree of hypoxemia is out of proportion to expected compliance

changes and there is concomitant evidence of decreased hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction

and increased alveolar dead space ventilation consistent with pulmonary vascular endothelial

injury and thrombosis rather than acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)

5,6

. This suggests

that initiation of therapeutic anticoagulation (TA), rather than prophylactic anticoagulation (PA)

may be necessary to prevent multi-organ failure and death, particularly for patients with severe

disease. In light of these reports, as well as our own institutional experience with arterial,

venous and intravascular device thrombosis, we developed a system wide protocol for

therapeutic anticoagulation in critically ill COVID-19 patients with a low risk of bleeding

complications. Some of our health system’s experience with this anticoagulation protocol was

recently reported, demonstrating improvements in 21-day survival from day of hospital

admission in 395 COVID-19 patients who were mechanically ventilated with anticoagulation

We conducted a separate analysis of therapeutic anticoagulation for intubated patients in a

single hospital within our health system. We hypothesized that therapeutic dose

anticoagulation for at least five days would have a survival advantage over prophylactic dose

anticoagulation, in mechanically ventilated patients using a risk-adjusted model. A minimum of

five days therapy was chosen based on the clinical observation that for many patients it took

between two to three days to achieve a therapeutic level of anti-coagulation based on

coagulation laboratory results.

Methods
Approval was obtained from Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Institutional

Review Board (IRB-20-0342) to perform a retrospective review of all COVID-19 positive adult

(age > 18) patients admitted to any of the ICU at The Mount Sinai Hospital between March 1,

2020 and April 11, 2020.

All patients were confirmed to have COVID-19 by PCR from

nasopharyngeal swab. Patients who died within five days of ICU admission were excluded.

Appendix: Consort Diagram).

(

Patients were eligible for treatment with therapeutic

anticoagulation if they did not have any of the following contraindications: active bleeding or a

3

platelet count <50x 10 /L on ICU admission, a history of heparin induced thrombocytopenia, or

a history of stroke within the past year.

Dosing of anticoagulation was based on ideal body weight and estimated glomerular

filtration rate (eGFR). Therapeutic heparin dose involved infusions of 15u/kg/hr or greater with

or without a heparin bolus of 80units/kg with the goal to achieve an activated prothrombin

time of 70-100 seconds based on institutional protocol. Therapeutic enoxaparin dose was

defined as 1mg/kg twice daily if the GFR was >30ml/min or once daily if the GFR ≤30ml/min.

Factor Xa levels were not routinely used to monitor the efficacy of anticoagulation with

enoxaparin during the study. In the prophylaxis group, patients received heparin 5000 units

subcutaneously two to three times daily, or enoxaparin 40mg twice daily if the GFR >30ml/min

or 40mg once daily if GFR ≤30ml/min. Newly initiated apixaban 2.5mg or 5mg twice daily was

considered prophylactic dosing.

We reviewed the electronic medical record of each patient to collect data including

demographics, comorbidities, laboratory values, and concurrent therapies (Table 1). Baseline

laboratory data were abstracted from the day of or date closest to admission to the ICU.

Baseline sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores were calculated from the date of

admission to the ICU. Concurrent medical therapies to treat COVID-19 based on hospital

protocols were also documented. Mortality data was obtained by following patients for 35

days from ICU admission. Bleeding complications were defined by a physician or consultant

evaluation for active bleeding and/or a decline in hematocrit requiring at least one unit of

blood transfusion.

Statistical Analysis:
Univariate analysis was performed and reported as number and percentage for

categorical variables. Mean and standard deviation or median and interquartile range were

reported for continuous variables. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare groups for

each continuous variable. Pearson’s chi-square or Fisher’s exact test were computed for

contingency tables of each categorical variable by group. For survival analyses, time from ICU

admission to date of death (or last date known alive) was used with right censoring and with

left truncation for those who died less than five days after ICU admission. Kaplan-Meier (KM)

plots were generated as unweighted, as well as, weighted by propensity scores (PS) generated

from logistic regression with all covariates, to adjust for baseline differences between groups.

For each patient, the weight was assigned as the inverse probability of belonging to the group

that they are in (inverse probability of treatment weight). The KM curves were compared by the

log-rank test. We ran a univariate and then followed with a multivariate Cox proportional

hazards regression model with the PS weights to adjust for potential confounding variables in

this time to death analysis and also to allow for creatinine to be a time-varying covariate in the

model. All analysis was performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS, Cary, NC). Statistical significance

was set at p <0.05.

Results
During the study period, 279 patients were admitted to the ICU and required

mechanical ventilation, of which 34 died within five days of admission. Thus 244 patients were

included in the analysis: 161 received therapeutic anticoagulation and 83 received prophylactic

anticoagulation. Baseline demographic and laboratory values are shown in

Table 1.

The

majority of patients in the treatment group received a combination of therapeutic enoxaparin

and heparin during their ICU course, rather than a single agent. On average, patients received

therapeutic anticoagulation for seventeen days during their hospitalization. The patients in

both groups had similar comorbidities including history of chronic kidney disease. Interestingly,

patients in the therapeutic anticoagulation group had higher baseline lactate levels (1.6mmol/L)

compared to the prophylaxis group (1.3mmol/L) (p<0.001). However, Mann-Whitney U tests

demonstrated that their baseline SOFA scores upon arrival to the ICU were comparable.

Patients with COVID-19 at our institution received multiple therapies based on protocols

and these were documented for both groups

(Table 2).

A slightly higher proportion of patients

received corticosteroids 87.0% in the TA group compared to 75.9% in the PA group (p=0.029).

The PA group was twice as likely to receive tocilizumab as the TA group (p=0.019). All other

therapies were equally administered across the two groups.

Based on our survival KM analysis 58% of patients who received therapeutic

anticoagulation survived to 35 days compared to 14% of patients in the prophylaxis group

(p<0.001). To adjust for baseline differences between the two groups a propensity score-

longer length of stay with 18 days in the ICU compared to 11 days in the prophylactic group

(Log rank test: p<0.001), which may reflect increased survival.

Adverse Outcomes
There was no significant difference in adverse outcomes between the groups for stroke (3.7%

vs 6.0%, p = 0.41) or liver failure (1.9% vs 2.4%, p = 1.0). There were trends towards increased

risk of bleeding and renal failure requiring dialysis in the TA group, but neither reached

statistical significance (

Survival
A univariate Cox proportional hazards regression was performed with the group and the

PS weights demonstrating treatment reduced mortality HR of 0.425 with a 95% C.I: (0.23, 0.78).

We then ran a multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model with the PS weights

adjusted by these covariates: anticoagulation for 5 days, age, gender, history of chronic kidney

disease, changes in creatinine over time, asthma, concurrent therapies (corticosteroids,

tocilizumab), lactate, baseline SOFA score, and time from intubation day

(Table 4).

We

analyzed the effect of date of intubation, to account for differences in treatment of COVID-19

over time during the study period. In the model, therapeutic anticoagulation for at least five

days reduced the rate of death by 79.1% [HR 0.209, 95% CI (0.10, 0.46), p <0.001]. Older

patients [HR 1.040, 95% CI (1.01, 1.07), p<0.007] had a significantly increased rate of death.

The absolute rate of death in the TA group was lower than the PA group, 34.2% vs. 53.0%

(p<0.005). Lastly, in terms of the changes in creatinine over a 21-day period after admission to

the ICU, we found that mortality increased by 26.7% (p<0.001) for each g/dL unit increase. All

other covariates including gender, prior anticoagulation, chronic renal disease, corticosteroid

use, date of intubation, and laboratory values did not have statistically significant hazard ratios

in the model. For the analyses, we assumed all available cases due to the pattern of missingness

not being at random in most of the lab measures, which violated using an imputation

procedure.

Discussion
In this retrospective cohort study, we found that therapeutic anticoagulation was

associated with markedly reduced mortality in intubated patients with COVID-19. This effect

persisted when adjusted for confounding using propensity weights. Although we observed a

slight trend towards increased bleeding complications in the TA group, this effect was not

statistically significant. These findings suggest that the benefits of initiating therapeutic

anticoagulation in intubated patients with COVID 19 outweighs the risk of bleeding.

stratify for critically ill patients

More recently, Paranjpe et al, analyzed outcomes for 2,773

COVID-19 patients treated throughout our hospital system and evaluated the effect of

anticoagulation on mortality

15

. This group reported that therapeutic anticoagulation was

associated with increased rates of mechanical ventilation, which is likely the result of a system-

wide anticoagulation protocol in which all patients admitted to the ICU were placed on

therapeutic anticoagulants. Our analysis confirms these findings while offering a greater level

of detail on the exact nature of anti-coagulation used and the adverse outcomes.

Limitations
There are several limitations to this study. First, due to its observational nature, there

exists the potential for confounding. Although we attempted to control for this using a

propensity matched model, the study took place during the COVID epidemic in NYC,

when adjustments to our protocols and guidelines for therapy were constantly made as new

information became available. The introduction of our anticoagulation protocol was one of

these changes. We were concerned that the improved outcomes in the TA group could

represent improvements in therapy as we gained experience managing these patients. We

attempted to examine the effect of timing by analyzing the effect of date of intubation on

outcome, which was not significant.

Another limitation is our decision to exclude patients who

died within 5 days of ICU admission (~10% of ICU admissions). This potentially introduces

23,24

immortal time bias.

We felt however that including these patients would have introduced

its own bias, since many of these patients died before having a chance to achieve full anti-

coagulated

Conclusion
We report a significant decrease in mortality among these patients when treated with

five days of therapeutic anticoagulation after intubation and demonstrate that survival

advantage persisted when adjusted for potential confounders such as baseline covariates and

concurrent therapies. We believe that these findings suggest that the initiation of therapeutic

anticoagulation for critically ill patients with COVID-19 who require mechanical ventilation is a

beneficial intervention.
