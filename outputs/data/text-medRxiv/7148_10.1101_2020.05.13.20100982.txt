Abstract
We investigated the relation between PCR examination rate among population and the
success of containment of COVID-19 for each country. Although there was moderate
correlation, multiple regression revealed that the success of containment was solely explained
by Gross Domestic Product per capita (GDP), which may well be related to the strict
compliance to social distancing. Close inspection of individual countries supported this
hypothesis. The social distancing must be the largest factor to achieve containment, and the
contribution of broad PCR tests is small.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is now a worldwide peril and its
control is an emergent issue. Expansion of PCR tests is generally believed to be the most
important key for containing the infection,1 together with social distancing. However, the
relation between examination rate and the success of containment has not been directly
studied to our knowledge. We investigated this issue based on the open data at websites.2,3
The rate of PCR tests among population (named as Examination Rate; ER) was
extracted from a website for countries having more than 1000 cases.2 To evaluate the success
of containment, the latest value of the new cases per 1 million population during 7 days in the
trajectory analysis3,4 was divided by its highest value, and was named as the Containment
Ratio (CR). We postulated that strict compliance to social distancing is better achieved in
advanced countries, and therefore Gross Domestic Product per capita (hereafter GDP) of each
country was adopted as another predictor variable. Countries lacking some data were
excluded. For instance, China was not included because ER is not known. The correlation
between CR and ER/GDP was investigated by simple and multiple regressions/correlations.
All statistical calculation was done using Microsoft Excel for Macintosh.
Included were 90 countries. Individual countries are plotted in Figure 1 using
logarithmic scales for every parameter. Notable countries are marked. As results, CR was
negatively correlated both with ER (r = -0.423, p < 0.0001) and GDP (r = -0.483, p <
0.00001). In multiple regression, p-values of partial regression coefficients were 0.336 for ER
and 0.009 for GDP, only the latter was significant. In other word, although CR was negatively
correlated with ER, this was thought to be due to confounding effect with GDP (ER and GDP
were highly correlated, r = 0.752). Accordingly, it is concluded that CR is explained by GDP
alone.
Close inspection of individual countries reveals several interesting facts. Countries with
the three highest ER in the world are Iceland, UAE, and Bahrain. Iceland achieved world best

containment, but in UAE and Bahrain the pandemic is not at all controlled. This may be
related to large population of foreign workers in these countries. Three South-East Asian
countries, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore having similar climate and economical states
(blue marks in Figure) showed a “positive” correlation, i.e. opposite to the general tendency.
Singapore achieved very high ER (3.8%) among Asian countries but CR remains high. This
may be related to the fact that Singapore government discouraged healthy peoples to wear a
mask until early April.5 However, this strategy may not have been so bad since attenuation of
virulence is reported in Singapore,6 and our analysis predicted the lowest Infection Fatal Rate
(0.005%) in the world in Singapore (unpublished results). The good result of Thailand may be
due to prompt and intensive preventive measures including lock-down.7 Japan is criticized by
its very low ER (0.19%).8 However, when compared with major western countries in north
hemisphere generally achieving 2 to 7% ER, its CR is almost similar to countries that
achieved fairly good containment (France, Spain, Germany, Italy), and is much better than
UK, USA or Sweden. These results imply that the social distancing is the largest factor to
achieve containment, and the contribution of broad PCR tests is smaller.
