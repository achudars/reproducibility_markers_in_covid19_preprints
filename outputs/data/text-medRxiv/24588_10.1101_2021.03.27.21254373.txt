Abstract
Background: Statins may be protective in viral infection and have been proposed as treatment in
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.
Objective: We evaluated the effect of statins on mortality in four groups hospitalized with
(SARS-CoV-2) infection (continued statin, newly initiated statin, discontinued statin, never on
statin).
Design: In a single center cohort study of 1179 patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2
infection, the outcome of death, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission or hospital discharge was
evaluated. Patients’ statin use, laboratory data, and co-morbidities were determined via chart
review and electronic health records. Using marginal structural models to account for timing of
statin initiation and competing risks, we compared the likelihood of severe outcomes in the four
statin exposure groups.
Setting: Academic medical center in the United States
Participants: Patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection
Measurements: 28-day mortality, ICU admission, or discharge
Results: Among 1179 patients, 360 were never on a statin, 311 were newly initiated on a statin,
466 were continued on a statin, and 42 had a statin discontinued. In this cohort, 154 (13.1%)
patients died by 28-days. With marginal structural model analysis, statin use reduced the hazard
of 28-day mortality (HR 0.566 [CI 0.372, 0.862], p = 0.008). Both new initiation of statins (HR
0.493 [CI 0.253, 0.963], p=0.038) and continuing statin therapy reduced the hazard of 28-day
mortality (HR 0.270 [CI 0.114, 0.637], p=0.003). Sensitivity analysis found that statin use was
associated with improved mortality for patients > 65 years, but not for patients 65 years or
younger.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the associated
disease (COVID-19) has resulted in millions of deaths (1). During the initial rush for treatments,
over 100 off-label and experimental drugs were used to treat patients with COVID-19 (2). Offlabel statin use was considered early in the pandemic at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH)
for several reasons, including: reports of cardiac complications and death due to COVID-19 (3,
4) and the cardioprotective effect of statins (5, 6); statins are low cost, widely available and
generally safe (7); and statins blunt the hyperinflammatory response from infection (8-10). It was
also suggested that statins block SARS-CoV-2 infectivity via binding to the main protease
mediating viral entry, inhibiting the virus’ ability to invade cells (11).
The safety and efficacy of statins for the treatment of patients hospitalized with COVID19 has remained uncertain. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the impact of statins in acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was unclear, with some trials showing no impact on
mortality (12, 13), while others found a significant improvement (14, 15). Observational studies
have similarly yielded mixed results regarding the effects of statins in COVID-19. These
investigations have been limited by small sample size (16-19), insufficient adjustments for time
varying confounders (16, 20, 21), and lack of a sub-cohort newly initiated on statins for COVID19 (20, 22-24).
During the surge in Spring 2020, a multidisciplinary group of physicians at MGH created
clinical guidelines that recommended starting statin therapy on patients hospitalized for COVID19 (25, 26). Clinicians were advised to continue pre-hospital statins and to start atorvastatin 40
mg daily on patients who had an evidence-based indication (e.g. hyperlipidemia). At times,
clinicians were also advised to start atorvastatin if the patient with COVID-19 had no

contraindication, though this guidance changed over the study period. This placed MGH in a
unique position to evaluate empirically the impact of starting patients on statin therapy during
hospitalization due to COVID-19.
We aimed to evaluate the effect of statins on 28-day mortality in patients hospitalized
with COVID-19, using robust causal inference methods (i.e., marginal structural Cox
proportional hazards models) to account for variable timing of statin initiation and competing
risks. Notably, our approach takes into account that the decision to initiate statins was influenced
both by baseline confounding factors as well as patients’ changing health condition during
hospitalization. We further aimed to evaluate the specific effect of new statin initiation on
survival.
Methods
Patient Selection
This study is based on an MGH cohort described previously (27). Inclusion criteria
included > 18 years of age and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection with reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction testing of nasopharyngeal or sputum specimens. For this study, we
included patients hospitalized between March and June 2020. This study was approved by the
local Institutional Review Board (IRB # 2020P000829); a waiver of informed consent was
granted.
Statin Exposure
Patients were categorized into four statin groups: (A) continued home statin during
hospitalization (“continued”), (B) discontinued home statin during hospitalization
(“discontinued”), (C) newly initiated statin during hospitalization (“newly initiated”), and (D)
did not use statins during or prior to hospitalization (“never”) [Figure 1]. Manual chart review,

supplemented by extracted medication orders from electronic health records in the Mass General
Brigham Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW), was performed to assess statin use both prior to
and during hospitalization.
Covariates and Outcomes
Chart abstraction collected information on patient age, sex, smoking status, medical
comorbidities, medications, hospitalization date, date of ICU admission, date of death or
discharge, need for invasive mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, and medications
used at hospitalization. Laboratory values, self-reported race/ethnicity and body mass index
(BMI) were extracted from the electronic health record.
Patients were followed from hospitalization until death, discharge, or 28 days from
presentation to care. The primary outcome was time to death. Patients who were discharged to
palliative care were classified as deceased on the day of their discharge. The secondary outcome
was time to a composite outcome of ICU admission or death. For this secondary outcome, a
patient must have received statins during hospitalization but prior to ICU admission to be
categorized as newly initiated or continued.
Statistical Analysis
We examined the differences between baseline characteristics among the four statin
treatment groups. The median and interquartile ranges are presented for continuous variables and
the counts and percentage are presented for categorical variables. For statistical tests, we
conducted Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables and Kruskal-Wallis test by ranks for
continuous variables.
Analyses that stratify patients by in-hospital statin use are subject to both immortal time
bias and time-varying confounding, as a patient’s changing health condition affected when and

whether they initiated statins (28). To address these challenges, we used marginal structural Cox
proportional hazards models to evaluate the effect of statin initiation on the primary and
secondary outcomes (29). Patients who were discharged alive or to a non-palliative care facility
were categorized together as discharged. We fit a pooled multinomial regression to account for
discharge as a competing risk alongside the outcome to fit the weighted Cox model (30). If
patients did not experience the outcome and were not discharged by 28 days, they were treated as
administratively censored.
Using the marginal structural Cox model, we estimated the hazard ratio of each outcome
for initiating statins vs. not initiating statins by the previous day. We excluded patients who
experienced the outcome on the day of admission, as there was no opportunity for in-hospital
statin use to affect the risk of the outcome. The model we fit assumes that once initiated, the
duration of in-hospital statin use does not affect the hazard of the outcome.
To fit the marginal structural Cox model, we used inverse probability weighting with
stabilized weights trimmed at the 5th and 95th percentiles. Because all patients were followed
until 28 days unless they experienced the outcome or were discharged, censoring weights were
not used. The following baseline variables were included in the weighting models: demographic
variables (sex, age>65 years, race, active smoker, BMI>30), comorbidities on admission
(coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, chronic
liver disease, active cancer, pulmonary disease), ACE inhibitor medication status at presentation
to care, number of days from March 1st, 2020 to the date of hospitalization to account for era
effect, and prior statin usage. The following time-varying daily lab measurements were also
included and log-transformed: absolute lymphocyte count, white blood cell count (WBC),
aspartate aminotransferase (AST), C-reactive protein (CRP), creatine kinase (CK) and alanine

aminotransferase (ALT). To account for missingness in both baseline and time-varying data, we
used multiple imputation with 25 imputations. Peak lab values were calculated for each statin
group, defined as the highest lab measurement observed between hospital admission and death,
discharge, or end of follow-up, whichever came first. These lab values were calculated
irrespective of the exact timing of statin initiation.
For the primary outcome of mortality, we adjusted for ICU admission status each day as
a time-varying covariate. 95% confidence intervals and p-values were calculated, accounting for
the uncertainty due to estimation of the weighting models (30), and results across imputations
were combined using Rubin’s rules (31).
The analysis was repeated for the primary and secondary outcomes on the subset of
patients who were not prior users (“Newly initiated” vs. “Never”) and patients who were prior
users (“Continued” vs. “Discontinued”). In total, six models were fit. An additional analysis was
performed using E-values to assess robustness of the observed results to unmeasured
confounding. The E-value is a measure that assesses how strong an unmeasured confounder
would have to be to fully explain away the observed results (32, 33).Stratified analysis was also
performed to assess whether the effect of statins in patients above and below 65 years of age.
All analyses were conducted in R Version 4.0.2 (34). The nnet package (35) was used to fit the
multinomial regression model and the Jomo package (36) was used to perform multiple
imputation of multilevel data, which included demographic characteristics as well as timevarying laboratory measures.
Role of the Funding Source
Support for this study was provided by the MGH Division of Clinical Research. Funding
was used primarily to support the MGH COVID-19 registry development and statistical analysis.

Results
Baseline Characteristics
Overall, 1179 adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included, after
the exclusion of 7 patients who were deceased, discharged, or censored on the day of their
hospital admission (Appendix Table 1). 676 (57.3%) were male, 443 (37.6%) were at least 65
years old, and 493 (45.9%) had a BMI ≥30. Patient characteristics differed by statin group
(Table 1). Patients on statins prior to hospitalization (groups A and B) were older (median age
69 vs. 52 years, p < 0.001), and had higher rates of coronary artery disease (28.7% vs 3.1%, p <
0.001), congestive heart failure (18.9% vs. 5.1%, p < 0.001), hypertension (74.4% vs. 34.3%, p <
0.001), type 2 diabetes (55.9% vs. 17.1%, p < 0.001), and dyslipidemia (66.7% vs. 15.6%, p <
0.001) than those not on statins prior to hospitalization (groups C and D). White/non-Hispanics
were more likely to be on statins prior to hospitalization than Hispanics (56.4% of White/nonHispanics on statins vs. 32.9% of Hispanics on statins, p < 0.001).
In total, 777 patients (65.9%) received a statin during their hospitalization for COVID-19.
Atorvastatin was the most common statin prescribed before and during hospitalization. 274/285
(96.1%) patients newly initiated on statins and 331/434 (76.3%) patients continued on statins
were prescribed atorvastatin. The most common dosage was moderate intensity (atorvastatin
40mg daily). Among those continued on statins, the majority were prescribed statins for more
than a year prior to hospitalization (244/466, 52.4%). Appendix Table 2 contains information on
when statins were initiated during hospitalization relative to admission date.
According to first laboratory measurements obtained during hospitalization, the group of
patients who discontinued statins at hospitalization had higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate (p

= 0.046), CK (p = 0.001), troponin (p < 0.001), and D-dimer (p = 0.002) compared to the other
cohorts (Table 1).
Unadjusted Analysis
In the complete cohort, 154 (13.1%) patients died and 841 (71.3%) were discharged
within 28 days of follow up. In unadjusted analyses, patients on statins during hospitalization
(groups A and C) had similar rates of death (108 (13.9%) vs. 46 (11.4%), p = 0.273), but higher
rates of ongoing hospitalization at 28 days (144 (18.5%) vs. 40 (10.0%), p < 0.001) and ICU
admission (276 (35.5%) vs. 85 (21.1%), p < 0.001) than those not on statins during
hospitalization (groups B and D) (Table 2).
Peak Laboratory Values
Unadjusted peak liver biochemistries and inflammatory markers differed across statin
groups (Table 3), with the highest peaks of AST and ALT in the newly initiated statin group.
Patients newly initiated on statins had a lower peak CK than those who discontinued statins
(median and interquartile range: 222 [90-636] U/L vs. 374 [89-838] U/L), but higher peak CK
than those who continued (178 [85-507] U/L) or were never on statins (173 [78-578] U/L).
Primary Outcome Analysis
The median time to death in each statin group can be found in Table 1. Overall, statin
usage during hospitalization (groups A and C) decreased the hazard of death (HR 0.566 [95% CI
0.372, 0.862], p=0.008). In the sub-group of patients not on statin therapy prior to hospitalization
(groups C and D), new statin initiation at hospitalization (group C) decreased the hazard of death
(HR 0.493 [95% CI 0.253, 0.963], p=0.038). The sub-group of patients on statin therapy prior to
hospitalization (groups A and B), continued statin usage (group A) also decreased the hazard of

death (HR 0.270 [95% CI 0.114,0.637], p=0.003) (Figure 2). A summary of the distribution of
missing laboratory measurements can be found in Appendix Table 3.
Secondary Outcome Analysis
To fit the marginal structural model for the secondary outcome of time to death or ICU
admission, 198 patients were excluded because they were admitted to the ICU on their day of
hospitalization and therefore did not contribute time at risk for the secondary outcome
(Appendix Table 1). Of the 981 patients remaining, 588 (59.9%) had recorded statin use during
their hospitalization. Statin use during hospitalization (groups A and C) did not change the
hazard of the composite outcome of death or ICU admission (HR 0.846 [95% CI 0.600,1.192],
p=0.340) (Figure 2 and Appendix Table 4).
Analysis of Unmeasured Confounding
For the primary outcome assessing mortality, the point estimate and the upper confidence
limit of the E-value associated with statin use during hospitalization is 2.326 and 1.455,
respectively. Given that the E-value of 2.326 is much greater than any observed known risk
factors examined in the current study (with the exception of age), it is unlikely that an
unmeasured confounder exists that would explain away the observed effect in the present
analysis. The point estimate and the upper confidence limit of the E-value associated with new
initiation of statins is 2.639 and 1.191, respectively. The point estimate and the upper confidence
limit of the E-value associated with continuation of statins is 4.305 and 2.073, respectively.
Sensitivity Analyses for Age
We fit a marginal structural model for the primary outcome of time to death in both a
subgroup of patients 65 years of age or younger (746 patients) and patients older than 65 years
(443 patients). Statin use during hospitalization did not change the hazard of death in patients ≤

65 years (HR 1.175 [95% CI 0.520, 2.655], p=0.699) (Appendix Table 5); however, patients >
65 years were found to have a decreased hazard of death with any statin use during
hospitalization (HR 0.477 [95% CI 0.292, 0.78], p=0.003) and within the subgroup of patients
newly initiated on statins during hospitalization (HR 0.321 [ 95% CI 0.137, 0.752], p= 0.009)
(Appendix Table 6).
Discussion
In this large cohort from a single tertiary medical center, we found that statin use during
hospitalization for COVID-19 was associated with improved short-term mortality. The survival
benefit was seen in those who continued statin therapy, as well as those who newly initiated
therapy while hospitalized. A sensitivity analysis found that statin use was associated with
improved mortality for patients older than 65 years, but not for patients 65 years old or younger.
Our study confirms and expands on prior work. A recent propensity score-matched
analysis found that statin use prior to hospitalization reduces the risk of short-term in-hospital
mortality from COVID-19 (23). Our study probed further, into whether in-hospital statin use had
a similar effect on mortality. To investigate the impact of statins administered during
hospitalization, we used marginal structural models, which account for both survivorship bias
(i.e., patients need to survive long enough to begin statins) and time-varying confounding bias
(i.e., patient health status during hospitalization changes over time, affecting the propensity of
initiating treatment). Our study accounted for a wide variety of time-varying confounders, which
we believe accurately captures shifts in the propensity of initiating treatment. We further
expanded on prior work by specifically evaluating the effect of statin initiation during
hospitalization without prior use, because 26% of our cohort was newly initiated on statins
during COVID-19 hospitalization. Overall, the novel findings presented here are that statin

therapy during hospitalization, whether it be a new or continued prescription, was associated
with improved mortality.
The composition of our cohort was similar to other published patient databases of
patients with COVID-19 (17, 22, 24). The median age of patients was 60 years old (IQR 47-73
years). Obese patients with a BMI ≥30 represented almost half the population, consistent with
evidence that obesity is a risk factor for hospitalization with COVID-19 (37). Racial and ethnic
demographics vary immensely across the literature. In this study, White/Non-Hispanic (38.5%)
and Hispanic patients (36.4%) were most common, followed by Black/Non-Hispanic patients
(10.8%). This cohort’s mortality rate (13.1%) was similar to the mean published United States
hospital mortality rates for patients admitted with COVID-19 during the first 6 months of the
pandemic (11.8%) among 955 hospitals (38).
Our findings contradict some prior reports. One meta-analysis of 3,449 patients in 9
observational studies found that statin use did not improve severe outcomes or mortality in
COVID-19 (39). The majority of these studies were small in size (as few as 50 patients) and
most failed to control for potential confounders. Comorbidities such as diabetes, cardiovascular
disease and obesity are established risk factors for more severe COVID-19 disease, and patients
prescribed statins are more likely to have these comorbidities, highlighting the critical need to
control for confounding in this analysis (18). Additionally, most prior work either examined the
relationship with antecedent statin usage prior to hospitalization (19, 21-24) or exclusively
during hospitalization (16, 18, 20). Our study had several advantages over prior reports: our
study investigated the influence of statin use both prior to and during hospitalization, minimized
immortal time bias, adjusted for time-varying confounders, and minimized era effect (or the

potential changes in COVID-19 care over time). These advantages provide clarity not offered by
prior work.
The duration of statin therapy required to provide mortality benefit in COVID-19 remains
unclear. This study suggests that statins are associated with a survival benefit even after brief
exposure during hospitalization. Interestingly, in a large trial measuring mortality in US Veterans
over the age of 75, statins did not affect mortality from cardiovascular events until at least 2
years of daily usage (40). However, a cardiology trial found that administration of atorvastatin
within 24 to 96 hours of hospitalization for myocardial ischemia, compared with placebo,
reduced the incidence of cardiovascular events including death, further myocardial infarction,
and cardiac arrest (41). The main therapeutic mechanism of action of statins may be endothelial
stabilization as well as its effects on inflammation (41). Given the association between COVID19 infection and a hyperinflammatory response that provokes cardiovascular disorders (6), it is
possible that new initiation of statins even for a short duration could have provided a positive
impact on both mortality and secondary complications.
Another proposed explanation for statins’ mechanism of action in COVID-19 is the
drug’s ability to inhibit hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, which may interfere with
the virus’ invasion into cells by compromising the lipid-rich membrane required for SARS-CoV2 to interact with the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (42, 43). If statins
improve COVID-19 outcomes by inhibiting viral cell invasion, the benefit may be enhanced
when statins are prescribed before infection.
In this study, we found an association with mortality benefit with statin use in adults over
65 years old but not in patients 65 years or younger. Given these findings were generated from a

COVID-19, but do not believe that age should be a contraindication to statin use during COVID19 hospitalization.
Liver biochemistries are frequently elevated in severe COVID-19 disease and are
associated with worse clinical outcomes (44). Separately, statins are known to increase liver
biochemistries in certain patients (42). In our study, newly initiated statin use was associated
with higher levels of peak AST and ALT throughout hospitalization; however, only 16% of
patients on statins developed an ALT level greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal, which
is a similar rate compared other cohorts with severe COVID (45). These findings are limited in
that peak levels could have occurred before or after statin initiation and were unadjusted for
confounding. Despite these limitations, there is no clear evidence that statin exposure during
infection is associated with clinically important hepatotoxicity.
Myotoxicity is a known, albeit rare, complication of statins. In the context of COVID-19,
where creatinine kinase elevations are prevalent, there is concern that statins could increase
myotoxicity and subsequent creatinine kinase-induced nephrotoxicity. This was not seen among
individuals newly initiated on statins or continued on statin therapy, with creatinine kinase peak
levels never reaching three times the upper limit of normal, clinically considered the threshold
for acute kidney injury due to pigment associated nephropathy (46).
Our findings must be interpreted in the context of study design. Although we utilized two
data sources to confirm demographics, medications, laboratory data and clinical outcomes,
misclassification errors are possible. We limited this error rate by employing physician review of
discrepant data. Additionally, we were unable to account for patients who had dose escalations in
their statin usage or who had their statin temporarily held during hospitalization. It is important
to note that peak liver biochemistry levels (AST and ALT) as well as peak CK level were

compared with unadjusted analyses and timing of statin initiation was not taken into account.
Finally, patients who were on statin therapy prior to hospitalization but had the medication
discontinued during hospitalization, presumably due to organ dysfunction, are a unique subcohort of patients that warrant further exploration. We utilized matched weighting within our
marginal structural model to adjust for potential bias introduced by the extreme illness of this
group.
After adjusting for cofounding factors, our study found that inpatient statin therapy was
associated with improved 28-day mortality in COVID-19. This benefit was found in those who
continued and newly initiated statins. Given the safety and availability of statins worldwide, a
randomized controlled trial of statins in COVID-19 should be considered.

Figure 2: Marginal Structural Model Outputs for Primary and Secondary Outcomes.
Estimates were obtained from fitting marginal structural Cox models adjusted for the following baseline covariates:
s:
sex, age>65 years, race, active smoker, BMI≥30, comorbidities on admission (coronary artery disease, congestive
heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, chronic liver disease, active cancer, pulmonary disease), ACE
inhibitor use, number of days since March 1st, 2020, and prior statin usage. The following time-varying covariates
were adjusted for as well: ALC, WBC, AST, CRP, CK, ALT, and ICU admission status. Models were fit accounting
for immortal time bias, time-varying confounding, and discharge as a competing risk.
