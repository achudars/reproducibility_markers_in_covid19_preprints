Abstract
Data visualization is an essential tool for exploring and communicating findings in
medical research, especially in epidemiological surveillance. The COVID19-Global
online web application systematically produces daily updated data visualization and
analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic on a global scale. It collects automatically daily
data on COVID-19 diagnosed cases and mortality worldwide from January 1st, 2020
onwards. We have implemented comparative data visualization between countries for
the most common indicators in epidemiological surveillance to follow an epidemic:
attack rate, population fatality rate, case fatality rate, and basic reproduction number.
The application may help for a better understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic
worldwide.

1. INTRODUCTION
The first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 in China was reported to the WHO country
office in China on December 31st, 2019 (1). The outbreak was declared a public health
emergency of international concern on January 30th, 2020 (1). Since then, 215
countries have been affected worldwide, 4,722,233 people have been diagnosed
cases, and 313,266 have died due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (2).
Data visualization and analysis is an essential tool for exploring and communicating
findings in medical research, and especially in epidemiological surveillance (3). It can
help researchers and policymakers identify trends that could be overlooked if the data
were reviewed in tabular form. We have developed a Shiny application to compare
epidemiological indicators on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.

2. SOFTWARE AVAILABILITY AND REQUIREMENTS
The COVID19-Tracker app has been developed in RStudio (4), version 1.2.5033, using
the Shiny package, version 1.4.0. Shiny offers the ability to develop a graphical user
interface (GUI) that can be run locally or deployed online. Last is particularly beneficial
to show and communicate updated findings to a broad audience. All the analyses have
been carried out using R (5), version 3.6.3.
The application has a friendly structure based on menus to shown data visualization
for the most common indicators in epidemiological surveillance to follow an epidemic:
attack rate, population fatality rate, case fatality rate, and basic reproduction number
(Figure 1).

SARS-CoV-2 worldwied. Available at: https://ubidi.shinyapps.io/covid19global/

Two additional menus are already implemented to describe the epidemiological
indicators analyses and collecting other applications, also developed in Shiny, by other
users to follow the COVID19 epidemic globally.
The app has an automated process to update data and all analyses every time a user
connects

to

the

app.

It

is

available

online

at

the

following

link:

https://ubidi.shinyapps.io/covid19global/ and shortly free available on Github as an R
package. The application allows comparing epidemiological indicators between
countries on the current date or since the start of the epidemic in each country. The
displayed graphs are mouse-sensitive, showing the observed and expected number of
events through the plot. The graphs can also be displayed on a log scale. Likewise,
when selecting any plot, the application allows the option of downloading it as a
portable network graphic (*.png). All menus are available in English, Spanish, and
Catalan.

3. DATA SOURCES
We collected daily data on COVID-19 diagnosed cases and mortality, from January 1s,
2020, onwards. Data is collected automatically from the ECDC’s (European Centre for
Disease Prevention and Control) the geographical distribution of COVID-19 cases
worldwide (6). The downloadable dataset is updated daily and contains the latest
available public data on COVID-19 worldwide.

4. METHODS
We have implemented a data visualization for the following epidemiological indicators:
The attack rate is the ratio between the positively diagnosed cases (T+) and the total
population (P) in a given country (AR = C+/P).
The population fatality rate is the ratio between the positively diagnosed deaths (D+)
and the population (P) in a given country (PFR = D+/P).
The case fatality rate is the ratio between the positively diagnosed deaths (D+) and the
positively tested cases (C+) in a given country (CFR = D+/C+).
The basic reproduction number (R0) is the average number of secondary cases of
disease caused by a single infected individual over his or her infectious period (7).
Here, we used the R package EpiEstim to estimate the R0 (7).
Figure 2 shows an example of these indicators comparing the six most affected
countries worldwide (United States, Russia, Brazil, Spain, United Kingdom and Italy up
to May 17th, 2020) since the epidemic started in each country.

5. DISCUSSION
Disease surveillance forms the basis for response COVID-19 epidemic and requires
knowing trends in disease frequency in different subgroups and locations. The
COVID19-Global application provides a global overview for the epidemiological
surveillance of the pandemic worldwide, visualizing in a simple and intuitive way the
main epidemiological indicators of all countries affected by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic
with daily updated data.
Country comparisons based on counts and their trends across populations and places
should be replaced by rate comparisons adjusting the count to the size of the
population (8). However, we should acknowledge that it is not possible to make an
accurate estimate of the rates due to the underreporting of diagnosed cases and
mortality in official statistics (9). Moreover, the application does not take into account
the changes in the definition of diagnosed cases, nor the lockdown measures are
undertaken in each country, aiming to flatten the curve. Moreover, the selection of the
number of people who have been tested is critical for an accurate estimation (8).
Accurate estimation of the rates depends on the testing strategy, the prevalence of
infection, and the test accuracy. Differences between countries or overtime may
merely reflect differences in selection for testing and test performance (8). In any case,
a routine health system data of basic epidemiological indicators for the SARS-CoV-2
pandemic allowing for the comparison between countries, is essential for surveillance
epidemiology and health policy.
We continue to plan improvements to the application to include specific data
visualizations by country and aggregated by geographical regions. In summary, this
application, easy to use, comes to fill a gap in this particular scenario for the
visualization of epidemiological data for the COVID-19 at a global scale.
