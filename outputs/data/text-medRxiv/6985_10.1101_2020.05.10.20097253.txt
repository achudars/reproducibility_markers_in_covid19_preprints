Abstract
Background
Exploring the association of coronavirus-2019 disease (COVID-19) mortality with chronic preexisting conditions may promote the importance of targeting these populations during this
pandemic to optimize survival. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to
explore the association of pre-existing conditions with COVID-19 mortality.
Methods
We searched MEDLINE, OVID databases, SCOPUS, and medrxiv.org for the period December
1, 2019, to May 1, 2020. The outcome of interest was the risk of COVID-19 mortality in
patients with and without pre-existing conditions. Comorbidities explored were cardiovascular
diseases (coronary artery disease, hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, and congestive heart
failure), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer, chronic kidney disease,
chronic liver disease, and stroke. Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed the risk
of bias. All analyses were performed using random-effects models and heterogeneity was
quantified.

Ten

in

the

meta-analysis

(n=61,455 patients with COVID-19; mean age, 61 years; 57% male). Overall the betweenstudy study heterogeneity was medium and studies had low publication bias and high quality.
Coronary heart disease, hypertension, congestive heart failure, and cancer significantly increased
the risk of mortality from COVID-19. The risk of mortality from COVID-19 in patients with
coronary heart disease was 2.4 times as high as those without coronary heart disease (RR= 2.40,
95%CI=1.71-3.37, n=5) and twice as high in patients with hypertension as high as that compared
to those without hypertension (RR=1.89, 95%CI= 1.58-2.27, n=9). Patients with cancer also
were at twice the risk of mortality from COVID-19 compared to those without cancer (RR=1.93
95%CI 1.15-3.24, n=4), and those with congestive heart failure were at 2.5 times the risk of
mortality compared to those without congestive heart failure (RR=2.66, 95%CI 1.58-4.48, n=3).

Introduction
The number of total cases of the coronavirus-2019 disease (COVID-19) continues to rise
quickly, threatening thousands to millions of individuals with preexisting chronic conditions who
are disproportionately affected.1 To date, May 5, 2020, the John Hopkins University coronavirus
resource center reported that worldwide more than 180 countries have been affected with
COVID-19 with more than three million confirmed cases and more than 250,000 deaths.2 As
research related to potential risk factors for COVID-19 mortality continues, it is becoming clear
that individuals with underlying conditions, such as cardiovascular disease (coronary artery
disease, congestive heart failure [CHF], hypertension, and cardiac arrhythmias), cancer, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and
chronic liver disease (CLD), all may be at an increased risk of death.1,3,4 As the number of
published studies increase, there is a widening gap due to inconsistent findings related to the
influence that types of pre-existing comorbidities have on COVID-19 mortality. Some studies
report an association between preexisting conditions and COVID-19 mortality, whereas others
report no association. With this being said, it is clear that regions experiencing the highest
mortality rates, such as the United States, Europe, and China, also have the greatest burden of
these preexisting chronic conditions.5
The novel virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the
causative agent of COVID-19, interacts with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a
cellular receptor expressed in the heart, kidney, pulmonary alveolar type II cells.6 It has been
postulated, though not confirmed, that preexisting use of angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers

(ARBs) may upregulate membrane-bound ACE2 hence increasing susceptibility to virus entry.7
Therefore, it is plausible that individuals with preexisting chronic conditions such as high blood
pressure and chronic heart failure taking ARBs may be more susceptible to the severity of
SARS-CoV-2, including mortality.
To date, studies that have systematically explored the association of a range of preexisting chronic conditions and COVID-19 mortality have limitation in the number of countries
and number of conditions explored.8,9 We took a comprehensive approach and explored the
association of major preexisting chronic conditions, including cardiovascular diseases such as
coronary artery disease, CHF, stroke, hypertension, and cardiac arrhythmia, type 2 diabetes,
COPD, asthma, cancer, HIV/AIDS, CKD, CLD, and stroke and the risk of mortality from
COVID-19. Although the majority of studies occurred in China, we identified additional studies
involving patients from Europe and North America. We hypothesize that the risk of mortality in
COVID-19 patients is higher in patients with preexisting chronic conditions.
Methods
We performed a systematic literature search of PubMed (MEDLINE), OVID
(MEDLINE, HEALTHSTAR), SCOPUS, and medrxiv.org, using search criteria provided in the
supplemental material (Supplemental Document 1). We followed the standards of the Metaanalysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE, Supplemental Table 1).10 This
initial search was supplemented by scanning of the references lists of relevant publications, and
identifying their citations through the Web of Sciences (snowballing). We identified all studies
published between October 1, 2019, and May 1st, 2020 reporting the risk of mortality in patients
with COVID-19. Our search criteria included the following keywords and MesH terms:
(“COVID-19” OR “Coronavirus” or “SARS-CoV-2”) AND (“Mortality”) AND (“cardiovascular

“HIV/AIDS” OR” Human immunodeficiency virus infection and acquired immune deficiency
syndrome”). Two reviewers (ESH and AES) independently screened titles and abstracts of the
studies for inclusion eligibility.
Inclusion criteria
Studies were included in the analysis if they met the following inclusion criteria:
COVID-19 was diagnosed based on the World Health Organization guidance;11 studies
examined the association of any of the preexisting comorbidities and COVID-19; the risk point
estimates reported as odds ratios (ORs), relative risks (RRs), or hazard ratios (HRs) or the data
was presented such that the OR, (RR), or HR could be calculated; the 95% CI was reported, or
the data were presented such that the 95% CI could be calculated. We excluded cases reports,
studies not conducted on humans, review papers, meta-analyses, literature reviews and
commentaries. All excluded studies were documented with reasons for their exclusion.
Quality Assessment and Data Extraction
Since all of our studies were non-randomized observational studies, we used the
Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for quality assessment (Supplemental Document 2 and 3).12
Studies were first screened based on titles and abstracts by AES and ESH. If they met the
inclusion criteria, then full-text was obtained and they were screened. In the event of
disagreement, a third researcher (PS) was recruited to reach a consensus. Information extracted
from included studies included title, year of publication, country, number of participants with
each comorbidity who died and did not die, the RR/OR/HR of mortality of COVID-19 with each

underlying condition, the mean or median age, proportion that was male, and other findings of
interest.
Data analysis
We adopted a narrative approach to describing the number of studies, study settings,
diagnoses criteria for COVID-19, and the proportion of gender and race from each study. Our
primary outcome was the risk of mortality in COVID-19 associated with preexisting chronic
diseases. According to the previous study, if the outcome is rare in all populations and
subgroups, the distinctions among different measures of RRs (e.g., odds ratios, rate ratios, and
risk ratios) can be ignored 13, thus we combined RRs and HRs with ORs in the present metaanalysis and reported the pooled effect size as RRs as common risk estimates for all studies. We
used the reported ORs, RRs, or HRs as the measures of the association between preexisting
chronic conditions and the risk of mortality in COVID-19.
For studies without measures of associations, generalized linear mixed model were used
to calculate the odds ratios using the number of events and the sample size of each study group.14
RRs, HRs and ORs in the present meta-analysis were reported as the pooled effect size as RRs
as common risk estimates for all studies. First reported effect sizes were log-transformed to
normalize the distributions. Second, standard errors (SEs) were calculated via the following
equations 15: Lower = log (lower 95% CI) and upper = log (upper 95% CI), and SE = (upper lower)/3.92. To assess the associations between preexisting conditions and the risk of mortality,
we pooled the RR estimates for the presence versus absence of preexisting conditions from each
study, weighted by the inverse of their variances (inter-study plus intra-study variances). The
metagen function from the R package meta was used to calculate the pooled effect estimates
using random-effects models.16 We invoked random-effects models to pool study results for the

association between preexisting chronic conditions and the risk of mortality. Because of the few
studies we identified, we did not conduct any meta-regression or subgroup analyses. 16 The
DerSimonian and Laird (DL) random-effects method was used to estimate the pooled inter-study
variance (heterogeneity).17 We graphically displayed individual and pooled estimates with forest
plots. Inter-study heterogeneity was assessed using I2 statistics, expressed as % (low (25%),
moderate (50%), and high (75%) and Cochrane’s Q statistic (significance level < 0.05) 18,19.
Potential ascertainment bias (as might be caused by publication bias) was assessed with funnel
plots, by plotting the study effect size against standard errors of the effect size, and Egger’s
test.20 All statistical analyses with R software, version 3.4.3 (R, College Station, TX).

Results
As shown in Figure 1, we identified a total of 261 studies from Scopus, OVID, PubMed,
and Joana Briggs International EBF database. A total of 57 studies were excluded because as
duplicates, leaving 204 studies to explore for inclusion. An additional 98 studies were excluded
based on titles and abstracts and another 87 studies based on full text, which resulted in 19
studies for the quantitative analysis. The process yielded a total of 61,455 patients for the
quantitative analysis, with 17 studies performed in China,3,4,21-32 1 in Italy,33 and 1 that included
11 countries from North America, Europe, and Asia.1 (Table 1).

The risk of mortality from COVID-19 in patients with any cardiovascular disease
Of the nine studies that reported the risk of mortality associated with preexisting
cardiovascular disease, 5 reported a significant association. The risk ratio point estimates for
mortality from COVID-19 and cardiovascular disease ranged from 0.72 to 6.0 (Figure 2A). The
overall pooled risk ratio of COVID-19 mortality associated with any cardiovascular disease was
2.35(95% CI: 1.44-3.84), implying a 2-fold increase in mortality. Between-study variation was
moderate (I2= 65, p<0.01).

The risk of mortality from COVID-19 in patients with preexisting chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease
Three of seven studies that explored the association of preexisting COPD and COVID-19
mortality found that patients with COPD were at a significantly higher risk of mortality from
COVID-19 compared to patients without COPD (Figure 2B). The pooled risk estimates for
mortality from COVID-19 in patients with COPD was 1.76 (95% CI: 0.92-3.36), indicating that
although the association was positive, it significant. Between-study heterogeneity was moderate
(I2= 73, p<0.01).

The risk of mortality from COVID-19 in patients with preexisting coronary artery disease
Preexisting coronary artery disease significantly increased patient’s risk of mortality from
COVID-19 (Figure 2C). Five studies reported the risk ratio of dying from COVID-19 with

underlying coronary heart disease. Four studies were from China and one international study
including patients from the United State. The risk ratio point estimates ranged from 1.3 to 3.2.
Compared to COVID-19 patients without preexisting coronary heart disease, the risk of mortality
in COVID-19 patients with coronary artery disease increased by 2-fold 95% CI: 1.58-2.27). The
between-study heterogeneity was low (I2= 0%, p=0.79).
The risk of mortality from COVID-19 in patients with preexisting hypertension
Eight studies from China, and one from Italy, reported the risk of mortality from COVID19 in patients with hypertension (Figure 3A). Patients with hypertension were nearly twice as
likely to die from COVID-19 compared to patients without hypertension (RR: 1.89 95% CI:
1.58-2.27). Between-study heterogeneity was low (I2= 0%, p=0.61).

The risk of mortality from COVID-19 in patients with preexisting type 2 diabetes
Twelve studies reported the risk of mortality from COVID-19 in patients with type 2
diabetes (Figure 3B). Of these, four studies found that patients with type 2 diabetes were at a
significantly higher risk of mortality. Pooled estimates from random-effects models were not
significant (RR:1.37, 95% CI: 0.85-2.20). Between-study heterogeneity was high (I2= 87%,
p<0.01).

The risk of mortality from COVID-19 in patients with cancer
Four studies reported the COVID-19 mortality risk in patients with cancer (Figure 3C).
Feng and colleagues and Guan and colleagues found that those with cancer were 2.5-3.5 times as
likely to die from COVID-19 compared to those without cancer, however other studies found no
significant association with COVID-19 mortality risk. Random-effects model pooled estimates

was significant. COVID-19 patients with cancer were nearly twice as likely to die as COVID-19
patients without cancer (RR: 1.93, 95% CI: 1.15-3.24). Between-study heterogeneity was low
(I2= 22%, p=0.28).

The risk of mortality from COVID-19 in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD)
Four studies reported the risk of mortality from COVID-19 in patients with CKD (Figure
4A). One of these studies found that patients with chronic kidney disease were at increased risk
of mortality from COVID-19. Pooled risk ratio estimates of 2,172 patients with CKD showed no
significant association (RR: 2.36 95% CI: 0.97-5.77). Between-study heterogeneity was medium
(I2= 63%, p=0.04).

The risk of mortality from COVID-19 in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD)
Two studies reported the association of CLD and risk of mortality from COVID-19
(Figure 4B). Both studies found no association CLD the risk of mortality. Pooled effect
estimates were RR: 1.57 95% CI: 0.70-3.50. Between-study heterogeneity was low (I2= 0%,
p=0.32).

The risk of mortality from COVID-19 in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF)
Patients with CHF had a 3-fold higher risk of mortality from COVID-19 compared to
those without CHF (Figure 4C, RR: 2.66, 95% CI :1.58-4.48). Among the three studies
reporting the risk of mortality from COVID-19 in patients with CHF, the risk ratio point
estimates ranged from 2.44 to 3.89. Between-study heterogeneity low (I2= 0%, p=0.83).

The risk of mortality from COVID-19 in patients with stroke
Three studies from China explored whether patients with a history of stroke were at an
increased risk of COVID-19 mortality (Figure 4D). Two of the three studies found that patients
with stroke were at a significantly higher risk of mortality, resulting in a pooled RR of 2.72, 95%
CI: 0.90-8.21. Between-study heterogeneity high (I2= 75%, p=0.02).

One study reported the association between arrhythmia and COVID-19 mortality.1 COVID-19
patients with preexisting arrhythmia were 95% more likely to die compared to those without.
OR: 1.95 (1.33– 2.86). We did not find studies reporting associations of HIV/AIDS and asthma
and COVID-19 risk of mortality.

Publication Bias and Study Quality

The funnel plot (Supplemental Figure 1,2,3,4) and the value of the Egger’s test
(p=0.83,0.43.0.45.0.87 for figures 2A, 2B, 2C, 3A respectively) indicated absences of
publication bias. The median study quality score for studies was 9 out of 9 (range=6–9, Table 1).

Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis to
include COVID-19 cases from across Europe, Asia and North America, while also having the
largest sample size (N=61,455) and number of studies (n=19). This meta-analysis was based on
data from 19 studies with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Our findings suggest that patients
with preexisting chronic conditions had a higher risk of death from COVID-19, particularly any
cardiovascular disease, hypertension, coronary heart disease, CHF, and cancer. Our findings
further highlight two important points. First, the failure of allostasis caused by preexisting

conditions may in part explain the increased risk of mortality among COVID-19 patients.
Second, a need for optimization of COVID-19 survival and limited health resources by
employing focused vaccination for individuals with cardiovascular disease, CKD, and cancer.
A probable hypothesis of the pathophysiological mechanism related to the increased risk
of mortality among COVID-19 patients may be explained by the allostatic load imposed on the
body by cardiovascular and other preexisting conditions. Chronic conditions cause dysregulation
of major physiological systems, including the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, the
sympathetic nervous system, and the immune system.34 The chronic nature of such conditions
induces the ‘‘wear and tear’’ on the body’s regulatory systems,35 leading to the accumulation of
pro-inflammatory cytokines, which affects the cellular immune system. As a result of the
reduced immunity, these individuals become very susceptible to severe complications of SARSCoV-2 and death. However, such an association with this type of virus is not relatively new.
Seasonal influenza, SARS-CoV, and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, have
also been associated with increased severity and mortality in patients with preexisting
conditions.27,36
As the race towards acquiring a vaccination against COVID-19 intensifies, the question
remains as to which group of individuals should be prioritized for this vaccine. Our findings
suggest that those with preexisting cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and cancer may benefit
from vaccination to optimize both survival and limited resources. Targeted public health
vaccination intervention strategy for influenza vaccination is recommended by the Advisory
Committee on Immunization Practices against seasonal influenza.37 In the population with
chronic comorbidities, annual influenza vaccination significantly reduces mortality and

morbidity.38 Mounting evidence postulates that SARS-CoV-2 may become seasonal requiring
annual vaccination.
Lastly, although the specific mechanisms are uncertain, SARS- CoV-2 is thought to
infect host cells through ACE2 to cause COVID-19, while also causing damage to the
myocardium.39 Majority of patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease use renin-angiotensin
system (RAS) blockers, which are postulated to increase the risk of developing a severe and fatal
SARSCoV-2 infection.40 In animal studies, Ferrario and colleagues reported ACE inhibitors or
ARBs increased the levels of Ace2 mRNA compared with placebo.41 Particularly, cardiac levels
of Ace2 mRNA increased by 4.7-fold or 2.8-fold with either lisinopril (an ACE inhibitor) or
losartan (an ARB), respectively. However, whether or not patients with COVID-19 and preexisting cardiovascular disease who are taking an ACE inhibitor or ARB should switch to
another antihypertensive drug, remains controversial.7 Nevertheless, particular attention should
be given to cardiovascular protection during treatment for COVID-19.
Strengths and Limitations
As COVID-19 is still a relatively new phenomenon, there has been a limited number of
comprehensive and conclusive studies related to mortality in diverse populations. Therefore, data
from Africa and Australia were not included in this meta-analysis. We are hopeful that in the
future, further research will be published that explores the association between COVID-19
mortality and preexisting chronic conditions in these regions. In addition to this, we were unable
to explore the influence that cancer, HIV, and asthma may have on COVID-19 mortality. As
mentioned above, further research is necessary to conclusively determine if individuals with
these preexisting chronic conditions in these regions are at an increased risk for death from
COVID-19.

As previously mentioned, this meta-analysis employed a large number of studies, which
allowed for a relatively large sample size (n=61,455). By doing this, we were able to explore a
broad scope of chronic conditions, with over seven comorbidities included. This allows our
meta-analysis to comprehensively cover a multitude of prevalent conditions throughout
populations.
Conclusion
Our findings suggest that of the major comorbidities analyzed, coronary heart disease,
hypertension, CHF, and cancer carry the strongest risk of death from COVID-19. This research
highlights the importance of conducting further research related to the association between
preexisting chronic conditions and COVID-19 mortality, in order to explore potential
mechanisms to decrease this burden.
