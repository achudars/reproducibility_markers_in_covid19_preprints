Abstract: While people around the world are terrified of the global pandemic coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) and no registered vaccine is out yet, undertaking preventive safety
measures are said to be the only way to stay away from it. People’s adherence to these
measures is broadly dependent on their knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP). The
present study was designed to evaluate workers' knowledge, attitude, and practices from a
food industry in Dhaka, Bangladesh, towards COVID-19. A number of 155 respondents took
part in this online-based study. The information was acquired online from the participants
through a questionnaire prepared in Google form. With a correct response rate of about 90%
on average (knowledge 89.7%, attitude 93%, practices 88.2%), the participants showed a
good level of KAP regarding COVID-19. However, education and working experiences had a
significant association with the total KAP scores (p < 0.05). Further KAP studies in different
generic food industries in Bangladesh should be carried out to bring a more precise picture
for ensuring the level of workplace and worker’s safety.

1. Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is considered as one of the most widespread
pandemics since long. Because of its high transmission rate and unusual infection
characteristic, it has become a worldwide public health threat. After the first case being
diagnosed in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, the world health organization (WHO)
declared it a global health emergency. The causative pathogen was later named as a novel
coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which is also called as severe acute respiratory syndrome corona
virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) (Huang et al., 2020). Fever, fatigue, sore throat, prolonged dry cough,
headache, nasal blockage, diarrhea, etc. are the beginning symptoms of this disease that may
lead to several fatal complications like organ failure and severe pneumonia (Chen et al.,
2020).
As of July 15, 2020, there are more than 13 million confirmed cases in almost every country
and territory with a burden of nearly 575K deaths (WHO, 2020). This disease has already
made its deadly mark in Bangladesh since the first case spotted on March 08, 2020. There are
nearly 2 lac people affected by it, along with a number of the dead of more than two
thousand. In Bangladesh, the most confirmed cases of COVID-19 are in Dhaka, with almost
20% of total cases (IEDCR, 2020).
Bangladesh is still in a grave condition where thousands of people are getting affected every
day. The government of Bangladesh is doing its best to improve the situation and trying
implementing various measures to make the people aware of the situation. The general
holidays were taken up to May 31, 2020, for the sixth time (Jubayer et al., 2020). All
educational institutions are still remained closed, although online classes and lectures are
going on. The government offices are also functioning, maintaining all safety measures. The
economy of this country is mostly reliant on the processing and manufacturing sectors, and
most people make their living through daily income. Nevertheless, ‘working from home’ is
not a feasible option for food processing or any other manufacturing industry (Nicola et al.,
2020). Also, for avoiding the risk of food shortage, the highest priorities should be given on
supply chains to function appropriately (Galanakis, 2020). Some similar reasons drive the
industries running their operation during this situation. That is why it is necessary to ensure
good health and safety for workers providing high importance in maintaining physical
distance in manufacturing plants (Shahidi, 2020). According to the U.S. Department of
Homeland Security, a food processing industry is a critical infrastructure, where the workers
are needed to work in an enhanced safe environment (Dyal, 2020).
Along with food safety, the manufacturers should now encompass measures for the
prevention and control of coronavirus within their plant (SGS, 2020). The SARS-CoV-2 is
not a foodborne disease, as there is no evidence of transmission through any food product
(EFSA, 2020; Shahidi, 2020). Standard handling procedures for food is supposed to be
enough for the management of COVID-19 inside the factory, so long as personal distancing
and additional safety procedures are conformed (SGS, 2020). However, no respiratory virus
is transmitted via food. But, there is a chance of transmission if any infected person touches
the food, sneezes or coughs on it, and after that, another person makes contact with the same

food and touches his nose, eyes, or swallows it (Galanakis, 2020; Rizou et al., 2020).
Therefore, careful handling of foods and packaging materials, practicing proper personal
hygiene, especially washing and sanitizing hands extensively, should be ensured by the
management of every food manufacturing industry. The FDA has suggested cleaning and
sanitizing the food contact surface before production operation as precaution measures
(Seymour et al., 2020). So, it may be possible for the workers to be infected with the virus
through contact surfaces and surroundings when working.
For the successful prevention and control of this coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the people
must obey the control measures as suggested by the WHO (WHO, 2020). The success of
implementing preventive measures is mostly dependent on the knowledge, attitude, and
practices of an individual (Karim et al., 2020; Zhong et al., 2020; Ajilore et al., 2017).
Several studies revealed that the prevention of the previous SARS outbreak was associated
somewhat with the knowledge and attitude of people towards infectious diseases (Person et
al., 2004; Tao, 2003). However, in the current aspect of Bangladesh and food industries here,
there is no authentic study or reports regarding worker’s safety, food safety, and measures
taken during the time of this pandemic. Also, consumer health, worker’s health, and working
environment are of paramount concern. To enable and facilitate the management of the
COVID-19 within Bangladesh's food industries, we feel an urge to understand and evaluate
the worker’s awareness and knowledge towards the disease at this crucial moment. Hence,
the present study was conducted to investigate the COVID-19 related knowledge, attitude,
and practices (KAP) of workers from a food industry in Dhaka, Bangladesh. We hope this
study will help the higher management of Bangladeshi food industries develop further useful
strategies and may guide the researchers to conduct extensive KAP studies regarding
COVID-19 in different food industries.
2. Materials and methods
2.1 Study place and population
This study was conducted in a food manufacturing industry in Dhaka, Bangladesh, in the first
week of May 2020. Participants in this study were the general floor workers of the industry.
We selected people from the production, quality assurance (QA), store, maintenance, and
human resource management (HRM) departments to participate in this survey. During the
time of the study, 240 permanent workers were working in different departments. Among
them, 155 workers took part in this study. It is good to mention that this was a baking
industry. The production was running for 8 hours per day instead of 24 hours, maintaining all
possible safety measures.
2.2 Procedure
For avoiding close contact with the respondents, we decided to design a web-based
questionnaire. A structured questionnaire was prepared online (Google forms), and the link
was sent to the respondents through email and social media (WhatsApp and Facebook
messenger). Some recent studies were followed while preparing the questionnaire (Huynh et
al., 2020; Wadood et al., 2020; Olum et al., 2020). Section managers of different departments

provided us the email addresses, and the social media link of the workers agreed to
participate voluntarily. For convenience, both the Bengali and English version of the
questionnaire were prepared accordingly. A concise and straightforward completion guideline
was displayed at the beginning of the questionnaire. Also, the section managers were made
aware of that. It is good to mention that some workers did not have any smartphone,
computer, or internet access. For them, the relevant section managers collected the responses
through a print copy of the online questionnaire and completed it again accordingly online. In
the first part, respondents were required to fill information designed to gather demographic
data. The second part was on the knowledge, attitude, and practices regarding COVID-19.
The knowledge part was divided into two parts, namely, general COVID-19 knowledge (10
questions) and knowledge related to food safety (10 questions). The attitude and practices
part was comprised of 10 questions each. Questions from the KAP section were answered as
yes/no, agree/disagree, yes/no basis, respectively. A correct and desired response received
one point, and the wrong or undesired answer received zero points. For the determination of
adequate knowledge (>80%, score>16), positive attitude (>80%, score>8), as well as
desirable practices (>80%, score>8), Bloom’s cut-off point of 80% was utilized
(Kaliyaperumal, 2004).
2.3 Statistical analysis
Various tabular and statistical analyses have been used to conceptualize the whole scenario.
SPSS version 16.0 was used for statistical analysis. The primary analysis of data showed nonnormality in the sktest and Shapiro-Wilk test; hence we have used nonparametric alternative
tests, namely, Mann-Whitney U test, Wilcoxon W test, and Kruskal-Wallis H test. KAP
scores of respondents are presented as mean and standard deviation. Categorical variables are
computed as percentages. A linear regression model has been performed to determine
underlying factors that enhanced KAP scores. In the regression model, gender is a dummy
variable; age and experience are continuous variables, and the education and field of work
belong to categorical variables.
3. Results
3.1 Demographic characteristics
The demographic characteristics of participants are shown in Figure 1. The mean age of the
respondents was 32.9±8.5, with the majority being male. Most of them were aged between 30
to 40. Almost everyone (93.5%) had some level of education, among which the maximum
percentage (41.9%) was in the secondary education group. Rest had university and technical
education. The majority of respondents (46.4%) had experienced between 2 to 5 years, while
the least (10.3%) had working experience of more than ten years. There were several
operation departments in the industry. Most of the workers among the participants were from
production departments, followed by quality assurance (QA), maintenance, store, and human
resource management (HRM). It seemed that a noticeable amount of people (54.8%)
mentioned social media as a source of information about COVID-19, while no one was found
unaware of the situation.

Figure 1. Demographic characteristics of respondents.
3.2 Knowledge, attitude, and practices of respondents
Table 1 shows the knowledge of participants regarding COVID-19. About 89.7% of
respondents provided the correct answer with a score of 17.9 (SD=0.08). Questions about
general COVID-19 knowledge received 91.6% accurate response, while questions concerning
food safety received 87.9% correct answers. Workers had sufficient knowledge on most of
the issues. But when it comes to the survival and destruction condition of coronavirus, they
seemed to have some problems. Whether the virus can survive at freezing temperature, or can
UV kill it – got less than 80% correct responses. About two in ten workers failed to answer
comorbidity risk, zoonoses, and were not sure if there is any registered medication available
in the market.
The results related to the attitude are summarized in Table 2. With an excellent 9.3
(SD=0.04) score, more than 90% of people showed a positive attitude towards different
issues of COVID-19. More than a few of 10% of participants didn’t think that they could get
affected while working, while almost the same number of people were not interested in
training on COVID-19. Nearly 13% didn’t believe that washing hands for minimum of 20
seconds is necessary to be safe from the virus.
Like knowledge and attitude, the respondents' practices from the food industry also showed a
desirable outcome (Table 3). An average of about 88% of workers maintained commendable
and appropriate practices during the time of this pandemic situation. Though, some issues,
like staying away from a crowded place, not touching eyes, nose, and mouths during food
handling, avoiding frequent use of public transportation, were not practiced regularly by
nearly 20% of the workers.
Table 1. Knowledge of respondents regarding COVID-19.
Table 2. Attitude of respondents towards COVID-19.
Table 3. Practices of respondents during COVID-19.
Score on knowledge, attitude, and practices have been tested by different demographic
characteristics, i.e., gender, age group, education, experience, the field of work in current
company, and source of information on COVID-19 (Table 4). The null hypothesis of the
Mann‐Whitney U and the Wilcoxon test stipulates that each group's distribution was the
same. In the case of knowledge, all demographic characteristics showed significant
differences in central tendencies for each distribution. When it comes to attitude, all
demographic characteristics other than the job area showed significant differences. Education
was the only factor that showed a significant difference in the test for practices score.
Therefore, the demographic characteristics lead to varying the individual score while
education possesses significant results in all three KAP elements.

Other than the individual score on KAP elements, in the regression model, we have
determined underlying factors that enhanced the total KAP score. The R-square value
indicates the global check for the model that the model explains 81.2% of the variance in
total score on knowledge, attitude, and practices (Table 5). F value is very close to zero,
which indicates that the regression model is statistically significant and predicts the outcome
variable. In this regression model, education and experience significantly associate the
knowledge and practices of COVID-19 among the food industry workers. Age, gender, and
field of work have no significant association with the knowledge, attitude, and practices
towards COVID-19. Those attending primary school has 7.4 times more knowledge of
COVID-19 in comparison to those who did not attend school, and it is 6.9 higher among the
high school attending employee, 7.4 times more for those having a University degree, a
slightly lower with 6.7 times higher among the technical education holders in comparison to
the non-school going participants. Experience is also statistically significant at 5% level of
confidence, but unexpectedly the coefficient is negative in value, although very minimal.
That shows that those who are younger in the profession are more cautious or knowledgeable
about COVID-19 than the old employee.

4. Discussion
The global pandemic COVID-19 is driving people to undertake various precautionary
measures around the world, like refrain from usual social and economic activities, lock
themselves inside the house most of the time, gathering foods for upcoming days, etc.
(Foodware365, 2020). In Bangladesh, strict protocols are not followed by the people,
especially in the capital Dhaka, a megacity. From the perspective of Bangladesh, a densely
populated and lower-middle-income country, social distancing is visibly impossible. People
instead work outside in this dangerous situation than starving (Anwar et al., 2020). Food and
beverage industries worldwide are likely to experience variable impacts of COVID-19 on
different stages of its value and supply chain (Manepalli & Nagvenkar, 2020). The food
industries of Bangladesh are no exception. There are problems in the supply of raw materials
and daily labor, consumer demands, and transportation. The workers and corporate level are
at a high risk of infection that can potentially impact the production and manufacturing of
food products. Right now, primary concern for the food industry is to provide all support to
keep their employees healthy and available (Foodware365). Food handlers are usually
exposed to various biological materials (Peng et al., 2020). Moreover, the coronavirus can
persist in the food industry's regular handling surface, e.g., metal, plastic, and glass, for a
couple of days (Kampf et al., 2020). Therefore the workers need to have knowledge of proper
safety rules and bear attitude for practicing those to stay safe from spreading COVID-19.
To the best of our knowledge, this current study is the first that evaluates the KAPs of food
handlers of a food industry towards the pandemic COVID-19. However, since the outbreak,
we found some studies regarding KAPs and COVID-19 conducted with healthcare workers

and physicians (Huynh et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020; Saqlain et al., 2020; Olum et al.,
2020; Khader et al., 2020; Ahmed et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020; Nepal et al., 2020), students
(Aynalem et al., 2020; Taghrir et al., 2020; Wadood et al., 2020), and general people
(Abdelhafiz et al., 2020; Azlan et al., 2020; Zhong et al., 2020; Karim et al., 2020; Roy et al.,
2020).
In the present study, the respondents from the food industry had sufficient knowledge
regarding COVID-19. Almost 90% of them provided a correct response in different questions
asked on COVID-19. The knowledge section was divided into two parts, namely, general and
food safety, that was responded correctly by 91.6% and 87.9% of participants, respectively.
Similar kind of performances where more than 80% respondents have accurate knowledge on
COVID-19 can be found in some recent studies by Saqlain et al., 2020 (93.2%), Zhong et al.,
2020 (90%), Shi et al., 2020 (89.5%), Zhang et al., 2020 (89%), Taghrir et al., 2020 (86.9%),
Nepal et al., 2020 (82.2%), Olum et al., 2020 (82.4%). We have come to know from the
management that they arranged specialized COVID-19 training weekly since the first case
been diagnosed in Bangladesh. Section managers and executives conducted those training. In
addition, the industry has different food safety certifications like ISO, HACCP, etc., and for
this purpose, they need to arrange food safety training for all of their employees at regular
intervals. This may be one of the reasons for their performances in food safety knowledge.
Although it is not possible to compare the outcomes with any study on Food industry and
COVID-19, we found that the food safety knowledge level of food handlers from food
different food industries was satisfactory (Adesokan and Raji, 2014; Jianu and Goleţ, 2014;
Ansari-Lari et al., 2010).
The respondents seemed to have well acknowledged about the necessary information on
COVID-19. The causative organism, symptoms, severity, and consequences of the infection,
how it spreads – are usually known to almost 9 in every ten people. Comparatively, few
people were aware of whether this disease can transmit from pet animal to human and if there
is any registered treatment option or medicine available in the market. Due to the spreading
of panic and fake news in this pandemic time, many owners and people fear that pets might
transmit the disease to them. There is no significant proof of substantial threat from pets or
animals (Parry, 2020). More than 10% of them were not sure that diseases like diabetes,
CVD, and asthma could be deadly in this situation. Usually, participants with no education
appeared to have very poor knowledge of this issue. People who acquire information about
COVID-19 from their friends and family are also a bit unaware of this matter. Some workers
do not have education, solvency, and have no access to the internet and smartphones. They
mostly depend on other people for any information on COVID-19. As a result, several
essential information remained unknown to them.
When we tried to ask them questions regarding the COVID-19 issue and food safety, correct
response percentages (87.9%) were lower than the general part (91.6%). More than 25%
failed to answer the question regarding the survival of SARS-CoV-2 in freezing
temperatures. According to the WHO, this organism can survive at −20 °C for nearly two
years, and transmission via frozen food can be possible (WHO, 2020). A study by Mannan
and Mannan, 2020 found that among people from different occupations in Bangladesh, there

is a significant knowledge gap about the incubation and transmission characteristics of this
virus. When it comes to relating the freezing temperature and microorganisms, several studies
demonstrated a low level of food handler’s knowledge regarding this (Al-Kandari et al.,
2019; Akabanda et al., 2017; Galgamuwa et al., 2016; Ansari-Lari et al., 2010; Baş et al.,
2006). But the level of performance and knowledge level on related topic of the respondents
in current study is undoubtedly better than these studies.
Usually, for the inactivation of viruses, a typical cooking temperature of more than 70°C is
sufficient (für Risikobewertung, 2020). The workers knew that cooking and heating is enough
for the product to make it safe from pathogens. Besides, almost everyone (97.4%) agreed that
alcohol-based disinfectants could be effective against SARS-CoV-2. The SARS-CoV-2
cannot spread through drinking water. Commonly used treatment methods are competent
enough to make the water safe (CDC, 2020b), and it was known to almost all workers. In a
baking industry, cooking or baking temperature is a significant concern. Besides, cleaning of
processing surfaces and conveyors with disinfectants is an everyday job for the floor workers.
Therefore, dealing with the questions on thermal processing and basic hygiene became easy
for them. This current industry has HACCP and ISO certification. They arrange several
training sessions for the workers at regular intervals, as training is a requirement for any food
industry to get the certification and renew the certification (Mortimore and Wallace, 2013).
The training focusing COVID-19 during the outbreak also added value to their previous
knowledge. Whether the virus can survive at freezing temperature or, can the ultraviolet rays
destroy it – is unknown to many respondents. But, a fair amount of workers answered
correctly in question regarding the effect of pasteurization on the coronavirus.
From the present study, we found that majority of respondents had a desirably positive
attitude towards the COVID-19 issue. Except three of them, all said that they remained
worried about their family members during this outbreak. In Dhaka city, most people
working in different processing and manufacturing industries are from outside the city and
leave their families in their hometown or village (BBS, 2017). Furthermore, due to
transportation lockdown, it was hard for them to visit their family. Why the three participants
declared of not being worried about family is hard to explain. About 10 percent thought that
the industry should run its operation in the time of COVID-19, and they will not get infected
while working in the factory. Besides, about 7% of them wanted to come to work although
they fell ill, and 8% of the workers did not want to let the management know about their
sickness. Although not many in numbers, these few peoples can cause a threat to other
healthy people during the time of work if they are infected with the coronavirus. In a country
like Bangladesh, workers' socioeconomic conditions and challenges may drive them to work
while feeling sick. During the lockdown, a significant number of people have lost their jobs
in Bangladesh due to the closure of industries. Many industries cut salaries while some were
unable to pay the incentives before the Eid-ul-Fitr (Amnesty International, 2020; Babu and
Siddiqui, 2020). More than 10% of participants did not agree on washing hands for at least 20
seconds. Perhaps, they thought maintaining a particular time was not necessary. Respondents
from the no education group and those who said to collect information from family and
friends were mostly disagreed on this issue.

Most of the respondents (95% on average) reported washing and sanitizing hands more often,
avoiding shaking hands and touching foods while working in a line, and altering masks after
coughing and sneezing. This indicates the frequent changes and awareness of workers for
preventing the COVID-19. The effectiveness of general training provided by the management
after the outbreak is visible through these behaviors. Surprisingly, 7 in 10 participants said
they usually made contact with eyes, mouth, and nose while handling food products in the
production line. It is essential to know the appropriate use of gloves and masks in the food
industry while handling the products (WHO, 2020b). This kind of unexpected behavior of not
washing or sanitizing hands and touching face, nose, and eyes after coughing or sneezing can
also be seen in a study by Prabhusaran et al., 2018. We want to say that the participants know
the risks of touching the face during this time, but such strict practices may take some more
time. Also, there is a chance of considering thyself less likely to the transmission, which may
be stated as ‘optimistic bias’ (da Cunha et al., 2014).
A remarkable number of people (25.2%) found to go outside more than once in the last seven
days, and about 13% of total respondents were not used to wear masks outside the factory.
Moreover, some of them use public transport regularly. This kind of practice could lead a
person to transmit more often, which would make all other employees prone to infection
within a week or two. This kind of occurrence can force the business to close immediately
(SGS, 2020). In a similar study on some university students in Bangladesh, it seemed that a
remarkable number were not interested in using face masks, avoiding public places, and
transports (Wadood et al., 2020). In another study from Bangladesh (Haque et al., 2020), it
was observed that nearly 30% of the participants frequently go outside and meet their friends.
On the contrary, many improved practices in avoiding crowds can be seen in different study
groups from Malaysia (Azlan et al., 2020), China (Zhong et al., 2020), and Iran (Taghrir et
al., 2020).
According to the study, the total KAP scores were not affected by gender, age, and working
sections, although there were differences in the knowledge scores. We found that the males,
workers of 20 to 30 years old, and those working in the production departments significantly
have higher knowledge scores. When, in most of the recent KAP studies (Abdelhafiz et al.,
2020; Olum et al., 2020; Azlan et al., 2020; Nemati et al., 2020; Zhong et al., 2020; Peng et
al., 2020) female participants showed higher scores than male participants. In different
studies, people of different age limits showed different outcomes in knowledge scores. This is
hard to compare these results with the food industry people as they have separate working
environments. For example, in a study by Huynh et al., 2020 and Azlan et al., 2020,
respondents above 40 and 50 years old, respectively, had superior knowledge compared to
other age groups. While Abdelhafiz et al., 2020 said that, in his study, respondents aged
between 18-30 performed better in COVID-19 knowledge questions.
The exciting thing is that the respondents with less experience are superior in their total KAP
scores. The coefficient is negative in value in case of total working experience (Table 5).
Therefore, the younger workers have good knowledge of COVID-19, and they are positive in
their attitude and approach to this pandemic than the elderly participants. It is a novel virus,
and the young have more access to the internet and other information due to being

technologically sound. A similar kind of result was observed by Huynh et al., 2020.
Contradictory results can also be seen in a study by Nemati et al., 2020, where participants
with more experiences had a higher level of knowledge. Education showed to have a
significant role in the KAP scores of the participants. Those who have completed graduation
are superior in KAP. This finding is in line with the studies of Abdelhafiz et al., 2020; Olum
et al., 2020; Zhong et al., 2020.
In the current study, most workers reported different social media as their sources of
information on COVID-19. A fair number of people referred to television and newspapers for
the latest update, followed by those who depend on websites, family members, and friends.
Those who kept themselves updated through social media had significantly better knowledge
than others. However, social media followers lagged behind the TV and newspaper readers in
showing a positive attitude. Age difference and education level may be considered as an
essential factor for choosing different media as a source for information during this time
(Olum et al., 2020).
5. Limitations
COVID-19 is a novel virus that has been identified just before the onset of 2020. We faced
difficulties in interpreting the results as there is no single KAP study in the food industry. As
it was an online-based study and self-reported data were used, there is a possibility of
biasness from the respondents. People from the supply chain department could be included in
this study. The supply chain department plays a significant role in raw materials safety. Due
to some limitations, we failed to arrange people from there. It would be more fruitful if we
could observe the changes in their KAP over time. Also, including more food industry would
help to generalize the findings.
Conclusion
In conclusion, according to the study, respondents from the food industry had adequate
knowledge, a positive attitude, and desired practices regarding the COVID-19 issue.
Whenever in some specific KAP questions, we found some unfavorable and undesired
responses that may be proved dangerous in this situation. The definite limitations suggest
more extensive and in-depth research in the aspect of Bangladeshi food industries.
Acknowledgement
We especially thank the section managers for their cordial help. We also would like to
appreciate the workers for their voluntary participation in this study.
Declaration of competing interest
There has been no funding and financial support for this study and we declare that we have
no conflict of interest.
