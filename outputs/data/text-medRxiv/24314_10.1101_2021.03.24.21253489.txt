ABSTRACT
Objectives To examine factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine receipt among healthcare
workers, including healthcare worker job type, race, and gender, as well as the role of vaccine
confidence in decisions to vaccinate, and to better understand specific concerns related to
COVID-19 vaccination among healthcare workers.
Design Cross-sectional anonymous survey among front-line, support service, and
administrative healthcare workers.
Setting Two large integrated healthcare systems (one private and one public) in New York City
during the initial rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine among healthcare workers.
Participants 1,933 healthcare workers, including nurses, physicians, allied health
professionals, environmental services staff, researchers, and administrative staff.
Main Outcome Measures The primary outcome was COVID-19 vaccine receipt during the
initial rollout of the vaccine among healthcare workers.
Results Among 1,933 healthcare workers who had been offered the vaccine, 81% had received
the vaccine at the time of the survey. Receipt was lower among Black (58%) compared with
White (91%) healthcare workers; and lower among Hispanic (69%) compared with non-Hispanic
(84%) healthcare workers. Among healthcare workers with concerns about COVID-19 vaccine
safety, 65% received the vaccine. Among healthcare workers who agreed with the statement
that the vaccine is important to protect family members, 86% were vaccinated. Of those who
disagreed, 25% received the vaccine. Across all participants, 27% expressed concern about
being experimented on with the COVID-19 vaccine. In a multivariable analysis, concern about
being experimented on with the COVID-19 vaccine, concerns about COVID-19 vaccine safety,
lack of influenza vaccine receipt, disagreeing that COVID-19 vaccination is important to protect
family members, and Black race were independently associated with COVID-19 vaccine nonreceipt. Over 70% of all healthcare workers responded that they had been approached for
vaccine advice multiple times by family, community members, and patients.
Conclusions Our data demonstrated high overall receipt among healthcare workers. Even
among healthcare workers with concerns about COVID-19 vaccine safety, side effects, or being
experimented on, over 50% received the vaccine. Attitudes around the importance of COVID-19
vaccination to protect others played a large role in healthcare workers’ decisions to vaccinate.
We observed striking inequities in COVID-19 vaccine receipt, particularly affecting Black and
Hispanic workers. Further research is urgently needed in developing strategies with healthcare
workers to address issues related to vaccine equity and uptake in the context of systemic
racism and barriers to care. This is particularly important given the influence healthcare workers
have in vaccine decision-making conversations in their communities.

SUMMARY BOXES
What is already known?
•

High uptake of effective COVID-19 vaccines among healthcare workers is critical to
pandemic response.

•

In studies of potential COVID-19 vaccine acceptance prior to COVID-19 vaccine
availability, people who identified as Black were less likely to indicate they would accept
the vaccine.

•

Understanding reasons why some healthcare workers chose not to get the COVID-19
vaccine will help us develop interventions to improve COVID-19 vaccine confidence
among healthcare workers and in their communities.

What this study adds
•

We demonstrate high receipt of COVID-19 vaccines in the initial rollout among
healthcare workers.

•

Attitudes around the importance of COVID-19 vaccination to protect others played a
large role in healthcare workers’ decisions to vaccinate.

•

We observed substantially lower rates of receipt among Black and Hispanic healthcare
workers, independent of differences in vaccine-related beliefs. A quarter of healthcare
workers expressed concerns about being experimented on. These results suggest
systemic racism may be a critical barrier to equitable vaccination.

•

Our results highlight that healthcare workers of all types, including those with nonpatient-facing roles, play an important role as sources of COVID-19 vaccine information
in their communities.

Introduction
The equitable and widespread uptake of effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 will be
critical to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Approval of the first COVID-19 vaccines in the United
States was preceded by months of intense public and political discourse on potential vaccine
efficacy and safety. Throughout 2020, estimates of COVID-19 vaccination intent in the general
adult population ranged from less than half to approximately three-quarters, and pointed to an
urgent need to address vaccine confidence.1 Members of groups affected by systemic racism
suffered disproportionate morbidity and mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic.2-7 These
groups, in particular Blacks, have long suffered gross abuses and injustices in healthcare. Partly
as a result, members of marginalized groups have expressed lower intent to receive COVID-19
vaccines.2,8,9
In December 2020, the first COVID-19 vaccines were authorized for emergency use in
the United States and healthcare workers were among the first groups to be offered the
vaccines.10 Recent working papers have highlighted the need to effectively engage local
communities in COVID-19 vaccination11 and to equitably distribute the vaccines.12
Globally, local healthcare workers are some of the most trusted and influential
professionals in individual and family decisions around vaccination.13,14 Beyond their work roles,
healthcare workers are also influential members of the communities in which they live. Vaccine
hesitancy is prevalent among healthcare workers globally.15 The World Health Organization
(WHO) emphasizes that targeted discussions and engagement with healthcare providers will be
essential to obtaining widespread vaccination confidence, as they will be the first ones expected
to get the vaccine, and they will be on the frontlines facing questions from the public.16
Our group at the COVID-19 Unit for Research at Elmhurst (CURE-19) partnership
between NYC Health & Hospital Corporation’s Elmhurst and Queens Hospital Centers and the
Arnhold Institute for Global Health at Mount Sinai, recognized that the COVID-19 pandemic and
vaccine confidence are going to be long-standing public health issues over the coming decade.
The healthcare systems that our partnership represent cover over 7 million patient visits
annually and 80,000 healthcare workers in neighborhoods with some of the highest linguistic,
cultural, and ethnic diversity in the United States. Here, we aimed to examine the demographic,
work role, and vaccine-related belief factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine receipt among
healthcare workers during the initial rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine in this highly diverse region
that has been heavily impacted by the pandemic.

Methods
Setting
We conducted an online cross-sectional survey of healthcare workers at two large
integrated healthcare systems (one public and one private) in New York City. COVID-19
vaccines were available in New York City beginning December 14, 2020. Based on New York
State guidelines, healthcare workers at high risk for exposure were in the first COVID-19
vaccine eligibility category. Vaccine eligibility expanded throughout our data collection time
period.
For participant eligibility, we defined healthcare worker broadly to include physicians,
nurses, allied health professionals, advanced practice providers, environmental services
workers, community-based providers, and researchers/educators. We recruited participants
through use of hospital listservs, newsletters, and emails, and through distributing posters and
flyers onsite at locations across the health systems. The survey was available in English,
Spanish, Bangla, Mandarin, Nepali, and Haitian Creole. An incentive for a chance to win one of
ten $50 cash prizes was offered to the survey participants. The survey was available
electronically via REDCap and by paper upon request.
The online form included exclusively forced choice questions, except for two open ended
questions with free text answers included at the end of the survey. As such there were no
missing data. We also piloted paper surveys, which were completed by nine participants. We
did not include them in the primary analysis, as the data were incomplete or clearly inaccurate.
Data collection ran from December 23, 2020, to February 16, 2021, corresponding to the
first two months of COVID-19 vaccine rollout.

Main Measures
We asked respondents if they had been offered a COVID-19 vaccine by the time of the
survey. For those who had been offered a vaccine, we asked whether they had received the
vaccine, not received the vaccine, or “planned to get it but had not scheduled or gone for the
vaccine yet”. For participants who had not been offered the vaccine, we asked them if when a
vaccine was offered to them, they intended to “get one as soon as possible”, “delay getting it for
a few months”, or “never get one”.
To measure general vaccine confidence, we used the Vaccine Confidence Index (VCI),
which was developed and validated by The Vaccine Confidence Project to measure “individual
perceptions on the safety, importance, effectiveness, and religious compatibility of vaccines”.1719

The three statements are: “Overall, I think vaccines are safe”, “I think vaccines are important

for children to have”, and “Overall, I think vaccines are effective”. For computing the Vaccine
Confidence Index as a numerical score, we assigned numerical values to responses to each of

the three questions (strongly agree = 5, somewhat agree = 4, neither agree nor disagree = 3,
somewhat disagree = 2, strongly disagree = 1). While there is, as yet, no standardized way of
categorizing responses, we used existing literature20 and visual inspection of the data to assign
VCI scores less than 9 as low vaccine confidence.
We further adapted the VCI questions to explore COVID-19 specific disease risk
appraisal, vaccine benefits, and vaccine harms (see Supplementary Materials). We also asked
about influenza vaccine receipt in the current 2020-2021 influenza season, and about social
media exposures.
We included questions on trusted sources for COVID-19 vaccine advice, information
seeking behavior, and how often coworkers, friends and family members asked for respondents'
opinions on COVID-19 vaccination. To better understand specific concerns related to COVID-19
vaccination, we included two optional open-ended questions at the end of the survey inviting
participants to share their thoughts and suggestions and inquiring about what tools and
resources would help them provide information about COVID-19 with more confidence. We
collected demographic and occupational variables including race, ethnicity, age, gender, job role
and involvement in direct patient care

Quantitative Analytical Methods
We report COVID-19 vaccine receipt by demographic and occupational factors, general
vaccine confidence, influenza vaccine receipt and COVID-19 vaccine attitudes. We expressed
results in the form of means, proportions, and 95% confidence intervals. We conducted bivariate
analyses using Chi-squared tests for categorical variables and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for the
continuous variable Vaccine Confidence Index, with significance set at α=0.05. For this analysis
focused specifically on vaccine receipt (rather than intent) as the primary outcome, respondents
who had not yet received the vaccine but planned to get it were included in the “no” category.
We developed a multivariable logistic regression model to assess the adjusted and
relative contributions of demographic variables and vaccine confidence on COVID-19 vaccine
receipt when offered. For the logistic regression model, we utilized the Lasso procedure,21 in R
Studio, Version 1.4.1103, which uses regularization, cross-validation and penalization to identify
important predictor variables and improve the interpretability and predictive accuracy of the final
statistical model. We used 50% of the dataset for training and 50% for testing. Independent
variables inputted into the model included demographic variables, occupational variables, and
workers’ perceptions of COVID-19 vaccine benefits, harms, and disease risk. In a
supplementary table, we report which variables were retained (had positive coefficient weights),
not retained (had zero weight), and their coefficients (transformed into an odds ratio) in the final

adjusted model. For generating odds ratios and confidence intervals in the final model, we
utilized the glm procedure in R.

Qualitative Analytical Methods
We analyzed the free-text survey response data through summary descriptive statistics.
Review of survey response transcripts allowed for preliminary thematic analysis to formulate
detailed narratives. Open coding of survey transcripts was completed by two team members
(AC, LS), which led to an initial set of codes, which were refined by a third member (RM).
These were organized according to themes that emerged from the data and by the research
premise and conceptual model. We generated a codebook of code definitions and examples.
We completed coding of all transcripts completed by two team members, using Dedoose
software (SocioCultural Research Consultants, LLC, Manhattan Beach, California, USA). We
formulated the final set of overarching themes in discussion with the full study team as a direct
assessment of the healthcare workers’ free-text survey responses. An additional reviewer (AH)
assessed each statement for theme content and established frequency tables of theme content
by demographic variables. Illustrative quotes pertaining to commonly reported themes were
extracted from the data and documented.

Patient and Public Involvement
Patients or the public were not involved in the design, or conduct, or reporting, or dissemination
plans of our research.

Ethical approval
Our study was determined to be exempt by the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai
Institutional Review Board (study#20-01964).

Results
Study Population
Between December 23, 2020, and February 16, 2021, 2,191 healthcare workers
attempted, and 2,109 (96%) completed the survey. Among participants who completed the
survey, 1,933 (92%) had been offered the COVID-19 vaccine at the time of survey completion.
We restricted our analysis to the group who had been offered the vaccine. Respondents were
predominantly cisgender female (70%), with a median age range of 40-49 years. By profession,
23% were allied health professionals, 21% worked in administration/management, 22% in
education or research, 14% were nurses, and 14% were physicians. By ethnicity, 16% of the

respondents were Hispanic of any race. Among racial categories, 10% were Black, 23% Asian
or Pacific Islander, and 45% White.

Vaccination Receipt Rate
Of respondents who were offered the vaccine, 81% reported they had received a
COVID-19 vaccine, 11% reported they plan to get it but had not scheduled or gone for the
vaccine yet, and 8% had not received the vaccine. Table 1 presents the bivariable analysis of
vaccine receipt by gender, age, race and ethnicity, HCW role, and participation in direct patient
care. COVID-19 vaccine receipt was highest among males, respondents aged less than 40
years and 60 years or greater, and White respondents. By role, physicians (95%),
researchers/educators (92%), and advanced practice providers (92%) were the most likely to be
vaccinated, while community-based health workers were the least likely to have received the
vaccine (29%). There was no difference in vaccine receipt by workers’ involvement in direct
patient care. Among healthcare workers who reported receiving an influenza vaccine, 84% also
received the COVID-19 vaccine compared to 44% of healthcare workers who did not receive a
seasonal flu vaccine (p < 0.001).

Table 1. Participant Characteristics by Receipt of COVID-19 vaccine when offered
Perception of COVID-19 Vaccine Benefits
Healthcare workers who agreed with statements about the COVID-19 vaccine’s
importance in protecting family members were more likely to receive the vaccine compared to
those who did not agree with this statement (86% compared to 25%, p <0.001). This
relationship was consistent across workers with different beliefs in the vaccine’s importance in
protecting community members, co-workers, and patients. Table 2 presents bivariable analysis
of vaccine receipt by vaccine beliefs and risk appraisal.

Perception of COVID-19 Vaccine Risks
Regarding potential COVID-19 vaccine risks, 27% of respondents expressed concern
about being experimented on, 40% expressed concern about vaccine safety, and 48%
expressed concern about side effects. Among respondents who expressed concern about
safety, 64% received the vaccine, as did 70% with concerns about side effects, compared to
92% of respondents who did not express those concerns (p < 0.001). Similarly, respondents
who expressed concern about being experimented on were less likely to have received the
vaccine compared to those who did not (57% compared to 90%, p < 0.001). Figure 2 presents
the percent of respondents who strongly or somewhat agreed with the statement “I am worried
about being experimented on”, by race and ethnicity and healthcare worker role. Among all
participants, 94% of respondents agreed that “overall, vaccines are safe” and 93% received the
influenza vaccine during the most recent flu season (2020-2021).

COVID-19 Disease Risk Appraisal
Across all participants, 80% believed they were at high risk of getting COVID-19 due to
their job. Healthcare workers who felt they were at high risk due to their job were more likely to
have received the vaccine (83% compared to 75%, p < 0.001). Among those who disagreed
that their job put them at high risk, 69% still reported vaccine receipt. Being at high risk for

COVID-19 complications due to underlying health conditions did not affect vaccine uptake (79%
compared to 82%, p=0.07). Healthcare workers who responded that they did not need the
vaccine because they had a history of COVID-19 disease or had positive antibodies
represented 6% of total participants but made up 21% of participants who did not receive the
vaccine.

Multivariable Analysis
The final multivariable model is shown in Figure 1 (See Supplementary Table 1 for
LASSO coefficients). Identifying as Black was associated with a decreased vaccine receipt
(odds ratio 0.38, 95% confidence interval 0.24 to 0.59). Concerns about vaccine safety and
being experimented on continued to predict lower vaccine receipt (odds ratio 0.39, 95%CI 0.280.55 and odds ratio 0.44, 95%CI 0.31 to 0.60). Beliefs in the importance of the vaccine
protecting others remained associated with higher vaccine receipt (odds ratio 2.69, 95%CI 1.933.74). By occupational category, a role in nursing (OR 0.37, 95%CI 0.21-0.65), administration
(OR 0.46, 95%CI 0.26-0.78), or allied and other health professionals (OR 0.48, 95%CI 0.270.81) remained significant for decreased odds of vaccine receipt compared to physicians and
advanced practice providers. Influenza vaccine receipt (odds ratio 3.57, 95%CI 2.30 to 5.56)
was also associated with a higher odds of COVID-19 vaccine uptake. Higher general vaccine
confidence measured by the Vaccine Confidence Index (OR 1.06, 0.99-1.14, p=0.076) was not
significant in the final multivariable model.

Trusted sources of COVID-19 vaccine information and social media patterns
Healthcare workers reported they were asked their opinion about COVID-19 vaccination
multiple times in the past month by coworkers (73%), family members (86%), and community
members or friends (73%). When asked “who do you trust MOST to give you advice on COVID19 vaccines?”, 39% of healthcare workers chose “my primary care doctor”, followed by “federal
government agencies” (28%) and “other healthcare professionals” (12%). Among healthcare
workers who did not get the COVID-19 vaccine by the time of survey completion, the most
trusted source was also their primary care doctor, followed by federal government agencies.

Qualitative results
Overall, 641 respondents provided free text answers to the open-ended questions at the
end of the structured survey. Of these respondents, 459 (72%) were female, 142 (22%) were
male and 40 (6%) were Queer/Non-Binary, Transgender FTM, other gender, or preferred not to
identify their gender. We summarize qualitative results of the free-text responses in
Supplementary Table 2. The primary themes were: 1) Positive regard for the COVID-19

vaccine; 2) Mistrust in public health institutions and government; 3) Specific concerns about
COVID-19 vaccines; 4) Identification of vaccine related-education needs; and 5) Suggestions for
mass vaccination and distribution.
The first of the primary themes identified healthcare workers’ overall positive valence
towards the COVID-19 vaccine and expressing keenly wanting to receive it. Participants’
statements of ‘positive regard’ indicated gratitude, interest in sharing positive thoughts with
others, and a hope that everyone will receive the vaccine as soon as possible. The theme of
general mistrust in public health institutions and government around the COVID-19 pandemic
overall, and in various considerations related to the vaccine, also emerged. The theme of
mistrust was identified in only 8% of statements. However, statements aligning with the theme
of mistrust in the vaccine were more frequently cited among healthcare workers who identified
as Black, and Black healthcare workers provided reasons for hesitancy more frequently than
other racial/ethnic groups. The proportion of themes expressed by healthcare workers by race
and ethnicity are shown in Supplementary Table 3. Reasons for hesitancy included uncertainty
about long term side effects, needing more time to “wait and see” what happens when others
take the vaccine. Participants highlighted the historical medical experimentation on minority
groups, political involvement in the COVID-19 pandemic response overall and in the
development and distribution of the vaccine. For the theme ‘Specific concerns about COVID-19
vaccines’ participants described a range of reasons for their concerns in obtaining the vaccine.
Common specific concerns expressed included side effects, uncertainty around the need for
vaccine if previously infected, reproductive health considerations, and a concern that the
vaccine was developed too quickly. This theme was also represented by desires to be
vaccinated after more data and experience with the vaccine became available. Participants
‘suggestions for mass vaccination and distribution’ included logistical improvements for vaccine
sites, transparency in distribution, providing incentives for vaccination, and ideas regarding the
order of eligibility.
In response to the prompt for suggested tools and resources participants had a variety of
suggestions for what is needed regarding vaccine education and confidence promotion. The
identification of educational needs was the most frequently endorsed theme. Fifty percent of
healthcare workers who provided a free text response identified a need for more information
pertaining to the COVID-19 vaccine. Participants suggested efforts related to methods of
communication and identified trusted sources for dissemination of information. Statements
reflected a need for infographic materials to explain how the vaccines work. Healthcare workers
indicated a need to explain how the vaccines work, in particular the mRNA vaccines. Healthcare
workers stated their continued interest in receiving updates of COVID-19 vaccination

information via easy to access academic journals and webinars. Many healthcare workers
expressed an interest in greater use of health information technology to disseminate COVID-19
vaccination information about side effects, efficacy, and distribution.

Discussion
We found that while COVID-19 vaccine uptake among healthcare workers in our study is
the norm—81% of respondents received the vaccine—there were important inequities in
vaccine receipt by race, gender, age, and healthcare worker role. Black, Hispanic and female
participants were less likely to have received the vaccine, while physicians, advanced practice
providers, and researchers/educators were more likely to have received the vaccine. Our study,
occurring in the immediate two-month period following vaccine rollout among healthcare
workers, is one of the first studies to report COVID-19 vaccine receipt rather than intent, and the
first to investigate the association of COVID-19 vaccine receipt with vaccine confidence and
perceptions of vaccine risks and benefits among healthcare workers.
Our results on race support findings from earlier research that examined COVID-19
vaccine intent prior to vaccine availability22-28. Similarly, many published studies have found men
were more willing to accept a potential COVID-19 vaccine than women1,23,25 though one found
the opposite.29 Consistent with early reports of COVID-19 vaccination rates in the United States,
we found Black and Hispanic participants were less likely to receive the COVID-19 vaccine at
the time of our survey. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that among
persons who received the vaccine, the proportion who identified as Black was lower than would
be expected based on eligibility.30 Similarly, in New York City at the time of our study, Black
New Yorkers made up 12% of vaccine recipients, but 24% of the population.31 Both reports
were limited by incomplete data collection for race and ethnicity, but in our sample 94% of
respondents reported race/ethnicity data.
We found higher perceived benefits of COVID-19 vaccination for protecting others had
the largest effect size in predicting vaccine receipt. Lower perceived vaccine harms including
safety and being experimented on also predicted vaccine receipt. Higher perceived benefits of
COVID-19 vaccination, higher perceived risk of COVID-19 disease, and more positive attitudes
towards vaccination have been associated with greater intent to vaccinate in the general US
population.1,23,25 We found no difference in vaccine uptake based on whether respondents had
patient-facing roles. This may be explained by healthcare workers’ confidence in the protection
provided by personal protective equipment (e.g., masks, face shields) or that healthcare
workers have high perceived COVID-19 risk regardless of direct patient interaction. We do not
have more refined data, however, as to whether site of patient care – e.g., in home or
community settings versus in clinic or hospital facilities – might moderate perceived risk.

A prior study investigating COVID-19 beliefs, vaccine intent, and race found that beliefs
mediate the association of race and vaccine intent.32 While Black respondents in their study had
lower vaccine intent and lower pro-vaccine beliefs, race was not significant when controlling for
pro-vaccine beliefs. Here, Black healthcare workers had lower COVID-19 vaccination rates even
after accounting for safety concerns and pro-vaccine beliefs in the multivariable model. Vaccine
intent does not always translate to vaccine receipt33 and this effect may be greater among Black
healthcare workers. The effects of systemic racism, the history of research abuses among
people of color in the United States, and the lived experience of mistreatment in healthcare
systems likely all contribute to lower vaccination rates.22,34,35 Increasing access to evidencebased information and implementing various forms of reflective listening with marginalized
communities who are less likely to take the vaccine may decrease mistrust among healthcare
workers critical to achieving a more equitable vaccine response. Additionally, while all
healthcare workers in this study had been offered the vaccine in their workplaces, there may
have been racial differences in actual access (e.g., ability to take time off duty to wait for the
vaccine) that our study was not designed to detect.
A strong physician recommendation in favor of vaccination has been shown to positively
influence vaccine decision making for many immunizations, and COVID-19 appears no
different.36,37 In our study, healthcare workers reported their primary care doctor was the most
trusted source for advice on COVID-19 vaccination and this held true across race and vaccine
receipt. Our findings also point to the influence that all healthcare workers can have in
discussing COVID-19 vaccination within social networks of co-workers, family and community
members. Further research is needed in developing strategies for healthcare workers to listen
to, respond, and address issues related to vaccine equity and uptake in the context of systemic
racism and barriers to care.

Limitations
The high rate of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in our population may be the result of
response bias, where healthcare workers with favorable vaccine attitudes were more likely to
complete the survey. Our study may have some limits in generalizability given the setting in
New York City and a substantial representation from an academic health system. Additionally,
Black and Hispanic respondents were underrepresented in our survey, comprising 10% and
16% of our survey population respectively, whereas approximately 20% of the healthcare
workers in our systems’ hospitals identify as Black and 18% identify as Hispanic.
We chose explicitly to use receipt as the primary outcome, rather than intent. As such,
participants who indicated they “planned” to receive the vaccine were categorized for the
primary outcome along with those who stated that they did not plan to. We did review the

differences between these two groups and assessed differences over time (see Supplementary
Figure 5). Those who stated an intent may have had perceptual or belief reasons for delaying,
as several participants expressed in their free text responses. Additionally, while the COVID-19
vaccines were made available to employees at the time of the survey, many may have had
access issues, which our survey was not designed to assess. The 11% of respondents in our
survey who reported they planned to get the vaccine but had not scheduled or gone for their
vaccine yet may have experienced access issues. We recognize that access plays an important
role in vaccine uptake and future studies should investigate inequities in access to vaccines and
to accurate information. Intervention design targeting marginalized groups of healthcare workers
and others will need to account for the dynamic interplay between vaccine access and ease of
access, respectful service delivery, and vaccine behaviors.

Conclusion
In this study of 1,933 healthcare workers during the initial COVID-19 vaccine rollout in
New York City, our data demonstrated high overall receipt and confidence. Beliefs in the
COVID-19 vaccine’s importance in protecting others were the strongest independent predictors
of vaccine receipt. Even among healthcare workers with concerns about safety, side effects or
being experimented on, over 50% did receive the first dose of vaccine, suggesting a potential
pathway for intervention among these workers. Beyond beliefs specific to COVID-19
vaccination, overall vaccine confidence on a standardized instrument was high.
Our study also demonstrated striking inequities in COVID-19 vaccine receipt. Black
healthcare workers, adjusting for occupation and other factors, were less likely to receive the
COVID-19 vaccine. A quarter of healthcare workers expressed concerns about being
experimented on, particularly among marginalized groups. Addressing mistrust in public health
and healthcare related to systemic racism will be critical in achieving a more equitable vaccine
response.
