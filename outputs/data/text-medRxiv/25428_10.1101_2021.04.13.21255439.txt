Key Words: MIS-C, cytokines, thrombotic microangiopathy, macrophage activation syndrome,
SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19

Abstract
Multi-system Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) is a major complication of the
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic in pediatric
patients. Weeks after an often mild or asymptomatic initial infection with SARS-CoV-2 children
may present with a severe shock-like picture and marked inflammation. Children with MIS-C
present with varying degrees of cardiovascular and hyperinflammatory symptoms. We
performed a comprehensive analysis of the plasma proteome of more than 1400 proteins in
children with SARS-CoV-2. We hypothesized that the proteome would reflect heterogeneity in
hyperinflammation and vascular injury, and further identify pathogenic mediators of
disease. Protein signatures demonstrated overlap between MIS-C, and the inflammatory
syndromes macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) and thrombotic microangiopathy
(TMA). We demonstrate that PLA2G2A is a key marker of MIS-C that associates with TMA.
We found that IFNγ responses are dysregulated in MIS-C patients, and that IFNγ levels delineate
clinical heterogeneity.

Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) emerged as the major pediatric
complication of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
pandemic of 2020.1-3 MIS-C is characterized by fever and inflammation, and has some clinical
features overlapping with Kawasaki disease (KD).3-7 Due to the similarities with KD, initial
treatment regimens for MIS-C included both intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and
corticosteroids.8-10 Data from randomized controlled trials comparing these two treatments is not
yet available, however, best evidence to date suggests that IVIG alone provides suboptimal
treatment for MIS-C.8

Although the phenotypes of KD and MIS-C are overlapping, they have important clinical
differences and immune profiling has delineated separate but overlapping signatures between the
conditions.5,11-13 Shock is a marked feature in patients with MIS-C, with the majority of patients
requiring pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission.4 The severity of MIS-C has invoked
cytokine storm as a potential driver of symptoms.11 SARS-CoV-2 infection leading to severe
Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) can also lead to cytokine storm.14 Multiple cytokines
including interferon gamma (IFNγ), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, IL-1, IL-17 and IL-1β have been
implicated as potentially causative in patients with MIS-C.11,15 The putative role of cytokine
dysregulation in the pathophysiology of MIS-C has led to the use of cytokine blockade with
agents such as tocilizumab or anakinra in refractory patients, however, the optimal targeted agent
has not yet been determined.9 Improved understanding of the cytokine dysregulation in these
patients is critical to identifying rational targeted therapies.

In addition to shock and inflammation, MIS-C and SARS-CoV-2 infection are associated with an
increased risk of thrombosis in both adult and pediatric patients (Whitworth et al. Blood, in

press).16 We have previously demonstrated that infection with SARS-CoV-2 and MIS-C are
associated with thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), and the associated biomarker soluble C5B9
(SC5B9).17 TMA is a group of diseases characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia,
thrombocytopenia and organ dysfunction related to microthrombi.18 TMA can occur as a primary
process or secondary to infection, inflammatory insult or in hematopoietic stem cell transplant
(HSCT).18,19 The mechanism of TMA in the context of MIS-C is not known, and its association
with cytokine dysregulation remains unclear.

We interrogated >1400 proteins in the plasma proteome and integrated this information with
clinical and high-dimensional flow cytometry data. We hypothesized that distinct dysregulations
in proteins and associated pathways that relate to cytokine storm and vascular injury contribute
to the underlying pathophysiology of MIS-C. Our goals were to understand the pathophysiology
of MIS-C via a thorough examination of the plasma proteome, and to identify candidate
biomarkers and predictors of disease severity.

RESULTS

Patients Included in the Study

Between April 2020 and October 2020, we enrolled 63 hospitalized patients with MIS-C (N=22),
Severe COVID-19 (“Severe”, N=15) or asymptomatic or mild SARS-CoV-2 infection
(“Minimal”, N=26). In addition, we included remnant plasma samples from otherwise healthy
patients (“Healthy”, N=25). Details of the clinical presentation of MIS-C, Severe, and Minimal
patients are presented in Supplemental Tables S1 and S2. Similar to previously reported cohorts,
a high proportion (N = 17, 77%) of patients with MIS-C were admitted to the PICU.2,4 We

utilized the Olink Explore 1536/384 protein biomarker platform to interrogate the plasma
proteome of all 88 patients. A subset of patients included in this study have been reported
previously.17,20-23 Flow cytometry data was available for 20 patients included in this study (MISC N=8, Severe N=6, Minimal N=6), reported previously by Vella et al.20

We first sought to validate the accuracy of the O-link platform. Patients with MIS-C in our
sample had marked elevations of brain-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and troponin measured
clinically (Supplemental Table S2). The Olink panel measures N-terminal prohormone brain
natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP), a protein pre-cursor to BNP associated with cardiac damage.24
NTproBNP was significantly higher in MIS-C patients (Supplemental Figure S1A), consistent
with other reports.15 As expected, Olink NTproBNP correlated highly with clinical BNP
(R=0.78, p =2.7e-08; Supplemental Figure S1B) .

To further validate the data, we compared cytokines measured in our laboratory with the same
cytokines measured by Olink and demonstrated strong correlations (Supplemental Figures S1C).
We and others have previously found elevations in IL-10 distinguish patients with MIS-C from
those with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. We confirmed this observation with data from Olink
(Supplemental Figure S1D).13,21

Overall Architecture of Pediatric SARS-CoV-2 and MIS-C Plasma Proteome

Following this validation, we next took an unbiased approach to investigate the proteomic data.
The overall architecture of the data is presented in Figure 1. Patients with MIS-C cluster
differently from patients with acute SARS-CoV-2 or healthy patients when visualized with tdistributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE; Figure 1A). Vella et al. previously

demonstrated that MIS-C is associated with CD8+ T-cell activation and Tbet+ plasmablasts.20 In
the subset of patients on whom flow cytometry data was available, we overlaid flow cytometry
markers on tSNE clustering. Interestingly, there was heterogeneity in percent of activated CD8+
T-cells and percent of Tbet+ plasmablasts within the MIS-C clusters (Figure 1A).20 Furthermore,
there appears to be an inverse relationship between regions with higher percentage of activated
CD8+ cells and a higher percentage Tbet+ plasmablasts within these MIS-C subclusters.

In order to look at loading plots of the most prominent drivers of difference between groups, we
used principal component analysis (PCA) to visualize clustering between patients. To achieve
better separation between groups, we limited the analysis to proteins that were differentially
expressed between any of the four groups (N=231). Lists of differentially expressed proteins
(DEP) between all groups are available in Supplemental Material M1. The corresponding Scree
plot and top 20 contributions to each dimension of the PCA are available in Supplemental
Figures S2A-C. Multiple IFNγ responsive proteins contribute to PCA Dimension 2, including IL27, CXCL9, IL18BP and CCL23. Healthy patients clustered separately from those with Severe,
Minimal or MIS-C (Figure 1B), while patients with Severe and MIS-C overlapped. The top ten
contributing proteins that account for the variance associated with PCA Dimensions 1 and 2 are
presented in Figure 1C.

Twenty patients with MIS-C received treatment with both steroids and IVIG. One patient was
treated with IVIG alone, and one patient did not receive treatment. Convalescent samples were
available on 12 patients (54%). To understand how the overall proteome of patients with MIS-C
changes over time, we first created a PCA mapping all proteins and all patients (Figure 1D). We
then PCA transformed data for convalescent samples on that space (Figure 1E). Convalescent

samples shifted towards the healthy controls, implying that following treatment, the proteome in
MIS-C patients returns towards a baseline state. Pre- and post-treatment samples were available
on 5 patients. To investigate if the timing of initial collection relative to treatment altered the
proteome, we assessed change over time in one of the most differentially expressed proteins,
phospholipase A2 (PLA2G2A; Supplemental Figure S1E). PLA2G2A pre- and post-treatment
samples did not significantly differ in acute timepoints suggesting that sampling of plasma
shortly after treatment does not immediately affect results.

Uncovering Pathways of Activation in Patients with MIS-C and SARS-CoV-2 Infection

We used unbiased exploration of DEPs to understand pathways of activation between MIS-C,
Minimal and Severe patients compared to healthy patients. Volcano plots are presented in Figure
2. Notably, PLA2G2A is highly differentially expressed between all three groups compared to
healthy patients, with the most marked difference occurring in MIS-C patients.

In order to identify pathways of relevance to the pathophysiology of MIS-C and pediatric
COVID-19 we performed pathway analysis accounting for protein-protein interactions using
pathfindR.25 PathfindR uses an active subnetwork enrichment analysis approach to identify lists
of enriched pathways. Ranked pathways and enrichments are presented in Figure 2A-C. Lists of
all ranked pathways are available in Supplemental Material S2. A protein to pathway analysis on
the pathways of interest was performed to identify interactions between various proteins in the
datasets and pathways.

Cytokine-cytokine and chemokine-cytokine receptor pathways were dysregulated in all
classifications of pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infection. Notably, similar pathways were perturbed in

MIS-C, Minimal and Severe patients compared to healthy controls. Overlaps of DEPs between
disease states are shown in Supplemental Figure S3A. The majority of DEPs in Severe COVID19 are also differentially expressed in MIS-C. We directly assessed the DEPs between these
groups and surprisingly, there were very few differences (Supplemental Figure S3B). As this
comparison involved a smaller proportion of patients, we used a nominal p-value with a
threshold of 0.05.

MIS-C Is Characterized by a Disproportionate Response to Interferon Gamma
IFNγ has been associated with MIS-C in previous reports.12,15 We previously described that IFNγ
levels were high in patients with Severe and MIS-C, that levels of IFNγ could not distinguish
between these two groups and that IL-10 can distinguish MIS-C from Severe (Supplemental
Figure S3B).21 In order to better understand these two cytokines, we investigated correlations
between IFNγ and IL-10 and their canonical response proteins as well as proteins associated with
cellular populations responsible for their production (Figure 3). We examined CXCL9 as the
key protein associated with IFNγ response and found that all patients with SARS-CoV-2
infection showed a positive correlation between CXCL9 and IFNγ. Strikingly, MIS-C patients
had a disproportionately high CXCL9 response to IFNγ compared to the other groups (Figure
3A; p<0.001 by logistical regression modelling). To probe the source of IFNγ production, we
correlated IFNγ levels with soluble markers of activated T-cells (IL2RA), NK-cells (NCR1) and
macrophages (CD163). IFNγ levels in MIS-C patients associated significantly with IL2RA and
NCR1 but not CD163, suggesting that IFNγ levels correlate with T-cells and NK-cells but not
macrophages (Figure 3A).

Levels of IL-10 have been shown previously, and in this cohort, to be significantly higher in
patients with MIS-C than in those with Severe COVID-19 (Supplemental Figure S1D).13,21
Similar to the analysis above, we examined the expression of IL12B, which should be inhibited
by IL-10.26 IL12B was inversely correlated with IL-10 in patients with MIS-C, but not in
Minimal, Severe or Healthy patients (Figure 3B). This finding implies that the elevated IL-10 in
MIS-C patients is bioactive. IL-10 production was significantly associated with markers of
activated T-cells and macrophages, but not with NK-cells (Figure 3B).

We subsequently examined the relationship between IFNγ, CXCL9 and IL-10 and activated
CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells from flow cytometry data in order to probe these correlations further
(Figure 3C&D). We found that CXCL9 was significantly and strongly correlated with both cell
types but IFNγ was not, suggesting T-cells are being activated by IFNγ rather than producing
IFNγ. IL-10 was significantly associated with activated CD4+ but not activated CD8+ T-cells.
MIS-C Patients have an MAS-like phenotype characterized by IFNγ and CXCL9 signaling

The outsized response to IFNγ with excessive CXCL9 expression in patients with MIS-C evoked
the cytokine phenotype of macrophage activation syndrome (MAS).27,28 MAS is a
hyperinflammatory condition that occurs in the setting of rheumatologic diseases, infections or
as a primary disorder, characterized by excessive activation of lymphocytes and macrophages in
the setting of marked IFNγ production.29,30 We therefore investigated whether IFNγ, CXCL9 and
other markers associated with MAS could distinguish different SARS-CoV-2 outcomes (Figure
4A).28,30,31 Unsupervised hierarchical clustering revealed two distinct groups of MIS-C patients
that had elevations in most of the MAS markers. These two clusters primarily differed by their
IFNγ expression with an IFNγ-high versus IFNγ-low group evident.

To further interrogate the hypothesis that MAS was associated with MIS-C, we applied a
modified version of the Ravelli MAS criteria to all patients on whom ferritin had been measured
(N=40; MIS-C N=21, Minimal N=6, Severe N=13).32 If parameters were missing, they were
imputed as negative to bias our score towards the null hypothesis. We compared patients who
met criteria for MAS to those who did not (Supplemental Table S3). CD163, CXCL9, IFNγ,
IL2RA and VSIG4 were significantly elevated in patients who met MAS criteria (Figure 4B).
We found that maximum ferritin during admission was significantly higher in patients that met
criteria for MAS than those that did not (P<0.0001) but did not differ significantly between the
disease groups as a whole (Figure 4C&D). In MIS-C patients on whom both an acute and a
convalescent sample was available (N=12), IFNγ, CXCL9 and IL2RA all significantly decreased
over time (Figure 4E). For patients with MIS-C, time of sample draw relative to treatment with
IVIG or steroids against IFNγ level is presented in Supplemental Figure S1F and shows decay
over time.

MAS is typically associated with cytopenias, including neutropenia. In contrast, MIS-C is
characterized by marked neutrophilia,4 and in patients who met criteria for MAS high absolute
neutrophil counts (ANC) were apparent (Figure 4F). ANC was significantly higher in patients
with MIS-C than in those with Severe or Minimal (Figure 4G). In MIS-C patients, neutrophilia
did not correlate with IFNγ or CXCL9 but correlated strongly with CD163, implying
neutrophilia in these patients is associated with macrophage activation (R=0.72, p<0.0001;
Figure 4H), but not directly related to IFNγ or CXCL9. Macrophage hyperresponsiveness to
IFNγ expression has been linked to TRIM8 dysregulation in MAS.33 We noted dysregulation of
another TRIM protein, the IFNγ signaling suppressive protein TRIM21.34,35 Consistent with a

derepression of IFNγ signaling, MIS-C patients expressed less TRIM21 compared to healthy
controls (Supplemental Figure S3C).

PLA2G2A is a candidate biomarker for MIS-C and is associated with a thrombotic
microangiopathy phenotype

We and others have previously demonstrated that infection with SARS-CoV-2 is associated with
clinical TMA and elevations in the TMA biomarker SC5B9.17,36 As SC5B9 was not included in
the Olink analysis, we correlated SC5B9 levels measured in our laboratory (N=75) to Olink
proteins related to vascular or platelet dysfunction to identify surrogate biomarkers. Hierarchical
clustering identified that SC5B9 correlated most highly with PLA2G2A, PDGFC, SELE,
CALCA, NOS3, VWA1 and TYMP (Figure 5A).

We then evaluated whether proteins highly correlated with SC5B9 were able to identify disease
category (Figure 5B). Patients with MIS-C clustered due to very high PLA2G2A expression, and
moderate CALCA and TYMP expression. PLA2G2A and CALCA were both significantly
higher between MIS-C and Severe patients (Figure 5C). PLA2G2A is significantly higher in
SARS-CoV-2 infected patients than in healthy patients with the most marked difference in
patients with MIS-C (Figure 5C). In MIS-C patients, PLA2G2A, SELE, CALCA and VWA1 all
improved between the acute and convalescent phases (Figure 5D). Notably, levels of PLA2G2A
do not return completely to normal during convalescence.

For patients who had blood smears available for review (N=34; MIS-C N=15, Minimal N=11,
Severe N=8) we applied simple criteria for TMA, as previously published (Supplemental Table
S4).17 Meeting criteria for TMA was associated with a significantly higher PLA2G2A and

CALCA (Figure 5E). Patients who met criteria for TMA were more likely to require inotropes
during their admission than those who did not meet criteria for TMA (92% vs 23% respectively,
N=34, p-value <0.001). Given our hypothesis that PLA2G2A is a marker of TMA and
microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, we examined whether levels of PLA2G2A correlated to
lowest platelet count and lowest hemoglobin during admission. PLA2G2A levels inversely
correlated with platelets and hemoglobin with groupings by disease category evident (Figure 5F).

Clinical heterogeneity among MIS-C Patients

Next, we investigated the intersection between the MAS and TMA phenotypes and MIS-C.
Among MIS-C patients, TMA and MAS occurred independently (Fisher’s exact, p = n.s.; Figure
6A). Furthermore, when TMA and MAS phenotypes were overlayed on the same tSNE mapping
used in Figure 1, patient clustering by disease state was evident (Supplemental Figure S4A). To
further explore the heterogeneity among MIS-C patients, we compared patients from the IFNγhigh (N=7) and IFNγ-low (N=13) clusters identified in Figure 4A. We looked at DEPs between
these two clusters and performed unbiased pathway and clustering analysis (Figure 6B-D)
revealing differences in cytokine signaling including IL-17 pathways. IL-17 is a neutrophil
chemotactic factor and may relate to the neutrophilia present in these patients.37 In Supplemental
Figure S4B IFNγ levels are overlayed on the same tSNE map as displayed in Figure 1,
demonstrating heterogenous clustering within MIS-C.

We examined occurrence of TMA and MAS among these IFNγ-high and -low MIS-C clusters.
There was no increase in TMA among IFNγ-high MIS-C patients (Fisher’s exact, p = n.s.;
Supplemental Table S5). There was a trend towards a significantly increased enrichment in MAS
among IFNγ-high MIS-C patients compared to IFNγ-low patients (83% vs. 38%, Fisher’s exact

p=0.14; Supplemental Table S5). In keeping with this trend, IFNγ-high MIS-C patients had
significantly higher ferritin (p=0.036; Figure 6E). IFNγ status did not associate with fibrinogen,
d-dimer, platelet, hemoglobin or ANC.

In order to understand the relationship between IFNγ and clinical outcomes in MIS-C, we
examined surrogate markers of severity. We used requirement of inotropes as a surrogate marker
of severity. Surprisingly, patients within the IFNγ-high cluster had a lower likelihood of
requiring inotropes than those in the IFNγ-low cluster (Figure 6F), implying that higher levels of
IFNγ are associated with less severe illness in MIS-C patients. NTproBNP, a marker associated
with cardiac damage, showed a similar trend, although the result was not statistically significant,
likely due to a lack of power (Figure 6G). We performed this analysis on all patients with MIS-C
and found that higher levels of NTproBNP were higher in patients requiring inotropes (Figure
6H). Thus, it appears higher levels of IFNγ may be associated with less severe illness in patients
with MIS-C.

Previously, Vella et al. demonstrated that inotrope need was associated with higher frequencies
of activation of CX3CR1+ CD8+ T-cells.20 CX3CR1 is expressed on CD4+ T-cells, monocytes,
and effector-like CD8+ T-cells, and allows cells to interact with CX3CL1-expressing
vasculature.38,39 In MIS-C patients, activation of CX3CR1+ CD8+ T-cells (but not CX3CR1+
CD4+ T-cells; Supplemental Figure S4C) and IFNγ inversely correlated (Figure 6I; N=7, R=0.83, p=0.02). However, levels of the CX3CR1 ligand, CX3CL1 had no relationship to
CX3CR1+ CD8+ T-cell activation (Figure 6I). In our unbiased network analysis (Figure 6D) we
identified CX3CL1 as an enriched protein despite it not reaching the thresholds used for our
differential expression analysis (Figure 6C). When explicitly tested, we surpassingly observed an

association between elevated CX3CL1 and IFNγ-high patients, a group of patients we
demonstrated to be at lower risk for inotrope use (Figure 6J). The data suggest that free CX3CL1
levels in the plasma are independent of the frequency of CX3CR1+ CD8+ T-cell activation
(Figure 6I), explaining their differential association with inotrope requirement. Thus, we
demonstrate that patients with high IFNγ levels are less likely to require inotrope use and
accordingly have lower levels of CX3CR1+ CD8+ T-cell activation.

DISCUSSION

We used proteomic analysis to begin to unravel the complex and heterogeneous pathophysiology
associated with MIS-C. We identify PLA2G2A as a candidate biomarker for MIS-C and show
that PLA2G2A is associated with clinical features of TMA. We demonstrate that MIS-C patients
are characterized by a disproportionately high CXCL9 response to IFNγ, implying a dysregulated
response to IFNγ. We found that a subset of patients with MIS-C met modified criteria for the
IFNγ-associated syndrome MAS. Patients with MIS-C showed heterogeneity based on IFNγ
expression, and surprisingly, patients with higher IFNγ levels were less likely to require
inotropes.

PLA2G2A is involved in host inflammatory responses and is associated with release of damage
associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs) that play a key role in activation of the innate
immune response.40,41 PLA2G2A released from activated platelets is associated with
neutrophilia. 40 Expression of PLA2G2A can be driven by IFNγ seceretion.42-44 In HSCT
associated TMA, IFNγ has been identified as a key causative agent and part of an “interferoncomplement loop” that contributes to vessel injury and TA-TMA pathophysiology.45

Overlapping phenotypes of MAS and TMA have been reported by others in other disease
settings.46 We hypothesize that patients with MIS-C may be responding to IFNγ with excessive
PLA2G2A production. However, this relationship is likely complex as patients with high IFNγ
expression appear to be protected from cardiac toxicity associated with MIS-C. Whether or not
there is a causative relationship between PLA2G2A and TMA or MIS-C will need to be
determined in future experiments. Understanding the role of PLA2G2A in MIS-C
pathophysiology is crucial because PLA2G2A and its associated pathways can be targeted with
the common, inexpensive medication indomethacin.47 Furthermore, higher levels of PLA2G2A
associate with clinical findings of TMA. Regardless of the cause of PLA2G2A expression, the
levels are markedly high in almost all patients with MIS-C and differentiate MIS-C patients form
other SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, identifying PLA2G2A as a candidate biomarker for MISC. Future studies will need to prospectively examine PLA2G2A in patients with MIS-C and
acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and validate its role as a diagnostic biomarker of MIS-C.

Patients with MIS-C produced excessive CXCL9 in response to IFNγ. CXCL9 production has
been associated with an increased risk of mortality in adult patients with severe COVID-19
disease and may contribute to cytokine storm in that setting.48 One potential explanation for the
heightened CXCL9 response to IFNγ in MIS-C patients is lower levels of TRIM21, a protein
notable for its ability to repress IFNγ signaling through degradation of interferon response
factors.34,35 TRIM21 is induced by IFNγ, and indeed was one of the upregulated factors in the
IFNγ-high MIS-C group, suggesting that this negative feedback loop is at least still partially
intact in MIS-C despite the generally lower levels of TRIM21.49 In keeping with IFNγ
dysregulation, found that a subset of patients with MIS-C met modified criteria for MAS. We

note that an IFNγ-high and -low subgrouping of MIS-C has been noted by others.7 While the
connection to MAS was also invoked by Esteve-Solie et al., we have clearly shown a connection
between IFNγ-high MIS-C patients and objective MAS features in our data.

Other features of MAS in patients with MIS-C have been reported in the literature, including
overlapping cytokine phenotypes and hemophagocytosis on bone marrow aspirates.50 Although
the evidence suggests that MIS-C does share many things in common with MAS, the clinical
presentation of MIS-C patients is not fully consistent with a complete MAS phenotype and may
be better understood as an occult MAS.51,52 MAS is often treated with IL-1β blockade.53
Interestingly, IL-1β blockade with anakinra, a recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist has been
reported in many case reports as efficacious in MIS-C, and it is recommended for refractory
patients in the American College of Rheumatology guidelines.54 We further note that IL-1RN,
the endogenous IL-1 receptor antagonist is upregulated in the IFNγ high group (Figure 6B). It is
interesting to speculate whether this confers some of the cardiac protection seen in this group.

Curiously, we found that IFNγ-high patients were less likely to require inotropes, a result that is
not consistent with other disorders associated with dysregulated IFNγ production.28 This result
was confirmed by an anti-correlation between IFNγ and CD8+ CX3CR1+ T-cells, a cell
population which has been previously associated with an increased need for inotropes in MIS-C
patients.20 The novel observation that IFNγ may predict cardiac pathology in MIS-C may prove
to be useful clinically as cytokine testing becomes more readily available in hospital settings.
Future work should test this prospectively.

We have made several key observations about the underlying pathophysiology of MIS-C,
however, our study is limited by several factors. First, we retrospectively applied clinical
categorizations for TMA and MAS to patients included in this study in order to understand
relationships between clinical phenotypes and cytokine signatures. Neither of the clinical criteria
used have been validated in this setting, and future studies should prospectively validate clinical
criteria for these disorders in pediatric patients. Due to the rarity of this condition, we are
underpowered to examine the full scope of clinical heterogeneity among MIS-C patients. We
have identified important pathways to be examined in further detail in future mechanistic studies.

MIS-C is an important emergent syndrome characterized by excessive cytokine production and
vascular-endothelial dysfunction. We have demonstrated that PLA2G2A is a key marker of MISC and associates with TMA. We have uncovered dysregulations in IFNγ responses in MIS-C
patients and that IFNγ levels themselves reveal clinically relevant heterogeneity within MIS-C.
Future studies should mechanistically examine the relationships between IFNγ, PLA2G2A, and
their drivers in MIS-C initiation.

ONLINE METHODS

Study Approvals

This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and received approval
from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at CHOP. Verbal consent for this minimal risk study
was obtained from patients or their legally authorized representative. Consent forms were signed
by the consenting study team member and a copy was provided to the study participant or legally
authorized representative. If appropriate, assent was obtained from children who were 7 years of
age or older.

For remnant samples obtained from healthy controls, protected health information (PHI) was not
recorded. A limited chart review of this cohort was granted by the CHOP IRB to determine that
patients met criteria to be considered “healthy”. CHOP IRB granted exemption criteria per 45
CFR 46.104(d) 4(ii) and waiver of HIPPA authorization.

Study Design and Population
Patients were eligible to be prospectively enrolled in the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia
(CHOP) SARS-CoV-2 biobank if they were admitted to CHOP during the COVID-19 pandemic
and had either a positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) result from upper respiratory tract mucosa, had a positive SARS-CoV-2 antibody or met
criteria for MIS-C. These enrollment criteria have been described in detail previously.17,21

Patient samples were collected as soon as possible after admission to the hospital. All samples
were collected in combination with a clinical blood draw. Blood for protein analysis was
collected in a lithium heparin tube and separated into plasma and cell pellets. Components were
frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen and -80 freezer respectively. Batch analysis was performed
on plasma samples. Blood for flow cytometry was collected in a sodium heparin tube.20 In
patients who remained in hospital, samples were collected weekly.

Plasma from otherwise healthy control patients who were being evaluated for symptoms of a
bleeding disorder (such as epistaxis) were obtained from discarded plasma from the coagulation
lab at CHOP. A limited chart review was performed to confirm these patients had no comorbid
medical illnesses. Patients found to have comorbid medical issues other than a possible isolated
bleeding disorder were excluded.

Data Collection
Clinical and laboratory data were abstracted from electronic patient charts on to standardized
case report forms created using the Research Electronic Data Capture database (REDCap;
Vanderbilt University, Nashville TN USA).55 Data were abstracted by a clinician or clinical
research assistant. All data elements were validated by a physician.

Clinical categorization
Enrolled patients were prospectively classified in to 3 groups by physicians with expertise
pediatric in hematology/oncology (CD, DT), pediatric infectious diseases (HB) or pediatric
rheumatology (EB). Patient classification criteria have been described in detail previously.17 In

brief, Severe COVID-19 was defined as patients requiring new mechanical or non-invasive
ventilatory support, or an increase in respiratory support above their baseline requirement.
Minimal COVID-19 was defined as either an incidental finding of SARS-CoV-2 positivity
during testing prior to an admission, diagnostic test or procedure or mild symptoms due to
COVID-19 that did not require non-invasive mechanical ventilation. Patients who required low
flow oxygen alone were categorized as Minimal COVID-19. MIS-C was defined per the Centers
for Disease Control (CDC) criteria as fever, evidence of inflammation (elevated CRP, ESR or
procalcitonin), multisystem organ involvement with at least two organ systems (cardiac, renal,
respiratory, hematologic, dermatologic, gastrointestinal or neurologic), evidence of past or
current positive SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR, serology or proven exposure to a close
contact within four weeks prior to the onset of symptoms.56

Patients were categorized as having thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) based on criteria
reported previously.17 Only patients on whom a Hematoxylin-Eosin stained peripheral blood
smear available were evaluated for TMA (N=34). The criteria used included presence of
thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and organ dysfunction. Hemolytic
anemia was defined as anemia for age and schistocytes present on a peripheral blood smear.
Organ dysfunction was defined as cardiac dysfunction (troponin greater than the upper limit of
normal for age or requirement of inotropes), renal dysfunction (based on the Kidney Disease:
Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria)57 or liver dysfunction (bilirubin greater than
twice the upper limit of normal for age, alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase
greater than three times the upper limit of normal).

In patients on whom a ferritin was available (N=40), a modified version of the Ravelli criteria for
MAS were applied.32 We modified the Ravelli criteria to exclude triglyceride levels because they
were not measured in the majority of our patients. We defined a modified Ravelli criteria as
ferritin>684ng/mL and any 2 of 1) platelet count<181,000/uL, AST>48U/L, or
fibrinogen<360mg/dL. If any data were missing, they were imputed as negative/normal in order
to bias our categorization towards the null hypothesis.

Proteomic analysis
Plasma protein levels were analyzed using the Olink Explore 1536/384 panel (Olink Proteomics,
Uppsala, Sweden). Data were reported in normalized protein expression values (NPX). NPX is
an arbitrary unit in a Log2 scale calculated from inverted, normalized Ct values. All assay
validation data are available on the Olink website (www.olink.com).

sC5b9 ELISA Assay
sC5b9 levels were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA; Cat.
#558315; BD Biosciences, San Jose CA, USA). Assays were performed at two dilutions; all
samples were assayed in triplicate, using manufacturer protocols. As previously described, we
set the upper limit of normal for our sC5b9 assay at 247 ng/mL. sC5b9 measurements were row
normalized to a Z-score and log2 transformed in order to be comparable to NPX scores.

Flow cytometry analysis
Detailed methods for flow cytometry analysis have been described previously.20 Briefly,
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from blood collected in sodium

heparin tubes. PBMCs were stained with a live/dead stain and then treated with Fc block before
staining for chemokine receptors, surface markers and intracellular markers. Samples were
acquired on a 5 laser FACS Symphony A5 (BD Biosciences). All analysis was performed in
FlowJo (Treestar, version 10.6.2). Flow cytometry data were transformed to a Z-score for all of
the values for each gate used in order to be able to compare to the Log2 transformed NPX scores
used in the Olink dataset.

General statistical methods
All statistical analyses were performed in R (version 4.0.4) using RStudio (RStudio, PBC,
Boston, MA).58 Data were assumed to be non-parametric unless normality was demonstrated.
Correlations were performed with Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient for non-parametric
data and Pearson’s correlation coefficient for parametric data. Kruskall-Wallis testing was
performed to compare three or more groups and Wilcoxcon signed-rank test was performed for
paired groups. To test for associations between discrete variables, Fisher’s exact test was used if
small numbers were available in each cell. Otherwise, Chi-square testing was used. Unless
otherwise stated, significance was based on a fold change greater than 2 or less the -2 and a false
discovery rate (FDR; using Benjamini-Hochberg correction) value of less than 0.01.

Clustering analysis
The T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (tSNE) for R package was used to perform
tSNE clustering.59 Principal component analysis was performed using R version 4.0.4. The
factoextra package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/factoextra/index.html) was used to
extract and visualize PCA elements.

Pathway analysis
We completed a differential expression analysis of all proteins using a log2fold change threshold
of 2 and FDR threshold of 0.01. Proteins from the Olink data set were inputted in to PathfindR
along with their respective log2fold change and FDR value.25 Using an active subnetwork
enrichment analysis approach, PathfindR outputs a table that represents enriched pathways
identified from the protein list inputted into the program. We used the KEGG pathway database
(https://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html) which includes a manual collection of pathway
maps examining a total of 777,729 molecular pathways, with 544 main pathways included. Only
pathways that had a p-value of <=0.01 were considered. The final table produced by PathfindR
includes a table of significant pathways with an associated adjusted p-value, a fold enrichment
value of the pathway, the lowest and highest p-values generated from each iteration of the
pathways analysis, and the upregulated and downregulated proteins from the input protein list for
every pathway.25

Figure 1. Overarching architecture of plasma proteome in patients with Multisystem
Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C; N=22), minimal Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; N=26) infection, and Severe Coronavirus Disease
(COVID-19; N=15) compared to healthy controls (N=25). t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor
Embedding (tSNE) plots are used to visualize clustering between the four groups of patients (A)
with overlay from flow cytometry-based scores of percent of non-naïve CD4+ T-cells that are
activated (HLA-DR+CD38+), percent non-naïve CD8+ T-cells that are activated, percent of nonnaive B-cells that are plasmablasts, and percent of plasmablasts that are T-bet+. Gray dots
indicate that data was not available. Clustering was further examined using principal component
analysis (PCA) of DEPs between all 4 patient groups, log2 fold-change threshold of 2 and FDR
threshold of 0.01 (B). The top 20 proteins contributing to PCA Dimensions 1 and 2 are presented
in Panel C. To understand the change in the proteome over time in MIS-C patients we first
created a PCA of all proteins for all disease categories (D). MIS-C patients with matched acute
and convalescent samples (N=12) were then transformed onto the space. Acute samples are
shown in orange and convalescent samples in purple. Lines connect matched pairs.

Figure 2. Differentially expressed proteins, ranked pathway analysis and network analysis
for each disease state compared to healthy controls. Differentially expressed proteins, log2
fold change threshold of 2 and FDR threshold of 0.01, between patients with MIS-C (N=22) and
healthy controls (N=25) are shown in (A), along with ranked pathway analysis. Size of dots
represents number of enriched genes and intensity of colors represents p-value associated with
enrichment analysis. Network analyses are shown where up-regulated proteins are colored in
green and down-regulated proteins are colored in red. Node size of the pathway term represents
number of input proteins implicated in the pathway. The same series of graphs is shown for
patients with minimal Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2;
N=26) infection compared healthy controls (B), and Severe Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19;
N=15) patients compared to healthy controls (C).

Figure 3. Interferon gamma (IFNγ) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) responses and associated cell
types. Spearman correlations between IFNγ signaling and its canonical response protein
(CXCL9), as well as proteins associated with activated T-cells (IL2RA), NK cells (NCR1) and
macrophages (CD163) for patients with (MIS-C; N=22), Minimal Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome Corona Virus 2 infection (SARS-CoV-2; N=26) infection, and Severe Corona Virus
Disease (COVID-19; N=15) compared to healthy controls (N=25) are shown in panel (A).
Correlations between IL-10 and its canonical receptor IL12B, as well as IL2RA, NCR1 and
CD163 for each disease category are shown in panel (B). Panel (C) shows correlations between
HLADR+CD38+ CD8+ T-cells (N=19) and IFNγ, CXCL9, and IL-10. Dots are colored by each
patient’s disease category. Panel (D) demonstrates correlations between HLADR+CD38+ CD4+
