Abstract.
A polymorphism in the LZTFL1 gene located in the chemokine-receptor gene cluster
(chromosome 3p) has been associated with the risk of developing COVID-19. The
chemokine receptor-5 (CCR5) maps to this region, and the common 32 bp deletion
variant (Δ32) has been associated with the extent of inflammatory disease and the
outcome in several viral diseases. Several studies have also suggested that the
pharmacological targeting of CCR5 could reduce the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection
and the severity of COVID-19. We sought to investigate whether this polymorphism
was associated with the risk of moderate-severe COVID-19.
We genotyped 294 patients who required hospitalization due to COVID-19 (85 were
severe cases) and 460 controls. We found a significantly lower frequency of CCR5-Δ32
among the COVID-19 patients (0.10 vs 0.18 in controls; p=0.002, OR=0.48,
95%CI=0.29-0.76). The difference was mainly due to the reduced frequency of CCR5-

Δ32 carriers in the severe, significantly lower than in the non-severe patients (p=0.036).
Of note, we did not find deletion-homozygotes among the patients compared to 1%
among controls. We also confirmed the association between a LZTFL1 variant and
COVID-19. Our study points to CCR5 as a promising target for treatment of COVID19, but requires validation in additional large cohorts. In confirmed by others, the
genetic analysis of CCR5-variants (such as Δ32) might help to identify patients with a
higher susceptibility to severe COVID-19.

Introduction.
The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 varies from none or very mild-symptoms to
moderate symptoms that required hospitalization, and in some cases severe pneumonia
and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that requires mechanical ventilation
and admission into intensive care unit (ICU). An exacerbated immune response
(cytokine storm) drives the severity of COVID-19 (Bohn et al., 2020; Tang et al.,
2020; Xiong et al., 2020). Among other findings, COVID-19 patients showed elevated
levels of IL-6 and other proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and chemokinereceptors (Han et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Zeng et al., 2020).
The C-C chemokine-receptor-5 (CCR5) is expressed on several cell types, including T
cells, macrophages and dendritic cells. CCR5 binds to the chemokine RANTES/CCL-5,
that has been reported to be increased in COVID-19. CCR5 might thus play a role in
inflammatory responses to coronaviruses infection. Human dendritic cells infected by
SARS-CoV-1 showed increased CCR5 expression (Law et al., 2009). A single-cell
RNA sequencing on nasopharyngeal and bronchial samples from patients with moderate
or critical disease and healthy controls pointed to CCR5 pathways as suppressors of
immune hyperactivation in critical COVID-19 (Chua et al., 2020). The levels of ccr5
mRNA were increased in mice infected with the SARS-Cov (Chen et al., 2010). It has
been reported that mice deficient in CCR5 infected with SARS-CoV-1 exhibited defects
in directing inflammatory to the airway compared to wild-type mice (Sheahan et al.,
2008). Mice lacking the CCR5 infected with a neurotropic coronavirus showed reduced
macrophage infiltration and demyelination (Glass et al., 2001).
A recent study showed a beneficial effect of leronlimab (a CCR5 blocking antibody) on
a reduced group of severe COVID-19 patients (Patterson et al., 2020). These patients
showed a significant reduction of the SARS-Cov-2 viral load, with a rapid reduction of
plasma IL-6 and restoration of the CD4/CD8 ratio. In another study a total of 23
hospitalized severe/critical COVID-19 patients received leronlimab subcutaneously
(Yang et al., 2020). By day 30 after initial dosing Leronlimab was safe and well
tolerated, 17/23 were recovered and 4/23 had died. The authors concluded that those
with lower inflammatory markers had better outcomes, with

IL-6 tending to fall

overtime. Cenicriviroc (CVC) is a CCR5 antagonist with potent and selective antihuman immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) activity. CVC showed anti SARS-Cov-2

activity by inhibition of virus-induced cell destruction and reduction of the viral RNA
levels in culture supernatants of infected cells (Okamoto et al., 2020).
CCR5 is the receptor for HIV entry into the host cells, and a common variant that
abrogates its expression in homozygotes (the 32 bp deletion, Δ32) is associated with the
resistance to AIDS among HIV-exposed (Kou and Kuang, 2019). Approximately 1%
of Europeans are Δ32-homozygotes (Figure 1), and carriers of this variant would have
a reduced inflammatory response. This effect on CCR5-mediated responses could
explain the association of

Δ32

with several immune-mediated diseases (Hutter and

Ganepola, 2011; González et al., 2001; Soto-Sánchez et al., 2010). CCR5-Δ32 might
also influence the immunological response to several viruses (Ellwanger et al., 2020).
The first COVID-19 Genome Wide Association study (GWAs) reported a strong
association with chromosome 3 variants in the chemokine-receptor cluster (Ellinghaus
et al., 2020). CCR5 maps to this region and could thus partly explain the observed
association with polymorphisms in the chemokine-receptor cluster. We sought to
investigate whether CCR5-Δ32 was associated with the risk of developing COVID-19
or was a genetic modifier of disease severity.

Patients and Methods.
The study was based on 294 patients who required hospitalization due to COVID-19
(mean age 64.77 years, range 24-95) and 460 population age-matched controls (mean
age 70.01 years, range 50-81). All the study participants were Caucasian from the
region of Asturias (Northern Spain, total population 1 million). Severe cases (n=85)
were defined as those in need of critical care support, including high-flow oxygen,
positive-pressure ventilation (either invasive or non-invasive) or vasoactive drugs. The
presence of comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolaemia) was obtained
from the participants medical records. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee
of Principado de Asturias (Oviedo, Spain), and all the patients or their representatives
gave their consent to participate.
We genotyped two variants closely linked in the chromosome 3 chemokine receptor
cluster, LZTFL1 rs67959919 and CCR5-Δ32 (rs333). The genomic DNA was PCRamplyfied with primers flanking the two polymorphic sites (supplementary figure).
SNP rs67959919 was in complete linkage disequilibrium with rs11385942, associated
with COVID-19 in a recent GWAs (supplementary figure) (Ellinghaus et al., 2020).
For this SNP the PCRs were digested with the restriction enzyme MspI and the allele4

fragments visualised by agarose gel electrophoresis (supplementary figure). For the

Δ32 the PCRs were directly electrophoresed on 4% agarose gels (González et al., 2001;
Soto-Sánchez et al., 2010). The accuracy of the genotyping methods was validated by
sequencing samples representative of the genotypes (figure 2). All the participant´s data
(age, sex, COVID-19 severity, hypertension, and genotypes) were collected in an excel
file and in accordance to the requirements of the Ethical Committee. Statistical analysis
was performed with the R-project free software (www.r-project.org). Logistic
regression (linear generalized model, LGM) was used to compare mean values and
frequencies between the groups.

Results and discussion.
The main finding of our study was a significantly lower frequency of CCR5-Δ32 among
the COVID-19 patients (table 1). Multiple logistic regression with age, sex and
hypertension showed that in our population carriers of the 32 bp deletion were
significantly less frequent among the patients (30/294=0.10 vs 85/460=0.18 in controls;
p=0.002, OR=0.48, 95%CI=0.29-0.76). The difference was mainly due to the reduced
frequency of CCR5-Δ32 carriers in the severe-ICU group, significantly lower than in
the non-severe patients (p=0.036). Of note, we did not find deletion-homozygotes
among the patients compared to 1% among controls. Carriers of the deletion would
express less membrane-bound receptor and an attenuated pro-inflammatory response
mediated by the ligand binding to CCR5. This might explain the reported protective
effect of

Δ32

on the development of clinical manifestations with underlying

inflammatory mechanisms, such as atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease
(Muntinghe et al., 2009; González et al., 2001; Vangelista and Vento, 2018). In
addition to the well-known protective effect against HIV-1, this variant has been
investigated in reference to the clinical outcomes of several viral infections, such as
hepatitis B and influenza A (Ruiz-Mateos et al., 2018; Ellwanger et al., 2020).
Because CCR5 is not a recognised receptor for SARS-Cov-2 the most likely
explanation for the protective effect of Δ32 in COVID-19 is an attenuated inflammatory
response among the CCR5-deletion carriers. This finding was in agreement with a
report that showed that mice lacking CCR5 infected with a neurotropic coronavirus
showed an attenuated inflammatory response, with reduced macrophage infiltration and
demyelination (Glass et al., 2001).
We confirmed the association between LZTFL1 (SNP rs67959919) and the risk of

COVID-19. LZTFL1 variants were associated with COVID-19 in a GWAs including
participants from Italy and Spain. In our cohort the rare T-allele was associated with an
increased risk of COVID-19 after correcting by age, sex and hypertension (P=0.003,
OR=1.86 (1.23-2.82), but we did not find significant difference between severe and
non-severe cases (Table 1). We calculated the Δ32 - rs67959919 haplotype frequencies
in patients and controls (table 2). The rs67959919 A – CCR5 non-deletion (wild-type)
haplotype was significantly more common among the patients (p<0.001, OR=2.01,
95%CI=1.45-2.79). We cannot exclude that the association between one of the variants
was a consequence to its linkage-disequilibrium (LD) with the other, or with some not
yet identified variant in the chemokine-receptor cluster. Multiple logistic regression
with the two genotypes were independent predictors of COVID-19: CCR5-Δ32 carriers,
p=0.005, OR=0.52 (95%CI=0.33-0.81); rs67959919-A carriers, p=0.024, OR=1.56
(95%CI=1.06-2.31).
The main limitation of our study was the reduced size of the patient´s cohort. However,
our results were in agreement with the reported association between chromosome
3p21.31 variants and COVID-19. In this way, the association between CCR5-Δ32 and
COVID-19 seems plausible and deserves further validation in larger cohorts. If
confirmed, the CCR5 variants might serve as valuable markers to identify individuals
predisposed to severe COVID-19. A limitation was also that we did not provide a
functional link between the CCR5 deletion and COVID-19 outcomes, and we cannot
conclude whether this variant was associated with an overall resistance to SARS-Cov-2
infection or a reduced inflammatory response, or both. Although the CCR5 has not a
recognised role in SARS-CoV-2 binding to the host cell, a preliminary study showed
that the CCR5 inhibitor Maraviroc was able to decrease the extent of viral-cell fusion
and the viral load (Risner et al. 2020). To determine whether CCR5 has a direct role in
SARS-CoV-2 infection studies with mice expressing the human viral receptor (ACE-2)
and lacking ccr5 should be of upmost relevance (Winckler et al., 2020; Israelow et al.,
2020).

Finally, the pharmacological blockade of CCR5 has been associated with an
improvement of the symptoms in a group of severe COVID-19 patients. In a limited
study involving 10 patients the anti-CCR5 antibody Leronlimab showed an
improvement of disease symptoms, with a rapid reduction of plasma IL-6 and
restoration of the CD4/CD8 ratio and a significant reduction of the SARS-Cov-2 viral

load (Patterson et al., 2020). Also, in-vitro studies with SARS-Cov-2 infected cells
showed that the CCR5 antagonist Cenicriviroc had potent anti-viral activity by
inhibition of virus-induced cell destruction and reduction of the viral RNA levels
(Okamoto et al., 2020). These and other studies pointed to CCR5 as a potential target
for COVID-19 treatment. The genetic analysis of CCR5-variants, such as

Δ32, might

help to identify patients with a higher susceptibility to severe COVID-19.

Figure 2. Sequence electropherograms (above) and gel electrophoresis of PCR fragments
(below) corresponding at the three CCR5 32 bp deletion. The DNA was amplified with
CTGTGTTTGCGTCTCTCCCA and CCTCTTCTTCTCATTTCGACAC, and the PCRs
electrophoresed on a 4% agarose gel to visualise the alleles as fragments of 222 bp (wildtype) and 190 bp (Δ32).
