ABSTRACT
The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to the rapid initiation of urgently needed clinical
trials of repurposed drug combinations and monotherapies. These regimens were primarily relying
on mechanism-of-action based selection of drugs, many of which have yielded positive in vitro but
largely negative clinical outcomes. To overcome this challenge, we report the use of IDentif.AI, a
platform that rapidly optimizes infectious disease (ID) combination therapy design using artificial
intelligence (AI). In this study, IDentif.AI was implemented on a 12-drug candidate therapy search
set representing over 530,000 possible drug combinations. IDentif.AI demonstrated that the
optimal combination therapy against SARS-CoV-2 was comprised of remdesivir, ritonavir, and
lopinavir, which mediated a 6.5-fold improvement in efficacy over remdesivir alone. Additionally,

IDentif.AI showed hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin to be relatively ineffective. The
identification of a clinically actionable optimal drug combination was completed within two weeks,
with a 3-order of magnitude reduction in the number of tests typically needed. IDentif.AI analysis
was also able to independently confirm clinical trial outcomes to date without requiring any data
from these trials. The robustness of the IDentif.AI platform suggests that it may be applicable
towards rapid development of optimal drug regimens to address current and future outbreaks.

INTRODUCTION
Drug repurposing, or the use of approved and investigational therapies for other
indications, has been a widely implemented strategy towards treating COVID-19. Examples
include clinical studies of ritonavir and lopinavir (1); hydroxychloroquine in combination with
azithromycin (2); favipiravir in combination with tocilizumab (NCT04310228); remdesivir (3); and
losartan (NCT04312009), among others. In one trial, remdesivir met trial endpoints, reducing the
median time to recovery from 15 days to 11 days (P < 0.001), and has ultimately received United
States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorization for emergency use in severe COVID19 patients (4). The majority of trial outcomes are either pending or have not shown clinical benefit
over standard of care or placebo. As such, while drug repurposing enables rapid intervention
against COVID-19, there is still a lack of clarity with regards to how to best treat this disease.
Traditional methods for implementing combination therapy and monotherapy based on
drug repurposing rely on mechanism of action (MOA)-based drug selection and standard clinical
dosing guidelines to achieve drug synergy and therapeutic efficacy. For example, a recent
preclinical study showed that remdesivir as well as high-dose chloroquine were efficacious
towards SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. While this is an established approach that has led to promising
candidate therapies, many of these regimens were not able to translate their in vitro outcomes
into successful clinical results. Therefore, optimal efficacy that is clinically relevant is a different
objective that presents substantial challenges to traditional drug screening and repurposing

methods. For example, if candidate effective drugs are given in combination at suboptimal
respective doses, resulting efficacy is moderate or even absent. At the same time, the relative
doses between drugs within a combination can substantially impact treatment efficacy and toxicity
due to unpredictable drug interactions. Therefore, drug dosing has a critical role in identifying
which drugs belong in the optimal combination in the first place. Therefore, optimizing treatment
outcomes, particularly in combination therapy, ultimately relies on selecting the right drugs at the
right respective doses (5, 6). Reconciling drug-dose parameters also requires leveraging
unpredictable drug interactions in order to mediate maximal efficacy of combination therapies.
Unfortunately, simultaneously pinpointing these parameters is an extraordinarily complicated
task. For example, a parameter space of 1 trillion (1012) possible combinations would be created
from a pool of only 12 candidate therapies interrogated at 10 dose levels. This is an
insurmountable barrier for traditional drug screening. Important studies have previously sought to
leverage drug synergy interactions to predict multi-drug combinations (7). Other strategies have
investigated higher order drug interactions to develop antimicrobial drug combinations (8).
Bridging these findings with clinical validation remains a challenge due to the size of the
experimental search space.
In this study, we sought to overcome these challenges in developing effective combination
therapies against SARS-CoV-2 infection using the IDentif.AI platform. IDentif.AI harnesses a
quadratic relationship between therapeutic inputs (e.g. drug and dose) and biological outputs (e.g.
quantifiable measurements of efficacy, safety) to experimentally pinpoint optimal combinations
from large parameter spaces with a marked reduction in the number of required experiments (Fig.
1). Identif.AI does not use pre-existing training datasets, but rather uses an orthogonally-designed
set of calibrating regimens to simultaneously identify effective drugs and corresponding doses
that optimize treatment outcomes from prohibitively large drug-dose parameter spaces that
cannot be reconciled by brute force drug screening (5, 9). In effect, IDentif.AI leverages these
calibrating regimens to crowdsource SARS-CoV-2 live virus responses to experimentally drive

the efficacy towards an optimal outcome. In this study, IDentif.AI was applied to a 12-drug set of
candidate therapies to pinpoint clinically actionable combination therapy regimens against the live
SARS-Cov-2 virus isolated from a nasopharyngeal swab of a patient in Singapore (10). The 12drug set included a broad spectrum of repurposed agents that are currently being evaluated in
clinical studies for treatment of COVID-19 or being administered in conjunction with these
therapies, including remdesivir (RDV), favipiravir (FPV), ritonavir (RTV), lopinavir (LPV),
oseltamivir (OSV-P), dexamethasone (DEX), ribavirin (RBV), teicoplanin (TEC), losartan (LST),
azithromycin (AZT), chloroquine (CQ), and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). Based on prior studies of
minimal resolution experimental design, 3 dosing levels were employed with these 12 drugs,
creating a combinatorial space of 531,000 regimens (11). With a 3-order of magnitude reduction
in required tests, we identified a clinically actionable list of 2-,3-, and 4- drug combinations ranked
based on viral inhibition efficacy with accompanying safety data against kidney epithelial cells
(Vero E6), liver epithelial cells (THLE-2) and cardiomyocytes (AC16). The top-ranked combination
was comprised of remdesivir, ritonavir, and lopinavir, which mediated a 6.5-fold increase in
efficacy (viral inhibition %) compared to remdesivir alone. Further demonstrating the clinical
actionability of IDentif.AI, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin combination was shown to be a
relatively ineffective regimen, mirroring recent clinical results. Importantly, the IDentif.AIpinpointed relative efficacy of the combinations and monotherapies was independently
confirmatory of many of the clinical trial endpoints to date. These outcomes, coupled with the fact
that foundational precursors to IDentif.AI have been clinically validated for infectious disease,
oncology, and organ transplantation human studies, support the potential application of IDentif.AI
as a clinical decision support platform for the optimized design of actionable combination therapy
regimens (12-14).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
IDentif.AI Analysis
IDentif.AI, a dynamic optimization AI-based platform, identifies the drug-dose parameter
space by harnessing the quadratic relationship between biological responses to external
perturbations, such as drug/dose inputs (15). IDentif.AI analysis of the drug-dose parameter
space identifies drug-drug interactions and ranks optimal drug-dosage combinations. This study
aimed to use IDentif.AI to determine effective optimal drug-dosage combinations from a diverse

set of 12 drugs currently being explored in clinical trials to combat the COVID-19 disease. The
concentration levels of the 12 drugs for the in vitro IDentif.AI experiments were determined from
EC50, CC50, and Cmax for corresponding clinically administered dosages. From the in vitro
experiment data, IDentif.AI analyses were performed to identify drug combinations from this pool
of candidates that were effective against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Cell ATP activity for each well was processed using custom written Python 3.7.7 script
(Python Software Foundation). Data were normalized to the average readout from the DMSO
vehicle controls on the same plates. Vero E6, AC16 and THLE-2 %Cytotoxicity and viral activity
%Inhibition (Vero E6) were calculated using the same formulae as for the drug monotherapy
analysis (Supplementary Materials and Methods). %Inhibition calculations used cell and media
only control wells. The resulting %Cytotoxicity and %Inhibition calculations were used as inputs
in IDentif.AI analysis.
IDentif.AI analysis correlated drug combinations experimental results into a second-order
quadratic series. Each independent drug combination inhibition and monotherapy inhibition
replicate was used in the optimization process. The second-order quadratic model is as follows:

𝑦𝑦 = 𝛽𝛽0 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝑥𝑥1 + ⋯ + 𝛽𝛽𝑛𝑛 𝑥𝑥𝑛𝑛 + 𝛽𝛽12 𝑥𝑥1 𝑥𝑥2 + ⋯ + 𝛽𝛽𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 𝑥𝑥𝑚𝑚 𝑥𝑥𝑛𝑛 + 𝛽𝛽11 𝑥𝑥12 + ⋯ + ⋯ + 𝛽𝛽𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛 𝑥𝑥𝑛𝑛2
where y represents the desired biological response output (%Inhibition), xn is the n-th drug
concentration, β0 is the intercept term, β n is the single-drug coefficient of the n-th drug, β mn is the
interaction coefficient between the m-th and n-th drugs and β nn is the second-order coefficient for
the n-th drug, while m ≠ n. This second-order quadratic analysis and parabolic response surface
plot analysis were conducted using the built-in “stepwiselm” function in Matlab R2020a
(Mathworks, Inc.) with custom-written code. IDentif.AI derived four quadratic series using
bidirectional elimination approach with the P value from the F-Statistic as the selection criterion
for the experimental results: %Inhibition, %Cytotoxicity, %Cytotoxicity AC16, and %Cytotoxicity

THLE-2. Residual-based outlier analysis was performed for all four IDentif.AI series. Single
replicates identified as outliers remained in the data set to account for biological variation. The
combinations with all replicates identified as outliers were excluded from the data set and the
IDentif.AI analysis was repeated.
IDentif.AI analysis yielded both drug-drug interaction plots and optimized drug
combinations. The optimized drug combinations were ranked according to corresponding
%Inhibition from the correlated second-order quadratic series with the %Cytotoxicity of the celllines (Vero E6, AC16, and THLE-2) serving as qualitative indicators for consideration. The
predictive power was also calculated via adjusted R2 to establish the robustness of IDentif.AI
optimization considering the number of drug and drug-drug interaction terms. Correlation
coefficients were derived from the experimental output values and projected output values for the
corresponding drug combinations.

Statistical Analysis
All experiments were performed in at least triplicate biological repeats with data presented
as means ± standard deviation (SD), unless otherwise stated. Shapiro-Wilk normality test was
used to determine if samples were from normally distributed populations. Variance equality was
tested with Bartlett’s test. The Kruskal-Wallis test by ranks was used for multiple comparisons,
followed by Dunn’s post hoc test for pairwise comparisons. Student’s two-tailed t test and
Wilcoxon rank sum test were used for comparing individual samples from normally and nonnormally distributed populations, respectively. Bonferroni post-hoc correction was applied to
account for multiple comparisons. Statistical analyses for coefficient estimation in the IDentif.AI
analyses were performed using sum of squares F-test. Alongside the P-values, the results were
interpreted in the light of logic, background knowledge and the specifics of the experimental
design (16).

RESULTS

Monotherapy Assessment and OACD Dataset Construction
A pool of drug candidates was first chosen and evaluated for downstream IDentif.AI
analysis and drug combination optimization. The pool of candidate therapies for IDentif.AI-driven
optimization contained eleven drugs that were hypothesized to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 viral infection
via affecting: viral entry into the host cell - CQ, HCQ, AZT, LST, TEC; viral replication – RTV, LPV;
viral RNA synthesis - RDV, FPV, RBV; viral release - OSV-P (17-20). To create combinations
actionable within the current clinical guidelines we aimed to investigate drug interaction space
between the antiviral and concomitant medications. The last drug added to the pool, DEX, has
been discussed for preventing and treating acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) resulting
from COVID-19 (21), NCT04325061. LST is a common hypertension drug whose dosing should
not be paused while undergoing COVID-19 treatment (22). TEC is a wide spectrum antibiotic
prescribed for pulmonary infections, potentially including those occurring as COVID-19-related
complications (23).
IDentif.AI interrogates drug-dose relationships in order to identify the most efficacious drug
combinations within a defined drug concentration range. With the ultimate goal of clinical
implementation, drug-dose response experiments were performed within concentration ranges
that accounted for clinically implemented concentrations and avoided clinically unrealistic drug
concentrations. The drugs with and without the addition of 100 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 virus were
incubated with primate kidney cell line Vero E6 for 72h before measuring inhibition and cytotoxicity
and generating the dose-response curves (Fig. S1).
Only high concentrations (>1 µM) of RDV, LPV, CQ and HCQ achieved half maximal
absolute effective concentration (EC50) for the viral inhibition within the tested concentration
ranges. High concentrations (>20 µM) of RTV, LPV and CQ led to half maximal absolute cytotoxic

concentration (CC50) within the tested concentration ranges (Table 1). These results indicated low
cellular effects of the selected monotherapies at the tested concentrations. No effect of the
maximum vehicle concentration (0.1% DMSO) was detected on viral inhibition or on cytotoxicity
(Student’s t-test, n = 12, P > 0.05). The EC50 and CC50 of HCQ, CQ, RDV, FPV, and RBV were
different from previously reported values, attributable to differences in the experimental conditions
(e.g. SARS-CoV-2 strain, assays, incubation periods) (24, 25). Because a common source of
failure in translating in vitro results to clinical trials, including for coronaviruses, is the high ratio of
EC50 to maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) achieved in the human body, Cmax was included
as a crucial consideration for selecting drug concentrations at Level 1 and Level 2 for each drug
that ensure none of the drugs were overrepresented in relation to other drugs and to human
pharmacokinetics (Table 1, Supplemental Results) (26). Regardless of the monotherapy antiviral
activity, all drugs were considered for the combinatorial optimization process in order to identify
possible unpredictable drug interactions that could markedly impact treatment efficacy and safety.

cytotoxic activity on Vero E6 cells. Drug combinations’ cytotoxicity was additionally tested on
human cell lines: liver (THLE-2), and cardiac myocytes (AC16). No effect of the maximum vehicle
concentration (0.006% DMSO) was detected on viral inhibition or on cell cytotoxicity (Wilcoxon
rank-sum test, n = 18, P > 0.05).

IDentif.AI Analysis and Drug Combination Optimization
Utilizing the single drug and OACD drug treatment data, IDentif.AI analysis determined
RDV/RTV/LPV to be the most efficacious 3-drug combination. It was also present in all top 10
ranked 4-drug combinations. RDV/LPV was the top ranked 2-drug combination (Table 2). While
RDV was identified as the most efficacious single drug, in line with current clinical trial outcomes,
IDentif.AI analysis determined that the 3-drug combination of RDV/RTV/LPV is critical for
achieving maximal therapeutic efficacy. IDentif.AI analysis allows for comparative ranking of all
possible combinations within the 12-drug set, including analysis of regimens currently being
clinically investigated but that are not observed as top ranked optimized drug combinations. Both
LPV/RTV (Kaletra) and HCQ/AZT have been clinically evaluated as potential treatments against
SARS-CoV-2 infection with discouraging outcomes. IDentif.AI analysis of these combinations
revealed that they were identified to be sub-optimal - LPV/RTV ranked 1261 and HCQ/AZT ranked
5161 amongst all 9968 drug combinations that include up to 4-drugs, and predicted viral inhibition
efficacies of 23% and 2%, respectively. The aforementioned findings were based on the IDentif.AI
quadratic series assessing the %Inhibition experimental data with a close proximity as indicated
by adjusted R2 of 0.898 (Table S2).
Multi-parameter IDentif.AI analysis allowed cytotoxicity of ranked combinations to be
interrogated as well via deriving %Cytotoxicity quadratic series (Table S3-S5). The top ranked 3and 4-drug RDV-based combinations were determined to have similar %Cytotoxicity in the Vero
E6 cells in and experimentally measured single drug RDV treatments. IDentif.AI analysis also
determined low %Cytotoxicity for the top 3-drug combination, RDV/RTV/LPV in the AC16 cells

and higher %Cytotoxicity in the THLE-2 cells. This IDentif.AI-derived THLE-2 %Cytotoxicity was
predicted to decrease with the addition of DEX in the top 4-drug combination (Table 2). Outlier
analysis performed for each IDentif.AI quadratic series (Fig. S2-S5) identified and excluded
OACD combination 15 from the AC16 %Cytotoxicity data set (Fig. S4) and combination 46 from
the THLE-2 %Cytotoxicity data set (Fig. S5). These data sets were subsequently re-analyzed
(Fig. S6-S7). Taken together, IDentif.AI identified RDV-based treatments as likely the most
effective therapies against SARS-CoV-2 infections, with RDV/RTV/LPV capable of achieving
maximal efficacy with potential reductions in overall toxicity if complemented with the fourth drug.

Experimental Validation of IDentif.AI Results
Validation results were interpreted considering not only the P-values, but also the logic,
background knowledge and specifics of the experimental design (16). The studies confirmed
IDentif.AI ranking of RDV in combination with LPV and RTV as the optimal combination of the
study, resulting in complete viral inhibition (Fig. 2A, Table S6). This combination resulted in a 6.5fold increase in efficacy compared to RDV alone. RDV was confirmed as an essential driver of
the antiviral efficacy in the optimized combinations, even though it mediated only moderate
antiviral effect on its own. These validation studies were conducted following IDentif.AI
identification of top-ranked optimized RDV-based drug combinations and comparative ranking of
these combinations against other possible combinations.
LPV and RTV are commonly administered together as RTV acts as a pharmacokinetic
enhancer of LPV. Of note, the high antiviral effects of RDV/RTV/LPV were sustained when the
RTV concentration was decreased 20-fold, and the RTV/LPV concentrations reflected the
standard 100/400mg bid dosing in its clinically administered formulation (Kaletra). As such,
RDV/RTV/LPV combination likely does not require increasing RTV dose beyond what is
commonly used clinically and is readily clinically actionable upon an approval. Importantly,
RTV/LPV synergistic effects were limited to antiviral inhibition and did not adversely affect RDV
cytotoxicity. RDV’s cytotoxicity, also reported clinically (27), was not enhanced in any of the
combinations (Fig. 2B). In fact, the results suggest that RDV/RTV/LPV may suppress RDVinduced cytotoxicity both on human cardiac myocytes and human liver cell lines, with this effect
being strengthened when combining with concomitant drugs, DEX and TEC. Monkey kidney cells
did not exhibit cytotoxicity after any of the treatments. While these data suggest that specific topranked RDV-based combinations may also lower RDV-induced cytotoxicity, this observation
requires further investigation. Dose limiting and drug exclusion experiments further deciphered
the contribution of each drug towards overall RDV/RTV/LPV antiviral activity. RDV was confirmed
to have the greatest contribution, with LPV/RTV on its own not mediating viral inhibition. High

concentrations of LPV were critical to maximizing the RDV/RTV/LPV antiviral activity. While the
concentration of RTV was not a critical determinant of the resulting efficacy of the combination,
the presence RTV was critical to RDV/ RTV/LPV achieving maximal viral inhibition. Further
confirming the accuracy of IDentif.AI analysis, validation of currently clinically trialed treatments
against COVID-19, LPV/RTV (Kaletra)(1), HCQ/AZT (39, 40), FPV (NCT04310228) and CQ
(NCT04362332) did not induce as much viral inhibition as compared to RDV alone. These data
confirm that IDentif.AI can accurately reflect the unsatisfactory outcomes observed in those
clinical trials, without incorporating any prior clinical data or drug mechanism assumptions as
input.

Drug-drug interaction analysis of IDentif.AI results were also compared to experimental
observations and known clinical investigations. %Inhibition IDentif.AI response surface plot
mirrored well-documented and experimentally confirmed synergy between RTV and LPV (Fig.
3A). In contrast, IDentif.AI identified an antagonistic interaction between RTV and OSV-P (Fig.
3B), a combination that is currently being investigated in clinical trials (NCT04303299).
Combining RDV with LPV only, which to our knowledge has not been explored clinically as a
registered trial, doubled their individual viral inhibition when added together. Accordingly, the
corresponding %Inhibition IDentif.AI response surface plot identified a previously unknown
synergistic interaction between RDV and LPV (Fig. 3C). Further confirming IDentif.AI rankings
and validation experiments, the RDV/RTV interaction was not significant, but when given in 3drug combination, RTV boosted the RDV/LPV interaction almost two times (Fig. 3D). These
results further highlight the ability of IDentif.AI to leverage unexpected drug-dose interactions to
identify optimal drug combinations from a massive drug-dose search space.

DISCUSSION
This study harnessed the IDentif.AI platform to interrogate a 12 drug-dose parameter
space against the SARS-CoV-2 live virus to develop actionable and optimized combination
therapy regimens. IDentif.AI implementation addresses several important factors when designing
multi-drug regimens that are best suited for clinical translation from in vitro validation, especially
under urgent scenarios like COVID-19. Importantly, IDentif.AI considers the critical need for
simultaneous reconciliation of drug composition and dosing within combination therapy design.
MOA-based drug selection alone followed by dose finding, while an established method of
combination therapy design, presents substantial barriers to the optimization process since drug
dosing also plays a role in determining which drugs belong in an ideal combination. In lieu of
validating a small number of MOA-based potential drug combinations for efficacy which is

17

commonly observed in traditional workflows, IDentif.AI takes an MOA-agnostic approach to
efficiently analyze crowdsourced therapeutic responses to the live virus following expansive drugdose exposure to both outline the drug-dose space and define resulting drug-dose compositions
of the optimal regimens (41). With this data, IDentif.AI is able to leverage on unexpected dosedependent drug interactions to mediate improved treatment outcomes over MOA-based drug
selection followed by dose finding.
Another critical aspect of IDentif.AI is that the in vitro drug dosing parameter space
interrogated in this study is a departure from traditional drug screening approaches. In traditional
drug screening, compounds that do not elicit at least a low micromolar EC50 treatment response
during drug dose-response evaluations are typically removed from further consideration, thereby
markedly reducing the number of candidate therapies and possible drug combinations. The
removal of these drug candidates is a key driver of sub-optimal treatment responses as it ignores
a broad spectrum of potential combinations that can be assessed. Lack of monotherapy efficacy
does not preclude the use of these drug candidates from IDentif.AI’s combinatorial search space.
Instead, IDentif.AI’s approach allows for continued evaluation of these drugs to determine if they
are vital toward driving previously unknown drug interactions that optimize combinatorial
treatment outcomes. In addition to being observed in this study, this phenomenon has also been
observed with our prior clinical studies in chronic infectious diseases and blood and solid cancers,
among other indications (5, 8, 9, 42).
The outcome of applying IDentif.AI towards combating SARS-CoV-2 infection is an
extensive list of combinations ranked by efficacy and/or safety that can be queried by a clinician
based on clinically actionable criteria. These include, but are not limited to: highest ranked 2-, 3-,
4-drug combinations by efficacy; highest ranked combinations that do not contain certain drugs
due to supply shortages; highest ranked combinations that do not contain certain drugs or contain
lower dosages of certain drugs due to patient co-morbidities; and highest ranked combination
comprised of only approved therapies, among others. In the context of optimized regimen design,

which assesses regimen performance from the entire landscape of possible drug/dose
parameters, IDentif.AI-enabled comparative evaluation of the relative efficacy of a broad spectrum
of optimized regimens and clinically investigated regimens also independently confirmed the
reported outcomes of clinical trials. This provides additional support for the potential application
of IDentif.AI as a clinical decision support platform. For example, the relatively low efficacy
exhibited HCQ alone (3.9%) or by HCQ and AZT (3% inhibition) in this study aligned with recent
reporting of clinical outcomes for this drug given in mono- and combinatory therapy (39, 40). The
relatively low efficacy (3.9% and 5.2%) of RTV and LPV combination when assessed by IDentif.AI
at two different dosing ratios also aligned with recently reported outcomes showing no benefit
over standard care (1). IDentif.AI also revealed a relatively low efficacy of FPV monotherapy
(1.9% inhibition) and various combinations. This was consistent with clinical findings of FPV being
potentially clinically effective only when administered with interferon-alpha, not included within our
drug library (43). Of note, RDV alone resulted in the highest relative efficacy for monotherapy
(15.5%) in this study. To date, compassionate use of RDV resulted in clinical improvement of 68%
of the patients, and a larger study resulted in a statistically significant improvement in median time
to recovery from 15 days to 11 days (4). At the same time, an RDV study in severe COVID-19
patients was also recently terminated early (NCT04257656). Nonetheless, it has received FDA
authorization for emergency use in severe COVID-19 patients. The substantial difference in
efficacy observed between sub-optimal and optimal regimens highlights the importance of
leveraging platforms such as IDentif.AI to systematically design combination therapies. This
capability, along with the potentially predictive capacity of IDentif.AI for clinical trial outcomes
could provide clinicians with an expanded arsenal of evidence-based candidate treatments and
important insights into which potential treatments to further evaluate or potentially avoid under
time-sensitive circumstances.
It is important to note that the results reported here are derived from primarily an in vitro
SARS-CoV-2 study. Further clinical validation of the outlined combinations in randomized
19

controlled trials will be needed. It should also be noted that, while RDV did not mediate a
significant clinical benefit in severe COVID-19 patients, its efficacy in patients with varying disease
burden severities should be evaluated further. Furthermore, the mixed reported clinical outcomes
support the need for improved regimen design of RDV-based treatment. In the event of
downstream clinical validation of IDentif.AI-designed combinations, the drug dosage ratios within
the combination may vary from those pinpointed by IDentif.AI. In addition, it is possible that the
optimal drug combinations may vary between patients due to their severity of infection,
comorbidities, and other factors. It is for these reasons that potential downstream trials may be
effective at determining the potential clinical benefit of the IDentif.AI-designed combinations if the
enrolled patients are stratified by these aforementioned clinical parameters. The 12-drug search
set used in this study did not include every therapeutic option currently under clinical investigation.
Additional studies, including other repurposed compounds, may yield additional highly ranked and
effective combination regimens. Also, as IDentif.AI can be applied to novel small molecules and
antibody therapies, their inclusion into the drug pool would add further insight into other potentially
actionable regimens. Furthermore, given the rapid mutagenicity of RNA viruses like SARS-CoV2, future studies with different drug candidates and different SARS-CoV-2 strains may yield
different combinations. However, the efficiency and deterministic nature of IDentif.AI allows it to
derive a ranked list of optimal regimens from a given set of drug candidates against a defined in
vitro infectious disease model within two weeks. This further supports its potential application as
a clinical decision support platform for the optimized design of combination therapy regimens
against multiple SARS-CoV-2 strains as well as future unknown pathogens that will again require
rapid mobilization and clinical guidance for effective treatment options.
