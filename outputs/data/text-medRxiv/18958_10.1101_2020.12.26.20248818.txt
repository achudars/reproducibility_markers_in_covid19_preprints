Abstract
We developed a mathematical model to quantify the number of tests required to stop the spread
of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Our model analyses performed using the data from the
U.S. suggest that the infection coefficient increases by approximately 47% upon relaxing the
lockdown policy. To offset the effect of lockdown relaxation, the number of tests should increase
by 2.25 times, corresponding to approximately 280,000â€“360,000 tests per day in April 2020.

The lack of vaccines has led to the adoption of non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as case
isolation and contact tracing, as public health measures for containing the transmission of

coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (1). However, syndromic surveillance devoted to
identifying symptomatic people will unlikely be sufficient for stopping transmissions because a
substantial number of transmissions are attributed to asymptomatic cases (2, 3). Therefore,
identifying asymptomatic transmitters, who may escape syndromic surveillance, is critical to
controlling the spread of COVID-19. Here, we propose a mathematical model that can provide
insights on the number of tests required to identify infectious people and stop them from
spreading COVID-19.

Assumptions and Modeling
A substantial number of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 do not develop symptoms; thus, it
would be significantly challenging to quantify the total number of infected people in real time.
Therefore, rather than using classic SIR and SEIR models, we developed a mathematical model
that includes the number of tests and confirmed cases, whose quantification and comparison with
the data is more straightforward.
A well-known epidemic model can be modified as follows:

denotes the proportion of infected people detected through testing and isolated such that they
cease to be infectious per unit time.
Cases are confirmed by testing people suspected of COVID-19 infection. Assuming that
symptoms are exponentially distributed for the people who are suspected of infection and tested,
we obtain the following relationship between C and the proportion of population tested per unit
time T:

The results obtained using the estimation strategy described in Supplementary Material are
summarized in Table 1. For all the dates, the parameter estimates were statistically significant,
except the coefficient estimates that corresponded to the dummy variables (ld) of the lockdown
order for the early dates. However, the effect of the lockdown order became apparent from April
11, 2020, with statistical significance. The signs of all the estimates were in line with our
expectations. The magnitudes of the change in the parameter estimates were negligible. Notably,

Î± , A , B , and ld were estimated to be approximately 0.43, â€“0.08, 0.385, and â€“0.12, respectively.
However, the parameter estimates may not significantly vary unless unanticipated events occur.
Figure 1 shows the estimation results of Î· and T * obtained using the above-mentioned estimation
results. The red and blue lines indicate Î· and T * , respectively. The value of Î· ranges between
4.667 and 5.687, indicating that even if the lockdown order is enforced, the number of tests
conducted daily must be at least approximately 5.7 times the number of daily confirmed cases, to
prevent the spread. This means that the number of tests required to prevent the spread should
have been, on average, more than approximately 150,000, in April.

Figure 2 shows the estimation results of Îµ and â€². Considering the structural change that takes

effect after the lockdown order, we denote the new spread coefficient as â€² to distinguish it from
the original . The estimates of Îµ and â€² were substantially stable with negligible variability. The
mean value of Îµ is 2.34 and that of â€² is 0.478.

Discussion
For decision makers, an important question is "How many tests are required to prevent the

spread when the lockdown order is relaxed?" We estimated that if the current lockdown is
relaxed, the number of tests required to stop the further spread of COVID-19 would be at least
2.25 times the number of tests conducted under lockdown. In other words, if the lockdown order
was relaxed on April 20, 280,000â€“360,000 people have been daily tested to prevent the further
spread of COVID-19 in the U.S.
Although both the U.S. and South Korea confirmed their first COVID-19 cases on January 20,
2020, the number of infections in the U.S. has exceeded 2 million, whereas South Korea has
flattened its epidemic curve since April (4, 5). One of the key features behind the flattening of
the curve in Korea is that it adopted early measures including large-scale testing and contact
tracing that significantly suppressed the outbreak (6).
The limitations of our model and estimation, such as strong mathematical assumptions and the
endogeneity of the number of tests, would be interesting topics for follow-up studies.
Furthermore, some of subsequent studies may extend our model to complete epidemic models by
including hospitalization and recovery. Despite this, our study provides quantified evidence to
the public policy regarding resource allocation for suppressing the spread of COVID-19. In the
circumstance that many countries have gradually relaxed social distancing only with the
expectation for herd immunity to be built-up, this study is believed to help policy-makers
develop policy tools for the relaxation through the increase in the number of testing (7).
Although the optimal number of testing is different across countries, the figures estimated in this
study are expected to pave the road for suppressing the spread of COVID-19 (8).
In summary, we present a trade-off relationship between social distancing and mass testing,
suggesting the additional mass-testing of at least 2.25 times in the case of the relaxation of
social-distancing norms in the U.S. These approaches can disseminate the information regarding

the decisions made by public health bodies of other countries, especially those planning to relax
lockdown norms, thereby enabling both the selective adoption of policies that have proved
effective in curtailing the spread of COVID-19 and additional mass testing.
