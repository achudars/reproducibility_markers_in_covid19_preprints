ABSTRACT
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown high efficacy of multiple vaccines against
SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19), and recent studies have shown the vaccines are also
effective against infection. Evidence for the effect of each of these vaccines on ability to transmit
the virus is also beginning to emerge. We describe an approach to estimate these vaccines’
effects on viral positivity, a prevalence measure which under the reasonable assumption that
vaccinated individuals who become infected are no more infectious than unvaccinated
individuals forms a lower bound on efficacy against transmission. Specifically, we recommend
separate analysis of positive tests triggered by symptoms (usually the primary outcome) and
cross-sectional prevalence of positive tests obtained regardless of symptoms. The odds ratio of
carriage for vaccine vs. placebo provides an unbiased estimate of vaccine effectiveness against
viral positivity, under certain assumptions, and we show through simulations that likely
departures from these assumptions will only modestly bias this estimate. Applying this approach
to published data from the RCT of the Moderna vaccine, we estimate that one dose of vaccine
reduces the potential for transmission by at least 61%, possibly considerably more. We describe
how these approaches can be translated into observational studies of vaccine effectiveness.

INTRODUCTION
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown high efficacy of multiple vaccines against
SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19) [1–6], and recent studies have shown the vaccines are also
effective against infection [7,8]. Evidence for the effect of each of these vaccines on ability to
transmit the virus is also beginning to emerge [9–11].
It is important to understand the effect of vaccination on infection, shedding and transmission of
the virus [12]. This information can inform personal decisions about resuming contact once one
has been vaccinated (or one’s contact has), prioritization decisions [13], models of the effect of
vaccination [14], and policy [15].
Hypothetically, it is possible that the 60-95% protection offered by these vaccines [1–5,16]
against symptomatic disease could (i) be purely protection against symptoms with no effect on
infection or transmission (or increased transmission due to decreased case detection), (ii) be
largely or entirely due to protection against infection, suggesting an effect on transmission
similar to the efficacy against symptomatic infection; or (iii) be 70-95% protective against
infection and moreover reduce the shedding of virus by those who do become infected, in which
case protection against transmission could be even greater than that against symptomatic
disease. The primary endpoint of RCTs to date, however, sheds little light on the magnitude of
protection the vaccines could offer against transmission.
The effect of a vaccine on transmission is a composite of its effect on becoming infected
(because someone not infected cannot transmit) and its effect on the infectiousness of those
who get infected despite vaccination [11]: these components have been called the vaccine
efficacy for susceptibility to infection and vaccine efficacy for infectiousness [17]. Under
plausible assumptions, the efficacy of a vaccine in preventing transmission can be defined as:
𝑉𝐸! = 1 − (1 − 𝑉𝐸" )(1 − 𝑉𝐸# ).

(1)

where 𝑉𝐸" and 𝑉𝐸# are the vaccine efficacy against susceptibility (acquiring viral infection) and
against infectiousness, respectively [17,18].
RCTs of the Moderna, Astra-Zeneca, and Janssen vaccines have provided some evidence
about vaccine effects on the probability that a trial participant will harbor detectable virus by
swabbing participants irrespective of symptoms at one or more time points during the trial and
testing the swabs by RT-PCR to detect virus [2,16,19]. News reports indicate that those still in
placebo-controlled trials will provide ongoing samples that can yield similar data over time [20].
In each case, reduced prevalence of viral positivity in vaccine vs. placebo recipients may be
interpreted as a reduction in acquisition or duration or both, with potentially direct relevance to
transmission. However, some reports from the original trials present composite measures
involving infections detected by screening of non-symptomatic individuals combined with those
detected by swabbing of symptomatic individuals [6].
Here we describe the results of simulations of randomized trials that are designed to clarify what
information is gained by swabbing individuals for viral infection, how this relates to other
measures of vaccine efficacy, and what information is present in measures combining different
reasons for sampling (no symptoms vs. symptoms).

We first show that the vaccine effect on viral positivity (𝑉𝐸$ ) in individuals swabbed at random,
regardless of symptoms (i.e. the prevalence odds of those testing positive for viral RNA
(equation 4)), is closely approximated by a vaccine efficacy measure previously defined for
bacterial carriage, despite several departures from the assumptions underlying the prior work
[21]. This measure captures the product of the vaccine’s efficacy in reducing acquisition and its
effect in shortening infection duration. We describe how these departures affect the estimates
under varying trial conditions. We show that under the reasonable assumption that vaccinated
individuals who become infected are no more infectious during their duration of viral shedding
than unvaccinated individuals, 𝑉𝐸$ is a lower bound on the vaccine’s efficacy against
transmission. We recommend that samples taken to assess vaccine effects on viral positivity be
taken in a cross-section of the population (or, alternatively, in a cohort of contacts), irrespective
of symptoms, and that this outcome be analyzed separately from the outcome of a positive test
where the test was triggered by symptoms (the primary endpoint in most RCTs for SARS-CoV-2
vaccines).
METHODS
We simulate follow-up of 100,000 individuals for 300 days. For each person each day, we
conduct a Bernoulli trial to determine if they will be infected that day, with a probability based on
an external force of infection. We assume in our baseline simulations that this daily probability
remains constant at 0.001 and also examine a higher force of infection of 0.003 in a sensitivity
analysis. To examine the effects of deviations from the steady state assumption described in
prior work for estimating 𝑉𝐸$ [21], we compare scenarios in which individuals immediately
become susceptible again after recovery (“SEIS”) to scenarios in which prior infection confers
full protective immunity for the duration of follow-up (“SEIR”).
We vary the proportion of cases that are symptomatic (Table S1), with symptom onset occurring
five days after infection [22]. After a three day latent period [23], infected individuals shed virus
for a period drawn from a uniform distribution of 15-21 days [24,25]. While test sensitivity varies
by day of infection [26], we make the simplifying assumption that individuals will test positive on
any day they are shedding virus.
On day 100, after the population has reached a pseudo steady state for prevalence, we
randomize half of the individuals to receive a two-dose vaccine, with the doses given 28 days
apart. We conservatively assume the vaccine confers 50% of its full two-dose efficacy after the
first dose and that there is a seven day delay after each dose for immunity to take effect. We
model three types of vaccine efficacy (Table S1). First, the vaccine multiplies the probability of
infection each day by a factor 1 − 𝑉𝐸" . Second, the vaccine multiplies the duration of shedding
by a factor 1 − 𝑉𝐸% . Third, the vaccine multiplies progression to symptoms among those
infected by a factor 1 − 𝑉𝐸& . We calculate 𝑉𝐸& based on the value of 𝑉𝐸" and the assumption
that the vaccine reduces symptomatic disease by 95% (𝑉𝐸"& ) [1,2], using the equation:
𝑉𝐸"& = 1 − (1 − 𝑉𝐸" )(1 − 𝑉𝐸& ).

(2)

We then simulate testing and estimation of three measures of vaccine efficacy:
Vaccine efficacy for viral positivity (𝑉𝐸$ )

RESULTS
Table 1 summarizes the notation for various measures of vaccine efficacy studied here.
For a vaccine that reduces both incidence and duration of viral carriage, vaccine efficacy
against carriage can be interpreted as the product of these two effects.
Prior work (concerning a bacterial pathogen, though in this exposition we refer to the pathogen
as virus) showed that under certain assumptions, for a vaccine that reduces incidence but not
duration of infection, the reduction in incidence rate caused by the vaccine (termed in the
original paper the vaccine efficacy against acquisition [21], but which we call vaccine efficacy
against susceptibility to infection, for consistency with most of the literature [17]) can be defined
as
𝑉𝐸" = 1 −

where 𝑝8 and 𝑝7 are the prevalence of the virus in the placebo and vaccine arm respectively, so
the estimator is just one minus the odds ratio for carrying the pathogen for vaccine vs. placebo

again from the prevalence odds ratio for the vaccine, and now with effects on both duration and
incidence, we have the algebraic relationship
𝑉𝐸$ = 1 − (1 − 𝑉𝐸" )(1 − 𝑉𝐸% )
(7)
%

where 𝑉𝐸$ is defined in eq. 5, 𝑉𝐸" is defined in eq. 3, and 𝑉𝐸% = 1 − %! is the reduction in
"

average duration of viral positivity due to the vaccine. Thus, to generalize from reference [21],
𝑉𝐸$ is an upper bound on 𝑉𝐸" : 𝑉𝐸$ ≥ 𝑉𝐸" with equality for the special case where 𝑉𝐸% = 0.
𝑉𝐸$ is a lower bound on the vaccine’s efficacy against transmission, assuming that
vaccinated individuals who become infected are no more infectious than unvaccinated
individuals.
Equations 1 and 7 show that 𝑉𝐸$ and 𝑉𝐸! are similar though not identical; in particular, they
differ in only one term: the substitution of 𝑉𝐸% in the definition of 𝑉𝐸$ as opposed to 𝑉𝐸# in the
definition of 𝑉𝐸! . If vaccinated and unvaccinated virus-positive individuals contributed equally to
the force of infection, then these two terms would be identical, and we would have 𝑉𝐸$ = 𝑉𝐸! :
that is, the reduction in transmission thanks to the vaccine would be the combination of reduced
probability of infection and reduced duration of shedding in those infected despite vaccination. If
we assume that for every day of being virus positive, a vaccinated infected person is on average
no more infectious (and perhaps less due to lower viral loads) than an unvaccinated infected
person with the same exposure, then we can conclude that
𝑉𝐸$ ≤ 𝑉𝐸! .
(8)
Under this plausible assumption,𝑉𝐸! , which cannot be directly estimated from available trial
data, is at least as large as 𝑉𝐸$ , which can. We therefore proceed to discuss how to estimate
𝑉𝐸$ for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.
Simulated trials show that these estimators applied to a single cross-sectional swab
approximately recover the simulated effects of a vaccine on viral positivity, incorporating
effects on acquisition and duration, with visible downward bias just after and long after
vaccines are administered.
Fig. 1 shows results of 300-day simulations of a trial of 100,000 participants randomized 1:1 to
vaccine or placebo on day 100. These participants have been exposed to a constant incidence
of infection since day 0. The different panels represent (left to right) simulations with 𝑉𝐸" =
0,0.3,0.6.0.9 and (top to bottom) 𝑉𝐸% = 0,0.3,0.6.0.9. We simulate a 2-dose regimen, 28 days
apart with the first dose giving half the full efficacy and the effect of each dose starting one week
after it is given, that is, on days 107 and 135 of the simulation. Given the five day incubation
period, the vaccine’s effects on symptomatic infection will be observed beginning 12 days after
the vaccine dose. The solid black lines give the dose-1 and dose-2 predicted values for
+$ obtained from the simulated data
𝑉𝐸$ based on eq. 7, while the curves show the estimates 𝑉𝐸
using eq. 6. Fig. 1A shows the situation under the assumption that individuals naturally infected
who recover (clear infection) become once again susceptible to reinfection. This is unrealistic for
SARS-CoV-2 but follows the assumptions made in the above equations following [21]. Fig. 1B

makes the opposite assumption, that individuals naturally infected (whatever their vaccine
status) are completely protected against reinfection for the duration of the simulation.
In Fig. 1A, there is close agreement between the simulated curves and the predicted ones, after
about day 150. During the first-dose period, estimated efficacy is noisy at the beginning but is
typically below the predicted level, reflecting holdover of infections that occurred before
(randomization+7 days), which are by assumption therefore unaffected by the vaccine. In
contrast, toward the right-hand side of each panel, the agreement is nearly perfect apart from
sampling error, because such holdover infections are vanishingly rare and the assumptions
underlying eqs. 6 and 7 are met.
Fig. 1B shows a similar pattern, with the important exception that over time, as many individuals
in the population are immune, the protection estimated from eq. 6 declines toward the null
value. This is because both groups have fewer people at risk as immunity builds up, but when
the vaccine has an effect, the placebo group is depleted of susceptible individuals faster than
the vaccine group, rendering the two groups more similar and the apparent efficacy lower. This
effect, which is a known complexity of randomized [27–30] and observational [31,32] studies of
vaccine efficacy/effectiveness, is subtle in our primary analysis (Fig. 1B), but becomes more
pronounced when there are longer times of follow up, higher forces of infection (Fig. S1), and
greater heterogeneities in infection risk among the study population.
Separate analyses of infections detected by testing those with symptoms and infections
detected by testing cross sections of participants irrespective of symptoms improve
interpretability of VE estimates.
All trials of which we are aware for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have had a primary endpoint of
symptomatic disease, ascertained by asking every participant who experiences a defined profile
of symptoms to get tested, and counting the outcome of COVID-19 when such a test is positive.
As noted, some trials also test a subset of participants irrespective of symptoms, either at the
visit for the second vaccine dose [2] or at defined intervals during follow up [16]. The primary
endpoint measures vaccine efficacy against symptomatic infection, which has been called
𝑉𝐸"& for vaccine efficacy against susceptibility or progression (that is, protection from
symptomatic infection that could be preventing infection or preventing symptoms if an individual
becomes infected), and is related to 𝑉𝐸" and 𝑉𝐸& (Table 1) by eq. 2 above.
Fig. 2 shows simulations similar to those above, but now with a virus assumed to cause
symptoms in 1% (red) or 80% (blue) of infected individuals to demonstrate how the relationship

between 𝑉𝐸
$ and 𝑉𝐸1(,3;'45 depends on the proportion symptomatic. In these simulations, all
symptomatic individuals are assumed to be tested for the primary outcome on the day of
symptom onset, and all asymptomatic individuals are not tested for the primary outcome. In
addition, all individuals who have not yet experienced symptoms are tested for viral positivity
and the combined VE is estimated. When only 1% of infected individuals are symptomatic,

Application to Moderna data
Table 2 shows data from the published RCT of the Moderna vaccine [2], in which participants
returning for their second vaccine dose were tested by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2, with 39 and
15 testing positive without symptoms, respectively, in the placebo and vaccine group. If we
assume that everyone in the modified intent-to-treat population not infected prior to the second
dose was tested (this is not documented in the paper), this corresponds (Table 2) to an estimate
+$ = 1 − 0.39 = 0.61 (95% 𝐶𝐼 0.31, 0.79), by eq. 6. Taken at face value, this implies that one
of 𝑉𝐸
dose reduces virus positivity by 61%; our simulations suggest this may be an underestimate for
several reasons. First, this estimate only includes asymptomatic individuals. As Figure S2
shows, if only individuals not symptomatic at the time of swabbing were included, as in the
+$ because vaccinated
Moderna study, there could be additional underestimation of 𝑉𝐸
individuals without symptoms may disproportionately contribute to the non-symptomatic group.
To resolve this potential bias, the data could be reanalyzed to also include anyone who tested
positive on the day of the second dose and either was symptomatic or later became
symptomatic. A modest underestimate could also occur due to holdover of individuals infected
before the first dose took effect and still positive at the time of the second dose.
Finally, as noted above, one expects that 𝑉𝐸$ ≤ 𝑉𝐸! (eq.8), so we conclude that the Moderna
data from the second-dose swab provides evidence of at least a 61% (95% CI 31-79%)
reduction in transmissibility due to a single dose of Moderna vaccine.
The VE estimate combining cases ascertained by symptoms and those ascertained by this
testing protocol in Table S18 of [2] is 89.5% (85.1%-92.8%). As described above, this combined
6
measure is an underestimate of the 𝑉𝐸
"& estimated in the study of 94.1% (89.3-96.8%).
DISCUSSION
We have shown that if analyzed correctly, data from randomized trials that test a cross-section
of vaccine and control recipients irrespective of symptoms on a given day for virus can estimate
the vaccine efficacy against viral positivity. While a complete estimate of 𝑉𝐸! would require
estimates of both 𝑉𝐸$ and of the daily infectiousness of a vaccinated, infected individual
compared to an unvaccinated, infected one, and their correlation across individuals, it is very
likely in practice that 𝑉𝐸$ is a lower bound on 𝑉𝐸! : that is, an estimate from trial data of
𝑉𝐸$ provides strong evidence that 𝑉𝐸! is at least as high.
Our main findings are as follows: first, that a single cross-sectional comparison of PCR positivity
odds between individuals in vaccine vs. control groups provides a relatively accurate estimate,
subject to sampling error, of vaccine effectiveness against viral positivity, which is a composite
of effects in reducing susceptibility to infection and in reducing duration as described in Eq. 7.
This can be shown analytically under certain assumptions. Second, we show by simulation that
plausible deviations from these assumptions do not dramatically change results and, when they
do, tend to bias toward the null hypothesis of no efficacy. A combined analysis of viral positivity
detected due to symptoms and those detected by routine screening of non-symptomatic
persons will be some combination of efficacy against viral positivity 𝑉𝐸$ and against

symptomatic infection 𝑉𝐸"& with no clear interpretation in terms of elementary quantities of
interest. Thus separate analysis is recommended. Finally, if the cross-sectional sampling is
restricted to those who are not symptomatic, it may underestimate 𝑉𝐸$ , especially for vaccines
which are highly protective against symptoms (high 𝑉𝐸& ) .We therefore recommend that the
cross-sectional sample include those who are symptomatic. If this is infeasible (for example, if
individuals are instructed not to come for a vaccine dose if they are symptomatic, and the
testing happens at the vaccine dose), then we recommend that those who are tested because
they are symptomatic and test positive on a particular day be included among the positives in
the cross-section, constituting a partial exception to our recommendation of separate analyses.
Our results have been described in the setting of a randomized trial. These results apply also to
observational studies as well insofar as they are designed to mimic a target trial [34] and
achieve adequate control of confounding and other sources of bias.
In observational studies of vaccine effectiveness to date, cases have often been identified in
whoever gets tested, for whatever reason [7,35,36]. These probably constitute a mix of (i) those
tested because symptomatic, (ii) those tested because they are contacts of a known or
suspected case (for example in a contact tracing investigation), and (iii) those tested without
either reason, for example those who get tested in a regular program by their employer or those
who get tested to comply with a travel restriction that requires a negative test before travel.
Those positive in group (i) are approximately equivalent, in the observational setting, to those
who meet the primary outcome of confirmed COVID-19 from randomized trials. Those positive
in group (iii) are perhaps equivalent, in the observational setting, to those who test positive in
the routine follow-up of persons in a randomized trial. Group (ii) does not have a clear
equivalent in the randomized trials, which typically do not gather information on contacts.
For observational studies, our results therefore imply that it would be ideal to analyze
symptomatic cases separately from those routinely tested, and if possible to distinguish those
tested due to possible exposure (group ii) from those tested for other reasons, such as for travel
clearance (group iii). Those tested because they are symptomatic (group i) should be analyzed
analogously to the trials, as the reduction in incidence rate. Those tested for exposure (group ii)
are a group in which the efficacy measure is conditioned on exposure, and thus should be
analyzed using methods to estimate the secondary attack rate, a risk measure. These
recommendations follow standard approaches described in the landmark paper of Halloran et
al. 1997 [37]. And those tested for neither reason (group iii) should be analyzed using the odds
ratio approach described in this paper, extending others’ prior work [21].
We have not considered another approach that has been used in COVID-19 trials [19] to
estimate the effect on asymptomatic infections: serologic testing of participants at the middle or
end of the trial [30]. This can contribute to an estimate of𝑉𝐸" and thus provide a lower bound on
𝑉𝐸! , but does not address the duration of infectiousness or the viral shedding of the detected
asymptomatic infection. Nevertheless, this is an important additional way to obtain evidence
relevant to bounding the vaccine’s efficacy against transmission.
In summary, with careful analysis, data from swabs of individuals in vaccine and comparator
arms can yield estimates of a key quantity, the vaccine’s efficacy in reducing viral positivity,
likely a lower bound on the vaccine’s efficacy in reducing transmission. Future work should

test positive may further refine these estimates.

Figure 1. Vaccine efficacy for viral positivity
Results are shown of a 300-day simulation of a trial of 100,000 participants randomized 1:1 to
vaccine or placebo on day 100 and exposed to a constant force of infection of 0.001 throughout
the simulation. The different panels represent (left to right) simulations with 𝑉𝐸" =
0,0.3,0.6.0.9 and (top to bottom) 𝑉𝐸% = 0,0.3,0.6.0.9. We simulate a 2-dose regimen, 28 days
apart with the first dose giving half the full efficacy and the effect of each dose starting one week
after it is given, that is, on days 107 and 135 of the simulation. The solid black lines give the
dose-1 and dose-2 predicted values for 𝑉𝐸$ based on eq. 7, while the curves show the estimates
obtained from the simulated data using eq. 6. Panel A shows the situation under the assumption
that individuals naturally infected who recover (clear infection) become once again susceptible
to reinfection (SEIS). Panel B makes the opposite assumption, that individuals naturally infected
(whatever their vaccine status) are completely protected against reinfection for the duration of
the simulation (SEIR).

Figure 2. Vaccine efficacy for viral positivity and a combination of symptoms and testing
This figure shows the same simulations as Figure 1B with different analyses of the simulated
data, comparing scenarios in which 1% and 80% of unvaccinated infections are symptomatic.
The solid black lines give the dose-1 and dose-2 predicted values for 𝑉𝐸$ based on eq. 7, while
the solid curves show the estimates obtained from the simulated data using eq. 6 (the solid red
line is the same as Figure 1B). The dashed lines give the dose-1 and dose-2 predicted values
for 𝑉𝐸"& , based on equation 2, while the dashed curves show the estimates of
𝑉𝐸1(,30'45 obtained from the simulated data. When only 1% of infected individuals are
symptomatic, the solid red and dashed red lines are nearly identical. However, when 80% are
symptomatic [33], the dashed blue line increases over time but falls below the expected 𝑉𝐸"& .

Supplement
Figure S1. Vaccine efficacy for viral positivity with higher force of infection
This figure shows the same analysis as Figure 1 for a scenario with a constant force of infection
of 0.003 (three times higher than the baseline scenario) throughout the simulation. The solid
black lines give the dose-1 and dose-2 predicted values for 𝑉𝐸$ based on eq. 7, while the
curves show the estimates obtained from the simulated data using eq. 6. Panel A shows the
situation under the assumption that individuals naturally infected who recover (clear infection)
become once again susceptible to reinfection (SEIS). Panel B makes the opposite assumption,
that individuals naturally infected (whatever their vaccine status) are completely protected
against reinfection for the duration of the simulation (SEIR).
