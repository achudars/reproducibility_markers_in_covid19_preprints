ABSTRACT
Background:
The coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic is a global public health crisis, with over 1.6
million cases and 95,000 deaths worldwide. Data are needed regarding the clinical
course of hospitalized patients, particularly in the United States.
Methods
Demographic, clinical, and outcomes data for patients admitted to five Mount Sinai
Health System hospitals with confirmed Covid-19 between February 27 and April 2,
2020 were identified through institutional electronic health records. We conducted a
descriptive study of patients who had in-hospital mortality or were discharged alive.
Results
A total of 2,199 patients with Covid-19 were hospitalized during the study period. As of
April 2nd, 1,121 (51%) patients remained hospitalized, and 1,078 (49%) completed their
hospital course. Of the latter, the overall mortality was 29%, and 36% required intensive
care. The median age was 65 years overall and 75 years in those who died. Preexisting conditions were present in 65% of those who died and 46% of those
discharged. In those who died, the admission median lymphocyte percentage was
11.7%, D-dimer was 2.4 ug/ml, C-reactive protein was 162 mg/L, and procalcitonin was
0.44 ng/mL. In those discharged, the admission median lymphocyte percentage was
16.6%, D-dimer was 0.93 ug/ml, C-reactive protein was 79 mg/L, and procalcitonin was
0.09 ng/mL.
Conclusions
This is the largest and most diverse case series of hospitalized patients with Covid-19 in
the United States to date. Requirement of intensive care and mortality were high.
Patients who died typically had pre-existing conditions and severe perturbations in
inflammatory markers.

INTRODUCTION
The Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has held the world at a standstill with its
virulence. As of April 8, 2020, over 1.6 million people have been affected, and more
than 95,000 patients have died worldwide1. In addition to being highly contagious, the
disease manifestations and clinical course are variable, spanning from asymptomatic
status to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome with multiorgan failure and
death2.
Reports from China and Italy provided early data on disease presentation and
management3,4 but also revealed varying geographic disease expressions. Over onefourth of the world’s cases are now in the United States (US), with more than a third of
all US cases ascertained in New York state alone, making it the current epicenter of the
Covid-19 pandemic5.
As the number of cases continues to climb, hospitals are being stretched well-beyond
capacity while facing challenges of insufficient personal protective equipment (PPE),
ventilators, and workforce. Thus, understanding the clinical course of hospitalized
Covid-19 patients is critical not only for providing optimal patient care but also to inform
resource management in other locations across the US likely to experience similar case
surges6.
The Mount Sinai Healthcare System (MSHS) is the largest academic health system in
New York City and serves as an ideal platform to better understand the evolving
landscape of Covid-19 across a diverse population. Here, we present the largest case
series of patients hospitalized with laboratory confirmed Covid-19 to date in the US.
METHODS
Study Population
The MSHS serves a large, racially and ethnically diverse patient population. In this
study, patient data came from 5 major hospitals: the Mount Sinai Hospital located in
East Harlem, Manhattan; Mount Sinai Morningside located in Morningside Heights,
Manhattan; Mount Sinai West located in Midtown and the West Side, Manhattan; Mount
Sinai Brooklyn located in Midwood, Brooklyn; and Mount Sinai Queens located in
Astoria, Queens. We included patients who were at least 18 years old, had a laboratoryconfirmed Covid-19 infection, and were admitted to any of the aforementioned 5 MSHS
hospitals between February 27 and 12 a.m. April 2, 2020 (time of data freeze). A
confirmed case of Covid-19 was defined by a positive reverse transcriptase polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of a specimen collected via nasopharyngeal swab. The
Mount Sinai Institutional Review Board approved this research under a broad regulatory
protocol allowing for analysis of limited patient-level data.

The dataset was obtained from different sources and aggregated by the New York
Covid Informatics Taskforce (NYCIT) (Further description of NYCIT is provided in
Supplementary Material). We obtained demographics, diagnosis codes (International
Classification of Diseases-9/10-Clinical Modification (ICD-9/10-CM) codes and
procedures, as well as vital signs and laboratory measurements during hospitalization.
Demographics included age, sex, and language, as well as race and ethnicity in the
electronic health records. Racial groups included White, Black or African American,
Asian, Pacific Islander, Other, and Unknown. Ethnic groups included NonHispanic/Latino, Hispanic/Latino, or Unknown. All vital signs and laboratory values were
obtained as part of indicated clinical care.
Definitions of Pre-existing Conditions
We defined a pre-existing condition as the presence of diagnosis codes associated with
specific diseases. Diagnoses and corresponding ICD codes are provided in
Supplemental Table 1.
Definitions of Outcomes
We assessed in-hospital mortality and admission to intensive care.
Statistical Analysis
We used descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data; results are reported as
medians and interquartile ranges or means and standard deviations, as appropriate.
Categorical variables were summarized as counts and percentages. We visualized
length of stay (LOS) using a cumulative incidence function with competing risks for
mutually exclusive events of in-hospital mortality or discharge. Patients who were still
hospitalized at the time of data freeze were regarded as having a censored LOS. We
assumed censored observations from patients with ongoing hospitalization will not
exceed the longest LOS in our dataset when calculating the restricted mean LOS. No
imputation was made for missing data. Analysis was performed with R7.
RESULTS
A consort diagram of included patients and outcomes is depicted in Supplementary
Figure 1.
Demographic and Clinical Characteristics
From February 27 to April 2, 2020, 2,199 Covid-19 positive patients were hospitalized at
one of five MSHS New York City hospitals. At the time of writing this report, 1,121 (51%)
patients remained hospitalized and 1,078 (49%) completed their hospital course, with
768 discharges and 310 deaths. Figure 1 details the number of patients admitted to the
hospital per day and the total number of patients admitted cumulatively over time.
During the study period, the trend of hospital admissions per day consistently increased.
Patient demographics, pre-existing conditions as well as vital signs and laboratory
values at the time of admission are displayed in Table 1. Median age was 65 years with
only 3% of patients less than 30 years and 36% over 70 years. The proportion of men

was higher (59%) than women (41%) and 25% had their race identified as White, 25%
as African American, and 3% as Asian. One quarter of the population has their ethnicity
identified as Hispanic/Latino. More than half of the population had at least one preexisting condition. Specifically, 37% presented with a history of hypertension, 27% with
diabetes mellitus, 16% with coronary artery disease, 10% with heart failure and 9% with
chronic kidney disease.

Panel A: The number of total patients (n = 2,199) admitted each day to one of the
hospitals for the duration of the study period. Panel B: The number of patients
cumulatively admitted, cumulatively discharged, or still hospitalized by day.
Laboratory Results and Vital Signs at Presentation
Overall, 1,558 (71%) of patients were admitted through the emergency department. On
hospital admission, 39% of all patients were tachycardic and 25% of all patients were
febrile (Table 1). The median white blood cell count was 7 K/uL and lymphocyte
percentage was 13.8. The median serum creatinine was 1 mg/dL. Select inflammatory
markers performed in subsets of patients in accordance with clinical indication were
markedly elevated on admission (Table 1). Specifically, the median C-reactive protein
(CRP) was 110 mg/L, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was 416 U/L, and ferritin was 714
ng/L. Over one-quarter of patients (28%) had a procalcitonin level above 0.49 ng/mL,
and nearly half of patients (46%) had a procalcitonin level less than 0.15 ng/mL. The

median D-dimer was 1.31 ug/mL; one-third of patients (33%) had a D-dimer greater
than 2 ug/mL.
The frequencies of otherwise non-routine laboratory assessments ordered on day of
admission increased over time and are shown in Supplementary Figure 2. In contrast,
hemoglobin, a routinely measured clinical lab value, was ordered at admission in the
majority of patients without variation over the study period.
Clinical Outcomes
Due to the unknown future clinical course of those patients hospitalized at the time of
data freeze, below we present clinical characteristics of only those patients who had
completed their hospital course. A total of 1,078 Covid-19 confirmed hospitalized
patients completed their hospital course (died or discharged alive) by the date of data
freeze on April 02, 2020. Of these, 768 (71%) were discharged and 310 (29%) died in
the hospital. Estimates for mortality and need for ICU admissions over time are
displayed in Figure 2.
The median LOS was 7.7 days, accounting for censoring of patients with ongoing
hospitalization. By the mean LOS (10.5 days), 45% of patients had been discharged,
17% had died, and 38% were still hospitalized (Figure 2). Demographics and admission
laboratory measurements for patients who completed their hospital course are
displayed in Table 2, stratified by mortality. The median age was 75 years in those who
died and 59 in those who were discharged. Pre-existing conditions were present in 64%
of those who died and 46% of those discharged. Among those who died, 45% had
hypertension, 34% had type 2 diabetes, 27% had coronary artery disease, 21% had
heart failure and 13% had chronic kidney disease. In patients who were discharged,
30% had hypertension, 20% had type 2 diabetes, 11% had coronary artery disease, 7%
had heart failure and 7% had chronic kidney disease.
We present key laboratory markers at the time of hospital admission in subsets of
patients for whom they were measured. In patients who died, the median lymphocyte
percentage was 11.7%, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 58.5 U/L, CRP was 162
mg/L, D-dimer was 2.41 ug/mL (56% had a D-dimer >2 ug/mL), ferritin was 798 ng/L,
LDH was 517 U/L, creatinine kinase (CK) was 472 U/L and procalcitonin was 0.44
ng/mL (49% had a procalcitonin >0.49 ng/mL). In patients who were discharged, the
median lymphocyte percentage was 16.6%, AST was 36 U/L, CRP was 79.3 mg/L, Ddimer was 0.93 ug/mL (21% had a D-dimer >2 ug/mL), ferritin was 509 ng/L, LDH was
347 U/L, CK was 154 U/L and procalcitonin was 0.09 ng/mL (12% had a procalcitonin
>0.49 ng/mL).

Figure 2: Cumulative incidence function displays the probability of mutually exclusive
events of discharge (blue) or death (red) by a given day of hospitalization, accounting
for the changing number of patients at risk including censoring. The remaining portion
(white) shows patients that are still hospitalized, where the median length of stay is 7.7
days.

Patients Requiring ICU Admission
Of the 1,078 patients who completed their hospital course, 385 (36%) required intensive
care during their hospital stay. For these patients, vital signs and laboratory values
immediately before transfer to intensive care are displayed in Table 3, stratified by
mortality outcome. Among patients who died, 38% were tachycardic and 22% were
hypotensive. Among patients who were eventually discharged, 19% were tachycardic
and 4% were hypotensive. In patients who died, the median lymphocyte percentage
was 9.6%, serum creatinine was 1.5 mg/dL, AST was 62 U/L, CRP was 220 mg/L,
ferritin 920 ng/L, procalcitonin was 1.02 ng/mL (59% had a procalcitonin >0.49 ng/mL),
LDH was 513 U/L, CK was 659 U/L and D-dimer was 2.7 ug/mL (63% had a D-dimer >2
ug/mL). Among patients who were discharged, the median lymphocyte percentage was
16.6%, serum creatinine was 0.8 mg/dL, AST was 35 U/L, CRP was 75.6 mg/L, ferritin
503 ng/L, procalcitonin was 0.08 ng/mL (10% had a procalcitonin >0.49 ng/mL), LDH
was 333 U/L, CK was 146 U/L and D-dimer was 0.83 ug/mL (22% had a D-dimer >2
ug/mL).

DISCUSSION
The Covid-19 pandemic represents the greatest public health emergency in the modern
world. Limited data, especially in the US, exists to guide clinical care, resource
management, and risk stratification in hospitalized patients. To the best of our
knowledge, our study is the largest and most diverse case series of patients reported
with confirmed Covid-19 in the US. Previous reports were either from other countries,
examined smaller cohorts, or were focused on critically ill patients4,8–13 The present
report provides a broad perspective on patients admitted with Covid-19 in both general
medicine ward and intensive care settings. Additionally, our health system serves a
unique population representative of the ethnic and socioeconomic diversity seen in both
New York City and across the United States.
.

We highlight several key findings. Among the 1,078 patients who completed their
hospital course (discharge or in-hospital death), the overall mortality rate was 29% and
31% in patients who received ICU care. The overall case fatality rate likely represents
an overestimation of the true disease mortality rate since patients who remained
hospitalized at the date of data freeze were not included in this calculation. The
mortality rate in intensive care is lower than previously described4,13–15. and may be
reflective of early care escalation or the larger number of patients in our study.
Though no formal comparisons were made, we observed that patients who died had a
higher median age and a greater frequency of male sex with more pre-existing
conditions than those who were discharged. Though 25% of patients were febrile on
admission, this may be an underestimation due to possible antipyretic use and/or
selection bias. A substantial proportion of patients with Covid-19 displayed abnormal
laboratory measurements at the time of admission. These included lymphopenia and
elevated inflammatory markers such as D-dimer, CRP, LDH, and ferritin. These trends
persisted among those who died and/or received intensive care, both on admission and
at the time of ICU transfer. If formal epidemiologic analyses confirm these observations,
early laboratory evaluation may be crucial in identifying patients suspected for Covid-19
prior to RT-PCR test result. It may also aid clinicians in identifying patients at high risk of
decompensation, ICU admission, and potentially even death. Early identification of highrisk patients could enable timely patient triage and improved resource allocation.
Additional work is needed to develop real-time, accurate predictive models for risk
stratification in Covid-19, particularly to elucidate the clinical utility of specific laboratory
measurements.
Han et al. found a significant association of serum lactate dehydrogenase and creactive protein with Covid-19 severity in patients from China16. As the number of cases
rose quickly in New York City, MSHS hospitals served as early adopters, creating a
Covid-19 order set in our EHR to streamline objective data gathering, facilitate more
cohesive workflow amongst team members, and minimize ancillary staff exposure by
completing all necessary admission labs at one time. This laboratory order set included
serum D-dimer, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, ferritin, and lactate dehydrogenase. In
turn, we observed an increase in these orders from the first day of admission over the

study period (Supplementary Figure 2). Given the abnormalities observed in patients
who died, these laboratory measurements may be prognostic markers of disease
severity or subsequent clinical course, although this requires further investigation. If
confirmed, other health systems expecting impending case surges may consider similar
workflows to promote improved healthcare delivery to affected patients.
Our study should be considered in light of several limitations. Since Covid-19 testing is
frequently repeated in hospitalized patients and initial testing may result in false
negatives, we are unable to determine whether patients developed their infection during
or before hospital admission. Furthermore, Covid-19 has a variable incubation period of
approximately 8-15 days17, and patients may present to the hospital several days after
initial infection or the onset of symptoms. Thus, we are unable to determine patients’
disease duration. Additionally, we separated discharged patients from those who died,
but some patients may have expired after discharge. This could affect our listed case
mortality rate. Our study is also confined by the inherent limitations (e.g. biases) of EHR
data. Although utilizing structured EHR data allows for rapid integration of multiple data
streams and real-time analysis, data present only in clinical note text, such as
symptoms on presentation are missed. We chose not to perform comprehensive
manual chart review to prioritize timely dissemination of our observations.
As the Covid-19 pandemic spreads from the current epicenter in New York City to other
areas, our report provides meaningful clinical insights that may better inform care for
diverse populations. Future work will aim to predict Covid-19 patient outcomes using a
variety of approaches, thereby reducing healthcare system burden and permitting
improved care delivery.

Baseline values are defined as first values on hospitalization. All continuous characteristics
are in Median (Interquartile Range) unless specified otherwise and all categorical characteristics
are in number (percentage). The percentage is calculated with the number of patients who had
the characteristic available as the denominator. For further clarity, the number in which that
characteristic was available for is provided separately in adjacent column.
