Abstract
Introduction
The recovery of other respiratory viruses in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection has
been reported, either at the time of a SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis (co-infection) or
subsequently (superinfection). However, data on the prevalence, microbiology and
outcomes of co-infection and super infection are limited. The purpose of this study was
to examine occurrence of respiratory co-infections and superinfections and their
outcomes among patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

We searched literature databases for studies published from October 1, 2019, through
June 11, 2020. We included studies that reported clinical features and outcomes of coinfection or super-infection of SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens in hospitalized and
non-hospitalized patients. We followed PRISMA guidelines and we registered the
protocol with PROSPERO as: CRD42020189763.

Results
Of 1310 articles screened, 48 were included in the random effects meta-analysis. The
pooled prevalence of co-infection was 12% (95% confidence interval (CI): 6%-18%,
n=29, I2=98%) and that of super-infection was 14% (95% CI: 9%-21%, n=18, I2=97%).
Pooled prevalence of pathogen type stratified by co- or super-infection: viral coinfections, 4% (95% CI: 2%-7%); viral super-infections, 2% (95% CI: 0%-7%); bacterial
co-infections, 4% (95% CI: 1%-8%); bacterial super-infections, 6% (95% CI: 2%-11%);
fungal co-infections, 4% (95% CI: 1%-8%); and fungal super-infections, 4% (95% CI:
0%-11%). Compared to those with co-infections, patients with super-infections had a
higher prevalence of mechanical ventilation [21% (95% CI: 13%-31%) vs. 7% (95% CI:
2%-15%)] and greater average length of hospital stay [mean=12.5 days, standard
deviation (SD) =5.3 vs. mean=10.2 days, SD= 6.7].

Conclusions
Our study showed that as many as 14% of patients with COVID-19 have superinfections and 12% have co-infections. Poor outcomes were associated with superinfections. Our findings have implications for diagnostic testing and therapeutics,
particularly in the upcoming respiratory virus season in the Northern Hemisphere.

Introduction
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is associated with high morbidity
and mortality.(1, 2) Current evidence shows that transmission of severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19,
happens primarily through respiratory droplets (3, 4) from symptomatic, asymptomatic
or pre-symptomatic individuals.(4, 5) Similar to other respiratory pathogens such as
influenza, where approximately 25% of older patients get secondary bacterial
infections,(6, 7) both super-infections and co-infections with SARS Cov-2 have been
reported.(8-10) However, little data is available on the magnitude of co-infection and
super-infections by viral, bacterial and fungal infections and associated clinical
outcomes among patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.(8-10)
We define co-infection as the recovery of other respiratory pathogens in patients with
SARS-CoV-2 infection at the time of a SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis and superinfection as the subsequent recovery of other respiratory pathogens during care for
patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.
Two previous reviews have focused on this topic and examined the prevalence of
bacterial and fungal co-infection or super-infection in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.(11,
12) We extended this work by distinguishing between super- and co-infection because
of the different implications of co-infections vs super-infections. For example, Garcia-Vidal
et. al., showed that SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with superinfections had longer LOS and
higher mortality while those with co-infections were had a higher frequency of admission to the
ICU.(13) In addition, we examined the impact of co-infections vs. super-infections on

clinical outcomes such as average length of hospital stay (LOS).

Diagnostic testing and therapeutic decision making may be affected by the presence of
co-infection or super-infection with SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens.
Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine occurrence
of and outcomes of respiratory co-infections and super-infections among SARS-CoV-2.

Materials and methods
We conducted this systematic review in accordance with the Preferred Reporting in
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.(14) We registered this
review with PROSPERO: CRD42020189763.(15) The protocol is available as a
support document (S1. File).

Data Sources and Searches
With the help of a health sciences librarian (LC), we searched PubMed, Scopus, Wiley,
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science Core Collection, and
CINAHL Plus databases to identify English-language studies published from October 1,
2019 through June 11, 2020. We executed the search in PubMed and translated the
keywords and controlled vocabulary for the other databases and additional articles were
added from reference lists of pertinent articles. The following key words were used for
the search: “coronavirus”,”coronavirus infections”, “HCoV”, “nCoV”, “Covid” “SARS”,
"COVID-19", “2019 nCoV”, “nCoV 19”, “SARS-CoV-2”, “SARS coronavirus2”, “2019

Study Selection
Citations were uploaded into Covidence®, an online systematic review software for the
study selection process. Two authors (JSM and LW) independently screened titles and
abstracts and read the full texts to assess if they met the inclusion criteria. The authors
met and discussed any articles where there was conflict and decided to either include or
exclude such articles. Inclusion criteria were randomized clinical trials (RCTs), quasiexperimental and observational human studies that reported clinical features and
outcomes of co-infection or super-infection of SARS-CoV-2 (laboratory confirmed) and
other pathogens—fungal, bacterial or other viruses in hospitalized and non-hospitalized
patients. We excluded studies that did not report co-infection or super-infection,
editorials, reviews, qualitative studies, those published in non- English language,
articles where full texts were not available, and non-peer reviewed preprints.

Data Extraction and risk of bias assessment
Three reviewers (JSM, LW, and VP) independently abstracted data from individual
studies using a standardized template. We abstracted data on: study
design/methodology, location and setting (intensive care unit (ICU), inpatient non-ICU,
or outpatient, where applicable), study population, proportion of patients with coinfections, implicated pathogens, method of detection of co-infections and superinfections (laboratory verified or clinical features only), type of infection— bacterial, viral
or fungal, outcomes of co-infected patients— death, ICU admission, mechanical

ventilation, discharge disposition, length of hospital stay, or mild illness. Discrepancies
were resolved by discussion between the three abstractors.
Risk of bias assessment was conducted by two authors (JSM and LW) independently.
We used a tool developed in 2018 by Murad et al.(16) This tool examines four domains:
selection, ascertainment, causality and reporting. The selection domain helps to assess
whether participants included in a study are representative of the entire population from
which they arise. Ascertainment assesses whether the exposure and outcome were
adequately ascertained. Causality assesses the potential for alternative explanations
and specifically for our study whether the follow-up was long enough for outcomes to
occur. Reporting evaluates if a study described participants in sufficient detail to allow
for replication of the findings. This tool consists of 8 items, but only five were applicable
to our study.(16) When an item was present in a study, a score of 1 was assigned and 0
if the item was missing. We added the scores (minimum of 0 and a maximum of 5) and
assigned the risk of bias as follows: low risk (5), medium risk (3-4), high risk (0-2).
Details of the risk of bias assessment are provided as supporting information (S1 Table)

Data Synthesis and Analysis
The primary outcome was the prevalence of co-infections or super-infections by viral,
bacterial and fungal respiratory infections and SARS-CoV-2. We examined whether coinfection or super-infection was associated with an increased risk for the following
patient outcomes: 1) mechanical ventilation, 2) admission to the ICU, and 3) mortality.
We estimated the proportion of patients with co-infection or super-infection of viral,
bacterial and fungal respiratory infections and SARS-CoV-2. We anticipated a high-level
of heterogeneity given the novelty of COVID-19 and potential differences in testing and

management of COVID-19 in the healthcare systems of the countries where the studies
were conducted. We conducted all statistical analyses using Stata software, version
16.0 (Stata Corp. College Station, Texas). We used the “metan” and “metaprop”
commands in Stata to estimate the pooled proportion of co-infection and super-infection
and COVID-19 using a random effects model (DerSimonian Laird).(17, 18) We
stabilized the variance using the Freeman-Tukey arcsine transformation methodology in
order to correctly estimate extreme proportions (i.e., those close to 0% or 100%).(17)
We assessed heterogeneity using the I2 statistic. Frequencies of outcome variables and
study characteristics were estimated using descriptive statistics. For example, in studies
where data on co-infecting or super-infecting pathogens was reported, we extracted and
tallied the number of different pathogens reported. We calculated the proportion of
pathogens using the number of pathogens as the numerator and the total number of
pathogen type (bacteria, viruses and fungi) from all the studies as the denominator.
We did not assess for publication bias because standard methods such as funnel plots
and associated tests were developed for comparative studies and therefore do not
produce reliable results for meta-analysis of proportions.(19, 20)

RESULTS
Our search yielded 1840 records; we excluded 530 duplicates and screened 1310
articles. At the abstract and title review, we excluded 1231 articles leaving 79 articles for
full text review. Of these, 48 articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in this
meta-analysis. The most frequent reason for exclusion of studies at the full text review
was the absence of super-infection or co-infection data (Figure 1).

Most studies were case series (31/48). There were 14 retrospective cohort studies, 2
prospective cohorts and 1 RCT.(21) This RCT was a drug trial but also reported coinfection or super-infection data in patients with SARS-CoV-2. Sixty percent of the
studies were conducted in China while 15% (7/48) were from the USA. Most of the
studies were conducted in a mixed setting i.e., ICU and non-ICU setting (75% or 36/48),
92% (44/48) were conducted exclusively in hospitalized patients, and the majority were
conducted among adults (71% or 34/48). Nineteen studies (48%) of the included studies
in this review reported that patients included had super-infections, while co-infections
were reported in 70% (30/43) of the studies. Viral co-infections in patients were
reported in 74% (31/42) of the included studies, bacterial in 54% (26/48), fungal in 22%
(8/37) of the studies. Seventy-three percent (27/37) of the studies reported at least one
causative organism of the co-infection or super-infection (Table 1).

The pooled prevalence of co-infection was 12% (95% confidence interval (CI): 6%-18%,
n=29, I2=98%). The highest prevalence of co-infection was observed among non-ICU
patients as 28% (95% CI: 6%-56%), while it was 10% (95% CI: 5%-16%) among
combined ICU and non-ICU patients, and 3% (95% CI: 0%- 1%) among only ICU coinfected patients (Figure 2). The pooled prevalence of super-infection was 14% (95%
CI: 9%-21%), with the highest prevalence of 17% (95% CI: 1%-43%) among ICU
patients (Figure 3).
Pooled prevalence of pathogen type stratified by co- or super-infection was: viral coinfections, 4% (95% CI: 2%-7%); viral super-infections, 2% (95% CI: 0%-7%); bacterial
co-infections, 4% (95% CI: 1%-8%); bacterial super-infections, 6% (95% CI: 2%-11%);
fungal co-infections, 4% (95% CI: 1%-8%); and fungal super-infections, 4% (95% CI:
0%-11%) (S1 Fig, S2 Fig, S3 Fig).

Twenty-nine studies reported data on specific organisms associated with co-infection or
super-infection in COVID-19 patients (Table 2). Among those with co-infections, the
three most frequently identified bacteria were Streptococcus pneumoniae (17.9%),
Klebsiella pneumoniae (16.7%) and Haemophilus influenza (12.4%). The three most
frequently identified viruses among co-infected patients were influenza type A (8.1%),
Rhinovirus (6.3%) and non-SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses (3.7%). For fungi, only Candida
sp. (0.7%) and Mucor sp. (0.7%) were identified among those co-infected.
Among those with super-infections, the three most frequently identified bacteria were
Acinetobacter spp. (22%), Escherichia coli (18%) and Pseudomonas (16%). For

viruses, only Human metapneumovirus (4%) was identified among those superinfections and for fungi only Candida sp. (14%) was identified.
Two studies reported both super-infections and co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 for the
same population.(22, 23) These warrant further mention. In Zhang G et. al., superinfections were due to bacterial respiratory infections and 25% (14/55) of the patients
had severe disease. Stratification by disease severity for mortality was not reported for
these super-infected patients. Co-infections were due to non-specified viruses and of
those patients, 29% (16/55) had severe COVID-19. In Dong et. al., one (1/11) patient
had both a bacterial super-infection and viral co-infection with severe COVID-19.
The overall prevalence of comorbidities was 45% (95% CI: 33%-56%). Among those
with co-infections the prevalence of comorbidities was 38% (95% CI: 24%-53%), while it
was 54% (95% CI: 35%-72%) among those who were super-infected.
COVID-19 patients with a co-infection or super-infection had higher odds of dying than
those who only had COVID-19 infection, but this was not statistically significant (odds
ratio [OR] 2.59, 95% CI: 0.83-8.09). Subgroup analysis of mortality showed similar
results where the odds of death were higher among patients who were co-infected and
those who were super-infected, but the findings were not statistically significant, OR
1.96: (95% CI: 0.62-6.2) and OR 3.2: (95% CI: 0.54-18.3), respectively. There was a
higher prevalence of mechanical ventilation among patients with super-infections, 21%
(95% CI: 13%-31%) compared to those with co-infections, 7% (95% CI: 2%-15%).
Twenty-five studies reported data on average LOS. The average LOS for co-infected
patients was 10.2 days, standard deviation (SD) = 6.7, while the average LOS for superinfected patients was 12.5 days, SD=5.3. None of the studies included in this meta-

analysis reported data on discharge disposition and readmissions. There was
asymmetry of the funnel plot which suggests publication bias (S3 Fig).

Risk of bias assessment
Forty-seven percent (23/48) of studies were rated as having low risk of bias, 50%
(24/48) as having medium risk of bias and 1 study was rated as having a high risk of
bias (24) (S1 Table).

DISCUSSION
We found that 12% of SARS-CoV-2 patients were co-infected with other pathogens and
the prevalence of co-infection was higher among patients who were not in the ICU
(28%). We also found a higher prevalence of super-infection compared to co-infection
(14%), particularly among ICU patients (17%). Further, we found that super-infected
patients had a higher prevalence of mechanical ventilation, ICU admission and
comorbidities. Super-infected patients had higher odds of death, although this was not
statistically significant.
Two previous reviews that have focused on this question found similar prevalence of
bacterial co-infection in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients of 7% - 8% and viral co-infection
of 3%.(11, 12) We extended this work by distinguishing between super- and co-infection
because of the different implications of co-infections vs super-infections. In particular,
bacterial and other pathogens have been shown to complicate viral pneumonia and lead
to poor outcomes.(25)

The three most frequently identified bacteria among co-infected patients in our study
were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenza.
Streptococcus pneumoniae is a frequent cause of super-infection in other respiratory
infections like influenza.(26) A study by Zhu et al. showed similar results,(27) and
Lansbury et al. showed that Klebsiella pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenza were
some of the most frequent bacterial co-infecting pathogens identified in their review.(11)
As expected, Staphylococcus aureus also was present in a sizeable number of cases.
The most frequent bacteria identified in super-infected patients was Acinetobacter spp.,
which is a common infection especially in ventilated patients.(28)

In our study, the three most frequently identified viruses among co-infected patients
were Influenza type A, Rhinovirus and non-SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses. These findings
are important particularly for influenza because testing constraints continue to exist, yet
clinical presentation of influenza and SARS-CoV-2 is similar. There are major infection
control and clinical implications of missing SARS-CoV-2 or influenza if co-infection is not
considered, and diagnostic testing for both pathogens is not undertaken. The only
identified virus among patients with super-infections was Human metapneumovirus
(hMPV). This may have clinical implications as both viruses— hMPV and SARS-CoV2—share poor prognosis-associated factors such as advanced age and being
immunocompromised.(29, 30)
Our findings have implications for infection preventionists, clinicians and laboratory
leaders. While it is not possible to predict with certainty how the upcoming respiratory
virus season will unfold, it is likely that we will be dealing with a multitude of viruses

circulating simultaneously. Respiratory virus diagnostic testing protocols should take
into account that co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 is not infrequent and therefore viral
panel testing may be advisable in patients with compatible symptoms. Treatment
protocols should also include assessing for co-infections, particularly influenza, so that
appropriate treatment for both SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza can be administered.
Our study has limitations. We were not able to assess important outcomes such as
discharge disposition and hospital readmissions due to lack of availability of this data in
the included studies. We were not able to document time to super-infection as included
studies did not report this information. Studies provided the number of patients with
super-infections without stating the exact time when this determination was made after
SARS-COV-2 diagnosis. Most of the studies included in the meta-analysis were case
series with their inherent limitations.(31) It is possible that some of the pathogens that
were reported as super-infections or secondary infections were present but not tested
for at admission and hence were co-infections. It was not possible to assess this from
the studies. There was significant heterogeneity in the studies, as was anticipated given
the variation in settings, patient populations and diagnostic testing platforms across the
studies.

CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, our study shows that as many as 14% patients with COVID-19 have
super-infections and 12% have co-infections. Poor outcomes were associated with
super-infections. Our results have implications for diagnostic testing, laboratory and
antibiotic stewardship, particularly with the upcoming respiratory virus season in the fall.
