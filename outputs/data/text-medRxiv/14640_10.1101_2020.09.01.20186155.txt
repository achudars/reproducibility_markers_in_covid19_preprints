Abstract

37

Background. The first case of SARS-CoV-2 in Basel, Switzerland was detected on February 26th

38

2020. We present a phylogenetic study to explore viral introduction and evolution during the

39

exponential early phase of the local COVID-19 outbreak from February 26th until March 23rd.

40

Methods. We sequenced SARS-CoV-2 naso-oropharyngeal swabs from positive 746 tests that were

41

performed at the University Hospital Basel in the timeframe of our study. We successfully generated

42

468 high quality genomes from unique patients and called variants with our COVID-19 Pipeline

43

(COVGAP). We analysed viral genetic diversity using PANGOLIN taxonomic lineages. To identify

44

introduction and dissemination events we incorporated global SARS-CoV-2 genomes and inferred a

45

time-calibrated phylogeny. We used epidemiological data to aid interpretation of phylogenetic

46

patterns.

47

Findings. The early outbreak in Basel was dominated by lineage B.1 (83·6%), detected from March

48

2nd, although the first lineage identified was B.1.1. Within B.1, a clade defined by the SNP C15324T

49

contains 68·2% of our samples (‘Basel cluster’), including 157 identical sequences at the root of the

50

‘Basel cluster’, suggesting local spreading events. We infer the origin of the ‘Basel cluster’ defining

51

mutation to mid-February in our tri-national region. The remaining genomes map broadly over the

52

global phylogenetic tree, evidencing several events of introduction from and/or dissemination to other

53

regions of the world via travellers. We also observe family transmission events.

54

Interpretation. A single lineage variant dominated the outbreak in the City of Basel while other

55

lineages such as the first (B1.1) did not propagate. We identify mass gathering events and less so

56

travel returners and family transmission as causes for the local outbreak. We highlight the importance

57

of adding specific questions to the epidemiological questionnaires that are collected, to obtain data on

58

attendance of large gathering events and locations as well as travel history to effectively identify

59

routes of transmissions in up-coming outbreaks. This phylogenetic analysis enriches epidemiological

60

and contact tracing data, allowing, even retrospectively, connection of seemingly unconnected events,

61

and can inform public health interventions.

Introduction

64

The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly spread around the globe during the first six months of 2020.

65

The causative coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is the subject of many studies using genomic analysis

66

providing key insights into viral diversity across cities1, provinces2-5, countries6-11, and globally12.

67

SARS-CoV-2 has an estimated mutation rate of 0.71-1.40x10-3 13, which translates to 21-42 mutations

68

per year. Due to the accumulation of mutations, phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 is becoming

69

more granular over time14, providing increasing resolution of transmission dynamics and events.

70

Comparisons of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) allows us to explore transmission events

71

with highest resolution across communities. The identification of transmission routes is important,

72

especially with various public health measures being introduced, such as lockdown policies, which

73

have been implemented on country or regional levels to limit viral transmission. The impact of public

74

health measures can be monitored through phylogenies3. Genomic data can also deliver insights into

75

mutations and whether they alter virulence, or aid adaptation to novel hosts. The spike protein D614G

76

mutation, for example, has been implicated in more effective transmission15, although the actual

77

impact may be through fixation in an expanding lineage rather than conferring increased

78

transmissibility per se16.

79

The scope of this study is to provide a more granular picture of the phylogenetic diversification and

80

propagation of the early-stage SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on a local scale. The City of Basel has a

81

population of 175,350 inhabitants (median over the past five years) with half a million people in the

82

Basel area. Situated in North-Western Switzerland, directly bordering both Germany and France,

83

Basel has almost 34,000 workers commuting daily across the international borders17. Given this large

84

exchange of people in this tri-national region, the fact that the neighbouring region Alsace, France,

85

was already experiencing an intense epidemic18, and a low threshold testing strategy implemented

86

weeks before the first case, we aim to explore the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics

87

in Basel and the surrounding area from the first case to one week post border closure.

Characteristics of the longitudinal study

90

This cohort study includes all patient samples from Basel-City and the surrounding area during the

91

initial 26 days of the local outbreak, between February 26th and March 23rd. Only single, non-repeated

92

tests per patient were considered eligible for phylogenetic analysis. This timeframe covers the first

93

two positively tested cases in Basel on February 26th, which we were able to capture via early

94

implementation of PCR-based detection by routine diagnostics, until the date of border closure plus

95

seven days (March 23rd).

96

From the first case on February 26th 2020 until March 23rd we had performed 6,943 PCR tests. Of

97

these, 746 samples (10.7%) were SARS-CoV-2 positive (Figure 1). March 23rd had the maximum

98

number of positive tests, with 66 cases. Of all PCR tested patients and positively tested patients

99

during the study period, a majority were female with a median age of 42 and 49 years, respectively

100

(Table 1). Of the PCR-confirmed cases, only 17 (2.3%) were in patients younger than 18 years.

101

(Table 1, Figure S1). 418 (56%) were living in the canton of Basel-City (City of Basel, Riehen,

102

Bettingen) and 328 (44%) were from the surrounding area.

106

are depicted from the beginning of the outbreak in February to March 23, 2020. Major events and

107

108

were on February 25th and February 26th, respectively.

109

COVGAP pipeline validation

110

No false positive variants were called (Figure S4, Table 2, Table S1). Ambiguous mapping was

111

responsible for the failure to call the three indels, resulting in insufficient (<70%) coverage to be

112

reliably called as a variant. This validation allowed us to determine the specificity (100%), sensitivity

113

(94.2%), and accuracy (100%) of COVGAP, thus confirming its accuracy in SNP detection, as well as

114

its ability to call the majority of indels from short read data.

115

The COVGAP pipeline produced 468 (63%) high quality genomes for subsequent analysis, of the 746

116

samples taken. The remaining samples were either not available (N = 57), did not pass sequencing

117

quality control (N = 156), or were duplicates from the same patient (N = 65). These 468 samples are

118

subsequently referred to as the Basel area cohort. Of these, 240 (51.9%) were from female patients

119

(Table 1, Figure S1), and 12 (2.6%) were from patients younger than 18 years.

120

Phylogenetic lineages observed over time in the Basel area cohort

121

Over the 26-day study period, 13 out of 91 globally circulating phylogenetic lineages were recorded

122

in the Basel area; only one additional lineage was recorded in all Swiss sequences.

123

Lineage B.1 dominated the cases during the initial phase of the outbreak (Figure 2), with 83.6% (N =

124

391) of sequenced samples (Table 3), being recorded for the first time in Basel on March 2nd. The

125

first patient diagnosed at our hospital, on February 26th, had a virus belonging to lineage B.1.1. This

126

lineage is seen sporadically through the outbreak with a maximum of six sequenced cases from March

127

16th. Lineage B.1 is associated with the Italian outbreak14, yet both B.1.1 (35.7%) and B.1 (51.0%)

128

were the most prevalent lineages in Italy during this time span (Figure 3). From March 13th, rarer

129

lineages are seen in the Basel area, such as B.1.1.6, a lineage that is associated with an Austrian

130

origin14. Only two cases from the A lineage and sub-lineages were sequenced in the Basel area cohort

131

(Table 3).

132

Lineage diversity in Basel-City, Switzerland, and neighbouring countries

133

Comparison with lineages found in neighbouring countries over this period shows that lineage B.1

134

dominates in all, but the numbers of lineages identified, and the proportions vary (Figure 3).

135

Switzerland (77.1%) has a similarly large proportion of B.1 lineage to France (90.0%). We describe

136

the viral diversity based on abundance of lineages (retrieved from GISAID, for details see

137

Supplementary material) using a range of diversity indices (Table S5). Simpson diversity, which

138

accounts for differences in sample abundance between countries, was highest in Germany (3.87) and

139

Austria (3.73), followed by Italy (2.52); it was lowest in Switzerland (1.62) and France (1.23). The

140

share of our samples that originates from Basel-City residents (376 samples) excluding sequences that

141

were obtained from commuters mirrors the lineage proportions of Switzerland (Figure 3), while

142

contributing 56% of all available sequencing data for Switzerland within this timeframe (GISAID

143

database as of June 22nd,19,20).

153

that had confirmed COVID-19 cases on January 24th, followed by Germany on January 27th, Italy on

155

diversity based on the available genomes and PANGOLIN lineage assignments is largest in Germany

156

(3.87) and Austria (3.73), followed by Italy (2.52), it is smallest in Switzerland (1.62) and France

Switzerland’s sequence data.

159

Basel samples in global phylogenetic context

160

In order to better contextualize our findings, we analysed our virus genomes phylogenetically with a

161

subset of global publicly available sequences (see Supplementary material; Figure 4). While

162

phylogenetic lineages may show some geographical signal, lineages do not exclusively correspond to

163

continents (Figure 4A), illustrating the degree of global interconnectivity and speed of spreading. The

164

phylogenetic lineages recorded in the Basel area are distributed across the global phylogenetic tree

(Figure 4B). Mismatch of ‘taxonomic’ assignment and phylogenetic origin of genomes assigned to

166

B.1 can be seen, with several as yet unnamed sub-lineages apparent in the phylogeny (Figure 4B).

167

We can identify a major clade, within lineage B.1, comprising 68.2% of our samples (319/468

187

The first identified introduction of SARS-CoV-2 to Basel

188

The first two positively diagnosed patients with SARS-CoV-2 in Basel and first identified cases of

189

COVID-19, Patient 1 and Patient 2, travelled together to Italy. In our analysis, both Patient 1 and

190

Patient 2 carried viruses from the B.1.1 lineage, the second most prevalent lineage in Italy at that time

191

(Figure 3). Interestingly, the two virus genomes from Patient 1 and Patient 2 are separated by two

192

SNPs, suggesting two independent infections (Figure 5B). Moreover, we did not identify minor

193

alleles within these samples that would hint at double infection of the patients. In this case, the

194

epidemiological cluster of Patient 1 and Patient 2 is not congruent with the phylogenetic inference.

195

The virus genome of Patient 1 carried a synonymous mutation at C313T in ORF1ab, which is found

196

in samples from Israel, Hungary, Japan, USA, Argentina, Greece, India, Brazil, Morocco, and

197

Netherlands among others (nextstrain.org), all sharing an unsampled common ancestor that emerged

198

around February 25th (CI February 23-26th). This SNP is also found in ten other Basel area cohort

199

genomes: eight of these were from a family and social friends cluster unrelated to Patient 1 that were

200

diagnosed between March 13th and March 22nd.

201

The virus genome of Patient 2 carried a synonymous mutation at T19839C in ORF1ab and not

202

C313T, and clusters together with eight identical virus samples sampled between February 26th and

203

March 23rd. Two of these are from family members of Patient 2, who tested positive two and six days

204

later, suggesting a family route of infection. The epidemiological data of the other six patients

205

suggests no direct transmission via Patient 2. One of the six returned from a Swiss ski resort three

206

days prior to onset of symptoms. Two additional samples forming a family cluster (Family 1, Figure

207

5B) diagnosed on March 3rd, carried the T19839C plus non-synonymous mutation G28179A leading

208

to amino acid change ORF8-G96S. One member of Family 1 travelled with Patients 1 and 2 to Italy

209

and possibly got infected there with a yet different virus variant.

210

Introduction of the Basel cluster

211

The clade within lineage B.1, into which 68.2% (N = 319) of our Basel area cohort sequences fall, is

212

cluster, from March 2nd, was from a patient residing in Central Switzerland, who was transferred to a

215

care facility in Basel where six further people tested positive between March 5th and March 17th with

216

identical viral genomes. The source of the first infection is unknown. The second sample within the

217

Basel cluster was from a patient diagnosed on March 3rd, who had attended a religious event in

218

Alsace, France, that took place between February 17th and 21st. One other patient, who tested positive

219

on March 9th and had symptoms 14 days prior to testing, also attended this event.

220

Description of the Basel cluster

221

The 319 genomes in the Basel cluster (Figure 5A) show a divergence of up to five SNPs up until

222

March 23rd, although 157 genomes are identical and located at the root of the clade. This infers that

223

the common ancestor originated between February 9th and February 17th. That the clade defining SNP

224

C15324T (GISAID emerging clades label 20A/15324T) was registered globally for the first time on

225

March 2nd simultaneously in the Basel area sample 42173111 and GISAID sample

226

Germany/FrankfurtFFM7/2020 suggests unsampled circulation of this variant from mid-February. By

227

searching all genomes available on GISAID (N = 80,189; as of August 12th, 2020), filtering for

228

genomes belonging emerging clade 20A/15324 and sampled until March 23rd (N = 2,856), we find

229

that subsequently the C15324T mutation has also been observed in other countries but remains most

230

prevalent in Switzerland (NGISAID =57/213, 26.8%; NGISAID+this study = 386/675, 57.2%; first genome

231

42173111 from March 2nd) (Table S3). Of the 57 Swiss genomes with this mutation that were already

232

deposited on GISAID, 26 also originate from the cantons Basel-City and Basel-Landschaft (Table

233

S4). The mutation is also found in higher proportions in genomes from France (N = 69/369, 18.7%,

234

first from March 3rd sample France/HF1870/2020), Luxembourg (N = 24/116, 20.7%, from March 8th

235

sample Luxembourg/LNS2614631/2020), and Belgium (N = 40/268, 14.9%, from March 6th sample

236

Belgium/NKR-030645/2020), but date later than the first recorded occurrence from Switzerland and

237

Germany (Table S3). Subsequently, as of March 9th, descendants of this variant were recorded

238

outside Europe (Table S4) in smaller proportions than in Basel (Table S3), which suggests

239

dissemination from the Basel area.

252

Potential ski-holiday related cluster (C1059T)

253

Previous reports have identified viruses in lineage B.1 carrying SNP C1059T (amino acid change

254

ORF1a-T265I) in travel returners from ski holidays in Ischgl, Austria9,21. We detected 21 (4.5%) viral

255

samples within our cohort with these features (Figure 5C), divergent by up to two SNPs from the

256

common ancestor. Samples date from March 11th to March 23rd with an inferred internal node age of

257

February 21st (CI: February 20th-February 21st, 2020), fitting with possible infections in Ischgl from

258

end of February to March 13th 22. Epidemiological data confirms that five patients from that cluster

259

had returned from Austria, and three specifically from Ischgl, the fourth from Tyrol, before testing

260

positive. Two additional patients returned from skiing in Swiss ski resorts.

261

Spike protein mutation prevalent in Basel patients

262

The spike protein S-D614G mutation is associated with the B.1 lineage and all those derived from this

263

(Figure 4). As such, it occurs in 448 of the 468 (95.7%) samples from the Basel area. The SNP

264

responsible has not been lost once in our sub-sampled dataset, but it is not present in B.2 or B.3 or

265

other sister lineages to B.1 (Table 3). Among our samples, we found no significant difference in viral

266

loads between patients with and without the S-D614G mutation (z = -0.881, p = 0.38). However, our

267

cohort is biased to samples with higher viral load, as these were those that were successfully

268

sequenced.

269

Discussion

270

We reconstruct the early events focusing on introduction and spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Basel and the

271

surrounding area, Switzerland, from a phylogenetic perspective. We present COVGAP, a new

272

combination of existing tools to effectively and efficiently mine SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Illumina

273

paired end reads. Unlike other currently available tools23, COVGAP shows higher sensitivity levels in

274

SNP calling from raw reads (100%), failing only in ambiguously mapped deletions and insertions. In

275

such cases, it adopts a coverage-conservative approach, needed to reliably call variants in real world

276

scenarios.

277

The majority of genome variants in Basel are similar to those from France, Italy, and Germany. We

278

found the presence of 13 SARS-CoV-2 lineages in our samples, with the beginning of the Basel

279

outbreak being powered by the European B.1 lineage. In particular, a B.1 lineage variant with the

280

C15324T mutation dominated the early phase of the local spread with 70% of samples forming a large

281

Basel cluster. Compared to Victoria, Australia5, the UK24, or Austria (this study) the diversity seen

282

arriving in Switzerland and Basel as determined using Simpson diversity is more limited, reflecting

283

European rather than intercontinental connections. This diversity measure can be used to monitor viral

284

introductions as an effect of travel restrictions in the future.

285

The Basel cluster virus variant 20A/C15324T was first detected in Europe on March 2nd in Germany

286

and Switzerland simultaneously. We locate its geographic origin to our tri-national region between

287

February 9th and February 17th. Our epidemiologically-informed phylogenetic analysis indicates that

288

the Basel cluster represents a larger transmission chain that was unchecked and spread effectively

289

among unrelated people throughout Basel and eventually outside of Europe. The first recognized case

290

in the large Basel cluster goes back to a patient in a care facility, in which several more infections

291

occurred.

292
293

The beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak described here coincided with the winter school holidays in

294

Basel, from February 22nd to March 8th. During this time, many residents take the opportunity to

295

travel, in particular to skiing resorts. Viral introductions from ski resorts are known from contract

296

tracing data to have affected Germany25, Denmark21, Iceland9, France, Spain, and UK26, with Ischgl,

297

Austria being a described source of many cases. Our data supports the finding that skiing resorts in

298

Austria and Switzerland served as dissemination hotspots. This school holiday also provided the

299

opportunity for the first identified SARS-CoV-2 introductions to Basel through two jointly returned

300

travellers, notably each with different viral variants. Overall, however travel returners did not drive

301

the outbreak in Basel evidenced by the low diversity of variants and proportion of such variants in our

302

sample. A second likely source represents the many workers travelling daily across borders from

303

France and Germany, particularly from heavily affected areas such as Alsace18. As the B.1 and B.1.1

304

lineages were dominant in France and Germany, these may be some sources of cases and

305

transmissions.

306
307

The timing of the epidemic in Basel also coincided with three major events. Firstly, a religious event

308

from February 17th to 21st in Alsace that was described as a super-spreading event in France27. We

309

confirmed that the virus genomes of two patients known to have attended are indeed situated at the

310

root of the clade that constitutes the Basel outbreak. Secondly, carnival in the Basel area is celebrated

311

over several weeks from early January, with numerous events, and thousands of active participants.

312

The culmination is the UNESCO world-heritage ‘Basler Fasnacht’, scheduled this year (2020) for

313

March 2nd-4th, but cancelled due to COVID-19. Notably, the active participants practice the piccolo

314

and drums over weeks in closed rooms as a preparation for their performance during the carnival, and

315

unofficial events are likely to have taken place. Thirdly, Basel hosted three international soccer events

316

at the St. Jakob Stadium on February 15th (20,675 spectators), 23rd (20,265 spectators), and 27th

317

(14,428 spectators). All three major events fell around the inferred date of origin of the Basel

318

mutation C15324T and subsequent dissemination phase.

319
320

A limitation of the current study is that we are likely to have missed some cases as not all

321

symptomatic people were advised to be tested, especially children younger than 18 years old.

322

Nevertheless, our cohort represents a very high sequencing density per detected case for a city (468

323

genomes from 746 PCR-confirmed cases in Basel area (62.7%) and from 10,680 PCR-confirmed

324

cases nationwide (4.4%)) for this early phase of the pandemic28.

325
326

The availability and integration of epidemiological data in the interpretation of phylogenetic clades

327

underlines the validity of instrumentalising those tools for improving the understanding of SARS-

328

CoV-2 outbreak dynamics. Utilizing the clades as the backbone for targeted epidemiological analysis

329

of specific cases helped in grasping how mass gatherings, travel returners, and care facilities may

330

influence an outbreak within a city. The epidemiological data that was collected for the Federal Office

331

of Public Health (FOPH), as requested by law, helped tremendously to verify travel related links;

332

however it was not designed to obtain data on local super-spreading events such as attendance to

333

soccer games, visiting clubs, restaurants, bars, and concerts and future versions could be improved.

334

The classical epidemiological context is very important to further explain molecular epidemiological

335

links especially in a still not very diversified virus.

336
337

In conclusion, the start of the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in the Basel area was characterized by a

338

dominant variant, C15324T, within the B.1 lineage, which we infer to have arisen in mid-February in

339

our tri-national region. Large gatherings (potential super spreading events) could have had profound

340

effects on outbreak dynamics. Improved surveillance measures are needed in the management of an

341

outbreak, including large-scale, active screening in the broader public, including more children to

342

assess their role in transmission. Our analysis shows the potential of molecular epidemiology to

343

support classical contact tracing, even retrospectively, in order to evaluate and improve measures to

344

contain epidemics like COVID-19.

347

Patients, samples, and diagnosis

348

Respiratory samples from the University Hospital Basel and the University Children’s Hospital Basel

349

(UKBB) patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2: from January 23rd 2020 testing was based on current

350

case definitions from the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH); from 27th February additionally, all

351

respiratory samples negative for other respiratory pathogens were tested. Patient samples which tested

352

positive for SARS-CoV-2 29,30 up to and including March 23rd were considered eligible for the present

353

study. In total 6,943 diagnostic tests were performed during the study period. The 746 positively

354

tested cases came predominantly from the administrative unit of Basel-City, Riehen, and Bettingen

355

(418, 58%), while the remaining patients were from Basel-Landschaft and neighbouring cantons and

356

countries.

357

For diagnosis, swabs from the naso- and oropharyngeal sites (NOPS) were taken, and combined into

358

one universal transport medium tube (UTM, Copan). Total nucleic acids (TNAs) were extracted using

359

the MagNA Pure 96 system and the DNA and viral RNA small volume kit (Roche Diagnostics,

360

Rotkreuz, Switzerland) or using the Abbott m2000 Realtime System and the Abbott sample

361

preparation system reagent kit (Abbott, Baar, Switzerland). Aliquots of extractions were sent for

362

diagnosis to Charité, Berlin, Germany from January 23rd - 29th, and to Geneva to the National

363

Reference Centre (NAVI) in Switzerland from January 29th. In-house analysis started February 27th as

364

part of the hospital routine diagnostics as previously described 30.

365

Whole genome sequencing (WGS)

366

SARS-CoV-2 genomes were amplified following the amplicon sequencing strategy of the ARTIC

367

protocol (https://artic.network/ncov-2019) with V.1 or V.3 primers 31. In detail, real-time reverse

368

transcriptase (RT) reactions were run to a total volume of 10µl extracted total nucleic acid. After

369

some optimization, PCR used 25 cycles for samples with a diagnostic cycle threshold (Ct) value lower

370

than 21 (viral loads higher than 8.2 log10 Geq/ml); 40 cycles for all other samples (lower viral load

371

samples) and repeats. Purified amplicons were converted into Illumina libraries with Nextera Flex

375

Consensus sequence generation and detection of mutations

376

After demultiplexing using bcl2fastq software version v.2.17 (Illumina), COVGAP (COVid-19

377

Genome Analysis Pipeline) was used (Figure S2). This incorporates: quality filtering using

378

trimmomatic software version v.0.38 32 to remove Illumina adaptors and PCR primer sequences from

379

read ends; removal of reads smaller than 127 bases, and removal of reads with a phred score under 20

380

(calculated across a 4-base sliding window). Quality filtered reads were mapped to the Wuhan-Hu-1

381

reference MN908947.3 33 using the BWA aligner 34. Reads flagged as mapping to the reference were

382

retained 35, and are deposited under project PRJEB39887. SNPs and indels with respect to the

383

reference sequence were called using pilon version 1.23 36. Pilon summary metrics ‘alternative allele

384

fraction’ (AF) and ‘depth of valid reads in pileup’ (DP) were used to identify major and minor alleles

385

across all bases, which is not implemented in pilon itself. Major alleles were called if supported by

386

70% of the reads covering the variant locus (AF) for any locus with a minimum of 50x coverage

387

(DP). Variants were applied to the reference to produce a consensus sequence; any base position with

388

less than 50x coverage was masked with ambiguous characters (Ns) using BCFTools version 1.10.2

389

37

390

statistics, logs, coverage plots, and genome stack plots were generated using R version 3.6.0 and

391

packages Gviz v1.30 38, Sushi v1.23 39, seqinr v3.6.1 40, and ggplot2 v3.11 41. COVGAP also provides

392

per genome quality control visual outputs (Figure S5) and is available at

393

https://github.com/appliedmicrobiologyresearch.

394

Quality control statistics such as the relationship between Ct-value and number of mapped reads and

395

coverage are presented in Figure S3. In general, we observed a negative trend linking Ct values and

396

percentage of ambiguous bases (Ns) being called as a result of low coverage. Sequences passing the

397

quality filter (n=533) showed a lower Ct value (median: 22.4±5.14) than the ones that failed (n =156;

398

median: 35.75.9±5.75).

. Consensus sequences were accepted for further analysis when containing up to 10% Ns. Summary

COVGAP Validation

400

We used a set of 15 randomly in silico mutated SARS-CoV-2 mock genomes for the validation of the

401

specificity (identification of true negatives) and accuracy (identification of true negatives and true

402

positives) of COVGAP. Additionally, the genome MT339040, which harbours an 81 nucleotide

403

deletion in the ORF7a gene and a further seven SNPs relative to the reference 42 was used. Together,

404

the mock genomes possess 38 mutations including 30 SNPs, six deletions and two insertions across

405

the reference genome MN908947.3. The genomes were then shredded to artificial paired-end 150

406

nucleotide reads using SAMtools wgsim 37 and processed by COVGAP. For validation purposes,

407

original mock genomes and the COVGAP generated genomes from the shredded reads were aligned

408

using Seaview v4.6 43 and clustalw 44. A phylogeny was built using PhyML within Seaview with

409

default parameters.

410

Phylogenetic lineage assignment of Basel samples

411

To assess the phylogenetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 samples during the early phase of the pandemic

412

we inferred the lineage assignment for each consensus sequence derived from the COVGAP pipeline

413

using PANGOLIN ver. May 19th (Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak LINeages) 14

414

available at github.com/hCoV-2019/pangolin. Details on lineage summaries, describing which

415

countries lineages have been reported from and where transmission events have been recorded, can be

416

found at https://github.com/hCoV-2019/lineages. Lineage assignments were used to aid visualization

417

of phylogenetic diversity in Basel in a global context. For global sequences we used the PANGOLIN

418

lineage assignments as provided by GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/; 19,20) (details next section),

419

which were used for plotting purposes on phylogenetic trees.

420

To compare the lineage diversity in Switzerland and Basel-City to neighbouring European countries

421

(Austria, France, Germany, and Italy) during the early phase of the pandemic, we visualized relative

422

abundances of lineages using all high-quality, on GISAID (downloaded June 22nd, 2020) available

423

consensus sequences for the time until March 23rd from Austria (N = 188), France (N = 230),

424

Germany (N = 133), and Italy (N = 98). For Switzerland (N = 673), we combined our sequences (N =

425

426

canton Basel-City (including Bettingen and Riehen) excluding sequences that were obtained from

427

commuters, we used the Basel-City portion (N = 376) of the Basel area cohort excluding samples

428

from patients from cities outside of the administrative district of Basel-City. We calculated Simpson

429

diversity (inverse Simpson concentration) as implemented in the SpadeR package v.0.0.1 45-47, which

430

controls for lineage abundance differences between the countries, which is dependent on available

431

sequence data, and which ranges from 0 (no diversity) to indefinite (large diversity).

Analysing Basel SARS-CoV-2 genomes in global phylogenetic context

433

High-quality and full-length consensus sequences and corresponding metadata (sample ID, date of

434

sample, geographic location of sampling, PANGOLIN lineage) from Swiss 48 and global viruses were

435

downloaded from GISAID on June 22nd, 2020, making 49,284 individual genome sequences. 43,252

436

sequences were retained after filtering for genomes with under 10% ambiguous characters (Ns)

437

(author Genivaldo Gueiros Z. Silva) 49. Metadata and consensus sequences of the Basel samples and

438

global data from GISAID were combined for further joint analysis, which were performed using

439

custom R scripts and the nextstrain command line interface analysis pipeline v.2.0.0 (nextstrain.org)

440

and augur v.8.0.0 50.

441

Dates in our study samples correspond to date of sampling. Sequences were filtered by date from

442

December 1st 2019 to March 23rd 2020 using an R custom script in R version 4.0.0 51 and packages

443

tidyr ver.1.1.0 52, dplyr ver. 1.0.0. 53, and readr ver. 1.3.1. 54: 15,973 consensus sequences, including

the Basel area sequences, remained. These time-filtered sequences were sub-sampled by geographic

445

location to 30 sequences per country and month. Non-human derived viruses as well as sequences

446

with other ambiguous characters (Us), as well as those from cruise ships, and duplicated sequences

447

defined by the nextstrain team as of June 24th (https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov/) were excluded

448

using augur filter 50 resulting in 2,485 sequences for the final phylogenetic analysis dataset.

449

Consensus sequences were aligned to the NCBI Refseq sequence Wuhan-Hu-1 reference

450

MN908947.3 using mafft v7.467 with method FFT-NS-fragment 55 and options --reorder --keeplength

451

--mapout --kimura 1 -- addfragments --auto. The resulting alignment was end-trimmed to remove

452

low-quality bases (bases 1-55; 29804-29903). We masked homoplasic sites (Table S2) that have no

phylogenetic signal 56 (deposited at https://github.com/W-L/ProblematicSites_SARS-CoV2). Please

454

note, that this list is under constant development as number and diversity of sequence data evolves;

455

we retrieved the data on June 19th, 2020. Masking was done using augur mask.

456

The resulting alignment was analysed in IQ-TREE 2 57 for tree inference using augur tree with

457

substitution model GTR+G. The tree in Newick format was then subjected, together with the date

458

information of each genome and the initial sequence alignment, to an estimation of the evolutionary

459

rate by a regression of the divergence (number of mutations) against the sampling date using

460

TreeTime 58 implemented in augur refine. Genomes or branches that deviated more than four

461

interquartile ranges from the root to the tip versus the time tree were removed as likely outliers. The

462

resulting time-calibrated and divergence trees were re-rooted to MN908947.3 and MT291826.1, the

463

first official cases and published genomes of SARS-CoV-2 from Wuhan, China.

464

Ancestral trait reconstruction of each patient’s viral genome was done for region (continent) and

465

country as well as region and country of exposure using augur traits with a sampling bias correction

466

of 2.5. Internal nodes and tips (actual genomes) were annotated regarding their nucleotide and amino

467

acid changes in relation to the reference using augur ancestral and augur translate, respectively. All

468

data were exported as json files (supplementary files) using augur export v2 to be visualized in

469

auspice v2 50.

470

Identified clades of interest were further inspected for existing epidemiological links using data

471

collected by the University Hospital.

472

Identifying genomes belonging to GISAID emerging clade A20/15324T

473

To identify a possible geographic origin of the synonymous C15324T mutation in ORF1ab, we

474

performed a search on all available GISAID genomes as of August 12th, 2020. We downloaded all

475

high quality and complete genomes that were assigned do GISAID legacy clade G (corresponds to

476

clade 20A) and PANGOLIN lineage B.1 (all three are mostly congruent 59) with a collection date

477

between December 2019 and March 23rd, 2020 (N = 2,856). We used Nextclade version 0.3.5

478

(https://clades.nextstrain.org) to infer genomic mutations and filtered for sequences that contained

479

C15324T. This procedure allowed avoidance of homoplasic mutations at this site. Further, we

480

downloaded metadata for all high quality and complete genomes (as of August 12th, 2020)

481

irrespective of clade to calculate summary statistics of number of genomes sequenced per country.

482

Identification of S-gene D614G mutation in Basel sequences

483

We screened the early phase Basel sequences for the mutation at nucleotide position 23,403 based on

484

the alignment to the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference sequence MN908947.3. Viral load (Ct-value) of patients

485

that carried lineages with a mutated S-D614G gene (N = 274) were compared to patients that carried

486

the ancestral allele (N = 12) using a Mann-Whitney U test.

487

Data accessibility

488

Sequencing data (viral reads only) was submitted to European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) under

489

accession number PRJEB39887, consensus sequences were submitted to GISAID, bioinformatic

490

pipelines are accessible on Github.

491

Ethics

492

The study was conducted according to good laboratory practice and in accordance with the

493

Declaration of Helsinki and national and institutional standards and was approved by the ethical

494

committee (EKNZ 2020-00769). The clinical trial accession number is NCT04351503
