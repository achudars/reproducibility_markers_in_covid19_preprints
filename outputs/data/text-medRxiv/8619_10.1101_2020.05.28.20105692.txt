ABSTRACT
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to more
than 4 million confirmed infections worldwide and over 300,000 deaths. While
Remdesivir has recently received FDA emergency use authorization for treatment of
SARS-CoV-2 infection, convalescent plasma (CP) with high titers of SARS-CoV-2
neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) from recovered donors remains a promising and widely
accessible method to mitigate severe disease symptoms. Here, we describe the
development and validation of a cell-free neutralization PCR assay using SARS-CoV2 spike protein S1 and human ACE2 receptor-DNA conjugates. By comparing with

samples collected prior to the outbreak, we confirmed that NAbs were specifically
detected in COVID-19 cases. Using our unique assay, the NAb signals are detectable
as early as 10 days after onset of symptoms and continue to rise, plateauing after 18
days. Notably, we showed that the use of a licensed pathogen reduction technology to
inactivate potentially contaminating infectious pathogens in CP did not alter NAb
signals, paving a path to safely administer effective CP therapies. The described
neutralization PCR assay can serve as a qualification tool to easily identify suitable CP
donors of a potentially lifesaving therapy. In addition, this assay tool is readily
deployable in standard laboratories with biosafety level 2 capability, and can yield
results within 2-3 hrs. This advancement can facilitate research on factors driving
diverse COVID-19 disease manifestations, help evaluate the impact of various CP
processing protocols on CP therapeutic efficacy and assist in accelerating vaccine
efficacy assessment.
INTRODUCTION
The current epidemic of COVID-19 (novel coronavirus disease-2019) caused by
SARS-CoV-2 has propagated globally at an unprecedented speed. It has led to more
than 4 million confirmed infections worldwide and over 300,000 deaths. COVID-19
disease is particularly challenging in that there are few broadly effective and specialized
treatments to contain the disease and mitigate severe symptoms1,2. Convalescent plasma
(CP) has garnered strong interest since it is readily available from recovered patients
and has been used with some efficacy in past pandemics, including the 2009-2010
H1N1 influenza and the 2013 West Africa Ebola outbreak3.
The primary mechanism of action of CP is through infusing neutralizing antibodies
(NAbs) harvested from recovered patients to disrupt viral entry into host cells in acutely
infected recipient patients3-5. The identification of suitable donors for prompt
administration of CP remains a major unmet need for the effective clinical deployment
of CP. Current serological assays simply detect the interaction of antibody with cognate
viral antigens. Reliance on this interaction, while sufficient for diagnosis, is not
indicative of neutralization capacity, and may lead to therapeutically ineffective CP
without active NAb components. However, current assays that competently assess
NAbs are time-consuming and labor intensive, causing a significant bottleneck to
widespread administration of high-quality CP6,7.
The virus plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) is the current gold standard
assay for NAbs6. However, PRNT’s reliance on large quantities of infectious SARSCoV-2 virions limits the use of this potentially hazardous and time-consuming assay to
relatively few well-resourced institutes with biosafety level 3 (BSL3) laboratories.
Modifications have been implemented to improve the safety profile of the PRNT, but

its fundamental reliance on cell culturing requires dedicated clean room facilities and
several days of observation for measuring impact on cell death. For instance,
pseudovirus neutralization assays port sections of the virus in question into benign viral
hosts to allow for a safer approximation of PRNT, but are still reliant on slow and
expensive cell-based methods6. Therefore, the creation of a high-throughput, rapid and
easily-implementable assay for NAbs for CP therapy remains a high priority.
In this study, we constructed and validated a cell-free assay to measure NAbs using
COVID-19 and control patient samples. This assay was inspired in part by our previous
work with the antibody detection by agglutination PCR (ADAP) methodology that has
been successfully used to develop and validate ultrasensitive and highly specific assays
for wide variety of infections and autoimmune diseases, including HIV, food allergy
and type 1 diabetes8-10. Notably, we used this cell-free assay to characterize antibody
activity in samples from CP used for patient transfusions.
METHODS
Materials.
The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S1) containing amino acids 1-674 with an Fc-tag
at the C-terminus (#31806) expressed in HEK293 cells was purchased from the Native
Antigen Company (Oxford, United Kingdom). The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor
binding domain (RBD) containing amino acids 319-541 with an Fc-tag at the Cterminus (#40592-V02H) and the human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
(ACE2) protein containing amino acids 1-740 with an Fc-tag at the C-terminus (10108H05H) expressed in HEK293 cells were obtained from Sino Biologicals (Beijing,
China). Oligonucleotides used in the study were custom ordered from Integrated DNA
Technologies (Coralville, IA). Platinum Taq polymerase (#10966026), SYBR qPCR 2X
master mix (#4385610), Dithiothreitol (DTT #202090) and sulfo-SMCC (#22122) were
purchased from Thermo Fisher (Waltham, MA). DNA ligase (#A8101) was purchased
from LGC (Teddington, United Kingdom). Other reagents are detailed in the method
sections as appropriate.
Human specimens used in the study.
Blood specimens from SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive individuals were obtained from
various sources. Two serum samples were obtained from COVID-19 patients from the
Oregon Health Sciences University Hospital (OHSU), Portland, OR. These were
sourced from discarded clinical laboratory specimens exempted from informed consent
and IRB approval under condition of patient anonymity. Three plasma samples were
obtained from COVID-19 convalescent outpatient plasma donors of the University
Hospital Basel, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland with informed consent. These

donors were screened in compliance with Swiss regulations on blood donation and
approved as plasma donors in accordance with national regulations. Three convalescent
COVID-19 patients were recruited to donate serum samples for the study with informed
consent under Enable Biosciences IRB #20180015 (approved by Western IRB).
Twenty-five remnant serum samples sourced from discarded clinical laboratory
specimens were obtained from the California Department of Public Health. Forty-seven
serum samples collected prior to the outbreak from blood donors and individuals with
other viral or bacterial infection were purchased from commercial biobanks. All
specimens collected outside of Enable Biosciences clinical network were received as
de-identified specimens.
Synthesis of protein-DNA conjugates for neutralization assay.
For S1, RBD and ACE2-DNA conjugates, the proteins were buffer exchanged in
reaction buffers (55 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM sodium chloride, 20 mM EDTA,
pH 7.2) to make 1 mg/mL solutions. A 1 µL solution of 8mM sulfo-SMCC was added
to 10 µL of each protein solution. The reaction mixtures were incubated at room
temperature for 2 hours. Thiolated DNA was suspended in reaction buffers to 100 µM.
A 3 µL solution of thiolated DNA solution and 4 µL of 100 mM solution of DTT were
mixed to reduce dimerized thiolated DNA to monomer forms. The solution was then
incubated at 37 °C for 1 hour. The excess sulfo-SMCC in protein mixtures and DTT in
thiolated-DNA were removed by 7K MWCO Zeba spin column (Thermo Fischer,
Waltham, MA). The thiolated DNA and protein solutions were then pooled and
incubated overnight at 4 °C. Finally, protein-DNA conjugates were purified by 30 kDa
MWCO filter (Millipore, Burlington, MA). Conjugate concentrations were determined
by BCA assay (Thermo Fischer). Conjugation efficiencies were analyzed by SDSPAGE and silver staining as described previously8-10. DNA-to-protein ratios of the
conjugates were estimated by UV-VIS absorption and typically fell in the range of 2to-1. Protein-DNA conjugates were stored at 4 °C for short-term usage or aliquoted for
long-term storage at -80 °C.
Neutralization PCR assay.
The cell-free neutralization assay detects NAbs by observing the disruption of
interaction between the S1 protein and the ACE2 receptor (Fig. 1). Briefly, 1 µL of
blood sample (e.g. serum, plasma) was incubated with 2 µL of 1 femtomole of S1-DNA
conjugate mixtures at 37 °C for 30 min. Then, 2µL of 1 femtomole of ACE2-DNA
conjugate mixtures was added and incubated at 37 °C for another 30 min. The
neutralizing antibodies in the specimen will engage with S1-DNA conjugate in step 1
to decrease S1-DNA binding with ACE2-DNA in step 2. To quantify the degree of

competition, 115 µL of ligation mix (20 mM Tris, 50 mM KCl, 20 mM MgCl2, 20 mM
DTT, 25 μM NAD, 0.025 U/μl ligase, 100 nM connector) was added and incubated at
30 °C for 15 min. Then, 25 µL of ligated solution was mixed with the PCR master mix
that contained primer pairs and polymerase for amplification under standard
thermocycling conditions (95 °C for 10 min, 95 °C for 15 sec, 56 °C for 30 sec, 13
cycles). The pre-amplified products were quantified in a 96-well qPCR plate. SYBR
green-based qPCR was performed on a Bio-Rad CFX96 real-time PCR detection
system (95 °C for 10 min, 95 °C for 30 sec, 56 °C for 1 min, 40 cycles). As a result of
competition, specimens harboring high quantities of NAbs will have less amplifiable
DNA, thus a weaker qPCR signal (higher Ct). In contrast, samples without neutralizing
antibodies will benefit from the strong binding between S1 and ACE2 proteins to
generate a large amount of DNA amplicons, thus a stronger qPCR signal (lower Ct).
Instead of using the common cycle threshold (Ct) as a readout, the neutralization PCR
assay readout ΔCt is defined as the Ct value of the actual sample minus the Ct of a blank
control. The magnitude of the ΔCt is proportional to the loss of amplicon concentration
in the PCR plate well, which in turn is proportional to the amount of neutralizing
antibody present in the sample. The ΔCt offers significant reproducibility since the
subtraction of the blank control Ct and the sample Ct cancels out any potential drift
across runs.
Pathogen inactivation process for convalescent plasma samples.
The Amotosalen/UV light pathogen reduction system (INTERCEPT, Cerus
Corporation, Concord, CA) was used to inactivate potential pathogens in convalescent
plasma samples according to the manufacturer’s manual11,12. Briefly, the plasma
samples were first mixed with amotosalen, then passed through an illumination
chamber for UVA light treatment. The amotosalen specifically cross-links nucleic acids
within the plasma but leaves the protein component intact. The amotosalen was then
removed by flow through a chemical absorption device. The final pathogen-inactivated
plasma was stored in a sterile plastic container.
RESULTS
Development of a cell-free assay to measure NAbs.
Neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against SARS-CoV-2 are predominantly directed
against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein where they act to
disrupt its interaction with the ACE2 receptor on the human cell surface13-15
We thus sought to recreate this competition between the NAb and ACE2 receptors
for the spike protein in an in vitro assay. While it is possible to develop such assays
using ELISA or other solid-phase assay approaches7, the ACE2 receptor is highly

conformational and difficult to express. The deposition of ACE2 on solid supports
could potentially denature or mask critical epitopes. This would create a departure from
their true conformations on viral and cell surfaces. To mitigate this concern, we
constructed a solution-phase assay wherein a full-length DNA barcode is split into two
halves – one installed on the spike protein, and the other installed on the ACE2 receptor
(Fig. 1). In the absence of NAbs, the spike protein and the ACE2 receptor naturally
engage, positioning the two DNA barcodes in close proximity. Then, the addition of a
DNA ligase reunites the two barcodes into a full-length DNA amplicon for
amplification and quantification. In contrast, NAbs present in a sample will bind onto
the spike protein DNA conjugate and prevent its interaction with the ACE2 receptor
conjugate. In this scenario, attenuation of signal is observed, since the two DNA
barcodes cannot come into the close proximity for ligation and amplification. Given
that there is no need for washing or centrifugation to remove the DNA-barcoded probes,
the entire assay is conducted in the solution phase, thus preserving the native antigen
conformation.
In the development process, we first evaluated assay performance using the S1
portion of the spike protein versus the receptor binding domain (RBD) fragments of the
S1 protein. We assayed two convalescent COVID19 patients and four control
specimens from healthy blood donors collected prior to the outbreak (Fig. 2). The
COVID-19 samples had been analyzed using a cell-based pseudovirus neutralization
assay19 and confirmed to contain high titers of NAbs. For both antigens, we observed
no competition signals from the negative control specimens, and strong competition
signals from the COVID-19 samples, indicating effective competition and
neutralization of the S1-ACE2 interaction. Observing much stronger signals in the S1
protein-based neutralization-PCR assay (Fig. 2), we chose to proceed with the S1
protein for further validation. A possible explanation for this observation is that NAbs
may neutralize by binding an adjacent epitope on the S1 protein outside of the RBD but
still block binding to ACE2 through steric hindrance as evident in Middle East
Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) related NAbs16.
Evaluation of neutralization PCR assay sensitivity and specificity.
To further validate the assay, we tested blood samples from 18 COVID-19 patients
collected 12 days after symptom onset and control specimens collected prior to the
outbreak from 43 patients with other infections, including HCV, flavivirus and Lyme
disease using the S1-protein neutralization PCR assay (Fig. 3). NAbs were detected in
all 18 COVID-19 samples but not in any of the 43 non-COVID-19 samples, indicating
effective competition and neutralization of the ACE2-S1 interaction. The results
demonstrated that this DNA-barcoding assay could detect disruption of S1-ACE2

interaction by NAbs, and, critically, that the NAb signals are specific for SARS-CoV2.
Analysis of NAbs development over time.
After creating a functional NAb assay, we then analyzed 5 samples from COVID19 patients collected within 10 days post symptoms onset, 5 samples between 10- 12
days, 6 samples between 13-15 days, 5 samples between 16-18 days and 7 samples 18
days after symptom onset. The NAb signals quickly increased between 10-12 days and
reached a plateau 18 days after onset (Fig. 4).
Evaluation of the impact of CP inactivation protocols on the NAbs.
Transfusion of convalescent plasma (CP) for COVID-19 patients may occur in
severely ill patients, who are especially vulnerable to the impact of other potentially
infectious pathogens in the CP17. While donor screening and NAT screening can be
implemented to rule out the majority of common blood-borne infectious agents,
pathogen reduction treatment for CP is warranted to reduce the risk due to any
remaining pathogens not detected by standard blood donor screening tests.
Pathogen inactivation using amotosalen and UVA radiation induced nucleic acidpsoralen adducts has demonstrated efficacy in substantially reduce pathogen burdens in
CP11,12. We tested samples of CP from three COVID-19 donors before and after
pathogen reduction (Fig. 5). The NAb signals were highly preserved, indicating
retention of the active NAb component after such pathogen reduction treatment.
DISCUSSION
Analytical techniques for SARS-CoV-2 are essential for a variety of purposes.
RNA-based tests detect actively infected patients who might be shedding infectious
virus. Serological tests are required to measure the presence of antibodies to aid in
understanding individual exposure and prevalence. Neutralizing antibody assays are
required to provide insight into immunity of individuals and to recruit CP donors to
help treat critically ill patients or to act as short-term immunoprotection for front-line
health care workers and immunocompromised and high mortality risk individuals3.
We developed an easily deployable test that used standard real-time quantitative
PCR (qPCR) to quantify these critical NAbs. The method has the benefit of operational
simplicity in that it only requires serial addition of key reagents without washing,
centrifugation or cell culturing. The assay can be completed in as little as 140 min and
is amenable to high-throughput implementation on laboratory liquid handling
workstations. The use of purely recombinant proteins helps standardize assay protocols
and results across laboratories. The assay also has the advantage of consuming a very

small amount of ACE2 protein per assay, since ACE2 protein is highly costly due to
low yield.
Our study revealed that both the RBD and S1 proteins can be used as antigens for
our neutralization assay. However, the S1 proteins showed stronger NAb signals. Past
MERS studies have identified highly potent neutralizing monoclonal antibodies
targeting regions outside of the RBD16. The finding warrants future study to investigate
whether use of the full-length spike protein (S1+S2) can further enhance NAb detection.
It also remains to be evaluated if competition NAb assay signals using any of these
antigens correlate with the therapeutic efficacy of the sample.
Furthermore, the study showed that the average NAb signals continued to rise after
onset of initial symptoms and then plateau after day 18. These data are consistent with
an independent study using the pseudovirus neutralizing assay14. This evidence further
affirms that cell-free assay formats can obtain results that are concordant with cellbased assays.
Notably, this assay may be used to investigate and qualify different pathogen
inactivation procedures for CP. As an example, we showed that UVA/amotosalen
treatment did not disrupt the functional integrity of NAbs. Similar retention of antibody
neutralization efficacy after pathogen reduction has been reported for convalescent
Ebola virus convalescent plasma18.
In conclusion, we report development of an easily adoptable assay format to
facilitate the measurement of neutralizing function of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. This
assay can complement traditional serological assays by identifying promising CP
donors and help focus further analysis on those high-quality donors that merit further
characterization using more sophisticated methods including the live virus plaque
reduction neutralization test (PRNT). This testing scheme may facilitate a more rapid
turn around and delivery of well-characterized convalescent plasma to patients when it
is most needed. Future studies are planned to verify assay performance in larger cohorts
to broaden the observed correlation with PRNT and to assess utility in terms of
improved CP treatment outcomes. Finally, accurate assessment of neutralization
capacity is an essential measure of vaccine efficacy. This assay has the potential to assist
and accelerate worldwide efforts at developing and validating viable vaccines for
SARS-CoV-2.

Figure 1. Principle of neutralization PCR assay. (A) Viral entry of SARS-CoV-2 is
mediated by the binding of the spike protein to the human receptor angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Disruption of this interaction forms the basis of
neutralizing antibodies (NAbs). (B) Neutralization PCR assay reconstructs this
interaction using a pair of S1 subunits of the spike protein- and ACE2-DNA conjugates.
In the absence of NAbs, S1 and ACE2 engage with strong affinity, thereby positioning
the two DNA barcodes in close proximity for subsequent ligation and PCRamplification. On the other hand, binding of NAbs blocks S1 from ACE2, leaving the
two DNA barcodes separated. Since each barcode has only one PCR primer binding
site, they cannot be amplified. Therefore, the quantities of NAbs are correlated with the
decrease of PCR amplicon formation.

evaluate suitability for neutralization PCR assay, we tested convalescent COVID19

outbreak. Notably, the COVID19 sera were confirmed to harbor NAbs by pseudo-virus
neutralization assay. The y-axis is the neutralization PCR assay signal ΔCt calculated
by subtracting the Ct value of the sample from that of a buffer only blank control.

Figure 3. NAbs reactivity in convalescent COVID-19 and control sera with other
infection by neutralization PCR assay. Convalescent COVID-19 sera (N=18) were
from patients 14 days after symptom onset (blue), and control sera (N=43) from patients
with HCV, flavivirus infection and Lyme disease (red).

Figure 4. Evaluation of kinetics of NAb development by neutralization PCR assay.
Sera from COVID-19 patients after different days post symptom onset were tested by
neutralization PCR assay. All sera samples (N=28) were from unique individuals. The
boxplots show medians (middle line) and third and first quartiles (boxes), while the
whiskers show minimum and maximum above and below the box.

Figure 5. Evaluation of the integrity of NAbs before and after pathogen
inactivation treatment of plasma. Three convalescent plasma specimens from
recovered COVID-19 patients were treated with amotosalen and UVA light for photochemical pathogen inactivation prior to administration to symptomatic COVID-19
patients. The impact on NAbs integrity was evaluated by neutralization PCR assay by
comparing signals before (black) and after (gray) pathogen inactivation treatment. Error
bars show standard deviations of three replicates.
