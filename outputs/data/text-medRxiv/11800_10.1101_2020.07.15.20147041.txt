Abstract
Background: Animal models of COVID-19 have been rapidly reported after the start of the
pandemic. We aimed to assess whether the newly created models reproduce the full spectrum
of humans COVID-19.
Methods: We searched the Medline, as well as BioRxiv and MedRxiv preprint servers for
original research published in English from January 1, to May 20, 2020. We used the search
terms “COVID-19” OR “SARS-CoV-2” AND, “animal models”, “hamsters”, “nonhuman
primates”, “macaques”, “rodent”, “mice”, “rats”, “ferrets”, “rabbits”, “cats”, and “dogs”.
Inclusion criteria were the establishment of animal models of COVID-19 as an endpoint.
Other inclusion criteria were assessment of prophylaxis, therapies, or vaccines, using animal
models of COVID-19.
Findings: 13 peer-reviewed studies and 14 preprints met inclusion criteria. The animals used
were nonhuman primates (n=13), mice (n=7), ferrets (n=4), hamsters (n=4), and cats (n=1).
All animals supported high viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract associated
with mild clinical manifestations, lung pathology and full recovery. Older animals displayed
relatively more severe illness than the younger ones. No animal models developed hypoxemic
respiratory failure, multiple organ dysfunction, culminating in death. All species elicited a
specific IgG antibodies response to the spike proteins, which were protective against a second
exposure. Transient systemic inflammation was observed occasionally in Rhesus macaques,
hamsters, and mice. Notably, none of the animals unveiled cytokine storm or coagulopathy.
Conclusions: Most of the animal models of COVID-19 recapitulated mild pattern of human
COVID-19 with full recovery phenotype. No severe illness associated with mortality was
observed, suggesting a wide gap between COVID-19 in humans and animal models.
Funding: There was no funding source for this study.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a febrile respiratory illness due to a novel viral
pathogen severe acute respiratory syndrome–coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)1,2. COVID-19 can
progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple organ dysfunction/failure
(MOSD), culminating in death2-4.
SARS-CoV-2 is a beta coronavirus that binds with a high affinity to angiotensin-converting
enzyme (ACE) 2 receptor and uses the transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS) 2 as coreceptor to gain entry to cells5-7. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are co-expressed in many tissues and
organs, particularly the nasal epithelial cells and alveolar type II cells of the lungs, which may
explain in part the easy transmission from person-to-person, and its dissemination within the
body in severe and fatal cases6-13. Accordingly, SARS-CoV-2-induced COVID-19 has led to a
pandemic that overwhelmed the capacity of most national health systems, resulting in a global
health crisis14. So far, an estimated 11, 280 million persons in 188 countries were infected, of
which 531.000 died15.
The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 is complex and has been categorized as mild, severe, and
critical, representing 81, 14, and 5%2,3. The mild pattern comprises patients with either no
signs and symptoms or fever and radiological evidence of pneumonia3. The severe pattern
manifests as rapidly progressive hypoxemic pneumonia involving more than half of the lung
with a full recovery phenotype2,3. The critical pattern consists of ARDS requiring respiratory
assistance, MOSD that result in death in approximately half of the patients2,3,16,17. Mortality
was associated with host factors such as old age, comorbidities, and immune response4.
Viral and immunopathological studies revealed distinct patterns between mild and severe or
critical forms of COVID-194,17-25. Both severe and critically ill patients displayed higher viral
load in the upper respiratory tract than mild cases, together with delayed clearance

overtime17,18. Likewise, they presented with lymphopenia due to a decrease in CD4+ and
CD8+ T cells, as well as T cells exhaustion accompanied by a marked inflammatory
response20-25. Pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines concentrations were
increased systemically and locally in the lung and correlated with severity20-22. In contrast, in
the mild illness, the lymphocyte count was normal, with no or minimal inflammatory
response19,22. Together, these suggest that the viral load and dynamic together with the host
inflammatory response may play a pathogenic role.
Clinical and post-mortem studies of fatal cases of COVID-19 demonstrated major alteration
of coagulation and fibrinolysis12,13. This was associated with widespread thrombosis of small
and large vessels, particularly of the pulmonary circulation contributing to death in a third of
patients26-32. These observations suggest that dysregulated coagulation may be an important
mechanism of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality33.
In this context, animal models appear crucial to a better understanding of the complex
biology of COVID-19. Animal models of SARS-CoV-2-induced COVID-19 have been
rapidly reported since the start of the pandemic34. However, whether they express the full
phenotype of COVID-19, particularly the severe and critical patterns associated with lethality,
remains to be determined. In this systematic review, we examined whether the newly created
animal models reproduce the phenotype of human COVID-19. Moreover, we examined the
knowledge generated by these models of COVID-19 including viral dynamic and
transmission, pathogenesis, and testing of therapy and vaccines.

We conducted a systematic review according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) statement35 to identify studies describing the creation
of an animal model of COVID-19 as an endpoint (Box1 and supplemental Box1 ).
Results
The systematic search identified 101 studies and 326 preprints, of which 400 articles were
excluded because they were reviews, non-original articles, or unrelated to the COVID-19
infection (Fig.1 and supplemental Table 1). 13 peer-reviewed studies and 14 preprints were
included in the analysis.
The studies used Old-world nonhuman primates (n=13)36-48, mice (n=7)49-55, hamsters (n=4)5558

, ferrets (n=4)59-62, cats, and dogs (n=1)62 (Tables 1-4). Male and female, as well as young

and old, were included but with no associated comorbidities. The aims were to investigate the
pathogenesis of COVID-19 (n=15), testing drugs and vaccines (n=14), the host immune
response (n=6), and the virus dynamic and transmission (n=4) (Tables 1-4).
Other animals studied included pigs, ducks, and chickens, however none of them supported
SARS-CoV-2 replication, and hence will not be discussed further62,63.
All the experimental animals were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 with various strains, doses,
and route of administration that differed across studies (Table 1-4). Likewise, the time-point
for tissue collection and pathological assessment were variables. These together precluded any
comparisons between the animal models either intra-species or inter-species.
Nonhuman primate models

Viral model: Rhesus macaques (n=10)36-45, Cynomolgus (n=3)45-47, and African Green model
(n=1)48 from the Old World primates and common marmoset (n=1)45 from the New World
were assessed as models for COVID-19 (Table 1). SARS-CoV-2 strains, dose and route of

inoculation were different across studies. Infection through the intragastric, conjunctival and
intratracheal routes elicited no lung pathology, mild and severe interstitial pneumonia,
respectively, thus, emphasizing the relevance of the entry site of the virus in the expression of
the disease44. The animals were euthanized at different time-points post- inoculation ranging
from 3 to 33 days.
Phenotype: The animals displayed variable clinical manifestations from none to fever, altered
respiratory patterns, and other general signs (Table 1). The clinical manifestations were not
different between old and young macaques45-47. Structural and ultrastructural examination of
the respiratory tract were also variables including mild to moderate interstitial pneumonitis,
edema, foci of diffuse alveolar damage with occasional hyaline membrane formation and
pneumocytes type II hyperplasia (Table 1). Old rhesus macaques exhibited more diffuse and
severe interstitial pneumonia than young ones46. No extrapulmonary injury was documented
except in two studies, which revealed inflammatory cells infiltrating the jejunum, and colon,
steatosis of the liver, and alteration of myocardial fiber architecture with increased
mitochondrial density32,45. No mortality was observed in any of the nonhuman primate
models.
Comparisons between species of nonhuman primates was not possible except in one study,
which suggested that rhesus macaques was superior to cynomolgus and common marmoset as
models of human COVID-1945. Other comparisons suggested that SARS-CoV elicited more
severe lung pathology than SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV47 (Table 1).
Viral and host interaction: The virus replicated rapidly and at higher titers in upper airway
and lung and intrathoracic lymph nodes in all four species. The virus was detected in
pneumocytes type I and II, and ciliated epithelial cells of nasal, bronchial and bronchiolar
mucosa. This differs from MERS-CoV where the virus was mainly present in type II
pneumocytes45 (Table1). Replication of the virus was also demonstrated in jejunum, colon,

and rectum27,36,48. Viral genome was detected in the blood of rhesus macaques, cynomolgus,
and marmoset in one study45. Viral replication of nasopharyngeal as well as anal swabs, and
lung in old macaques was higher than in young ones 46,47.
SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced IgG antibodies response against the SARS-CoV-2 spike was
noted in all species36,45,47,48 except in marmoset45. The antibodies were protective against a
second exposure to the virus. There was no difference between males and females; however,
young rhesus macaques had lower antibodies titers than the old macaques45. The innate
immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection was variable with normal, high or low leucocytes
and lymphocytes counts36,45. Occasional reduction of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells concentrations
was documented36 as well as transitory release of various cytokines, and chemokines at
different days post-inoculation36,45,48.
Drugs and vaccines: DNA and inactivated virus-based vaccines were evaluated and showed
protection in these nonhuman primates. However, the DNA vaccine did not reduce the virus
presence in the upper airway, while there was a residual small interstitial pneumonitis in the
macaques that received inactivated virus39,40. This suggests that none of the vaccines tested so
far, displayed a comprehensive protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Several candidate
DNA vaccines based in various forms of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein were also tested
in rhesus macaques38. The findings revealed that only the vaccine encoding the full-length (S)
offered optimal protection against SARS-CoV-264. Nonhuman primates served also for the
evaluation of antiviral therapies and medical interventions such as CT- and PET-scanners46.
Mouse models

Viral model: Wild type mice (BALB/c, C57BL/6); immunodeficient mice (SCID); chimeric
mouse expressing human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), and the RNA-dependent
RNA polymerase (SARS1/SARS2-RdRp) were evaluated as models of COVID-19 (Table 2).

Moreover, knockout (KO) mice were generated to test specific immunological pathways or
therapy, including ablation of type I (IFNar1-/-) and III interferon (IFN) receptors (IL28r-/-),
signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (STAT2-/-); and serum esterase (Ces1c-/-).

Patients’ isolates of SARS-CoV-2 from different sources and variable times of passaging on
various cell cultures or BALB/c mice were employed (Table 2). The multiple passaging on
whole animal adapted the virus to the murine ACE-253. SARS-CoV-2 was also modified
through the remodeling of the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD), which enhanced its
binding efficiency to murine ACE251.

Phenotype: The clinical signs and symptoms varied from none to mild weight loss, arched
back, and slight bristles. Whole-body plethysmography was used to measure the respiratory
function of the animals and showed a mild to moderate reduction in old more than in young
(Table 2). Likewise, the pathological changes varied according to the experimental models
and included peribronchiolar inflammation, lung edema, moderate multifocal interstitial
pneumonia, lymphocytes infiltration, and intra-alveolar hemorrhage. Survival of hACE2 mice
was decreased at 5 day post-inoculation and was attributed to high viral replication in the
brain, while it was minimal in the lung, suggesting a different pathogenic mechanism of death
from human COVID-1951. Wild type mice showed no pathology as compared to hACE2 mice,
indicating that lack of human ACE2 receptor cannot be infected or inefficiently with SARSCoV-249,55. On the other hand, mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 exhibited more severe
pathology, particularly in the aged mouse than hACE2 transgenic mouse, suggesting that
these models may be more relevant for the study of human COVID-1951,53. However, whether
the pathogenesis induced by the mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 is translatable to human
warrants further studies51,53.

Viral and host interaction: The virus replicated to high titers in the upper and lower
respiratory tract in most of the genetically modified mice models but not in wild type. Viral
replication was detected outside the respiratory tract in the intestine of hACE2 mice49 as well
as in the liver, and heart in mouse modified SARS-CoV-2 RBD51. Increased viral replication
in KO mice IFNar1-/- suggested that interferon limited the viral replication55.
Specific IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were documented in two studies (Table 2). The
IgG antibodies were found to cross-react in their binding to the spike protein of SARS-CoV,
however, with no cross-neutralization, hence suggesting the conservation of the same spike
protein epitopes among coronaviruses52. Proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were
demonstrated in mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2, and KO mouse (Table 2). The inflammatory
response was significantly higher in the old than young mice.
Drugs and vaccines: Antiviral therapies, including remdesivir54, IFN lambda51, and human
monoclonal IgG1 antibody against RBD49, were tested in these mouse models and produced a
protective effect. Likewise, vaccines using viral particles expressing SARS-2-S protein51, or
an RBD-based vaccine were tested and showed protection54.
Hamsters

Viral model: Wild type Syrian hamsters and knockout hamsters for signal transducer and
activator of transcription 2 (STAT2-/- lacking type I and III interferon signaling) and
interleukin 28 receptors (IL28r-/- lacking IFN type III signaling) were reported as models for
COVID-19. Patients isolate of SARS-CoV-2 from different sources and different passages on
various cell cultures were used (Table 3). SARS-CoV-2 was administered intranasally at
different titers to anesthetized hamsters. Viral transmission between hamsters was
demonstrated either through direct contact or indirectly via airborne transmission.

Phenotype: The clinical manifestations included weight loss, which was consistently
observed. Other clinical signs and symptoms such as rapid breathing, lethargy, ruffled furs,
and hunched back posture were reported in one study56. The histopathological findings were
variables according to the experimental models and ranged from lung consolidation to
multifocal necrotizing bronchiolitis, leukocyte infiltration, and edema. STAT2 -/- hamsters
exhibited attenuated lung pathology as compared with IL28R-a -/- hamsters suggesting that
interferon type I response contributed to the injury55.
Viral and host interaction: The virus replicated to high titer in the upper and lower
respiratory tract in most of the hamsters’ models. Viral replication was detected in blood and
kidney with low concentration (Table 3). STAT2-/- hamsters had higher titers of infectious
virus in the lung, viremia, and high levels of viral RNA in the spleen, liver, and upper and
lower gastrointestinal tract in comparison with wild type and IL28R-a -/- hamsters. This
suggests that IFN type I response limited the replication of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The
mechanisms of this conflicting effect namely restricting the virus replication, while in the
same time contributing to lung injury remains unclear. Specific IgG antibodies against SARSCoV-2 were documented in the sera of hamsters at different time-points from virus
inoculation ranging from 7 to 21 days. Increased expression of proinflammatory and
chemokine genes was demonstrated in the lungs of the SARS-CoV-2 infected animals,
however with no increase in circulating levels of proteins such as TNF, interferon-γ, and IL-6.
Drugs and vaccines: Immunoprophylaxis with early convalescent serum achieved a
significant decrease in viral lung load but not in lung pathology56.
Ferrets, cat, and dog

Viral model and phenotype: Ferrets, cats, and dogs were administered intranasally or
intratracheally with various doses and strains of SARS-CoV-2 (Table 4). Ferrets displayed

elevated body temperature for several days associated with signs that differed according to the
studies. These include decreased activity and appetite, sporadic cough, and no body weight
loss59-62. No clinical signs were reported either in cats or in dogs.
Histopathological changes: Ferrets exhibited acute bronchiolitis60,62, with perivasculitis and
vasculitis62, but with no discernible pneumonia. Cats disclosed lesions in epithelial nasal,
tracheal, and lung mucosa (Table 2).
Viral and host interaction: The virus replication and shedding were demonstrated in the upper
airways and rectal swabs in ferrets and cats, but the extent to other tissues varied in ferrets
from none to multiple organs, including lung, blood, and urine. No viral RNA was detected in
cats’ lungs. Dogs showed RNA positive rectal swab but none in upper or lower airways. Viral
transmission between ferrets and cats was demonstrated either through direct contact54 or
indirectly via airborne route61.
Ferrets, cats, and dogs exhibited specific antibody response against SARS-CoV-259,61,62. A
study of the ferret immune response to SARS-CoV-2 revealed a subdued low interferon type I
and type III response that contrasts with increased chemokines and proinflammatory cytokine
IL6, which is reminiscent of the human response60.

Discussion
This systematic review of experimental animal models of SARS-CoV-2 induced- COVID-19
identified 13 peer-reviewed studies and 14 preprints that reported data on nonhuman
primates36-48, mice49-55, hamsters55-58, ferrets59-62, cats and dogs62 models of COVID-19. The
main findings indicate that most of the animal models could mimic many features of mild
human COVID-19 with a full recovery phenotype3. They also revealed that older animals
display relatively more severe illness than the younger ones37,45,47,51,53, which evokes human

COVID-193,65. However, none of the animal models replicated the severe or critical patterns
associated with mortality as observed in humans with COVID-193.
The results of this systematic review are consistent with studies of animal models of SARSCoV-2 and MERS-CoV, which failed to replicate the full spectrum of humans’ illness66,67.
Nonetheless, several features of mild COVID-19 in humans could be mirrored. High viral
titers in the upper and lower respiratory tract and lung pathology were demonstrated in both
large and small animal models. The pathology encompassed mild interstitial pneumonia,
consolidation, and diffuse alveolar damage, albeit localized to small lung area, edema, hyaline
membrane formation, and inflammation. SARS-CoV-2 elicited specific antibodies response
against various viral proteins in the sera of most of the animal models.
This systematic review revealed that none of these newly established animal models
replicated the common complications of human COVID-19 such as ARDS and
coagulopathy26-32,65,68,69. ARDS can be particularly severe and results in refractory hypoxemia
requiring maximum respiratory supportive measures in intensive care unit65,68,69. The
coagulopathy can lead to severe complications such as massive pulmonary embolism,
cerebrovascular stroke, and mesenteric infarction, including in younger people26,27,31,32. The
pathology underlying these two complications were recently revealed by post-mortem studies
disclosing diffuse alveolar damage involving the whole lung, hyaline membrane formation,
and infiltration with inflammatory cells, thus leaving no air space open for
ventilation12,13,64,70,71. It also detected the presence of diffuse and widespread thrombosis in
the micro- and macro-circulation, including the pulmonary circulation compromising the lung
perfusion12,13. This double hit affecting the ventilation and perfusion simultaneously underlies
the intractable hypoxemia that contributed to the high mortality. None of the animal models
replicated the respiratory failure, thromboembolic manifestations, and their pathological

expression, hence, indicating that a wide gap separates the animal models from the full
spectrum of COVID-19 in humans.
The mechanisms of the lung injury and coagulopathy are not well understood, although
several known pathways were postulated including cytokines storm leading to upregulation of
tissue factor20-22, activation/injury of the endothelium infected by the virus29,68,72, complement
activation73, alveolar hypoxia promoting thrombosis74, and autoantibodies against
phospholipid and lupus anticoagulant75,76 modulating the hemostasis and coagulation cascade
directly. Hence, the development of animal models that replicate the dysregulation of the
inflammation and coagulation could be important, as these would allow the deciphering of the
intimate mechanisms at play. This, in turn, may aid in identifying therapeutic targets and the
testing of immunotherapy, anticoagulation, and thrombolytic interventions and thereby may
improve the outcome.
Both antiviral and vaccine therapies were tested in rhesus macaques and mice infected with
SARS-CoV-239-41. The antiviral drug stopped the viral replication and improved the
pneumonitis41,54. The vaccines induced an increase in titers of neutralizing antibodies in the
sera that correlated with the decrease of viral replication and prevented the lung pathology3840

. These results represent a substantial proof of the concept of antiviral or vaccine efficacy

against SARS-CoV-2 in animal models. However, because of the lack of overt clinical illness,
the rapid clearance of the virus, and spontaneous improvement of the pneumonitis without
lethality, the models do not permit the full assessment of the duration of the protection of the
vaccines, or the effect of antiviral therapy on survival.
Since the emergence of SARS-CoV infection in 200377, followed by the MERS-CoV in
201278, and now with COVID-19, researchers have not been able to develop a model of
coronavirus infection that reproduces the severity and lethality seen in humans66,67. One of the
well-known reasons lies in the difference of ACE-2 receptor binding domain structure across

species79. Human and old-world primates have conserved a comparable structure that allows
binding with high affinity to the SARS-CoV-279. The new-world primates, hamsters, ferrets,
and cats maintained an intermediate affinity, while mice exhibit very low affinity79. The latter
explains why wild-type mouse does not support SARS-CoV-2 replication, and hence, the
necessity to create a chimera that expresses human ACE-2, to enable the use of this species as
model of COVID-1949. More recently, a study applying single-cell RNA sequencing to
nonhuman primate uncovered another explanation that may underlies the difference between
old-world primates and humans in expressing the complex phenotype of COVID-1980. The
study reveals that the cellular expression and distribution of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 which are
essential for virus entry in the cells and its spread inside the body differ in the lung, liver, and
kidney between the two species. ACE2 expression was found lower in pneumocytes type II
and higher in ciliated cells in nonhuman primate lung as compared to humans39. This is
particularly significant as type II pneumocytes are critical targets of SARS-CoV-2 in humans
and the pathogenesis of lung injury/damage. Finally, the innate immune response including
the defense system against viruses diverged during evolution both at the transcriptional levels
and cellular levels, which may also explain why the SARS-CoV-2 hardly progresses in these
animals outside the respiratory system81. Taken together, these fundamental differences
represent a real challenge to the successful development of an animal model that reproduces
human COVID-19.
This systematic review has few limitations. First, it is the high number of preprints included in
this study that have not been peer-reviewed. Second, the animal models from the same species
were difficult to compare across studies, as they used different viral strain, inoculum size,
route of administration, and timing of tissue collection.
In conclusion, this systematic review revealed that animal models of COVID19 mimic mild
human COVID-19, but not the severe form COVID-19 associated with mortality. It also

disclosed the knowledge generated by these models of COVID-19 including viral dynamic
and transmission, pathogenesis, and testing of therapy and vaccines. Likewise, the study
underlines the distinct advantages and limitations of each model, which should be considered
when designing studies, interpreting pathogenic mechanisms, or extrapolating therapy or
vaccines results to humans. Finally, harmonization of animal research protocols to generate
results that are consistent, reproducible, and comparable across studies is needed.

Box 1. Search strategy and selection criteria
We searched the Medline, as well as BioRxiv and MedRxiv preprint servers for original research
describing or using an animal model of SARS-CoV-2 induced COVID published in English from
January 1, 2020, to May 20, 2020. We used the search terms “COVID-19” OR “SARS-CoV-2” AND,
“animal models”, “hamsters”, “nonhuman primates”, “macaques”, “rodent”, “mice”, “rats”, “ferrets”,
“rabbits”, “cats”, and “ dogs”. The preprint servers were included in the search as the field of COVID19 is developing quickly. Inclusion criteria were establishment of animal models of COVID-19 as
endpoint. Other inclusion criteria were assessment of prophylaxis, therapies, or vaccines, using animal
models of COVID-19. 101 studies and 326 preprints were screened, of which 13 peer-reviewed studies
and 14 preprints were included in the final analysis (Fig.1). The variables extracted were the population
type, study aim, the virus strain used, clinical response, pathology, viral replication, and host response
as well as the effects of prophylaxis, drugs, or vaccines. The outcomes were organized according to
species and categorized into phenotype (signs or symptoms; histopathology, time-course of the illness
and outcome), viral (titer in each tissue organ, detection methods, duration of positivity), and host
response (dynamic of seroconversion, inflammatory and hemostatic markers), therapy and vaccine
(efficacy, and safety).
