Abstract

106

Background:

107

To increase bed capacity and resources, hospitals have postponed elective surgeries, although the

108

financial impact of this decision is unknown. We sought to report elective surgical case distribution,

109

associated gross hospital earnings and regional hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) bed capacity

110

as elective surgical cases are cancelled and then resumed under simulated trends of COVID-19

111

incidence.

112

113

Methods:

114

A retrospective, cohort analysis was performed using insurance claims from 161 million enrollees

115

from the MarketScan database from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2017. COVID-19 cases were

116

calculated using a generalized Richards model. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reports on the

117

number of hospitalized and intensive care patients by age were used to estimate the number of cases

118

seen in the ICU, the reduction in elective surgeries and the financial impact of this from historic claims

119

data, using a denominator of all inpatient revenue and outpatient surgeries.

120

121

Results:

122

Assuming 5% infection prevalence, cancelling all elective procedures decreases ICU overcapacity

123

from 340% to 270%, but these elective surgical cases contribute 78% (IQR 74, 80) (1.1 trillion (T) US

124

dollars) to inpatient hospital plus outpatient surgical gross earnings per year. Musculoskeletal,

125

circulatory and digestive category elective surgical cases compose 33% ($447B) of total revenue.

126

127

Conclusions:

128

Procedures involving the musculoskeletal, cardiovascular and digestive system account for the

129

largest loss of hospital gross earnings when elective surgery is postponed. As hospital bed capacity

INTRODUCTION

183

The novel Coronavirus Infectious Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly transmittable virus that has

184

resulted in over 2.5 million infections worldwide [2]. United States (US) health systems are designed

185

for stable, predictable utilization patterns; they are generally unprepared for surge medical need as is

186

required with the COVID-19 pandemic. Surge situations have historically been addressed by

187

deploying temporary medical teams and tent facilities, or have overwhelmed the available resources

188

with resultant excess morbidity and mortality [3]. Current estimates suggest 5% of the US population

189

will contract COVID-19, of whom 15% will require hospitalization, and 5% will require intensive care

190

[4-6]. At this rate, there will be 5 infected patients requiring hospitalization for every existing US

191

hospital bed in addition to concomitant hospitalized non-COVID patients [7].

192

193

In order to decrease the resources needed during the peak of COVID-19, many countries have

194

adopted physical distancing to attempt to flatten the curve of COVID-19 [8]. Some nations, such as

195

China, have taken extreme measures such as forced quarantines and a completely shutdown of all

196

aspects of society whereas other countries such as Norway have chosen to remain largely open. The

197

United States has emphasized physical distancing and suspension of non-essential business

198

operations which have, until now, included elective surgical procedures. This has resulted in

199

hospitals in areas with relatively few COVID-19 patients, such as Utah, functioning at only 30% of

200

their typical inpatient and surgical capacity. The financial implications of cancelling elective surgical

201

procedures has been devastating for healthcare systems with some systems currently losing upwards

202

of $25 million USD per week [9].

203

204

However, to mitigate large anticipated surges in hospitalizations and deaths over the coming months,

205

US hospitals need to sustainably absorb increases in patients requiring hospitalization and intensive

206

care, while continuing to care for non-COVID patients. After a statement from the American College

207

of Surgeons (ACS), many hospitals across the country ceased elective surgery to free beds and limit

208

patient exposure. While cancelling elective surgical cases has increased capacity, the financial

209

impact of these surgeries, including relative financial contribution by case type, has not been

210

described. Furthermore, the epidemiology of the deferred elective surgical cases, case counts, and

211

their resultant contribution to bed capacity has not been described.

212

213

We estimate the financial implications of cancelling elective surgeries using a national insurance

214

claim database, Truven MarketScan (MS). This information can be used to inform strategies for

215

resuming elective surgical procedures. We describe regional differences in capacity of US hospitals

216

to absorb COVID-related inpatient surges if measures are not taken to slow the spread, describe

217

elective case distribution, and present the relative financial impact and case counts of resumption of

218

elective surgical cases.

219

METHODS

221

Our analysis is reported according to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in

222

Epidemiology (STROBE) Guidelines (Supplemental Methods) [10].

224

Data Source and Study Population

225

Gross inpatient hospital earnings, outpatient surgical earnings, and inpatient and ICU (I/ICU) beds

226

were estimated using Truven MarketScan (MS). MS billing data captured 8-16% of the entire US

227

population from 2013-2017. For every MS patient, we determined the total number of I/ICU days from

228

2008-2017 for 161 million (M) enrollees and aggregated visit counts by month, state, and major

229

diagnostic category (MDC). Elective surgery admissions were identified by surgery revenue codes not

230

associated with emergency revenue or provider codes. Admissions occurring within 30 days post-

231

elective (including outpatient) surgery were considered complications and categorized as resulting

232

from elective surgery. Gross earnings were aggregated by MDC codes and surgical (elective vs non9

234

status and missing categories.

235

236

Study Variables and Outcomes

237

MS data were used to report gross hospital earnings derived from inpatient admissions and outpatient

238

surgeries for each MDC category by elective vs non-elective surgical and non-surgical. We calculated

239

proportion of gross earnings from elective surgeries by state, and the proportion of I/ICU beds

240

unoccupied, and occupied by elective and emergent cases by state. The average number of

241

unoccupied beds was defined as the difference between the average number of I/ICU days and the

242

maximum number of I/ICU days in a given state. We used data from the Harvard Global Health

243

Institute (HGHI) to identify the total number of I/ICU patient beds per state and applied the proportion

244

from the MS data to obtain estimates of occupied beds [11].

245

246

The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) was used to

247

calculate the number of expected I/ICU beds occupied by age group [12]. We applied these age-

248

specific rates to 5% of each state’s population using 2018 U.S. Census Bureau age-specific

249

population estimates to calculate the number of expected hospitalizations and inpatient cases by

250

state [13]. We calculated lower bound (LB) and upper bound (UB) estimates based on the CDC’s

251

reported uncertainty.

252

253

Statistical Analysis

254

In order to estimate the financial implications of cancelling or resuming elective surgical cases, we

255

calculated the distribution of gross earnings by MDC code and then by elective and non-elective

256

surgical, and non-surgical classifications. To inform the balance of revenue and capacity generation,

257

we illustrate the effect of cancellation of elective surgical cases on hospital capacity by modeling a

258

scenario that may exist if 5% of the US population were infected with COVID-19. We constructed a

259

Generalized Richards Growth Model (GRM), which has been proven effective for capturing single

260

epidemic transmission dynamics, to describe a scenario that could happen in the absence of

261

limitation to the disease spread [14]. Our GRM assumed a 5% infection rate, 5.2-day doubling rate,

262

and 100-day period of disease progression. These values were based on current published rates and

263

do not account for variation in social distancing [15, 16].

264

265

We illustrated gross earnings by MDC code and by classification. We calculated the number of

266

hospitalized patients in each state during the simulated pandemic peak using 11-day inpatient and 9-

267

day ICU length of stay [5, 6, 17]. We then calculated the ratio of cases to total number of available

268

beds per state with and without removal of elective surgery.

269

270

RESULTS

271

Across the U.S. there were an average of 1,442,013 (Interquartile range [IQR]: 1,378,039, 1,507,994)

272

inpatient days per month and 104,265 ([IQR] 101,961, 104,842) ICU days per month in the MS

273

sample. Roughly 30% of these days were associated with elective surgery (Figure 1). We applied

274

these percentages to US Hospital data and classified beds as emergent, elective, and available. Of

275

735,996 hospital beds in the US, 351,369 were emergent, 136,264 were elective, and 248,363 were

276

available.

277

278

Financial Impact

279

Elective surgical cases contribute 78% (IQR of statewide variation 74, 80) to of the gross inpatient

280

and outpatient surgical earnings per year for hospitals represented in our sample, or 1.1 trillion US

281

dollars. This value varies by MDC from $488M to $231 billion (B) (median 39B; IQR 16B, 59B)

282

(Figure 2). Within each MDC, the percent of earnings from elective surgical cases varies from <27%

283

to 97% (median 68%; IQR 53, 86). When restricting our analyses to inpatient-derived revenue,

284

elective surgery accounted for 43% (IQR of statewide variation 40, 45) of total gross earnings, or

285

$254B. This value varies by MDC from <1% to 88%, ($25M to $80B). The relative financial

286

contribution of elective surgical cases varies regionally and has important financial implications for

287

hospital specific decisions on resumption of these elective procedures (Figure 3).

288

289

Case Counts

290

With the cancellation of elective surgery, there is a need to balance revenue generation with capacity

291

increases. Elective surgical procedures contribute 3B cases in the MS population, of which 7.9M are

292

inpatient. This varies by MDC (median 96M [IQR 47M, 224M], range 1.9M – 515M), of which 197396

293

(IQR 86781, 372544; range 915 - 2.4M) are inpatient. Elective musculoskeletal, circulatory and

294

digestive categories comprise 1.1B cases, of which 3.8M are inpatient. These three categories

295

together compose 13% of hospital admissions, but 23% ($142B) of inpatient gross earnings.

296

Including outpatient surgical cases, they compose 33% ($447B) of total inpatient and surgical-

297

outpatient hospital earnings.

298

299

Hospital and ICU Capacity

300

Cancelling elective surgeries adds significant capacity for new daily ICU admits (Figure 4A), but falls

301

short of the full capacity required when 5% of the population is infected over a relatively short period

302

of time and median ICU length of stay is 9 days (Figure 4B). Without cancelling elective surgery,

303

median state hospital and ICU capacity was 4967 (IQR 1867, 6100) beds, and 743 (IQR 254.94,

304

944.37) respectively. This increased to 7692 (IQR 2553, 9679) hospital beds, and 991 (IQR 298,

305

1197) ICU beds if elective surgeries were cancelled.

306

307

There is variability in hospital capacity by state. As modeled, states would have mean 3.4 patients

308

requiring admission per available ICU bed (IQR: 2.65 – 4.09) (Figure 4C). If we use the UB rates of

309

ICU provided by the CDC, this increases to mean 8.2 patients per bed (IQR: 6.33 – 9.67) (Figure

310

4E). Removing elective surgeries will alleviate some of this stress, with LB estimates of an average of

2.7 ICU patients per bed IQR (2.19 – 3.16) (Figure 4D) and UB estimates of an average 6.4 (IQR 5.3

312

– 7.6) (Figure 4F).

313

314

DISCUSSION

315

Using billing and utilization data to model the financial contribution of elective surgical cases to

316

hospital gross earnings, we demonstrate that cessation of elective musculoskeletal, cardiovascular

317

and digestive cases account for the largest loss of hospital gross earnings, at $447B or 33% of all

318

inpatient and surgical-outpatient revenue. In contrast, by case count, musculoskeletal, pregnancy,

319

and circulatory categories account for the greatest contribution of elective inpatient cases. Applying

320

case counts to the available hospital beds, cancelling elective surgeries at all US hospitals will

321

decrease ICU overcapacity from 340% to 270% (lower bound) or from 820% to 640% (upper bound)

322

assuming 5% of the U.S. population is infected as shown in our models, but at a financial cost. In light

323

of the significant contribution of elective surgeries to gross hospital earnings, selective resumption of

324

high contributing elective MDC categories may be a way to resume surgery in a financially

325

sustainable way when deemed safe.

326

327

Continued provision of care to patients with COVID-19 involves balancing increasing healthcare

328

capacity with sustaining revenue generation. Previous models have addressed the expected

329

healthcare burden of COVID-19 in various ways, but have not addressed revenue generation. To our

330

knowledge, ours is the first to report case distribution and financial contribution of elective surgeries.

331

We incorporated state specific billing data, reporting the relative contribution of elective surgeries to

332

gross hospital earnings, and case counts, by MDC code. Our study informs the relative financial and

333

capacity impact from selective resumption of elective cases. Further, we model the expected increase

334

in bed capacity from cancelling these surgeries. Tsai et al previously estimated 1.7 excess COVID-19

335

patients per hospital bed and 4 excess patients per critical care bed assuming a 40% cumulative

336

infection rate over 12 and 18 months, and an aggressive 50% bed availability [18]. Similarly, Murry

used occupancy data from Medicare and Medicaid patients to estimate a capacity gap of 17,000 ICU

338

beds and 64,000 hospital beds at peak infection assuming some measure of social distancing [19].

339

Our study differs from these by modeling disease transmission under a lower infection rate (5%) but

340

faster course (100 days) than Tsai et al, and in a worse-case scenario without complete shelter in

341

place orders, which 9 states do not currently have [20]. We also incorporated state-specific data for

342

elective case volume and temporal variation. We demonstrated substantial state-level variation in

343

overcapacity. This suggests an opportunity for regional cooperation and resource redistribution.

344

345

Our results are generated using a financial denominator of total inpatient revenue plus outpatient

346

surgical cases, and do not account for the Medicare population that is not insured by Part C. We

347

determined overcapacity values using consistent rates of infection across the population in less than

348

100 days and assumptions that regional rates are equal [7, 18, 19]. It is important to note that we

349

applied rates of disease progression from regions prior to enforced distancing. Consistent with this,

350

we assumed a stable rate of disease progression of 100 days since first case and do not account for

351

policy responses to the pandemic, such as closure of non-essential service and stay-at-home orders,

352

which are highly variable across states.

CONCLUSIONS

355

Elective inpatient surgeries account for and account 27% of hospital and ICU beds and 43% of gross

356

earnings, which varies substantially by specialty. Among elective cases, musculoskeletal,

357

cardiovascular and digestive MDC categories account for the largest contribution to hospital gross

358

earnings, at 33%. The greatest contribution of bed capacity comes from musculoskeletal, pregnancy

359

and circulatory categories. The cancellation of elective surgery will result in a substantial increase in

360

hospital and ICU bed capacity, though this will vary between states, and at significant financial cost.
