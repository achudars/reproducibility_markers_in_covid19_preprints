Key Points
Question: Can a multi-faceted approach lead to control of COVID-19 transmission and spread
on an urban campus?
Findings: Despite a second wave of SARS-CoV-2 in the greater Boston area, Boston University
was able to minimize outbreaks by means of active surveillance of campus populations, isolation
of infected individuals, early, effective contact tracing and quarantine, regular communication,
excellent data systems, and strong leadership. Most transmission appeared to occur off campus
and there was no evidence of classroom transmission.
Meaning: Using the main axioms of infection control including frequent testing, vigorous
contact tracing, and rapid isolation and quarantine, and a strong leadership structure to ensure
nimble decision-making and rapid adaption to emerging data, controlling the transmission and
spread of SARS-CoV-2 on an urban campus was feasible despite worsening local transmission
during the course of the semester.

Abstract
Importance: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has severely disrupted United
States educational institutions. Given potential adverse financial psychosocial effects of campus
closures, many institutions developed strategies to reopen campuses in the fall despite the
ongoing threat of COVID-19. Many however opted to have limited campus re-opening in order
to minimize potential risk of spread of SARS-CoV-2.
Objective: To analyze how Boston University (BU) fully reopened its campus in the fall of 2020
and controlled COVID-19 transmission despite worsening transmission in the city of Boston.
Design: Multi-faceted intervention case study.
Setting: Large urban university campus.
Interventions: The BU response included a high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing facility
with capacity to delivery results in less than 24 hours; routine asymptomatic screening for
COVID-19; daily health attestations; compliance monitoring and feedback; robust contact
tracing, quarantine and isolation in on campus facilities; face mask use; enhanced hand hygiene;
social distancing recommendations; de-densification of classrooms and public places; and
enhancement of all building air systems.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Between August and December 2020, BU conducted >500,000
COVID-19 tests and identified 719 individuals with COVID-19: 496 (69.0%) students, 11
(1.5%) faculty, and 212 (29.5%) staff. Overall, about 1.8% of the BU community tested positive.
Of 837 close contacts traced, 86 (10.3%) tested positive for COVID-19. BU contact tracers
identified a source of transmission for 51.5% of cases with 55.7% identifying a source outside of
BU. Among infected faculty and staff with a known source of infection, the majority reported a
transmission source outside of BU (100% for faculty and 79.8% for staff). A BU source was

identified by 59.2% of undergraduate students and 39.8% of graduate students; notably no
transmission was traced to a classroom setting.
Conclusions and Relevance: BU was successful in containing COVID-19 transmission on
campus while minimizing off campus acquisition of COVID-19 from the greater Boston area. A
coordinated strategy of testing, contact tracing, isolation and quarantine, with robust
management and oversight, can control COVID-19 transmission, even in an urban university
setting.

INTRODUCTION
The SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic resulted in nearly 1.8 million deaths worldwide in 2020.1
The initial surge of United States cases had a devastating impact on universities and colleges due
to widespread campus closures in spring 2020.2 Faced with serious financial challenges and
adverse social impacts associated with continued closure, some universities developed multilayered COVID-19 risk mitigation strategies to allow campuses to reopen during the fall
semester.3,4

Boston University (BU) is a private university with a student/staff/faculty population of ~40,000
individuals located in the heart of a large US city, a scenario for potential widespread COVID-19
transmission. Despite these challenges, the BU administration pursued an aggressive risk
mitigation strategy involving widespread asymptomatic screening for COVID-19, environmental
modifications, classroom de-densification, and contact tracing, isolation and quarantine, in order
to allow its students to return to in-person learning in the 2020 fall semester. Here we describe
the BU experience as a case study offering important lessons that may be broadly applicable to
other higher education institutions.

METHODS
Initial planning, starting in March 2020, centered on active surveillance for asymptomatic and
symptomatic cases via on-site molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2 (Supplement). This involved
setting up systems for high-throughput laboratory testing, timely communication of results, rapid
contact tracing, isolation of infected individuals, and quarantine of close contacts (Figure 1).

Surveillance was complemented by additional control measures, including mask use, enhanced
hygiene practices, social distancing recommendations, daily health attestations, de-densification
of classrooms and public places, and enhancement of all building air systems. This process was
aided by mathematical modeling, multiple data systems, 24 hour/7 day per week monitoring, and
data-driven strategy refinements throughout the semester. This required a coordinated leadership
and management structure (Figure S1), through interlocking management committees and
leadership groups and communication strategies.

Setting
BU, a large urban university in Boston, has two campuses: the larger main campus (Charles
River Campus [CRC]) with over 30,000 members, and a smaller medical campus (BU Medical
Campus [BUMC] consisting of the Schools of Dentistry, Graduate Medical Sciences, Medicine,
and Public Health) with nearly 10,000 members. In fall 2019, there were 11,439 students living
on campus, 23,150 off campus, 10,514 staff and 4,169 faculty (faculty and staff numbers exclude
overseas operations).

Management
Starting in spring 2020, several groups were convened to coordinate COVID-19 control efforts
on campus, including monitoring incoming data, modifying campus operations, implementing
best public health and medical practices, surveillance, and budgeting (Supplement 1.1, Figure
S1).

BU implemented hybrid teaching in which all undergraduate and graduate students could attend
classes in-person or remotely. This allowed classes to simultaneously accommodate on-line only
students using Zoom software and in-person students.5 Older faculty or those with high-risk
medical conditions could opt for on-line only teaching.

BU SARS-CoV-2 Testing
Testing laboratory. BU developed its own polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing laboratory.
Test site staff observed anterior nasal swab sample self-collection by students, faculty, and staff
(Supplement 1.2, 1.3).

Information Technology. A system was developed by the University’s Information Services and
Technology experts linking electronic medical record systems for students, faculty, and staff, and
the laboratory information system in the testing facility with the web-based system for daily
symptom attestation of all community members on campus, reservations for tests and negative
test reporting.

SARS-CoV-2 testing categories. Based on guidance from public health authorities, the
University developed four SARS-CoV-2 testing categories, reflecting different risks of exposure.
These categories determined testing frequency, ranging from twice weekly for category 1 (e.g.,
on-campus undergraduates) to no testing for category 4 (e.g., students, faculty, or staff entirely
off-campus) (Supplement 1.4).

Managing and responding to test results. All individuals with a negative test were automatically
notified by email to access their test results through a secure website. University health staff
directly contacted individuals who tested positive.

Contact Tracing
The contact tracing protocol was based on CDC and Massachusetts Community Tracing
Collaborative processes6,7, with adaptation from BU academic programs and student input.
Contact tracers followed a detailed script to identify all close contacts, which were defined as
someone within six feet of an infected person for 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period
(Supplement 1.5).

Isolation and Quarantine
Students who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 had to isolate for 10 days after symptom onset
and resolution of fever for at least 24 hours, and with improvement of other symptoms, or for 10
days from the positive test date if asymptomatic.8 Students identified as a close contact had to
quarantine for 14 days from the exposure date. Based on evolving data from the CDC, this period
was reduced to 10 days of quarantine on November 20th.9 Such students living on campus were
moved to special dorms operated by BU (650 units for quarantine and 342 for isolation)
(Supplement 1.6-1.8).

Additional Campus Control Measures
Additional measures including face mask use, enhanced hand hygiene, social distancing
recommendations, daily health attestations, de-densification of classrooms and public places, and

enhancement of all building air systems including optimization of filtration units were
implemented (Supplement 1.9-1.10).

Mathematical Modeling
We used probabilistic SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) transmission modeling
during summer 2020 to understand the expected relative efficacy of interventions for reducing
COVID-19 transmission in the BU community with the goal of achieving only linear increases of
cases from transmission outside BU (Supplement 1.11). We used a stochastic agent-based model,
implemented using the COVID agent-based simulator (covasim) framework.10

Communications, Surveillance and data management
BU developed a dedicated COVID-19 external communications platform called Back2BU.11 The
pre-existing ecosystem of data warehousing and analysis systems was augmented to support the
data storage, management, and analysis requirements necessary to allow for near-real time
surveillance of BU’s COVID-19 response. Surveillance efforts focused on monitoring not only
standard metrics around incidence, isolation, and quarantine, but also testing, contact tracing, and
compliance with campus control measures. An external dashboard was created and updated daily
to allow anyone to track BU metrics (Supplement 1.12-1.15). In addition, an augmented, internal
dashboard was created to aid the various groups working with BU leadership to monitor and
adapt the BU COVID-19 response.

Compliance with testing and attestation of symptoms were tracked electronically from October.
The dean of students collected reports of violations of campus mandates, including gatherings,
masking, and physical distancing (Supplement 1.16). Spot checks of compliance were conducted
in parallel using trained observers (Supplement 1.17).

Fall 2020 Move-In
A comprehensive staggered return to campus scheduled was adopted to reduce crowding and
lines, giving students the time to test and the university the time to respond to any positive cases
on arrival (Supplement 1.18).

Ethics
The plan for this analysis was reviewed by the Boston University CRC Institutional Review
Board (IRB) and was classified as non-human subjects research. The BUMC IRB reviewed the
safe behavior quality improvement project (Supplement 1.17) and determined it to be exempt.

RESULTS
We structure our results to provide information on the operational aspects of the systems BU
developed to manage the epidemic and resulting epidemiological features of COVID-19 on the
university campus and in the surrounding community. In general, we describe results during the
semester: September 3-December 19, 2020; however, we include some results from initialization
of systems during the summer.

Overall, the systems designed in the summer to mitigate the pandemic performed well
throughout fall semester.

Housing. While 99% (7266) of graduate students lived off-campus, most undergraduates lived in
on-campus housing, including a total of 7,131 students as of October 13, 2020, representing 67%
of the fall 2020 capacity. Due to de-densification efforts, 3453 (48%) of students lived alone and
3678 (52%) of students lived with one roommate (Supplement 1.5).

Testing. Initial operations, staffing and supplies aimed for a maximum of 6200 tests per day
(~42,000 tests per week) and to turn around results within 24 hours of collection. The laboratory
reached a stable run rate by October, averaging 5-6,000 tests per day, with lower volume on
weekends. Testing turnaround times decreased dramatically over the semester, leveling off to
around 12-15 hours between sample collection to receipt of results (Figure 2A). The BU testing
laboratory conducted 467,382 tests during the fall semester (517,357 including the pre-semester
move-in).

Contact Tracing, Quarantine and Isolation. On average within 6.4 hours (median: 3.0, range: 042 hours) after receipt of a positive test, close contacts of a positive BU case were notified of
their exposure. However, this average conceals improvements over time, falling from ~10.1
hours in September to 5.4 in December 2020. Students and employees (faculty and staff)
identified 3.1 and 0.5 BU close contacts per case on average, respectively. The number of
individuals needing to be traced increased with increasing case numbers throughout the semester
(Figure 2B).

Despite having quarantine and isolation capacities of 650 and 342 respectively, occupancy only
reached a maximum of 13.7% and 12.9% respectively at any one time (Figure S3).

Compliance. On average 12% of on-campus students were non-compliant with testing or
attestation protocols in October and November, lower than off campus students during the same
time (51.5% for off campus students in categories 1, 2 and 3 or 20% if including students in
category 4) (Figure 3A). Reported violations were most common as the semester began, but
gradually tapered off (Figure 3B). Early semester violations were largely off-campus gatherings,
which reduced sharply by November. Compliance with face masks was high throughout the
semester.

Classroom Density. Class attendance data were not collected systematically. An upper bound on
attendance levels is given by the percentage of registered students indicating through LfA that
they would attend in person. For medium, large, and “very large” classes, this number was on
average approximately 45% in October (with medians similar) but dropped to roughly 25-30% in
November. For small classes, while the mean was similar to the other groups, the variability was
substantially greater (Figure 4).

Epidemiology of COVID-19 at BU and in Boston
Changing epidemiology of COVID-19 in Boston. Following statewide control measures in spring
2020, case numbers in Suffolk County (which includes Boston) averaged approximately 0.1 case
per 1000 population through mid-October. As state restrictions eased and the weather became

colder (and people spent more time indoors), cases increased to 0.4/1000 by early November,
peaking at 0.75/1000 following Thanksgiving gatherings (Figure 2C). These increasing trends
were observed statewide and also in collection of SARS-CoV-2 from Boston area wastewater,
indicating that they were not just due to increased testing in the Boston area.13,14

COVID-19 Burden and Patterns at BU. During the fall semester, 719 individuals tested positive
for COVID-19 in the BU community including 496 (69.0%) students, 11 (1.5%) faculty, and 212
(29.5%) staff (Table 1). Cases increased following holidays, particularly Thanksgiving, and
concentrated among undergraduate students and non-faculty staff. While the incidence rate
among students and staff tracked that of Suffolk County (Figure 2C), there were two distinctions.
First, BU surveillance testing detected many asymptomatic cases (37.7% of our total cases),
whereas testing elsewhere in Massachusetts was passive and driven by emergent symptoms.
Secondly, particularly after Thanksgiving, the BU increase in cases preceded that of Suffolk
county. This is most likely attributable to BU’s vigorous testing regime.

Of the students who were close contacts and entered quarantine, 10.3% (86/837) tested positive
for SARS-CoV-2 while in quarantine. The test positivity rate for those who self-attested having
symptoms was notably higher (4.9%) than that of asymptomatic individuals (0.10%) indicating
utility of this feature.

Sources and locations of transmission. BU contact tracers identified a transmission source for
51.5% of cases with 55.7% identifying a source outside BU (Table 1). Among infected faculty
and staff with a known source of infection, the overwhelming majority reported a transmission

source outside of BU (100% for faculty and 79.8% for staff). Students identified more BU
contacts as infection sources (39.8% for graduate students and 59.2% undergraduate students,
Table 1). Notably, BU household contacts were identified as a source of infection less than 1%
of the time (Table 1) and anecdotally, there were no sustained transmission events in on-campus
housing, indicative of the efficacy of efforts to control spread in campus housing. When asked to
identify close contacts, students rarely identified classmates. Instead, close contacts tended to be
friends and, after Thanksgiving, family (Figure 2D). This indicates that while BU students
tended to be more likely to identify another BU affiliate as a source of infection, the contacts
leading to infection occurred in places out of reach of BU’s interventions.

DISCUSSION
Although many US higher education institutions reopened in fall 2020, some experienced large
COVID-19 outbreaks forcing a return to on-line only education.15–17 The BU experience is
important because it has an urban campus in a community that experienced high and increasing
COVID-19 incidence from August to December 2020 with no option for the university to isolate
from the wider community. Despite this, BU benefited from substantial resources including
funding to establish and run a SARS-CoV-2 testing laboratory and sampling centers, a hybrid
learning approach (LfA), and diverse expertise among university employees in medical
epidemiology, modeling, biostatistics, and public health control measures. In addition, strong
central leadership; internal communication to students, staff, and faculty; frequent and adaptive
testing of students18,19; short testing turnaround time; highly effective contact tracing coupled
with isolation and quarantine; and vigorous enforcement combined to prevent widespread
campus outbreaks of COVID-19 despite the worsening local situation.

Strong leadership structure with multiple subcommittees targeting important aspects of the
response supported the interventions. Frequent communication and coordination between these
groups ensured that, if a cluster of cases was emerging, all parties were aware. Thus, testing
cadences could be adapted, compliance efforts modified, and messaging adapted to blunt any
outbreak risk. This coordinated effort was key to ensuring a high level of compliance and the
success of planned interventions.

Short turnaround time of results followed by rapid isolation of infected individuals, contact
tracing and quarantine of close contacts resulted in limited transmission in the BU community.
Faculty and staff were almost always infected outside of the university campus. While most
students with a known source of infection reported another BU affiliate as their contact, these
infectious events appeared to occur outside of BU housing and instructional settings, where
interventions were targeted. When case clusters appeared in settings the university could not
directly target, e.g., social or other off campus gatherings, these were quickly controlled, due to
our vigorous testing regime, rapid contact tracing, and strict enforcement measures.
Consequently, no major outbreaks were observed and the resulting numbers of cases throughout
the semester were consistent with our goal of maintaining a linear, rather than exponential,
increase in cases, which was manageable with our intervention strategies.

Surveillance testing facilitated identification and isolation of many close contacts ahead of
contact tracing efforts. Importantly, due to the surveillance testing system, BU tended to detect
increases in cases before the surrounding community where people were mostly only tested once

symptomatic. This is supported by the fact that 37.7% of positive individuals were asymptomatic
at the time of isolation indicating that BU was detecting cases early in the disease course. This
finding contradicts recently published research suggesting that BU cases led the surrounding area
in a causal manner.20 Limitations to the latter study include the inclusion criteria resulting in only
one Boston-area institution in the analysis and assuming that community transmission arose from
the university campus rather than the converse.

BU’s success is consistent with current understanding of best COVID-19 control practices.
These strategies, aggressive testing, contact tracing, and quarantine and isolation, have been
successfully implemented in many countries, including Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan.21–23
However, unlike these countries, the BU setting did not allow restriction of travel between the
campus and nearby community, making this a strong demonstration of the utility of these
approaches despite substantial importation of cases from the surrounding community. This can
potentially serve as a model for other institutions nested within a broader community.

There were some challenges. Sometimes the contact tracing team was unable to identify contacts
due to students’ reluctance to divulge information regarding where they had been or who they
had been with. In these cases, coordination between the dean of students and the contact tracing
team was critical in identifying other students who were associated with the infected student(s)
through team or club membership, so increased frequency of testing (adaptive testing) could be
performed.

BU’s approach carries a high financial cost24; BU had to implement budget adjustments,
including hiring freezes, salary freezes, and several other cost-cutting measures, to meet the cost
of these supplemental services and respond to declining revenue because of pandemic-related
changes to operations. Ultimately the university was able to meet its financial obligations and
avoid large layoffs or other consequential financial impacts. Also, providing students an inperson option was beneficial for varying learning styles and meeting immigration requirements.
The remote option also benefitted students who could not attend in person, either due to health
considerations or travel restrictions.

BU benefited from being a large research university with much of the required expertise for our
strategy available within the university, saving money and facilitating substantial control over
the operations. This is clearly not feasible for all higher education institutions. This implies that
broader efforts in the community, supported by government public health agencies, are required
to control spread. In summary, a multipronged response effectively controlled SARS-CoV-2
spread on an urban university campus, despite rising community burden of disease.
