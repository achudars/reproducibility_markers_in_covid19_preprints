Abstract (325 words)
Importance: The ACE D allele is more prevalent among African Americans (AA) compared to other
races/ethnicities and has previously been associated with severe COVID-19 pathogenesis through excessive
ACE1 activity. ACE-I/ARBs may counteract this mechanism, but their association with COVID-19
outcomes has not been specifically tested in the AA population.
Objectives: To determine whether the use of ACE-I/ARBs is associated with COVID-19 in-hospital
mortality in AA compared with non-AA population.
Design, Setting, and Participants: In this observational, retrospective study, patient-level data were
extracted from the Mount Sinai Health System’s (MSHS) electronic medical record (EMR) database, and
6,218 patients with a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis from February 24 to May 31, 2020 were
identified as ACE-I/ARB users.
Exposures: Patients with an active prescription from January 1, 2019 up to the date of admission for ACEI/ARB (outpatient use) and patients administered ACE-I/ARB during hospitalization (in-hospital use) were
identified.
Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, assessed in the entire,
AA, and non-AA population.
Results: Of the 6,218 COVID-19 patients, 1,138 (18.3%) were ACE-I/ARB users. In a multivariate logistic
regression model, ACE-I/ARB use was independently associated with reduced risk of in-hospital mortality
in the entire population (OR, 0.655; 95% CI, 0.505-0.850; P=0.001), AA population (OR, 0.44; 95% CI,
0.249-0.779; P=0.005), and non-AA population (OR, 0.748, 95% CI, 0.553-1.012, P=0.06). In the AA
population, in-hospital use of ACE-I/ARBs was associated with improved mortality (OR, 0.378; 95% CI,
0.188-0.766; P=0.006) while outpatient use was not (OR, 0.889; 95% CI, 0.375-2.158; P=0.812). When
analyzing each medication class separately, ARB in-hospital use was significantly associated with reduced
in-hospital mortality in the AA population (OR, 0.196; 95% CI, 0.074-0.516; P=0.001), while ACE-I use
was not associated with impact on mortality in any population.
Conclusion and Relevance: In-hospital use of ARBs was associated with a significant reduction in inhospital mortality among COVID-19-positive AA patients. These results support further investigation of
ARBs to improve outcomes in AA patients at high risk for COVID-19-related mortality.

Introduction
The current COVID-19 pandemic is expected to reduce USA life expectancy in 2020 by 1.13 years,
although life expectancy reductions in African American (AA) and Hispanic populations are estimated to
be 3 to 4 times higher than among Caucasians.1 While the U.S. African American and Hispanic individuals
make up approximately 13.4% and 18.5% of the US population, respectively, they constitute roughly 21%
and 22%, respectively, of COVID-19 deaths reported to the National Center for Health Sciences (NCHS).2
Socioeconomic factors contribute to these disparities, with 19.7% AA and 16.2% Hispanic individuals,
disproportionately represented among essential occupations.3 However, it remains unclear whether
population differences in the prevalence of genetic risk variants may also contribute to disparate outcomes.
Several studies have attempted to delineate the genetic basis of susceptibility to COVID-19 clinical
syndromes.4–7 Epidemiological analyses have suggested that polymorphisms in the ACE gene, which
encodes the angiotensin converting enzyme 1 (ACE1), are related to the incidence and mortality from
COVID-19 at the national level.8–11 The insertion (I) or deletion (D) of a 287 base pair sequence in intron
16 of the ACE gene results in three possible genotypes: DD or II homozygotes, or ID heterozygotes. The D
allele has been associated with increased ACE1 expression in a dose-dependent manner, such that compared
to II homozyogtes, ID heterozygotes and DD homozygotes have 31% and 65% more ACE1 protein
expression in blood serum, respectively.12 Data from predominantly European nations suggests that there
is a population-level correlation between the prevalence of the D allele and incidence of COVID-19.10
The SARS-CoV-2 virus enters cells by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE1
and ACE2 have counter-regulatory roles in the renin-angiotensin (RAS) system: ACE1 converts
angiotensin I to angiotensin-II, the primary effector of the RAS system, while ACE2 inactivates
angiotensin-II. Since SARS-CoV-2 viral binding and entry via ACE2 leads to decreased ACE2 availability,
it has been hypothesized that an imbalance in ACE1 and ACE2 activity (leading to excess angiotensin-II)
may contribute to the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19.13 This imbalance may be further exacerbated by
increased ACE1 expression in the presence of the ACE D allele. This mechanistic hypothesis predicts that
either ACE1 inhibition or angiotensin-II receptor blockade would have a beneficial effect on COVID-19
outcomes, especially in populations with high prevalence of the ACE D allele.13
Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, there were concerns that ACE inhibitors (ACE-I) and
angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), commonly used to manage hypertension, might increase ACE2
expression and thus increase susceptibility to COVID-19. Since then, several groups have assessed the
relationship between ACE-I/ARB use and COVID-19 outcomes, with no clear consensus on risk versus
benefit.14–16 However, these studies were conducted in predominantly Caucasian populations, were focused
on estimating risk of COVID-19, and did not account for ethnicity and the ACE D allele prevalence.
Differences in the frequency of continuing or discontinuing ACE-1/ARB across hospitalized patients may

also have contributed to discrepancies between studies.17 These results supported the joint statement issued
by expert cardiology societies that, in the absence of experimental or clinical information demonstrating
benefit or adverse outcomes, individuals using ACE-I/ARB medications should continue their medications
during COVID-19 infection.18
We recently reported that there was an increased prevalence of the ACE D allele among African
Americans compared to other races and ethnicities.13 We therefore hypothesized that there may be a more
pronounced benefit from ACE-I/ARB therapy in the AA population compared to prior published cohorts.
This study assessed whether ACE-I/ARB use among hospitalized AA patients with COVID-19 was
associated with clinical benefit and improved outcome.

Methods
Data source and COVID-19 cohort
This observational, retrospective cohort study utilized deidentified electronic medical record data
(EMR data; EPIC systems, Verona, WI) from the Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS). We identified 6,218
patients who met the admission criteria due to COVID-19 admitted to hospital (including emergency room
visits and inpatient admissions) related to COVID-19 at a Mount Sinai facility from February 24 through
May 31, 2020. Encounters were considered COVID-19-related if a COVID-19 test was ordered or a
COVID-19 diagnosis was assigned. COVID-19 was diagnosed by real-time reverse-transcriptase PCRbased clinical tests from nasopharyngeal swab specimens.
We extracted patient demographics from the EMR including age, sex, and self-identified
race/ethnicity. Race and ethnicity were summarized into the mutually exclusive categories of African
American (AA), Asian, Hispanic, White, Unknown, and Other. We retrieved disease comorbidities from
the database including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea,
obesity, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, HIV infection, cancer, coronary artery disease, atrial
fibrillation, heart failure, chronic viral hepatitis, and alcoholic nonalcoholic liver disease. Additionally, we
extracted laboratory test orders and results from the encounters including white blood cell (WBC),
creatinine, anion gap, potassium and alanine transaminase (ALT). We also retrieved the initial vital sign
measurements for each encounter, including BMI, temperature, O2 saturation, heart rate, respiratory rate,
and blood pressure (BP).
ACE-I/ARB, other antihypertensive medications and outcomes
We defined ACE-I/ARB exposure as an active prescription from January 1, 2019, up to and
including hospitalization for COVID-19 (“anytime use”), with 18.3% in our SARS-CoV-2 positive

inpatient population; while 9.4% patients were prescribed ACE-I/ARB in our general population in our
EMR system from January 1, 2019 to May 31, 2020. We identified 1,139 anytime use patients and divided
them into two subsets: 1) documented ACE-I/ARB administration during their hospitalization (“in-hospital
use”, N=605), and 2) ACE-I/ARB use prior to admission but not during hospitalization (“outpatient use”,
N=534). We also traced other antihypertensive medications (calcium-channel blockers, beta blockers, and
diuretics) dispensed from January 1, 2019 till May 31, 2020, that were included in the medication history
or usage. We have listed all the antihypertensive medications in Table S1 in the supplement.
The primary outcome was COVID-19 caused in-hospital mortality in the entire population and in
the AA sub-population. There were three possible outcomes for each hospital encounter: in-hospital
mortality, discharge, or continued hospitalization (right censored). The secondary outcomes are intensive
care unit (ICU) admission and acute kidney injury (AKI), which were evaluated in the AA population as
sub-analysis.
We assessed the associations between ACE-I/ARB anytime use, in-hospital use, or outpatient use
and COVID-19 in-hospital mortality for the entire population, AA population, or non-AA population
compared with patients who were not on ACE-I/ARB. We defined the outpatient use if patients were
prescribed ACE-I/ARB during their outpatient visits but without continued in-hospital use, and the inhospital use if patients continued or were administered ACE-I/ARB. These analyses were also repeated for
ACE-I use and ARB use; exposure to either class of medication was determined without regard to exposure
to the other class.
Statistical Analysis
We described continuous variables as their medians and interquartile ranges (IQR), or means and
standard deviations (SD). We described categorical variables as a number and percentage (%). We
measured statistical differences with Kruskal-Wallis or two sample t-test for continuous variables and Chisquare test for categorical variables, respectively.
We evaluated the ACE-I/ARB associations with in-hospital mortality using multivariate logistic
regression adjusting for the following confounders: age, hospital stay duration, race, smoking status, BMI,
temperature, O2 saturation, heart rate, respiratory rate, hypertension, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea, obesity, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, HIV, cancer, coronary
artery disease, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, chronic viral hepatitis, liver disease, ICU stay, white blood
cell (WBC), creatinine, anion gap, potassium and alanine transaminase (ALT). We reported the adjusted
odds ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Statistical significance was defined as a two-sided
P<0.05, unless otherwise stated. We also applied the Wald-based power and sample size formulas for
logistic regression to calculate the power given the observed sample size.19 We used two-tailed test to

estimate the probability of event under the null hypothesis which was the in-hospital mortality rate and we
used the binomial distribution for the ACE-I/ARB with the prescription rate as the probability. We further
analyzed the interaction between ACE-I/ARB with AA race by adding the interaction term in the logistic
regression with adjustment by same potential confounders.
We employed inverse propensity-weighted logistic regression as a doubly robust method to balance
the potential confounders and further estimate the effect of ACE-I/ARB use on COVID-19 patient
outcomes. Specifically, we used the generalized boosted regression to compute propensity scores and
balance the covariates based on the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT), and then calculated the
adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence interval using multivariate logistic regression with the balanced
covariates. In all the analyses, cases with missing covariates were omitted. We performed all analysis using
R (version 4.0.1) and Python (version 3.7). This study is approved by IRB-17-01245.

Results
Participants
Our cohort included 6,218 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and admitted to one of five hospitals
using EPIC system in the Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS) from February 24 through May 31, 2020.
Among these patients, 1,139 (18.3%) were ACE-I/ARB users and 5,079 (81.7%) were ACE-I/ARB nonusers since 2019. The data extraction process and study workflow are shown in Figure 1. ACE-I/ARB
users were older than non-users (median age, 68 [IQR, 60-78] vs 60 [IQR, 43-72]) (Table 1). Compared
with non-users, ACE-I/ARB users were more likely to have cardiovascular comorbidities and risk factors
such as hypertension (60.6% vs 18.3%; P<0.001), diabetes mellitus (40.1% vs 11.3%; P<0.001), coronary
artery disease (24.0% vs 5.7%; P<0.001), and heart failure (16.3% vs 3.0%; P<0.001). ACE-I/ARBs users
were also more likely to use other antihypertensive medications such as calcium channel blockers (53.8%
vs 18.4%; P<0.001), beta blockers (47.7% vs 18.2%; P<0.001), and diuretics (56.4% vs 18.9%; P<0.001).
As of May 31, 2020, of the 6,218 patients in our COVID-19 cohort, 1,326 (21.3%) died, 4,384 (70.5%)
were discharged, and 508 (8.2%) were still hospitalized as of 31 May 2020.
African American (AA) patients comprised 26.2% of our COVID-19 cohort (1,621 patients).
Similar to the entire population, AA ACE-I/ARB users were older than ACE-I/ARB non-users (median
age, 66 [IQR 58-75] vs 59 [IQR 43-70]) and more likely to have disease comorbidities (Table 1). In the AA
population, 300 patients (18.4%) died, 1,187 patients (72.8%) were discharged, and 114 patients (8.8%)
were still hospitalized as of May 31, 2020. A comparison of the characteristics of the AA and non-AA
populations is presented in Table S2
ACE-I/ARB associations with in-hospital mortality overall and by race

Unadjusted mortality was higher in ACE-I/ARB users compared to non-users in both the entire
population (25.2% vs. 20.5%, P<0.001) and AA population (19.4% vs. 18.1%, P=0.296) (Table 1),
especially for hypertension, obesity, and diabetes, which are known risk factors to COVID mortality.20 We
therefore adjusted for these confounding factors in this population substantially enriched with chronic
conditions and observed that ACE-I/ARB use was independently associated with reduced risk of in-hospital
mortality in the entire population (OR, 0.655; 95% CI, 0.505-0.850; P=0.001) by the multivariable logistic
regression model (Table 2). Although the interaction term of ACE-I/ARB use and AA population is not
significant (OR, 0.736; 95% CI, 0.428-1.266; P=0.268), the odds of in-hospital death in AA population who
received ACE-I/ARB is smaller compared to non-AA population who also received ACE-I/ARB (OR,
0.659) (Table S2). When stratified by sub-population, there was a significant reduction in in-hospital
mortality in the AA population (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.249-0.779; P=0.005), and did not reach significance
in the non-AA population (OR, 0.748; 95% CI, 0.553-1.012; P=0.06) with the power 1-b = 0.8 in the Waldbased power analysis. The prescription ratio of ACE-I/ARB was similar between the AA and non-AA
population (Table S3). We confirmed this result using inverse propensity-weighted logistic regression after
balancing for confounders: ACE-I/ARB use was significantly associated with decreased risk of in-hospital
mortality in the entire population (OR, 0.673; 95% CI, 0.511-0.886; P=0.005), the AA population (OR,
0.381; 95% CI, 0.204-0.712; P=0.003), but not the non-AA population (OR, 0.765; 95% CI, 0.556-1.052;
P=0.1)
ACE-I/ARB use among African Americans did not impact secondary outcomes
In the AA population, since we identified the significant association between ACE-I/ARB use and
in-hospital mortality, we further estimated the effects of ACE-I/ARB use on two secondary outcomes:
intensive care unit (ICU) admission and acute kidney injury (AKI) development. Unadjusted rates of these
outcomes were higher among AA ACE-I/ARB users than AA non-users (Death: 19.4% vs. 18.1%, P=0.296;
ICU: 17.5% vs. 12.7%, P=0.03; AKI: 9.9% vs. 5.8%, P=0.01) (Table 1). Neither ICU admission (OR, 0.709;
95% CI, 0.419-1.198; P=0.198) nor AKI (OR, 1.306; 95% CI, 0.721-2.364; P=0.379) were significantly
associated with ACE-I/ARB use in the AA population (Table S4). We confirmed these findings using
inverse propensity-weighted logistic regression as well, where again, ACE-I/ARB use was not significantly
associated with ICU admission (OR, 0.733; 95% CI, 0.425-1.264; P=0.264) or AKI (OR, 1.257; 95% CI,
0.642-2.463; P=0.505).
In-hospital ARB use reduced risk of COVID-19 caused in-hospital mortality
Given the significant impact ACE-I/ARB exposure had on in-hospital mortality of AA patients
admitted for COVID-19, we sought to distinguish between in-hospital use of these classes of drugs and outpatient use, and between the two classes of drugs. ACE-I/ARB in-hospital use was significantly associated

with reduced mortality in the entire population (OR, 0.575; 95% CI, 0.419-0.791; P=0.001), the AA
population (OR, 0.378; 95% CI, 0.188-0.766; P=0.006), and the non-AA population (OR, 0.652; 95% CI,
0.449-0.946; P=0.024) (Table 3). Outpatient ACE-I/ARB use alone was not significantly associated with
mortality in the entire population (OR, 1.016; 95% CI, 0.69-1.496; P=0.936), the AA population (OR,
0.889; 95% CI, 0.375-2.158; P=0.812), nor the non-AA population (OR, 1.101; 95% CI, 0.7-1.73;
P=0.677).
We additionally evaluated ACE-I use and ARB use separately and across different exposure periods
(anytime use, in-hospital use and outpatient use). ARB in-hospital use was significantly associated with
mortality in the entire population (OR, 0.560; 95% CI, 0.371-0.846; P=0.006), the AA population (OR,
0.196; 95% CI, 0.074-0.516; P=0.001), but not the non-AA population (OR, 0.687; 95% CI, 0.427-1.106;
P=0.122) which might be due to limited statistical power (1-b = 0.55 in the Wald-based power analysis)
(Figure 2); while ACE-I use was not significantly associated with mortality in any cohort nor any drug
exposure period (Figure S1). Again, the interaction term of ARB use and AA population is not significant
(OR, 0.488; 95%CI, 0/185-1.292); P=0.149), but the direction of the effect suggests AA population who
received ARB might have smaller odds (OR, 0.421) of in-hospital death compared to non-AA population
(Table S2). Outpatient use was not significantly associated with in-hospital mortality for either medication
class. We confirmed all the results with inverse propensity-weighted logistic regression (Table S5).

Discussion
In this retrospective study of a racially and ethnically diverse cohort from New York City
comprising 6,218 hospitalized COVID-19 patients seen between February 24 and March 31, 2020, we
found that ACE-I/ARB use was significantly associated with reduced in-hospital mortality, particularly
among African American (AA) patients. ACE-I/ARB users were older and had more comorbidities than
non-users, but after controlling for these adverse risk factors, in-hospital ACE-I/ARB use (as opposed to
outpatient-only use) was independently associated with improved outcomes. When analyzing ACE-I and
ARB exposures separately, in-hospital ARB use was significantly associated with improved outcomes
among AA patients but not non-AA patients. Conversely, ACE-I exposure was not independently
associated with outcomes in any cohort.
Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, the finding that SARS-CoV-2 enters cells by binding to the
ACE2 protein led to concern that ACE-Is and ARBs might impact SARS-CoV-2 infectivity or virulence.21
Many clinical studies from the USA, Europe, and China were subsequently reported, examining the
association between ACE-I/ARB use and COVID-19 outcomes. 22–24 These studies found that ACE-I/ARB
usage was associated with neither harm nor benefit in the setting of COVID-19 in Caucasian population,

however, one meta-analysis grouped studies by geography and found a lower mortality risk associated with
ACE-I/ARB use among studies from China (OR = 0.65; 95% CI, 0.46−0.91; P = 0.013),22 which might be
suggested by a higher ACE I/D allele frequency in Asian population.13,25–27 Whereas there was no
significant association among studies from the US or Europe, suggesting the need to account for race and
ethnicity. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report a potential benefit from the use of ACE-I/ARB
in AA population hospitalized with COVID-19 using the one of the largest EMR systems in NYC.
Race and ethnicity may be relevant in this context as a proxy for genetic ancestry and the probability
of carrying the ACE D-allele—the deletion allele of the ACE insertion/deletion polymorphism—which is
associated with increased ACE1 activity and may contribute to ACE1/ACE2 imbalance in SARS-CoV-2
infection. Epidemiological studies in European, North African, and Asian settings have found significant
positive correlations between D-allele prevalence and COVID-19 infection and mortality rates at the
population level.8–11,27 While it is not practical at present to determine the ACE genotype of large cohorts
of COVID-19 patients, the prevalence of the D-allele is known to vary geographically and is highest in
Africa and the Middle East.28 Therefore, race may serve as a proxy for probability of D-allele carrier status.
Indeed, we recently reported that African Americans have a higher prevalence of the D-allele than white
Americans.13
With this premise in mind, we investigated the interaction between AA race and ACE-I/ARB use
in relation to inpatient COVID-19 outcomes. Individuals carrying the D-allele would be expected to have
excessive ACE1 and angiotensin-II in the context of COVID-19 infection and may thus derive benefit from
either ACE1 inhibition by ACE-Is, or angiotensin-II blockade via ARB.13 Using a multi-ethnic cohort of
6,218 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, we found a significant association between ACE-I/ARB use and
reduced in-hospital mortality overall; this association appeared to be driven by a strong protective
association between ACE-I/ARB use and in-hospital mortality in the AA (but not the non-AA) population
though the interaction between ACE-I/ARB use and race was not significant. While our ability to detect a
significant interaction may have been limited by sample size, these findings are consistent with the
hypothesis that RAS hyperactivity in an ACE D-allele-enriched (e.g., African American) COVID-19
positive cohort may benefit from ACE-I/ARB use.13
We further analyzed ACE-I or ARB use separately and according to either outpatient or in-hospital
exposure. Neither in-hospital nor outpatient ACE-I use was associated with mortality. Conversely, inhospital ARB use was significantly associated with reduced mortality among AAs but not non-AAs. This
may suggest that ACE1 inhibition alone is inadequate in the context of ACE2 occupation/down-regulation
by SARS-CoV-2 virions; excess angiotensin-II may still accumulate in the absence of sufficient ACE2
activity. Inhibiting downstream angiotensin-II type 1 receptors (AT1R) using ARB may therefore be more
effective. Mechanistic and clinical studies to dissect the relationships between COVID-19, ACE1/ACE2

activity, angiotensin-II levels, and ARB are warranted. Attention should be paid to underlying ACE
genotype in studies of RAS inhibitors in COVID-19 moving forward. The ongoing randomized clinical trial
of ramipril against placebo to treat COVID-19 patients (NCT04366050) may provide insightful data on the
therapeutic value of ACE inhibitors.29
Prior clinical studies in US population have examined associations between ACE-I/ARB use and
COVID-19 outcomes without stratification by race.16,30–32 Most of these studies have found no association
between ACE-I/ARB use and outcomes such as hospitalization, ICU admission, or in-hospital mortality.
However, these cohorts had a substantially higher proportion of Caucasian (45-70%) patients than ours
(23.3%). One exception was the study by Lam et al., which found lower rates of ICU admission and
mortality among patients who continued rather than discontinued ACE-I/ARB treatment upon admission
for COVID-19.30 The Lam et al. cohort was predominantly Caucasian (61.2%) but there was a large fraction
of patients of “Other ethnicity” (26.2%), which could have influenced the overall D-allele prevalence in the
cohort. Taken together, these results suggest that race and ethnicity—while imperfect as surrogates of Dallele prevalence—should be accounted for when assessing ACE-I/ARB associations with COVID-19.
Limitations
Our study has several limitations. It was a retrospective study and cannot establish a causal
relationship between ACE-I/ARB and COVID-19 outcomes via the ACE D-allele without individual-level
germline genetic data and prospective treatment assignment. Secondly, our study is based on a single center
experience and these analyses should be repeated in other cohorts. Finally, while outpatient medication
adherence could not be verified, this EMR dataset draws on multiple data sources to bolster accuracy and
comprehensiveness.
Conclusions
In conclusion, our results agree with current recommendations to continue ACE-I/ARB in
hospitalized COVID-19 patients provided there are no other contraindications. Our results also suggest a
potential benefit for ACE-I/ARB among African American patients with COVID-19. We hypothesize that
this is due to a higher ACE D-allele prevalence in the African American population. Further investigations
in COVID-19 cohorts with linked clinical and genomic data are warranted.
