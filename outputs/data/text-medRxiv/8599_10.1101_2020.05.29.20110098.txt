Summary
Background: Nigeria became the first sub Saharan African country to record a case
of COVID-19 after an imported case from Italy was confirmed on February 27, 2020.
Moving averages and the Epidemic Evaluation Indices (EEI) are two important but
complementary methods useful in monitoring epidemic trends, they can also serve as
a useful guide for policy makers and inform the timing of decisions on preventive
measures. The objectives of this paper are to graphically depict the trends of new
COVID-19 cases nationally and in two key States (Lagos and Kano) and the Federal
Capital Territory (FCT) using the moving averages and the EEI. In addition, we
examined the effects of government’s public health interventions on the spread of
COVID-19 and appraise the progress made so far in addressing the challenges of
COVID-19 in Nigeria.
Methods: We used data on new cases of COVID-19 from public sources released by
the Nigeria Center for Disease Control (NCDC) from the 27th February 2020, when
the first case was recorded, to 11th May, 2020, one week after the lockdowns in
Lagos and the FCT were lifted. We computed moving averages of various orders, the
log transformations of the moving averages and then the EEIs of new COVID-19
cases for Nigeria as a whole, and then for two of the most affected states i.e. Lagos
and Kano, as well as the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Then, we plotted graphs to
depict these indices and show the epidemic trends for COVID-19 in each scenario.
Results: Nationally, the number of new cases of COVID-19 showed an initial
gradual rise from the first reported case on the 27th February 2020. However, by the

second week in April, these numbers began to show a relatively sharper increase and
this trend has continued till date. Similar trends were observed in Lagos state and the
FCT. The rate of growth of the logarithm-transformed moving average in the period
leading to, and including the lockdowns reduced by a factor of 0.65. This suggests
that the policies put in place by the government including the lockdown measures in
Lagos and the FCT may have had a positive effect on the development of new cases
of COVID-19 in Nigeria. Nationally and in Lagos, the EEIs of the COVID-19 cases
started off on very high notes, however, the effects of the lockdown gradually
became evident by the end of April and early May 2020, as the EEIs headed closer to
1.0. In all case scenarios, the EEIs are still above 1.0.
Conclusions and recommendations:
The number of new cases of COVID-19 has been on a steady rise since the first
reported case. In Nigeria especially across the two states and the FCT, public health
interventions including the lockdown measures appear to have played a role in
reducing the rate of increase of new infections. The EEIs are still above 1.0,
suggesting that despite the progress that appears to have been made, the epidemic is
still evolving and Nigeria has not yet reached her peak for COVID-19 cases. We
recommend that aggressive public health interventions and restrictions against mass
gatherings should be sustained.
Introduction
The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2), first reported in China in December 2019, has been declared
a global pandemic. There are over four million cases and more than 300,000 deaths
worldwide.1
On the 14th February, Africa’s first COVID-19 case was recorded in Egypt. Three months
later, (May 13 2020), the disease had spread throughout every African country, with
Lesotho being the last to record a new case.2 In Africa, there are a total of 86,721
cumulative confirmed cases, 2,787 deaths reported and 33,840 recoveries as at May 19
2020.3 Four countries alone, South Africa, Egypt, Algeria and Nigeria recorded 47% of the
cases in Africa. Though Africa so far has the lowest number of cumulative confirmed
cases, there are concerns regarding the representation of the true prevalence of the disease,
as several countries report unavailable or low testing capacities. Furthermore, underdeveloped health systems and the existence of several hard to reach and/or highly rural
areas, also pose a threat to Africa’s ability to contain and mitigate the spread of the disease
and manage confirmed cases effectively.
Nigeria became the first sub Saharan African country to record a case of COVID-19 after
an imported case from Italy was confirmed on February 27, 2020. As at May 18th 2020, of
the 36,899 tests carried out so far, there have been a total of 6,175 confirmed cases and

191 deaths in Nigeria, 1,644 cases have been discharged with 4,340 cases remaining active.
Of the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory Abuja, only two states in Nigeria (Cross
Rivers and Kogi states) are yet to record any confirmed cases of COVID-19.4 It is
important to note that these figures do not account for asymptomatic or untested cases.
The Nigerian government, as with other national governments are grappling with the rising
numbers of COVID-19 cases and have instituted several containment measures in a bid to
stem this rising tide. Various steps have been taken by both Federal and State Governments
to curb the spread of the virus, including restriction of interstate movements, closures of
schools, markets and other business places, bans on religious and social gatherings as well
federally-ordered lockdowns in two states and the FCT. Other measures include social
distancing, use of nose masks, good hygiene, proper hand washing and use of alcoholbased hand sanitizers, sneezing into elbows, etc. as advised by the Nigeria Center for
Disease Control. However, considering the socio-economic well-being of citizens and the
economic challenges that arise as a result of some of the public health measures, some of
these restrictions are gradually eased in some parts of the country. This is amidst the rising
number of confirmed cases and deaths, as well as the spread of the virus to previously
unaffected states. Accordingly, there is need to evaluate the trends of the COVID-19
epidemic in Nigeria, vis-à-vis government’s public health response to contain and mitigate
against the spread of the disease.
The study shows the evolutionary trends of the COVID-19 outbreak in Nigeria. We use
two methods to monitor and predict the COVID-19 case trends nationally and in two of the
most severely affected states as well as the FCT. Firstly, the moving average method, this
helps to smoothen out the noise of random outliers and emphasize long-term trends. They
are best visualized using simple plots and are useful for showing epidemic trends over
time.5 Secondly, we compute the Epidemic Evaluation Index (EEI) which has been used
successfully in China to monitor COVID-19 trends.5 The EEI serves as a useful tool to
monitor and predict the evolutionary trends for the emergence of new COVID-19 cases.
This index was developed by He He, Wang and Wang (2020) as an alternative to
traditional epidemic prediction models that are highly sensitive to the pre-specified
epidemiological parameters and tend to have low reliability in the face of the possible
seasonality of coronavirus, inter-city mobility, transmission of travel behavior related
transmission and the number of asymptomatic infections.5,6 The traditional model also has
the problem of underestimation of the scale of outbreak.6 The EEI aims to
comprehensively analyze the epidemic situation based on combination of actual
observation and log of moving averages (LMA) and can more accurately reflect the true
situation of the epidemic. This index could be used to support the decision-making process
in epidemic control and prevention strategies. An Epidemic Evaluation Index of less than 1
is often preferable as this indicates that the epidemic is under control. Higher indices show

higher rates of on-going disease transmission.7 The Epidemic Evaluation Index gives an
indication of the rate of the escalation of new cases in an epidemic situation and serves as a
useful tool to support the decision-making process for epidemic control and prevention
strategies.
The objectives of this paper are two-fold. Firstly, we aimed to use the moving averages and
EEIs to graphically depict the trends of new COVID-19 cases nationally and in Lagos,
Kano and the FCT. Secondly, we examined the effects of some of the government’s public
health interventions on the spread of COVID-19 and appraise the progress made so far in
addressing the challenges of COVID-19 in Nigeria.
Methods
Data source: The data used in this study are obtained from public sources made available
by the Nigeria Center for Disease Control (NCDC). From the first reported case of
COVID-19 in Nigeria, the NCDC releases data on the number of new cases, number of
discharges, number of deaths and the number of confirmed cases by state on a daily basis.
More recently, the number of tests carried out also released. These data are available in the
daily situation reports available at www.ncdc.gov.ng. The data used for this study date
from February 27, when Nigeria recorded her first COVID-19 case to May 11, one week
after the lockdown in Lagos and the FCT was eased.
Using this data, we computed moving averages of various orders, the log transformations
of the moving averages and then the EEIs of COVID-19 cases, for Nigeria as a whole and
then for other states i.e. Lagos, the epicenter of the epidemic in Nigeria, Kano and the FCT.
Then, we plotted graphs to depict these indices and show the epidemic trends for COVID19 in each scenario.
Moving averages
Using the Moving Average and Moving Averages of Logarithm – Transformed Data, we
computed moving averages of order 5, order 7, order 10 and order 14. The choice of the
order of the moving average was based on the transmission dynamics as new cases are
often expected to show symptoms up to 14 days after an infection. We used the 5-day, 7day, 10-day and 14-day moving averages of the actual and log-transformed number of
daily covid-19 cases. A moving average of a certain order simply means the average of the
number of new cases of that order. For instance, a moving average of the order of 5,
computes the average number of new COVID-19 cases over the past 5 days. We added 1 to
the actual number of observations before logarithm transformation to eliminate the
problem of having a zero entry on some days, especially when the test results are delayed
or lagged. Transformation makes the index more tolerant of outliers and also brings better
stability.7 If the number of new confirmed cases at time t is denoted by Xt, then the moving
average of order n, MA(n) is computed as

In epidemic trend analysis, a moving average helps smooth out the noise of random
outliers and emphasizes long-term trends. Moving averages are usually plotted and best
visualized. The averages are computed and visualized in the figures below. The

Results
Nationally, the number of new cases of COVID-19 showed an initial gradual rise since the first
reported case on the 27th February 2020. However, by the second week in April, these numbers
started to show a relatively sharper rise and this trend has continued till date. The highest number
of new cases (381 new cases) were reported on the 8th May, four days after the lockdowns in
Lagos and the FCT were eased. Similar trends were observed in Lagos state. New cases in the
FCT also followed a similar trend, but started to rise a little later i.e. by mid-April. In Kano, the
first COVID-19 case was reported on the 11thApril and started to show a sharp rise on the 24th
April (about two weeks later). Our analysis suggests that new COVID-cases in Nigeria may not
yet have reached its peak, as the reports of new cases are still on the increase. See Figures 1-4

The rate of increase of new cases nationally began to rise sharply from the 18th March, however,
by the middle of April 2020, this sharp rise appeared to steepen a little. The rate of growth of the
logarithm-transformed moving average in the period leading to, and including the lockdowns
was estimated to be 0.08. However, the observed rate for the period after the lockdown is 0.052.
Considering the incubation period of up to 11.5 days: 95% CI 8.2-15.6,8 there is often a time lag
between the institution of government policies and the time when policy effects start to kick in.
Our analysis suggests that the policies put in place by the government including the lockdowns
in Lagos and FCT may have had a positive effect on the development of new cases of COVID19 in Nigeria. The rate of rise of new cases reduced by a factor of 0.65. See Figures 5-8.
Figures 9-12 show the Epidemic Evaluation Index of the COVID-19 cases nationally and in
Lagos, Kano and the Federal Capital Territory. The blue lines show the EEIs and the grey and
red lines show the best and worst cases scenarios respectively. Nationally and in Lagos, the EEI
started off on very high notes, however, the effects of the lockdown seem to be observed by the
end of April and early May, as the EEIs are closer to 1. In all case scenarios, the EEIs are still
above 1 indicating that despite the progress that has been made, the epidemic is still not fully
under control and Nigeria has not yet reached its peak or entered a period of decline.

Tables 1 & 2 show that the EEIs are above 1 nationally and in the specific states. Table 2
shows that the EEI appears to have reduced after the lockdown with slight variations in the
rates of reduction across states.

Discussion
Globally, effective strategies are required to prevent and control the spread of the COVID19 pandemic. Estimating the evolutionary trends of this outbreak is crucial for the
allocation of scarce medical resources, regulation of human activities, and even for the
national economic development of countries. Thus, the creation of a reliable and suitable
model to help governments decide on emergency macroeconomic strategies and medical
resource allocation is crucial.6
This paper describes the epidemiological trends of COVID-19 cases in Nigeria as a whole
and in the two most affected states i.e. Lagos and Kano as well as the FCT. At the national
level, our analysis show that the COVID-19 epidemic curve is rising steadily but yet to
reach its peak. We observed that the direction of the moving averages of different states in

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.29.20110098; this version posted June 2, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

Nigeria are rising. It is evident that the rate of growth of the logarithm-transformed moving
average had slowed during the lockdown.
A computed EEI of greater than 1.0 suggests that the epidemic is still evolving and this
means that aggressive public health restrictions must be sustained. If the EEI drops below
1.0, it can be judged that the epidemic has entered the period of decline, meaning that it
may be time to plan to phase out some of the stringent preventive and control measures. If
the EEI remains below 1.0 for more than 7 days, it indicates that the epidemic has entered a
stable period of transmission. In Nigeria, the all the computed EEIs are yet to fall below
1.0 indicating that the epidemic in Nigeria is still evolving, highlighting the need to
maintain aggressive public health measures.
Since the first recorded case of COVID-19 in Nigeria, several public health measures have
been instituted in a bid to control the spread and limit the number of new infections.
Between March 18 and 30 2020, the Federal Government closed all educational
institutions, placed restrictions on large social gatherings and air travel and land borders
and began an aggressive awareness campaign to promote public health behavioural change.
Our study shows that some of these stringent measures have had some positive effects on
the transmission rates. However, we observe that active transmission is still on-going and
these measures may need to remain in order to further reduce transmission rates.
Mathematical models can help to identify the best timing for government intervention
measures as seen in China, where peak of the epidemic was predicted with a model
showing that aggressive control measures caused a decline in the number of new cases.9
Similar models have effectively informed public health decision making. For instance, in
Lima, Peru, investigators used a generalized growth model to forecast an early exponential
growth trend in Lima, which slowed down and turned into an almost linear growth trend,
highlighting the need to continue social distancing and active case finding efforts in the
region.10 In India, authors showed a short-term trend of COVID-19 for the three highly
affected states, Maharashtra, Delhi, and Tamil Nadu, and suggested that the first two states
needed further monitoring of control measures.11 In Italy, France and Spain, the autoregressive integrated moving averages (ARIMA) models were developed and showed an
initial exponential trend of new cases with a gradual decline as government planned to
return to normal life. Meanwhile, Spain, Europe's second-worst-hit country at the time saw
a trend that suggested a drop in daily coronavirus deaths though the number of confirmed
cases had overtaken Italy. In France on the other hand, similar to our observations, no
downward trend was observed at the time of the study, indicating that France, like Nigeria,
had not yet reached its epidemic peak.6
One of the principal steps taken by several governmental agencies to control COVID-19 is the
enactment of lockdowns to maintain social distance. This procedure is an excellent measure to
control the spread of the disease. Still, from an economic point of view, complete lockdowns
may be the cause of a significant financial crisis for the near future.11 Consequently, competing
economic priorities may make a full lockdown for an indefinite period undesirable.11 However,
lockdowns in densely populated states like Lagos and Kano, may reduce the disease transmission
rate, although complete control may not be achievable. Therefore, a suitable balance of

governmental policies is often preferable. Our data-driven findings are relevant for decision
makers as they attempt to strike this balance.
To the best of our knowledge, this study is one of the first to employ moving averages and EEI
models to evaluate the trends of COVID-19 in an African setting and in Nigeria in particular. It
however has some limitations, Firstly, moving averages are often affected by extreme values and
outliers, however, our data did not have significant outliers or extreme values. Secondly,
logarithmic transformations of the moving averages might be problematic when several zero
entries on consecutive days producing an average of zero exist in the dataset. This was taken care
of by adding 1 to the moving averages before computing the logarithms. Another limitation is
that our EEIs were computed based on a singular moving average order 7. There may be a need
to consider the comparison of other orders to check for consistency in future studies. Further, the
data used to develop our models are based on publicly available data from the NCDC. As at the
time we constructed our charts, only 29,408 tests had been conducted nationally, indicating a
possible under estimation of our findings. Also, the limited data from Kano (the first case was on
the 11th April 2020) may make inferences for Kano a little premature. Finally, all data presented
are as at the 12th May 2020, events after this are not included in our model, however, we hope to
report an update of our findings over time.
Conclusion and recommendations: The number of new cases of COVID-19 has been on a
steady rise since the first reported cases on the 27th February 2020. Public health interventions
including the lockdown measures in Lagos and the FCT appear to have assisted in reducing the
rate of increase of new infections. In Nigeria and across the two states and the FCT, the EEIs are
still above 1, suggesting that the epidemic in Nigeria is still developing and has not yet reached
its peak. We recommend that aggressive public health interventions and restrictions against mass
gatherings should be sustained.
