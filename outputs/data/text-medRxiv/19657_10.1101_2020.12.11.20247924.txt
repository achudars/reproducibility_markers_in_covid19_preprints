Risk-driven responses to COVID-19 eliminate the tradeoff between lives and livelihoods

Abstract
Responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have been conditioned by a perceived tradeoff between saving lives
and the economic costs of contact-reduction measures. We develop a model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission
where populations endogenously reduce contacts in response to the risk of death. We estimate the model for
118 countries and assess the existence of a tradeoff between death rates and changes in contacts. In this
model communities go through three phases – rapid early outbreaks, control through initial response, and a
longer period of quasi-equilibrium endemic infection with effective reproduction number (Re) fluctuating
around one. Analytical characterization of this phase shows little tradeoff between contact reduction levels
(underpinning economic costs) and death rates. Empirically estimating the model, we find no positive
correlation between (log) death rates and (normalized) contact levels across nations, whether contacts are
estimated based on epidemic curves or mobility data. While contact reduction levels are broadly similar across
countries, expected death rates vary greatly, by two orders of magnitude (5-95 percentile: 0.03-17 deaths per
million per day). Results suggest nations could significantly reduce the human toll of the pandemic without
more disruption to normal social and economic activity than they have already faced.

Executive Summary
• Problem specification: The response to COVID-19 pandemic is dominated by a perceived tradeoff
between saving lives through cutting social interactions vs. allowing those interactions to maintain economic
livelihood of communities. It is, however, unclear if this tradeoff really exists.
• Practitioner audience: Local, regional, and national policy makers who control communities’ responses to
observed levels of COVID-19 transmission risk are grappling with this perceived tradeoff on a daily basis.
• Core insight: The perceived tradeoff is illusory. Every community will pay a similar price in contact
reduction. What communities do control is the level of infection and deaths at which they are willing to bring
down contacts enough to keep the epidemic from growing further.
• Practical implications: By becoming more responsive, effective leaders quickly bring down community’s
interactions in response to small numbers of cases and deaths. They can then maintain these small case
counts at social interaction levels similar to other communities that experience much larger ongoing cases.
Thus, there is a path to saving lives at limited excess costs.

Introduction
Is there a tradeoff between protecting lives and protecting livelihoods under the threat of a pandemic? The
existence of this tradeoff seems intuitive. For example, the social distancing and lockdown measures needed
to control the spread of COVID-19 have caused tremendous economic disruption (Brodeur et al. 2020,
Coibion et al. 2020, McKee and Stuckler 2020). SARS-CoV-2 spreads through human interactions, so slowing
down its spread should inevitably hurt economic activities that depend on those interactions.
The policy discourse around pandemic response draws on this intuition that communities have to make a
tough choice: they either bring down their contacts, disrupting their economies but saving lives, or allow
more normal interactions but incur more deaths. Assuming a positive correlation between deaths and
economic activity, various nations and communities have adopted a range of approaches from stringent
lockdowns to hands-off non-responses (Loayza 2020). The tradeoff framing also forces societies to pick
winners and losers among their citizens: given the uneven distributions of both health risks (Hooper et al.
2020) and economic impacts (Loayza 2020), any course of action will leave many stakeholders unsatisfied.
In response, some have sought to better align the two goals by incorporating the economic costs of an
uncontrolled outbreak, e.g. from morbidity and mortality (Cutler and Summers 2020), or the public health
impacts of economic recessions (Bhuiyan et al. 2020, Douglas et al. 2020, Webb 2020). These arguments may
mitigate longer-term tradeoffs but do not challenge the basic tension between near-term health and economic
outcomes.
In this paper, we go a step further and propose that fundamentally, little tradeoff exists between health and
economic outcomes even during the course of the epidemic. Specifically, we argue theoretically that the
degree of contact reduction and by extension, disruption to economic activity that the pandemic necessitates
is largely independent of the resultant levels of morbidity and mortality. Therefore, while there are significant
economic costs associated with responding to a pandemic, every community has to pay those costs and they
are not related to mortality outcomes. We find empirical support for this hypothesis using two data sources:
1) estimating a model of endogenous contact reduction in response to COVID-19 pandemic across 118
countries constituting 7.05 billion people. 2) Correlating mobility data against COVID-19 death rates across
nations.

Risk-driven responses in models of epidemics
Understanding this potential tradeoff requires modeling how a community responds to the evolving risks of a
pandemic. Classical models of epidemics, such as the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model, predict
that an outbreak grows exponentially, slowing down only when the susceptible population is depleted. Two
stylized observations require adjustments to the basic SIR model. First, in most communities the initial wave
of COVID-19 was brought under control while the vast majority of the population was still susceptible.

Second, the initial control has been followed by a long phase of steady, sometimes oscillatory, infections and
deaths responsible for much of the public health and economic burden of the epidemic. These observations
are best explained by accounting for individuals’ and governments’ responses to an ongoing pandemic.
Models in public health and epidemiology often characterize those responses as a function of time (e.g. a
time-based change in contact-rates); using historical data on policies adopted by governments; or as policy
switches that are activated in response to risks (Flaxman et al. 2020, Kissler et al. 2020, R. Li et al. 2020b,
Walker et al. 2020). These characterizations, while effective for fitting historical trajectories, do not allow for
exploration of counter-factual scenarios where alternative evolutions of risks and responses do not follow
historical data.
To understand the tradeoffs between social interactions and disease burden, one needs to endogenize how
contact rates respond to perceived risks in a community. A few modeling studies in management and
economics have taken this endogenous view using behavioral (Ghaffarzadegan and Rahmandad 2020,
Struben 2020) or rational (Acemoglu et al. 2020, Farboodi et al. 2020) formalizations. These studies, however,
have not addressed the tradeoff between contact rates and saving lives, which requires an empirical
examination of the relationship across different communities.

Methods
Model and Predictions
We start with the classic SIR model (Murray 2002), and incorporate behavioral responses that endogenously
change infectious contacts as a continuous function of perceived risk. Populations are divided into three
groups: susceptible to the disease (S), infected (I), and removed from circulation due to recovery or death (R).
We build our argument starting with the simplest incarnation of the model:
𝑑𝑆

The two main parameters are the infectious contacts per day per index case (β), and the average disease
duration (τ). We use 𝑆𝑓 =

𝑆
𝑁

(with 𝑁 = 𝑆 + 𝐼 + 𝑅) to denote the susceptible fraction of the population.

The expected secondary cases from an index case in a fully susceptible population is the basic reproduction
number (R0):

(4)

𝑅0 = 𝛽𝜏

Because outbreaks in first-affected communities change behaviors in other nations, we call the empirically
estimated values for R0 initial reproduction numbers. Effective reproduction number (Re) then accounts for
reductions in secondary cases due to reduced susceptible fraction as the epidemic progresses:
(5)

𝑅𝑒 = 𝛽𝜏𝑆𝑓

With a constant 𝛽 and an R0 notably above one (Q. Li et al. 2020a) the basic SIR model predicts a rapid
COVID-19 outbreak that infects most of a population in a few months, reaching herd immunity when a large
fraction of the population has been infected with huge resultant loss of life. In practice, however, few
communities have followed this uncontrolled trajectory. Instead, the initial exponential growth phase has
been curtailed well before herd immunity, as behavioral and policy responses to perceived risk of death bring
down daily infectious contacts per index case (β) enough to control the epidemic. As a result, few
communities have depleted their susceptible populations (Rahmandad et al. 2020). Instead, in most countries,
the initial outbreak and control phases have been followed by a third phase in which a large fraction of the
population remains susceptible and experiences a stream of new cases and deaths, including occasional
subsequent waves.
We capture this endogenous change in behaviors and policies by allowing β to go below its initial value (𝛽0 )
in response to perceived risk of death (D):
(6)

𝛽 = 𝛽0 𝑔(𝐷)

Function g reflects contact rates relative to initial levels and offers a proxy for disruption to normal activities,
the primary driver of the economic costs of an outbreak. g(D)=1 indicates no change in behaviors compared
to pre-pandemic, whereas a society in full lockdown may push g(D) down to near zero.
Based on an empirical exploration of the delays in risk perception and response, we model perceived risk as a
2nd order Erlang distributed delay of per capita daily death rate (dN; Equation 8) resulting from an infection
fatality rate of f. An exponential function is used to formulate g:

α represents the responsiveness of a community to perceived risk and λ represents the time it takes to
perceive and respond to risks. α=0 recovers the basic SIR model. Higher α values indicate a community more
responsive to the perceived risk of death from the disease.
In estimating the model we note that the time constant for upward vs. downward adjustment (when
D(t)<dN(t) vs. D(t)>dN(t)) of perceived risk and response may differ, e.g. raising alarms may happen faster
than forgetting about the risks of a pandemic:
𝜆=

𝜆𝑢 𝑖𝑓 D(t) < dN (t)
𝜆𝑑 𝑖𝑓 D(t) ≥ dN (t)

(10)

To capture changes in risk-response relationship over time (e.g. due to adherence fatigue), we also allow
communities’ responsiveness to perceived risk (α) to vary, starting from some initial responsiveness (𝛼0 ) and
moving toward some final value (𝛼𝑓 ), with parameters 𝑡0 and 𝜃 affecting the timing and rapidity of the
adjustment:
𝛼 = 𝛼0 + (𝛼𝑓 − 𝛼0 )

(11)

−(𝑡−𝑡0 )
1+ 𝑒 𝜃

For estimation, we predict observed infection rate as a function of observed death rates. Assuming an undercount ratio of 𝛾𝐼 for official to true cases and using the subscript “M” for official measures (vs. true values),
we can write:

𝑟𝐼 =

𝛽0 𝑔(𝑑𝑁 )𝐼𝑆

𝑟𝐼𝑀

⇒

𝑟𝐼𝑀 = 𝛽0 𝑆𝑓 𝑔(𝑑𝑁𝑀 ) ∑𝑘=𝜏
𝑘=1 𝑟𝐼𝑀 (𝑡 − 𝑘)

(12)

Note that in this derivation we assume 𝛾𝐼 is not changing quickly on the timescale of disease duration 𝜏, but
could change over longer horizons. Susceptible fraction (Sf) is not directly observable because cumulative case
counts are significantly under-estimating the true magnitude of the epidemic. Official death data (dNM) are
more reliable. We therefore estimate total cases by dividing cumulative deaths to-date by country-specific
infectious fatality rates (f) calculated based on age-specific fatalities (Verity et al. 2020) and correcting with 𝛾𝐷
for country-specific under-reporting and over-estimation of f (details in S2):

Quasi-equilibrium phase and its features
Risk-driven responses create a balancing feedback loop that can control the epidemic before herd immunity is
reached: deaths increase while Re>1, raising alarms and bringing down infectious contacts. Re<1 reduces
deaths until the diminishing perceived risk leads to relaxation of responses, pushing Re up. Behavioral risk
response thus creates a self-correcting process through which Re converges to approximately one, resulting in
a quasi-equilibrium phase where cases and infections are close to stable (Figure 1). The Re~= ~1 condition
governs changes in contacts during quasi-equilibrium phase (𝑔𝑒𝑞 )

This phase is a ‘quasi-’equilibrium as an ongoing stream of new cases continues to reduce the susceptible
fraction. Moreover, the delays between infection, death, and response may allow transmission and deaths to
go higher/lower than equilibrium when rising/falling. Thus, depending on the risk-response delays (𝜆),
𝑒𝑞

communities converge to quasi-equilibrium expected death rates, 𝑑𝑁𝑀 , or oscillate around this value (Figure
1). In that neighborhood, D(t) will on average be close to 𝑑𝑁𝑀 (equation 8), allowing us to calculate the quasiequilibrium death rates:

This phase ends when Sf falls below 1/R0. As long as communities are responsive enough to risk to bring the
𝑒𝑞

initial outbreak under control, the dNM values remain close to 𝑑𝑁𝑀 and g close to geq for an extended period,
making the quasi-equilibrium phase critical in the overall impact of the pandemic.
We focus on two features of the quasi-equilibrium phase. First, the normalized contact level in this phase,
geq(D) does not depend on the functional form or parameters of risk perception and response, nor on the
number of infectious individuals (I) (See equation 15). It is simply a function of the initial reproduction
number (R0) and the susceptible fraction (Sf), which determine the contact reduction needed for Re≈1.
Second, the death rate in the quasi-equilibrium phase will depend primarily on α (along with differences in R0
across communities). Our model predicts limited variation in normalized contacts across communities
because variations in both R0 and Sf are limited. On the other hand, differences in equilibrium death rates may
be much larger, depending on empirically observed variations in responsiveness 𝛼. Finally, the correlation
𝑒𝑞

between 𝑑𝑁𝑀 and 𝑔𝑒𝑞 is predicted to be non-positive, contrary to the intuitively expected tradeoff. If
anything, a negative correlation may emerge if countries vary significantly in R0 (and Sf): those with larger R0
𝑒𝑞

will have both larger 𝑑𝑁𝑀 and smaller 𝑔𝑒𝑞 . Next, we test these hypotheses by using COVID-19 infections
and mortality data to quantify the response functions and the projected quasi-equilibrium death rates across
118 countries. To provide a separate test of our hypotheses, we also look at the correlation between mobility
data and death rates.

Data and Estimation
We use equation 14 to find the posterior distribution of each country’s parameters
(𝛽0 , 𝛼0 , 𝛼𝑓 , 𝑡0 , 𝜃, 𝜆𝑢 , 𝜆𝑑 , 𝛾𝐷 ), using a Markov Chain Monte-Carlo method (Vrugt et al. 2009) starting with
uninformed priors (details in S1). To accommodate heteroskedasticity and fat tails, we represent observed
cases (rIM) using a Negative Binomial distribution, which introduces a scale parameter (𝜖). We specify the
average disease duration (τ) at 10 days (He et al. 2020), constant across all countries (and find limited
sensitivity in the results to plausible alternative values, see S4).
We use a panel of daily data on confirmed cases and deaths for 118 countries comprising 7.05 billion people,
covering dates from 31 December 2019 to 02 December 2020. We use 7-day rolling averages on this data to
smooth out weekly reporting cycles and better reflect underlying trends. For mobility we use Google’s
COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports, which track changes in visits to different categories of destinations
compared to pre-COVID-19 travel patterns based on cellphone data. All data come from the
OurWorldInData global COVID-19 database (Roser et al. 2020), which aggregates its data from various
official sources as well as Google’s mobility reports.

Results
This simple model replicates the diverse range of trajectories observed in the epidemic thus far (Figure 2; See
S3 for full sample). Over the full sample of 118 countries, R2 for infections against data is 0.936, while the
mean absolute errors normalized by mean (MAEN) are 13.2%. For a handful of countries (Argentina, Jordan,
Oman) Sf falls below 1/R0 in our analysis period so quasi-equilibrium no longer holds; those countries are
excluded henceforth.

On average, responsiveness decreases over time: On 01 May 2020 the median effect of 1 daily death per
million was to reduce contacts to 30.4% of normal, but by 02 December 2020 normalized contacts only drop
to 77.7% in the same scenario. The drop in 𝛼 results in increasing quasi-equilibrium death rates over time
(See equation 16). There is also much variance in these response factors – in the 1 daily death per million
scenario, estimated contact rates on 02 December 2020 range from 0.01%-98.3% (5th-95th percentile) of
normal. As hypothesized, risk adjustment is asymmetric, with most countries increasing perceived risk much
faster (median 𝜆𝑢 = 8.9 days) than reducing it (median 𝜆𝑑 = 61 days).
In most countries, quasi-equilibrium conditions hold as reproduction number remains close to one. Across
these 115 countries, the Re averaged over the last 180 days (05 June 2020-02 December 2020) has a median of
1.10 with a tight range (0.97-1.26, 5th-95th percentile) (Figure 3). In contrast, the median reported deaths (dNM)
averaged over the same period is 0.73 per million per day with a 5th-95th percentile range spanning 0.02-3.19.
While Re values are clustered around 1, death rates vary by over two orders of magnitude.

Figure 4 shows how the model’s predicted quasi-equilibrium deaths compare with actual data. For each day
we regress (log-transformed) observed death rates (𝑑𝑁𝑀 ) for all countries against the estimated most likely
𝑒𝑞

log(𝑑𝑁𝑀 ) values for that day. We then graph the estimated coefficient for these regressions over time. After
a less stable early phase, the coefficient converges to the neighborhood of one and remains there, showing
𝑒𝑞

that 𝑑𝑁𝑀 reliably predicts the actual reported deaths for much of the pandemic’s history. This result is
notable because we did not estimate death rates directly: the projected equilibrium deaths rely on the
analytical derivations and the estimated behavioral parameters for risk response, and yet those analytically
derived values predict reported deaths with a coefficient close to 1.

Our key hypothesis informs the relationship between normalized contact levels and equilibrium death rates
across nations. We assess this relationship both through our estimates and direct observations.

date quasi-equilibrium daily death rates (𝑑𝑁𝑀 ) vary widely (median: 1.46; 5th-95th percentile range of 0.03 to
17; larger than past-six-month average deaths shown in Figure 3 due to declining 𝛼). In contrast, normalized
contacts in this phase are much less variable with median geq of 0.690 (0.521-0.867, 5th-95th percentile). The
estimates of contact rates are highly precise – the median of the interquartile ranges of each country’s credible
interval, normalized by its estimated value (MNIQR), is 0.057. Credible intervals on projected death rate are

wider but still fairly precise (MNIQR = 0.16). Notably, we find no positive correlation between death rate and
𝑒𝑞

contact rates (Pearson’s r = -0.077, p = 0.411; for log(𝑑𝑁𝑀 ), r = -0.241, p = 0.009).
Figure 5B uses direct observations to inform this relationship. For deaths we use the official death tolls
averaged over 180 days from 05 June 2020-02 December 2020 (as in Figure 3). To approximate contact rates
relative to normal, we utilize mobility data from the Google Community Mobility database. Among others,
this database uses mobile data to quantify percent changes in daily visits to Retail and Recreation as well as
Workplace locations, compared to pre-pandemic rates. Using the average of these two metrics over the 180day pre-estimation period we create a combined measure of reductions in contact which we graph against
(log) deaths (See S3 for separate graphs). Again, we find a negative correlation between deaths and relative
daily visits to workplaces (-0.516, p = 1.01E-07) or retail and recreation venues (-0.249, p = 0.016).
Overall, both in data (Figure 3 and Figure 5B) and in estimates (Figure 5A), we find no tradeoff between
contact levels and death rates across nations; if anything, countries with lower death rates have also benefited
from more limited contact reductions.

Discussion
Our results do not directly assess the economic costs of COVID-19 pandemic, which are real and large
(Baker et al. 2020, Brodeur et al. 2020, Cutler and Summers 2020). However, contrary to the tradeoff between
protecting lives and minimizing disruptions that many assume, we found no positive correlation (r = -0.241, p
= 0.009) between (log) death rates and (normalized) contact levels in quasi-equilibrium conditions across 115
nations. Furthermore, while contact reduction levels are broadly similar across countries (90% of countries
fall between 0.521-0.867 times their initial contact rates), expected death rates vary greatly, by over two orders
of magnitude (90% of countries between 0.03-17 deaths per million per day). These patterns are robust
whether we estimate contact levels based on epidemic curves or use direct mobility data.
What accounts for the counterintuitive disconnect between contact reduction and death rates? Few countries
tolerate exponentially growing outbreaks and deaths for long. Whether through formal policy responses or
informal behavioral changes, steps will be taken to curb the epidemic, bringing down Re to the neighborhood

of one. Across countries the contact reduction needed for reaching this reproduction number is largely
similar, despite some inevitable variation as physical and cultural conditions create some differences in R0
among countries. Communities thus suffer broadly comparable disruptions in terms of contact reduction. In
contrast, the death rate a country faces in the quasi-equilibrium phase depends primarily on the country’s
responsiveness to risk. High responsiveness means that even slight upticks in the death rate will trigger a
rapid response, bringing down Re to 1. Low responsiveness requires higher death rates before Re is pushed
down to 1. So far countries have varied by two orders of magnitude in the death rates required to trigger this
stabilizing response.
This result offers an important policy insight. Communities could experience vastly lower death rates with
comparably stringent contact-reduction measures (i.e. those leading to Re~1), if they first brought down
infections to very low levels and responded quickly and vigilantly to keep Re~1 thereafter. Other, more
complex models have also noted this (lack of a) tradeoff. For example, Ferguson and colleagues (Ferguson et
al. 2020) found that different trigger thresholds for re-implementing lockdowns would result in differing
mortality levels but with virtually no change in the total time spent in lockdown.
Our simple model was designed primarily for investigating the tradeoffs between contact reduction and
deaths and includes several limitations. One set of extensions may model the epidemic in more detail. For
example, one could more explicitly model under-reporting processes, use testing data to inform the analysis,
account for changing fatality rates over time, and couple model parameters across nations in a hierarchical
Bayesian framework. A second set of extensions could focus on better representation of various policies and
economic costs. We do not differentiate between policies used to reduce contact rates (e.g. contact tracing,
isolation of vulnerable groups, school closures, masks, etc.). Some policies are more efficient in reducing
contacts with less overall disruption to social life and economic activity (Benzell et al. 2020, Han et al. 2020).
With effective policy sets, some nations may better maximize economic activity given the limited contact
‘budget’ they have based on Re~1 condition. Another valuable extension would be to use economic output
data to more directly test the predicted (lack of) tradeoff between saving lives and maintaining economic
activities.
A third line of further research could explore the intriguing possibility that better economic outcomes may
actually coincide with fewer deaths (Correia et al. 1918, Hasell 2020). Our analysis hints at this possibility, as
we find a negative correlation between deaths and normalized contacts. Part of this negative correlation is
mechanical: for a given level of responsiveness, communities with higher R0 would have to bring down their
contacts more and will have higher equilibrium death rates. However, more interesting mechanisms may be at
play as well. It is possible that by keeping infections low, communities can use extensive testing, contact
tracing, and isolation to control the epidemic with minimal economic disruption and also offer much better

care to those infected, options not available to those struggling with large caseloads. Limited caseloads
provide policy makers with room to design better strategies and implement them with less urgency, enhancing
effectiveness. Moreover, success in controlling the pandemic could also build trust between policy makers
and citizens, enhancing adherence to various protocols and enabling fine-tuned individual responses which
obviate the need for heavy-handed interventions such as lock-downs.
Overall, the tradeoff between lives and livelihoods has dominated policy and popular discourse around
COVID-19, but focusing on this tradeoff misses a more fundamental truth. COVID-19 is a deadly disease,
and whether by choice or by the force of crippling death tolls, societies will have to bring down interactions
enough to contain its spread. What we control is the severity of death toll required to compel us to act.
Outbreaks will grow as far as we are willing to let them, and swift reactions will save both lives and
livelihoods.

S1 – Estimation method
The estimation equation for our model (equation 14 in the main paper) is replicated below:
𝐸(𝑟𝐼𝑀 (𝑡)) =

𝛽0 (1 −

𝛾𝐷
𝑓

−(𝛼0 +(𝛼𝑓 −𝛼0 )

∑𝑠=𝑡
𝑠=0 𝑑𝑁𝑀 (𝑠))𝑒

2𝑠
1
2
)(∫𝑠≥0 𝑑𝑁𝑀 (𝑡−𝑠) 𝑠 2 𝑒 𝜆 𝑑𝑠)
−(𝑡−𝑡0 )
𝜆
𝜃
1+ 𝑒

∑𝑘=𝜏
𝑘=1 𝑟𝐼𝑀 (𝑡 − 𝑘)

This equation predicts the expected number of new infections for day t as a function of past infections
(to calculate stock of infectious individuals) and past death rates (to calculate the response function).
We assume the observed infections follow a negative binomial distribution with the given mean from
this equation and a scale parameter, 𝜖, that is estimated to replicate observed error distributions. The
negative binomial distribution provides the flexibility to account for heteroscedasticity, overdispersion, and fat tails, allowing a robust estimation despite substantial randomness in the datagenerating process.
The model includes the following unknown parameters: 𝝎 = [𝛽0 , 𝛼0 , 𝛼𝑓 , 𝑡0 , 𝜃, 𝜆𝑢 , 𝜆𝑑 , 𝛾𝐷 , 𝜖] – 4
(𝛼0 , 𝛼𝑓 , 𝑡0 , 𝜃) quantify responsiveness and how it changes over time, 2 (𝜆𝑢 , 𝜆𝑑 ) specify the risk
perception delays, 𝛽0 estimates the initial rate of infectious contacts per day per index case, and 𝛾𝐷
estimates the potential under-valuation of Infection Fatality Rates (f values) for each country . Besides
the f values (see IFR calculation below for details) the model includes two other given parameters, the
duration of disease (10 days) and the order of the perception delay (2).
More compactly, the model yields a (log)likelihood for observing the daily reported cases (𝑟𝐼𝑀 (𝑡)),
given a vector of unknown model parameters 𝝎 and the reported daily cases and death rate for each
country prior to the current date (𝑑𝑁𝑀 (𝑡−)) and 𝑟𝐼𝑀 (𝑡−)): 𝐿𝐿𝑁𝑒𝑔𝐵𝑖𝑛 (𝑟𝐼𝑀 (𝑡)|𝝎, 𝑟𝐼𝑀 (𝑡−), 𝑑𝑁𝑀 (𝑡−))
The estimation process seeks to identify the values for 𝝎 that maximise this likelihood or are likely to
be observed given that peak.
We estimate the model separately for each country. Separating countries significantly speeds up
estimation and makes it feasible to conduct the full analysis within days on a 48-core server. For each
country, we estimate the parameter vector 𝝎 using the Powell direction search method implemented
in Vensim™ DSS simulation software, restarting the optimization at 20 random points in the feasible
parameter space. From the resulting optimum, we use MCMC to explore the payoff landscape to
identify the high-likelihood region of parameter space. The MCMC algorithm used is designed for
exploring high-dimensional parameter spaces; for more details see (Vrugt et al. 2009). We draw a total
of 500000 samples for each country, of which the first 300000 are discarded (the burn-in period); by
the end of the burn-in, the chains are well-mixed and stable (Gelman-Rubin PSRF statistic < 1.1). We
use the remaining 200000 samples to derive credible intervals for parameter and outcome estimates.

S2 – Data processing
Data on daily confirmed cases and deaths come from the OurWorldInData (OWID) global COVID19 database (Roser et al. 2020), which draws on the Johns Hopkins University CSSE COVID

dashboard (Dong et al. 2020). The CSSE dashboard in turn aggregates its data primarily from official
sources such as the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the European CDC, the
World Health Organization, and national health ministries, updating at least daily.
We use OWID’s 7-day rolling averages for new cases (‘new_cases_smoothed’) and deaths per million
population (‘new_deaths_smoothed_per_million’). COVID-19 case and death reporting data show
strong weekly cycles in many countries, as well as occasional anomalous spikes due to e.g. irregularities
in test reporting or redefinitions by government statistical agencies; using the rolling average data
smooths out these cycles, which we are not attempting to model here, to better reflect underlying
trends.
Our analysis includes all countries in the dataset with at least 10000 cumulative cases reported, and at
least 20 days of data. We exclude countries with fewer than 10000 cumulative cases to avoid skewing
the results with outliers. The minimum datapoint requirement helps ensure robust estimation. In total,
118 countries meet these criteria as of 02 December 2020.
For countries included, we utilise data starting from the date when they exceed 100 cumulative cases
reported. Excluding early data entails a tradeoff. Excluding it makes estimating the true basic
reproduction number (R0) more difficult – as discussed in the main text, after forceful outbreaks in
the first countries, most others adopted various precautions that brought down R0 below its prepandemic level. Furthermore, excluding the early data may cut out the initial dynamics of infection.
As a result, our estimated values for initial reproduction number are likely underestimates of basic
reproduction number, and thus the g estimates may tend to be larger than the true changes in the
contact rates compared to pre-pandemic levels. On the other hand, many of the early cases reported
in most countries were due to travellers, and often identified and isolated early on. The data during
this earliest ‘importation’ stage therefore do not accurately reflect community transmission dynamics
we are modelling. Rapid changes in the testing coverage also impact our ability to use assume
ascertainment rates are stable in the 𝜏 time horizon as needed in our derivations (see equation 12 in
the main text). We selected the 100 case cut-off to balance reasonably estimating R0 with correctly
reflecting transmission dynamics rather than travel networks, which are out of scope for this model.
For mobility data we use Google's COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports
(https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility). We access this data as compiled by OWID
(https://ourworldindata.org/covid-mobility-trends) which provides consistent mapping for country
names to other data we use.
Data are downloaded and processed with Python 3 code, using Pandas and NumPy packages. For the
full data processing code, see https://github.com/tseyanglim/CovidRiskResponse.
IFR calculation
Most countries’ reported case counts substantially under-estimate the true magnitude of the epidemic
(Rahmandad et al. 2020). To estimate the remaining susceptible fraction (Sf) for each country over
time, we therefore rely on reported deaths, which while still variable are more reliable, multiplying
cumulative reported deaths by an estimated country-specific under-reporting ratio (𝛾𝐷 ) and using
country-specific infection fatality rates (IFR) to calculate cumulative infections.

Age strongly influences IFR, with older patients far more likely to die of COVID-19 (Verity et al.
2020). We therefore calculate country-specific IFRs based on each country’s age structure.
We use data from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators (World-Bank 2014) on the age
distribution of each country’s population in 10-year age strata to calculate an age-weighted average of
the IFRs for COVID patients by 10-year age group estimated in (Verity et al. 2020). The resulting
demography-adjusted country-specific IFRs range from 0.14% (Uganda) to 1.51% (Japan), with a
mean of 0.54% and median of 0.44% (Lebanon). For the handful of countries for which up-to-date
demographic data are unavailable, we use a baseline IFR of 0.50%.
We incorporate an estimated multiplier for actual to calculated deaths, 𝛾𝐷 , to account for potential
undercounts of death and reductions in IFR compared to early values estimated from the methods we
used. In estimation we restrict this multiplier to be between 1 and 4.

S3 – Full results
Figure S1 shows fits to data for simulated infection rates for all 118 countries. Blue lines show modelgenerated daily infection rates, while red lines show 7-day rolling average infection rates from OWID.
The correspondence between model and data is very close for most countries, with a few outliers
bringing down the quality of fit a bit; yet over the full sample of 118 countries, R2 for infections against
data is 0.936, while the mean absolute errors normalized by mean (MAEN) are 13.2%. The quality of
fit should not come as a total surprise: the model uses infection rates from the past 10 days to predict
current-day infections, and thus to the extent that infections are auto-correlated, the estimation
process can use this anchor to offer close approximations for the number of new cases. However, the
behavioural response function does add significant value in terms of quality of fit, which we
demonstrate in the sensitivity analysis section by comparing results against estimates that do not
account for behaviour responses.
Table S1 summarises estimated parameter values across the 115 countries which met the quasiequilibrium condition (Sf > 1/R0). 3 of the 118 total countries estimated (ARG: Argentina, JOR:
Jordan, OMN: Oman) no longer meet this condition as of 02 December 2020, and were excluded
from further analyses. For the full table of country-by-country parameter estimates, see
https://github.com/tseyanglim/CovidRiskResponse.
Figure S2 shows 90% credible intervals estimated for each country for the two main outcome
measures, quasi-equilibrium normalized contact rate (geq) and quasi-equilibrium daily death rate per

million (𝑑𝑁𝑀 ).
Figure S3 shows reported daily death rates per million against change in visits to workplaces and retail
& recreation venues respectively, relative to pre-pandemic levels, averaged over 180 days from 05 June
2020-02 December 2020. (The figure showing the combined index is in the main paper.) The
correlation between deaths and relative daily visits is non-positive in all cases: Pearson’s R2 for
averaged index = -0.371 (p = 0.0002); workplaces = -0.516 (p = 1.01E-07); retail & recreation venues
= -0.249 (p = 0.016).

S4 – Sensitivity results
Disease Duration
We specify the average disease duration (τ) at 10 days, constant across all countries. This duration is
consistent with prior findigns (He et al. 2020, Wolfel et al. 2020). To test for sensitivity to this
parameter, we re-ran model estimation and analysis with τ = 8 and 14 days.
Figure S4 and Figure S5 show the main result for τ = 8 and 14 days respectively. The primary insight
has not changed – expected deaths and normalized contact rates in quasi-equilibrium conditions have
no positive correlation (for τ = 8 and 14 days respectively, Pearson’s r = -0.044, p = 0.647 and r =
𝑒𝑞
0.099, p = 0.303; for log(𝑑𝑁𝑀 ), r = -0.130, p = 0.177 and r = -0.238, p = 0.012), with if anything a
slight negative correlation as per the main result.
The model is still able to fit the data reasonably well with changes in disease duration. Table S2 and
Table S3 summarise estimated parameter values with τ = 8 and 14 days respectively. On average,
reducing τ to 8 days results in a 10.0% absolute change in estimated parameter values, while increasing
it to 14 days results in a 7.4% absolute change. The fit between simulated infections and data
deteriorates slightly at τ = 14 days (R2 = 0.930, MAEN = 14.7%) compared to baseline (R2 = 0.936,
MAEN = 13.2%). Fit improves slightly at τ = 8 days (R2 = 0.950, MAEN = 11.5%). The primary
driver of infection rates is the number of currently infected people, which is calculated exogenously
from the data based on the specified disease duration. As such, some inverse relationship between
quality of fit and disease duration is to be expected, as shorter durations allow autocorrelation in the
[smoothed] infection data to exert a stronger influence on the accuracy of model predictions.
These results indicate that both overall model performance, and more importantly, the main results

Estimation without behavioural response
We estimate the model with the endogenous behavioural response deactivated, i.e. α = 0. In the
absence of behavioural response, the fit of simulated infections to data deteriorates by 38% (R2 =
0.914, MAEN = 18.2%), as expected, indicating that the behavioural response mechanism does
improve the quality of fit. As the primary driver of infection rates is the number of currently infected
people, which is calculated exogenously from the data, overall model fit remains notably good.
