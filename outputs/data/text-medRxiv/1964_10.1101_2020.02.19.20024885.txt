Abstract
Background:
The corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) shows unusually high transmission rate
and unique clinical characteristics, with key pathological mechanism remaining
unclear. Here, we analysed the laboratory data based on clinical samples from
COVID-19 patients, in parallel comparison with non-COVID-19 pneumonia cases, in
an attempt to elucidate the key pathological features of COVID-19 during its infection
of the human body.
Methods:
We analysed biochemical indices and lymphocyte subpopulation in COVID-19
patients, and compare these data from non-COVID-19 pneumonia cases. Correlation
analysis was performed between leukocyte subgroups count and biochemical indexes
in COVID-19 patients.
Results:
The study enrolled 110 patients, comprising 88 COVID-19 patients and 22
non-COVID-19 pneumonia cases. We observed significant differences, including
abnormal biochemical indices (CRP, LDH, AST, eGFR, and sodium ion concentration)
and reduced lymphocyte subsets count, between the COVID-19 patients and
non-COVID-19-caused pneumonia cases. Correlation analysis indicates that the count
for lymphocyte subsets-but not that for neutrophils and monocytes-exhibits a
significant negative correlation with biochemical indices relating to organ injury, in
the COVID-19 infected patients.
Conclusions:
The study indicates significantly different clinical features between 2019 novel

coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-caused and non-2019-nCoV-caused pneumonia, especially
in terms of lymphocytopenia and organ injury. Notably, correlation analysis
demonstrates that tissue damage in COVID-19 patients is attributed to virus infection
itself rather than uncontrolled inflammatory responses ("cytokine storm"). These
findings provide new insights for developing efficient therapeutic strategies against
COVID-19 infection.

Introduction
Since its initial outbreak in the Chinese city Wuhan in early December 2019, the
corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread throughout China and globally,
with the total number of reported cases approaching 100,000.1 Analysis of clinical
data available is in urgent demand for revealing the mechanisms of tissue damage and
further devising more specific and efficient treatment strategies.
The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a novel beta coronavirus based on the
data from gene sequencing.2 Compared with other beta coronaviruses, such as
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, 2019-nCoV infection leads to significant differences in
clinical symptoms, according to the latest studies

[3]

, including remarkably higher

occurrence of non-fever patients, fewer upper respiratory and gastrointestinal
symptoms, a different profile of increased blood cytokines, more frequent multi-organ
injury, and lower death rate.3-5 These differences, along with its unusual high
transmission rate, suggest a different pathological mechanism underlying its infection
of the human body.
In this study, we analyzed the clinical and laboratory data of most of the
2019-nCoV-infected patients in the China city Nanjing, aimed at revealing the unique
pathological features of COVID-19 cases in comparison with non-2019-nCoV-caused
pneumonia cases. Importantly, through correlation analysis of the changes in blood
cell subgroups and key blood biochemical indexes of tissue injury, we have
discovered unexpected clues of the pathogenic process following 2019-nCoV
infection, which may provide valuable information for designing efficient approaches
of treatment.

A study based on 88 COVID-19 cases and 22 non-COVID-19 pneumonia cases from
the Second Hospital of Nanjing (Tangshan Branch, 1 Kangfu Road) was performed.
All COVID-19 cases were diagnosed based on the World Health Organization (WHO)

polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR). All non-COVID-19 pneumonia cases samples
were negative, based on the absence of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid in the respiratory
tract specimen. The RT-PCR assay was performed according to the protocol
established by the WHO.8 Based on pulmonary CT imaging findings, all patients with
2019-nCoV infection were graded 1-3 from mild to server according to the lung
injury degree. This study was approved by the ethics committee of the Second
Hospital of Nanjing, with written informed consent obtained from each patient.
Blood samples and laboratory data collection
Blood samples from patients were collected for laboratory assessments and flow
cytometry according to the doctor's instruction. All patients didn't receive any
treatment before blood sampling. Laboratory data were obtained from electronic
medical records. Laboratory assessments comprised the following indexes: complete
blood count, blood biochemical test, liver, and renal function, electrolytes, C-reactive
protein (CRP), procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase.
Flow cytometry analysis
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were collected from EDTA
anticoagulant whole blood via erythrocyte lysis. PBMCs were incubated with a panels

CA, USA) and rinsed with 1*PBS. Finally, the samples were examined by a flow
cytometry analyzer (BD FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA).
Statistical analysis
The results are expressed as means ± SD. Data were statistically analyzed using Prism
SPSS 19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and assessed for normality or homogeneity
of variance. For normally distributed continuous variables, differences between
multiple groups were compared using one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s tests or, if
appropriate, using one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Bonferroni correction. Continuous
variables that were not normally distributed were compared using Kruskal-Wallis test.
Spearman correlation analysis between the blood cell subgroups and the blood
biochemical indexes were conducted using SPSS 19.0. A value of p < 0.05 was
considered significant. NS = not significant.
Results
Laboratory findings of COVID-19 infected patients
A total of 110 patients were included in the study (Table 1), consisting of 88
2019-nCoV infected patients (47 males and 41 females) with a mean age of
46.386±17.532 and 22 non-COVID-19 pneumonia cases (11 males and 11 females)
with a mean age of 36.727±9.948. The cohort of 2019-nCoV infected cases were
further divided into the following three groups from mild to severe accroding to CT
imaging findings: grade 1 group (aged 39.444±14.328, 6 males and 3 females), grade
2 group (aged 44.845±16.799, 36 males and 35 females) and grade 3 group (aged
67.875±12.229, 5 males and 3 females).
The complete blood count results indicated that the number of lymphocytes and
platelets were significantly decreased in both grade 2- and grade 3-group COVID-19
patients, in comparison with non-2019-nCoV-infected pneumonia patients, suggesting

that COVID-19 patients could have lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia. In contrast,
no significant differences in the quantities and proportions of monocytes and
neutrophils were observed among these groups. Grade 3-group COVID-19 patients
had significantly higher levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), compared with
non-2019-nCoV-infected pneumonia patients. Blood biochemistry detection found
that several indices related to organ injuries, including lactose dehydrogenase (LDH),
aspartate aminotransferase (AST), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and
sodium ion concentration, were significantly different between grade 3-group
COVID-19 patients and non2019-nCoV-infected pneumonia patients.
Circulating lymphocyte subset profile of COVID-19 patients
To further explore the mechanism, and since lymphopenia was observed in
COVID-19 patients, we performed flow cytometry to analyze the composition of
lymphocyte subpopulations in the peripheral blood from patients. As shown in Table 2,
the count of total CD45+ lymphocytes, CD3+ lymphocytes, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T
cells, and CD19+ B cells in both grade 2- and grade 3-group COVID-19 patients were
significantly lower than those in non-COVID-19-infected pneumonia patients.
However, the differences of the proportions of CD3+/CD45, CD4+/CD45,
CD8+/CD45, CD4+/CD8+, and CD16CD56+/CD45+ and CD4+CD8+ T cells count

subgroups count and biochemical indexes relating to organ injury in both COVID-19
(Table 3) and non-2019-nCoV-infected pneumonia patients (Table 4). In COVID-19
patients, LDH, AST, and sodium ion concentration showed significant correlations
(P<0.05) with total lymphocyte and all lymphocyte subsets count; meanwhile,
creatinine kinase (CK), total bilirubin, eGFR, and potassium ion concentration only
exhibited significant correlations with part of lymphocyte subpopulation count (Table
3). Among the lymphocyte subsets, CD4+ Th cells count showed significant
correlations with most biochemical indices (Fig 1). In contrast, no significant
correlation was found between biochemical indexes and the counts for monocytes and
neutrophils. Meanwhile, LDH only negatively correlated with CD3+ T cell count and
CD8+ T cell count and AST exhibited with CD8+ T cell count in
non-2019-nCoV-infected pneumonia patients (Table 4). In general, correlation
analysis implied a significant negative correlation between lymphocyte subsets count
and organ injury degree in COVID-19 patients rather than non-2019-nCoV-infected
pneumonia patients.
Discussion
Our most striking finding is that lymphocytopenia, which is common in acute
infections,9 is particularly significant in 2019-nCoV infections.3 Others have
demonstrated the correlation between the lymphocytopenia and the clinical severity.10
Most previous reports only compared the severe groups against non-severe patients or
heath controls; to further study this clinical feature, in our study, we compared the
differences in the subgroups of lymphocytes harvested from COVID-19 patients with
those from pneumonia patients not infected by 2019-nCoV. We noticed that
lymphocytes also decreased in the grade 2-group COVID-19 patients, suggesting that
it might not only be a consequence of the infection but is probably a critical factor

driving the development and deterioration of the disease. Among the lymphocyte

non-2019-nCoV-infected pneumonia patients. Since B cells are responsible for the
humoral immunity against the invaders via producing antibodies,11 the impotent
response of B cells may fail to restrict the virus expansion and release of free virions
in vivo, which promotes the infection.
Another new and notable feature discovered is that the change in the proportion of
the CD45+ lymphocytes was insignificant, compared with non-COVID-19 patients.
Recently, postmortem results also found the numbers of trilineage in the central
immune system (bone marrow) and lymphocytes in the peripheral immune system
(spleen and lymph node) were all decreased significantly, indicating the peripheral
lymphocytopenia cannot be simply attributed to the change of lymphocyte tissue
distribution.7 Thses findings, first, demonstrate that the infection impacts on different
lymphocyte subgroups evenly, and more interestingly, suggest that abnormality in
cells that regulate the adaptive immunity may be responsible for the reduction of
lymphocytes. For instance, H5N1 infection causes lymphocytopenia through dendritic
cell (DC) dysfunction,12 suggesting the function of key antigen-presenting cells can
be drastically impaired during the infection. According to a study in rats, the myeloid
cells also express the 2019-nCoV receptor ACE2;13 thus, we should consider the
possibility of the virus infecting these cells, which is supported by the significant
decrease in the platelet counts in both grade 2-group and grade 3-group COVID-19
patients and the reduced count of trilineage in the bone marrow .
Moreover, recent imaging findings and postmortem biopsies reports indicate that the
infection can potentially damage other organs than the lung, including the kidney,
heart, liver and the testis.14-16 In correspondence with pathological findings, we also

notice changes in multiple biochemical indexes relating to organ injuries, including
LDH, CK, AST, and eGFR. In SARS-Cov cases, the multi-organ injury was
considered as a result of the inflammatory reaction (inflammatory cytokine storm).
However, the early report about COVID-19 cases found that the profile of cytokine in
the blood of patients was different from that from SARS-Cov cases: not only
pro-inflammatory cytokines but also anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-10, etc.)
increased in the COVID-19 cases.4 Additionally, all recent reports demonstrated that
high fever cases (>38 oC) were significantly fewer (even in severe cases) in
COVID-19 patients than in SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV cases.3 These features suggest
that the consequences in the COVID-19 patients might not be mainly due to the
inflammatory reaction, especially in the non-severe cases. Instead, the damage was
likely to be caused by the virus itself. Therefore, we performed a correlation analysis
between the number of lymphocyte subgroups and the biochemical indexes. We found
that most of the indexes relating to organ injuries were negatively correlated with the

non-2019-nCoV-infected pneumonia patients, further highlighting the virus infection
– rather than the inflammatory reaction – as the possible cause of the multi-organ
injury. Another supportive finding is that the difference in the number of monocytes,
neutrophils, and NK cells is not significant in our analysis; while theoretically, these
innate immune cells are the main player in a “cytokine storm”. Interestingly, the most
significant correlation happened between the injury indexes and CD4+ Th cell counts.
Because CD4+ Th cells are critical for the regulation of both cellular immunity and
humoral immunity,17 it is reasonable that these cells are most sensitive to the total
anti-virus immune responses. This finding further suggests that the damage of the
tissue is from the virus itself. Consistently, studies on the tissue distribution of ACE2

suggest that the virus receptor is widely expressed in human tissue including the
digestive tract, kidney, testis, and others.18
We highlight that the above finding is important for the design of treatment regimens.
Current treatments do not suggest using specific drugs to improve the activity of
immune systems, such as the GM-CSF or other immune stimuli, in fearing of the
exaggeration of inflammatory reactions and cytokine storm.19 However, based on our
clinical findings, we should seriously consider using immune-activating treatments
for COVID-19 patients, which will be helpful to compensate the dysfunctions in the
adaptive immune system and accelerate virus clearance process in vivo. Considering
the high possibility of secondary infection induced by excessive inflammation in the
severe cases, this strategy should be safer to apply in non-severe patients with the aim
to lower the occurrence of severe cases.
Taken together, our analysis in the present study, based on clinical data, demonstrate
significant differences between pneumonia caused and not caused by 2019-nCoVespecially including the lymphocytopenia. Our results further suggest that the tissue
damage to COVID-19 patients might be mainly due to virus infection itself rather
than uncontrolled inflammatory reactions. These findings are valuable for the
development of more efficient treatments.
