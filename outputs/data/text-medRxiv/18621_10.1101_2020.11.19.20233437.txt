Abstract
UV radiation can inactivate viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. However, designing effective UV

28

germicidal irradiation (UVGI) systems can be difficult because the effects of dried respiratory

29

droplets and other fomites on UV light intensities are poorly understood. Numerical modeling of

30

UV intensities inside virus-containing particles on surfaces can increase understanding of these

31

possible reductions in UV intensity. We model UV intensities within spherical approximations

32

of virions randomly positioned within spherical particles. The model virions and dried particles

33

have sizes and optical properties to approximate SARS-CoV-2 and dried particles formed from

34

respiratory droplets, respectively. Wavelengths used are 260 nm (germicidal UVC) and 302 nm

35

(solar UVB). In 5- and 9-μm diameter particles on a surface, illuminated by 260-nm UV light

36

from a direction perpendicular to the surface, 10% and 18% (respectively) of simulated virions

37

are exposed to intensities less than 1/100th of intensities in individually exposed virions (i.e., they

38

are partially shielded). Even for 302-nm light, where the absorption is small, 11% of virions in

39

9-µm particles have exposures 1/100th those of individually exposed virions. Calculated results

40

show that shielding of virions in a particle can be strongly reduced by illuminating a particle

41

either from multiple widely separated incident directions, or by illuminating a particle rotating in

42

air (because of turbulence, Brownian diffusion, etc.) for a time sufficient to rotate through all

43

orientations with respect to the UV illumination. Because highly UV-reflective paints and

44

surfaces can increase the angular ranges of illumination, they appear likely to be useful for

45

reducing shielding of virions.

1. Introduction
Viruses such as influenza, measles, smallpox, SARS and some noroviruses can be

51

transmitted via particles and droplets in the air. Improved methods to reduce the transmission of

52

viruses are needed. Ultraviolet (UV) light can inactivate SARS-CoV-2 (Ratnesar-Shumate et al.,

53

2020; Schuit et al., 2020; Simmons et al., 2020) and other viruses (Kowalski, 2009; Sagripanti

54

and Lytle, 2011 and 2013; Tseng and Li, 2007; Kim and Kang, 2018; Sagripanti and Lytle,

55

2020), and thereby help reduce transmission rates (Anderson et al., 2018; Memarzadeh et al.

56

2010). Solar UV radiation (primarily UVB at 280-315 nm), can inactivate SARS-CoV-2 (Schuit

57

et al., 2020; Ratnesar-Shumate et al., 2020) and other microbes near the Earth’s surface

58

(Sagripanti and Lytle, 2007). UVC (200-280 nm) is common for germicidal applications (Garcia

59

de Abajo et al., 2020; Rutala et al., 2013; Hakim et al., 2019; Bang et al., 2018; Kowalski, 2009;

60

Kujundzic et al., 2007; Walker and Ko, 2007).

61

Viruses may occur within droplets expelled from the upper or lower respiratory tract

62

(Morowska and Milton, 2020; Milton et al., 2013). Such droplets tend to lose water rapidly at

63

relative humidity (RH) below 95%. At RH less than 50% they can dry into somewhat spherical

64

particles (Vejerano and Marr, 2018). Such dried particles may land on surfaces and subsequently

65

be transferred to hands, faces, etc. Some viruses including SARS-CoV-2 can remain pathogenic

66

in aerosol particles, either in air (Schuit et al., 2020; Marr et al., 2019) or after landing on a

67

surface (van Dormelan et al., 2020; Schuit et al., 2020; Ratnesar-Shumate et al., 2020; Park et al.,

68

2015; Sagripanti et al., 2010). Viruses and other microbes on surfaces (bare or combined with

69

other materials) may be aerosolized (suspended in air) (Lighthart et al., 1993; Joung et al., 2017;

70

Girardin et al., 2016). If the material was initially deposited from air it may be reaerosolized

71

(resuspended) (Fisher et al., 2012; Kesavan et al., 2017; Krauter and Biermann, 2007; Layshock

72

et al., 2012; Paton et al., 2015; Qian and Peccia, 2014; Lighthart et al., 1993). The resulting

73

airborne particles may be inhaled. Viruses on surfaces may also be transferred from surfaces to

74

eyes, nose or mouth by touching with hands.

75

Some relevant surfaces for virus transmission include those in restaurants, restrooms,

76

healthcare facilities, and on facemasks (Fisher et al., 2012; Woo et al., 2012) and other personal

77

protective equipment. The relative importance of different routes of transmission depend upon

78

the virus, and on factors such as airflows, RH and the behaviors of the relevant persons. In the

79

case of SARS-CoV-2, although many questions remain unanswered, there is considerable

80

interest in using UV to inactivate virions on surfaces (Ratnesar-Shumate et al., 2020), and in air

81

(Garcia de Abajo et al., 2020; Nardell and Nathavitharana, 2020; Beggs and Vital, 2020;

82

Hessling et al., 2020).

83

A microbe in a particle may be partially shielded from UV by other materials in the particle

84

(Kesavan et al., 2014; Osman et al. 2008; Handler et al., 2015). This shielding may result in

85

microbes remaining infectious in particles even when they are exposed to sufficient UV light to

86

inactivate them if exposed individually. Such shielding can make germicidal UV more difficult

87

in settings where microbes are in particles. An improved understanding of how virions in

88

particles can be shielded from UV light could help in effectively using UV to deactivate SARS-

89

CoV-2.

90

Optical phenomena affecting shielding of viruses from UV include the following (see Fig. 1).

91

i) Absorption of UV causes the intensity to decrease as it travels into the particle and so reduces

92

the intensity of UV reaching the virion. ii) Refraction of UV at a surface of a particle can direct

93

light away from a virion; the importance of refraction depends upon the shape of the object, the

94

angle of the incident UV light with respect to the orientation of the particle, and on the optical

95

properties of the particle and the material outside the particle. iii) Reflection at the outer surface

96

of a particle can reduce the UV entering or exiting a particle; in inhomogeneous particles it can

97

occur at surfaces separating regions within the particle. iv) Diffraction and scattering can

98

increase UV intensities in regions which may otherwise be dark, in a ray optics approximation,

99

because of refraction and absorption.

100

[Figure 1]

101

Models of the UV intensities in particles containing viruses can be useful in understanding

102

UV inactivation and in improving UV decontamination systems. Valid models for the UV

103

intensity within each virion can be combined with measured inactivation data to predict the

104

numbers of virions likely to be inactivated within a particle. Validated models can predict results

105

for large numbers of potential experiments that are impractical to perform in the laboratory or the

106

field. Thus, such models can be essential tools for identification of decontamination techniques

107

most appropriate for further testing. This paper focuses only on modeling of UV intensities

108

within virions within particles, and not on modeling rates of inactivation.

109

Adequate methods to calculate the UV intensities within particles are required. Virions inside

110

a dried saliva droplet resting on a surface and illuminated by a UV light source can be

111

approximated as a number of homogeneous spherical virions distributed within a spherical

112

particle (which is otherwise optically homogeneous) on a planar surface and illuminated by a UV

113

plane wave. The UV intensities within the virions in the dried droplets in this model problem

114

can be calculated using the Multi-Sphere T-Matrix (MSTM) method (Mackowski, 2008;

115

Mackowski and Mishchenko, 2011, 2013). The MSTM provides an exact solution to the

116

electromagnetic field equations (Maxwell’s equations) for problems which include non-

117

overlapping spheres within spheres, and contact of one or more of the spheres with a planar

118

surface.

119

In this paper we calculate the UV intensities inside of 100-nm diameter spherical particles to

120

approximate virions which are inside a larger spherical particle of dried airway fluid. Each

121

virion and larger particle has a complex refractive index (m = mr + i mi) within the range of m

122

estimated for SARS-CoV-2 and for dried particles of coughed, sneezed or exhaled droplets.

123

Calculations of UV intensities within virions, and how virions in some locations are partially

124

shielded from UV light at some positions inside the particle are done at two wavelengths (260

125

and 302 nm), for 100 nm virions to approximate SARS-CoV-2. Calculations are done to

126

understand the amounts of shielding that could occur in dried droplets containing virions.

127

2. Methods

128

2.1 MSTM Calculations of UV intensities in Virions inside a particle on a surface or in air

129

Virions in this paper are approximated as homogenous spheres, typically inside a larger

130

spherical particle which is in air or on a planar surface. In this paper the UV intensities in the

131

spherical particles were calculated by solving the electromagnetic field equations (Maxwell’s

132

equations) for a number of homogeneous spheres, separate or included within other spheres, and

133

with the potential of being in contact with a flat surface, all illuminated by one or more plane

134

waves (Mackowski, 2008; Mackowski and Mishchenko, 2011, 2013). In the MSTM as used

135

here, a plane wave with irradiance Io (or set of n plane waves with irradiance Io/n for each wave)

136

illuminates either a naked virion or a spherical particle which contains a number of virions. The

137

net rate of energy absorption by the ith virion is Ioπai2Qabs,i, where ai is the radius and Qabs,i is the

138

absorption efficiency, each for the ith virion. The focus in this paper is on the absorption of UV

139

energy by virions in the large particle relative to virions resting on (or very near, i.e., 10 nm) the

140

surface. A main quantity illustrated here is the relative rate of absorption of UV energy of the ith

141

virion, Ri = Qabs,i / Qabs,single where Qabs,single is the absorption efficiency of a virion resting on the

142

same surface. Because the diameters and m for all virions in a given simulation are identical, Ri

143

is the relative UV intensity within the ith virion. The illumination used in the calculations is

144

unpolarized because sunlight and UV lamps are unpolarized.

145

2.2 Optical Properties of Virions and Particles of Dried Respiratory Fluids

146

Droplets of airway fluids are assumed to be generated by sneezing or coughing. Their

147

properties are assumed to be consistent with those of saliva or nasal fluids. The expelled

148

droplets are assumed to dry into spherical particles; the dried particles of simulated saliva studied

149

by Vejerano and Marr (2018) appeared to be somewhat spherical, at least for particles smaller

150

than 25 µm. The dried particles modeled have diameters of 1, 5 and 9 μm. The dissolved solids

151

in saliva are assumed to be 6 mg/cm3 (0.006×10-12 g/μm3), in the range of reported values (Edgar

152

et al., 2012, Vejerano and Marr, 2018). We assume a density for the dry particle of 1.5 g/cm3

153

(1.5×10-12 g/μm3). For these values, droplets with diameters of 6.3, 31.5, and 56.7 μm, dry to

154

particles with diameters of 1, 5 and 9 μm respectively.

155

Virions comprise at most a very small fraction of the mass of the solids in airway fluids. The

156

concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 virions measured in COVID-19 patients and healthcare workers

157

(Wyllie et al., 2020) ranged from 4×104 to 4×1010 copies/mL in saliva and up to 5×109

158

copies/mL in nasal fluids. The mass of a 100 nm diameter virion having an assumed density of

159

1.2 g/mL is 6×10-13 mg. The mass of 4×1010 of these virions (highest number measured in 1 mL

160

by Wyllie et al. (2020)) is 0.024 mg, i.e., 1/240th the mass of the other solids in the typical saliva

161

assumed here. For the properties described in the previous paragraph, the maximum average

162

numbers of virions per dried 9-μm particle is 3680 and in a dried 5-μm particle is 630. For

163

almost all the other cases reported by Wyllie et al. (2020), the large majority of sneezed or

164

coughed droplets and resulting dried particles would have no virions.

165

Each spherical particle is defined by a diameter (d) and a complex refractive index, m =

166

mr+imi. The imaginary part of m is defined as mi = λ/4πδ, where λ is the free-space wavelength,

167

and δ is the penetration depth, a key parameter useful in understanding shielding by absorption.

168

If I(z) is the intensity (I) of a UV planewave at distance z in a homogeneous medium, the fraction

169

of light remaining at z is I(z)/I0 =e-z/δ, where the intensity at z=0 is I0, and δ is the distance at

170

which the UV has decreased to 1/e (= 0.368) of I0. Also, mi = λcε/4π, where c is the

171

concentration of the absorbing material and ε is the molar absorption coefficient (IUPAC 2014),

172

also termed absorptivity (Hill et al. 2013; 2014; 2015), molar absorptivity, molar extinction

173

coefficient or molar attenuation coefficient. The molar absorption coefficients of biological

174

materials at the wavelengths used were estimated from the literature as described previously

175

(Hill et al. 2013; Hill et al. 2014; Hill et al. 2015).

176

A representative complex refractive index of dried particles of respiratory fluids is estimated

177

by first selecting representative concentrations in saliva and nasal fluids from the literature. The

178

density of the dried solids is estimated as a weighted average of the densities of materials in the

179

droplet. Using the initial concentrations and this density, the concentrations of the relevant

180

materials in the dried droplet are calculated. The contribution of the jth material to the total mi of

181

the dry particle, i.e., mi,j is then is calculated using the concentration (g/g) and the extinction

182

coefficient for the material as described previously (Hill et al., 2013, 2015). The total mi is the

183

sum of the mi,j. The concentrations of light-absorbing materials in dried droplets used here, as

184

well as the mi,j, mi, mr and penetration depths (δ) are given in Table 1. The main UV-light-

185

absorbing materials in the 260 to 302 nm range in airway fluids are tryptophan and tyrosine

186

(primarily in proteins), nucleic acids, and uric acid (Hawkins et al., 1963). At longer

187

wavelengths the absorption by proteins, nucleic acids and uric acid tend to be so low that the

188

penetration depths δ are many times larger than the diameter of most dried particles.

189

Concentrations of components of saliva used here are selected to be representative of values

190

reported by several sources (Edgar et al., 2012; Ben-aryeh et al., 1986; van Nieuw Amerongen et

191

al., 2004; Veerman et al., 1996). The concentrations provided in Edgar et al. 2012 (Table 1.2, a

192

compilation of 20 sources) were used for inorganic electrolytes (Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Cl-, PO43-,

193

HCO3-, SCN- , and F-); nonabsorbing small molecules (glucose, lactate, lipids, urea, and

194

ammonia); proteins and free amino acids; and the mucin glycoproteins. The concentration of

195

protein used is 1.63 mg/ml. The combined concentration of mucins (MUC5B and MUC7) is

196

1.27 g/L, a concentration which includes both the amino acids and the carbohydrate of these

197

glycoproteins. Typical mass fractions of airway mucin are 25% protein and 75% carbohydrate.

198

Using these values, we calculated concentrations of carbohydrate in the mucins are 0.75 × 1.27

199

g/L = 0.95 g/L. Reported concentrations of DNA in saliva range from approximately 0.01 to

200

0.28 mg/ml (Poehls et al., 2018). The DNA concentration here is assumed here to be 0.12

201

mg/ml. Concentrations of RNA are assumed to be equal to those of DNA (0.12 mg/ml). We

202

know of no reported measurements of non-viral RNA in saliva or nasal fluids. However, we

203

assume that the DNA in these fluids arise from cells. Cells (human or bacterial) typically have

204

several times as much RNA as DNA (Hill et al., 2013), and so the assumption of 0.12 mg/ml for

205

RNA may be low. The concentration of uric acid used is 0.024 mg/ml, in the range of values

206

measured (Hawkins et al. 1963; Araujo et al., 2020). Peden et al., (1990), demonstrate uric acid

207

in nasal airway fluids. With the combination of values above, the total mass in the approximate

208

airway fluid is approximately 5.77 g/L.

In estimating the complex refractive index of SARS-CoV-2, each virion was assumed to be

100 nm in diameter, where the outer 5 nm is a lipid bilayer.

213

nucleotides, A=8954, T=9594, G=5863, U=5492) has a mass of 1.39 × 10-17 g, which is only

214

0.22% of the virion mass. The mass not in RNA or lipid is assumed to be protein, although we

215

suspect other small molecules such as uric acid or NAD may be enclosed within the virion. The

216

key parameter is the UV intensity in virions in a dried particle, relative to the UV intensity in an

217

isolated virion resting on the same surface. In calculating the average mv, the average amino

218

acid composition is taken as the average of all the amino acids specified by the genome. The

219

different proteins are not weighted by their copy number or mass fraction mainly because we do

220

not know the mass fractions to use. Each virion is assumed to be homogeneous. The code to

221

calculate Table 1 and estimate optical properties for other combinations of primary metabolites is

222

similar to that described previously (Hill et al. 2013; Hill et al. 2014; Hill et al. 2015).

The virus genome, ssRNA (29,893

The diameters (d) of dried respiratory particles in the calculations shown here are 1, 5 and 9

225

intensity of an optical wave traveling a distance z in a medium with penetration depth δ is I(z)/I0

226

= e-z/δ. So, if d/δ = 5, then we may expect some positions inside the sphere to have intensities far

227

smaller than the illuminating (incident) wave, maybe on the order of e-d/δ = e-5 = 0.007 times.

228

On the other hand, if d/δ is less than 0.3, the absorption in the sphere is relatively small, and

229

significant protection from UV would need to arise from refractive effects. The location of

230

virions within dried droplets of airway fluids has not been measured, so far as we know. The

231

sensitivity of the distributions of the Ri to the numbers of virions in a dried particle was tested by

virions. Effects of changes in virion numbers on the distribution of Ri calculated were below

3. Results: UV Intensities in Virions in Particles of Dried Airway Fluids on a Surface

236

3.1 UV Intensities in Virions in particles illustrated in 3D

237

Figure 2 illustrates a 3D plot of 12,000 virions (calculated as 120 sets of 100 virions each)

238

randomly positioned within a 9-μm sphere simulating a dried saliva particle illuminated with

239

260-nm UV light. The virions are color coded according to Ri, the relative rate of absorption of

240

UV energy by the ith virion (relative to an isolated virion on the same surface). The dried particle

241

is on a surface with m=1.4+i 0.0001, which has a relatively low reflectivity). The mi and the δ

242

are as shown in Table 1 for the dried saliva, and as in Table 2 for the virions. The incident wave

243

is unpolarized; it propagates in a direction normal to the surface; and the large particle is

244

spherical. Therefore, the intensity distribution would be independent of the angle around the

245

246

independent of azimuthal angle for a sphere containing as many as 100 virions when the particle

247

and virions have the optical properties used here. The lowest intensity regions, indicated by

248

colors from blue to black, have UV absorption efficiencies that are over an order of magnitude

249

smaller than the UV absorption of an individual virion on a surface. In these figures the shielded

250

regions result from a combination of absorptive and refractive shielding.

251

The highest intensities in Fig. 2 are at the top of the dried droplet and along an axis of the

252

droplet in the direction of propagation of the wave (normal to the planar surface) which passes

253

through the center of the sphere. This high-intensity region narrows into a cone of decreasing

254

radius as it descends through the droplet and then partially reflects internally from the droplet

256

from UV occurs in the outer edge of the particle on the side away from the incident light.

257

Virions at the center of the particle are negligibly shielded by refraction from UV.

258

The 12,000 virions are used to illustrate the position-dependent variations in UV energy

259
260

absorbed by the virions, not because a 9-μm particle is likely to carry such a large number of

261

virions, but because a large number is needed to represent the distribution well. If 12,000 virions

262

were in the particle simultaneously, virions with the optical properties used here would affect the

263

UV intensities within other virions. Figure 2 may best be thought of as the distribution for an

264

ensemble of 120 particles, each containing 100 virions.

3.2 Distributions of Virion Numbers vs UV Intensity for Different Penetration Depths

266

Figure 3 illustrates distributions of numbers of virions in different relative-UV-intensity bins vs

267

relative-UV-intensity (log scale) for 9-µm particles shown in order of increasing mi. In all cases

268

the particles are in air and the surface has m = 1.4+i 0.0001. In moving from top to bottom, the

269

penetration depths decreases from 59.9 to 9.98 to 2.84 to 1.42 µm. Of these δ, the center two are

270

as in Table 1 for 302 and 260 nm respectively. The δ in the top panel of Fig. 3 is six times the δ

271

given in Table 1 for 302 nm. The bottom panel has a δ of ½ the δ estimated for 260 nm (in Table

272

3.3 Distributions of Virion Numbers vs UV Intensity for Particle Diameters of 1, 5 and 9 µm
Figure 4 illustrates normalized distributions of numbers of virions within UV intensity bins for

282

different sized particles resting on a surface and illuminated at 260 nm. The center-value Ri of

283

the bins with the peak numbers occur at 0.45, 0.71, and 0.71, for panels a) to c) with particle

284

diameters 9, 5 and 1 μm, respectively. In the case of the 1-µm particle, over 31% of the virions

285

have Ri > 1.0, and 0.2% have Ri < 0.1. However, in the 9-µm case, 29.6% of virions have Ri <

286

0.1 and 6.4% have Ri < 0.001 (Table 3).

3.4 Histograms of UV Intensity with Illumination Waves at Different Angles from the Zenith

289

Figure 5 illustrates histograms for three incident angles (β) relative to the vertical, also termed

290

the zenith angle. In Fig. 5a-c, β = 0, 40 and 80 degrees respectively. For these angles, the

291

percentage of virions with Ri < 0.1 is approximately 30% (Table 3). The percentage of virions

292

with Ri < 0.01 is approximately 15% (Table 3). The percentage of virions with Ri < 0.001 is

293

approximately 5% (Table 3). However, although there are no virions with relative UV intensities

294

below 0.0001 at an incident angle of zero degrees, at 80 degrees, approximately 1% of the

295

virions had relative intensities below 0.0001. Also, when β = 80° there are a higher number of

296

virions with Ri > 0.8 (Table 3).

Figure 6 illustrates distributions of UV intensity in virions within a 9-μm particle on a surface

300

illuminated by one- to five-planewaves. The illumination could be simultaneous or sequential:

301

the resulting total UV intensities within virions are identical because the UV light source is not

302

coherent. In Fig. 6a the illumination is from above the sphere (β =0). In Fig. 6b the angles (β, α)

303

are (0, 0) and (40, 0) (the azimuthal angle is α). In Fig. 6c the two incident waves are defined by

304

angles (0, 0) and (80, 0). In Fig. 6d the two incident waves are given by (80, 0) and (80, 180). In

305

each of these four cases ((a) to (d)), some virions have Ri < 10-3 (Table 3).

306

[Figure 6]

307

In each of the last three panels, three or more incident UV waves are used and the minimum

308

Ri increase significantly. In Fig. 6e four UV waves, incident from angles (80, 0), (80, 90), (80,

309

180) and (80,270) are used, and 5.7% of virions have Ri < 0.1. In Fig. 6f, three incident waves

310

are used: two planewaves propagating primarily toward each other (at angles (80, 0) and (80,

311

180)), and the third wave traveling perpendicular to the surface. In this case, 3.7% of particles

312

have Ri < 0.1, and the minimum Ri is 0.04. In Fig. 6g the particle is illuminated by five

313

planewaves: one is from the vertical; the other four have β=80° and azimuthal angles = 0, 90,

314

180 and 270°. That is, the angles of the five waves are: (0, 0), (80, 0), (80, 90), (80, 180), and

315

(80, 270). In this case, 1.4% of the particles have Ri < 0.1, and the minimum Ri is approximately

316

0.05.

317

For an objective of illuminating every virion in such particles with at least some desired UV

318

intensity Io, these results suggest that illuminating with multiple waves as illustrated in Figs. 6e,

319

and especially 6f and g, could provide a way to achieve that goal with much lower total UV than

320

needed for illumination with one or two beams.

3.6 Particles in Air Illuminated from All Directions

322

In Fig. 7, the histograms with solid-color bars show the distributions of relative-UV-

323

intensities in virions within 5- and 9-μm diameter particles. The particles are averaged over all

324

orientations with respect to an incident UV planewave, calculated as described by Mackowski

325

and Mishchenko (1996, 2011), which is equivalent to illuminating particles with equal-intensity

326

UV-light from all directions. Also shown in Fig. 7 are the UV intensity histograms for the fixed-

327

orientation cases (histograms made with thin lines).

328

In most situations where UV light is used to inactivate viruses in air the airflows are turbulent.

329

Particle orientation with respect to a UV light source can vary by “spinning” (i.e., rotating about

330

a particle axis), or by “tumbling” (i.e., rotation of the axis of the particle), or by following the

331

airflow. Particles undergo Brownian translational and rotational diffusion (Fuchs, 1964) even in

332

a small closed container. The extent to which the UV in a particle is equivalent to the

333

orientation-averaged results depends upon the airflows (including turbulence), Brownian

334

rotational diffusion, particle size, time of exposure, and the position(s) and spatial extent(s) of

335

sources of UV light. For a sufficiently short illumination time and slow enough particle rotation,

336

particle rotation during illumination is negligible and the particle is essentially illuminated from

337

one angle, as if it were “fixed in air”.

338

[Figure 7]

339

In the cases of the particles averaged over all orientations, no particles 5- or 9-μm have Ri <

340

0.1. In contrast, the fixed-orientation 5-μm particles have 8.6 and 10% of virions with Ri < 0.01,

341

and the 9-μm particles have 16.6 and 17.5% of virions with Ri < 0.01 and have 6.7 and 6.4% of

342

virions with Ri < 0.001 (Table 3). That is, for an airborne UV-illuminated 9-μm particle with

343

the properties used here, which rotates such that it is approximately illuminated uniformly by UV

344

light from all directions, the best shielded virions are still exposed to a UV intensity

345

approximately 1/7th of the UV intensity a clean individual virion would be exposed to. If that

346

same 9-μm particle were held on a surface, or illuminated for such a short time it could change

347

orientation only a little, then approximately 17% of the virions are shielded so that their exposure

348

to UV is 100 times less than is the single clean virion.

349

4. Discussion

350

4.1 Virions in Particles Can Be Partially Shielded from UV Light

351
352

4.1.1 Particles on a Surface: UV Illumination from One Direction
a) Shielding of virions can be very significant even in weakly absorbing particles. Even when

353

the penetration depth is 6.7 times greater than the particle diameter (Fig. 3a), 3.5% of the

354

particles have Ri < 0.01 and 22.8% have Ri < 0.1. At such large ratios of δ/d the shielding is very

355

largely refractive.

356

b) The effect of increased absorbance of the particle is apparent in Fig 3. As the penetration

357

depth of the dried respiratory fluids decreases, the percent of Ri < 0.001 increases from 0.0 to

358

0.06, 6.4 and 11.8 for penetration depths of 59.9, 10.0, 2.8, and 1.4 µm, respectively.

359

c) Shielding of virions from UV light occurs with both the germicidal (260 nm) and solar (302

360

nm) light used, and the 5- and 9-µm diameter particles shown. Shielding from UV light is far

361

less important in 1-µm diameter particles.

362

d) The effect of increased reflectance of the surface on shielding from UV appears to be small

363

for the 5- and 9- µm diameter particles and two surfaces shown in Fig. 7 (air with mr = 1.0, or a

364

material with mr = 1.4). However, reflective coatings on the walls of a room have been

365

demonstrated to reduce times required for UV decontamination (Rutala et al. 2013;

366

Krishnamoorthy and Tande, 2016). Such coatings can increase the UV intensity throughout the

16

367

room and thus provide UV illumination from more directions and a higher total illumination

368

intensity.

369

4.1.2 UV Illumination from Multiple Directions Can Reduce Shielding from UV

370

UV intensities within refractively shielded regions can be increased by illuminating the

371

particles from widely separated angles (Fig. 6 e-g), in cases where such illumination is possible.

372

Wide-angle illumination can be achieved to varying degrees by using multiple UV light sources,

373

and/or using movable or robotically controlled sources. Equal magnitude waves propagating in

374

opposite directions have been used previously to increase the light intensities in the lowest

375

regions of a sphere (Hill et al., 1998). Painting the walls and other surfaces with a highly UV-

376

reflective paint (Ryan et al., 2010; Rutala et al., 2013; Krishnamoorthy and Tande, 2016) also

377

typically increases the UV illumination from many angles.

378

4.1.3 Particles in Air May Rotate to be UV Illuminated from Many Directions

379

Refractive shielding of virions in particles that rotate through all orientations is small, as

380

illustrated in Fig. 7. Absorptive shielding can still be significant, but did not have a large effect

381

with the mi used for airway fluids even in 9-µm particles. Whether or not an airborne particle of

382

a certain size rotates through enough angles to have a only small amount of refractive shielding

383

and a smaller effect of absorptive shielding depends on the particle size and shape, the

384

illumination times, positions of the UV lights, and airflows (turbulent, laminar, circuitous or

385

straight). If the UVGI system is in a flow-through configuration (such as a HVAC system),

386

larger particles may be removed by filters at the entrance of the UVGI system.

387

390

primarily on virions in particles in dried respiratory droplets. Large variations occur in

391

concentrations in airway fluids of materials such as mucins, other proteins, DNA, inorganic salts,

392

uric acid, and other components of broken cells (Wyllie et al., 2020; Hawkins et al., 1963;

393

Araujo et al., 2020). Even for a single person these concentrations may depend upon hydration,

394

exercise, odors, time of day, time since last meal, etc. They also vary from person to person.

395

The uncertainty associated with unknown concentrations and absorptivities of the primary

396

absorbing molecules arises in the common case where a large predominance of non-viral

397

material in a particle (e.g., lysed cell material) is not understood. To account for such variability

398

and see which parameters the shielding most depends upon, the model results are calculated for

399

the mi spanning a large range. Variations and uncertainties in the densities and compositions of

400

the dried particles may be the largest sources of differences between the calculations illustrated

401

here and any specific particle of dried respiratory fluids. The absorptive and refractive shielding

402

illustrated here are general; however, variations in measured saliva and other fluids are large.

403

For example, nucleic acids are some of the most, if not the most, important UV absorbing

404

materials in saliva at 260 nm. However, reported concentrations of DNA in saliva vary widely

405

from 0.01 to 0.28 mg/ml as measured by Poehls et al., (2018). Review of the literature revealed

406

no measurements of RNA concentrations in saliva other than measurements of RNA viruses.

407

The particles here were assumed to be very dry, as in low humidity environments. Higher

408

humidity would result in higher water contents of the particles, lower densities and larger

409

penetration depths.

410

4.2.2 Dried droplets are neither perfectly spherical nor optically homogeneous

411

Actual dried particles of airway fluids are not totally spherical and not likely to be optically

412

homogeneous. For particles formed by drying droplets of simulated respiratory fluids (water,

413

mucin, NaCl and DPPC) on a superhydrophobic surface, the particles with sizes similar to those

414

modeled here were somewhat spherical. In the larger dried droplets, crystals of mucin, NaCl,

415

and DPPC formed, in some cases making the particles inhomogeneous and less spherical

416

(Vejerano and Marr, 2018). The use of four components (NaCl, mucin, DPPC and water) for the

417

simulated saliva may be the reason for this crystallization into what appear to be somewhat pure

418

materials, and the resulting nonsphericity. Human saliva, on the other hand, is highly complex

419

(Edgar et al., 2012; Poehls et al., 2018; Hawkins et al. 1963; Araujo et al., 2020; Peden et al.,

420

1990) as seen in Section 2.2 above. There are many different inorganic (Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+,

421

Cl-, PO43-, HCO3-, SCN- , F-) electrolytes, organic acids (lactic and uric acids), glucose, amino

422

acids, peptides, proteins, nucleic acids, etc. Also, DNA and RNA in saliva increase the viscosity.

423

It is therefore not clear which materials, if any, crystalize as pure components when droplets of

424

airway fluids dry, and therefore, whether this possible cause of nonsphericity and inhomogeneity

425

is relevant in dried droplets of actual respiratory fluids.

426

Although there are uncertainties about the shapes and homogeneities of dried droplets of

427

airway fluids, some general comments about shielding in such particles can be made. First, as

428

illustrated in the first panel of Fig. 1, neither refractive nor absorptive shielding requires

429

spherical particles. Second, given the complexity of airway fluids, it seems unlikely that

430

differences in refractive index within the particle will be as large as those between pure NaCl and

431

a typical protein; we think the maximum differences are likely to be far less. Also, a small

432

amount of inhomogeneity appears to have a small effect. For example, adding 90 randomly

433

located virions to a 9 µm particle containing 10 virions resulted in changes in Ri of the initial 10

434

virions ranging from 0.03% to -0.27%. Third, if the surface of a particle were sufficiently rough

435

that it scattered the UV illumination light in all directions as the light entered the particle, then,

19

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.19.20233437; this version posted November 22, 2020. The copyright holder for this

436

as can be envisioned using Fig. 1a and 1b, refractive shielding could far less than it would be in

437

an otherwise identical particle with a smooth surface. Fourth, inhomogenities such as large air

438

pockets forming within droplets as they dry, or large cracks occurring as the particles shrink,

439

may have large impacts on the UV intensity distribution. It is, however, difficult to see how a

440

single air pocket or crack would eliminate the potential for refractive shielding, at least at some

441

illumination angles, unless there were multiple cracks and the sides of them were rough. Also,

442

air pockets or wide cracks could decrease absorptive shielding for some illumination angles.

443

Fifth, the locations of the virions in particles are not known (Vejerano and Marr, 2018).

444

However, as a droplet dries, and as water evaporates and leaves behind a more concentrated

445

region near the droplet surface, the 100-nm virions are likely to diffuse more slowly toward

446

center of the droplet (where the concentration of everything except water is lower) than do

447

proteins and smaller molecules. If that is the case, and so if virions are more likely to occur in

448

the outer fraction of the dried droplet, then the actual fraction of particles which can be

449

refractively shielded is likely to be more than is now indicated in the figures and Table 3. Figure

450

2 shows that the most shielded virions, for a particle on a surface and a normally incident plane

451

wave, are near the outside of the particle. Even for δ = 2.84 µm with the 9-µm particle in Fig 2b,

452

particles within approximately 2 µm of the center point of the particle appear to have Ri > 0.1. In

453

the outer approximately 1.5 µm of the hemisphere closest to the surface some particles are well-

454

shielded. Thus, if the virions localize to the surface of the dried droplet as hypothesized above,

455

the overall shielding would increase for fixed particles on a surface.

456

4.3 Interventions to Circumvent the Effects of Shielding of Virions from UV Light

457

For particles on surfaces, using multiple UV-light sources positioned to illuminate from

458

widely varying angles can strongly reduce shielding of virions (see Fig 6 e-g and Table 3).

20

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.19.20233437; this version posted November 22, 2020. The copyright holder for this

459

Similar reductions in shielding can also be obtained using movable light sources. Painting the

460

walls and other surfaces in a room with highly reflective paint can increase the UV intensities in

461

otherwise shielded regions, partly by increasing the number of directions from which a particle is

462

illuminated, and can increase the total intensity illuminating the particles.

463

For particles in air, UVGI systems may be designed so that particles are illuminated from

464

approximately all orientations, even for large particles moving through the system too quickly to

465

rotate through a large angular range. Or the system may be designed so that all particles have

466

time to rotate though a sufficiently large range of angles to approximate the all orientations

467

results of Fig. 7. In flow-through UVGI systems, filters which remove a high percentage of

468

particles larger than, e.g., 5 µm, are common (Kowalski, 2009). Such filters reduce the need to

469

design the UV optics to inactivate larger particles. Rotation of particles in turbulent air flowing

470

through a system (UVGI or other) is a topic that appears to need further investigation.

471

5. Conclusions

472

Virions in particles may be partially shielded from UV. Refractive shielding is a primary

473

means of protection from UV, and occurs even in weakly UV absorbing particles. It results

474

primarily from refraction and reflection of light at the front surface of the particle. Absorptive

475

shielding is most important at the wavelengths of germicidal UV (260 nm used here), where

476

nucleic acids and aromatic amino acids absorb UV light well, especially in large particles with

477

diameters several times larger than the penetration depth. Absorptive shielding is much less

478

important at the solar UV wavelength (302 nm) used here.

479

The extent to which these modeling results apply to actual dried droplets of respiratory fluids

480

depends on the characteristics of the actual dried particles. In this study the optical properties of

481

the droplets are assumed to be homogeneous, except for the virions, and all droplets and virions

483

and the effects of location of the virions are discussed in Section 4.2. As illustrated in Fig. 1a,

484

and readily envisioned from the ray optics (Chowdhury et al., 1991) shielding can occur in

485

nonspherical particles which have a smooth surface. The nonsphericity that could strongly

486

decrease shielding would be a rough surface that scattered the UV light into the particle in all

487

directions.

488

The key point of relevance to designers and users of UVGI systems is: these results suggest

489

that shielding of virions from UV can be reduced by illuminating virion-containing particles with

490

light from widely separated directions (see Figs. 6e-g).

491

For inactivation of virions in particles on surfaces, illuminating with UV from more, widely

492

separated, directions can help reduce the refractive shielding (Figs. 6e-g). Painting walls and

493

other surfaces in a room with a highly UV-reflective paint (Rutala et al., 2013; Krishnamoorthy

494

and Tande, 2016) can help increase the angles from which the UV illuminates the particles on

495

surfaces, and increase the UV intensity in the room, as compared with the same room with less

496

reflective surfaces.

497

For inactivation of virions in particles in air, UV illumination of particles from many angles

498

can be easier to achieve because particles change their orientation with respect to the source(s) of

499

UV illumination as they move through a UVGI system and rotate to some degree. Do the

500

particles of the relevant sizes rotate sufficiently as they traverse the UVGI system so that

501

shielding of virions from UV is low? For a 5- or 9-µm diameter particle traversing a UVGI

502

system in 1 s, the Brownian rotational diffusion is too small to avoid shielding from UV if a

503

single UV source is employed and reflectivities of surfaces are small. Turbulent airflows may

504

provide adequate rotational motion for the virions in particles to avoid UV shielding in large

505

particles. To reduce the problem of needing rotation to avoid shielding, UVGI systems that

506

illuminate particles somewhat uniformly from all directions as they flow through the system may

507

be ideal. Alternatively, UVGI systems which illuminate from one direction, or directions

508

separated by a not-large angle, may reduce shielding adequately if they are designed so that even

509

the largest particles have sufficient time to rotate through a sufficiently wide range of angles as

510

they flow through the system. Or, in many cases, the large particles may be removed from the

511

airflow with a suitable filter.

Figure 2: The spatial distribution of virions in 3D within a 9-µm diameter sphere
approximating a spherical particle of dried airway fluids. The color of each virion
indicates the Ri, the relative UV intensity within that virion, and is proportional to the
rate of absorption of UV energy by that virion. Results were calculated using the
MSTM. The outer edge of the larger particle is not shown, but is just outside the
outermost virion locations. The Ri were calculated using 120 sets of 100 virions
each. B: A slice through the center of the sphere including all virions with -0.5 <

UV wave is normal to the surface and the other is 80 deg from the normal. In (d) both waves are
incident 80 deg from the normal to the surface but the azimuthal angle is 0 deg in one and 180

differ in having azimuthal angles of 0, 90, 180 and 270°. In (f), three incident UV waves are
used, the two waves as in (d) but also with the normal-incidence wave of (a). In (g), five
incident UV waves are used: the four waves as in (g) but also with the normal-incidence wave of
(a). Each incident UV plane wave has the same intensity. To compute the intensities within
virions the intensity for each angle of incidence is averaged. The area under the histograms has

histograms in solid bars are for intensities averaged over all orientations. Histograms indicated
by the blue line are for the same particle, in air, but in a single orientation. Histograms shown by
the orange line are for the same particle, but held on a surface (mr = 1.4) at a single orientation.
In (a) the particle is 5-µm diameter. In (b) the particle is 9-µm diameter. The orientationaveraged simulations used in (a) 3000 virions (30 runs of 100 virions for a 9-µm particle), and in
