Abstract:
Background: Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or cytokine storm is thought to be the cause of
inflammatory lung damage, worsening pneumonia and death in patients with COVID-19.
Steroids (Methylprednisolone or Dexamethasone) and Tocilizumab (TCZ), an interleukin‐6
receptor antagonist, are approved for the treatment of CRS in India. The aim of this study was to
evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination therapy of TCZ and steroids in COVID-19
associated CRS.
Methods: This retrospective cohort study was conducted at a tertiary level private hospital in
Pune, India between 2nd April and 2nd November 2020. All patients administered TCZ and
steroids for treatment of CRS were included. The primary endpoint was incidence of all-cause
mortality. Secondary outcomes studied were need for mechanical ventilation and incidence of
infectious complications. Baseline and time-dependent risk factors significantly associated with
death were identified by Relative risk estimation.
Results: Out of 2831 admitted patients, 515 (24.3% females) were administered TCZ and
steroids. Median age of the cohort was 57 (IQR: 46.5, 66) years. Almost 72 % patients had
preexisting co-morbidities. Median time to TCZ administration since onset of symptoms was 9
days (IQR: 7, 11). 63% patients needed intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Mechanical
ventilation was required in 242 (47%) patients. Of these, 44.2% (107/242) recovered and were
weaned off the ventilator. There were 135 deaths (26.2%), while 380 patients (73.8%) had
clinical improvement. Infectious complications like hospital acquired pneumonia, bloodstream
bacterial and fungal infections were observed in 2.13 %, 2.13 % and 0.06 % patients
respectively. Age ≥ 60 years (p=0.014), presence of co-morbidities like hypertension (p = 0.011),
IL-6 ≥ 100 pg/ml (p = 0.002), D-dimer ≥ 1000 ng/ml (p < 0.0001), CT severity index ≥ 18 (p <
0.0001) and systemic complications like lung fibrosis (p = 0.019), cardiac arrhythmia (p <
0.0001), hypotension (p < 0.0001) and encephalopathy (p < 0.0001) were associated with
increased risk of death.
Conclusions: Combination therapy of TCZ and Steroids is likely to be safe and effective in the
management of COVID-19 associated cytokine release syndrome. Efficacy of this antiinflammatory combination therapy needs to be validated in randomized controlled clinical trials.

Introduction:
In December, 2019, Wuhan city, the capital of Hubei province in China, became the centre of an
outbreak of viral pneumonia. By Jan 7, 2020, scientists had isolated a novel RNA, beta
coronavirus from these patients. It was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) due to its sequence homology with SARS-COV-1

[1]

. The disease caused by

SARS-COV-2 was later designated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in February 2020, by
World health organization (WHO)

[2]

. COVID-19 spread rapidly worldwide and India was no

exception. By 2nd November 2020 there have been more than 9 million infections and 0.14
million deaths due to COVID-19 in India [3].
The clinical presentation of COVID-19 is highly heterogeneous, ranging from
asymptomatic cases, mild infection and severe pneumonia. In severe and critical cases, which
occur in approximately 15 % and 5 % of patients, pneumonia can lead to acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS) that could need invasive mechanical ventilation

[1, 4-7]

. Critically ill

COVID-19 patients have a mortality rate ranging from 35 to 62% [8-10].
The disease is characterized by 2 phases; viral replication phase and the host
inflammatory response phase

[11]

. Host inflammatory response phase leading to inflammatory

lung damage is usually seen 7 days after symptom onset. SARS-CoV-2 can replicate within the
pulmonary tissue, activate innate immune response, leading to production of cytokines
(Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1B), Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)) by alveolar
macrophages which are required for recruitment of adaptive immunity cells. The transition
between innate and adaptive immune responses is critical for the clinical trajectory of SARSCoV-2 infection [11-15]. Adaptive immune response controlled by immune regulatory cells can be
a protective immune response or a dysregulated and exacerbated inflammatory response [12]. The
protective response is T cell dependent, with CD4 cells helping B cells to produce specific
neutralizing antibodies against viral spike (S) protein and cytotoxic CD8 cells eliminating virus
infected cells. Protective immune response is present in patients with asymptomatic, mild and
some moderate infections that do not progress to severe disease

[12]

. However, amongst severe

and critically ill COVID-19 patients, there is a dysregulated pulmonary and systemic immune
response. This dysregulated immune response also known as cytokine release syndrome (CRS)
or cytokine storm is characterized by activation of innate immune system, elevation in systemic

inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and Ddimer) and aberrant pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion (IL-6, soluble IL-2 receptor [IL-2R],
IL-10, TNF-α) by alveolar macrophages. It is also accompanied by depleted adaptive immune
response. Lymphopenia (decline in CD4+ T cell, CD8+ T cell, Natural killer cell but not in B
cell subset) and decreased Interferon Gamma (IFN-γ) expression in CD4+ T cells (CD4+ T cell
dysfunction) are immediate consequences of decline in adaptive immunity [12-15]. Cytokine storm
leads to destruction of alveolar epithelial cells, increased pulmonary vascular permeability,
worsening pneumonia, worsening oxygenation, increased risk of thrombosis and progression to
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [15]. Rising levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in severe
COVID-19 have been associated with increased likelihood of ARDS, mechanical ventilation and
mortality [16-19].
Steroids, namely Dexamethasone and Methylprednisolone have been extensively used to
resolve hyperinflammation and inflammatory lung damage in COVID-19

[20-23]

. After the

publication of RECOVERY trial, Dexamethasone was approved by World health organization
(WHO) as an immunomodulatory drug for use in hospitalized COVID-19 patients who require
oxygen. The benefit of Dexamethasone was greatest for patients who were receiving invasive
mechanical ventilation at the time of randomization

[21]

. In patients with moderate to severe

COVID-19, an early short course of methylprednisolone had a reduced rate of the primary
composite endpoint of death, ICU transfer, and mechanical ventilation [22]. In patients already on
mechanical ventilation, use of Methylprednisolone was associated with increased ventilator-free
days and higher probability of extubation [23]. However steroids alone might not be able to tackle
cytokine storm in all patients. Other Immunomodulatory drugs such as selective cytokine
inhibitors could be of incremental benefit to suppress the hyperinflammation if used in
combination with steroids.
Tocilizumab (TCZ) is a recombinant humanized monoclonal interleukin-6 receptor (IL6R) antibody of the IgG1 subtype. TCZ specifically binds and inhibits soluble and membranebound IL-6 receptors (sIL-6R and mIL-6R) and terminates downstream intracellular signal
transduction

[24, 25]

. It has been approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis

systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis

[27]

[26]

and

. In addition, it has also been used in treatment of

Castleman disease [28] and Crohn's disease [29]. In August 2017, the United States Food and Drug

Administration (FDA) approved TCZ for the treatment of cytokine release syndrome (CRS)
caused by chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) immunotherapy

[30]

. Indian council of

Medical research (ICMR) guidelines published by Government of India for guidance of
physicians in clinical management of COVID-19, have included TCZ as investigational therapy
for off label use in patients with moderate disease with progressively increasing oxygen
requirements and in mechanically ventilated patients not improving despite use of steroids [31].
This recommendation stems from multiple retrospective and small prospective studies [3258]

, that have suggested strong benefits due to use of TCZ in form of reduced risk of invasive

mechanical ventilation or death in patients with severe COVID-19. On the other hand, data from
randomized controlled trials (RCT) has shown disappointing results with evidence of modest
efficacy and no mortality benefit

[59-63]

. RCT’s have shown that TCZ reduces need for ICU

admission and mechanical ventilation in patients with severe COVID-19
the 4 RCT’s, only the EMPACTA trial

[62]

[61, 62]

. However, out of

used concomitant TCZ plus steroids in management

of COVID-19 induced hyperinflammation. As a result more evidence regarding positioning of
TCZ as an immunomodulatory therapy in COVID-19 needs to be published. Data from resource
limited settings like India regarding use of TCZ and steroids in treatment of CRS has also been
scarce

[64, 65]

. The aim of this single center retrospective cohort study conducted in Pune, India

was to estimate the efficacy and safety of combination therapy of TCZ and steroid in
management of COVID-19 associated CRS.

Methods:
Study Setting:
This retrospective cohort study was conducted at Noble hospital and Research Centre
(NHRC), Pune, Western India. NHRC is a tertiary level private hospital designated for clinical
management of COVID-19 patients in Pune since 23rd March 2020. Pune is located in the state
of Maharashtra, Western India and was one of the epicenters of COVID-19 epidemic in India. As
of 2nd November 2020, Maharashtra state has reported more than 1.71 million cases of COVID19 and more than 45,000 deaths [3]. Till 2nd November 2020, NHRC has admitted 2831 COVID19 patients.
NHRC provides clinical care, diagnostic and treatment services to COVID-19 patients at
a subsidized cost. Patients are referred from primary care physicians, private practitioners of

alternative medical systems, primary level COVID care centers (both government run and
private owned) and other tertiary level hospitals. Data of all hospitalized COVID-19 patients is
entered into an electronic database (Lifeline electronic database, Manorama infosystems,
Kolhapur, India). Data was obtained from electronic health record of each individual by manual
abstraction. It included hospitalization dates, demographics, co-morbidities, clinical examination
data, laboratory data (including inflammatory markers), microbiology reports, imaging reports
(X ray chest and High resolution computerized tomography scan (HRCT chest)), data on use of
supplemental oxygen, ventilation parameters (noninvasive or invasive ventilation) and hospital
outcomes. Ordinal scale for COVID-19 severity was noted for all patients at hospital admission,
during hospital stay and at discharge or death. The 8 level ordinal scale is as follows: 1 =
ambulatory and no restriction of activities; 2 = ambulatory and restriction of activities due to use
of home oxygen therapy or complications; 3 = Hospitalized but no oxygen therapy; 4 =
Hospitalized with oxygen therapy by nasal prongs; 5 = Hospitalized with oxygen therapy by Non
Re-breathing mask; 6 = Hospitalized with severe disease and on high flow nasal oxygen (HFNO)
or Noninvasive ventilation; 7 = Hospitalized with severe disease and on invasive mechanical
ventilation; 8 = Death.
Study Population:
Patients were eligible for inclusion in this analysis if they were admitted between 2nd
April 2020 and 2nd November 2020 and were administered TCZ. Criteria for prescribing TCZ
were developed by the Department of Infectious Diseases and Department of Critical care
medicine. Patients were administered TCZ if they satisfied following criteria for
hyperinflammation or CRS:
1) Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test positive for SARSCoV-2 RNA or positive COVID antibody test.
2) Lung Imaging: Moderate or severe pneumonia on High resolution Computerized
tomography scan (HRCT) of chest (CT severity index ≥ 8
evidence of pneumonia.

4a) Rapidly worsening respiratory status despite use of steroids and antiviral drugs:
Hypoxia (room air oxygen saturation (SPO2) < 90 %) and tachypnea (respiratory rate >
30 per minute) at rest or after minimal exertion which requires supplemental oxygen. OR
4b) Rapidly worsening respiratory status despite use of steroids and antiviral drugs:
Requirement of noninvasive or invasive ventilation to resolve hypoxia and tachypnea.
OR
4c) PaO2/FiO2 ratio of less than 300 mm Hg on room air.
5) Elevated inflammatory markers: IL-6 (> 100 pg/ml or 5 fold increase from prior level)
or one out of D-dimer (> 1000 ng/ml), Ferritin (> 1000 ng/ml) and CRP (> 10 mg/ml)
being elevated.
Exclusion criteria: Following patients were not prescribed TCZ during hospital admission or
were excluded from the analysis.
1) Pregnant females.
2) Patients having active systemic infections (bacterial/fungal), active tuberculosis and
active hepatitis B/C co-infection.
3) History of diverticulitis or inflammatory bowel disease.
4) Patients who refused TCZ therapy for management of CRS.
5) Patients administered TCZ in another institute prior to transfer to NHRC.
Tocilizumab was given intravenously at 8 mg/kg bodyweight (up to a maximum of 800
mg in two infusions, 12 hours apart). Additional doses were administered if patients were
morbidly obese (body weight > 100 kg) or to treat persistent hyperinflammation and worsening
ARDS. Patients or their immediate family members signed an informed consent form prior to
TCZ administration. The language in the consent form was non-prescriptive, saying that TCZ
can be used off-label in patients with COVID-19 induced hyperinflammation as per ICMR
guidelines. The consent form cautions that the evidence for benefit is modest; a risk for
infectious complications exists but in view of limited treatment options in patients with severe
pneumonia, therapy can be considered. The cost of TCZ (approximately 500 dollars for 1 vial of
400 mg) was borne by the patient as an out of pocket expense or by third party reimbursement
via medical health insurance.

For all patients administered TCZ, we also scrutinized inpatient case files until hospital
discharge, death, or December 2nd 2020—the date on which the database was locked—whichever
happened first. Number of TCZ doses given, type of concomitant steroid and dose of steroid
given and other concomitant medication prescribed to patient were noted. Time to TCZ
administration since onset of symptoms and time to TCZ administration since admission in
hospital was calculated. Oxygenation and ventilation outcomes in patients administered TCZ
plus steroids were noted. Systemic complications (including infectious complications)
developing in patients during hospital admission were also noted. All patients who died during
hospital admission were identified and a death audit to look for complications and cause of death
was undertaken. All patients who showed clinical improvement, got discharged from hospital
and had outpatient follow-up at 15 and 30 days after discharge were identified. Their outpatient
follow-up visits were traced from electronic database to look for delayed complications. There
was no control group in our study as all patients with suspicion of hyperinflammation or CRS
ended up getting TCZ and steroid.
Concomitant medications given for COVID-19 therapy:
NHRC follows the ICMR guidelines published by Government of India for COVID-19
management

[31]

. These guidelines get updated from time to time. All hypoxic COVID-19

patients who received TCZ in our cohort were already receiving antiviral agents, intravenous
steroids (Dexamethasone 6 mg per day or Methylprednisolone 40 mg twice a day) and systemic
anticoagulation (Low molecular weight heparin (Enoxaparin) or Unfractionated Heparin) as a
standard of care. Intravenous steroids were continued for a maximum of 10 days followed by
shift to oral Prednisolone in tapering doses over next 10 days. Hydroxychloroquine and
Lopinavir/ritonavir were initially recommended as standard antiviral therapy. Once clinical trial
and observational study data about lack of efficacy and toxicity was published, their use as
antivirals was discontinued [67-69]. Remdesvir was used as antiviral of choice at our institute since
July 26th, 2020 and was administered to all patients presenting with moderate or severe
pneumonia

[70]

. Convalescent plasma therapy (CPT) was also used in a subset of patients

presenting within 7 days of symptom onset as an antiviral agent. Adjunctive antibiotic and
antifungal therapy in patients to prevent bacterial and fungal super-infections was decided by the
infectious disease physician. After administration of TCZ, anti-fibrotic agents like Pirfenidone

(daily dosage ranging from 800 to 2000 mg per day) and Nintedanib (daily dosage of 150 mg
twice a day) were added to the treatment protocol for patients suspected of developing lung
fibrosis.
Outcomes:
Primary endpoint:
1) Deaths in the cohort after TCZ and steroid administration.
Secondary outcomes:
2) Number of patients who received noninvasive or invasive ventilation: Patients who
required mechanical ventilation (noninvasive or invasive) in our cohort were identified.
NHRC adopted the delayed intubation and delayed invasive mechanical ventilation
(IMV) policy for patients with COVID-19 associated ARDS. Patients not maintaining
arterial oxygen saturation (SPO2) > 90 % on supplemental oxygen (Non re-breathing
mask at 15 liters/minute) were initially started on noninvasive ventilation (NIV: High
flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) or Bi-level positive airway pressure (BIPAP)). The
indications for IMV in our hospital was respiratory failure on NIV, defined by any of the
following criteria: a) respiratory rate of 40 or more breaths per minute on NIV; b)
respiratory distress with activation of accessory respiratory muscles; c) the need for
fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 100 % on NIV to maintain an SPO2 level of 90%, or
a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of less than 100 mm Hg; d) Neurological deterioration (altered
consciousness with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 10 or higher) on treatment. For those
individuals in whom consent for the use of IMV was declined, NIV was continued till
either clinical recovery or death.
3) Number of patients who could be weaned off NIV or IMV and discharged from hospital.
4) Improvement in 8 point ordinal scale reflecting declining disease severity.
5) Incidence of infectious complications (bacterial or fungal super-infections) in patients
after TCZ and steroid administration: Patients developing fever (Temperature > 38.3
degrees Celsius), productive cough, leucocytosis (WBC count > 15,000 cells/mm3 with
predominance of Neutrophils and shift to left) or increased serum procalcitonin despite
adequate antibiotic and antifungal therapy were investigated for super-infections. All
positive blood and respiratory cultures (bacterial and fungal culture) were assessed by an

Infectious diseases physician to decide infection versus colonization. Infections were
included if they occurred > 48 hours after TCZ administration.
6) Incidence of systemic complications like cardiovascular (acute myocardial infarction,
congestive cardiac failure, arrhythmia and myocarditis), respiratory (lung fibrosis and
pulmonary embolism), neurologic (stroke, encephalopathy, meningo-encephalitis,
transverse myelitis and Guillaine Barre syndrome (GBS)), gastrointestinal (intestinal
perforation, gastroenteritis and abdominal blood vessel thrombosis), hepatic (hepatitis)
and renal complications (acute kidney injury) was estimated. Hepatitis was defined as
increase in total bilirubin or serum glutamate oxaloacetate/pyruvate transferase
(SGOT/SGPT) value more than three times above baseline value. Acute kidney injury
(AKI) was defined as abrupt (within 48 hours) reduction of kidney function manifesting
as a percentage increase in serum creatinine of 50 % or greater (1.5-fold from baseline) or
a reduction in urine output, defined as less than 0.5 ml/kg/hour for more than 6 hours [71].
Encephalopathy was defined as change in personality, behavior, cognition, or
consciousness (including clinical presentations of delirium or coma) in patients without
evidence of brain inflammation (increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein and CSF
pleocytosis) [72].
The use of database for clinical research was approved by the institutional review board
(IRB) of Noble hospital and Research Centre, Pune, India.

Statistical Methods:
Continuous variables were summarized using median and interquartile range (IQR),
while categorical variables were summarized using frequency and percentages. Continuous
variables were compared using a Mann Whitney U test. Categorical variables were compared
using Chi-square test, Proportion test and Fishers’ exact test. Baseline and time-dependent risk
factors significantly associated with death were identified by Relative risk estimation. Baseline
risk factors included were age (< 60 years or ≥ 60 years), gender, co-morbidities like diabetes,
hypertension, ischemic heart disease and chronic kidney disease and baseline investigations like
IL-6 (≥ 100 versus < 100 pg/ml), absolute lymphocyte count (< 1000 versus ≥ 1000 cells/mm3),
D-dimer (≥ 1000 versus < 1000 ng/ml) and CT severity index (≥ 18 versus < 18). Timedependent risk factors included systemic complications like lung fibrosis, arrhythmia,

hypotension, thrombocytopenia, hepatitis, acute kidney injury and encephalopathy. The p value

≤ 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. All data was analyzed by SPSS version 12.0.

Results:
Out of the 2831 COVID-19 patients admitted in NHRC, 515 were administered TCZ.
Median age of the cohort was 57 (IQR: 46.5, 66) years and it included 24.3 % females. Two
hundred and twenty two (43.1 %) patients were ≥ 60 years of age. Three hundred and seventy
three (72.4 %) patients had preexisting co-morbidities, with Diabetes mellitus (45.4 %) ,
Hypertension (48.3 %), Ischemic heart disease (13.6 %) , Chronic kidney disease (7.8 %) and
Obesity (Body mass index > 30 kg/m2, 9.5 %) being the commonest (Table 1). Preexisting comorbidities, presenting symptoms in patients at admission and investigations performed prior to
TCZ therapy are enumerated in Table 1 and 2 respectively. Fever (81%), dry cough (77%),
dyspnea on exertion (81%) and bodyache or myalgia (49 %) were the commonest symptoms
seen in patients (Table 1). Two hundred and twenty (220/515, 43%) patients had
lymphocytopenia (absolute lymphocyte count < 1000 copies/ml) while 16 % (80/515) patients
had thrombocytopenia (Platelet count < 150,000 cells/mm3) prior to TCZ administration. One
hundred and sixty one (161/515, 31.3 %) patients had IL-6 level ≥ 100 pg/ml, 22.7 % (117/515)
had CRP ≥ 100 mg/dl , 21 % (108/515) had D-dimer ≥ 1000 ng/ml and 23.7 % (122/515) had
serum Ferritin ≥ 1000 mg/dl prior to TCZ administration (Table 2). Out of 373 patients who
performed HRCT of Chest (GE Optima, 128 slice CT scanner), CT severity index indicated
moderate disease (CT severity index: 8-14) in 37.5 % (140/373) and severe disease (CT severity
index: 15-25) in 62.5 % (233/373) of patients. Three hundred and eighty seven (387/515, 75.1%)
patients had arterial blood gas analysis performed prior to TCZ therapy. PaO2/FiO2 ratio was in
the range of 200-300, 100-200 and < 100 mm Hg amongst 65 (16.8 %), 182 (47 %) and 140
(36.2 %) individuals respectively.
Total cumulative dose of TCZ administered was 400 mg, 800 mg and 1200 mg in 47.2 %
(243/515), 48 % (247/515) and 4.8 % (25/515) patients respectively. Median time to TCZ
administration since onset of symptoms was 9 days (IQR: 7, 11) and median time to TCZ
administration since hospital admission was 2 days (IQR: 2, 4). Overall 87.2 %, 90 % and
94.4 % patients were prescribed Remdesvir, Methylprednisolone and Low molecular weight or
conventional Heparin along with TCZ (Table 3). Intensive care unit (ICU) admission was needed

in 63.6 % (327/515) of patients while 36.4 % (187/515) patients recovered in isolation wards.
Two hundred and seventy three patients (53 %) required only supplemental oxygen prior to
recovery (improvement in ordinal scale from 4 or 5 to 1). Seventy one patients were already on
NIV or IMV (HFNO- 27, BIPAP- 41, IMV- 3) prior to TCZ administration while 171 patients
needed it after TCZ administration. Overall, 242 patients (47%) needed NIV and/or IMV, of
which 44.2 % (107/242) recovered and were weaned off the ventilator (improvement in ordinal
scale from 6 or 7 to 1). Two hundred and twenty three (223/242, 92.1%) patients required NIV
(HFNO/BIPAP) during the duration of the study out of which 104 (46.6%) could be weaned off
NIV and discharged from hospital (improvement in ordinal scale from 6 to 1). One hundred and
thirty (130/242, 53.7 %) patients required IMV, of whom only 3 survived (improvement in
ordinal scale from 7 to 1). Median time to hospital discharge or death was 13 days (IQR: 10, 17).
Among patients admitted in ICU, median duration of ICU stay was 10 days (IQR: 7, 16). In
patients needing mechanical ventilation (NIV or IMV), median duration of ventilation was 10
days (IQR: 6, 13). Median time spent on NIV was 7 (IQR: 3, 12) days while median time spent
on IMV was 3 (IQR: 2, 6) days. Twenty one (4.1 %) patients were administered hemodialysis
while 105 (20.4 %) needed vasopressor agents like Noradrenaline and Vasopressin for
hypotension (Table 3).
Systemic complications (fatal and nonfatal) observed in patients in our cohort are
enumerated in Table 4. Septic shock (persistent hypotension requiring vasopressors to maintain
systolic blood pressure > 100 mm Hg and a serum lactate level greater than 2 mmol/L) was noted
in 58 (11.3 %) patients, of whom 4 recovered after treatment. Infectious complications like
hospital or ventilator associated pneumonia (HAP/VAP), bloodstream bacterial infections and
bloodstream fungal infections were seen in 2.13 % (11/515), 2.13 % (11/515) and 0.06 % (3/515)
patients respectively. Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was the commonest
bacteria (6/11 cases) and Candida albicans was the commonest fungus (3/3 cases) isolated in
blood culture. Multidrug resistant Gram negative bacilli (Pseudomonas Aeruginosa (3/11),
Acinetobacter Baumanii (3/11) and Klebsiella pneumonia (2/11)) were the commonest causative
agents of HAP or VAP.
There were 135 deaths (26.2 %) during hospital admission. ICU mortality rate was 40.4%
while mortality rate amongst patients requiring NIV/IMV was 55.8 %. Of the 71 patients already

on NIV or IMV prior to TCZ administration, 70.4 % (50/71) died while 29.6 % (21/71) survived
and were discharged from hospital. Out of the 171 patients who required NIV and/or IMV after
TCZ administration, 49.7 % (85/171) died while 50.3 % (86/171) recovered. Commonest cause
of death was acute respiratory distress syndrome leading to respiratory failure. The relative risk
(RR) of death was significantly higher in patients with age ≥ 60 years (RR=1.555 (95% CI:
1.283, 1.884)), concomitant hypertension (RR=1.284 (95% CI: 1.070, 1.540)), preexisting
chronic kidney disease (RR=2.081 (95% CI: 1.147, 3.773)), IL-6 ≥ 100 pg/ml (RR=1.515 (95%
CI: 1.172, 1.956)), D-dimer ≥ 1000 ng/ml (RR=2.134 (95% CI: 1.542, 2.954)) and CT severity
index ≥ 18 (RR=2.491 (95% CI: 1.882, 3.299)). Development of systemic complications like
lung fibrosis (RR=1.439 (95% CI: 1.07, 1.934)), cardiac arrhythmia (RR=13.136 (95% CI:
5.561, 31.029)), hypotension (RR=18.296 (95% CI: 10.798, 31.000)), new onset or worsening
thrombocytopenia (RR=12.283 (95% CI: 6.574, 22.949)) and encephalopathy (RR=9.570 (95%
CI: 4.862, 18.837)) were also associated with increased risk of death (Figure 1, Table 5).
Out of the 380 patients (73.8 %) who recovered and were discharged from NHRC, 72
(18.9 %) needed short term home oxygen therapy after hospital discharge. Of these, two patients
reported worsening of respiratory symptoms at home leading to respiratory failure and death,
while 70 patients could be weaned off short term oxygen therapy. Four patients developed late
infectious complications (multidermatomal herpes zoster, herpes zoster opthalmicus, acute
bacterial cholecystitis and Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteremia and septic shock) within 1 month
of discharge from hospital. Three patients recovered after treatment, but the patient having E.
coli bacteremia progressed to septic shock, ARDS and died. One patient developed midbrain
encephalitis, 27 days after discharge from hospital and died (Total number of deaths: 139).

Discussion:
The goal of this retrospective observational cohort study conducted at a tertiary level,
private hospital in Pune, India was to assess efficacy and safety of combination therapy of TCZ
and steroids in treating CRS developing in patients with severe COVID-19. Our cohort consisted
of a relatively elderly population (43 % patients ≥ 60 years of age) with pre-existing comorbidities (72 % having co-morbidities) who developed pneumonia, hyperinflammation and
ARDS (100 % patients having increased inflammatory markers, 62.5 % having CT severity score
≥ 15 and 83 % having PaO2/FiO2 < 200 mm Hg). Almost 63 % patients in our cohort required

ICU care while 47 % patients needed noninvasive or invasive ventilation to maintain
oxygenation. In such a cohort of severely ill patients, administration of TCZ and steroid resulted
in clinical improvement in 74 % patients, while 26 % died due to respiratory failure. The
response to TCZ was rapid and sustained in majority of patients. Almost 44 % patients could be
weaned from ventilator support. However, there was a subset of patients on mechanical
ventilation who did show initial improvement after TCZ but subsequently had clinical
deterioration and died. This cohort includes 91% of all ICU admissions due to COVID-19 and
96% of all patients receiving mechanical ventilation at NHRC during the said period. To the best
of our knowledge, this cohort is the largest reported database of patients who were administered
TCZ plus steroids for management of COVID-19 induced CRS and ARDS. Two retrospective
cohort studies on TCZ usage from India have been published till date. The strengths of our study
compared to the earlier studies include the large number of enrolled patients [64], strict inclusion
and exclusion criteria applied while administering TCZ
ventilatory outcomes

[64,65]

[64,65]

, availability of data about

, availability of data about systemic complications (including

infectious complications) [64,65] and lower mortality rate [65].
In our cohort, 37% patients could be managed in isolation wards without need for
intensive care. In an ideal scenario, all patients were candidates for ICU care, but overburdened
healthcare system and shortage of ICU beds and ventilators meant that they were managed in
wards. In addition, 53% patients required only supplemental oxygen prior to recovery and did
not progress to mechanical ventilation. As per the CORIMUNO-19 RCT, use of TCZ among
patients on supplemental oxygen reduced the need for intensive care, noninvasive or invasive
mechanical ventilation by almost 40%. The effect of TCZ was numerically higher if combined
with steroids

[61]

. According to the EMPACTA RCT

[62]

and the TESEO cohort

[32]

, the

likelihood of progression to mechanical ventilation was significantly lower among patients who
received TCZ plus standard care than among those who received placebo plus standard care.
Reduction in need of ICU care can reduce the risk of long-term complications including death
and improve health-related quality of life. Preventing progression to mechanical ventilation
greatly alters patient outcomes and leads to better utilization of scarce healthcare resources.
Mortality rate in our cohort was 26 %, while mortality rate amongst patients requiring
ICU was 40 %. Overall mortality rate was similar to that seen in multiple retrospective cohort

[35, 36, 54, 57, 64]

.

Mortality rate amongst patients requiring mechanical ventilation

(NIV/IMV) was 56 %. This was higher as compared to other cohort studies

[40]

. It could be

related to delayed intubation and delayed invasive mechanical ventilation policy followed at our
hospital. On Relative risk estimation, age ≥ 60 years, presence of multiple co-morbidities,
increased baseline inflammatory markers (IL-6 and D-dimer), high CT severity index and
development of systemic complications like lung fibrosis, arrhythmia, encephalopathy,
thrombocytopenia and hypotension were significant risk factors associated with death. Females
had a higher mortality rate than males in our cohort (30.4 % versus 24.9 %, Table 2). Early
evidence indicates that males have higher overall burden, but females have a higher relative-risk
of COVID-19 mortality in India

[73]

. Marked sex differences in access to health services, with

women being less likely to be admitted to hospital than men might result in more severe cases of
COVID-19 among women than men in hospital settings and higher mortality [74].
TCZ and steroid combination therapy was safe and well tolerated. Infectious
complications like confirmed bacterial and fungal infections (including HAP/VAP and
bloodstream infections) were seen in 2% patients in the cohort. Low incidence of infectious
complications could be because of adequate, prophylactic antibiotic and antifungal therapy
prescribed to patients. Meropenem, Teicoplanin and Fluconazole were the commonest antibiotic
and antifungal drugs prescribed along with TCZ. Transaminitis or hepatitis, which is an adverse
event associated with TCZ, was seen in approximately 10% of patients. However, in view of
prescription of multiple drugs like Remdesvir, Fluconazole, Doxycycline, Pirfenidone and
Nintedanib along with TCZ, it was difficult to identify the cause of drug induced liver injury.
Intestinal perforation after TCZ administration was noted in two patients. Pulmonary
(progression of lung fibrosis) and infectious complications were noted even after discharge from
hospital. As a result, close follow up of patients for a period of 3 months after hospital discharge
is essential for immediate identification of delayed complications.
Limitations:
Our study has several limitations. First, it is not a randomized controlled trial, and
therefore unmeasured confounding cannot be ruled out. Second, as for all retrospective studies,
some individuals administered TCZ and steroids may be unreported leading to measurement bias
and overestimation of safety and efficacy of the combination therapy. Third, a comparator arm

was not possible in this pandemic setting. Considering the unavailability of observational or RCT
data about efficacy of other regimens to tackle hyperinflammation, worsening of respiratory
parameters seen in patients despite receiving potent steroids and life threatening nature of the
disease characterized by sudden worsening and rapid progression to respiratory failure over few
hours, a comparative arm could not be justified. Fourth, concomitant therapies like antiviral
drugs, convalescent plasma, anti-fibrotic agents, supplemental oxygen and ventilation strategies
(NIV/IMV) can help in reducing disease severity and clinical improvement. The authors
acknowledge the fact that individual contribution of each drug is difficult to estimate. However,
considering the predefined criteria for introduction of each drug in patient management, strict
inclusion and exclusion criteria applied while administering TCZ and steroids, large number of
patients enrolled and improvement in symptoms and oxygenation after TCZ administration, the
authors are reasonably confident that this study reliably captures the efficacy of this combination
in treating COVID-19 induced CRS. Fifth, an overwhelmed health care system, inadequate
workforce and lack of exhaustive reporting could be responsible for underestimation of comorbidities, presenting symptoms and complications amongst patients in our cohort. Sixth, Body
mass index (BMI) could not be calculated for patients who were bed ridden or those requiring
mechanical ventilation. Seventh, CT severity index and PaO2/FiO2 ratio was not available for all
patients in our cohort. Eighth, Sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score was not
performed in patients admitted in ICU

[75]

. Ninth, ventilator parameters like positive end

expiratory pressure (PEEP) and plateau pressure were not available for all patients started on
NIV or IMV. Tenth, patients were followed up after discharge from hospital for 1 month. As a
result long term complications due to immunomodulatory therapy could not be identified.
Despite these limitations, this retrospective cohort study from Western India adds to the
growing body of literature on use of TCZ and steroids as an anti-inflammatory combination
therapy in treating cytokine storm and resultant ARDS in COVID-19.

Conclusions:
Combination therapy of TCZ and Steroids is likely to be a safe and effective treatment
modality in management of COVID-19 associated cytokine release syndrome. Efficacy of this
anti-inflammatory combination therapy needs to be validated in large randomized controlled
clinical trials.
