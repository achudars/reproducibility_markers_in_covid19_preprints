ABSTRACT

2

Background – Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been associated with a coagulopathy

3

giving rise to venous and arterial thrombotic events. The objective of our study was to determine

4

whether markers of coagulation and hemostatic activation (MOCHA) on admission could

5

identify COVID-19 patients at risk for thrombotic events and other complications.

6

Methods – COVID-19 patients admitted to a tertiary academic healthcare system from April 3,

7

2020 to July 31, 2020 underwent standardized admission testing of MOCHA profile parameters

8

(plasma d-dimer, prothrombin fragment 1.2, thrombin-antithrombin complex, and fibrin

9

monomer) with abnormal MOCHA defined as ≥ 2 markers above the reference. Prespecified

10

thrombotic endpoints included deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial

11

infarction, ischemic stroke, and access line thrombosis; other complications included ICU

12

admission, intubation and mortality. We excluded patients on anticoagulation therapy prior to

13

admission and those who were pregnant.

14

Results – Of 276 patients (mean age 59 ± 6.4 years, 47% female, 62% African American race)

15

who met study criteria, 45 (16%) had a thrombotic event. Each coagulation marker on admission

16

was independently associated with a vascular endpoint (p<0.05). Admission MOCHA with ≥ 2

17

abnormalities (n=203, 74%) was associated with in-hospital vascular endpoints (OR 3.3, 95% CI

18

1.2-8.8), as were admission D-dimer ≥ 2000 ng/mL (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.5-6.6), and admission D-

19

dimer ≥ 3000 ng/mL (OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.6-7.9). However, only admission MOCHA with ≥ 2

20

abnormalities was associated with ICU admission (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.7-5.2) and intubation (OR

21

3.2, 95% CI 1.6-6.4), while admission D-dimer ≥2000 ng/mL and admission D-dimer ≥ 3000

22

ng/mL were not associated. MOCHA and D-dimer cutoffs were not associated with mortality.

1

Admission MOCHA with <2 abnormalities (26% of the cohort) had a sensitivity of 88% and

2

negative predictive value of 93% for a vascular endpoint.

3

Conclusions – Admission MOCHA with ≥ 2 abnormalities identified COVID-19 patients at

4

increased risk of ICU admission and intubation during hospitalization more effectively than

5

isolated admission D-dimer measurement. Admission MOCHA with <2 abnormalities identified

6

a subgroup of patients at low risk for vascular events. Our results suggest that an admission

7

MOCHA profile can be useful to risk-stratify COVID-19 patients.

INTRODUCTION

2

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been widely associated with the development of a

3

systemic coagulopathy that is likely multifactorial in etiology.1 COVID-19-associated

4

coagulopathy exhibits the classic components of Virchow’s triad, and there are ongoing efforts to

5

better characterize the underlying pathophysiology of the hypercoagulable state in the setting of

6

COVID-19 infection.2 Elevated levels of fibrin degradation products, particularly D-dimer, have

7

been used to predict venous thromboembolic events (VTE) and hypercoagulable states in various

8

disease states.3,4 Plasma D-dimer in COVID-19 patients was found to be a useful predictor of

9

VTE5,6 and thresholds of 2000 ng/mL or 3000 ng/mL have been suggested as indicators of

10

disease severity.7,8

11

A biomarker panel called the markers of coagulation and hemostatic activation (MOCHA),

12

which includes plasma D-dimer, prothrombin fragment 1.2, thrombin-antithrombin complex and

13

fibrin monomer levels, has been shown to predict subsequent diagnosis of new malignancy,

14

VTE, and other hypercoagulable states in patients with cryptogenic stroke.9,10 A previous study

15

has also demonstrated that a MOCHA profile with < 2 marker abnormalities can effectively rule

16

out hypercoagulable states in patients with embolic stroke of undetermined source.11

17

The objective of this study was to determine whether the admission MOCHA profile in

18

hospitalized COVID-19 patients could aid in risk stratification by identifying those patients at

19

low versus high risk of vascular thrombotic events, ICU admission, intubation and clinical

20

outcome more effectively than D-dimer alone.

1

Patients were prospectively identified from an admission census list that identified all COVID-19

2

patients admitted to four hospitals in Emory Healthcare, an urban, academic, tertiary healthcare

3

system in Atlanta, Georgia who had a MOCHA profile ordered on admission as part of a

4

standardized COVID-19 orderset from April 3, 2020 through July 31, 2020. Expert consensus of

5

a multidisciplinary working group recommended obtaining a MOCHA profile on all patients

6

admitted with a diagnosis of COVID-19. All patients were 18 years of age or older with

7

diagnosis of COVID-19 confirmed by PCR and had a MOCHA profile drawn within 72 hours of

8

hospitalization. For this analysis we excluded patients on outpatient anticoagulation therapy prior

9

to hospitalization due to the effect of anticoagulation on the MOCHA profile10 and pregnant

10

patients due to the lack of validated reference ranges. Electronic medical records were

11

retrospectively reviewed from admission through discharge or until the censor date of September

12

14, 2020 to identify venous and arterial thrombotic events. This study was approved by the

13

Emory University Institutional Review Board.

14

Patient demographics including age, sex, race, body mass index (BMI), and a history of

15

comorbidities including smoking, diabetes, hypertension, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary

16

disorder (COPD), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, end stage renal disease, atrial

17

fibrillation, prior VTE, coronary artery disease (CAD), stroke, and known active cancer were

18

collected. Total length of stay, length of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, length of

19

intubation, and final disposition were additionally recorded. Prespecified venous and arterial

20

endpoints monitored during hospitalization included deep vein thromboses (DVT), pulmonary

21

embolus (PE), myocardial infarction (MI), ischemic stroke, and dialysis or central line clots.

22

DVT was confirmed by duplex ultrasound and PE by CT, CT angiography or

23

ventilation/perfusion scans. MI was diagnosed as a troponin elevation and confirmation by a

2

board-certified neurologist. Central access and renal replacement therapy circuit thrombosis were

determined based on chart documentation.

Laboratory testing

6

Admission MOCHA profiles were obtained within 72 hours of hospitalization and included

7

plasma levels of D-dimer (reference value <574 ng/mL), prothrombin fragment 1.2 (reference

8

range 65-288 pmol/L), thrombin-antithrombin complex (reference range 1.0-5.5 µg/L), and

9

fibrin monomer (reference value <7 µg/mL). All assays were performed in the hospital clinical

10

laboratories using 3.2% citrated plasma specimens. D-dimer levels were measured with high-

11

sensitivity latex dimer assay (Instrumentation Laboratories, Bedford, MA). Both prothrombin

12

fragment 1.2 and thrombin-antithrombin complexes were measured with the Enzygnost ELISA

13

kit (Siemens Healthcare, Tarrytown, NY). Soluble fibrin monomer levels were measured by

14

latex immunoassay (Stago, Parsippany, NJ).

16

Statistical Analysis

17

Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data with results reported as percentages for

18

categorical variables. Means with standard deviations or medians with interquartile ranges were

19

reported for normally distributed and skewed variables, respectively. Comparisons between

20

means or medians of continuous variables were assessed with independent T-tests (two-tailed) or

21

by the Mann-Whitney U non-parametric test, respectively. Categorical variables were compared

22

with Pearson’s chi-square and Fisher Exact tests. Significance for all descriptive analyses was set

at p<0.05. Univariable analyses were conducted using binary logistic regression for binary

2

outcome variables (vascular endpoint, VTE, ICU admission, intubation and mortality).

3

Statistically significant predictors of these outcomes (p<0.10) were then considered in

4

multivariable binary logistic regression analyses to identify independent outcome predictors

5

(adjusted p<0.05). The association with thrombotic events within 14 days of admission was

6

additionally examined.

7

The frequency of D-dimer and MOCHA profile abnormalities were recorded and subsequently

8

analyzed in specific patient subsets, including those with ICU admission and intubation. The four

9

parameters of the MOCHA profile were independently assessed using receiver operator

10

characteristic (ROC) curve analysis in order to determine the area under the curve (AUC) as a

11

measure of discriminative power. Patients were stratified based on the number of elevated

12

MOCHA markers on admission. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and

13

negative predictive value (NPV) were evaluated at different MOCHA and D-dimer cutoffs. This

14

was used to identify optimal thresholds for predicting thrombotic endpoints and to compare the

15

performance of admission MOCHA with admission D-dimer alone. Statistical analyses and

16

figures were generated using SPSS version 26 software.

Descriptive Data

20

A total of 297 confirmed COVID-19 patients were hospitalized during the study period and had

1

The mean age of the cohort was 59 ± 6 years, 130 (47%) were female, and 160 (62%) were

2

African American. Median BMI was 30 (IQR: 26-37) kg/m2 (Table 1). Common comorbidities

3

included hypertension (59%), obesity (n=140, 51%) and diabetes (n=108, 39%). The median

4

duration of hospitalization was 10 days (IQR: 6-19) including 159 patients (58%) admitted to the

5

ICU during their hospitalization, 90 (33%) who were intubated. Amongst the cohort, 241 (87%)

6

patients were discharged, 31 (11%) died and 4 (1%) remained hospitalized as of the censor date.

7

Frequency of Vascular Events

8

Vascular events were diagnosed in 45 patients (16%) (Table 2). Median number of days to

9

diagnosis of vascular event was 7 days (IQR: 2-15) from admission, with 32 (71%) of these

10

events occurring within the first two weeks of hospitalization. DVT occurred in 24 (8.7%)

11

patients, PE in 8 (2.9%), MI in 4 (1.5%), ischemic stroke in 5 (1.8%) and central or dialysis line

12

thrombosis in 7 (2.5%) patients; three patients (1%) developed more than one of these

13

complications.

14

Overall, 7 (2.5%) patients had no MOCHA abnormalities on admission, 66 (24%) had one

15

abnormality, 62 (23%) had two abnormalities, 69 (25%) had three abnormalities, and 72 (26.1%)

16

had abnormalities in all four MOCHA; 217 patients (79%) had an abnormal D-dimer on

17

admission, 51 (19%) had an admission D-dimer greater than 2000 ng/mL, and 40 (15%) had an

18

admission D-dimer greater than 3000 ng/mL. There were 115 (42%) patients who had an

19

elevated prothrombin fragment 1.2 level, 185 (67%) with an elevated thrombin-antithrombin

20

complex level, and 167 (61%) with elevated fibrin monomer levels. The frequency of thrombotic

21

events, ICU admission and intubation rates progressively increased with the number of MOCHA

22

abnormalities (Figure 1).

Association of Admission MOCHA and D-dimer with Vascular Events

3

In univariable analysis admission MOCHA ≥ 2 abnormalities, D-dimer ≥ 2000 ng/mL, D-dimer

4

≥ 3000 ng/mL, BMI, and CAD were significantly associated with vascular events. However, in

5

multivariable analysis only MOCHA ≥ 2 (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.2-8.8; p=.02), BMI (OR 1.04, 95%

6

CI 1.0-1.1; p=.03), D-dimer ≥ 2000 ng/mL (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.5-6.6; p=.003), and D-dimer ≥

7

3000 ng/mL (OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.6-7.9; p=.002) were significant. In multivariable analysis,

8

factors associated with vascular events within 14 days of admission included male sex (OR 2.2,

9

95% CI 1.0-5.0; p=.049), MOCHA ≥ 2 abnormalities (OR 6.4, 95% CI 1.5-27.6; p=.013) and D-

10

dimer ≥ 2000 ng/mL (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.1-5.9; p=.03).

11

12

Association of Admission MOCHA and D-Dimer with ICU Admission, Intubation and Mortality

13

In univariable analysis, admission MOCHA ≥ 2 abnormalities and a history of stroke were

14

significantly associated with ICU admission. However, in multivariable analysis, only admission

15

MOCHA ≥ 2 abnormalities was a significant predictor of ICU admission (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.7-

16

5.2; p=.0001).

17

With regards to the risk of respiratory deterioration and intubation, BMI, history of hypertension,

18

and MOCHA ≥ 2 abnormalities were associated with intubation in univariable analysis. In

19

multivariable analysis, MOCHA ≥ 2 abnormalities (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.6-6.4; p=.001) and BMI

20

(OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.0-1.1; p=.017) remained significant. D-dimer was not significantly

21

associated with either ICU admission or intubation.

1

In univariable analysis, admission MOCHA ≥ 2 abnormalities, history of stroke, hypertension,

2

diabetes and BMI were significantly associated with mortality. In multivariable analysis, only

3

BMI remained a significant predictor of mortality (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.08; p=0.02).

4

Value of Admission MOCHA and D-dimer in Predicting Vascular Events, VTE, ICU Admission,

5

and Intubation

6

Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV at different MOCHA and D-dimer cutoffs are shown in

7

Table 3. A MOCHA profile with ≥ 2 abnormalities had a sensitivity of 89% (NPV 93%) for a

8

vascular thrombotic event through total hospitalization, 94% (NPV 97%) for a vascular

9

thrombotic event within two weeks of admission, and 96% (NPV 99%) for VTE within two

10

weeks of admission. D-dimer level ≥ 2000 ng/mL on admission had a sensitivity of 33% (NPV

11

87%) for a vascular thrombotic event through total hospitalization, sensitivity of 31% (NPV

12

90%) for a vascular thrombotic event within two weeks of admission and a sensitivity of 43%

13

(NPV 94%) for VTE within two weeks.

14

ROC curve analysis showed that all four MOCHA parameters were independent predictors of

15

any vascular endpoint (p<.01). However, the discriminative power for MOCHA was highest for

16

VTE within the first two weeks of admission, during which time D-dimer and thrombin-

17

antithrombin complex both had AUC 0.74, prothrombin fragment 1.2 had AUC 0.68 and fibrin

18

monomer AUC 0.62.

DISCUSSION

21

Our study provides systematic assessment of the admission MOCHA profile in hospitalized

22

COVID-19 patients and its association with vascular thrombotic events. While the frequency of

elevated D-dimer and prothrombin fragment 1.2 is similar to those reported in recent studies7,12,

2

our study is the first to report the frequency of thrombin-antithrombin complex and fibrin

3

monomer levels in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. While ≥ 2 abnormalities in the admission

4

MOCHA profile and D-dimer cutoffs were significantly associated with vascular thrombotic

5

events only the admission MOCHA profile was associated with subsequent ICU admission and

6

intubation whereas D-dimer cutoffs of ≥ 2000 ng/mL and ≥ 3000 ng/mL were not.

7

We assessed these four markers of coagulation and hemostatic activation given their prior

8

association with thrombotic events.9-11 D-dimer is a marker of fibrinolysis as a byproduct of

9

fibrin degradation. Prothrombin fragment 1.2 is a marker of coagulation activation and released

10

during conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. Thrombin-antithrombin complex is a marker of

11

coagulation activation and a complex formed during thrombin formation. Fibrin monomer

12

(soluble fibrin) is a marker of coagulation activation and a byproduct of fibrinogen conversion to

13

fibrin.14

14

We found no association between admission MOCHA profile or admission D-dimer and

15

mortality, contrary to early studies from China which suggested that D-dimer was a predictor of

16

mortality in pooled analysis.13 There are several factors which may contribute to this difference:

17

1) our patients were all placed on prophylactic or therapeutic doses of anticoagulation therapy

18

according to our local guidelines which may have influenced overall mortality rates which are

19

lower in our cohort than other studies in the pooled analysis8; 2) the Chinese studies in this

20

pooled analysis were all retrospective cohorts and excluded patients who were still hospitalized

21

at the end of the study period contributing to a high risk of bias.13

22

Given current recommendations on the use of anticoagulation therapy in COVID-19 patients15,

23

we also sought to identify whether the MOCHA profile could identify a COVID-19 patient

subgroup that was at low risk for vascular thrombotic events. In our cohort, 26% of patients on

2

admission had 0 or 1 MOCHA abnormality with NPV of 93% for vascular thrombotic events and

3

NPV of 95% for VTE. These data suggest that this patient subgroup is at low risk for subsequent

4

thrombotic complications.

5

This study had several limitations. As the data was collected from a single academic healthcare

6

system, the generalizability of these findings needs to be studied in other settings. Our study

7

focused on admission coagulation markers to aid in early risk stratification for COVID-19

patients however it is unknown whether serial measurements and changes in values across time

9

may be better predictors. Lastly, our study did not assess whether the MOCHA profile could be

10

used to guide anticoagulation therapy and how that may impact overall thrombotic events and

11

clinical outcome.

12

In summary, the admission MOCHA profile of hospitalized COVID-19 patients is useful in

13

identifying hospitalized patients who are at increased risk for subsequent arterial and venous

14

thrombotic events and more effectively identifies patients requiring ICU admission and

15

intubation than admission D-dimer levels alone. Further investigation is needed to determine the

16

utility of the MOCHA profile to guide anticoagulation therapy.
