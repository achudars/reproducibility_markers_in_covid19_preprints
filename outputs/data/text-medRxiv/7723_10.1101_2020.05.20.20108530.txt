ABSTRACT
Background The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak urgently requires sensitive and convenient COVID-19
diagnostics for the containment and timely treatment of patients. We aimed to develop and
validate a novel reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay
to detect SARS-CoV-2 in qualified laboratories and point-of-care settings.
Methods Patients with suspected COVID-19 and close contacts were recruited from two
hospitals between Jan 26 and April 8, 2020. Respiratory samples were collected and tested using
the RT-LAMP assays, and the results were compared with those obtained by RT-qPCR. Samples
yielding inconsistent results between these two methods were subjected to next-generation
sequencing for confirmation. The RT-LAMP assay was also tested on an asymptomatic COVID19 carrier and patients with other respiratory viral infections.
Results Samples were collected from a cohort of 129 cases (329 nasopharyngeal swabs) and an
independent cohort of 76 patients (152 nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum samples). The RTLAMP assay was validated to be accurate (overall sensitivity and specificity: 88.89% and
99.00%; positive and negative predictive values: 94.74% and 97.78%, respectively) and
diagnostically useful (positive and negative likelihood ratios: 88.89 and 0.11, respectively). RTLAMP showed an increased sensitivity (88.89% vs 81.48%) and high consistency (kappa 0.92)
compared with RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 screening while requiring only constant temperature
heating and visual inspection. The time required for RT-LAMP was less than 1 h from sample
preparation to result. In addition, RT-LAMP was feasible for use with asymptomatic patients and
did not cross-react with other respiratory pathogens.
Conclusion The developed RT-LAMP assay offers rapid, sensitive and straightforward detection
of SARS-CoV-2 infection and could aid the expansion of COVID-19 testing in the public
domain and hospitals.

INTRODUCTION
The skyrocketing COVID-19 outbreak has become a public health emergency of international
concern. A total of 4,618,821 confirmed cases and 311,847 deaths have been reported in 216
countries as of May 18, 2020, since early December of 2019, according to the WHO COVID-19
report.1 At present, there are still no effective drugs or vaccines reported for COVID-19, and
prompt diagnosis, close contact tracking and quarantine management are the hallmarks for the
containment of this new pandemic.
Early and accurate diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial to prevent virus transmission
and provide appropriate treatment for patients. Due to its nonspecific symptoms and radiological
features overlapping with those of the common cold and influenza, the confirmation of SARSCoV-2 infection entirely depends entirely on viral RNA detection. 2-3 RT-qPCR is the standard
and most widely used method for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in clinical laboratories. 4 Despite
its outstanding analytical performance, RT-qPCR-based approaches to detect COVID-19 still
suffers from many limitations, such as long turnaround times (2 to 4 h), poor availability (it is
currently restricted to public health laboratories), the need for expensive instrumentation, and a
high proportion of false negatives or equivocal values (up to 38%) 5-6 in upper respiratory
samples due to insufficient viral materials. These limitations make the RT-qPCR test far from
adequate to meet the current challenge of a tremendous undocumented infected population,
asymptomatic transmission 7 and convalescence with viral RNA conversion, 8 highlighting the
pressing need for a more rapid, simple and sensitive approach to quickly identify infected
patients in different settings.

Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is regarded as a promising point-of-care test
(POCT) due to its advantages of high sensitivity and specificity, rapid reaction and low
laboratory infrastructure requirements. 9 Reverse transcription LAMP (RT-LAMP) is a type of
LAMP method used to detect target RNA with the AMV reverse transcriptase. This approach
allows reverse transcription and DNA amplification to be rapidly accomplished at a 60-65 ℃
constant temperature in less than an hour and in one step, and detailed amplification mechanisms
have been previously reported. 10 RT-LAMP results can be detected by visual turbidity or
fluorescence in real time, which makes this method a practical near-patient assay. In recent
years, RT-LAMP has been widely used in specialized laboratory testing as well as field surveys
to identify various pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, 11 Zika virus, 12 MERSCoV, 13 and SARS-CoV. 14 Shirato et al. 13 reported the development of a useful RT-LAMP
assay for the diagnosis of MERS that was developed in this way, with a detection limit of 3.4
copies per reaction and no cross-reactivity with other respiratory viruses. In addition, Hong et al.
14

developed a real-time quantitative RT-LAMP assay for the early and rapid diagnosis of SARS-

CoV that demonstrated 100-fold greater sensitivity than conventional RT-qPCR assays.
To accelerate clinical diagnostic testing for COVID-19, we conducted a prospective cohort
study to develop and validate a novel RT-LAMP assay capable of detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA
for potential use in centralized facilities and point-of-care settings. Moreover, we compared RTqPCR and RT-LAMP using clinical samples and demonstrated that RT-LAMP produced a higher
sensitivity and cost effectiveness for SARS-CoV-2 detection. To the best of our knowledge, this
study is the first to comprehensively assess a rapid RT-LAMP test for both COVID-19 patients
and an asymptomatic carrier, the results of which demonstrated it to have improved diagnostic
value over current diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study was designed as a prospective observational cohort study with three sequential
phases. In the initial stage, we developed a visual and rapid RT-LAMP assay for SARS-CoV-2
detection and assessed its anti-cross interface ability, stability and detection limit. Subsequently,
we evaluated the RT-LAMP and standard RT-qPCR assays on 329 nasopharyngeal swabs from a
cohort of 129 suspected COVID-19 patients and on the serial upper respiratory samples from an
asymptomatic carrier, and the insistent samples between RT-LAMP and RT-qPCR were further
subjected to next-generation sequencing (NGS) for SARS-CoV-2 confirmation. Finally, we
analyzed an additional 20 patients with other viral infections, 20 healthy individuals, and an
independent cohort of 76 cases suspected of having COVID-19 to further validate the detective
captivity of RT-LAMP for SARS-CoV-2. The overall study strategy is shown in Figure 1.

Subjects and sample enrollment
Cohort I Inpatients with clinical-radiological suspicion of COVID-19 presenting to Guangdong
Provincial People’s Hospital between January 26 to April 8, 2020 were eligible for inclusion.
Close contacts with exposure to confirmed COVID-19 cases were simultaneously enrolled in the
present study. Every participant underwent a standard SARS-CoV-2 set of investigations to test
COVID-19. The patients’ demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiological findings were
collected from their medical records. Serial nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from patients
during hospitalization and close contact screening. The sample sizes for swabs were defined by
their availability. At least one nasopharyngeal swab from suspected COVID-19 patients was
simultaneously sent to the CDC for double-checking as required, where RT-qPCR was
standardly utilized for SARS-CoV-2.

The diagnosis of COVID-19 patient was based on acute respiratory infection syndromes
and/or the presence of chest imaging features consistent with viral pneumonia accompanied by
conformation of positive RT-qPCR test results for SARS-CoV-2 by the CDC, according to the
criteria published in the updated COVID-19 Diagnostic Criteria, 7th Edition, China. Suspected
COVID-19 patients from Guangdong Provincial People’s Hospital were defined as Cohort I in
this study and classified into two groups: COVID-19 and non-COVID-19. COVID-19 patients
were further classified as nonsevere cases and severe cases; nonsevere cases included mild and
moderate patients with mild pneumonia, and severe cases indicated severe and critically severe
patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or oxygen saturation at rest <93% who
required mechanical ventilation or ICU monitoring. 2
Cohort II We enrolled an independent cohort of suspected COVID-19 patients from Guangdong
Second Provincial General Hospital for validation. SARS-CoV-2 testing and the diagnosis
procedure for COVID-19 were identical in the two hospitals. A nasopharyngeal swab and 5 mL
of morning sputum were collected from suspected COVID-19 patients to validate the diagnostic
performance of RT-LAMP for SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, nasopharyngeal swab samples obtained from 20 healthy subjects and 20 patients
with other respiratory viral infections were used to test the specificity of RT-LAMP for SARSCoV-2 detection.

RNA extraction
Swabs were preserved in 500 μL of virus preservation solution (TianLong, China), which
inactivates viruses and preserves all RNA in the specimen. The sputum samples were
preprocessed by a standard NALC-NaOH digestion. Total RNA was extracted from specimens
within 2 h of collection using a magnetic bead-based viral RNA isolation kit with a DA3200

system instrument (Daan Gene, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The extracts
were stored at -70°C until use. RNA extracted from each specimen was tested for SARS-CoV-2
in parallel by RT-qPCR and RT-LAMP in a double-blind manner in a biosafety level 2
laboratory. The samples yielding inconsistent results between these two methods were further
analyzed by NGS for verification.

RT-qPCR amplification
RT-qPCR was performed using an officially approved clinical RT-qPCR kit for the ABI
COVID-19 QuantStudio DxTM real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, USA) following the
manufacturer’s protocol (Daan Gene). Primer and probe sets targeting the ORF1ab and N genes
of SARS-CoV-2 are provided in Table S1. For RT-qPCR, each 25-μL reaction comprised 17 μL
of reaction buffer, 3 μL of enzyme solution, and 5 μL of template RNA. The cycling program
started at 50°C for 15 min for reverse transcription, followed by 95°C for 15 min for PCR initial
activation and 45 cycles of 94°C for 15 s and 55℃ for 45 s. A cycle threshold value less than 40
was defined as a positive test. Patient were defined as having a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19
when both targets (ORF1a/b and N genes) yielded positive results, and repeated tests using
another approved RT-qPCR kit were necessary for single-target-positive (ORF1a/b or N
positive) samples.

RT-LAMP assay
RT-LAMP Primer Design and Testing The complete genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2
(GenBank accession number MN908947.3) was aligned and compared the GenBank nucleotide
database gene sequences of all species, including other coronaviruses, to identify conserved
sequences. A conserved sequence of the S gene (nucleotide 22269-22494, No. MN908947.3) was

selected as the target to design our RT-LAMP primers because it is highly homologous among
various COVID-19 sequences and highly divergent from those of other coronaviruses examined.
We designed 4 sets of RT-LAMP primers targeting the SARS-CoV-2 S gene sequence (No.
MN908947.3) using the online PrimerExplorer V5 software (available at:
https://primerexplorer.jp/e/). One set of RT-LAMP primers with the best parameters was chosen,
including two outer primers, F3 and B3; two inner primers, forward inner primer (FIP) and
backward inner primer (BIP); and two loop forward (LF) and backward (LB) primers (Figure
S1), all of which synthesized by Invitrogen (Shanghai, China). Primer specificity was verified
with a BLAST search of the GenBank nucleotide database via comparisons with other
coronaviruses and published SARS-CoV-2 sequences, and the percent mismatch results are
presented in Table S2.
RT-LAMP Assay For RT-LAMP, each 25-μL reaction comprised 1 μL of 10× primer mix [16 μM
(each) FIP and BIP, 2 μM (each) F3 and B3 primers, 4 μM (each) LF and LB primers]; 2.5 μL of
10× Isothermal Amplification Buffer Pack (New England Biolabs); 4 μL of 10 mM dNTPs; 4 μL
of 5 M betaine; 3 μL of MgSO4; 2 μL of Bst DNA polymerase (8 U/μL); 1 μL of AMV reverse
transcriptase (5 U/μL); 1 μL of 3 mM fluorescent detection reagent (HNB); 5 μL of RNA
template and 2.5 μL of 1‰ DEPC H2O. The reaction mixtures were incubated in a PCR
thermocycler or dry bath at 65°C for 35 min. The optimal incubation condition of 65°C for 35
min was determined based on the banding pattern observed after gel electrophoresis and an
absorption spectrum analysis of the RT-LAMP reactions (Figure S2). Nontemplate controls
(NTCs) were included in each run to ensure the absence of contamination. Positive reactions
could be observed by visual color change from purple to blue, fluorescent light in response to
UV excitation, or by the laddering pattern of bands after gel electrophoresis.

Cross-reactivity evaluation of the RT-LAMP assay
Synthesized plasmids of 12 common viral pathogens, SARS, MERS, influenza A H1N1/H3N2,
influenza B, human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV-1/2/3), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV-A/B),
Epstein-Barr virus, human cytomegalovirus, human mastadenovirus (HAdV-B/E), enterovirus
(EB-U/71), human rhinovirus (HRV-2/14/16) and coxsackievirus (CA16), were used to test
potential cross- reactivity in the developed RT-LAMP assay. The RT-LAMP products obtained
using these plasmid templates were assayed by 3% agarose gel electrophoresis.

Detection limit of the RT-LAMP assay
To determine the lower detection limit of the RT-LAMP assay, samples from a 10-fold gradient
dilution series of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 S gene cDNA (1.5×102 - 1.5×10-9 ng/reaction) were
used as template in RT-LAMP reactions, and the minimum concentration of the positive reaction
was recorded. This dilution series was assayed in parallel by RT-qPCR using primers that
targeted the same region of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. The detection limit of the RT-LAMP
assay was determined by comparing the lowest concentration of the positive reaction with that
obtained by RT-qPCR.

Multiplex PCR-based next-generation sequencing (NGS)
The samples yielding inconsistent results inconsistent between the RT-LAMP and RT-qPCR
assays and those from COVID-19 patients that tested negative by RT-qPCR were further
analyzed by multiplex PCR-based enrichment and NGS to detect the SARS-CoV-2 genome.
Briefly, total RNA was reverse transcribed to synthesize first-strand cDNA with random
hexamers and a Superscript III reverse transcriptase kit (Vazyme, China). Two-step SARS-CoV-

2 genome amplification was performed with two pooled mixtures of primer sets (designed by
Genskey Medical Technology Co., Ltd.) that were designed to cover the entire SARS-CoV-2
genome. cDNA was mixed with the components of the first PCR following the manufacturer’s
instructions. The 2nd PCR was performed using the index primers, and the constructed libraries
were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq PE 150 platform. Data analysis was primarily
performed based on an in-house pipeline produced by Genskey Medical Technology. Raw
sequences were quality trimmed and subsequently filtered if shorter than 130 bases using fastp
v0.19.5. Sequence reads were first filtered against the human reference genome and then aligned
to a reference genome of SARS-CoV-2 (NC_045512.2) using Bowtie v2.2.4. The mapped reads
were assembled with SPAdes v3.14.0 with kmers ranging from 19 to 109 to obtain the
coronavirus genome sequences.

Statistical analysis
The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, likelihood ratios and their
respective 95% confidence intervals for the RT-LAMP and RT-qPCR assays of nasopharyngeal
specimens were calculated, and agreement analysis was computed using kappa concordance
coefficients (a value ≥ 0.75 was deemed good) and percentage agreement (≥ 0.9 was considered
good). 15 Statistical analyses were performed in the R programming environment.

Ethics statement
Written informed consent was obtained from all participants before the study, and the study was
approved by the ethics committee of each participating institution. The analysis was conducted
on samples collected during standard COVID-19 tests, with no extra burden on patients.

RESULTS
Development of an RT-LAMP assay
As described in the Materials and Methods, in this study we developed a rapid and simple RTLAMP assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA, where positive reactions resulted in a color change
from purple to blue due to decreased magnesium concentration in the presence of extensive Bst
DNA polymerase activity, while negative reactions retained the purple color. Figure S3 shows
the overall procedure of the RT-LAMP assay. RT-LAMP primers for COVID-19 were specific
and had a 9.14-37.56% nucleotide mismatch with SARS, MERS and other coronavirus
sequences (Table S2). Furthermore, the a cross-reactivity experiment results demonstrated that
the RT-LAMP assay did not cross-react with other human-pathogenic coronaviruses and
common viral pathogens, supporting the specificity of this assay for COVID-19 (Figure S4).
Dilution experiments with the synthetic SARS-CoV-2 S gene were performed to determine limit
of detection (LOD) of RT-LAMP relative to that of the RT-qPCR assay for the detection of
SARS-CoV-2 (Figure S5). The observed LOD values for the RT-LAMP and RT-qPCR assays
were approximately 1.5×10-8 ng per 25-μL reaction solution (i.e., 4.23 copies/reaction) and
1.5×10-7 ng/reaction (i.e., 42.3 copies/reaction), respectively. The RT-LAMP assay exhibited a
10-fold higher sensitivity than that of the RT-qPCR assay currently being used in clinical
settings, a result that is similar to that of previous LAMP-based assays. 16-17

Characteristics of the subjects
We ultimately collected a prospective cohort of 129 patients from Guangdong Provincial
People's Hospital [Cohort I: 24 COVID-19 patients (37 nasopharyngeal swab samples) and 105
COVID-19 exclusion cases (292 nasopharyngeal swabs)] and an independent cohort of 76

patients from Guangdong Second Provincial General Hospital (Cohort II: 28 COVID-19 with 56
nasopharyngeal swabs and 48 non-COVID-19 patients with 96 nasopharyngeal swabs) .
The laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients had a median age of 46.5 years (IQR, 31-60
years), 69.23% (36/52) were male, and the majority of the patients reported an exposure history
presenting primarily with fever, cough/expectoration, and muscle pain/fatigue (Table 1). Most of
the COVID-19 patients (94.23%) were identified as nonsevere cases, and only 3 patients were
nonsevere cases on admission. Forty of all 52 COVID-19 patients (76.92%) manifested with
chest CT imaging abnormalities, with the most common chest CT patterns being ground-glass
opacities (53.85%) and bilateral patchy shadowing (38.46%). The remaining 12 (23.07%) cases
showed normal CT images. Twenty-one (40.38%) patients had comorbidities, of whom 15.38%
had hypertension and 7.69% had diabetes. Forty (76.92%) patients presented with hematologic
abnormalities. The demographic and initial clinical characteristics of the COVID-19 patients in
the two respective cohorts are provided in Table 1.

Diagnostic potential of the RT-LAMP assay for COVID-19 patients and an asymptomatic
carrier
We first evaluated the clinical application of the RT-LAMP assay on 329 nasopharyngeal
specimens from Cohort I. Of these 329 nasopharyngeal swabs, 35 swabs were confirmed as
SARS-CoV-2 positive according to the combined criteria of testing positive by results (28
samples) and NGS confirmation (7 samples) (see Tables 2 and S3 and Figure S6). Thirty-one out
of 35 clinically positive samples were determined to be positive using the RT-LAMP assay, and
3 of 294 clinically negative samples were observed to show a positive reaction, which were
confirmed to be false-positive reaction by NGS. The performance of the RT-LAMP assay was as
follows: sensitivity 88.57% (95% CI 74.05–95.46); specificity 98.98% (97.04–99.65); positive-

predictive value 91.18% (77.04-96.95); negative-predictive value 98.64% (96.57-99.47); positive
likelihood ratio 86.8 (44.8-168.2); and negative likelihood ratio 0.12 (0.07-0.19) (Table 2).
Compared with the RT-qPCR assay, the RT-LAMP assay had a significantly better sensitivity
(88.57% vs 80.00%) and comparable specificity (98.98% vs 100%) for the diagnosis of SARSCoV-2 infection (Table 2). The detection results obtained using the RT-LAMP assay were in
good concordance with those obtained using the RT-qPCR assay, with a Cohen’s kappa of 0.89
(0.79-1.00), 100% positive predictive agreement and 98.01% negative predictive agreement.
These observations are in line with data reported by in studies by Baek et al. 16-18
In addition to exploring the diagnostic potential of RT-LAMP on active COVID-19 patients, we
also tested the RT-LAMP assay on an asymptomatic COVID-19 carrier. A 22-year-old female
presented to our hospital on January 13 2020, with a 16-year history of congenital heart disease
and a one-month aggravation of shortness of breath symptoms. After admission, she tested
positive by RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 infection in our hospital without any COVID-19/viral
pneumonia clinical symptoms or CT findings. Her oropharyngeal swabs were also sent to the
Guangzhou CDC for RT-qPCR double-checking and was confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 infection
positive on February 12 and February 15. Respiratory samples were collected throughout her
illness from February 11 to March 11 and subjected to parallel RT-LAMP and RT-qPCR assays
for SARS-CoV-2 detection (see Figure 2). NGS was simultaneously performed for samples
yielding inconsistent results between the RT-LAMP and RT-qPCR assays. The number of
positive test results obtained by RT-LAMP was 1.37-fold higher than that observed by RT-PCR
(11 vs 8), and 4 RT-LAMP-positive but RT-qPCR-negative samples were verified as SARSCOV-2 positive using NGS (Figure 2 and Table S3). During her hospitalization, the RT-qPCR Ct
values fluctuated and became negative after February 26, suggesting that a continuous viral
shedding pattern and a decreased viral load over time (data not shown, available upon request).

This case demonstrated that compared to RT-qPCR, RT-LAMP has a higher sensitivity in
detecting SARS-COV-2, particularly for those samples with a low viral load, and also suggested
that RT-LAMP can be used for the diagnosis of asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers.

Validation of RT-LAMP assay
We next validated the RT-LAMP assay on an independent cohort (Cohort II) of 28 COVID-19
patients and 48 COVID-19 exclusion cases. One nasopharyngeal swab and one sputum specimen
was collected from every participant in Cohort II. The 152 samples comprised of 46 positive
samples (28 swabs and 18 sputum) and 106 negative samples (Tables 2 and S3). Nasopharyngeal
swabs from COVID-19 patients showed a higher positive rate than sputum specimens in both the
RT-qPCR and RT-LAMP assays [RT-qPCR: swab 71.43% (20/28), sputum 64.29% (18/28); RTLAMP: swab 78.57% (22/28), sputum 71.43% (20/28)]. The RT-LAMP assay had a sensitivity
of 89.13%, whereas that of the RT-qPCR assay was only 82.61%. The specificity of the RTLAMP assay was roughly equivalent to that of the RT-qPCR assay (99.06% vs 100.00%, Table
2), and the agreement between the two assays was excellent (kappa 0.93 (0.77-1.00), Table 2).
These observations corroborate the results obtained from Cohort I as well as previous RT-LAMP
findings, 16-18 suggesting that the use of RT-LAMP may improve the sensitivity of pathogenic
diagnosis for COVID-19.
To further assess whether the RT-LAMP assay was COVID-19 specific, 40 swab specimens
from 20 patients with influenza (n = 9) or respiratory viral infections (n = 11, representing
Mycoplasma pneumoniae, HPIV-1/2/3, RSV-A/B, RSV, and HAdV-B/E) and 20 healthy
individuals were assessed using the RT-LAMP assay. No positive results were observed,
demonstrating that RT-LAMP-based detection approach can distinguish SARS-CoV-2 with no
cross-reactivity for other respiratory viruses, similar to reports in recent studies. 16-18

The RT-LAMP assay results reported in this study for SARS-CoV-2 detection in the two
cohorts are summarized as follows. The RT-LAMP assay exhibited an overall sensitivity of
88.89% (higher than the 81.48% for RT-qPCR), an overall specificity of 99.00%, high
consistency (kappa 0.92) with the RT-qPCR assay, and a median turnaround time less than 1 h
from sample preparation to result in the detection of 481 clinical specimens from two cohorts
(Figure 3). Additional advantages of RT-LAMP include cost effectiveness, simple operation and
visual determination capability, which facilitate SARS-CoV-2 screening in well-equipped labs as
well as in the field (Figure 3).

DISCUSSION
Rapid and reliable diagnosis is of particular importance for the containment of COVID-19
outbreaks. In this study, we described a simple and sensitive RT-LAMP approach to rapidly
diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection. The robustness of the present study was demonstrated, as this
RT-LAMP assay was useful in the diagnosis of active COVID-19 patients and asymptomatic
carriers and was generally not confounded by other respiratory pathogen infections using clinical
samples from two hospitals.
Existing methods to detect SARS-CoV-2 are primarily based on RT-qPCR, NGS and IgM and
IgG immunological tests. Comparing the results between the RT-LAMP and RT-qPCR assays,
RT-LAMP provided a better sensitivity (88.89% vs 81.48%) than RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2.
This added sensitivity is important in consideration of a significant number of COVID-19
patients that have presented with negative qPCR 7 results or the “relapse after negative”
phenomenon 8 due to potentially large variability between clinical samples, low-virus-titer
samples and even disrupted binding of RT-qPCR primers due to variation in the viral genome. 19
In this study, we used Bst DNA polymerase that was isolated in-house for the developed RT-

LAMP assay, which was demonstrated to have a higher polymerization activity than the
commercial Bst DNA polymerase 20 and ensured the high sensitivity of this RT-LAMP method.
Based on these findings, we propose that the RT-LAMP assay was able to detect viral RNA not
only in samples testing positive by RT-qPCR but also in inconclusive samples.
We observed that the RT-LAMP assay was less sensitive and informative than NGS in our
study and other literature. 21-24 NGS is a robust tool for obtaining extensive genetic information
and completing whole-genome sequence, allowing for LOD values as low as 10 copies/mL for
SARS-CoV-2 detection and is a reference test for COVID-19, especially for those challenging
samples with low viral content. 2, 23-24 However, compared to the complex and costly NGS
platform, RT-LAMP assays have the advantage of low-threshold of infrastructure, less data
processing requirement and cost effectiveness, enabling this user-friendly assay to be
immediately deployed in hospitals and communities. The RT-LAMP assay also showed no
cross-reactivity with other viruses that manifest similar respiratory diseases such that the
specificity of this assay was higher than that reported for IgM- and IgG-based detection methods.
25

In addition, we described the accuracy of the RT-LAMP assay in detecting SARS-CoV-2 by

determining likelihood ratios. Likelihood ratios are not affected by disease prevalence, and
values higher than ten and lower than one strongly support the diagnostic value of a test. 26 Based
on this metric, the near-patient RT-LAMP assay used in this study is diagnostically useful for
COVID-19. Overall, the RT-LAMP assay established in this study could be a powerful
complementary method for monitoring massive numbers of exposed individuals as well as aiding
with screening efforts in hospitals and public domains, especially in areas with limited laboratory
capacities.
In addition, nasopharyngeal swabs from COVID-19 patients had a higher positive rate than
sputum specimens in both the RT-qPCR and RT-LAMP assays. Liu et al. 27 reported that the

detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs was lower than that observed in
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and sputum. This inconsistency is most likely due to poor sputum
quality and fluctuations in viral RNA levels during different stages of the disease course. 28
Despite this inconsistency, nasopharyngeal swabs are noninvasive and easy to acquire, and
evidence has shown that SARS-CoV-2 replicates actively in upper respiratory tissue. 29
Therefore, we argue that nasopharyngeal swabs are suitable for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 at
an early stage of infection.
We note that four samples from non-COVID-19 cases tested positive in the RT-LAMP assay
but negative by RT-qPCR (see Table 1), as reported previously. 18 The four false positive results
by RT-LAMP were caused by aerosol contaminants, as we retested these samples in another
clean room and obtained the expected negative RT-LAMP. Contaminant issues are not rare for
nucleic acid testing, even when the best available reference laboratory tests are used. Precautions
to prevent cross-contamination or aerosol contaminants during assays are highly recommended,
including the use of a spray solution for the elimination of potential RNA fragments and
changing gloves frequently. The RNA extraction-free RT-LAMP assay could address this
important issue. 18 Since this study was completed, the SARS-CoV-2 RT-LAMP test has been
optimized further, with the use of lyophilized reagents and the direct detection of SARS-CoV-2
without the need to conduct RNA extraction. This one-step single-tube RT-LAMP assay
decreases reaction time and minimizes false positive reactions, making it an ideal POCT for
COVID-19 if validated in future studies.
One limitation of our study was the relatively small sample size of positive COVID-19 cases,
which has resulted in widened confidence intervals for our estimates of diagnostic accuracy. We
tested the samples using RT-LAMP in a blind manner, and the designation of the actual status of
SARS-CoV-2 infection in clinical samples was based on a set of combined criteria of RT-qPCR

and subsequent NGS confirmation to obviate potential false negative or positive results. We
further validated the diagnostic potential of RT-LAMP in another independent cohort with
nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum samples. Therefore, despite our small sample size, our study
provided sufficient robustness for the RT-LAMP assay.

In summary, in this study, we developed a simple and rapid RT-LAMP assay for SARS-CoV-2
detection and demonstrated its high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity among clinical samples.
Our findings suggest that RT-LAMP can be an appropriate auxiliary assay for the diagnosis and
epidemiologic surveillance of COVID-19 in different hospital and community settings.

In Cohort I, 35 out of 37 nasopharyngeal swabs from 24 COVID-19 patients were confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 positive according to
the criteria of RT-qPCR (28 samples) and NGS confirmation (7 samples, Table S3). In Cohort II, 46 out of 56 samples (paired
nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum samples) from 28 COVID-19 patients were determined as SARS-CoV-2 positive accordingly (38
were RT-qPCR-positive and 8 were NGS-positive, Table S3).

FIGURES
Development of a rapid RT-LAMP assay to visually detect SARS-CoV-2 infection
in hospital and onsite testing

Double-blind RT-LAMP and RT-qPCR on prospective Cohort I: 24
COVID-19 patients (37 swabs) and 105 COVID-19 exclusion cases
(292 swabs)

Clinical
Evaluation

Serial detection for an asymptomatic carrier (RT-LAMP vs RT-qPCR)

Inconsistent samples between RT-LAMP and RT-qPCR assays were
further determined by next-generation sequencing

Statistical analysis: diagnostic performance (Sen, Spe, PPV, NPV, PLR, NLR);
concordance analysis (kappa and % agreement)

To test whether LAMP is COVID-19 specific (20 patients with influenza
and other viral infections)

Clinical
Validation

RT-LAMP testing on 20 healthy individuals

Cohort II: 28 COVID-19 patients (28 swabs and 28 sputum) vs 48
COVID-19 exclusion cases (48 swabs and 48 sputum)

RT-LAMP provides a sensitive and rapid approach to COVID-19 diagnostics
