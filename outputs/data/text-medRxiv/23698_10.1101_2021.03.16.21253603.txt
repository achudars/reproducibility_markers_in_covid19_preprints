The concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in faeces is not well established,
posing challenges for wastewater-based surveillance of COVID-19 and risk
assessments of environmental transmission. We develop versatile hierarchical models for faecal RNA shedding and apply them to data collected in six
studies. We find that the mean number of gene copies per mL of faeces is
1.9×106 (2.3×105 —2.0×108 95% credible interval) amongst hospitalised patients. We find no evidence for a subpopulation of patients who do not shed
RNA: limits of quantification can account for negative stool samples. Our
models indicate that hospitalised patients represent the tail of the shedding
profile with a half-life of 34 hours (28—43 95% credible interval), suggesting
that wastewater-based surveillance signals are more indicative of incidence
than prevalence and can be a leading indicator of clinical presentation. Shedding amongst inpatients cannot explain high RNA concentrations observed
in wastewater, consistent with more abundant shedding during the early infection course.

1. Introduction

62

The novel virus SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) infected
over 80 million people in 2020, and more than 2.6 million people have succumbed to the
resultant disease, COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) [1]. Individuals infected by the
virus primarily suffer from respiratory symptoms [2], but gastrointestinal manifestations
of the disease have also been observed [3]. The presence of viral RNA in faeces allows
for the surveillance of COVID-19 by quantifying gene copies in sewage [4]. So-called
wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) provides data that can complement traditional
testing schemes and can be used to monitor the disease relatively cheaply by pooling
wastewater from thousands of people [5]. Correlations between case numbers from individual testing schemes and RNA concentrations in wastewater have been observed [4,
6, 7]. However, associative studies cannot easily be used to calibrate WBE approaches:
each sewerage system is different [8], and case numbers may not be a good indicator of
prevalence [9]—especially when testing capacity is limited. The World Health Organisation considers “quantitative information on viral shedding” an imminent need to reap
the potential benefits of WBE [10].
Faecal shedding of RNA suggests that the virus could be transmissible via the faecaloral route [11]. While presence of RNA does not imply presence of infective virus, the
likelihood increases with higher RNA loads [12]. Sewer overflows could cause spillover
events, leading to new viral reservoirs [13]. For example, mink are susceptible to SARSCoV-2 [14] and can be exposed to untreated sewage [13]. Furthermore, wastewater
workers are at risk of contracting sewage-borne pathogens [15], and wastewater is a
possible infection mode in densely populated communities [16, 17]. Quantifying these
risks is essential for making informed policy decisions.
We developed a family of random-effect models [18, ch. 5] for SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in faecal samples and applied them to data from six clinical studies to study
three aspects of faecal RNA shedding. First, we studied the shedding profile, i.e. the
temporal variability of shedding over the infection course, which affects the interpretation of WBE results [6]. We find that the profile decays quickly with a half-life of 34
hours. Second, the proportion of patients with one or more positive faecal samples has
been extensively studied [3, 19, 20]. We determined that the limit of quantification of
assays can account for patients without positive samples. Bayesian model comparison
revealed no evidence for a subpopulation of patients who do not shed RNA faecally.
Third, we obtained estimates of the mean faecal RNA concentration: a quantity important for inferring disease prevalence or incidence from wastewater data [21]. We show
that the models are able to predict summary statistics of held-out studies accurately
and consider the implications of our results for wastewater-based epidemiology.

To study faecal RNA shedding quantitatively, we developed a suite of hierarchical models

Figure 1: A flexible hierarchical model can capture a wide range of aspects of real-world

shedding behaviour between patients, giving rise to location parameters µi
for each patient i (see section 4.1 for details). The location parameters (blue
squares) describe the amplitude of individual shedding profiles as illustrated
for three patients. The patient-level distribution (shown in orange for one patient) describes the variation between samples from the same patient, and the
shedding profile (solid black line) modulates typical RNA concentrations in
faecal samples over time. All samples are analysed using an RT-qPCR assay
with a given limit of quantification (LOQ) θ (dashed black line), and concentrations above the LOQ (orange circles) can be quantified. Concentrations
below the LOQ (orange cross) cannot be quantified. Currently available data
do not allow us to constrain the early shedding profile, and late-stage shedding
is consistent with an exponential decay profile.

microdata

Table 1: Six studies providing quantitative data on faecal RNA loads were analysed. Microdata, i.e. sample-level RNA concentrations, provided by the first four studies
were used to fit random effects models. The next two studies did not provide microdata, and we validated our models by comparing reported summary
statistics with model-based predictions, as discussed in section 4.4. Samples
with viral loads below the limit of quantification (LOQ) are considered negative for SARS-CoV-2. The table also reports the total number of patients n
and number of samples m, including a breakdown by positivity.

existing quantitative approaches [22, 23], our models can account for a variable number of
samples per patient, incorporate data from studies with different levels of quantification,
and capture variability between patients as well as variability between samples from the
same patient. The baseline model assumes that all infected patients shed viral RNA
faecally and that typical RNA concentrations in samples vary over the course of the
infection. We considered three different shedding profiles: an exponential decay profile,
a gamma profile, and the exponential rise-and-decay profile proposed by Teunis et al.
[24] for norovirus RNA shedding (see section 4.1.1 for details). We call this the temporal
standard model, and it is illustrated in fig. 1.
We considered two modifications to the baseline model. First, we considered a constant
model, where the time-variability of shedding was removed. Second, to assess whether
there exists a subpopulation of patients who never shed viral RNA faecally, we introduced
a shedding prevalence parameter ρ such that all samples of an infected patient are
negative with probability 1 − ρ. We call this the subpopulation model (as opposed
to the standard model in which all patients shed RNA faecally). Combining the two
modifications (with and without a subpopulation of non-shedders, and with and without
time-variability) gives rise to four models in total.
We fitted each model to longitudinal data extracted from three studies [26, 25, 12]
listed in table 1. All studies used RT-qPCR assays to quantify SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies
in faecal samples collected from hospitalised patients. The two constant models were
also fitted to an additional dataset collected by Wang et al. [11] that does not provide
temporal information. As shown in table 2, we compared the models using the Bayesian
model evidence [29] (i.e. the marginal likelihood of the data under each model), allowing
us to draw two conclusions.

Table 2: Accounting for temporal variability of the shedding profile is essential, and there
is no evidence for a subpopulation of patients who do not shed RNA faecally.
Model evidences evaluated on three common datasets prefer temporal models
(evidence shown for an exponential decay profile) over constant ones, and standard models are preferred over models with a subpopulation of patients who
do not shed SARS-CoV-2 RNA faecally. Parameter estimates are consistent
with conclusions based on model evidences. They are reported as the posterior
mode together with the 95% credible interval in brackets. All reported credible
intervals are highest posterior density intervals. Estimates for constant models
include a fourth dataset without temporal information.

First, accounting for the time dependence of the shedding profile is essential. The
three shedding profiles we considered are indistinguishable where data are available to
constrain them (see section 4.1.1 for details). However, there are only few samples
obtained prior to day six past symptom onset, as shown in fig. 2 (a), and shedding
behaviour during the early infection course cannot be constrained given the available
data. For simplicity, we use the exponential decay profile unless otherwise specified.
Typical faecal RNA concentrations decay with a maximum a posteriori half-life of 34
hours (28—43 hours 95% credible interval) amongst hospitalised patients, as shown in
fig. 2 (b) and (c).
Patients may not recall the number of days since symptom onset accurately, or they
may present with atypical symptoms that are not easily identified as the onset of COVID19 [30]. To assess the sensitivity of the inferred half-life to inaccurate reports, we repeated
the inference after adding up to three days of reporting noise to the number of days
since symptom onset. No sensitivity of the half-life inference to inaccurate reports was
observed.
The second result is that there is no evidence for a subpopulation of patients who do
not shed viral RNA faecally; standard models (without a non-shedding subpopulation)
are preferred for both the constant (log odds of 3.1 ± 0.3) and temporal models (log
odds of 1.8 ± 0.3). Consistent with the model comparison results, the inferred shedding
prevalence is large and the 95% credible interval includes ρ = 1 for both subpopulation
models. Consequently, as discussed in more depth in section 4.4, the level of quantification of the assays used in the three studies can explain the number of negative patients
and samples because “the level of viral RNA present in stool can fluctuate around the
margin of laboratory detection” [28].
To assess the out-of-sample predictive utility of the models, we considered predictions

for two held-out datasets that do not provide microdata, as listed in table 1. The studies
conducted by Kim et al. [27] and Ng et al. [28] provided sufficiently detailed descriptions
of their protocols to simulate the studies and make predictions by sampling from the
posterior predictive distribution (see section 4.4 for details). Since our models have not
been fit to these data, their ability to predict summary statistics of those data is an
indication of how well the models generalise. Temporal models are preferred by the
data, but we do not have any temporal information about the studies conducted by
Kim et al. [27] and Ng et al. [28]. Nonetheless, the constant models can make accurate
out-of-sample predictions because all studies consider the same population: hospitalised
patients.
Kim et al. [27] collected 129 samples from 38 hospitalised patients, and they reported
the largest observed concentration max x = 2.7 × 107 gene copies per mL of faeces.
Ng et al. [28] collected 81 samples from 21 patients, and the largest observed RNA
concentration was max x = 1.3 × 107 copies per mL. As shown in fig. 3 (a) and (b),
predictions from our models are consistent with the reported values. Predictions of the
maximum are smaller for the study by Ng et al. [28] than Kim et al. [27], which is
expected owing to a smaller number of samples (so the tails of the distribution are less
well sampled). Ng et al. [28] also reported the median number of positive samples per
patient median m•(+) . Because they report the limit of detection of their assay, we can
make predictions about the median number of positive samples per patient which agree
with the reported value, as shown in panel (c) of fig. 3.

We have inferred properties of the faecal SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding distribution by
fitting a suite of Bayesian hierarchical models to clinical data from four studies. The
models account for the limits of quantification of RT-qPCR assays and a variable number
of samples per patient. They are able to capture salient properties of the data and
generalise well to two held-out datasets. There is no evidence of patients who do not
shed viral RNA faecally.
The inferred temporal shedding profile is robust to inaccurate reports of the number
of days since symptom onset, and it suggests that hospitalised patients are in the tail of
the shedding profile because faecal RNA concentrations decay by an order of magnitude
over the course of four to five days. While extrapolation should be treated with caution,
wastewater-based surveillance of COVID-19 lends additional credibility to the hypothesis
that SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in wastewater are higher than expected based
on faecal shedding inferred from hospitalised patients [31]. Assuming mean faecal RNA
concentrations Λ are not larger in mild cases in the community than amongst hospitalised
patients, a daily per capita wastewater volume of V = 300 L [32], and faecal mass of
m = 128 g per person per day [33], we would expect wastewater RNA concentrations on
the order of mΛ/V ∼ 103 mL−1 if every person was infected. In practice, concentrations
in excess of 103 mL−1 have been observed [4] at times when seroprevalence of SARS-CoV2 antibodies was less than ten percent [9]. Substantial shedding during the early stages of

the infection likely explains these observations. The rapid decay of the shedding profile
also implies that signals from wastewater-based surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 are likely
more indicative of incidence, rather than prevalence. Wastewater-based surveillance is
thus a promising approach for early detection of cases in the community. A better
understanding of the shape of the shedding profile, including prior to symptom onset,
is essential for interpreting signals from WBE correctly during critical phases of rapid
changes in levels of infection.
While one of the largest quantitative studies revealed no association between disease
severity and faecal RNA concentration [34], results obtained from hospitalised patients
are unlikely to apply to the general population, e.g. the former tend to be older and have
more comorbidities. Faecal samples should be collected from a representative sample of
patients over the entire infection course to refine quantitative estimates of faecal shedding
of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. These data should include faecal volumes to estimate the total
RNA load in faeces in addition to concentrations. The effect of vaccinations and emerging
variants on faecal RNA shedding should also be investigated to make wastewater-based
surveillance an effective quantitative monitoring tool.

We developed a suite of hierarchical models to characterise faecal shedding of SARSCoV-2 RNA quantitatively. Starting with the standard constant model described in
section 2, we discuss the generative model in three steps.
First, the mean faecal RNA concentration λi for each patient i ∈ {1, . . . , n} follows
a distribution with probability density function f , where n is the number of patients.
Log-normal, Weibull, and gamma distributions are common choices for distributions that
model positive, continuous data [35]. However, conclusions based on these distributions
can differ substantially due to their tail behaviour [36]. We thus employed a generalised
gamma distribution (GGD) with shape Q, location M , and scale S. The GGD is a
flexible distribution which encompasses the log-normal distribution (Q = 0), Weibull
distribution (Q = 1), and gamma distribution (Q = S) as special cases [37]. This
choice comes at the cost of wider credible intervals, commensurate with our lack of prior
knowledge about the shape of the shedding distribution.
Second, mi samples are collected from each patient i. The RNA concentration yij
in sample j from patient i follows a GGD with shape q, location µi , and scale σ. For
the constant model (without time-varying shedding), the location parameter µ for the
patient-level distribution is chosen such that hyij i = λi for each patient. Because of the
properties of the generalised gamma distribution, we can express the location parameter
in terms of the mean as

Third, the RNA concentration yij is quantified using an assay with level of quantification (LOQ) θij (see Kitajima et al. [38] for an overview of different assays). If the
concentration is below the LOQ, the sample is considered negative for the purpose of
this study, and we denote the output of the assay as xij = ◦. Otherwise, the result of
the assay faithfully captures the RNA concentration in the sample, i.e. xij = yij . We do
not explicitly model measurement error or variability between technical replicates in this
study because the relevant data are not available and assays tend to yield reproducible
results. For example, the CDC N1 assay [39] has a coefficient of variation < 3.7%—
much smaller than typical variability between samples from the same patient. The RNA
quantification is censored by the LOQ, and the likelihood of observing a particular assay
result xij is thus

RNA shedding varies over the course of the infection [40], and the constant model cannot
capture these changes. We incorporate temporal variability by introducing a shedding
profile such that the expected RNA concentration λi for each patient i varies over time.
In particular, we let λi (t) = λi (t = 0)g(t), where t is the number of days since symptom
onset, g(t) is the shedding profile that modulates the expected RNA concentration,
and λi (t = 0) is sampled from the population-level distribution. The shape and scale
parameters q and σ of the patient-level distribution are kept constant.
Because all available data were collected from hospitalised patients several days after
the initial onset of symptoms, we can only constrain the later part of the shedding
profile. We used an exponential profile gexp (t) = exp (−αt), where α is the decay rate
of the profile, because it provides an adequate fit for late-stage faecal shedding of other
viruses [24]. Substituting into eq. (1), the exponential shedding profile gives rise to a
location parameter that varies linearly with the number of days after symptom onset for
each patient i such that µi (t) = µi (t = 0) − αt.
Any reporting error associated with the number of days since symptom onset t can
be compensated for by a corresponding change in µi (t = 0). This explains why the
inferred shedding profile is robust to reporting inaccuracies, as discussed in section 2.
The profile shown in fig. 2 (b) is exp (M − αt), and it captures the decay of the effective
population-level location parameter M over time. The profile half life is τ1/2 = logα 2 .
We also considered two further shedding profiles to assess the sensitivity of our inferences to the choice of g(t). First, we used a gamma shedding profile
gγ (t) = (t − t0 )α exp (−β(t − t0 )) ,

229
230

where α > 0 and β > 0 control the shape of the profile and t0 is the time at which
shedding can first occur, i.e. g(t < t0 ) = 0. Second, we considered the exponential

To investigate whether there is a subpopulation of patients who do not shed SARS-CoV2 RNA faecally, we extended the model by introducing a binary indicator zi ∈ {0, 1} for
each patient i. If zi = 1, the shedding behaviour of the patient is unchanged. If zi = 0,
patient i does not shed RNA, and xij = ◦ for all samples j. The indicator variables follow
a Bernoulli distribution with probability ρ, i.e. the prevalence of shedding amongst the
population of patients. This extension gives rise to what we refer to as the subpopulation
models.
We know that zi = 1 for any patient with one or more positive samples, and the likelihood follows eq. (2). However, for any patient i whose mi samples xi• = {xi1 , . . . , ximi }
are all below the LOQ, the likelihood is
P (xi• |q, µi , σ, θi• ) = (1 − ρ) + ρ

We searched the literature for primary research that reported quantitative information
on SARS-CoV-2 RNA loads in faeces, and we identified eleven studies of interest [3, 11,
12, 26, 27, 28, 34, 41, 42, 43]. Semi-quantitative studies reporting only cycle-threshold
values were excluded.
Data from four studies were used to fit the hierarchical models described in section 4.1.
First, Wölfel et al. [12] reported longitudinal faecal RNA concentrations for nine patients
in Munich who had been in close contact with a common index case. Second, Lui et
al. [25] followed the first eleven patients hospitalised due to COVID-19 in Hong Kong.
Third, Han et al. [26] studied the viral dynamics of a neonate and her mother in Seoul.
Fourth, Wang et al. [11] reported cycle threshold (Ct ) values of RT-qPCR assays for
faecal samples from a subset of patients admitted to three hospitals in China, and we
transformed Ct values to RNA concentrations using conversion constants provided in
the publication. Longitudinal information was not available. Table 1 lists information
on the number of patients and samples for each study.
Two studies provided summary statistics of viral RNA concentrations in faecal samples, such as the highest concentration observed, together with sufficiently detailed descriptions of the study design to replicate the studies in silico, as described in section 4.4.
In particular, Kim et al. [27] quantified RNA concentrations in faecal samples collected

from hospitalised patients, and Ng et al. [28] studied RNA concentrations in faecal samples to assess transmission risks associated with faecal microbiota transplants. These
data are not used to fit the hierarchical models but instead to assess the out-of-sample
predictive utility of our fitted models.
Five studies were excluded from the analysis despite providing quantitative information. First, using an assay originally developed for samples from ferrets [44], Jeong et al.
[41] reported RNA concentrations of various specimen types, including faecal samples.
However, the reported concentrations are orders of magnitude lower than reported in
any of the other quantitative studies for any specimen type. Indeed, most measurements
are below the limit of quantification of other studies. Second, Zhang et al. [42] reported
detailed data in a figure, but it is not possible to extract the relevant information because
of the low resolution of the figure, and the data could not be obtained by other means.
Third, Zheng et al. [34] conducted a large study, comprising 85 patients and 842 faecal
samples. Unfortunately, viral loads are only reported as the median for each patient
(private communication). Finally, Pan et al. [43] and Cheung et al. [3] collected faecal
RNA concentration data from 17 and 59 confirmed cases, respectively, but neither study
provides information on the number of samples collected.

We used the nested sampler polychord [45] which draws samples from the posterior
distribution and evaluates the model evidence, i.e. the marginal likelihood of the data
under the model, as listed in table 2. The study by Wang et al. [11] was not used to
estimate parameters for temporal models because longitudinal data were not available.
Similarly, to facilitate a direct comparison between models, that study was also omitted
from the evaluation of evidences. We used unit-scale half-Cauchy distributions for the
shape parameters Q and q as well as the scale parameters S and σ. A flat prior on the
interval 6—23 was used for the population location M which is sufficiently wide to avoid
boundary effects. A flat prior on the unit interval was used for the shedding prevalence
ρ. For models with temporal variability, a unit-scale Cauchy prior was used for the
profile parameters α and β. We used uniform prior on the interval -14—7 for t0 such
that the onset of shedding can differ from the onset of symptoms. All inferences were
run in triplicate, and no sensitivity to different pseudo-random number generator seeds
was observed (Gelman-Rubin diagnostic R̂ < 1.05 for all models [46]).
In addition to the results discussed in section 2, we consider four technical implications
of the inference here.
First, the gamma and Teunis shedding profiles are both consistent with the exponential
shedding profile for late-stage shedding where data are available to constrain them.
However, the available data cannot constrain early shedding behaviour, as illustrated by
the wide range of shedding profiles consistent with the data shown in fig. 4. Miura et al.
[22] reported tight posteriors for early shedding behaviour using the shedding profile
proposed by Teunis et al. [24], but their inferences rely on the assumption that the time
of symptom onset and shedding onset coincide (i.e. t0 = 0), an assumption that is not
yet supported by evidence.

Second, the shape Q controls the tails of the population-level distribution: the larger
Q, the lighter the tails (see Prentice [37] for details). The population-level mean RNA
concentration, i.e. the expected RNA concentration in a random faecal sample from
a previously unobserved patient, depends on the tail behaviour because the mean is
sensitive to outliers [36]. As shown in fig. 5 (a), the inferred mean under the constant
standard model is larger for smaller Q because of the heavier tails. The corresponding credible intervals are also wider because constraining the mean requires more data
for heavier-tailed distributions. Employing log-normal, Weibull, or gamma distributions
would have entailed a poorly-motivated implicit choice about the shape of the distribution. Using generalised gamma distributions instead allows us to explicitly account for
our prior uncertainty about the shape of the tails.
Third, the 95% credible region for the population-level shape Q and scale S is consistent with the log-normal distribution (Q = 0) or Weibull distribution (Q = 1) for both
the constant and temporal models, as shown in fig. 5 (b). However, the special case of
the gamma distribution (Q = S) can be confidently excluded because its tails are too
light. The same conclusions apply to the patient-level distribution.
Fourth, the joint posterior distribution for the population-level shape and scale parameters are similar under both the constant and temporal models (exponential shedding
profile) without a subpopulation of non-shedders, as shown in fig. 5 (b): modelling the
temporal shedding profile does not have a significant effect on the inferred variability in
shedding behaviour between patients. However, as shown in fig. 5 (c), the patient-level
scale σ is significantly larger for the constant than the temporal model. The constant
model can only account for large (time-integrated) sample-to-sample variability with
a broad distribution. In contrast, the temporal model can explain variability between
samples from the same patient using the shedding profile and a narrower distribution
that accounts for residual idiosyncratic noise.

We assess the goodness-of-fit of the model to the data using posterior predictive replication of various summary statistics, and validate the ability of the fitted model to predict
summary statistics of held-out datasets using posterior predictive validation.
Posterior predictive replication is a useful tool for assessing the fit of a model to
data [18, ch. 6]. In short, synthetic replicates of the data generated by sampling from
the posterior predictive distribution should not be easily distinguishable from the data
the model was fit to. For example, 104 of 148 samples were positive in the composite
dataset used to fit the constant standard model. If posterior predictive replicates of
the data have a similar number of positive samples, the model is able to describe this
particular aspect of the data. In contrast, the model would evidently not be suitable if it
confidently predicted that all samples should be positive. We assess the goodness-of-fit
to the data via posterior predictive replication of two key summary statistics.
The first summary statistics we consider are the number of positive samples m(+) and
positive patients n(+) (i.e. patients with at least one positive sample) because these
statistics have been extensively discussed in meta-analyses [3, 19, 20]. As shown in

Figure 5: The mean number of RNA copies per mL of faeces is sensitive to the shape
of the shedding distribution. Panel (a) shows the conditional distribution of
the mean number of RNA copies per mL of faeces given the population shape
parameter Q for the constant standard model. The mean tends to be larger for
smaller Q due to heavier tails. Panels (b) and (c) show the joint distributions
of the shape and scale parameters for the population-level distribution and
patient-level distribution, respectively. Parametrisations corresponding to the
Weibull distribution (Q = q = 1) and gamma distribution (Q = S and q = σ)
are shown as black dot-dashed and dotted lines, respectively. The patient-level
scale parameter σ is larger for the constant than the temporal model (both
without a non-shedding subpopulation) because the patient-level distribution
needs to account for both temporal variability and idiosyncratic sample-tosample variability.

fig. 6 (a) to (d), replicates from all models are consistent with the observed number of
positive patients n(+) and number of positive samples m(+) , corroborating our result that
the limit of quantification of assays is sufficient to account for negative samples. Replicates from the two subpopulation models exhibit larger variability because assay results
xi• for samples from the same patient i are correlated due to their mutual dependence
on the shedding indicator zi .
Second, we evaluate the sample mean (i.e. the mean of all positive samples) across
posterior predictive replicates and compare it with the sample mean of the data. The
models can indeed replicate the statistic well, and the observed sample mean is consistent
with the predicted sample means, as shown in fig. 6 (e).
Posterior predictive replication can only assess the models’ ability to explain the data
they were fit to. In other words, a model that satisfies such posterior predictive checks
may nevertheless fail to generalise to other datasets. To assess the out-of-sample predictive utility of the models, we consider predictions for two held-out datasets.
Kim et al. [27] collected 129 samples from 38 hospitalised patients, and we assumed
that at least one sample was collected from each patient. The remaining 91 samples
were assumed to be collected from patients with equal probability. This information
is sufficient to generate model-based predictions in two steps by sampling from the
posterior predictive distribution. First, we sampled the patient-level means λ from the
population-level distribution. Second, we sampled the assay results according to eqs. (2)
and (3) for the standard and subpopulation models, respectively. While Kim et al. [27]
also report the number of positive and negative samples, as shown in table 1, we could
not replicate these summary statistics because they do not provide the limit of detection
of their assay. Ng et al. [28] collected 81 samples from 21 patients, and we used the same
allocation of samples to patients to generate predictions as for the study by Kim et al.
[27].
