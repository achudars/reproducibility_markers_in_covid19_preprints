Abstract

27

Emerging evidence has confirmed meteorological factors and air pollutants affect

28

novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, no studies to date have

29

considered the impact of interactions between meteorological factors and air

30

pollutants on COVID-19 transmission. This study explores the association between

31

ambient air pollutants, meteorological factors and their interaction on confirmed case

32

counts of COVID-19 in 120 Chinese cities. We modeled total confirmed cases of

33

COVID-19 with meteorological factors, air pollutants and their interactions. To

34

account for potential migration effects, we included the migration scale index (MSI)

35

from Wuhan to each of the 120 cities included in the model, using data from 15

36

January to 18 March 2020. As an important confounding factor, MSI was considered

37

in a negative binomial regression analysis. Positive associations were found between

38

the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 and carbon monoxide, aerodynamic

39

particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 µm, relative humidity and ozone,

40

with and without MSI-adjustment. Negative associations were also found for sulfur

41

dioxide and wind velocity both with and without controlling for population migration.

42

In addition, air pollutants and meteorological factors had interactive effects on

43

COVID-19 after controlling for MSI. In conclusion, air pollutants, meteorological

44

factors and their interactions all affect COVID-19 cases.

1. Introduction

52

In Dec. 2019, a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute

53

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was reported in Wuhan City, P. R.

54

China (Wu et al. 2020, Zhou et al. 2020). The COVID-19 outbreak rapidly spread

55

across China and to many other countries (Holshue et al. 2020, Huang et al. 2017, Lai

56

et al. 2020, Wang et al. 2020a). Due to its transmissibility and increasing spread,

57

COVID-19 was officially declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization

58

(WHO)

59

(https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019). By 17 August

60

2020, COVID-19 had become prevalent in 188 countries, with a total of 21,869,433

61

confirmed

62

(https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/);

63

and

64

(http://www.nhc.gov.cn/xcs/xxgzbd/gzbd_index.shtml). This has created a worldwide

65

public health crisis.

66

Air pollutants can significantly affect health and the WHO indicates that 4.6 million

67

individuals die annually from diseases and illnesses directly related to poor air quality

68

(Tobias &Molina 2020). In particular, increasing numbers of studies suggest a

69

relationship between air pollution and infectious diseases. While previous studies

70

report no relationship between air pollution and SARS outbreaks (Cai et al. 2007,

71

Tobias &Molina 2020, Yusuf et al. 2007), a positive association was observed

72

between air pollutants (sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide and

73

ground-level ozone) and SARS fatality rates (Cui et al. 2003). Another study in

74

Brisbane suggested that high concentrations of ozone (O3) and particulate matter <10

75

microns (PM10) were associated with increased pediatric influenza cases (Xu et al.

2013).

77

Meteorological factors are another independent factor that can affect the spread of

78

infectious diseases (Cai et al. 2007, Xie &Zhu 2020). Although the association

79

between viruses leading to respiratory disease (e.g., SARS, viral influenza and

80

SARS-CoV-2) and meteorological factors has been explored (Yusuf et al. 2007),

81

results of these studies remain controversial. For example, Tan et al. found a sharp

82

change in ambient temperature was correlated with increased risk of SARS, (Tan et al.

83

2005), while Yao et al. found ambient temperature had no significant effect on the

84

transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 (Yao et al. 2020b). Other studies indicate that an

85

increase in average temperature contributes to an increase in average relative risk (RR)

86

but a decrease in daily confirmed case counts of SARS (Cai et al. 2007). These

87

inconsistent results may reflect an interaction occurring between pollutants and

88

meteorological effects on the transmission of these diseases.

89

The trends of the SARS outbreak may be influenced by air pollutants and

90

meteorological factors that change host susceptibility and survival time of SARS-CoV

91

in vitro (Cai et al. 2007). COVID-19 infections can cause serious respiratory disease.

92

Common symptoms at the beginning of infection include fever, cough, muscle aches

93

or fatigue, etc., similar to SARS-CoV (Liu et al. 2020b, Siordia 2020), and an effect

94

of air pollutants and meteorological factors, similar to that seen in SARS, on

95

confirmed COVID-19 cases has also observed (Jiang et al. 2020, Liu et al. 2020a,

96

Oliveiros et al. 2020, Wang et al. 2020b, Zhu et al. 2020); However, the interactive

97

effects of air pollutants and meteorological factors has not yet been considered. Given

98

the human to human transmission of COVID-19, population migration is also likely to

99

be an important confounding factor when evaluating the effects of meteorological

100

factors and air pollutants on COVID-19, and it has been established that COVID19

101

cases are almost linearly correlated with the number of people traveled from Wuhan to

102

the destination city (Hu Jianxiong 2020). In this study, we investigate the association

103

between ambient air pollutants, meteorological factors, and their interactive effects on

104

the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases while also controlling for population

105

migration effects, to extend and further our understanding of the relationship between

106

transmission of this disease and environmental factors.

107

2. Methods

108

2.1 Data collection

109

We observed the numbers of the confirmed cases in relation to air pollutants,

110

meteorological parameters and the migration scale index (MSI) in 120 Chinese cities

111

covering the majority of mainland China. The MSI reflects the scale of urban

112

migration into or out of the assigned population, using a horizontal comparison among

113

cities to reflect the trend of population migration between the city pairs. All cities

114

included had no less than five cases from 15 January to 18 March 2020 inclusive.

115

Wuhan was locked down at 10 am on 23 Jan, so we consider only people that traveled

116

from Wuhan to the destination city between 17 and 23 Jan. 2020. All data were taken

117

from the official website of Baidu Migration (https://qianxi.baidu.com/2020/). To

118

better fit the model, we do not include the data of Wuhan City since its large number

119

of the confirmed case counts skew the data and thus may reduce the robustness of the

120

model.

121

Daily confirmed case counts and daily air pollutants were collected from the

122

official website of Harvard University (https://dataverse.harvard.edu). Meteorological

123

indexes, including average temperature (AT), diurnal temperature range (DTR),

124

relative humidity (RH), wind velocity (WV), air pressure (AP), precipitation (PRE),

125

and hours of sunshine (HS), were obtained from China’s Meteorological Data Sharing

126

Service System (http://data.cma.cn/site/index.html). Air pollutant data included

127

particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 µm (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide

128

(NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O3). Pollutant

129

concentrations and meteorology parameters were available as daily means in each city;

130

we calculated a single mean for the 63 days of our date range for use in the model.

131

2.2 Statistical analysis

132

Descriptive analysis was performed on all data to explore the characteristics of total

133

confirmed case counts, average concentration of O3, NO2, SO2, CO, PM2.5, AT, DTR,

134

RH, WV, AP, PRE, HS and MSI. Meanwhile, to account for the lag effect and the

135

latent period of COVID-19, we evaluated associations with confirmed case counts

136

using lags of 0, 3, 7 and 14 d for air pollutants and meteorological factors (Liu et al.

137

2020a). Lags were incorporated into parameters by shifting the date range of the

138

appropriate number of days. For example, for lag 3, mean parameter values were

139

calculated using daily means from 15 Jan to 15 March for use in the model; confirmed

140

case counts were always for the date range 18 Jan to 18 March. Spearman correlation

141

analysis was employed to explore the correlation between meteorological factors and

142

air pollutants, and among air pollutants, meteorological factors and confirmed case

143

counts. We used generalized linear models with a negative binomial error distribution

144

to analyze associations between air pollutant factors (O3, NO2, SO2, CO and PM2.5),

145

meteorological factors (AT, DTR, RH, WV, AP, PRE and HS), MSI and the total

146

counts of confirmed case since the count data was expected to be clustered and thus

147

over-dispersed. First, we established simple negative binomial regression models

148

(including only one independent variable) to analyze each air pollutant,

149

meteorological factor, and MSI effects on confirmed case counts. We then conducted

150

multiple negative binomial regression models (including multiple independent

151

variables), with and without MSI, that included all above-mentioned air pollutants and

152

meteorological factors since the independent variables are not strongly correlated (all

153

|r| <0.9). The general negative binomial regression equation is:
Log (λ) = β0 + β1X1 + β2X2 + … + βmXm,

154

155

where λ represents the risk of being a confirmed case counts, X1, X2, …, Xm are the

156

factors that affect λ; and β1, β2, …, βm are the partial coefficients of X1, X2, and Xm,

157

respectively. To explore the interaction effects, we included Xi*Xj as an interaction

158

term in the model, where Xi and Xj represent an air pollutant and a meteorological

159

factor, respectively. A stratified analysis was done to consider the effect of air

160

pollutants on confirmed COVID-19 cases under different levels of meteorological

161

factors. When a significant interaction effect was present in the negative binomial

162

model, the meteorological factor was stratified into two groups using the median as

163

the dividing point, and a negative binomial model containing all pollutants and

164

remaining meteorological factors was fitted to analyze the effect of air pollutants on

165

the confirmed number of COVID-19 cases was done for each group.

166

All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 22.0 (SPSS Inc.,

167

Chicago, IL, USA) and R Core Team (2020). R: A language and environment for

168

198

Spearman correlation coefficients (rs) between concentrations of air pollutants and

199

meteorological factors are shown in Figure 1(b). Circle size indicates strength of

200

relationship between two variables. All correlations are less than |0.9|. Therefore, all

201

the variables could be integrated into the multiple negative binomial regression

model.

counts for the lag of 14 d are presented in a scatter plot in Figure 2. Positive

207

associations were present between the confirmed case counts and the pollutant

3.5 Negative binomial regression model analysis

215

Simple negative binomial regression results are shown in Figure S1(a-d). CO, NO2,

216

SO2, O3, PM2.5, RH, AT, AP, HS, WV and MSI were significantly associated with

217

confirmed cases counts (all P <0.05). PRE had no effect on confirmed case counts for

218

lags of 0, 3, 7 and 14 d, while DTR was significantly associated with confirmed cases

219

counts at lags of 7 and 14 d. The multiple negative binomial regression model results

220

(without adjusting for MSI) are shown in Figure 3(a1-d1). CO, PM2.5 and RH were

221

positively associated with confirmed case counts, while SO2 was negatively

222

associated with confirmed case counts at lags 0, 3, 7, and 14 d. However, O3 has a

223

positive effect on confirmed case counts at lag 0 and WV has a positive effect on

224

confirmed case counts at lag 14 d. After adjusting for migration using MSI, CO, PM2.5,

225

RH, O3, SO2, WV were also statistically significant, as shown in Figure 3(a2-d2).

(β = 6.045, P <0.001). An increase of SO2 was associated with lower risk of

250

confirmed case counts (β = -0.243, P <0.001) at high level AP, but was not

251

significantly associated with confirmed case counts at low level AP. PM2.5 variation

252

had no significant eﬀect for either low or high PRE levels. These results indicate that

253

the effects of CO and SO2 vary depending on the level of meteorological factors.

254

4. Discussion

255

In this work, we explored the role of air pollutants, meteorological factors and their

256

interactive effects on confirmed case counts in 120 Chinese cities. We focused on

257

these cities as their meteorological data was available (this is not true for all cities in

258

China). Our results indicate that air pollutants, meteorological factors and their

259

interaction are associated with COVID-19 confirmed case counts, with and without

260

adjusting using MSI.

261

Previous studies indicate that meteorological factors and air pollutants influence

262

prevalence of infectious diseases (e.g., influenza, SARS, MERS, COVID-19 (Cai et al.

263

2007, Liu et al. 2020a, Prata et al. 2020, Tan et al. 2005, van Doremalen et al. 2013,

264

Yusuf et al. 2007)). An ecological analysis carried out in China demonstrated that air

265

pollutants increase SARS case fatalities (Cui et al. 2003). As a major component of air

266

pollution, particulate matter is associated with a variety of cardiorespiratory diseases,

267

including acute lower respiratory tract infections. PM2.5 has adverse effects on human

268

health and is associated with many diseases, especially respiratory disease (Horne et

269

al. 2018). PM2.5 may damage bronchial immunity and epithelial cell integrity (Jiang et

270

al. 2020), which, in turn, will reduce the body's ability to fight off viruses, making

271

affected individuals more vulnerable to respiratory disease. Exposure to higher

272

concentrations of PM2.5 results in greater use of healthcare resources for acute lower

273

respiratory infection (Horne et al. 2018). Jiang et al. (Jiang et al. 2020), Suhaimi et al.

274

(Suhaimi et al. 2020) and Zhu et al. (Zhu et al. 2020) studies suggested that PM2.5 was

275

positively associated with confirmed COVID-19 cases, which were consistent with

276

our results (Figure 3). Cai et al. (2007) indicated that no correlation exists between air

277

pollution (including particulate matter, SO2, NO2, O3, and CO) and SARS outbreaks

278

(Cai et al. 2007). However, our results are consistent with Zhu et al. (Zhu et al. 2020),

279

who found that increases in CO were positively associated with the number of

280

confirmed COVID-19 cases, while SO2 was negatively correlated with COVID-19

281

cases (Figure 3). The difference is that migration was taken into account in our

282

analysis and it was not in the analysis by Zhu et al. (Zhu et al. 2020). Hu’s (Hu

283

Jianxiong 2020) study indicated that the cumulative number of reported COVID-19

284

cases in each province was positively correlated with the population index of Wuhan

285

moving out to each province, and the correlation coefficient is 0.84, so we believe that

286

it is necessary to control the population migration.

287

Kesic et al. suggests that exposure to O3 might disrupt the protease/anti-protease

288

balance of human airways, contributing to an increased influenza A infection rate

289

(Kesic et al. 2012). We similarly found that exposure to PM2.5, CO and O3 increased

290

likelihood of being infected by COVID-19 (Figure 3). Understanding the relationship

291

between air pollutant exposure and health provides clues regarding effective

292

protective measures that can reduce the incidence or risk of diseases. Despite the

293

positive relationship between air pollutants (including PM2.5, CO, and O3) and

294

confirmed COVID-19 cases and the negative relationship between SO2 and confirmed

295

COVID-19 cases that we found, the mechanism by which pollutants affect COVID-19,

296

whether via changes in the transmission of the virus or in the immunity of the human

297

body, remains unknown. Further experimental studies are required to explore the

298

molecular regulation mechanisms involved.

299

Meteorological factors such as AT, DTR, RH, WV, AP, PRE and HS are important

300

factors influencing the survival of microorganisms in the external environment

301

(Anwar et al. 2019, Bezirtzoglou et al. 2011, Casadevall 2020, Chan et al. 2011, Liu et

302

al. 2020a). For decades, experts have issued warnings that climate change may affect

303

the epidemiology of infectious diseases (Casadevall 2020). Global warming, rising

304

sea levels, and climate change will be accompanied by new and unknown diseases

305

(Bezirtzoglou et al. 2011, Casadevall 2020). Meteorological factors may change the

306

host's behavior, e.g., by affecting time spent indoors or outdoors, affect the host's

307

defense mechanisms (inhalation of dry and cold air will cause damage to the cleaning

308

function of cilia), or change the infectivity and stability of the virus. Although many

309

studies on meteorological factors and respiratory infectious diseases (including

310

COVID-19) exist, research results remain controversial. While temperature is unlikely

311

to act alone in determining the population’s health, but it can work synergistically

312

with other weather parameters to do so (Huang et al. 2017).

313

COVID-19 case numbers appear to increase with increasing temperature in the

314

range of -20 to 20 °C (Liu et al. 2020a). Other studies have reported that when AT is

315

below 3 °C, it is positively correlated with confirmed COVID-19 case counts (Xie

316

&Zhu 2020). A Brazilian study suggests a negative linear relationship exists between

317

AT and daily cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the temperature range of

318

16.8 to 27.4 °C (Prata et al. 2020), while Auler et al.’s research (also conducted in

319

Brazilian) suggests both higher AT and RH favor COVID-19 transmission.(Auler et al.

320

2020). The results of studies in some tropical countries emphasize that COVID-19

321

cases positively correlate with AT (Pani et al. 2020, Suhaimi et al. 2020, Tosepu et al.

322

2020). Another study demonstrated that in DTR increased in range of from 5 to 15 °C,

323

the counts of confirmed COVID-19 cases decreased, and that a non-linear relationship

324

occurred between COVID-19 cases and absolute humidity (Liu et al. 2020a). A study

325

of 244 cities in China found no significant associations between RH, AT and

326

cumulative incidence rate or R0 of COVID-19 (Yao et al. 2020a), which is in contrast

327

to our finding that RH and AT are positively associated with COVID-19 case counts

328

(Figure 3 and S1, respectively). Temperature in our study ranged from -12.48 to

329

21.29 °C, and our results of AT as positively associated with confirmed case counts is

330

consistent with other studies in tropical countries and China indicating that

331

COVID-19 can survive at higher temperatures, this reveals that COVID-19 can

332

survival under higher temperatures. Experimental research on SARS-CoV-2

333

confirmed that this virus is very stable at 4 °C, but when the temperature increases to

334

70 °C, inactivation time for the virus is shortened to 5 min (Chin et al. 2020).

335

Hu et al. reported that low WV might increase the risk of mumps (Hu et al. 2018).

336

Our multiple negative binomial regression models [lag 14 d in Figure 3(d1)] suggest

337

that WV is negatively associated with COVID-19 confirmed case counts, consistent

338

with Hu et al (Hu et al. 2018). Wind can affect the duration of droplets suspended in

339

air. In indoor environments, high wind speed means that rooms are well-ventilated

340

and in outdoor environments, high wind speed enhances dilution and removal of

341

droplets, both of which could shorten droplet suspension time in the air (Cai et al.

342

2007).

343

Regarding rainfall, our study showed PRE is positively related to confirmed case

344

counts (Figure 2); however, this effect was not statistically significant in simple and

345

multiple negative binomial regression analysis (Figure S1 and 3). Some

346

epidemiological data generally support a relationship between influenza virus

347

infection and PRE (Pica &Bouvier 2012). Agrawal et al. found a significant

348

association between rainfall and influenza virus infection in India, and fewer reports

349

of infection in the dry season (Agrawal et al. 2009). The association between PRE and

350

respiratory syncytial virus infection showed similar results in our research and in

351

other studies (Shek &Lee 2003).

352

To the best of our knowledge, interactive effects of air pollutants and

353

meteorological factors have not previously been identified as affecting COVID-19

354

cases but have been identified in noninfectious diseases (Guo et al. 2019, Huang et al.

355

2017) and cause-specific diseases (Chen et al. 2019). In this study, we observed

356

interactive effects on the total number of COVID-19 confirmed cases, especially for

357

CO, which showed interactions with three meteorological factors (HS, DTR and RH;

358

Table 2). The degree of increase in number of COVID-19 confirmed cases with CO

359

depends on the level of certain meteorological factors. For example, effect of CO on

360

confirmed cases is 5.763 (β = 5.763, P= 0.001) at low DTR level (< 50th percentile),

361

but it is 0.931 (β= 0.931, P= 0.035) at high DTR level (Table 3) and the interactive

362

effect was negative (β = -0.365, P = 0.029, Table 2), creating an antagonistic effect

363

between these two factors. Although the interactive effect of CO and HS was

364

statistically significant (β = -0.811, P = 0.009, Table 2), the stratified analysis did not

365

find differences between the two categories of HS (Table 3), and thus the biological

366

meaning of the interaction is unclear. Interactive effects of PM2.5 with PRE and SO2

367

with AP were also statistically significant. Our findings suggest that environmental

368

pollutants do not influence COVID-19 spread alone, but that they play important roles

369

in combination with meteorological variables. The exact mechanisms of these

370

interactive effects requires for further study.

371

We have comprehensively evaluated the effect of environmental pollution,

372

meteorological factors and their interaction on the number of confirmed COVID-19

373

cases with and without controlling for MSI, to increase understanding of these risk

factors on the transmission of COVID-19. The limitation of our research is that we

375

only analyzed data from 120 cities in China. Further studies are required in more

376

countries and regions to clarify the effect of environmental air pollutants on

377

COVID-19 infection rates worldwide.

378

5. Conclusion

379

Our work verifies that air pollutants, meteorological factors and their interaction

380

affect the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 even after controlling for

381

migration. Our study suggests that increased RH, CO and PM2.5 concentrations are

382

associated with increased numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases. In addition,

383

pollutant-meteorological factor interaction effects influenced COVID-19 infection

384

levels. Our research provides a theoretical basis for formulating public health policies

385

for the prevention and control of COVID-19 that take into consideration the effects

386

and relationship of air pollutants and meteorological factors.
