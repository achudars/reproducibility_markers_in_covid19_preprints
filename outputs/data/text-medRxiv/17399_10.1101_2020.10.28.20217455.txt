ABSTRACT
Introduction The management of pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 should rely
on early recognition of the risk for progression to severe respiratory failure (SRF) and
its prevention. We investigated if early suPAR (soluble urokinase plasminogen
activator receptor)-guided anakinra treatment could prevent COVID-19-assocated
SRF.
Methods In this open-label prospective trial, 130 patients admitted with SARS-CoV-2
pneumonia SARS-CoV-2 and suPAR levels ≥6 μg/l were assigned to subcutaneous
anakinra 100mg once daily for 10 days. The primary outcome was the incidence of
SRF at day 14. Secondary outcomes were 30-day mortality, changes in sequential
organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, of cytokine-stimulation pattern and of
circulating inflammatory mediators. Equal number of propensity score-matched
comparators for comorbidities, severity on admission and standard-of care (SOC)
were studied.
Results The incidence of SRF was 22.3% (95% CI, 16.0-30.2%) among anakinratreated patients and 59.2% (95% CI, 50.6-67.3%; P: 4.6 x 10-8) among SOC
comparators (hazard ratio, 0.30; 95%CI, 0.20-0.46). 30-day mortality was 11.5%
(95% CI, 7.1-18.2%) and 22.3% (95% CI, 16.0-30.2%) respectively (hazard ratio
0.49; 95% CI 0.25-0.97%; P: 0.041). Anakinra treatment was associated with
decrease in SOFA score and in circulating interleukin (IL)-6, sCD163 and sIL2-R; the
serum IL-10/IL-6 ratio on day 7 was inversely associated with the change in SOFA
score. Duration of stay at the intensive care unit and at hospital was shortened
compared to the SOC group; the cost of hospitalization was decreased.
Conclusions Early suPAR-guided anakinra treatment is associated with decrease of
the risk for SRF and restoration of the pro- /anti-inflammatory balance.

INTRODUCTION
Severe infection by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (known as COVID-19)
is associated with complex immune dysregulation of the host and it is usually
accompanied by unfavourable outcome1. When severe respiratory failure (SRF)
necessitating mechanical ventilation (MV) emerges, two separate immune
phenomena predominate in the infected host; i) macrophage activation syndrome; or
ii) complex immune dysregulation with down-regulation of the human leukocyte
antigen DR on circulating monocytes, lymphopenia and over-production of interleukin
(IL)-6 by monocytes1.
It is hypothesized that these immune reactions start early in patients with
lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) by SARS-CoV-2 and are progressively
enhanced so as to lead to SRF. This has been suggested to be due to the early
release of IL-1 from the lung epithelial cells that are infected by the virus; IL-1
stimulates further cytokine production from alveolar macrophages2.
As a consequence, it is assumed that early start of anti-IL-1 anti-inflammatory
treatment may prevent SRF3. However, most probably not all patients with LRTI by
SARS-CoV-2 are in need of early treatment and a screening tool to capture those
who are likely to progress to SRF would be an asset. Soluble urokinase plasminogen
activator receptor (suPAR) seems to be such a screening tool. We and others,
recently demonstrated that suPAR concentrations above 6 μg/l herald worsening to
SRF 14 days earlier4,5. The positive predictive value for the early prediction of SRF
was as high as 85.9%. uPAR is anchored to the cell membranes of the lung
endothelial cells. As result of the activation of kallikrein, uPAR is cleaved and enters
the systemic circulation as the soluble counterpart suPAR6.

We conducted the single-arm open label SAVE trial (suPAR-guided Anakinra
treatment for Validation of the risk and Early management of severe respiratory
failure by COVID-19) to investigate whether the early administration of anakinra in
patients with LRTI due to SARS-CoV-2 and suPAR equal to or greater than 6 μg/l,
may prevent the development of SRF. Anakinra is the recombinant soluble IL-1
receptor antagonist that blocks both IL-1α and IL-1β. We report herein the results of
the interim analysis in the first 130 enrolled patients and compare the efficacy of
anakinra with patients receiving standard-of-care (SOC) treatment.

METHODS
Trial oversight
SAVE is an ongoing open-label non-randomized trial conducted in six study
sites in Greece (EudraCT number 2020-001466-11; National Ethics Committee
approval 38/20; National Organization for Medicines approval ISO 28/20;
ClinicalTrials.gov registration NCT04357366). Comparators receiving SOC treatment
were hospitalized at the same time period in eight departments of Internal Medicine
in tertiary hospitals of Athens who were participating in the registry of the Hellenic
Sepsis Study Group without participating in the SAVE trial (www.sepsis.gr). The trial
was conducted by the Hellenic Institute for the Study of Sepsis (HISS) and funded in
part by HISS, by Technomar Shipping Inc, by Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB and by
the Horizon 2020 RISKinCOVID grant. The funders had no role in the design,
conduct, analysis and interpretation of data, and decision to publish. The laboratory
of Immunology of Infectious Diseases of the 4th Department of Internal Medicine at
ATTIKON University General Hospital served as a central laboratory for the study.
The initial draft of the manuscript was written by the first and the last author. All

authors vouch for the adherence of the trial to the protocol and first and last author
vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and analysis.

Patients
Enrolled patients were adults hospitalized with confirmed infection by SARSCoV-2 virus by real-time PCR reaction of nasopharyngeal secretions; radiological
findings compatible with LRTI; and plasma suPAR level ≥ 6 μg/l using the
suPARnostic® Quick Triage kit (Virogates S/A, Blokken 45, 3460 Birkerød,
Denmark). Exclusion criteria were: any stage IV malignancy; any do not resuscitate
decision; ratio of partial oxygen pressure to the fraction of inspired oxygen (pO2/FiO2)
less than 150; need for MV or non-invasive ventilation under positive pressure (NIV);
any primary immunodeficiency; neutropenia (<1,500/mm3); any intake of
corticosteroids at a daily dose ≥ 0.4mg/kg prednisone or equivalent the last 15 days;
any anti-cytokine biological treatment the last month; and pregnancy or lactation.
SOC comparators were meeting the same inclusion criteria and did not meet any of
the exclusion criteria of the SAVE trial. Written informed consent was provided by
the patient or legal representative before screening.

Trial interventions
Enrolled patients received 100mg anakinra subcutaneously once daily for 10
days. All other drugs were allowed. Fifteen ml of whole blood was collected before
start and seven days after start of anakinra and collected into EDTA-coated tubes
and sterile and pyrogen-free tubes for the isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMCs), serum and plasma. PBMCs were stimulated for cytokine production.
Blood was sampled from SOC comparators on the day of hospital admission and

repeated after seven days; plasma and serum were prepared. Biomarkers and
cytokines were measured in plasma, serum and supernatants of PBMC cultures. The
cost of hospitalization was also provided.

Outcomes
The incidence of SRF until day 14 was the primary outcome. SRF was defined
as any decrease of pO2/FiO2 below 150 necessitating MV or NIV. Patients dying
before day 14 were considered meeting the primary endpoint. Secondary outcomes
were 30-day mortality; and the changes of respiratory symptoms score, of sequential
organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, of PBMC cytokine stimulation and of
circulating plasma inflammatory mediators between days 1 and 7. Stay in the
intensive care unit (ICU) for patients who would be in need of MV, total hospital stay
and the cost of hospitalization were exploratory endpoints.
Adverse Events (AE) (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events,
version 4.03) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE) (see Supplementary Appendix)
were captured.

Statistical analysis
The sample size was calculated assuming the incidence of SRF would
decrease from 60% to 45% with anakinra treatment. To achieve so with 90% power
at the 5% level of significance, 260 patients were needed. An interim analysis was
planned when the first 130 patients would be enrolled.
Qualitative data were presented as percentages with confidence intervals (CI)
and quantitative data as median with quartiles. Among all selected comparators
receiving SOC treatment, 130 comparators were selected by propensity score 1:1

matching with patients treated with anakinra with SOC. Matching criteria were: age;
Charlson’s comorbidity index (CCI); admission severity scores namely pneumonia
severity index (PSI), acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II
score, SOFA score and WHO severity classification of COVID-19; and SOC
treatment with azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine and dexamethasone. Comparison
with anakinra-treated patients was performed by the Fisher’s exact test using
confirmatory forward stepwise Cox analysis (IBM SPSS Statistics v. 25.0).
Comparisons of cytokines and mediators between groups were done by the
Student’s “t-test” for parametric variables; and by the Mann-Whitney U test for nonparametric variables. Paired comparisons were done by the Wilcoxon’s rank-signed
test. Non-parametric correlations were done according to Spearman. Any two-sided
P value <0.05 was statistically significant.

RESULTS
Trial conduct
Interim analysis was performed when the 30-day follow-up of the first 130
patients was completed. The first patient was enrolled on April 16th 2020 and the last
on September 12th 2020; the inclusion of SOC comparators was done within the
same time frame. After propensity-matching, 130 SOC comparators were selected.
The study flow chart is shown in Figure S1. 211 patients were excluded because they
had suPAR less than 6 μg/l; patients were followed-up and SRF developed in only
one (0.47%) patient. Baseline demographics of patients receiving anakinra with SOC
treatment and of patients receiving only SOC treatment are shown in Table 1;
baseline demographics did not differ.

Study endpoints
Twenty-nine patients (22.3%; 95% CI, 16.0-30.2%) among the intention-totreat population with anakinra and SOC treatment progressed to SRF until day 14.
The incidence of SRF among the 130 SOC-treated comparators was 59.2% (n= 77)
(95% CI, 50.6-67.3% P: 4.6 x 10-8) (hazard ratio 0.30; 95%CI, 0.20-0.46) (Figure 1A).
Multivariate step-wise Cox regression analysis for variables showed that anakinra
treatment was the only independent variable protective from SRF (hazard ratio 0.28;
95% CI, 0.18-0.44; P: 2.4 x 10-8) (Table S1). One separate multivariate step-wise
Cox regression analysis among patients treated with dexamethasone showed
anakinra to be the only independent variable protective from SRF (Table S2).
Anakinra treatment was of benefit in most of secondary study endpoints, i.e.
30-day mortality; absolute change of SOFA score by day 14; and absolute change of
the respiratory symptoms score by days 7 and 14 (Table 2). Mortality of anakinra
treatment after 30 days was 11.5% (95% CI, 7.1-18.2%); this was 22.3% (95% CI,
16.0-30.2%) in patients receiving SOC (Figure 1B). Multivariate step-wise Cox
regression analysis for variables showed that anakinra treatment was the only
independent variable protective from 30-day mortality (hazard ratio 0.49; 95% CI
0.25-0.97; P: 0.041) (Table S3).
Two main secondary study outcomes were the effects of anakinra treatment
on circulating inflammatory biomarkers and on the function of PBMCs. Compared to
SOC comparators, anakinra-treated subjects experienced increase of the absolute
lymphocyte count and decreases of IL-6, sCD163 and of sIL-2R (Figure 2). The IL10/IL-6 ratio of serum (an index of the anti-inflammatory/pro-inflammatory balance in
severe COVID-197) was inversely associated with the absolute increase of the SOFA
score on day 14 among anakinra-treated patients, compatible with the anti-

inflammatory effect of anakinra. Remarkably, suPAR was increased among anakinratreated patients on day 7 from baseline. Thus anakinra is associated with protection
against progression to SRF even when the suPAR signal indicates an unfavourable
outcome. The function of PBMCs of patients was modulated among anakinra-treated
patients. More precisely, the production of IL-1β and IL-10 on day 7 was greater
among patients who did not develop SRF pointing towards a restoration of the ability
of the PBMCs to adapt to balanced production of anti-inflammatory and proinflammatory cytokines. This was further corroborated with the positive association
between the IL-10/IL-1β ratio of production from PBMCs on day 7 with the ratio of
serum IL-10/IL-6 of the same day (Figure S2).
The exploratory endpoints were the stay in the ICU and in hospital and the
cost of hospitalization. Patients who were eventually intubated and admitted in the
ICU showed a shorter median ICU stay when they had received previous treatment
with anakinra (Figure S3). The median overall hospital stay was 13 days for those
that were treated with anakinra plus SOC, and 15 days with only SOC treatment
(Figure S4). These differences were associated with significant decrease of the
overall cost of hospitalization from median €2,398.4 among SOC treated
comparators to €1,291.4 among anakinra-treated patients (Figure S5).

Safety
The adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) that were
captured during the study period of 14 days are listed in Table 3. The incidence of
the same events was depicted among SOC treated comparators. As shown in Table
3, the incidence of these events was not greater in the anakinra group than

12

comparators, with the only exception of leukopenia having a trend to be higher in the
anakinra group. SAEs were fewer among anakinra-treated patients.

DISCUSSION
Anakinra treatment of COVID-19 patients admitted with LRTI and suPAR
concentrations greater or equal than 6μg/l was associated with a relative decrease of
the incidence of SRF by 72%. Anakinra-treated patients who were admitted to the
ICU had a shorter stay in the ICU than those who did not receive anakinra. So
apparently the benefit of previous anakinra treatment remained. This is also reflected
by the overall decrease of 30-day mortality. An important point of the SAVE study is
the strategy to select for early anakinra treatment using the predictive biomarker
suPAR. In previous studies in COVID-19 and in sepsis, this marker turned out to be
able to predict the likelihood for unfavourable outcome4, 5, 8, 9.
Other studies have reported favourable effects of anakinra treatment in
COVID-19 pneumonia. In a retrospective analysis by Cavalli et al, 29 patients with
respiratory failure and respiratory ratio below 100 mmHg were treated with high dose
anakinra intravenously (5mg/kg twice daily). Treatment was associated with clinical
improvement in 72% and remarkably higher survival rate10. In the Ana-COVID
prospective study, 52 patients with confirmed COVID-19 and bilateral lung infiltrates
and oxygen saturation less than 93% were treated with 100mg anakinra
subcutaneously twice daily for three days followed by 100 mg subcutaneously once
daily for another seven days. The study had a composite endpoint much similar to
the endpoint of the SAVE study; i.e. MV and/or death. Anakinra treatment achieved a
78% decrease of this composite endpoint compared to 44 historical controls.
However, studied comparators were not matched for co-administered medication

such as azithromycin and hydroxychloqoquine11. In a retrospective study, 12 patients
with COVID pneumonia and increased C-reactive protein were intravenously treated
with anakinra 300 mg/day; none died12.
It is difficult to compare these three studies as enrolled patients had different
stages of COVID and variable disease severity. Hence the clinical dilemma is which
patients would benefit from anakinra, in what stage of COVID, and in what dosage
regimen. In this respect, the SAVE study gives guidance: the best candidates are
patients with high likelihood of SRF as defined by increased suPAR; anakinra
presented one well-acceptable safety profile at the standard subcutaneous daily dose
of 100 mg.
An important additional finding of the SAVE trial is that it provides mechanistic
insight into the biological effects of anakinra: the treatment was associated with a
reset of the pro- versus anti-inflammatory balance of the host. The production
capacity of PMBCs for the anti-inflammatory IL-10 was increased and this was
reflected by the serum IL-10/IL-6 ratio. IL-10/IL-6 is an index of the antiinflammatory/pro-inflammatory balance which is severely disturbed in severe COVID19, much more than in bacterial sepsis7. The described reset in the production
capacity of the PBMCs was linked to clinical benefit since the serum IL-10/IL-6 ratio
was inversely associated with the absolute change of SOFA score. Anakinra
treatment also decreased the elevated serum concentrations of sCD163 and sIL2-R
that are biomarkers of macrophage activation13, 14. It was been noted before that
patients with COVID-19 who deteriorate have characteristics of macrophage
activation15; the decrease of these biomarkers indicates attenuation of macrophage
activation among anakinra-treated patients.

The SAVE trial was designed in mid-March 2020 at the beginning of the
pandemic in Greece. It was chosen to adapt an open-label and single-arm design in
an attempt to help as many patients as possible since no SOC was framed at that
time period. The SOC parallel comparators were optimally matched without
differences in baseline severity and co-administered treatment. The extremely low P
value of significance between patients receiving anakinra with SOC treatment and
patients receiving only SOC treatment is favoring the importance of the findings.
When the study was started, dexamethasone treatment was not yet part of the SOC
treatment but in the following months many patients received dexamethasone. Since
dexamethasone acts as a cytokine-inhibiting agent, it is an important question how
strong would the effect of anakinra be when patients also receive dexamethasone.
Although this is not a preset endpoint, post-hoc analysis shows that anakinra is also
protective in patients receiving dexamethasone (Table S2)
The impact of this interim analysis in the Greek Infectious Diseases
community was immense. Enthusiasm shared among physicians led to high demand
for joining the trial from many other study sites. As such, the SAVE on-going trial has
been amended for the inclusion of 27 study sites.
In conclusion, we propose a novel strategy using suPAR as an early
biomarker that can effectively identify those patients at high risk for SRF. In these
patients, prophylactic treatment with regular doses of anakinra is associated with
prevention of the incidence of SRF. The restoration of the pro-inflammatory/antiinflammatory balance is proposed as the mechanism of anakinra action.

Figure 2 Effect of anakinra treatment on circulating mediators of patients with
lower respiratory tract infection by SARS-CoV-2
Concentrations of A) suPAR (soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor); B)
the absolute lymphocyte count; C) interleukin (IL)-6; and D) sCD163 of patients
under standard-of-care treatment (SOC, blue colour) and of patients under SOC
treatment with anakinra (red colour) at baseline (day of hospital admission) and day 7
of follow-up are shown. The concentrations of sIL-2R on day 7 are provided in panel
E. The number of patients in each group is provided inside the bars.
Lines refer to median values. Comparisons between different groups were performed
by the Mann-Whitney U test and within the same group by the Wilcoxon test.
Statistical comparisons: ns, non-significant; *P< 0.05; **P<0.01; ***P<0.0001
The correlation of the IL-10/IL-6 ratio with the absolute change of the SOFA
(sequential organ failure assessment) score on day 14 from the baseline is also
shown (panel F). The Spearman rank of order correlation co-efficient and the P-value
of the correlation is provided.
