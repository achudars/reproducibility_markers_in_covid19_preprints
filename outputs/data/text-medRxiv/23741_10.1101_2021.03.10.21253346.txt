Acceptance and intake of COVID-19 vaccines among older Germans

Abstract: The main aim of this study was to investigate the various factors influencing
COVID-19 vaccination acceptance and actual intake among older Germans aged over 75
years old (N = 1037). We found that the intention to get vaccinated or intake of the COVID19 vaccine were positively related to the perceptions of becoming infected, perceptions of the
severity of the potential long-term effects, the vaccine’s efficacy, and the benefits of
vaccination. Meanwhile, the intention to get the vaccine or vaccine intake were decreased by
perceptions of the negative side-effects and the general impediments to vaccination.

Introduction
In December 2019, a new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan
(China) and then rapidly spread worldwide. The incident was classified as a Public Health
Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization (WHO) on January
30, 2020 and declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020 [1]. In Germany, 2,216,363 people had
been infected with the coronavirus as of January 31, 2021, with 56,945 fatalities [2]. In line
with recommendations from the WHO, Germany developed a pandemic preparedness plan,
the main component of which is a vaccination program [3, 4]. As much of the European
countries, Germany started a mass vaccination program towards the end of December 2020.
Till the end of January 2020, only 1.3 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been
administered in Germany, which has a population of 83 million and initially ordered 55.8
million doses of the vaccine. But the rollout has been slow and beset by problems, including
lack of supply, and latterly, a reluctance amongst Germans to receive the Oxford/AstraZeneca
vaccine, after German authorities declared it had not been tested rigorously enough to allow
its use on the over-65s. That decision triggered suspicions that it was not safe. Reports of
lingering side effects have not helped [2].
Very little research has been made on the factors affecting COVID-19 vaccine
acceptance now that the vaccines are available to the general public [5, 6]. Most of the
previous studies on vaccine acceptance were conducted in the pre-pandemic stage when no
COVID-19 vaccines were available or only focused on certain groups, such as healthcare
professionals [7, 8, 9, 10]. Thus, the existing literature may not provide a good indication of
likely vaccine uptake because of changing public perceptions of the epidemic and the vaccine
as the situation evolves. Additionally, there are numerous differences between healthcare
professionals and the general population: healthcare workers are more susceptible to illness
than the general public as a direct result of their employment and they may be endowed with
specialist knowledge as a result of their professional status. It has been shown that healthcare

workers that are on call for emergencies or are ready to carry out extra consultations to deal
with the pandemic, as well as those who show positive attitudes towards COVID-19
protection methods, are more likely to accept a COVID-19 vaccination [11].
Besides, more remarkable, there is a significant gap between intention and actual
behavior to get vaccinated. A recent investigation showed that the willingness for influenza
vaccination was 45% in general population [12], while the actual vaccination coverage was
9.4%, which was reported by a meta-analysis [13]. These indicate that there are barriers
existed from intention to behavior besides the cognitive factors, which affected the
vaccination willingness, such as not receiving recommendation from doctor and not having
cost-free vaccination [13]. Previous studies have examined factors associated with intention
of COVID-19 vaccination [7, 9, 10]. However, less is known about COVID-19 vaccination
intention, actual uptake and the related factors among older adults.
Vaccine acceptance among general population was also associated with factors such as
the perceived risk of COVID-19 infection and concern regarding side effects [14-16]. Studies
on the uptake of seasonal influenza vaccination have shown that the perceived risk of catching
influenza and belief in the efficacy of the vaccine are the main drivers towards vaccine
acceptance whilst fear of adverse effects is the main deterrent [15-17]. Moreover, literature
related to SARS and A/H1N1 indicated that people are more likely to comply with the
recommendations if they believe that the consequences of the illness are serious, that the
information provided by the government on the outbreak is accurate; that the government can
be trusted to manage the outbreak; and that the outbreak is likely to last for a long time [1820]. People with a family and/or children and those suffering from a severe chronic illness are
also likely to accept the COVID-19 vaccination [7-9]. The effectiveness of a vaccination
program is dependent on wide vaccine uptake, even for vaccines with high efficacy. Thus, it

is important to understand the various factors that affect a person’s willingness to get
vaccinated in order to establish effective public health strategies during a pandemic [14, 16].
This study investigated the associations between various beliefs and perceptions and
the intention to accept and to intake a vaccination against COVID-19. It will be useful to
understand older Germans’ views on COVID-19 vaccination for an outbreak response and
management, as well as for the period after the pandemic. Therefore, this study investigated
the various factors influencing COVID-19 vaccination acceptance and actual intake among
older Germans aged over 75 years old.
Methods
Procedure
Data collection was conducted in Germany from 4th to 17th January 2021. At the time,
the country was experiencing high death and infection rates due to the COVID-19 pandemic,
although a vaccine had recently been made available. The questionnaire was first submitted to
two professional psychologists to assess the face validity, and then a pilot survey was
performed on 15 psychology students. These same students were also instructed in the data
collection method, and they subsequently gathered the study’s final data in their respective
hometowns. The sample population comprised conveniently approached individuals with a
minimum age of 75 residing in different households. Students, who conducted the present
study, followed appropriate health guidelines such as social distancing during data collection
to protect the health and safety of respondents. Study was approved by the appropriate ethics
review committee of the University of xxx, prior to initiation. Prospective participants were
assured of confidentiality and asked to complete the form anonymously. Additionally, the
questionnaire form did not include any questions about such issues that may be perceived as
personal or sensitive ones. The ratio of the number of individuals asked to participate to the
number of completed responses received was considered the response rate.

Sample
Overall, 1512 individuals over 75 years old were approached, of which 428 declined,
meaning 1084 completed questionnaires were gathered for a response rate of 71.7%. The
questionnaires from 47 (3.1% from 1512) participants were subsequently eliminated from the
data as they tested positive for COVID-19. Thus, the final sample consisted of 1037
participants (584 female and 453 male) of all ages ranging from 76 to 90 years (M = 80.90,
SD = 6.35). The demographic information of the participants is presented in Table 1, showing
that most were middle-class, had completed secondary or higher education, were either
single/divorced/or widowed. This underlines that the sample population is not representative
of the German population but rather represents the educated urban middle class.
Measures
Demographic factors
The research form included questions regarding the following demographic factors:
gender, age, education, socioeconomic status, marital status, and having children. In addition,
the respondents’ were questioned about their health conditions with the following two
questions: ‘‘How good is your health generally?’’ with the choices of ‘’Very good’’,
‘’Good’’, ‘’Bad’’ and ‘’Very bad’’, and ‘‘Do you have any of the following chronic
illnesses?’’ with the choices of ‘‘cancer’’, ‘‘heart disease’’, ‘‘lung disease’’, ‘‘liver or kidney
disease’’ and ‘‘any other illness’’ (Table 1).
[Table 1 about here]
Questions on COVID-19
Participants’ perceptions of COVID-19 were evaluated through items on
susceptibility, long-term effects, the pandemic’s impact on daily life, and their predictions on
the pandemic situation in the country in three months’ time. We also used two items to assess
to what extent they had faith in the health authorities (Table 2). Next, the questionnaire

measured the participants’ perceptions of the media’s reporting on the issue of COVID-19
vaccines.
[Table 2 about here]
Questions on vaccination against COVID-19
Intake of the vaccine was measured with a question ‘’Have you already been
vaccinated against COVID-19?’’. If the answer was ‘’no’’, data collectors asked a question
“If it were offered now, would you take the COVID-19 vaccine?” was used to assess the
participants’ attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination.
Moreover, the study used a survey questionnaire to assess the sample population’s
perception of COVID-19 vaccination in terms of the barriers (4 items) and benefits (4 items)
on a 5-point Likert scale (from ‘’1 – strongly disagree’’ to ‘’5 – strongly agree’’) (adapted
from previous research [12-16]). The questionnaire items on participants’ perceptions of
vaccines were partially derived from the Health Belief Model (HBM). This model is used to
describe individuals’ health-related behavior according to their perception of predisposition,
efficacy, and outcomes. Questions investigated the participants’ perceptions of the vaccine’s
efficacy and the likelihood of developing negative side-effects after vaccination as well as the
severity of these effects (all items are presented in Table 2). The scores of the eight items
were subjected to principal factor analysis, presenting a two-factor orthogonal rotation (r = 0.30, p < 0.01). All items showed factor loadings above 0.57 and no cross-loadings were
found. The benefits and barriers had Cronbach’s alphas of 0.78 and 0.80, respectively.
Analysis
The categorical variables were subjected to chi-square analysis (Table 1), while oneway ANOVA was performed for the continuous variables (Table 2). Based on the results of
the chi-square and ANOVA analyses, variables were selected for multinomial logistic
regression, which was chosen as three response categories were included in the dependent

variable, i.e. “intention to get vaccinated” (‘’yes’’, ‘’no’’, ‘’already vaccinated’’). Those
participants who reported having already received the COVID-19 vaccine were no longer
susceptible to the disease, thereby distinguishing them from the other two groups; they were
nonetheless not excluded from the analysis. The aim hereby was to achieve a full response set
that ranged from “no intention” to “full intention”.
Results
The model fitting statistics presented that the final model outperformed the null model
(ꭓ2= 507.65, p < 0.01) and clarified a critical sum of variety in deliberate of taking the
immunization (Nagelkerke pseudo-R2 value was 0.61). The full model with all three variable
types was used to produce the following results, as presented in Table 3. We found that the
intention to get vaccinated or intake of the COVID-10 vaccine were positively related to the
perceptions of becoming infected, perceptions of the severity of the potential long-term
effects, the vaccine’s efficacy, and the benefits of vaccination. Meanwhile, the intention to get
the vaccine or vaccine intake were decreased by perceptions of the negative side-effects and
the general impediments to vaccination. The most crucial factor was the perception of the
vaccine’s efficacy, and respondents with this belief had over 4 times greater likelihood of
intending to receive the vaccine. There was also a significant relationship between being
vaccinated and the perception of the pandemic situation in the country in three months’ time.
Next, it is interesting to note that while the media’s overreporting of the side-effects was
associated with the intention to get vaccinated, no such relationship was found for having
been vaccinated. Additionally, having a chronic illness and general health conditions were
both associated with having been vaccinated and the intention to get vaccinated. Meanwhile,
marital status (being single, widowed or divorced) was not associated with having already
been vaccinated; however it was significantly associated with the intention to get vaccine in
the future. Belief in the vaccine’s efficacy and benefits increased the likelihood of having

already been vaccinated, while the perception of the side effects was negatively associated
with having already been vaccinated.

Discussion
The main aim of this study was to investigate the various factors influencing COVID19 vaccination acceptance and actual intake among older Germans aged over 75 years old.
Demographic factors and vaccination acceptance/intake
Single people showed increased intention to get vaccinated, and having a chronic
illness was associated with an increased likelihood of being vaccinated against COVID-19.
This stronger tendency to accept the vaccination amongst single people could be related to
concerns about not having someone to care for them if they fall ill. Another explanation could
be that single people are less worried about the potential risks from vaccination because they
have no dependents to be affected by these risks. The fact that chronically ill people already
received the COVID-19 vaccine might be concordant with the fact that those with a chronic
illness were more likely to follow rules, guidelines, and recommendations during the COVID19 pandemic, or to take a seasonal influenza vaccination [9, 21]. The presence of a chronic
illness seemed to be well correlated with vaccination status, although it did not directly affect
the intention to get vaccinated. Health authority recommendations were better adhered to by
people with a chronic illness than those without [3]. Females and parents of children have
been previously reported to show good adherence to the recommended behaviors, whereas
people of low socioeconomic or educational status were less likely to follow the
recommendations [21-25]. However, in the present study, these factors were not found to be
associated with vaccination intention. Vaccination uptake intention was found to be rather
medium, irrespective of socioeconomic or demographic factors. Despite this low uptake, an

encouraging aspect of this result is that the campaigns intended to increase vaccine uptake
rates are likely to be equally effective among a wide range of people.
COVID-19-related factors and vaccine intake/acceptance
In previous research, susceptibility to infection has been reported to be one of the main
predictors for vaccine uptake [15-16]. Other reported predictors of vaccine uptake include the
possible severe consequences of the disease, believing that the pandemic is likely to continue
for a long time, and trust in the information supplied by the authorities [22-25]. In the present
study, there was also an association between susceptibility to illness and either COVID-19
vaccination intention or intake. An association was found between the possible severe
consequences of the illness and the intention to get vaccinated, as well as with the status of
having already been vaccinated. These results are consistent with the outcome of a previous
study indicating that the correlations between perceived susceptibility, severity, and COVID19 vaccine acceptance were statistically significant. People who felt that the epidemic seemed
to worsen in Germany were generally have already been vaccinated, whilst intention to be
vaccinated was not linked to the perceptions regarding the duration of the epidemic.
Furthermore, the perceived impact of the epidemic on everyday life, trust in the information
on COVID-19 provided by the government, or trust in the government’s management of the
epidemic were not associated with the intention to be vaccinated or the vaccination intake. No
strong link was found between the intention to be vaccinated or the vaccination intake and the
perceptions of COVID-19. This could be because the data were collected some time after the
epidemic started, so people might be taking COVID-19 less seriously and treating it like
ordinary seasonal respiratory illness.
Perceptions regarding the intention to get vaccinated/vaccine intake
From the start of 2021, the media moved its focus from COVID-19 to the vaccine.
Accordingly, the intention to be vaccinated was more closely related to the vaccine-related

factors than to the illness. In line with previous studies on vaccination for seasonal influenza,
this study also found that trust in the vaccine’s effectiveness was associated with both the
intention to be vaccinated and the vaccination intake [26-27]. Effectiveness of the vaccine in
the face of mutated versions was a significant worry regarding the vaccine. The likelihood,
but not the expected severity, of side effects was significantly associated with both the
vaccination intake and the intention to be vaccinated. The respondents mainly based their risk
estimations on the likelihood rather than the severity of the side effects. Concerns over side
effects has been shown in previous studies to be closely related to vaccination acceptance [1516]. People’s perception of the information on the COVID-19 vaccine provided by the media
might be related to vaccination intention; thus, people who believe that the adverse effects are
exaggerated by the media might be more likely to be willing to receive the vaccine. Perhaps
counterintuitively, this may be due to people’s attitude to the vaccine rather than their actual
perceptions of the media reports — people who already view vaccination positively believe
that negative side effects are exaggerated in media reports.
Barriers to vaccination identified in this study include the worries and negative
attitudes towards the vaccine, while the benefits factor comprised the positive attitudes [1516, 28-30]. The barriers to vaccination were linked with the vaccination intention but not with
the actual vaccination intake. It is likely that the respondents who had already been vaccinated
had overcome the barriers in their minds, whilst those who expressed their intention to get
vaccinated still had some doubts. This could also be explained by dissonance reduction,
whereby people who have already received the vaccination feel the need to justify to
themselves why they received it. Both the vaccination intention and the vaccination intake
were significantly associated with the perception of the benefits of the vaccine. Studies related
to vaccination against seasonal influenza have shown that both benefits and barriers are
related to vaccination intention and likelihood [15-16]. The present study suggests that for

vaccine uptake, it is more important to increase the public’s sense of benefiting from the
vaccine than to focus on removing barriers.
Limitations and future directions
Our work suffers from limitations. First, our sample is not completely representative
of the German elderly. Since the sample was not chosen at random, the inherent bias in
convenience sampling means that the sample was unlikely to be representative of the
population being studied. This undermines our ability to make generalisations from our
sample to the population we were studying. Moreover, participants from our study might stay
home most of time during the pandemic with limited social interactions. This means that these
results cannot necessarily be extrapolated to the general elderly population. Next, in the same
vein, we did not collect demographical characteristics as region of residence. Vaccine
acceptance might be greater in regions highly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, as
previously observed in Lombardy [31]. Third, the cross-sectional nature of this investigation
precludes us from drawing causal inferences. Furthermore, the cross-sectional survey design
necessarily represents a snapshot in time, rather than the evolving landscape of the public’s
attitudes about COVID-19 vaccination. All the information obtained was self-reported and
reporting bias always exists. Although the data was collected from the heterogenous group,
we targeted individuals who are willing to participate and give their answers. The individual’s
opinion also can be unstable. Any unexpected event could lead to drastic change in their
opinion about the vaccination. Next, even though the questionnaire was anonymous, it is still
possible that a social-desirability bias tainted respondents’ answers to the questionnaire about
intentions and behaviors. The final limitation concerns the timing of the survey that might
have led to both an overestimate of willingness to receive the vaccination and an
underestimate of the vaccine coverage rate among German elderly population since the
controversy about the efficacy, safety, and necessity of the vaccine against COVID-19. Third

wave of COVID-19 pandemic in Germany was growing over the study period [2]. Future
longitudinal research is needed to determine the direction of causality for these associations. It
would also be desirable to compare the public’s responses in other countries that were
similarly affected.
Conclusions
The final regression model revealed that there was no link between the demographic
(apart from marital status and having a chronic illness) or situational factors and the
respondent’s intention to be vaccinated against COVID-19. It is clear from the results
reported in this study that vaccine-related factors are more important than epidemic-related
factors in determining vaccination intention and intake. Thus, to improve the vaccination
uptake rates during the COVID-19 pandemic, health authorities should focus on the vaccinerelated factors rather than the aspects related to the illness. This could be particularly
important in encouraging vaccine uptake in the later stages of the outbreak since people are
likely to be well-informed about the illness but have misconceptions and concerns about the
vaccine. Eliminating these misunderstandings and concerns is likely to increase the vaccine
uptake rates during the current COVID-19 pandemic.
