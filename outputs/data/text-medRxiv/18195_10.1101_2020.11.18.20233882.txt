Abstract
Background: Internationally, the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic has caused
unprecedented challenges for surgical staff to minimise the exposure to COVID-19 or save
medical resources without harmful outcomes for patients, in accordance with the statement
of each surgical society. However, no research has empirically validated declines in Japanese
surgical volume or compared decrease rates of surgeries during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Material and Methods: We extracted 672,772 available cases of patients aged > 15 years
who were discharged between July 1, 2018, and June 30, 2020. After categorisation of
surgery, we calculated descriptive statistics to compare the year-over-year trend and
conducted interrupted time series analysis to validate the decline.
Results: The year-over-year trend of all eight surgical categories decreased from April 2020
and reached a minimum in May 2020 (May: abdominal, 68.4%; thoracic, 85.8%;
genitourinary, 78.6%; cardiovascular, 90.8%; neurosurgical, 69.1%; orthopaedic, 62.4%;
ophthalmologic, 52.0%; ear/nose/throat, 27.3%). Interrupted time series analysis showed no
significant trends in oncological and critical benign surgeries.
Conclusion: We demonstrated and validated a trend of reduction in surgical volume in Japan
using administrative data applying interrupted time series analyses. Low priority surgeries,
as categorised by the statement of each society, showed obvious and statistically significant
declines in case volume during the COVID-19 pandemic.

1. Introduction
The rapid spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which first appeared in
Wuhan, China, has been increasing and disrupting healthcare systems worldwide.1 During
the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been over 4.5 million cases and over 300,000 deaths
internationally, which has caused unprecedented challenges for surgical staff.2-4 To minimise
exposure to COVID-19 and save medical resources to prevent harmful outcomes for patients,
cancellation or triage of surgeries are recommended.3-5 Patients with critical disease and
cancers should still receive surgery as usual, whereas cases with benign diseases can be
postponed.6-8
Previous studies suggest that there are wide variations of trends in the affected
number of surgical procedures depending on the country and time period.3,4,9 For example,
estimates of cancelled or postponed surgeries during the first wave of the COVID-19
pandemic in Japan were about 1.4 million cases (73% of the total), similar to other
high-income countries.3 Of these, approximately 98,000 were oncological surgeries with a
cancellation rate of 30% and the remaining 1,253,000 cases were benign surgeries with a
cancellation rate of 84%.3 Referring to this estimate, the Japanese Surgical Society (JSS,
which consists of 10 major surgical societies in Japan) announced the importance of triage
by the patients’ severity and surgical recovery planning for the backlog of surgeries.10 A
comprehensive surgical and medical care strategy is also recommended to prevent potential
adverse health implications caused by surgical delays.11
However, there are no studies on the trends of surgeries during the pandemic in
Japan, one of the regions most affected by COVID-19 at the earliest stage of the pandemic
and where the first wave of the pandemic converged most quickly (Figure 1). Several
publications have dealt with the issue of triaging elective surgeries, but the types of surgeries
affected remains unclear. In this report, we performed a retrospective cohort study discussing

the impact of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic on Japanese elective surgical
procedures by major surgical types using administrative data in Japan. We sought to identify
which surgical areas were the most affected by the COVID-19, and to statistically evaluate
the decline in major operative procedures, referring to the priorities announced by each
surgical society.
2. Methods
2.1. Data source
We used Diagnosis Procedure Combination (DPC) data from the Quality
Indicator/Improvement Project (QIP) database, the programme administered by the
Department of Healthcare Economics and Quality Management, Kyoto University. QIP
participant hospitals voluntarily provide claim data, the DPC data, to improve their quality of
care and system using quality indicators. There were over 200 QIP participant hospitals all
over Japan including both public and private hospitals with various sizes: the number of
general beds, which are hospital beds that are not psychiatric, infectious diseases, and
tuberculosis beds, according to the Japanese classification of hospital beds, ranged from 30
to 1,151 in 2019.
The DPC/per-diem payment system (PDPS) is a Japanese prospective payment
system applied to acute care hospitals, which is comparable to diagnosis-related databases in
the United States.12,13 A total of 1,730 hospitals adopted the DPC/PDPS in 2018, which
accounted for 54% of all general beds in Japanese hospitals.14,15 DPA data do not include
information on laboratory findings and reasons for surgery; instead provide information
included in the discharge summary, such as primary diagnosis, comorbidities (identified by
using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision [ICD-10] codes), type of
surgery, drug or device prescriptions, and codes corresponding to the medical procedures
performed.

2.2. Study population
Among QIP hospitals, we detected 254 hospitals, 672,772 cases of patients over 15
years old with surgery whose discharge summary was available from between July 1, 2018,
and June 30, 2020, which was used for interrupted time series analysis (ITS) analysis. Figure
2 shows the flow chart of selection processes for each analysis. After identification of the
population for ITS analysis, to see the trend of the number of surgical cases during the first
wave of the pandemic, we compared patients who were admitted and discharged between
July 1, 2018 and June 30, 2019 with those between July 1, 2019 and June 30, 2020.
2.3. Variables and surgical type
For patients’ background characteristics, we referred to their sex, age, and length of
stay (LOS), as well as the Charlson and Elixhauser comorbidity indices.16 We also identified
the type of surgery from the main surgery during admission. Categorisation was based on the
major surgical areas and previous reports5,9: abdominal (stomach cancer surgery; colorectal
cancer surgery; hepato-pancreatic-biliary [HPB], cancer surgery; benign popular including
hernia surgery, cholecystectomy, and appendicectomy; other benign surgeries), thoracic
(lung cancer, breast cancer, and benign surgeries), genitourinary (bladder cancer; prostate
cancer; uterine/adnexa cancer; benign popular surgeries including hysterectomy,
salpingo-oophorectomy; other benign surgeries; caesarean section), cardiovascular (valve
surgery, aortic surgery, coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG], dialysis fistula, other),
neurosurgery (intracranial surgery including hematoma, vascular, and tumour; spine surgery;
other), orthopaedic (fracture-related surgery; arthroplasty; other), ophthalmology (popular
surgery including cataract, vitreous, and blepharoplasty; other), and ear/nose/throat (ENT:
popular surgery including tonsillectomy, endoscopic sinus surgery, and tympanoplasty;
other). Due to the wide variety of surgical procedures, we created the category of popular

surgery defined as the top three most common surgeries in Japan based on the National
Database of Health Insurance Claims and Specific Health Checkups of Japan (NDB), which
covers the medical claim information of the entire Japanese population of 127 million.17
Details of surgical classification are shown by K codes, which are the claims codes for
surgery, in supplemental Table 1.

2.4. Statistics
2.4.1. Descriptive statistics
The year-over-year trend of the case volume per month by the eight types of surgery
between July 1, 2019 and June 30, 2020 compared to that between July 1, 2018 and June 30,
2019 is presented in Figure 3, using line graphs. Especially, details of each surgical category
in March, April, and May, which appear to be the first wave COVID-19 pandemic, were
calculated.
2.4.2. Interrupted time series analyses for changes in case rates
We used ITS, including segmented regressions, to ascertain volume changes due to
the COVID-19 pandemic on population-level admissions. We statistically tested the changes
of the volume of surgeries based on the date of discharge adjusted for seasonality through a
Fourier term.18 We regarded comparing the volume of scheduled admissions with surgeries
per month using the date of discharge rather than admission, to be appropriate because DPC
data were generated after patients’ discharge. We hypothesise that COVID-19 would have
affected the level change of scheduled admission volume especially after April 2020 as an
implemented point, in which the Japanese Society of Anaesthesiologists and the JSS
requested surgeons to triage some elective surgeries. We divided our datasets into two
periods for ITS analysis: before the JSS surgical-triage-statement (July 2018 to March 2020)
and after that (April 2020 to June 2020). Monthly case volumes of scheduled admission with

surgery are presented in the figures using line graphs. Baseline demographics for the
population for ITS analysis are listed in Supplemental tables 2~10. Age was expressed as
mean ± SD and LOS as median [interquartile range] and were compared using
Mann-Whitney U tests. Categorical variables were expressed as percentages and compared
using χ2 tests. The level of statistical significance was set at p < 0.05 (two-tailed). Statistical
analyses were performed with R version 4.0.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing,
Vienna, Austria).
The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Kyoto University
Graduate School, Kyoto, Japan (R0135). This study was conducted in accordance with the
ethical guidelines for medical and health research involving human participants issued by the
Japanese National Government. The data were anonymised, and the requirement for
informed consent was waived.
3. Results
3.1. Overview of entire surgery
Figure 3 displays the year-over-year trend of the case volume per month of each
surgical type based on the date of admission. Every type of surgical volume, especially
ophthalmologic and ENT surgeries, tended to decrease from April and reached a minimum in
May (May: abdominal, 68.4%; thoracic, 85.8%; genitourinary, 78.6%; cardiovascular,
90.8%; neurosurgical, 69.1%; orthopaedic, 62.4%; ophthalmologic, 52.0%; ENT, 27.3%;
supplemental Table 2). Table 1 shows the monthly cases by the eight surgical categories
based on the date of discharge, which was calculated for ITS analysis, and also indicated the
smallest number of cases in May for all surgical types.
3.2. Abdominal surgery
Prior year comparison of stomach, colorectal, and HPB cancer were almost the
same in March and April. However, benign surgeries were considerably lower in April and

May than in the previous year (supplemental Figure 1: popular, 53.9%; other, 71.6%).
According to the ITS analysis, the surgical volume of oncological surgeries was not
statistically affected by COVID-19, whereas benign surgeries were affected (Figure 4:
benign popular, p = 0.007; benign other, p = 0.018).
3.3. Thoracic surgery
The trend was gradually decreasing in all type of surgeries. Only prior year
comparison of benign surgeries was lower from March (supplemental Figure 2, 84.9%). ITS
analysis showed that the reduction of every type of surgical volume was not statistically
significant (Figure 4: lung cancer, p = 0.175; breast cancer, p = 0.311, benign surgery, p =
0.267).
3.4. Genitourinary surgery
The number of oncological surgeries and caesarean sections during March, April,
and May in 2020 did not show a significant decrease compared to the same months in the
previous year. In terms of benign surgeries, there was a slight downward trend in April and
May (supplemental Figure 3: benign popular, 92.4% in April and 75.9% in May; benign
other, 91.7% in April and 70.9% in May). ITS analysis showed a statistically significant
effect of COVID-19 only on other benign surgeries (Figure 4, p = 0.005).
3.5. Cardiovascular surgery
The number of surgeries for valve, aorta, CABG, and others gradually decreased
from April to a minimum in May (supplemental Figure 4: valve, 74.9%; aorta, 83.4%;
CABG, 71.2%; dialysis fistula, 81.9%, other, 62.6%). ITS analysis showed that only other
types of surgery were statistically significant (Figure 4, p = 0.026).
3.6. Neurosurgery
All type of surgeries had low numbers compared to the previous year in April and
May. Especially, May had the lowest percentage (supplemental Figure 5: cranial, 68.2%;

spine, 71.8%; other, 60.3%). On the other hand, only ITS analysis of intracranial surgery
showed a statistically significant decline (Figure 4; cranial, p = 0.043; spine, p = 0.262; other,
p = 0.053).
3.7. Orthopaedic surgery
All categories gradually decreased from April. Fracture-related surgery in May was
the lowest among all comparisons in this pandemic period (supplemental Figure 6:
fracture-related surgery, 60.6%; spine, 65.2%; other, 62.1%). All surgeries except
arthroplasty were statistically significant according to the ITS analysis (Figure 4:
fracture-related surgery, p = 0.002; arthroplasty, p = 0.062; other, p = 0.011).
3.8. Ophthalmologic surgery
Most forms of ophthalmic surgery were in the category of popular surgery. The
year-over-year trend of both popular and other type of surgery decreased from April,
especially in May (supplemental Figure 7: popular, 51.0%; other, 69.1%). Decline in both
types of surgery was significantly affected by COVID-19 (Figure 4: popular, p < 0.001; other,
p = 0.007).
3.9. Ear/Nose/Throat surgery
The trends of both popular and other types of surgery per month were similar, with
dramatic decreases in May (supplemental Figure 8: popular, 21.6%; other, 35.0%). Showing
the same trend as in the descriptive analysis, ITS analysis showed statistically significant
decrease in both surgical types (Figure 4: popular, p < 0.001; other, p < 0.001).
4. Discussion
Our study showed the trends of scheduled admission with surgery and important
changes in surgical volume during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. The main findings of
our study were as follows: first, we found the most affected practice was ENT surgery
according to the year-over-year trend; second, even within the same category, benign

surgeries that were considered non-critical tended to be significantly affected by the JSS’s
announcement of surgical triage due to COVID-19.
First, the decline of oncological surgeries for gastrointestinal, HPB, lung, breast,
and genitourinary cancer was not significant in the ITS analysis, even though there were
reductions when compared to the same period of the last year. For patients who had nonfatal
or did not require urgent medical intervention, JSS recommended postponement or
performing surgery cautiously under appropriate infection control.5 Because of the risk of
cancer-progression, prioritisation of procedures should consider available evidence on time
for surgery and oncologic outcomes.9,19,20 The American College of Surgeons also
recommended that surgery for low-risk cancer should be deferred but should not be
postponed for most other cancers.21 For example, our result for gastrointestinal cancer could
reflect the recommendation because we did not include endoscopic procedures, which were
usually performed for early stage cancer outside the operating room. However, our result for
prostate cancer showed no downward trend, which was opposite to urological triage
recommendations.22 This was probably because of the relatively affordability of hospital
beds recruited in this study and the patients’ wishes to perform the surgery as scheduled. In
terms of the benign abdominal, thoracic, and genitourinary surgeries, all but thoracic and
popular-genitourinary decreased with p < 0.05 in ITS analysis. In our dataset, the most
popular thoracic benign surgery was the video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for the
pneumothorax, and the most popular benign genitourinary was stone surgery. Both surgeries
have a high priority and are basically recommended to be performed without delay.5,9,22
Second, within cardiovascular surgery types, only other types of surgery obviously
decreased. During the COVID-19 pandemic, management of ICU beds and ventilators is
important. There is also concern about a remarkable reduction in blood donation because
many cardiovascular surgeries require perioperative transfusion.23,24 Considering the risk of
11

COVID-19 infection and conservation of medical resources, certain surgical restrictions,
such as delaying of surgery for stable patients or transferring a patient to near-by hospital,
are recommended for cardiac and aortic surgery by the Japanese Society for Cardiovascular
Surgery, as in western countries.25-27 However, cardiovascular surgery is thought to be
essential because of the risk of worsening or even death caused by surgical delay. For
example, progression from asymptomatic to symptomatic (typically chest pain or shortness
of breath) with valvular disease or aortic aneurysm can increase the risk of surgery, or even
worse, make surgery impossible. Similarly, if the appropriate timing of surgery for dialysis
fistula is missed, patient’s condition will become irreversible because of kidney failure.
When medical resources, such as hospital beds, staff, and ventilators can be afforded to a
certain extent, many cardiovascular surgeries should not be unnecessarily postponed, and
such a trend was also observed in this study.
Third, within neurosurgery, although every type declined compared to the same
period in the previous year, only intracranial surgery was significant with p < 0.05.
According to a report by Johns Hopkins University, the decrease rate of cranial surgery cases
was largest in the department of neurosurgery.28 Triage of elective neurosurgery was
basically judged by the symptoms, such as any signs of life-, limb- or vision-threatening
conditions.29 The Japan Neurosurgical Society also announced similar statements with only
an additional alert about endoscopic surgery.30 In this research, we chose surgeries for brain
tumour, intracranial haemorrhage, and intracranial vascular as cranial surgery based on their
popularity in the NDB. Because patients who underwent these surgeries after scheduled
admission might possibly have had trivial symptoms, our results could have been affected by
such selection effects. Spine surgery also decreased, although the ITS analysis was not
significant. The Japan Neurosurgical Society announced that spine surgery is intermediate or
high priory according to the symptoms.30 Patients who received spinal injury often suffered

from paralysis, which leads to decline in activities of daily living (ADL) or quality of life,
and the complaints of symptoms had possibly become more pronounced, which might have
led to our results.
Lastly, surgeries associated with quality of life such as orthopaedic, ophthalmologic,
and ENT surgeries were focused on. Traumatic surgery is one that requires minimising
preoperative delay and LOS despite a patient’s COVID-19 status at each hospital,9 although
whether surgery is performed with optimal timing or not should be decided in each hospital
based on restrictions on elective resources and procedures.31 Considering the necessity of
traumatic surgery such as fracture, surgical volume might have declined because of the state
of emergency declared by the government that led to people voluntarily refraining from
going out. Some arthroplasty cases were performed for fracture patients, although most of
them were for osteoarthritis. This might be because we selected only scheduled admission
patients. Osteoarthritis decreases ADL regardless of there being a state of emergency, which
could be related to our results. The Japanese Ophthalmological Society and
Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Society of Japan recommended cancellation or postponement of
most elective surgeries because of the high probability of the COVID-19 virus being present
in the nasal cavity, pharynx, and lacrimal fluid.32,33 Moreover, both ophthalmologists and
otolaryngologists are a high-risk category of COVID-19 infection because their daily
outpatient and emergent patients have a high volume. In our study, the reason for the
dramatic decrease in the surgical volume in otolaryngology and ophthalmology compared to
other surgical categories might be that patients themselves were reluctant to be seen and that
physicians in these two departments were strictly triaged by urgency.
Our study has several limitations. First, our target hospitals were 254 QIP
participant that voluntarily provided DPC data. This study population may not have been
comprehensive enough to be representative of the current situation in Japan because there
13

are more than 8000 hospitals in Japan. In this study, participant hospitals had a variety of
backgrounds and corona-positive patients were admitted in at least about half of the hospitals.
We believe that selection bias was not very significant, and this result was important for
understanding the future course of the pandemic. Second, we did not consider whether there
was a trend for surgery originally performed in an inpatient setting for ambulatory surgery
because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has
recommended that some inpatient surgeries should be shifted to ambulatory surgery when
possible and it is safe to do so, and the Ambulatory Surgery Center Association also cited the
recommendation because of the risk of infection for medical staff and patients and the
efficiency of medical resources.34 Ambulatory surgery centres need to be prepared for the
possibility of performing surgeries such as trauma and backlog surgeries that have never
been experienced before depending on how the COVID-19 pandemic develops in the future.
Finally, the ITS analysis was performed with DPC data based on the discharge date. The
state of emergency declared by the government and surgical triage by each hospital for the
COVID-19 pandemic would affect the date of admissions, not discharges. However, we
could only acquire the data of patients who were discharged by June 30, 2020. That is why
we separated the target population for descriptive analysis from that of ITS analysis. To
support our results, we added information about the median and inter-quartile range of LOS
that were varied from surgeries to the supplemental tables for ITS analysis.
In conclusion, we demonstrated and validated the trend of surgical volume
reduction in Japan, by applying ITS analyses. The most affected practice was ENT surgery,
especially popular surgeries, with declines of about 80%. Benign surgeries, except critical
procedures, tended to be significantly affected by COVID-19. Future research should
examine how hospitals recovered efficiently from the backlog of surgeries during this first
wave of the pandemic, using more recent administrative data, to prepare for the next possible
