Abstract

11

Objectives: We aimed to explore the frequencies of nasal symptoms in patients with COVID-19, including loss of smell and taste, as well as their

12

presentation as the first symptom of the disease and their association with the severity of COVID-19.

13

Methods: In this retrospective study, 1,206 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients were included and followed-up by telephone call one month

14

after discharged from Tongji Hospital, Wuhan. Demographic data, laboratory values, comorbidities, symptoms, and numerical rating scale scores

15

(0-10) of nasal symptoms were extracted from the hospital medical records, and confirmed or reevaluated by the telephone follow-up.

16

Results: From COVID-19 patients (N = 1,172) completing follow-up, 199 (17%) subjects had severe COVID-19 and 342 (29.2%) reported nasal

17

symptoms. The most common nasal symptom was loss of taste (20.6%, median score = 6), while 11.4% had loss of smell (median score = 5). The

18

incidence of nasal symptom including loss of smell and loss of taste as the first onset symptom was <1% in COVID-19 patients. Loss of smell or

19

taste scores showed no correlation with the scores of other nasal symptoms. Loss of taste scores, but not loss of smell scores, were significantly

20

increased in severe vs. non-severe COVID-19 patients. Interleukin (IL)-6 and lactose dehydrogenase (LDH) serum levels positively correlated with

21

loss of taste scores. About 80% of COVID-19 patients recovered from smell and taste dysfunction in 2 weeks.

22
23

Conclusion: In the Wuhan COVID-19 cohort, only 1 out of 10 hospital admitted patients had loss of smell while 1 out 5 reported loss of taste
which was associated to severity of COVID-19. Most patients recovered smell and taste dysfunctions in 2 weeks.

Impact of COVID-19 on smell and taste
44

Introduction

45

Last December 2019, a cluster of viral pneumonia cases identified as coronavirus disease 2019

46

(COVID-19), was reported in Wuhan, China. Subsequently, severe acute respiratory syndrome

47

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been identified to be the pathogenic cause of COVID-19 [1-3].

48

This newly recognized illness has spread rapidly throughout Wuhan (Hubei province) to allover

49

the world [4-6]. The diagnosis of the COVID-19 is based on clinical manifestations, contact history

50

report, chest computed tomography (CT) and positive result of nucleic acid test [7-9]. Due to the

51

uncertainty of contact history and the rush to hospitals that could run out of the essential equipment

52

for test during the world-wide pandemic, efforts to identify additional diagnostic or prognostic

53

symptoms of COVID-19 has significant value in mitigating transmission.

54

The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 ranges from asymptomatic to severe ill cases [1, 2, 6, 7,

55

10-12]. The most common symptom of COVID-19 is fever, and other common systemic symptoms

56

include dyspnea, cough, nausea and vomiting, etc [6, 7, 10]. In addition, olfactory and taste

57

disorder have been recently noted in patients with COVID-19. An early study conducted in Italy

58

reported 33.9% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients shown at least one taste or olfactory disorders

59

[13]. Later studies in Europe reported that about 75%-85% COVID-19 patients had olfactory

60

dysfunction and about 70%-88% patients had gustatory dysfunctions [14]. Very recently, similar

61

prevalence of smell and taste disorder has been found in COVID-19 patients in USA [15]. It is

62

indicated that smell or taste change may be a strong predictor for a COVID-19 positive test result

63

and may serve as an early alerting symptom for COVID-19 [16]. However, an early study based

64

on analyzing electronic medical records of 214 patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China reported

65

that the ratio of patients complaining of loss of taste and loss of smell was only 5.6% and 5.1%,

66

respectively [17], significantly lower than those reported in Europe and USA. One potential reason

Impact of COVID-19 on smell and taste
67

for the low ratios in China may be related to incomplete medical records of COVID-19 patients

68

under actual emergency situation, which underestimated the incidences of upper airway tract

69

manifestations. Nevertheless, it is also possible that there are different responses to SARS-CoV-

70

2 infection in people with distinct ethnic/culture background. Therefore, more accurate evaluation

71

of upper airway tract manifestations in COVID-19 patients should be conducted to figure out the

72

clinical importance of smell and taste dysfunction in the early diagnosis of COVID-19 for Chinese

73

and to elucidate whether there are different clinical manifestations between patients with distinct

74

ethnic/culture background. Moreover, several important questions remain to be answered. How

75

severe are the upper airway tract symptoms in patients with COVID-19? Is there any correlation

76

between olfactory and taste disorders and other nasal symptoms such as nasal obstruction? Will

77

the severity of olfactory or taste disorder be associated with the severity of COVID-19? Will there

78

be a full recovery of olfactory or taste disorder and how long it will take?

79

In this retrospective study, we investigated the COVID-19 patients discharged from Tongji

80

Hospital, the largest designated hospital to treat patients with COVID-19, in Wuhan. Integrating

81

medical record analysis and reevaluation of upper airway symptoms by the telephone follow-up,

82

we aimed to explore the frequencies of nasal symptoms in patients with COVID-19, including loss

83

of smell and taste, as well as their presentation as the first symptom of the disease and their

84

association with the severity of COVID-19.

Impact of COVID-19 on smell and taste
88

A single center, retrospective cohort study was conducted in Wuhan, China, where COVID-

89

19 initially outbroke. We obtained the electronic medical records for discharged COVID-19

90

patients between January 27, 2020 and March 10, 2020, who initially admitted to the Tongji

91

Hospital. The diagnosis was made on the basis of guidance for diagnosis and management of

92

COVID-19 released by WHO [3]. A laboratory-confirmed case of COVID-19 was defined as

93

having positive result on real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assay of nasal

94

and pharyngeal swab specimens. Only laboratory-confirmed cases were included in the study. All

95

patients were followed up by telephone on the 30th (±2) day after discharge. The study was

96

approved by Tongji Hospital Research Ethics Committee.

Clinical characteristic, laboratory assessment, and telephone follow-up

99

The degree of severity of COVID-19 was defined as severe and non-severe at the time of

100

admission using the American Thoracic Society guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia

101

[18]. The information of demographic characteristics, systemic major symptoms, and major

102

commodities related to COVID-19 were extracted from electronic medical records. In addition,

103

the results of laboratory assessments on admission were also collected from electronic medical

104

records. All laboratory testing was performed according to the clinical care needs of the patients.

105

Laboratory assessments consisted of a complete blood routine, blood biochemistry, coagulation

106

function, infection biomarkers and immune function. All data were entered into a computerized

107

database and cross-checked.

108

The airway comorbidities and nasal symptoms, the date of symptomatic onset, and numerical

109

rating scale scores and duration days of symptoms were obtained based on the hospital medical

records and were confirmed and reevaluated by the telephone follow-up. The severity of upper

111

respiratory tract symptoms was scored by patients on a numerical rating scale of 0-10, with 0 being

112

“no complaint whatsoever” and 10 being “the worst imaginable complaint” [19, 20]. Six major

113

symptoms of upper respiratory tract were focused on: nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, nasal itching,

114

sneezing, loss of smell, and loss of taste. The severity of loss of smell and loss of taste was defined

115

as follows: Mild = score 0-3; Moderate= score 4-7; Severe = score 8-10 [19, 20]. The difference

116

between the symptom of loss of smell and loss of taste was explained to the patients very carefully

117

during telephone follow-up according to previous studies [21, 22]. The detailed questionnaire

118

showed in this article’s Online Supplement.

120

Statistical Analysis

121

For continuous variables, Mann-Whitney U 2-tailed test was used for between-group

122

comparison. Chi-square test was applied to compare the difference in proportions between groups.

123

Spearman test was used for correlation analysis. Difference was considered to be statistically

124

significant if a P value was less than 0.05. These statistical analyses were performed by using an

125

IBM SPSS 22.0 package (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL).

reasons (n = 23); unable to provide accurate information (n = 6); phone calls were not answered

132

(n = 5). The demographic and clinical characteristics of 1,172 patients are shown in Table 1. The

133

median age was 61 years (IQR, 48-68), and 577 (49.2%) were men. The ratio of severe cases was

134

17% (199/1172).

135

Of the 1172 cases, 399 (25.1%) reported with at least one comorbidity, and 17.3% having one

136

or more respiratory comorbidities, including allergic rhinitis (AR, 9.8%), chronic rhinosinusitis

137

(CRS, 6.1%), asthma (2.5%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, 0.9%). The

138

frequency of patients with at least one nasal symptom was up to 29.2%, including nasal obstruction

139

(8.6%; median score, 3), rhinorrhea (10.3%; median score, 3), nasal itching (4.9%; median score,

140

2), sneezing (11.0%; median score, 2), loss of smell (11.4%; median score, 5), and loss of taste

141

(20.6%; median score, 6). The incidence of symptom reported as the first onset symptom was <

142

1% for each individual nasal symptom, including loss of smell and taste. No difference in

143

frequency of patients with loss of smell or taste disorder was found between severe and non-severe

144

COVID-19 cases (Fig 1, A). The scores of loss of taste but not smell were significantly higher in

145

the patients with severe vs. non-severe COVID-19 (7 [5- 9] vs. 6 [4- 8]; P = 0.03) (Fig 1, B). No

146

difference in frequency or score for the other nasal symptoms was found between severe and non-

147

severe disease. The data is shown in Table 1 and Fig 1.

148

Sense of smell and taste are determined by the chemosensory system of the upper respiratory

149

tract, which could be impacted by the nasal dysfunction [22]. Hence, we analyzed the relations

150

between the scores of loss of taste and smell and other nasal symptoms. We failed to find any

151

correlation between loss of taste or loss of smell scores and scores of the other nasal symptoms

152

(Fig E1 in the Online Supplement). However, loss of taste showed mild positive correlation with

153

loss of sense of smell (ρ = 0.25, P < 0.01) (Fig E1 in the Online Supplement).

Impact of COVID-19 on smell and taste
154

Given the possibility that some patients might not well distinguish the taste and smell disorder

155

[21, 22], we compared the differences among the patients only with one smell or taste disorder,

156

the patients with both smell and taste disorder, and the patients without any of these two symptoms.

157

We found that the patients without loss of smell and taste were significant elder than the patients

158

in the other two groups (62 [48-69] years vs 59 [46-67] years, 57.5 [42.75-66] years, P = 0.03).

159

No other difference of clinical characteristics and laboratory measurements was found among the

160

patients in three groups. The data is shown in Table E1 in the Online Supplement.

161
162

The recovery of olfactory and taste function

163

We found that 82.1% (110/134) of patients with loss of sense of smell and 95.5% (231/242)

164

of patients with loss of taste recovered in one month after discharge. The symptomatic duration

165

days showed no difference between the patients with loss of smell and taste (8 [6-13.25] vs 7 [5-

166

14] days, P = 0.52) (Fig 1, C). Most of them recovered in 14 days after onset of symptom (Fig 1,

167

D). No difference in recovery frequency of smell function was found between severe (83.3%) and

168

non-severe cases (81.8%) (P = 0.99) (Table 1). As to taste disorder, 95.3% patients with severe

169

COVID-19 and 95.5% patients with non-severe COVID-19 recovered, and no difference showed

170

neither (P = 0.99) (Table 1). The data is also shown in Table 1. Due to the limited number of

171

patients with unrecovered symptoms, we did not compare the differences between recovered and

172

unrecovered patients with loss of smell or loss of taste.

Impact of COVID-19 on smell and taste
174

Clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with different severity of taste and smell

175

disorder

176

Since the taste disorder was the most common upper respiratory tract symptoms and showed

177

positive correlation to the symptom of loss of smell, we subsequently compared the differences

178

among the COVID-19 patients with different severity of loss of taste (Table 2) and loss of smell

179

(Table 3). First, we divided 242 COVID-19 cases with loss of taste into mild (score, 1-3; 19.0%),

180

moderate (score, 4-7; 48.8%) and severe (score, 8-10; 32.2%) group by symptom scores, similar

181

to the visual analogue scale system of nasal symptoms [19, 20]. More COVID-19 cases with severe

182

illness were found in the severe loss of taste group than in the moderate loss of taste group (26.9%

183

vs 12.7%, P = 0.03). The symptom duration of loss of taste was significantly longer in moderate

184

and severe taste dysfunction group as compared to the mild taste dysfunction group (8 days [6-

185

13.25], 10 days [5-15] vs 5 days [3.5-8], P < 0.01) (Fig 2). In addition, serum levels of interleukin-

186

6 (IL-6) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were significantly increased in patients with severe

187

compared to mild and moderate loss of taste group (Table 2). Levels of IL-8 were significantly

188

increased in severe and moderate compared to mild loss of taste group (Table 2). The

189

characteristics of the patients with different severity of taste disorder are shown in Table 2. In

190

addition, IL-6 and LDH showed mild positive correlations to the symptom scores of loss of taste

191

(ρ = 0.15, P = 0.03; ρ = 0.21, P < 0.01, respectively; Fig 3).

192

As to the comparison among different severity of loss of smell, we divided the 134 patients

193

with loss of sense of smell into mild (score, 1-3, 23.9%), moderate (score, 4-7; 35.8%) and severe

194

(score, 8-10; 40.3%) group. No prominent difference in clinical and laboratory measurements was

195

found among the patients with different severity (Table 3 and Fig 2).

Impact of COVID-19 on smell and taste
196

Discussion

197

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on detailed information of manifestations

198

of the upper respiratory tract of the hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in China. We reported

199

the manifestations of upper respiratory tract in a cohort of 1,172 patients with laboratory-

200

confirmed COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. Overall, 17% subjects were categorized as severe

201

COVID-19, this percentage being similar with previous reports from China [7, 10]. Most of the

202

common systemic signs and symptoms of disease such as fever, fatigue, and anorexia, etc. reported

203

in previous studies were also observed in our cohort [2, 7, 10]. Nevertheless, under urgent

204

admission of COVID-19 patients, compared to systemic symptoms and comorbidities, nasal

205

symptoms and upper airway comorbidities were very likely incompletely documented and

206

underestimated in previous studies based on medical record analysis [7, 23]. In order to overcome

207

this limitation in real-world setting, we did recalled questionnaires by phone call to reevaluate the

208

presence of airway comorbidities, and frequency and severity of nasal symptoms. As a result, the

209

frequencies of COVID-19 patients with AR and CRS were 9.8% and 6.1%, respectively. Previous

210

studies have reported that adult AR and CRS in general population in China were 17.6% and 8%,

211

respectively, these being higher than the reported for COVID-19 [24, 25]. Recent studies indicate

212

that the increasing eosinophils may be an indicator of COVID-19 improvement [26, 27]. Hence,

213

we cannot rule out the possibility that the comorbidities of allergic and eosinophilic diseases such

214

as AR might be potential protective factors for severe COVID-19.

215

Here, we found that upper respiratory tract symptoms were identified in 29.2% patients with

216

COVID-19, with nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, nasal itching and sneezing presenting in

217

mild/moderate severity and loss of smell and taste presenting in moderate/severe severity. All of

218

these upper respiratory tract symptoms have been commonly reported in other respiratory viral

Impact of COVID-19 on smell and taste
219

infection, such as influenza and rhinovirus [28-30]. Our data suggest that similar with the common

220

respiratory virtues, SARS-CoV-2 may be able to infect upper respiratory tract mucosa and cause

221

similar symptoms [22, 29, 31]. In addition, the result in our Wuhan cohort revealed that the self-

222

reported symptoms of upper respiratory tract were not the first symptom in most COVID-19

223

patients, doubting the diagnostic value of these symptoms preceding the onset of full-blown

224

clinical disease. However, our study only included hospitalized COVID-19 patients while the

225

clinical manifestations of COVID-19 can range from asymptomatic infection to severe pneumonia

226

[2, 7, 32]. Further investigations on non-hospitalized infected patients and patients with likely

227

sudden onset anosmia will help to determine the role of upper airway symptoms, particular loss of

228

smell and taste, as a screening tool for COVID-19.

229

Interestingly, the loss of taste and smell were the most common upper respiratory tract

230

symptoms observed in COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, with 17.5% patients having only smell or

231

taste disorder and 7.3% patients having both symptoms. By integrating medical record analysis

232

and follow-up confirmation and reevaluation after discharge, we reported higher rates of smell and

233

taste disorder in the hospitalized patients than an early report from Wuhan, which relied on medical

234

record analysis only and had a smaller sample size [17]. However, the rates of smell and taste

235

disorder in our cohort were much lower than those reported in Europe and America [13-16, 33]. It

236

may be related to the different characteristics of COVID-19 patients. In our study, asymptomatic

237

patients and non-hospitalized patients with mild symptoms were not included. It is also likely that

238

people with distinct ethnic/culture background may have different response to SARS-CoV-2

239

infection. Previously, no large-sample-size investigation of olfactory and taste disorder in the

240

disease caused by either SARS-CoV-1 or middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus, that

241

belongs to the same family of coronaviruses, was undertaken. A case report revealed the olfactory

Impact of COVID-19 on smell and taste
242

disorder in a patient infected with SARS- CoV-1 [34]. Nevertheless, olfactory and taste disorders

243

are well known to be widely associated with a number of viral infections [35, 36]. The frequency

244

of patients with loss of smell in the present study was similar to that of post-viral olfactory

245

dysfunction (PVOD) caused by the common respiratory virus, such as influenza with a ratio of

246

about 17% [29, 31]. PVOD can be caused by mechanical obstruction of odorant transmission due

247

to edema of nasal mucosa, and/or the inflammatory impairment of the olfactory neuroepithelium

248

and even central nervous systems [22, 31, 37, 38]. We found that the scores of taste and smell

249

dysfunction showed no correlation with the scores of the other nasal symptoms including nasal

250

obstruction, disfavoring a role of mechanical obstruction in the dysfunction of smell and taste. In

251

fact, the symptom scores indicate that COVID-19 patients suffer from mild/moderate nasal

252

obstruction and rhinorrhea, despite moderate/severe olfactory and taste disorder. SARS-CoV-1 has

253

demonstrated a transneural penetration through the olfactory bulb in mice model [39]. Angiotensin

254

converting enzyme 2, which is used by SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 to invade the host cells,

255

is widely expressed on the epithelial cells in nasal and oral cavity [40, 41]. These evidence suggest

256

a neurological involvement in smell and taste disorder caused by SARS- CoV-2 infection. In this

257

study, COVID-19 patients with severe illness had more severe taste disorder. In addition, serum

258

levels of IL-6, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, were elevated in patients with severe taste disorder,

259

and positively correlated with the loss of taste scores. Previous studies demonstrated that the pro-

260

inflammatory cytokines were able to impair the function of taste buds directly, thus leading to taste

261

dysfunction [42, 43].

262

The present study revealed that 95.5% patients with loss of taste and 82.1% patients with loss

263

of smell recovered spontaneously, and most of them in 2-week time, although the severe

264

impairment of olfactory and smell function may lead to delayed recovery. The spontaneous

Impact of COVID-19 on smell and taste
265

recovery may be a result of regeneration of the damaged olfactory epithelium and taste buds [44].

266

Previously, oral and topical corticosteroids have been proposed to treat viral-associated olfactory

267

loss. However, systemic corticosteroids may impair the viral clearance. Given to the high rate of

268

spontaneous recovery of olfactory and taste function, it seems that there is no need to use

269

corticosteroids for treating olfactory and smell disorder in patients with COVID-19, although their

270

administration can be continued to treat comorbidities such as AR and CRS [45].

271

We have to acknowledge that there are several limitations of this study. First, the self-reported

272

and recalled symptoms and comorbidities without diagnostic testing, especially for the

273

symptomatic information of loss of smell and taste obtained over a month after onset, might

274

contribute to under- or over- estimation of the prevalence of these symptoms, and the strength of

275

association with the clinical outcomes. Second, the self-report and questionnaire-based evaluation

276

could not clearly discriminate the symptoms of loss of smell and taste in patients with COVID-19.

277

It is the inherent limitation of the study based on self-reported data. Three, it was impossible to

278

include the fatal cases due to the incomplete medical records regarding upper airway symptoms

279

and comorbidities, and impossible telephone recall. Fourth, asymptomatic patients and non-

280

hospitalized patients with mild symptoms were missed in this study. Fifth, we cannot preclude the

281

influence of AR and CRS comorbidity on the presentation of upper airway symptoms during

282

COVID-19. However, most of our patients claimed that their primary AR or CRS were under

283

control at baseline and we found no difference in upper airway symptoms between patients with

284

and without AR or CRS comorbidity (data not shown).

Impact of COVID-19 on smell and taste
287

To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest retrospective cohort study focusing on the

288

symptoms of upper respiratory tract in patients with COVID-19 in China. We found that nearly

289

one third of COVID-19 patients got the upper respiratory tract symptoms. Loss of smell affected

290

one out of ten patients with COVID-19 while loss of taste was the most common upper respiratory

291

tract symptom affecting one out of five patients, being associated with the severity of COVID-19

292

infection. Finally, about 80% of patients spontaneously recovered from olfactory and taste

293

dysfunction in a short term of 2 weeks.

Figure 1. The impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on smell and taste. (A) The

476

prevalence of self-reported loss of smell and taste in severe and non-severe COVID-19 patients.

477

The frequencies are indicated on the top of the columns. (B) The severity of self-reported loss of

478

smell and taste in severe and non-severe COVID-19 patients. Severity of self-reported loss of

479

smell and taste symptom was scored by patients on a numerical rating scale of 0-10, with 0 being

480

“no complaint whatsoever” and 10 being “the worst imaginable complaint. (C) The recovery

481

time of self-reported smell and state dysfunction in severe and non-severe COVID-19 patients.

482

(D) The pattern of recovery time for patients with self-reported loss of smell and taste. The

483

frequencies are indicated on the tope of columns. * P < 0.05 compared to non-severe COVID-19.

Figure 2. The recovery time of patients with different severity of loss of smell and loss of

486

taste. Severity of self-reported loss of smell and taste symptom was scored by patients on a

487

numerical rating scale of 0-10, with 0 being “no complaint whatsoever” and 10 being “the worst

488

imaginable complaint. ** P < 0.01 compared to mild loss of taste.

Figure 3. Correlations between loss of taste scores and serum levels of IL-6 (A), IL-8 (B),

491

lactose dehydrogenase (LDH) (C). Severity of self-reported loss of taste was scored by patients

492

on a numerical rating scale of 0-10, with 0 being “no complaint whatsoever” and 10 being “the

493

worst imaginable complaint.
