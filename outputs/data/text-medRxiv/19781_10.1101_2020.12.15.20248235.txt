Abstract
Objectives: Video consultations (VCs) have been rapidly implemented in response to Covid-19.

However, limited research has explored patient experiences of VCs in this context. This research
therefore explored patient experiences of VCs during their early stages of implementation in
response to Covid-19.
Design: Secondary data analysis of routine patient survey responses using descriptive statistics and
inductive thematic analysis.
Setting and participants: 955 (22.6%) survey responses following a VC using Attend Anywhere in a
rural, aging and outpatient care setting between June and July 2020.
Results: Most (93.2%) respondents reported having ‘good’ (n=210, 22.0%), or ‘very good’ (n=680,
71.2%) experiences with VCs. Most respondents accessed their VC alone (n=806, 84.4%), except for
those aged 71+ (n=23/58, 39.7%). Most participants reported feeling listened to and understood
(n=904, 94.7%), felt their needs had been met (n=860, 90.1%) and were able to communicate
everything they wanted (n=848, 88.8%). Satisfaction with communication was very strongly
associated with satisfaction with the technical performance of the VC (p<0.001).
Free text responses had three key themes: i) barriers to VC use including technological difficulties,
quality of patient information and accessibility or suitability concerns; ii) potential benefits including
reduced stress and anxiety, enhanced accessibility, cost and time savings; and iii) patient suggested
improvements including trial calls, turning music off, facilitating photo uploads, expanding written
character limit and supporting other internet browsers. Most (92.1%) participants were likely to
choose a VC again in the future.
Conclusions: The vast majority of respondents reported positive experiences of VCs. Identified
benefits of enhanced accessibility, affordability, time, monetary and environmental savings are
particularly interesting for future service delivery. Further research is needed, using rapid co-design

Introduction

COVID-19 is a global health concern (1) that has resulted in the rapid implementation and
digitalisation of many healthcare services (2, 3). As a result, the use of video consultations (VCs), a
form of telemedicine also referred to as remote or virtual consultations (4), now forms an integral
part of both primary and outpatient (ambulatory) care delivery. While limiting viral exposure and
reducing the potential risk of infection for both patients and staff (4, 5), video consultations may
enable additional visual cues beyond the capabilities of telephone consultations, helping to facilitate
the therapeutic relationship and experiences of care delivery (2). However, despite extensive
guidance and advice on how to deliver video consultations (6, 7, 8), research exploring patient
experiences of video consultations in response to Covid-19 is arguably limited (4, 9, 10).
Isautier et al. (9) have recently published results of an online survey conducted in Australia, seeking
to compare patient experience of in-person consultations with telehealth, which they define as
appointments with a healthcare provider via video or phone. The majority (369/596, 61.9%) felt
their telehealth experience was as good, or better, than in-person appointments, with respondents
believing telehealth would be moderately to very useful after Covid-19 restrictions end. The majority
of telehealth reported on referred to telephone calls (427, 71.6%), rather than video calls (84,
14.1%), while some patients reported using both (85, 14.3%). While experience was generally
positive, free text comments suggested technology limitations, impaired communication compared
to face-to-face, issues obtaining prescriptions or results, reduced confidence in doctors, additional
burden and lack of physical examination as reasons for poor perceptions of VC.
Recent research by Gilbert et al. (4), provides some insight into the use of VCs in an orthopaedic and
urban outpatient setting in the UK. Following a satisfaction questionnaire completed by 104 patients
and 51 clinicians, survey respondents indicated high levels of satisfaction for telephone (M patient
satisfaction = 90/100, no data for clinicians) and VCs (M patient satisfaction = 85/100, M clinician
satisfaction = 78/100). Potential benefits of VCs identified by Gilbert et al. (4), included reduced
travel, waiting times and impact of travel on severity of symptoms such as fatigue. Conversely, low
levels of reported satisfaction with VCs often related to variable sound or picture quality, low
confidence in technology use and limited set-up support. Despite high levels of satisfaction overall,
participants in the Gilbert et al. (4) study were more likely to consider a future phone consultation
after a phone appointment (94%) than a VC after a video appointment (36%).
Kayser et al. (10), have also reported on 53 lung-transplant patients receiving VCs during the
pandemic, demonstrating general patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes of consultations,
although limited data is reported on patient experience of the VC.
While the early insights provided by Isautier et al. (9) and Gilbert et al. (4) are beneficial, further
research with a larger cohort of VC patients from a range of health care services would be of value to
further develop existing knowledge and understanding of this rapidly evolving area. Furthermore,
following the rapid implementation of VCs meaning usual implementation time-frames reduced
from years, to months, or in some cases days (11), there may be important learning points that could
help facilitate the sustainability of VCs beyond Covid-19 restrictions and the implementation of
similar technologies more broadly. Moreover, previous literature exploring the use of VCs conducted
prior to the pandemic is arguably now outdated following changes made as a result of Covid-19 (7).
Finally, exploring patient experiences of video consultations in a generally aging, rural and deprived
region, as we have here, may provide important insights into future digital healthcare interventions
and implementations given the aging population on a national scale (12). Research exploring the use
of VCs in this rapidly evolving context is therefore justified given the increasing recognition between
patient experience and quality improvement opportunities (13).

In summary, this research responds to an identified need to evaluate rapid technology
implementations during the pandemic (14) by exploring patient experiences of Attend Anywhere (a
telemedicine platform for outpatient care) (15, 16), in Europe’s second most deprived setting –
Cornwall. Cornwall and the Isle of Scilly (CIoS) is a geographically isolated peninsula in the South
West of England that experiences higher than average levels of deprivation, further to 40% of the
Cornish population living in remote areas (17). Additionally, CIoS has an older age profile (18), with a
single acute hospital located in the centre of the county. The question that this research sought to
address was as follows:
•

How do patients experience video consultations for outpatient services during the Covid-19
pandemic?

Research findings contribute to the emerging field of health and care changes as a result of Covid-19
and have important implications for policy, practice and future research as later described.
Methods
Design

Secondary analysis of routinely collected anonymised patient responses to a post-VC survey
designed and distributed by the partner health care provider (Trust).
Setting

Outpatient care in a rural area in Southwest England with older population, during the early
implementation of VCs in response to COVID-19 (June 1st – July 31st 2020). The implementation
process followed guidance provided by NHS England and NHS Improvement (19). The outpatient
setting provides services across adult mental health, children’s and adolescent mental health and
physical health, including but not limited to; learning disabilities, cardiac services, bladder and
bowel, complex care and dementia, eating disorders, personality disorders, psychiatric liaison,
palliative care, stroke nursing, speech and language therapy, diabetes, epilepsy, minor injuries,
musculoskeletal, neuro-rehabilitation, physiotherapy, podiatry and respiratory nursing.
The Trust started to use Attend Anywhere from 6th April 2020. Some appointments were still carried
out face-to-face but many patients were offered video-consultation or telephone contact during the
study period. There were 4234 completed Attend Anywhere appointments between 1st June 2020
and 31st July 2020. The patient feedback data used in this study was from 955 out of the 4234
completed video-consultations.
Participants

All patients were invited immediately after receiving a VC to complete an online survey. Participation
was voluntary and participants were either patients or their carers. Survey respondents gave
consent for their data to be used but some chose to not have comments quoted verbatim.
Data Collection

Data were collected by the Trust using an online survey. The survey (appendix A) was developed by
the Trust based on the standardised patient feedback survey questions provided in the national
guidance (19). To our knowledge, the survey was not designed with patient or public involvement
due to the rapid implementation process. The rapid rollout of this feedback process may also be
responsible for some limitations of the survey itself, including limitations in response options (for
example the slightly odd age groups used) and understanding of the sample (for example, number of
unique individuals and service accessed by patient). However, we have confidence that the data
items we have used in our analysis are robust.

Data Analysis

Descriptive statistics are reported for numerical data. Free-text responses were analysed by three
researchers using inductive thematic analysis as outlined by Braun and Clarke (20). A comprehensive
coding framework was developed by the authors by reviewing survey responses on a line by line
basis comparing initial thoughts, ideas and theme definitions. The resulting framework was then
used to individually analyse survey responses comparing emerging themes across the data set to
determine dominant themes. Thematic analysis was selected for the purposes of this research as it is
advocated as a useful and flexible method to generate a rich, yet detailed and complex account of
qualitative data (20). Adopting an inductive approach also helped to ensure identified themes arose
from the data generated, as opposed to predefined concepts or ideas. Data saturation was defined
as the point at which no new generic themes or variations of a given theme emerged (21).
Qualitative analysis was supported through the use of NVIVO software.
Patient and public involvement

This study focuses on patient experiences of video consultations. The research question and study
has therefore been informed by patient input including analysis of data, reviewing and co-authoring
of the manuscript. Findings from this research have also been presented in partnership with a
service-user consultant at an Experiences of Care Collaborative (ECCo) meeting within the Trust and
other, more external facing co-designed dissemination activities. The service-user consultant will be
instrumental in shaping and implementing some of the suggested solutions helping to ensure
continued involvement.
Ethics

Ethical approval to conduct this secondary analysis and complete further primary data collection was
attained from the Health Research Authority (HRA) and Health and Care Research Wales (HCRW),
IRAS ID 286543.
This manuscript has been prepared using SQUIRE reporting guidelines (22).

Results
Patient age and device use

Just under a quarter (955, 22.6%) of 4234 patient VCs resulted in feedback responses. As the data
are anonymous it was not possible to know if some individuals had completed the survey more than
once in this two month period. Our data are therefore episodes rather than individuals. The highest
number of responses was received from the 31-50 year age group (n=333, 34.8%). The lowest
number of responses was received from patients aged over 71 (n=58, 6.1%).
Half the patients used a laptop to access their VC (n=487, 50.9%). Device use varied by age (χ2= 68.9;
12df; p<.001). People aged over 50 were much less likely to use mobiles and more likely to use
tablets. The 51-71 age group were more likely to use ‘other’ (probably desk top computers).

Quantitative analysis
Overall experience and future intention

Most (n=890, 93.2%) patients reported having a ‘good’ (n=210, 22.0%), or ‘very good’ (n=680, 71.2%)
overall experience of VC. A small number of respondents had a ‘poor’ (n=13, 1.4%), or ‘very poor’
experience (n=17, 1.8%). Future intention is also a measure of satisfaction with VC; nine out of ten
respondents were ‘very likely’ (n=704, 73.7%) or ‘somewhat likely’ (n=176, 18.4%) to choose a VC in
the future. Very few respondents (n=28, 2.9%) suggested they were ‘somewhat unlikely’ (n=17,
1.8%) or ‘very unlikely’ (n=11, 1.2%) to use VCs in the future. We are able to look at two aspects of
overall satisfaction: satisfaction with the technology (video and sound) and satisfaction with the
communication (more related to the clinician’s performance in this situation).
Technical satisfaction

Three-quarters of patients had a ‘very positive’ experience of sound and video quality (n=732,
76.6%, n=728, 76.2% respectively). When combined 67.6% (646) had a very positive experience of
both video and sound (Table 2).
Satisfaction with communication

The vast majority of patients felt they had been listened to and understood (n=904, 94.7%); had had
their needs met (n=860, 90.1%) and felt they had been able to communicate everything they
wanted, although to a slightly lesser extent (n=848, 88.8%). Overall 85.7% (818) rated all three
aspects positively (Table 2).
Association between satisfaction with technology and communication

Satisfaction with communication was very strongly associated with satisfaction with the technical
performance (χ2=104.0; df=1; p<0.001) (Table 3). Only 41/955 people were less satisfied with the
communication despite being satisfied with the technology. On the other hand, 213/955 remained
positive about the communication despite being less positive about the technology.

Influence of age and device on outcome

Age was significantly associated with satisfaction with the technical experience, though interestingly
satisfaction with audio and video was lowest in the under 30s and highest in the over 71s (Table 2).
On the other hand older people were more likely to use laptops and ‘other’ (Table 1) while mobile
and tablet users had better technical experience (Table 2). This seemed rather contradictory
indicating some interaction between age and device, so we explored this further (Appendix B).
People aged 30 and under were less likely to be positive about the technical experience, particularly
those that used tablets. Those in the 31-71 age groups who used laptops or ‘other’ were less likely to
be positive about the technology. The over 71s were more positive about the technology
performance.

Independence and accessibility

Most (806, 84.4%) respondents stated that they could access their VC alone. However, more
respondents over the age of 71 reported needing help (n=35/58, 60.3%) than those who could
access their VC alone (n=23/58, 39.7%). This was the only age group to report such results, with
most patients in other age groups able to access the VC alone (range 79.8%-95.2%).

Most participants reported that it was ‘very easy’ or ‘easy’ to join the VC call (n=849, 88.9%), but this
was strongly associated with age with 92.6% (286) of those under 31 reducing to 69.0% (40) of the
over 71s (χ2=28.6, 3df, p<0.001).
Perceived savings

Two thirds of patients reported a perceived saving in time (n=662, 69.3%) and more than half saving
money (n=544, 59.9%). There was no difference by age.
Qualitative Results

Twelve percent (119/955) people made 1384 free text comments in response to one or more of 16
questions. People who rated their overall experience good or very good were much less likely to
comment about their overall satisfaction (11.8% Vs 43.1%, p<0.001).
Inductive thematic analysis of free text responses identified three main themes: barriers, benefits
and patient suggested improvements. Each theme and their corresponding sub-themes are

Many participants identified concerns of connectivity, “platform glitches” (unique identifier, P94) or
experienced delays between video and sound. For example, “the picture kept freezing and
pixelating” (P741); “the video quality is so poor it’s really hard to get much done” (P332). Similarly,
“the connection was awful and so did not work for speech therapy” (P888). Experiences of “platform
glitches” appeared to have important implications for the perceived quality of consultations. In some
cases, technical difficulties meant patients felt that their “needs were not met” (P305), i.e. “couldn’t
continue the call due to technical issues” (P663).
Quality of Patient Information and Support

The quality of patient information, particularly joining instructions was also repeatedly called into
question by survey respondents. One participant described the joining process as “stupidly complex”
(P52). Others described being “directed to a troubleshooting, jargon filled, suggestions page” (P95).
The complexity of language used in these documents was described by the same participant as not
“good enough” (P95).
The accuracy of joining instructions was also questioned by some participants; “the link doesn’t open
as the instructions [suggest]” (P236). Similarly, “the link […] sent in the instructions did not work”
(P863). Although a video version of the information was provided, this was described by participants
as in need of further development and refinement to ensure inclusivity, particularly for “deaf
patients” (P582).
Furthermore, some participants reported admin or clinician errors. Although seemingly rare, such
errors often impaired patient access and subsequent experience. For example, “no link [was] sent”
(P12); “was not able to join […] not sure which link” (P215), there was “a mix up with admin about
time of appointment” (P12). One participant appeared to receive no answer - “unfortunately there
was no answer after an hour…pleased this waiting time was at home and didn’t involve a wasted
journey”

(P573).

Access to relevant devices, browsers, digital skills and/or confidence were also described as
problematic by some participants. For example, “unfortunately I was not up to date with technology”
(P319). Some participants reported needing to download alterative browsers or borrow other
people’s devices due to “outdated” (P671) models. Similar to the quantitative findings presented
above, some participants reported needing help from family members or friends to support their VC
use. Such support appeared to be vital “without [them] it would have been impossible” (P540).
Another “96 year old had to pay for a carer to be present [and] 2 hours of IT help from someone else”
(P47).
Suitability concerns

Some participants suggested face-to-face appointments may be better suited for certain individuals
or conditions. For example, individuals who rely on lip reading suggested that “face to face is easier”
(P457) due to encountered video and sound delays. Character limitations in the VC chat function was
also reported as unhelpful by some participants. Finally, some patients suggested that physical, or
mobility examinations may be better suited for face-to-face consultations, although this conclusion
was not unanimous. Further exploration of which settings and conditions VCs may be most
acceptable and appropriate for could be beneficial.

Interestingly no participants described the therapeutic relationship or quality of care delivered by
individual healthcare professionals as a barrier or limitation of VC use. This may reflect the questions
asked in the survey but is an interesting point to consider.
Perceived benefits

In contrast to perceived barriers, participants described a number of benefits to VC use. The majority
of respondents repeatedly described their VC experience as “fantastic,” “excellent,” “amazing,”
“wonderful,” “positive” and “useful” (P558, P579, P153, P863, P600, P667) . Participants also
appeared to appreciate being able to have “family members join the appointment” (P15). One
participant also reported enjoying seeing “a friendly face who understood my needs” (P474),
identifying a potential benefit over and above alternative methods of remote consultation such as
telephone calls.
Less stressful and anxious experience

Other benefits frequently described by participants included a less anxious and “far less stressful”
(P796) experience. Several participants reported feeling “more relaxed” (P563) and less “rushed”
(P392) as a result of avoiding certain stressors including arranging transport, arriving on time, finding
and paying for parking and avoiding traffic. A reduction in anxiety and stress was also reported
among children, particularly for children who experienced anxiety about appointments or leaving
the house.
Enhanced comfort and ability to disclose personal/clinically relevant information

Some participants suggested that the removal of “so much stress” (P290) meant that they had “more
time to focus on what needs [needed] talking through” (P290). Several participants suggested that
because they “didn’t feel so stressed” (P695) and were in the comfort of their “own home” (P564),
they were “able to open up more” (P695) often feeling more “comfortable” and “relaxed” (P564).
Personal savings

Other benefits described by participants included time, monetary and environmental savings.
Some patients reported saving “over £20 in transportation costs” (P98), others reported “this has
been a crucial saving, not only in time and money but also stress, as I would have had to rely on
public transport […] around 5 hours [of] travel” (P895). Perceptions of now being able to ‘afford’ an
appointment as a result of these time and cost savings were repeatedly referred to by some
participants. For example, video consultations “have genuinely changed my life, […] being accessible
for my needs and being able to afford an appointment” (P153). Travel and cost savings may be
particularly prevalent in “Cornwall” where it “is always difficult to travel for appointments” (P262).

Enhanced accessibility

Although some individuals described reduced accessibility as previously described, the majority of
free text responses suggested VCs facilitated service accessibility in a number ways. Firstly, due to
certain conditions and reduced mobility, some respondents found “trips to the hospital very tiring
and difficult” (P20). VCs removed this experience for a number of respondents. Childcare and
employment cost savings were also described by participants when talking about enhanced
accessibility. For example, one participant suggested that if relying on a face-to-face appointment
they “would have been dragging all three kids along for what ended up being something that the
video call was able to address” (P863). The “option of video call” was also considered “useful” for

those who are employed or “working parents” (P335). Some respondents reported now being able
to schedule weekly appointments around their employment, an option that was not always possible
when relying on face-to-face appointments alone. Furthermore, a number of patients who are “not
able to drive” or “can’t drive” described VCs as “much more convenient” (P307, P846, P307) due to
enhanced independence and removal of reliance on others.
Due to the benefits encountered, numerous participants expressed a strong desire for VCs to be
made available beyond the COVID-19 pandemic: “I […] hope that all of our future appointments will
be held this way” (P863) highlighting an important element of patient choice.

Patient suggested improvements

The final theme identified related to patient suggested improvements. Suggestions most frequently
described included the simplification of patient guidance and information, specifically device-specific
advice and suggested device use for optimum VC experiences. For example, some patients reported
positioning their “iPad onto the floor, so I could show […] my feet and me walking” (P248). This
would have been less feasible if using “a desktop computer” (P248). Other participants suggested it
was “a bit challenging getting camera in position to demonstrate me doing the exercises” (P809).
Providing device specific information and recommending particular devices based on service
requirements and availability may therefore be beneficial.
Other suggested solutions related to the platform functionality; specifically the ability to “turn off
the music while sitting in the waiting room” (P388) or have “better waiting room music” (P463) as it
was considered “terrible” (P517) and repetitive by some. Patients also expressed a desire to be able
to “upload photos or videos” (P20) to the consultation and an ability to “change the mobile camera
being used” (P145). Further platform related improvements included expanding its functionality to
“other browsers” (P342) and having the character limit expanded beyond 200 characters for patients
who need to use the text function.
Finally, in recognition of digital skills and at times a lack of confidence, some participants expressed a
desire for a ‘practice run through’ or community kiosks to be made available so people could
familiarise themselves with the technology prior to their consultation. Interestingly, no suggestions
for healthcare training were proposed by participants although this may again reflect the questions
asked in the feedback survey.
Discussion

This research addressed a gap in existing literature by contributing towards early insight research
exploring patient experiences of the rapid rollout of VCs for outpatient care during the Covid-19
pandemic (14), with implications for policy, practice and future research.
Summary of findings

The vast majority of participants rated their experiences of VCs as ‘good’ or ‘very good,’ reported
feeling listened to and understood, felt able to communicate everything they wanted to and felt that
their needs had been met. Many reported saving time and money and over 90% would likely choose
a VC again in the future although it remains unclear whether this is as a result of no perceived
‘alternative’ option due to the global pandemic or positive patient experiences. Further exploration
of this finding would be beneficial including the exploration of patient experience over time.
Nevertheless, this Trust and others should consider making VC a permanent option of their provision
and not just for the duration of the pandemic.

Questions often raised about video consultations are that it loses the personal touch, that being on
screen means a loss of non-verbal communication, and that as a result the consultation may not be
as effective (23). This did not seem to be the case for most patients responding to this feedback
form. This routine feedback form asked questions about technical aspects and about the interaction
with the clinician. Those patients who had a good technical experience also had a good overall
experience; communication with the clinician did not seem to be a concern.
The Trust of course needs to ensure equity of access and most raise concerns about the barriers for
older people. Patients aged 71 or over were the only age group where a larger percentage of
respondents reported needing support in accessing their VC than those who access it alone.
Nevertheless, there was no clear age gradient in satisfaction with VC. Indeed, older people were
more likely to be positive about the technology than younger people. This may reflect higher
expectations among younger people. While high levels of positive experience were reported across
all device types, more users of tablet or mobile devices were positive. The relationship between age,
device use, and positive experience of VC is complex. We know that for older adults, the small size of
mobile phones can pose a barrier to use, coupled with declining dexterity and vision, mobiles are
mainly used by older adults for calls and texting (24), while tablet computers are increasing in
popularity for online access among older people (25). We also know that people in the older working
age groups may be more likely to be prefer the technologies they are or were familiar with at work
(often desktops with poor cameras and sound systems), while older people new to computing use
tablets as their ‘entry’ device (26).
Barriers described by participants included technological difficulties, quality of patient information,
administrative errors and accessibility or suitability concerns. For example, connectivity concerns
and a delay between video and sound were repeatedly identified by participants. Similarly, the
complexity and use of jargon in patient facing information was repeatedly called into question by
participants. Although converted into a video, patient information was considered to be in need of
further development and refinement to ensure inclusivity, particularly for people in the deaf
community. Conversely, identified benefits included reduced stress and anxiety, the opportunity to
‘open up more’ as a result of enhanced comfort, cost and time savings, increased sense of
affordability and service accessibility. Finally, participants suggested a number of improvements such
as the simplification of patient information including device recommendations and suggestions,
ability to turn off the waiting room music and opportunities to have a ‘practice run’ through to
increase familiarity.
Comparison with existing literature

Generally, our results continue to demonstrate general positive experiences for patients receiving
VC’s during the pandemic (4, 9, 10). Congruent with Gilbert et al. (4) (feedback following VC also
conducted during Covid-19), we found positively perceived aspects of VCs included reduced travel
times and reduced impact of travel on symptom severity such as fatigue (4). Other similarities with
Gilbert et al. (4) include the disruptive impact of video and sound quality and low confidence
reported among some participants (4). This also echoes results of Isautier et al. (9), with technology
limitations being a reason for poor experience. Our results indicating age differences in independent
use and family involvement are also congruent with other research (27). However, given the
difficulties that many older people have in travelling to outpatient clinics (28) and the high
acceptability of VC in our study for older people no quick assumptions should be made about the
unsuitability of VC for older people. Our participants reported higher levels of satisfaction and
willingness to use VCs in the future than those in previous work (4). The previous feedback was
collected within an entirely orthopaedic service, which could suggest greater satisfaction and use
intentions are seen here due to the variety of services included, which may better translate to VC
than orthopaedics, as perhaps a more ‘hands-on’ service. However, this would need further

exploration, as survey limitations impair our understanding of exactly which service our participants
accessed. Other contributions of this research include the identification of additional benefits
including enhanced comfort and subsequent ability to ‘open up more’, increased sense of
affordability and accessibility and difficulties faced as a result of perceived inadequacy with existing
patient information. Furthermore, the research by Gilbert et al. (4) had a smaller sample size,
collected from an orthopaedic service in an urban area, differing from the rural and aging setting in
our work (17, 18). Isautier et al. (9) also had a smaller number of VC responses, collected from a
general survey rather than directly following a VC, with Kayser et al. (10) also reporting on a small
sample size, with limited patient experience information and single centre focus (lung transplant
patients). In contrast to Isautier et al. (9) suggesting telehealth limitations included poorer quality of
communication, our results suggested the large majority of patients were satisfied with the VC
aspects related to communication, with combined technical satisfaction being lower, congruent with
Kayser et al (10). Here, we additionally provide further insight into the influence of patient age and
device used in predicting overall VC experience, with implications for targeted consultations in
future.
Strengths and limitations

Strengths of this research include the exploration of a relatively large data set of patient experiences
from an outpatient setting during the early stages of VC implementation. Unlike existing literature,
this research explores the use of VCs in both physical and mental health services, helping to address
limitations within existing COVID-response literature (4, 10). However, the limitations of this
research must also be acknowledged. Firstly, the main limitation is that it is a self-selected sample of
individuals who have attended a VC and chosen to provide feedback. Experiences or barriers for
individuals who have not been able to, or chosen not to use VCs currently remain unknown, as do
the experiences of those who chose not to provide feedback following their VC. Nevertheless, we
know that many hundreds of patients have had a positive experience of VC. Secondly, due to the
anonymous nature of the data set, we were unable to identify how many individuals completed the
survey on more than one occasion. Thirdly, this research relies on secondary data and the
subsequent questions/scales used by the Trust. While informed by the “One week implementation
guide for NHS Trusts and NHS Foundation Trusts” provided by NHS England and NHS Improvement
(19), the survey has some limitations, and to the researchers’ knowledge, the survey was not created
in co-design with all relevant stakeholders including patients and carers. The questions asked may
not therefore reflect the most important aspects of VC experience from a patient perspective.
Finally, this research explores patient perceptions of VC use, staff experiences also needs to be
explored and compared to identify areas of similarities and divergence, and best support
sustainment for all stakeholders.
Implications for practice and policy makers

Our study identified a number of practical implications. Patient suggested solutions include:
providing practice run-throughs to increase confidence and limit set-up time during the consultation,
facilitating the ability to turn off waiting room music, notifications when appointments are running
late and providing community kiosks, which could all be explored and implemented where possible.
Other suggested platform improvements include the ability to upload photos or videos to the
appointment, swap between cameras used, extend the capabilities of Attend Anywhere to other
internet browsers and expand the character restrictions of the text chat function, which may be
particularly important for accessibility for deaf patients. Routinely collecting and responding to
patient feedback in near real time is likely to be an integral aspect of identifying potential solutions
and celebrating areas of best practice.
Efforts should also be made to simplify and improve patient information, highlighted as a key
barrier. This may best be achieved in co-design with patients. While the implementation of VCs was
13

a rapid response, actively involving patients and the public in the creation of digital related
information may help to improve accessibility, relevance and understanding, potentially removing
one of the key identified barriers to patients joining their VC. An implication of this work is thus an
identified need to establish best practice for rapid co-design, when implementation timing is critical.
Any future patient information may also include guidance for patients on camera positioning, to
reduce another barrier identified in this work. Healthcare services may also benefit from
recommending particular devices based on their functionality and service requirements. For
example, larger, more static screens may be suitable for interactive CBT, child therapies or familybased interventions. Alternatively, services that require mobility assessments may be bettered
suited to more portable devices such as mobiles or tablets.
Finally, in response to patients noting administrative and human errors, the collaborative
development of checklists and supportive training may be beneficial. Trusts could perhaps include
on-screen checklists on patient records to ensure scheduling VCs is followed by the provision of an
appropriate link, patient facing guidance and set-up support.
Implications for future research

Further research is required to explore and compare areas of divergence and similarities between
the experiences of healthcare professionals and patients. Such research would support sustainment
of VCs for both parties to the consultation. Based on the limitations of this work and reliance on
feedback from patients who successfully accessed a VC; future research could explore challenges
and barriers faced by individuals choosing not, or unable to use VCs, particularly those considered to
be ‘seldom heard’ or marginalised in the context of digital health. This may develop a more nuanced
understanding of ways to increase accessibility and acceptability. Critical exploration of what works
for who, when, and in what circumstances would also aid in supporting suitability guidance. By doing
so, the potential benefits and experiences of VCs could be best realised. Stakeholders including
researchers, innovators, patients and health and care professionals should continue to identify and
engage with individuals considered to be ‘seldom heard’ or excluded in a digital context as this may
differ to other contexts and previous definitions (29). Similarly, there is an important balance to be
struck between acknowledging an increase in accessibility for some patient groups as a result of
digitalisation (who may usually encounter difficulties in accessing face-to-face services), while also
acknowledging a reduction in accessibility for others. This aspect needs urgent further work, and
reiterates the importance of patient choice and availability of multiple mediums to access health and
care services in the modern and rapidly evolving world.
This consideration may also be true for patients of different ages, considering our results show some
older patients required support in accessing their VC. Patients in the older age bracket also
represented the smallest group in our sample, based on successful VC use, thus future consideration
needs to be given to accessibility. Indeed, consideration is particularly needed for older adults
without access to family support to help facilitate VCs.
Other implications for future research include a need to identify the mechanisms that give rise to the
positive patient experiences and high levels of intention to use VCs in the future as demonstrated by
the Trust in this research. By doing so, other Trusts and healthcare services can engage with
acknowledged areas of best practice that serves the needs of both patients and health care
professionals. Economic evaluations that incorporate clinician, patient and environmental savings
may also be beneficial, although it is important to emphasise that potential cost savings should not
take precedence over patient safety, quality of care and stakeholder experience.
Additionally, suggestions made in this research that video consultations improve the ‘affordability’ of
appointments and sharing of personal or clinically relevant information are important areas of future
14

interest. Future research questions could include: how and in what ways, have video consultations
affected patient accessibility? Similarly, how if at all, do video consultations affect the therapeutic
relationship? Future research could compare patient feedback or levels of satisfaction with more
conventional face-to-face consultations or other VC platforms. Additionally, the range and type of
consultations available to patients are currently limited and expressed satisfaction may reflect a lack
of choice or alternatives. Future research may review and compare patient experiences over time,
particularly during times of heightened and reduced Covid-19 restrictions.
Finally, the implications for practice noted above on development of improved patient information
and an administrative checklist for clinicians may both benefit from a collaborative co-design
approach. Future research could look to re-assess patient experience based on implementation of
the co-designed items. Indeed, the creation of patient feedback surveys themselves may also benefit
from co-design with all relevant stakeholders to ensure valued aspects of service delivery, patient
safety and quality of care are considered (13, 30). Where possible, surveys should also include
narrative and quantitative questions as a reliance on quantitative measures alone can give rise to an
over-inflated perception of patient experience and satisfaction as frequently demonstrated in
existing literature (31). While the exclusion of patient input in survey design may be as a result of
rapid implementation, exploring rapid co-design methods may be an interesting area of future work.
Conclusion

In conclusion, the majority of patients reported positive experiences of video consultations for
outpatient care purposes in a rural, aging and deprived setting. Patients often felt listened to, able to
communicate their needs and understood, providing a positive and safe alternative to face-to-face
consultations during the pandemic. However, some barriers identified including technological
difficulties, accessibility of patient information and accessibility or suitability concerns require
further attention if the potential benefits of video consultation are to be best realised and use is to
be sustained. Implications of this research include the possible implementation of patient suggested
improvements, including trial calls, turning music off, facilitating photo uploads, expanding written
character limit and supporting VCs on other browsers. Future work may explore accessibility and
experience of patients excluded from this work, through lack of VC access. Future research may also
seek to explore rapid co-design techniques, which may improve patient information and feedback
methods.
