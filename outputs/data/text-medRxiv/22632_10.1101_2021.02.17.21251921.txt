Abstract
Across the world, countries are fighting to reduce the spread of COVID-19. The backbone of
the response is a test-trace-isolate strategy, where suspected infected get tested and isolated and
possible secondary cases get traced, tested and isolated. Because more accurate tests often take
longer to analyze, and the benefits of contact tracing are strengthened by rapid diagnosis, there
exists a trade-off in test sensitivity and test waiting time in test-trace-isolate strategies. Here we
ask: How many false negatives can be tolerated in a rapid test so that it reduces transmission
better than a slower, more accurate test? How does this change with contact tracing efficiency and
test waiting time? We find that a rapid, less sensitive test performs best for many test-parameter
choices and that this is true even for modest contact tracing efficiency. For COVID-19-like viral
parameters, a test with 40% false negatives and immediate result might reduce transmission as
well as a test with no false negatives and a 3-day waiting time. Our analysis suggests employing
rapid tests to reduce test waiting times as a viable strategy to reduce transmission when testing
infrastructure is under stress.

INTRODUCTION

Rapid diagnosis and isolation of COVID-19 cases is critical in reducing further transmission of the virus. Since a large fraction of infections take place before the infected
develops symptoms,1–3 isolation following the onset of symptoms is not sufficient to control
the pandemic.4,5 To ensure rapid diagnosis and reduce transmission before symptom onset,
the World Health Organization therefore recommends tracing, testing and isolating close
contacts of COVID-19 positives.6
The success of the test-trace-isolate strategy depends on many factors. In addition to
social factors such as the population being informed and complying with guidelines, successful rapid diagnosis and isolation depends heavily on the following 3 factors. i. Test waiting
time: How long it takes from a person wants to get tested to the result of the test arrives
and contact tracing begins. ii. Test sensitivity: How often a test returns a false negative.
iii. Tracing efficiency: The fraction of secondary cases that are successfully found through
contact tracing confirmed positives.
These 3 strategy parameters – test waiting time, test sensitivity, and tracing efficiency
– are not necessarily fixed. A surge in cases might cause an increase in test demands.
Higher test demand could in turn cause longer turnaround times as seen in some countries
during the fall and winter of 2020.7,8 Longer turnaround times lead to slower tracing of
secondary infections and thus a vicious cycle begins. The 3 strategy parameters are also
not independent. Faster test results often come at the cost of lower sensitivity. PCR tests
are highly accurate, but take significant time to analyze. Faster results can be achieved by
pooling tests9–11 or using rapid antigen tests,12 lateral flow devices13 or saliva tests.14
Recent analyses concluded that test sensitivity is secondary to frequency and turnaround
times in population-screening strategies15,16 as implemented by Slovakia in November 2020.17
In context of the more-widely applied test-trace-isolate strategies, rapid tests increase the
effect of contact tracing. This raises the natural question: When is it better to get a fast
result than an accurate result? How does this change with the efficiency of contact tracing
efforts, and with turnaround times? Here we confront these questions.

MODEL DESCRIPTION

To quantify the impact of test-trace-isolate strategies on growing epidemics, we simulate
the branching structure of the chains of infections, also referred to as the “epidemic tree”.18,19
Our model lets us keep track of who infected whom, which is essential when simulating
contact tracing and quarantining infectious people. In the model (Figure 1A), infected
individuals give rise to new cases, unless quarantined following testing and tracing efforts.
We initiate a simulation with some number of newly infected people, Nseed ∈ N. The simulation progresses in discrete timesteps, corresponding to days, and we make the simplifying
assumption that every infected person, goes through the same phases before recovering:
3 days of being presymptomatic and noninfectious followed by 8 infectious days. As for
COVID-19,20 some fraction of cases, pasymp , remain asymptomatic for the entire infectious
period; all other infected cases experience symptoms starting on day 7 after infection.
In the absence of testing, tracing and isolation, an infectious person would give rise to
k secondary cases. For each infected, we assume that k is drawn from the probability
distribution P (k). When each of these k secondary cases is infected, we determine the time
of infection by drawing an integer from the probability distribution Ptime (t). Ptime (t) takes
positive values on the days where the infected is infectious and, mimicking COVID-19,1,15
peaks around symptom onset (Figure 1B). These infections take place unless the infected is
in quarantine at the time the infection would occur.
Infectious people quarantine only when waiting for a test to be taken, receiving a test
result, or after testing positive. In our model, an infectious person orders a test if either of
two things happens: 1) The person is traced; 2) The person develops symptoms. In either
case, the person orders a test immediately and then waits δ = δtest +δresult days for the result.
The test waiting time is divided into δtest days waiting for the test to be taken followed by
δresult days to receive the result. The test correctly identifies the case with probability equal
to its sensitivity, 1 − pfalse , where pfalse is the false negative rate. If the test comes back
positive, each of the person’s secondary cases is traced with independent probability ptrace .
We obtain indistinguishable results when simulating the same δ with varying values of δtest
and δresult . Thus, the key parameters of the model are the test waiting time δ, test sensitivity
1 − pfalse , and tracing efficiency ptrace .
Following tmax timesteps, we count the number of nodes that completed their whole

infectious period, nparents . We also count the number of people these nodes infected, nchildren .
The output of the simulation is the effective reproduction number of simulated disease:
Reff = nchildren /nparents .

III.

RESULTS

We use the model to examine the trade-off between test waiting time and test accuracy
depending on the tracing efficiency. In our simulations, we therefore vary the parameters
δ, 1 − pfalse , and ptrace and fix all other parameters (for δ ≥ 1, we set δresult = 1). For P (k)
we choose a Poisson distribution with mean R0 = 2 (slightly lower than estimated in early
stages of the pandemic21,22 ) and for Ptime (t) we choose the right-skewed distribution depicted
in Fig. 1B. Finally, we choose tmax = 50.
To develop some intuition, let us first introduce the results we obtain when fixing the
tracing efficiency, ptrace = 0.80. This constraint leaves 2 free parameters: The test sensitivity,
slow
1 − pfalse , and the test delay, δ. We now compare the effective reproduction number Reff
slow
obtained by using a slow, but accurate test (parameters: pslow
≥ 1 day) to
false = 0 and some δ
rapid
the reproduction number, Reff
, obtained with a less accurate, but rapid test (parameters:

some prapid
= 0 days).
false and δ

To evaluate whether speed or accuracy is to be preferred, we compute the difference in
obtained effective reproduction numbers of the virus under the different choices of tests,
rapid
slow
∆Reff = Reff
− Reff
. Let us choose some test delay, e.g. δ slow = 2 days (perhaps cor-

responding to a PCR test with a 1-day waiting time to get tested and a subsequent 1-day
waiting time to get the result). In this case, how will ∆Reff depend on the risk of getting a
false negative test result? For very high sensitivity (low pfalse ), this faster test will be almost
as accurate as the slower test it is being compared to. For this reason, the fast test will be
preferable to the slower one (Fig. 2A top colorbar). If we now imagine slowly decreasing
the test sensitivity, ∆Reff will gradually increase until it reaches a breaking point where
the slow and rapid tests reduce the effective reproduction number equally well: ∆Reff = 0.
Decreasing the sensitivity even further makes ∆Reff positive, meaning that for this high
probabilities of false negatives, the accurate test is to be preferred.
If we now make the same plot but with a higher waiting time to receive the slow test, the
breaking point will move to a lower test sensitivity. The second colorbar in Fig. 2A shows

the result for δ slow = 3 days. The breaking point moved from sensitivity ≈ 0.91 to ≈ 0.63
with this single day increase in waiting time – corresponding to a fourfold increase in pfalse !
Increasing the waiting time once more, setting δ slow = 4, moves the breaking point further
to the left. In this latter case, a 54% chance of a false negative is better than a 4 day wait
for accuracy.
Having established some intuition for the simulations, we proceed to varying the third
parameter: the tracing efficiency. By varying the tracing efficiency, for each choice of δ slow
we get 2-dimensional heatmaps instead of the one-dimensional colorbars presented in the
previous paragraphs (Fig. 2B-D). In these heatmaps, the breaking points become white
curves. Every point to the right of the breaking-point curve is a parameter combination
where a faster test is preferable. Every point to the left of the breaking-point curve is
a parameter combination that favors an accurate test. Notice how all the breaking-point
curves start in the lower-right corner (where tests are completely accurate but no contact
tracing is done) and how quickly they move to the left with increasing tracing efficiency.

DISCUSSION

Testing, tracing and isolating positive cases is central in many countries’ strategy to
fight the current COVID-19 pandemic.23–25 We have demonstrated that there is a sizeable
trade-off between test sensitivity and test waiting times in such strategies, and that it
is often beneficial to prioritize test speed over test sensitivity. Moreover, we find that
this benefit of rapid tests increases quickly with increases in test waiting times, and that
even modest tracing efficiency unlocks the advantages of rapid tests. This indicates that
additional waiting time for test results must be avoided and that it often makes sense to
reduce test sensitivity in order to do so. It is to be expected that testing systems will
occasionally get under stress during a pandemic, and having a way to avoid build-up of
waiting times in this scenario is crucial. Designing such stress-relieve strategies presents an
interesting direction for future research.
Some of the assumptions we have made can be questioned. Three such assumptions are:
5

That quarantine hinters any transmission; that symptomatic individuals do not quarantine
after testing (false) negative; and that the probability of getting a false negative result does
not depend on the infected’s infectiousness at the time the test was taken. We note that all
of these assumptions will favor reducing transmission by slower, more accurate tests: That
people do not break isolation benefits the tests with long waiting times; false negative results
leading to completely normal behavior damages only the tests that allow for false negative
results; lastly, making false negatives less likely at high viral load would make the rapid
tests more reliable early in the course of disease, when many new secondary cases could
be avoided following diagnosis. That we have chosen our assumptions as to disfavor rapid
low-sensitivity tests means that our results can be interpreted as conservative estimates of
the benefits of reducing test waiting time with less sensitive tests.
Our choices of the probability distributions P (k) and Ptime (t) can also be questioned.
A better choice for P (k) might be a heavy-tailed distribution that could account for superspreading behavior.26,27 Choosing a geometric distribution for P (k) with the same mean
yields indistinguishable results (not shown). On the other hand, the choice of Ptime (t) influences results: Higher infectivity early in the course of disease makes the benefit of rapid
tests greater (simulations not shown).
Two other limitations arise not from parameter choices, but the model itself. First, our
model does not take depletion of susceptibles into account. Such effects are unimportant to
what we were interested in: the effect of testing and tracing on the effective reproduction
number at a given stage of the pandemic. Secondly, our implementation of contact tracing
allows only for descendants of the confirmed positive to be traced. Not including two-way
contact tracing or the possibility of identifying individuals through non-parents could cause
us to underestimate the effect of contact tracing.28–31 This, and not taking into account
possible beneficial effects on contact tracing that might be caused by infected being present
at the test site when receiving the diagnosis, again biases our results against the rapid tests
that so rely on tracing efforts.
Overall, our analysis suggests employing rapid tests to reduce test waiting times as a
viable strategy to reduce transmission even at modest waiting times and contact tracing
efficiency.
