Significance Statement
We address what has become an unusually important, but contentious, question – Did
mandated sheltering in place affect the incidence of non-natural death in the United
States? We use time-series methods to exploit a “natural experiment” in which
California and Florida imposed and relaxed stay-at-home orders at different times. We
find that shelter-in-place orders likely reduced non-natural mortality. We argue that
ignoring averted non-natural deaths will lead not only to an underestimate of the
benefits of the shelter-in-place policies, but also to an undercount of the impact of
COVID-19 infections on natural deaths.

ABSTRACT
Increasing hospitalizations for COVID-19 in the United States (US) and elsewhere have
ignited debate over whether to reinstate shelter-in-place policies adopted early in the
pandemic to slow the spread of infection. The debate includes claims that sheltering in
place influences deaths unrelated to infection or other natural causes. Testing this claim
should improve the benefit/cost accounting that presumably informs the decision of
whether to reimpose sheltering in place. To distinguish effects of shelter-in-place
policies from other events in the pandemic, we compare experiences in two large US
states with markedly different policies. We use time-series methods to compare
temporal variation in non-natural deaths in California to that in Florida. California was
the first state to begin and among the last to end sheltering in place while sheltering
began later and ended earlier in Florida. We find that during weeks when California had
shelter-in-place orders in effect, but Florida did not, the odds that a non-natural death
occurred in California rather than Florida fell 14.8% below values expected from history.
These results suggest that sheltering-in-place policies reduce mortality from
mechanisms unrelated to infection or other natural causes of death.

As COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations increase in the US and elsewhere,
debate over the prudence of shelter-in-place mandates has intensified (1, 2). The
debate includes claims that the intervention has induced unintended adverse health
effects (3). The “Great Barrington Declaration,” for example, justifies opposition to
sheltering in place by citing “devastating effects on short and long-term public health (2,
4).” Others have extended this argument to suggest that harms of lockdowns include
increases in deaths not just from impeded access to health care, but also from suicide
(5) and intrafamily violence (6).
Although clinical anecdote (7) supports the intuition of increased mortality during
sheltering-in-place, the scholarly literature reports mixed results (8–10). These
divergent results likely arise, at least in part, because the observed populations varied in
the fraction at risk of what the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) term “natural” death
or that plausibly averted had sheltering in place not disrupted medical care (11).
Although information characterizing deaths varies among states, all death certificates in
the US use a “manner of death” classification that includes “natural death” defined as
‘‘due solely or nearly totally to disease and/or the aging process (11).’’ Nearly all deaths
attributed to Covid-19, for example, should appear in the “natural death” category.
Based on data from the last decade, natural deaths account for approximately 89% of
deaths in the US (12).
The observed populations also likely varied in the fraction at risk of “non-natural”
deaths. How sheltering in place affects these deaths remains, however, even less clear
than its effect on natural deaths. As noted above, anecdote implies that suicides (5) and
death due to intrafamily violence (7) increased with sheltering in place. Other literature,

however, reports decreases in such non-natural deaths as those by accidents (13),
stranger-on-stranger violence (14), and medical error (15). Taken together, these
reports raise an important, question -- what has been the “net effect” of sheltering in
place on non-natural deaths? Answering this question requires an estimate of the
association between sheltering in place and the incidence of non-natural deaths. The
peer-reviewed literature, however, includes no attempts to estimate that association.
We attempt such an estimate using data from two US states. We use time-series
methods to compare non-natural deaths in California, the first state to begin and among
the last to end sheltering in place, with those in another large state, Florida, where
sheltering in place began late and ended early.
California and Florida responded very differently to the emerging epidemic in
early 2020. Large employers, primarily in the technology sector, began telling their
California workers to stay at home effective March 8 (16). Counties in the San
Francisco Bay Area issued stay-at-home orders effective March 17 (17) and the
Governor issued similar orders for the remainder of the state on March 19 (18).
California began reopening on May 15 (19). Florida mandated sheltering in place
effective April 3 and reopened on May 1 (20, 21). Data that indirectly measure the
behavior of households suggest that the citizens of both states reduced mobility and
social contacts when shelter-in-place orders were in effect and increased both when
orders were removed (22).

METHODS
Data
CDC regularly publishes weekly death counts by state and select causes from
2014 through the most recently accounted week (23). Our tests used deaths in
California and Florida for 333 weeks beginning December 29, 2013 (first data available)
and ending May 16, 2020 (last week of sheltering in place in California). We subtracted
weekly “Natural Cause” deaths from total deaths to estimate the incidence of nonnatural deaths in both states. These deaths include, as suggested above, death by
accident, suicide, interpersonal violence, drug overdoses, and medical error (i.e.,
iatrogenesis). State counts of 2020 non-natural deaths by subcategories have not yet
been published. In 2019, however, motor vehicle crashes and suicide each accounted
for approximately 16% of non-natural deaths in both California and Florida while
homicide contributed about 6.5% in each state (12).
We computed the weekly odds that a non-natural death in either state occurred
in California. We transformed those odds to natural logarithms (i.e., logits) to allow us to
express results as percent difference between observed and expected odds during
weeks when California alone sheltered in place.
Analyses
The weekly odds that a death occurred in California instead of Florida exhibit
patterns over time (i.e., autocorrelation) that can lead to an expected or predicted value
different from the mean of all weeks. As described below, we identify and model
autocorrelation in the logits before shelter in place orders and develop predictions for

ensuing weeks. We then ask whether the observed values differed from predicted
during periods when shelter-in-place orders were in place in California but not Florida.
Our test proceeded through 5 steps consistent with time-series conventions used
in epidemiology (24,25). First, we used Box-Jenkins methods (26) to identify and model
autocorrelation in a 323-week “training period” up to March 8, 2020. Second, we used
the training model to forecast values for the next 10 weeks. Third, we created a 333
week “counterfactual series” by joining the 10 forecasts from step 2 to the 323 fitted
values of the training model estimated in step 1. Fourth, we subtracted the 333
counterfactual logits from the observed logits to estimate a residual series. The residual
series measure the degree to which the likelihood of a non-natural death in California
differed from that expected based on such deaths in Florida and on historical patterns
(i.e., autocorrelation). Fifth, we regressed the residual series computed in Step 4 on a
binary shelter-in-place variable scored 1 for the weeks when California had shelter-inplace orders in effect but Florida did not, and scored 0 for all other weeks. The variable,
therefore, equaled 1 for the 3 weeks starting March 8 and ending March 28 and for the
3 weeks starting May 3 and ending May 16.
If sheltering in place changed the likelihood of non-natural deaths, the coefficient
for the shelter-in-place variable would appear detectably different from 0. We set
detection sensitivity at P< .05. Subtracting the antilog of that coefficient from 1 and
multiplying the difference by 100 yields the percent difference between observed and
expected odds.

RESULTS
Weekly incidence of non-natural deaths ranged from 210 to 511 (mean 399) in
California during our test period, and from 176 to 452 (mean 340) in Florida. Figure 1
shows the deaths plotted by week.
The best fitting Box-Jenkins model, identified and estimated in Step 1, for logits
in the 323-week training period was as follows:

(Yct/Yft)e = 0.163+1/(1-0.315B)(1-0.176B5)(1-0.254B7)at

(Yct/Yft)e is the log odds that a non-natural death in California or Florida during week t
occurred in California. The constant, 1.184 (SE 0.016), equals the mean of (Yct/Yft)e.
The 3 autoregressive parameters (i.e., 0.315, 0.176, and 0.254), all of which exceeded
at least twice their standard errors (i.e., 0.054, 0.057, and 0.056 respectively), imply that
including the values of (Yct/Yft)e at weeks t-1, t-5 and t-7 improves, over using only the
mean of past values, the model’s prediction of (Yct/Yft)e at week t. B is the “backshift
operator” or value of (Yct/Yft)e at week t-1, t-5, or t-7. at is the model error term at week
t.
The results of Steps 2 and 3, in which we construct a counterfactual series by
joining values forecasted for weeks 324 through 333 to the fitted values during to the
training weeks, appear in Figure 2 as a line. We show only the last year of data to allow
better resolution of the information. The points in Figure 2 show the observed values for

the 333 weeks. The residual series, computed in Step 4 by subtracting the full 333
expected from observed values, became the dependent variable for our test.
Step 5, in which we regress the residual series on our shelter-in-place binary
variable yielded a regression coefficient of -0.160 (SE 0.037). This estimate implies that
the odds of a nonnatural death in the two states occurring in California detectably
decreased by 14.8% when California alone sheltered in place.
The association between the start of sheltering in place and non-natural deaths
may not persist throughout its imposition. To shed light on the week-by-week
association, we repeated our main test but substituted a binary variable scored 1 for the
week ending March 14 and 0 otherwise for the shelter in place variable described
above. We estimated its association with our dependent variable in the synchronous
configuration (i.e., both occurring in the same week) as well as in 9 lagged
configurations in which the dependent variable ranged from 1 through 9 weeks after that
ending March 14. Table 1 shows the results. The pattern of coefficients appears
consistent with our main results in that greater differences between expected and
observed appear when California alone sheltered in place. Stronger associations,
however, appear in the weeks when California started sheltering in place and Florida
had yet to start. The associations appear smaller when California remained sheltering
in place and Florida reopened.
We tested whether our main finding would appear if we allowed the Box-Jenkins
modeling in Step 1 to include all 333 months. This approach is “naïve” to the timing of
the assumed interruption and therefore allows values during shelter in place to influence
estimation of the Box-Jenkins parameters as well as subsequent counterfactuals. This

test converged with our main test by detecting the same structure of autocorrelation and
essentially the same association between the shelter-in-place variable and the odds of
non-natural death occurring in California.
DISCUSSION
Time-series modeling using seven years of weekly non-natural deaths shows
that when California ordered sheltering in place but Florida did not, Californians yielded
unexpectedly few non-natural deaths. We estimate an approximate 15% reduction
below values expected from non-natural deaths in Florida and from historical patterns.
The estimated benefit appears larger at the outset of mandated sheltering in place than
near its suspension.
Our findings have implications for basic as well as and policy research. First,
they imply that basic epidemiologic research intended to estimate deaths arising from
impeded access, regardless of its source, to routine medical care should exclude nonnatural deaths from tests of association. Including them may lead to underestimating the
pathogenic effect of such impedance because medical care likely has relatively little
effect on their incidence and because they may account for 10% or more of all deaths.
This circumstance similarly implies that benefit/cost analyses intended to inform the
policy debate over whether and when to employ sheltering in place to manage
epidemics needs to use results from prior epidemiologic research with care. The
scholarly work intended to estimate deaths accruing to impeded access to routine
medical care has included non-natural deaths in the accounting. Using results from
research that does not exclude those deaths could lead to an underestimate of deaths
and their costs.

Advantages of our approach include that Box-Jenkins modeling accounts for
autocorrelation including trends, cycles (e.g., seasonality), and the tendency for a series
to remain elevated or depressed after high of low values. Using Florida as a comparison
population, moreover, allows us to control for events, unrelated to shelter-in-place
orders, that influenced non-natural deaths in both California and Florida.
Limitations of our approach include that currently available data do not allow us
to distinguish among types of non-natural deaths. Further research should, when CDC
publishes more detailed data, test the intuitive hypothesis that some types of these
deaths, those by auto crash and medical error, for example, decrease during shelter in
place while others, those by suicide and intrafamily violence for instance, may increase.
We do not claim a full accounting of the costs associated with non-natural deaths
in California or Florida. We did not include, for example, the morbidity of non-fatal
injuries averted by sheltering in place. CDC data indicate that for every 1 motor vehicle
crash fatality, for example, there are 9 non-fatal hospitalizations and 88 individuals
treated and released from emergency departments (27). These facts suggest that the
reductions in non-natural fatalities that we measured trace much larger reduction in nonfatal morbidity and disability.
We did not attempt to estimate the association between non-natural deaths and
social distancing induced by circumstances other than shelter-in-place orders. Mobility
measured by household surveys or cellphone movement (22), for example, may vary
directly with non-natural deaths. Future work should include such indicators of mobility
to estimate the separate effects of differing interventions.

Evaluating the association between mandated sheltering-in-place policies and all
deaths or non-Covid-19 deaths may provide a misleading picture of the benefits of
these interventions. Shelter-in-place orders widely adopted in response to the COVID19 epidemic likely reduced not only contagious illness but also non-natural mortality.
Ignoring averted non-natural deaths will lead to an underestimate of the benefits of the
shelter-in-place policies. Similarly, ignoring reductions in non-natural deaths may also
lead to an undercount of the impact of COVID infections on death.
