Abstract
Current projections and unprecedented storm activity to date suggest the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season
will be extremely active and that a major hurricane could make landfall during the global COVID-19
pandemic. Such an event would necessitate a large-scale evacuation, with implications for the trajectory
of the pandemic. Here we model how a hypothetical hurricane evacuation from four counties in southeast
Florida would affect COVID-19 case levels. We find that hurricane evacuation increases the total number
of COVID-19 cases in both origin and destination locations; however, if transmission rates in destination
counties can be kept from rising during evacuation, excess evacuation-induced case numbers can be
minimized by directing evacuees to counties experiencing lower COVID-19 transmission rates.
Ultimately, the number of excess COVID-19 cases produced by the evacuation depends on the ability of
destination counties to meet evacuee needs while minimizing virus exposure through public health
directives.
Introduction
The combination of the COVID-19 pandemic, existing racial and socioeconomic inequalities, and
environmental stressors exacerbated by climate change is exposing the many ways in which “compound
risks” threaten human lives and wellbeing while straining the ability of governments at all scales to limit
the damage from any one threat on its own1. Intersections of climate extremes with the pandemic—recent
widespread flooding in South Asia at a time of rapidly increasing COVID-19 caseloads, for example—
have made clear that the consequences of such compound risk events can be lethal, though the
underreporting of cases around the world2 and widely varying testing capabilities3 make it difficult to
accurately quantify their magnitude.
With the anticipated peak of the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season approaching and COVID-19 cases
widespread and abundant in many hurricane-prone areas of the United States, the nation is poised to
experience the collision of two major disasters. This study therefore addresses how decision-making
around one key aspect of hurricane response—evacuation—could influence the trajectory of the pandemic
in the US and be optimized to limit excess COVID-19 cases. With future global warming expected to
continue the observed trend toward increasingly intense Atlantic hurricanes 4,5, understanding how to
manage and minimize the impact of the combined risks associated with a major hurricane and a global
pandemic could prove critical both later this year and in the long-term as the risks of such simultaneous
disasters increase around the world.
Efficient, effective evacuations—whether voluntary or mandatory—are a critical component of ensuring
public safety during natural disasters. The scale of recent evacuations from US Southeast and Gulf Coast
states has been large: During Hurricanes Matthew (2016), Irma (2017), and Dorian (2019), for example,
roughly 2.5, 6.5, and 1.1 million people, respectively, were under evacuation orders 6–8. By changing the

distribution of people for days or weeks, a large-scale evacuation amid a pandemic has the potential to
alter the trajectory and geographic distribution of infections. And by temporarily relocating from their
own homes into potentially shared living arrangements where levels of social contact are higher, evacuees
may experience greater transmission risk both during and after an evacuation.
This analysis evaluates how a large-scale evacuation of the southeast Florida coast from a hypothetical
Category 3 hurricane would affect the total number of COVID-19 cases and their spatial distribution in
evacuees’ origin and destination counties. This is accomplished by first building a hypothetical hurricane
evacuation scenario from previously published studies of evacuation behavior in the southeast US region.
We then use a simple, two-county infectious disease model to identify the most relevant evacuation and
epidemiological characteristics influencing COVID-19 case counts. The findings from the these
simulations are used to inform experiments with a larger metapopulation model representing SARS-CoV2 transmission in all 3,142 US counties9, as well as various evacuation scenarios.
RESULTS
Identifying key parameters using a two-county model
We used a simplified, two-county metapopulation model, representing a generic pair of origin and
destination counties, to determine the factors that have greatest influence on COVID-19 case numbers
(Methods; Figure 1a). Specifically, we evaluated the effects of six evacuation and epidemiological
characteristics on COVID-19 case numbers: transmission rates in origin and destination counties
(quantified by the effective reproductive number, 𝑅 ), the fraction of the origin county population that
evacuates (𝑝 ), the duration of the evacuation period (𝑇 ), and daily case numbers in the origin and
destination counties (𝑐𝑎𝑠𝑒 and 𝑐𝑎𝑠𝑒
). We simulated an evacuation by moving a fraction of the
population from the origin to the destination county. Evacuees then mixed with the population of the
destination county, before returning home. This simulation was repeated using different combinations of
each of the six characteristics in order to determine the effects of each on COVID-19 case numbers during
and following the evacuation.
We found that transmission rates in the origin and destination counties were the primary determinant of
case numbers (Methods; Figure 1b): evacuating individuals from a high-𝑅 origin to a low-𝑅 destination
produced fewer additional cases in the origin county and in the origin and destination county combined.
For the destination county alone, it was preferable to accept evacuees from a low-𝑅 origin. However, in
a real hurricane landing, the counties that require evacuation are determined by the path of the hurricane,
i.e. a low-𝑅 origin cannot be stipulated. The length of evacuation and the number of people evacuating
also influenced case numbers; however, these two characteristics are also expected to be shaped more by
the specific circumstances necessitated by a particular hurricane rather than by public health directives.
Full model simulations of hurricane evacuation scenarios
Next we used a national county-scale metapopulation model and a suite of scenarios to further explore
how transmission rates and hurricane evacuation affect COVID-19 incidence in origin and destination
counties (Methods). All scenarios assume that a Category 3 hurricane is approaching southeast Florida
and that people living in Palm Beach, Broward, Miami-Dade, and Monroe Counties are ordered to
evacuate. Based on studies of evacuation compliance and behavior in this region for Category 3+
hurricanes, we estimate that 48% of each county’s population would evacuate 7,10–17 (Methods). Assuming
that 19% of evacuees relocate elsewhere within their respective counties, this leads to a total of 2.3
million evacuees leaving the four affected counties 7,16–20.

For each scenario, evacuees were assigned to a different set of destination counties based on a list of 165
possible destinations across 26 states identified during post-Hurricane Irma surveys 7,17. In the baseline
scenario, evacuees were assigned to all 165 destination counties in proportion to observed evacuation
choices during Hurricane Irma. The number of evacuees assigned to each destination county for this
baseline scenario is shown in Figure 2a. In order to explore the effects of destination county transmission
levels on the number of evacuation-associated COVID-19 cases, we further proposed two hypothetical
scenarios in which evacuees were assigned to locations with high 𝑅 or low 𝑅 . In the high (low) 𝑅
scenario, 90% of the evacuees assigned to each county in the baseline scenario were instead diverted to
the 82 counties with the highest (lowest) 𝑅 , weighted by the proportion of evacuees sent to each of these
counties in the baseline scenario (Methods).
Scenario projections were initiated from the model state calibrated to observed county-level COVID-19
case and death data from February 21st through July 23rd, 2020 (Methods). The estimated effective
reproductive numbers (𝑅 ) in origin and destination counties at the start of simulations are shown in
Figure 2b. Evacuees tend to stay with friends or family, in hotels/motels, or in public shelters, each of
which would likely increase transmission opportunities relative to simply staying home 7. To reflect this,
we assume the COVID-19 transmission rate in destination counties increases during the evacuation period
by either 0%, 10%, or 20%. These settings implicitly differentiate the levels of control effected in
destinations during evacuation, as well as differences in transmission potential associated with different
types of accommodation (e.g., staying with friends/families, hotels or shelters). In addition, to reflect
periods of hurricane preparation and recovery21–23, we elevated the transmission rate in the origin counties
by 20% beginning 3 days prior to evacuation and ending 3 days after the return of evacuees (more
detailed simulation settings are provided in Methods). For comparison, we also generated simulations for
the same period but without evacuation.
In all scenarios, combined cases in origins and destinations are primarily driven by ongoing local
COVID-19 transmission dynamics (Figure S1; Table S1); however, evacuation does alter disease
outcomes. In the baseline scenario, total COVID-19 cases in the origin and destination counties increase
significantly relative to the no-evacuation scenario (Figure 2c; Table 1; Wilcoxon signed rank test),
indicating evacuation in and of itself can cause a statistically significant increase of COVID-19 cases. As
indicated by the low and high scenarios, the number of COVID-19 cases resulting from evacuation is
significantly lower (higher) than the baseline scenario if evacuees are directed to counties with lower
(higher) transmission rates. However, as the transmission rate in the destination counties increases, the
differences between the low and high scenarios become less pronounced. This result indicates that the
benefits of a directed evacuation would be amplified by more stringent control efforts in destination
counties.
Greedy optimization method to minimize COVID-19 cases
The model simulations for our hypothetical evacuation scenarios indicate that a strategic evacuation plan
could reduce excess COVID-19 infections. However, these scenarios neither accounted for the
accommodation capacities of destination counties nor provided a framework for optimizing evacuation
plans.
To address these issues, we developed a greedy search optimization algorithm aimed at minimizing total
excess COVID-19 cases by strategically assigning evacuees to optimal destination counties. As indicated
by the two-county model simulations, evacuating individuals to destinations with low 𝑅 reduces
COVID-19 transmission. However, given the varying prevalence of infection in origin counties and the
nonlinear transmission dynamics, it is not straightforward to determine the optimal number of evacuees

from each origin county that should be prioritized and redirected to each of the lowest- 𝑅
destinations. In conducting the optimization, we imposed the following constraints on human movement:
1) we assumed that a fraction of evacuees cannot be redirected from their baseline destination county,
representing individuals whose choice of destination will not be influenced by evacuation directives,
perhaps due to financial constraints or preferences to stay with family; and 2) we prescribed a capacity
limit on the number of evacuees received by each destination county. The greedy search starts from an
evacuation matrix representing the evacuees who cannot be redirected from their destination and then
iteratively directs the remaining evacuees to destination counties with lowest 𝑅 . In each iteration, the
algorithm selects which origin counties will be assigned the evacuee slots available in a destination
county. This search is repeated for each successive destination county until all evacuees are assigned a
destination (Methods, Supplementary Information).
We repeated this evacuation optimization with three different settings: no increase, 10% increase, and
20% increase of transmission rates in destination counties, again to reflect differences in control efforts
and accommodation type. We assumed that 10% of evacuees will maintain their original destination and
are thus not redirected, and that each destination has a capacity of 120% of the evacuees accepted in the
baseline scenario. We then generated the optimized evacuation plan for each setting. During the
optimization process, assigning more evacuees to low-𝑅 counties led to a reduced number of total
infections compared to the baseline scenario (Figure S2). The optimized top 20 destinations for the four
origin counties are reported in Tables S2-S4. In Figure 3a, we show the change in the number of evacuees
to each destination for the optimized evacuation scenario with a 10% increased transmission rate in
destination counties. In general, evacuees who traveled to high-𝑅 destinations in the baseline scenario
were redirected to low-𝑅 destinations. For all three transmission rate scenarios, the optimized evacuation
effectively reduces the number of excess cases in both origin and destination counties compared to the
baseline scenario (Figure 3b). The reduction is greatest (up to 30%) for the scenario in which there is no
increase in the transmission rate in destination counties, which highlights the crucial role of effective
intervention during evacuation. In this optimization example, the fraction of non-allocable evacuees and
destination capacity are hypothetical, as these quantities are unknown. If such information were available
or could be estimated using socioeconomic and geographic characteristics, the optimization could be
tailored to reflect more realistic constraints on evacuation.

The results of this study have far-reaching consequences not only for hurricane evacuation this season but
also for long-term US hurricane preparedness and evacuation planning.

Research suggests that people rely on past experiences when choosing their evacuation routes and
destinations20,24. This study shows that excess COVID-19 cases could be minimized by instead directing
evacuees to either counties with lower COVID-19 transmission rates or an optimized set of counties.
While decisions about whether to evacuate and where to go ultimately fall to individual households,
emergency communications from federal agencies and broadcast meteorologists can influence residents’
perceptions of hurricane threats and are seen as trusted sources of information in emergency situations 25.
Because a majority of US residents are concerned about COVID-1926, if the need for a large-scale
evacuation arises, evacuees may turn to these same trusted sources for information on how best to stay
safe while evacuating. Local, state, and federal officials who develop evacuation orders and communicate
them to the general public may therefore want to consider whether their evacuation-related
communications should include assessments of the relative safety of potential destination counties with
respect to COVID-19 risk rather than allowing default evacuation patterns based on past storms to prevail.
This research shows that the magnitude of the impact of evacuation on COVID-19 caseloads is highly
dependent on conditions in destination counties. The degree to which counties are prepared to host,
isolate, and meet the needs of evacuees while also minimizing virus exposure through public health
directives such as social distancing and mask wearing will be a key determinant of the impact of
evacuation on COVID-19 case numbers. Preparedness within destination counties is particularly
important because, as this analysis shows, destination counties will bear the brunt of the excess COVID19 cases that result from an evacuation event. Destination counties must be aware of the influx of
evacuees should it occur and must be allocated the financial and human resources needed to ensure the
safety of both their residents and the evacuees they are sheltering.
The US response to the COVID-19 pandemic has varied widely from state to state and from county to
county. As a result of policy, communication and ideological differences, compliance with mask wearing,
for example, has varied substantially even within a given state 27. This variability could extend into
county-level hurricane preparedness measures, particularly given that guidance may be issued at the state
level while implementation of specific measures is left to counties, as is the case for Florida’s current coresponse guidance on hurricane evacuation and COVID-19 28.
Centuries of systemic racism in the US have left Black, Native American, Latinx, and other non-White
people with both higher exposure to and fewer resources to cope with environmental or health-related
stressors compared with White populations29,30. For example, recent research suggests that federal
financial aid after natural disasters is not equitably distributed among communities and may even
exacerbate income inequality31,32. Low-income communities and communities of color consequently
struggle to prepare in advance of and recover in the wake of natural disasters 33,34.
Due to systemic health inequities, including higher exposure to air pollution29 and higher rates of
underlying health conditions35, COVID-19 has also disproportionately affected Black, Native American,
and Latinx people in the US36. These groups have experienced higher infection rates, poorer health
outcomes, and deeper declines in employment during the pandemic 36–38. The additional risks faced
because of COVID-19 and the financial costs associated with evacuation39 could present additional
challenges for these segments of the population during hurricane evacuation or discourage them from
evacuating altogether.
This study has used idealized scenarios to model hurricane evacuation patterns. These scenarios cannot
fully capture many household-level choices that could alter levels of social contact—and therefore
potential COVID-19 exposure—during the evacuation period. For example, previous studies of hurricane
evacuations along the US Southeast and Gulf Coasts show that evacuees strongly and consistently prefer

to stay with friends and family over going to hotels/motels or public shelters 7,14,15,20,39,40. Levels of social
contact and potential virus transmission would likely differ across accommodation types, which implies a
level of complexity and spatial heterogeneity that is not possible to incorporate within the model used in
this study. Similarly, this study does not consider variable levels of exposure to COVID-19 based on
evacuation transportation mode. While evacuees strongly prefer to travel in their own vehicles 17, shared
modes of transportation such as buses or carpools would increase potential virus transmission and
exposure. Recent research suggests that for both transportation and shelter, the sharing economy—
Internet-based transactions via companies like Airbnb that allow for peer-to-peer sharing of goods and
services—could play a role in providing free or affordable resources to evacuees that would enable
evacuees to maintain social distancing41.
As a result of the ongoing economic and physical toll of the pandemic, household-level decision making
regarding evacuation may differ from that of past years. There are many sociodemographic factors
associated with decision making around evacuation including experience with past hurricanes, length of
residence, home ownership, age, income, race, employment status, level of social connectivity, social
cues, perceived levels of self-efficacy and risk, and storm conditions42–46. While some of these factors
(e.g. gender and race) are unchanged from last year, others (e.g. employment status and income) may be
either changed or very much influenced by the current COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast, the idealized
scenarios adopted for this study assume that people will choose destination counties and accommodation
types that match past choices.
The movement of people in and out of hurricane-affected counties does not simply cease after all
evacuees have returned to their homes. For instance, communities affected by hurricanes often experience
an influx of workers who assist with rebuilding and recovery efforts 47–49, which could also influence
infection rates in the affected counties long after the evacuation period. Post-evacuation movement
patterns are beyond the scope of the present study.
Critically, hurricane evacuation is intended to save lives and prevent serious injuries to residents of
hurricane-prone regions. While this study evaluates excess COVID-19 cases resulting from evacuation, it
does not evaluate non-COVID-19 related risks to human health and lives in the event that people choose
to remain in their homes despite receiving evacuation orders–risks that could increase if people are afraid
to evacuate out of concern for contracting COVID-19. Nor does it address evacuations of hospitals,
nursing homes, prisons, or other facilities. It will be critical for emergency managers to factor in these—
and other—complexities when developing plans50.
Finally, the results presented here are based on scenarios that, while plausible, are strictly hypothetical.
While the overall notion that distributing evacuees to destination counties with low transmission rates
minimizes excess cases should theoretically apply to geographies outside Florida or the US, additional
model simulations of such scenarios should be generated.
CONCLUSION
The data presented here show that while a large-scale hurricane evacuation would increase the total
number of COVID-19 cases in the US, directing evacuees to plausible destination counties with low
COVID-19 transmission rates would minimize the excess cases induced by the evacuation event. These
results have far-reaching implications for immediate emergency management and communications
practices, as well as long-term disaster preparedness.
Faced with the prospect of tens of thousands of additional cases arising from a hurricane evacuation,
states and counties at both ends of evacuation routes must be allocated the necessary financial and human

measures intended to reduce COVID-19 transmission rates. Further, resource distribution must prioritize
the nation’s most vulnerable groups.

METHODS
Hurricane evacuation scenario development
To develop a hypothetical hurricane evacuation scenario for southeast Florida, we drew from previously
published hurricane evacuation studies focused on Category 3+ hurricanes that have affected the
Southeast or Gulf Coast regions of the US. In this scenario, we assumed a Category 3 hurricane
approaching the southeast Florida coast along a track that would necessitate evacuations from Palm
Beach51, Broward52, Miami-Dade53, and Monroe54 Counties.
We obtained the population under mandatory evacuation orders in each county from GIS shapefiles of the
zones of mandatory evacuation from a Category 3+ hurricane for each county55. We then calculated the
percent of the population living within mandatory evacuation zones that would actually comply with
evacuation orders by averaging the compliance rate from eight regionally relevant studies of evacuation
behavior7,10–16. We found that the average evacuation order compliance rate from these studies was 66%.
Because many people living outside of the mandatory evacuation zones voluntarily choose to evacuate
during hurricanes as well, we used the same approach to calculate the percent of the population living
outside of mandatory evacuation zones but within the affected counties that would evacuate. Based on
four studies of this “shadow evacuation” phenomenon, we determined that an average of 47% of county
residents outside mandatory evacuation zones would also evacuate 7,13–15,17. The mandatory and voluntary
evacuees together represent 48% of each origin county’s population. We then determined that 19% of
these evacuees would relocate within their respective counties based on the average from four evacuation
behavior studies7,16–20.
Finally, to determine the destination counties of evacuees from each of the four origin counties, we
obtained raw post-Hurricane Irma survey data 7,17. These data allowed us to identify both the destination
counties and the percent of evacuees choosing each destination county. We then apportioned evacuees
leaving the four origin counties to each destination county.
Two-county model of COVID-19 transmission
In order to identify the most sensitive factors driving the COVID-19 transmission during evacuation, we
first ran simulations using a simple two-county model. This model describes the transmission dynamics of

COVID-19 during a hurricane evacuation from an origin (county 1) to a destination (county 2).
Mathematically, the transmission dynamics in the origin and destination are depicted by a susceptibleexposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model. We simulate the disease transmission as a stochastic Markov

Here 𝑁 , 𝑆 (𝑡), 𝐸 (𝑡), 𝐼 (𝑡), 𝐼 (𝑡) and 𝑅 (𝑡) are the total, susceptible, exposed, reported infected,
unreported infected and recovered population in county 𝑖 on day 𝑡; 𝛽 is the transmission rate in county 𝑖;
𝜇 is the relative transmissibility for unreported infections; 𝑍 is the average latency period; 𝐷 is the
average duration of infectiousness; 𝛼 is the fraction of reported infections. The effective reproductive
number, which quantifies the local transmission rate, is computed as 𝑅 = 𝛽 𝐷[𝛼 + 𝜇(1 − 𝛼)]𝑆 /𝑁

During evacuation, we assume a fraction (𝑝 ) of the population is evacuated from county 1 to county 2
and mixes with the local population for 𝑇 days. Individuals within each compartment are randomly
drawn from the population in the origin. We track the infections in the evacuated population in county 2,
which then return to the origin after the evacuation and mix with the population therein. To account for
the increased human interactions associated with evacuating to shared living spaces 7, we additionally
assume the transmission rates in the origin and destination are elevated during a period that spans the
evacuation process. Specifically, the transmission rate in the origin is increased by 20% starting from 3
days prior to the evacuation until 3 days after the return of evacuees. The transmission rate in the
destination is increased by 20% during the evacuation.
In model simulations, we fixed the following parameters in Eqs. (1)-(5): total population 𝑁 = 𝑁 = 10 ;
reporting rate 𝛼 = 0.1; relative transmissibility 𝜇 = 0.64; latency period 𝑍 = 4 days; infectious period
𝐷 = 4 days. Denote the daily reported cases in the origin and destination as 𝑐𝑎𝑠𝑒 . To initiate model
simulations, we set 𝐼 (0) = 𝑐𝑎𝑠𝑒 𝐷, 𝐼 (0) = 𝐼 (0)/𝛼 − 𝐼 (0), 𝐸 (0) = 𝐼 (0) + 𝐼 (0), 𝑅 (0) = 0.05𝑁
and 𝑆 (0) = 𝑁 − 𝐸 (0) − 𝐼 (0) − 𝐼 (0) − 𝑅 (0). Model simulations were generated for the following
stages after day 0: 14 days of local transmission, 3 days of pre-evacuation (with elevated transmission rate
in the origin), 𝑇 days of evacuation (with elevated transmission rates in both the origin and destination
counties), 3 days of post-evacuation (with elevated transmission rate in the origin), and 28 days of
additional post-evacuation simulation.
We varied six parameters to generate a large number of parameter combinations for use in model
simulation: 𝛽 , 𝛽 = 0.1, 0.2, … , 0.8; 𝑇 = 3, 4, … , 10 days; 𝑝
= 0.1, 0.2, … , 0.8; 𝑐𝑎𝑠𝑒 , 𝑐𝑎𝑠𝑒 =
50, 100, … , 400. In total, 8 = 262,144 parameter combinations were simulated. For comparison, we
also ran a simulation without evacuation for each parameter combination and computed the percentage
change of total cases in the origin and destination counties attributed to evacuation. We selected the top
10% of combinations that lead to the lowest percentage increase (or highest percentage reduction) of

reported cases in the origin county, the destination county and both counties combined, and inspected the
marginal distributions of those six parameters.
Simulating COVID-19 transmission in the US
Following the two-county model analysis, we conducted in-depth COVID-19 simulations using a nationwide metapopulation SEIR model representing all 3,142 US counties 9. In this model, disease transmission
in each county follows SEIR dynamics, but is also influenced by movement to and from other counties.
We consider two types of movement: daily work commuting and random movement. To simulate
movement prior to March 15, 2020, we use information on county-to-county work commuting that is
publicly available from the US Census Bureau. After March 15, the census survey data are no longer
representative due to changes of mobility behavior in response to COVID-19 control measures.
Therefore, in simulating movement after March 15, 2020, we use estimates of the reduction of intercounty visitors to points of interest (POI) (e.g., restaurants, stores, etc.) to inform the decline of intercounty movement on a county-by-county basis. We generated these estimates using data from
SafeGraph56. We further assume the number of random visitors between two counties is proportional to
the average number of commuters between them. As population present in each county is different during
daytime and nighttime, we model the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 separately for these two time
periods. The model equations are presented in the supplementary information. Similar models have been
used to simulate COVID-19 transmission in China 57 and influenza transmission in the United States58,59.
The local effective reproductive number is derived as 𝑅 = 𝛽 𝐷[𝛼 + 𝜇(1 − 𝛼)]𝑆 /𝑁 . To account for
reporting delays in COVID-19 case and death observations, we mapped simulated documented infections
to confirmed cases using a separate observational delay model fitted to the US case data 59.
We calibrated the transmission model against county-level case and death data reported from February
21, 2020 through July 23, 202056,60, which produced an estimate of model parameters and state variables.
We then ran simulations representing the following stages: 3 days of pre-evacuation, 7 days of
evacuation, 3 days of post-evacuation and 14 days after post-evacuation. For comparison, we also ran
simulations without evacuation and increase of transmission rates in origin and destination counties. An
ensemble of 100 trajectories were generated to represent the uncertainty arising from different initial
conditions and stochastic dynamics.
In the modeled hurricane evacuation, 𝑉 evacuees travel from origin 𝑖 to destination 𝑗 and mix with the
local population for 𝑇 = 7 days, before returning to origin 𝑖. As for the two-county model, we
increased the transmission rate in origin counties by 20% during the 3-day pre-evacuation, 7-day
evacuation and 3-day post-evacuation. Three scenarios in which the transmission rate in destination
counties is increased by 0%, 10% and 20% were simulated to compare different effects of hosting
evacuees on local disease transmission.
The greedy algorithm to optimize evacuation
We developed a greedy optimization algorithm aimed at minimizing total excess COVID-19 cases by
strategically assigning evacuees to optimal destination counties. In the evacuation optimization, we
assume that a fraction 𝑝 of evacuees from an origin to a destination won’t change their evacuation plans
(for reasons such as personal connections at the destination or budgetary limitations) and the capacity of
accepting evacuees for each destination 𝑗 is 𝐶 . Denote the baseline evacuation matrix as 𝑽, where 𝑉
represents the number of evacuees from origin 𝑖 to destination 𝑗. The optimization objective is to assign
the rest of evacuees (i.e., (1 − 𝑝) × ∑ 𝑉 from origin 𝑖) to destinations in an optimal way that minimizes

the total infections in both origin and destination counties. Finding the exact solution to this combinatorial
optimization problem is computationally challenging due to the large number of options.
In this study, we use a practically feasible greedy optimization approach that prioritizes moving the unassigned evacuees to destinations with low 𝑅 . Specifically, we start from the evacuation matrix 𝑝𝑽 that
represents evacuees assigned a destination. In each step of greedy search, we run a series of simulations,
each one filling the available evacuee slots in the destination with the lowest 𝑅 from one of the origin
counties. We select the origin county that generates the minimum number of reported cases and assign
them to the destination county. We repeat this greedy search for each successive destination county until
all evacuees are assigned a destination. The pseudo-code for this greedy algorithm is provided in the
supplementary information. In this study, we assume 10% of evacuees from an origin to a destination in
the baseline evacuation matrix 𝑽 cannot be reallocated (i.e., 𝑝 = 0.1), and the capacity of each destination
is 120% of the evacuees in the baseline scenario 𝑽 (i.e., 𝐶 = 1.2 ∑ 𝑉 ).

We formulate COVID-19 transmission as a discrete Markov process during both day and night. Daytime
transmission lasts for 𝑑𝑡 days and the nighttime transmission 𝑑𝑡 days (𝑑𝑡 + 𝑑𝑡 = 1). Here, we
assume daytime transmission lasts for 8 hours and nighttime transmission lasts for 16 hours, i.e., 𝑑𝑡 =
1/3 day and 𝑑𝑡 = 2/3 day. The transmission dynamics are depicted by the following equations.

Here, 𝑆 , 𝐸 , 𝐼 , 𝐼 , 𝑅 and 𝑁 are the susceptible, exposed, reported infected, unreported infected,
recovered and total populations in the subpopulation commuting from county 𝑗 to county 𝑖 (𝑖 ← 𝑗), where
𝑆 = 𝑁 − 𝐸 − 𝐼 − 𝐼 − 𝑅 ; 𝛽 is the transmission rate of reported infections; 𝜇 is the relative
transmissibility of unreported infections; 𝑍 is the average latency period (from infection to
contagiousness); 𝐷 is the average duration of contagiousness; 𝛼 is the fraction of documented infections;
𝜃 is a multiplicative factor adjusting random movement; 𝑁 = (𝑁 + 𝑁 )/2 is the average number of
commuters between counties 𝑖 and 𝑗; and 𝑁 and 𝑁 are the daytime and nighttime populations of
county 𝑖.
The pseudo-code for the greedy optimization algorithm
Input:
Origin 𝑖 = 1, 2, … , 𝑛
Destination 𝑗 = 1, 2, … , 𝑚, where 𝑅 (1) ≥ 𝑅 (2) ≥ ⋯ ≥ 𝑅 (𝑚)
Evacuation matrix 𝑽 = {𝑉 }, 𝑉 is the number of evacuees from origin 𝑖 to destination 𝑗 in the baseline
scenario
Capacity of evacuees that can be accommodated by each destination: 𝐶
The fraction of evacuees that can’t be reallocated for each origin-destination pair: 𝑝
Variables:
𝑢 :: the current number of evacuees in origin 𝑖 that could be reallocated to different counties
𝑣: the currently available destination county with lowest 𝑅 .
𝑴: the current evacuation matrix, 𝑀 is the number of evacuees assigned from origin 𝑖 to destination 𝑣.
Initial conditions:
𝑣=𝑚
𝑢 = (1 − 𝑝) ∑ 𝑉
𝑴 = 𝑝𝑽
Algorithm:
While max(𝑢 ) > 0
For 𝑖 = 1 to 𝑛
𝑴 = 𝑴: reallocating from origin 𝑖 to 𝑣
𝑴 = min 𝑀 + 𝐶 − ∑ 𝑀 , 𝑀 + 𝑢
𝑢
= 𝑢 − (𝑀 − 𝑀 )
Run projection using 𝑀
𝐼𝑛𝑓 : total infection in all origin and destination counties
End
𝑘 = min 𝐼𝑛𝑓

Fig. S1. Comparison of total cases in the origin and destination counties combined (left column), the
origin counties only (middle column) and destination counties only (right column) for the no-evacuation,
baseline, low and high evacuation scenarios. Simulations were performed for three settings: no increase
(top row), 10% increase (middle row) and 20% increase (bottom row) of transmission rates in destination
counties. Box plots show the median and interquartile and whiskers show the 95% CIs. Asterisks indicate
that excess cases are significantly higher than the no-evacuation scenario (Wilcoxon signed rank test, 𝑝 <
10 ).

Fig. S2. Evolution of the total cases (blue lines) and the number of assigned evacuees (red lines) in the
greedy algorithm. Results are shown for the settings with no increase, 10% increase and 20% increase of
transmission rates in destination counties. The optimization starts from an evacuation matrix 0.1 × 𝑽,
where 𝑽 represents the evacuation matrix in the baseline scenario.

Table S1. The median number of total cases in origin and destination counties for different evacuation
scenarios (no evacuation, baseline, low and high) and levels of elevated transmission rates (𝑅 ) in
destination counties (no change, 10% increase, 20% increase). In the no evacuation scenario (𝑅 ) in
destination counties is not increased. Note that the median excess cases shown in Table 1 is not
necessarily the difference of the median total cases between the evacuation and non-evacuation scenarios
