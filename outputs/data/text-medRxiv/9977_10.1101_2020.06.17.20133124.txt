ABSTRACT
Objective: Endothelial cells that are close to the alveolar-capillary exchange membranes
can be activated by SARS-CoV-2 infection leading to cytokine release and macrophage
activation syndrome. This could trigger endothelial dysfunction, pyroptosis, and
immunothrombosis, which are the vascular changes commonly referred to as COVID-19
endotheliopathy. Thus, this study aimed to identify tissue biomarkers associated with
endothelial activation/dysfunction and the pyroptosis pathway in the lung and myocardial
samples of COVID-19 patients and to compare them to pandemic Influenza A virus H1N1
subtype – 2009 and Control cases.
Approach and Results: Post-mortem lung (COVID-19 group=6 cases; H1N1 group=10
cases, and Control group=11 cases) and myocardial samples (COVID-19=2 cases and
control=1 case) were analyzed using immunohistochemistry and the following monoclonal
primary antibodies: anti-CD163, anti-interleukin-6 (IL-6), anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha
(TNF-alpha), anti-intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and anti-caspase-1. From the
result, IL-6, TNF-alpha, ICAM-1, and caspase-1 showed higher tissue expression in the
COVID-19 group than in the H1N1 and control groups.
Conclusion: Our results demonstrated the presence of endotheliopathy and suggest the
participation of the pyroptosis pathway in both the pulmonary and myocardial samples.
These conditions might lead to systemic immunothrombotic events that could impair the
efforts of clinical staff to avoid fatal outcomes. One of the goals of health professionals
should be to identify the high-risk of immunothrombosis patients early to block
endotheliopathy and its consequences.

INTRODUCTION
The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and its rapid spread have caused a
global pandemic. Consequently, on January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO)
declared the pandemic a Public Health Emergency of International Concern–the
Organization's highest alert level,1,2 and since then, the numbers of patients requiring
intensive care treatment have been increasing continuously.
Following the injury in pneumocytes triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection, an
exponential release of inflammatory cytokines (cytokine storm), might be responsible for the
alveolar-capillary endothelial activation. However, the endothelial cells also express ACE-2
type receptors,3 thus alveolar-capillary endothelial activations may be exacerbated by both
the SARS-CoV-2 infection and cytokine storm, after the damage of the alveolar epithelial
barrier via viral injury.4
The pulmonary capillary endothelium, acting as a quiescent barrier and being part of
the gas exchange alveolar-capillary membrane, may switch to a responsive inflammatory

phenotype after its activation, expressing cytokines and vascular adhesion molecules that
could aggravate the cytokine storm,5 and lead to the immunothrombosis phenomena.4,6
Glycocalyx, a multi-component layer of proteoglycans and glycoproteins covering the
luminal pole of the endothelial cells, prevents blood cell rolling and diapedesis by covering
adhesion molecules (intercellular adhesion molecule-1 - ICAM-1), and participates in the
regulation of the coagulation cascade. In this contest, the loss of endothelial cell glycocalyx
can contribute to the breakdown of the vascular homeostasis leading to endothelial
dysfunction.7-11
Some evidence suggests that the peculiar endothelial dysfunction induced by SARSCoV-2 infection differs from that of the other pandemic respiratory diseases, such as
pandemic Influenza A virus H1N1 subtype - 2009 (H1N1pdm09), and could link diffuse
alveolar damage (DAD) with the severe systemic immunothrombosis phenomenon in
patients with severe forms of COVID-19.12 In addition to COVID-19 endothelial activation, the
significant involvement of the pyroptosis mechanism in COVID-19, but not in H1N1pdm09,
may drive massive endothelial cell death thereby contributing to the thrombogenic
mechanism.13,14
Pyroptosis is a specific type of programmed pro-inflammatory cell death15 that uses a
cytosolic complex, called inflammasome. This structure mediates the activation of caspase-1
in response to viruses, foreign substances, and bacteria and their metabolic products.16-18
This article hypothesizes that, unlike the H1N1pdm09, SARS-CoV-2 endothelial
activation followed by pyroptosis, may increase the pro-inflammatory stimuli, leading the
COVID-19 DAD to a severe systemic immune-thrombotic disease that may impair the efforts
of clinical staff to prevent fatal outcomes. Viewed from the intensive care perspective, one
aim is to avoid COVID-19 systemic vascular injury as a way to prevent the almost always
lethal immune-thrombotic phenomenon.
This study aimed to analyze endothelial activation and pyroptosis pathway tissue
biomarkers in patients who died from COVID-19 compared with cases of H1N1pdm09 deaths
and controls.
METHODS
Study population
The COVID-19 group comprised lung samples from post-mortem biopsies of patients
whose cause of death was SARS-CoV-2-induced diffuse alveolar damage during the COVID2019 pandemic. In patients 4 and 6, in addition to the lung, there were myocardial samples.
The clinical data of the six cases were obtained from their medical records during
hospitalization in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at Hospital Marcelino Champagnat in Curitiba,
Brazil. The COVID-19 group (n=6) was approved by the National Research Ethics
Committee (REC: 3.944.734/2020).
The H1N1 group (n=10) comprised lung samples from post-mortem biopsies of
patients whose cause of death was H1N1pdm09 severe acute respiratory infections during
the 2009 pandemic. The clinical data of all the cases were obtained from their medical
records during hospitalization in the ICU at Hospital de Clínicas in Curitiba, Brazil (REC:
2.550.445/2018).
The control group (n=12) comprised of lung (n=11) and myocardial (n=1) samples
from necropsies of patients who died from other causes, not involving lung and myocardial
lesions. The clinical data of all the cases were obtained from their medical records during
hospitalization in the ICU at Hospital de Clínicas in Curitiba, Brazil (REC: 2.550.445/2018).
Testing for H1N1pdm09 and SARS-CoV-2 was performed on nasopharyngeal swabs
taken during ICU hospitalization, and real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain
reaction (rRT-PCR) was positive in all cases. The families of the patients consented to the
post-mortem biopsy for the cases of COVID-19, H1N1 and Control groups.

Minimally invasive lung/myocardial biopsies were performed through a left anterior
mini-thoracotomy with upper left lobe lingular segment and left ventricular wall fragment
resection. The resected pieces were 3x3 cm.
The lung and heart samples provided by post-mortem biopsies/necropsies of all three
groups were formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) and stained with hematoxylin and
eosin (H&E) to find the appropriate areas for the immunohistochemical techniques. The
FFPE lung/heart samples were also performed using immunohistochemical reactions and the
primary monoclonal antibodies, anti-CD163 (rabbit polyclonal, clone 14215, Thermo Fisher
Scientific, 1:1000), IL-6 (mouse monoclonal, clone ab9324, Abcam, 1:400), TNF-alpha
(rabbit polyclonal, clone ab6671, Abcam, 1:100), ICAM-1 (mouse monoclonal, clone 23G12,
Novocastra, 1:100), and caspase-1 (rabbit polyclonal, ab189796, Abcam, 1:200).19
The macrophages score was performed by scoring CD163+ cells in 30 high-power
fields (HPFs). The HPFs were chosen randomly from the septum and lumen alveolar.
The lung tissue immune slides of IL-6, TNF-alpha, and ICAM-1 were scanned on the
Axio Scan Scanner Z1 (Carl Zeiss, Germany). Afterward, 10 HPFs per case were selected
from the area of interest (vessels). The measurement was made only in the vascular
endothelium, and the positive areas appeared through a semi-automatic segmentation
method of quantification, using the Image-Pro Plus software version 4.5 (Media Cybernetics,
USA). Subsequently, these areas were converted into percentages to enable statistical
analysis.
A semiquantitative analysis was performed for caspase-1 using the Allred score in the
endothelial cells of the lung samples. It was obtained by summing two scores (proportion and
intensity of positivity) ranging from 0–8. The proportion score was subdivided according to
the percentage of stained cells: score 0 (0% stained cells), score 1 (<1%), score 2 (1–10%),
score 3 (11–33%), score 4 (34–66%), and score 5 (> 66%). The intensity of positivity was
evaluated as follows: negative - score 0, weak - score 1, moderate - score 2, and strong score 3.20 The scoring was performed taking into account only the vascular endothelium.
The three myocardium immune slides (cases 4 and 6 of the COVID-19 group and one
control patient) were also analyzed using the Allred score for CD163 (macrophages score),
IL-6, TNF-alpha, ICAM-1, and caspase-1.

Statistical analysis
Descriptive analysis was performed using the absolute number and relative
frequencies of the qualitative variables. The quantitative variables were described by means
and standard deviation, and by medians with minimum and maximum values. The normality
condition of the variables in each group was evaluated using the Shapiro-Wilks test. The
Kruskal-Wallis test was used for comparison of the quantitative variables. Data were
analyzed using the computer program R Project for Statistical Computing. Data were
analyzed using the IBM® SPSS Statistics v.20.0 software. Values of p < 0.05 were
considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
The baseline characteristics of COVID-19 patients are presented in Table 1. The lung
sample immunohistochemical results in all groups are presented in Table 1 and Figure 1.
The demographic data were analyzed and presented using the mean and standard
deviation. Comparing the biological sex between the COVID-19 group (male n=4, 66.6%,
female n=2, 33.4%) versus the H1N1 group (male n=8, 80.0%; female n=2, 20.0%), and
found no significant difference (p=0.5510). Similarly, there was no significant difference
(p=0.7933) between the COVID-19 and Control group (male n=8, 72.7%; female n=3,
27.3%). The mean age was significantly (p=0.0040) higher in the COVID-19 group
(76.5±12.5) than in the H1N1 group (43.5±13.9). Similarly, the mean age was significantly

(p=0.0020) higher in the COVID-19 group than in the Control group (42.3±14.3). Survival
days in COVID-19 group (18.8±11.6) were significantly (p=0.0058) higher than in the H1N1
group (4.7±6.1). Comparably, significant differences (p=0.0109) were observed between the
COVID-19 and Control groups (7.6±13.1). Mechanical ventilation was not significantly
(p=0.1851) different between the COVID-19 (9.7±6.8) and the H1N1 group (4.7±6.1).
The histopathological analysis with H&E staining is presented in Supplementary
Figure I. The COVID-19 and H1N1 lung samples presented DAD. There were slight number
of septal and intra-alveolar neutrophils, and numerous small fibrinous thrombi were observed
in the small and medium pulmonary arteries followed by neutrophilic endotheliitis and
endothelial cell tumefaction in the COVID-19 group. However, there was no significant
endothelial activation, fibrinous thrombi, and neutrophilic endotheliitis in the H1N1 cases.
Comparatively, IL-6 (p=0.0652), TNF-alpha (p=0.0092), ICAM-1, and caspase-1
(p=0.0009) were highly expressed in the lung tissues in the COVID-19 group than in the
tissues in the H1N1 group (Figure 1). The same pattern was observed in the COVID-19
compared with the Control group (Table 1).
The immunohistochemical results of myocardial post-mortem biopsies/necropsies are
summarized in Table 1.

myocardial samples (n=2).
DISCUSSION
This study aimed to understand the context of the endothelial activation and
pyroptosis in patients that died of COVID-19 after hospitalization, as these events may have
a possible influence on subsequent thrombogenic events.
Endothelial activation refers to the ability of the endothelium to regulate vascular
homeostasis and mainly describes its imbalance in favor of the pro-inflammatory and
prothrombotic effects.21 Pyroptosis increases the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such
as IL-1 beta and IL-18.22 Infection by SARS-CoV-2 would possibly contribute to endothelial
dysfunction and to the peculiar endothelial cell death called pyroptosis.23 Thus, these two
events could also trigger the subsequent immunothrombotic process that could have a
significant impact on the thrombogenic mortality observed in COVID-19 patients.
The endothelium, without this activation process, provides a suitable luminal surface
that does not promote the activation of the intrinsic coagulation cascade or platelet adhesion,
but anticoagulant and fibrinolytic mechanisms.24 The capillary-alveolar endothelial cells
receive a “shower of cytokines” (IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-alpha) from the pneumocytes infected
by SARS-CoV-2. After that, the endothelial cells are activated and they produce NF-κB and
adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1.25-27 Thus, under these inflammatory conditions, a
subset of leukocytes (polymorphonuclear leukocytes, macrophages, and mast cells)
degranulate enzymes that can contribute to the breakdown of the glycocalyx of the
endothelial cells.28,29 The intact glycocalyx serves as a barrier against the platelets and
leukocytes, and the impairment of its function would help lead to endotheliitis and the
thrombotic events.30-34
The macrophages could amplify the local pro-inflammatory response by an early
recruitment of the complement system.35 Recent reports suggest that the cytokine storm
caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has significant similarities to the findings observed in
macrophage activation syndrome.36 This syndrome is associated with high secretion of
several cytokines, including IFN-gamma, IL-1, IL-6, IL-18, and TNF-alpha.37,38 The
observation of the high number of macrophages (CD163 score) in the COVID-19 group might
suggest the involvement of these cells in the mechanism of COVID-19.
Following this pro-inflammatory pattern, the higher and continuous tissue expression
of IL-6 and TNF-alpha in the COVID-19 group than in the H1N1 and Control groups
(p=0.0652-borderline and p=0.0049; p=0.0092 and p=0.0048, respectively) demonstrate that
inflammatory response may be kept active throughout the evolvement of COVID-19. It is
known that the cytokine profile of patients with COVID-19 showed a marked increase in
interferon-gamma, IL-1, IL-6, and IL-12, at least two weeks after the onset of the disease.39-41

Comparatively, the expression of ICAM-1 in the tissues was significantly higher in the
COVID-19 group (p=0.0034) than in the H1N1 or Control groups. An essential consequence
of endothelial activation is the expression of adhesion molecules such as the ICAM family.
These molecules have the classic function of attracting leukocytes to the infected region and
have the ability to transmit intracellular signals leading and keeping the pro-inflammatory
status, thus perpetuating the innate immune response and subsequently promoting the
systemic activation of the endothelial cells.42,43 The continuous pro-inflammatory condition
would result not only in a dysfunctional endothelium but also lead to the loss of its integrity
via endothelial cell death.44 The persistent inflammatory signaling of these adhesion
molecules would also contribute to later thrombogenic effects. Patients 4 and 5 (respectively
38 and 23 days of survival) showed the highest vascular tissue expression of ICAM-1, and
this observation could be associated with severe thrombotic events that were observed in
these cases.
The relationship between endothelial activation/dysfunction and subsequent
thrombotic events is already well-known in cardiovascular diseases45 and diabetes.46,47 Five
of our cases had comorbidities (data not shown), such as systemic arterial hypertension,
dyslipidemia, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and signs of chronic arterial disease. Thus,
the permanent status of endothelial activation promoted by these comorbidities would
aggravate endothelial dysfunction caused by a viral inflammatory response and could be
responsible for the most prevalent fatal outcome described in these patients.48 Suo and
colleagues49 showed that H1N1pdm09 is responsible for potentiating endothelial cell
apoptosis in patients who already have atherosclerosis. In this context, SARS-CoV-2
infection of the pneumocytes, besides having an essential role in the inflammatory
activation/dysfunction of endothelial cells, would also lead to endothelial cell death, causing
the discontinuity of the alveolar-capillary barrier and facilitating the movement of the virus
from the alveolar septum through the alveolar-capillary lumen. Thus, endothelial cells would
have their glycocalyx layer damaged by leukocytes and would become a further target for
SARS-CoV-2 by binding the ACE-2 receptor, exposed in the endothelial cell membrane.
Pyroptosis is an inflammatory form of programmed cell death, 50 and occurs by
activating a protein complex known as inflammasome that is formed by the union of several
molecules (NLRP3, ASC, and procaspase-1).22,23,51,52 Caspase-1 produces morphological
changes through the creation of membrane pores,53 cell edema, the release of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta and IL-18), and cell fragmentation.54 This final event
resulting from pyroptosis would prevent the replication of pathogens, 55-57 and the interleukin
release would alert the immune system. It has been proposed that pyroptosis could
contribute to the death of endothelial cells after SARS-CoV-2 infection.23 A group of
researchers found that SARS-CoV-2 proteins can trigger the mechanism of cellular
pyroptosis.22 In another study, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)infected macrophages promote high pyroptotic biomarker expression.58 Our results showed
higher endothelial tissue expression of caspase-1 in the COVID-19 group than in the H1N1
and Control groups (p=0.0009). Only the presence of high levels of caspase-1 does not
confirm the occurrence of the pyroptosis process. However, the remarkable presence of one
marker of pyroptosis (caspase-1) is indicative of a probable association of SARS-CoV-2
endothelial infection with this type of inflammatory cell death in endothelial cells.
The presence of a similar pattern of tissue expression in the myocardial samples
(higher tissue expression of CD163 score, IL-6, ICAM-1, TNF-alpha, and Caspase-1 in
COVID-19 patients than in the control patients) might suggest a systemic involvement.
However, the authors understand that the small number of myocardial samples (n=2) only
allows us to conjecture this hypothesis, and further studies would be necessary to prove it.
The main limitations of this study are the small number of cases (n=6)4 and data
based on FFPE post-mortem samples that can only provide a piece of static information at
the time of the death and cannot reconstruct the evolving disease process. A limitation that
might be influencing the expression of biomarkers would be the non-pairing baseline
characteristics in the three groups (age and survival times). However, the COVID-19 and
H1N1 groups are very different demographically from each other because these two

pandemic diseases have marked differences in their risk groups and pathophysiology. In
addition, the survival time is quite different between these two groups, since patients in the
H1N1 group died earlier than has been observed in patients with COVID-19. We paired
these two groups by mechanical ventilation time to minimize the differences in inflammatory
response caused by this type of intervention.
Our results suggest that endothelial activation/dysfunction and pyroptosis, also called
endotheliopathy,59 could lead to a systemic immunothrombotic disease. It is known that
thrombogenic conditions are quite characteristic in COVID-193 patients. Understanding the
complex events that can be part of an immunothrombosis mechanism might help the health
professional identify early patients with the potential of endotheliopathy based on
predisposing comorbidities (chronic renal disease, diabetes, and hypertension) and systemic
biomarkers, such as D-dimer, angiopoitin-2, and thrombomodulin.59,60 The early diagnosis of
endotheliopathy could guide health professionals in implementing therapeutic anticoagulation
and endothelial stabilization in high-risk patients, mitigating thrombogenic events, systemic
inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), and multiple organ failure.
In conclusion, our findings lead us to suggest the involvement of endotheliopathy,
pyroptosis, and immunothrombosis in COVID-19. This immunothrombosis event may be
responsible for the devastating clinical consequences with fatal outcomes in the severe form
of this pandemic disease COVID-19.

Highlights:
-

-

COVID-19 post-mortem lung and myocardial samples showed higher endothelial
expression of IL-6, TNF-alpha, ICAM-1, and caspase-1 than the H1N1 and Control
samples.
There is some evidence of pyroptosis and endotheliopathy in the COVID-19 lung and
myocardial samples compared to the H1N1 and Control samples.
Endotheliopathy and pyroptosis can lead to systemic immunothrombosis that could
impair the efforts of clinical staff to prevent fatal outcomes.
COVID-19 patients could benefit if the high risk of immunothrombosis is identified
early to block the endotheliopathy and its consequences.

Graphical Abstract: SARS-CoV-2 infection followed by macrophage activation (MAS), the
release of cytokines, neutrophil recruitment, endotheliopathy, and pyroptosis, promoting
immunothrombosis that leads to systemic disease.
Figure 1. Graphs showing the comparison between the COVID-19 and H1N1 groups
regarding TNF-alpha, IL-6, ICAM-1 (in percentage per HPF), and caspase-1 tissue
expression (in Allred score). TNF-alpha is remarkably high in the alveolar septal cells (black
arrowheads) and the alveolar-capillary cells (black arrows) of the COVID-19 case than in the
H1N1 case. Alveolar lumens are identified with asterisks. IL-6 tissue expression is
remarkably high in the endothelial cells (black arrows) of the COVID-19 case than in the
H1N1 case. ICAM-1 tissue expression is remarkably higher in the endothelial cells (black
arrows) of the COVID-19 case than in the H1N1 case. Caspase-1 is higher in the endothelial
cells of the COVID-19 case than in the H1N1 case. Kruskal-Wallis test was used for pvalues. Scale bars = 50 micrometers.
Supplementary Figure I. COVID-19 myocardial sample (case 6) expressing caspase-1 in
the endothelium (black arrows). However, the control case did not express caspase-1 in the
endothelial cells (black arrow). ICAM-1 expression in the endothelial cells (black arrows) in
the COVID-19 myocardial sample (case 6) is more pronounced than that in the control case
(black arrow). Endothelial cells and macrophages strongly expressed TNF-alpha (black
arrows) in the COVID-19 myocardial sample (case 4) than in the control case, where TNFalpha is expressed only in the macrophages (black arrow). In the COVID-19 case 3, H&E
conventional staining technique shows vessel (asterisk) with endothelial cell tumefaction and
endotheliitis (left) and diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) characterized by thickened septa and
hyaline membranes (arrowheads).
