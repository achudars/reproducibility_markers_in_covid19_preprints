Abstract
The cold season is usually accompanied by an increased incidence of respiratory infections
and increased air pollution from combustion sources. As we are facing the growing numbers of
COVID-19 cases caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, an understanding of the impact of air
pollutants and meteorological variables on the incidence of respiratory infections is crucial. The
influenza-like illness (ILI) incidence might be used as a close proxy for the circulation of influenza
viruses. Recently, SARS-CoV-2 has also been detected in patients with ILI. Using distributed lag
nonlinear models, we analyzed the association between ILI, meteorological variables and particulate
matter concentration in Bialystok, Poland, from 2013-2019. We found an exponential relation
between cumulative PM2.5 pollution and the incidence of ILI that remained significant after adjusting
for air temperatures and a long-term trend. Pollution had the greatest effect during the same week,
but the risk of ILI was increased for the four following weeks. The risk of ILI was also increased by low
air temperatures, low absolute humidity, and high wind speed. Altogether, our results show that all
measures implemented to decrease PM2.5 concentrations would be beneficial to reduce the
transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory infections.

Capsule summary
Low/medium high concentrations of particulate matter pollution increase the risk of influenza-like
illness. The effect is independent from air temperatures and lasts for the four following weeks.

Background
Particulate matter (PM) is an important air pollutant. It comprises multiple components and
size fractions. The sizes of the inhalable particles are limited to those with aerodynamic diameters of
10 μm or less (PM10). PM10 is the sum of fine particles with aerodynamic diameters of 2.5 μm or less
(PM2.5) and coarse particles with aerodynamic diameters between 2.5 μm and 10 μm (PM10-2.5). PM2.5
originates primarily from combustion sources, while PM10-2.5 is produced by agriculture, mining,
construction activities and road dust resuspension (WHO, 2006). The health effects of particulate
matter may differ because of differences in chemical composition and penetration into the
respiratory tract (Kim et al., 2015). Smaller particles have been shown to be more harmful to human

health than larger particles because of the potential to be deposited in the alveoli and the ability to
cross the lung-blood barrier (Sun et al., 2010). The evidence for airborne particulate matter (PM) and
its public health impact consistently shows adverse health effects at exposure levels that are
currently experienced by urban populations in both developed and developing countries (WHO,
2006). The range of health effects is broad. Exposure to air pollutants has been shown to be the
cause of increased emergency room visits, exacerbation of chronic respiratory and cardiovascular
diseases, decreased lung function, and premature mortality (Kim et al., 2015). In response to the
accumulating evidence on the adverse effects of air pollution, the WHO published air quality
guidelines with daily and annual thresholds for mean concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10. The
guidelines stipulate that PM2.5 concentrations should not exceed the 25 µg/m3 daily mean or 10
µg/m3 annual mean. For PM10, concentration thresholds are 50 µg/m3 and 20 µg/m3 for daily and
annual means, respectively (WHO, 2006).
Based on accumulating evidence, PM increases the incidence of influenza and influenza-like illness
(Huang et al., 2016; Silva et al., 2014; Su et al., 2019). Influenza-like illness (ILI) is a common acute
respiratory syndrome defined by the WHO as fever (>38 °C) with cough or sore throat, which began
in the last 10 days (Fukuda and WHO, 2009). Each year, ILI imposes a significant burden to public
health and leads to substantial morbidity and economic costs (Feng et al., 2020; Tsai et al., 2014).
According to the latest WHO database of observed annual mean PM2.5 concentrations, air
quality in Poland is considered unsafe, with many of Europe’s 50 most polluted cities located in
Poland (“Air quality statistics — European Environment Agency,” 2020). High pollution levels in Polish
cities are caused mainly by coal power plants and residential heating with wood and coal (JudaRezler et al., 2020). Following the recognition that Poland is facing high air pollution levels,
researchers have focused on the associated health effects. However, little is known about the
influence of air pollution on the respiratory infection incidence in Poland. In a recent study, Slama et
al. reported a positive association between air pollutants and hospitalizations for respiratory disease
in Polish cities (Slama et al., 2019). This and other studies have shown that people exposed to air
pollutants may be at high risk for infection within a lag period from zero to ten days, which
represents the usual incubation periods of respiratory infections (Huang et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2019;
Xu et al., 2013). Little is known about the effect of air pollution on respiratory infections beyond a lag
of two weeks.
The current COVID-19 outbreak has been caused by the emergence of a new coronavirus,
SARS-CoV-2, that very quickly spread in the human population. A similarity between COVID-19 and ILI
symptoms has been observed. The presence of SARS-CoV-2-positive swabs in patients with ILI has
been reported in several studies (Boëlle et al., 2020; Kong et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020, p. 2).
Moreover, air pollution was suggested to be a major factor contributing to the aggressive spread of
this virus (Conticini et al., 2020). Cases of COVID-19 in Poland have been increasing since September
2020, and with the beginning of the cold season, an increase in air pollution is expected.
Meteorological variables play an important role in the physical and chemical transformation of PM
and its horizontal and vertical transport (Degórska et al., 2016). Therefore, we aimed to assess the
association between the risk of ILI and air pollution over longer time lags, considering the potential
influences of meteorological variables and long-term trends.

Figure 1. The geographical location of Bialystok and Bialystok County in northeastern Poland.

Influenza-like illness data
Bialystok is the largest city in northeastern Poland and one of the largest cities in Poland in terms of
population density (2913.8 people per sq. km). Bialystok City and Bialystok County cover an area of
3086.76 square kilometers and are inhabited by approximately 435,000 people, 297,000 (68%) of
whom live in Bialystok City (“Statistics Poland - Local Data Bank,” 2020). The city has a warm humid
continental climate (Merkel, 2020).
The data on the number of suspected influenza and influenza cases in Bialystok city and Bialystok
County (Figure 1) were obtained from the Department of Epidemiology of the Municipal Sanitary and
Epidemiological Station. Influenza is a notifiable disease in Poland. The Department collects all
reports of confirmed and suspected influenza cases that come from all hospitals and all outpatient
clinics located in the city and county. Reports of confirmed and suspected influenza cases (ICD-10
codes: J10.0, J10.1, J10.8, J11.0, J11.1, and J11.8) are submitted manually by hospitals and clinics
with no automated reporting system integrated with medical document management software. The
data are then reported weekly by the Municipal Sanitary and Epidemiological Station. No data on the
percentage of confirmed cases in the total reported number are available. Therefore, throughout the
manuscript, both confirmed and suspected influenza cases are analyzed jointly as ILIs.

Meteorological and air pollution data
The data on the concentrations of air pollutants were obtained from two fixed stations, Waszyngtona
Street and Warszawska Street, which are located in the city center 2 kilometers apart and have a
maximum distance to the city borders of 6 kilometers. The concentrations of PM2.5 were measured
with BAM 1020 (Met One Instruments Inc., OR, USA) (Waszyngtona Street), and the concentration of
PM10 was measured with TEOM 1405F (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) (Warszawska Street).
Daily meteorological data (air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, precipitation,
precipitation and sunshine duration) for the analyzed period were obtained from the Institute of
Meteorology and Water Management. Absolute humidity was calculated from temperature and
relative humidity. For statistical analyses, we used mean weekly values. We found that 6% of the
mean daily concentrations of PM2.5 were missing. Weeks with missing data for more than five days
were excluded from the analysis.

Statistical analysis
The patient and meteorological data collected from January 2013 to December 2019 were
sorted, categorized according to weeks, and preliminarily analyzed with a simple correlation analysis
(Spearman’s r). Then, the association between meteorological factors, air pollution and the incidence
of ILI was further studied with distributed lag nonlinear models (DLNMs) developed by Gasparrini
(Gasparrini et al., 2010). The DLNM framework enables the modeling of the exposure-response
relationship together with the lag-response relationship; thus, it enables the modeling of delayed
effects after a specific exposure. In this paper, we used the DLNM to investigate the relationship
between the incidence of ILI, meteorological factors and air pollution expressed as the levels of PM2.5
and PM10. The delayed effects of the abovementioned environmental factors have also been studied.
The modeling of the relationship between the incidence of ILI and the environmental factors
was performed for the following meteorological factors: air temperature, relative humidity, absolute
humidity, sunshine duration, precipitation, precipitation duration, and wind speed and for air
pollution expressed as the levels of PM2.5 and PM10. Poisson regression models with a quasi-Poisson
function were used for the analysis to address the issue of the overdispersion of the response data
(counts of ILI cases). The number of ILI cases was included in the model as the dependent variable,
while the considered environmental factors were included as independent variables. The following
formula represents the model structure:
log ௧ 

௜ , 

 , , ,  

, 

where E(Yt) represents the weekly number of ILI cases in week t, α is the intercept, Xi represents the
environmental factors (temperature, etc.), ns is the natural cubic spline, PM is the concentration of
particulate matter, df represents the degree of freedom, and Time represents the long-term trend.
Initially, the analysis was performed for each environmental factor separately, and then the
models adjusted for air pollutant levels were fitted to the data. Because of the relatively strong
correlations between the meteorological factors, one meteorological factor, one air pollutant and
the long-term trend were included in each model. The Akaike Information Criterion for quasi-Poisson
function (qAIC) was used to select the degrees of freedom for environmental factors (1-10 df) and for
the maximum number of lag weeks included in the model (Burnham and Anderson, 1998). According
to the results of the performed analysis (lowest value of qAIC) and previous studies (Feng et al., 2016,
p. 5; Liang et al., 2014; Vandini et al., 2013), we decided to include the delayed effects for PM2.5 and
for wind speed. The effects of the meteorological factors temperature, wind speed and precipitation
were modeled using 1 df, sunshine duration 4 df, humidity 3 df and precipitation duration 2 df. For
wind speed, the maximum lag of 2 weeks was included (a range of 1-8 maximum weeks of lag). The
effects of air pollution caused by PM2.5 and PM10 were modeled by ns of 1 df, and for PM2.5, the
maximum lag of 5 weeks was also included. The maximum lag was chosen based on the qAIC and the
stability of the shape of the risk of the ILI-PM2.5 relationship. The long-term trend was modeled using
ns with 1df/year.
The reference levels were defined as the median values of each of the analyzed variables to
calculate relative risks (RRs). The sensitivity analysis was performed by calculating the qAIC and
changing df for environmental variables.
The statistical analysis was performed using R software, version 3.6.2, with the packages
dlnm, mgcv and bbmle.

During the analyzed period, 345,987 cases were reported, of which 155,249 (45%) were
children under the age of 15, and 31,179 (9%) were individuals over 65 years of age (Table S1 in the
Supplementary materials). The incidence rate based on the number of reported cases was 11.4 (95%
CI, 11.3-11.5) episodes per 100 person-years. Data on the sex of the patients were unavailable. The
median number of cases in a week was 700 (range from 0 cases to 6,309 cases). The number of ILI
cases peaked once in each season, in January and February, when the mean temperatures
approached 0 °C (Figure S1 in the Supplementary materials).

The analysis of Spearman correlations showed that the incidence of ILI was positively
correlated with weekly mean values of relative humidity, wind speed, precipitation duration,
concentration of PM2.5 and concentration of PM10. In contrast, weekly mean values for temperature,
precipitation, and sunshine durations were negatively correlated with the incidence of ILI (Table S3 in
in the Supplementary materials). When correlations were analyzed in the peak of the flu season only
(December – February), ILI cases correlated with PM2.5 (R=0.31, p=0.007), PM10 (R=0.27; p=0.02),
mean temperature (R= -0.25; p=0.02), and absolute humidity (R= -0.30; p=0.005). No correlation with
relative humidity, wind speed, sunshine duration or precipitation was observed in that time frame.

Figure 2. The association between environmental factors and the relative risk (RR) with 95%
confidence interval (CI) of influenza-like illness. The analysis was performed for each environmental
factor separately. The reference levels were defined as the median values of each of the analyzed
variables to calculate RRs.
For each of the variables described above, a DLNM model illustrating the relationship
between the number of ILI cases and the values of the considered variable was fitted. The delayed
effect was included for PM2.5. The results of the model estimation are presented as relative risks
(RRs) and are shown in Figure 2. For each considered environmental variable, the association
between the RR of ILI and the values of weekly means of the covariate are shown. As shown in Figure
2, the weekly mean temperature and weekly mean concentrations of PM2.5 were the most significant
risk factors exponentially associated with the incidence of ILI, as evidenced by the highest relative
risks (RRs). The values of the coefficient of determination (R2) were 0.523 and 0.563, respectively,
which indicates that over 50% of variability in the dependent variable is explained by the models. The
RR of the cold effect at the 5th percentile (–5.51 °C) was 2.81 (95% CI, 2.51-3.13) and increased to
4.89 (95% CI, 4.13-5.80) at the minimum value (–12.9 °C) compared to the median (7.99 °C).
Compared to the median, the RR of the high air pollution effect at the 95th percentile of the PM2.5
concentration was 13.18 (95% CI, 9.02-19.28), increasing to 19.92 (95% CI, 12.82-30.95) at the
maximum value. The RRs of concentrations of PM10 were 3.34 (95% CI, 2.66-4.19) at the 95th
percentile and 4.08 (95% CI, 3.13-5.32) at the maximum value compared to the median (R2 = 0.343).
The relative humidity displayed a weak U-shaped relation with the number of cases. The RRs of the
dry and moist effects at the 5th and 95th percentiles, respectively, were insignificant because 95% CIs
included a null risk of one. The RR of the relative humidity effect peaked at 90% and reached 1.47
(95% CI, 1.23-1.75; R2, 0.256). The dry and moist effects were analyzed again using the absolute
humidity calculated from relative humidity and temperature. The RR at the 5th percentile of absolute
humidity (3 g/m3) was 2.61 (95% CI, 2.36-2.88), whereas at the 95th percentile (13 g/m3), the RR was

0.24 (95% CI, 0.20-0.28; R2, 0.573). The RR of the high wind speed effect was 3.20 (95% CI, 2.36-4.34;
R2, 0.219) at the 95th percentile (4 m/s). The RR of the effect of low sunshine hours (0 hours) was 1.83
(95% CI, 1.36-2.44) and that of the low precipitation (0 mm) effect was 1.37 (95% CI, 1.19-1.57). In
contrast, the effect of the precipitation duration was positive and peaked at 9 hours (RR, 1.68; 95%
CI, 1.34-2.11; R2, 0.274); however, that effect was insignificant at the 95th percentile (12 hours).
Subsequently, these models were adjusted for PM2.5. The adjusted RRs of the cold effect
were 2.29 (95% CI, 2.03-2.58) at the 5th percentile and 3.57 (95% CI, 2.97-4.3) at the minimum value
(R2 = 0.703). The effect of adjusted PM10 was 1.67 (95% CI, 1.19-2.34) at the 95th percentile and 1.82
(95% CI, 1.22-2.69) at the maximum value (R2 = 0.548). The highest RR values of relative humidity
effects after including PM2.5 concentrations decreased to 1.15 (95% CI, 1.05-1.25) at a relative
humidity of 86%. When absolute humidity was analyzed, the adjusted RR of the dry effect at the 5th
percentile was 2.14 (95% CI, 1.93-2.38). The adjusted RR of the moisture effect at the 95th percentile
of absolute humidity was 0.32 (95% CI, 0.27-0.37; R2, 0.723). The adjusted RR of the high wind speed
effect was 2.82 (95% CI, 2.20-3.63; R2, 0.603). The adjusted RR of the effect of low sunshine hours (0
hours) was 1.35 (95% CI, 1.07-1.71; R2, 0.616) and that of low precipitation (0 mm) was 1.15 (95% CI,
1.02-1.29; R2, 0.576). The adjusted effect of the precipitation duration peaked at 11 hours (RR, 1.48;
95% CI, 1.09-2.01; R2, 0.585) but was insignificant at the 95th percentile (12 hours).

Considering that temperature is the main driver of ILI of all meteorological factors, the air
pollution effect was adjusted for mean temperatures (Figure 3). The adjusted RRs of the PM2.5
concentrations were 3.85 (95% CI, 2.72-5.45) at the 95th percentile and 4.77 (95% CI, 3.19-7.15) at
the maximum value. The adjusted RRs of the PM10 concentrations were 1.42 (1.15-1.75) and 1.50
(1.17-1.92) at the 95th percentile and the maximum value, respectively (R2 = 0.534). Based on the
considered DLNM models, the model including PM2.5, temperature and long-term data shows the
most significant association with the dynamics of ILI prevalence (R2=0.703). Figure 4 shows the
observed and predicted numbers of ILI cases in the considered time period.

long-term trend as covariates) number of influenza-like illness cases. R2=0.703
Additionally, we considered that PM10 reflects the concentrations of both fine (PM2.5) and
coarse particles (PM10-2.5), and therefore the RRs of the PM10 pollution effect were analyzed in a
model including the concentration of PM2.5 as a covariate (data not shown). After including PM2.5 in
the model, the RRs of the PM10 effect were 1.67 (95% CI, 1.19-2.34) at the 95th percentile and 1.82
(95% CI, 1.22-2.69) at the maximum value. Furthermore, we assessed the RRs of the cold effect
adjusted for the concentrations of both PM2.5 and PM10. The adjusted RRs of the cold effect were
2.42 (95% CI, 2.01-2.57) at the 5th percentile and 3.54 (95% CI, 2.92-4.28) at the minimum value.
The estimated effects of the PM2.5 concentrations were plotted against lag weeks in a model
including weekly mean temperatures and a long-term trend as covariates to identify the cumulative
effects of PM2.5 on ILI cases (Figure 5 A and B). The effect of PM2.5 decreased over time but remained
significant for lag weeks 0 through 4. The RRs (95% CIs) at the 95th percentile were 1.45 (1.31-1.61),
1.37 (1.26-1.48), 1.29 (1.21-1.36), 1.21 (1.15-1.27), 1.14 (1.08-1.21), and 1.08 (0.99-1.16) at lag weeks
0 through 5, respectively. We estimated that a 10 µg/m3 increase in the mean weekly PM2.5
concentration (an increase from 20 to 30 µg/m3) caused a 16% increase in the risk of ILI (RR, 1.16;
95% CI; 1.11-1.21) in the same week (lag 0). That risk decreased over time (Figure 5 C). The estimates
for the five following weeks (lag 1-5) were as follows: 1.13 (95% CI, 1.10-1.17), 1.11 (95% CI, 1.081.13), 1.08 (95% CI, 1.06-1.10), 1.05 (95% CI, 1.03-1.08), and 1.03 (95% CI, 1.00-1.06).

Discussion
Air pollution may increase the incidence of a wide range of diseases, including heart disease,
stroke, and lung cancer (Brunekreef and Holgate, 2002; Laden et al., 2000; Polichetti et al., 2009;
Raaschou-Nielsen et al., 2013). Numerous studies have confirmed that exposure to ambient air
pollutants is strongly associated with the local transmission of respiratory infections (Chen et al.,
2010; Domingo and Rovira, 2020; Feng et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2016; Silva et al., 2014; Su et al.,
2019). This study provides additional evidence for the association between air pollution and ILI. We
have shown that the cumulative effect of an increase in the PM2.5 concentration is exponentially
associated with the increase in ILI risk in Bialystok, Poland, after adjusting for air temperature and a
long-term trend. The distributed lag nonlinear analysis including PM2.5, temperature and a long-term
trend as covariates showed that the model was able to explain as much as 70% of the variability in
the number of observed ILI cases in Bialystok, Poland in 2013-2019. The concentration of PM2.5 in
Bialystok throughout the study frequently exceeded the levels recommended by the WHO. However,
in our study, the mean PM2.5 concentrations were several times lower than those reported in
previous studies linking air pollution to ILI (Feng et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2016). Nevertheless, the
effect of ambient air pollution on the ILI incidence was evident, indicating that the relationship is not
limited to highly polluted regions. Moreover, the high pollution effect extended beyond the
incubation periods of influenza and other respiratory tract infections, which are usually shorter than
two weeks (Stellrecht, 2017). Our results show that high concentrations of PM2.5 increase the risk of
ILI during the same week (lag 0) and for up to 4 subsequent weeks (lag weeks 1-4). Therefore, the
underlying mechanisms linking air pollution and the incidence of respiratory infections are not
limited to acute effects only.
The leading epidemiological concept of respiratory infections is that infections are spread by
direct transmission from person to person, such as touching an infected person or touching the
fomites that the infected person has contaminated. Respiratory droplets can also be deposited
directly on a person in close proximity to the infected person. However, after droplets are expired,
the liquid content starts to evaporate. Some droplets become so small that they are free to travel in
the air and carry pathogens contained inside over tens of meters from where they originated.
Previous studies have suggested that airborne transmission should be considered possible in
infections caused by influenza viruses (Cowling et al., 2013; Hammond et al., 1989; Tellier, 2009;
Tellier et al., 2019). The same might be hypothesized for ILI, even though pathogens other than
influenza virus are frequently detected in ILI patients [38]. In multiple studies airborne transmission

was suggested to participate in the spread of different respiratory pathogens responsible for ILI like,
parainfluenza viruses (Burke et al., 2013), RSV (Aintablian et al., 1998; Kulkarni et al., 2011),
rhinoviruses (Dick et al., 1987; Myatt et al., 2004), adenoviruses (Couch et al., 1966; Echavarria et al.,
2000), human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 (da Silva et al., 2020, p. 2; Morawska and Cao,
2020, p. 2; Yu et al., 2004), and other pathogens (Tang et al., 2006).
Particulate matter was suggested to serve as a vector for the transport of pathogenic
microorganisms (Chen et al., 2010; Griffin et al., 2001). The airborne transmission of pathogens
further depends on their survival in aerosolized droplets, which in turn is subject to variations in
temperature, humidity, and solar radiation (Sooryanarain and Elankumaran, 2015). For example,
influenza virus transmission is most efficient under cold, dry conditions (Lowen and Steel, 2014).
Both correlation and DLNM analyses revealed that temperature, absolute humidity, and wind speed
were the meteorological factors that best predicted ILI activity in Bialystok, Poland. Other factors,
including precipitation, sunshine duration and relative humidity, showed lower correlations with the
incidence of ILI. Similar observations were reported in an analysis conducted in other Northern
European countries (Ianevski et al., 2019). Relative humidity was not predictive of ILI cases in our
study. In the nonlinear analysis, an increasing trend towards low and high RH values with a decreased
risk was observed at intermediate RH. Thus, both high and low values of RH facilitate the spread of
ILI. The results of experimental studies are consistent with these observations. In laboratory settings,
influenza virus was maximally stable at low RH, minimally stable at mid-range RH, and moderately
stable at high RH (Lowen et al., 2007; Schaffer et al., 1976). However, humidity is also reported as
absolute humidity defined as the absolute amount of water in the air. We found that absolute
humidity was a better predictor of ILI seasonality than relative humidity. Decreasing AH exponentially
increased the risk of ILI, even if particulate matter was included in the model. Similar observations
were documented in previous studies (Shoji et al., 2011; Tamerius et al., 2013). A positive association
between ILI cases and wind speed was also noted. The effect remained significant for up to three
weeks after exposure (lag weeks 0-2). Wind was shown to promote the spread of various viruses over
short and large distances (Sundell et al., 2016; Ypma et al., 2013). We hypothesize that wind
facilitates the spread of ILI by transporting aerosolized pathogens in the area. The calculated lag
effect of two weeks possibly reflects the maxiumum incubation period of respiratory pathogens
causing ILI. Although the wind-borne route alone is insufficient to explain the seasonality of ILI, we
show that it contributes substantially to the increase in the risk of infection.
Meteorological variables affect the concentration of particulate matter in the air; however,
the interplay between these two factors is complicated. We found negative correlations between PM
temperature, absolute humidity, and precipitation. The negative correlation between PM and
temperature might be explained by emissions due to residential heating in the cold season (Degórska
et al., 2016). Studies linking humidity and PM have shown conflicting results. In the analysis from the
state environmental monitoring program in Poland (Degórska et al., 2016), the authors described
significant negative correlations between PM10 and RH observed in the warm season from April to
September. However, a study from the USA reported a positive correlation between RH and PM2.5
concentrations in several regions (Tai et al., 2010). These contradictory results may be explained by
the relative abundance of each component of the PM. Sulfates and nitrates were shown to be
positively related to RH, reflecting in-cloud sulfate formation and the RH-dependent ammonium
nitrate formation. The correlation between RH and carbons is negative, which possibly reflects
sources from fires and combustion (Tai et al., 2010). Moreover, increased RH may be accompanied
by precipitation. Rainfall has a washing effect on the levels of PM2.5 in the air (Ouyang et al., 2015). In
the absence of precipitation, PM was suggested to act as condensation nucleus for water and virus
particles (Chen et al., 2010; Griffin et al., 2001; Liu et al., 2018).

Notably, pathogens causing ILI differ in structure; thus, meteorological factors probably exert
distinct effects on their transmission, making the data difficult to interpret. However, fluctuations in
ILI activity in the community are affected not only by the transmission and survival of pathogens in
the environment but also by host susceptibility. Exposure to air pollutants impacts the host response
to infections. The underlying possible mechanisms related to this process are complex (Ciencewicki
and Jaspers, 2007). Ambient air pollution likely disrupts host defenses, including both innate and cellmediated immune responses against infections. Exposure to PM containing environmentally
persistent free radicals (EPFRs), which are found in most combustion-derived PM, was shown to
cause pulmonary oxidative stress, which leads to local immunosuppression and the exacerbation of
influenza in mice (Lee et al., 2014; Saravia et al., 2014). Another study reported enhanced viral
attachment and entry due to exposure to diesel exhaust (Jaspers et al., 2005). Particulate matter can
also activate inflammatory signaling cascades, change macrophage morphology (Li et al., 2010; Yang
et al., 2019) and precipitate tissue remodeling in the lung (Pinkerton et al., 2000). Exposure to PM2.5
alters the expression of multiple genes in lung tissue (Sancini et al., 2014). Importantly, the
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor present on the cells was overexpressed following
exposure to PM2.5. Thus, PM might plausibly increase the probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as
ACE2 is the key receptor mediating virus entry (Comunian et al., 2020, p. 19).
The study is subject to some limitations. First, we only used two air pollution measurement
sources from Bialystok City, limiting the spatial representativeness of the present analysis. People
living outside Bialystok City might have been exposed to slightly different air pollution levels. A vast
majority of residents of this area live in towns with similar levels of urban development; therefore,
we believe that pollution levels in Bialystok city can serve as a close proxy for the county. Second, our
data might potentially suffer from underreporting of influenza cases. In our opinion, underreporting
tends to occur in consistent patterns throughout the years; hence, the seasonal variation in ILI cases
still reflects the true burden of ILI in the region. Third, we did not stratify the relative risks by age
group. As previously shown, the effects of air pollution depend on age (Feng et al., 2016). Our results
cannot be generalized to the entire population, and the calculated relative risks should be
interpreted with caution.
In conclusion, our study describes a clear association between PM2.5 pollution and the
incidence of ILI in northeastern Poland, despite the relatively low concentrations of particulate
matter recorded in the study period. Pollution exerted the greatest effect during the same week, but
the risk of ILI was increased in the four subsequent weeks. Because SARS-CoV-2 cases are still
increasing, further studies elucidating the mechanisms linking air pollution and susceptibility to acute
respiratory infections are urgently needed. Altogether, our study indicates that all measures
implemented to decrease PM2.5 concentrations would be beneficial to reduce the transmission of
COVID-19 and other respiratory infections.
