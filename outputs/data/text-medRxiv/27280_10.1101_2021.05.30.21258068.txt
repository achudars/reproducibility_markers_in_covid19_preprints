Abstract
Background and Objective: Mucormycosis, a serious and rare fungal infection, has
occurred concurrently in COVID-19 patients globally. Mucormycosis is associated with a
high risk of all-cause mortality, with mortality depending on body site infected, fungus type,
and the patient’s overall condition. This deadly fungal infection is quite difficult and
expensive to treat. Therefore, this scoping review aims to map all the empirical evidence on
the COVID-19 associated mucormycosis with a special focus on clinical presentation,
treatment, and patient outcomes.
Methods: The proposed scoping review will be developed by adhering to the JBI
methodology for scoping reviews and will be reported as per the Preferred Reporting Items
for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). A detailed
search strategy has already been utilized to locate both published and unpublished studies.
Literature search was carried out in three phases. PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, Google scholar
was searched. We will include all those studies which are presenting mucormycosis cases in
COVID-19 positive patients. Data will be extracted in a pre-designed data extraction sheet
and risk of bias will be assessed using JBI critical appraisal tool. The primary outcome will
be to summarize the clinical presentation, treatment, and patient outcomes in COVID-19
associated mucormycosis. Data will be presented in tabular form.

Introduction
The COVID-19 outbreak, caused by severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-2
(SARS-CoV-2), has infected more than 164 million people globally with approximately 3.4
million deaths.[1] COVID-19 patients often have several co-morbidities including
diabetes.[2] Ample evidence has proved patients with co-morbidities to be at a higher risk of
ICU admissions and mortality than those without comorbidities.[3-5] COVID-19 patients in
severe stages (admitted to ICUs), are prescribed high-doses of steroids as a life saving
measure.[6] Steroids, supress the immune system (decrease in CD4 + T and CD8 + T cells) to
fight against the inflammation caused by the virus, thereby creating a favourable environment
for other opportunistic infections.[6, 7] Mucormycosis, a serious and rare fungal infection,
has occurred concurrently in COVID-19 cases globally.[8] Mucormycosis, also known as
black fungus, is an invasive fungal infection most commonly caused by fungi–Rhizpous.[9]
This deadly fungal infection is quite difficult and expensive to treat. At the moment more
detailed evidence on the clinical presentation, treatment and patient outcomes is required. The
preliminary search for existing scoping reviews was performed in Epistemonikos,
PROSPERO, Open Science Framework, Cochrane Library and JBI Evidence Synthesis and
no previous scoping reviews were identified.
Objective
This scoping review will be conducted to map all empirical evidence on the COVID-19
associated mucormycosis, with a special focus on clinical presentation, treatment, and patient
outcomes.
Methods
The proposed scoping review will be developed by adhering to the JBI methodology for
scoping reviews and will be reported as per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Reviews and Meta-analyses for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR).[10, 11]
Search strategy
A detailed search strategy has already been utilized to locate both published and unpublished
studies. Literature search was carried out in three phases. First, an initial limited search was
undertaken in PubMed, using keywords and index terms related to COVID-19, SARA-CoV2,
mucormycosis, and black fungus. An analysis of the text words contained in the title and
abstract and the index terms used to describe the articles was then followed. A second search

using all identified keywords and index terms was conducted in all included databases
(PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, Google scholar). Refer Appendix 1 for the detailed search
strategy. Third, the reference lists of all studies that met the inclusion criteria were checked
for other additional records followed by citation tracking. Gray literatures were located using
Cochrane COVID-19 study register, bioRxiv, and medRxiv. COVIDENCE will be use to
complete this scoping review (Covidence systematic review software, Veritas Health
Innovation, Melbourne, Australia. Available at www.covidence.org).

Study selection
Two independent reviewers (SH and HB) will be screening all the retrieved articles in
alignment to the inclusion criteria. In the initial screening phase, articles will be selected
based on the title and abstract scanning. Then, in the second phase, full-text screening will be
performed for the final inclusion of articles in the scoping review. PRISMA flow diagram
will depict each stage of the study selection process.

Inclusion criteria
Participants: Patients with confirmed COVID-19 (RT-PCR) and mucormycosis (either
histologically or microbiologically confirmed)
Concept: This review will include all studies that describe the clinical presentation,
treatment, and patient outcomes.
Context: We will focus on the clinical studies discussing the clinical presentation, treatment,
and patient outcomes in COVID-19 patients with mucormycosis.
Type of sources: We will include descriptive studies (case-report, case-series, crosssectional) and epidemiological studies.
We will exclude:
•

Non-English language studies

•

Studies with no clear information about mucormycosis and other criteria’s

•

Systematic reviews, narrative reviews, editorials, opinions, correspondence, and study
protocols will be excluded

Assessment of risk of bias
The methodological quality of the selected studies will be evaluated using the Jonna Briggs
Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tool. An appropriate JBI risk-of-bias tool will be adapted
according to the study design of the studies qualified for inclusion in this scoping review.

Depending on the response of each domain of the tool, the study will be classified as high,
low or unclear risk of bias.
Data analysis and presentation
Two reviewers (SH and HB) will independently extract the data in a pre-designed data
extraction template. Following information will be extracted from all eligible studies
qualified for inclusion: Study author, year of publication, country, study design,
characteristics of the population (age, sex), sample size, co-morbidities, treatment for
COVID-19, symptoms of mucormycosis, diagnosis of mucormycosis, identification of fungal
species, treatment for mucormycosis, and patient outcomes. Data will be descriptively
presented for each outcome.
