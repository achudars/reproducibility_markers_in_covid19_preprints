Running Title: "Triplet" RT-qPCR ofr SARS-CoV-2.
Keywords: SARS-CoV-2, RT-qPCR, CDC.

Abstract.
The CDC designed "FDA Emergeny Use Autorization" 2019-nCoV CDC RT-qPCR kit uses 3 different
FAM probes for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis so 3 reactions per sample are needed. We herein describe a
sample pooling protocol: 3 RNA extractions are combined into a single PCR reaction. The sensitivity for
this protocol is 100% as no shift on Ct values for N1 or N2 probes were observed. For a typical 96-well
plate, triplet assay allows 96 samples processing, speeding up diagnosis.

Introduction.
Several in vitro diagnosis RT-qPCR kits are available on the market for the detection of SARSCoV-2. Some of them have received emergency use authorization (EUA) from the U.S. Food &
Drug Administration (FDA), like 2019-nCoV CDC EUA from the USA Center for Diseases
Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC assay is based on N1 and N2 probes to detect SARSCoV-2 and RNaseP as an RNA extraction quality control (1). According to CDC protocol for
2019-nCoV CDC EUA, the 3 probes are FAM labelled so 3 PCR reactions are needed for each
specimen diagnosis. With no triplex PCR protocol validated for N1, N2 and RNaseP, the current
CDC protocol reduces daily sampling processing capacity for a typical 96 well plate PCR device.
On developing countries like Ecuador, most of clinical microbiology laboratories running SARSCoV-2 diagnosis operates with a single Real Time PCR device. Under this scenario, pooling
samples while keeping sensitivity is a powerful tool to increase SARS-CoV-2 testing capacity.
Also, testing costs are reduced and supply shortage may be mitigated by using a pooling sample
protocol, crucial to support surveillance at developing countries.
This study evaluates the performance of a sample pooling RT-qPCR protocol where 3 RNA
samples ("triplet") are loaded into the same RT-qPCR reaction for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis by
using 2019-nCoV CDC EUA kit (IDT, USA).
Methods.
Study setting. 114 clinical specimens (nasopharyngeal swabs collected on 0.5mL TE pH 8
buffer) from individuals selected during SARS-CoV-2 surveillance in Galapagos Islands started
on April 8th 2020, were included on the evaluation study. Also, eight negative controls (TE pH 8
buffer) were included as control for carryover contamination. "LabGal" at "Agencia de

Regulacion y Control de la Bioseguridad y Cuarentena para Galapagos" at Puerto Ayora in
Galapagos Islands (Ecuador) is the only available SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis laboratory on site,
operating with a single 96 well plate PCR device (CFX96 from BioRad) to cover a population
above 25.000 people.
RNA Extraction and RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. Samples were tested following an
adapted version of the CDC protocol: (1) using PureLink Viral RNA/DNA Mini Kit (Invitrogen,
USA) as an alternate RNA extraction method; (2) using CFX96 BioRad instrument. We
performed this protocol for 38 SARS-CoV-2 positive and 76 negative samples individually, but
also pooling one positive sample with two negative samples at the RT-PCR reaction mix. While
4 uL of a single RNA was added to a single RT-PCR reaction, 2 uL of each RNA was added to
the triplet RT-PCR reaction.
Statistics. For statistical analysis of Ct values, t-student test was performed using Excel.
Ethics statement. All samples have been submitted for routine patient care and diagnostics. The
study was approved by the "Comité de Operaciones Especiales Regional de Galápagos" that is
leading board for the Covid19 surveillance in Galapagos Islands. No extra specimens were
specifically collected for this validation study. All data used in the current study was anonymized
prior to being obtained by the authors.
Results.
We found no significant differences for Ct values between the single and triplet RT-qPCR
reaction: 31,30 ± 3,69 vs 31,16 ± 4,04 for N1 (p= 0.72); 34,09 ± 3,83 vs 33,25 ± 3,96 for N2
(p=0.14). Results are detailed on Table 1 and 2. The assay was validated to detect 10 viral RNA
copies/uL by using 2019-nCoV N positive control (IDT, USA). All 38 samples that tested

positive for the single sample RT-qPCR were also positive for the triplet RT-qPCR, so the
sensitivity triplet sample pooling protocol was 100%.
Discussion
Our results support the use of a triplet RT-qPCR protocol for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis without
compromising the sensitivity compared to single sample RT-qPCR protocol. This protocol is an
easy way to speed up SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis when using the CDC RT-qPCR protocol: the need
of three PCR reactions per sample due to FAM labelling for the three probes is corrected by
pooling samples in triplets for PCR. This allows to optimize number of samples per running at a
typical 96 well PCR device like the one used in our "LabGal" laboratory at Galapagos Islands.
For small scale labs at developing countries like Ecuador, this is an alternative way for reagents
savings and increase diagnosis capacity without losing sensitivity, and also to compensate supply
shortage. Although a few reports regarding sample pooling for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis have
been published on the last weeks (2-6), only 3 of those include sensitivity evaluation (2,3,5).
Moreover, this is the first study to our knowledge using CDC FDA EUA RT-qPCR kit and also
not showing Ct shifts and reduced sensitivity for sample pooling.
We have been successfully using this protocol during covid19 surveillance at Galapagos Islands
where more than 5% (over 1500 subjects) of the population has been tested on a single lab with a
single Real Time PRC device within a month period (confirming also a 100% specificity as all
positives triplet pools always yielded at least a positive sample). The main limitation of our
protocol is the need for running an extra RT-PCR reaction for positives triplets on a single
sample mode that delays diagnosis a few hours. So this protocol would not be useful when high
prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 is expected and diagnosis is expedited as for hospitalized

triplet protocol would be of great help.
