Abstract (Structured 133 Words)
Objective: The present study examined the relationship between the intensity of home-based
telework and work engagement.
Methods: This cross-sectional study using a self-administrated questionnaire survey was
conducted from December 22 to 25, 2020, in Japan. The subjects were asked single-item
questions about the intensity of telework and three-item questions about work engagement
using the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale. Coefficients were estimated using a multilevel
regression model nested by prefecture of residence and adjusted for covariates.
Results: High-intensity (four or more days per week) telework was not associated with high
work engagement for men or women. In contrast, low and moderate intensity (three days per
week to once per month) were associated with high work engagement. The results were
consistent when stratified by sex.
Conclusions: Reasonable-intensity telework may have beneficial effects on work
engagement.

Introduction
In response to the economic and social strain induced by the COVID-19 pandemic, the
Japanese government officially declared a state of emergency on April 8, 2020, in an effort to
prevent the collapse of medical services.1 While the declaration was initially limited to seven
prefectures, it was expanded to include the entire country on April 16, 2020.2 To limit the
spread of COVID-19, many companies have made major changes to employees’ working
style, and the frequency of opportunities to engage in home-based telework has dramatically
increased. Indeed, in a November 2020 survey of approximately 20,000 people, the national
average telework implementation rate among full-time employees in Japan was 24.7%.3
A review paper on the mental health effects of home-based telework showed that
telework has increased isolation, depression, stress, and overwork. However, this result is
inconsistent with the findings of previous studies.4 One study found that employees who
telecommuted eight or fewer hours per month were significantly less likely than
non-telecommuters to experience depression.5 As background to these results, the authors
pointed out that the characteristics and conditions of telework (workplace support, autonomy,
etc.) are more important than whether one is simply a teleworker or not.6 Consideration
should be given to not only the negative influences on mental health but also the positive
influences of this approach to work. Work engagement, one such positive influence, is a
concept characterized by vigor, dedication, and absorption.7 In a cross-sectional study

describing the relationship between the extent of telecommuting and work engagement, the
working environment, such as social support from colleagues, was found to influence work
engagement, although no direct influence of telecommuting on engagement was noted.6
Many workers were forced into telework without any preparation time due to the
relatively sudden appearance of the COVID-19 pandemic.8,9 Before the pandemic, telework
was often available to individual employees as an option10, with a high degree of flexibility
afforded them in terms of where and when they could work. However, the working
environment and conditions during the pandemic are markedly different from the norm, as
workers are often deprived of the choice to telework or not. The question of how home-based
telework affects work engagement in this situation is unclear.
The present study examined the relationship between the intensity of home-based
telework and work engagement adjusted for work environment, such as workplace support
and decision latitude. We also analyzed the results by sex, an approach adopted by many
previous studies11, as men and women often perform different roles in the household, which
is likely to affect the results. One study found less fatigue and stress in men who regularly
worked from home than in those who did not; in contrast, less stress but greater fatigue was
noted in women who worked from home than in those who did not.12 Telework was also
shown to be associated with greater stress as well as happiness in male workers, although no
such effect was found in female workers.13 To our knowledge, however, no studies have

Methods
A research group from the University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Japan,
conducted a prospective cohort study, known as the Collaborative Online Research on
Novel-coronavirus and Work study (CORoNaWork study), as a self-administrated
questionnaire survey through the internet survey company Cross Marketing Inc. (Tokyo,
Japan). During the baseline survey, conducted December 22-25, 2020, Japan was in the midst
of its third wave of the pandemic, at which point the number of COVID-19 infections and
deaths was markedly higher than in the first and second waves; the country was thus on high
alert.
A portion of the baseline survey from the CORoNaWork study was used to conduct
the present cross sectional study. The study protocol, including the sampling plan and subject
recruitment procedure, has been previously reported in detail.14 Participants were aged 20-65
years and working at the time of the baseline survey (n = 33,087 total). Participants in the
CORoNaWork study were stratified by cluster sampling according to gender, age, and region.
After excluding 6,051 initial subjects who provided invalid responses, we ultimately included
27,036 in the database. We analyzed the 19,659 workers remaining after further excluding
self-employed workers (2,709), workers in small/home offices (2,721) and agriculture,
forestry, and fishing workers (1,947) to meet the research purposes.
The present study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of

Assessment of Intensity of Home-Based Telework

We asked subjects, “Do you work at home? Please choose the answer that is closest to your
current situation”, and respondents chose one of the following five options: Four days a week
or more; Two to three days a week; One day a week; More than once a month but less than
once a week; and Never. Participants were divided into four groups by intensity of telework:
high intensity for telework ≥4 days/week, moderate intensity for telework 2-3 days/week, low
intensity for telework once a week to once a month, and no telework for those without
teleworking.

Assessment of Work Engagement

The three-item Japanese version of the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES-3) was used
to assess work engagement.15,16 The UWES-9 has previously been translated into Japanese,
and the Japanese version was found to have acceptable internal consistency and reliability as
well as factor and construct validity.15 The items of UWES-3 were selected from among those
included in the UWES-9. The UWES-3 has been validated in five countries, including
Japan16 and includes measures of vigor (one item), dedication (one item), and absorption (one
item), with each item measured on a seven-point response scale ranging from 0 (never) to 6

(always/every day). Overall scores on the UWES-3 (range: 0 to 6) are calculated by
averaging the individual item scores. Cronbach’s α coefficient for the total UWES-3 score in
this study was 0.92.

Assessment of Covariates

Covariates included demographic, socioeconomic factors, occupation and industry,
psychological demands, decision latitude, and workplace support. Age was expressed as a
continuous variable. Education was classified into five categories: junior high school, high
school, junior college or technical school, university, and graduate school. Yearly household
income was classified into four categories: <2.50 million Japanese yen (JPY); 2.50-3.75
million JPY; 3.75-5.25 million JPY; and >5.25 million JPY. Marital status was classified into
three categories: married; divorced or widowed; and never married. Presence of family living
together was classified into two categories: present and absent. In this survey, participants
chose 1 of 10 options for their occupation: general employee; manager; executive manager;
public employee, faculty member, or non-profit organization employee; temporary/contract
employee; self-employed; small office/home office (SOHO); agriculture, forestry, or fishing;
professional occupations (lawyer, tax accountant, medical-related, etc.); and other
occupations. Three of these categories were excluded from this study, as mentioned above, so
the occupations were ultimately classified into seven categories. The participants chose 1 of

22 options for their working industry: energy, materials, industrial machinery; food;
beverages/tobacco products; pharmaceuticals/medical supplies; cosmetics/toiletries/sanitary
products; fashion and accessories; precision machinery and office supplies; home
appliances/audio visual equipment; automobiles and transportation equipment; household
goods; hobby/sporting goods; real estate and housing equipment; information and
communication; distribution and retail; finance/insurance; transportation and leisure;
restaurant and other services; public offices and organizations; education, medical services,
religion; mass media; market research; and others.
Work-related stress was assessed by the 22-item Japanese version of the Job Content
Questionnaire.17,18 The Job Content Questionnaire comprises a five-item psychological
demands scale (response range 12–48), a nine-item decision latitude scale (response range
24–96), and an eight-item workplace support scale (response range 8–32) created by
summing supervisor support and co-worker support. Each item was measured on a four-point
Likert type scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). In previous studies
concerning the relationship between telework and work engagement, a theoretical model with
three factors mediating the relationship between the two was developed (6). In the present
study with the same target population, we also found that telework was related to three
factors: psychological demands, decision latitude, and workplace support.19
In addition, the prefecture of residence was used as a community-level variable.

Statistical Analyses
Multilevel regression analyses were used to examine the association between intensity of
telework and work engagement. The coefficients and standard errors were estimated using
multilevel regression analyses nested by prefecture of residence and adjusted for sex and age
(Model 1). We then additionally adjusted for income, marriage, and presence of family living
together (Model 2), along with occupation and industry (Model 3), and psychological demand,
decision latitude and workplace support (Model 4). We did not adjust for education, as
adjusting for education would constitute over-adjustment. In addition, we performed
sex-stratified analyses in the same manner.
The level of significance was set at 0.05 (two-tailed). A trend test was conducted by
treating the surveyed telework as a continuous variable on a five-point scale (one to five
points) in order of decreasing frequency and performing the analysis in the same manner. All
analyses were performed using Stata 16SE (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX, USA).

Results
The mean age was higher for men than for women. Men also had a higher educational
attainment and yearly household income than women. The percentage of married people was
higher among men than women. Psychological demands were higher in women, whereas
decision latitude was higher in men. No marked difference in workplace support by sex was
noted. The proportion of telework was higher for men (21%) than for women (15%) (Table
1).
Among all subjects (men and women), all intensity categories of telework were
significantly associated with work engagement adjusted for age and sex (Model 1). After
adjusting for demographics, including socioeconomic factors, occupation and industry
(Model 3), all intensity categories of telework were also associated with work engagement
(Table 2). This association remained significant after additionally adjusting for psychological
demands, decision latitude, and workplace support for low- and moderate-intensity telework,
although not for high-intensity telework (Model 4).

telework for both sexes (Model 4).
Discussion
The present study revealed an association between home-based telework and work
engagement, although the trend differed depending on intensity of telework. High-intensity
telework (≥4 days per week) was not associated with high work engagement, while
low-intensity telework (once per month to once per week) and moderate-intensity telework
(2-3 days per week) had high work engagement for both men and women.
A previous study revealed an indirect relationship between extent of telecommuting
and work engagement via social support, but no direct relationship between telecommuting
and work engagement was noted.6 The authors analyzed the relationship between work
engagement and telecommuting using seven levels of intensity in a week as a continuous
variable. In the present study, we classified telework into categories based on intensity and
conducted analyses by each category, resulting in the demonstration that telework with
low-to-moderate intensity was associated with the possibility of increasing work engagement.
Telework with an appropriate frequency may increase work engagement. Autonomy has been
shown to play an important role in the relationship between telecommunication intensity and
job satisfaction.10 The key to making telework function more productively is to adopt a
management style suitable to telework based on trust and management between supervisor
and colleagues and among individual colleagues.20 If workers are able to work autonomously

and the company is able to provide a suitable working environment for them, workers
engaged in high-intensity telework may still be able to maintain high work engagement. A
previous study in Japan revealed an increase in labor productivity with a suitable number of
teleworking hours; however, when teleworking hours were too long, labor productivity was
reduced13, suggesting that telework may have negative health effects if overloaded.
Our analysis also showed similar results to a previous study6 when the workplace
environment factors of psychological demands, decision latitude, and workplace support were
added as covariates, suggesting that these factors strongly influence the relationship between
telework and work engagement. Determining the ideal intensity of telework may be difficult
for workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, depending on their company's infection
prevention measures. In particular, telework has been shown to reduce workplace support
from supervisors and colleagues, so the implementation of support measures using
Information and Communication Technology tools, such as web conferences, should be
considered.6,20
In the present study, workers with low- and moderate-intensity telework showed
higher work engagement than those with no telework. Workers who are raising children
spend more time engaged in housework than those without children, so flexibility of time is
important to these workers.12 However, telework makes switching between work time and
personal time difficult. Stress responses experienced by individuals have been found to

propagate across domains, from one area of life within an individual (e.g. work) to another
(e.g. family life); this phenomenon is referred to as “crossover”.21 Previous studies have
shown that working at home increases work stress, and work-family conflict mediates the
effect.22 Further, the degree of effect was stronger for women than for men. The present study
did not take into account work-family conflict in its analysis, so further studies on this point
are required. Studies in the United States have shown that home-based telework does not
reduce work-family conflict and may actually increase working hours.23 Occupational health
practitioners need to pay attention to this point when assessing the health impact of
telecommuting on workers.
The present study is the first to show an association between the intensity of telework
and work engagement under the COVID-19 pandemic. However, several limitations
associated with our study warrant mention. First, as the present study was conducted through
the Internet, the extent to which the results may be generalized is unclear. However, to reduce
bias as much as possible, we sampled the target population according to region, job type, and
prefecture based on the infection incidence rate. Second, while work-family conflict may
have influenced our findings, we did not enquire about such conflict in this study. However,
we did adjust for marital status and the presence of family living together, which may have
helped compensate for this lack of data. Third, because this was a cross-sectional study, the
causal relationship between the intensity of telework and work engagement is unclear.

Concerns have been raised about the existence of reverse causality, such as not choosing
telework because the task lowers work engagement. Research has been conducted to index
the ease of telecommuting (feasibility of telework) based on job characteristics.24 In the
present study, we adjusted for occupation and industry, which may have eliminated some of
the effects of the feasibility of telework.
In conclusion, low- and moderate-intensity telework (once per month to three days
per week) may have beneficial effects on work engagement. Certain factors associated with
high-intensity telework (four or more days per week) may not enhance work engagement;
these factors should be clarified, and measures to increase work engagement should be taken.
