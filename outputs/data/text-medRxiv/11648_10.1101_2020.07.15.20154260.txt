ABSTRACT

Background:
The clinical description of the neurological manifestations in COVID-19 patients is still underway.
This study aims to provide an overview of the spectrum, characteristics and outcomes of neurological
manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Methods:
We conducted a nationwide, multicentric, retrospective study during the French COVID-19 epidemic
in March-April 2020. All COVID-19 patients with de novo neurological manifestations were eligible.
Results:
We included 222 COVID-19 patients with neurological manifestations from 46 centers throughout the
country. Median age was 65 years (IQR 53-72), and 136 patients (61.3%) were male. COVID-19 was
severe or critical in almost half of the patients (102, 45.2%). The most common neurological diseases
were COVID-19 associated encephalopathy (67/222, 30.2%), acute ischemic cerebrovascular
syndrome (57/222, 25.7%), encephalitis (21/222, 9.5%), and Guillain-Barré Syndrome (15/222, 6.8%).
Neurological manifestations appeared after first COVID-19 symptoms with a median (IQR) delay of 6
(3-8) days in COVID-19 associated encephalopathy, 7 (5-10) days in encephalitis, 12 (7-18) days in
acute ischemic cerebrovascular syndrome and 18 (15-28) days in Guillain-Barré Syndrome. Brain
imaging was performed in 192 patients (86.5%), including 157 MRI (70.7%). Brain MRI of
encephalitis patients showed heterogeneous acute non vascular lesion in 14/21 patients (66.7%) with
associated small ischemic lesion or microhemorrhages in 4 patients. Among patients with acute
ischemic cerebrovascular syndrome, 13/57 (22.8%) had multi territory ischemic strokes, with large
vessel thrombosis in 16/57 (28.1%). Cerebrospinal fluid was analyzed in 97 patients (43.7%), with
pleocytosis in 18 patients (18.6%). A SARS-CoV-2 PCR was performed in 75 patients and was
positive only in 2 encephalitis patients. Among patients with encephalitis, ten out of 21 (47.6%) fully
recovered, 3 of whom received corticosteroids (CS). Less common neurological manifestations
included isolated seizure (8/222, 3.6%), critical illness neuropathy (8/222, 3.6%), transient alteration
of consciousness (5/222, 2.3%), intracranial hemorrhage (5/222, 2.3%), acute benign lymphocytic

meningitis (3/222, 1.4%), cranial neuropathy (3/222, 1.4%), single acute demyelinating lesion (2/222,
0.9%), Tapia syndrome (2/222, 0.9%), cerebral venous thrombosis (1/222, 0.5%), sudden paraparesis
(1/222, 0.5%), generalized myoclonus and cerebellar ataxia (1/222, 0.5%), bilateral fibular palsy
(1/222, 0.5%) and isolated neurological symptoms (headache, anosmia, dizziness, sensitive or auditive
symptoms, hiccups, 15/222, 6.8%). The median (IQR) follow-up of the 222 patients was 24 (17-34)
days with a high short-term mortality rate (28/222, 12.6%).
Conclusion:
Neurological manifestations associated with COVID-19 mainly included CAE, AICS, encephalitis
and GBS. Clinical spectrum and outcomes were broad and heterogeneous, suggesting different
underlying pathogenic processes.

INTRODUCTION

COVID-19, the disease linked to the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, is an emerging infectious disease with
first cases reported in China in December 2019. Since then, the virus has continued to spread and on
March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic.
France has been heavily affected by the COVID-19 epidemic and went into lockdown on March 17,
2020. From March 1, 2020 to April 30,2020, 89 818 new cases of COVID-19 were hospitalized in
France. Up to July 2, 2020, more than 160,000 cases and 29,000 deaths had been reported in France.
Although common manifestations of the disease including respiratory tract and associated systemic
manifestations have been well described1,2, neurological manifestations elicited few communications.
Headaches, dizziness, anosmia, encephalopathy and strokes have been reported in cohort studies 3,4.
However, the potential pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 in the central nervous system remains unclear5,
and the range of neurological disorders associated with COVID-19 is not fully defined.
The present study aims to provide a comprehensive overview of neurological manifestations
associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and to describe the clinical course and outcomes of COVID-19
patients with neurological manifestations.

METHODS

Study design
We conducted a nationwide retrospective, multicentric, observational study to collect neurological
manifestations associated with COVID-19. A case report form (CRF) containing the main information
regarding COVID-19 and neurological manifestations was sent at regular intervals from March 16 to
April 27, 2020 to neurologists, infectious diseases specialists and intensivists through the National
College of General Hospital Neurologists (CNNHG), the French Society for Infectious Diseases
(SPILF), the Association of French-Speaking Liberal Neurologists (ANLLF), and the Multiple
Sclerosis Society (SF-SEP). The anonymized CRF were collected by email or telefax at the Neurology

department of Saint-Denis Hospital, France. In accordance with French law, the study complied with
the Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés (CNIL, reference number 2217844) and
ethics committee (reference number RCB 2020-A01300-39) requirements. The IRB CER-MIT n°
2020-0602 COVID has approved the study.

Patients and data collection
We included COVID-19 adult patients with any neurological manifestations occurring 5 days before
to 35 days after the first symptoms of COVID-19. COVID-19 patients managed in intensive care units
with neurological manifestations after withdrawal of sedation were also included. Only de novo
neurological symptoms were considered, excluding patients with exacerbations of chronic
neurological diseases. A confirmed case of COVID-19 was defined as a patient with a positive SARSCoV-2 RT-PCR assay on a naso-pharyngeal sample or a positive SARS-CoV-2 serology (according to
local laboratory standard). As RT-PCR analysis and serology were unavailable in some centers during
the epidemic, some cases were considered COVID-19 if the clinical history and the chest CT-scan
were considered typical according to local expert clinicians. We defined the severity of COVID-19
illness as mild, moderate, severe and critical according to NIH guidelines 6. Demographical and
clinical data, neurological workup findings and outcome were systematically collected. If necessary,
in-charge clinicians were directly contacted to collect any missing or uncertain records.

Classification of neurological manifestations
Neurological manifestations were split into Central Nervous System (CNS) and Peripheral Nervous
System (PNS) manifestations. Each manifestation was then classified into the following diagnostic
categories:
- Stroke was considered in patients with sudden neurological deficit related to an acute vascular lesion
on cerebral MRI or CT scan (ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke), in patients with transient focal deficit
and normal MRI (transient ischemic attack), or in patients with cerebral venous thrombosis.

- Encephalitis was defined as altered mental status lasting ≥ 24 hours and one of the following criteria:
white blood count cells (WBCs) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) > 5/mm3; presence of compatible acute
lesion on brain MRI.
- Encephalopathy was defined by delirium lasting ≥ 24 hours, and could be associated to seizure
and/or focal neurological sign, in the absence of criteria for encephalitis criteria. We defined COVIDassociated encephalopathy (CAE) if encephalopathy could not be accounted for by another cause such
as toxic or metabolic factor according to the reporting clinician.
- Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) was defined according to standard diagnosis criteria7.
- Acute meningitis was defined as meningeal syndrome without encephalitic course, and CSF WBC
counts > 5/mm3.
- Patients with neurological manifestations that could not be classified into these five categories were
classified as ‘others’

RESULTS

The study was conducted in March-April 2020. Among the 259 CRF submitted, 37 patients were
excluded for the following reasons: COVID-19 not confirmed (n=20), neurological symptoms non
time-related to other symptoms of COVID-19 (n=12) or neurological symptoms linked to an
exacerbation of chronic neurological disease (n=5). The population study (Figure 1) consisted of 222
COVID-19 patients with neurological manifestations from 46 centers in all the regions of continental
France and overseas. Participant centers were university hospitals for 101/222 patients (45.5%) and
non-university hospitals for 121/222 patients (54.5%). Physicians who filled out the forms were
neurologists (146/222, 65.8%), infectious diseases or internal medicine specialists (43/222, 19.4%),
intensivists (14/222, 6.3%), or other specialists (19/222, 8.6%). Most patients (217/222, 97.8%)
required hospital admission.

The general characteristics of the 222 patients are detailed in Table 1. Median age was 65 years (IQR
53-72), and 136 (61.3%) were male. Forty-seven patients (21.2%) had a past neurological history,
mostly prior stroke (20, 9.0%) and neurodegenerative disease (17, 7.7%). The diagnosis of COVID-19
was confirmed by a positive SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal rt-PCR in 86.5% (n=192) of the patients
and by serology in 1.8% (n=4) of the patients. Twenty-six patients (11.7%) had a diagnosis on the
basis of a typical clinical course and imagery. COVID-19 severity was mild or moderate in about half
of the patients (120, 54.1%), severe or critical in the other half (102, 45.2%). The most commonly
described neurological symptoms were altered mental status (117, 52.4%) and central focal deficit (97,
43.7%). Neurological work-up mostly included brain MRI (157, 70.7%) and CSF examination (97,
43.7%). SARS-CoV-2 PCR was performed in the CSF for 75 patients (33.8%) and was negative in
73/75 cases (97.3%). The median follow-up was 24 days (IQR 17-34). Twenty-eight patients (12.6%)
died, mostly following acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS, n=17, 7.7%). Stroke was
considered to be the cause of death in five patients (2.3%), following brain herniation due to extensive
spontaneous intracerebral hematoma (n=2), severe hemorrhagic transformation after ischemic stroke
(n=2) or extensive cerebral venous thrombosis (n=1).

Clinical spectrum of neurological manifestations associated to SARS-CoV-2 infection
The spectrum of the neurological manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection is presented
in Figure 1.

CNS manifestations
One hundred eighty-nine patients (85.1%) had CNS manifestations, mostly encephalopathy (n=85,
38.3% of all patients), strokes (n=63, 28.4%), and encephalitis (n=21, 9.5%). The distribution of
strokes was as follows: acute ischemic cerebrovascular syndromes (AICS, 57/63, 90.5% of all strokes)
including 52 acute ischemic strokes and 5 transient ischemic attacks, intracranial hemorrhages (ICH,
5/63, 7.9%) and cerebral venous thromboses (CVT, 1/63, 1.6%). Among patients with
encephalopathy, 67/85 (78%) were classified as COVID-associated encephalopathy (CAE). The 18
remaining patients had other factors accounting for encephalopathy: acute kidney injury in 10,

medication in 6, complications of alcohol withdrawal in 4 patients. The other CNS manifestations
were isolated seizures (n=8), transient loss of consciousness (n=5), meningitis (n=3), single acute
demyelinating lesion (n=2), paraparesis (n=1) and generalized myoclonus with cerebellar ataxia (n=1).

PNS manifestations
Twenty-nine patients (13.1%) had PNS manifestations, mostly Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS, n=15,
6.8% of all patients). Ten other patients had peripheral complications of intensive care management,
either critical illness neuropathy (n=8) or hypoglossal and pneumogastric nerves palsy following orotracheal intubation, known as Tapia syndrome (n=2). The remaining PNS manifestations were cranial
neuropathy (n=3) and bilateral fibular nerve palsy (n=1). Eleven patients (5.9%) had mixed CNS and
PNS manifestations, as detailed in Figure 1.

Unclassified manifestations
Fifteen patients (6.8%) had mixed manifestations of undetermined mechanisms, including headache,
dizziness, anosmia, auditory symptoms and subjective sensitive symptoms, in different combinations.

Main neurological manifestations associated with COVID-19: AICS, encephalitis, CAE and GBS
AICS, encephalitis, CAE and GBS patients accounted for 71% (158/222) of the reported neurological
manifestations in COVID-19 patients. Their characteristics are presented in table 2 and 3 and detailed
below.

Baseline characteristics (table 2)
Median age was 65 years (IQR 55-78) in AICS patients, 67 years (IQR 51-70) in encephalitis patients,
68 years (IQR 61-75) in CAE patients and 59 years (IQR 53-65) in GBS patients. The proportion of
men was higher in each group, particularly in encephalitis patients (15/21, 71.4%) and GBS patients
(13/15, 86.7%). Concerning medical history, 20/67 (29.9%) of CAE patients had neurodegenerative
disease, and 43/57 (75.4%) of AICS patients had vascular comorbidities, including 8/52 (14.0%) with
prior stroke.

The majority of CAE patients suffered from severe to critical COVID-19 illness (46/67, 68.7%). In
GBS and AICS patients, mild and moderate COVID-19 illness predominated, respectively 10/15
(66.7%) and 37/57 (64.9%). AICS was inaugural of COVID-19 in 14/57 patients (24.6%), and CAE in
15/67 patients (22.4%). Neurological symptoms were first observed when sedation was withheld for
20/67 CAE patients (29.9%), 6/21 encephalitis patients (28.6%), and 3/15 GBS patients (20.0%). The
remaining patients had neurological manifestations several days after the first COVID-19 symptoms,
with a median delay of 6 (IQR 3-8) and 7 (IQR 5-10) days respectively in CAE and encephalitis
patients, 12 days (IQR 7-18) in AICS and 18 days (IQR 15-28) in GBS.

Clinical course (table 2)
Regarding AICS, focal central neurological symptoms were present in 56/57 patients (98.2%), and
altered mental status in 8/57 (14.0%). All patients with encephalitis or CAE had altered mental status.
Twelve out of 21 encephalitis patients (57.1%) had focal central neurological symptoms, mostly
cerebellar ataxia and pyramidal syndrome, and six (28.6%) had movement disorders, mostly tremor
and myoclonus. Focal neurological symptoms were also present in 13/67 CAE patients (19.4%)
mostly cerebellar ataxia. Seizure rate was approximately the same in encephalitis (2/21, 9.5%) and in
CAE (7/67, 10.4%). Eleven out of 15 patients (73.3%) with GBS had progressive weakness in both
arms and legs that could be associated with sensory symptoms. Among these 11 patients, one had
oculomotor nerve palsy and another had bilateral facial nerve palsy. Three other patients (20.0%) had
proprioceptive sensory loss without limb weakness, associated with facial palsy in one. One patient
(6.7%) had bilateral facial palsy and areflexia.

Neurological work-up (table 3)
Large vessel thrombosis was observed in 16/57 patients with AICS (28.1%), located in internal carotid
artery (n=9) and/or the proximal segment of the middle cerebral artery (n=6), or in basilar artery
(n=1). Thirteen patients (22.8%) had multi territory ischemic strokes. AICS was cryptogenic in 38/57
patients (66.7%). Etiological workup highlighted 9 embolic heart disease (atrial fibrillation in 4,
paradoxical embolism in 2, valvular heart disease in 2, myocarditis in 1), 7 atheromatous stenosis, 1

cerebral small vessel disease, 1 intracranial vasculopathy and 1 carotid artery dissection. In
encephalitis patients, CSF examination demonstrated lymphocytic pleiocytosis from 6 to 77
WBC/mm3 in 14/21 patients (66.7%) and positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR in 2/20 (9.5%). Brain MRI
showed heterogeneous acute non vascular lesion in 14/21 patients (66.7%), listed in table 3. Four
patients (19.0%) also had small ischemic lesion or microhemorrhages. Regarding CAE patients, 57/67
had brain imaging (85.1%) showing nine with acute lesions, mostly small ischemic ones (table 3).
Electroencephalogram was performed in 15/21 encephalitis patients (71.4%) and 32/67 CAE patients
(47.8%). The proportion of the different patterns among the two groups was very close (table 3) with
55% of non-specific diffuse slowing (n=26/47), 15% of anterior slowing (n=7/47), 26% of focal
lateralized abnormalities (n=12/47) and 9% of periodic pattern (n=4/47). In patients with GBS, CSF
examination demonstrated isolated elevated proteins in 8/14 patients (57.1%), ranging from 0.49 to
2.36 g/L, and negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR in the 9 patients tested. One patient had mild lymphocytic
pleiocytosis with 12 WBC/mm3. Electroneuromyography was abnormal in 13/14 patients (92.9),
suggestive of demyelination in all of them.

Outcome (table 2)
Regarding encephalitis, 10/21 patients (47.6%) fully recovered, 3 of whom received corticosteroids
(CS). In patients with persistent neurological symptoms (10/21, 47.6%) one received CS and another
intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg). Out of 67 patients with CAE, 34 (50.7%) recovered
spontaneously. Two patients received corticosteroids with partial improvement. Most patients with
GBS were treated with IVIg for 14/15 (93.3%). Two of them required mechanical ventilation.
The mortality rate during follow-up was 15.8% in AICS patients, 14.9% in CAE patients, 4.8% in
encephalitis patients, 0% in GBS patients. To note, among the 18 patients with toxic metabolic
encephalopathy who had been excluded from the CAE group, five deaths occurred (27.8%).

Other neurological manifestations associated with COVID-19

Fifty patients had neurological manifestations that did not fulfill criteria for AICS, encephalitis, CAE
or GBS, nor were they related to intensive care complications or metabolic or toxic encephalopathy.
These neurological manifestations were very heterogeneous (Figure 1, Table 4).

Acute benign lymphocytic meningitis
Three young patients, with a median age of 20 years (IQR 19-35), had acute benign lymphocytic
meningitis in a context of mild or moderate COVID-19 disease. CSF examination demonstrated
lymphocytic pleiocytosis from 12 to 102 WBC/mm3, a normal protein level and negative SARS-CoV2 PCR in the two samples that were tested.

Non ischemic strokes
Five patients had ICH. Three of them had deep ICH with a history of chronic arterial hypertension.
Another patient had lobar ICH with no evidence of an underlying vascular malformation or tumor
after extensive work-up including brain MRI and cerebral angiography. The last patient had multiple
lobar ICH in a context of severe COVID-19 disease with acute kidney injury and hemolytic anemia.
Two out of the five patients with ICH (40%) died. One patient had CVT revealed by a large
parenchymal hematoma and a fulminant intracranial hypertension, causing death within a few days.

Peripheral neuropathy
Two patients had oculomotor nerve palsy and one had facial peripheral nerve palsy with spontaneous
clinical improvement in most cases (2/3, 66.7%) and no evidence for an underlying acute
inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy. One patient had bilateral fibular palsy with an asymmetrical
motor predominant neuropathy of undetermined mechanism.

Isolated seizure and transient alteration of consciousness
Eight patients had isolated de novo seizure and five had transient alteration of consciousness, with
resolution of symptoms in less than 24 hours and no other encephalopathic features. Semeiology of
seizure were as follows: generalized tonic-clonic seizure (n=6), focal motor seizure (n=1), focal non-

motor seizure with chewing movement (n=1). One patient experienced recurrence of generalized
seizure after 24 hours and required long term antiepileptic medication, with etiological negative workup.

Focal acute demyelinating lesion
Two young women with no medical history revealed multiple sclerosis with an acute demyelinating
MRI lesion, optic neuritis in one and cerebellar peduncle active lesion in one, with several old lesions.

Other rare neurological manifestations
One patient had paraparesis of undetermined mechanism, with no evidence for myelitis on spine MRI
and no evidence for Guillain-Barré syndrome on CSF examination and electroneuromyography.
Another patient had generalized myoclonus with cerebellar ataxia. Brain MRI revealed no significant
abnormalities and CSF examination was not available. He improved partially without any treatment.

Mixed symptoms of unclassified mechanisms
Fifteen patients (6.8%) had different combinations of nonspecific symptoms such as headache or
dizziness, that could be associated with anosmia or hiccups. Most patients (12/15, 80%) had mild or
moderate COVID-19 disease. Neurological symptoms appeared early in the evolution of the disease as

DISCUSSION

To our knowledge, this is one of the largest series of COVID-19 patients with neurological
manifestations. It provides detailed data about clinical and diagnostic aspects including short-term
prognosis. Our results highlighted the broad spectrum of neurological manifestations associated with
SARS-CoV-2 infection, and identified some major trends. The majority of neurological manifestations
were CAE (67/222, 30%), AICS (57/222, 26%), encephalitis (21/222, 10%), and GBS (15/222, 7%).
Neurological manifestations appeared after first COVID-19 symptoms with a median delay of 6 days

in CAE, 7 days in encephalitis, 12 days in AICS and 18 days in GBS. Around 25% of CAE and AICS
were inaugural and 30% of CAE and encephalitis were diagnosed after discontinuation of sedation. A
combination of nonspecific symptoms such as headache or dizziness, not related to another
neurological disease, were reported in 7% of the patients (15/222) and appeared early in the course of
COVID-19. With a median delay of follow-up of 24 days, our registry highlighted a high rate of shortterm mortality in COVID-19 patients with CAE and AICS, around 15% (19/124). The other reported
fatal cases concerned five patients with metabolic-toxic encephalopathy, two patients with ICH, one
patient with CVT and one patient with encephalitis.

Altered mental status was the most common neurological symptom reported in 52% of patients in our
registry. Several cohorts of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 have shown a significant proportion
of impaired consciousness on admission, ranging from 7.5 to 20% 1,3,4,8. The classification and
description of these patients in our registry highlight different possible pathogenic pathways. Indeed,
patients with altered mental status may have encephalitis, in presence of meningitis and/or a
compatible lesion on cerebral MRI. Encephalitis represented up to 10% of patients in our registry and
they were more likely to have focal neurological signs and abnormal movements compared to patients
with CAE. The aspects of brain MRI were very heterogeneous, consistent with the few published
cases of encephalitis: white matter lesion and / or basal ganglia and thalami involvement suggestive of
acute disseminated encephalomyelitis9 or acute necrotizing encephalopathy10–12, other nonspecific
diffuse involvement of white matter13,14, mesio-temporal lesion8,15 with possible frontoinsular
extension, leptomeningeal abnormalities4 and brainstem lesions16. Cases with unremarkable MRI have
also been published17,18. Only two patients in our registry had a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR in the
CSF. In line with our data, only two encephalitis with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR in CSF have been
reported by the time of writing9,15. In our series the short-term outcome was generally favorable
without any specific treatment. All of these elements suggest rather a para-infectious mechanism than
a direct neuropathogenicity of the virus, but neuropathological studies remain scarce. In a recent
autopsy study of six patients who died from COVID-19, Von Weyhern and al19 highlighted the
presence of lymphocytic panencephalitis and meningitis, but whether the observed lesions were a

direct consequence of virus infiltration or resulted from an immune response could not be established.
Another published case documented the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in endothelial and neural cells of
frontal lobe sections20 in a patient with negative SARS CoV 2 PCR in postmortem CSF sample. This
raises the question of the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing in CSF, currently unknown. In
addition, twenty percent of patients with encephalitis in our series demonstrated microvascular lesions
on brain MRI, suggesting potential implication of a COVID-19 associated endotheliitis 21,22 or
coagulopathy23. In the autopsy study of Von Weyhern and al19, diffuse petechial brain hemorrhages
were associated with encephalitic pathological features, with no conspicuous endotheliitis.

Another autopsy study24 demonstrated the presence of acute hypoxic injury in the cerebrum and
cerebellum with no thrombi, encephalitis or vasculitis, and no cytoplasmic viral staining. This study
concerned 18 patients having encephalopathic features associated with fatal COVID-19 disease. In our
registry, we described a group of 67 patients with CAE, defined by persistent confusional state without
encephalitis criteria or obvious toxic-metabolic coexisting factor. CAE patients had more severe forms
of COVID-19, as previously shown in other studies3,8, with one third of them exhibiting delirium after
intensive care management when sedation was withdrawn. Helms et al described the same course in
67% of patients with COVID-19 related ARDS4. We can therefore hypothesize that COVID-induced
sepsis25 may lead to a septic-associated encephalopathy (SAE). There are indeed many points
suggestive of SAE in our CAE patients: age, previous cognitive impairment, illness severity, focal
deficit and seizures, tremor, myoclonus and acute vascular lesion on brain MRI26. SAE can also induce
posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome27 which has not been reported in our registry but some
cases have been published in COVID-19 patients8,28. The release of pro-inflammatory cytokines is one
of the key pathogenic pathways suggested in SAE, and is thought to play a central role in severe
COVID-1929. The cytokine storm is also one of the possible pathogenic pathways in mild
encephalopathy with reversible splenial lesion syndrome, that is described in one patient in our
registry and in one patient in the literature30.

In patients with encephalitis and CAE, electroencephalographic features were relatively close and
mainly consisted of a nonspecific generalized background slowing, indicating diffuse cerebral
dysfunction. Some published cases suggested a more specific pattern in COVID-19 patients, showing
in frontal areas the presence of monomorphic biphasic delta slow waves with a periodic organization
31,32

. Our study found only 15% of anterior slowing and 9% of periodic pattern in patients with

encephalitis and CAE.

AICS was the second most common manifestation in our series, accounting for 26% of patients.
Although 75% of AICS patients had vascular comorbidities, our study highlights some features for
which there is growing evidence in other published series: high prevalence of large vessels stroke33,34,
multi-territory involvement34, undetermined etiology35, and high mortality rate35. COVID-related
coagulopathy23 probably plays a decisive role in these thrombotic cryptogenic ischemic strokes. AICS
was not associated with particularly severe manifestations of COVID-19 in our series, contrary to
what Mao et al3 had suggested. GBS represented approximately 7% of patients in the registry, and
occurred with a median delay of 18 days after the first manifestations of COVID-19. Several cases and
case series are currently reported in the literature36–41 and an Italian study has demonstrated that the
incidence of GBS increased in their region during the COVID-19 epidemics compared with the three
previous years42. No Miller Fisher syndrome case has been reported in our registry, and published
cases are few and far between’43,44.

Patients with mixed manifestations of undetermined mechanisms such as headache, dizziness,
subjective sensitive signs and anosmia have been reported to our registry in about 7% of patients.
Headache and dizziness are frequently reported in cohorts of COVID-19 patients, ranging from 8 to
14% and 6 to 17% respectively1,3,8. Anosmia was present in 3% of our patients and in about 5% in
other series of hospitalized COVID-19 patients3,8 whereas its prevalence reached 86% in a dedicated
European multicentric study45. In our cohort that mainly involved hospitalized patients, these
symptoms may have been underreported.

The other neurological manifestations reported in our registry are much rarer in occurrence and would
require larger studies to be appropriately described. We report three cases of acute benign lymphocytic
meningitis, which has not been reported in association with COVID-19 to date. We also report two
patients with Tapia syndrome, a rare complication of orotracheal intubation, with one similar case
recently published 46.

Our study has some limitations. First, this is a retrospective registry with inherent reporting biases,
which should lead us to interpret with caution the different proportions of neurological manifestations.
Headache, dizziness and anosmia were not particularly frequent in our registry, probably
underreported and/or associated with milder forms of COVID-19 disease. Secondly, the data are
entirely descriptive and based on the report at a definite time period during the French outbreak. We
used a deliberately simplified CRF given the exceptional working load of medical teams, whose first
mission during the outbreak was the management of patients. There was therefore no exhaustive
collection of medical history other than neurological comorbidities and vascular comorbidities for
AICS, nor of biological parameters. The main objective was to provide a wide overview of
neurological manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The analysis of the mechanisms
and potential risk factors for nervous system involvement in COVID-19 is therefore limited. Further
studies are necessary to clarify these points.

CONCLUSION

Our study highlights the broad spectrum of neurological manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2
infection, probably related to different pathogenic pathways. Although encephalopathies were the
most frequently reported manifestation, possibly linked to sepsis and cytokine storm, encephalitis was
described in 10% of cases. However, we found few arguments to support the hypothesis of direct
SARS-CoV-2 neuropathogenicity: a large majority of SARS-CoV-2 PCR in cerebrospinal fluid
(73/75, 97.3%) were negative, and the short-term outcome of patients with encephalitis was generally
favorable. Ischemic strokes were also frequently reported, as well as GBS, which occurred later in the

course of the disease (18 days as compared to 7 days for encephalitis or 12 days for strokes). Other
rare neurological manifestations such as meningitis or cranial neuropathy require comparison with
other studies and registries to understand their potential link with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
