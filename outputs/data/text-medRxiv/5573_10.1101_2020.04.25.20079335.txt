Abstract: To control and prevent the spread of COVID-19, generalized social distancing
measures, such as traffic control and travel restriction acted in China. Previous studies indicated

1. Introduction

that the traffic conditions had significant influence on the air quality, and which was related to the
respiratory diseases. This study aimed to reveal the nexus of travel restriction, air pollution and
COVID-19. Shenzhen, one of the top 4 megacities in China was considered as the study area,
statistical analysis methods, including linear/nonlinear regression and bivariate correlation was
conducted to evaluate the relationship of the traffic and passenger population, travel intensity, NO2,
PM10, PM2.5 and the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases. The results suggested that traffic
control and travel restriction had a significant correlation with the number of COVID-19
confirmed cases, which shown negative correlation with the traffic intensity of the city, NO2, PM10
and PM2.5 show significant positive correlation with the traffic intensity, traffic control and travel
restriction would slow down and prevent the spread of the viruses at the outbreak period. Different
study scale might results in different results, thus the research focused on the nexus of traffic
control and travel restriction, air pollution and COVID-19 should been enhanced in future, and
differentiated epidemic control and prevention measures should be considered according to the
different situation of cities as well as countries.

Since 31 December 2019 China reported a cluster of cases of pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei

30

Province (WHO, 2020a; Chen et al., 2020; Xie and Zhu., 2020), a novel coronavirus disease,

31

namely COVID-19 spread rapidly and became a world pandemic (WHO, 2020a,b; Vellingiri et al..

32

2020), there have been 2,164,111 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in 213 countries, areas or

33

territories, reported to WHO as of 2:00 am CEST, 18 April 2020 (WHO, 2020b). To prevent and

34

reduce spread of the infection, strong and immediate measures, such as detect disease early, isolate

and treat cases, trace contacts and social distancing acted in China at national scale (Pan et al.,

36

2020). Modeling studies indicated that the travel restrict of Wuhan delayed the epidemic

37

progression by 3 to 5 days in mainland China (Chinazzi et al., 2020; Tian et al., 2020; Pan et al.,

38

2020), while reducing case importations to other countries by nearly 80% through mid-February

39

(Chinazzi et al., 2020; Pan et al., 2020).

40

Previous studies indicated that the respiratory disease was highly related to the air pollution

41

(Phosri et al., 2019; Zhu et al., 2019), and which could be considered as a putative disease risk

42

factor of the novel COVID-19 disease (Martelletti and Martelletti, 2020). Study conducted by Zhu

43

et al., 2020 in China reveled that there was a significant relationship between COVID-19 infection

44

and air pollutants such as PM10, PM2.5 and NO2. To prevent and control the spread of the novel

45

coronavirus disease, social distancing was encouraged in China, people were encouraged to stay at

46

home and limit outdoor activities, the worse epidemic regions took traffic control measures to

47

restrict the travel. Consequently, social distancing was not only a simple polite behavior that

48

keeping distance with people, but also multiple measures, such as traffic control and travel

49

restriction, that controlled and prevented the contact among people and more over cut down the

50

spread of the viruses (Prin and Bartels, 2020; Yezli and Khan, 2020). Different traffic and travel

51

management strategies had a direct effect on air pollution (Pasquier and André, 2017; Krecl et al.,

52

2020), however, to our knowledge, no study has yet comprehensively evaluated the nexus of

53

traffic control and travel restriction, air pollution and COVID-19 infection at city scale, how travel

54

restriction influences human living habit, and the impact on air environment as well as COVID-19

55

infection should be well concerned.

In this paper, a contradistinctive study was conducted among the changing of intracity and

intercity travel restriction, air environment quality and COVID-19 infection in Shenzhen, one of

58

the top 4 megacity of China, from January to March in 2019 and 2020, and the relationship of

59

which was evaluated using statistical methods. The authors hope the findings will provide useful

60

enlightenment for the control and prevention of this novel coronavirus disease.

2. Data acquisition and methods

62

This study was conducted in Shenzhen, southern China, with longitude from 113°43'E to

63

114°38'E, latitude from 22°24'N to 22°52'N. Shenzhen is one of the top 4 megacities of China,

64

with 1997.47 km2 urban area and 13.03 million permanent resident populations. In 2018 the total

65

GDP of Shenzhen was 2422.2 billion CNY and the economic aggregate ranked the top 5 of the

66

Asian cities.

67

The air quality data were adapted from the national air quality publishing platform

68

(http://106.37.208.233:20035/), hourly data of NO2 (ug/m3), PM10 (ug/m3) and PM2.5 (ug/m3), from

69

11 stations were collected during 1 January and 31 March in 2019 and 2020. The traffic data,

70

including intracity traffic (the monthly passenger population, 10 4 person/time) and intercity traffic

71

(the monthly public transport population, 104 person/time) were adapted from the Transport

72

Bureau of Shenzhen Municipality (http://jtys.sz.gov.cn/zwgk/sjfb/index.htm). The travel intensity

73

(TI) of Shenzhen was collected from Baidu Qianxi (http://qianxi.baidu.com/), an open data

74

platform based on the location based service (LBS) big data technology, and the daily TI was the

75

logarithmic results of the ratio of the travel population and the resistant population (cited from the

76

data declaration of the Baidu Qianxi website). The data of COVID-19 confirmed cases were

77

collated

79

The descriptive statistical analysis of the intercity and intracity traffic and travel, air

80

pollutants and COVID-19 confirmed cases was conducted firstly and nonparametric test

81

(Kolmogorov-Smirnov method) (Zhao et al., 2017) was used to reveal the data distribution

82

characters. Secondly, linear/nonlinear regression and bivariate correlation analysis (Grange et al.,

83

2016) was conducted to evaluate the relationship of these variables, and the correlation was

84

considered significant at the 0.01 level (2-tailed) (Zhu et al., 2020).

3.1 data descriptive

87

Fig.1 illustrated the temporal variability of the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases and

88

the travel intensity of Shenzhen in 2019 and 2020. With the developments on the novel

89

coronavirus disease in Shenzhen, the time series of January to March 2020 were divided into 3

90

parts: the normal period, the social distancing period and the reopened period. The normal period

91

was from 1 January to 23 January. During this period, the variation tendency of travel intensity in

92

2020 was similar with that in 2019. The average value of travel intensity in 2020 was 4.34, with

93

25% increased from 2019, indicating a more active travel desire of the population in 2020. The

94

social distancing period was from 24 January to 9 February. With the rapidly increasing confirmed

95

cases, Shenzhen strengthened social distancing and the control of traffic and travel, for instance,

96

people were encouraged to stay at home, real-name registration with residential address and

97

personal health condition was conducted by mobile phone APP, and the electric health QR code

98

was checked as the certificate for entering a housing estate (Fig.2 (a)), some bus routes were

99

closed, the subway and taxi adjusted the serving time and encouraged the passengers to scan the

100

code to record the travel information (Fig.2 (b) and (c)). During the social distancing period, a

sharp decrease of travel intensity appeared, the average value of which was 0.87 (2.21 in 2019 at

102

the same time), decreasing nearly 80% from the normal period. The reopened period was from 10

103

February to 31 March, the economy and travel was reopened, the travel intensity was slightly

104

increasing with average value of 2.87 (2.3 times of that in the social distancing period), but which

105

was only about 59% of the value in the same time period in 2019, indicating people’s travel desire

106

was not recovered yet.

The intracity traffic (the monthly passenger population) and intercity traffic (the monthly

116

public transport population) revealed the similar situation of the traffic and travel conditions of

117

Shenzhen. In January 2020, the total volume of passenger population (including passengers

118

transferred by civil aviation, highway, rail way and waterway) was about 17.73 million

119

person/times, decreasing about 6.04% compared to 2019, while which was 3.75 million

120

person/times in February 2020, decreasing about 78.82% and 39.48% compared to January in

121

2020 and February in 2019, respectively. In March 2020, the total volume of passenger population

122

was 6.79 million person/times, increasing about 80.66% compared to February in 2020, but which

123

decreased about 45.89% compared to March in 2019. The total volume of public transport

124

population (including intercity passengers transferred by bus, subway taxi and tramcars) changed

125

rapidly in the same period. In January 2020 the total volume was about 250 million person/times,

126

while it was 41.77 million person/times in February 2020, decreasing about 83.29% and 48.23%

With rapidly decreasing of the volume of transport population, the air quality of Shenzhen

133

improved in 2020. Fig.4 illustrated the concentration variability of NO2, PM10 and PM2.5, both of

134

which decreased compared to 2019. The mean concentrations of NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 in 2020

135

from January to March were 21.82, 37.54 and 22.53 ug/m3, while which were 28.51, 44.52 and

136

28.02 ug/m3, respectively (Fig.4 (a)). More specifically, the concentrations of air pollutants varied

137

in the similar tendency of the volume of transport population in different time period of 2020. In

138

normal period, the concentrations of NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 were relatively higher with mean value

139

of 28.77, 52.77 and 30.86 ug/m3, while in social distancing period the mean value of which were

140

12.39, 26.83 and 19.33 ug/m3 (Fig.4 (b)), with an average decreasing ratio about 50%. In reopened

141

period, the concentrations of NO 2, PM10 and PM2.5 slightly increased with mean value of 22.16,

142

34.75 and 20.06 ug/m3, and which were both lower than the monitored results of the normal

143

period in 2020 and the same time period in 2019.

3.2 correlation and regression analysis of traffic control and travel restriction, air pollution

150

and COVID-19 infection

151

To reveal the relationship of traffic control and travel restriction, air pollution and

152

COVID-19 infection, both regression and correlation analysis among the travel intensity,

153

concentration of NO 2, PM10, PM2.5 and the number of confirmed cased were conducted. The one

154

sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov method test was used to evaluate the variable data distribution. The

155

results indicated that the distribution of NO 2, PM10, PM2.5 and travel intensity was normal with

156

standard deviation of 8.5, 14.85, 8.58 and 1.52, respectively, while the distribution of the number

157

of COVID-19 confirmed cases was not normal. Thus, Spearman’s correlation test, a wildly used

158

correlation method was conducted to analyze the relationship of the variables (Wang et al., 2019;

159

Ma et al., 2020). The results indicated that the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases shown

160

significant negative correlation with travel intensity (Table 1), with correlation coefficient -0.549

161

(0.01 level, 2 tailed), indicating reverse variable tendency of travel intensity and the number of

162

COVID-19 confirmed cases, which mean that traffic control and travel restriction would slow

163

down and prevent the spread of the viruses at the outbreak period. The concentration of NO2 also

164

shown a significant negative correlation with the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases

165

(correlation coefficient -0.433, 0.01 level, 2 tailed), a possible reason was that the increasing

166

number of COVID-19 confirmed cases inhibited the travel desire, and decreased volume of traffic

167

resulting in the reduction of NO 2 emissions. The travel intensity shown significant positive

168

correlation with the concentrations of NO2, PM10, and PM2.5, and the correlation coefficients were

169

0.765, 0.569 and 0.354 (0.01 level, 2 tailed), respectively, suggesting traffic-related air pollution in

170

Shenzhen. The air pollutants also had shown significant positive correlation with each other. The

171

correlation coefficient between NO2 and PM10, NO2 and PM2.5 were 0.556 and 0.411 (0.01 level, 2

172

The nonlinear regression of travel intensity and COVID-19 confirmed cased was illustrated

177

in Fig.6, the results fitted with cubic equation and the R2 equaled to 0.502 (n=73). The travel

178

intensity and the air pollutants fitted with linear regression, and the slopes were positive while R2

179

equaled to 0.34 (travel intensity with PM10), 0.52 (travel intensity with NO2) and 0.14 (travel

180

intensity with PM2.5), indicating a relatively strong correlation, and these results were in

181

accordance with the Spearman’s test results. The number of COVID-19 confirmed cases and the

182

air pollutants fitted with nonlinear regression, with R2 equaled to 0.25 (confirmed cases with NO2),

183

0.01 (confirmed cases with PM10) and 0.07 (PM2.5), indicating a relatively weak correlation.

4. Discussion and perspectives

190

The high agglomeration of air pollutants could facilitate the spread of the virus (Martelletti

191

and Martelletti, 2020), the study conducted by Cui et al., 2006 indicated that the mortality rate of

192

SARS shown linear relationship with the API (Air Pollution Index), increasing PM10, PM2.5, NO2, and

193

O3 shown associated increasing number of daily COVID-19 confirmed cases in 120 cities of China

194

(Zhu et al., 2020), and the results in this study indicated a significant correlation of the number of
8

195

COVID-19 confirmed cases and the traffic intensity of Shenzhen, and which had positive correlation

196

with the air pollutants. Thus, the generalized social distancing measures, such as traffic control and

197

travel restriction, although being considered as bold measures facing of political, economic, social and

198

religious challenges (Yezli and Khan, 2020), could be an efficient way to control and prevent the

199

spread of the viruses as well as improving the air quality. On the other hand, the air pollution

200

conditions could be a possible indicator for people to plan the travel during the epidemic prevention

201

and control period.

202

Besides, previous study conducted by Zhu et al. in the 120 cities of China indicated that air

203

pollutants shown significant correlation with COVID-19 confirmed cases, however, the relationship of

204

the confirmed cases with PM10 and PM2.5 was weak in this study. Possible reasons to explain were: first,

205

Shenzhen was one of the best air quality cities in China, the relatively low concentrations and little

206

fluctuation of the air pollutants in Shenzhen weakened the relationship of the variables statistically;

207

second, there might be a “scale effect” on the research results, which mean the different scale of the

208

study area and amount of data might result in different results; third, most of the studies focused on the

209

relationship between air pollution and respiratory diseases indicated that the health risk was positive

210

correlation with the exposure concentration of air pollutants and the exposure time (Krecl et al., 2020;

211

Phosri et al., 2020), the while the infection time of COVID-19 was relatively short (news reported that

212

a man with no mask was infected within 15 seconds while shopping in a food market,

213

https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_5844448. ), thus the correlation of air pollutants and

214

COVID-19 infection should be evaluated more accurately considering the COVID-19 infection and

215

pathogenesis as well as the air quality conditions. In order to reveal this, further studies focused on the

216

nexus could be considered to follow two routes: (1) the nexus of these variables among different cities

217

and countries, especially the cities with wildly different air quality conditions, (2) a comprehensive

218

study in one city, regarding the differences of the source of the air pollutants, different travel restriction

219

and traffic control measures and COVID-19 infection and pathogenesis. Moreover, differentiated

220

epidemic control and prevention measures should be considered according to the different situation of

221

cities as well as countries.

222

Our study had several limitations. First, the travel intensity data was processed daily data which

223

could not reveal the variability of traffic and travel population more accurately, hourly or minutely

224

traffic volume data of the main artery of the city were more useful for further analysis. Second, this

225

study was conducted with statistical method, the meteorological conditions were not considered. Third,

226

this study was conducted at city scale owing to the lack of sufficient data of other cities and countries.

227

Further studies should overcome these limitations and challenges, and the authors hope this study could

228

bring the researcher’s attention on the nexus of the generalized social distancing, air pollution and

229

COVID-19 infection, and conquer this novel disease.

230

5. Conclusion

231

Generalized social distancing, including traffic control and travel restriction has significant

232

correlation with the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases, which shows negative correlation with the

233

traffic intensity of the city, thus traffic control and travel restriction would slow down and prevent the

234

spread of the viruses at the outbreak period. NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 show significant positive correlation

235

with the traffic intensity, the research focused on the nexus of social distancing, air pollution and

236

COVID-19 should been enhanced in future.
