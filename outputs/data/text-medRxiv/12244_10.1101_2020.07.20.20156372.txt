Abstract:

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected millions of
people worldwide. PCR tests are currently the gold standard for diagnosis of the current
coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and serology tests are used to detect seroconversion in infected
patients. However, there is a lack of quantitative and ultra-sensitive viral antigen tests for COVID19. Here we show that Single Molecule Array (Simoa) assays can quantitatively detect SARSCoV-2 spike, S1 subunit, and nucleocapsid antigens in the plasma of COVID-19 patients.
Combined with Simoa anti-SARS-CoV-2 serological assays, we show correlation between
production of antibodies and clearance of viral antigens from serial plasma samples from COVID19 patients. Furthermore, we demonstrate the presence of viral antigens in blood correlates with
disease severity in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. These data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 viral
antigens in the blood could be a marker for severe COVID-19 cases.

Introduction
The current pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in over 13,000,000 confirmed
cases globally and over 135,000 deaths in the United States alone, as of July 16, 2020.(1) While
RT-PCR tests remain the gold standard for diagnosing COVID-19, PCR tests do not provide
adequate information on progression of the disease. Furthermore, PCR tests can give positive
results for several weeks after a patient has seroconverted or recovered.(2) Serological tests can
identify individuals who have mounted an immune response but cannot necessarily be used for
monitoring disease in the early stages of infection.(3–5) SARS-CoV-2 antigen assays can be used
for identifying active infection by measuring viral antigens in biofluids and can complement PCR
and serological tests. Currently there are two FDA approved SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests that detect
nucleocapsid in nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs.(6, 7) However, both tests provide qualitative results
and may only detect viral antigen within the first five days of symptom onset. Quantitative and
ultra-sensitive SARS-CoV-2 antigen assays could enable detection of viral antigens in blood,
saliva, or NP swabs. In addition, combining quantitative antigen assays with serological assays
could enable analysis of COVID-19 progression from early infection to seroconversion.
To address the need for a quantitative antigen assay, we developed ultra-sensitive Single
Molecule Array (Simoa) SARS-CoV-2 antigen assays for S1, spike (S1-S2 extracellular domain),
and nucleocapsid (N). The ultra-sensitivity of Simoa enables detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigens
in the plasma of COVID-19 positive patients. Additionally, Simoa provides a dynamic range that
allows quantification of antigens over a concentration range of four orders of magnitude. This
precise quantification is advantageous for capturing the wide range of antigen concentrations in
COVID-19 patient plasma throughout the course of hospitalization. We combined our Simoa
SARS-CoV-2 antigen assays with previously developed Simoa serological assays to detect SARSCoV-2 antigens and anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulins in longitudinal plasma samples of
COVID-19 patients. These measurements show inverse correlation between anti-SARS-CoV-2
antibody production and viral antigen clearance from plasma, which provides a unique view of
viral infection and immune response from the beginning of hospitalization through recovery or
death. In addition, we show that the presence of viral antigen in plasma correlates with disease
severity in these COVID-19 patients.

The SARS-CoV-2 Simoa antigen assays detect S1, spike, and N antigens with limits of
detection (LOD) of 5 pg/mL, 70 pg/mL, and 0.02 pg/mL, respectively. Three types of dye-encoded
paramagnetic beads were functionalized with antibodies against each viral antigen and incubated
with plasma samples for multiplexed Simoa measurements (Fig. 1a) as described previously.(8)
Commercially available SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were used in combination with an anti-S1
antibody discovered via phage display (Supplemental Materials). All SARS-CoV-2 antigen assays
were validated in commercial human plasma prior to analysis of clinical plasma samples (Fig. S1S3, Table S3). In addition, we measured anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulins (total IgA, IgM, and
IgG) using our recently established SARS-CoV-2 serological assays(9) to correlate viral antigens
with immunoglobulin levels (Fig. 1a). Although total IgG levels correlate with seroconversion in
COVID-19 patients, measurements of the IgG subclasses can reveal additional information on
patient-specific immune responses. Therefore, we developed SARS-CoV-2 serological Simoa
assays for IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4 detection (Supplemental Materials Methods). The
combined measurements of three SARS-CoV-2 antigens and seven anti-SARS-CoV-2
immunoglobulin isotypes against four SARS-CoV-2 antigens enables quantification of 31
biomarkers from 70 µL of a plasma sample.
To probe for the presence of viral antigens in plasma, we tested samples from COVID-19
positive patients using our SARS-CoV-2 Simoa antigen assays for S1, spike, and N. These patients
were determined to be COVID-19 positive by NP RT-PCR and all plasma samples were obtained
within the first ten days of the initial NP RT-PCR test. Both S1 and N were detected in 41 of 64
COVID-19 positive patients (Fig. 1b and 1c), who we identify as “viral antigen positive.” We
observe S1 and N concentrations spanning four orders of magnitude in these plasma samples.
Despite the presence of S1 and N in some samples, spike was only detectable in 5 of 64 COVID19 positive patients (Fig. S4). Spike may be undetectable in some samples since the LOD is one
order of magnitude higher than the LOD of the S1 assay. Additionally, in the Simoa assay for
spike, the formation of a full immunocomplex depends on spike binding to the S2 subunit capture
beads and the S1 subunit detection antibody. Therefore, we hypothesize that free spike antigen in
plasma is likely proteolytically cleaved, releasing the S1 subunit, and the remaining spike protein
fragment is undetectable by our assay.
Cross-reactivity of the SARS-CoV-2 antigen assays was assessed using samples from three
control patient cohorts: (1) samples from individuals who tested negative for COVID-19 by NP
RT-PCR, (2) pre-pandemic plasma samples from healthy individuals with no recorded respiratory
infection in their medical history at the time of collection, collected before October 1, 2019, and
(3) pre-pandemic samples collected from adults with a documented respiratory infection (including
bacterial and viral pneumonia) within two months of collection, collected before October 1, 2019.
Viral antigen concentrations are plotted for each individual patient in Fig. S5. In the pre-pandemic
sick cohort, either S1 or N were detected in 9 of 14 individuals, indicating cross reactivity with
other viruses, whereas only one sample from this cohort had both detectable S1 and N levels. Only
1 of 20 individuals from the pre-pandemic healthy cohort had detectable levels of both S1 and N.
In COVID-19 negative patients, S1 or N was detectable in 6 of 18 individuals. However, analytical
specificity was improved when assessing both S1 and N, resulting in only 1 of 18 COVID-19
negative patients with detectable levels of both viral antigens. We attribute detection of viral
antigens in COVID-19 negative patients to either (1) assay cross-reactivity with other
coronaviruses or (2) the patients with a negative NP RT-PCR test were COVID-19 positive but

received a false negative result.(10) Currently, only two SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests are approved
by the FDA and these tests qualitatively detect N antigen in NP swab samples. However, the FDA
cautions that a positive result does not rule out infection with other viruses, due to cross-reactivity
with other coronaviruses. Based on our preliminary results, a multiplexed approach for the
detection of S1 and N protein may enhance analytical specificity of these antigen tests.
The presence of SARS-CoV-2 antigens in plasma can provide unique insight into disease
progression in patients. However, it remains unclear why only a subset of patients shows detectable
levels of antigen in plasma. To address this question, we tested the same set of samples using the
SARS-CoV-2 serological Simoa assays for IgA, IgM, and IgG to examine correlations between
antigen and immunoglobulin levels. For COVID-19 positive patients, immunoglobulin levels vary
by four orders of magnitude (Fig. S6).(9) We observe an inverse correlation when comparing
immunoglobulin levels and antigen levels for each COVID-19 positive patient (Fig. 1d).
Corresponding N levels for each individual patient are plotted in Fig. S7. In several patients with
S1 levels below the limit of detection, immunoglobulin levels are high. Patients with high S1 levels
typically have IgG levels below the seroconversion threshold. However, some patients show
detectable levels of both S1 and IgG, whereas other patients show no detectable S1 or IgG. These
data highlight the diverse viral and immune responses present among COVID-19 patients.

To understand how antigen and immunoglobulin levels change with time after infection,
we performed longitudinal studies in COVID-19 positive patients to monitor viral antigen and
immunoglobulin levels during the course of hospitalization. This can be informative because
COVID-19 patients present to the hospital at various stages of disease and show diverse
progression patterns. We measured viral antigen levels (S1, spike, and N) and immunoglobulin
levels (total IgA, IgM, and IgG and IgG1-4) in serial plasma samples from 39 admitted patients at
Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital (patient IDs 1-39). All
patients were diagnosed as COVID-19 positive by NP RT-PCR and serial plasma samples were
collected between 0 and 30 days after the first positive NP RT-PCR test during hospitalization.
SARS-CoV-2 antigen and serological Simoa results for 31 biomarkers from all longitudinal
samples are presented in Fig. S8. Longitudinal antigen and immunoglobulin levels for four
representative patients are plotted in Fig. 2; plots for the remaining 35 patients are shown in the
Supplemental Materials. For each patient, we plot: (1) the total IgA, IgM, and IgG levels against
four viral antigens: N, receptor binding domain (RBD), S1, and spike, for a total of 12 interactions,
(2) N antigen levels with IgA, IgM, and IgG against N, (3) S1 antigen levels with IgA, IgM, and
IgG against S1, and (4) S1 antigen levels with IgG1-4 against S1. In this patient cohort, 25 of 39
patients had detectable levels of both S1 and N antigen in their plasma, whereas only 6 of 39
patients had detectable levels of spike in their plasma during their hospitalization.

The ultra-sensitivity of Simoa assays provides quantitative resolution of viral antigen and
antibody levels for a detailed view of patient responses over time. For example, in Fig. 2, Patient
21 originally had high concentrations of N (1,240 pg/mL) and S1 (75.3 pg/mL) and low
concentrations of anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulins in their plasma on Day 0. As patient 21
mounted an antibody response against the virus, indicated by the increase in immunoglobulin
levels over time, we observe a decrease in viral antigen levels in plasma. The ultra-sensitivity of
these SARS-CoV-2 Simoa assays enables us to measure even the earliest stages of seroconversion.
Seroconversion was determined as previously described (See Methods for description)(9). This
trend is observed for a majority of viral-antigen positive patients (Patient 21, 22, and 26 in Fig. 2
and Patients in Figs. S10, S12-14, S19-20, S23, S26, S31, S34, S36). As shown in Fig. 2, among
Patients 21, 22, and 26, once a patient has seroconverted and their plasma immunoglobulin levels
reach a steady state, there are typically no detectable levels of viral antigen. All patients
seroconvert an average of 7 ± 1 days (95% CI) after the first NP RT-PCR positive test, in agreement
with previous serological studies.(11–14) We defined viral antigen clearance as the first day that
both S1 and N were undetectable in patient’s plasma. For viral antigen positive patients, full
antigen clearance in plasma is observed 5 ± 1 days (95% CI) after seroconversion.

Furthermore, we observe a subset of patients with no detectable viral antigen levels in their
plasma throughout their hospitalization. Notably, 13 of 15 patients with undetectable viral antigen
levels in plasma were already seroconverted at their first NP RT-PCR test. For example, Patient
39 in Fig. 2 showed no detectable N or S1 in plasma over ten days during hospitalization. Patient
39 had already seroconverted when the first plasma sample was collected, an observation
consistent for a majority of viral antigen negative patients (Fig. S11, S15-17, S18, S24,S27-28,
S30-33, S35, S7-44).We propose three possibilities for the lack of detectable antigen in some
patient plasma: (1) patients are presenting to the hospital after seroconversion, and therefore most
viral antigens have been cleared from the plasma, (2) patients do not progress to more severe forms
of the disease and therefore do not have viral antigen leakage into the blood, or (3) viral antigens
are present but are bound to an immunoglobulin and the immunoglobulin blocks a binding epitope
of the capture or detection antibody, resulting in an antigen-immunoglobulin complex that is
undetectable by our Simoa assays. However, even with no detectable levels of viral antigen, 12 of
16 patients were admitted or transferred to the ICU during hospitalization and intubated, indicating
that these patients were severe cases. Therefore, we propose a third possibility where patients have
seroconverted and despite reaching viral clearance, suffer from severe respiratory damage that
inhibits recovery.
To further analyze the 31 biomarkers measured in these longitudinal samples, we
performed a cluster map analysis to determine if antigen and immunoglobulin levels in COVID19 positive patients could differentiate different stages of infection. We used a Ward variance
minimization algorithm (Supplemental Materials Methods) to perform hierarchical clustering. The
cluster map shows three dominant branches (Fig. 3) representing three clusters of samples that are
grouped based on similarity between the 31 biomarker values. The first branch is observed for
early time points where we observe an inverse relationship between high levels of viral antigens
and low levels of antibodies. The second branch shows a transition in patient samples where
antigen levels begin to decrease as total IgM, IgA, and IgG (as well as IgG subclasses IgG1 and
IgG3) begin to increase. In the third branch, we see an even further reduction in antigen levels with
small increases in IgG subclasses IgG2 and IgG4 (relative to their average values across samples).
The third branch is observed for later time points where we propose that patients have cleared viral
antigens from the plasma and antibodies have reached their steady-state levels. For all 39 patients
in this cohort, we observe that IgG1 and IgG3 show large increases in plasma concentrations over
time. In contrast, IgG2 and IgG4 show little to no changes above background levels over time
(note that cluster map data is standardized so all values are relative for each biomarker). Both IgG1
and IgG3 are subclasses of IgG that predominantly respond to viral antigens and mediate
neutralization.(15–19) Based on these measurements, the IgG response that is mounted by the
immune system is primarily mediated by IgG1 and IgG3 for SARS-CoV-2, in agreement with
previous serological studies.(4, 5) The neutralization effects of IgG1 and IgG3 on viral antigens
should be explored in future studies that include correlative neutralization titer assays.

Fig. 4 and patient features are summarized in Table S4. For each patient in Fig. 4, the date that
each plasma sample was collected is indicated by an X. Plasma samples with significant detectable
levels of antigen (concentrations two times above the LOD) are indicated with a black X and
plasma samples with no significant detectable levels of antigen are indicated with a blue X. In this
patient cohort, NP RT-PCR tests reported positive results for an average of 15 ± 5 days after viral
antigen clearance and 18 ± 4 days after seroconversion. Furthermore, several patients never
received a negative RT-PCR result before being discharged from the hospital. These observations
are in agreement with recent virological studies that confirmed persistence of viral RNA and
showed how seroconversion was not immediately followed by a decrease in NP viral RNA in
hospitalized patients.(20) Because RNA shedding can occur for several weeks after infection and
recovery, measurements of viral antigens and immunoglobulins may provide more accurate and
timely indicators of disease progression and recovery compared to viral RNA.

Finally, we demonstrate that the presence of viral antigens in plasma correlates with certain
indicators of disease severity in COVID-19 patients. To understand the correlation between SARSCoV-2 antigen levels and disease severity, clinical features for the 64 COVID-19 positive patients
(Fig. 5, patient IDs 1-64) were compared with viral antigen levels in plasma. It is important to note
that all samples were obtained from patients admitted to the hospital, resulting in a cohort of
primarily severe cases. For patients with serial samples, we analyzed the first plasma sample
collected after the initial positive NP RT-PCR test. Viral-antigen-positive patients show detectable
levels of both S1 and N in plasma; however, S1 shows higher correlation with clinical severity
(Table S5-8, Fig. S45). Therefore, patients were grouped into three categories of S1
concentrations: (1) 23 patients with undetectable S1 levels (below the limit of detection), (2) 23
patients with low levels of S1 (6-50 pg/mL), and (3) 18 patients with high levels of S1 (>50
pg/mL). The cutoff between groups 2 and 3 (50 pg/mL) was chosen as five standard deviations
above the LOD. There is a significant difference in rates of ICU admission upon presentation for
patients with varying levels of S1 in plasma (p value: 0.0107). Patients with zero, low, and high
levels of S1 were admitted to the ICU upon presentation to the hospital at rates of 30%, 52%, and
77%, respectively (Fig. 5a). However, 13 of 19 patients initially admitted to non-ICU dispositions
were later transferred to the ICU during hospitalization, as summarized in Table S4. Among all
COVID-19 positive patients, over 60% were intubated during hospitalization with no statistically
significant difference in intubation rates among groups (Fig. 5b). All patients with high levels of
S1 were intubated within one day of hospitalization, whereas patients with zero and low S1 levels
were intubated within a range of zero to ten days post-admission (Fig. 5c). The difference in mean
times to intubation between patients with high levels of S1 and patients with no detectable S1 is
significant (p-value: 0.0050). These results suggest that high S1 levels in plasma upon presentation
to the hospital correlate with severe cases of COVID-19 that can result in respiratory failure and
require immediate intubation. Among all patients, a broad range of intubation periods, up to 32
days, was observed (Fig. 5d). Once intubated, there is no statistically significant difference in mean
intubation periods among patient groups. No statistically significant difference in death rate was
observed for patients with zero, low, and high levels of S1, where 5 of 23, 5 of 23, and 8 of 18 of
patients died, respectively (p-value: 0.1921). Although six patients showed detectable levels of
spike protein, there was no correlation between spike concentrations and ICU admission,
intubation rate, or death rate. These results show a high level of diversity and complexity in the
responses and disease trajectories in each patient. There are potentially more features in these data
that will lead to further correlations, but a large cohort of patients will need to be tested to elucidate
other patterns.

presentation to the hospital. b.) Fraction of COVID-19 positive patients who were intubated during
hospitalization. c.) Days between date of presentation to the hospital and intubation date for intubated
COVID-19 positive patients. d.) The length of intubation for intubated COVID-19 positive patients. For
all plots, significance indicated by the asterisks (p value <0.05).

Compared to RT-PCR tests, immunoassay-based antigen and serological tests have the
advantage of speed and simplicity when integrated into point-of-care platforms. Plasma is a readily
available biofluid from hospitalized patients but is more difficult to obtain in non-clinical settings.
Saliva is a non-invasive biofluid that is easier to use for wide-scale testing. Therefore, we explored
the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antigens and anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulins in saliva (Fig.
S47, S48, S49). We tested 19 saliva samples from patients presenting to the Emergency
Department and show that 8 of 19 patients have detectable levels of S1. Similar to our observations
of antigen and immunoglobulin levels in plasma, saliva S1 and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels
show negative correlation. These initial results indicate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antigens and
anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulins in saliva and highlight the potential for adapting our assays
to a diagnostic test for COVID-19. Future studies on saliva will include longitudinal sample
analysis for mild and severe cases of COVID-19 patients and will explore the potential for
developing a saliva-based COVID-19 antigen screening tool.
Using SARS-CoV-2 Simoa assays, we demonstrate quantitative detection of SARS-CoV2 antigens and anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulins in plasma of COVID-19 patients. While
detection of N in NP swabs has been cited,(6) we present the first report of SARS-CoV-2 spike,
S1, and N detection in plasma. The presence of S1 and N in plasma suggest that fragments of virus
are entering the bloodstream, potentially due to tissue damage. Although spike is undetectable in
most COVID-19 patients, possibly due to proteolytic cleavage, six patients show high levels of
spike in plasma. We hypothesize that some spike is not proteolytically cleaved, especially in cases
where there are high levels of spike in plasma. No evidence has been reported yet for full viral
particles in blood, though we cannot rule out this possibility.(21) Nonetheless, severe COVID-19
cases with acute respiratory distress syndrome can result in damage to endothelial cells and
vascular leakage(22–25) and we propose that this damage can lead to discharge of viral antigens
into the blood. Patients with lung damage can suffer from respiratory failure and require intubation
or mechanical ventilation. We also report significant correlation between high S1 levels in plasma
and time between hospital admission and intubation. In situations where ICUs have limited
capacity, there is urgent need to prioritize severe COVID-19 patients. Our initial results suggest
that detecting viral antigen levels in plasma could aid in patient stratification and may indicate
when patients require immediate medical intervention, such as intubation. Although we

hypothesize that asymptomatic or mild cases will likely not show viral antigen levels in plasma,
future studies that include mild cases will be used to probe SARS-CoV-2 antigen and antibody
levels over time in comparison to the severe cases presented here.

Methods

Plasma Samples:
Clinical samples were obtained from adult patients presenting to Brigham and Women’s Hospital
through the Partner’s biobank and patients from Massachusetts General Hospital. 34 samples
termed pre-pandemic, defined by a collection date before October 1, include 20 samples from
healthy patients and 14 samples from sick patients with upper respiratory infections, bacterial
pneumonia, viral pneumonia, or unspecified virus positive. 17 samples were from patients who
tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 using nasopharyngeal RT-PCR. 64 samples were from patients
who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 using nasopharyngeal RT-PCR.
Serial timepoint clinical samples were obtained from patients admitted to Massachusetts General
Hospital (n= 67 samples from 19 individual patients) and Brigham and Women’s Hospital (n= 205
samples from 24 patients) diagnosed as SARS-CoV-2 positive by a nasopharyngeal RT-PCR.
Several timepoint samples were taken 0-30 days after the first SARS-CoV-2 positive
nasopharyngeal RT-PCR test per patient.
All plasma samples were not heat inactivated and diluted in Homebrew Sample Diluent
(Quanterix) to their final dilution factor. All samples were collected under approval of the Partners
Institutional Review Board for Human Subjects Research.
Anti-S1 antibody discovery and expression
The Mehta I/II 2.7x1010 member non-immunized scFv-phage library was used to perform three
rounds of panning against SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein (Sino Biologicals, Wayne, PA). Nunc
MaxiSorp Immuno tubes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) were coated with SARS-CoV2 S1 protein overnight in PBS and the SARS-CoV-2 S1 coating concentration was decreased in
each round to increase the affinity of the enriched antibodies. Screening of the enriched library
was performed by picking single bacterial colonies from the 3rd round of panning. Small scale
rescue was performed and the phage supernatant was used to screen via SARS-CoV-2 RBD coated
ELISA plates. The recovered antibody was converted to hIgG1 and expressed transiently by
transfection into Expi293F cells via ExpiFectamine (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).
The cells were cultured for four days before the supernatant was harvested and cells pelleted.
Clarified supernatant was mixed with Protein A Sepharose 4B beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA) overnight before purification via gravity flow columns. Purified protein was buffer
exchanged into PBS via Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Units (MilliporeSigma, Burlington,
MA).

Preparation of Viral Antigen Simoa Reagents:
Antibody conjugation to beads. Antibodies against S1, S2, and Nucleocapsid were conjugated to
carboxylated 2.7 µm paramagnetic Homebrew beads, 700 nm dye-encoded beads, and 750 nm
dye-encoded beads (Quanterix), respectively. For each bead conjugation, 2.27x108 beads were
washed three times with 200 µL of Bead Wash Buffer (Quanterix) and then three times with 200
µL of Bead Conjugation Buffer (Quanterix). The beads were resuspended in 297 µL Bead
Conjugation Buffer and 3 µL of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride
(EDC), freshly dissolved to 10 mg/mL in Bead Conjugation Buffer, was added. The beads were
shaken for 30 minutes at 4 °C and then washed once with 300 µL Bead Conjugation Buffer before
resuspending in 250 µL Bead Conjugation Buffer and adding 50 µL capture antibody (1 mg/mL).
The beads were shaken for two hours at 4 °C for antibody conjugation, washed twice with 200 µL

Bead Wash Buffer, and blocked with 200 µL Bead Blocking Buffer (Quanterix) for 30 minutes at
room temperature. After blocking, the beads were washed once with 200 µL Bead Wash Buffer
and then 200 µL Bead Diluent (Quanterix), before resuspending in 200 µL Bead Diluent. The
beads were counted using a Beckman Coulter Z1 Particle Counter and stored at 4 °C for subsequent
use.
Biotinylation of detector antibodies. Each detector antibody was conjugated to EZ-Link NHSPEG4-Biotin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) by adding 3 µL NHS-PEG4-Biotin (2 mg freshly
dissolved in 383 µL deionized water) to 100 µL antibody (1 mg/mL in PBS). The mixture was
incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature and then purified using a 50 kDa 0.5 mL Amicon
filter (MilliporeSigma), with five washes in Biotinylation Reaction Buffer (Quanterix) at 14000xg
for five minutes. The filter was then inverted and centrifuged for two minutes at 1000xg, and
washed with 50 µL Biotinylation Reaction Buffer before centrifuging again for two minutes at
1000xg. The biotinylated antibody concentration was measured with a NanoDrop
spectrophotometer.

format according to the manufacturer’s instructions and as previously described. (24) Plasma
samples were diluted 8-fold in Homebrew Detector/Sample Diluent (Quanterix Corp.) with Halt
Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Thermo Fischer Scientific) and EDTA. Detector antibodies were
diluted in Homebrew Detector/Sample Diluent to 0.3 µg/mL, and streptavidin-β-galactosidase
(SβG) concentrate (Quanterix) was diluted to 150 pM in SβG Diluent (Quanterix). Antibodyconjugated capture beads were diluted in Bead Diluent, with a total of 500,000 beads per reaction
(125,000 S1 beads, 125,000 S2 beads, and 250,000 647 nm dye-encoded helper beads for the S1/S2
multiplex assay, and 125,000 nucleocapsid beads and 375,000 647 nm dye-encoded helper beads
for the nucleocapsid assay). All reagents were diluted in plastic bottles that were loaded into the
HD-X Analyzer, and all assay steps were performed in an automated manner on the instrument. In
each assay, capture beads were incubated with the sample for 15 minutes, detector antibody for 5
minutes, and SβG for 5 minutes, with washing steps in between. The beads were then resuspended
in 25 µL resorufin-β-galactopyranoside and loaded into the microwell array for imaging. Average
enzyme per bead (AEB) and sample concentration values were calculated by the HD-X Analyzer
software. All samples were measured in duplicates.
Immunoglobulin Assays
SARs-CoV-2 serological Simoa assays were prepared and preformed as previously described.(9)
Plasma samples were diluted 4000-fold in Homebrew Detector/Sample Diluent (Quanterix Corp.)
SARs-CoV-2 serological Simoa assays for IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4 were developed against 4
viral antigens S1, N, spike, and RBD as previously described. The detection antibodies from
commercial sources are listed below. Simoa assays were performed on an HD-X Analyzer
(Quanterix) in an automated three-step assay format according to the manufacturer’s instructions
and as previously described.(8) Plasma samples were diluted 500-fold in Homebrew
Detector/Sample Diluent (Quanterix Corp.)

Data Analysis
Seroconversion Thresholding
Seroconversion classification based upon the early stage classification model trained using an
independent panel of 142 positive samples by RT-PCR SARS-Cov-2 and 200 negative prepandemic controls. The markers for this model were chosen using a cross-validation step. This
cross-validation yielded four markers (IgA S1, IgA Nucleocapsid, IgG Nucleocapsid, and IgG
Spike) and exhibited the best performance in the training set. The threshold for a positive test result
for the unknown samples was determined based on the cutoff that yielded 100% specificity in the
training set. (9)
Standardizing the biomarkers for visualization and downstream analysis
This standardization was performed so that all the biomarkers can be placed on the same scale.
Throughout the text when we refer to standardized data, the following procedure was performed.
First, the minimum nonzero value for each biomarker was stored, then the resulting vector was
divided by 100 and added to every samples corresponding biomarker value, which is necessary for
log transformation. The data was log transformed and then a second transformations step was
performed such that each biomarker across the samples has an empirical mean of zero and variance
of one. This is achieved by computing the mean and variance for each biomarker, subtracting the
mean, and then dividing by the variance.
Cluster Map Analysis
The cluster map analysis was performed on the standardized data. Samples were removed if they
had any missing values (reduced the number of samples from 272 to 252). Specifically the cluster
map is a hierarchical clustering based on the Ward variance minimization algorithm,
(https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.cluster.hierarchy.linkage.html).

Dilution Linearity and Spike & Recovery
Healthy K2EDTA human plasma (pooled gender) was purchased from BioIVT for assay validation
experiments (Spike & Recovery and Dilution Linearity). Three samples (three different sets of
pools) were used for all validation experiments. For all experiments, plasma samples were diluted
with Homebrew Detector/Sample Diluent (Quanterix) with 1X Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail
(ThermoFisher Scientific #78438). For Dilution Linearity experiments, plasma samples were
diluted to 4X and spiked with a final concentration of either (1) 2,000 pg/mL nucleocapsid or (2)
2,000 pg/mL S1 and 2,000 pg/mL Spike. Samples were then serially diluted to 8X, 16X, and
32X. Antigen concentrations are plotted as a function of 1/Dilution Factor below in Figure S3.
Data for each sample were fit to a linear regression and R2 values were calculated. R2 values for
all three plasma samples were >0.98 for S1, >0.95 for Spike, and >0.98 for Nucleocapsid. Error
bars represent the standard deviations of duplicate measurements. Some errors bars are narrow and
encompassed within the data point.

For spike and recovery experiments, plasma samples were diluted to 8X and spiked with a final
concentration of (1) 2,000 pg/mL, 400 pg/mL, or 80 pg/mL nucleocapsid for the nucleocapsid
assay, or (2) 2,000 pg/mL, 400 pg/mL, or 80 pg/mL S1 and Spike for the S1/ Spike assay.
Plasma samples at 8X dilution with no spiked recombinant protein (blank sample) were also
analyzed. For each spiked sample, the concentration of antigen in each blank sample (0 pg/mL
recombinant protein) was subtracted from the measured concentration before calculating percent
recovery. Percent recoveries for each sample and assay are displayed below in Table S2.

To confirm that splitting the patients into three groups based on S1 levels in plasma did not
affect the results of analysis of clinical outcomes (compared to splitting patients into two groups:
undetectable S1 levels and detectable S1 levels), we repeated the statistical analysis using two
patient groups. The results are shown below in Table S5. When split into two groups, the
differences in fraction of patients admitted to the ICU and mean days between hospitalization and
intubation are still significant.

two groups based on S1 levels: (1) undetectable N levels (below the limit of detection/LOD) and
(2) detectable N levels (above the LOD).

In addition to S1, we assessed if nucleocapsid levels in plasma are indicators of disease
severity in COVID-19. The results are plotted below in Figure S43 and the results of the statistical
analysis are shown in Table S6. For nucleocapsid, the difference in fraction of patients admitted
to the ICU upon presentation is significantly different between the two groups (Figure S43A).
Differences of all other clinical markers of severity are not statistically significant.

Figure S48. Correlated S1 and IgA (against S1) levels in individual patient saliva samples.
S1 levels measured below the LOD (5 pg/mL in saliva) are considered undetectable. IgA levels
with AEB< 0.05 are considered background level readings. COVID-19 positive patients are
plotted on the left side of the graph (S1-S12) and COVID-19 negative patients are plotted on the
right side of the graph (S13-S19).
