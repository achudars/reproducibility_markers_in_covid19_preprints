Abstract
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) broke out in Wuhan, Hubei province,
China, in December 2019 and soon after Chinese health authorities
took unprecedented prevention and control measures to curb the spreading of the novel coronavirus-related pneumonia. We develop a mathematical model based on daily updates of reported cases to study
the evolution of the epidemic. With the model, on 95% confidence
level, we estimate the basic reproduction number, R0 = 2.82 ± 0.11,
time between March 19 and March 21 when the effective reproduction
number becoming less than one, the epidemic ending after April 2 and
the total number of confirmed cases approaching 14408 ± 429 on the
Chinese mainland excluding Hubei province.

A novel coronavirus disease, named COVID-19, broke out in Wuhan, Hubei
province, China, in December 2019. On 20 January 2020, the National Health
Commission of the People’s Republic of China announced the top-level prevention and control measures against pneumonia, and China determined to
curb the spreading of the disease effectively [1, 2]. The current epidemic
situation on the Chinese mainland is shown in Figure 1, with data in use
listed in Table 1. Checking the curve of cumulative confirmed cases, we can
see there is an abrupt change of increasing trend around January 28, being

observed on the curve of cumulative removed cases (recoveries plus deaths),
with delay of a few days. The change indicates the control measures have
taken in effect. How to evaluate the effect quantitatively, and in particular,
to predict the evolution of the disease would be highly desired.

Figure 1: Epidemic curves of reported COVID-19 cases on the Chinese mainland since 20 January 2020. Data are collected from the official
web pages of the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of
China [3] and cross-checked with reports on the official web pages of the
Health Commission of Hubei Province [4]. In the legend, HB stands for
Hubei province, and I and R represent two categories to be fitted with an
mathematical model.
Many epidemic models exist to describe spreads of infectious diseases
mathematically [5]. The central role of modelling is to estimate the basic reproduction number, R0 , defined as the expected average number of secondary
cases infected by a typical primary case in a fully susceptible population, as
well as the effective reproduction number, Rt , defined as the actual average
number of secondary cases per primary case during an epidemic. Different
approaches [6, 7] have been taken for the purpose. A study on COVID-19 in
Wuhan [8] is also reported. In rapid development of an infectious disease like

COVID-19 in China and in the world, however, these approaches are very
difficult in use, if not impossible, or lack of accuracy.
We consider a mathematical model purely based on categorised reported
cases, because we believe that key epidemic features will be convolved in the
evolution of an infectious disease, namely, the statistics of epidemic data.
Should such a model can be fitted with data reasonably well, some epidemic
parameters can be extracted. Let’s take the number of cumulative confirmed
cases (A), the number of cumulative recovered cases (C) and the number of
cumulative deaths (D). We define the number of cumulative removed cases
(R) as R = C + D, and the number of current infectives (I) as I = A − R.
We assume change rates of both I and R are proportional to I (justification
of this assumption will been discussed later),

where ρ denotes the change rate of I and in general varies with time, γ is the
change rate of R and can be regarded as a constant. For the time varying ρ,
the equation (1a) can be solved analytically

ρ(t) =

ρ1 − ρ2 ln

where T1 is a transition time when the rate changes from a constant to a
time dependent variable due to disease control measures taking effect, and
both ρ1 and ρ2 are constants. Then, we have

I(t) =

where Io = I(t = 0) is a constant. Considering the existence of an infectious period, the transition time of R(t) will be different from that of I(t).
Therefore, R(t) can be expressed as

where T2 is a transition time of R, and Ro = R(t = 0), being a constant. Ro
is related to Io by Ro = γIo /ρ1 . But in principle, both Io and Ro are just
arbitrary constants because we choose time zero randomly.
We use (3) and (4) to fit epidemic curves. For various reasons, reported
numbers of cumulative confirmed cases in Hubei are comparatively less reliable. Particularly, there is a jump on February 12, seeing Figure 1 and
Table 1, due to the addition of clinically diagnosed cases (only applicable
to Hubei province) to previously laboratory confirmed cases. On the other
hand, numbers of cumulative confirmed cases, recoveries and deaths of other
provinces on the Chinese mainland are quite reliable since January 20 when
the National Health Commission started to daily report the epidemic situation. Therefore, we apply the model to the epidemic data excluding Hubei.
We fit, in Figure 1, the curve of current infectives (I) with (3) and the
curve of cumulative removed cases (R) with (4) simultaneously. During the
fitting procedure, the parameters ρ1 and ρ2 are shared, and others are free to
vary. The fit method is minimisation of a chi-square (χ2 ) using data errors.
The data errors are estimated on the base of single counting uncertainty. Let
Ai , Ci and Di separately stand for cumulative confirmed cases, cumulative
recoveries and cumulative deaths reported as √
of i-th day. By definition,
Ii = Ai −
√Ci − Di and Ri = Ci + Di , we have Ai + Ci + Di for the error
of Ii and Ci + Di for the error of Ri , respectively. Fitting results are shown
in Figure 2 and summarised in Table 2. The covariance matrix and the
correlation matrix of fit parameters are also reported in Table 3 and Table 4,
respectively. The 95% confidence intervals have been calculated for I, R as
well as A, also shown in Figure 2.
The spreading trend of COVID-19 on the Chinese mainland (excluding
Hubei) could be predicted with the model. With the fitting results, the
number of current infectives would be less than one after April 2 with 95%
confidence level (CL)1 , that can be regarded as the ending of the disease.
Meanwhile, the total number of confirmed cases would approach 14408±429.
In addition, we see the current infectives peaks around February 11. Should
we perform the same analysis on data before the peaking date, we could
obtain similar results, but with comparatively larger uncertainties, as shown
in Figure 3, confirming the predictability of the method.
Our model and results can be compared to the classic Susceptible-InfectiveRemoved (SIR) model. The SIR model divides the population into compart1

All uncertainties of predictions in the paper are reported on 95% confidence level.

measures have taken effect significantly, hence suppressing the contact rate

with time; on the other hand, the population in China is more than 1.4
billion and modern transportation methods, e.g., high speed trains, have
brought all people in the country as a whole being susceptible, eliminating
the depletion effect of susceptibles. The latter causes S ≈ N can be regarded
as being infinite, or a constant. Consequently the equations in (5) reduce to
our model in (1) with
ρ = β − γ.
(6)
Before the transition time T1 , ρ1 = β − γ, being a constant, justifying our
previous assumption for the model. To estimate γ, we cannot use Io and Ro
directly because the time zero, t = 0, in our analysis is arbitrarily chosen
and the two constants are subject to large fluctuation. Instead, we can take
the epidemic meaning of 1/γ and interpret its equivalence to the transition
time difference between R and I, namely,
1/γ = T2 − T1 .
Resolving β and γ, we can estimate the basic reproduction number

To quantify the impact of control measures, however, we should use the
effective reproduction number, Rt . The spreading of an epidemic will stop
when Rt become less than 1 persistently. With respect to the time dependent

The stability and consistency of our model can be verified by fitting the

with data as of February 5 in order to have enough statistics. For each fit,
we extract R0 and the date, TR1 , with Rt = 1. Results are depicted in

are consistent within 95% confidence intervals during the epidemic so far.

Discussion The study provides a deterministic mathematical model to
analyse and predict characteristics of an infectious disease spreading in an extremely large population with strong prevention and control measures. The
model depends purely on statistic data of categorised epidemic cases reported
in public. We apply the model to the emergence of COVID-19 in China. Although the model is not yet perfect, it is effective, robust and consistent as
long as there is no sudden change in control measures. Comparing with the
classic SIR model, we extract the basic reproduction number, R0 , and make
predictions on the time when the effective reproduction number will become
less than one and on the total number of confirmed cases in the end. Our
study indicates that it is essential to take effective control measures as early
as possible for curbing an infectious disease and it is important to report
epidemic data precisely and timely for epidemiological modelling. In the era
of globalisation, an infectious disease can spread as far as any individual can
reach on the earth, that makes the whole world population to be susceptible.
As COVID-19 has spread around the world, we anticipate our method can
be adapted in modelling the spread and help public health authorities make
policy decisions.

Data are collected from the official web pages of the National Health Commission of the
People’s Republic of China [3] and cross-checked with reports on the official web pages of
the Health Commission of Hubei Province [4]. Data are collected from the official web
page of National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China. Only cases on
the Chinese mainland have been used in analysis. Numbers in the three rightmost
columns are defined in the text. ∗ Hubei Province added clinically diagnosed cases (only
applicable to Hubei province) to laboratory confirmed cases. † These numbers are
corrected according to reports of Health Commission of Hubei Province.
