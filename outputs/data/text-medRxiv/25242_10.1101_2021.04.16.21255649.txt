Summary

27

Background

28

Due to a limited initial supply of COVID-19 vaccines, the prioritisation of individuals for

29

vaccination is of utmost importance for public health. Here, we provide the optimal allocation

30

strategy for COVID-19 vaccines according to age in Japan and South Korea.

31
32

Methods

33

Combining national case reports, age-specific contact matrices, and observed periods

34

between each stages of infection (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Quarantined), we

35

constructed a compartmental model. We estimated the age-stratified probability of

36

transmission given contact (‫ݍ‬௜ ) using Bayesian inference method and simulated different

37

vaccination scenarios to reduce either case numbers or death toll. We also performed

38

sensitivity analyses on the proportion of asymptomatic cases and vaccine efficacy.

39
40

Findings

41

The model inferred age-stratified probability of transmission given contact (‫ݍ‬௜ ) showed

42

similar age-dependent increase in Japan and South Korea. Assuming the reported COVID-19

43

vaccine efficacy, our results indicate that Japan and South Korea need to prioritise individuals

44

aged 20–35 years and individuals aged over 60 years, respectively, to minimise case numbers.

45

To minimise the death toll, both countries need to prioritise individuals aged over 75 years.

46

These trends were not changed by proportions of asymptomatic cases and varying vaccine

efficacy on individuals under 20 years.

Interpretation

50

We presented the optimal vaccination strategy for Japan and South Korea. Comparing the

51

results of these countries demonstrates that not only the effective contact rates containing ‫ݍ‬௜

52

but also the age-demographics of current epidemic in Japan (dominance in 20s) and South

53

Korea (dominant cases over 50s) affect vaccine allocation strategy.

Introduction

56

The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an infectious disease caused by

57

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is still ongoing in a rapid

58

and a widespread manner. The high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 might be attributed to its

59

route of transmission (respiratory) and its viral shedding pattern (peak viral loads at the

60

symptom onset).1,2 These characteristics hinder efficient public health control of COVID-19.

61
62

Therefore, COVID-19 vaccines are expected to be a game changer for ending this pandemic.

63

Several promising vaccines are under development or have received emergency use

64

authorisation in many countries including the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States

65

(US).3-5

66
67

Vaccine supply, however, is expected to be limited in 2021. As of March 31, 2021, Japan

68

immunized 877,159 individuals (0·7%) and South Korea immunized 852,202 individuals

69

(1·6%) at least the first dose, which are far less proportions than countries in Europe and

70

America.6,7 Determination of who to prioritise for COVID-19 vaccination is an important

71

matter that plays a major role in curbing the growing burden of the disease.

72
73

Vaccinating the younger population, who have high contact rates, could lower the total

74

COVID-19 incidence, whereas targeting the elderly, who have high mortality rates, would

75

lower the death toll.8,9 Given the scarcity of vaccines, the World Health Organisation (WHO)

76

recommended to focus initially on direct reduction of mortality, and maintenance of most

critical essential workers.10 Likewise, many countries including the European Union, UK,

78

and the US announced interim recommendations in which healthcare personnel, long-term

79

care facility residents, and elderly people with various age cut-offs were prioritised for

80

COVID-19 vaccination.11,12 By contrast, Indonesia plans to vaccinate working young adults

81

before the elderly.13 Indeed, the vaccination strategy could vary in countries, and the optimal

82

allocation strategy could be informed by modelling studies accounting for country-specific

83

characteristics.

Here, we constructed the modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Quarantine (SEIQ) model,

86

using the observed distributions of the latent period (E

Epidemiologic data

96

The epidemiologic data consisted of COVID-19 reports provided by the Ministry of Health,

97

Labour and Welfare of Japan and the Ministry of Health and Welfare of South Korea.6,7 Both

98

governments report COVID-19 cases by 10-year age interval, diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2

99

polymerase chain reaction test. We could regard those numbers as real case numbers

100

according to the ascertainment levels close to 100% in Japan and South Korea, given the

101

baseline case-fatality ratio of 1·4%.15 The age-specific mortality ratios were also collected.6,7

102
103

Demography and contact matrix

104

Age-structured population data were obtained from the Statistics Bureau Japan and Statistics

105

Korea.16,17 We introduced contact matrices in our compartmental model, using the contact

106

survey data by Ibuka et al. for Japan, and projected contact matrix by Prem et al. for South

107

Korea.8,18 New contact matrix with 5-year age intervals was established for Japan from diary

108

data that included 4331 respondents using a bootstrap method.18,19

109
110

To capture the changes of contact patterns as a result of social distancing measures, we took

111

into account school closure policies and reduced contact rates at both work and other places

112

using Google mobility data.20-22 In Japan, most schools that had been temporarily closed

113

reopened on June 1, 2020, whereas in South Korea, school attendance has been capped at

114

two-thirds during national distancing level 1, one-thirds during level 2 (except for high

115

schools which remained 2/3), and remote learning only during level 3 throughout 2020

119

What we could observe is the age-stratified (10-year interval) incidence of COVID-19. This

120

was made compatible to the contact matrix by dividing the incidence data in 5-year instead of

121

10-year age groups proportionally to demographic structure. From previous epidemiologic

122

studies, we know the (i) incubation period distribution, (ii) transmission onset distribution

123

relative to symptom onset, and the (iii) delay from symptom onset to diagnosis.14 The (iv)

124

latent period distribution could be derived from both incubation period and transmission

125

onset distribution (Figure 2). In Japan and South Korea, individuals who have been diagnosed

126

with COVID-19 are isolated immediately; thus, the confirmation date could be regarded as

the date on which isolation had begun.

For those who never developed any symptoms (Iasym), accounting for 16% of total infection

by a meta-analysis23, we assumed that their (iv) latent period distribution is the same as those

who developed symptoms. Also, we regard that the infectious period distribution for Iasym is

the same as the total infectiousness period of symptomatic cases as suggested.24 We suppose

that the Iasym is quarantined at random during the infectious period, and the relative

Then, what is left to estimate is the age-stratified force of infection (S

Here, ߚ௜௝ is the rate at which susceptible in the age group ݅ and infectious individuals in the

wave possibly enhanced by a seasonality factor (Figure 1). We used the third wave mainly for

157

our simulation considering that this period could reflect the real characteristics of SARS-

158

CoV-2 transmission in each country not only excluding the importation factor, but also

159

including the effects of seasonality similar to other respiratory viruses. Thus, the study period

160

was set from October 15th to December 25th, 2020, for Japan prior to the winter vacation, and

161

from October 15th to December 22nd, 2020, for South Korea prior to the “ban of gathering of

162

five or more people”. During the third wave, people in their 20s still constituted most of the

163

confirmed cases in Japan following the second wave, whereas in South Korea, this shifted to

164

those over 50 during the third wave.

165
166

Vaccination scenarios

167

Using the SEIQ model, we could calculate how many cases and deaths would arise without

168

any intervention, including vaccination, after 2 weeks of the study period by means of

169

forward projection. We set this as the baseline scenario and explored how to allocate COVID-

170

19 vaccines according to age groups, with stepwise increase in vaccine supply relative to the

171

population size. Being vaccinated, the susceptible population in each age group would

172

decrease, and our ultimate goal was to find the optimal distribution of vaccines to reduce

173

COVID-19 cases and deaths.

174
175

Sensitivity analysis

176

Among model parameters, proportion of asymptomatic cases and vaccine efficacy were

177

hypothesised values. We thus tried to vary those values with sensitivity analysis. For the

178

proportion of asymptomatic cases, the meta-analysis showed that it ranged from 4% to 41%,

179

and we varied the parameter accordingly from 4% to 40%.23 As far as vaccine efficacy was

180

concerned, we adopted the age-dependent COVID-19 vaccine efficacy with statistical

181

significance.4 Since there is a paucity of information on vaccine efficacy of children, we first

182

assumed the same efficacy as young adults, and further analysed the sensitivity with half

183

efficacy of children. Lastly, we assumed the COVID-19 vaccine efficacy against

184

asymptomatic infection as 70% across all analyses.28

Results

191

Model estimation

192

The age-stratified probability ሺ‫ݍ‬௜ ሻ that a susceptible person of age group ݅ acquires

193

infection given contact with an infectious person was estimated as in Figure 3. Both Japan

194

and South Korea showed similar trends of age-dependent increase. The lowest ‫ݍ‬௜ value was

195

seen in the age group of 5 to 10 years (0·0043, 95% CI [0·0040–0·0045] in Japan and 0·0293,

196

95% CI [0·0270–0·0316] in South Korea), and the highest value was seen in the age group of

197

over 75 years (0·1599, 95% CI [0·1568–0·1628] in Japan and 0·1577, 95% CI [0·1518–

198

0·1637] in South Korea). The model parameters are summarised in Table 1.

Vaccine allocation by age groups

201

With a provision of 20% to 100% of COVID-19 vaccines, considering the population size of

202

Japan, the optimal vaccine allocation to reduce total case and death numbers are shown in

203

Figure 4A. With a provision of 20% to 100% of COVID-19 vaccines, considering the

204

population size of South Korea, the optimal vaccine allocation to reduce total case and death

205

numbers are shown in Figure 4B. The very first group to receive vaccination to reduce case

206

numbers is aged 20–35 years in Japan and aged over 60 years in South Korea. In the same

207

manner, the first group to receive vaccination to reduce the death toll is aged over 75 years in

208

both countries.

211

Assuming that there were no further intervention strategies including vaccination, during the

212

third wave, there might have been 75,767 cases and 1,046 deaths in Japan and 25,521 cases

213

and 529 deaths in South Korea in the following 2 weeks of the study period. With gradual

214

vaccination in both countries, the lowest number of cases and deaths are shown in Table 2.

Sensitivity analysis

217

Varying the proportion of asymptomatic cases from 4% to 40%, vaccine priority groups were

not changed in terms of case and death reduction. Likewise, reducing the vaccine efficacy of

individuals under 20 years to 50% did not change the priority, either (Supplementary Figure

222

Discussion

223

Given the limited initial availability of COVID-19 vaccines, the prioritisation of individuals

224

for vaccination is of utmost importance to public health workers and policy makers. Based on

225

mathematical modelling, we hereby present estimates to inform the distribution of COVID-19

226

vaccines among different age groups, both in Japan and South Korea, with a stepwise

227

increase in vaccine supply. Applying the reported COVID-19 vaccine efficacy,4 the initial

228

target groups to reduce the total incidence were young adults aged 20–35 years in Japan and

229

individuals aged over 60 years in South Korea. We interpret that this difference might be

230

attributed to the different age-group distribution of COVID-19 cases between Japan

231

(dominance in 20s) and South Korea (dominance over 50s) during the third wave, since the

232

force of infection ߣ௜ is not only affected by ߚ௜௝ , but also by ߇௝ which is the number of

233

infectious individuals in the age group. On the other hand, the target groups to reduce total

234

deaths were primarily focused on the elderly, aged over 75 years in both countries.

235
236

To achieve the best model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, we constructed a compartmental

237

model based on a solid epidemiological investigation which could increase the reliability of

238

our study.6,7,14 The estimated age-stratified probability of transmission given contact ሺ‫ݍ‬௜ ሻ

239

revealed similar results with other studies showing that children have lower probability of

240

transmission given contact.29 However, it is yet to be elucidated whether children are less

241

susceptible to COVID-19 or they show fewer clinical symptoms than adults, or both. To

242

specify the relative impact of those factors, a well-designed national seroprevalence study

243

would be necessary. In Japan and South Korea, seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 specific

244

antibodies were measured in local regions including the capital city from May to June 2020,

245

and the results ranged from 0·03% to 0·17% in Japan and 0·07% in South Korea. Owing to a

246

low seroprevalence in both countries, it was not appropriate to derive an answer to the above

247

question. Moreover, there is a caveat to interpret the ‫ݍ‬௜ results, since it could be affected by

248

contact numbers, ߶௜௝ . Japan showed much lower ‫ݍ‬௜ values for individuals aged below 10

249

years than South Korea, and we assumed that the different school closure policies could

250

explain the discrepancy; contrary to Japan, South Korea maintained restrictions on the

251

number of students in school and the ‫ݍ‬௜ might have decreased as low as Japan if it had not

252

regulated school attendance. In addition, previous studies suggested that older age might

253

contribute to vulnerability to COVID-19 infection, it is possible that biological aspects also

254

affect the value of ‫ݍ‬௜ then further investigation would be desirable in this area.30

255
256

There are several limitations to this study. First, although the contact matrix is the most

257

important variable in this model, we do not have empirical data for the current mixing

258

patterns. We tried to modify the existing prepandemic contact matrix to make it as realistic as

259

possible, but it might be insufficient to reflect reality. Besides, in the existing Japanese

260

contact matrix, the 20–29 year age group is marginally under-represented, and for South

261

Korean contact matrix, we had to adopt the estimated result, not the measured one, since

262

there was no available national survey data so far.8,18 Secondly, we did not take essential

263

worker status and co-morbidities into consideration for our model. Third, seasonality would

264

undoubtedly affect COVID-19 transmission, but it was hard to include this factor in our

265

model. Then, our estimation might not be sufficient for prediction in future seasons. Fourth,

266

the geographical heterogeneity was not considered in this study. In other words, differences in

267

frequency of contact between urban and rural areas could not be assessed here. Lastly, the

exact proportion of asymptomatic cases is still unelucidated. We adopted the results from a

269

meta-analysis and further conducted a sensitivity analysis with variable ranges of

270

asymptomatic proportion.23

271
272

Here, we present a realistic compartmental model for COVID-19 transmission based on the

273

reliable epidemiological investigation conducted in two East Asian countries, Japan and

274

South Korea. Furthermore, we provide the optimal distribution strategy of COVID-19

275

vaccines under limited vaccine supply in both countries. In short, the balance between age-

276

dependent effective contact rates and age-specific incidences should be considered for

277

national vaccination strategy. We believe that this study could guide public health

278

practitioners based on the solid mathematical model.

Research in context

402

Evidence before this study

403
404
405
406
407
408
409

We searched PubMed and MedRxiv for research articles published in English from database
inception until March 11, 2021, with the keywords "SARS-CoV-2", "COVID-19", "Vaccine",
"Immunization," "Distribution", "Allocation", and "Mathematical model". We found several
articles analysing the optimal distribution of COVID-19 vaccines fitted to each nation's
characteristics, notably in the US, UK, Germany, India, and South Korea. However, we
identified no research identifying age-specific force of infection to COVID-19 in East Asia,
further suggesting the optimal vaccination policy upon the mathematical model.

410
411

Added value of this study

412
413
414
415
416
417

Our study combined solid epidemiological data from Japan and South Korea and built the
reliable compartment model for SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Using the age-specific incidence
of COVID-19, we could estimate the age-stratified probability of transmission given contact
by Bayesian inference method, which was incorporated into the compartment model. By
virtue of this model, we could evaluate the effects of vaccine distribution scenarios by age in
terms of case and death reduction.

418
419

Implications of all the available evidence

420
421
422
423
424

Fortunately, safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines have been developed within an
unprecedented period. For now, how to implement vaccination most effectively is of utmost
importance. Here, we suggest the vaccine prioritisation strategy in Japan and South Korea,
and we believe it could be generalised to those who have a similar socio-demographic
background.
