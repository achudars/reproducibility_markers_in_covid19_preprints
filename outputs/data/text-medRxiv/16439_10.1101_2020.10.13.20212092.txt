Proteins detectable in peripheral blood may influence COVID-19 susceptibility or severity. However,
understanding which circulating proteins are etiologically involved is difficult because their levels may be
influenced by COVID-19 itself and are also subject to confounding factors. To identify circulating proteins
influencing COVID-19 susceptibility and severity we undertook a large-scale two-sample Mendelian
randomization (MR) study, since this study design can rapidly scan hundreds of circulating proteins and
reduces bias due to reverse causation and confounding. We identified genetic determinants of 931
circulating proteins in 28,461 SARS-CoV-2 uninfected individuals, retaining only single nucleotide
polymorphism near the gene encoding the circulating protein. We found that a standard deviation
increase in OAS1 levels was associated with reduced COVID-19 death or ventilation (N = 4,336 cases /
623,902 controls; OR = 0.54, P = 7x10-8), COVID-19 hospitalization (N = 6,406 / 902,088; OR = 0.61, P =
8x10-8) and COVID-19 susceptibility (N = 14,134 / 1,284,876; OR = 0.78, P = 8x10-6). Results were
consistent in multiple sensitivity analyses. We then measured OAS1 levels in 504 patients with repeated
plasma samples (N=1039) with different COVID-19 outcomes and found that increased OAS1 levels in a
non-infectious state were associated with protection against very severe COVID-19, hospitalization and
susceptibility. Further analyses suggested that a Neanderthal isoform of OAS1 affords this protection.
Thus, evidence from MR and a case-control study supported a protective role for OAS1 in COVID-19
outcomes. Available medicines, such as phosphodiesterase-12 inhibitors, increase OAS1 and could be
explored for their effect on COVID-19 susceptibility and severity.

Introduction

96

To date, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused more than 1.6 million deaths worldwide, and infected over

97

75 million individuals.1 Despite the scale of the epidemic, there are at present few disease-specific

98

therapies2. to reduce the morbidity and mortality of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and apart from

99

dexamethasone therapy in oxygen dependent patients 3, most clinical trials have shown at most mild or

100

inconsistent benefits in disease outcome.4–6 Therefore, validated targets are needed for COVID-19

101

therapeutic development.

102
103

One source of such targets is circulating proteins. Recent advances in large-scale proteomics have

104

enabled the measurement of thousands of circulating proteins at once and when combined with evidence

105

from human genetics, such targets greatly improve the probability of drug development success.7–9 While

106

de novo drug development will take time—even in the accelerated arena of COVID-19 therapies—

107

repurposing of currently available molecules targeting those proteins could also provide an accelerated

108

opportunity to deliver new therapies to patients.

109
110

Nevertheless, since confounding and reverse causation often bias traditional circulating protein

111

epidemiological studies, disentangling the causal relationship between circulating proteins and COVID-19

112

susceptibility or severity is challenging. This is especially the case in COVID-19, where exposure to

113

SARS-CoV-2 unleashes profound changes in circulating protein levels10. One way to address these

114

limitations is by using Mendelian randomization (MR), a genetic epidemiology method that uses genetic

115

variants as instrumental variables to test the effect of an exposure (here protein levels) on an outcome

116

(here COVID-19 outcomes). Given that genotypes are determined by randomly segregated alleles during

117

meiosis of parental gametes, this greatly reduces bias due to confounding. Since genotypes are always

118

assigned prior to disease onset, MR studies are not influenced by reverse causation. However, MR rests

119

on several assumptions11, the most problematic being the lack of horizontal pleiotropy of the genetic

120

instruments (wherein the genotype influences the outcome, independently of the exposure). One way to

121

help avoid this bias is to use genetic variants that influence circulating protein levels which are adjacent to

122

the gene which encodes the circulating protein through the use of cis-protein quantitative trait loci (cis-

123

pQTLs).9 Given their close proximity to the target gene, cis-pQTLs are likely to influence the level of the

124

circulating protein, among others, by directly influencing its transcription or translation, and therefore less

125

likely to affect the outcome of interest (COVID-19) through pleiotropic pathways. Nevertheless, a causal

126

genetic association between the exposure and outcome may be confounded by linkage disequilibrium

127

(LD, the non-random association of genetic variants assigned at conception).12 To probe this potential

128

problem, colocalization tests can assess for the presence of bias from LD.

129
130

Understanding the etiologic role of circulating proteins in infectious diseases is challenging because the

131

infection itself often leads to large changes in circulating protein levels10. Thus, it may appear that an

132

increase in a circulating protein, such as a cytokine, is associated with a worsened outcome, when in fact,

133

the cytokine may be the host’s response to this infection and help to mitigate this outcome. It is therefore

134

important to identify genetic determinants of the protein levels in the non-infected state, which would

135

reflect a person’s baseline predisposition to the level of a protein.

136
137

MR studies can be complemented by traditional case-control studies, where the protein is longitudinally

138

measured in COVID-19 patients and controls, allowing for an estimation of the association between the

139

protein level and COVID-19 outcomes. However, MR studies would tend to predict the effect of the

140

protein in the non-infectious state when the genetic determinants of such proteins are measured in the

141

non-infected population. Thus, longitudinal measurements of proteins can allow for a better

142

understanding of the role of such proteins in COVID-19 outcomes and also describe how their levels

143

respond to the infection. Since MR and case-control studies rely on different assumptions, and may be

144

influenced by different biases, concordant results between the two study designs can strengthen the

145

cumulative evidence through the concept of the triangulation of evidence13.

147

In this study, we therefore undertook two-sample MR and colocalization analyses to combine results from

148

large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of circulating protein levels and COVID-19

149

outcomes14 in order to prioritize proteins likely influencing COVID-19 outcomes. We began by identifying

150

the genetic determinants of circulating protein levels in large-scale protein level GWASs, then used MR to

151

assess whether these cis-pQTLs were associated with COVID-19 outcomes in the ICDA Host Genetics

152

Initiative COVID-19 outcomes GWASs. Next, we investigated expression QTL (eQTL) and splice QTL

153

(sQTL) effects of our lead proteins. We then measured the most promising protein, OAS1, in 504 subjects

154

ascertained for SARS-CoV-2 infection and when PCR positive, followed for longitudinal sampling during

155

and after their infection.

Results

158

MR using cis-pQTLs, and pleiotropy assessment

159

Study design is illustrated in Figure 1. We began by obtaining the genetic determinants of circulating

160

protein levels from six large proteomic GWAS of European individuals (Sun et al15 N=3,301; Emilsson et

161

al16 N=3,200; Pietzner et al17 N=10,708; Folkersen et al18 N=3,394; Yao et al19 N=6,861 and Suhre et al20

162

N=997). A total of 931 proteins from these six studies had cis-pQTLs associated at a genome-wide

163

significant level (P < 5x10-8) with protein levels, or highly correlated proxies (LD R2 > 0.8), in the meta-

164

analyses of data the from COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative21 which included results from the

165

GenOMICC program22. We then undertook MR analyses using 1,425 directly matched cis-pQTLs and 39

166

proxies as genetic instruments across six studies for their associated circulating proteins on three

167

separate COVID-19 outcomes: 1) Very severe COVID-19 disease (defined as individuals experiencing

168

death, mechanical ventilation, non-invasive ventilation, high-flow oxygen, or use of extracorporeal

169

membrane oxygenation. 99.7% of these individuals were of European ancestry) using 4,336 cases and

170

623,902 controls; 2) COVID-19 disease requiring hospitalization using 6,406 cases and 902,088 controls

171

of European ancestry and 3) COVID-19 susceptibility using 14,134 cases and 1,284,876 controls of

172

European ancestry. These case-control phenotype definitions are referred to as A2, B2, and C2 by the

173

COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative, respectively. In all outcomes, cases required evidence of SARS-CoV-

2 infection. For the very severe COVID-19 and hospitalization outcomes, COVID-19 cases were defined

175

as laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection based on nucleic acid amplification or serology tests. For

176

the COVID-19 susceptibility outcome, cases were also identified by review of health records (using

177

International Classification of Disease codes or physician notes).

178
179

MR analyses revealed that the levels of three circulating proteins, 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 1

180

(OAS1), interleukin-10 receptor beta subunit (IL10RB) and ABO were associated with at least two

181

COVID-19 outcomes after Benjamini & Hochberg FDR correction for the number of proteins tested (Table

182

1, Tables S1-6). We note that FDR correction is overly conservative given the non-independence of the

183

circulating protein levels. Notably, increased OAS1 levels were strongly associated with protection from

184

all three COVID-19 outcomes. Further, these effect sizes were more pronounced in severe and

185

hospitalization outcomes, such that each standard deviation increase in OAS1 levels was associated with

186

decreased odds of very severe COVID-19 (OR=0.54; 95% CI: 0.44-0.68, P=7.0x10-8), hospitalization

187

(OR=0.61; 95% CI: 0.51-0.73, P=8.3x10-8) and susceptibility (OR=0.78; 95% CI: 0.69-0.87, P=7.6x10-6)

188

(Figure 2A). We also identified OAS1 cis-pQTLs in Emilsson et al16 and Pietzner et al17 which were not

189

included in the MR analyses due to lack of genome-wide significance in their association with OAS1

190

levels or missing from initial protein panel. Undertaking MR analyses of using these additional cis-pQTLs,

191

we found concordant results (Table S7).

192
193

We next assessed whether the cis-pQTL associated with OAS1 levels (rs4767027) was associated with

194

any other phenotypes across more than 5,000 outcomes, as catalogued in PhenoScanner,23 which

195

collects associations of SNPs with outcomes from all available GWASs. We found that the only significant

196

association for rs4767027 was with circulating OAS1 levels (P=6.2x10-26) in plasma, whereas it was not

197

associated with any other traits or protein levels (P<5.0x10-5). These findings reduce the possibility that

198

the MR estimate of the effect of OAS1 on COVID-19 outcomes is due to horizontal pleiotropy. Finally,

199

except for the susceptibility outcome, the effect of rs4767027 did not demonstrate evidence of

200

heterogeneity across COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative GWAS meta-analyses (Table 1).

201
202

We next identified an independent SNP associated with OAS1 circulating protein levels, which was not at

203

the OAS1 locus and is thus a trans-SNP (rs62143197, P value for association with OAS1 levels =7.10 x

204

10-21). However, this SNP is likely subject to pleiotropic effects, since it is strongly associated with many

205

other proteins, such as annexin A2 (P=5.6 x 10-237) and small ubiquitin-related modifier 3 (P=9.1 x 10-178).

206

Consequently, including this trans-SNP could introduce bias from horizontal pleiotropic effects and was

207

thus not considered in further MR analyses. Further, this trans-association signal was unique to the

208

INTERVAL study17.

209
210

OAS proteins are part of the innate immune response against RNA viruses. They are induced by

211

interferons and activate latent RNase L, resulting in direct viral and endogenous RNA destruction, as

212

demonstrated in in-vitro studies.24 Thus OAS1 has a plausible biological activity against SARS-CoV-2.

213
214

Using a cis-pQTL for IL10RB (rs2834167), we found that one standard deviation increase in circulating

215

IL10RB level was associated with decreased odds for very severe COVID-19 (OR=0.47; 95% CI: 0.32-

216

0.68, P=7.1x10-5) and hospitalization (OR = 0.53; 95% CI: 0.39-0.73, P=8.8x10-5). However, circulating

217

IL10RB protein level was not associated with COVID-19 susceptibility. Using PhenoScanner, we could

218

not find evidence of pleiotropic effects of the cis-pQTL for IL10RB. The IL10RB cis-pQTL also showed a

219

homogeneous effect across the three COVID-19 outcomes except for susceptibility to COVID-19 (Table

220

1, Figure 2A). MR revealed that one standard deviation increase in circulating ABO level was associated

221

with increased odds of adverse COVID-19 outcomes (Table 1), however, we found that a cis-pQTL for

222

ABO (rs505922) was strongly associated with the levels of several other proteins, suggesting potential

223

horizontal pleiotropic effects (Table S8). Given ABO’s known involvement in multiple physiological

224

processes, these results were expected, but highlight that MR analyses may suffer from significant bias

225

from horizontal pleiotropy.

227

Colocalization Studies

228

To test whether confounding due to LD may have influenced the estimated effect of circulating OAS1 on

229

the three different COVID-19 outcomes, we tested the probability that the genetic determinants of OAS1

230

circulating protein level were shared with the three COVID-19 outcomes using colocalization analyses.

231

These were performed using coloc, a Bayesian statistical test implemented in the coloc R package.12 We

232

found that the posterior probability that OAS1 levels and COVID-19 outcomes shared a single causal

233

signal (the posterior probability for hypothesis 4 in coloc, PP4) in the 1Mb locus around the cis-pQTL

234

rs4767027 was 0.72 for very severe COVID-19, 0.82 for hospitalization due to COVID-19, and 0.89 for

235

COVID-19 susceptibility (Figure 3). This colocalization result was also replicated using cis-pQTLs for

236

OAS1 levels identified by Pietzner et al17 (Table S7). This suggests that there is likely a single shared

237

causal signal for OAS1 circulating protein levels and COVID-19 outcomes.

238
239

Colocalization of ABO levels and different COVID-19 outcomes also showed colocalization between ABO

240

level and different COVID-19 outcomes (posterior probability of single shared signal = 0.90, 0.98 and 1 for

241

ABO level and very severe COVID-19, hospitalization due to COVID-19 and susceptibility, respectively)

242

(Figure S1). We were unable to perform colocalization analyses for IL10RB due to a lack of genome-wide

243

summary level data from the original proteomic GWAS16.

244
245

Aptamer Binding Effects

246

Protein altering variants (PAVs)15 may influence binding of affinity agents, such as aptamers or

247

antibodies, that are used to quantify protein levels. We thus assessed if the cis-pQTLs for the MR-

248

prioritized proteins were PAVs, or in LD (R2>0.8) with PAVs, and if so, whether conditioning the cis-

249

pQTLs on correlated PAVs influenced their association with COVID-19 outcomes. rs2834167 (IL10RB) is

250

a nonsense variant and could therefore be subject to potential binding effects. rs505922 (ABO) is not in

251

LD with known missense variants. rs4767027 (OAS1) is an intronic variant, which is in LD with a

252

missense variant rs2660 (R2=1) in European ancestry. Unfortunately, this missense variant was not

253

included in the imputation data of Sun et al, and the effect by this missense variant could not be

254

evaluated. However, since RNA splicing and expression studies derived from RNA sequencing are not

255

subject to potential effects of missense variants that could influence aptamer binding, we next explored

256

whether rs4767027 also influences OAS1 splicing and/or expression.

257
258

sQTL and eQTL studies for OAS genes

259

Splicing QTLs (sQTLs) are genetic variants that influence the transcription of different isoforms of a

260

protein. The aptamer that targets OAS1 was developed against a synthetic protein comprising the amino

261

acid sequence 1-364 of NP002525.225, which is common to the two major OAS1 isoforms, p46 and p42,

262

and hence the aptamer may identify both, or either isoforms. rs10774671 is a known sQTL for OAS1 that

263

induces alternate splicing and create p46 and p42, a majority of present-day people carry this splice

264

variant (rs10774671-A), which increases expression of isoforms other than p4626. The ancestral variant

265

(rs10774671-G) is the major allele in African populations and became fixed in Neanderthal and

266

Denisovan genomes27,28. However, the ancestral variant, with its increased expression of the p46 isoform,

267

was reintroduced into the European population via gene flow from Neanderthals29, and is also the

268

predominant isoform found in circulating blood26. The p46 isoform has been demonstrated to have higher

269

anti-viral activity than other isoforms30. Interestingly, the OAS1 pQTL, rs4767027, is in high LD (R2=0.97)

270

with rs1077467129 in European populations. Functional studies support that the G allele at rs10774671

271

increases expression of the p46 isoform but decreases expression of the p42 isoform26. This G allele at

272

the sQTL rs10774671 reflects the T allele at pQTL rs4767027, which itself is associated with higher

273

measured OAS1 levels and reduced odds of COVID-19 severity and susceptibility. These separate lines

274

of evidence suggest that the p46 isoform was predominantly measured by the SomaScan® platform and

275

may protect against COVID-19 outcomes.

276
277

Undertaking MR studies of OAS1 splicing, we found that increased expression of the p46 isoform (as

278

defined by normalized read counts of the intron cluster defined by LeafCutter31,32) was associated with

279

reduced odds of COVID-19 outcomes (OR = 0.29; 95% CI: 0.17-0.49, P=4.1x10-6 for susceptibility, OR =

280

0.09; 95% CI: 0.04-0.21, P=2.0x10-8 for hospitalization and OR = 0.05; 95% CI: 0.02-0.13, P=3.1x10-9 for

281

very severe COVID-19) (Figure 2B). Colocalization analyses also supported a shared causal signal

282

between the sQTL for OAS1, the pQTL and COVID-19 outcomes (Figure S2A-B). Interestingly, the

283

colocalization analyses supported a stronger probability of a shared signal with the sQTL, than the pQTL,

284

suggesting that the p46 isoform may be the driver of the association of OAS1 levels with COVID-19

285

outcomes.

286
287

Next, we tested whether increased expression of OAS1 levels, without respect to isoform, were

288

associated with COVID-19 outcomes using eQTL MR analyses. We identified an expression QTL (eQTL)

289

for total OAS1, rs10744785, from GTEx v8.33 Total OAS1 expression levels were not associated with

290

COVID-19 susceptibility and hospitalization (Figure 2B). We also found that increased OAS3 expression

291

level in whole blood was positively associated with COVID-19 outcomes in MR analyses with a support

292

for colocalization of their genetic signal (Table S9, Figure S3).

293
294

Taken together, these pQTL, sQTL and eQTL studies suggest that increased levels of the p46 isoform of

295

OAS1 protect against COVID-19 adverse outcomes. Further, the concordant evidence from sQTL and

296

pQTL MR studies suggest that the effect of OAS1 levels on COVID-19 outcomes is unlikely to be biased

297

by aptamer binding effects.

298
299

Association of measured OAS1 protein level with COVID-19 outcomes

300

Since MR studies were derived from protein levels measured in a non-infected state, we tested the

301

hypothesis that increased OAS1 protein levels in a non-infected state would be associated with reduced

302

odds of COVID-19 outcomes. To do so, we undertook a case-control study, measuring OAS1 protein

303

levels using the SomaScan® platform in 1039 longitudinal samples from 399 SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive

304

patients collected at multiple time points during their COVID-19 infection and 105 individuals who

305

presented with COVID-19 symptoms but had negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR nasal swabs from the

306

Biobanque Quebecoise de la COVID-19 cohort (www.BQC19.ca). Individuals were recruited

307

prospectively who had undergone nasal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The demographic

308

characteristics of the participants in the BQC19 cohort who underwent SomaScan® assays is detailed in

309

Table 2.

310
311

We defined non-infectious samples as those collected from convalescent SARS-CoV-2 patients at least

312

31 days after onset of their symptoms (N=115), or samples collected from SARS-CoV-2 PCR negative

313

patients (N=105). These SARS-CoV-2 PCR negative patients were recruited as controls into the study, as

314

their inclusion reduces the probability of the introduction of collider bias 34. As we also observed a change

315

in OAS1 level with the exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus (Figure S4), in order to understand how OAS1

316

protein levels during infection would be associated with COVID-19 outcomes, we also measured OAS1

317

levels in individuals with samples from SARS-CoV-2 positive patients <14 days after symptom onset

318

(N=313). Sample outliers were removed (Figure S5, S6), and we showed that OAS1 levels are not

319

associated with age and sex in samples without active infection (Figure S7). Additional sample QC and

320

characterization of the cohort is described in Supplementary data.

321
322

To test whether OAS1 levels in a non-infectious state were associated with COVID-19 outcomes we

323

undertook logistic regression using the three COVID-19 outcomes, while controlling for age, sex, age2,

324

plate, recruitment center and sample processing time. OAS1 levels were log-transformed and

325

standardized to match the transformation procedure of the MR study. We found that in the non-infectious

326

samples, each standard deviation increase in OAS1 levels on the log-transformed scale was associated

327

with reduced odds of COVID-19 outcomes (OR = 0.20 [95% CI: 0.08 – 0.53]; P = 0.001 for very severe

328

COVID-19, OR = 0.46 [95% CI: 0.28 – 0.76], P = 0.002 for hospitalization and OR = 0.69 [95% CI: 0.49 –

329

0.98], P = 0.04 for susceptibility) (Figure 4, Table S10, Figure S8). These results are consistent with our

330

findings from MR, where increased circulating OAS1 levels in a non-infectious state were associated with

331

protection against all of these adverse COVID-19 outcomes.

332
333

In samples drawn during active infection we found that increased OAS1 levels were associated with

334

increased odds of adverse COVID-19 outcomes (OR = 1.49 [95% CI: 1.19 – 1.90]; P = 0.0007 for very

335

severe COVID-19, OR = 1.92 [95% CI: 1.46 – 2.56], P = 4.8 x 10-6 for hospitalization and OR = 4.39 [95%

336

CI: 2.87 – 6.73], P = 1.09 x 10-11 for susceptibility) (Figure 4, Table S10, Figure S8).

337
338

Taken together, these findings suggest that increased OAS1 levels in a non-infectious state are

339

associated with better COVID-19 outcomes, and that during infection, SARS-CoV-2 exposure likely

340

causes OAS1 levels to increase, as interferon pathways are stimulated, which are known to increase

341

OAS1 levels35.

342
343

Discussion:

344

Disease-specific therapies are needed to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19

345

outcomes. In this large-scale two-sample MR study of 931 proteins assessed for three COVID-19

346

outcomes in up to 14,134 cases and 1.2 million controls with European ancestry, we provide evidence

347

that increased OAS1 levels in the non-infectious state are strongly associated with reduced risks of very

348

severe COVID-19, hospitalization and susceptibility. The protective effect size was particularly large, such

349

that a 50% decrease in the odds of very severe COVID-19 was observed per standard deviation increase

350

in OAS1 circulating levels. Since therapies exist that activate OAS1, repositioning them as potential

351

COVID-19 treatments should be prioritized.

352
353

In non-Sub-Saharan African populations, the protective alleles at both rs4767027-T (the OAS1 pQTL) and

354

rs10774671-G (the OAS1 sQTL) are found on a Neandertal haplotype which was passed on to modern

355

humans ~50-60,000 years ago36. Even though these two SNPs share a haplotype, their evolutionary

356

histories differ. The rs4767027-T allele is derived from the Neandertal lineage, whereas for the

357

rs10774671-G allele, Neanderthals preserved the ancestral state. OAS1 alternative splicing regulated by

358

the rs10774671-G allele increases the isoform p46, which is known to have a higher enzymatic activity

359

against viruses than the p42 isoform37. p46 is also known to be the only OAS1 isoform which is robustly

360

upregulated during infection29. Although further studies are needed to fully elucidate the functional

361

relevance of the pQTL and sQTL for OAS1, the antiviral activity of the gene products is higher for the

362

Neandertal haplotype than the common haplotype in Europeans 30. In Europeans the Neandertal

363

haplotype has undergone positive selection29 and the rs4767027-T allele reaches an allele frequency of

364

0.32, whereas it is absent in sub-Saharan African populations. The association between the Neanderthal

365

haplotype and protection against severe COVID-19 was recently described38. Using MR and

366

measurements of circulating proteins, we demonstrated here that increased OAS1 levels of the

367

Neandertal haplotype confers this protective effect.

368
369

Our MR evidence indicated that higher p46 isoform levels of OAS1 and higher OAS1 total protein levels,

370

as measured by the SomaScan® assay had protective effects on COVID-19 outcomes. These results

371

were strongly supported by colocalization analysis. Given the consistent colocalization between the sQTL

372

and pQTL for OAS1, the lack of colocalization between the eQTL and pQTL for OAS1, and the evidence

373

that the SomaScan® assay likely measures p46 isoforms, rather than total protein levels, it seems

374

probable that the protective effect of OAS1 is derived from the p46 isoform. However, further

375

investigations are required to specifically measure each isoform in circulation.

376
377

In light of the protective effect of the ancestral OAS1 splice variant (rs10774671-G) on COVID-19 and the

378

positive selection of the Neandertal haplotype in Europeans, the loss-of-function variant (rs10774671-A)

379

found in non-African population is surprising. Several scenarios might explain this loss-of-function, e.g.,

380

loss of purifying selection during the out-Africa exodus due to changes in environmental pathogens.

381

Moreover, immune responses can be harmful and loss-of-function in OAS1-antiviral activity has been

382

observed in several primates39, suggesting a cost of OAS1 activity. Nevertheless, our results indicate that

383

interbreeding between Neanderthals and modern humans confers some protection against COVID-19.

384

The OAS1 Neanderthal variant is another risk-modulating locus reported to be inherited from

385

Neanderthals, the other being the chromosome 3 risk locus40.

386
387

OAS1, OAS2 and OAS3 share significant homology and differ only in their number of OAS units. They

388

also increase expression of both IRF3 and IRF7, both genes involved in interferon-induced gene

389

expression. As an interferon stimulated gene41, OAS1 polymorphisms have been associated with the host

390

immune response to several classes of viral infection including influenza 42, herpes simplex43, hepatitis C ,

391

West Nile44 Dengue45, and SARS-CoV46 viruses. Given that OAS1 is an intracellular enzyme leading to

392

viral RNA degradation, it is probable that the circulating levels of this enzyme reflect intracellular levels of

393

this protein. However, there exists considerable evidence that circulating OAS1 is also important in the

394

viral immune response47.

395
396

Molecules currently exist which can increase OAS1 activity. Interferon beta-1b, which activates a cytokine

397

cascade leading to increased OAS1 expression,48 is currently used to treat multiple sclerosis and has

398

been shown to induce OAS1 expression in blood.49 Interferon-based therapy has also been used in other

399

viral infections50. However, recent randomized trials have shown inconsistent results. While intravenous

400

interferon beta-1b combined with lopinavir-ritonavir reduced mortality due to MERS-CoV infections,51 in

401

the unblinded SOLIDARITY trial,52 there was no demonstrated benefit of intravenous interferon-beta-1b.

402

On the other hand, a recent phase II trial testing the effect of inhaled nebulized interferon beta-1b showed

403

improved symptoms in the treatment arm.53 While this study was not powered to show a difference in

404

mortality, all deaths occurred in the placebo group. Inhaled nebulized interferon-1-beta results in a much

405

higher tissue availability in the lung and may result in improved anti-viral activity. Moreover, timing of

406

administration is likely to play a role, as the administration of a pro-inflammatory cytokine may not provide

407

benefit during the inflammation driven phase of the disease. However, data on timing of administration is

408

currently unavailable in the SOLIDARITY trial, and conclusions cannot yet be drawn. Lastly the effect of

409

interferon supplement may vary across ancestral population, as different ancestries have different

410

amounts of the more active p46 isoform of OAS1. Our study was limited to individuals of European

15

411

ancestry, a population with higher expression of the p46 isoform. Interestingly, the SOLIDARITY trial

412

enrolled 61% of its patients in Africa or Asia, and 17% in Latin America, populations with higher

413

expression of the p42 isoform OAS1, while the study on inhaled interferon beta-1b was comprised of 80%

414

White patients from the United Kingdom. This suggests that interferon beta-1b may have different effects

415

in populations of different ancestry, due to presence of different genetic variants.

416
417

In-vitro evidence also exists demonstrating that pharmacological inhibition of phosphodiesterase-12,

418

which normally degrades the OAS enzymes, potentiates this OAS-mediated antiviral activity.54 PDE-12

419

inhibitors potentiate the action of OAS1, 2 and 3.55 Interestingly other coronaviruses in the same

420

betacoronavirus family as SARS-CoV-2 have been shown to produce viral proteins that degrade the OAS

421

family of proteins, and antagonize RNase-L activity, leading to evasion of the host immune response.56,57

422

Thus classes of medications currently exist that lead to increased OAS1 levels and could be explored for

423

their effect upon COVID-19 outcomes.

424
425

Our MR analyses found that higher level of OAS3 expression is associated with worse COVID-19

426

outcomes, which is an opposite direction of effect compared to OAS1. The discordant effects of the

427

Neanderthal haplotype for OAS1 and OAS3 were also reported by a previous study 29 , which might reflect

428

complex biology of OAS genes for innate immune response. In a recent transcription-wide association

429

study from the GenOMICC program22, genetically-predicted high expression of OAS3 in lungs and whole

430

blood were associated with higher risk of becoming critically ill COVID-19 patients. Although further

431

studies to assess the roles of OAS genes specific to SARS-CoV-2 are needed, it is likely that OAS1 is the

432

main driver of the protective effect of Neanderthal haplotype for COVID-19 outcomes given prior

433

functional studies demonstrating the antiviral effect of OAS genes29.

434
435

IL10RB encodes for the beta subunit of the IL10 receptor (a type III interferon receptor), and is part of a

436

cluster of immunologically important genes including IFNAR1 and IFNAR2, both recently implicated in

437

severe COVID-19 pathophysiology.58 IFNAR1 and 2 encode the interferon alpha/beta receptor subunits 1

438

and 2, respectively. Interestingly, while there exists a cis-pQTL strongly associated with IFNAR1 levels, it

439

was not associated with any of the COVID-19 outcomes (P ~ 0.5). Further, IFNAR1 had no trans-pQTLs

440

identified, which means that the IL10RB cis-pQTL does not likely reflect IFNAR1 levels. However, since

441

IFNAR2 was not measured in any proteomic studies, we could not test the effect of its circulating levels

442

on COVID-19 outcomes. IL10RB mediates IL10 anti-inflammatory activity through its downstream

443

inhibitory effect on many well-known pro-inflammatory cytokines such as janus kinases and STAT1.59

444

While overexpression of IL10 has been involved in the persistence of multiple chronic bacterial infections

445

such as tuberculosis,60 its role remains poorly understood in acute infections. In sepsis, a disease state

446

characterized by high levels of cytokine activity and a rise in multiple biomarkers associated with

447

inflammation, there is also a well-established increase in anti-inflammatory IL10 production by leukocytes,

448

especially in the early stage of the disease.61 Most importantly, while in a normal physiological state, IL10

449

is usually only produced at a low level by neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages, its production is

450

strongly upregulated by IL4, itself upregulated by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) when they bind LBPs.62,63

451

Interestingly, while the LBP gene did not pass FDR correction, it was still one of the most significant

452

protein in our MR cis-pQTL analysis (Table S1, S3). While LPS’s are well-known for their role in triggering

453

gram-negative bacterial sepsis, their role in other acute infections and respiratory diseases is likely

454

broader, and involves complex sequences of cytokine signaling.64–67 Nevertheless, as our MR studies

455

showed that IL10RB protein level affected COVID-19 outcome with a concordant effect direction, and

456

given the known role of overt inflammation in COVID-19 morbidity, this pathway likely deserves more

457

investigation.

458
459

This study has limitations. First, we used MR to test the effect of circulating protein levels measured in a

460

non-infected state. This is because the effect of the cis-pQTLs upon circulating proteins was estimated in

461

individuals who had not been exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Once a person contracts SARS-CoV-2 infection,

462

levels of circulating proteins could be altered and this may be especially relevant for cytokines such as

463

IL10 (which binds to IL10RB), whose levels may reflect host response to the viral infection and OAS1,

17

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.13.20212092; this version posted December 24, 2020. The copyright holder for this

464

whose levels are increased by activation of interferon pathway, as we observed in our case-control study

465

(Figures S4, S6, S9). Thus, the MR results presented in this paper should be interpreted as an

466

estimation of the effect of circulating protein levels, when measured in the non-infected state. On-going

467

studies will help to clarify if the same cis-pQTLs influence circulating protein levels during infection.

468

Second, this type of study suffers a high false-negative rate. Our goal was not to identify every circulating

469

protein influencing COVID-19 outcomes, but rather to provide evidence for few proteins with strong cis-

470

pQTLs since these proteins are more likely to be robust to the assumptions of MR studies. Future large-

471

scale proteomic studies with more circulating proteins properly assayed should help to overcome these

472

limitations. Third, most MR studies assume a linear relationship between the exposure and the outcome.

473

Thus, our findings would not identify proteins whose effect upon COVID-19 outcomes has a clear

474

threshold effect. Finally, we could not completely exclude the possibility that measurement of OAS1 levels

475

may be influenced by protein altering variants, however, such variants do not affect sQTL RNA-

476

sequencing studies and the association between OAS1 levels and COVID-19 outcomes remained robust

477

in such analyses.

478
479

In conclusion, we have used genetic determinants of circulating protein levels and COVID-19 outcomes

480

obtained from large-scale studies and found compelling evidence that OAS1 has a protective effect on

481

COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. Measuring OAS1 levels in a case-control study demonstrated that

482

higher OAS1 levels in a non-infectious state were associated with reduced risk of COVID-19 outcomes.

483

Interestingly, the available evidence suggests that the protective effect from OAS1 is likely due to the

484

Neanderthal introgressed p46 OAS1 isoform. Known pharmacological agents that increase OAS1 levels

485

could be explored for their effect on COVID-19 outcomes.

Methods:

489
490

pQTL GWAS

491

We systematically identified pQTL associations from six large proteomic GWASs.15–20 Each of these

492

studies undertook proteomic profiling using either SomaLogic ® technology, or O-link proximal extension

493

assays.

494
495

COVID GWAS and COVID-19 Outcomes

496

To assess the association of cis-pQTLs with COVID-19 outcomes, we used the largest COVID-19 meta-

497

analytic GWAS to date from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative21. For our study, we used three of

498

these GWAS meta-analyses which included 25 cohorts of European ancestry and 1 cohort of admixed

499

American ancestry, based on sample size and clinical relevance. These outcomes were very severe

500

COVID-19, hospitalization due to COVID-19, and susceptibility to COVID-19 (named A2, B2, and C2,

501

respectively in the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative).

502
503

Very severe COVID-19 cases were defined as hospitalized individuals with COVID-19 as the primary

504

reason for hospital admission with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (nucleic acid amplification

505

tests or serology based), and death or respiratory support (invasive ventilation, continuous positive airway

506

pressure, Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure, or continuous external negative pressure, high-flow nasal or

507

face-mask oxygen). Simple supplementary oxygen (e.g. 2 liters/minute via nasal cannula) did not qualify

508

for case status. Controls were all individuals in the participating cohorts who did not meet this case

509

definition.

510
511

Hospitalized COVID-19 cases were defined as individuals hospitalized with laboratory confirmed SARS-

512

CoV-2 infection (using the same microbiology methods as for the very severe phenotype), where

infection, health record evidence of COVID-10 (international classification of disease coding or physician

518

confirmation), or with self-reported infections (e.g. by questionnaire). Controls were all individuals in the

519

participating cohorts who did not meet this case definition.

520
521

Two-sample Mendelian randomization

522

We used two-sample MR analyses to screen and test potential circulating proteins for their role

523

influencing COVID-19 outcomes. In two-sample MR, the effect of SNPs on the exposure and outcome are

524

taken from separate GWASs. This method often improves statistical power, because it allows for larger

525

sample sizes for the exposure and outcome GWAS. 68

526
527

Exposure definitions: We conducted MR using six large proteomic GWAS studies.15–20 Circulating

528

proteins from Sun et al, Emilsson et al and Pietzner et al were measured on the Somalogic platform,

529

Suhre et al, Yao et al and Folkersen et al used protein measurements on the O-link platform. We selected

530

proteins with only cis-pQTLs to test their effects on COVID-19 outcomes, because they are less likely to

531

be affected by potential horizontal pleiotropy. The cis-pQTLs were defined as the genome-wide significant

532

SNPs (P < 5 × 10−8) with the lowest P value within 1 Mb of the transcription start site (TSS) of the gene

533

encoding the measured protein.9 For proteins from Emilsson et al, Pietzner et al, Suhre et al, Yao et al

534

and Folkersen et al, we used the sentinel cis-pQTL per protein per study as this was the data available.

535

For proteins from Sun et al, we used PLINK and 1000 genome European population references (1KG

536

EUR) to clump and select LD-independent cis-pQTL (R2<0.001, distance 1000 kb) with the lowest P-

537

value from reported summary statistics for each SOMAmer ® bound proteins. We included the same

538

proteins represented by different cis-pQTLs from different studies in order to cross examine the findings.

539

For cis-pQTLs that were not present in the COVID-19 GWAS, SNPs with LD R2>0.8 and with minor allele

540

frequency (MAF) < 0.42 were selected as proxies, MAF > 0.3 was used for allelic alignment for proxy

541

SNPs. cis-pQTLs with palindromic effects and with minor allele frequency (MAF) > 0.42 were removed

542

prior to MR to prevent allele-mismatches. Benjamini & Hochberg correction was used to control for the

543

total number of proteins tested using MR. We recognize that this is an overly conservative correction,

544

given the non-independence of the circulating proteins, but such stringency should reduce false positive

545

associations. MR analyses were performed using the TwoSampleMR package in R.69 For proteins with a

546

single (sentinel) cis-pQTL, we used the Wald ratio to estimate the effect of each circulating protein on

547

each of the three COVID-19 outcomes. For any proteins/SOMAmer® reagents with multiple independent

548

cis-pQTL, an inverse variance weighted (IVW) method was used to meta-analyze their combined effects.

549

After harmonizing the cis-pQTLs of proteins with COVID-19 GWAS, a total of 566 SOMAmer® reagents

550

(529 proteins, 565 directly matched IVs and 26 proxies) from Sun et al, 760 proteins (747 directly

551

matched IVs and 11 proxies) from Emilsson et al, 91 proteins (90 directly matched IVs and 2 proxies)

552

from Pietzner et al, 74 proteins (72 directly matched IVs) from Suhre et al, 24 proteins (24 directly

553

matched IVs) from Yao et al and 13 proteins (13 directly matched IVs) from Folkersen et al were used as

554

instruments for the MR analyses across the three COVID-19 outcomes (Table S11-12).15–20

555
556

Pleiotropy assessments

557

A common pitfall of MR is horizontal pleiotropy, which occurs when the genetic variant affects the

558

outcome via pathways independent of circulating proteins. The use of circulating protein cis-pQTLs

559

greatly reduces the possibility of pleiotropy, for reasons described above. We also searched in the

560

PhenoScanner database, a large catalogue of observed SNP-outcome relationships involving > 5,000

561

GWAS done to date to assess potentially pleiotropic effects of the cis-pQTLs of MR prioritized proteins,

562

by testing the association of cis-pQTLs with other circulating proteins (i.e. if they were trans-pQTLs to

563

other proteins or traits). For cis-pQTLs of MR prioritized proteins, if they were measured on SomaLogic®

564

platform, we assessed the possibility of potential aptamer-binding effects (where the presence of protein

565

altering variants may affect protein measurements). We also checked if cis-pQTLs of MR prioritized

566

proteins had significantly heterogeneous associations across COVID-19 populations in each COVID-19

567

outcome GWAS.

568
569

Colocalization analysis

570

Finally, we tested colocalization of the genetic signal for the circulating protein and each of the three

571

COVID-19 outcomes using colocalization analyses, which assess potential confounding by LD.

572

Specifically, for each of these MR significant proteins with genome-wide summary data available, for the

573

proteomic GWASs, a stringent Bayesian analysis was implemented in coloc R package to analyze all

574

variants in 1MB genomic locus centered on the cis-pQTL. Colocalizations with posterior probability for

575

hypothesis 4 (PP4, that there is an association for both protein level and COVID-19 outcomes and they

576

are driven by the same causal variant) > 0.5 were considered likely to colocalize (which means the

577

highest posterior probability for all 5 coloc hypotheses), and PP4 > 0.8 was considered to be highly likely

578

to colocalize.

579

sQTL and eQTL MR and colocalization studies for OAS genes

581

We performed MR and colocalization analysis using GTEx project v833 GWAS summary data to

582

understand the effects of expression and alternative splicing of OAS genes in whole blood. The genetic

583

instruments were conditionally independent (R2 < 0.001) sQTL and eQTL SNPs for OAS1, eQTL for

584

OAS2 and OAS3 identified by using stepwise regression in GTEx33. The sQTL SNP for OAS1

585

(rs10774671), was originally identified for the normalized read counts of LeafCutter31 cluster of the last

586

intron of p46 isoform (chr12:112,917,700-112,919,389 GRCh38) in GTEx32, and was used to estimate the

587

effect of p46 isoform. Colocalization analysis was performed using GWAS summary from GTEx by

588

restricting the regions within 1 Mb of rs4767027.

591

BQC19 is a Québec-wide initiative to enable research into the causes and consequences of COVID-19

592

disease. For this analysis, we used results from patients with available proteomic data from SomaLogic®

593

assay (Supplementary Data). The patients were recruited at the Jewish General Hospital (JGH) and

594

Centre hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal (CHUM) in Montréal, Québec, Canada.

595
596

COVID-19 case – control status was defined to be consistent with the GWAS study from COVID-19 HGI,

597

from which the MR results were derived. Namely, we tested the association of OAS1 protein levels with

598

the three different COVID-19 outcome definitions both in samples procured from non-infected samples

599

and from samples during the acute phase of the infection. The three outcomes were: 1) Very severe

600

COVID-19—defined as hospitalized individuals with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (nucleic

601

acid amplification tests or serology based), and death or respiratory support (invasive ventilation,

602

continuous positive airway pressure, Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure, or continuous external negative

603

pressure, high flow nasal or face-mask oxygen). Controls were all individuals who did not meet this case

604

definition; 2) Hospitalized COVID-19 cases—defined as individuals hospitalized with laboratory confirmed

605

SARS-CoV-2 infection. Controls were all who did not meet this case definition; 3) Susceptibility to COVID-

606

19—cases were defined as individuals with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, and controls

607

were all individuals who underwent PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2, but were negative. The date of

608

symptom onset for COVID-19 patients was collected from patients’ charts or estimated from their first

609

positive COVID-19 tests if missing. Case inclusion criteria was not exclusive, which means that some

610

individuals who were cases in the susceptibility analyses were also included in the hospitalization and

611

very severe COVID-19 if they met case definitions.

612
613

Among SARS-CoV-2 positive participants, we defined samples procured from participants during the

614

infectious state as those sampled within 14 days (including the 14th day) from the first date of symptoms70.

615

For individuals with more than one sample within 14 days of symptom onset, the earliest sample was

616

used. We defined samples procured from patients who were non-infectious as samples from SARS-CoV-

617

2 positive patients taken at least 31 days after symptom onset or from SARS-CoV-2 negative individuals.

618

We selected 31 days, as this is the upper limit of the intra-quartile range of the duration of SARS-CoV-2

619

positivity in a recent systematic review and coincided with the first scheduled outpatient follow-up blood

620

test in the BQC1971. For individuals with more than one sample at least 31 days of symptom onset, the

621

latest sample was used. Protein levels in citrated (ACD) plasma samples were measured using the

622

SomaScan®️ assay [SomaLogic Inc.]. Details regarding SOMAmer QC are included in Supplementary

623

Data.

624
625

1039 samples from 399 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and 105 SARS-CoV-2 negative patients of mainly

626

European descent underwent SomaScan® assays, which included 5,284 SOMAmer reagents, targeting

627

4,742 proteins. A total of 125 individuals were recruited from CHUM and 279 individuals were recruited

628

from the JGH. Individuals had blood sampling done at up to five different time points (200 individuals had

629

one measurement, 113 individuals had two measurements, 152 individuals had three measurements, 38

630

individuals had four measurements and 1 individual had five measurements). Days from symptom onset

631

were calculated for each sample based on the date of symptom and blood draw date. Sample processing

632

time (in hours) for each sample was also calculated measure the duration of time from sample collection

633

to processing to account for the changes in the amount of protein released from cell lysis due to sample

634

handling time.

635
636

Sample QC was performed to remove outliers with long sample processing time and high OAS1 levels.

637

OAS1 level was measured by one SOMAmer reagent (OAS1.10361.25). Within each group, normalized

638

OAS1 levels were natural log transformed, adjusted for sample processing time and the residuals were

639

further standardized. Logistic regression was performed to test the association standardized OAS1 level

640

with the three COVID-19 outcomes including age, sex, age2, center of recruitment and plates as

641

covariates.
