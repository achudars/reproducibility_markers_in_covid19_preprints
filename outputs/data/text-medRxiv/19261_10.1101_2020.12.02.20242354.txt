KEY POINTS
Question: What is the prevalence of viral sepsis by Sepsis-3 definition among
hospitalized patients with COVID-19?
Findings: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we systematically reviewed
published literature for evidence of organ failure in COVID-19, to estimate the
prevalence of viral sepsis in this setting, by means of SOFA score calculation. The
prevalence of sepsis in COVID-19 was 39.9% (95% CI, 35.9-44.1; I2, 99%).
Meaning: This is the first study to address the burden of viral sepsis in hospitalized
patients with COVID-19, a highly heterogenous infection ranging from asymptomatic
cases to severe disease leading to death, as reflected in the high heterogeneity of
this study.

ABSTRACT
Importance COVID-19 is a heterogenous disease most frequently causing
respiratory tract infection but in its severe forms, respiratory failure and multiple
organ dysfunction syndrome may occur, resembling sepsis. The prevalence of viral
sepsis among COVID-19 patients is still unclear.
Objective We aimed to describe this in a systematic review.
Data sources MEDLINE(PubMed), Cochrane and Google Scholar databases were
searched for studies reporting on patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19,
diagnosed with sepsis or infection-related organ dysfunctions or receiving organ
replacement therapy.
Study selection Eligible were full-text English articles of randomized and nonrandomized clinical trials and observational studies reporting on patients with
confirmed COVID-19, who are diagnosed with sepsis or have infection-related organ
dysfunctions. Systematic reviews, editorials, conference abstracts, animal studies,
case reports, articles neither in English nor full-text, and studies with fewer than 30
participants were excluded.
Data extraction and synthesis All eligible studies were included in a narrative
synthesis of results and after reviewing all included studies a meta-analysis was
conducted. Separate sensitivity analyses were conducted per adult vs pediatric
populations and per Intensive Care Unit (ICU) vs non-ICU populations.
Main outcomes and measures
Primary endpoint was the prevalence of sepsis using Sepsis-3 criteria among
patients with COVID-19 and among secondary, new onset of infection-related organ
dysfunction. Outcomes were expressed as proportions with respective 95%
confidence interval (CI).

Results Of 1,903 articles, 104 were analyzed. The prevalence of sepsis in COVID-19
was 39.9% (95% CI, 35.9-44.1; I2, 99%). In sensitivity analysis, sepsis was present in
25.1% (95% CI, 21.8-28.9; I2 99%) of adult patients hospitalized in non-IntensiveCare-Unit (ICU) wards (40 studies) and in 83.8 (95% CI, 78.1-88.2; I2,91%) of adult
patients hospitalized in the ICU (31 studies). Sepsis in children hospitalized with
COVID-19 was as high as 7.8% (95% CI, 0.4-64.9; I2, 97%). Acute Respiratory
Distress Syndrome was the most common organ dysfunction in adult patients in nonICU (27.6; 95% CI, 21.6-34.5; I2, 99%) and ICU (88.3%; 95% CI, 79.7-93.5; I2, 97%)
Conclusions and relevance Despite the high heterogeneity in reported results,
sepsis frequently complicates COVID-19 among hospitalized patients and is
significantly higher among those in the ICU.

INTRODUCTION
COVID-19, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
(SARS-CoV)-2, is recognized as a pandemic, affecting 230 countries with 54,771,888
confirmed cases and 1,324,249 deaths worldwide, as of 17 November 2020 (1).
Several patients are complicated by respiratory insufficiency and they are in need for
mechanical ventilation (2). First reports of patients in Wuhan described in addition of
lung disease the presence of other organ failures including acute kidney injury, liver
dysfunction, coagulopathy, confusion and shock; such an involvement resembles the
systemic counterparts of bacterial and viral sepsis (3-5). The current Sepsis-3
definitions define sepsis as a life-threatening organ dysfunction due to the
dysregulated host response to an infection. The same definitions introduce the
Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score as a measure of organ
dysfunction (6). According to World Health Organization (WHO), manifestations of
sepsis and septic shock can be also the fatal frequent pathway of infections with
highly transmissible pathogens of public health concern such as avian and swine
influenza viruses, as well as corona viruses (7). Severe respiratory failure of COVID19 is accompanied by complex immune dysregulation of the host (8). As a
consequence, all elements of the new Sepsis-3 definition may apply for COVID-19
i.e. life-threatening organ dysfunction, dysregulated host response, and viral infection
(9).
With this in mind, we systematically reviewed published evidence for COVID19 as a cause of viral sepsis using the SOFA score as a classification tool. In parallel
the prevalence of different organ dysfunctions, the need for ICU admission, the
association of sepsis presence with mortality and the presence of alterations of
inflammation and coagulation markers were analyzed.

METHODS
Search strategy and selection criteria
The literature search and review process were conducted according to the
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)
statement (10), based on a pre-specified protocol (PROSPERO database registration
number: CRD42020202018).
The search of the peer-reviewed medical literature was conducted across
MEDLINE (PubMed), Cochrane and Google Scholar databases using the following
terms: “COVID-19” or “SARS-CoV-2” and “sepsis”, “organ failure”, “organ
dysfunction”. Detailed search strategy is provided in Supplement. Inclusion criteria
comprised randomized and non-randomized clinical trials and observational studies
reporting on the proportion of patients diagnosed with confirmed COVID-19, who
were diagnosed with sepsis, had infection-related organ dysfunctions, or received
organ replacement therapy (dialysis, mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal
membrane oxygenation [ECMO], liver replacement therapy). Sepsis was defined i) as
sepsis according to Sepsis-3 definitions (i.e. any at least two-point SOFA score at
presentation or any at least two-point-increase of the baseline SOFA score during
hospitalization; ii) as severe sepsis according to Sepsis 1/2 criteria; or iii) by relevant
ICD codes (7,11,12). Only articles published as full text in English were included,
while systematic reviews, editorials, conference abstracts, animal studies, case
reports, articles not written in English or not providing full-text, and studies with fewer
than 30 participants were excluded.
The literature search was conducted on August 27, 2020 and repeated on
October 3, 2020 by two independent authors (E.Ky and E.Ka). The same reviewers
assessed all articles by title, abstract and complete text to find those meeting the

predefined eligibility criteria and extracted information as follows: first author name,
country of origin, publication year and month, study design, total number of patients
reported, criteria for enrollment in the study, number of patients presenting sepsis,
new onset organ dysfunction, organ support/replacement therapy, number of patients
requiring ICU treatment, ICU discharge, hospital discharge and 30-day mortality. Any
controversies were resolved by a third reviewer (E.J.G.B). All authors of the selected
articles were contacted to provide relevant data.
Each study was evaluated by both reviewers in terms of quality of the provided
data with the Methodological index for non-randomized studies (MINORS) (13). An
additional assessment of certainty in extraction of the primary endpoint was made,
rated by means of a four-star scale, from zero (one star) to high uncertainty (four
stars), in order to assess causes for potential heterogeneity. Articles providing the
exact number of patients fulfilling Sepsis-3 criteria (either in the original publication or
after contacting corresponding authors), were qualified as zero uncertainty; articles
reporting mean/ median SOFA score with respective standard deviation (SD)/
interquartile range (IQR) were qualified as low uncertainty, whereas articles allowing
extraction of SOFA score ≥ 2, based at least on one reported specific organ
dysfunction were characterized as intermediate and articles where only severity of
disease (e.g. need for mechanical ventilation, need for ICU, or presence of “critical
illness”) could be used as a proxy for sepsis were considered of high uncertainty. The
following assumptions were made: mechanical ventilation and non-invasive
mechanical ventilation were considered as a PaO2: FiO2 ratio< 300, and thus as
SOFA score of ≥2. Among articles allowing extraction of SOFA score ≥2 for different
organ dysfunctions, a conservative approach for calculating the primary outcome was
followed and only one organ was considered (the one with the maximum number of

affected patients within the cohort). Among articles reporting medians (interquartile
range), outcomes were calculated as the minimum n observed. In order to avoid
including patients with sepsis due to secondary bacterial infections, corresponding
authors of publications reporting “sepsis” among outcomes were contacted for
clarification.

Endpoints and outcome measures
The primary endpoint was the prevalence of sepsis among COVID-19
patients. The outcome measure was the proportion of patients with COVID-19 who
fulfill the criteria for sepsis with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Secondary outcomes
included: i) the prevalence of new onset infection-related organ dysfunction; ii) the
prevalence of organ support and/or replacement (invasive and non-invasive
mechanical ventilation, including high-flow nasal cannula, vasopressors, ECMO, liver
and renal replacement therapy); iii) the prevalence of ICU admission; iv) the mortality
of COVID-19 patients with and without sepsis; and iv) the presence of alterations of
inflammation and coagulation markers. The outcome measure for each secondary
outcome was the respective proportion of patients with COVID-19 and 95% CI.

Sensitivity analysis
Separate sensitivity analyses were planned per adult vs pediatric populations
and per ICU vs non-ICU populations. Also, sensitivity analysis was performed among
studies with low and zero vs high uncertainty regarding the primary outcome. An
additional sensitivity analysis was planned for studies reporting patients without
selection criteria (all-comers) vs those reporting on specific selected groups. Articles
reporting on mixed cohorts (both ICU and non-ICU or adult and pediatric) were

included in the primary analysis as a whole and in the sensitivity analyses with the
subgroup concerned in the denominator.

Statistical analysis
All eligible studies were included in a narrative synthesis and after reviewing
all included studies. Meta-analysis was performed using the R software v. 4.0.2 (14)
after installing the packages “meta” (15), “metaphor” (16) and “dmetar” (17). Some
results were validated in the Review Manager (RevMan, The Cochrane
Collaboration) Version 5.4. In all cases the random effects model was employed. For
each analysis, the corresponding forest plot was produced, while publication bias
was assessed with the Egger’s test via funnel plot asymmetry (18).

Role of the funding source
There was no funding source for this study.

RESULTS
The literature search yielded 1,903 articles; of these, after removal of
duplicates and of articles with irrelevant title, 238 were screened full-text by the
reviewers (E. Ky and E. Ka). After removal of articles fulfilling exclusion criteria, 104
articles including a total of 157,063 patients were finally analyzed (Figure 1). Data on
primary endpoint were provided in 92 studies including a total of 147,881 patients. Of
the 104 included studies, mainly observational retrospective, 42 were reporting
results from China (19-60), 19 from the U.S.A (61-79), 5 from the U.K (80-84), 24
across Europe, mainly Italy, Spain, France and the Netherlands (85-109), 10 from
other countries (110-119) and 3 were international (120-122). All studies reported

data on hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 and 35 of them included data for ICU
(20, 25, 33, 36, 37, 41, 44, 45, 48, 52, 53, 56, 58, 66, 72, 73, 81-84, 86-89, 95, 96,
98, 101, 103, 106, 107, 109, 111, 119). Eight studies were pediatric (59, 60, 78, 79,
83, 84, 118, 119). The majority of articles included patients without any selection
criteria (all-comers), whereas forty-five focused on specific subgroups, such as
critically ill, cancer or rheumatologic patients, patients on mechanical ventilation etc.
No studies were found that reported sepsis based on Sepsis-3 or Sepsis-1/2 criteria
per se in the original publication; zero uncertainty was only achieved when
corresponding authors contacted, provided the exact number of patients presenting
sepsis based on sepsis-3. Characteristics of the included studies are presented in
eTable 1 and quality assessment with MINORS of each in eTable 2.

Primary endpoint
The pooled estimate for the prevalence of sepsis among COVID-19 patients
was 39.9% (95% CI, 35.9-44.1; I2, 99%) as assessed from 92 studies reporting data
on the primary endpoint (eFigure 1). Due to the high heterogeneity observed, the
results of sensitivity analyses are presented in Figure 2. In sensitivity analysis
focusing on ICU versus non-ICU cohorts, among forty studies of a total of 112,796
patients, the pooled estimate for sepsis prevalence was 25.1% (95% CI, 21.8-28.9; I2
99%) in the general ward (Figure 2A). The respective estimate for adult patients in
the ICU was 83.8% (95% CI, 78.1-88.2; I2 91%) among 31 articles assessed
including 3,528 patients (p<0.0001) (Figure 2B). In sensitivity analysis among
pediatric cohorts, sepsis in children hospitalized outside the ICU was as high as 7.8%
(95% CI, 0.4-64.9; I2, 97%) among 3 studies assessed (Figure 2C), whereas only one
study provided data for ICU (all 78 children septic) (84). Respective funnel plots of

the above analyses are provided in eFigure 2. Sensitivity analyses including only
articles with zero uncertainty (4 studies outside the ICU and 3 in the ICU, eFigure 3)
and high uncertainty (13 studies outside the ICU and 3 in the ICU, eFigure 4)
provided similar pooled estimates of sepsis prevalence outside of the ICU, which
were 17.1% (95%CI, 6.4-38.4; I2, 97%) in zero uncertainty analysis and 21.9%
(95%CI, 16.9-27.9; I2 ,93%) in high uncertainty analysis. However, the pooled
estimate in the ICU was 95.7% (95%CI, 75.5-99.4; I2, 65%) and 34.7% (95%CI, 9.972.0, I2, 92%) in zero and high uncertainty analysis respectively (p<0.0001), reducing
the heterogeneity and yielding a significant difference between the two groups.

Secondary endpoints
We described the prevalence of different organ dysfunctions, of admission in
the ICU, and of organ support and/or replacement among the 104 studies included. A
synthesis of the estimates of prevalence of organ dysfunctions in adults is presented
in eTables 3 and 4; similar pediatric data are presented in eTable 5. Acute
Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) was the most common organ dysfunction
both in non-ICU and ICU patients. ARDS prevalence in non-ICU wards was 27.6%
(95% CI, 21.6-34.5; I2, 99%) whereas in ICU reached 88.3% (95% CI, 79.7-93.5; I2,
97%; p<0.0001). Shock was the second most common dysfunction in ICU patients,
followed by renal and liver dysfunction (Table 1, eFigure 5). Coagulopathy was the
second most common organ dysfunction among non-ICU patients. Prevalence of all
organ dysfunctions was much higher in ICU than non-ICU patients except for
coagulopathy and central nervous system dysfunction; the prevalence of these
dysfunctions interestingly remained similar.

Among adult patients hospitalized in the general ward, 16.9% (95% CI, 14.020.1; I2, 96%) required ICU admission (Figure 3). As expected, need for organ
replacement was more likely among ICU than non-ICU patients (Table 2). Pooled
estimates of patients in the ICU requiring mechanical ventilation (eFigure 6A), renal
replacement (eFigure 6B), and ECMO (eFigure 6C) were 57.3% (95% CI, 44.1-69.5;
I2, 97%), 14.1% (95% CI, 9.5-20.3; I2, 91%), and 6.7% (95% CI, 3.5-12.6; I2, 93%),
respectively.
Mortality could not be assessed separately for patients with and without
sepsis. Nevertheless, Yang X. et al, reported that median SOFA of survivors was 4
(interquartile range [IQR], 3-4) compared to 6 (IQR, 4-8) for non-survivors, showing
an indirect effect of sepsis severity on final outcome (20). Similar results were
reported by others (33, 73). Zou X et al, estimated the hazard ratio (HR) of SOFA
score for death 1.40 (95%CI, 1.28-1.54) (37).
Finally, selected literature was searched for the presence of alterations in
inflammation and coagulation markers. Reported markers are summarized in
eTables 6 and 7. Lymphopenia was reported in most studies, as well as elevation of
acute phase proteins such as ferritin and C-reactive protein (CRP). Ferritin was
frequently (7 of 14 studies) elevated with cocentrations higher than 1,000ng/mL,
whereas the elevation of CRP was more inconsistent. Procalcitonin remained low in
almost all cases, as expected in viral infections. The coagulation pathway was also in
many studies affected with elevation of fibrinogen and d-dimers, whereas
prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) interestingly
hardly ever deviated above the upper normal limit.

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we showed that sepsis, based on
Sepsis-3 criteria, is present in a considerable proportion of hospitalized patients with
COVID-19. Sepsis affects 25% of adult COVID-19 patients outside the ICU and up to
83.8% of those admitted in the ICU. In hospitalized children with COVID-19, sepsis is
as high as 7.8%. ARDS is the most common organ dysfunction both in ICU and nonICU patients.
Sepsis in COVID-19 is more frequently implied, rather than reported. Already in the
first published reports, COVID-19 was identified as a potential cause of multiple
organ failure leading to death. Chen et al, reported confusion in 9%, acute kidney
injury in 3%, shock in 4%, and liver dysfunction in about 50% of patients.
Interestingly, bacterial or fungal coinfection was present only in 1% and 4% of cases,
respectively, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 was the main cause of infection-related
organ dysfunction, although the incidence of opportunistic infections is likely to rise
after the widespread introduction of dexamethasone as treatment (4). Similar results
were reported by other studies (5). Viral sepsis has also been associated with
influenza A (ARDS present in 72.6% and shock in 32.7% of critically ill patients with
H1N1 and H3N2), but variably attributed to secondary bacterial infections, which is
not the case in SARS-CoV-2 (123,124).
Pediatric data were obviously sparse. Children are less affected by the virus,
estimated as 1-5% of total cases and if ill, they present with milder symptoms.
Although prevalence of sepsis was lower than in adults, it was still higher than
expected based on initial reports (125).
Key mechanisms that may have a role in the pathophysiology of multi-organ
injury secondary to infection with SARS-CoV-2 include direct viral toxicity, endothelial
cell damage and thrombo-inflammation, dysregulation of the immune response, and

dysregulation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) (126). Some of
these mechanisms may be unique to COVID-19 such as that multiple-organ injury
may occur at least in part due to direct viral tissue damage (127,128). The host
response with activation of the adaptive and innate immune system and the resulting
systemic release of cytokines and activation of the complement system, are common
features of both bacterial and viral sepsis (126,129,130).
Severe COVID-19 has been shown to display a similar cytokine profile in
terms of baseline levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-1RA, IL-6, IL-8, IL-18, and TNF-α, as
ARDS of other etiology and bacterial sepsis, although the absolute circulating
concentrations tend to be somewhat lower (131). The presence of macrophage
activation-like syndrome, an extreme phenotype of bacterial sepsis, characterized by
hyperferritinemia, coagulation disorders, liver dysfunction and high mortality, is also
present in severe COVID-19. (8,132,133). Meanwhile, it has been demonstrated that
the host response is characterized by a dysregulated activation of the innate immune
system coupled with tissue damage by neutrophils and monocytes driving the
interplay of inflammation and coagulation (129,130). Altogether, these observations
suggest that death from COVID-19 to significant degree is a consequence of
immune-mediated organ damage, rather than a result of the infection itself (3,8).
Following the paradigm of bacterial sepsis and since no specific antiviral
treatment is available for COVID-19, immune targeting therapies have been tested
through several clinical trials; corticosteroids, IL-1 and IL-6 blockade and inhibition of
factors of the complement system have been administered to patients with organ
dysfunctions with promising results (134-139). Similarities between sepsis and
COVID-19 have been early recognized by sepsis experts, issuing a written guide for
appropriate management of COVID-19 (140).

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to address in a systematic
way the presence of sepsis, according to Sepsis-3 criteria, among hospitalized
patients with COVID-19, and the first to provide pooled estimates of specific organ
dysfunctions. Of course, the conservative approach used in SOFA score extraction
(i.e. median or mean SOFA of included cohorts) may have resulted in an
underestimation of sepsis prevalence. Sensitivity analyses focusing on low
uncertainty data provided similar prevalence, reducing this potential bias. High
heterogeneity was observed in almost all results, which could not be eliminated by
sensitivity analyses. This can be explained by the heterogeneity in reporting and
definitions of organ dysfunctions in the various studies, a shift in criteria for
hospitalization since the beginning of the pandemic (e.g. mild cases tend to receive
home care). Above all, it is likely that COVID-19-associated sepsis, similar to
bacterial sepsis and ARDS, is a heterogenous disease and every effort should be
made to identify patients at high risk for those complications.
In conclusion, a considerable proportion of patients with COVID-19 present
viral sepsis. Lessons learned from bacterial sepsis may apply, in terms of early
recognition (by means of SOFA and/or qSOFA score) and potential benefit from
immune regulating strategies.
