Abstract:
We describe the detection of SARS-CoV-2 (VOC )B.1.1.7 lineage in Oklahoma, USA. Various
mutations in the S gene and ORF8 with similarity to the genome of B.1.1.7 lineage were detected
in 4 of the 6 genomes sequenced and reported here. The sequences have been made available in
GISAID. Presence of novel lineages indicate the need for frequent whole genome sequencing to
better understand pathogen dynamics in different geographical locations.
Keywords: SARS-CoV-2, B.1.1.7, Variant of Concern (VOC), mutations, Oklahoma (USA)

Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in December 2019, several lineages/variants of
SARS-CoV-2 have been identified based on whole genome sequencing. As of January 21, 2021
approximately 420,000 whole genome sequences have been deposited in the GISAID database
(https://www.gisaid.org/) (1,2). Recently a novel SARS-CoV-2 lineage (B 1.1.7.) was identified
in Kent and Greater London in the United Kingdom (3) and is reported to have enhanced
transmissibility. Infections by the B.1.1.7 lineage has since been reported from several other
countries including the United States (4). We report the identification of B.1.1.7 in Oklahoma,
USA.
COVID-19 was first reported in Oklahoma on March 6th 2020 (5). As of January 19th, 2021, a
total of 358,374 cases and 3,037 deaths have been registered in the state (6). Six clinical
samples, from different counties in the state, collected between January 1st and 8th, 2021, were
sequenced for this report. RNA was extracted using a commercial kit (MVP, ThermoFisher) and
viral presence was detected by real-time PCR using TaqPath COVID-19 kit (Thermofisher, MA,
USA) that targets the S gene, N gene and ORF 1ab. The S gene target of all the samples selected
for sequencing either failed to amplify or had Ct values that were higher when compared to N
gene and ORF1ab. Sequencing was performed using the MinION platform (Oxford Nanopore
Technologies, UK ) following the ARTIC protocol (7).
Sequenced genomes were assembled using canu (8). Reference assisted consensus assemblies
were generated using minimap2 (9) and nanopolish (10), SARS-CoV-2 reference genome
Wuhan-Hu-1 (GenBank ID: MN908947.3) was used for reference assembly. Individual genes
were annotated using VIGOR (11). Annotated genes and the whole genomes were aligned using
MUSCLE aligner in MEGA-X (12). The genome sequences were submitted to GISAID (1) and
their GISAID classification and PANGO lineages (13) are shown in table 1. Four of the six
samples sequenced carried SNPs similar to those described in the B.1.1.7 lineage (20I/501Y.V1
Variant of Concern (VOC) 202012/01) (4), including N501Y, 69/70 deletion, Y144 deletion,
A570D, P681H, T716I, S982A, D1118H mutations. Q27Stop mutation in ORF 8 was detected in
3 out of these 4 samples. N501Y and the previously described D614G mutations (14,15) were
detected in all 6 samples (Table 2).
Frequent whole genome sequencing is critical to monitor mutations in the viral genome. The
evolution of highly transmissible strains of SARS-CoV-2 and its global spread underlines the
need to remain vigilant and continue practicing necessary social measures to prevent further
disease spread.
