Abstract
In the situation where expansion of coronavirus infectious disease-2019 (COVID-19) does not stop,
there is concern about co-infection of people with the seasonal influenza infections from late autumn
to winter 2020. Therefore, the importance of supplying vaccines against the seasonal influenza has
been pointed out all over the world. As an example in Japan, the number of people infected with the
seasonal influenza, hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD), epidemic keratoconjunctivitis, and
pharyngoconjunctival fever (PCF), which are the seasonal infectious diseases in the 2020 season, has
decreased remarkably compared to the number of people infected each year. It is believed that the
significant reduction in the number of people infected with these seasonal infectious diseases is a
result of the pervasive hand washing, wearing masks and maintaining social distance in COVID-19
rea. To examine the correlation between the three factors of the number of people with each seasonal
infectious disease, the mask wearing rate, and the outing rate, we created a three-dimensional scatter
plot based on these three factors using principal component analysis. Our research findings
demonstrated preventive effect of no going out against co-infection with the seasonal influenza and
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Introduction
Now that the expansion of coronavirus infectious disease-2019 (COVID-19) is not over, people
around the world are afraid of coinfection with the seasonal influenza virus and severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is expected to be found winter in 2020.
Since the spread of COVID-19, in Japan, measures to prevent the transmission of the virus such as
the use of masks and hand washing, ensuring social distance, refraining from going out and canceling
large events are widely promoted.1,2 In the case of Tokyo, the number of seasonal infectious diseases
such as influenza during the current term (2019–2020) is reported to be significantly lower than in
the average year (2015–2018).3 We examined whether wearing a mask or refraining from going out
had a great influence on the incidence of seasonal infectious diseases by a statistical method using
the principal component analysis (PCA) load based on a three-dimensional scatter plot. We
demonstrated preventive effect of no going out against co-infection with the seasonal influenza and
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) compared to wearing a mask.
Method
In approximately 5000 sentinel centers including hospitals and clinics, the number of persons with
the seasonal infectious diseases (seasonal influenza, hand-foot-and-mouth disease, epidemic
keratoconjunctivitis) and those infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Tokyo was calculated by the National
Institute of Infectious Diseases and Tokyo Metropolitan Infectious Diseases Surveillance Center.3,4
The number of people with various seasonal infectious diseases was informed in weekly reports
(Week 1–53 of the same year) (Supplementary data).3
The mask wearing rate in Tokyo from March–August 2020 was calculated by YouGov international
COVID-19 tracker Nippon Research Center Ltd (Tokyo, Japan). The outing rate in Tokyo from

March–August 2020 was calculated by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism
and 2020 Agoop Corp. (Tokyo, Japan).3 To examine the correlation between the three factors of the
number of people with each seasonal infectious disease, the mask wearing rate, and the outing rate,
we created a three-dimensional scatter plot based on these three factors using Minner3D EnterpriseMiner3D1.m3d (XLSTAT by Addinsoft, Mindware Inc., Okayama, Japan).
We calculated the PCA vector from the three-dimensional scatter plot and calculated the PCA load
for the number of affected individuals of each seasonal infectious disease, mask wearing rate, and
outing rate.
Result
In the case of Tokyo, the numbers of people infected with the influenza virus, with hand-foot-andmouth disease, and epidemic keratoconjunctivitis in the current term (2019–2020) were significantly
lower than in the average year (2015–2018) (Figure 1). Therefore, we calculated the amount of PCA
load for the number of people affected by each seasonal infectious disease, the mask wearing rate,
and the outing rate, and examined the effect on the PCA vector.
three-dimensional scatter plot were created based on these three factors (the numbers of people
infected with the seasonal viruses, mask wearing rate, and outing rate) using Minner3D EnterpriseMiner3D1.m3d. From the results of this study, it was clarified that a decrease in mask wearing rate
(load −0.566) and an increase in outing rate (load 0.713) influenced the increase in the number of
people infected with the seasonal influenza virus (Figure 2A). Particularly, the increase in the outing
rate has a strong influence on the increase in the number of people infected with the seasonal influenza
virus (Figure 2A). An increase in the outing rate (load 0.591) affected the increase in the number of
people with hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) (Figure 2B). It was clarified that the mask wearing
rate (load 0.104) did not affect the increase in the number of people with HFMD (Figure 2B). The
results of this study further revealed that a decrease in the mask wearing rate (load −0.443) and an
increase in the outing rate (loading 0.713) influenced the increase in the number of people with
epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (Figure 2C). The increase in the outing rate has a strong influence on
the increase in the number of people with the epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (Figure 2C). The results
of this study further revealed that a decrease in the mask wearing rate (load −0.526) and an increase
in the outing rate (loading 0.690) influenced the increase in the number of people with
pharyngoconjunctival fever (PCF) (Figure 2D). The increase in the outing rate has an influence on
the increase in the number of people with the PCF (Figure 2D).
The number obtained by subtracting the number of seasonal influenza-infected persons in 2019-2020
year from the number of seasonal influenza-infected persons in 2018-2019 year is the effect of
suppressing the seasonal influenza infection by social activities such as wearing mice or refraining
from going out (Figure 3A). The results of this study further revealed that a decrease in the mask
wearing rate (load 0.501) and an increase in the outing rate (loading 0.850) influenced the increase in

the number of people with the seasonal influenza virus (Figure 3B). The increase in going out rate
has a strong influence on the increase in the number of people with the seasonal influenza virus
(Figure 3B).
In the COVID-19 era, during the period of the state of emergency (April 7, 2020 to May 25, 2020),
the number of people going out decreased to about 25.64% compared to the period before the spread
of COVID-19 infection (February 2020) in Tokyo (Figure 4). Currently, even in late September 2020,
the number of people going out in Tokyo has decreased to about 58.9% compared to the period before
the spread of COVID-19 infection (February 2020) in Tokyo (Figure 4). Even during the seasonal
influenza epidemic (November 2020 to March 2021), if the number of people going out is reduced to
about 60%, the number of people infected with seasonal influenza virus may decrease to about 36%
compared to the average year.
Discussion
In the COVID-19 era, people around the world are afraid of coinfection with the seasonal influenza
virus and SARS-CoV-2, which is expected to be found winter in 2020. From the results of this analysis,
it was predicted that refraining from going out might work strongly as a preventive effect against the
seasonal influenza infection. Vaccination, such as the influenza vaccine, is the most important medical
strategy to prevent infected individuals from becoming seriously ill due to viral infections.5 The
results of this study revealed that protective behaviors and social consensus against viral infections
are likely to influence the decrease in the number of patients with seasonal infectious disease.
