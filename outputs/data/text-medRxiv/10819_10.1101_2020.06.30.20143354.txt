Abstract
The outbreak of COVID-19 has significant impact on health care systems. The workflow in
renal care facilities and dialysis facilities is complex. The aim of his study was to explore
multinational renal physician perspective about the disruption of outflow of renal service
amid COVID-19 pandemic.
Methods: we distributed a questionnaire electronically to renal physicians of various grades
from 5 countries. The questionnaire was formulated of 9 questions with domains centered on
the acute and chronic renal services
Results
97 physicians took part in the survey from 5 countries. 58% of the participating renal
physicians agreed that there has been disruption to the acute service offered to renal patients.
38% of the physicians who took the survey report disruption to the hemodialysis facilities.
Conclusion
At this challenging time of the pandemic, it is important to perform audits and quality control
to explore the deficiencies of acute and chronic renal care pathways.

Introduction
Since the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, the healthcare systems
around the world have seen one of the biggest challenges. Drastic measures have been taken
by the health authorities to fight and mitigate the pandemic. The challenges to both acute and

chronic renal care services are paramount (1). We aimed to reach out to renal physicians of
variable grades to explore their experience about the outflow of both acute and chronic renal
care pathways.
Methods
We developed a survey and distributed it to health-care professionals in 5 countries around
the world (Egypt, Italy, Turkey, Spain and India). The survey consisted of 9 questions with
two main domains. Some questions were addressing the adequacy and timely application of
acute renal care to patients amid the COVID- 19 pandemic; the other questions were about
dialysis unitsâ€™ preparedness. Renal physicians were invited to take part through email. The
questions are shown in table (1)

Results
97 physicians took part in the survey from 5 countries. The countries represented in this
survey are Egypt, Italy, Turkey, Spain and India. 75% of the participants work in tertiary care
facilities, the remaining 25 % work in secondary care facilities.23% of the participants was
consultants; 65% were trainee and 12% were managers of renal service.

Responses
Disruption of the acute renal care
58% of the participating renal physicians agreed that there has been disruption to the acute
service offered to renal patients. Suspected cases of SARS-CoV2 virus experienced a varied
degree of delay in initiating acute care pathways.

experiencing temporary disruption of acute hemodialysis units since the outbreak. The
disruption of acute hemodialysis was attributed to shortage of medical staff due to sick leaves
or due to the presence of suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19. 25% of physicians
agree that it has been challenging to establish appropriate and timely diagnosis of renal
diseases, in the acute settings, due to conflict between acute renal care pathway and COVID19 pathway.
Disruption to the chronic hemodialysis service
38% of the physicians who took the survey report disruption to the hemodialysis facilities.
The disruption was caused by a number of factors. Accommodation of incipient dialysis
patients, staff absenteeism on sick leaves or the diagnosis of new cases of COVID-19. 43%
agreed that appropriate isolation measures were adhered to.
Admission policies
Admission policies to acute healthcare facilities were variable and in some occasions
interfered with timely management of patients who needed acute or chronic renal care and,
were suspected of having COVID-19. The delay was due to the requirement of obtaining two
negative SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests for patients with criteria suspicious of COVID-19
Discussion:
In our survey, we explored the experience of renal physicians from 5 different countries. The
core of survey was the effect of COVID-19 on the provision of acute and chronic renal
service. 58% of the participants agreed that there has been disruption of the acute renal
pathway. There have been different guidelines addressing diffent domains of renal care amid
COVID-19. Previous reports have highlighted the importance of optimizing resources at the
time of increased demand (1). Admission policies of suspected or confirmed cases of

COVID-19 were different form one country to another, as reported by renal physicians in this
survey. In Wuhan suspected cases, among hemodialysis patients, were required to have 2
negative nucleic acid tests before being admitted to the dialysis facilities (2).

Conclusion: Renal physicians from 5 countries report temporary disruption of the acute and
chronic hemodialysis facilities. At this challenging time of the pandemic, it is important to
perform audits and quality control to explore the deficiencies of acute and chronic renal care
pathways.
