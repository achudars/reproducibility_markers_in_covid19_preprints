Abstract

35

COVID-19's high virus transmission rates have caused a pandemic that is exacerbated by the high

36

rates of asymptomatic and presymptomatic infections. These factors suggest that face masks and

37

social distance could be paramount in containing the pandemic. We examined the efficacy of each

38

measure and the combination of both measures using an agent-based model within a closed space

39

that approximated real-life interactions. By explicitly considering different fractions of asymptomatic

40

individuals, as well as a realistic hypothesis of face masks protection during inhaling and exhaling,

41

our simulations demonstrate that a synergistic use of face masks and social distancing is the most

42

effective intervention to curb the infection spread. To control the pandemic, we show that practicing

43

social distance is less efficacious than the widespread usage of face masks and that wearing face

44

masks provides optimal protection even if only a small portion of the population comply with social

45

distance. Finally, the face mask effectiveness in curbing the viral spread is not reduced if a large

46

fraction of population is asymptomatic. Our findings have important implications for policies that

47

dictate the reopening of social gatherings.

Author summary:

59

The COVID-19 outbreak has created an enormous burden on the worldwide population. Among

60

the various ways of preventing the spread of the virus, face masks have been proposed as a main

61

way of reducing transmission. Yet, the interplay between the usage of face mask and other forms

62

of Non-Pharmaceutical Intervention is still not completely clear. In this paper we introduce a

63

stochastic individual-based model which aims at producing realistic scenarios of disease spread

64

when mask wearing with different inward and outward efficacy and social distancing are enforced.

65

The model elucidates the conditions that makes the two forms of intervention synergistic in

66

preventing the spread of the disease.

Introduction

69

The COVID-19 outbreak has caused high levels of mortality and economic damage around the

70

world. The causative agent of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, is an airborne pathogen that can be

71

transmitted between humans through droplets and aerosols that can travel 1–8 meters1. The virus

72

is transmitted by both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. COVID-19 can cause severe

73

symptoms that require hospitalization in 1-5% of cases, as well as severe long-term sequels and

74

death. Accordingly, the outbreak has seriously impacted healthcare systems around the world2.

75

One of the major difficulties to contain the COVID-19 pandemic has been detection of infected

76

asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic individuals, who are estimated to be responsible for as much as

77

95% of all transmissions3 4. As these individuals carry and spread the virus without manifesting any

78

sign of the disease, they represent a crucial variable in managing the outbreak.

79

In the absence of an effective vaccine or antiviral, most countries have implemented non-

80

pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to curb the spread of COVID-195. These include closure of

81

schools, workplaces, churches, offices, factories and other social venues, while encouraging

82

preventative measures ranging from maintaining social distancing (SD, usually 2 m/6 ft between

83

individuals) to total quarantine and societal lockdowns. These measures aim to reduce the effective

84

contact rate of the population, which in turn decreases the disease reproductive number Re. These

85

NPIs limit the epidemic, but they present important drawbacks. Total lockdown can only be

86

implemented for short periods, due to its severe impact on the social fabric and economy of a

87

country. Meanwhile, essential workers remain vulnerable to infection and transmission due to the

88

frequent encounters with infected, often asymptomatic, individuals. Because of their social and

89

economic impact, lockdowns and SD measures have been lifted in some countries, leading to

90

reactivation of virus spread and ensuing increased morbidity and mortality.

91

Face masks covering the nose and mouth area also provide a level of filtration that blocks

92

virus transmission to a certain extent6-8. Masks prevent the spread of droplets and aerosols

93

generated by an infected individual1, where correctly worn surgical masks can reduce viral

94

transmission by 95%. Uninfected individuals wearing a surgical mask are about 85% protected

95

against infection9. Masks may be more effective than restrictions in people’s interactions for

96

controlling the spread of infectious virus because they prevent the larger expelled droplets from

97

being converted into smaller droplets that can travel farther, rather than removing the interactions

98

between individuals that cause droplets . Accordingly, face masks reduce the spread of influenza10

99

and coronaviruses11,12.

100

In the past, several papers have used theoretical models to study how efficacious mask

101

wearing is in avoiding the spread of airborne viruses. In 2010 at least two studies were focused on

102

the effect of face mask usage to contrast the diffusion of Novel Influenza A (H1N1)13,14. Although

103

these works are not on COVID-19 or another Coronavirus disease, they underline the necessity of

104

developing more accurate models to describe similar diseases and reinforce their results in the

105

light of new diseases. Specifically on COVID-19, the efficacy of mask wearing has recently been

106

studied using an ordinary differential equations (ODE) model15, which considered also a varying

107

percentage of asymptomatic individuals, compliance with mandate to wear masks, and a different

108

inward and outward efficacy of protection. However, the authors consider face masks as the sole

109

preventative, excluding additional NPIs like SD or shelter in place1.

110

Additionally, the problem has been studied in several papers using agent-based models,

111

each being focused on a specific part of the problem. In some cases, the presence of asymptomatic

112

infected individuals was not considered16,17. In other studies, the efficacy of wearing masks was not

113

analyzed when combined with other NPIs18. Finally, the difference in inward and outward protection

114

given by a face mask was often neglected or parametrized with a single value19. A rather

115

comprehensive data-driven investigation of all these effects has been performed by Hoertel et al.20.

116

However, their results are specific to the country of France, and the high dimensionality of the

117

parameter space makes it difficult to disentangle the effect of the various interventions.

118

In our current study, we analyzed the relative efficacy of wearing face masks and/or

119

exercising SD to reducing the spread of COVID-19 in the presence of asymptomatic individuals.

120

This analysis may be particularly important in the current phase of the pandemic. As

121

pharmaceutical interventions (e.g. vaccines) are deployed, people may experience a false sense

122

of safety, which may lead to unsafe behavior. This may allow the virus to circulate at the interface

123

between immune and non-immune individuals, accelerating the emergence of variants resistant to

124

vaccination. Face masks have distinct inward and outward protection, parameterized using a

125

Gamma function (see Methods). Through stochastic computer simulations of infection spread, we

126

modeled realistic outbreak scenarios and found that SD only yields beneficial effects if

127

accompanied by a widespread population adherence to SD. In contrast, wearing face masks is a

128

highly effective strategy to reduce the spread of infection. Our results are general, and suggest

129

that, even when a large fraction of infected individuals is asymptomatic, mask wearing is the most

130

effective strategy to control virus spread and alleviate the impact of COVID-19 outbreak, particularly

131

when combined with conditions of partial SD compatible with the function of society.

Stochastic model description and calibration. We developed an agent-based model (ABM) to

139

environmental changes23 according to rules that describe their interactions. To model the COVID-

140

19 pandemic, we used a SEAIR system in which each agent represents an individual who can be

141

susceptible (S), exposed (E), asymptomatically infected (A), symptomatically infected (I), or

142

recovered (R). Although important, we do not explicitly consider reinfection with the same or a

143

different viral variant, as it is outside the scope of this work. To obtain a realistic model of virus

144

spread, we chose parameters that describe the spread of SARS-CoV2: transmission events occur

145

through contacts made between susceptible and infectious individuals in close proximity (distance

146

≤ 2r, Fig. 1A), and exposed individuals undergo an incubation period of 5.1 days to become

147

infectious (Fig. 1, spheres with red border). This incubation time represents the interval required to

148

increase viral loads to levels sufficient for transmission3 4,24. We assume that recovered individuals

149

(Fig. 1, spheres with black border), who resolve the infection, cannot be re-infected or infect others,

150

which is a reasonable assumption for the duration of our models (45 days). Symptomatic agents

151

are in the Infected state for 7 days but are only infectious to other agents for 12 hours.

152

Asymptomatic agents are infectious for all 7 days but the probability of transmission is reduced by

153

33%. Presymptomatic agents are similar to Susceptible agents in their interactions but have a

154

countdown for 5.1 days until they become either asymptomatically or symptomatically Infected

155

To define the probabilities of infection, we used reported COVID-19 parameters24. The

156

probability of transmission follows a G (gamma) distribution (see Methods) whose shape is

157

described by a constant (a), estimated to be 0.25. Wearing masks reduces this probability (Fig. 1,

158

probability of infection). To estimate the protective effect of masks, we used parameters determined

159

for FDA-approved surgical masks, whose efficacy has been experimentally verified to inhibit virus

160

transmission10. Based on previous studies (Leung et al.)9, we assumed that, if an infectious

161

individual wears a mask, the effective probability of transmission is reduced by 95%. If a susceptible

162

individual wears a mask, a is reduced by 85% (Fig. 1A). Our assumption that wearing masks is

163

more effective to reduce transmission than to prevent getting infected is supported by experimental

164

data25. However, if both infectious and susceptible individuals wear masks the probability of

165

transmission is the product of these probabilities (0.0075) and, thus, sufficiently low such that

166

transmission is effectively null. We calibrated our model by running simulations without any

167

individuals wearing a face mask or practicing SD and considering that 50% of infected individuals

168

are asymptomatic at the beginning of the simulation, with each new infection throughout the

169

epidemic having a 50% probability of being asymptomatic (Movie 1). In this way, we determined

170

the simulation parameters, such as velocity and density of individuals, to obtain a value of R0 = 2.5,

171

consistent with what was reported early on as the infection rate of the epidemic in Wuhan9.

172

Percentage of population wearing masks determines the daily infection incidence and

173

cumulative number of cases. We started each simulation with one individual being infected and

174

all others susceptible and assuming all subsequent infections have a 50% chance of being an

175

asymptomatic. Non-infected and asymptomatic individuals circulate in the population without any

176

restriction (i.e., they do not isolate themselves or become hospitalized) (see Methods). In contrast,

177

symptomatic individuals no longer move after 12 hours of the symptom onset, simulating

178

hospitalization or self-isolation. Thus, symptoms are assumed to manifest after the incubation time

179

of 5.1 days (Fig. 2B). Using these assumptions and model calibration, we carried out a set of

180

simulations in which we gradually increased the percentage of individuals in the population that

181

wear masks. Individuals, who are assigned randomly to wear a mask at the beginning of the

182

simulation, keep on the mask for the entire duration of the simulation. Increasing the fraction of the

183

population wearing face masks has a highly significant effect on the spread of the virus (Fig. 1B,

184

1C and Movie 2). Mask wearing reduces the cumulative number of infected individuals at the end

185

of the simulation (Fig. 1B). Strikingly, we observed a negative correlation between the percentage

186

of the population wearing masks and the overall number of cases (Fig. 1B). The description of the

187

dynamics of infection generated by this model is consistent with previous clinical studies9,25 and

188

highlights the benefit of wearing masks (Fig. 1C, Movie 1).

189

If the daily incidence surpasses the treatment capacity, it will overwhelm the healthcare

190

system with detrimental consequences for medical care of infected individuals and increased

191

mortality and morbidity. Thus, we examined the effects of face masks on the daily incidence of

192

infection over time (Fig. 2B). If all individuals move freely and randomly interact with others (i.e.,

193

0% SD), the rate of daily infection through the population depends on the percentage of individuals

194

wearing masks. The average number of new daily infection varies considerably, according to the

8

195

number of individuals wearing face masks. When 0% of individuals wear face masks (Fig. 2b, red

196

line), the number of daily infections peaks sharply at day 27 with a maximum of 54.8 (51.2, 58.4

197

95% C.I.) infections per day for a population of 500 individuals. No additional infections are

198

observed after day 39, when the entire population (100%) has been infected. Thus, without any

199

intervention, the infection quickly reaches every individual through an epidemic characterized by a

200

very sharp infection peak. Note that, in these original models, we assume all individuals recover

201

after ~11 days post-infection and cannot be re-infected. When 40% of all individuals wear masks,

202

the number of individuals infected at any given day is reduced by approximately 30% (maximum of

203

infected individuals 35.1 (32.6, 37.7 95% C.I.) Fig. 2A, blue line), both flattening the curve and

204

extending the duration of the outbreak by more than 10 days, with a peak maximum at day 32. By

205

day 52, an average of 472 individuals has been infected, and none of the individuals is infectious

206

or exposed any longer. Even more significantly, if 80% of the population wear masks, we observed

207

a significant flattening of the curve, with a substantial reduction in the maximum number of infected

208

individuals per day, 5.9 (4.6, 7.3 95% C.I.) (Fig. 2A, green line), and the number of new infected

209

individuals reached zero by day 57.8 ± 35.0. Thus, the shape of the outbreak changes from a curve

210

characterized by a sharp peak when no intervention is considered to a broader peak when 80% of

211

the individuals wear masks. By increasing the percentage of the individuals wearing masks, the

212

number of newly infected individuals per day substantially decreases, which will reduce mortality

213

and morbidity. Moreover, since the use of masks eliminates the sharp peak that characterizes

214

SARS CoV2 epidemics, the overall impact of the outbreak on the health system is alleviated. These

215

results highlight the importance of widespread mask wearing as an effective intervention that can

216

be implemented as soon as the first cases are reported.

217

Effect of social distancing on viral infection spread. Next, we evaluated the effect of SD in

218

shaping the spread of infection. Practicing SD does not affect the probability of infection conditional

219

on an encounter but reduces the chances of encounters leading to transmission. Thus, SD was

220

introduced into the model by limiting the proportion of individuals in the population that move freely

221

in the field. This simulates a scenario in which a given proportion of individuals in the population

222

quarantine or shelter-in-place, thereby reducing the probability of contacts and transmission (Fig.

223

2A). As reported, if a percentage of individuals practice SD, even without any other non-

224

pharmacological intervention, the number of infections and daily infection rate are reduced

225

(compare Fig. 2B, SD 0, 40, and 80%, red line). However, if no one wears masks but 40% of

226

individuals practice SD, we observed a very small effect in the shape of the infection curve (Fig.

227

2B, the peak maximum decreases from 51.0 (48.3, 53.6 95% C.I.) to 30.1 (27.5, 32.7 95% C.I.) ().

228

When 80% of the population practices SD, a more significant reduction in the number of new daily

229

infections was observed (Fig. 2B, 80%). Notably, the shape of the new daily infection curve

230

broadens considerably upon increasing the percentage of individuals wearing face masks (Fig. 2B,

231

compare blue and green curves with red curve). For instance, if 80% of the population wears masks

232

with 40% SD, the peak maximum decreases to one-tenth (from 51.0 (48.3, 53.6 95% C.I.) to 5.7

233

(4.5, 6.7 95% C.I.)) and is slightly delayed (Fig. 2B). At 80% SD, the peak of new daily infections is

234

no longer observed, and the number of new infected individuals per day averages 1.6 (1.4, 1.9 95%

235

C.I.) (Fig. 2B). Thus, the effects of individuals wearing face masks and practicing SD are

236

synergistic, with the most pronounced effects occurring when 60% or 80% of individuals wear

237

masks.

238

It is possible that our results may vary depending on the way social distancing is

239

implemented in the model. To test this possibility, we carried out additional simulations in which

240

modulate the amounts of social distancing by completely removing infected agent practicing SD

241

from the simulation, and only allowed infected agents to be symptomatically infected (see SM 6).

242

The results from these simulations were similar to those described above, confirming that around

243

~60-80% of the population is required to practice SD to effectively slow the rate of infection, even

244

when SD reduce the probability of transmission to zero. Our results also show that, if infection is

245

always symptomatic, the number of infections drops significantly, which is consistent with the

246

spread driven by asymptomatic individuals.

249

Effectiveness of combining mask wearing and social distancing to control infection in

250

populations with high proportions of pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic cases.

251

Asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection is emerging as possibly the most

252

common clinical manifestation of COVID-1926-30. This finding could only be revealed once mass

253

testing campaigns were performed, regardless of symptoms (e.g., universal testing campaigns).

254

One of the earliest studies documenting clinical manifestations in a testing campaign (which still

255

focused testing mainly on symptomatic individuals) was on the Diamond Princess cruise ship,

256

where the rate of asymptomatic infection was 18%31,32. In a mass testing campaign in Iceland,

257

where testing was offered to a segment of the general population (regardless of symptoms), 43%

258

of individuals were asymptomatic at the time of testing33. Thus, the actual percentage of pre-

259

symptomatic and asymptomatic cases is currently unknown, but it is clear that a large number of

260

SARS CoV2 new infections derive from undetected infections. Controlling the outbreaks by

261

isolation or even by increased population testing is a big challenge and may be difficult to

262

implement. We thus determined the efficacy of mask wearing and SD in the context of different

263

proportions of asymptomatic incidence. We assume that asymptomatic individuals are less

264

infectious than symptomatic individuals: asymptomatic individuals may have lower viral loads and

265

reduced coughing, sneezing, and nasal secretions, all of which may facilitate transmission34-36. The

266

model considers that symptomatic infected individuals isolated themselves 12 hours after the onset

267

of symptoms, because they get hospitalized or self-isolated. In contrast, asymptomatic individuals

268

remain infectious, circulate and transmit for a period of 7 days (Fig. 3A). Because some individuals

269

can be pre-symptomatic (i.e., symptoms emerge later after the initial incubation time (Fig. 2B, t=

270

5.1 days)), we modelled infectivity of asymptomatic/pre-symptomatic as linearly declining until the

271

individual is no longer infectious, after 7 days37. Using these assumptions, we performed a

272

sensitivity analysis by carrying out simulations, varying the percent of asymptomatic/pre-

273

symptomatic cases to determine the efficiency of non-pharmacological interventions in populations

274

with 25, 50, and 75% pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic infected individuals (Fig. 3).

275

Our simulations demonstrate that the total number of infected individuals increases linearly

276

with the increase of the percentage of asymptomatic individuals in the population (Fig. 3B). To

277

compare each condition, we normalized the peak of new daily infected individuals to conditions in

278

which no one practiced SD or wore masks. Strikingly, increasing the percentage of individuals

279

wearing masks linearly reduces the normalized peak number of infected individuals per day (Fig.

280

3B). For instance, when 40% of the individuals wear face masks, the peak number of infected

281

decreases similarly independently of the percent of asymptomatic cases considered (to 0.6–0.7,

282

Fig. 3B). Furthermore, the linear relationship between the decrease in peak number of newly

283

infected individuals per day and increase in percent individuals wearing masks is independent of

284

the proportion of asymptomatic individuals in the population (Fig. 3B). This finding indicates that,

285

when the fraction of asymptomatic cases is high, as in the case for COVID-19, wearing face masks

286

is as effective to reduce the peak number of infected as when a low percentage of individuals are

287

asymptomatically infected.

288

In contrast, SD was only effective in populations with high incidence of asymptomatic

289

infections when a very high fraction of the population practice SD (more than 60%) (Fig. 3B).

290

Furthermore, the low efficacy of SD as a containment strategy is more pronounced when the

291

proportion of asymptomatic individuals increase (compare 25, 50, and 75%). Of note, if the number

292

of individuals wearing face masks is high, increasing the number of individuals practicing SD has

293

negligible effects on the daily number of infected individuals (see supplementary materials). One

294

noteworthy observation from our model is that, at high rates of SD (e.g. 80 %), there is more

295

variability.

296

Our analysis uncovers a linear relationship between the fraction of a population wearing

297

masks and the reduction in infection rate. In contrast, we find SD requires a high fraction of

298

compliance to be effective. These findings indicate that having a high percentage of individuals

299

wearing face masks is more beneficial in preventing virus spread and reducing the peak number of

300

infected individuals than having a high percent of people practicing SD. Notably, the benefit of

301

wearing masks is not affected if the percent of pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic increases.

304

percentage of individuals wearing masks and practicing SD (standard deviation described in Fig.

305

SM3-A). When neither SD nor masks were used our simulations indicate that up to 99% of the

306

population will end up infected, leading to unacceptable levels of mortality and morbidity. When the

307

proportion of the population wearing masks was increased, no significant effect on the total number

308

of infected people was noted until more than 40% of the population wore masks. However, if 80%

309

of people use masks, the average cumulative incidence of infection decreased to around 35%.

310

Therefore, wearing face masks alone would greatly limit the spread of the virus. In contrast, SD

311

alone does not have a significant effect. Increasing SD compliance to 80% only reduced total

312

infections by 8%, and 87% of the population was eventually infected. Importantly, the combination

313

of wearing masks and practicing SD by a high proportion of the population dramatically reduces

314

the total number of infected individuals to 10% of the population (Fig. 4A; and Fig. SM2-C).

315

To gain additional insights into the characteristics of the epidemic in response to these

316

mitigation strategies, we studied the shape of the epidemic curve by calculating the peak and full-

317

width half-maximum (FWHM) of the peak of the new daily infections (Methods). While the peak

318

reports on the maximum number of daily infections at the height of the epidemic, the FWHM is a

319

simple way to represent the duration of the characteristic peak of new daily infections. Indeed,

320

FWHM reports on the extinction time of the infection within the population (number of days until no

321

individual is still infected) (Fig. 4A, and Fig. SM3-B standard deviation). A larger FWHM

322

corresponds to a flatter but longer epidemic curve. A flatter epidemic curve enables better

323

management of the epidemic, as the healthcare system is not overwhelmed by the number of cases

324

at a given time. Initially, the FWHM was calculated assuming no individual practice SD. FWHM was

325

~8.3 days if none of the individuals wears masks, ~12.8 if 40% of individuals wear masks, and but

326

increases dramatically to 85.4 when 80% of the population wears masks (Fig. 2B). Our data

327

indicate that wearing masks has a more profound effect than SD on flattening the epidemic curve.

328

For instance, when 80% of the population wears masks, the epidemic curve is eight times flatter

329

than without any non-pharmacological intervention (Fig. 4B). In contrast, if 80% of the population

330

practices SD, the flattening of the curve is less than threefold. The most dramatic effect on flattening

331

of the curve is observed when wearing masks is combined with SD; for instance, if 80% of the

13

332

population wears masks and 80% practices SD, the curve is flattened over 10-fold, compared to

333

no intervention.

334

We also find that the reduction in the number of infected individuals per day correlates with

335

a lengthening of the outbreak. Broadening of the peak affects the extinction time of the infection

336

(Fig. 4C). For instance, when the percentage of individuals wearing face masks rises from 0 to 80%

337

of the population, the extinction time increases from ~39.0 to ~58 days (Fig. 4C). Similarly, as a

338

higher proportion of individuals practice SD, the time to extinction of the infection also increases

339

(Fig. 4C, ~39 to ~54 days for 0% to 80% of SD). Importantly, even though the time to epidemic

340

extinction is extended, the total number of infected individuals dramatically decreases (Fig. 4A). If

341

a higher proportion of the population (80%) wears face masks and practices SD, the time to

342

epidemic extinction is reduced (Fig. 4C) because the total number of infected individuals is

343

dramatically reduced (Fig. 4A). Thus, stochastic effects dominate, and this can be appreciated by

344

the wider error bars (Fig. 4F).

345

To relate the impact of these interventions to their societal impact, we determined the

346

number of deaths per million after each mitigation strategy, assuming a mortality rate of ~3%38.

347

This analysis illustrates the heavy cost of lives of the virus, but also demonstrates that a high level

348

of mask wearing compliance is the most effective non-pharmacological approach to protect human

349

lives, particularly when combined with even moderate SD measures (Fig. 4D). In contrast, SD,

350

without masks wearing is not effective to reduce mortality (Fig. 4E). Finally, our simulations predict

351

that increasing the proportion of the population wearing masks will increase the time to outbreak

352

extinction (from ~40 to ~60 days) (Fig. 4F). Together with the broadening of the peak (Fig. 4C), this

353

shows an effective flattening of the curve. Importantly, with 80% mask wearing, we observed an

354

increase in the statistical distribution from the average time to extinction (Fig. 4F, see 95%

355

confidence intervals). Thus, a generally low disease incidence triggers stochastic events leading to

356

extinction of the infection. Our simulations represent real outbreak scenarios and reveal that as the

357

outbreak approaches its extinction there is an increase in the uncertainty of whether or not the

14

Discussion

362

Here we use realistic simulations rooted in experimentally measured parameters of SARS-Cov2

363

spread, contagion mode and mortality, to evaluate two available NPIs that reduce the spread of a

364

respiratory infection, such as COVID-19. In our simulation, we assumed proper use of FDA-

365

approved face masks. We showed that a high degree of compliance in the use of masks, regardless

366

of whether the wearer displays symptoms, slows the spread of infection. Face masks substantially

367

reduce the transmission of respiratory droplets and aerosols containing viral particles9-11.

368

Increasing the fraction of the population wearing face masks reduces the number of new infected

369

individuals per day and flattened the curve of total individuals infected (Fig. 2A and 4A). These two

370

effects should reduce mortality and morbidity, alleviate the current stress on healthcare systems,

371

and enable a more effective management of severe cases. However, solely wearing masks cannot

372

entirely prevent an outbreak from occurring. It cannot by itself extinguish the virus, since as long

373

as a small fraction of the population is non-compliant, the virus can persist in the population. Our

374

models show that combining proper use of masks with practices such as SD, indisputably

375

decreases the number of new infected individuals per day (Fig. 2). The asymmetry between the

376

effectiveness of SD and mask wearing is of particular interest. In a classical, ODE-based

377

epidemiological model, mask wearing and SD would both affect the transmission rate. In the

378

absence of SD, imagining a 100% effectiveness of mask, the reduction in transmission due to mask

379

wearing would be the same as the decrease due to SD in the absence of mask wearing. In fact,

380

both controls would be, effectively, modeled as a removal of people from the population. On the

381

other hand, our simulations show that mask wearing has a stronger effect than SD on the disease

382

incidence. This is due to the way we model SD, that is, as a decrease in mobility. A better

383

approximation of our model is to consider an epidemic dynamic on a scale-free network, where

384

homogeneous mixing is relaxed and SD is modeled as a change in the degree distribution of the

15

385

network39. In addition, our model was demonstrated to be scalable and able to describe realistic

386

situations such as interactions between 5000 agents (see supplementary materials).

387

Our analysis provides guidance for policies to protect the population from COVID-19.

388

Optimizing the use of masks with SD practices effectively limits the virus spread and reduces

389

several parameters in the epidemic, including cumulative incidence, shape of the peak, and the

390

extinction rate (Fig. 3). In particular, we observed that wearing masks is more effective than SD.

391

Even in a population with a high number of asymptomatic infections, increasing the use of masks

392

up to 80% results in a significant reduction in infection (Fig. 4A). Meanwhile, even 80% of individuals

393

practicing SD has only a marginal effect (Fig. 4D). This result can be understood in terms of contact

394

rate, since we assume that asymptomatic infectious individuals have higher mobility than

395

symptomatic infectious ones. If the vast majority of the population is asymptomatic, then high

396

compliance with face mask use is a key factor for curbing the epidemic. Moreover, we believe that

397

our methods are general and they may inform policies against other respiratory infections like

398

influenza.

399

Our simulations also provide insights into how enforcing different mitigation practices

400

affects the length of the epidemic. Assuming a homogenous population, the trajectory of epidemic

401

extinction lasts 50–60 days, when 80% of the population either wears masks or practices SD (Fig.

402

4C). However, when 80% of the population is wearing masks and 0% of the population is practicing

403

SD, the cumulative incidence is reduced three times (~35%), and the peak is very broad (FWHM

404

of ~ 85 days). In contrast, when the population solely practices SD (80%), the majority of the

405

population (93%) will end up infected, and the peak of daily infected individuals will be sharper

406

(FWHM of ~ 20 days).

407

Our model indicates that the synergistic utilization of face mask wearing and social

408

distancing practice is most effective in controlling SARS-CoV-2 spread. We observed that wearing

409

masks in combination with some degree of SD relaxes the need for a complete lockdown, leading

410

to a potential suggestion for an intervention policy based on a mix of the two measures. The

411

effectiveness of mask wearing to control virus spread is not reduced if a large fraction of the

16

412

population is asymptomatic. This suggests that, in the absence of universal testing, widespread

413

use of face masks is necessary and sufficient to prevent a large outbreak. Our results are supported

414

by the real data of Korea33 and Taiwan34, where an early mandate to requiring face mask usage,

415

in combination with SD, severely limited the spread of the virus. While more work is necessary to

416

specifically assess the impact of other variables shaping COVID-19 outbreaks, such as increased

417

mobility, age stratification, testing a fraction of the population, our study can accurately inform

418

strategies to reduce the spread of the virus. In particular, our results may be highly relevant toward

419

informing specific realistic situations, such as the spread of the disease in a confined space, where

420

effective SD may not be easily achievable (e.g., schools, essential businesses, correctional

421

facilities, public transportation, hospitals). These strategies, if effectively implemented, will save

422

countless lives from the SARS-Cov2 infection. According to our model, if the United States (330

423

million people) does not implement any NPIs, then ~627,000 people are expected to die.

424

Contrastingly, if 80% of the population wear face masks, that number would significantly shrink to

425

about 250,000. If both face masks and SD were practiced by 80% of the population from the start

426

of a pandemic, the mortality rate decreases to 65,600 people.

427

Materials and Methods

428

We developed and used our python codes using the NumPy library version 1.15.440 to carry out

429

ABM and describe the dynamic evolution of a SEAIR system affected by COVID-19 disease, in

430

which each individual can be in a susceptible (S), exposed (E), asymptomatic infected (A),

431

symptomatic infected (I), or recovered (R) status. In addition, each individual can wear a face mask

432

(M) or can practice social distancing (SD), where wearing face masks or practicing SD are

433

independent binary values of an individual. In the simulations, each individual was represented by

434

a position in a 2-D lattice of 21x21 dimension with periodic boundary conditions. Individual initial

435

positions are assigned randomly by NumPy’s random module, and the simulations start with all

436

susceptible individuals and only one exposed. During the simulation, each individual move along a

437

randomly oriented trajectory at a constant velocity, moves the same distance between each time

438

step of the simulation, and interacts with individuals whose position is within a fixed diameter of

439

another individual. The data from each individual are saved as vectors of attributes, including

440

position, velocity, state (S, E, A, I, R, M, SD), and number of individuals they come into contact with

441

at every simulation time step. A time step corresponds to 1 hour. We implemented the state of M

442

by defining sub-routine during the interaction between two individuals where the probability of

443

infection was reduced by an amount corresponding to which of the two individuals is wearing a

444

mask. For the SD state, we assigned the individual to be stationary and not follow along a randomly

445

assigned trajectory.

446

We refer to Ferguson et al. for defining the rules governing the interactions among

447

individuals24. For the interaction between symptomatic infected and susceptible individuals, the

448

infection probability was randomly sampled from a gamma distribution with a mean of 1 and a

449

shape of 2.5, whereas for that between asymptomatic infected and susceptible individuals, the

450

infection probability is reduced by 33 %. We assume this reduction of infectivity for the

451

asymptomatic, based on the absence of transmission-aiding symptoms, such as coughing,

452

sneezing, and a runny nose24. The time between a susceptible individual being exposed to being

453

in the infectious infected state is 5.1 days24. Pre-symptomatic agents are defined as infected agents

454

during the incubation period. Symptomatic infected individuals are infectious for 12 hours before

455

self-isolating. After this time, we assume that these individuals no longer infect those around them

456

because they are hospitalized or self-isolating. Asymptomatic infected individuals are infectious for

457

7 days, and the infectivity linearly declines until the individual is no longer infectious on day 737. If

458

an infected, a susceptible, or both individuals are wearing a mask their probability of another

459

individual being infected is reduced to 5, 15, or 0%, respectively, from the original gamma

460

distribution.

461

First, we carried out a simulation with 500 individuals with 0% of individuals wearing face

462

masks and 0% practicing SD to optimize parameters as velocities and individual density to obtain

463

a basic reproduction number, R0, equal to 2.5, based on reported values. The basic reproduction

464

number was computed from the mean number of symptomatic cases, resulting from a single

465

symptomatic individual. Then, we carried out four more sets of simulations in which we increased

466

the percentage of individuals wearing masks by the 20, 40, 60, and 80%. Finally, for each of these

467

simulation sets we carried out four more sets in which we increased the percentage of individuals

468

practicing SD by the 20, 40, 60, and 80%. Simulations are stochastic, and we simulated each

469

condition 100 times to increase the statistical power of the analysis. In total, we simulated 25

470

different conditions for a total of 2500 simulations, 100 for each condition. In all these simulations,

471

the probability of a new infection being asymptomatic was 50%. Simulations were run until there

472

were no individuals either infected or exposed. Summary values were computed by methods in the

473

NumPy module. Error bars were calculated by the standard deviation method in NumPy and for

474

figure 3 and 4 the error bars were calculated by 95% confidence interval. The full-width half-

475

maximum (FWHM) was calculated for each simulation from the newly infected per day data by

476

taking the maximum and using it to find the days that intersect the value of half the maximum value.

477

The first and last days of this intersection were then used to calculate the number of days of the

478

FWHM. From the set of FWHM for each simulation, an average and standard deviation were

479

calculated using the NumPy module. FWHM error bars are large due to a large variation in how flat

480

the curves are. Graphs were created by using the Matplotlib41 and Seaborn42 modules in python.

481

We followed the same protocol described above to perform simulations, varying the

482

probability of a new infection being asymptomatic from 25 to 75%. Finally, to monitor the

483

reproducibility of our results with a larger population and contrast with real data, we ran four sets

484

of 30 simulations with 5000 individuals in the combinations of 0 or 80% SD and 0 or 80% wearing

485

masks. All 5000 individual simulations were done with 50% asymptomatic infection rates.

486

As the position, trajectory, and state of each individual in the simulation are explicitly

487

known, using the matplotlib library’s animation package, we converted each time step of the

488

simulation to an image in a movie, representing 1 day as a second spanning the length of the

489

simulation.

490

For each simulation, we saved in a .csv in tidy data format the summary values of the

491

simulations, which we used for the analysis. The simulation was written in python and all scripts

Figure 1. Individual states and rules of interactions. Using the same coloring system used in

638

animated simulations, we show the different states an individual can be in during a simulation.

639

Individuals keep the masked or not masked attribute assigned at initialization during the course of

640

the simulation. A) Spread of infection is caused by interactions of overlapping trajectories between

641

infected and susceptible individuals. If the distance between individuals, d, is less than the radius

642

of the two individuals, r, then an interaction occurs. Interactions initiate the generation of a random

643

number that determines if transmission occurs. The chance of infection is randomly generated,

644

based on a gamma distribution with shape parameter, alpha, of 0.25. This probability is further

645

modulated by which individuals in the interactions are wearing face masks.

Figure 3. Effects of the asymptomatic population on the infected peak number. A) Schematic

663

representation of the asymptomatic transmission during the simulations. After 5.1 days of coming

664

into contact with an infected individual, infectious agents can develop symptoms and after 12 hours

665

will be isolated. On the contrary, asymptomatic individuals don’t develop symptoms of the disease

666

so they are not isolated but keep circulating thus contributing to spread the infection for 7 more

667

days after the initial contact with an infectious agent. B) The normalized peak of new daily infected

668

is represented as a function of the percentage of the population wearing mask (left panels, green

669

solid circles) and as a function of increasing the percentage of asymptomatic individuals (25% top

670

left panel, 50% central left panel, 75% bottom left panel). The normalized peak of new daily infected

671

is represented as a function of the percentage of the population practicing social distance (right

672

panels, blue solid circles) and as a function of increasing the percentage of asymptomatic

673

individuals (25% top right panel, 50% central right panel, 75% bottom right panel). Error bars
