Abstract

Background:

Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) has been repeatedly described in COVID-

19 and may contribute to SARS-CoV-2 associated hypercoagulability. The underlying
mechanisms remain elusive. We hypothesized that endothelial damage may lead to
substantially increased concentrations of Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) with subsequent
relative deficiency of ADAMTS13. Methods: A prospective controlled trial was performed on
75 patients with COVID-19 of mild to critical severity and 10 healthy controls. VWF antigen
(VWF:Ag), ADAMTS13 and VWF multimer formation were analyzed in a German
hemostaseologic laboratory.

Results:

VWF:Ag was 4.8 times higher in COVID-19 patients

compared to healthy controls (p<0.0001), whereas ADAMTS13 activities were not
significantly different (p=0.24). The ADAMTS13/VWF:Ag ratio was significantly lower in
COVID-19 than in the control group (24.4±20.5 vs. 79.7±33.2, p<0.0001). Fourteen patients
(18.7%) undercut a critical ratio of 10 as described in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura
(TTP). Gel analysis of multimers resembled the TTP constellation with loss of the largest
multimers in 75% and a smeary triplet pattern in 39% of the patients. The
ADAMTS13/VWF:Ag ratio decreased continuously from mild to critical disease (ANOVA
p=0.026). Moreover, it differed significantly between surviving patients and those who died
from COVID-19 (p=0.001) yielding an AUC of 0.232 in ROC curve analysis.

Conclusion:

COVID-19 is associated with a substantial increase in VWF levels, which can exceed the
ADAMTS13 processing capacity resulting in the formation of large VWF multimers identical
to TTP. The ADAMTS13/VWF:Ag ratio is an independent predictor of severity of disease and
mortality. These findings render further support to perform studies on the use of plasma
exchange in COVID-19 and to include VWF and ADAMTS13 in the diagnostic workup.

Introduction

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with hypercoagulation affecting both the
venous and arterial vasculature. Venous thomboembolism occurs in up to one-third of
patients in intensive care.1 Arterial thrombembolism events, such as stroke, limb ischemia,
and myocardial infarction have been described in COVID-19 as well.2,3 Beyond these
macrovascular events, autopsy studies have demonstrated microvascular thrombosis in the
lungs.4,5 The pathogenesis of SARS Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) induced hypercoagulation is
incompletely understood. On one hand, endothelial injury is supposed to play a central role,6
on the other blood hyperviscosity and an imbalance of pro- and antithrombotic factors have
been reported including elevated factor VIII, fibrinogen, and von Willebrand factor (VWF).7-9
Of note, there is an increasing number of reports on thrombotic events despite therapeutic
plasmatic anticoagulation.
In some of our patients with COVID-19 we observed laboratory findings of microangiopathic
hemolysis. Simultaneously, first cases of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) were reported
by other groups in COVID-19 patients.10,11 To date, the pathophysiology of TMA in COVID-19
remains elusive. Based on the mechanisms underlying TMA in general, complementmediation and a deficiency in ADAMTS13 may be considered. We investigated, whether the
latter mechanism may play a pivotal role in this context.
As a blood glycoprotein involved in hemostasis Von Willebrand factor (VWF) is produced by
endothelial cells and megakaryocytes.12 Endothelial cell activation is associated with the
elevation of VWF. Accordingly, an increasing number of reports describe increased
concentrations of VWF in COVID-19.13,14 The plasma protease ADAMTS13, a zinc-containing
metalloprotease cleaves the large string-like molecules of VWF and is necessary to avoid
accumulation of VWF multimers in the blood stream. In patients with ADAMTS13 deficiency

ADAMTS13 has rarely been investigated in the context of COVID-19 and, in contrast to TTP,
was normal or only mildly reduced.11,15,16 We therefore hypothesized that a massive
elevation of VWF with clinically relevant VWF multimer abnormalities in COVID-19 patients
may exceed the enzymatic capacity of ADAMTS13, which could contribute to the SARS-CoV-2
associated hypercoagulation.
To test this, we performed a prospective controlled trial on VWF antigen (VWF:Ag),
ADAMTS13 activity and VWF multimer formation in a cohort of 75 COVID-19 patients. 10
healthy subjects served as control.

Methods

We enrolled 75 patients, who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR analysis of
respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal swab test or bronchoalveolar lavage). Patients were
recruited at Ruhr-University Bochum, University of Duisburg-Essen, and Asklepios Klinikum
Hamburg Harburg, Germany. The severity of COVID-19 ranged from mild to critical and was
categorized according to the guidelines of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany. Patients with
moderate and severe COVID-19 were recruited after the first symptoms occurred and a
positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR result was available. For patients with critical disease, the
recruitment took place at the intensive care unit, being diagnosed with COVID-19 in median
14 days before. The study was approved by the ethical committees of Ruhr-University
Bochum (20-6886), University Hospital Essen (20-9214-BO) and the Medical Association
Hamburg. Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients are summarized in Table 1.

Measurement of ADAMTS13 activity, VWF antigen and VWF multimer analysis

ADAMTS13 activity (%) was analyzed from citrate-plasma using Technozym ADAMTS13 ELISA
(Technoclone, Vienna, Austria).17 VWF:Ag (iU/ml) was measured using a sandwich ELISA with
polyclonal antibodies.18 VWF multimer analysis was performed via sodium dodecyl sulfate
agarose gel electrophoresis including a control sample containing normal VWF in each run to

ratio below 10 reflects the clinical situation of patients with acquired thrombotic
thrombocytopenic purpura, where the vast majority of patients show ADAMTS13 activities
below 10%. It is well known that a residual activity above 10% is sufficient to cleave the

potentially harmful ultralarge VWF multimers. In the clinical situation of COVID19 patients,
the imbalance between the ADAMTS13 activity in the low reference range and the massively
enhanced VWF leads to a TTP like situation, whenever the ADAMTS13/VWF ratio falls below
10.

Statistics

Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation. Baseline differences in severity groups
were compared by chi-squared tests for dichotomic parameters and by unpaired two-tailed
t-tests for continuous parameters. Differences in ADAMTS13 activity, VWF:Ag, and
ADAMTS13/VWF:Ag ratio between patients with COVID-19 and healthy controls and
between surviving patients and patients, who ultimately died from COVID-19, were
investigated by unpaired two-tailed t-tests. Receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC)
were built to assess the predictive value for death from COVID-19. Univariate linear
regression analysis was performed to investigate the association of age and laboratory
findings on the ADAMTS13/VWF:Ag ratio in COVID-19 patients. P<0.05 was regarded
significant. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics 25 (IBM, Chicago, USA)
and Prism 8 (Graph Pad, San Diego, USA).

Results

We enrolled 75 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and 10 healthy controls in the study.
Measurements of VWF:Ag and ADAMTS13 were conducted successfully in all the patients.
Mean age of the COVID-19 population was 66±16 years. Gender distribution was
homogeneous with n=38 being female (50.7%). Three patients (4%) had mild, 26 (34.7%)
moderate, 28 (37.3%) severe, and 18 (24%) critical disease. Thirteen patients (17.3%) died.
The control population had a mean age of 41±19 and was predominantly female. Table 1
summarizes demographic and clinical characteristics of the study population.
Table 2 presents the coagulation parameters of the study population and the control group.
The VWF:Ag was substantially increased compared to the control group (4.03±2.18 IU/ml vs.
0.84±0.27 IU/ml, p < 0.0001, Figure 1A). ANOVA analysis showed no significant difference
between the degrees of severity. ADAMTS13 activity was comparable to healthy controls
(67.8±22.4% vs. 59.3±8.6%, p=0.24; Figure 1B). There was a significant difference in
ADAMTS13 activities, however, among the different severity degrees of COVID 19 (ANOVA
p=0.001; Figure 2B). The ratio of ADAMTS13/VWF:Ag was substantially lower in COVID-19
patients than in healthy controls (24.4±20.5 vs. 79.7±33.2, p<0.0001, Figure 1C). The ratio of
ADAMTS13/VWF:Ag decreased continuously with the degree of COVID-19 severity (ANOVA
p=0.026; Figure 2C).
Comparing patients who died from COVID-19 with those who survived, ADAMTS13 and
ADAMTS13/VWF:Ag ratio were significantly lower in subjects who did not survive COVID-19
(72.6±20.4% vs. 45.2±18.0%, p<0.001 for ADAMTS13 and 26.8±21.4 vs. 13.0±10.3, p=0.001
for ADAMTS13/VWF ratio). VWF:Ag did not significantly differ between survivors and those
who died (p=0.181). ROC analyses for ADAMTS13/VWF:Ag and death from COVID-19
provided an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.232. The results are presented in Figure 3.

Univariate linear regression analysis was performed to investigate the association of age and
laboratory findings on the ADAMTS13/VWF:Ag ratio in COVID-19 patients (Table 3). Age (T 3.269, p=0.002), C-reactive protein (T -2.777, p=0.007), platelet count (T 2.345, p=0.022),
hemoglobin (T 2.401, p=0.019) and partial thromboplastin time (T -2.576, p=0.012) revealed
significant associations with the ADAMTS13/VWF:Ag ratio. In multivariate linear regression
for these parameters, a significant association remained for age (p=0.005), hemoglobin
(p=0.031) and platelet count (p=0.017).
VWF multimers were analyzed by gel analysis and categorized as large (>10 oligomers),
intermediate (6-10 oligomers), and small (1-5 oligomers). Gel analysis was successful in all
but one patient. In TTP large and ultralarge multimers accumulate in the microthrombi and
therefore show reduced concentrations in the circulation. 25% of the samples showed a
normal amount of large VWF multimers (80-100% of the control sample), 50% showed a
mild reduction (60-79% of the control sample), and in 25% they were severely reduced
(<60% of the control sample). Large multimers in COVID-19 patients were significantly lower
than in healthy pool samples (68.69±16.16% vs. 124.20±8.89%, p<0.0001). The Triplet
structure of the small multimers showed smear – an indicator of ADAMTS13 dysfunction – in
39% of the patients. There was a loss of largest multimers of 13-29% in COVID-19 and 1847% in TTP patients. Figure 4 presents a representative gel of a healthy control, three COVID19 patients with severe disease, and three patients with TTP. It illustrates the similarity of
plasmatic multimer composition in COVID-19 and TTP.

Discussion

In TTP the ratio of ADAMTS13/VWF:Ag is decreased below a critical level of 10. In this
situation the amount of ADAMTS13 does not suffice to avoid the generation of ultralarge
VWF multimers. The present study shows that this scenario occurs in the context of COVID19 as well. In TTP, the low ADAMTS13/VWF:Ag ratio results from an absolute deficiency of
ADAMTS13 with activity levels < 10%. In the vast majority of TTP patients, ADAMTS13
deficiency is acquired, e. g. by antibody formation, while in a minority, it is inherited known
as Upshaw–Schulman syndrome.20,21
We observed no single case of critical absolute deficiency of ADAMTS13. ADAMTS13 has
rarely been measured in COVID-19 before.11,15,16 In line with our findings, these isolated
publications do not report a critical deficiency of ADAMTS13 either. Whereas there is no
absolute deficiency, however, the massive production of VWF exceeds the processing
capacity of the protease leading to a relative deficiency of ADAMTS13. Thus, in 18.7% of the
study population the ADAMTS13/VWF:Ag ratio fell below the critical threshold of 10.
Endothelial damage is a consistent finding in autopsy series of patients with COVID-19. It is
supposedly mediated both by direct infection of endothelial cells, which express the ACE2
receptor, and secondary damage due to microvascular inflammation.22,23 Endothelial injury
may thereby constitute a crucial common trait in the multiorgan manifestations of COVID19. Endothelial activation is associated with an increased production of VWF, which likely
explains the massive upregulation in the present study population. To avoid formation of
ultralarge VWF multimers in states of endothelial damage with increased VWF generation,
there is an evolutionary preserved large reserve of ADAMTS13. Under physiological
conditions 10% of the available ADAMTS13 is sufficient to prevent formation of VWF
multimer. Our present findings show, however, that the massive increase of VWF in COVID-

19 exceeds the reserve of ADAMTS13. In this patient population VWF levels were elevated to
a mean of 4.03 iU/ml and were thus 4.8 times higher than the average VWF levels in the
healthy control group population. It may be speculated, that the ubiquitous endothelitis
causes the extraordinarily large increase in VWF plasma levels. The ADAMTS13/VWF:Ag ratio
is therefore a valuable biomarker to detect a critical relative deficiency of ADAMTS13.
Gel analyses support the hypothesis of an exceeded protease capacity of ADAMTS13: They
showed significantly reduced concentrations of large VWF multimers compared to healthy
subjects with almost 40% of the COVID-19 patients having the typical TTP pattern of smear
in triplet structure analysis of the small multimers. Figure 4 illustrates the similarity in
multimer composition of the two diseases despite the normal absolute concentrations of
ADAMTS13.
A pathophysiological role of relative ADAMTS13 deficiency is further supported by the
finding that the ADAMTS13/VWF:Ag ratio predicted mortality in the study cohort. With an
AUC of 0.232 in ROC analysis the ratio demonstrated a quite high predictive value for fatal
outcome. Interestingly, ADAMTS13/VWF:Ag continuously decreased with the level of COVID19 severity. Hence, the ratio is not only a predictor of mortality but also reflects the intensity
of morbidity. Moreover, a clinical relevance is supported by the significant association of the
ADAMTS13/VWF:Ag ratio with platelets and hemoglobin in regression analysis. Both
platelets and hemoglobin concentrations are reduced in TMA.
Based on the autopsy findings of multiple venous thromboses and thrombembolisms
plasmatic anticoagulation was recommended for COVID-19 patients.24 In the Hamburg study
population almost all patients who were treated in the ICU and died were autopsied.
Interestingly, the patients had multiple thromboses and thrombembolisms even though they
all had been treated with heparin or argatroban in therapeutic doses from the beginning of

their stay on ICU. These findings support the hypothesis that there must be an additional
pathogenic mechanism, which cannot be sufficiently addressed by plasmatic anticoagulation
therapies.
The present study identifies massive VWF release with relative deficiency of ADAMTS13 as a
candidate mechanism of TMA in COVID-19. Besides this mechanism, there is initial evidence
that complement activation may contribute to TMA as well. Complement activation has
been reported in mouse models of SARS.25 More importantly, histological studies of SARSCoV-2 pneumonitis revealed septal capillary luminal fibrin accumulation and accumulations
of terminal complement components C5b-9 and C4d in the microvessels, consistent with an
activation of the alternative complement pathway.4 Attempts to address complement
overactivation in COVID-19 with eculizumab are ongoing.
Our findings suggest two further therapeutic approaches. First, caplacizumab has recently
been approved for acquired TTP. Caplacizumab is an anti-VWF nanobody that inhibits the
interactions of ultralarge VWF multimers and platelets.26 Moreover, plasma exchange may
be a promising therapeutic approach for patients with COVID-19 and the laboratory
constellation of TMA. Plasma exchange eliminates excessive VWF, delivers ADAMTS13, and –
additionally – is able to reduce complement activation. There are already first case series, in
which plasma exchange was used in order to attenuate circulating cytokines and
inflammatory mediators in critically ill patients with COVID-19.27,28 In three patients treated
with plasma exchange, C-reactive protein and IL-6 levels decreased.27 In a cohort of 31
patients in Oman, 11 critically ill patients underwent plasma exchange. Plasma exchange was
associated with higher extubation rates, and lower 14 days and 28 days all-cause mortality.28
In line with our findings, these reports provide a rationale for the conductance of
prospective randomized trials, that are now under way.

Our study is limited by the cross-sectional assessment of VWF:Ag and ADAMTS13. Future
studies should address the dynamics of VWF and ADAMTS13 during COVID-19. Moreover,
the critical importance of the ADAMTS13/VWF:Ag ratio has to be confirmed in larger patient
cohorts.
Without therapeutic interventions, the mortality of patients with TMA is high. The present
study enlarges our understanding of the mechanisms underlying TMA in COVID-19. It
appears reasonable to include VWF:Ag and ADAMTS13 in the diagnostic workup of COVID19, at least in laboratory constellations of microangiopathic hemolysis. Until data from
prospective clinical trials on the use of plasma exchange in COVID-19 are available, clinical
decision for its use should be made in an individualized manner.

Figure 4:

Von Willebrand factor multimers in a medium resolution gel (1.8% LGT-agarose) of

(1) a normal person, (2-4) three patients with COVID-19, (5, 9) a normal plasma pool, and (68) three patients with acute TTP prior to initiation of treatment. The gel shows smear in the
patient lanes of both COVID-19 and TTP. There was a loss of largest multimers of 13-29% in
COVID-19 and 18-47% in TTP patients.
