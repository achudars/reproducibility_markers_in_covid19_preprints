ABSTRACT

Wastewater-based Epidemiological (WBE) surveillance offers a promising approach to
assess the pandemic situation covering pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic cases in
highly populated area under limited clinical tests. In the present study, we analysed
SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the influent wastewater samples (n = 43) from four wastewater
treatment plants (WWTPs) in Gandhinagar, India, during August 7 to September 30 ,
2020. A total of 40 samples out of 43 were found positive i.e. having at least two genes
of SARS-CoV-2. The average Ct values for S, N, and ORF 1ab genes were 32.66, 33.03,
and 33.95, respectively. Monthly variation depicted a substantial rise in the average
copies of N (~120%) and ORF 1ab (~38%) genes in the month of September as compared to August, while S-gene copies declined by 58% in September 2020. The SARSCoV-2 genome concentration was higher in the month of September (~924.5 copies/ L)
than August (~897.5 copies/ L), corresponding to a ~ 2.2-fold rise in the number of
confirmed cases during the study period. Further, the percentage change in genome
concentration level on a particular date was found in the lead of 1-2 weeks of time with
respect to the official confirmed cases registered based on clinical tests on a temporal
scale. The results profoundly unravel the potential of WBE surveillance to predict the
fluctuation of COVID-19 cases to provide an early warning. Our study explicitly suggests
that it is the need of hour that the wastewater surveillance must be included as an integral part of COVID-19 pandemic monitoring which can not only help the water authorities to identify the hotspots within a city but can provide up to 2 weeks of time lead for
better tuning the management interventions.

1. Introduction

The global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease has led to more than 40 million confirmed cases and >1 million deaths worldwide,
covering 216 countries, as of December 10 , 2020 (WHO, 2020). The high prevalence of
asymptomatic infectious persons is a matter of concern that raises doubt on the available data of active cases based on a clinical survey (Rimoldi et al., 2020; Medema et al.,
2020). Therefore, alternative approaches such as wastewater-based epidemiology
(WBE) are gaining recognition, and surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and realtime trend monitoring is being endorsed to trigger pandemic responses by scientific
communities (Medema et al., 2020; Randazzo et al., 2020). The SARS-CoV-2 virus replicates in epithelial cells of alveoli and enterocytes of the intestinal lining in human beings due to the expression of ACE2 receptor resulting in respiratory illness and gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhoea (Ni et al., 2020; Kumar et al., 2020;
Gupta et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020, Xiao et al., 2020). The clinical symptoms of SARSCoV-2 infection include cough, breathing problems, diarrhoea, and fever. Different studies suggest that 48 to 67% of deceased persons exhibited SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the stool
(Chan et al., 2020; Cheung et al., 2020; Parasa et al., 2020; Wong et al., 2020).
th

Due to the presence and extended excretion of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the faecal matter of
pre-symptomatic and deceased persons, WBE is gaining attention worldwide to monitor
COVID-19, particularly in the developing economies with poor health infrastructure. An
earlier investigation on COVID-19 patients revealed the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA
in the stool of a larger population (48.1 %) than patients with gastro-intestinal symptoms (17%) (Cheung et al., 2020). The latter study suggested that asymptomatic persons together with symptomatic persons, discharge viral particles in the excreta finding
their way to sewage treatment plants. Interestingly, 18-45% of patients lack symptoms
in the case of COVID-19 infection but are capable of transmitting the disease and can
adversely affect the actual containment of COVID-19 (Lavezzo et al., 2020; Yang et al.,
2020; Mizumoto et al., 2020; Nishiura et al., 2020). Haver and co-workers (2020) reported 6 to 24 times higher infection among asymptomatic and mild symptomatic indi3

viduals than confirmed cases at ten different sites in the United States based on surveillance of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.
The wastewater encompasses SARS-CoV-2 RNA from both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients; therefore, WBE may prove its worthiness for COVID-19 surveillance to
forecast the overall pandemic situation. WBE may help in identifying the hotspots and
tuning the public health initiatives that will give preparatory time to the regulatory bodies to handle the adverse situation. Further, WBE could provide an early warning of
possible re-outbreaks and seasonal outbreaks in the future. The occurrence of SARSCoV-2 RNA in wastewater has widely been reported from all corners of the world, including Spain, France, Italy, China, Netherlands, Australia, India, and Japan (Randazzo et
al., a,b; Wurtzer et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020; Medema et al., 2020; La Rosa et al., 2020;
Ahmed et al., 2020; Kumar et al., 2020, 2021; Honda et al., 2020). Though the sensitivity
of WBE is comparatively less than clinical trials and largely depends on the viral load in
the patient's faecal matter. Though, earlier clues and wide acceptability of WBE suggest
that this approach could be superior to clinical surveillance for the early prediction of
COVID-19 status for highly populated places. Some earlier studies showed the presence
of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater prior to the first documented report in the study area
(Medema et al., 2020; Randazzo et al., 2020; La Rosa et al., 2020). However, to evaluate
WBE's potential as an early prediction tool for COVID-19 pandemic, it is essential to explore the correlation between the SARS-CoV-2 genetic load in wastewater and the number of cases at the district level in each country.
In view of this, the objective of this study was to verify the WBE approach for COVID-19
by comparing the detected concentration of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater with the COVID19 cases reported by the clinical surveillance. The detected concentrations of SARS-CoV2 RNA in wastewater would reflect the true prevalence of COVID-19 infection in the
sewer catchment, including clinically undiagnosed patients, while the number of clinically reported cases covers only diagnosed patients and also depends on the number of
PCR diagnosis. In the present study, we analysed SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the influent
wastewater samples (n = 43) from four wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Gandhinagar, India, from August 7 to September 30 , 2020, with the following objectives:

hotspots and public health monitoring at the community level.
2. Material and Methods

2.1 Sampling approach

Influent wastewater samples were collected from four different treatment plants viz.
Basan, Jaspur, and Sargasan wards, and an academic institution present in the municipal
territory of Gandhinagar. The capacity of treatment plants was 2, 10, 10, and 2.36 MLD,
respectively. The details of the WWTPs, including their geospatial position, capacity,
treatment process, etc., are shown in
. The influent wastewater samples were
collected from each WWTP first biweekly, followed by weekly for two months, from August to September 2020. A total of forty-three influent wastewater samples collected
from four different treatment plants were analyzed for two months. All the samples
were collected by grab hand sampling using 250 ml sterile bottles (Tarsons, PP Autoclavable, Wide Mouth Bottle, Cat No. 582240, India). Simultaneously, blanks in the same
type of bottle were examined to know any contamination during the transport. In-situ
water quality parameters (pH, Electrical Conductivity, Dissolved Oxygen, OxidationReduction Potential, and Total Dissolved Solids, Salinity) were examined prior to the
sample collection using YSI Multiparameter probe and summarized in
. The
samples were kept cool in an ice-box until analysis.

30 mL samples were centrifuged at 4000×g (Model: Sorvall ST 40R, Thermo Scientific)
for 40 minutes in a 50 mL falcon tube followed by filtration of supernatant using 0.22micron syringe filter (Mixed cellulose esters syringe filter, Himedia). After filtrating 25
mL of the supernatant, it was treated with PEG 9000 (80 g/L), and NaCl (17.5 g/L) was
mixed in 25 ml filtrate, and this was incubated at 17°C, 100 rpm overnight (Model: IncuShaker™ 10LR, Benchmark). Next day, the mixture was centrifuged at 14000×g (Model:
Kubota 6500, Kubota Corporation) for about 90 minutes. The supernatant was dis5

carded after centrifugation, and the pellet was resuspended in 300µL RNase free water.
The concentrated sample was kept in 1.5ml eppendorf at -40 °C, and this was further
used as a sample for RNA isolation.
2.2.2 RNA isolation, RT-PCR and gene copy estimation

RNA isolation from the pellet with the concentrated virus was performed using NucleoSpin® RNA Virus (Macherey-Nagel GmbH & Co. KG, Germany) isolation kit. MS2 phage
was used as an internal control provided by TaqPathTM Covid-19 RT-PCR Kit. Some
other specifics are, a) the nucleic acid was extracted by TaqPathTM Covid-19 RT-PCR
Kit (Applied Biosystems), and Qubit 4 Fluorometer (Invitrogen) was used for RNA concentrations estimation, b) molecular process inhibition control (MPC) was evaluated
through MS2 phage for the QC/QA analyses of nucleic acid extraction and PCR inhibition
(Haramoto et al., 2018). We have described methodology elsewhere (Kumar et al., 2021
and 2020a). Briefly, steps were carried out as per the guideline provided with the product manual of Macherey-Nagel GmbH & Co. KG, and RNAs were detected using real-time
PCR (RT-PCR).
SARS-CoV-2 gene was detected with Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR
Instrument (version 2.19 software) and for each run a template of 7 µl of extracted RNA
was used with TaqPath™ 1 Step Multiplex Master Mix (Thermofischer Scientific, USA).
Final reaction mixture (20 µmL) contained nuclease-free water 9 (10.50 µL), Master Mix
(6.25 µL), and COVID-19 Real-Time PCR Assay Multiplex (1.25 µL). Positive control
(TaqPath™ COVID 19 Control), negative control (from extraction run spiked with MS2),
and no template control (NTC) were run with each batch. 40 cycles of amplification
were set and results were interpreted based on the Ct values for three target genes i.e.,
ORF1ab, N Protein, and S Protein of SARS-CoV-2 along with that of MS2 used as an internal control.
Results were considered inconclusive if less than two genes are detected in the samples.
Effective genome concentration was calculated semi-qualitatively using the equivalence
of 500 copies of SARS-CoV-2 genes as 26 Ct-value (provided with the kit), and multiplying the RNA amount used as a template and the enrichment factor of waste water samples during the experimentation.

Test of significance and multivariate analyses (MVA) was performed with help of Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS 21) to evaluate the relatedness among various quality parameters analysed and to delineate the governing variables in the produced data-set. The OriginPro 2019b was used for data plotting and analysis.
3. Results and discussions

We detected and quantified variation in SARS-CoV-2 RNA from influent wastewater
samples for two months (August and September) to understand the pandemic situation
in Gandhinagar, Gujarat, India. Among 43 samples analyzed in the study, 40 were found
positive, comprising two out of three target genes (
). The distribution analysis
of Ct values for different genes using boxplot is represented in
. The average Ct
values for S, N, and ORF 1ab genes were 32.66, 33.03, and 33.95, respectively. The Ct
values of internal control (MS2 bacteriophage) ranged between 25.15 to 28.01. Also, no
SARS-CoV-2 genes were detected in the negative control samples. The average gene
copies were found to be maximum for S-gene (~1223 copies/L), followed by N-gene
(~1022 copies/ L) and ORF 1 ab-gene (~485 copies/L)
.

3.1 The Monthly Variations

The monthly variation depicted a substantial rise in the average copies of N (~120%)
and ORF 1ab (~38%) genes in the month of September as compared to August, while Sgene copies declined by 58% in September 2020 (
). The SARS-CoV-2 genome
concentration was higher in the month of September (~924.5 copies/ L) than August
(~897.5 copies/ L), corresponding to a ~ 2.2-fold rise in the number of confirmed cases
during the study period (
). Temporal variations in average SARS-CoV-2 gene copies were analyzed from different WWTPs in Gandhinagar are displayed in

One-way ANOVA and Duncan post hoc test (
was performed to see the significance level in gene copy variation among different sampling dates. The results showed
significant differences in N-gene (ANOVA, F= 2.68, p <0.05) and S-gene copies (ANOVA,
F= 2.20, p <0.05) on the temporal scale (sampling dates). Conversely, differences were
non-significant in case of ORF-1ab genes (ANOVA, F= 1.13, p >0.05) and genome concentration (ANOVA, F= 1.63, p >0.05).

There are some studies available around the globe on early detection of SARS-CoV-2
RNA in wastewater, even before the first report of clinical diagnosis. For example,
Madema et al. (2020) reported the presence of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material in
wastewater in February, even before the official declaration of the first case in the
Netherlands. Likewise, La Rosa et al. (2020) reported SARS-CoV-2 genetic material in
wastewater samples before the first official documented report from two different cities
in Italy. Similarly, Randazzo et al. (2020) detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater samples from Spain. Since then, many researchers detected and reported the occurrence of
SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater samples and pondered its applicability for WBE surveillance (Ahmed et al., 2020, Kumar et al. 2020 a,b). However, a few studies available focused on assessing its potential on the temporal scale in relation to the changes in
COVID cases.
3.2 The Early Warning Capability

In this view, the present research work followed our first proof of the concept, where
we detected SARS-CoV-2 genetic material in wastewater and proposed its wide applicability for COVID surveillance in the community (Kumar et al. 2020a). Examining the potential of WBE for COVID-19 surveillance as a potential tool showed that the percentage
change in genome concentration level on a particular date was in conjunction with the
confirmed cases registered 1-2 weeks later on a temporal scale by the regulatory authority based on clinical tests ( ). For example, on August, 21 , 2020, a sharp decline of ~51% was noticed in the percentage change in the average genome concentration which was followed by ~0.76% decline in the percentage change in confirmed
COVID cases on August, 28 , 2020. Likewise, on August 25 , 2020, a steep hike of
~75% in the percentage change in the average genome concentration was noticed,
which was followed by ~11% increment in the percentage change in confirmed COVID
cases on September 7 , 2020. Therefore, we can predict the severity of the pandemic
situation 1-2 weeks prior to the official reports by the regulatory body based on clinical
tests. The results unravel the potential of WBE surveillance of COVID-19 as an early
warning tool displayed by the adequate presence of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material in
wastewater samples though limited cases were documented and based on the immediate future trends. These findings were in agreement with those of Ahmed et al. (2020b),
who noticed a longitudinal decline in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA with the tapering

Finally, MVA was performed to know the relation among influent wastewater physicochemical characteristics, SARS-CoV genetic material, and pandemic status (i.e., confirmed, active, recovered, and deceased cases) through principal component analysis
depicted by PCs loading in a 3-D domain during the entire two months of the monitoring period (

(Table S3),

(Table S4, Fig S1)

Principal component analyses show a comprehensive picture of the overall interaction
among SARS-CoV-2 genetic material and influent wastewater characteristics. The entire
dataset obtained for August and September were subjected to PCA and projected in the
3-D domain of three main PCs. In the month of August, four PCs were identified that explains 76.9% of the total variance in the dataset. The first PCs explained 26.9% of the
total variance with significant loading for COVID cases forming a cluster (confirmed, recovered, and active cases) with moderate loading (~0.5) of influent wastewater parameters (ORP and DO) and weak loading for ORF gene (
and Supplementary
and ). On the other hand, nearly the same (~23.8%) variation of data sets is explained by SARS-CoV-2 genes, and genome concentrations form a cluster upper left domain with significant loadings for effective genome concentrations (0.98) followed by
ORF-1ab, N-genes, and S-genes as PC2. Interestingly in August, the ORF 1ab genes illustrated positive loadings in both PC1 and PC2. The PC3 and PC4 exhibited almost similar
contribution (~13%) of the total variance.

In September, the complexion changed significantly with the overall reductions of PCs
to three, explaining cumulative variations of 84% in the dataset. The trends were almost
similar to the month of August. However, SARS-CoV-2 genes exhibited higher loadings.
Order of loadings among SARS-CoV-2 genes and genome remains same i.e., effective genome concentration> ORF-1ab> N-genes> S-genes. The confirmed and active COVID

cases showed a positive relationship with SARS-CoV-2 genes (ORF 1ab, N-gene, and genome concentration), though the relationship was not strong due to weak correlation
coefficients (<0.1). Though the results of MVA suggested a weak relationship between
the SARS-CoV-2 genome concentration and confirmed cases, yet the percentage change
in genome concentration showed a positive relation to the percentage change in the
confirmed cases. This might be because of the effect of change in SARS-CoV-2 genome
concentration was reflected in 1 to 2 weeks later data of the confirmed cases. This could
also partly be ascribed to the number of confirmed cases not necessarily reflect the actual prevalence of the disease (Hata et al. 2020).
4. Conclusion

A temporal variation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA presence in influent wastewater was studied
for a period of two months in Gandhinagar, India. Out of 43 samples, 40 samples were
found positive, while RT-PCR showed greater sensitivity for S-gene, followed by N-gene
and ORF 1ab gene. A comparison of monthly variation demonstrated higher SARS-CoV-2
genome concentration in September (~924.5 copies/ L) than August (~897.5 copies/ L)
in line with the ~2.2-fold rise in the number of confirmed cases during the study period.
The results profoundly unravel the potential of WBE surveillance to predict the fluctuation of COVID-19 cases to provide an early warning. Our study explicitly suggests that it
is the need of hour that the wastewater surveillance must be included as an integral
part of COVID-19 pandemic monitoring which can not only help the water authorities to
identify the hotspots within a city but can provide up to 2 weeks of time lead for better
tuning the management interventions.
