Meta-analysis of the clinical performance of commercial SARS-CoV-2
nucleic acid, antigen and antibody tests up to 22 August 2020

laboratories group

Abstract
We reviewed the clinical performance of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, viral antigen and antibody tests
based on 94739 test results from 157 published studies and 20205 new test results from 12 EU/EEA
Member States. Pooling the results and considering only results with 95% confidence interval width
≤5%, we found 4 nucleic acid tests, among which 1 point of care test, and 3 antibody tests with a
clinical sensitivity 95% for at least one target population (hospitalised, mild or asymptomatic, or
unknown). Analogously, 9 nucleic acid tests and 25 antibody tests, among which 12 point of care
tests, had a clinical specificity of 98%. Three antibody tests achieved both thresholds. Evidence for
nucleic acid and antigen point of care tests remains scarce at present, and sensitivity varied
substantially. Study heterogeneity was low for 8/14 (57.1%) sensitivity and 68/84 (81.0%) specificity
results with confidence interval width ≤5%, and lower for nucleic acid tests than antibody tests.
Manufacturer reported clinical performance was significantly higher than independently assessed in
11/32 (34.4%) and 4/34 (11.8%) cases for sensitivity and specificity respectively, indicating a need for
improvement in this area. Continuous monitoring of clinical performance within more clearly
defined target populations is needed.

Introduction
Testing is one of the central pillars of public health actions in epidemic and pandemic situations to
allow timely identification, contact tracing, and isolation of infectious cases to reduce the spread of
infectious diseases. In addition, it allows e.g. estimating disease incidence, disease prevalence, and
prevalence and duration of humoral immunity. Reliable testing for severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and timely reporting of the data to public health authorities is
therefore key for management of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This requires
appropriate and accurate diagnostic tests, with sufficient availability, for both identifying individuals
that are currently infected with SARS-CoV-2 as well as those that have been infected in the past.
Timely access to testing, sufficient supply of testing materials, availability of tests and related
reagents and consumables as well as high-throughput testing are pivotal in this context.
A large number of commercial tests for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (nucleic acid tests or NATs) or viral antigen
detection are currently available, as well as serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies. The
various types of tests can be used for different purposes and many of these tests have the CE-IVD
certificate that indicates compliance with the European in vitro diagnostics directive (98/79/EC) and
can thus be marketed within the EU/EEA countries. In addition, the US Food and Drug
Administration has granted emergency use authorisations for use of many commercial tests in the
US and the World Health Organisation maintains an emergency use listing of commercial tests.[1,2]
It is however important to note that the CE-marking is based on a self-declaration of the test
manufacturer, including the claims on performance of the test. Independent information on the
clinical performance of these tests in terms of sensitivity and specificity is still limited, and yet this is
critical for proper interpretation of results.
For this reason, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) launched a
continuous call to EU/EEA Member States and the UK on 1 April 2020 to provide any such clinical
performance data for sharing with other Member States. These data, provided by 12 Member
States, are presented in this paper. In addition, publicly available data were added. Finally, minimal
performance criteria for different intended uses were gathered from public sources and aided by a
survey conducted among EU/EEA member states and the UK from 20 May to 1 June 2020.

Methods
Search strategy and selection criteria
Studies containing potentially usable data on clinical performance of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid,
antigen and antibody tests were first extracted from systematic reviews on this topic. These reviews
were identified through an initial Pubmed (Medline) search for systematic reviews and meta-analysis
for ‘COVID-19’ and ‘SARS-CoV-2’, followed by snowballing using the ‘find similar articles’ feature. The
selection was then extended with the studies listed in the Foundation for Innovative Diagnostics
(FIND) database and the European Commission (EC) COVID-19 In Vitro Diagnostic Devices and Test
Methods Database. Both databases attempt to exhaustively identify peer-reviewed as well as grey
literature on clinical performance of COVID-19 tests and are continuously updated.[3,4] Results from
the latter were further filtered on those with a description indicating that they contain clinical
performance results. Results produced by United States Food and Drug Administration were also
included.[5] Finally, Pubmed was searched according to the query in supplementary Figure S1.

The resulting studies were subsequently assessed for eligibility. At present there are virtually no
clinical performance studies that can be judged as being at low risk of bias and low applicability
concerns, and systematic reviews up to this point have not used risk of bias or applicability concerns
as exclusion criteria.[6-9] This was not done in this work either. Instead, studies were excluded if
they did not contain data on commercial tests, or if one or more of the authors were employed by
the developer or manufacturer of the index test, to avoid possible conflicts of interest. Studies with
an ineligible design, such as blinded tests, analytical validation only, use of another threshold for
positivity than in the instructions for use, comparisons between different specimen types or use of
an antibody rather than nucleic acid test as reference test for any type of index test were
subsequently excluded as well.
Further exclusions were done at sample level based on the reference test employed. Samples
classified as actual negatives, i.e. used for determining specificity, had to either (i) be taken before
the COVID-19 outbreak, in practice before 2020, (ii) be taken from an individual without COVID-19
compatible symptoms, or (iii) be taken from an individual with COVID-19 compatible symptoms but
who was confirmed with another respiratory illness. Samples classified as actual negatives that were
taken during the outbreak and were negative according to a nucleic acid test were therefore
excluded. This was done to maximally reduce misclassification as actual negatives due to known
issues with sensitivity of nucleic acid tests. Such misclassified samples would artificially lower index
test specificity in particular when the index test is more sensitive than the reference test.[10-16] For
the same reason the reported sensitivity of nucleic acid or antigen index tests, based on a nucleic
acid reference test, was considered to be a positive agreement instead, calculated as part of a headto-head comparison between the two tests. For antibody index tests on the other hand, a nucleic
acid test was considered to be a valid reference test to determine actual positive samples and
sensitivity, in accordance with WHO interim guidelines.[17]
Manufacturer reported clinical sensitivity and specificity data were extracted from instructions for
use where available, or otherwise from the manufacturer’s website. Sensitivity results derived from
contrived samples spiked with purified viral RNA were excluded.
Original clinical performance data
Primary clinical performance data generated by the COVID-19 microbiological laboratories group’s
co-authors were assessed by ECDC according to the same criteria as those of the literature review.
Statistical analysis
Meta-analysis of the included clinical sensitivity and specificity results was performed per test and
per target, i.e. the genomic region for nucleic acid tests and the antibody isotype for antibody tests.
Antigen targets were not distinguished further. Antibody test sensitivity results below the threshold
days after onset were excluded. Sensitivity and positive agreement results were further stratified by
case population: hospitalised cases, mild or asymptomatic cases or unknown. Pooled sensitivity and
specificity values were calculated using fixed effects analysis, i.e. separately summing and dividing
the number of correct predictions by the total number of samples in the group. Wilson 95%
confidence intervals were calculated for pooled results. Study heterogeneity was assessed through
the I2 statistic, calculated through random effects analysis using R version 4.0.2 and the metafor
package.[18] I2 values <50.0% were considered low heterogeneity, 50.0-74.9% moderate and ≥75%
high heterogeneity.

Results
Minimum performance criteria
As of 1 June 2020, minimum performance criteria for tests were publicly available from Belgium,
France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom (supplementary Table S1). All were applicable
solely to antibody (Ab) tests. The intended uses included diagnosis of COVID-19, determination of
exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and determination of the immune status against SARS-CoV-2. Minimum
clinical sensitivity for all of the specified intended uses ranged from 85 to 98%, with a median of
95%. These thresholds applied to samples collected at least >14 days post onset of symptoms (dpo),
taking into account the time to seroconversion. Minimum clinical specificity for all of the specified
intended uses was 98% in six countries and 98.5% in one. For nucleic acid and antigen confirmatory
tests, the draft WHO Target Product Profiles for priority diagnostics to support response to the
COVID-19 pandemic state >95% - >98% sensitivity (acceptable/desired) and >99% specificity.[19]
General thresholds of >95% sensitivity and >98% specificity were used for further analysis, together
with a maximum 95% confidence interval (CI) width of ≤5%. For IgM only results, an upper limit of
≤28 dpo, or the highest dpo category having a lower limit ≤28 dpo, was added as well since IgM
antibodies decrease fairly rapidly and such tests are not intended to be used long after
exposure.[20]
Primary clinical performance data
Eight systematic reviews were identified, including one by health technology assessment bodies not
listed as a peer-reviewed study, and the primary studies included in the analysis extracted.[6-9,2124] The full list of studies in the FIND and EC databases was retrieved on 22 August 2020. Pubmed
was searched on the same date. From the EC database, 268 out 385 studies were screened out since
their description did not indicate that they would contain clinical performance data on commercial
tests. Analogously, 1520 out of 1738 studies were screened out from the Pubmed results. From the
combined list of 364 studies, 99 had no clinical performance data on commercial tests, 34 were
excluded due to a potential conflict of interest and 74 were excluded due to an ineligible design,
leaving a total 157 included studies. A complete overview of the study selection is given in Figure 1.
After exclusion of antibody test sensitivity results ≤14 dpo and ineligible specificity results, a total of
38202 and 56537 index test results remained for calculation of sensitivity and specificity,
respectively. After addition of original, previously unpublished results provided by the authors of this
study, this increased to 48310 and 66634 index test results, respectively, for 201 tests
(Supplementary Tables S2-S4).
Meta-analysis
Pooled estimates for clinical sensitivity and specificity per test, target and, for sensitivity, case
population were made as described in methods. For antibody tests, results were restricted to those
estimates that had a 95% CI width of ≤5% and were derived from at least two studies, to be able to
assess study heterogeneity. Based on the minimum performance criteria analysis, results above
95% sensitivity and/or 98% specificity for a particular population are highlighted (Table 1). Among
these results, there were two CLIAs, one ELISA and no LFIAs/POCs, that had 95% sensitivity.
Analogously, there were nine CLIAs, four ELISAs and twelve LFIAs/POCs, that had 98% specificity,
among which the three with 95% sensitivity. Study heterogeneity was low for 4/10 (40.0%)
sensitivity and 53/69 (76.8%) specificity results with CI width of ≤5%. There were few sensitivity
results for IgG for mild or asymptomatic cases, IgA and total antibody, none of which had a CI width
of ≤5% (Table 1). Compared to the same test used for hospitalised cases, drops in sensitivity were

observed of 7.4%, 11.0%, 13.1% and 19.2% for IgG, 28.8% for IgA and -6.0% for total antibody. The
latter negative value is likely due to low number of samples for both populations.
For nucleic acid tests that were not point of care (POC) tests, results were restricted as for antibody
tests (Table 2). Three tests had 95% positive agreement with a CI width of ≤5%, and nine had 98%
specificity. Study heterogeneity was low for all 4 sensitivity and all 15 specificity results with CI width
of ≤5%. Limited data were available for five POC antigen tests and five POC nucleic acid tests (Table
3). Large variability in positive agreement was observed. The best performing nucleic acid POC
achieved a positive agreement of 98.9% (97.3-99.6%), i.e. with a CI width of ≤5%. Virtually no data
were available on specificity, but no false positives were observed among them for either antigen or
nucleic acid POCs.
The correlation between independently assessed clinical performance results and manufacturer
reported results is shown in Figure 2. Only independently assessed results with CI width of ≤5% are
included. A total of 11/32 (34.4%) of sensitivity and 4/33 (12.1%) specificity results were significantly
different (p<0.05).

Discussion
This review represents, to our knowledge, the most complete independent overview so far of clinical
performance of commercially available COVID-19 tests. A substantial amount of previously
unpublished data from European countries are included as well. To date, there are numerous
commercial tests for which sufficient performance data are available to allow calculation of clinical
sensitivity or positive agreement, and specificity with narrow confidence interval ranges.
Reassuringly, the clinical performances of several nucleic acid and antibody tests exceeded the
minimum performance criteria. As time progresses, the list of tests with sufficient available
performance data is expected to increase.
At the same time, the available evidence for point of care nucleic acid and antigen tests remains
scarce, even though these tests can have substantial practical advantages for e.g. screening. We
therefore recommend more emphasis on the validation of these tests, including as part of a testing
algorithm, whereby the sensitivity and specificity of taking two tests with a number of days in
between is assessed, and which can e.g. be useful to reduce the duration of a quarantine period.
The comparison between the independently assessed clinical performance data and manufacturer
reported clinical performance revealed that in particular sensitivity is frequently (40.7% of the cases
in this study) significantly overestimated by the manufacturer. At a minimum, this emphasises that
such independent assessments are clearly necessary. In the longer term, an explicit and proactive
regulatory mechanism in Europe to compare available independently generated evidence on these
tests with manufacturer reported values, coupled with appropriate regulatory action, could be
useful. This could also be rewarding towards those manufacturers that do provide robust estimates
of their product’s performance.
Limitations of this paper include that most of the included studies have a substantial risk of bias in
the sample selection, especially for the sensitivity panel, as established also in the assessments
performed in the systematic reviews that were used as a source. Results were mainly based on
hospitalised cases or poorly defined populations, whereas the population of interest consists often
of symptomatic cases in general or even asymptomatic cases, and differences in performance may
exist depending on disease severity. While this review addresses a pressing need for actionable

clinical performance data, ideally, the clinical performance should be assessed through prospective
studies or clinical trials with a guaranteed unbiased sample selection for a clearly defined target
population and intended use of the test. Given the difficulty of assessing and extracting the data
from individual studies in a coherent way, we recommend that the Standard for Reporting of
Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (STARD) should also be followed when publishing the results.[25]
In this context, the selection of the reference test is particularly important with respect to reference
negative samples. As described in some of the assessed studies, it should be avoided that index test
results are considered as false positives while the samples are from actual cases and for this reason
we excluded nucleic acid negative samples from suspected COVID-19 patients altogether. We expect
therefore little bias in the specificity results, except potentially from under or overrepresentation of
confounders. This is especially relevant for seroprevalence studies, where, in the current lowprevalence situation, in particular the specificity of the test needs to be well-defined and high. On
the other hand, sensitivity results using a nucleic acid test as reference should be interpreted with
caution, since the positive samples may exclude some actual cases.
Possibilities to improve the reference test can include testing - potentially only the false positives with a second reference nucleic acid test preferably targeting different genes, testing more than one
sample from the same patient including for antibodies at a later time point, testing samples from
both upper and lower respiratory tracts, and sequencing the sample. The handling of intermediate
index test results is an issue that needs to be described in studies, and in general these should be
considered as positive results rather than either negatives or being excluded from the validation,
since they would normally require further follow-up to confirm the positivity of the sample.
For the above reasons, the authors and organisations contributing to this study in no way
recommend the use of the listed commercial tests over other not listed commercial or in-house
tests. Finally, it should be kept in mind that this study is a snapshot in time and that the clinical
performance of tests may change over time as the virus population evolves. We therefore
recommend a continuous monitoring of clinical performance both in Europe and globally, which is
key for reliable monitoring of the pandemic and which will also support vaccine and antiviral
development. These results should be shared in a timely manner publically
