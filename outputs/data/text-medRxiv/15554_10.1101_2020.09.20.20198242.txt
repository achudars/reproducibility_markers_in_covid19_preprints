Abstract
The crisis caused by COVID-19 revealed the global unpreparedness for handling
the impact of a pandemic. In this paper, we present a first quarter chronicle of COVID19 in Hubei China, Italy and Spain, specifically their infection speed, death and fatality rates. By fitting distributions to these rates, we look for the effectiveness of government measures during the pandemic through a number of statistical approaches.

Introduction

First reports of an outbreak of the (2019-nCov)-novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (NCIP) were identified in December 2019 in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province,
China. Initially identified as pneumonia of unknown origin, confirmed cases were
found to bear similarities to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARSCoV) of 2003 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) of 2012, with
the earliest instances of the virus linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in
Wuhan. Declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation on 11 March 2020,
the highly contagious virus rapidly became a global concern, now present in more
than 200 territories.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), coronaviruses (CoV) are a
large family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more
severe diseases such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The outbreak of SARS-CoV, Deng
and Peng [3], began in China in 2002 and was overcome by disease prevention and
control systems. MERS-CoV was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and has since
spread to several other countries. Although most coronavirus infections, Huang et al.
[5], Sohrabi et al. [10] and Zhu et al. [17], are not severe, more than 10,000 cumulative

cases have been associated with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in the past two decades,
with mortality rates of 10% and 37% respectively.
For governments, there are two possible strategies for handling an epidemic: a)
mitigation, focusing on slowing the epidemic without interrupting transmission completely, i.e. reducing the peak healthcare demand while protecting vulnerable groups,
and b) suppression, which aims to reverse epidemic growth through the reduction of
the number of cases to a minimal level. Mitigation involves isolating suspected cases,
quarantining the households of suspected cases and socially distancing the most vulnerable during the peak of the outbreak. While suppression measures include the social distancing of the entire population with the added possibility of school and university closures. Suppression, although successful to date in China1 and South Korea,
carries with it enormous social and economic costs which may significantly impact
the well-being of society in the short and long run. Hence, there is a trade-off between
minimising deaths from a pandemic and the economic impact of viral spread.
In this paper, we aim to provide a thorough discussion of the changing nature of
the COVID-19 pandemic during the first three to four months of outbreaks in Hubei,
Italy and Spain. All three regions adopted suppression strategies for mitigating the
risk of the pandemic, with severe lockdown restrictions governing the corresponding
populations. Considering infection speed, death rate and fatality ratio, we observe
potential implications of the implementation of government measures. We adopt
a data driven approach for the analysis, exploring probability distributions of daily
cross-sectional data in each of the three cases, in addition to presenting descriptive
statistics for the severity measures.
Distribution fitting provides further indication of how the significance of the outbreak changes throughout the observation period. In order to fit daily distributions,
we assume the daily rates for each city in a region or country to be independent of
the rates in all other cities and fit distributions to each day. Referring to Table 1, we
assume the independence of columns and fit distributions to every row. We then analyse the daily trend in parameters of the most common best fitting distribution, which
is fitted to all dates. The process is repeated for all three territories considered, using
the distribution fitting software Easyfit for the analysis.

During the initial stages of the pandemic, government measures were generally
standardised throughout each region under consideration. We therefore consider the

[10], China quickly entered a state of fighting against the new coronavirus based on their experience in the use
of suppression policies during the SARS-CoV epidemic. Individual behaviour has been crucial in controlling
the spread of COVID-19. As a result of the suppression measures taken by the government, on January 23rd 2020
Wuhan was quarantined and movement was restricted across Hubei province, affecting 50 million people. All
public transportation was sealed off within China while outside of China aviation restrictions were applied and
several countries initiated temperature and symptom screening protocols towards Chinese citizens. In Wuhan,
two new hospitals were built in two weeks in early February to treat coronavirus patients.

outbreaks in each of Hubei, Italy and Spain as single outbreaks, rather than analysing
the data at the more granular city level. However, as local lockdowns become more
common, with increases in the number of cases occurring in particular regions, analysis of the nature of the pandemic in the period after our observation may benefit
from the breaking down of regions into cities, so as not to temper the significance of
any local outbreak.
A number of limitations in regard to the data sets used for the observations in this
paper include issues with the timely reporting of deaths, testing capacities and rates
per region, reporting reliability and the non-uniform definition of COVID-19 deaths.
Our analysis however provides sufficient insight into the change in the severity of the
COVID-19 pandemic over time and the potential implications of lockdown measures.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we present the
methodology for the analysis, with particular focus on definition of the three severity
measures. Sections 3, 4 and 5 present the COVID-19 timeline, descriptive analysis
and distribution fitting for each of Hubei, Italy and Spain, respectively. We provide
the concluding remarks of the paper in Section 6.

Methodology

2.1 Three measures of severity
Throughout the paper, we use the notation CCt , CDt and CRt to denote the number
of cumulative confirmed cases, cumulative deaths and cumulative recovered cases
respectively at time t . Our analysis focuses on three variables, infection speed, death
rate and fatality ratio. The infection speed for a city at time t , v t , is defined by the
division of newly confirmed cases at time t (cumulative confirmed cases at time t − 1
subtracted from cumulative confirmed cases at time t ) by currently uninfected cases
at time t −1 (cumulative confirmed cases at time t −1 subtracted from total population
(TP)), such that
CCt − CCt −1
vt =
.
TP − CCt −1
The death rate for a city at time t , ∆t , is defined by the division of new deaths at
time t (cumulative deaths at time t − 1 subtracted from cumulative deaths at time
t ) by currently infected cases at time t − 1 (sum of cumulative deaths and recovered
cases at time t − 1 subtracted from cumulative confirmed cases at time t − 1), such
that
CDt − CDt −1
.
∆t =
CCt −1 − CDt −1 − CRt −1
Finally, the fatality rate for a city at time t , ψt , is defined by the division of cumulative deaths by cumulative confirmed cases at time t , such that
ψt =

CDt
.
CCt

We make two important assumptions. Firstly, daily updated population data is
unavailable, we therefore obtain Hubei population data from the Hubei Statistical
Yearbook 2019, published by the Hubei Provincial Bureau of Statistics [6]. Italian population data is taken from the Italian National Institute of Statistics [8] and Spanish

population data is from the Spain National Statistics Institute [11]. Secondly, we assume individuals who have recovered from the virus to be immune to future infection,
and so do not include recovered cases in calculation of the infection speed. The second assumption does not, in fact, significantly affect the analysis, since the number
of recovered cases is negligible in comparison to the total population.

2.2 Distribution fitting
Following definition of the infection speed, death rate and fatality ratio, daily rates for
each city in Hubei and each region in Italy and Spain were calculated. A total of 61 distributions were fitted to these rates on every day of the observation period. Based on
Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics, the best three performing distributions were identified for each day. The distribution most frequently outperforming all alternative distributions was selected to be fitted to all dates in the period. In this analysis, we aim
to provide an overview of trends in the nature of the pandemic in Hubei, Italy and
Spain, observing potential indications of the effectiveness of government measures.
Distribution fitting results for each of the three territories are presented alongside
descriptive statistics of the severity measures in Sections 3, 4 and 5, respectively.

Hubei, China

3.1 Timeline of events
We now present a timeline of COVID-19 events in Hubei, from 1 December 2019 to 26
April 2020.
Prior to the “whistleblowing" (1 December - 30 December)
With “patient zero" yet to be confirmed 2 , it was commonly agreed that the first COVID19 patient was identified at Jin Yin-tan Hospital, Wuhan, China, on 1 December 2019,
with no epidemiological link to later cases [5]. [9] declare that human-to-human
transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.
On 30 December, Wuhan ophthalmologist Dr. Li Wenliang, the whistleblower, sent
a message to fellow doctors in an online chat group disclosing the occurrence of 7
cases of SARS at the Wuhan Central Hospital, each connected to the Huanan Seafood
Wholesale Market 3 . The doctor provided a warning to colleagues to wear protective
clothing in order to avoid infection 4 . On the evening of 30 December, the Wuhan
Municipal Health Commission sent hard-copy messages to its affiliated institutions,

containing guidelines on confronting a possible outbreak of infectious pneumonia 5 .
Community transmission (31 December - 22 January)
On 31 December, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission released an online briefing regarding the pneumonia outbreak in the city 6 . Information reached the World
Health Organisation (WHO) through official channels the same day 7 . According to
the Chinese state-sponsored Xinhua News, the Huanan Seafood Market was closed
on 1 January 2020 for “remediation" 8 . On 9 January, the first death due to the virus
occurred in a 61-year-old man. Dying of heart failure and pneumonia, the individual
was a regular customer at the market with several significant medical conditions, including chronic liver disease 9 10 . On 11 January, the WHO published initial guidance
on travel advice, testing in laboratories and medical investigations. On 18 January,
the Wuhan City government held an annual banquet in the Baibuting community
to celebrate Chinese New Year, with forty thousand families in attendance sharing
meals, plates and eating together. On 20 January, following the infection of two medical staff in Guangdong, the China National Health Commission confirmed the virus
to be human-to-human transmissible 11 .
Lockdown and quarantine restrictions (23 January - 10 March)
At 2 am on 23 January, authorities issued a notice informing residents of Wuhan that
from 10 am, all public transport, including buses, railways, flights, and ferry services
would be suspended. Wuhan Airport, Wuhan railway station, and Wuhan Metro were
all closed. Residents of Wuhan were not allowed to leave the city without permission
from authorities. Travel quarantine in Wuhan delayed the overall epidemic progression by just 3 to 5 days in Mainland China, but had a more marked effect on an international scale, where case importations were reduced by nearly 80% until mid February [1]. A report published in The Lancet on 24 January indicated that individuals may
be symptom-free for several days while the coronavirus is incubating, increasing the
risk of contagious infection without forewarning signs [5]. On 24 January, travel restrictions enacted in 12 additional prefecture-level cities in Hubei meant that apart
from 2 prefecture-level districts, the entire Hubei province was under a city-by-city

quarantine. On 28 January Xiangyang was the final city in Hubei to become quarantined. On 2 February, Huoshenshan Hospital, an emergency specialty field hospital in Wuhan, was handed over to the People’s Liberation Army after 10 days’ construction undertaken since the first day of lockdown in the city. The hospital began
accepting patients the next day 12 . Applying the same design, a second field hospital, Leishenshan Hospital, opened on 8 February 13 . On 9 February, the death toll in
China surpassed that of the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic, with 811 deaths recorded. On
13 February, Hubei reported 14,840 newly confirmed cases, nearly 10 times more than
the previous day, while deaths more than doubled, reaching 242. This large increase
was due to a change in the definition of confirmed cases to include clinical diagnoses
of patients 14 . On the same day, the Chinese government issued an extension of order to shut down all non-essential companies, including manufacturing plants, and
all schools in Hubei province until 20 February, which was later further extended to
10 March.
Easing of lockdown (11 March - 7 April)
From 13 March, with the exception of Wuhan, cities in Hubei province gradually began to remove controls and permits on road traffic within their urban areas. China
reported no new locally transmitted infections for the first time since the pandemic
began. On 25 March, Hubei lifted the lockdown outside of Wuhan 15 and on 8 April,
Wuhan lifted its lockdown and resumed all methods of transportation 16 .
Normality (8 April -)
On 17 April, Wuhan revised its official death toll due to the coronavirus from 1,290
to 3,869; with local authorities citing incorrect reporting, delays, and omissions as
reasons for the change 17 18 . On 26 April, the National Health Commission reported
that all coronavirus patients in Wuhan had been discharged from the city’s hospitals

3.2 Data
The R package, nCov2019, developed by Yu [16], provides direct access to real-time
epidemiological data on the outbreak. There are two kinds of data available from this
package, real-time data and historical data. The real-time data, which contains current numbers of confirmed cases and deaths in geographical locations, are retrieved
using API (application programming interface) calls to the Tencent SARS-COV-2 website [12]. The Tencent website relies on the data obtained from the Chinese provincial
health agencies, the China National Health Commission (CNHC), the World Health
Organisation (WHO) and public health agencies in other countries.
The historical data provided by the package, which forms the basis of our analysis
for Hubei province, has three different sources. The first source is obtained directly
from the CNHC20 , the second source is a non-governmental organisation Dingxi19 “Spain daily coronavirus death toll lowest in weeks: Live updates”, Rasheed, Z. and Stepansky, J. and Allahoum, R., Al Jazeera, April 2020, https://web.archive.org/web/20200427041920/https://www.aljaze

angyuan 21 and the third is a public GitHub repository. 22 All three historical datasets
are updated daily and are almost consistent with one other [13]. We choose the third
source since it provides the earliest data.

FIGURE 1 Number of cumulative infected, recovered and dead in Hubei
The data offers a unique opportunity to study the novel coronavirus pathogen. In
Figure 1, we observe that the epidemic was controlled by the end of February, with
almost no new cases. After this point, an increase in the number of recoveries is seen
in Hubei. Our analysis particularly focuses on the historical data for the epicentre,
Hubei province. The raw data contains the number of cumulative confirmed cases,
cumulative recovered cases and cumulative deaths.

3.3 Descriptive analysis
Figure 2 shows the descriptive statistics for Hubei’s daily infection speed for the period 24 January - 17 March 2020, affected dramatically by the change in the way Chinese authorities accounted for confirmed cases as of 12 February. The mean and
standard deviation graphs (Figures 2a and 2b) show sudden jumps on the day of the
change, however values are fairly stable before and particularly after this point. Although the standard deviation experiences a slight increase and subsequent decrease
over the period (without consideration of the 12 February peak), values remain below
0.005 throughout. The median (Figure 2a) is much more robust to the outliers in the
data than the mean and is not largely affected by the significant jump in the number
of cases. Dates highlighted in the plots represent elements of the timeline of particular significance in regard to the severity of protective measures. Irrespective of the
jump on the change in definition, initially rising in value, the mean and median of
the infection speed begin to fall on 5 February, around the time two specialist field
21 Dingxiangyuan continuously aggregates data from provincial and city health agencies and the CNHC [4].
22 This GitHub repository [14] derives data from the literature Huang et al. [5] for December 1, 2019, to January

10, 2020, after which it relies on the Chinese news aggregator Toutiao API.

hospitals were opened in the region. This decrease also occurs approximately one
week after quarantine restrictions governed movement across all of Hubei and two
weeks after the imposition of lockdown restrictions in Wuhan, displaying the effectiveness of lockdown measures with respect to infection speed. Two weeks after the
opening of the first speciality hospital the infection speed begins a sharp decrease,
before becoming more stable and ultimately reaching zero. This decrease is reflected
in the standard deviation plot. Skewness and kurtosis values (Figures 2c and 2d) display similar patterns on different scales, both are mostly positive and consist of high
values, an indication of a heavy tailed and right skewed distribution. There are no
recorded deaths in Wuhan on 21 February which is reflected in the drop in skewness
and kurtosis values.

Displayed in Figure 3a, the mean and median daily death rate, investigated between 28 January and 17 March 2020, are fairly stable throughout the centre of the

to the right. Where the daily mean appears more stable between 14 February and 3
March, its average value is 0.0013, with both mean and median dropping to zero on
21 February as a result of the recording of no deaths on that day, almost two weeks
after the opening of the second speciality hospital. The obvious downward trend in
the mean plot after complete lockdown on 28 January shows the instant impact of the
government reaction to the outbreak. Figure 3b presents a low and stable standard
deviation, largely ranging from 0 to 0.005. Towards the end of the period, the mean
and standard deviation of the death rate fluctuate slightly in the upwards direction.
However, on all but two dates after 24 February (4 weeks after complete lockdown in
Hubei), the median is zero. On 11 March, we observe a spike in the two values. Only
4 (including Wuhan) of the 17 cities in Hubei had a non-zero death rate on this day,
suggesting the outbreak was under control in most cities at this point. Following the
beginning of the easing of restrictions in Hubei, a significant spike is seen in Figures
3a and 3b on the final date of the observation period. The spike however, corresponds
to a single death in Xianning, causing a deviation in their death rate from zero. The
reduced death rate present throughout the majority of the period mainly corresponds
to the decrease in the number of new infected cases and thus a decrease in the number of deaths in the region. Skewness (Figure 3c) mainly fluctuates between 0 and 3
despite taking a number of values both above and below this interval, whilst excess
kurtosis (Figure 3d) is again extremely volatile and always positive, indicating a heavy
tailed distribution for death rate time series data.

FIGURE 3 Descriptive statistics for Hubei’s death rate
Figure 4 presents graphs of the descriptive statistics for daily fatality ratios for the
period 25 January - 17 March 2020. As seen in Figure 4a, the mean and median of
daily fatality ratios are distant from one another during the early period of the outbreak, due to the recording of zero deaths in many cities. Mean and median values
become closer around the middle of February, indicating the existence of a lack of
outliers in the period under consideration, whilst also suggesting the distributions
of daily fatality ratios are not skewed significantly. The two statistics follow the same
trend after their intersection on 16 February, almost three weeks after lockdown restrictions governed all of Hubei. The average fatality rate falls slightly on the opening
of the first speciality hospital on 3 March, however gradually increases around the
time of the second hospital opening. During the latter half of the period of interest
the mean stabilises at approximately 3%. In Figure 4b, we observe that the values
of daily standard deviations are initially high, whilst concentrated at around 0.013
for the remainder of the period. The standard deviation of the fatality ratio experiences a significant decrease following its peak on 26 January, which appears to stabilise alongside the opening of the second speciality hospital. The decrease falls in

line with introduction of lockdown measures across the whole of Hubei on 28 January, with the minimum variation in the data observed on 15 February, almost three
weeks after lockdown was imposed. Taking positive values before 15 February and
negative values afterwards, the skewness of the fatality ratio (Figure 4c) indicates that
the data has different distributional structures, although skewness values are mostly
between -1 and 1. Daily excess kurtosis values (Figure 4d) are more volatile and experience a similar change around 15 February, presenting greater absolute values before
this point and relatively small positive and negative values afterwards. This change in
distributional structure indicated in Figures 4a, 4c and 4d occurs in the third week of
complete lockdown, perhaps reflecting the time at which mitigation measures substantially affected the fatality ratio in Hubei.

We consider infection speed as it reflects, in particular, government action in regard to the prevention of any further outbreak of the infection, through for example,
isolation measures, travel restrictions and the provision of face masks. As discussed
in Section 2.2, 61 distributions were fitted throughout period 24 January to 5 March.
Observing the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic for distributions fitted each day, we
select the generalised extreme value (GEV) distribution as the fitting distribution for
Hubei infection speed, and thus fit the GEV to all days in the observation period. The
probability density function of the GEV distribution is given by

k = 0,

where k is the shape parameter, σ the scale parameter (σ > 0) and µ the location parameter.
GEV parameters for infection speed are plotted in Figure 5. The shape parameter
k , displayed in Figure 5a, fluctuates throughout the period with an overall increasing trend between 0 and 1, stabilising slightly below 1 around 27 February, approximately one month after lockdown restrictions governed all of Hubei. The volatility
of the daily k values is more significant during the first half of the period, with the
reduction in the number of jumps with time suggesting some stabilising of the data.
Significant jumps in the value of k occur on 2, 12 and 20 February. The positive jump
on 12 February coincides with the change in the definition of confirmed cases, as in
the mean and standard deviation descriptive statistics plots (Figures 2a and 2b). Daily
parameters µ and σ (Figures 5b and 5c) both experience a sharp increasing and decreasing trend, before stabilising around 21 February. This increase and decrease is
also reflected in the descriptive statistics plots for infection speed (Figure 2). Although
both parameters behave in a volatile fashion, daily µ and σ parameters begin to decrease around 1 and 2 February, respectively, 4 and 5 days after lockdown restrictions
were in place across the whole of Hubei. This decrease occurs almost simultaneously
to the decrease in mean infection speed, displayed in Figure 2a. The change also coincides with the 2 February peak in the daily k values. On 18 February the minimum
and only negative value of µ occurs. Positive values of the shape parameter k in Figure
5a indicate a heavy tailed distribution for infection speed throughout the pandemic,
while the rapid convergence of the location and scale parameters to zero during the
second half of the period is consistent with the daily infection speed data, for which
values become smaller and approach zero in most cities. All three GEV parameter
plots are most stable during the period succeeding 21 February. The change in the
stability of the plots at this point in time is also observed in each of the descriptive
statistics time series. This therefore suggests that 24 days after quarantine restrictions
governed Hubei in entirety, the outbreak was controlled.

The Gumbel max distribution is the best fitting distribution for daily death rates,
outperforming on 28 out of 49 days for the period 28 January to 16 March 2020.

Daily values of the location parameter µ and scale parameter σ of the Gumbel
max distribution are plotted in Figure 6. The parameter µ has a slight decreasing
trend within the period, experiencing a number of spikes throughout. Values of µ
are mostly positive however an increasing number of negative results occur within
the final quarter. The minimum value of µ, recorded on 11 March, is -0.00236, significantly lower than all other parameter values. Three cities, in addition to Wuhan,
have non-zero death rates on this date. Two spikes of almost equal height occur in

the parameter σ both at the beginning and the end of the period. These spikes are
also visible in the mean and standard deviation descriptive statistics plots (Figures
3a and 3b), with the later peak coinciding with the minimum value of µ. Apart from
these two deviations, most values of σ fall between 0 and 0.005. A break in both plots
occurs on 21 February due to the recording of no deaths. Considering Figure 6b, we
observe an apparent stabilising of parameter values around the time of the opening
of the speciality hospitals and 10 days after the introduction of region wide lockdown,
at which time an immediate reduction in σ occurs. These trends are also displayed in
descriptive statistics plots for death rate in Hubei (Figure 3) and may present evidence
for the impact of government measures on reducing the death rate in the province.
Note that the stabilising of the death rate appears to occur earlier than that of the infection speed, perhaps due to improvements in the availability of medical treatment
and the experience of the medical profession in dealing with the outbreak over time.
Values of σ become more volatile however towards the end of the period, just before
the easing of restrictions.

Fatality ratio
For the final data set, we analyse daily fatality ratios for the 49-day period between
28 January and 16 March. Since fatality ratios are calculated through division of the
cumulative number of deaths by the cumulative number of confirmed cases, they
converge in line with the decreasing death rate and number of infected individuals.
The GEV distribution is selected as the best fitting distribution in this case, outperforming on 28 days of the period under consideration. The probability density function of the GEV distribution is given in Equation (3.1).
Parameter values plotted in Figure 7 generally follow an increasing or decreasing
trend throughout the observation period. Parameter k decreases from 0.54 to -0.89,
whilst µ increases from 0.0050 to 0.032. Fluctuating more than parameters k and µ,
the third parameter, σ, appears to stabilise around 22 February, in line with the distribution fitting for infection speed and two weeks after the opening of the second hospital. Occurring on 6 and 11 February, two σ spikes appear two weeks after the decla-

ration of lockdowns in Wuhan and Hubei, respectively. However, the jumps move in
opposite directions. Slight changes in the general trend across the period around 11
February are also seen in the descriptive statistics plots (Figure 4). Whilst the change
in µ is fairly consistent throughout the period, experiencing a slight increase in gradient on 6 February followed by a decrease around 21 February, the rate of change
of k is clearly split into two sections. Decreasing at a faster rate during the first three
weeks of the period (and the first three weeks of lockdown), the trend in daily k values changes around 18 February, with the decrease in k becoming more stable. The
change in all three parameters between 18 and 22 February (during the fourth week of
regional lockdown) provides further evidence to support suggestion that a change in
the severity of the outbreak occurred within this period, triggered by the government
measures.

Italy

4.1 Timeline of events
In this section, we present the timeline of COVID-19 events in Italy from 31 January
2020 to 25 May 2020.
First confirmed cases (31 January - 19 February)
On 31 January 2020, the first two cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in Rome 23 . The
Italian government suspended all flights to and from China and declared a state of
emergency with a duration of six months the same day 24 .
Clusters of cases in Northern Italy (20 February - 24 February)
The number of confirmed cases in Italy increased on 21 February, with sixteen people
in Lombardy and Veneto confirmed to be infected 25 . Following the first two deaths
of individuals with the virus, around 22 February, ten municipalities of the province
of Lodi in Lombardy and one in the province of Padua in Veneto were placed on lockdown due to the large number of infected cases in the region 26 27 . Lockdown restrictions were initially implemented until 6 March. While residents were permitted
to leave their homes, with supplies including food and medication allowed to enter,
public gatherings and attending schools or workplaces were prohibited 28 .
The spreading of the virus to other regions (25 February - 9 March)
After 25 February, cases emerged in several Italian regions without a clear link to the
Northern Italy clusters. On 4 March, the Italian government imposed a nationwide
two week shutdown of all schools and universities, as the country reached 100 deaths
due to the outbreak 29 30 . On the night of 7 March, Prime Minister Conte extended
the lockdown to cover the whole region of Lombardy and 14 other northern provinces

in Veneto, Emilia-Romagna, Piedmont and Marche, impacting more than 16 million
people 31 .
National lockdown (10 March - 3 May)
On 10 March, the Prime Minister again extended lockdown such that it governed all
of Italy, implementing travel restrictions and a complete ban on public gatherings 32 .
All restaurants and bars were closed from 11 March, nationwide. On 21 March, further restrictions were announced within the nationwide lockdown, halting all nonessential production, industry and business 33 . On 1 April, the government extended
the period of lockdown to 13 April 34 . On 8 April, all Italian ports were closed until
31 July as a result of a government decree 35 . On 10 April, lockdown was prolonged
until 3 May, as the reopening of a number of businesses including bookshops and
foresters was permitted 36 37 . Three weeks into lockdown, its impact began to show.
On 20 April 2020, Italy saw its first fall in the number of active cases 38 .
Easing of lockdown (4 May -)
On 26 April, the Prime Minister announced a starter plan for the so-called “phase 2",
that would begin on 4 May and allowed the re-opening of manufacturing industries
and construction sites. From 18 May most businesses were able to reopen, and free
movement was granted to all citizens within their region; movement across regions
was still prohibited for non-essential reasons. On 25 May, swimming pools and gyms
reopened, and on 15 June theatres and cinemas followed 39 .

4.2 Data
The Italian Department of Civil Protection uploads daily Italian regional COVID-19
data on GitHub [7]. This data set includes daily information regarding the cumulative number of confirmed cases, cumulative deaths, cumulative recovered cases and
newly infected cases, in addition to a number of other statistics which are not incorporated in this project. Data in the repository documents the information for each
region in Italy from 24 February 2020 to date (at the time of writing).

FIGURE 8 Number of cumulative infected, recovered and dead in Italy
In Figure 8, we observe the slowing down of the epidemic around the middle of
April, where the number of active cases reaches its peak, potentially as a result of
lockdown measures. For the remainder of the observation period, an increase in the
number of recoveries is observed.

4.3 Descriptive analysis
Descriptive statistics for Italian infection speed data are displayed in Figure 9 for the
period 25 February – 15 June 2020. Again, the skewness (Figure 9c) and kurtosis (Figure 9d) follow similar patterns but on different scales with their peaks coinciding. Almost all values of skewness and kurtosis are positive and greater than 1 for the duration of the period, supporting selection of a heavy tailed distribution for infection
speed. The mean infection speed (Figure 9a) peaks on 28 March, just over two weeks
after the beginning of the nationwide lockdown and one week after the halting of
non-essential business, decreasing in general after this point. The subsequent decreasing trend provides indication of the effectiveness of the lockdown measures in
reducing the infection speed. Between 15 March and 20 April, the mean infection
speed is highly volatile, with the rate of change of infection speed greatest between
10 March and 21 March. The median (Figure 9a) follows a similar pattern to the mean
however is generally lower and more volatile, indicating a slight right skewness in the
daily infection speed distributions. The standard deviation of infection speed (Figure
9b) is volatile during the same period before peaking on 18 April, at which time the
occurrence of a spike is observed in the mean but with less significance. The measure
stabilises towards the end of the period in line with both the mean and the median
and the easing of the outbreak.

FIGURE 9 Descriptive statistics for Italian infection speed
Descriptive statistics for Italian death rate data for the period 25 February – 15 June
2020 are displayed in Figure 10. Considering first the mean and median of the data in
Figure 10a, the mean death rate peaks on 19 March, around two weeks after the closing of all schools and universities across the country on 4 March, the date of the first
significant jump in death rate. The mean data also experiences a later peak on 6 June,
coinciding with the easing of the lockdown restrictions. The first fall in the number
of cases was recorded on 20 April however by this point the mean death rate is more
controlled and decreasing with time. Values of the mean and median differ initially
due to the recording of zero deaths in many regions at the beginning of the outbreak.
After the median jump on 12 March, the mean and median coincide, indicating that
daily death rate distributions are not significantly skewed. Considering the standard
deviation of the death rate displayed in Figure 10b, the most significant peak occurs
on 4 March, with a second peak on 6 June. The standard deviation is less volatile than
the mean and appears fairly stable between 7 April and 28 May, fluctuating around
0.0025. Although kurtosis (Figure 10d) is the more volatile measure for daily death
rates, skewness (Figure 10c) and kurtosis behave similarly across the period with dif-

fering scales, experiencing an initial decrease before rising around the time of the first
drop in the number of cases. Both skewness and kurtosis are mostly positive, with the
majority of skewness values fluctuating between 0 and 3 and only 6 skewness values
falling below zero across the whole period. The high values of skewness and kurtosis
indicate the appropriateness of a heavy tailed distribution for Italian death rate data.

FIGURE 10 Descriptive statistics for Italian death rate
Figure 11 shows the descriptive statistics for Italian fatality ratio for the period
25 February – 15 June 2020. The mean fatality ratio (Figure 11a) increases steadily
throughout. A slight bump in the data occurs before the first lockdown on 7 March,
after which the mean increases steeply until around 7 April, almost one month after the declaration of nationwide lockdown, when the rate of increase begins to slow.
Both mean and median (Figure 11a) remain fairly steady after this point. Following a
slight jump on 11 March after exiting the period of mostly zero death recordings, the
median follows the same pattern as the mean however is generally lower, suggesting
the data is slightly skewed to the right. The standard deviation of the fatality ratio (Figure 11b) also appears to stabilise around 12 April, becoming steady around a value of

0.03 in the latter third of the period as the virus starts to become more under control and restrictions are eased. The first jump in the standard deviation occurs on 5
March and the peak is on 9 April, with the measure behaving volatilely between these
points. Figures 11c and 11d highlight the stabilising of skewness and kurtosis over
time although initially volatile, particularly in the kurtosis case. While after 8 March
kurtosis largely fluctuates between -1 and 1, between 8 March and 25 March, kurtosis
values are mostly negative. Data for all other dates before 8 June are associated with
positive kurtosis. Skewness is positive throughout the period, remaining below one
in most cases after 9 March. The change in skewness and kurtosis values around this
point in time and their continued decrease suggests the structure of distributions for
the daily data differs within the period, moving from highly skewed and heavy tailed
to almost symmetric. The fatality rate data for each region stabilises around 20 May, at
which point the lockdown measures had eased significantly. This cannot be observed
in the death rate and infection speed data.

4.4 Distribution fitting
Infection speed
After fitting various distributions for the period 25 February - 15 June, we select
the generalised Pareto distribution as the best fitting distribution for Italian infection
speed data, outperforming on 74 days of the 112 day period. The probability density
function of the generalised Pareto distribution is given by

where k is the shape parameter, σ the scale parameter (σ > 0) and µ the location parameter. The domain over which the distribution is defined is

for k < 0.
k

Time series plots of infection speed parameters are shown in Figure 12. The parameter k is the most volatile throughout the period, varying from -0.52 to 0.81. However, the majority of the time series plot lies in the positive portion of the graph. Approximately two weeks after the declaration of nationwide lockdown on 10 March,
daily k values begin to increase, after decreasing throughout the initial part of the observation period. Almost three weeks after the first easing of restrictions on 4 May,
k experiences a negative spike, although the overall trend continues to increase. The
parameter µ starts to fluctuate in line with the beginning of nationwide lockdown and
stabilises as lockdown is lifted on 3 May, behaving as a process mean-reverting about
zero and peaking on 28 March. The third parameter of the generalised Pareto distribution, σ, follows a similar pattern to both k and µ, volatile at the beginning of the
lockdown and experiencing a sharp increase, with peak on 25 March, two weeks after the declaration, before falling after this point with decreasing volatility. The consistent pattern in each of the three plots suggests lockdown measures in Italy took
around two weeks for an obvious impact on infection speed to be observed. The clarity of the period of highest severity in the three parameter plots (particularly µ and σ)
is parallel to that of the mean, median and standard deviation descriptive statistics
plots in Figures 9a and 9b. This highlights the significance of government measures
in the controlling of infection speed in Italy.

Death rate
The Johnson SB (JSB) distribution outperforms for death rate on 46 days of the 105
day period between 3 March and 15 June, and is therefore chosen as the best fitting
distribution. The density function is given by

where γ and δ are shape parameters (δ > 0), λ is the scale parameter (λ > 0) and ξ the
location parameter. The domain over which the distribution is defined is ξ ≤ x ≤ ξ+λ.
Plots of the four parameters of the JSB distribution are shown in Figure 13. In
general, all parameters are volatile throughout the whole period. The daily γ values
largely fluctuate between 0 and 2, with a sudden spike of 11.29 occurring on 19 April,
the day before the first fall in the number of active cases was confirmed and almost
six weeks after the beginning of nationwide lockdown. The parameter δ moves be-

tween 0 and 2.5 with the exception of 19 April, in line with the γ peak. The δ parameter values, although extremely volatile, appear to behave in a gradually increasing
then decreasing fashion. The maximum daily λ value also occurs on 19 April, largely
remaining between 0 and 0.05 after this point. Generally fluctuating within a small
interval, the parameter ξ has a range of 0.012. The volatility in this parameter is particularly large between 10 March and 4 May, the period during which lockdown restrictions were most severe. We observe the greatest volatility in ξ at the centre of this
lockdown period, with extremely volatile rates occurring towards the end of March,
three weeks after the imposition of lockdown and around the time of its first extension. This volatility suggests that at the point of its extension, the outbreak in Italy was
not under control. The stabilising of all parameters towards the end of this period may
display the effectiveness of the prolonged sustaining of restriction measures.
All four plots in Figure 13 include a number of breaks, these breaks correspond
to dates for which the JSB distribution provided no fit to the data. Of particular significance are the consecutive breaks between 18 April and 27 April, with just 4 dates
fitting to the JSB distribution within this period. This fitting failure occurs around
the time the first fall in cases was observed, implying there was a clear change in the
death rate at this point of the outbreak in Italy. This cannot be observed when simply
considering the associated descriptive statistics plots in Figure 10.

Fatality ratio
The Johnson SB distribution again dominates for Italian fatality ratio data, as it
outperforms on 33 days out of the 105 day period between 3 March and 15 June.
Plots in Figure 14 display the time series for all four JSB parameters throughout the
investigation period. We observe that parameters γ, δ and λ have similar trajectories,
with their peaks occurring simultaneously on 1 June, at which time Italy was within
phases 2 and 3 of the easing of lockdown restrictions. The trajectory for ξ however, is a
reflection of the other three parameters, with its minimum occurring on 1 June. There
therefore appears to be a definite change in the fatality ratio data on this date, with
the reversal of the general trend in all four cases. Whilst γ, δ and λ are mostly positive,
ξ is mostly negative. A spike in all four plots occurs on 26 March, approximately two
weeks after the declaration of nationwide lockdown. Change on this date is observed
only slightly in the descriptive statistics plots (Figure 11), with no noteworthy peak.
All plots in Figure 14 stabilise around 1 April, the day of the lockdown extension, until
approximately 23 April, at which point the trend changes, with a sharp increasing (or
decreasing in the ξ case) trend, before reaching the 1 June peak. Although a clear

February, the death of a 69-year-old man who had travelled from Nepal was recorded
as the first death.
Community transmission (26 February – 12 March)
On 26 February, the first reported case in the region of Andalusia was confirmed in
Seville, becoming the first recognised case of community transmission in Spain. On 7
March, Haro was the first town to be put on lockdown, due to a high concentration of
cases 42 . On 10 March the Government of Spain decreed the immediate cancellation
of all direct flights from Italy to Spain until 25 March 43 .
State of emergency (13 March – 27 March)
On 13 March, the Prime Minister of Spain declared a 15 day nationwide state of alarm
(the lowest level of a state of emergency), to become effective the following day after approval by the Council of Ministers 44 . On 14 March, the Spanish government
imposed the nationwide lockdown, banning all trips that did not qualify as force majeure 45 46 . A state of emergency was declared the next day and the imposition of a
national lockdown beginning 15 March announced as part of emergency measures to
combat the coronavirus outbreak in the country 47 48 . Individuals were permitted to
leave their homes only for valid reasons, including shopping, visiting vulnerable relatives, attending medical appointments and travelling to work for key workers only.
On 16 March, the Minister of the Interior Grande-Marlaska announced the closing of

On 28 April, the government announced a plan for easing lockdown restrictions which
consisted of four phases. Phase 0 allowed citizens to leave their homes for short walks

and territories comprising about half of the Spanish population 53 , and included the
opening of small shops, in addition to terraces and places of worship, at half and onethird capacity, respectively. Phase 2 began on 18 May in a number of Balearic Islands;
simultaneously, the remainder of Andalusia and the Valencian Community, alongside
some territories in Castile and León and in Catalonia progressed to phase 1. As of 25

5.2 Data
Since 26 February 2020, the Coordination Center for Health Alerts and Emergencies
(CCASE), a body of the Spanish Ministry of Health, has published a daily COVID-19 report for Spain [2]. The report contains daily information on the cumulative number of
confirmed cases, cumulative recovered cases, cumulative deaths, and newly infected
cases for each region in Spain from 25 February 2020 to 14 April 2020. After 15 April,
the Coordination Center began to present the number of cumulative confirmed cases
such that it consists of two parts, positive cases detected by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test and positive cases detected through an antibody test 58 . Since the
group of individuals with a positive antibody test may have been infected a number of
days earlier, we decided to use the positive cases detected with PCR in order to represent the cumulative confirmed cases. The Coordination Center for Health Alerts and
Emergencies no longer provided the number of recoveries as of 17 May. In the Spanish case, we consider only infection speed and fatality ratio due to the termination
of death rate data announcements per region and hence the occurrence of missing
regional data, with only complete national death rate data available.
Figure 15 shows the dynamic evolution of cumulative deaths, cumulative recoveries and active cases in Spain up to 14 April 2020.

FIGURE 15 Number of cumulative infected, recovered and dead in Spain

5.3 Descriptive analysis
Figure 16 shows the descriptive statistics for Spanish daily infection speed for the period 24 February - 16 May 2020. The mean infection speed (Figure 16a) experiences a
smooth and rapid increase during the first month of the observation period, peaking
on 26 March, around two weeks after the beginning of nationwide lockdown. After
reaching its peak, the mean infection speed begins to decrease volatilely to a level
of around 0.002 on 30 April, 35 days after the peak. After this point there is no obvious decreasing trend, however the mean infection speed continues to fluctuate for
the remainder of the period. The median (Figure 16a) follows a similar pattern to the
mean however is generally lower, again indicating a slight right skewness in daily infection speed distributions. The standard deviation of infection speed (Figure 16b)
behaves similarly to the mean and median, however is more volatile than both statistics throughout the period. Skewness (Figure 16c) and kurtosis (Figure 16d) follow
similar patterns with their peaks coinciding. Both values are almost always larger
than 1 before March 26, the date with greatest mean and standard deviation values.
After this point, skewness and kurtosis begin to fluctuate about 1, with a sudden peak
on 10 May due to a 10 fold increase in the number of new infected cases in Catalonia
that day. Skewness fluctuates between 0 and 4, however for the majority of the period
fluctuation between 0 and 2.5 is observed, whilst kurtosis values are almost always
positive. Selection of a heavy tailed distribution for infection speed is therefore appropriate in the Spanish case. The apparent change in all four plots on 26 March
coincides with the banning of all non-essential activities two days later. The obvious decrease in the mean infection speed after this point supports suggestion of the
positive effect of this outbreak control measure on the infection speed in Spain.

FIGURE 16 Descriptive statistics for Spanish infection speed
Descriptive statistics for the Spanish fatality ratio are shown in Figure 17 for the
interval 8 March - 16 May 2020. Fluctuating for a short period until 20 March, almost
one week after the declaration of the nationwide state of emergency and the beginning of lockdown, the mean and median fatality ratio (Figure 17a) begin to increase
steadily after this point, stabilising at the beginning of May, approximately six weeks
later. The median surpasses the mean on 18 April and remains slightly higher for
the remainder of the period. This indicates that the fatality ratio distribution is right
skewed until mid April and slightly left skewed afterwards. This distribution change
is also observed in Figure 17c, where skewness becomes negative on 10 April. The
clear change in distribution approximately one month after the announcement of nationwide lockdown, may highlight the period of delay between imposition and effect.
Skewness and kurtosis (Figure 17d) experience perturbations in March despite following a clear downwards trend. Both skewness and kurtosis become stable around
the middle of April, with values close to zero. This suggests a symmetric distribution is appropriate for this period. The standard deviation of the fatality ratio (Figure 17b) experiences a significant drop at the very beginning of the observation pe-

Infection speed
The generalised Pareto distribution is selected as the best fitting distribution for
Spanish infection speed over the period 26 February - 16 May. This distribution outperforms over all 60 alternative distributions on 52 days of the 82 day period. The
probability density function of the generalised Pareto distribution is given in Equation (4.1).
Parameter values for the generalised Pareto distribution for Spanish infection speed
are plotted in Figure 18. The parameter k is largely positive between 26 February (the
date of the first community transmission) and 19 March (four days after nationwide

lockdown), before fluctuating with some severity around zero for the remainder of
the period. A final peak in the value of k is observed on 10 May, one day after the
ending of the state of emergency and as discussed in relation to Figure 16, the day of
the increase in Catalonian cases. This 10 May peak is however only visible in k . The
parameter falls back to a value close to zero after this date. For the first 10 days of observation µ is stable, the parameter then behaves extremely volatilely throughout the
first month of lockdown. Continuing with fluctuations after this point, µ gradually
becomes increasingly stable and approaches zero from below. The third parameter,
σ, increases rapidly during the first month of the observation period, and after reaching its peak on 25 March, three days before the banning of all non-essential activities,
becomes very volatile and follows a downward trend. With a change in all three parameters observed on 25 March, we observe indications of the effectiveness of lockdown measures after ten days. This observation is paralleled in the infection speed
time series’ in Figures 16a and 16b, which peak on 26 March.

Fatality ratio
After fitting distributions throughout the period 11 March - 16 May, we find the
Cauchy distribution to outperform on 30 of 67 days, and so select this distribution as
the best fitting distribution. The probability density function of the Cauchy distribution is given by
µ µ
³ x − µ ´2 ¶¶−1
f (x) = σπ 1 +
,
σ

where µ is the location parameter and σ is the scale parameter (σ > 0).
Daily values of the two parameters of the Cauchy distribution for fatality ratio are
plotted in Figure 19. The parameter µ increases steadily throughout the period. The
time series for µ is smooth particularly after 29 March, however only minor fluctuations occur prior to this date. Values rise from 0.0059 to 0.10 across the period and
reflect the mean and median of the Spanish fatality ratio data. Since µ becomes stable
after crossing 0.1, it is possible to assume the fatality ratio would not change significantly in the future, in the event there was no second wave of the outbreak. The slowing of the rate of change of the fatality ratio parameter µ appears to begin one month
into the observation period, on 11 April. This date is approximately one month after the declaration of nationwide lockdown and two weeks after the banning of all
non-essential activities. The second parameter, σ, again follows an increasing trend
however is unstable until 20 April, after which point the volatility in the daily parameter values decreases. The timing of the changes in both parameter values suggests a
stabilising of the fatality ratio as a result of lockdown measures which takes approximately one month to come into effect. The largest changes in the σ time series appear
to coincide with the highlighted dates, which are those of greatest significance in regard to the implementation of government measures, inferring the sensitivity of the
distribution to certain changes in the outbreak environment. Changes in the µ and σ
plots on 11 and 20 April, respectively, fall in line with the change in distribution implied by the mean, median and skewness plots in Figure 17. However, the parameter
change is much less significant.

Concluding remarks

The previous three sections provide detailed overviews of the changing severity of
the COVID-19 outbreak in Hubei, Italy and Spain, presenting evidence for the significance of certain government measures and particularly lockdown restrictions through
observation of their death rate, infection speed and fatality ratio. Infection status is
generally more certain in comparison to determining an individual’s cause of death,
particularly with the varying methods for counting COVID-19 fatalities. The accuracy
of all three severity measures however, relies upon the sufficient testing of the populations under consideration.
As of 17 September 2020, 215 countries, areas and territories had reported cases of
COVID-19. In particular, the WHO reported 29,737,453 cases worldwide, with 937,391
deaths. The steady decline in the number of infected cases as of mid-February observed in China, the first reporting site of the novel coronavirus, may be attributable
to extreme measures taken by the government in order to contain the virus, with the
majority of new cases imported from abroad by mid July and only occasional cases
of domestic transmission. At this time, new daily cases were reported to be approximately 200 and 700 in Italy and Spain, respectively, a significant reduction in comparison to the equivalent values in March and April.
The analysis presented in this paper supports suggestion that the imposition of
lockdown has a positive effect on all three severity measures considered. In general,
the mean, median and standard deviation of the infection speed and death rate in
each of the three territories experience an increasing and decreasing trend (with varying severity) which aligns with the period of lockdown. Death rate decreases and stabilisation reflect improvements in medical treatments in addition to better management of COVID-19 infections. Whilst a decreasing average is intuitive when considering lockdown to be a positive measure, a decline in the standard deviation reflects the
evening out of the prevalence and severity of the infection across regions within each
territory. This increased spread alleviates pressure on medical demand and government support during the outbreak. Considering for example the case in Italy, a high
number of infections in the Northern region at the beginning of the outbreak induced
a high standard deviation of the death rate, with the majority of Italy reporting no infections at this point in time. As the outbreak spread throughout the country, the
variance in both infection speed and death rate stabilised. Occurring simultaneously
to the stabilisation of the mean and median, this suggests the outbreak was becoming
increasingly controlled.
Discussion of descriptive statistics and the distribution fitting analysis provides
an understanding of the pandemic environment during the first quarter of its outbreak. Although we cannot draw firm conclusions in regard to the timeliness of lockdown measures, and in particular, the impact of a shift in the period of lockdown on
the severity of the outbreak, due to the available data and the chosen approach, the
positive effect of the introduction of lockdown on stabilising infection speed, death
rate and fatality ratio is clear in all three cases. This paper provides thorough documentation of the initial stages of the pandemic in Hubei, Italy and Spain, creating a
reference for the manner in which disease spread changes in relation to government
measures, in the event of the occurrence of any outbreak of a similar nature in the
future.
