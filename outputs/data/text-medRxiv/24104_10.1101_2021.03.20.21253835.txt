Abstract
Using genomic epidemiology, we investigated the arrival of SARS-CoV-2 to Québec, the
Canadian province most impacted by COVID-19, with >280,000 positive cases and >10,000
deaths in a population of 8.5 million as of March 1st, 2021. We report 2,921 high-quality SARSCoV-2 genomes in the context of >12,000 publicly available genomes sampled globally over the
first pandemic wave (up to June 1st, 2020). By combining phylogenetic and phylodynamic
analyses with epidemiological data, we quantify the number of introduction events into Québec,
identify their origins, and characterize the spatio-temporal spread of the virus. Conservatively, we
estimated at least 500 independent introduction events, the majority of which happened from
spring break until two weeks after the Canadian border closed for non-essential travel.
Subsequent mass repatriations did not generate large transmission lineages (>50 cases), likely
due to mandatory quarantine measures in place at the time. Consistent with common spring break
and ‘snowbird’ destinations, most of the introductions were inferred to have originated from
Europe via the Americas. Fewer than 100 viral introductions arrived during spring break, of which
5-10 led to the largest transmission lineages of the first wave (accounting for 36-58% of all
sequenced infections). These successful viral transmission lineages dispersed widely across the
province, consistent with founder effects and superspreading dynamics. Transmission lineage
size was greatly reduced after March 11th, when a quarantine order for returning travelers was
enacted. While this suggests the effectiveness of early public health measures, the biggest
transmission lineages had already been ignited prior to this order. Combined, our results reinforce
how, in the absence of tight travel restrictions or quarantine measures, fewer than 100 viral
introductions in a week can ensure the establishment of extended transmission chains.

Introduction

50

Over a year into the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, whole-genome sequencing combined with

51

phylogenetic analysis has emerged as an essential tool to track the local and global spread and

52

evolution of the virus (Martin, VanInsberghe, and Koelle 2021; du Plessis et al. 2021). While the

53

pandemic is global by definition, regional instances of viral introductions and spread provide

54

‘natural experiments’ to gain insights into general patterns. For example, Russia, Scotland and

55

Massachusetts all experienced dozens to a few hundred independent introduction events of the

56

virus from different locations (Komissarov et al. 2021; da Silva Filipe et al. 2021; Lemieux et al.

57

2021). The phylogenetic analysis of Massachusetts in particular found that most introduced

58

viruses went extinct, while a minority of introductions were highly successful, consistent with

59

superspreading dynamics (Lemieux et al. 2021). Phylogenetic analysis can also identify cryptic

60

transmission chains unidentified by contact tracing or travel history (Bedford et al. 2020; Worobey

61

et al. 2020). More recently, evidence has accumulated that transmissibility can be increased by

62

adaptive mutations in the viral genome, such as amino acid change D614G in the spike protein

63

(Volz et al. 2021; Zhou et al. 2021), or combinations of mutations, as in the B.1.1.7 lineage that

64

emerged in Southeast England in September 2020 and is now the predominant lineage in the

65

United Kingdom (Davies et al. 2021). The interplay between adaptive evolution, such as beneficial

66

mutations, and stochastic factors, such as founder effects and superspreading, remains to be fully

67

explored, and additional case studies are instructive to distinguish region-specific from

68

generalizable features of the pandemic.

69
70

The province of Québec (QC) was the epicenter of the first wave in Canada of the SARS-CoV-2

71

pandemic (defined here up to June 1st, 2020). It is the second most populous province, with about

72

half of its 8.5 million inhabitants in the densely populated Montréal metropolitan area. By June 1st,

73

2020, 5,210 people in Québec had died of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), of whom 70%

74

were residents of long-term care facilities. When the first cases were reported in China and

75

Europe, the Public Health Laboratory of Québec (LSPQ) developed a qPCR diagnostic test

76

targeting SARS-CoV-2 E and N genes (LeBlanc et al. 2020). The first case of COVID-19 in

77

Québec was detected on February 25th, 2020. Shortly after, Québec was the first large Canadian

78

province to start its spring school holiday (“spring break;” February 29th to March 9th, 2020; Fig.

79

1A). It is believed that international travellers returning from spring break had a large impact on

80

the epidemic (Godin et al. 2021). The number of cases increased exponentially during March

81

2020 (Fig. 1A; “Données COVID-19 Au Québec,” 2021). On March 13th, a public health

82

emergency was declared, with schools, daycares and most other public spaces closed on March

83

16th (“lockdown”). The closure of the Canadian border to non-essential travel was also announced

84

March 16th and officially closed the night of the 17th, except for returning Canadian citizens who

85

continued to enter the country after repatriation calls from the government. On March 20th, Québec

86

reached the threshold of 100 cases per day and by March 28th random road checks were set up

87

to discourage movement between regions within Québec and between neighbouring provinces

88

(i.e., movement between Gatineau, Québec, bordering Ottawa, Ontario, was restricted). In April

89

2020, the virus spread significantly in long-term care facilities overwhelming many of them, thus

90

requiring redeployment of health care workers and by April 20th the Canadian Armed Forces sent

91

personnel to the Montréal region to help. Having flattened the epidemic curve and with cases

92

declining, public health measures began easing mid-May (Fig.1A). A year later, as of March 1st,

93

2021, Québec had suffered the highest death toll in Canada (over 10,000 dead) and among the

94

highest death rates in the world (~92 deaths per 100,000).

95
96

In April 2020, we assembled the Coronavirus Sequencing in Québec (CoVSeQ) consortium of

97

academic and government scientists (https://covseq.ca/) to sequence SARS-CoV-2 genomes in

98

Québec. The CoVSeQ consortium is part of the Canadian COVID Genomic Network

99

(CanCOGeN), a pan-Canadian cross-agency network for large-scale SARS-CoV-2 and human

100

host sequencing (https://www.genomecanada.ca/en/cancogen). To better understand the early

101

introductions and spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Québec during the first wave, we sequenced and

102

analyzed 2,921 high-quality consensus genome sequences obtained between mid-February and

103

June 1st, 2020. We studied how these Québec sequences were related to 12,801 genomes

104

sampled from elsewhere in Canada and internationally. We inferred geographical origins of

105

introduction events by comparing travel history data with phylogenetic inference, and estimated

106

their likely arrival dates and subsequent spread. We conservatively estimated >500 independent

107

introduction events, mainly involving viral lineages of European origin, of which the most

108

successful arrived during the spring break period. Similarly to Massachusetts (Lemieux et al.

109

2021), viral transmission was overdispersed and suggestive of superspreading, with most

110

lineages going extinct and only 5-10 introduction events giving rise to 50 or more cases.

111

Consistent with founder effects and the effectiveness of public health measures, earlier

112

introductions tended to give rise to more subsequent infections.

Sampling and sequencing the first wave in Québec

117

Our province-wide sequencing effort covers the first pandemic wave up to June 1st, 2020, with a

118

focus on the earliest confirmed cases up to April 1st (Fig. 1A). Consensus sequences of SARS-

119

CoV-2 viral genomes were obtained by targeted amplification from clinical nasopharyngeal swabs

120

specimens followed by sequencing on Nanopore (n=180), Illumina (n=2630) or MGI (n=111)

121

platforms. Only sequences passing quality criteria (less than 5% undetermined bases, “Ns”) were

122

considered for further phylogenetic analyses (Methods; Table S1). With these genome

123

sequences we covered 5.7% of the total number of reported cases (45,641 laboratory confirmed

124

cases and 5,849 suspected cases) up to and including June 1st. To capture early introduction

125

events, our sequencing effort was highest (covering 27% of cases) before April 1st, two weeks

126

after the Canadian border closed and most repatriation of Canadian citizens from abroad had

127

occurred. Until early April, the mean age of sequenced cases was approximately 50 years old,

128

then jumped to ~75 years old, likely reflecting that the virus had entered long-term care facilities

129

(Fig. 1B). By April 1st, over 500 long-term care facilities had reported at least one case of COVID-

130

19, and the virus spread steadily through these primarily elderly populations during the month of

131

April (Shingler 2020).

132
133

Inferred SARS-CoV-2 introductions to Québec are mostly of European origin

134

Before federally mandated quarantine orders for returning travelers were put in place on March

135

25th, 1,544 travelers who entered Québec had tested positive with COVID-19 (Godin et al. 2021).

136

However, not all these cases were necessarily independent introduction events, nor would they

137

all give rise to successful onward transmission of SARS-CoV-2. To complement and refine the

138

identification of introduction events, we compared self-reported travel history provided by COVID-

139

19 positive cases with a phylogenetic inference of Québec and global context sequences (n =

140

15,722 viral genomes in total). Following previous phylogenetic studies of SARS-CoV-2 (du

141

Plessis et al. 2021; Lemieux et al. 2021), we used ancestral state reconstruction (ASR) to identify

142

non-Québec to Québec transition nodes in the phylogeny (Methods). In this way, we inferred a

143

total of 555 (based on parsimony ASR) to 614 independent introduction events (based on

144

maximum likelihood ASR, to which we refer below unless otherwise indicated). In our preliminary

145

study of 734 Québec sequences up to April 1st, we estimated only 247 introduction events

146

(“Genomic Epidemiology of Early Introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into the Canadian Province of

147

Québec” 2020), suggesting that introductions are underestimated and are likely to increase with

148

sample size. We defined Québec transmission lineages as descendants of a unique introduction

149

event in the phylogeny, and then annotated these based upon Pangolin and Nextstrain lineage

150

nomenclatures. Note that Pangolin or Nextstrain are viral phylogenetic lineages used for

151

taxonomic purposes, which are distinct from Québec transmission lineages, which we define at

152

higher phylogenetic resolution as descendants of a single introduction event, and thus represent

153

a partially observed transmission chain.

165

We calculated Tajima’s D as a simple non-parametric metric of viral effective population size (Kim,

166

Omori, and Ito 2017) and found strongly negative values of D early in the epidemic, consistent

167

with exponential growth in mid-March to early April, followed by decelerating growth as public

168

health measures likely reduced viral transmission (Fig. 1C). The decline of Tajima’s D from March

169

5 to 19th coincides with, or slightly precedes the increase in the epidemic curve starting on March

170

19th, suggesting its utility as an early indicator of population expansion. For example, viral lineage

171

B.1, which originated in Italy and spread throughout Europe, showed evidence of rapid growth in

172

Québec (median D ~ –2.5 in mid-March) followed by a decline in late April and May. This is

173

consistent with our observation that B.1 became very common in Québec by April before being

174

replaced by other B.1 variants (notably B.1.147 and B.1.350) by the end of May (Fig. S1).

175
176

Of the 2,921 Québec consensus sequences analyzed here, 328 were from COVID-19 cases that

177

had reported recent travel history. Note that a lack of travel history could indicate a true lack of

178

travel, or a lack of available data. Travelers reported returning from the Caribbean and Latin

179

America (n = 105, 32%, mainly from Mexico, n = 31, 9.5% and the Dominican Republic, n = 30,

180

9%), Europe (n = 104, 32% with the most from France, n = 39, 12% and Spain, n = 20, 6%), and

181

the USA (n = 77, 24%) (Fig. 2A). There was very little reported travel from Asia (n = 4, 1.2%) and

182

none from China. Only 153-162 phylogenetically inferred introduction events (25-28%; range

183

across parsimony or ML methods) were associated with travel history. These events were broadly

184

concordant with travel history, with some exceptions: notably, Latin America and Europe were

185

approximately equally popular destinations based on travel history, but phylogenetic analysis

186

identified Europe as the more likely origin of introductions into Québec (Fig. 2A,B). This is

187

consistent with European viral lineages arriving in Québec, perhaps via the Americas – but before

188

accumulating lineage-defining mutations in the Americas. The early introductions of viral lineages

189

A and B.4, common in the early outbreaks in China and Iran respectively, appear not to have

190

been successful in Québec and were not observed by mid-May (Fig. S1).

208

The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Québec was detected on February 25th, but phylogenetic

analysis has the potential to infer earlier introduction events. We inferred 13-16 potential

210

introduction events before February 25th, based on their time to the most recent common ancestor

211

(TMRCA), of which only 4-5 had reported travel history. The global phylogeny during the first two

212

months of 2020 is undersampled, due to sequencing efforts only beginning to ramp up at that

213

time. This, combined with relatively slow accumulation of mutations by SARS-CoV-2, resulted in

214

many large polytomies (unresolved branchings), making precise inference of introductions

215

challenging. Indeed, ten of these 14-16 early introductions are in polytomies and 53-63% are of

216

unclear origin; thus their true TMRCA is questionable (Fig. 2C). The earliest reliably dated

217

introduction has a TMRCA of February 15th, from Europe (clustering with sequences from

218

Switzerland), followed by an introduction from the UK with a TRMCA of February 21st. We do not

219

reliably detect any introductions arriving in January or early February, which is consistent with a

220

study of samples from patients with flu-like symptoms between November 2019 to early March

221

that did not find any SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that introductions before late February are unlikely

222

(as reported in Le Devoir, September 5th, 2020; “L’épidémie a Commencé Autour de La Relâche

223

Scolaire,” 2020) and appear not to have given rise to sustained transmission.

224
225

Most introductions occurred after spring break

226

To test the hypothesis that spring break travel was a major source of viral introductions into

227

Québec, we investigated the Québec transmission lineages with a TMRCA between Feb. 23rd

228

and March 10th and defined them as having been likely introduced during spring break. During

229

this period, there were 70-96 introduction events (only 12-16% of the total), of which 26-36 had

230

recorded travel history (~37%). This is a conservative estimate since people may have traveled

231

just before or after those precise dates. Also, given the SARS-CoV-2 generation time and

232

incubation period, some introductions during spring break are expected to appear in the counted

233

cases past March 16th. The majority of introductions, then, happened after spring break, with 78-

234

82% of TMRCA dates after March 10th (Fig. 2C). The USA is a common travel destination for

235

Québecers, where many (known as ‘snowbirds’) have winter homes. The bulk of the USA travel-

236

related cases were detected after the border closed on March 16th, and thus were likely part of

237

the repatriation effort. However, the phylogenetically inferred introductions from the USA suggest

238

that these were not as successful as the introductions that happened in early March (the only

239

transmission lineages with >20 viral genomes of US origin arrived before March 15th, Fig. 2C).

240

The majority of the 41 introductions from other Canadian provinces were not reported in travel

241

history records (38-39 introductions, 93-95%), which is consistent with inter-provincial travel

242

having been common until being discouraged in late March.

transmission lineages of less than ten sampled genomes. In contrast, only 5-10 introductions (0.9-

257

more than 50 cases in Québec (Fig. 3). The ten introductions inferred by ML events gave rise to

258

1,414 genomes, or 48% of all sequenced cases (range: 5-10 introductions giving rise to 36-58%

259

of all sequenced genomes in the first wave) until June 1st. This overdispersion is more extreme

260

but qualitatively similar to a UK study where the eight largest introductions resulted in >25% of

261

cases (du Plessis et al. 2021). This highly overdispersed transmission lineage size distribution

262

(Fig. 4A) is also similar to what was observed in Massachusetts (Lemieux et al. 2021). These

263

results are consistent with an overdispersed reproductive number and superspreading, in which

264

most potential transmission events are unsuccessful but a minority give rise to dozens or

265

hundreds of subsequent infections.

Larger transmission lineages tended to be sampled across more regions in Québec (Fig. 4B),

268

indicating that the success of these lineages was not due to local outbreaks but rather to wide

269

geographic spread across the province. The viral lineages that spread the most throughout

270

Québec (i.e. being found in more than ten health regions) were B.1, B.1.5, and B.1.147 (Fig. S2).

271

Viral lineage B.1.147 stayed mostly in the more populous southern regions of the province while

272

genomes of B.1 were found in almost all regions (Fig. S2 and Fig. S3). Viral lineage B.1.5 first

273

arrived after spring break and was introduced 41 times across Québec but was not successful at

274

generating transmission lineages of over 12 sampled genomes, and was no longer observed by

275

June 1st (Fig. S1 and Fig. S2). In contrast, B.1.147 was introduced half as many times (19

276

introductions) but these events tended to have occurred earlier in spring break (Fig. S1).

277
278

The most successful Québec transmission lineages were caused by B.1.147, B.1.350, B.1.3, and

279

B.1, each of which was introduced multiple times (Fig. 4C, Fig. S3, and Fig. S4). These viral

280

lineages had evolutionary rates comparable to other lineages in Québec (~6x10-4 substitutions

281

per site per year; Fig. S5), somewhat slower but in the range estimated from other studies

282

(Duchene et al. 2020). To quantify variation in the strength of natural selection on these lineages,

283

we calculated the nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution ratio (dN/dS) between all pairs of

284

genomes within a viral lineage (Fig. 4D). There was a modest positive correlation between a viral

285

lineage’s dN/dS and its average transmission lineage size (Pearson’s R2 = 0.12, permutation test

286

P = 0.0002). Much of this correlation is driven by lineage B.1.147 (Fig. 4C,D) and could be

287

explained by the accumulation of low-frequency, slightly deleterious nonsynonymous mutations

288

at the tips of a rapidly expanding clade (Rocha et al. 2006; Charlesworth and Eyre-Walker 2008),

289

which is also consistent with strongly negative Tajima’s D values (Fig. 1C). Together, these

290

results suggest rapid population growth of the most successful lineages.

301

The ten largest transmission lineages likely arrived during spring break (all TMRCA 95% HPD

302

intervals overlap with spring break) and were still detectable in late May (Fig. 5). The median

303

effective reproductive numbers (Re, estimated by phylodynamic analysis) for the two largest

304

transmission lineages were estimated in the range of 2-3, consistent with exponential growth (Fig.

305

5). The two transmission lineages of ~60 cases caused by introductions of B.1 and B.1.3 had

306

higher Re values, potentially due to their rapid spread in long-term care facilities. The B.1

307

transmission lineage that spread mostly in a care facility in the city of Laval (McKenzie 2020), is

308

a particularly striking example, where the median age jumped to 83 years old (IQR: 71 to 89

309

years) after a likely introduction by a person in their forties (Fig. S6). This outbreak was brought

310

under control, and then no sequences were detected past early May (Fig. 5; Fig. S6). The self-

311

isolation mandates for arriving travelers (Québec’s orders on March 11th and federal mandatory

312

quarantine orders on March 25th) appear to have been effective, such that the mean transmission

313

lineage size before March 11th was 22 cases (+/- 85 SD) and only 3 cases (+/- 5.1 SD) after March

314

11th. After the federal quarantine orders, 70% of introductions were singletons and only four gave

315

rise to 10 or more sampled genomes. The TMRCA of the last introduction event was April 16th,

316

2020.

Mutation and founder effects on transmission lineage size

327

Finally, we considered the extent to which the success of an introduction event could be explained

328

by founder effects and adaptive mutations. To investigate the role of specific mutations, we

329

defined nine lineage-specific single nucleotide variants (alleles) present in all members of each

330

viral lineage, and tested their associations with transmission lineage size. We found that mutation

331

D614G in the Spike protein (genome position A23403G) was present in all ten of the most

332

successful introduction events into Québec (Fig. S7) and generally dominated our sampled

333

sequences (Fig. 6A). Independent introductions of viral lineages with the derived G allele gave

334

rise to a mean transmission lineage size of 6.6 cases, compared to 3.4 for the ancestral D allele;

335

however, this difference is not statistically significant (Fig. S7). In contrast, derived

336

nonsynonymous mutations in three consecutive nucleotide sites (28881-3) spanning two codons

337

in the nucleocapsid (N) protein were significantly associated with smaller transmission lineage

338

size (Fig. S7) and were less represented in our sequences (Fig. 6A).

339
340

If founder effects also played a role in determining successful transmission, we would expect the

341

earliest introduction events to give rise to larger transmission lineages. Consistent with founder

342

effects, we observed a significant negative correlation between inferred arrival time and

343

transmission lineage size. This negative correlation was strongest before quarantine measures

344

began on March 11th, suggesting that that founder effects occurred independently and could be

345

decoupled from the effects of quarantine measures (Fig. 6B). The negative correlation was

346

detectable but weak after March 11th, suggesting a strong effect of quarantine measures. We

347

also note that most of the early, successful introduction events had no reported travel history,

348

highlighting the importance of phylogenetic analysis in identifying them. Therefore, while we

349

cannot exclude a role of specific mutations affecting transmission, lineage success in Québec’s

350

first pandemic wave can most parsimoniously be explained by a combination of founder effects

351

and effective public health measures.

Conclusions

364

Québec is unique among Canadian provinces for its early spring break, which resulted in many

365

returning travelers before border closures and quarantine measures were enacted. Our results

366

are consistent with mathematical modelling results (Godin et al. 2021) suggesting that Québec’s

367

large and severe SARS-CoV-2 epidemic was driven by this early spring break. Even if most

368

introduction events likely occurred well after spring break, those that arrived during or just after

369

spring break generated the largest transmission lineages. Before quarantine and other public

370

health measures were in place, ten introductions that arrived during spring break gave rise to

371

hundreds of subsequent infections and spread widely across Québec. While hundreds of

372

introduction events continued to occur after spring break, these spread much less widely, likely

373

due to effective public health measures. This scenario closely mirrors the early SARS-CoV-2

374

introductions into the UK, which also spread widely and proved hard to eliminate (du Plessis et

375

al. 2021).

376
377

Our phylogenetic analysis is generally concordant with self-reported travel history, but also

378

revealed a large number of introduced European SARS-CoV-2 viral lineages that were not

379

apparent from travel history. Québec is, thus, similar to other East Coast North American

380

epidemics, such as Boston (Lemieux et al. 2021) and New York (Gonzalez-Reiche et al. 2020),

381

that were primarily seeded by European lineages, in contrast to more Asian lineages on the West

382

Coast (Worobey et al. 2020). The Québec sequences broadly clustered across the global

383

phylogenetic tree, representing most of the known diversity, with an under-representation of early-

384

branching Asian lineages. Like other phylogenetic studies, ours is limited by sampling: we cannot

385

reliably detect introduction events from countries poorly represented in public databases, nor have

386

we sequenced all SARS-CoV-2 infections in Québec. We were able to sequence ~6% of positive

387

cases, putting our effort nearly on par with other leading genomic surveillance projects (e.g.

388

currently ~8% in the UK; https://www.cogconsortium.uk/). Nevertheless, our estimate of at least

389

500 independent introduction events is almost certainly an underestimate. This highlights the

390

need for sustained genomic surveillance efforts.

391
392

Although it is notoriously difficult to disentangle demographic factors from fitness effects of viral

393

mutations (Grubaugh, Hanage, and Rasmussen 2020), our results are consistent with a mild (not

394

statistically significant) transmission advantage of the D614G Spike mutation, as observed

395

elsewhere (Volz et al. 2021). We also identified three adjacent derived mutations in the N protein

396

associated with smaller transmission lineage size. These mutations (nucleotide positions 28881-

397

28883) have been reported before, but their functional significance remains unclear (Garvin et al.

398

2020) and could warrant further study. While these mutations may have played some role in

affecting transmission in Québec, the differential success of introduced lineages is parsimoniously

400

explained by founder effects, such that the first lineages that arrived tended to be successful. The

401

recent success of lineage B.1.1.7, which spread in the UK and elsewhere despite competition

402

from previously established lineages, cannot be easily explained by founder effects (Davies et al.

403

2021). Nevertheless, founder effects and other demographic factors must be carefully considered

404

when inferring a transmission advantage of viral lineage of interest.

405
406

Consistent with superspreading dynamics, we observed an overdispersed distribution of

407

introduced transmission lineage size: most introduction events went extinct, while only 5-10

408

introductions (<2%) gave rise to at least one third of sequenced cases. Viral lineages that were

409

introduced after the self-isolation mandate for travellers were largely unsuccessful at generating

410

large transmission lineages, despite repeated introductions into Québec. Although our province-

411

wide sampling was not designed to focus on specific outbreaks, they are reflected in our dataset.

412

For example, one introduction of viral lineage B.1 during spring break quickly spread from younger

413

to older individuals in a long-term care facility. This example mirrors the broader trajectory of the

414

Québec epidemic in the first pandemic wave. Our study demonstrates the importance of timely

415

public health actions during the early phases of a pandemic and how they shape the dynamics,

416

size, and geographical spread of a novel pathogen.

Methods
Sampling and sequencing
COVID-19 positives cases were selected from all nasopharyngeal swabs sent to the Public Health
Laboratory of Québec (Laboratoire de Santé Public du Québec, LSPQ) from the beginning of the
pandemic until June 1st, 2020. To protect patient confidentiality, in the publicly released data the
first accurate date of sampling is set to March 10th, 2020. All samples taken before that are set
to March 1st, and their real sampling dates are between February 25th and March 9th, 2020. The
true sampling dates were used in phylogenetic analyses described below.
Total nucleic acid extraction was performed with the NucliSENS EASYMAG automated platform
on 200 μL of nasopharyngeal swabs. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 was assessed by a qPCR
diagnostic test targeting genes E and N (LeBlanc et al. 2020). Targeted SARS-CoV-2
amplification, library preparation, and sequencing were performed at the McGill Genome Centre
as follows. Briefly, RNA samples were processed in a 96-well plate format, including positive and
negative controls on each plate. A targeted amplification strategy was used based on the ARTIC
V3 primer scheme (https://github.com/artic-network/artic-ncov2019) using the V3 primers only
without adding the redundant V1 primers. For primer pairs 5, 17, 23, 26, 66, 70, 74, 91, 97, and
64, for which a lower coverage was observed, a separate additional low amplification (LA1) pool
was prepared to increase the number of reads in the corresponding region. For post-PCR
cleanup, pools 1 and 2 were combined, while pool LA1 was cleaned up separately, quantified,
and added to the combined pools 1+2 in equimolar concentration. Samples from plates 1-4 were
prepared for Nanopore sequencing as described : https://www.protocols.io/view/sars-cov-2mcgill-nanopore-sequencing-protocol-sup-bjajkicn. For Nanopore sequencing, we used native
barcodes on pooled amplicons and loaded 20-40 ng of library onto the flow cell. Samples from
plates 5-8 were prepared for Nextera Flex Illumina sequencing as described:
https://www.protocols.io/view/sars-cov-2-mcgill-nextera-flex-sequencing-protocol-bisbkean. For
samples sequenced on Illumina, the Nextera Flex kit was used starting from 150 ng of DNA
following the procedure from the manufacturer. Plate 9 was sequenced using both Nanopore and
Illumina technologies, as well as by applying the Cleanplex assay by Paragon Genomics, followed
by MGI sequencing. For samples that were sequenced more than once, the data with the higher
coverage was used to generate consensus sequences and subsequent phylogenetic analysis.
For the Cleanplex assay, we used the Cleanplex for MGI SARS-CoV-2 research panel by
Paragon Genomics. The assay utilizes 343 primer pairs tiled across the viral genome as
described (Li et al. 2020). The manufacturer’s protocol (UG4002-1) was used, with the
modification of increasing the multiplex PCR cycle number to 16 in order to improve the
sequencing of samples with qPCR cycle threshold (Ct) values of >29, followed by sequencing on
an MGI DNBSEQ G400 instrument.
Basecalling and consensus sequence generation
All samples were aligned to the reference genome of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus-2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 (GenBank Accession MN908947.3). Aligned reads were then
used to produce a consensus sequence using pipelines based on the Artic Network novel
coronavirus bioinformatics protocol. A brief description of the pipeline, including software
packages and important parameters, is provided for each sequencing platform below.
Datasets produced using the Nextera Flex Illumina protocol were first filtered to remove any host
reads. To do so, reads were aligned to a hybrid reference including SARS-CoV-2 (MN908947.3)
and GRCh38 using bwa-mem (v0.7.17). Any reads mapping to a region of the human reference
with a mapping quality of zero or more were removed from the dataset. After filtering out host
reads, the remaining reads were trimmed using cutadapt (v2.10), then aligned to the SARS-CoV2 reference (MN908947.3) using bwa-mem (v0.7.17). After alignment, reads were filtered using
sambamba (v0.7.0) to remove paired reads with an insert size outside of the 60-300bp range, as
well as any unmapped reads, secondary alignments and reads that did not match the FR/RF

orientation. iVar (v1.3) was used to trim any remaining primers. Samtools (v1.9) was used to
produce a pileup which was then used as input by iVar (v1.3) to create a consensus sequence
for regions with a minimum of 10x depth, using reads with a Q score >20 and a minimum allele
frequency of 0.75. A full description of the process can be found here:
https://c3g.github.io/covseq_McGill/SARS_CoV2_Sequencing/Illumina_overview.html
Datasets produced using the CleanPlex MGI protocol were processed using the same pipeline
as Illumina Nextera Flex samples, except that Artic Network primers and amplicon data was
changed to the corresponding CleanPlex information. A full description of the process can be
found here:
https://c3g.github.io/covseq_McGill/SARS_CoV2_Sequencing/MGI_overview.html
Raw data produced using Nanopore sequencing was basecalled using guppy (v3.4.4) with a HighAccuracy Model (dna_r9.4.1_450bps_hac). Reads were de-multiplexed using guppy barcodes
(v3.4.4), requiring barcodes on both ends. Reads were filtered by size to remove anything outside
of the 400-700bp range using the ARTIC Network ‘guppyplex’ tool. Reads were aligned with
minimap2 (v2.17), then filtered to remove incorrect primer pairs and randomly downsample highdepth regions to keep 800x depth per strand using the ARTIC network framework. Nanopolish
(v0.13.1) was used to call variants in regions with a minimum depth of 16x and a flank of 10bp.
After masking regions with coverage below 20x, the called variants were used to generate a
consensus sequence using bcftools (v1.9) consensus. A full description of the process can be
found here:
https://c3g.github.io/covseq_McGill/SARS_CoV2_Sequencing/ONT_overview.html
For samples sequenced with two or more technologies, all datasets were processed separately
using the methods described above. The resulting consensus sequences were compared to keep
only the most complete consensus for downstream analyses, as determined based on the number
of missing bases (Ns). The consensus sequences were deposited in GISAID under accession
number listed in Table S1.
Phylogenetic analysis:
Raw and time-scaled phylogenomic trees were built using the NextStrain pipeline
(https://github.com/nextstrain, version 1.16.2) installed in a conda environment
(https://github.com/conda/conda, version 4.8.3) (Hadfield et al. 2018). This pipeline uses the
Augur toolkit (https://github.com/nextstrain/augur, version 7.0.2) to filter, align/mask genomic
sequences, build trees (divergence and time-scaled) and produce an output file processed by the
Auspice web interface (https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice, version 2.16.0) to explore
phylodynamic and phylogenomic data. Augur removed all sequences shorter than 27,500 bp and
sampled after June 1st, 2020. The Augur/align module was then called to execute the multiple
sequence alignment with MAFFT (https://github.com/GSLBiotech/mafft, version v7.463) using
Wuhan-1 (Genbank accession MN908947) as a reference genome. The final alignment was
masked at the beginning (first 100 sites) and end (last 50 sites), and at positions 18529, 29849,
29851 and 29853 (sites of known low sequencing quality and homoplasies). We then used Augur
to select sequences from GISAID that were most similar to our 2,921 Québec sequences. These
global context sequences were then grouped by country/month in order to keep a maximum of
100 sequences and 5 identical sequences per country-month combination.
We used IQ-TREE (http://www.iqtree.org/, version 1.6.12) to construct a phylogenetic tree of
Québec only sequences and another tree of Québec and global context sequences, with the GTR
substitution model. Branch lengths, sampling dates and ancestral states (geographic regions,
nucleotides and amino acids sequences) at internal nodes were inferred with the Augur/refine
and Augur/traits modules by calling TreeTime (https://github.com/neherlab/treetime, version
0.7.5) (using the same default parameters as those chosen in public builds;

Augur/export module exports a single compiled results file required for data visualization in
Auspice. All Nexstrain analyses were executed on a 64-bit CentOS server version 7.4.1708 using
40 CPUs.
Clade assignment was done during the Nextrain build. As input, the Augur/clades module uses
the phylogenetic tree, the observed and inferred nucleotide sequences at each node and a clade
configuration file. In this clade file, every single clade value is associated with a specific
combination of position/nucleotide variant. As an alternative clade assignment scheme, we also
used the Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak LINeages (Rambaut et al. 2020)
combined with lineages (https://github.com/cov-lineages/lineages) version 2020-05-09 (Pangolin
2.3.2 and pangoLearn 2021-02-21; cov-lineages.org).
To infer introduction events into Québec (QC), we used discrete character ancestral state
reconstruction (ASR) to infer non-QC and QC nodes in the global context time tree. Three
methods were implemented in R using either: (1) maximum likelihood (ace function from ape
package v5.4-1, assuming the equal rates model), or unordered Fitch parsimony implementing
either with (2) delayed (DELTRAN) or (3) accelerated (ACCTRAN) transformation algorithms in
order to deal with ambiguous nodes (fitch.mvsl function from package mvSLOUCH v2.6.1). With
the reconstruction, we assigned nodes to the QC state when supported by ≥50% (with ML) or 1
(with parsimony) of the state assignment. By starting at the root of the tree we identified transition
nodes, i.e. as non-QC nodes that immediately precede a QC node or leaf, by testing all non-QC
nodes for any QC children and whether or not they (or their parent node) have already been
identified as a transition node. Transition nodes that were also polytomies were flagged. Note that
these methods likely underestimate the number of introductions. The non-QC to QC transitions
were collected and their most basal QC leaf (or leaves) are recorded. These candidates were
then cross-checked with travel history data and were only recorded if at least one had travelhistory. In the case of a polytomy with multiple basal QC sequences, only one was chosen by the
shortest branch length. If no travel history was available then the closest outgroup of the
introduction event was used to assign the likely origin of the introduction event. Non-QC to QC
transition nodes were labeled as likely introduction events, and the descendants of these
identified transition nodes were used to define QC transmission lineages. The date of the nonQC to QC transition node was used as the TMRCA of the introduction event. For the largest QC
transmission lineages (containing >50 cases) the TMRCA was also inferred using BEAST (see
below). Phylogenetic visualizations and dataset manipulation were done in R using a suite of
packages: ape, phylotools, phytools, phangron, tidyverse and ggtree.
Phylodynamics
The molecular clock signal was assessed by plotting the root-to-tip phylogenetic distance against
time using TempEst (Rambaut et al. 2016). The largest (>50 cases) QC transmission lineages
were analyzed using Bayesian phylogenetic tree reconstruction with Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) implemented in BEAST v2.6.2 (Bouckaert et al. 2019) with the Birth-Death Skyline
(BDSKY) model, assuming a gamma distributed Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano (HYK) nucleotide
substitution model (with a uniform distribution 0.25 [0,1] of the nucleotide frequencies, a lognormal
2 [0, ∞] for 𝜘, and a 𝛾 count of 4 with an exponential distribution 0.5 [-∞, ∞]) and a strict molecular
clock (0.8 x 10-3 substitutions/site/year). Using this model, we estimated the effective reproduction
number (Re), TMRCA, and sampling proportion. The prior for the reproduction number was a
lognormal distribution (initial = 2 [0,10], M=0, S=0.5), origin was a normal distribution (mean=0.1,
𝜎=0.05, initial 10[0,∞]), the rate of becoming infectious was a normal distribution (mean=10,
𝜎=1.3, initial =1[0,∞]), and sampling rate was a beta distribution (𝛼=1, 𝛽=5, initial= 0.01[0,1]). All
MCMC analyses were run with 50 million generations and sampling every 50,000 steps for
lineages with >100 cases and 30 million generations and 30,000 steps for lineages < 100 cases.
Convergence was achieved when all posteriors gave effective sample sizes (ESS) > 300 with
10% burn-in.

Calculation of population genetic metrics
We calculated Tajima’s D to infer changes of the viral effective population size and deviation from
a standard neutral evolutionary model. We separated the data into eight time periods of two weeks
between February 20, 2020 and June 10, 2020. For each time period, we randomly sampled 20
viral consensus sequences to calculate Tajima’s D, and repeated this procedure 99 times to
obtain confidence intervals. We calculated both a combined value of D across all sequences, and
a separate estimate for each Pangolin viral lineage. Lineages or time bins with fewer than 20
sequences were discarded. We calculated D as described (Tajima 1989):

%𝑉' (𝜃& − 𝜃' )

Eq. 1

where the 𝑉' denotes the expected sampling variance of (𝜃! − 𝜃" ). 𝜃! is the nucleotide diversity,
calculated based on the average number of pairwise differences among consensus sequences:

where n is the genome length, N is the number of consensus sequences, 𝐶(𝑁, 2) is the choose()
function which calculates the number of pairs of consensus sequences in a set of size N and
Nb_reads_pwdiff is the number of pairwise nucleotide differences. Because pairwise differences
are maximized when there are intermediate-frequency mutations, 𝜃! is more sensitive to
intermediate-frequency mutations. 𝜃" is another estimator of the nucleotide diversity which is
calculated based on the number segregating sites and is sensitive to low-frequency mutations:
𝜃! =

We also estimated dN/dS, the ratio of non-synonymous (dN) and synonymous substitutions rates
(dS), by comparing consensus sequences to the reference genome (Genbank MN908947.3)
allowing us to infer changes in selective pressures at the protein level.

nonsynonymous sites, Nbssub is the number of synonymous substitutions, and Nbss is the number
of synonymous sites. We only considered consensus sequences with more than 1 synonymous
mutation to be able to attribute finite values to dN/dS. These analyses were coded in R.

Fig. S5. Root-to-tip regression analysis of Québec SARS-CoV-2 genomes up to June 1st,
2020. Most successful viral lineages are annotated by colors. This dataset exhibits a weak
association between genetic distances and sampling dates (correlation coefficient, r = 0.33,
R2 = 0.11, slope = 5.65x10-4 substitutions/site/year, p < 0.0001), calculated with TempEst
(Rambaut et al. 2016) using the maximum-likelihood tree displayed in Fig. S4 B.

Fig. S6. (A) Subtree of the time-scaled global phylogeny that captures a transmission
lineage of B.1 that spread through a Laval long-term care facility. Black: consensus
sequences from GISAID, not from Québec, Blue: Québec viral sequences. Young: <
30 years old, Adult: 30 - 60 years old, Senior: > 60 years old. (B) Age distribution of
the Québec cases in this transmission lineage, median age (range).

Fig S7. Associations between lineage-defining mutations and transmission lineage
size. (A) Lineage-defining mutations. For each SARS-CoV-2 Pangolin viral lineage observed
in Québec during the first wave, the nine mutations (columns) that are present in the
consensus sequences of all the instances of the lineage (rows) are represented in black.
The resulting heatmap was ordered by hierarchical clustering. (B) Associations between
lineage-defining mutations and transmission lineage size. Each of the nine lineage-defining
mutations was tested for association with transmission lineage size by comparing the
transmission lineages size with the ancestral allele (blue) to the derived allele (red) (MannWhitney test, P-values reported after false-discovery rate correction for multiple hypothesis
testing). The lineage-defining mutations are labeled in the following format: Ancestral
nucleotide allele, Genome position, Derived nucleotide allele; Ancestral Amino Acid allele,
Position In Protein, Derived Amino Acid allele; ORF; Gene.
