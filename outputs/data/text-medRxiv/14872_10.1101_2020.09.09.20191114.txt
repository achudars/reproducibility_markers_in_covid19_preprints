Abstract

59

Background: COVID-19 turned into a global pandemic rapidly. This study was aimed to

60

investigate SARS-CoV-2 associated epidemiology and clinical outcomes in Bangladesh in order

61

to understand the future course of COVID-19 pandemic and develop prevention approaches.

62

Design and Methods: A cross-sectional retrospective study was conducted for a sample of 1,021

63

RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted in six different hospitals in Bangladesh and who

64

recovered four weeks prior to the interview date.

65

Results: Of the total sample, 111 (10.9%) cases were asymptomatic while the number of

66

symptomatic cases were 910 (89.1%). Higher prevalence of COVID-19 persisted in the male

67

population (75%), cohorts having B (+) ve blood group (36.3%) and for the 31-40 age group.

68

More than 85% of the sample reported a BCG vaccination mark. Common symptoms observed

69

in our study samples were fever (72.4%), cough (55.9%), loss of taste (40.7%) and body ache

70

(40%); whereas among the biochemical parameters, Neutrophil (46.4%), D-dimer (46.1%), and

71

Ferritin (37.9%) levels were found elevated. Post-COVID complications including pain (31.8%),

72

loss of concentration (24.4%) and anxiety or depression (23.1%) were also found significantly

73

prevalent in the symptomatic cases with commodities.

74

Conclusion: Our study has shown that adult males aged in between 31-40 in Bangladesh are

75

more vulnerable to being infected with COVID-19. The study also indicates a rising trend of the

76

asymptomatic cases as the pandemic progresses deeper in time, and hence, deployment of

77

interventions to curb further spread of community infection is necessary to avoid the grave

78

outcomes of COVID-19 in Bangladesh.

Introduction:

85

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 or COVID-19 is a contagious disease of the respiratory system.1

86

In terms of genetic characteristics, SARS-CoV-2 is significantly diverse from SARS-CoV and

87

MERS-CoV.2, 3 The virus’s rapid progression around the globe has unfolded a variety of clinical

88

manifestations in different geographical locations. Severe prognosis of COVID-19 has been

89

reported to be associated with comorbidities including diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular

90

disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), malignancy, and chronic liver disease.4

91

With a population of more than 161 million people, Bangladesh stands eighth among the most

92

populated countries in the world.5 In Bangladesh, as of 9 October, 2020, infections from SARS-

93

CoV-2 has spiked to nearly 375,870 individuals while the death count figured to 5477 people

94

(https://iedcr.gov.bd/). In regards to the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 and its association with

95

various pathophysiological factors, no comprehensive study has been conducted in Bangladesh.

96

As some of the studies were not conducted for a large sample size,6-8 understanding a bigger

97

picture of the aforementioned relationship of COVID-19 symptoms with comorbidities and

98

biochemical parameters from previous studies was not possible. Especially, the long-term

99

complications among patients recovered from COVID-19 have not been conducted with

100

necessary rigor and comprehension. Investigating the epidemiological characteristics of

101

individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 in Bangladesh will help in providing a proper insight of

102

the clinical characterization and patterns in progression of the disease. Therefore, it is vital to

103

examine these aspects and factors related to the outcomes of COVID-19 for enacting appropriate

104

means of prevention and treatment.

105

Since to this date, this study is a pioneering approach for the epidemiological characterization of

106

COVID-19 individuals in Bangladesh, data related to the clinical aspects of COVID-19 is scarce,

107

we managed to create a large sample size for our study by collecting data for a consecutive three

108

months during the pandemic. This study aimed to investigate the patterns and array of symptoms

109

in confirmed COVID-19 individuals as well as assess its relationship with the presence of

110

comorbidities and results from biochemical assays with various other preliminary long-term

111

clinical expositions post recovery.

Methods

126

Study design:

127

A cross-sectional retrospective study was conducted among the cases confirmed to be COVID-

128

19 positive following assessment by RT-PCR using any one of the following samples: throat

129

swabs / nasal swabs /blood. These COVID-19 diagnosed patients were admitted in six different

130

hospitals in Bangladesh. Scrutinization of post COVID-19 clinical characteristics was done upon

131

each subject’s discharge from the hospital and after confirming that these subjects were indeed

132

COVID-19 free by conducting two consecutive RT-PCR assays 24 hours apart. Recovered

133

patients (according to RT-PCR negative result) at least four weeks before the interview were

134

considered for this study. We also categorized all positive patients into two categories

135

(symptomatic and asymptomatic) according to the presence of any one of the established

136

symptoms referred by WHO/CDC.

137

Study sites and sample size:

138

The study was conducted in six hospitals having specialized units (following government

139

instructions) for isolating and treating COVID-19 individuals from two different divisions of

140

Bangladesh namely Dhaka (Dhaka Mohanogor General Hospital and Narayanganj Sadar

141

Hospital) and Chattogram (Chittagong General Hospital, Chittagong Medical College Hospital,

142

Chattogram Field Hospital and Chandpur Sadar Hospital). The study period started from 1 April

143

2020 and ended on 30 June 2020.

144

Data collection and case enrollment:

145

The physicians collected data relevant to the study retrospectively by interviewing 1021 COVID-

146

19 patients over the telephone and all data were recorded into a preset Google Form. After

147

double checking each information, the Google Forms were submitted and stored in our database.

148

Medical prescriptions, hospital records were also accessed and matched with patients’ data

149

obtained through the interview. Questionnaires included patient’s socio-demographic

150

information, clinical manifestations, biochemical parameters, behavioral practice, comorbidities,

151

medications, vitals, laboratory tests, electrocardiogram results, inpatient medications, treatments

152

and outcomes (including length of stay, discharge, re-admission, and mortality).

153

Exclusion criteria:

154

In this study, deceased patients and those who were not interested to participate or did not give

155

consent to data collection and usage for research purposes were not included.

156

Ethical consideration:

157

The protocol was approved by IRB of 250 bedded General Hospital, Chattogram, Bangladesh.

158

The ethical approval number is 00981.

159

Statistical analysis:

160

Descriptive statistical analyses were performed expressing categorical variables with numbers

161

and proportions. They were compared using chi-square test and Fisher’s exact test. P values of

162

less than or equal to 0.05 (two-sided) were considered statistically significant. Multivariate

163

logistic regressions were performed to identify the predictors of post-COVID long-term

164

complications. All statistical analyses were performed using Stata/MP 14.0 and GraphPad Prism.

165

The study considered COVID patients showing no symptoms of infection as asymptomatic and

166

those showing at least one of the typical symptoms as symptomatic. Similarly, patients with at

167

least one type of comorbidity were considered comorbid and those with no comorbidity were

168

considered non-comorbid patients.

Results

170

Demographic information and vaccination history of COVID-19 patients in the sample:

171
172

Of 1,021 COVID-19 inpatients, a total of 111(10.9%) were found to be asymptomatic, while the

173

number of symptomatic cases were 910 (89.1%) which was predominant within the sample

174

(Table-1).

175

As shown in Table-1, a subject's age was found to have association with him/her being

176

asymptomatic or symptomatic (p=0.000). Higher proportions of asymptomatic cases were found

177

under the age groups of 0-9 (7.2%), 10-19 (7.2%), and 20-29 (28.8%). Common to both

178

symptomatic and asymptomatic groups, the proportion of males was greater than that of females,

179

the figures being 64.9% and 76.1% respectively (p = 0.01). Individuals in the symptomatic group

180

showed more likelihood towards being overweight (46.4%) and obese (24.6%). A significant

181

bivariate relationship was found (with a p value of 0.009) between blood group and a patient’s

182

being symptomatic or asymptomatic. More than 90% of all patients received all required basic

183

vaccines, and almost 85% had a clear BCG scar on their arms. Diabetes was the most prevalent

184

comorbid condition (19.3%), followed by respiratory (8.4%) and cardiovascular (7.7%) diseases

185

within the total sample. An over the time trend in asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID-19

186

cases was also examined. The bar graph in Figure-1 clearly illustrates an upward trend among

187

asymptomatic COVID-19 cases with time while the trend for symptomatic cases remained more

188

or less similar.

192

Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 patients:

193
194

Table-2 presents counts and proportions of usual signs and symptoms as observed in individuals

195

diagnosed with COVID-19. Of the total sample, 474 (51%) patients experienced a body

196

temperature exceeding 1010 F, while for 368 (39.5%) patients the body temperature ranged from

197

990 F to 1010 F. The oxygen saturation rate went below 90% for 19.3% of the patients, and

198

another 8% patient experienced a low saturation level of 90% to 92.9%. The systolic and

199

diastolic blood pressure measures were found to be greater than 159 mmHg and 99 mmHg,

200

respectively for 4.7% of the total cases. The most prevalent symptoms among the cases in order

201

of prevalence rate were fever (72.4%), cough (55.9%), taste loss (40.7%), body ache (40%),

202

smell loss (36.9%), breathing difficulty (25.9%), and sore throat (23.7%).

203
204

Biochemical parameters of COVID-19 patients in the sample:

205
206

For a substantial number of cases within the sample, biochemical assay results were found to be

207

deviant from the normal range for each of the markers measured in the analyte (Figure-2A).

208

Neutrophils and D-dimer were found to be high for about 50% of the patients in the sample

209

while for approximately 40% of patients, the diagnostic tests showed a high level of Glucose,

210

Ferritin, CRP, and SGPT. Among other parameters, Troponin was high for 30% of the patients,

211

while Creatinine, WBC-TC, and ESR were at elevated levels for around 20% of the patients. A

212

low lymphocyte count was found for 40% of the patients while laboratory test results for 10% of

213

the patients reported low platelet count as well.

215

Medication history during the tenure of COVID-19 persistence for cases:

216
217

Individuals with COVID-19 during the tenure of their SARS-CoV-2 positive status took some

218

day-to-day medications along with antibiotics (Figure-2B). Of the antibiotics, 55.71% of the

219

cases took Azithromycin solely while the number stood at 74% when it was consumed in

220

combination with other therapeutic drugs establishing a higher proportion in terms of intake as

221

compared to the other antibiotics frequently taken. 8.18% of the patients took only Doxycycline

222

and 14.7% took Doxycycline but in combination with other medications, while for Ivermectin

223

the sole consumption and consumption in combination stood at 6.14% and 11.2% respectively.

224

Of the other types of medications, Montelukast was taken by 0.3% and 22.5% of the patients

225

took multiple other types of therapeutic drugs. 6.13% of the patients did not take any

226

medications during COVID-19.

227

Preliminary long-herm health issues associated with COVID-19:

228
229

The most prevalent post-recovery complications that were reported included sleep disturbance

230

(32%), pain and discomfort (31.8%), lack of concentration (24.4%), anxiety and depression

231

(23.1%), memory loss (19.5%), and complications with mobility (17.7%), as shown in Table 3.

232

Considering comorbidity as determinant, chi-square tests for post-recovery complications

233

returned significant deviations between individuals having comorbidity and those without for all

234

reported complications but panic attacks. Comorbid patients were found to be more likely to

235

experience mobility problem (26%), problems performing usual activities (14%), pain and

236

discomfort (40%), anxiety and depression (28.5%), sleep disturbances (41.3%), concentration

237

loss (28.5%), and memory loss (24.6%) than those without any comorbid conditions. We

238

observed significant differences in proportion between the two groups for all complications

239

except panic attacks, giving a clear conception on the comparison between the results of the

240

aforesaid cases with those found for comorbid and non-comorbid cases. Columns in Table-4

241

contain estimated results from logit models designed for post-recovery complications. As the

242

adjusted odd ratios indicate, the respiratory disease caused each outcome of memory loss and

243

pain and discomfort at 5% level and sleep disturbance at 1%. Finally, it was found that taking

244

drugs for a long time significantly increased the probability of losing memory, concentration,

245

and having sleep disturbance at 1% level and anxiety and depression at 5% level.

246
247

Contact History of the COVID-19 Patients in this Sample:

248
249

This study also assessed the contact history of patients included in the study sample, focusing on

250

multiple variables representing direct and indirect contacts (Supplementary file, Table-S1). As

251

Table S1 shows 50% of the diagnosed cases came in close contact with other COVID-19 positive

252

individuals, while 40.6% patients of the total sample had family members diagnosed with

253

COVID-19. A total of 608 (62%) patients reported to have an indirect contact, and 466 (48.5%)

254

patients made frequent visits outside their home prior to being infected.

Discussion

262

In the current study, we investigated 1021 COVID-19 inpatients diagnosed through RT-PCR in

263

six different health facilities in Bangladesh. We believe that the current study will be able to shed

264

light on the epidemiological aspects of COVID-19 during the crisis period. While the study

265

revealed facts aligning with those established globally some observations require further follow

266

up and extensive studies in Bangladesh.

267

Our study has revealed that among the age groups, the 20-39 cohorts showed the highest prone to

268

infection rate (54.7%) and in terms of gender, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in males

269

(74.9%) was 3 times more than that in females (25.1%). Several studies from across the globe

270

showed higher median age,9-11 mean age,12 or age group9 for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We

271

explained the observations in light of demographic and socio-economic situations in Bangladesh.

272

21-40

273

(https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/341.html),

274

middle-aged people mostly fall under the working class and are needed to go are mostly

275

obligated to leave home for work, and hence having higher odds of getting infected.13 Females,

276

especially in rural Bangladesh are mostly confined to household work, which might be a cause

277

for less infection among these groups.

278

Among the study subjects, 38.33% had comorbidities. Diabetes was found to be the most

279

prominent comorbidity (19.40%) within the study sample and this fact was reflected in similar

280

studies conducted in China and UK.11,

281

(8.40%) and cardiovascular diseases (7.70%) and the results obtained from our study aligned to

282

the trends in other countries in terms of high prevalence.9, 10, 14

283

As for the symptoms associated with COVID-19, fever (72.4%) and cough (55.9%) were the

284

most prominent and shared among cases (Table-2). Other clinical manifestations with significant

285

association (P<0.01) were breathing difficulty (25.90%) and chills (12.50%). Diarrhea and GI

286

symptoms were also widely observed in 19.80% cases of COVID-19 in the study sample akin to

287

results obtained from previous studies conducted on the MERS/SARS-CoV pandemics.15

288

Of the 1,021 COVID-19 positive cases in our sample, 10.9% were asymptomatic which is in

289

accordance with the findings in South Korea and China.9, 16 Interesting enough, our observation

290

identified an upward trend for the increase in asymptomatic COVID-19 cases following April

291

2020 (Figure 1). Although no systematic assessment has been done on this aspect, our

292

observation complies with the records and pronouncements of the health professionals and

293

hospital registries in Bangladesh. For getting a better insight on the upward trend of

294

asymptomatic COVID-19 cases further studies and scrutinization are required including a larger

295

sample and dataset.

296

The current study observed different parameters obtained from biochemical assays conducted

297

within the sample and categorized the results as low, normal and high compared to a reference

298

value (Figure 2A). Almost half of the cases had a high level of D-dimer (46.12%) establishing

299

COVID-19 related coagulopathy which is likely a manifestation of profound inflammatory

300

response.17 For the other parameters, rise in ferritin, CRP, ESR and glucose levels were found in

301

37.92%, 36.08%, 27.37% and 36.48% of the COVID-19 cases respectively. These findings were

302

found to comply with results obtained from similar studies in China conducted on a sample size

303

of 99 and 138 patients respectively.18, 19

304

Our study revealed that 28.75% cases of patients had raised troponin level and it is assumed that

305

this is owing to myocarditis, microangiopathy, myocardial infarction, cytokine storm etc.17, 20-23

306

Elevated liver enzyme, SGPT was also found in 36.83% cases in this study which is also in

307

accordance with in many other papers confirmed by review.24 Although, possible mechanism is

308

yet to be confirmed, majority of these cases reported use of multiple drugs like antibiotics,

309

antivirals, hydroxychloroquine and steroids, which could have contributed to the liver cell

310

damage. Additionally, ischemia and immune mediated injury might be responsible for elevated

311

liver enzyme in Covid-19 positive cases.24 These observations suggest that patients diagnosed

312

with COVID-19 should also undergo follow up diagnosis procedures to check for chronic

313

damages of the heart and liver.

314

Total cell count reports for COVID-19 positive individuals indicated that neutrophil count was

315

elevated in 46.44% of the cases. On the contrary, reduced lymphocyte and platelet counts have

316

been observed among 50% and 10% COVID-19 positive patients. This is in accordance with

317

several other case series around the globe.17, 25-28 As our sample included individuals recovered

318

from COVID-19, it is clear that these fluctuating parameters for the blood cell counts did not

319

become lethal to the patient. However, whether they were related to any severe symptom

320

previous to recovery requires further investigation. Our study did not investigate the level of

321

cytokines or other inflammatory mediators in the patients. Further studies in this regard will be

322

helpful in understanding the severity and fatality among COVID-19 patients with respect to

323

immune response mediators.

324

Human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been established as the major mode of

325

spread and several reports provided evidence of transmission of COVID-19 by direct and

326

indirect contact in hospital, family and community settings where interventions were not applied

327

and basic health norms and distancing were not maintained.29-32 In our study, majority of the

328

cases (62%) reported indirect contact with confirmed cases, whereas, 48.5% admitted to go out

329

of their homes frequently prior to being infected and diagnosed (Table-S1, supplementary). It

330

further shows that 50% of the respondents had close contact with confirmed cases and 40.6% had

331

COVID-19 positive family members. So, it can be easily concluded from this data that

332

community transmission is very common in Bangladesh and hence social distancing and other

333

preventive measures should be fully implemented to prevent further deterioration.

334

Our study has revealed that antibiotics were heavily suggested as a part of the treatment protocol

335

for the COVID-19 patients (Figure 2B). It has been found that Azithromycin was the most

336

prescribed antibiotic (74%); among them 55.71% were prescribed to take it as a sole drug.

337

Doxycycline and Ivermectin were taken by 14.7% and 11.2% cases respectively; among them

338

8.18% and 6.14% patients got them exclusively. Supportive drugs like montelukast were also

339

taken by a very small number of patients (3%). In Bangladesh, the guideline for COVID-19

340

management allows compassionate use of various antiviral and anti-bacterial drugs along with

341

antimalarial drugs (https://dghs.gov.bd/index.php/en/). However, we recommend that the

342

excessive use of Azithromycin and other antibiotics may aggravate the crisis related to the rise of

343

antibiotic resistance in Bangladesh.

344

Whether BCG vaccination may play a significant role in preventing the SARS-CoV-2 infection

345

has remained an area of debate and requires further analysis and assessment. According to the

346

latest WHO brief,33 BCG does not give protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. In our study,

347

we have found that 835 (82%) cases have a BCG vaccination mark (Table-1). Therefore,

348

supporting the WHO brief, we infer that BCG vaccination may not play any role in preventing

349

SARS-CoV-2 infection despite some early speculations about it. However, as the subjects are all

350

alive despite SARS-CoV-2 infection, it will be insightful to further investigate whether BCG

351

vaccination may help reduce the severity and hence mortality by modulating the innate immune

352

system.34

353

Our study has also shed light on the relationship between the ABO blood groups and

354

susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. A number of previous reports suggested individuals

355

having an A (+ve) blood group have the highest risk of being infected while O (+ve) individuals

356

have a comparatively lower risk rate.35-37. Our study has showed that the majority of the cases

357

belong to B+ve blood group (35.4%), preceded by O (+ve) 28.2% and A (+ve) 20.3% (Table-1).

358

This ratio is comparable with the population distribution of ABO blood groups (B+ve ~34%,

359

O+ve ~30% and A+ve ~26%) in Bangladesh.38

360

geographical prevalence of different blood groups might be the reason behind the findings of

361

certain ABO blood groups being more common in certain countries without having any real

362

contribution to COVID-19 susceptibility.

363

An important part of our study was to assess and scrutinize the sample for post-COVID

364

complications- both physical and mental (Table-3 and Table-S2, supplementary file). Our study

365

found that people with comorbidities have reported post-COVID complications such as mobility

366

problems, pain and discomfort, anxiety and depression and indication of memory loss with a

367

greater significance (Table-4). We also found that the vulnerability of recovered individuals

368

towards post COVID complications was due to being comorbid and being exposed to drugs for a

369

prolonged period (Table-4). Although retrieved from a basic questionnaire, the results obtained

370

from this study are statistically significant. Our findings are consistent with data obtained from

371

similar studies in other countries.39, 40

372

Since this study was an onset in regards to epidemiological analysis of COVID-19 patients in

373

Bangladesh, it was prone to some limitations. Firstly, the study sample only included inpatients

So, we assume that the variation in the

374

from 6 selected hospitals providing aid to COVID-19 cases in Bangladesh which narrows down

375

the sample size and diversification in results. Secondly, since the data were collected over the

376

telephone there may be possibilities of information bias, interviewer bias as well as recall bias.

377

Finally, commenting on an individual’s health status and complications post COVID-19

378

depending on a four-week recovery period is prompt. Nevertheless, this study aimed to observe

379

the early post- COVID-19 health complications.

380

To date this is the most comprehensive study conducted in Bangladesh that assessed COVID-19

381

patients for both pre-recovery and post-recovery complications. Our data have reconfirmed some

382

significant global observations in regards to the epidemiological and clinical aspects of the

383

disease, but above all, the study has helped in addressing concerns that raised eyebrows

384

including the role of ABO blood group and BCG vaccination in COVID-19 susceptibility and

385

progression. We anticipate that the outcomes of this study will work as a baseline for future

386

studies in the same context.

Conclusion:

396
397

To sum up, this study identified the early health complications post recovery in COVID-19

398

patients which yet has aspects that require further assessment and examining for more in-depth

399

insights. This study found that individuals with comorbidities had a hard time coping with the

400

clinical implications imposed while they were with COVID-19. The fact that there is a

401

significant advancement of the number of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases calls for further

402

investigations. The results obtained from this study could contribute to devising effective

403

strategies for the provision of comprehensive health care to COVID-19 patients with

404

comorbidity.
