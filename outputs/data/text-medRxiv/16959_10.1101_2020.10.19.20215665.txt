On nonlinear incidence rate of Covid-19
Swarna Kamal Paul, Saikat Jana and Parama Bhaumik
Abstract—Classical Susceptible-Infected-Removed model with constant transmission rate and removal rate may not capture
real world dynamics of epidemic due to complex influence of multiple external factors on the spread. On top of that transmission
rate may vary widely in a large region due to non-stationarity of spatial features which poses difficulty in creating a global model.
We modified discrete global Susceptible-Infected-Removed model by using time varying transmission rate, recovery rate and
multiple spatially local models. No specific functional form of transmission rate has been assumed. We have derived the criteria
for disease-free equilibrium within a specific time period. A single Convolutional LSTM model is created and trained to map
multiple spatiotemporal features to transmission rate. The model achieved 8.39% mean absolute percent error in terms of
cumulative infection cases in each locality in a 10-day prediction period. Local interpretations of the model using perturbation
method reveals local influence of different features on transmission rate which in turn is used to generate a set of generalized
global interpretations. A what-if scenario with modified recovery rate illustrates rapid dampening of the spread when forecasted
with the trained model. A comparative study with current normal scenario reveals key necessary steps to reach baseline.

1 INTRODUCTION

D

ynamical systems equations based on compartmental
modelling of epidemiology have been widely used to
predict the spread of an epidemic. Susceptible-Infected-Removed or SIR model is one such simplified set of differential equations to model the spread. However, accurately
determining parameter values like the transmission rate
for a specific disease is a challenge. The dynamics of a disease may vary across space and time. Many external factors
may influence the transmission rate. Considering the
transmission rate constant for a disease, grossly oversimplifies the model, thus compromising accuracy. Secondly,
knowing the factors influencing the transmission rate and
the dynamics of the influence can provide a vivid understanding of the disease progression.
There are several different types of nonlinear incidence
rate suggested in the literature [3,4, 5, 6,7,8,9]. However,
most of them adopt some type of simple predefined function with few parameters to model the incidence rate. Simple functions have low representational capability. Thus,
they may not capture the detail dynamical variations of the
incidence rate caused by multiple factors. We propose a
Convolutional LSTM based spatiotemporal model to map
the transmission rate of Covid-19 with respect to multiple
input features and thereby map the derived incidence rate
from transmission rate. The model can forecast incidence
rate with high spatiotemporal resolution provided availability of clean historical data in that resolution. Exploratory
analysis reveals probable influence of external features on

transmission rate and eventually helped in feature selection. A spatiotemporal local interpretation method of a
black box model is proposed which in turn is used to explain the trained model. The explanations reveal local influence of different external features on the transmission
rate. A generalized global explanation is also generated to
find common influence of factors across multiple locations
and over a period.
We experimented with available data of Covid-19 across
multiple regions of USA and the model achieved 7.95%
and 0.19% mean absolute percent error in terms of new infection cases in each locality and cumulative total infection
cases across the country in a 10-day prediction period respectively. The generated explanations revealed high influence of population density, somewhat medium influence
of gender ratio and median population age on the transmission rate, globally. There are minor influences of temperature and temperature deviation but barely any observable influence of humidity. However, local influences of
features vary widely across multiple small regions. A criterion for disease-free equilibrium within a specific time period has been derived for discrete SIR model with variable
transmission and recovery rate. A long-term forecast using
the trained model and modified recovery rate to satisfy
disease-free equilibrium criteria reveals rapid damping of
active infection cases to reach the baseline. However frequent spikes due to resurgence are seen in this scenario. A
comparative study is made with forecasted dynamics using current normal recovery rate to reveal necessary ac————————————————
tions for rapid containment of the disease.

2 RELATED WORK
Kermack and Mckendrick [1] modelled communicable diseases using differential equations. Hethcote introduced the
SIR model [2] where population is compartmentalized into
susceptible, infected and removed groups. A set of differential equations modeled the dynamics of population in
different compartments. In traditional SIR model incidence
rate or the number of new infections per unit time varies
bilinearly with the number of infections and number of
susceptible in a population considering the transmission
rate as constant. However, assumptions like homogenous
mixing, non-dependence on external factors, no psychological effects on population etc. may not be realistic in
many cases. Thus, several authors [3,4, 5, 6,7,8,9] introduced different types of non-linear incidence rates mostly
addressing the saturation and psychological effect. Saturation effect states that the incidence rate might slow down
and saturate as number of infected individuals increases
due to low availability of susceptible individuals. Psychological effect on the population results in increased cautiousness among susceptible individuals as the epidemic
spreads thus, slowing down the transmission rate. Most of
the incidence rates stated above satisfy weakly non-linear
property and are too simple to capture any arbitrary effects
of the environment. SIR model with time varying transmission recovery rate have been studied in [11] and thresholds
theorems are derived. Liu et. al. [10] introduced a time varying switched transmission rate to model nonlinear incidence.
Hu et. al. developed a modified stacked autoencoder
model of the epidemic spread in China and they claimed
to achieve high level of forecasting accuracy [26]. On observing a universality in the epidemic spread in each country, Fanelli and Piazza [27] applied mean-field kinetics of
Susceptible-Infected-Recovered/Dead epidemic model to
forecast the spread and provided an estimation of peak infections in Italy. Zhan et. al. [14] integrated the intercity migration data in China with Susceptible-Exposed-InfectedRemoved model to forecast an estimation of epidemic
spread in China. Hong et. al. [12] considered variable
transmission rate of Covid19 and came up with variable Rnaught factor of Covid-19. Xi et. al. [28] used deep residual
networks to model spatiotemporal characteristics of the
spread of influenza and experimented with real dataset of
Shenzhen city in China. Paul et. al. [35] used ensemble of
ConvLSTM networks to forecast Covid-19 total infection
cases.

3 DISCRETE SIR MODEL WITH VARIABLE
TRANSMISSION RATE

In SIR model the total population in a region is compartmentalized into 3 classes, namely Susceptible (S), Infected
(I) and Removed (R). Initially the whole population is in

susceptible class. An individual can move from susceptible
to infected class on contracting the disease. An infected individual can move to removed class by either getting recovered and immune to the disease or deceased. The dynamics of the disease spread can be modelled by the following set of differential equations.
𝑑𝑆/𝑑𝑡 = −𝛽(𝑡)𝑆(𝑡)𝐼(𝑡)

(1)

𝑑𝐼/𝑑𝑡 = 𝛽(𝑡)𝑆(𝑡)𝐼(𝑡) − 𝛿(𝑡)𝐼(𝑡)

(2)

𝑑𝑅/𝑑𝑡 = 𝛿(𝑡)𝐼(𝑡)

(3)

Where 𝛽(𝑡) is disease transmission rate or contact rate and
𝛿(𝑡) is removal rate which is sum of recovery rate and mortality rate. It is assumed the population size (𝑁) remains
constant during the course of epidemic. 𝑆(𝑡), 𝐼(𝑡) and 𝑅(𝑡)
are scaled as fraction of total population. Thus, the following equation holds true.
𝑆(𝑡) + 𝐼(𝑡) + 𝑅(𝑡) = 1

(4)

From [11] we get the following ∀𝑡 > 𝑡0 , where 𝑟 = 𝑅(𝑡0 ),
𝑅(𝑡) ≥ 𝑟 ∀𝑡 > 𝑡0 and 𝐼(𝑡) ≥ 0
𝑑𝐼/𝑑𝑡 = 𝛽(𝑡)(1 − 𝐼(𝑡) − 𝑅(𝑡))𝐼(𝑡) − 𝛿(𝑡)𝐼(𝑡)
≤ [𝛽(𝑡)(1 − 𝑟) − 𝛿(𝑡)]𝐼(𝑡)
We consider discrete time steps in our modelling and
measurements are taken on daily basis. Thus, replacing
differential with difference equation.
𝐼(𝑡 + 1) − 𝐼(𝑡) ≤ [𝛽(𝑡)(1 − 𝑟) − 𝛿(𝑡)]𝐼(𝑡)

(5)

Solving for 𝐼(𝑡)
𝑡−1

𝐼(𝑡) ≤ 𝐼(𝑡0 ) ∏𝑡 [1 + 𝛽(𝑢)(1 − 𝑟) − 𝛿(𝑢)]
0

(6)

Since 0 ≤ 𝑟 < 1
𝑡−1

𝐼(𝑡) ≤ 𝐼(𝑡0 ) ∏𝑡 [1 + 𝛽(𝑢) − 𝛿(𝑢)]
0

𝐼(𝑡) ≤ 𝐼(𝑡0 )exp(∑𝑡−1
𝑡0 𝑙𝑜𝑔[1 − 𝛿(𝑢) − 𝛽(𝑢)])

(7)

Expanding log as Taylor series and taking only the first
term,
𝐼(𝑡) < 𝐼(𝑡0 )exp(− ∑𝑡−1
𝑡0 [𝛿(𝑢) − 𝛽(𝑢)])

(8)

Considering a constant average difference between transmission rate and removal rate 𝜀 = 𝛿 − 𝛽 within the period
𝑡0 = 0 and 𝑡 = 𝑇 such that 0 ≤ 𝜀 ≤ 1
𝐼(𝑇) < 𝐼(0)exp (−𝜀𝑇)

(9)

Considering 𝑁𝐼(𝑇) < 1 as disease free equilibrium state,
the upper bound of 𝜀 can be derived as following such that
the epidemic reaches baseline in time T.
𝜀 < log[NI(0)] /T

(10)

Maintaining 𝜀 > 0 asymptotically converges the total infection count to 0 at exponential rate thus makes the disease-free equilibrium stable.
Assuming a constant mortality rate, from (10) it can be deduced that increasing the recovery rate will directly reduce
the time span of the disease outbreak. However, there is a
hard limit for the removal rate, 𝛿(𝑡) ≤ 1. But 𝛽(𝑡) can be
greater than 1, specially during initial outbreak when total
infection count is low. In such situation dampening the

spread of infection will not be possible only with treatment
facilities. Immediate restriction of mobility in area of outbreak and rapid isolation of infected individuals can reduce the transmission rate. Once it comes down below 1,
enhanced treatment facilities can increase the recovery
rate, thus reducing the span of the disease outbreak.

4 SPATIOTEMPORAL MODELLING OF TRANSMISSION
RATE

The transmission rate 𝛽 can vary spatially as well as temporally based on multiple variables. Geographical location,
weather conditions [13], human mobility [14], population
statistics might be some of the impacting factors changing
the dynamics of the spread. An exploratory analysis reveals probable dependency of multiple spatial and temporal features on the transmission rate. Spatially co-located
regions might have similar dynamics of the spread with
high autocorrelation of transmission rate in a localized region. However distant regions may have dissimilar transmission dynamics with low correlation. Thus, a large geographic area has been divided into small regions called as
grids. Each grid has been divided even further into smaller
regions called pixels. A population within a pixel is assumed to be constant and transmission dynamics is modeled by separate SIR models for each pixel. Each grid consists of co-located regions which might be impacting each
other’s transmission rate. Feature is constructed for each
grid as multichannel temporal sequence of matrices which
in turn used for training a ConvLSTM [15] network to
model the transmission rate. Data has been obtained for a
region in United States from multiple sources [16, 29, 30,
31, 32, 33, 34]. The time span of the data is from 2020-03-21
to 2020-05-11.

4.1 Feature Construction
Covid19 daily data at USA county level are filtered by a spatial region of USA as shown in Fig. 1. The region is geospatially divided in M x N grids of equal sizes bounded by
calculated latitudes and longitudes.
Fig. 2a illustrates a grid bounded by latitudes and longitudes. The dotted line box is called as frame. The overlapping areas in all 4 directions in a frame allows flow of spatial influence from neighboring grids. A frame is in turn
divided into L x L pixel. Each pixel represents a bounded
area in geospatial region. Each pixel contains a value
mapped to certain feature in the bounded geospatial region. Frame matrices are constructed for each feature and
concatenated through a third axis called channels. For example, transmission rate and population density are two
features and they represent two separate L x L matrices in
a frame concatenated across a third axis. Some features like
transmission rate, active infection fraction, weather etc. are
distributed spatio temporally. Whereas other features like
population density, female fraction, median age are assumed time invariant and have no temporal component.
Thus, they are only distributed spatially and copied along
temporal axis. Population density has been log transformed to reduce skewness and normalized. Other features are only normalized in 0-1 scale. Daily transmission

individuals in removed class respectively at time 𝑡 in pixel
𝑖.

𝛿𝑖 (𝑡) = ∆𝑅𝑖 (𝑡)/[𝐼𝑖 (𝑡 − 1) + 1]

the overlapping frame that is used for training the model. Each grid is
divided LxL pixels. The margin refers to number of pixels of overlapping region. b) Illustration of sequence of a frame. t-0 is the most recent frame. Xtrain, Ytrain are the training samples and Xtest, Ytest are testing samples.

Each training sample of a frame is represented by a tensor
of dimension T x L x L x C, where T is the total time span
and C is number of channels or features. As shown in Fig.
2b each training sample is generated by sliding a time window size of W+1 by 1, leaving behind a test case sample of
time window size of W ′ in the most recent period. Number
of training samples for a frame can be calculated as T −
W ′ − W − 1. Thus, total number of training samples 𝑆𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛
for all frames can be calculated as Strain = (T − W ′ − W −
1) ∗ M ∗ N.
The forecasting problem is framed as supervised learning
problem. Given a sequence of observed multichannel
frames of spatial data as matrices 𝑋1 , 𝑋2 … 𝑋𝑡 the objective
of the model is to predict the next single channel frame
𝑌𝑡+1 . The training samples are divided into input sequences
of length W and output frames. The model forecasts the
transmission rate in each pixel in a frame for each timestep.
Thus, the output frame consists of only 1 channel. The input training dataset (Xtrain ) can be represented as a tensor
of size Strain x W x L x L x C and the output dataset (Ytrain ) as

Strain x W x L x L x 1. For training, the input sequences are
selected from all frames having non-zero total infection
count. Fig. 1b illustrates the sequence of a frame. The
frames t-7 to t-3 represents an input training sequence
(Xtrain ) of length W. The output frame (Ytrain ) for this training sample is t-2. Other training samples are generated by
sliding the window W+1 backwards in time by 1. The most
recent images t-0 and t-1 represents the test output images
(Ytest ) and immediate sequence of images t-6 to t-2 is the
test input sample (Xtest ). The test set Xtest is represented by
a tensor of size (M ∗ N) x W x L x L x C and Ytest by (M ∗
N) x W′ x L x L x 1.

4.2 Exploratory analysis of transmission rate
The primary purpose of the exploratory analysis is to understand the distribution of transmission rate and identify
probable influence of different features on the transmission rate. Eight external features are analyzed against
transmission rate to find probable influence. Among eight
features, four are spatial features having no temporal component, namely population density, housing density, female fraction, median age. Fig. 3 illustrates scatter charts
between average transmission rate and four spatial features for multiple pixels. The color gradient represents log
transformed cumulative number of infection cases in each
pixel. Only those pixels are filtered which experienced at
least 30 days of running infection cases and having at least
10 cumulative infection cases at the beginning of the observation period. Fig 3a and 3b displays scatter charts and regression lines of average transmission rate with respect to
population density and housing density in each pixel respectively. The two external features are log transformed
and scaled to get upper bounded by 1. Log transformation

correlated with both the features which is quite intuitive.
Places with high population density is expected to experience rapid spread of the disease. Locations with high population density also experienced highest number of cumulative cases. Fig. 3c and 3b displays scatter charts and regression lines of transmission rate with respect to female
fraction and median age of the population respectively. In
Fig 3c, 16 pixels have been filtered out having female fraction less than 0.45 to remove the skewness in the data.
There is a slight positive correlation between female fraction and transmission rate. However, this might not invoke
a suggestive idea about the dependency of this external
feature on transmission rate as majority of the pixels resides in the range of 0.50 – 0.53 female fraction with barely
any trend in that range. Also, there is an indirect correlation as in general pixels with high female fraction has high
population density. Median age has negative correlation
with transmission rate. There is an indirect correlation in
this case also as in general pixels with high median age has
low population density. Another intuitive assumption can
be, population with high median age are less mobile thus

restricting the spread of the disease.
Apart from four spatial features four other external spatiotemporal features are analyzed to observe any influence on
transmission rate. Fig. 4 illustrates time lagged cross correlation between transmission rate and other spatio-temporal features at pixel level. The external features are time
lagged from 0 to 15 time steps and cross correlated with
transmission rate for each lag. In the plot, pixels are arranged in increasing order of total infection cases. Fig. 4a
and 4b shows the plot of cross correlation of transmission
rate with respect to average daily temperature and 3-day
running window temperature standard deviation respectively. Average temperature is slightly positively correlated in time lag range of 0-5. In the plot, offset 15 denotes
time lag 0 and offset 0 as time lag 15. The correlation with
temperature variation varies widely across pixels. However, on average there is a minor positive correlation in
time lag range of 5-15. For both the features pixels having
high total infections have negative correlation with transmission rate in the time lag range of 0-10. Fig. 4c and 4d
shows the plot of cross correlation of transmission rate
with respect to average daily relative humidity and daily
removal rate respectively. There is an overall positive correlation with respect of relative humidity specially in pixels with highest infection cases. Removal rate is mostly
negatively correlated with transmission rate except in few
pixels having highest infection cases.
Correlation might not represent causality. Thus, we performed granger causality test [17] of transmission rate with
respect to different features. Granger causality is a statistical hypothesis test for finding if one time series can help
improving the forecasting accuracy of another time series.
It might not measure true causality rather it measures predictive causality. Chi square test is chosen as the hypothesis testing method and minimum pvalues for each pixel are
calculated. Augmented Dickey-Fuller test [18] is performed to test stationarity of all the timeseries. Table 1 displays the result of granger causality and Dickey-Fuller
tests. The column ‘% of pvalue < 0.05’ represents percentage of pixels for which the granger causality test gave
pvalue less than 0.05 for each feature. The column ‘% of
ADF<10%’ represents percentage of pixels for which the
Dickey-Fuller test gave test statistic less than 10% critical
value and having pvalue less than 0.1 for each feature.
From the observed results it seems for majority of the pixels the weather features and removal rate have predictive
causal relation with transmission rate. Also, for majority of
the pixels the feature timeseries are stationary or weakly
stationary.

4.3 ConvLSTM model of transmission rate
Recurrent neural networks (RNN) are a class of artificial
neural networks with nodes having feedback connections
thereby allowing it to learn patterns in variable length temporal sequences. However, it becomes difficult to learn
long term dependencies for traditional RNN due to vanishing gradient problem [19]. LSTMs [20] solve the

5

problem of learning long term dependencies by introducing a specialized memory cell as recurrent unit. The cells
can selectively remember and forget long term information
in its cell state through some control gates. In convolutional LSTM [15] a convolution operator is added in state
to state transition and input to state transition. All inputs,
outputs and hidden states are represented by 3D tensors
having 2 spatial dimensions and 1 temporal dimension.
This allows the model to capture spatial correlation along
with the temporal one. In our model we configured multichannel input such that distinct features can be passed
through different channels. Multiple convolutional LSTM
layers are stacked sequentially to form a network with high
nonlinear representation. The final layer is a 2D convolutional layer having one filter which constructs a single
channel output image as the next frame prediction. We assume the transmission rate saturates as number of infection cases increases. Thus, the modified transmission rate
is calculated as 𝛽𝑖′ (𝑡) = 𝛽𝑖 (𝑡) ∗ (τ𝑖 + 𝐼𝑖 (𝑡)) which serves as
the response variable for the model and τ𝑖 = 1/𝑁𝑖 and 𝑁𝑖 is
total population in pixel 𝑖 .
The model is tested by feeding in input sequence of frames
and next output frame is predicted which in turn is combined with other features along channel and appended
with the input sequence. The new input sequence is fed to
the model again to get the next predicted frame. This continues until forecasting completes for a desired time period. “Mean absolute percent error” (MAPE) and Kullback-Liebler (KL) divergence [17] are used to measure the
accuracy of the model. The model predicts the transmission rate for a future time period for each pixel which in
turn is used to calculate daily new infection cases ∆𝐼𝑖+ (𝑡)
using equation 11. The removal rate is estimated as running average of previous 3-days and daily removed cases
are calculated using equation 11. The active infection cases
(𝐼𝑖 (𝑡)) and susceptibles (𝑆𝑖 (𝑡)) are calculated using equation 1 and 2. Cumulative infection cases (∑ ∆𝐼𝑖+ (𝑡)) are calculated by summing up all new infection cases upto a certain day. MAPE of modified transmission rate is calculated
at pixel level for the prediction period and averaged. The
pixels with 0 susceptible population count are filtered out
while calculating MAPE and KL divergence. Pixel MAPE
is calculated as per equation 12, where G is set of all grids
and G′ set of all pixels such that the frame for each corresponding grid have non zero cumulative infection count,

scaling a series in 0 to 1 scale and 𝑃(𝑋) is probability distribution of 𝑋. Softmax is applied to convert total infection
cases as probability distribution across pixels. Since KL divergence measures the dissimilarity between two distribution thus a lower value of it indicates better performance

Pixel MAPE and grid MAPE are below 10% in both the
cases and country MAPE is below 1%. Predicted total infection cases at the end of prediction period is little overestimated than actual (1330525) when weather features are
included in modelling and overestimated when weather
features are not included. All future reference of trained
model suggests the model has been trained with all eight
features unless otherwise mentioned. Fig. 5 illustrates different plots of predicted vs actual infection cases in 10-day

4.4 Model test results
The model is constructed by stacking 4 Convolutional
LSTM layer sequentially and terminating the network with
a Convolutional 2D layer. The final layer is followed by exponential linear unit as activation. The input and other hidden Convolutional LSTM layers are followed by sigmoid
activation. Each Convolutional LSTM layer has 32 filters
and kernel size 3x3. The input layer is configured to take
tensors of size 16x16x8. Eight input features are constructed and fed into the model as separate channels.
Namely transmission rate, population density, female fraction, median age, active infection fraction, average temperature, temperature standard deviation and average relative humidity. The model is trained for 20 epochs with
batch size of 50 and mean squared error as loss function.
Out of 11378 samples 10809 are used for training the model
and 569 are for validation. The model is trained and tested
twice. Once with all the eight features another with only
five leaving out the weather features.

The dataset has a time span of 51 days out of which data
from 42nd to 51st day is used for testing the model and rest
for training and validation. Table 2 displays the training,
validation and test results of the model. Statistics suggests
there is a slight improvement of overall accuracy when
weather features are included while training the model.

5 EXPLAINING INFLUENCE ON TRANSMISSION RATE
One of our goal of this study is to understand how different
external features are influencing the transmission rate. We expect to find simple interpretable predictive causal relations
between transmission rate and different features. One of the
ways to find such relations is building an accurate predictive
model followed by explaining the predictions in terms of input features. As described in previous sections deep neural
networks can model the dynamics of epidemic quite accurately due to its high nonlinear representation. However high
accuracy is tradeoff against model interpretability. Given the
complexity of the Convolutional LSTM network used to
model the transmission rate it is nearly impossible to find
how each feature is influencing the transmission rate just by
studying the weight matrices. Using a high bias predictive
model like linear regression or shallow decision tree not only

reduces the accuracy but also drops interpretability [21]. Simple models can serve as interpretable models but may fail to
capture true relations among features globally. This problem
can be solved by building simple local models and drawing
local explanations of feature relations. However, there may
not be enough data points available or data distribution may
be highly skewed in a local region to confidently build a predictive model and draw interpretations on it. Thus, we use the
trained Convolutional LSTM model as the global model and
draw spatio-temporal local interpretations of it using locally
perturbated synthetic data by satisfying a criterion called local fidelity [22]. Local fidelity suggests the explanations
should be locally faithful with the model behavior. Local fidelity does not imply global fidelity however global fidelity
implies local. To increase interpretability simple surrogate
models can be trained with local data as it is expected that the
response variable varies with the features almost linearly in a
local region. In fact, there is a tradeoff between local fidelity
and interpretability that needs to be made. Model agnostic
methods perturbs the input features in a local region around
a single or a group of datapoints and feeds the model to obtain predicted response variable. This synthetic data is in turn
used to train simple surrogate models to obtain local interpretations of global model. There are several existing methods
available in the literature to derive local interpretations of a
model [22,23, 25]. Few works also proposed methods to derive global explanations from local interpretations of any
black box models [21, 24].

5.1 Spatiotemporal locality of Transmission rate
Similar to as stated in [22] deriving explanations requires optimization of the following function, where G is set of interpretable surrogate models in a locality, 𝑓 is the global model
to be explained, 𝑙𝑥 is the distribution function defining the locality of 𝑥, ℒ is the loss function and 𝛺𝑔 is the complexity of
the model 𝑔.
𝜉(𝑥) = argmin ℒ(𝑓, 𝑔, 𝑙𝑥 ) + Ω𝑔

(16)

𝑔∈𝐺

It is desirable to minimize both Ω𝑔 and ℒ. However, in general they are inversely proportional when the spread of 𝑙 is
large. A very small spread of 𝑙𝑥 is also not desirable as it will
oversimplify g to draw any meaningful explanations in the
locality. Thus, a choice of 𝑙𝑥 is important to derive meaningful
interpretations.
The locality of 𝑥 is defined by a threshold distance in all directions from 𝑥 both spatially and temporally and it is defined
by the following tuple, where 𝑥𝑠 and 𝑥𝑡 are spatial and temporal components of observation 𝑥. 𝑑𝑠 and 𝑑 𝑇 are spatial and
temporal threshold distances from 𝑥 to the boundary of locality.
𝑙(𝑥) = {𝑥𝑠 ± [0, 𝑑𝑠 ), 𝑥𝑡 ± [0, 𝑑 𝑇 )}

(17)

Fig. 6 illustrates spatiotemporal locality of observation 𝑥. Spatial locality is bounded by pixels up to 𝑑𝑠 in all direction from
𝑥𝑠 such that locality of 𝑥𝑠 is bounded by a square box of pixels
of size (2𝑑𝑠 + 1) X (2𝑑𝑠 + 1). No paddings are applied at the
edges. Thus, perimeter defining locality of pixels at the edges
of a frame are trimmed. As illustrated in Fig. 6 temporal locality is also defined similarly. Combining spatial and temporal
locality the local region of observation 𝑥 is defined by a

7

sequence of group of pixels with equal time lead and lag from
𝑥 unless 𝑥 resides on temporal edge of an input tensor in
which case temporal locality is trimmed on the direction of
the edge.
Perturbated data points are generated by randomly perturbing the pixel values of 𝑥 following a uniform distribution. Perturbated distribution is calculated separately for each feature.
The perturbated sample distribution is calculated as follow-

Fig.6. Illustration of spatio temporal locality

ing, where 𝑈(𝑘, 𝑘′) is uniform distribution with upper and
lower bound as 𝑘, 𝑘′, 𝜎(𝑙(𝑥)) is standard deviation of all observations in the locality of 𝑥 and 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑑 randomly selects one
sample from two.
𝑍𝑥 = {𝑥 + 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑑 [𝑈(−1,0)min(𝜎(𝑙(𝑥)), 𝑥),
𝑈(0,1)min(𝜎(𝑙(𝑥)), (1 − 𝑥))]}

(18)

The spatial features are only perturbated spatially and same
values are copied temporally along the corresponding channel. The channels having temporal component are perturbated for different time slice within an input tensor. Each perturbated pixel in a time slice represents a separate feature. Input tensors are constructed using the perturbated values and
passed through the blackbox model 𝑓 to generate a predicted
output value. The set of all input perturbated data points of 𝑥
and the corresponding predicted output values serves as the
training dataset for the surrogate model 𝑔. Each input channels and the predicted values are normalized to 0 mean and 1
standard deviation prior to training the surrogate model.
Normalization is done to convert the features into same scale
so that coefficients of a linear regression surrogate model
gives the relative influence of the features on the response variable. Thus, the loss function is defined as following, where
the function 𝑆 constructs the input tensor in the original representation from perturbated samples.
ℒ(𝑓, 𝑔, 𝑙𝑥 ) = ∑𝑧 ∈ 𝑍𝑥 ℎ(𝑓(𝑆(𝑧))) − 𝑔(ℎ(𝑓(𝑧)), where
ℎ(𝑧) = (𝑧 − 𝑧̅)/𝜎(𝑧)

(19)

Though 𝑍𝑥 can be created by perturbing all features of a pixel
in each channel within an input tensor, however in our analysis only a subset of all features is perturbated to produce 𝑍𝑥
to find effect of those features on transmission rate. Other features are kept constant as per the original observation.

Intuitively this will explain the effect of the chosen features on
the transmission rate in a single pixel area given all other parameters remain constant including feature values of spatio
temporal neighboring pixels.

5.2 Interpreting prediction of Transmission rate
In our analysis 𝑍𝑥 is created by perturbing the following features only. Population density, female fraction, median age,
weather at 4th, 5th and 6th time lag. Weather includes average
daily temperature, 3-day temperature standard deviation and
average daily relative humidity. Apart from the weather features the other three features have no temporal component.
So, for them the perturbated values are copied temporally in
the input tensor during reconstruction. The weather features
from 4th to 6th time lag is chosen by assuming the average incubation period of Sars-Cov-2 between 4 to 6 days. The spatial
(𝑑𝑠 ) and temporal (𝑑 𝑇 ) distance for defining locality is taken
as 1. The perturbated samples for each feature are generated
by equation 18. Local interpretations are carried out for each
pixel which experienced at least 10 cumulative infection cases
on 21st March 2020. The objective is to deduce the influence of
aforementioned features on the transmission rate in each
pixel given all other parameters remains constant. 250 perturbated input samples are generated for each pixel. The samples
are reconstructed in tensor format and fed to the model to obtain the predicted transmission rate and together they form
the input output samples. For each pixel a linear regression
surrogate model is trained with the training samples. The coefficients of each feature denote the influence on the transmission rate.
Fig. 7 illustrated the feature influence chart for different pixels
in grid 387. We choose grid 387 as it experienced highest number of cumulative infection cases with nearly 10% of total infection cases in USA as of 1st May 2020. Only those coefficients
are plotted which have pvalue < 0.05. The features whose absolute value of median and standard deviation across all days
are less than 0.05, are considered unimportant and filtered out
from the plot. The counties covered by each pixel in grid 387
which have nonzero population is stated in Table 3. The Influence values are smoothed using 3rd degree polynomial. New
York & Bronx have somewhat positive influence of population density (pop den) and female fraction (f perc) on transmission rate. Median age (med age) has positive effect in the
mid period and negative on early and later days. 6th day time
lag temperature (T6 temp) have slight negative effect on later
days. On average Putnam also have positive influence of population density, median age and female fraction. However,
population density and female fraction shows negative influence on later days. 4th time lag and 5th time lag relative humidity (T4 rh & T5 rh) have slight negative impact on average. At
grid level population density and female fraction positively
impacts transmission rate on daily basis. Median age has minor positive impact on earlier days and negative impact on
later days. Fig 7d. shows median of influence across all days
for different pixels in grid 387. Population density and female
fraction have positive impact across all pixels. Median age
closely resembles a sinusoidal curve which implies that its influence varies widely across pixels.
Fig. 8 illustrates the global effects of the features on transmission rate. To generate global interpretations local surrogate

models are built for each pixel with 100 perturbated samples.
For each feature the distribution of influence values for all pixels with nonzero population is plotted against time. Considering the median of the distribution, population density, female fraction has positive impact across all days whereas median age has negative impact. Temperature has minor positive impact, temperature standard deviation has minor negative impact and relative humidity barely have any noticeable
impact on transmission rate. From this study it is clear local
influence of features at pixel and grid level may widely deviate from global average. This is important as spread of infection is highly skewed regionally such that few hotspots contribute majority of the infection cases. Thus, studying the local
influence of features can shed light on the local dynamics of
spread and at the same time global influence charts provides
a general idea of the influence on spread.

infection cases with respect to time with a single peak.
However, transmission rate may vary with respect to multiple external factors including intervention methods like
lockdown. A variable transmission rate may result in periodic subsidence and resurgence of the spread of infection
and in turn producing multiple peaks of active infection
cases along time. Along with this the recovery rate may
also change due to multiple intervention methods like enhancing hospital facilities, improving treatment procedure
etc. As shown in equation 10, recovery rate is very important in achieving disease free stable equilibrium state.
In general, the average removal rate (recovery rate + death
rate) over a period should exceed average transmission
rate in order to reach the disease-free equilibrium. Considering the death rate to be constant and quite small compared to recovery rate of Covid-19, the time required to
reach the equilibrium state is inversely proportional to the
difference between recovery rate and transmission rate. In
our experiments we used the trained model to do long
term forecasting of the epidemic with current normal parameters and compared with an “what if” analysis by
modifying the removal rate.
A 300 days forecasting is carried out for the grid 387. Since
weather features barely impacts transmission rate in grid
387 thus the model trained without weather features is
used for forecasting. “What if” analysis is done by setting
high removal rate to expedite disease-free equilibrium and
compared with current normal forecasting by setting removal rate as running average of past 5 days. In “what if”
analysis removal rate is set as per equation 10 by setting
T = 200 with upper hard limit 0.2. As removal rate
changes daily active infection cases which in turn impacts
future transmission rate and due to upper hard limit of

removal rate the value of 𝜀 in some pixels is less than upper
bound calculated by equation 10. From fig. 9a and 9b it is
evident that number of active infection cases reduced
much faster in the “what if” analysis and most of the pixels

hit near baseline state at least once within 200-day period.
However rapid periodic resurgence of the disease is seen
in this case. As recovery rate has upper hard limit thus in
some cases resurgence with high transmission rate resulted in destabilizing disease-free equilibrium. The
growth is again quickly dampened due to high recovery

rate in future periodic resurgences. This can be empirically
explained by the fact that population gets cautious and
maintains social distancing with low intermixing when infection cases are high and vice versa. Fig. 9c and 9d suggests there is rapid periodic resurgence of new infection
cases in “what if” analysis compared to current normal
and multiple short low new infection periods are seen. The
resurgences in some cases (pixel 85, 101) are stronger compared to current normal. Thus, it is evident, by only increasing recovery rate abruptly, infection spread may not
be controlled fully unless other intervention methods are
adopted to prevent spike of transmission rate during resurgence periods. Fig. 10a and 10b shows the plot of daily
active infections when only pixel 101 and 102 are subjected
to modified recovery rate respectively and other pixels are
set with current normal recovery rate. In both the cases
there is a quick dampening of active cases in 101 and 102
pixels and resurgence spike is shorter and weaker compared to Fig. 9b. It is evident there is spatial influence of
neighboring active cases and transmission rate. One expla-

periodic spikes in future. The current normal scenario suggests unless strict intervention actions are not taken to reduce transmission rate or recovery rate it is going to take
long time to reach the baseline. The trace of new infection
cases suggests the trend is quite similar in both the scenarios with more frequent and stronger spikes in “what if”
scenario. In current normal scenario the model estimates
487254 new infection cases and 711040 removed cases in
300-day period. In “what if” scenario it estimates 549158
new infection cases and 909437 removed cases. However,
Fig. 11c suggests most of the removal happens in initial 50
days of forecast period due to abrupt increase of removal
rate in forecast period. In real world such abrupt increase
of removal rate may not be possible. However, on an average if the difference between removal rate and transmission rate can be maintained as per equation 10 it is possible
to dampen the spread of infection within desired time period. Though in our analysis we took removal in strict
sense however it may not refer to complete recovery. Identification and complete isolation of a patient such that there
is negligible chance of further spread of the infection from
the patient may also be referred to removal. Thus, maintaining high recovery rate, rapid and strict isolation of infected patient and intervention methods to reduce transmission rate are the keys to rapid convergence to diseasefree equilibrium.

CONCLUSION

A thorough study on the transmission rate of Covid19 in
USA revealed several insights. Key influencers are identified. However, there might be other influencers like human
mobility, demographics, government interventions etc. On
availability of those feature data, proposed methods may
be applied to find influences. These methods can also be
applied to other countries. Though a threshold condition is
derived for disease free equilibrium, yet it is not straightforward to determine ideal recovery rate to rapidly
dampen the infection spread due to complex dependency
of transmission rate. A general solution method may be investigated to solve this optimization problem and come up
with ideal regional recovery rate.
