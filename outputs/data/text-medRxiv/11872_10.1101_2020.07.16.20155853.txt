Currently, there is a need for reliable tests that allow identification of individuals that have been
infected with SARS-CoV-2 even if the infection was asymptomatic. To date, the vast majority
of the serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies are based on serum detection of
antibodies to either the viral spike glycoprotein (the major target for neutralising antibodies) or
the viral nucleocapsid protein that are known to be highly immunogenic in other coronaviruses.
Conceivably, exposure of antigens released from infected cells could stimulate antibody
responses that might correlate with tissue damage and, hence, they may have some value as
a prognostic indicator. We addressed whether other non-structural viral proteins, not
incorporated into the infectious viral particle, specifically the viral cysteine-like protease, might
also be potent immunogens. Using ELISA tests, coating several SARS-CoV-2 proteins
produced in vitro, we describe that COVID-19 patients make high titre IgG, IgM and IgA
antibody responses to the Cys-like protease from SARS-CoV-2, also known as 3CLpro or
Mpro, and it can be used to identify individuals with positive serology against the coronavirus.
Higher antibody titres in these assays associated with more severe disease and no crossreactive antibodies against prior betacoronavirus were found. Remarkably, IgG antibodies
specific for Mpro and other SARS-CoV-2 antigens can also be detected in saliva. In
conclusion, Mpro is a potent antigen in infected patients that can be used in serological tests
and its detection in saliva could be the basis for a rapid, non-invasive test for COVID-19
seropositivity.

INTRODUCTION

56

The identification of the link between a novel beta-coronavirus strain, named

57

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoronaVirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), and a fatal

58

respiratory illness, COVID-19, formally recognised as a pandemic by the WHO on

59

March 11 (1, 2) has led to a rush by health systems all over the world to develop and

60

implement testing for viral infection. The rapid cloning and sequencing of the viral

61

genome permitted the development of PCR-based assays for the detection of viral

62

nucleic acids that have become a key strategy for both clinical diagnosis and

63

epidemiological monitoring studies. However, besides identifying individuals with

64

active infection, it is also necessary to know which patients, either symptomatic or

65

asymptomatic, have developed an antibody response to the virus. Several reasons

66

make SARS-CoV-2 serology tests crucial. First, PCR testing is not 100% efficient, (3-

67

5). Second, testing for viral RNA cannot detect evidence of past infection, which will

68

be crucial for epidemiological efforts to assess how many people have been infected

69

in any given area. In addition, this will allow definition of the infection fatality rate and

70

help with management of the epidemic. Third, assays to measure antibody responses

71

and determine seroconversion, while not appropriate to detect acute infections, are

72

however, valuable sources of information on the quality of the response exerted by

73

different individuals developing different clinical manifestations. Moreover, if different

74

isotypes and viral antigens are included in assays testing different time points after the

75

onset of the disease, information of clinical importance will be produced. Finally,

76

quantitative and qualitative assays of antibody responses can aid in the identification

77

of factors that correlate with effective immunity to SARS-CoV-2, the duration of these

78

immune responses and may also aid in the selection of donors from whom

79

preparations of convalescent serum/plasma can be generated for therapeutic use.

80

Multiple antibody tests to detect exposure to SARS-CoV-2, are becoming available.

81

The majority of these assays have been optimised to detect immunoglobulin G (IgG)

82

and, in some cases, IgM antibodies using different viral antigens, being the Spike (S)

83

protein and the nucleoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 the more widely used (6, 7). These

84

proteins are key elements of the viral particle and are expected, by analogy with other

85

coronaviruses, to be highly immunogenic. However, the immunogenicity of other viral

86

proteins, 28 are encoded in the viral genome, has been little explored. Here we have

87

studied the antibody response to the main viral protease (Mpro, or 3CLPro) elicited

88

after viral infection. Although this protein is not exposed in the viral particle, Mpro

89

carries out a critical role in viral replication. Like other beta-coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-

90

2 is a positive-sense RNA virus that expresses all of its proteins as a single polypeptide

91

chain and Mpro cleaves the 1ab polyprotein to yield the rest of the mature proteins of

92

the virus. Since this activity is essential for the viral life cycle, Mpro structure and

93

function has been studied intensively (8); in particular, Mpro has been suggested as a

94

target for specific inhibitors that might act as potent anti-viral agents (9). However, to

95

our knowledge, no study on the antigenicity of this protease has been reported.

96

To increase the possibilities of diagnosing COVID-19 patients, here we report the

97

use of an ELISA test involving the assay of sero-reactivity to three different SARS-

98

CoV-2 antigens, including the protease Mpro. These data demonstrate that individuals

99

who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 make high titre antibody responses to Mpro

100

and that assays for seroreactivity to this protein sensitively and specifically

101

discriminate between infected and non-infected individuals. Further, while most

102

available tests assess for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG antibodies, here, we also

103

explored the presence of IgA antibodies in the sera tested. While, in general, assays

104

for IgM antibodies resulted in a high background that limited the sensitivity of the

105

ELISA, testing for IgA seropositivity provided very clean data, with low background

106

and high signal, therefore providing a very good tool to complement IgG assays.

107

Interestingly, considerable significant amounts of IgA antibodies specific for MPro, as

108

well as the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) and NP, were also frequently found in

109

serum of COVID-19 infected individuals and the amounts of IgA and IgM antibodies

110

could be related with disease severity.

111

Surprisingly, IgG antibodies specific for SARS-CoV-2 antigens were also readily

112

detectable in the saliva of these patients and, in this case, the titre of protease-specific

113

antibodies was higher than for the other two proteins tested. Since the nasal and

114

buccal mucosa are key sites of viral infection and replication, the presence of

115

antibodies in saliva may be an important feature of the virus-specific immune

116

response, but this observation may also allow the development of a rapid, completely

117

non-invasive assay for COVID-19 seropositivity.

RESULTS

119
120

Mpro-specific antibodies can be detected in serum of COVID-19 patients by ELISA

121

Since this study evaluated, for the first time, whether coronavirus-infected individuals could

122

generate an antibody response against the Cys-like protease, MPro, other SARS-CoV-2

123

proteins, commonly used in serology tests, were produced, for comparison. Mpro and NP were

124

expressed in E coli, and two different constructs of the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the

125

spike protein were used: one was expressed by transfection in mammalian cells (mRBD) and

126

a second, produced by baculovirus infection of insect cells (iRBD-His). All the proteins, except

127

mRBD, had a histidine-tag and they were purified on Ni2+-NTA columns followed by size

128

exclusion chromatography (Figure 1).

129
130

Before testing a large number of sera from COVID-19 patients and healthy donors,

131

experiments were designed to optimize coating and dilution conditions. These data already

132

revealed that COVID-19 patient sera contained high titres of Mpro-specific antibodies.

133

Antibody reactivity to the viral protease reached saturation at relatively low concentrations and

134

discriminated efficiently between individuals who had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and

135

those that had not been exposed to the virus (Figure 2A). Serum dilutions from 1/50 to 1/1600

136

covered a broad range of reactivity to Mpro from almost no recognition to saturation (reached

137

at 1/100 dilution). It was also possible to detect low titres of antibodies of the IgM and IgA

138

isotypes in these patients (Figure 2B), suggesting that, in subsequent experiments, a large

139

screening of patient samples should be performed including the three Ig subclasses. Coating

140

titration experiments further confirmed the specificity of the assay (Figure 2C). The IgG

141

reactivity against the protease MPro in COVID-19 patients was comparable, or in certain cases

142

stronger, to the reactivity against RBD, however, no differences were noticed between the

143

RBD recombinant proteins expressed in either mammalian cells or baculovirus

144

(Supplementary Figure 1). These initial experiments suggested that the humoral response

145

against the three viral proteins can be heterogeneous between different patients.

146

To further validate the assay, additional controls were performed such as monitoring the

147

background in plates with no viral antigen coating and testing sera collected before the

148

COVID-19 pandemic (Supplementary Figure 2).

152

Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro-specific antibodies identifies COVID-19 seropositive

153

individuals with high specificity and sensitivity

154

A cohort of 36 COVID-19 patients (PCR+) and 33 healthy donors was recruited at La Princesa

155

University Hospital, Madrid (Table 1) and ELISA assays were performed to detect Mpro-, as

156

well as RBD- and NP-, specific antibodies of the IgG, IgA and IgM subclasses in sera (Figure

157

3).

158

Titration of the serum samples was carried out over a dilution range of 1/50 to1/3200, and these

159

experiments showed that assay for seropositivity to all three antigens discriminated between

160

COVID-19 positive and negative donors, as shown in dot plots comparing different dilutions

161

(Supplementary Figure 3). Figure 3 summarises the absorbance data from all the sera samples.

162

To estimate the cut-off value, the sensitivity, and the specificity parameters for each antigen/Ig

163

isotype pair, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were performed (Table 2, Figure 4).

164

The best area under the curve (AUC) values were obtained with the measurement of IgG

165

antibodies specific for Mpro and NP (AUCs= 0.9945 and 0.9927, respectively). The sensitivity and

166

specificity was above 90% for detection of IgG antibodies of the three proteins tested, with values

167

of sensitivity and specificity for Mpro of 97% and 100% respectively. AUC values above 0.85 were

168

obtained for the other isotypes (IgA, IgM). Measurement of anti-IgA antibodies appeared to

169

discriminate less accurately between pre-COVID-19 sera and COVID-19 sera, however, this is not

170

due to a lack in sensitivity for this isotype. Instead, because background levels with IgA were very

171

low and the signal clearly positive in some patients, the lack of detection suggests that certain

172

COVID-19-positive patients have circulating IgA while other COVID-19-positive patients lack IgA

173

in peripheral blood. Whether the presence of IgA in periphery has any relationship with clinical

174

aspects needs to be explored further in larger cohorts of patients.

175
176

Comparison between proteins showed some heterogeneity in the capacity of different donors to

177

produce antibodies, especially for IgM and IgA subclasses. Non-linear polynomial regression

178

showed a better correlation between the detection of antibodies against NP and Mpro compared

179

to NP and RBD or MPro and RBD (Figure 5A). Only one COVID-19 donor failed to make a full

180

antibody response.

181
182

Further analyses were performed to explore the correlations between the titres of the different

183

antibodies in serum and clinical parameters. Interestingly, a trend for higher titre antibody

184

responses was found in patients with more severe disease (Figure 5B), being more pronounced

185

for IgM against Mpro and IgG against RBD. However, several other variables also contributed to

186

the heterogeneity in antibody response, mainly age and time since the onset of symptoms (Table

187

3). After adjustment for these possibly confounding factors, IgA anti-RBD was observed to be

188

significantly higher in critical patients compared to patients with mild disease. In addition, critical

189

patients showed a trend to higher IgM and IgA anti-Mpro titres than patients with mild COVID-19.

190

Furthermore, intense IgM and IgA responses against the three proteins were significantly

191

associated with higher serum IL-6 levels (data not shown).

192
193

Importantly, in the experiments reported here no SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies were detected

194

in more than 70 serum samples collected pre-pandemic. However, the majority of these pre-

195

COVID-19 sera did contain antibodies against the nucleoprotein from the related HCoVOC43

196

betacoronavirus, that causes mild common cold-like diseases (Figure 6). Thus these data

197

demonstrate that prior infection with another coronavirus does not seem to lead to the generation

198

of antibodies cross-reactive with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

199
200

Therefore, the use of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, in combination with other antigens already described

201

for serology tests, provided outstanding specificity and sensitivity for patient identification. IgG

202

titrated further than IgA or IgM indicating that, as expected, the IgG subclass is more abundant

203

in serum. Assay for IgM antibodies had a lower signal/noise ratio and, in many of the SARS-

204

CoV-2 negative sera a significant background could be observed for IgM. In contrast, SARS-

205

CoV-2-specific IgA antibodies were not detected in healthy donors, but were clearly present

206

in 27 out of the 36 sera tested from COVID-19 patients.

207
208

Mpro-specific IgG antibodies are detected in saliva from COVID-19 patients

209

Saliva samples were collected from 11 healthy donors and 12 COVID-19 patients at the

210

University Hospital La Princesa (Madrid) and tested in ELISA assays over a range of

211

dilutions (1/2 to 1/10). IgG recognizing the three viral antigens tested could be observed in

212

COVID-19 patients, with the strongest responses being those specific for the viral protease

213

Mpro (Figure 7). IgA responses were detected in only one of the COVID-19 infected

214

individuals (data not shown).

216

DISCUSSION

217

The results presented here describe the detection of antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2

218

protease, Mpro, in serum from COVID-19 patients. The titres of Mpro-specific antibodies were

219

comparable to those produced against SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein and somewhat higher than

220

the antibody responses to the RBD fragment of the Spike glycoprotein, both of which are

221

generally considered immunogenic coronavirus proteins. These high titre antibody responses

222

in serum were accompanied by the detection of Mpro-specific IgG antibodies in saliva,

223

providing a new opportunity for completely, non-invasive diagnostic tests.

224

For IgG antibodies in sera, the titres of NP and Mpro-specific antibodies correlate very well

225

with each other (r=0.94 y p<10-4) and also with anti-RBD responses (r=0.89 y p<10-4). In

226

contrast, while NP- and Mpro-specific antibody titres also correlate well for IgA and IgM

227

responses (r values greater than 0.9), the correlation with IgM and IgA for RBD is much weaker

228

(r values around 0.6). One plausible possibility is that the antibody responses to internal

229

antigens, Mpro and NP, correlate well, since production of antibodies against these proteins

230

requires either viruses with a broken membrane or release of viral material from infected cells.

231

The correlation with clinical data and symptoms onset reveals that antibodies have higher

232

titres as the severity of the disease increases. Although the sample size is not large, this

233

correlation was significant and independent of age and time from the beginning of symptoms

234

for anti-RBD IgA and almost significant for anti-Mpro IgM and IgA. The retrospective design of

235

our study does not allow to determine whether these increased levels are cause or

236

consequence of more severe disease and what is the basis of its relationship with higher levels

237

of IL-6 detected in critical patients. In this regard, it is surprising that IgM persisted at high

238

levels in patients’ sera for more than a month after the beginning of symptoms.

239

The finding that the protease Mpro can be antigenic opens a new series of questions on the

240

biology of this protein that is an important target for the development of antivirals to block

241

SARS-CoV-2 replication. Mpro is key for cleavage and activation of the first polypeptide

242

translated after infection, but the protein has not been found in the virion. So, most probably,

243

the generation of antibodies directed against Mpro occurs at the end of the viral life cycle when

244

intracellular antigens are released from the infected cell. It is not clear whether antibodies

245

specific for Mpro might interfere with viral replication directly, however B cells producing these

246

antibodies would likely efficiently internalise and present this antigen to stimulate T cell

247

recognition of peptides from intracellular proteins.

248

The data presented here also show that, while antibodies for another betacoronavirus,

249

HCoVOC43, were found frequently in pre-COVID19 sera, SARS-Cov-2-specific antibodies were

250

undetectable, demonstrating that infection with one coronavirus does not necessarily prime for a

251

better antibody response to another, at least for the viral antigens tested in these assays.

252

Sequence analysis also suggests that it is unlikely that the response detected against NP and

253

Mpro is due to cross-reactivity between coronavirus-specific antibodies. While COVID-19 Mpro

254

has 96% homology with the main protease of SARS-CoV, which emerged in China in 2003, the

255

similarity with other coronaviruses is much lower. All the samples analysed in this study came from

256

hospitals in Spain, where no cases of SARS-CoV-1 have been reported. The similarity between

257

the Cys-like proteases (Mpro) of different coronaviruses: SARS-CoV-2, HCovNL63,

258

HCoVOC43 and HCov229E similarity is only around 40% with changes and similarities

259

distributed along the whole sequence (Supplementary Figure 4).

260
261

A remarkable observation is that SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies can be detected in the saliva

262

of seropositive individuals. Two major antibody classes are found in saliva: secretory IgA

263

(SIgA), synthesized locally by plasma cells (PCs) in salivary glands and IgG that is mainly

264

derived from serum via gingival crevices (10). In our experiments salivary SARs-CoV-2

265

antibodies were mainly IgG rather than IgA; only one out of 12 individuals with SARS2-specific

266

IgA was observed, corresponding to a donor that had recovered from the disease one month

267

before the saliva test. The observation that COVID-19-positive, but not COVID-19-negative,

268

individuals contain robustly detectable levels of SARS-CoV-2 NP and Mpro-specific antibodies

269

in saliva is interesting because the development and validation of a saliva-based assay for

270

SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity would represent a practical, non-invasive alternative to blood-

271

based assays for COVID-19 diagnostic testing that might complement saliva-based nucleic

272

acid tests for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid.

gacctcgagtatttctgaggtgtcttcagtatag -3´were used to amplify the nucleocapsid protein of

289

HCoVOC43. The amplification product was then digested with NcoI and XhoI and ligated into

290

the pET26b vector (Novagen) digested with NcoI and XhoI.

291

The integrity of all constructs was verified by sequencing at MWG Eurofins.

Expression of the SARS-CoV-2 Cys-like protease (Mpro) and nucleocapsid (NP)

293

proteins

294
295

Recombinant viral proteins were expressed in the E. coli strain BL21 Star (DE3) pLysS
(ThermoFisher).

296

SARS-CoV-2 Mpro protein was expressed by transforming this plasmid into the E. coli

297

strain BL21 Star (DE3) pLysS. Transformed clones were pre-cultured overnight at room

298

temperature in 50 mL 1 x LB medium with ampicillin (150 μg/mL) and chloramphenicol

299

(34ug/ml). The overnight culture was then inoculated into 1L of 1 x LB medium (150 μg/mL

300

ampicillin and 34ug/ml chloramphenicol) and the culture was grown at 37oC with agitation until

301

the OD600 reached 0.6 when Isopropyl-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) was added to 1mM to induce

302

overexpression of the Mpro gene. The same protocol was followed to produce the

303

nucleocapsid proteins except that kanamycin (150ug/ml) was used instead of ampicillin for

304

antibiotic-mediated selection.

305

After overnight culture at 22oC for NP, 3h at 37oC for Mpro, bacteria were harvested

306

by centrifugation at 9500 x g, 4°C for 15 min and the pellets were washed by resuspension in

307

150 mL TES buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8, 2mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl) and re-centrifugation.

308

Washed pellets were either processed immediately or stored frozen for later use.

309

Fresh, or thawed, cell pellets were resuspended in ice.cold 50 mM NaH2PO4 buffer

310

pH8, 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole (I2399, Sigma Aldrich), 0.1% Sarkosyl, and 5% glycerol

311

(pH 8.0). Lysozyme was then added (to 0.25 mg/ml) as were phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride,

312

Leupeptin and Pepstatin A (all to a final concentration of 1mM) and DNase I (2 µg/ml). Bacteria

313

were lysed by sonication (3 cycles of 30 seconds with 30 seconds rest on ice between pulses)

314

and soluble proteins were separated by centrifugation of the lysed cells at 14,000g at 4 °C for

315

45 minutes.

316

6-histidine tagged proteins were purified from the lysate using Nickel Affinity Cartridges

317

5ml (Agarose Bead Technologies S.L.). The bacterial supernatant was loaded on the column

318

at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, followed by washing with 5 column volumes of 50 mM NaH2PO4

319

buffer, 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole and then 5 column volumes of 50 mM NaH2PO4 buffer,

320

500 mM NaCl, 25 mM imidazole. Recombinant proteins were eluted using a linear gradient of

321

imidazole ranging from 25 mM to 250 mM over 5 column volumes (a representative SDS-

322

PAGE analysis of the eluted fractions is shown in Supplementary Figure 1A). The proteins

323

were then further purified by gel filtration using a 10/30 Superdex 75 Increase column (Cytiva)

324

pre-equilibrated in 20mM HEPES, 1mM EDTA, 300mM NaCl, pH 7.5. The gel filtration analysis

325

indicated that the SARS CoV 2 Mpro protein purified as a dimer.

326
327

Molecular cloning and production of SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain protein in

328

mammalian cells (mRBD)

329

The cDNA region coding for the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) (residues 334–528)

330

defined in the structure of the S protein (PDB ID 6VSB) was amplified for expression in

331

mammalian cells. The fragment was cloned in frame with the IgK leader sequence, an HA-

332

tag (YPYDVPDYA) and a thrombin recognition site (LVPRGS) at its 5’ end, and it was followed

333

by a second thrombin site, the TIM-1 mucin domain and the human IgG1 Fc region at the 3’

334

end. The recombinant cDNA was cloned in a vector derived from the pEF-BOS (11) for

335

transient expression in HEK293 cells, and in the pBJ5-GS vector for stable protein production

336

in CHO cells following the glutamine synthetase system (12). The inclusion of the TIM-1 mucin

337

domain enhanced protein expression.

338

Mammalian RBD (mRBD) fused to the mucin domain and the Fc region (mRBD-

339

mucin-Fc) was initially purified from cell supernatants by affinity chromatography using an

340

IgSelect column (GE Healthcare). The mucin-Fc portion and the HA-tag were released from

341

the mRBD protein by overnight treatment with thrombin at RT. The mixture was run through

342

a protein A column to remove the mucin-Fc protein and mRBD was further purified by size-

343

exclusion chromatography with a Superdex 75 column in HBS buffer (25 mM HEPES and

344

150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5). The concentration of purified mRBD was determined by absorbance

345

at 280 nm.

346

Baculovirus production of RBD-His tagged protein

347

A recombinant baculovirus expressing the RBD domain was generated using a

348

pFastBac Dual-derived plasmid harboring the RBD coding sequence kindly provided by Dr. F.

349

Krammer (6). HighFive (ThermoFisher Scientific) cell cultures were infected with the

350

recombinant virus at a multiplicity of infection of 3 plaque forming units per cell and maintained

351

in TC-100 medium (ThermoFisher Scientific) for 72 h. Thereafter, cell medium was harvested

352

and clarified by centrifugation (4,300 x g for 10 min) and filtration through a 0.45 µm filter.

353

Supernatant was loaded onto a chelated Nickel Affinity Cartridge-5ml (Agarose Bead

354

Technologies S.L.) at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min and eluted with a linear gradient of 500 mM

355

Imidazole in Tris-saline buffer pH 7.5. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and those

356

containing RBD were pooled together and concentrated using an Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal

357

unit with a 10 kDa cutoff membrane (Millipore). The concentrated protein was loaded onto a

358

Superdex 75 10/300 Increase gel-filtration (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with PBS. The peak

359

fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and pooled together for further analysis.

360

ELISA for detection of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2

361

96-well Maxisorp Nunc-Immuno plate were coated with 100 μL/well of recombinant

362

proteins diluted in 0.1 M borate buffered saline (BBS) pH 8.8; NP and the protease at 0.5

363

μg/ml, RBD at 1μg/ml and incubated overnight at 4oC. Coating solutions were then aspirated,

364

the ELISA plates were washed three times with 200 μl of PBS 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T) and

365

then dried before blocking with PBS-casein (Biorad,1x PBS blocker) for 1 hour at room

366

temperature. The plates were washed again with PBS-T and 100 μl of patient serum/plasma

367

sample diluted in PBS-casein, 0.02% Tween-20, as indicated, was added and incubated for 2

368

hours at room temperature. The plates were washed again and 100 μL/well of the indicated

369

detection antibody [(AffiniPure Rabbit Anti-Human IgM, Fcµ fragment specific; AffiniPure

370

Rabbit Anti-Human Serum IgA, α chain specific; AffiniPure Rabbit Anti-Human IgG, Fcγ

371

373

were washed with PBS-T four times and incubated at room temperature in the dark with 100

374

μL/well of Substrate Solution (OPD, Sigma prepared according to the manusfacturer’s

375

376

each well and the optical density (at 492nm) of each well was determined using a microplate

377

reader.

378

Negative controls included wells coated just with blocking buffer and serum samples

379

collected from donors before 2019.

380

Statistical analysis

381

Graphics and statistical analysis was performed with Graph Pad Prism 8 Software (GraphPad

382

Software, USA, www.graphpad.com) and Stata 14.0 for Windows (Stata Corp LP, College

383

Station, TX, USA). Quantitative variables following a non-normal distribution were represented

384

as median and interquartile range (IQR) and the Mann Whitney test was used to test for

385

statistically significant differences. Variables with a normal distribution were described by

386

mean±standard deviation (SD) and differences between groups were assessed with Student’s

387

t-test. Qualitative variables were described as counts and proportions and 𝟀2 or Fisher´s exact

388

test was used for comparisons. Correlation between quantitative variables was analysed using

389

the Pearson correlation test.

390

Severity of COVID-19 was established as previously described (13). In this case, to determine

391

differences in titres of antibodies between groups of severity the Cuzick’s test, that assesses

392

trends across ordered groups, was employed.

393

Since several variables might contribute to differences in ELISA titres, multivariable linear

394

analysis using generalized linear models (glm command of Stata) in which the dependent

395

variable were ELISA titres of each isotype against each protein. The first model included age,

396

gender and time from symptoms onset, followed by backward stepwise approach removing all

397

variables with a p value >0.15 to obtain the best model for each protein and isotype. Then, the

398

variable of interest (severity, anosmia or IL-6 serum levels) was forced in the model.

399

To determine the capacity of the different ELISA to discriminate between pre-COVID-19 sera

400

and those sera obtained from patients with SARS-CoV-2, as determined by positive PCR from

401

nasopharyngeal exudates, ROC analysis was performed, using the roctab command of Stata

402

14.1® (College Station, Texas). Each cut-off point was selected based on the best trade-off

403

values between sensitivity, specificity and the percentage of patients correctly classified. ROC

404

curves and area under curve (AUC) were also obtained.

COVID] approved by La Princesa Health Research Institute (IIS-IP) Research Ethics

410

Committee (register # 4070). Some experiments included patients from “Study of the

411

lymphocytic response against SARS-COV-2, in different situations of host health and COVID-

412

19 severity (InmunoCOVID)” approved by the Hospital La Paz Committee (HULP: PI-4101).

413

All experiments were carried out following the ethical principles established in the Declaration

414

of Helsinki. All included patients (or their representatives) were informed about the study and

415

gave a written informed consent.

416

Patient selection

417

36 COVID-19 patients, diagnosed by PCR, were recruited for the study. 9 of them presented

418

active infection by SARS-CoV2 at the moment of the study whereas the rest had no detectable

419

levels of the virus. 10 patients required hospitalization, of which 6 were admitted to the ICU

420

(Table 1). 33 serum samples from patients presenting a monoclonal gammopathy, allergic

421

disease or rheumatoid arthritis, collected before June 2019 (PRE-COVID-19), were used as

422

negative controls. All samples were stored frozen before use.

423
424
425

Antibody detection in saliva samples

426

12 donors with high antibody titres in serum were selected to measure specific IgG and IgA

427

against SARS-CoV2 in saliva. For this purpose, new saliva samples were collected from these

428

patients, and also from 11 healthy donors, aliquoted and immediately frozen. Prior to use,

429

saliva samples were thawed, centrifuged at 400g and diluted 1/2, 1/4 and 1/10 in 1x PBS with

430

1% casein (Bio-Rad) and 0.02% Tween-20 supplemented with Complete™ Protease Inhibitor

431

Figure 1. SARS-CoV-2 protein purification. Nucleocapsid (NP) (A) and Cys-like protease

513

(3CLpro, Mpro) (B) proteins were expressed in E. coli and extracted from the soluble fraction

514

of the bacterial pellet. The proteins were firstly purified by selection through their His-tags in

515

HiTrap Ni2+ chelating columns. The fractions eluted from these columns were run in SDS-

516

PAGE (top gels). After that, proteins were further purified by gel filtration using a Superdex 75

517

column and fractions eluted from this step were run in SDS-PAGE (bottom gels). The FPLC

518

profile is shown on the right panels. (C) mRBD The 334-528 fragment of the Spike protein was

519

produced in mammalian cells fused to an HA-tag, at the N-terminus and to the TIM-1 mucin

520

domain followed by the Fc portion of human IgG, at the C-terminus. Two thrombin-recognition

521

sites (asterisks) were introduced. The fusion protein was treated with thrombin (+T in the

522

SDS-PAGE shown at the right) to release the mRBD fragment. It was further purified using a

523

protein A column and size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 75). SDS-PAGE under

524

reducing conditions are shown for the samples at the purification steps. Proteins bound (B)

525

and unbound (U) to the protein A column are shown. (D) SDS-PAGE. After expression in the

526

different systems, proteins were purified and fractions from gel filtration chromatography were

527

run in SDS-PAGE under non reducing conditions.

Figure 2. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro-specific antibodies by ELISA. (A) Sera titration

530

on Mpro. Plates were coated with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and sera dilutions (1/50 to 1/1600) were

531

tested. Detection was performed using anti-human F(ab)2’ antibody. (B) Isotype recognition.

532

Plates coated with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, nucleoprotein (NP) and RBD were detected with

533

antibodies directed against human Ig of the three different subclasses: IgG, IgA, IgM. Black

534

symbols correspond to COVID-19 patients and grey symbols to donors pre-COVID-19. (C)

Coating titration. Plates were coated with increasing amounts of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro,

536

nucleoprotein (NP) and RBD and sera diluted 1/100 for IgG detection and 1/50 for IgA and

537

IgM were tested. Black symbols correspond to COVID-19 patients and grey symbols to donors

pre-COVID-19.

542

perform ELISA tests on 36 COVID-19 positive and 33 negative control sera (obtained before

543

the pandemic outbreak, PRE-COVID-19). Detection was done using antibodies directed

544

against human immunoglobulin of the three different subclasses: IgG, IgA, IgM. Sera dilutions

Comparison of sera from mild, severe and critical patients. Patients were classified into

562

three groups (mild n=13, severe n=17 and critical n=6) according to COVID-19 symptoms

563

severity (see reference 13). Data normalised for each antigen using the signal obtained

564

against a pool of positive sera obtained in Figure 2, are depicted in box and whisker plots at

Figure 6. No cross-reactivity is observed between proteins from SARS-Cov-2 and OC43

569

betacoronaviruses. Plates were coated with 0.5 μg/ml of either SARS-CoV-2 NP or OC43

570

NP as indicated. Sera collected before 2020 (Pre-COVID-19) were tested at a 1/100 dilution.

571

Detection was performed using antibody directed against human IgG. The bars labelled “2721-

572

0848” correspond to COVID-19 PCR+ sera; the wells in which the amount of coated protein

573

was tested by incubation with either anti-His are indicated. 13 out of 20 (65%) pre-COVID sera

574

and 4 out of 7 (57%) COVID-19+ were clearly seropositive for OC43 NP. The donors with

575

higher titres for OC43 anti-NP antibodies do not respond against SARS-NP, indicating that

576

prior infection with OC43 does not lead to generation of antibodies reactive with SARS-CoV-

577

2 antigens.
