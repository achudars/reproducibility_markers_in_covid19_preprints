19

Single and multiple doses of molnupiravir were evaluated in this first-in-human, phase 1,

20

randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in healthy volunteers, which included

21

evaluation of the effect of food on pharmacokinetics.

22

EIDD-1931 appeared rapidly in plasma, with a median time of maximum observed concentration

23

of 1.00 to 1.75 hours, and declined with a geometric half-life of approximately 1 hour, with a

24

slower elimination phase apparent following multiple doses or higher single doses (7.1 hours at

25

the highest dose tested). Mean maximum observed concentration and area under the

26

concentration versus time curve increased in a dose-proportional manner, and there was no

27

accumulation following multiple doses. When administered in a fed state, there was a decrease in

28

the rate of absorption, but no decrease in overall exposure.

29

Molnupiravir was well tolerated. Fewer than half of subjects reported an adverse event, the

30

incidence of adverse events was higher following administration of placebo, and 93.3% of

31

adverse events were mild. One discontinued early due to rash. There were no serious adverse

32

events and there were no clinically significant findings in clinical laboratory, vital signs, or

33

electrocardiography. Plasma exposures exceeded expected efficacious doses based on scaling

34

from animal models; therefore, dose escalations were discontinued before a maximum tolerated

35

dose was reached.

Introduction

39

A novel coronavirus, originally identified in Wuhan City, China, was reported to the World

40

Health Organization on 31 December 2019 (1) and the associated disease has subsequently

41

become a worldwide pandemic. An effective antiviral therapeutic has since been intensively

42

sought.

43

The causative agent of the current pandemic, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

44

(SARS-CoV-2), is a sister clade to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV),

45

the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). SARS emerged in Guangdong,

46

China in 2002, causing over 700 deaths among over 8000 cases. The severity of this epidemic in

47

2002-2003 was limited by the relatively low transmissibility of SARS-CoV and association of

48

peak viremia with clinical symptoms rather than a prodromal phase (2); however, the epidemic

49

demonstrated the potential for the rapid spread of an infectious disease in a highly connected and

50

interdependent world. This risk was emphasized when another novel coronavirus, the Middle

51

East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), the causative agent of Middle East

52

respiratory syndrome (MERS), emerged in 2012 and resulted in a localized epidemic in 2014.

53

SARS-CoV-2 has now established itself globally in the human population. Thus, there is an

54

urgent need for an effective, oral antiviral that can be manufactured and broadly distributed on a

55

scale adequate to meet global need. Such a therapy could prevent deaths, reduce disease severity,

56

reduce hospital admission times and thus lessen stress on healthcare resources, potentially limit

57

the spread of SARS-CoV-2, and ameliorate the global and economic disruption that was initiated

58

by the Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

59

COVID-19 may be asymptomatic, mild, severe, life-threatening, or fatal. While the majority of

60

cases can be managed in an outpatient setting, patients with risk factors including advanced age,

61

cardiovascular and pulmonary comorbidities, diabetes, obesity, chronic kidney disease, and

62

cancer are at higher risk of developing more severe disease that may require hospitalization or

63

may result in death and severe morbidity. Asymptomatic carriers and those with mild disease

64

may spread the disease to those at high risk and may subsequently suffer less common and

65

emerging medium-to-longer term sequelae, such as multi-system inflammatory syndrome in

66

children or prolonged cardiopulmonary compromise in otherwise healthy adults (3). Healthcare

67

utilization stresses in regions with outbreaks, quarantines, school closures, and isolation of the

68

elderly may create further disruption and morbidity because of effects on the normal running of

69

hospital services, including cancer referrals and management of chronic conditions. The overall

70

fatality rate is likely higher than for influenza, but estimates are still changing based on emerging

71

data (4). As with other viral respiratory diseases, fatalities are heavily skewed toward older

72

patients and those with risk factors; children are rarely symptomatic and rarely have serious

73

illness.

74

COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory disease, but many extrapulmonary effects and

75

complications have been described. Cough and fever are the most frequent symptoms, followed

76

by myalgia, headache, dyspnea, sore throat, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, and anosmia or ageusia

77

(5). These initial COVID-19 symptoms are not easily distinguished from other respiratory

78

infections such as influenza; therefore, a broad-spectrum treatment would be advantageous for

79

empiric therapy. Complications of COVID-19 include respiratory failure, cardiovascular events,

80

thromboembolic events, and inflammatory damage (6), and respiratory sequelae are anticipated

81

in patients with severe disease (7). Thus, administration of a potent, direct-acting antiviral at

82

various stages of viral replication may reduce not only acute disease symptoms and transmission,

83

but also complications and sequelae of untreated progressive disease.

84

Molnupiravir (also known as EIDD-2801/MK-4482) is a prodrug of the ribonucleoside analog

85

ß-d-N4-hydroxycytidine (EIDD-1931 [NHC]), which is phosphorylated intracellularly to the

86

active 5′-triphosphate. Molnupiravir has demonstrated the potential to treat infections caused by

87

several RNA viruses, including pandemic-capable coronaviruses and influenza viruses, and

88

encephalitic alpha viruses such as Venezuelan, Eastern, and Western equine encephalitis viruses

89

in nonclinical models. The primary mechanism of action of molnupiravir against RNA viruses is

90

viral error catastrophe (8, 9), a concept that is predicated on increasing the viral mutation rate

91

beyond a biologically tolerable threshold, resulting in impairment of viral fitness and leading to

92

viral extinction. Molnupiravir has demonstrated in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 in human

93

airway epithelial cell cultures. Prophylactic and therapeutic administration of molnupiravir to

94

mice infected with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV improved pulmonary function, and reduced virus

95

titer and body weight loss (10). In the ferret influenza model, treatment of pandemic influenza A

96

virus with molnupiravir resulted in reduced viral shedding and inflammatory cellular infiltrates

97

in nasal lavages, with a normal humoral antiviral response (11).

98

Here we report the results of a first-in-human, phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-

99

controlled study to determine the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of single and multiple

100

ascending oral doses of molnupiravir in healthy subjects. A randomized, open-label, crossover

101

evaluation in the fed (high fat) and fasted states was also conducted to assess the effect of food

102

on the pharmacokinetics of single doses of molnupiravir.

103

Results

104

Eligible subjects were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to either study drug or placebo in the single- and

105

multiple-ascending-dose parts of the study. Each cohort comprised 8 subjects, with single oral

106

doses of 50 to 1600 mg administered in the single-ascending-dose part and twice-daily (BID)

107

doses of 50 to 800 mg administered for 5.5 days in the multiple-ascending-dose part. Subjects

108

were followed for 14 days following completion of dosing for assessments of safety, tolerability,

109

and pharmacokinetics. Subjects in the food-effect evaluation were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to

110

either 200 mg molnupiravir in the fed state followed by 200 mg molnupiravir in the fasted state,

111

or vice versa, with a 14-day washout period between doses. A capsule formulation was used in

112

all parts of the study, with the exception of single ascending doses ≤800 mg, where an oral

113

solution formulation was used.

114

Disposition. Sixty-four subjects received a single dose of between 50 and 1600 mg molnupiravir

115

or placebo; 55 subjects received between 50 and 800 mg molnupiravir or placebo BID for 5.5

116

days; and 10 subjects received a single dose of 200 mg molnupiravir in the fed state followed by

117

a single dose of 200 mg molnupiravir in the fasted state after a washout period of 14 days, or

118

vice versa. Additionally, 1 subject in the multiple-ascending-dose part received 800 mg

119

molnupiravir BID for 3 days, but was discontinued from dosing by the investigator on Day 4. All

120

subjects completed the protocol-specified study procedures and assessments.

121

Demography. Subjects were aged between 19 and 60 years, with a mean body mass index

122

between 24.4 and 25.4 kg/m2 (Table 1). The majority of subjects were white and male. There

123

were no other notable differences in subject demography between cohorts, except for age, where

124

the mean age was higher in the food-effect evaluation cohort, the 50-mg molnupiravir single-

125

dose cohort, and in the 100-mg molnupiravir multiple-dose cohort (data not shown).

126

Tolerability. Adverse events were graded using the Division of Microbiology and Infectious

127

Diseases (DMID) toxicity grading, dated March 2014. (i) Single ascending doses. Overall,

128

37.5% of subjects reported an adverse event (Table 2). There were no apparent dose-related

129

trends, with a greater proportion of subjects reporting adverse events following administration of

130

placebo (43.8%) than following administration of molnupiravir (35.4%). Only 1 moderate

131

adverse event (headache; Grade 2) was reported following administration of molnupiravir, which

132

occurred at the 400-mg dose level. One subject also reported moderate adverse events (nausea

133

and headache; Grade 2) following administration of placebo. No severe (Grade 3) adverse events

134

were reported. The most frequently reported adverse event was headache, which was reported by

135

18.8% of subjects who were administered placebo and 12.5% of subjects who were administered

136

molnupiravir. (ii) Multiple ascending doses. Overall, 44.6% of subjects reported an adverse

137

event (Table 3). There were no apparent dose-related trends, with a greater proportion of subjects

138

reporting adverse events following administration of placebo (50.0%) than following

139

administration of molnupiravir (42.9%). With the exception of 1 subject who reported moderate

140

(Grade 2) events of oropharyngeal pain, pain in extremity, and influenza-like illness, all adverse

141

events were mild (Grade 1) in severity. The most frequently reported adverse event was diarrhea,

142

which was reported by 7.1% of subjects who were administered molnupiravir and 7.1% of

143

subjects who were administered placebo. One subject discontinued study drug administration on

144

Day 4 because of an adverse event of mild, truncal, maculopapular, pruritic rash following

145

multiple BID doses of 800 mg molnupiravir, which was considered by the investigator to be

146

related to the study drug. Following discontinuation, the subject was administered potent topical

147

steroid treatment and anti-histamines, and pruritis and rash had both resolved within 18 days. (iii)

148

Food-effect evaluation. Three subjects in the food-effect evaluation each reported 1 adverse

149

event, all of which were mild (Grade 1) in severity.

150

There were no serious adverse events reported in this study and there were no trends of increased

151

frequency or severity of adverse events with higher doses of molnupiravir.

152

Safety. There were no clinically significant findings or dose-related trends in clinical laboratory,

153

vital signs, and electrocardiogram data. The dose-limiting toxicity in one Investigational New

154

Drug-enabling study (in the dog, the most sensitive species) was bone marrow toxicity and

155

included reversible reductions in platelet counts; however, no clinically significant changes in

156

hematological parameters were seen in this study.

157

Dose escalations were discontinued before a maximum tolerated dose was reached because

158

plasma exposures that were expected to be efficacious based on scaling from animal models of

159

seasonal and pandemic influenza were exceeded (11).

160

Pharmacokinetics. (i) Single ascending doses. Concentrations of molnupiravir were generally

161

not quantifiable at doses up to 800 mg, with the exception of the 0.25-hour timepoint after doses

162

of 600 and 800 mg, where concentrations were quantifiable in 5 and 4 subjects, respectively, and

163

the 0.5-hour timepoint after a dose of 800 mg, where concentrations were quantifiable in all

164

subjects. At doses of 1200 and 1600 mg, concentrations of molnupiravir were quantifiable at 1 or

165

more timepoints between 0.25 and 1.5 hours postdose in all subjects. Molnupiravir

166

pharmacokinetic parameters were not calculable for doses ≤400 mg; however, at doses ≥600 mg,

167

maximum observed concentration (Cmax), time of Cmax (tmax), and time of last quantifiable

168

concentration were calculable. Following administration of between 600 and 1600 mg

169

molnupiravir, values of mean Cmax were up to 13.2 ng/mL and values of median tmax were

170

between 0.25 and 0.75 hours (data not shown). It should be noted that molnupiravir

171

concentrations represented only approximately 0.2% of EIDD-1931 concentrations and tmax of

172

molnupiravir occurred at the first sampling timepoint for the 600-mg dose level, and therefore

173

Cmax may have been underestimated. At doses of ≥800 mg, trace amounts of molnupiravir were

174

detected in the urine, which represented approximately 0.002% of the dose (data not shown).

175

Following oral administration of molnupiravir at doses up to 800 mg, EIDD-1931 appeared

176

rapidly in plasma, with a median tmax of 1.00 hour postdose in all dose cohorts, after which

177

plasma concentrations declined in an essentially monophasic manner with geometric mean

178

terminal elimination half-lives (t1/2) of between 0.910 and 1.29 hours postdose (Table 4 and

179

Figure 1). However, at doses of 1200 and 1600 mg, median tmax was delayed, with median tmax

180

occurring at 1.75 and 1.50 hours, respectively. Plasma concentrations at doses of 1200 and

181

1600 mg were quantifiable, along with a second slower elimination phase, where mean t1/2 was

182

longer with values of 1.81 and 4.59 hours, respectively.

183

The plasma concentration-time profiles were generally well defined, with the percentage of area

184

under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 extrapolated to infinity (AUCinf) that was

185

extrapolated being <10% for all subjects. When assessed using a power model (ln[parameter] =

186

intercept + slope x ln[dose] + random error), mean Cmax increased in a dose-proportional manner,

187

with the 90% confidence interval containing unity. Similarly, mean AUCinf increased in an

188

approximately dose-proportional manner; however, the lower bound of the 90% confidence

189

interval was slightly above unity (Table 5).

190

The amount of EIDD-1931 excreted in urine from time 0 to 24 hours postdose (Ae0-24) increased

191

supraproportionally with dose, and there was a similar trend for apparent clearance (CLR) to

192

increase. Between 0.820% (at the 50-mg dose level) and 6.70% (at the 1600-mg dose level) of

193

the dose was excreted in urine as EIDD-1931, and the majority of the total amount was generally

194

excreted within the first 4 hours postdose.

195

(ii) Multiple ascending doses. Concentrations of molnupiravir were generally not quantifiable at

196

doses ≤400 mg BID and pharmacokinetic parameters were not calculable. Concentrations of

197

molnupiravir were quantifiable in 4 subjects at either 0.5 or 1 hour postdose on Day 1 and in 3

198

subjects at 0.5 hours postdose on Day 6 at the 600-mg BID dose level. At the 800-mg dose level,

199

concentrations of molnupiravir were quantifiable from all except 1 subject at 0.5 hours postdose

200

on Days 1 and 6, but at no other timepoints, consistent with single ascending doses.

201

Following oral administration of molnupiravir, EIDD-1931 appeared rapidly in plasma, with a

202

median tmax in all dose cohorts of between 1.00 and 1.75 hours postdose across both Days 1 and

203

6 (Table 6 and Figure 2). For all dose levels, plasma concentrations declined in an essentially

204

monophasic manner on Day 1, with mean t1/2 ranging from 0.918 to 1.18 hours. Similarly,

205

plasma concentrations declined in an essentially monophasic manner on Day 6 for subjects at

206

dose levels ≤200 mg BID and for the majority of subjects at the 300- and 400-mg BID dose

207

levels. Contrastingly, for 1 subject at each of the 300- and 400-mg dose levels and for all

208

subjects at the 600- and 800-mg BID dose levels, there was the emergence of a second, slower

209

elimination phase on Day 6, which was reflected in an increase in the mean t1/2 with increasing

210

dose at doses ≥200 mg. Of note, at the 600-mg BID dose level, the lack of a clearly defined

211

terminal elimination phase confounded the evaluation of t1/2 for the majority of subjects. At the

212

800-mg BID dose level, the mean t1/2 was 7.08 hours.

213

There was no evidence of accumulation, with the geometric mean accumulation ratios based on

214

area under the plasma concentration-time curve during a dosing interval (AUCτ) and Cmax

215

between 0.938 and 1.16, and between 0.843 and 1.10, respectively, across all dose levels.

216

On Day 1, when assessed using the power model, mean Cmax and AUCinf increased in an

217

approximately dose-proportional manner. However, the upper bound of the 90% confidence

218

interval for Cmax was slightly below unity and the lower bound of the 90% confidence interval

219

for AUCinf was slightly above unity (Table 7). On Day 6, mean Cmax increased in a dose-

220

proportional manner, with the 90% confidence interval containing unity. Similarly, mean AUCτ

221

increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner; however, the lower bound of the 90%

222

confidence interval was slightly above unity (Table 7).

223

AUCinf on Day 1 for the multiple-dose cohorts, where a capsule formulation was administered,

224

was similar to those for the corresponding single-dose cohorts where a solution formulation was

225

administered, with geometric mean ratios of between 0.91 and 1.09. Geometric mean Cmax was

226

slightly lower following dosing with the capsule formulation, with geometric mean ratios of

227

between 0.76 and 1.00, and a trend to smaller ratios at higher doses. Median tmax occurred up to

228

0.75 hours later following administration of the capsule formulation, with the difference being

229

greatest at doses ≥600 mg BID. Thus, it appears that the extent of absorption is similar for the

230

solution and capsule formulations, but the rate of absorption appears to be slightly slower for the

231

capsules. However, these data should be interpreted with caution because this was not a

232

crossover study.

233

Between 0.854% and 3.61% of the dose was excreted in urine as EIDD-1931 on both Days 1 and

234

6, and, similar to single doses, the majority was excreted in the first 4 hours postdose (Table 6).

235

There was no consistent dose-related trend in the percentage of dose administered recovered in

236

urine during a dosing interval (Fe0-τ) or CLR at doses ≤200 mg BID. However, there was a trend

237

for Fe0-τ and CLR to increase with dose at doses >200 mg BID, with a 4-fold increase in dose

238

from 200 to 800 mg BID resulting in a 16-fold increase in the amount of the dose recovered in

239

urine during a dosing interval (Ae0-τ) on Day 1 and an 11-fold increase in Ae0-τ on Day 6.

240

(iii) Food effect. Concentrations of molnupiravir were generally not quantifiable and

241

pharmacokinetic parameters were not calculable. Concentrations of EIDD-1931 were

242

quantifiable at 0.25 hours postdose for 2 subjects in the fasted state, but no subjects in the fed

state. The first quantifiable concentrations in the fed state were between 0.5 and 1.5 hours

244

postdose.

245

Following administration of 200 mg molnupiravir in the fed state, tmax of EIDD-1931 occurred

246

later, with a median of 3.00 hours postdose versus 1.00 hour postdose (Table 8 and Figure 3).

247

Generally, the slower absorption and later tmax in the fed state was reflected in lower Cmax;

248

however, 1 subject had similar profiles for both treatments (data not shown). Mean Cmax was

249

approximately 36% lower in the fed state compared to the fasted state, but exposure (assessed by

250

AUCinf) was similar for both fed and fasted states and demonstrated that the extent of absorption

251

was similar. Following Cmax, concentrations of EIDD-1931 declined in an essentially

252

monophasic manner in both the fed and fasted state and remained quantifiable until between 9

253

and 15 hours postdose in the fed state and between 6 and 9 hours in the fasted state. The mean

254

t1/2 was similar between fed and fasted treatments, with values of 1.09 and 0.977 hours,

255

respectively. Urine pharmacokinetic parameters were similar to those reported for single

256

ascending doses.

Discussion

258

There is a significant need for an antiviral drug against coronaviruses with pandemic potential

259

that is generally safe and well tolerated and can be easily administered in the outpatient setting.

260

The oral route of administration of molnupiravir makes it appropriate and convenient for

261

administration to outpatients.

262

Additionally, if further studies demonstrate that molnupiravir has an acceptable risk/benefit

263

profile, its oral route of administration may allow for evaluation in a prophylactic setting. Among

264

350 cases of COVID-19 in the United States where exposures were solicited, approximately half

265

of respondents reported a known exposure in the 2 weeks prior to the illness, with 45% exposed

266

from an infected family member and 34% exposed from an infected work colleague (12). This

267

suggests a need for treatment of infected individuals and their close contacts in an outpatient

268

setting to reduce viral shedding and infectivity, thereby reducing transmission.

269

Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been found in multiple organs at autopsy, indicating the

270

ability to spread systemically (13). Molnupiravir is converted in plasma to EIDD-1931, which is

271

subsequently well distributed to tissues including lung, spleen, and brain (9); therefore, it can

272

localize to sites of replication in the treatment of systemic disease. An antiviral drug, such as

273

molnupiravir, with broad distribution once absorbed is a desirable attribute for an emerging

274

therapy for the treatment of COVID-19.

275

Plasma exposures expected to be efficacious, based on scaling from animal models of seasonal

276

and pandemic influenza, were exceeded(11). Molnupiravir, having demonstrated good

277

tolerability and dose-proportional pharmacokinetics with relatively low variability following

278

administration to healthy volunteers at clinically relevant doses is well positioned to be evaluated

279

for clinical efficacy and safety in large-scale COVID-19 studies.

280

Materials and Methods

281

Study population. Healthy subjects, of any ethnic origin, race, or sex, aged between 18 and 60

282

years, inclusive, and with a body mass index between 18 and 30 kg/m2, inclusive, were eligible

283

to participate in this study. Potential subjects were screened for inclusion in the study within 28

284

days prior to the first dose administration after voluntarily providing informed consent.

285

Study design. Eligible subjects were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to either study drug or placebo in

286

the single- and multiple-ascending-dose parts. Placebo was chosen as the control treatment to

287

assess whether any observed safety and tolerability effects were related to the treatment or

288

simply reflected the study conditions. Each dose-escalation cohort comprised 8 subjects, with

289

single oral doses of 50 to 1600 mg administered in the single-ascending-dose part and BID doses

290

of between 50 and 800 mg for 5 days with a final dose on the morning of Day 6 being

291

administered in the multiple-ascending-dose part. Safety and tolerability data up to 72 hours

292

postdose (post final dose for multiple ascending doses) were reviewed prior to each dose

293

escalation to ensure that it was safe to proceed with the planned design and multiple doses were

294

not administered until the planned total daily dose had been shown to be safe and well tolerated

295

as a single dose. Subjects were followed for 14 days following dose administration (post final

296

dose for subjects who received multiple doses) for assessments of safety, tolerability, and

297

pharmacokinetics, which exceeded 5 half-lives of EIDD-1931 observed in nonclinical studies

298

(t1/2 = 9.1 hours in dogs and 5 hours in ferrets).

299

Subjects in the food-effect evaluation were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either 200 mg

300

molnupiravir in the fed state followed by 200 mg molnupiravir in the fasted state, or vice versa.

301

Randomization was performed and subjects were followed as described for the single- and

302

multiple-ascending-dose parts. There was a 14-day washout period between doses in the food-

303

effect evaluation.

304

A capsule formulation was used in all parts of the study, with the exception of single ascending

305

doses ≤800 mg, where an oral solution formulation was used.

306

The study was conducted in accordance with the International Council for Harmonisation Good

307

Clinical Practice guidelines, the ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki, and the

308

European Union Clinical Trial Directive (2001/20/EC) following approval by applicable

309

regulatory authorities and receipt of a favorable opinion by an ethics committee.

310

Objectives and endpoints. The primary objectives of this study were: (i) to determine the safety

311

and tolerability of single and multiple ascending doses of molnupiravir, and (ii) to assess the

312

effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of molnupiravir and EIDD-1931 following a single dose.

313

The secondary objective of the study was to define the pharmacokinetics of molnupiravir and

314

EIDD-1931 in plasma and urine following single and multiple doses in healthy subjects. The

315

safety and tolerability endpoints were clinical laboratory evaluations, vital signs,

316

electrocardiograms, physical examinations, and adverse events. Pharmacokinetic endpoints

317

included plasma and urinary parameters.

318

Criteria for evaluation. Following single doses, plasma and urine samples for pharmacokinetic

319

analysis were collected up to 72 and 48 hours postdose, respectively. Following multiple doses,

320

plasma and urine samples were collected up to 12 hours after the first dose and up to 192 and

321

72 hours postdose, respectively, after the final dose. Pharmacokinetic samples were analyzed for

322

molnupiravir and EIDD-1931 using a validated liquid chromatography with tandem mass

323

spectrometry bioanalytical method. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using

324

noncompartmental methods in Phoenix WinNonlin Version 8.1.

325

Safety and tolerability were monitored throughout study participation through recording of

326

adverse events, clinical laboratory evaluations, vital signs, electrocardiogram measurements, and

327

physical examinations. Adverse events were monitored by observation of signs and symptoms,

328

open questioning, and spontaneous reporting, and were graded according to the National

329

Institutes of Health Division of Microbiology and Infectious Disease toxicity grading scale.

330

Sample size and statistical analysis. No formal sample size calculation was conducted;

331

however, 8 subjects per cohort was considered sufficient for an adequate pharmacokinetic

332

analysis following single and multiple doses. Ten subjects in the food-effect evaluation was

333

typical of food-effect studies with a randomized crossover design. Data were presented using

334

descriptive statistics.
