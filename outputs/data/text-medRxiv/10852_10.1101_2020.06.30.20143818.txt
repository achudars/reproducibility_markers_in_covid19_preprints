Abstract
Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and increased pressure on testing resources, understanding
the clinical and epidemiological features closely associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is vital at point of care to enable risk stratification. We demonstrate
that an internally derived and validated clinical decision rule, COVID-MATCH65, has a high
sensitivity (92.6%) and NPV (99.5%) for SARS-CoV-2 and could be used to aid COVID-19 riskassessment and resource allocation for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics.

Background
The COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
was first reported in China and has now infected over 9 million people globally (1). A range of
clinical symptoms and syndromes have been reported in confirmed COVID-19 (2-4). However, there
have been limited prospective reports of the clinical and epidemiological predictors of COVID-19
infection (5). We report on the clinical and epidemiological predictors of COVID-19 from a uniquely
derived prospective database and present a point-of-care COVID-19 clinical decision tool.

Methods
A COVID-19 rapid assessment screening clinic was established at Austin Health on 11 March 2020
with prospective electronic medical record (EMR; eMethods) data of patients presenting to the clinic
systematically collected by medical staff from 11 March to 22 April 2020. Patients were
predominantly adults - children over 6 months were seen at clinician discretion. Modifications to the
EMR were made during the study period to align with the Victorian Department of Health and Human
Services (DHHS) testing criteria (6) (eMethods). Only those patients that met the DHHS criteria for
SARS-CoV-2 testing had nasopharyngeal swab collected for SARS-Cov-2 nucleic acid detection by
polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Patients with swabs that had SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detected
were termed “COVID-19 test positive”; those with swabs where SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid was not
detected were termed “COVID-19 test negative”. This study was approved by the Austin Health
Human Research and Ethics Committee.

Derivation and Internal Validation Cohort
Clinical data from the data collection tool (baseline demographics, clinical symptoms, clinical
observations) and COVID-19 testing results were extracted from Austin Health EMR platform
(Cerner®) by the Data Analytics Research and Evaluation (DARE) Centre (Austin Health/University
of Melbourne).

All results are presented according to TRIPOD guidelines(7). Categorical variables are presented as
frequency (percentage) and continuous variables as median (interquartile range [IQR]). Fisher’s exact
test or rank sum test were used to compare characteristics between tested and not tested patients. To
determine the predictors of a positive COVID-19 test, a multivariable logistic regression with
backward stepwise procedure was used, eliminating variables with p>0.10 and re-inclusion of
variables with p<0.05. Bootstrapping was used for internal validation. Further details on variable
selection, model development and performance, internal validation and score derivation are outlined
in eMethods.

Results
Study population and setting
During the study period 4359 assessments were performed in 4226 patients (eTable 1). For those with
multiple presentations (n=118) only their first testing date was used (for patients that were not tested,
their first assessment was taken). Median (IQR) number of daily assessments was 96 (71, 134) with
an average of 51% of patients being tested each day (eFigure1).

COVID-19 testing
Testing was performed on 2976 patients (70%). The characteristics of those with suspected COVID19, stratified by testing performed status, is outlined in eTable 2. The most frequently reported
symptoms in both groups were any fever (reported or documented), cough, sore throat and coryza as
outlined in eTable 2.

COVID-19 test positivity
Of the 2976 patients that were tested, 41 were excluded from the analysis due to pending results
(n=38) or indeterminate results (n=3). The prevalence of a positive COVID-19 test in the final cohort
was 3.7% (108/2935). Characteristics of those patients with a positive COVID-19 test are shown in
Table 1.

Demographic, epidemiological and clinical factors associated with a positive COVID-19 test
The characteristics associated with a positive COVID-19 test in univariate and multivariable analysis
are shown in Table 2. The seven features associated with a COVID-19 test on multivariable analysis
were summarized in the mnemonic COVID-MATCH65 (Figure 1). The model showed good
discrimination (AUC = 0.843, Hosmer-Lemeshow chi2=4.96, p=0.762) and calibration (calibration
slope = 1.00, Brier score = 0.03, product-moment correlation between observed and predicted
probability = 0.35). Internal validation showed minimal mean optimism of 0.007 with internally
validated AUC of 0.836 (eFigure 2 & 3). The resulting score ranges from -1 to 6.5 points with score

≤ 1 representing low risk of a positive test (<1%) and scores above 4 having beyond 20% probability
of a positive test (Figure 1).

The positive and negative results for each COVID-MATCH65 score are outlined in eTable 2. A score
of at least 1.5 was shown to have 92.6% (95% CI 85.9%, 96.7%) sensitivity, 51.3% (49.4, 53.1)
specificity, 6.8% (5.5, 8.2) positive predictive value and 99.5% (98.9, 99.8) negative predictive value
of identifying a patient who was COVID-19 test positive (eTable 3). COVID-MATCH65 also retains
a high NPV with increasing prevalence of COVID-19 (30% prevalence) (eTable 4).

Admission to hospital
A total of 15 COVID-19 positive patients (14%) were admitted to hospital. Median (IQR) COVIDMATCH65 score in admitted was 3.5 (2.5, 4.5) while in non-admitted it was 3 (2.5, 4). Score was not
predictive of admission (OR 1.04, 95%CI: 0.70, 1.53, p=0.852). Variables predictive of admission
were oxygen saturation (SpO2) < 97%, shortness of breath, male gender and not being exposed to
confirmed case/international travel (eTable 5).

Discussion
Whilst the clinical features of COVID-19 have been well reported, robust prospective from patients
presenting for COVID-19 assessment that are both SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative on testing
remains absence. Therefore, to date an accurate assessment of the clinical predictors associated with a

positive SARS-CoV-2 test has been ill defined. Whilst fever has been the predominant presenting
feature of confirmed COVID-19 cases from published inpatient populations(4), it was in fact observed
less frequently (36.5%) in our outpatient cohort, potentially the result of earlier presentation (5
days[median] from symptom onset). Bajema et al.(5) reported fever in 68% in a retrospective cohort
study (n=210) from the USA with similar incidence rate of COVID-19 positive tests to our cohort
(5% USA vs. 4.7% AUS). Whilst in the earliest reports from confirmed cases in China the figures
were 83-98%(2, 3). Whilst coryza and sore throat were frequently reported, the presence of either was
in fact a negative predictor of COVID-19 infection. Anosmia or ageusia as seen in other emerging
studies was a strong predictor of a positive COVID-19 test(8). Whilst contact and/or international
travel was a predictor of COVID-19 infection in our model, as seen in US model from Challenger et
al.(9), it may be less relevant in outbreak settings and during periods of travel bans, however these
criteria alone are not required for a patient to be at high risk of COVID-19.
Our model has some limitations, including the single centre prospective data source, jurisdictional
guided testing criteria, testing of symptomatic only patients and absence of external validation.
However, only one small retrospective US cohort (n =49 COVID-19 positive /n= 98 COVID-19
negative)(9) and two non-peer reviewed publications from China have examined the role of clinical
decision rules from large datasets - Meng et al. (n = 620 outpatients; 48.7% positive)(10) and Song et
al.(11) (n = 304 inpatients; 24.0% positive), both limited by requirement for clinical and laboratory
parameters. COVID-MATCH65 uses readily available clinical information without laboratory test
results, with a score of 1.5 associated with high sensitivity and NPV, enabling application in the
outpatient and potentially early inpatient setting. Further risk stratification can be made with the
scoring tool (lowest risk [< 1 in 100] to extreme risk [1 in 1]), aiding diagnostic approaches in patients
with suspected COVID-19. In a pandemic where diagnostic resources are limited in both low- and
high-income settings,(12) risk stratification of those likely to have COVID-19 is urgently required and
tools such as COVID-MATCH65 can aid the front-line clinician. We encourage readers to urgently
employ and validate COVID-MATCH65 in their own datasets, as it is likely to aid clinicians at pointof-care especially via an open access web platform (http://COVID-MATCH65.austin.org.au).
