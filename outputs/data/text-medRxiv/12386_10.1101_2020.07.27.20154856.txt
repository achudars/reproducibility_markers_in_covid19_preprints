Abstract
During the COVID-19 pandemic the use of cloth masks has increased dramatically due
to the shortage of medical masks. However, the efficiency of this material is
controversial. We aimed to investigate the efficiency of cloth masks in reducing
transmission and contamination by droplets and aerosols for the general population
and healthcare workers. Electronic databases were searched without year or language
restrictions. Clinical and laboratorial studies were included. The risk of bias (RoB) was
assessed using an adapted quality checklist for laboratory-based studies. ROBINS-I
tool and Cochrane RoB 2.0 were used to evaluate non-randomized (n-RCT) and
randomized clinical trials (RCT), respectively. The quality of the evidence was
assessed through GRADE tool. From the eleven studies selected, eight were
laboratory-based studies, one non-randomized and one RCT supported by laboratory
data. Between the evaluated fabrics only three presented a filtration efficiency >90%.
Hybrid of cotton/chiffon (95%CI 95.2 to 98.8), hybrid of cotton/silk (95%CI 92.2 to 95.8)
and cotton quilt (95%CI 94.2 to 97.8). A meta-analysis was not feasible due to a high
methodological heterogeneity. The overall quality of evidence ranged from very low to
moderate. Despite the lower efficiency compared to medical masks, laboratorial results
may underestimate the efficiency of cloth masks in real life. Cloth mask efficiency is
higher when made of hybrid fabrics (cotton/chiffon, cotton/silk) and cotton quilt, mainly
with multiple layers. In pandemic situations any measure that can contribute to source
control at the population level can have a beneficial effect. However, cloth masks are
not recommended for healthcare workers.

INTRODUCTION
According to the World Health Organization (WHO)1, viral diseases continue to
emerge and represent a serious issue to public health. In the past few months, the
COVID-19 pandemic has been the focus in scientific journals and the media. Frequent
handwashing, barrier measures such as gloves, gowns and masks and isolation of
suspected cases are some of the recommended procedures to reduce transmission in
respiratory diseases2. Knowing COVID-19 is highly contagious, some experts and
countries have encouraged or even implemented mandatory facial covering in public
as a form of prevention3.
Recent studies4,5 reported that viral shedding of patients with the SARS-CoV-2
was higher at the time or before symptom onset. It means that a considerable portion
of infected individuals with the new coronavirus are asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic
patients and can transmit the virus during routine activities like speaking, coughing, or
sneezing. Therefore, it is extremely important that everyone use masks, even those
who did not present any symptoms.
Surgical masks, N95 respirators and similar are effective barriers that can help
preventing COVID-19. However, due to the shortage of these products at the market6
it only should be used by healthcare workers. For the general population, the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention7 recommends wearing cloth mask covering in
public settings, which are a simple and low coast measure that may have a big social
impact.
The main objective of use these masks in public is to decrease transmission by
pre-symptomatic infected individuals who continue to move freely. This is known as
source control and refers to the effectiveness of blocking droplets from an infected
person, when droplets expelled are not small enough to squeeze through the weave
of a cotton mask8. When facing an epidemic episode, authorities must decide on the
best actions to reduce the social impact, and source control becomes a critical matter
in the debate about whether the public should wear masks9.
Studies suggested that in laboratory settings cloth masks are less effective than
surgical masks10,11, but they seemed better than no protection at all12. Although some
studies showed limited evidence regarding the use of face masks, absence of evidence
is not evidence of absence13. With no effective vaccine or treatment, reducing the rate
of infection is a urgency14.

Public policy makers need urgent guidance on the use of masks by the general
population as a tool in combating SARS-CoV-2, based on the best available evidence.
Therefore, the aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the existing evidence on
the efficiency of homemade or commercial cloth masks compared to surgical masks
and N95/others respirators in reducing transmission and contamination by droplets and
aerosols in the general population and among healthcare workers.
MATERIAL AND METHOD

Search strategy and selection criteria
The present systematic review was registered in the PROSPERO database
(https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO, CRD42020178417) and was reported
according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
(PRISMA) guidelines (www.prisma-statement.org)15.Electronic searches, without date
and language restrictions, were carried out according to the PECO strategy. Eight
databases were used: PubMed, Scopus, Web of science, Cochrane, VHS, OpenGrey,
Google Scholar and Clinical Trials (Table 1). An additional manual search was carried
out in the reference list of the included articles, as well as in some hand-picked
electronic journals. Alerts were received by April 30, 2020.The eligibility criteria were
defined according to the PECO research strategy for clarity in resolving the question:
Can homemade or commercial cloth masks be used instead of surgical masks and
N95 respirators as an alternative in reducing transmission and contamination by
droplets and aerosols for general population and healthcare workers?
Inclusion Criteria:
1. Problem: Droplet and/or aerosol dispersion contamination.
2. Exposure: Homemade and/or commercial cloth masks.
3. Comparison: Surgical mask and/or N95 respirator.
4. Outcome: The efficiency of handmade or commercial cloth masks in reducing

Data collection
Two authors, independently, sorted the articles by title, abstract and full text, using the
bibliographic reference manager Endnote (version X7, Thomson Reuters).
Disagreements during study selection and data extraction were settled through a
consensus meeting and, when appropriate, by consulting with a third author. The
qualitative data extraction table included the following information: Author, Year and
Country; Exposure; Comparison; Sample and Method and Authors' conclusions.

Data analysis
For all laboratory-based studies evaluated in this systematic review, the Checklist for
Quasi-Experimental Studies (non-randomized experimental studies) from The Joanna
Briggs Institute (JBI)16 was used. The checklist was adapted according to the
statements proposed by CRIS Guidelines (Checklist for Reporting In-Vitro Studies)17,
which suggests evaluating factors such as the randomization process, blinding and
statistical analysis. The evaluated criteria were divided into seven domains which were
categorized with “yes”, “no” or “unclear”. The checklist was individually analyzed for
each study and classified as low, moderate or high risk of bias. This final classification
was assigned according to the number of domains that presented “no” or “unclear” as
an answer. One or two domains were considered as low risk; three or four as moderate
risk; and five or more as high risk of bias.
For the evaluation of RoB for the non-randomized clinical trials, the ROBINS-Itool18 was used. The evaluated criteria were divided into pre-intervention, intervention,
and post-intervention categories. The RoB was classified as low (one or two domains
with “moderate” or “high”), moderate (three or four domains), serious (five or six
domains), critical (all the domains), and no information accordingly19.
For the randomized clinical trial, the RoB was performed using the Cochrane
Collaboration RoB 2.0 tool20 which uses the following domains: random sequence
generation, allocation concealment, blinding of patients and personnel, blinding of
outcome assessor, incomplete outcome data, and selective outcome reporting. Low
risk of bias was considered when all key domains were considered at low risk; unclear
risk of bias was considered when one or more key domains were unclear and high risk
of bias was considered when one or more key domains were considered at high risk.
A meta-analysis was not feasible due to the high methodological heterogeneity
identified; however, a detailed qualitative synthesis was performed. and the quality of

(%), penetration level (%), airflow resistance, protection factor, cough experiment,
pressure drop, surface masks test and occupational health which includes clinical
respiratory illness (CRI), influenza-like illness (ILI), laboratory-confirmed respiratory
virus infection and pressure differential.
RESULTS
A total of 2047 records were initially identified in the 8 electronic databases searched:
PubMed (n=898), Scopus (n=9), Web of Science (n=7), Cochrane (n=279), Virtual
Healthy Library (n=249), OpenGrey (n=2), Google scholar (n=600) and Clinical Trials
(n=3). After the removal of 218 duplicates through the Endnote manager, 1829 titles
and abstracts were examined. Fifteen records which satisfied the inclusion/exclusion
criteria were retained for full text assessment. From those 15 studies, six were
excluded: one did not define the type of masks compared22; one did not report how the
particle penetration rate of the masks compared was obtained23; two records examined
only factors influencing compliance with the use of medical and cloth masks amongst
hospital workers24,25; and two evaluated the effectiveness of cloth masks after washing
without any comparisons26,27 (Table 2).

Author’s Conclusion

Triple layer surgical mask
with thin layer of fiberglass
filter (quality standard NA): ▪
Hopes®, ▪ Medispo®

Bacterial Aerosol with Staphylococcus aureus: (cocci 1μm in
diameter). Air flow: 28.3L/min. Analysis: Filtration Efficiency
(%) and Airflow resistance (ΔP). One sample of each type of mask
was evaluated at least 5 times.

“It is useful both in preventing hospital infection and in general
clinical practice. The bacterial filtration efficiency of the conventional
cotton cloth masks is not only lower but varible over a wide range of
43.1-93.6%.”

▪ Three layer surgical mask
(1818
Tie-On®,
EN14683:2005).
▪ FFP-2 mask 1872VH (3M)

▪ Experiment 1: 39 Volunteers’ performance in increased
respiratory sequence (10-15 min). 28 adults and 11 children used
the 3 masks (SM, FFP-2 and Homemade CM) during 1.5min. PS:
0.02-1μm. Air flow: Variable.
▪ Experiment 2: 22 Volunteers' performance in increased
respiratory sequence (3 hours). All adults, divided in 3 masks (3
hours). PS: 0.02-1μm. Air flow: Variable.
▪ Experiment 3: Simulated infectious patient expiration. PS: 0.021μm. Air flow: 30, 50 and 80L/min.
Analysis: Protection Factor. One sample of each type of mask was
evaluated twice at each air flow.

“Any type of general mask use is likely to decrease viral exposure and
infection risk on a population level, in spite of imperfect fit and
imperfect adherence, personal respirators providing most protection.
Masks worn by patients may not offer as great a degree of protection
against aerossol transmission.”

▪ N95 respirator filter media.

NaCl Aerosol penetration test with particles of diameter varying
from 0.075 ± 0.02μm (polydisperse) and < 0.4μm - 1μm
(monodisperse). Air flow: 33 and 99L/min. Analysis: Penetration
level (%).
One sample of each type of mask was evaluated twice at each air
flow. Three samples from each fabric materials were tested to
polydisperse particles and another three samples to monodisperse.

“Results obtained in the study show that common fabric materials may
provide marginal protection against nanoparticles including those in
the size ranges of vírus containing particles in exhaled breath.”

three times.
▪ Experiment 1: Prevention of respiratory infections with 1607
Health Care Workers randomized to 3 groups: SM, CM and
standard practice. Analysis: Compliance (more than 70% of
working hours) + Intention to treat analysis: 01-Clinical
respiratory illness (CRI), defined as two or more respiratory
symptoms or one respiratory symptom and a systemic symptom;
02-influenza-like illness (ILI), defined as fever ≥38 °C plus one
respiratory symptom and 03-laboratory-confirmed viral
respiratory infection.

“Our findings suggest that a homemade mask should only be
considered as a last resort to prevent droplet transmission from
infected individuals, but it would be better than no protection.”

“All tested quarantine masks satisfied the KFDA criterion of 6%. Sixninths and four-sevenths of the anti-yellow sand masks for adults and
children satisfied the criterion of 20%, respectively. Medical masks,
and handkerchiefs were found to provide little protection against
respiratory aerossols.”
“This study is the first RCT of CM, and the results caution against the
use of CM. This is an important finding to inform occupational health
and safety. Moisture retention, reuse of cloth masks and poor filtration
may result in increased risk of infection. Further research is needed to
inform the widespread use of cloth masks globally. However, as a
precautionary measure, CM should not be recommended for hospital
healthcare workers, particularly in high-risk situations, and guidelines
need to be updated.”

Polystyrene latex and Diesel PS ranging from 0.03 to 2.5μm. Air
flow: 8 and 19L/min. Analysis: Filtration efficiency (%).
Experiments were repeated three times for each mask type against
PSL particles, and two times against diesel-generated particles.
High Particulate Matter (PM2,5) and Black Carbon (BC) ranging
from 0.1 to 2.5μm. Air flow: 40 and 80L/min. Analysis:
Penetration level (%). One sample of each type of mask was
evaluated for 30 min under flow rates.

“Standard N95 mask performance was used as a control to compare
the results with CM, and our results suggest that CM are only
marginally beneficial in protecting individuals from particles <2.5μm.
Compared with CM, disposable SM are more effective in reducing
particulate exposure.”
“Many commercially available face masks may not provide adequate
protection, primarily due to poor facial fit. Our results indicate that
further attention should be given to mask design and providing
evidence based guidance to consumers.”
“Mask B possessed the highest filtering efficiency and lowest airflow
resistance, which the best in blocking airborne particles and provided
the best air permeability, enabling the surgeons to breathe freely. On
the contrary, mask C possessed the lowest filtering efficiency and
highest airflow resistance, meaning it was the worst in blocking
airborne particles and in air permeability, causing breathing
difficulties in surgeons. Mask C is not recommended to be used,
especially considering that surgeons do not wash the cloth masks
daily. Unnecessary talking during operation is not recommended, and
washing the face before surgery is not strictly necessary.”

Surgical masks (180 mm × 90

4 isolated patients with COVID-19 were instructed to cough 5
times each while wearing the sequence of masks: no mask,
surgical mask, cotton mask, and again with no mask. Mask
surfaces were swabbed with aseptic Dacron swabs in the
sequence: outer surface of surgical mask, inner surface of surgical
mask, outer surface of cotton mask, and inner surface of cotton
mask.

“Both surgical and cotton masks seem to be ineffective in preventing
the dissemination of SARS–CoV-2 from the coughs of patients with
COVID-19 to the environment and external mask surface.”

Polydisperse NaCl Aerosol
Particles dimension: 0.01-10µm.
Air flow: 35L/min and 90L/min.
Analysis: Filtration Efficiency (%) and Airflow resistance (ΔP).
Experiments were repeated seven times for each fabric and mask
types.

“Although the filtration efficiencies for various fabrics when a single
layer was used ranged from 5 to 80% and 5 to 95% for PS of <300 nm
and >300 nm, respectively, the efficiencies improved when multiple
layers were used and when using a specific combination of different
fabrics. Filtration efficiencies of the hybrids was >80% (PS <300 nm)
and >90% (PS>300 nm). Cotton, the most widely used material for
cloth masks performs better at higher weave densities (i.e., thread
count) and can make a significant difference in filtration efficiencies.
Our studies also imply that gaps (as caused by an improper fit of the
mask) can result in over a 60% decrease in the filtration efficiency”

According to each type of study, a different tool for assessing RoB was used.
From the 11 selected studies for qualitative analysis, there were nine laboratory
studies, one non-randomized clinical trial and one randomized clinical trial
complemented by laboratory data. RoB was performed separately for each outcome
within each study.
An adapted JBI checklist for Quasi-Experimental Studies (experimental studies
without random allocation) was applied to ten studies11,12,19,28-33,35. Seven domains
were evaluated: randomization processes; clearly described methods, interventions,
outcome measures; blinding of the assessments; reliable measurement of outcomes
and proper statistical analysis (Table 5).
Only three studies19,29,30 reported on the randomization process and one19
informed the blinding process, but this investigation was classified as lacking clear
information about reliable measurement of outcomes.
Five studies12,19,30,32,35 were classified with a low RoB, but only one30 reported
correctly all the domains, excluding the blinding of the assessments that was unclear.
Four studies11,29,31,33 were classified with a moderate RoB mainly for not reporting any
randomization process and for not clearly describing other domains. Only one study
presented a high RoB28 because it reported only on the reliable measurement of
outcomes and on the interventions.
The ROBINS-I-Tool (Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies-of Interventions)
was used in one study34 that was classified with a high risk of bias (Table 6). The major
reason for this RoB rating was due to bias in selection of participants, who had been
invited to participate in the research; and bias in classifying interventions since it did
not report if the cough velocity was measured and if the patients were under treatment,
which can be confounders since the cough velocity and the use of medications can
modify the results. In addition, no inclusion and exclusion criteria of participants had
been established and this can lead to a heterogeneous sample and unrealistic results.
For the cluster randomized trial19, RoB was evaluated according to the
Cochrane collaboration RoB 2.0 tool, and was rated as low in all domains: random
sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of patients and personnel,
blinding of outcome assessor, incomplete outcome data, and selective outcome
reporting (Table 7).

Regarding the material used in the face masks, six studies evaluated several
household materials that could possibly be used for making cloth masks12,28,29,32,33,35,
while four articles evaluated only commercially available cloth masks11,19,30,31. Four
studies compared cloth masks with surgical masks only12,28,31,34, one compared them
with N9529 respirators only, one with N95 and FFP-2 respirators30, four studies
compared cloth masks with both surgical masks and N95 respirators or similar (FFP2)11,32,33,35, and only one study compared cloth masks with surgical masks, and FFP-2
and FFP-3 respirators19 (Table 3).
Regarding the experimental model, performed by simulation, five studies used
NaCl aerosol with particles size reported: 0.075μm29,31,33, 1μm29, 0.02 to 2μm19 and
10nm to 10 μm35. The air flow speed in these studies was 33L/min and 99L/min 29,
85L/min31,33, 95L/min19 and in the last study two velocities 35 L/min and 90 L/min41
were used. Two studies used microbial aerosols: one was contaminated aerosol with
Staphylococcus aureus of 1μm in diameter at 28L/min air flow speed28, one used
Bacillus atrophaeus with 0.95-1.25μm and Bacteriophage MS2 with 0.023μm, both
with a 30L/min air flow speed12. One study11 used Polystyrene latex and Diesel
Particles from 0.03 to 2.5μm in an air flow speed of 8 and 19L/min; and one study30
used high particulate matter from 0.1 to 2.5μm with 40 and 80L/min. Three studies
evaluated more than one outcome, and also used volunteers12,19,32. One study34 did
not perform an experiment by simulation and concluded that both surgical and cloth
masks are inefficient in containing the spread.
Anti-contamination measurements
For anti-contamination measurements, the filtration efficiency (%) was evaluated
by six studies11,12,19,28,31,35, where three of them compared cloth masks with surgical
masks only12,28,31. The first one12 analyzed several homemade cloth masks and found
that better results were achieved by the tea towel with 2 layers (96.71 ± 8.73) and
vacuum cleaner bag (94.35 ± 35), with results similar to surgical masks (96.35 ± 0.68).
Cotton mix (74.60 ± 11.17) and 100% cotton T-shirts with 2 layers (70.66 ± 6.83) also
presented good results, while linen (60.00±11.18) and silk (58.00 ± 2.75) had the worst
results. The second one12,28 analyzed three different cloth masks and reported that the
best result was achieved by the twill cloth mask(93.6±1.16) with no difference
compared to Hopes®️ surgical mask (98.1±1.02, p˂0.05), and the last one31 concluded

that the surgical mask with two filter screens presented 60-80% of filtration efficiency
while cloth masks about 20%.
Three studies11,19,35 compared cloth masks with both surgical masks and N95
respirators or similar. The first one11 reported that the efficiency of cloth masks
presented the worst results (39% to 65%) in comparison to the other two groups, the
second study19 noted penetration of particles through the cloth masks to be very high
(97%), but neither study reported the fabric of the cloth masks. The last one35 found
that hybrid fabrics potentially provide protection against the transmission of aerosol
particles, with a filtration efficiency of three types of hybrid fabrics: cotton/chiffon (97 ±
1), cotton/silk (94 ± 2) with no gap, and cotton/flannel (95 ± 2) even better than N95
respirators (85±15) in relation to <300 nm particles.
The penetration level (%) was measured by three studies29,30,33. The first one33
compared cloth masks with surgical masks and N95 respirators and found a high

with N95 and/or FFP-2 respirators and both of them noted a high penetration level in
cloth masks in relation to comparison group. One29 found better results between the
cloth fabrics in sweatshirts with 40% of penetration level at 33L/min and 57% at
99L/min. The other30 found that a mask named Yi Jie PM2.5 presented the lowest
degree of penetration between the other cloth masks options with 67.3% (IQR:
56.6%,75.2%), but even so with worse results when compared to the best N95 brand

respiratory illness (CRI), influenza-like illness (ILI) and laboratory-confirmed virus

Protection factor32 showed that surgical masks provided about twice as much
protection as homemade masks, FFP2 masks provided 50 times as much protection
as homemade masks, and 25 times as much protection as surgical masks.

Anti-transmission measurements
The protection factor of cloth, surgical and FFP-2 masks were evaluated by one
study32 which showed that cloth masks presented a considerably lower protection
factor (1.9, CI95% 1.5,2.3) especially in children. Protection offered by a surgical mask
and FFP2 respirator did not differ.
Two studies12,34 evaluated particle dissemination when coughing. The first one 12
found that both surgical and cloth masks reduced the total number of microorganisms
expelled when coughing in comparison with coughing without a mask, while the second
one34 found that neither cloth or surgical masks effectively filtered the virus expelled
when coughing.

Breathability
Studies evaluating pressure drop (PD)12,33 and airflow resistance (Pa)28,31 had
demonstrated that tea towel12, vacuum cleaner bag masks12, cotton handkerchief with
four layers33, twill weave28 and bleached cotton28 had greater potential to block
contaminated patient particles outside the cloth mask. However, they can cause a
suffocating sensation to the user.
On the other hand, some of the evaluated fabrics presented a good breathability,
such as calico28, silk12, linen12, cotton and gauze handkerchief33. One study35 reported
that the average differential pressure across all of the fabrics studied at a flow rate of
1.2 CFM was found to be 2.5 (0.4) Pa, indicating conditions for good breathability, but
we can’t claim that these cloth masks are able to contain or reduce particles expelled
by the user.

Quality of the evidence
GRADE assessment was divided into anti-contamination and anti-transmission
and breathability outcomes. For the outcomes included in the anti-contamination the

In general terms, surgical and N95 and/or FFP-2 masks presented better results
in most of the factors evaluated in comparison with the cloth masks, with very low to
moderate certainty of evidence level depending on the outcome analyzed. Regardless
of some benefits for cloth mask users, the results are hard to summarize and
generalize because of the variety of fabrics and layers evaluated.
These results should be viewed with caution given the quality of the evidence
and the fact that almost all the included studies evaluated the outcome of interest in a

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.27.20154856; this version posted July 29, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

laboratory setting. Furthermore, elements of statistical precision between the groups
are scarce, and outcomes such as degree of protection, pressure drop, surface masks
test and occupational health were each evaluated in only one study.

DISCUSSION
Our results suggest that cloth masks present worse outcomes for filtration
efficiency, penetration level and protection factor in comparison with medical masks,
when evaluated in a laboratory-based examining small particles. In accordance with
other study8, these results seem to substantially underestimate the efficiency of cloth
masks for source control in real life when referring to blocking droplets ejected by the
wearer, since in most cases the particles used in these studies were smaller than a
droplet and generally ranged between 5 μm to 10 μm36,37. For this reason, it is
suggested that the use of cloth masks by the general public is likely a useful public
health measure in reducing COVID-19 contamination and transmission. In addition,
the fact that cloth masks are not as effective as surgical masks does not mean that
they provide no protection. Anything that contributes to controlling the spread of a virus
should be encouraged from a population-based point of view. Multiple approaches that
alone do not a have a major impact when combined could have a multiplicative effect
in slowing the spread of a virus like COVID-19 by reducing the transmission rate.
Overall, the filtration efficiency of the fabric depends on a variety of factors: the
composition of the fabric and some characteristics of the particles to which it is exposed
such as their size and velocity. These factors are fundamental to evaluate the quality
of the masks. Only seven studies11,12,29-33 presented particle sizes compatible with the
new coronaviruses (0.06-0.14 μm)38. This lack of complete information directly affected
the potential bias of these studies. If the particle sizes were known, we could have
better evaluated the efficiency of cloth masks for the general population against the
coronavirus.
Only one study34 evaluated the use of cloth masks in patients with COVID-19,
but it is important to clarify that this study presented some limitations such as a small
sample size and inconsistent data, including no detection of viral load in one
participant’s cough test (including without a mask) and no detection of viral load in the

inner surface of the masks in three of four patients after coughing. The other studies
assessed other types of bacteria and viruses, but this did not seem to affect the results.
The study that evaluated the use of cloth masks by healthcare workers19 did not
recommend their use by these professionals. A recent systematic review39 showed that
low quality evidence was presented in studies evaluating the use of PPE, face masks
(surgical and N95) and eye protection to prevent infectious diseases in healthcare
workers. The authors highlighted the urgent need for randomized clinical trials with
better methodological quality. However, results in a healthcare setting are not readily
generalizable to the population where any measure, even not as efficient as a measure
in a healthcare setting, can provide some source control.
Another recent systematic review14 investigated physical distancing, face masks
and eye protection to prevent person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 and they
supported that physical distancing of at least 1 m is strongly associated with protection,
but distances up to 2 mm might be more effective. Regarding the use of face masks,
it was found that it could result in a large reduction in risk of infection, with stronger
association with N95 or similar respirators when compared with surgical masks. Eye
protection also was associated with less infection.
Among the studies that reported the materials used to fabricate cloth masks, the
vacuum cleaner bag presented good results, but it’s important to clarify that this
material has a high pressure drop, rendering it unsuitable for a face mask, therefore
the use of tea towel was recommended instead12. In relation to layers of masks, the
number used seems to be directly proportional to the filtration capacity in most of the
laboratory studies and could be a solution to improve the results achieved by cloth
masks40-43. The combination of various commonly available fabrics can potentially
provide significant protection against the contamination of aerosol particles, as a hybrid
of cotton and silk mask seems to present results of filtration efficiency very similar to
surgical and N95 masks35.
Cloth masks can be effective depending on the fabric and number of layers
used. It could decrease the air passage from inside to outside of the masks, thereby
favoring the decrease of the microorganisms expelled during speaking, coughing, or
sneezing. However, it is critical that it is well adapted to the facial contour, since the
presence of gaps caused by an improper fit of the mask can result in over a 60%
decrease of their filtration efficiency35. In addition, some authors recommended that in
situations of public emergency, with limited evidence, mechanistic and analogous

evidence and professional judgment become important. In these cases, the use of
facial masks, along with other health measures, such as personal hygiene, can help
mitigate the COVID-19 epidemic44.
A recent rapid systematic review45 evaluated the use of medically manufactured
facemasks and similar barriers to prevent respiratory illness such as COVID-19.
According to the RCTs, the results showed that the use of facial masks may present
little protection against primary infections through casual contact with the community,
and modestly protect against domestic infections when infected and non-infected
members wear face masks. In observational studies the evidence in favors of wearing
facemasks was stronger. This is an important point to be cited since the clinical studies
could often suffer from poor compliance and controls using facemasks 45. Therefore,
the correct and continuous use of these protections by the public could improve the
clinical results.
This fact can also be supported by a mathematical modelling study that
described the spread of COVID-10 infection. Modelling studies suggest that if most
people wear masks, the transmission rate can decrease to 1.09. Moreover, cloth masks
could be an additional tool to enhance awareness of the importance of physical
distancing in public places, serving as a visual reminder8.
Another study46 discussed the potential effectiveness of the universal adoption
of homemade cloth facemasks. They found that that the growth rate of deaths in
countries without mask norms is 21%, while in countries with such norms is 11%.
Although researchers may disagree on the magnitude of the reduction in
transmissibility, the benefits found can be highly expressive and beneficial to the
transmission and control process of the disease8. Public use of facemask may increase
awareness regarding the disease among the population and can contribute to the
reduction of the transmission rates.
It is well-known that the virus may survive on the surface of face masks 47, and
contamination may occur since the cloth mask may transfer pathogen to bare hands
during the repeated donning and doffing17, so it’s very important to wash hands as
much as possible and wash the masks daily. Conversely, a study21 showed that
washing and drying practices could drop by 20% the filtering efficiency of cloth masks
after the 4th cycle, due to the increase of the pore size and the expansion of the fabric.
It is important to highlight that the masks were air dried to make sure that the cloth
fibers were not stretched out, since stretching cloth masks surface also altered the

pore size and potentially decreased the filtering efficiency. Further studies about wash
and dry care of cloth masks are needed to obtain a longer durability with efficiency.
Moreover, authorities need to provide clear guidelines for the use, cleaning, and reuse
of facemasks.
A guideline from the WHO48 encourage the use of respiratory hygiene in all
people with acute respiratory infections (ARIs) and it includes the use of medical or
cloth masks. Although the quality of evidence has been considered very low2, there
was consensus that the advantages of the use of respiratory hygiene and an
assessment of values and preferences provided sufficient basis for the strong
recommendation. Thus, the importance of cloth masks use by the general population
seems an effective way of source control, as people in a pre-symptomatic phase can
already spread the virus. This is a simple and low-cost measure that in conjunction
with other strategies can be extremely helpful in control and mitigation of the disease.
This systematic review identified some limitations in the primary studies and
only two of the included studies were clinical trials. A more realistic comparison
between groups was hampered by the lack of detailed features information on the
masks studied. There was a lack of studies comparatively assessing the various
fabrics, utilizing different particles sizes and designs of cloth masks, and taking into
consideration the importance of a good fit on effectiveness. Besides that, new studies
with a better methodological quality and randomized clinical trial specifically related to
COVID-19 are in urgent needed.

CONCLUSION
Cloth masks seem to provide some degree of protection against contamination
and transmission by droplets and aerosols. It is suggested that the use of cloth masks
by the public is a useful public health measure that can protect the wearer and at the
same time act as source decrease disease transmission. However, according to one
RCT, cloth masks should not be recommended for healthcare workers. Based on very
low to moderate quality of evidence the level of efficiency of cloth masks is difficult to
generalize because of the variety of fabrics and layers evaluated, the efficiency is
higher when cloth masks are made of hybrid fabrics with multiple layers.
