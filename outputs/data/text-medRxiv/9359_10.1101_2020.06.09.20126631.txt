An easy-to-evaluate parameter is defined to rapidly establish the status of the evolution of
COVID-19 in any given territory. 17 countries in 4 continents are chosen to apply it and compare
different evolutions.
The parameter or figure of merit (FC) is dynamic: it combines testing, mortality rate, and
characteristics of the Gaussian function that fits the new daily contagions.
FC spans more than two orders of magnitude which makes it a very sensitive indicator to promptly
detect second waves or local outbreaks.
It is found that countries with massive BCG vaccination present low COVID-19 mortality rates
and low values for FC.

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND
COVID-19 has spread rapidly, and there are still many characteristics of this new disease to be unveiled. We
propose a simple method to calculate a “figure of merit” FC to provide an early characterization of the disease
status in country C.
METHODS
We use mathematical tools to adjust a Gaussian function to the daily increase of infected patients. Maximum
value and full width half maximum of the Gaussian are characteristics of the development of the development
of the pandemic in each country. These parameters are supplemented by the testing volume and the mortality
rate to produce just one characterizing parameter: FC. In addition, the stability of the Gaussian fits was
calculated within an entire week towards the end of the study period. Seventeen different countries were fully
considered, while others are considered when discussing particular properties. Data employed is publically
available.
FINDINGS
Fitted Gaussian functions render effective information about the development of COVID-19. The number of
critical days vary between 11 (South Korea) and 52 (Mexico). FC varies between 1 (Australia) and 899
(Mexico). The epidemic appears stabilized in some countries and unstable in others. Some large countries
are experiencing fast development of the propagation of the disease with high FC. A correlation between low
(high) values of the mortality rate (and to some extent FC) and the presence (absence) of BCG vaccination is
exposed.
INTERPRETATION
The adjustment of a Gaussian to daily data of COVID-19 in each country reveals the different propagation
dynamics, properly characterized by the parameters proposed here. Testing plays a clear role to control the
spread of the disease. Mortality rate spans more than one order of magnitude and is somewhat related to
permanent massive BCG vaccination. The figure of merit, FC, introduced here spans more than 2 orders of
magnitude which makes it a useful indicator to quickly find out the status of the pandemics in each territory.
Geography plays a role: low population density and isolated countries can be efficient in controlling the
spread of the disease.

INTRODUCTION
There are several models that explain the evolution of a pandemic, generally based on
the initial proposal of Kermack and McKendrick (Kermack and McKendrick, 1927), with additional
improvements and variations through the years. Such analyses are more suitable for a posteriori discussions
to prevent future outbreaks of the same or similar diseases. More recent approaches have considered the
effect of quarantine, social distancing and even local heuristic behaviors to help in the control of the more
recent 2003 SARS outbreak (Glasser et al., 2011).
With the current rapid spread of the new coronavirus COVID-19, indicators are needed
that can promptly guide to better decision-making. At the moment we write this article there is no vaccine
against this virus and is out of control in several places in the world. Moreover, new outbreaks or “a second
wave” or even virus mutations are still possible so authorities need easy information to help in rapid decisions
as to decide upon the best strategy for the territory, population density, habits, season of the year among
several considerations. It is clear that there is no universal way of controlling the disease but learning from
countries that have been successful in stopping the propagation of the disease can help to adapt local measures
that are appropriate to the local population. This is the spirit of this paper: we propose a way to produce
indicators or parameters that might help in this direction. Instead of providing an exhaustive mathematical
analysis of the functions involved, we propose a direct and easy-to-use empirical approach to the evolution
of pandemics in order to report on the characteristics of the disease in each territory. Over time, this can guide
authorities in seeking timely corrections to available measures and over borders collaborations.
We are aware of the cascade of material presently published on COVID-19. Our search
did not yield any results from documents published along the line we propose here.
METHODS
Data
There are several public databases handling live statistics for COVID-19. The Johns
Hopkins University (JHU, 2020) has provided a very helpful one, with interactive maps. Another source with
more emphasis on graphical analysis is provided by Worldometers (Worldometers, 2020). We will use the
data continuously updated by the latter because of its tabulation and functional analysis, which is consistent
with the idea of the present study. The population of each country will also be obtained from there and is
given in the second column of Table I, which will summarize our main results.

From Worldometers we extract the daily number of accumulated contagions. This
function will be referred to as nC(t) for country C, where t is the time measured in days; the latest nC values
are listed in the fifth column of Table I. Thus the number of daily cases for any day t´ in the sequence is
directly given by DC(t´)=nC(t´)nC(t´1).
It has been argued that the available data are not homogeneous because countries have
their own testing and diagnostic systems, leaving a different number of unaccounted infected patients. We
will correct this fact by taking into consideration the testing rate for each country (TC, fourth column in Table
I): number of accumulated tests for country C (UC, third column in Table I) over the population.
Consideration will be also paid to the mortality rate MC (expressed as a percentage, seventh column in Table
I) relating the total number of deaths (dC, sixth column in Table I) to the total number of cases nC (fifth
column).
We will extract data from Worldometers for different countries. For homogeneity all
these data were those available on April 29, 2020. Seventeen countries reflecting different continents, sizes,
and reactions to COVID-19 will be included in the study. For reasons of space and time, we have left out
several important regions and the entire continent of Africa. However, the simple methodology will allow
readers to make their own calculations for other countries. The idea is precisely to show that the approach
we propose below is capable of distinguishing different realities at the intermediate stages. These countries
are listed in the first column of Table I.
Mathematical tools
The n(t) function (accumulated number of cases for any country) grows slowly at first
but soon explodes into an exponential-like behavior (convex curve). After a few days, the reaction of
society imposes limitations to the spread of the virus, and growth moderates to a point where n(t) becomes
approximately linear: it has reached the turning or inflection point. If the measures taken by the authority
are effective, this linear period ends soon, so that the growth rate of n(t) decreases even more and n(t) tends
to flatten out (concave curve), asymptotically approaching its saturation value n(t=∞), denoted by Nc for
country C. One example can be observed in the lower panel of Fig. 1. The shape of this curve can be
described mathematically by a sigmoid Sc(t), given by:
𝑆𝐶 (𝑡) =

𝑁𝐶
1 + exp(−𝑎𝐶 (𝑡 − 𝑡𝐶 ))

≈ 𝑛𝐶 (𝑡) ,

[1]

where tC marks the turning point for country C, and coefficient aC is related to the slope of the sigmoid of
country C at the turning point.
The derivative of this function, d(SC(t))/dt, represents the daily cases obtained from de
sigmoid whose mathematical expression can be approximately described by a Gaussian function GC(t) which
can be adjusted by a least square fit to the actual daily cases DC(t) for country C:
𝐺𝐶 (𝑡) = 𝐴𝐶 𝑒𝑥𝑝 (−

(𝑡 − 𝑡𝐶 )2
2𝜎𝐶2

) ≈ 𝐷𝐶 (𝑡),

[2]

where AC=aCNC/4 and C corresponds to the standard deviation, which is related to aC by the condition:
𝜎𝐶 ≈

2√2
𝑎𝐶 √𝜋

=

1.596
.
𝑎𝐶

[3]

An example of this curve can be found in the upper panel of Fig. 1. The amplitude AC of the Gaussian is
important since it tells what is the expected number of infected people in the days of maximum crisis, a
fraction of which will be demanding specialized hospital treatment. These values are given in column 9 of
Table I.
Another parameter characterizing the Gaussian function is the full width half maximum
(FWHM) designated by C linked to C by the simple relationship:

[4]

Γ𝐶 = 2√2 𝑙𝑛2 𝜎𝐶 = 2.355 𝜎𝐶 .

We shall use this parameter (measured in days) to characterize the duration of the critical period of the
disease, which has implications on the economy of country C. Values of C are listed in the tenth column of
Table I.
We can define a figure of merit FC for any country C by combining previously defined
AC and C with other relevant parameters. The former will be normalized with respect to the population of
the country PC.
One additional parameter is the normalized COVID-19 tests TC(t) which can be defined
by the ratio of the total number of tests UC(t) performed in country C up to time t, over its population PC:
𝑇𝐶 (𝑡) =

𝑈𝐶 (𝑡)
,
𝑃𝐶

[5]

higher TC(t) values ensure better response to control de spread of the disease. Another important indicator is
the mortality rate MC(t) of country C, defined as the percentage of deaths dC(t) with respect to the total number
of positively diagnosed cases nC(t), namely:
𝑀𝐶 (𝑡) = 100

𝑑𝐶 (𝑡)
,
𝑛𝐶 (𝑡 − )

[6]

where  is the average delay between the diagnosis and the death of a fatal patient. It is easy to find out the
phase delay of the death curve to the diagnosis curve for any country, and we have found that although this
varies a bit among countries it remains close to 9-12 days. It we use the latter value to evaluate the mortality
of Germany we get 4.6 %; if  is ignored (=0) the value is 4.2 %. For the purposes of the tabulation of this
parameter, we will ignore , which will have a negligible effect when comparing among countries in later
stages of the pandemic, since all countries will be affected by similar corrections. Lower MC(t) values point
to better handling of the infected patients.
FC(t) or figure of merit can be defined as:

𝐹𝐶 (𝑡) =

𝑀𝐶 (𝑡) 𝛤𝐶 𝐴𝐶
𝑀𝐶 (𝑡) 𝛤𝐶 (𝑡) 𝐴𝐶 (𝑡)
=
,
𝑈𝐶 (𝑡) 𝑃𝐶
𝑈𝐶 (𝑡)
𝑃𝐶

[7]

where low values of FC(t) point to better performance in handling the critical period of the disease.
This figure of merit does not mean any a priori judgment on the public health strategy
followed by each country. It only represents the situation of a snapshot taken at a time t which can evolve in
different ways from there on. However, A low FC(t) value can indicate that hospital facilities are expected to
be enough, and/or tests are available in proportion to the population, and/or the mortality rate is low, and/or
the expected duration of the crisis is short. Values of FC(t) are given orderly in the last column of Table I.
To go beyond this static image, we propose to analyze a week (usual human cyclic unit)
during this study for a dynamical testing of the Gaussian fit. Then we calculated the "instantaneous" FWHM
values for each country C(t) for the 7 days ending on April 19, 2020. This will be an indication of the trend
of C both in its time derivative and in its standard deviation: large values of the latter could mean unstable
status in the control of the epidemic.
BCG Data
The Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine has been inoculated for decades
worldwide. However, this has not been applied evenly to different countries. It has recently been proposed
that populations on which this vaccine was massively administered at early ages are better able to resist the
consequences of COVD-19. Two registered protocols for clinical trials to study the effects of BCG
vaccination have been proposed (NCT04327206, 2020; NCT04328441, 2020) The World Health
Organization released a scientific report on April 12, 2020, clarifying that this has not been clinically

established and warning against vaccination in an attempt to stop the pandemic (WHO, 2020). Nevertheless,
independent research is beginning to confirm some correlation between previous BCG vaccination and
COVID-19 mitigation (Shet et al., 2020).
To contribute to this discussion, parameters in Table I will be compared with the
existence of vaccination for each country as indicated in column eight of this Table. Data for BCG vaccination
were obtained from a World Atlas on the subject (Zwerling et al., 2011).
RESULTS
We have chosen the case of South Korea to illustrate the method. This is presented in
Fig. 1, where the graphical parameters included in Table I and in the previous algebra are presented.

Fig. 1. The upper panel presents the daily cases for South Korea (circles) and the adjusting Gaussian. The single dashed
arrow identifies AC; the double arrow identifies C , and the single vertical arrow marks tC . The lower panel plots nC(t),
the accumulated number of infected patients (circles), that smoothly lay on the curve which is the integral of the fitting
Gaussian function on top GC(t), without further adjustments. A possible value for nC(), namely NC, is identified by a
dashed arrow to the left

Australia, Germany, Spain, and United Kingdom (UK) is shown in Fig. 2 for different stages of the
Gaussian fit: 8/8, 7/8, 6/8, and 5/8 respectively. Obviously the quality of the information extracted from this
procedure relies on the stage of this process. Moreover, local outbreaks or a general new wave can modify
this description, which is nothing but a snapshot taken on April 29, 2020.
We complemented this static analysis with dynamic calculations for the last week (7
days) ending on April 19, which is day 0, going back to April 13, which is day -6. Each of these 7 settings
means a complete set of parameters. We focus here on the daily FWHM values for each country, namely
γC(t). Fig. 3 plots the weekly average <γC> for all countries in Table I, with error bars obtained from the
corresponding standard deviations. The inset shows the function γC(t) for five selected countries, with
Australia already stabilized and the other tending to larger values of γC(t); the case of Brazil is quite different
reflecting great dispersion and oscillations of the reported data.

Fig. 3 Average FWHM values with error bars for a week towards the end of this study. The insert presents functions
γC(t) for 5 selected countries showing different behavior.

DISCUSSION
Despite fluctuations in the daily cases of COVID-19, it is possible in general to adjust
a Gaussian function to high density sets of data pointing to a possible mathematical description of the
evolution of the pandemic in different countries, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2. The error bars obtained from a
week in Fig. 3 indicate the stability of the data for different countries.
Table I orders the 17 countries according to increasing values of FC. However, this is
intended just to provide a rapid indication of the status of the country at the moment this snapshot was taken
(April 29, 2020). The analysis should continue to correlate this figure of merit with other relevant parameters.
It is clear that testing plays a crucial role is the prevention of any epidemic and it is also
the case for COVID-19. Thus, UC(t) appears directly in the denominator of Eq. (7) and indirectly in the
mortality rate MC(t). This is the main reason to bring Brazil and Mexico to the end of the Table, but the
relatively large Gaussian parameters also contribute to their high FC values.
The eighth column of Table I reports on the country's policy regarding mass vaccination
for BCG (tuberculosis): “Yes” means that vaccination has been permanently imposed in this country for
decades; “No” means that mass BCG inoculation was never imposed; the year indicates when mass BCG
inoculation was stopped in this country. As it can be seen, countries with permanent BCG vaccination tend
to have low FC values, while countries where vaccination was never present or stopped a long time ago tend
to have high values for the figure of merit proposed here. Norway and Switzerland have similar normalized

testing TC (35.0, 33.1) but a large difference in their FC values: 10.3 and 57.7 respectively. It is clear that the
main difference relays in the value of AC, namely under similar conditions these two European countries
present very different contagion propagation. What makes the difference? Norway has maintained massive
BCG vaccination while Switzerland stopped it in 1987. A similar comparison can be performed between
Chile and The Netherlands with similar population and normalized testing, the former with massive BCG
vaccination while the latter never had it. This is also evident when comparing neighboring countries with
similar culture and ethnic composition: Norway (Yes for BCG vaccination) has better FC than Sweden (No
for BCG vaccination; not in Table I); the same comparison holds for Portugal (not in Table I) and Spain. A
special situation is found for UK: vaccination was started decades after it had been in effect in continental
Europe and it was also stopped after most European countries did. However, the net effect in number of years
without vaccination for the presently living population is similar to other European countries.
However, the most dramatic example of a small country with no permanent BCG
vaccination is Ecuador, the only one in South America unprotected from tuberculosis. Our attempts to include
it in the present study failed due to the low quality of the data: DC(t) looks like a sequence of random numbers
rather than the description of a phenomenon obeying natural laws. Very recently, government officials in
Quito acknowledged that there was large numbers of unaccounted contagions and deaths (The Guardian,
2020).
USA has the higher FC value among the countries that never had massive BCG
vaccination; however, USA receives large amount of immigrants from countries where BCG vaccine is given
to babies and kids, so most of the immigrants have it. The other three countries without permanent BCG
vaccination occupy places at the bottom of Table I. The only country with permanent BCG vaccination found
in the lower places of Table I is Iran, which has a poor testing density and high mortality rate. Although BCG
inoculation does not immunize against COVID-19 it helps to control the expansion of the disease to some
extent. Obviously, it is not enough: Brazil and Mexico have massive BCG vaccination, but other conditions
have to be fulfilled in order to cope with the virus expansion.
Let us have a look to the upper part of the Table, with FC under 30. What are the
common features of these countries: Testing density TC over 10.0; mortality rates MC under 5.0; permanent
or partial BCG vaccination; good or partial control of the daily contagions as appreciated from the Gaussian
fits. At this moment there is nothing to be done with respect to BCG. However, testing can be increased,
medical facilities can be increased according to the reality of each country and social restrictions can be
imposed to help to control the disease. The right combination of these ingredients and other regional
parameters need to be evaluated locally.
In addition, we also examined the dynamic behavior of the data over one week to find
out if the Gaussian adjustments γC(t) are already stabilized. This is shown by the error bars in Fig. 3; recent
trends are seen from graphs such as those included in the inset of this figure. The abscissa carries the 17
countries in increasing order of the error bars. Although the average widths of the Gaussians are scattered
around 30 days, the daily oscillations themselves can be huge. Brazil is a case on its own: the huge oscillations
shown in Fig. 3 continued in the following days to the point that after April 25 was impossible to fit a
Gaussian any more. That is the reason AC and C for Brazil in Table I had to be calculated on April 24 to
have some crude approximation for these parameters. In a sense, the huge error bar for Brazil in Fig. 3 was
an announcement of the upcoming instability regime to come. Mexico and to a lower extent Chile and
Belgium can fall in this oscillatory regime if no appropriate measures are taken soon.
Which is the optimal way to control COVID-19? There are two possible scenarios: A)
with a vaccine against this virus, B) without such vaccine. At the moment this is a bet although there are
promising news revealing progress in the development of the vaccine. Let us discuss both alternatives. A) In
this case the optimal situation is a short critical period affecting the economy (small ΓC), a low value of the
demand of medical facilities (small AC), which combine to a low value of the figure of merit FC. In addition,
small error bars on the stabilized Gaussian functions ensure stability of this evaluation. Evidently, this
requires strong measures over vast extensions of the territory to keep these indicators low all the times; the
measures that lead to control the disease cannot be entirely relaxed. In the meanwhile the vaccine is produced
in large quantities to inoculate all the population. Australia, South Korea, Israel, and Norway (on three
different continents) have proven that this optimization is feasible. B) Without vaccine we must assume that
many people will be infected sooner or later, and NC will represent a substantial portion of the population. In

this scenario, the only possible strategy is to try to keep AC under the medical capabilities of the country upon
diluting the infected cases in time meaning a large value of ΓC. From the countries listed in Table I, Spain,
Italy, Belgium, United Kingdom and Netherlands present high values for the parameters considered here in
coincidence with what is known as we finish writing this paper. At the moment Brazil and Mexico present
unpredictable scenarios.
Countries of small population size seem to contain COVID-19 in a more efficient way.
However, this is not a rule of thumb. Switzerland, The Netherlands and Belgium in spite of having
populations under 18 million people, their indicators are similar to others in their neighboring countries. Thus,
geography also plays a role and isolated countries like Australia and South Korea seem to have taken
advantage of this fact.
Large countries without BCG massive vaccination seem to be the places where COVID19 is harder to control. From those included in Table I we should mention USA, Spain, Italy, and UK. Of
course USA stands out due to its large population (with a large portion of elderly people), diversity, and
commuting networks. To get another point of view on this issue, we consider the three countries with the
highest FC values in Table I, looking for the number of days it took in each case to go from 1000 to 10000
contagions. After linear interpolations the results are the following: UK 11.9 days, Italy 10.5 days and Spain
12.2 days, with countries ordered by decreasing population. This evidences the fast surge that occurred in
Italy: in a few days the numbers of contagions skyrocketed. In addition we can pay attention to the date the
number of accumulated cases overcame 10,000 people in these countries: March 10 in Italy, March 17 in
Spain, and March 26 in UK.
The propagation of COVID-19 has been from East to West and later from North to
South in the Americas. Eventually, this explains the large error bars for the South American countries in Fig.
3. In this moment most of the countries in South America are on the apex of their respective fitting Gaussians,
showing the strong oscillations other countries have previously experienced (See Fig. 2). We also tried to
include Argentina in the present study, but the data structure is rather strange, showing days without
information. Its test density is only 1.7, similar to Brazil. This is just to mention that data quality is very
uneven making it difficult to analyze just one indicator so it is necessary to combine several of them.
CONCLUSIONS
The method presented here provides a quick way to estimate the impact of COVID-19
in different countries and territories. Daily new cases can be adjusted using a Gaussian function whose
FWHM (ΓC) measures the duration of the critical part of the epidemic having effects mainly on the
economy. The height of the Gaussian AC measures the possible response to the maximum demand of
medical facilities.
Previous parameters can be combined with the testing density and the mortality rate to
produce a figure of merit FC with a range of values spanning over 2 orders of magnitude, providing an easy
quick test for the status of the pandemic in a territory allowing to for comparisons and early detection of
tendencies. An analysis based on a week of continuous data allows to find standard deviations that indicate
whether the Gaussian describing each country is stabilized.
Countries with stabilized Gaussian functions and relatively low values of FC show a
more manageable evolution of the disease. Generally speaking, these countries have reported ongoing mass
vaccination with BCG, a relationship that should be further investigated. Small isolated countries seem to be
in better conditions to impose measures that effectively stop the spread of COVID-19. Controlling the spread
of the pandemic up to the turning point (tC) seems to be possible everywhere; beyond this point progress is
hard for most of the countries as revealed by the difficulty in stabilizing the Gaussian curves adjusting to the
progression of the daily cases. However, some countries have succeeded to get over this curve, reporting a
number of daily cases of less than 10 % the maximum of the Gaussian (AC), which evolves in the form of a
very slow decay.
Without a vaccine against COVID-19 our only way to stop it is a global response to
contain the virus, isolate it and let it die. This requires common efforts, based on rapid indicators easy to
obtain at present times. Our work aims to that purpose and we believe that our parameter FC, eventually
complemented with indicators coming from other studies, provides information to make progress in this
