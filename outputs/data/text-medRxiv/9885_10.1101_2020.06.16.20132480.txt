COVID-19 vaccination uptake

Abstract
Objectives: Development of a vaccine against COVID-19 will be key to controlling the pandemic. We
need to understand the barriers and facilitators to receiving a future COVID-19 vaccine so that we
can provide recommendations for the design of interventions aimed at maximising public
acceptance.

Design: Cross-sectional UK survey with older adults and patients with chronic respiratory disease.
Methods: During the UK’s early April 2020 ‘lockdown’ period, 527 participants (311 older adults,
mean age = 70.4 years; 216 chronic respiratory participants, mean age = 43.8 years) completed an
online questionnaire assessing willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, perceptions of COVID-19,
and intention to receive influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations. A free text response (n=502)
examined barriers and facilitators to uptake. The Behaviour Change Wheel informed the analysis of
these responses, which were coded to the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). Behaviour change
techniques (BCTs) were identified.

Results: Eighty-six percent of respondents want to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. This was positively
correlated with the perception that COVID-19 will persist over time, and negatively associated with
perceiving the media to have over-exaggerated the risk. The majority of barriers and facilitators
were mapped onto the ‘beliefs about consequences’ TDF domain, with themes relating to personal
health, health consequences to others, concerns of vaccine safety, and severity of COVID-19.

Conclusions: Willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccination is currently high among high-risk
individuals. Mass media interventions aimed at maximising vaccine uptake should utilise the BCTs of
information about health, emotional, social and environmental consequences, and salience of
consequences.
Keywords: COVID-19, vaccination, pandemic, theoretical domains framework, behaviour change

Statement of Contribution

What is already known on this subject?
•

Uptake of a vaccine for COVID-19 will be vital for controlling the pandemic, but the success
of this strategy relies on public acceptance of the vaccine.

•

Uptake of vaccinations and public confidence in vaccines has been falling in recent years.

•

Evidence suggests that 74% of the French population want to receive a COVID-19
vaccination.

What does this study add?
•

This study found that 86% of our sample of high-risk participants in the UK are willing to
receive a future vaccine for COVID-19.

•

This study showed that perceived barriers and facilitators to uptake of the COVID-19
vaccination concentrated on the ‘beliefs about consequences’ TDF domain.

•

This study suggests that the content of mass media interventions to improve vaccine uptake
should focus on the BCTs of information about health, emotional, social and environmental
consequences, and salience of consequences. These techniques should be pitched in relation
to both self and, most importantly, to others.

COVID-19 vaccination uptake

Introduction
Vaccination will be vitally important in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic and bringing an end to
social distancing, with researchers worldwide working to develop and test a vaccine. However, the
success of this strategy relies upon public acceptance of the vaccine. At the time of writing, 115
vaccine candidates are in development and there is an indication that vaccines could be available for
emergency use by early 2021 (Thanh Le et al., 2020). In recent years, vaccination rates and public
confidence in vaccines has been falling (Larson et al., 2016); a pattern observed in childhood
immunisations, such as measles, and in adult vaccination programmes. For example, seasonal
influenza vaccination uptake, even among those who are at high risk (e.g. those with chronic
illnesses), is typically less than 50%, which falls substantially below the World Health Organisation
(WHO) target of 75% (Jorgensen et al., 2018). Recent findings from the Wellcome Global Monitor
showed that only 59% of people in Western Europe believe that vaccines are safe (Wellcome Trust,
2019). Therefore, the current study investigated the barriers and facilitators of uptake of a future
COVID-19 vaccination. We then used this information, and the framework of The Behaviour Change
Wheel (BCW; Michie, Atkins & West, 2014), to make recommendations about the design of
interventions aimed at maximising vaccine uptake by the public.
Vaccine hesitancy was evident during the last worldwide pandemic (H1N1 “swine flu” in 2009), with
data indicating that vaccination uptake was variable. Most countries reported that less than half of
the target population received the vaccine (Brien et al., 2012). The target population varied by
country with some countries aiming to vaccinate the whole population and others only offering the
vaccine to particular groups (e.g. health professionals, children, people with chronic disease,
pregnant women). A systematic review by Bish et al. (2011) examined the factors associated with
vaccination uptake during that pandemic. They found that stronger vaccination intentions and
higher vaccination uptake were related to the degree of threat experienced and perceptions of
vaccination as an effective coping strategy. Research also showed that the majority of the public felt

that they had a low risk of acquiring H1N1 (Davis et al., 2015; Seale et al., 2010). In addition, nonuptake was related to concerns about the safety of the vaccine (Han et al., 2016) and the belief that
the vaccine had not been properly tested and was rushed into circulation (Fabry et al., 2011; Seale et
al., 2010).
There are key differences between the current COVID-19 pandemic and the 2009 pandemic. Most
notably, the 2009 pandemic was categorised as ‘moderate’ by the WHO, and most people who were
infected had mild symptoms (Wu et al., 2010). In contrast, indications are that the COVID-19
pandemic is more contagious and has a higher mortality rate than the 2009 pandemic. Relatedly, the
pandemic has brought severe restrictions in travel and daily activity across the globe. Consequently,
perceptions of risk related to COVID-19 are likely to be higher than for the 2009 pandemic, which
may in turn increase uptake of vaccination (Brewer et al., 2007).
Early evidence relating to potential COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy comes from France. In a survey of a
representative sample of the French population ten days after the nationwide lockdown was
introduced, 26% of respondents said they would not want to receive a future vaccine for COVID-19
(The COCONEL Group, 2020). This was higher among low-income participants (37%), and also
prevalent among people aged older than 75 years (22%) who are at high-risk for COVID-19.
However, it is important to note that this study was conducted at an early stage of the pandemic.
Intention to receive a future vaccine may now have increased as the pandemic has progressed, with
perceptions on severity potentially increasing in line with the increasing numbers of those affected.
More recently, a study reported more positive views relating to a COVID-19 vaccine among
Australian adults, with only 4.9% stating they would not get the vaccine, and 9.4% stating
indifference. These beliefs were associated with lower education levels and health literacy, and the
belief that the threat of COVID-19 had been exaggerated (Dodd et al., 2020).
The current study aimed to identify and understand the barriers and facilitators to receiving a future
COVID-19 vaccine and, using the BCW as a framework (Michie et al., 2014), provide

recommendations for the design of interventions aimed at maximising uptake of the vaccine among
the public. The BCW provides a useful framework for designing interventions. It is based on the
synthesis of 19 existing behaviour change frameworks, and has the Capability Opportunity
Motivation-Behaviour (COM-B) model at the centre (Michie, Stralen, & West, 2011). The COM-B
model describes behaviour as the interaction between an individual’s capability, opportunity and
motivation to engage in the behaviour with six components that drive behaviour (i.e. physical
capability, psychological capability, physical opportunity, social opportunity, reflective motivation,
and automatic motivation). These COM-B components are linked to intervention functions (i.e.
education, persuasion, incentivisation, coercion, training, enablement, modelling, environmental
restructuring, restrictions) through which an intervention can change behaviour, and seven broad
policy categories (i.e. guidelines, environmental/ social planning, communication/ marketing,
legislation, service provision, regulation, fiscal measures). Intervention functions are then linked to
behaviour change techniques (BCTs), which are the observable, replicable and irreducible active
ingredients of an intervention (Cane et al., 2012, 2015; Michie et al., 2014), with BCT groupings of
goals and planning, feedback and monitoring, social support, shaping knowledge, natural
consequences, comparison of behaviour, associations, repetition and substitution, comparison of
outcomes, reward and threat, regulation, antecedents, identity, scheduled consequences, self-belief,
and covert learning.
The present study has four key research questions (RQs):

RQ1: What proportion of participants are willing to receive a vaccination for COVID-19 if it becomes
available, and what are the associated psychological and socio-demographic factors?

RQ2: What are the factors that would shape the participants’ COVID-19 vaccination behaviour, and
which theoretical domains are key in shaping this behaviour?

RQ3: What key themes are present within the most dominant theoretical domain and what do these
suggest about future intervention content?

RQ4: What are the relevant intervention functions and associated behaviour change techniques that
we can use to provide potential evidence-based and theoretically informed future intervention
content?

Methods
Data collection took place for ten days from 1st April 2020, spanning the second and third weeks of
lockdown in the UK. At that time, the COVID-19 vaccination was in early development, with the first
human trial of the vaccine commencing on 23rd April 2020 in the UK. The sample for the present
study had previously been recruited for two ongoing projects examining vaccination behaviour more
broadly. Ethical approval was received from the University Ethics Committee to extend these studies
by contacting participants and inviting them to answer questions relating to COVID-19. Participants
completed an online questionnaire assessing their views on COVID-19. The questionnaire included a
free text response in order to gather qualitative data regarding barriers and facilitators to
vaccination, with responses mapped to the TDF.

Participants and procedure
The present sample comprised 527 participants (57% female) with a mean age of 59.5 years old (SD
= 16). This represented a convenience sample recruited to purposive criteria. Of those, 311 were
older adults, and 216 had chronic respiratory disease. In order to be part of the original older adult
vaccination study, participants had to be aged 65+ (i.e., the age required to be offered the annual flu
vaccination free of charge) and living independently. In order to be part of the chronic respiratory
disease sample, participants had to be aged 18-64 with a chronic respiratory disease (e.g. asthma or
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]). These participants were originally recruited via
social media adverts, partner organisations, and University participant panels. For the current study,
participants received an email inviting them to take part in this additional wave of data collection

relating to COVID-19. Participants accessed the questionnaire by clicking on the Qualtrics link
contained within their invitation email.

Questionnaire
Perceptions of COVID-19
Seven items were used to assess perceptions of COVID-19. The items were selected from previous
research on perceptions of the 2009 pandemic (Rubin et al., 2009; Williams et al., 2012) and
assessed: likelihood of infection (“How likely do you think it is that you will contract coronavirus
(COVID-19) over the next six months”), with response options ranging from ‘very unlikely’ (1) to ‘very
likely’ (4); severity of illness (“I think if I catch coronavirus it will have major consequences for my
life”), timeline for the outbreak (“In my opinion, the coronavirus outbreak is going to continue for a
long time”), exaggeration of the risk (“I think the media have over-exaggerated the risks of catching
coronavirus”), good information (“Overall, the information about coronavirus has been clear”), and
trust in authorities (“In general, I think the authorities are acting in the public’s best interest in
dealing with the coronavirus outbreak”), all of which had response options of ‘strongly agree’ (5) to
‘strongly disagree’ (1); and, finally, worry (“How worried or anxious are you about coronavirus”) with
response options of ‘not at all worried’ (1) to ‘very worried’ (4).
COVID-19 vaccination intention
We asked “If a vaccine for coronavirus becomes available, would you want to receive it?” and
provided response options from ‘I definitely would not want to receive it’ (1) to ‘I definitely would
want to receive it’ (5). In addition, participants were asked, “What are the factors that would
influence this decision” and provided a free text response option.

Participants were asked “Do you think the current coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic will influence
your decision about whether or not to receive the annual flu vaccination in the future?” with
response options including ‘Yes, it will make me more likely to get the annual flu vaccine’, ‘Yes, it will
make me less likely to get the annual flu vaccine’, and ‘No, it will not influence my decision’. The
older adult participants were also asked this question in relation to the pneumococcal (pneumonia)
vaccination.

Analysis
For RQ1, descriptive statistics were computed, showing the proportion of participants who are
willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, and those who think COVID-19 will influence their vaccination
behaviour in general. T-tests and chi-square were then used to examine any differences in vaccine
willingness across gender or deprivation level, respectively. Next, correlation analyses were
performed to examine the associations between vaccine willingness, age, and perceptions of COVID19. Missing data was minimal, typically less than 1% for most questions.

Content analysis of free text response
For RQ2, we performed directed content analysis of the responses based on the TDF (Atkins et al.,
2017; Hsieh & Shannon, 2005). The TDF comprises 14 broad theoretical domains (i.e. knowledge;
skills; social/ professional role and identity; beliefs about capabilities; optimism; beliefs about
consequences; reinforcement; intentions; goals; memory, attention and decision processes;
environmental context and resources; social influences; emotion; behavioural regulation),
synthesising many diverse yet related theoretical constructs. It is a useful tool that can be used to
describe the causal mechanisms that shape behaviours of interest. Our free text response invited
people to detail their perceptions of the factors that would shape their COVID-19 vaccination

behaviour. Responses were initially coded by AG against the TDF domains. LW and PF then checked
the coding for a random sample of 30% of the comments. Following rounds of discussion concerning
the very few areas of disagreement, 100% agreement in coding was achieved. In this way, we
derived a clear sense of which theoretical domains were important in shaping COVID-19 vaccination
behaviour, and which might present useful causal mechanisms to address in future interventions.
Next for RQ3, in an attempt to provide a further more granular level of suggestions for future
intervention content, we conducted further thematic analysis of the most dominant theoretical
domain we found within the data (Braun & Clarke, 2006). This was conducted by AG, and the themes
were refined through discussion with PF. As the majority of comments (90%) were coded under the
beliefs about consequences domain, thematic analysis was applied within this domain only.
Finally for RQ4, to suggest future intervention content that was both evidence-based and
theoretically informed analysis we used the BCW approach. Subsequently, we mapped the relevant
intervention functions and associated BCTs to the key TDF domains we had identified were prevalent
within our sample (Cane et al., 2015; Michie et al., 2013). This work was conducted by LW and PF.

Results

RQ1 - COVID-19 vaccination willingness
Our sample characteristics (Table 1) show that this is an older sample (due to the inclusion of adults
aged 65+ as one of the high-risk groups), and that the participants are generally well-educated with
more than half the sample having being educated at degree or postgraduate level. The sample is
well balanced in terms of gender profile (56.7% female) and deprivation category. We found that
58% of the sample (n=307) would definitely want to receive a vaccine for COVID-19 once it becomes
available, and 27% (n=143) probably would want to receive it (see Table 1). However, 7% were
unsure (n=38), 2% (n=9) would probably not want to receive it, and 6% (n=29) would definitely not

want to receive it. There were no differences between the older adult group and the chronic
respiratory group in terms of willingness to receive the vaccine, t (1, 524) = .279, p=.78, or any
differences between males and females, t (1, 523) = 1.45, p=.14. There were also no differences in
willingness to have the vaccine based on socio-economic status (assessed by post-code indicated
deprivation quintile; X2 (5, n = 497) = 6.32, p = .98).
In terms of the impact of COVID-19 on future vaccination behaviour in general, 202 participants
(38%) stated that COVID-19 will make them more likely to receive the annual flu vaccination in the
future, with 1% (n=5) stating it would make them less likely, and 61% (n=318) saying it would not
influence their decision. Among older adult participants eligible for the one-off pneumococcal
vaccine, but who had not opted to receive it previously, 51% (n=53) said they would now be more
likely to get the vaccine in future.

Correlation analysis
The Pearson’s correlation analysis (Table 2) showed that willingness to receive a COVID-19
vaccination was positively associated with the belief that the COVID-19 outbreak is going to continue
for a long time, and negatively associated with the belief that the media has over-exaggerated the
risks of catching COVID-19. There were no significant correlations between intention to vaccinate
and the other questions tapping perceptions of COVID-19, or with age. Higher levels of worry about
COVID-19 were positively associated with perceived likelihood of infection, severity, and timeline,
and negatively associated with media over-exaggeration and age.

Ninety three percent of the sample provided responses to the free text question (“What are the
factors that would influence this decision” [receiving a vaccine for corona virus]) resulting in 502
comments for TDF coding. Comments were typically short. Nine responses were mapped to two TDF
domains as they described multiple influences on vaccination behaviour. All other responses were
mapped to one TDF domain. Eight of the fourteen domains were identified across the responses:
beliefs about consequences (n=455 responses), knowledge (n=27), environmental context and
resources (n=11), social influences (n=7), emotion (n= 6), social/professional role and identity (n=2),
optimism (n=2), and behavioural regulation (n=1). As 90% of comments were coded under the
beliefs about consequences domain, thematic analysis was applied within this domain to gain more
insight into the barriers and facilitators to COVID-19 vaccine uptake. A summary of the key TDF
domains mapped to relevant intervention functions and BCTs is shown in Table 3.

RQ3 - Thematic analysis of the TDF domain ‘Beliefs about consequences’
Three facilitators and one barrier were identified from thematic analysis of comments within the
beliefs about consequences domain. ‘Personal health’ (n=176 responses), ‘severity of COVID-19
disease’ (n=85), and ‘health consequences to others’ (n=36), and were viewed as factors which
facilitated vaccination, while ‘concerns about vaccine safety’ (n=158) was considered a barrier to
vaccine uptake.
Personal health (facilitator)
Participants primarily described feeling particularly susceptible to contracting the virus. Risk factors
included older age (“age and underlying medical condition makes me vulnerable” [female, aged 70]),
having a chronic lung condition or other co-morbidities (“I have asthma so any chest infections put
me at risk” [female, aged 57]), and working in a high-risk profession. Feeling vulnerable due to these
risk factors, participants emphasised that vaccination against COVID-19 would provide a sense of

protection (“I have a number of co-morbidities so feel it is important to take the protection which is
offered” [female, aged 68]), and could help maintain their long-term health by gaining antibodies
and immunity to the disease.
Severity of COVID-19 disease (facilitator)
Concerns of contracting COVID-19 disease and the highly contagious nature of the virus were
highlighted by respondents as factors to vaccinate. The severity of contracting COVID-19, and the
fear of possibly dying from the disease, were motivators for participants to vaccinate (“Having seen
young healthy people pass away from this disease I don't think I would stand a chance against it”
[male, aged 36]; “…the worry and dread of coming into contact with a disease which can have such
dire consequences” [female, aged 68]). Additionally, participants noted that vaccination could offer
immediate protection from the disease in addition to potential outbreak ‘waves’ in the future (“this
disease could come back and if we have vaccine that can prevent it then I would want it” [male, aged
70]).
Health consequences to others (facilitator)
Achieving herd immunity and protecting the health of others were considered benefits to
vaccinating by participants. Contributing to achieving herd immunity against COVID-19 was a driving
factor to vaccination for participants, with some participants considering it a ‘civic duty’ to vaccinate
(“it helps to build up herd immunity and protect everyone, not just me” [female, aged 67]).
Protecting others, at community and global levels, was a common factor associated with vaccine
uptake, in addition to protecting family members and friends (“need to protect the human race from
this new biological nightmare” [male, aged 67]). Protecting family members was especially
important to participants if they felt their family members were in a high risk or vulnerable group for
contracting COVID-19 (“wife has asthma so want to do it to keep her safe” [male, aged 66]).
Participants also described how they would vaccinate if it assisted with ending the COVID-19

pandemic, and eliminating the need for the physical distancing and self-isolation safety measures in
place (“so we never have to go through this again” [female, aged 75]).

Concerns of vaccine safety (barrier)
As the COVID-19 vaccination is still under development at the time of this study, barriers to vaccine
uptake from participants primarily centred on the newness of the vaccine and its safety and
effectiveness (“a bit sceptical as it would be a new vaccine” [female, aged 41]). Participants felt that
the development of COVID-19 vaccines may be rushed, and that vaccination safety measures could
be overlooked in the development process (“I would want to feel sure that it was safe and effective.
I would not want a rushed to market vaccine” [female, aged 65]). Participants wanted assurance the
vaccine was safe and effective at preventing disease prior to vaccination. The level of these safety
and effectiveness concerns varied, with some participants stating they would want to see how safe it
was before getting vaccinated (“as long as it is proven safe and effective, I would have it” [male,
aged 74]), while others said they may wait years before getting vaccinated to see the longer-term
effects of the vaccine (“how safe the vaccine is. I would probably wait a year or two to see how safe
it is before getting it myself” [female, aged 36]). Possible vaccine side effects and severity of side
effects were also cited as influences on the decision to vaccinate against COVID-19 (“how well tested
the vaccine was, the side effects and interactions weighed against the chance of contracting and
potential consequences coronavirus” [female, aged 60]).
Although there were many comments surrounding safety concerns of a COVID-19 vaccine, some
participants felt positively about the vaccine. These participants believed in the personal and
community benefits of vaccinations in general, and with reassurance of the new vaccine’s safety,
would ‘certainly’ want to receive it (“trialling and testing, any potential effects a new vaccine could
have. Should it be trialled and proven safe, I would take it” [female, aged 35]). Reasons to vaccinate

the disease if they were still to contract the virus (“in order to reduce the chance of catching COVID19 or at least having a milder attack than otherwise” [female, aged 71]).

RQ4 – Potential evidence-based and theoretically informed future intervention content
Table 3 shows how our BCW analysis on the thematic analysis of ‘beliefs about consequences’
concerning vaccination behaviour. We tabularise the key thematic findings, the relevant intervention
functions and appropriate behaviour change techniques. In the right hand column we operationalise
this suggested intervention content into potential intervention ideas that could form the basis of
further focussed intervention development work.
Overall our suggestions here focus on suggesting ways of encouraging a decisional balance amongst
those with some hesitancy to enhance vaccination uptake. This could be achieved through
intervention materials fostering the appraisal of an array of consequences of vaccination; for both
self but particularly in relation to others.

Discussion
To our knowledge, this study is the first in the world to examine the public’s perceived barriers and
facilitators around future COVID-19 vaccination. It presents novel findings that may shape future
policy, practice and intervention development. The study aimed to identify the facilitators and
barriers to uptake of a future COVID-19 vaccine, specifically within high-risk populations (older
adults aged 65+, and young/middle-aged adults with chronic respiratory disease). We have identified
that willingness to receive a vaccination for COVID-19 is currently high among at-risk adults in the

UK, with 86% indicating they would want to receive it. Given the general decline in vaccination
uptake and trust observed in recent years (Larson et al., 2016), the figure of 86% is very promising.
However, even in this high-risk sample, there is still a sizable proportion of people who are either
undecided or who do not want to receive a COVID-19 vaccination. Reluctance to receive the vaccine
was associated with the belief that the media have over-exaggerated the risks of COVID-19 and that
the timeline for the outbreak will be short.
Promisingly, our data also suggest that COVID-19 may have a substantial and positive impact on
vaccination behaviour in general, with 38% saying it will make them more likely to get the annual flu
vaccination, and 51% saying they will now be more likely to receive the one-off pneumococcal
vaccination. These figures suggest positive unintended consequences of COVID-19 on vaccine
hesitancy in general. Unintended consequences are usually linked to interventions, whereby the
intervention can have either positive or negative effects which were not planned by those
implementing them (Oliver et al., 2019). In the current context, lockdown can be theorised as a
complex public health intervention, which has had the unintended positive consequence of driving
up demand for vaccines in general, as individuals seek more protection for their health. It will also be
of interest to examine if there are other potentially related unintended positive consequences, such
as increased uptake of screening opportunities.
Analysis of the open-ended responses showed that the beliefs about consequences TDF domain
provides the greatest insight into the determinants of COVID-19 vaccination intention. We identified
four key themes that chime with core components of many theories and models from health
psychology that aim to explain behaviour (e.g. Rosenstock, 1974). First, personal health, chiming
with the theoretical construct of personal susceptibility, which described participants feeling at risk
of contracting the virus, and acted as a facilitator to vaccination as the vaccine was seen to offer
protection. The second facilitator to vaccination was perceptions of the severity of COVID-19
disease, with participants noting the contagious nature of the illness and their fear of dying from it.

These perceptions regarding the contagiousness and seriousness of COVID-19 are in contrast to the
perceptions of the 2009 pandemic, where the public perceived that they had a low risk of acquiring
H1N1 (Seale et al., 2010). The final facilitator was health consequences to others, with participants
describing the importance to achieving herd immunity and protecting their loved ones. The key
barrier to vaccination was concerns of vaccine safety, echoing ideas of response efficacy (e.g. Rogers,
1975), with participants noting concerns about the vaccine being rushed into development. This
concern regarding the safety of a future vaccine is similar to the findings from the 2009 pandemic
where non-uptake was associated with the belief that the vaccine had not been properly tested and
was rushed into circulation (Fabry et al., 2011).
Using the BCW (Michie et al., 2014), we identified several intervention functions. In the current
context, the functions of education and persuasion are likely to be the most useful. Education can
improve knowledge of susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 and the effectiveness of vaccination,
while persuasion can be used to change beliefs and encourage action towards vaccination. In terms
of content of these mass media interventions, we identified a number of potential BCTs that
reflected the beliefs about consequences domain of the TDF (see Table 3 for detail). As the
vaccination is likely to be needed at a population-level, the mode of delivery for an intervention
could be a combination of mass media (e.g.TV and radio, print media), the social media, and working
closely with broadcasters and journalists to manage consistent messaging and challenge misinformation (Davis et al., 2020). A coherent media presence would enable the communication of
strong descriptive and injunctive social norms concerning COVID-19 vaccination.
Further intervention development work could examine how interventions to enhance COVID-19
vaccine uptake (and uptake of the seasonal influenza vaccine this year) could potentially build upon
the publics’ prior investment in COVID related behaviour change. This might include framing the
intervention as associated with compliance with the lockdown, and draw explicitly upon existing
intervention messaging, for example ‘We’re in this together’ and the protective discourse implied

within phrases like ‘shielding’. In this way, vaccination behaviours could ‘piggy-back’ onto the wider
behavioural system of COVID-related change. Intervention content could connect disparate COVIDrelated behaviours, such as hand hygiene, social distancing and volunteering with vaccination
compliance.

Strengths and Limitations
Strengths of the study include the focus on two key populations (older adults and those with chronic
respiratory disease) who are at high-risk for COVID-19. In addition, the timing of the study means
that we can provide future-facing recommendations for future interventions aimed at maximising
uptake of the vaccine. There are also some limitations to the present study. The duration of data
collection was purposely focused during the UK peak and therefore relatively short. Our data
therefore provide an indication of vaccine willingness at a particular stage of the pandemic. Further
in-depth data collection is needed as the pandemic progresses in order to examine any changes in
vaccination intention. In addition, as data collection was performed online this may have limited
participation from older adults who do not use the internet. Moreover, our findings relate to a
vaccine that is currently in development, so side effects and safety are not yet known. We also do
not know if our findings would generalise to members of the public at lower risk of COVID-19, or if
the presence of multiple risk factors (e.g. older age and the presence of a chronic health condition)
would drive up willingness to receive the vaccine further. Furthermore, our BCW analysis is based on
limited qualitative data with no quantitative element. Further in-depth research focussed on
intervention development is therefore required.

Conclusions
Intention to receive a vaccine for COVID-19 is currently high (86%) among high-risk members of the
public. In addition, COVID-19 may have a positive effect on the uptake of vaccinations for annual
influenza and pneumonia. Perceived barriers and facilitators to uptake of the COVID-19 vaccination
concentrated on the beliefs about consequences TDF domain. Facilitators were perceptions of risk to

personal health, severity of COVID-19, and health consequences to others. Concerns about vaccine
safety acted as a barrier. The content of media interventions should focus on the BCTs of
information about health, emotional, social and environmental consequences, as well as the salience
of those consequences. This will provide the public with information about the beneficial
consequences of vaccination.

Potential intervention components to be explored
within subsequent studies
Interventions should primarily focus on those who
may be expressing vaccine hesitancy although
reinforcing vaccine uptake amongst those already
intending to vaccinate will also be important.
Intervention materials should consider directly
addressing the decisional balance for and against
vaccination (9.2).
Intervention materials must ensure people consider
the consequences of their individual vaccination
behaviour for themselves, but critically, also for
others; this could be linked to ideas of herd
immunity and framed about protecting family and
friends (5.3).
Intervention materials could combine the
comparative imagining (9.3) of future outcomes (e.g.
vaccinate or not) to assist with the decisional
balance at the heart of the proposed intervention.
Again the decisional balance should be have a clear
focus on consequences for others (5.3).
To assist with facilitating vaccination in those with
hesitancy, intervention materials could depict or
invite direct consideration to self and others of the
consequences of vaccination. This could directly
evoke consideration of the health consequences
(5.1), emotional consequences of vaccinating (5.6)
