Abstract
Objectives: Convalescent plasma (CP) as a passive source of neutralizing antibodies and
immunomodulators is a century-old therapeutic option used for the management of viral
diseases. We investigated its effectiveness for the treatment of COVID-19.
Design: Open-label, parallel-arm, phase II, multicentre, randomized controlled trial.
Setting: Thirty-nine public and private hospitals across India.
Participants: Hospitalized, moderately ill confirmed COVID-19 patients (PaO2/FiO2: 200-300
or respiratory rate > 24/min and SpO2 ≤ 93% on room air).
Intervention: Participants were randomized to either control (best standard of care (BSC)) or
intervention (CP + BSC) arm. Two doses of 200 mL CP was transfused 24 hours apart in the
intervention arm.
Main Outcome Measure: Composite of progression to severe disease (PaO2/FiO2<100) or allcause mortality at 28 days post-enrolment.
Results: Between 22nd April to 14th July 2020, 464 participants were enrolled; 235 and 229 in
intervention and control arm, respectively. Composite primary outcome was achieved in 44
(18.7%) participants in the intervention arm and 41 (17.9%) in the control arm [aOR: 1.09; 95%
CI: 0.67, 1.77]. Mortality was documented in 34 (14.5%) and 31 (13.5%) participants in
intervention and control arm, respectively [aOR) 1.06 95% CI: 0.61 to 1.83].
Interpretation: CP was not associated with reduction in mortality or progression to severe
COVID-19. This trial has high generalizability and approximates real-life setting of CP therapy
in settings with limited laboratory capacity. A priori measurement of neutralizing antibody titres
in donors and participants may further clarify the role of CP in management of COVID-19.
Trial registration: The trial was registered with Clinical Trial Registry of India (CTRI);
CTRI/2020/04/024775.

Introduction
With few specific therapeutic options available to manage infection with Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the novel coronavirus disease (COVID19) presents a unique set of challenges for healthcare providers globally. In addition to nonpharmacological interventions, health systems have responded by devising strategies to manage
COVID-19 using repurposed medications and revisiting older strategies, such as using
convalescent plasma (CP). CP is a passive immunization strategy which has been used on several
occasions in the past century, inspiring clinical expectations that it could emerge as a potential
therapy for a disease with no proven, effective interventions.1
CP is a source of anti-viral neutralizing antibodies (NAb). Other immune pathways such as
antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, complement activation, or phagocytosis are putative
mechanisms through which CP may exert its therapeutic effect in COVID-19 patients.2
Additionally, anti-inflammatory cytokines, defensins, pentraxins and other immunomodulatory
proteins may have a role in alleviating systemic inflammatory response syndrome, the main
pathophysiological basis for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and mortality from
COVID-19 pneumonia.2 Historically, CP has been used in viral diseases such as poliomyelitis,
measles, mumps and influenza in the pre-vaccine era and more recently, during the Influenza,
Ebola, and SARS coronavirus epidemics with varying degrees of success.3–5 A recent systematic
review on the use of CP in non-COVID-19 severe respiratory viral infections found no mortality
benefit.6 There is evidence that CP collected from COVID-19 survivors contains Receptor
Binding Domain specific antibodies with potent antiviral activity.7 However, effective titres of
NAb, optimal timing for CP therapy, optimal timing for plasma donation, and the severity class
of patients who are likely to benefit from CP therapy remains unclear.
Since the publication of the first case series from China, multiple observational studies have been
published, some on pre-print servers, highlighting the usefulness of CP in reducing mortality,
hospital stay and viral load in COVID-19 patients.8–12 Only two randomized controlled trials on
CP use in COVID-19 have been published, one from China and the other from the
Netherlands.13,14 Both were halted prematurely, the China study due to inadequate patient
enrolment and the one from the Netherlands due to a need to redesign the trial based on interim
findings. In both studies, no mortality benefit was noted, and the Dutch study raised uncertainties
regarding pre-transfusion antibody-status of patients as a potential factor in identifying
appropriate candidates for CP therapy.14 This uncertainty in the published evidence is reflected in
a recent systematic review, which remained undecided on both the safety and effectiveness of CP
as a therapeutic option in hospitalized patients of COVID-19.15 Meanwhile, CP therapy has
received regulatory approval for use in patients in different countries. This has resulted in its
widespread adoption in real-world clinical practice, where it is being used to treat COVID-19
patients with a wide spectrum of disease severity.16,17 Given these uncertainties, we undertook
the current study to determine the effectiveness of using CP in moderately ill COVID-19 patients
admitted to hospitals across India in limiting progression to severe disease and determine the
associated short-term adverse effects.

Participants
Patients aged at least 18 years who were confirmed to have COVID-19 based on a positive
SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test and were admitted to the participating hospitals were screened for
eligibility and included if they were moderately ill with either partial pressure of oxygen in
arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) ratio between 200-300 or respiratory rate
>24/min with SpO2 < 93% on room air,17 and if matched donor CP was available at the point of
enrolment. Pregnant and lactating women, patients with known hypersensitivity to blood
products, recipients of immunoglobulin in the last 30 days, patients with conditions precluding
infusion of blood products, participants in any other clinical trials and critically ill patients with
PaO2/ FiO2 < 200 or shock (requiring vasopressors to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP)
>= 65 or MAP < 65) were considered ineligible to participate.
Eligible donors were either males or nulliparous females aged between 18-65 years, weighing
over 50 kg, who had received a diagnosis of COVID-19 confirmed with a positive RT-PCR test,
suffered from symptomatic COVID-19 with at least fever and cough, which had completely
resolved for a period of 28 consecutive days prior to donation or a period of 14 days prior to
donation with two negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests from nasopharyngeal swabs collected
24 hours apart. All routine screening tests including ABO blood grouping, Rh phenotype,
complete blood counts, screening for HIV, HBV, HCV, syphilis, malaria and total serum protein
were conducted as per the Drugs and Cosmetics (Second Amendment) Rules, 2020.18
All participants or their family members or legally authorized representatives were provided with
information regarding the trial in a language they were comfortable in, and written informed
consent was obtained prior to participant recruitment.
Randomization and Masking
The randomization sequence was generated using the RALLOC module in STATA v.14
(College Station, Texas, USA) by an independent biostatistician from the Indian Council
Medical Research-National Institute of Epidemiology (ICMR-NIE), Chennai, India. A stratified

block randomization strategy was used to allocate participants in a 1:1 ratio to receive either CP
with the best standard of care (BSC) (intervention arm) or BSC alone (control arm).
Stratification was done by sites; block randomization was done with unequal block sizes. After
obtaining written, informed consent from an eligible patient, the site investigators screened the
participant for recruitment, and called a member of the central trial coordinating team to receive
the randomization sequence, ensuring concealment of allocation.
Procedures
Patients enrolled in the control arm received BSC for COVID-19 in keeping with the institutional
protocol, which was dictated by the best available evidence at the time and guidelines for the
management of COVID-19 issued by the government health authorities. The range of treatment
protocols practised by the participating clinical sites for the management of COVID-19 patients
included: antivirals (Hydroxychloroquine, Remdesivir, Lopinavir/Ritonavir, Oseltamivir), broadspectrum antibiotics, immunomodulators (steroids, Tocilizumab) and supportive management
(oxygen via nasal cannula, face mask, non-rebreathing face mask; non-invasive or invasive
mechanical ventilation; awake proning). The decision to transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU)
was dependent on the policies of the individual trial sites.
The intervention arm received two doses of 200 mL of CP, transfused 24 hours apart, in addition
to the BSC. The two plasma units were collected preferably from different donors depending on
the availability and ABO compatibility to increase chances of receiving CP with NAb.19 If two
different donors were not available, both the units were collected from a single donor. CP was
collected from recovered COVID-19 patients by centrifugal separation using the apheresis
equipment available at the facility after obtaining written informed consent from the donors. At
least 20 mL of the donated plasma was stored at -800C for measurement of SARS-CoV-2 NAb
titres, as reliable and approved qualitative and quantitative tests were not available at the time of
initiation of the study. Commercial qualitative immunoassays for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies on
chemiluminescent immunoassay or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay platforms approved by
the ICMR became available halfway through the trial. Once available, sites were encouraged to
use them before collection of CP.
All enrolled participants underwent clinical examination and a range of laboratory investigations
including arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis, complete blood count, renal and hepatic function
tests, and a coagulation profile on the day of enrolment (Day 0), and subsequently on days 1, 3,
5, 7 and 14. Chest imaging and biomarkers including serum ferritin, Lactate Dehydrogenase
(LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), and D-Dimer were obtained on days 0, 3 and 7. Serum for
antibody titre assays was collected on days 0, 3 and 7; these samples were stored -800C till
further analysis at ICMR-National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, India. SARS-CoV-2 RTPCR from nasopharyngeal swabs was repeated on days 3 and 7. All patients were contacted
telephonically on day 28 to assess their health status.
Micro-neutralization test for SARS-CoV-2 was performed for determining the NAb titres in
stored donor CP and participant serum from day 0, 3 and 7, at the Biosafety Level-3 facility at
ICMR-NIV, Pune following standardized methods.20 Vero CCL-81-adapted SARS-CoV-2 (strain
NIV2020770) isolated at ICMR-NIV, Pune.21 The detection range of NAb titers was 1:20 to

1:1280. Values reported as <1:20 was considered as undetectable NAb titers; values reported as
>1:1280 was considered as 1:1280 for analysis.
Outcomes
The primary outcome of the study was a composite measure of progress to severe disease
(PaO2/FiO2 ratio <100) any time within 28 days of enrolment or all-cause mortality at 28 days.
Primary outcome was considered as “good” if the progress to severe disease or all-cause
mortality could be prevented in the 28 days post enrolment and “poor” if not.
The secondary outcomes were clinical improvement and symptom resolution on day 7; variation
in fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2%) on days 1, 3, 5, 7 and 14; total duration of respiratory
support during hospitalization and post enrolment duration of respiratory support till day 28 or
discharge whichever is earlier; negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA on days 3 and 7;
levels of biomarkers on days 3 and 7 post enrolment compared to baseline; requirement of
vasopressor support; and clinical improvement on WHO ordinal scale on day 0,1,3,5,7,14 and 28
days.22The WHO ordinal scale was not mentioned in the initial study protocol but was added
midway through the trial as it was felt that it will be a key endpoint in any future meta-analysis.
Safety outcomes were frequency of minor and serious adverse event (death and invasive
mechanical ventilation, hemodynamic instability) within 6 hours of CP transfusion. Relatedness
of a serious adverse event with the trial was assessed as per the definitions given by Edwards and
Aronson.23
Statistical Analysis
Assuming that 18% of the intervention arm would meet the composite primary outcome under
the null hypothesis and 9% under the alternative hypothesis, for power of 80% and significance
level of 5%, the sample size was calculated to be 226 in each arm, adding up to 452 participants
for the study. The assumption that 18% of the participants in the BSC arm would meet the
composite primary outcome was based on the best available evidence at the time of designing the
trial.24
Descriptive analysis was done by tabulation of data and presentation of continuous variables as
mean and standard deviation (SD) or median and interquartile range (IQR), as appropriate, and
categorical variables as proportions.
Univariate analysis was done by Chi-squared test to assess the effect of intervention on the
composite primary outcome. To adjust for the difference in BSC by trial sites and clustering of
patients in some sites, a multilevel logistic regression was done with trial sites taken as the
random effect variable along with adjustment for the unequal distribution of diabetes mellitus
between the intervention and control arms. Changes in continuous variables like oxygen
requirement (FiO2), laboratory parameters (biomarker levels, NAb titres) over the period of
hospital stay were compared between both arms by using generalized estimating equations. CRP
and D-Dimer levels were categorized as high when levels were >41.6 mg/L and ≤1 mg/L,
respectively.24,25 To assess viral clearance, the proportion of participants with SARS-CoV-2 viral
RNA negativity was compared between the arms on day 3 and day 7 using the Chi-squared test.

The median score on the WHO Ordinal Scale was plotted for the two trial arms for days 0, 1, 3,
5, 7, and 14.
Post-hoc subgroup analysis was done to compare the composite outcome between participants
who received CP with detectable NAb and control arm. Patients receiving CP with NAb titre
>1:80 were compared with control for the primary outcome. Stratified analysis was done for the
primary outcome between intervention and control arms based on strata such as detectable NAb
at enrolment in participants, and duration of symptoms at enrolment. To assess the effect of
transfusing CP early in the disease, subgroup analysis for the composite outcome was conducted
in participants who had symptoms for less than or equal to 3 days at enrolment.
An intention-to-treat analysis (ITT) was done after imputing the missing composite outcomes as
progression to severe disease or mortality. Data were collected in structured paper case record
forms (CRF) and then entered in the Research Electronic Data Capture system (REDCap,
Version 8.5 Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN). Data analysis was done using STATA v14
(College Station, Texas, USA). An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)
oversaw the study. The trial protocol was registered with the Clinical Trial Registry of India
(CTRI); registration number CTRI/2020/04/024775.
Role of funding source
This multi-centric study was funded by ICMR, an autonomous Government-funded medical
research council. The National Task Force for COVID-19, a committee formed by ICMR to
respond to the pandemic has reviewed and approved this study. The Central Implementation
Team at ICMR was responsible for study design, study coordination, data analysis, data
interpretation and writing of the report. Patient enrolment, data collection and actual conduct of
the study was done at public and private hospitals independently and the investigators in ICMR
had no role in it. The funding source has no financial interest in the investigational product. The
corresponding author at ICMR had access to all the data, is the guarantor for the current work
and holds final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.
Results
A total of 1210 patients admitted across 39 trial sites were screened between 22nd April to 14th
July 2020; 464 patients were randomized into intervention or CP +BSC arm (n=235) and control
or BSC arm (n=229). Outcome at 28 days was not available for 2 patients (one each in
intervention and control arm) who were lost to follow-up after discharge from hospital; 9 patients
(5 in intervention and 4 in control arm) withdrew consent after randomization. All 464 patients
have been included in the intention-to-treat analysis.
Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were similar across the trial arms, except for
prevalence of diabetes mellitus and cough. (Tables 1 and 2) Patient management across the trial
arms was similar except for CP therapy. (Table 2)
CP was collected from 433 donors; CP of 262 donors was finally used for the trial. Most of the
donors were male (94.3%), with mean (SD) age of 34.3 (9.3) years. The median (IQR) disease
duration was 6 (3,11) days and most of the donors (94.2%) had mild disease. Nearly two-thirds
(63.6%) of the donors had a NAb titre of more than 1:20 with a median (IQR) titre of 1:40

(1:30,1:80). Plasma was donated after a median (IQR) of 41 (31,51) days from COVID-19
diagnosis by RT-PCR.
There was no difference in the primary outcome across the trial arms on ITT analysis. Thirtyfour patients (14.5%) died in the intervention arm and 31 (13.5%) in the control arm; adjusted
odds ratio (aOR) was 1.06 [95% CI: 0.61 to 1.83]. Seventeen patients each progressed to severe
disease in both arms [7.2% vs. 7.4%; aOR: 1.04; 95% CI: 0.51 to 2.11]. The composite outcome
was achieved in 44 (18.7%) patients in the intervention arm and 41 (17.9%) in the control arm
[aOR: 1.09; 95% CI: 0.67 to 1.77]. (Table 3)
The proportion of patients with resolution of shortness of breath and fatigue at day 7 were higher
in the intervention arm, whereas fever and cough resolution were not different in the two groups.
(Table 4) The median (IQR) absolute reduction in Fio2% on days 3 [5 (0,12) vs. 3.7 (0,9),
p=0.04], and 5 [9 (3,17) vs. 7 (0,14), p=0.04] from the day of enrolment was significantly more
in the intervention as compared to control arm. At 7 [CP+BSC: 11 (6,18) vs. BSC: 9.5 (6,18),
p=0.48;] and 14 days [CP+BSC: 14 (9,19) vs. BSC: 12 (6,19), p=0.18;] post enrolment, the
change in FiO2% from day of enrolment was similar between the two arms. The negative
conversion of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA at day 7 post-enrollment was significantly higher in the
CP arm compared to the BSC arm. (Table 4)
Total and post-enrollment duration of respiratory support, proportion of patients requiring
invasive ventilation, and proportion of patients requiring vasopressor support were not different
between the trial participants in two arms (Table 4). Among the 38 participants who required
invasive ventilation, only two participants survived till 28 days post enrolment. The average
levels of inflammatory markers over a period of 7 days from enrolment, showed no statistically
significant difference between the two arms [LDH (β =8.9, 95%CI-0.53, 70.9), ferritin (β =30.59,
95%CI -51.36, 112.55). There was no difference in WHO ordinal scale for clinical improvement
between the two arms at any time point of observation.
In the trial participants who received CP, minor adverse events of pain in local infusion site,
chills, nausea, bradycardia and dizziness was reported in one patient each. Fever and tachycardia
were reported in three patients each. Dyspnoea and intravenous catheter blockage were noted in
two participants each. Mortality was assessed as possibly related to CP transfusion in 3 patients
(1.3%).
Stratified analysis was done by symptom duration at enrolment. The composite outcome was not
different between the intervention and control arms for patients with symptom duration less than
or equal to 3 days at enrolment [n=24, aOR: 0.59 (95% CI: 0.28, 1.24)]. Titres of NAb in
transfused CP were available in 224 out of 235 participants in the intervention arm; 160 (71.4%)
participants received at least one unit of CP with detectable NAb. The primary outcome was not
different between the subgroups of intervention arm patients receiving CP with detectable NAb
titres (n=160) or CP with NAb titre ≥1:80 (n=68) or CP with no detectable NAbs (n=64) and the
control arm (Table 3).
NAb titres were measured in 418 trial participants; 348 (83.2%) had detectable NAb at
enrolment. The median (IQR) NAb titre at enrolment was 1:90 (1:30,1:240). In enrolled
participants with detectable NAb at baseline, the CP and control groups were not different in

terms of the composite primary outcome [29 (15.7%) vs. 27 (16.6%), aOR: 1.01 (95%CI:
0.56,1.81)]. In patients with undetectable NAb at baseline (n=70), no difference of composite
primary outcome could be discerned [9 (30%) vs. 10(25%), aOR: 1.75 (95%CI: 0.41,7.51)].
Discussion
The PLACID trial results indicate that there was no difference in 28-day mortality or progression
to severe disease among moderately ill COVID-19 patients treated with CP along with BSC
compared to BSC alone. Additionally, there were no differences in outcomes between study
participants receiving CP with detectable NAb titres compared to BSC alone; or between those
receiving CP with NAb titres more than or equal to 1:80 and those receiving BSC alone. CP
therapy was associated with a higher resolution of symptoms like shortness of breath and fatigue
on day 7. CP use was also associated with reduction in FiO2 requirement on day 3 and 5 but not
in the duration of respiratory support. There was a higher proportion of negative conversion of
viral RNA on day 7 post enrolment in intervention arm. However, it did not demonstrate antiinflammatory properties as we could not detect any difference in the levels of inflammatory
markers such as ferritin, CRP, D-Dimer or LDH between the two arms.
A recent Cochrane review, including 20 studies [1 RCT, 3 controlled non-randomized study of
intervention (NRSI), 16 non-controlled NRSIs], concluded that there is uncertainty regarding
effectiveness of CP in improving mortality or clinical improvement in COVID-19 patients.15 In a
randomized controlled trial conducted from China, Li and colleagues studied 103 patients with
severe and life-threatening COVID-19 and reported no effect on time to clinical improvement.
Their subgroup of 45 patients with severe disease, similar to patients with moderate disease in
our study, demonstrated increased clinical improvement in their CP group.13 The ConCOVID
trial from the Netherlands, prematurely terminated after enrolling 86 patients, could not find any
effect on mortality at 60 days, hospital stay or 15-day disease severity.14 A large observational
study advocated the usefulness of CP in COVID-19, stating that the 7-day and 30-day mortality
were lower in those who received CP within 3 days of symptom onset. However, the absence of
a controlled comparison weakens these findings as evidence of efficacy.26 Although
underpowered, we did not find any benefit of administration of plasma within 3 days of symptom
onset.
Our results mirror the experience of the ConCOVID trial, where 79% of the participants had
detectable antibodies at baseline.14 On the other hand, the NAb titres in CP in our study was
similar to the results by Long et al, who found 13-40% patients turned seronegative in the early
convalescent phase.27 In a 175-patient series, Wu et al documented that 30% of patients
generated very low levels of NAb with titres correlating to increasing age and disease severity.20
We found participants had higher antibody positivity and median NAb titres than CP donors. The
difference in age and severity of illness, with donors being younger and having milder disease,
could have driven this difference. While all COVID-19 survivors were encouraged to donate
plasma, an overwhelming majority of the donors were only mildly sick, young survivors.
Recovered patients who had moderate or severe disease were generally reluctant to return to
hospitals for plasma donation. This has major implications for obvious operational reasons as CP
therapy for COVID-19 gets scaled up as a component of COVID-19 management strategy not
only in India but also globally.

There was no difference in NAb titres in the two arms despite CP transfusion. This suggests that
there may not be any benefit of CP collected from young mild COVID -19 recovered donors to
moderate to severely sick elderly patients who have a robust antibody response.
The early conversion of viral RNA negativity in intervention arm aligns with published evidence,
and further supports the fundamental hypothesis that CP exerts virus neutralization effects.11,13
However, the goal of getting better clinical outcomes remained elusive for us. We did not find
evidence to support the immunomodulator functions of CP as we could not demonstrate
differences in the levels of inflammatory markers. This could potentially explain why CP had no
difference in primary outcome despite early SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA negativity.
CP transfusion was deemed to be safe in our study; minimal non-life-threatening adverse events
were reported. Three deaths could possibly be related to CP transfusion, which is comparable to
the other larger reports of safety of CP use in COVID-19.12 Possible is defined here as a clinical
event which occurred within 6 hours of CP transfusion, but could also be explained by worsening
COVID-19.23
The PLACID trial was conducted to generate context-specific evidence relevant to all
stakeholders, including policymakers, healthcare providers, and patients. To achieve this,
expression of interest was invited from hospitals across the country and not limited to a few
centres of excellence. Hospitals were chosen both from the public and private sectors, lending
heterogeneity in infrastructure, and wide socio-cultural-economic representation of study
participants, with a large range of co-morbidities and presenting features. The BSC represented
the care standards likely to be provided in a real-world setting. While this approach could have
impacted the internal comparability across sites, we feel this lends the trial more generalizability,
approximates real-world scenarios more closely and places our study closer to the pragmatic
trials across the methodological spectrum of clinical trials.28
The PLACID trial has several limitations. Being an open-labelled study, it was susceptible to
anchoring bias in treating physicians in outcome ascertainment. This may be reflected in the
higher resolution of subjective symptoms like shortness of breath and fatigue noted in
intervention arm. The trial was conducted in 39 hospitals across the country with some level of
heterogeneity across the trial sites in terms of BSC and participant enrolment. The biomarker
assays for ferritin, LDH, CRP and D-dimer were conducted with products from different
manufacturers. Also, as the pandemic was in different stages across the country, the enrolment
strength varied from site to site with a possibility of selection bias arising due to clustering of
enrolment. We attempted to alleviate this bias by statistically adjusting the primary outcome for
trial sites. Further, the discharge criteria for COVID-19 was based on government guidelines and
not on clinician discretion and patient condition, hence we chose not to analyse this as a
secondary outcome. We could not measure the antibody titres in CP before transfusion, since
validated, reliable, commercial tests for qualitative or quantitative antibody measurement were
not available at the time of commencement of this trial. However, this remains a close
approximation of the manner in which CP therapy has largely been deployed in regions with
limited laboratory capacity.
Use of CP as a treatment modality for COVID-19 has received authorisation for off-label use in
India.29 This authorization has been paralleled by questionable practices such as calls for donors

on social media, and the sale of CP on the black market with exorbitant price tags in India.30
Additionally, although CP is a safe therapeutic modality, plasmapheresis, plasma storage and
NAb measurement are all resource-intensive processes, with limited number of institutes in the
country having the capacity to undertake these activities in a quality-assured manner.
Although the use of CP seemed to improve resolution of shortness of breath and fatigue, reduce
FiO2 requirement in the first week and led to higher negative conversion of viral RNA, this did
not translate into reduction in 28-day mortality or progression to severe disease in moderate
COVID-19 patients. Areas of future research could include effectiveness of CP among NAb
naïve patients and the use of CP with high NAb titres.

What is already known on this topic
Till date, multiple small case-series, one large observational study with over 35,000
patients, and two randomized clinical trials have been published on the utility of
convalescent plasma in management of COVID-19. Whilst the observational studies
suggested clinical benefits in recipients of convalescent plasma, the trials were stopped
early, and they failed to ascertain any mortality benefit associated with convalescent plasma
therapy in COVID-19 patients.
What this study adds
In settings with limited laboratory capacity, convalescent plasma does not reduce 28-day
mortality or progression to severe disease in moderately ill, hospitalized COVID-19
patients. It was associated with resolution of shortness of breath fatigue on day 7, reduction
in supplemental oxygen requirement on day 3 and 5 and early negative conversion of
SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA. The effectiveness of convalescent plasma as a potential
therapeutic modality for moderately ill COVID-19 patients is limited.
