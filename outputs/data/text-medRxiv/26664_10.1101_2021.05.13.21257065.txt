Abstract
Background. Evidence has shown that a large proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals
do not experience symptomatic disease. Owing to its critical role in immune response, we
hypothesized that variation in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) loci may underly
asymptomatic infection.
Methods. We enrolled 29,947 individuals registered in the National Marrow Donor Program for
whom high-resolution HLA genotyping data were available in a smartphone-based study
designed to track COVID-19 symptoms and outcomes. Among 21,893 individuals who
completed the baseline survey, our discovery (N=640) and replication (N=788) cohorts were
comprised of self-identified White subjects who reported a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2.
We tested for association of five HLA loci (HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, -DQB1) with asymptomatic vs.
symptomatic infection.
Results. HLA-B*15:01 was significantly increased in asymptomatic individuals in the discovery
cohort compared to symptomatic (OR = 2.45; 95%CI 1.38-4.24, p = 0.0016, pcorr = 0.048), and
we reproduced this association in the replication cohort (OR= 2.32; 95%CI = 1.10-4.43, p =

0.017). We found robust association of HLA-B*15:01 in the combined dataset (OR=2.40 95% CI
= 1.54-3.64; p = 5.67 x10-5) and observed that homozygosity of this allele increases more than
eight times the chance of remaining asymptomatic after SARS-CoV-2 infection (OR = 8.58,
95%CI = 1.74-34.43, p = 0.003). Finally, we demonstrated the association of HLA-B*15:01 with
asymptomatic SARS-Cov-2 infection is enhanced by the presence of HLA-DRB1*04:01
Conclusion. HLA-B*15:01 is strongly associated with asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2
and is likely to be involved in the mechanism underlying early viral clearance.

Introduction
Despite some inconsistent reporting of symptoms,1 studies have demonstrated that at least 20%
of individuals infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) will
remain asymptomatic. 2-4. Although global efforts have focused on understanding factors
underlying severe illness in COVID-19 (coronavirus disease of 2019), the examination of
asymptomatic infection provides a unique opportunity to consider early disease and
immunologic features promoting rapid viral clearance. Specific focus on asymptomatic infection
has the potential to further our understanding of disease pathogenesis and supports ongoing
efforts toward vaccine development and the discovery of potential therapeutic targets.
It remains unclear why many individuals successfully clear infection without major complications
while others develop severe disease, even in the absence of known risk factors for severe
COVID-19 outcomes.5 However, host genetics is long-known to be implicated in differential
immunological responses to infection and disease progression.6 Numerous studies intending to
understand the genetic basis of differential outcomes in COVID-19 have been underway since
nearly the start of the global pandemic, including the multicenter Host Genetics Initiative7.
However, the vast majority of these studies have examined genetic associations with severe
disease course, in primarily hospitalized cohorts.8-10 As a result, although most individuals
infected with SARS-Cov-2 experience mild disease course or are entirely asymptomatic, very
few studies have examined genetics in the context of non-hospitalized, prospective, communitybased cohorts.
The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region, located on chromosome 6p21, is the most
polymorphic and medically important region of the human genome. Variation in HLA has been
associated with hundreds of diseases and conditions, including infection. Infectious diseases
are one of the leading causes of human mortality11 and are a primary selective pressure

shaping the human genome. 12,13 Among the myriad genes involved in human immune
responses, HLA variants are among the strongest reported associations with viral infections. For
example, HLA was strongly associated with the rapid progression and viral load control of HIV
(human immunodeficiency virus) 14, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and other infectious diseases.15
Notably, HLA class I and class II alleles have also been associated with the severe acute
respiratory syndrome caused by SARS-CoV.16-21
A series of in silico analyses have pointed to HLA as relevant molecules for SARS-CoV-2 risk
and essential targets for vaccine development.22-25 For example, HLA-B*46:01 has low predicted
binding of peptides for SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that individuals expressing this molecule may
be more vulnerable to COVID-19,24 which corroborates previous results showing HLA-B*46:01
association with SARS risk.18 In contrast, HLA-B*15:03 was predicted to protect against COVID19 with the greatest ability to present highly conserved SARS-CoV-2 peptides to T cells.24 More
recently, it was demonstrated that while there is some overlap, many SARS-CoV-2 epitopes for
CD8 T cells are HLA specific.24 To date, very few studies have directly examined HLA
associations with infection, with mixed and inconclusive results in relatively small cohorts.26-28.
Larger studies that relied on genome-wide data to impute HLA failed to find robust associations
with disease8,29; however, these studies focused primarily on hospitalized patients with severe
disease course.
Because of its pivotal role in the immune response, understanding the impact of HLA variation
in disease promises to provide meaningful insights relevant to understanding the
immunopathogenesis of COVID-19, while informing vaccine development and potential
immunotherapies. Here, we present the largest study to-date directly examining HLA variation in
the context of primarily mild disease. We invited volunteer bone marrow donors for whom highresolution HLA genotyping data were already available to participate in the COVID-19 Citizen
Science Study, a smartphone-based study designed to track COVID-19 symptoms and

outcomes, including self-reported positive tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection, to develop a
prospective cohort currently numbering nearly 30,000 individuals. Our early results provide
strong support for the role of HLA class I in viral clearance leading to asymptomatic infection
among persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection and provide an important framework for additional
studies aimed at revealing the immunological and genetic basis for recovery from SARS-CoV-2
infection.

Methods
Data collection
This study was conducted in accordance with the ethical standards of the UCSF Human
Research Protection Program Institutional Review under approval #20-30850 and informed
consent was obtained from all individual participants involved in the study. Subjects were
volunteer bone marrow donors with valid email addresses on file with the National Marrow
Donor Program (NMDP) who were invited to participate in the study through an email outreach
campaign that began in July 2020. All subjects have within the NMDP database a pre-existing
record for high-resolution HLA genotyping, typically for five loci (HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, and DQB1).30 Participants who opt in to the study are required to download a smartphone app and
participate in the COVID-19 Citizen Science Study (launched using the Eureka Digital Research
Platform, https://eureka.app.link/covid19) or, as of January 2021, participate via website
(https://covid19.eurekaplatform.org/) . Once enrolled, participants are asked to complete an
initial 10- to 15-minute survey about baseline demographics, their health history and daily
habits. Follow-up daily questions specific to symptoms, weekly questions regarding testing and
monthly questions regarding hospitalization for COVID-19, are delivered by push notification or
text message on an ongoing basis and require five to 15 minutes per week. As of April 30, 2021,
we enrolled 29,947, of whom 21,893 have completed their baseline survey.

Figure 1. Study inclusion criteria
Within the mobile application, survey respondents are asked during their initial baseline survey
whether they have ever been tested for active infection and report the result (positive, negative,
do not know) and the approximate number of weeks since the test. Thereafter, each week
respondents are asked whether they were tested in the prior week, and to report the result. We
considered anybody reporting a positive test for active infection as having been infected with
SARS-CoV-2. Our discovery cohort consisted of individuals reporting a positive test for virus at
baseline at the point that we had collected baseline data for the first 15,000 respondents; we
achieved this threshold on January 10, 2021. Respondents reporting a positive test for the virus
after baseline (i.e., on a weekly survey) or who completed their baseline survey after January

10, 2021, together formed our replication cohort. We restricted the analysis to individuals who
had self-identified as “White” only due to insufficient numbers for analysis in other groups,
allowing analysis of 640 individuals in our discovery cohort and 788 individuals in our replication
cohort. Inclusion criteria are detailed in Figure 1.
Symptoms are self-reported at baseline and using the daily surveys. Within the baseline survey,
respondents are asked to report whether they had any of a list of symptoms (Table S1) for three
days or longer at any time since February of 2020. These same symptoms are queried in each
daily survey, where respondents are asked whether they experienced each symptom within the
previous 24 hours. Among those individuals, we considered those who reported having had a
positive test for active virus at baseline, with a time since the test of longer than two weeks or
who did not specify test dates, and who reported “None of the above” for all symptoms in the
baseline survey, as “asymptomatic.” We also considered daily symptom reports for the two
weeks after baseline for respondents who reported a positive test for active infection at baseline
as having occurred within the prior two weeks. In these cases, we considered individuals
asymptomatic if in addition to reporting no symptoms at baseline, they did not report any single
symptom two or more times within this time period. For individuals who did not report a positive
test for active infection at baseline, but subsequently reported a positive test on a weekly
survey, we used the same criteria considering daily symptom reports for the period two weeks
prior and two weeks after the positive test report.
HLA association analysis
We examined the association of five HLA loci (HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, -DQB1) with
asymptomatic vs. symptomatic infection. Initial testing for HLA associations was performed
using the R package BIGDAWG31, which handles multiallelic HLA data to test for association at
the haplotype, locus, allele, and amino acid levels. We employed a generalized linear model

using ‘glm’ in the R base package to consider relevant covariates, including any reported
comorbidities, sex, and age, for alleles initially found to be associated with asymptomatic
infection after correction for multiple testing. We corrected p-values using the Bonferroni
method32 for the number of alleles tested at HLA-A, -B, and -DRB1, which allows for the strong
linkage disequilibrium between some loci tested.

Results
Study population characteristics
Our study population was overwhelmingly comprised of individuals with mild disease, with only
two individuals reporting hospitalization for COVID-19. The discovery cohort consisted of 640
individuals who reported a positive test for active SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline and selfidentified as White. Among these respondents, 90 (14.1%) reported having remained
asymptomatic for at least two weeks after a positive test for virus. Among the 788 individuals
who reported a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2 active infection and self-reported as White
who comprised our replication cohort, 46 (5.8%) were asymptomatic according to our study
criteria.
Median age was increased (p < 0.001) in asymptomatic compared to symptomatic individuals in
each cohort (discovery asymptomatic=44, symptomatic=37; replication asymptomatic =38,
symptomatic=31). Likewise, median age in our discovery cohort overall (38) was higher than our
replication cohort (31; p<0.001). Finally, while not statistically significant, there was a trend
toward increased asymptomatic infection in males (p=0.07) in our discovery cohort. Basic
demographics for all subjects are given in Table 1.
We also collected data on several diseases and conditions that might impact COVID-19 disease
course. Among all individuals who reported a positive test for virus across both cohorts
(N=1,428), 67% reported no known COVID-19-associated comorbidities. We did not observe a
significant difference in any reported comorbidity between the discovery and replication cohorts.
The full list of reported diseases and conditions is given Table S2

HLA-B*15:01 is associated with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection
We aimed to identify whether HLA variation impacts the likelihood that an individual will remain
asymptomatic after SARS-CoV-2 infection. We analyzed high-resolution genotyping for five
highly polymorphic HLA class I and class II genes (HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-DRB1, HLADQB1) in each study cohort. Data analysis included the first two fields of the allele name as
described in the HLA nomenclature, representing the complete molecule at polypeptide
sequence resolution.
In the discovery cohort, we found the allele HLA-B*15:01 significantly overrepresented in
asymptomatic individuals relative to symptomatic individuals (f=0.11 vs. 0.047; OR=2.52; 95%CI
1.39-4.42, p = 0.00057, pcorr = 0.017, Table 2). No other HLA allele at any locus was found to be
significantly associated after correction for multiple comparisons. Allelic frequencies for all loci
are given in Tables S3-S7.

To adjust for the effect of comorbid conditions, as well as sex and age differences in
asymptomatic vs. symptomatic patients, we fitted a series of regression models but did not find
any impact of patient-reported comorbidities on the likelihood of asymptomatic disease. Thus,
our final model adjusted only for age and sex, which again showed a significant association of
HLA-B*15:01 with asymptomatic infection after adjustment for these variables (OR = 2.45;
95%CI 1.38-4.24, p = 0.0016, pcorr = 0.048, Table 2).
We reproduced the association of HLA-B*15:01 with asymptomatic infection (Table 2, sex and
age adjusted) in the replication cohort and found a remarkably consistent effect size for this
allele (OR= 2.32; 95%CI = 1.10-4.43, p = 0.017). Given the consistency between the
discovery and replication cohort observations, we examined the combined dataset for an overall
association of HLA-B*15:01 with asymptomatic infection (OR=2.40 95% CI = 1.54-3.64; p = 5.67
x10-5). Finally, we observed a strong additive effect for the associated genotype in the combined

dataset. Individuals who carry two copies of HLA-B*15:01 are more than eight times more likely
to remain asymptomatic than individuals carrying other genotypes (OR = 8.58, 95%CI = 1.7434.43, p = 0.003). Overall, one in five individuals (20%) who remained asymptomatic after
infection carried HLA-B*15:01, compared to 9% among patients reporting symptoms.
HLA-B*15:01 association with asymptomatic SARS-Cov-2 infection is enhanced by the
presence of HLA-DRB1*04:01
To understand whether additional HLA alleles might interact with HLA-B*15:01 in asymptomatic
infection, we tested all pairwise two-locus haplotypes containing HLA-B in the combined
dataset. Overall, haplotypic associations for HLA-B~HLA-DRB1 and HLA-A~HLA-B were found
to be significant at p=0.01. Examining specific allelic haplotypes, these associations were
driven by two HLA-B*15:01 haplotypes: HLA-B*15:01~HLA-DRB1*04:01, and HLAA*02:01~HLA-B*15:01 (Tables S8-9).
After adjusting for sex and age, only the combination of HLA-B*15:01 and HLA-DRB1*04:01
remained significant after correction for multiple comparisons (p = 3 x 10-4, pcorr = 0.01). We
found an odds ratio for this combination (OR=3.17, 95% CI=1.65-5.80) that exceeds that for
HLA-B*15:01 alone, suggesting that while not significantly associated with the asymptomatic
infection on its own, the class II allele HLA-DRB1*04:01 enhances the effect of HLA-B*15:01.

Discussion

Leveraging big data and mobile technology in this crowd-sourced study, we reveal important
insight into the immunogenetic underpinnings of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our
innovative use of a mobile application and a pre-existing database for medical research allowed
us to screen nearly 30,000 individuals previously genotyped for HLA for viral infection and
disease course.
Among participants reporting a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2, HLA-B*15:01 is significantly
associated with asymptomatic infection. We observed that individuals carrying this relatively
common allele are more than twice as likely to remain asymptomatic after SARS-CoV-2
infection than those who do not, and an astonishing effect for HLA-B*15:01 homozygosity
increasing more than eight times the chance of remaining asymptomatic. This observation
suggests important features of early infection with SARS-CoV-2.
Although our data do not point to a direct mechanism, compelling evidence indicates that
B*1501 is predicted to bind a specific SARS-CoV-2 epitope, WTAGAAAYY, with high affinity.3338

This epitope has been considered a natural candidate for SARS-Cov-2 vaccine studies39,40 as

it is considered to be highly immunogenic and predicted to elicit a strong CD8+ T cell
responses.41-44 The dominant recognition and consequent eliciting of immune responses by only
a relatively small number of epitopes– immunodominance – is determined by multiple factors,
including the binding affinity of the peptide for the HLA molecule.45 We speculate that the high
affinity of HLA-B*15:01 for binding WTAGAAAYY or another unknown viral peptide confers
strong CD8+ T cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, leading to better early viral
control and thus resulting in asymptomatic course of infection. The epitope WTAGAAAYY is
also conserved among other seasonal coronaviruses in humans.38 An alternative explanation for
our results is that HLA-B*15:01 carriers previously infected by other common coronaviruses

have pre-existing cross-reactive T-cells with high affinity for a specific epitope conferred by this
HLA molecule. While the current literature is mixed regarding cross-reactive CD8+ T cells
specific to SARS-CoV-2, this might be explained by HLA specificity. 46,47. The fact that
asymptomatic individuals in our study were less likely than symptomatic subjects to report a
positive test for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (Table S10) suggests a strong early anti-viral
response and may corroborate the critical role of CD8+ T cytotoxicity mediated by HLA class I in
eliminating SARS-CoV-2 infected cells.
A study from England has recently reported a suggestive association of HLA-DRB1*04:01 with
asymptomatic infection.27 While our results did not corroborate this association for HLADRB1*04:01 alone, we did find that this allele enhanced the effect of HLA-B*15:01 when the
pair were in combination. We note that this is the HLA-DRB1 allele most commonly associated
with HLA-B*15:01 in individuals in the U.S. who self-identify as White, and thus it is difficult to
differentiate a real effect from one related to linkage disequilibrium between these loci. We
speculate that the study by Langton et al.27 may have been detecting the same HLA-B*15:01
association observed here, but due to the high number of alleles commonly observed at HLA-B,
that study may have been insufficiently powered to detect the association.
A key limitation of this study is that all testing results and symptoms are self-reported. We
recognize that this may result in some margin of error in our results. However, we have
previously validated this approach by verifying test results in a subset of the participants.48
Additionally, we note that we find a remarkably consistent genetic association across the study,
pointing to a true biological feature.
Likewise, some key differences were observed between the discovery and replication phase of
our study. For example, differences in SARS-CoV-2 positivity results between the first (5%) and
second (17%) stages may be explained by the overall trajectory of the pandemic in the United

States. The discovery cohort primarily comprises individuals enrolled relatively early in the
pandemic, while the replication cohort enrolled at the height of the winter surge. Likewise, the
lower rate of asymptomatic infection in the replication cohort (5.8% vs 14.1% in discovery) may
be attributed to many factors related to change over time in the pandemic; such as, the
prevalence of more virulent viral variants or shifts in public utilization of testing. We also
observed significantly older age in asymptomatic individuals compared to those who developed
symptomatic infection. This difference may be at least in part explained by subjects’ selfreported reasons for seeking testing for the virus. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the most common
reason patients reporting symptomatic infection sought testing was because they experienced
symptoms consistent with COVID-19. In contrast, asymptomatic subjects often were tested for
the virus in conjunction with their employment status, such as healthcare workers, who may
skew older in our study population. While we cannot rule out a biological basis for the age
association with asymptomatic infection, we feel that some ascertainment bias may also explain
this observation. Regardless, our observations with respect to HLA remain highly significant
upon adjusting for age.
In summary, we have demonstrated a strong and significant association of a common HLA
class I allele, HLA-B*15:01, with asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2. Our results have
important implications for understanding early infection and the mechanism underlying early
viral clearance and may lay the groundwork for refinement of vaccine development and
therapeutic options in early disease.
