Abstract
Background: Countermeasures against COVID-19 outbreak such as lockdown and
voluntary restrictions against going out adversely affect human stress and economic
activity. Particularly, this stress might lead to suicide.
Object: We examined excess mortality attributable to suicide caused by COVID-19.
Method: We applied the NIID model to suicide deaths from October 2009 through
November, 2020 for the whole of Japan for both genders. Effects of the great
earthquake that struck in eastern Japan on March 11, 2011 were incorporated into the
estimation model.
Results: Significant excess mortality in suicide was found between July and November
in 2020 for both genders. It was greater among females than among males. In total,
1599 excess cases of mortality were identified.
Discussion and Conclusion: Excess mortality during the four months was more than two
times greater than the number of COVID-19 deaths confirmed by PCR testing.
Countermeasures against COVID-19 should be chosen carefully in light of suicide
effects.

1. Introduction
Since the emergence of COVID-19, excess mortality from all causes has been low
in Japan [1]. Actually, data obtained throughout Japan show 12 and 104 cases of excess
mortality in August and October, 2020. These very few cases of excess mortality in
Japan might be attributable to the lower number of traffic accidents from voluntary
restrictions against going out.
However, countermeasures against COVID-19 outbreak such as lockdowns or
voluntary restrictions against going out can cause stress and can suppress economic
activity. Countermeasures might lower incomes or cause job loss. Such economic stress
might lead to suicide [2]. Such difficulties should be counted as part of the costs for
countermeasures. Therefore, the present study examined excess mortality attributable to
suicide caused by COVID-19.

2. Method
The estimation procedure was almost identical to that used for an earlier study [1],
except for some points. Excess mortality was defined as the difference between the
actual number of deaths and an epidemiological threshold if the actual number of deaths
exceeded an epidemiological threshold. The epidemiological threshold is defined as the
upper bound of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the baseline. The baseline is defined
as the number of deaths that are likely to have occurred if an influenza outbreak had not
occurred. Therefore, if the actual deaths were fewer than the epidemiological threshold,
then excess mortality was not inferred. Additionally, we defined negative excess

mortality as the difference between the actual number of deaths and the lower bound of
95% CI if the actual deaths were fewer than the lower bound of 95% CI.
Data used for this study were those of monthly deaths from all causes, as reported
from 2005 through November 2020 [3]. The NIID model, the Stochastic Frontier
Estimation [4–10], is presented as

log Dt=α+βTt+γTt2+θVt+λVtTt+φCt+ξCtTt+ΣηiMit+εt

(1)

and

εt=νt+|ωt| ,

(2)

where Dt represents suicide deaths in month/year t, Tt denotes the linear time trend, Vt is
a dummy variable for routine pneumococcal vaccination, Ct is a dummy variable for
effect of the great earthquake in eastern Japan in March, 2011, and Mit is a dummy
variable for the month. Also, Vt takes a value of one after October, 2014; otherwise, it is
zero. Similarly, Ct takes a value of one in May, June, or July in 2011; otherwise, it is
zero. Mit is one if t is the i-th month; otherwise, it is zero. Moreover, νt and ωt are
stochastic variables as νt ~N(0, μ2) and ωt ~N(0,ξ2); they are mutually independent.
Although νt represents stochastic disturbances, ωt denotes non-negative deaths

attributable to influenza. These disturbance terms in this model are parameterized by
two parameters: ξ/μ and (μ2+ξ2)0.5. If the null hypothesis ξ/μ=0 is not rejected, then the
Stochastic Frontier Estimation model is inappropriate.
The study area encompassed the entire nation of Japan. The study period for
estimation was October 2009 through November 2020 because of data availability.
Suicide is defined as X60-X84 in ICD10. We adopted 5% as the level at which
significance was inferred for results.

3. Results
Figure 1 presents observed suicide deaths, the estimated baseline, and its threshold
for males. Figure 2 shows corresponding data for females. These figures showed that
males are more numerous than females, but consistently decline is noted in the period
for both genders. The sharpest spike occurred around May 2011, probably because of
the great earthquake that struck eastern Japan on March 11, 2011. More than two
months passed after the event before suicide increased. The second sharpest increase
occurred probably in the latest period.
Because the estimated coefficients of the cross-term of routine vaccination
initiation and time trend, earthquake dummy, and the cross-term of ICD10 revision and
time trend were not found to be significant, we dropped these terms from the estimation
equation (1). Table 1 presents estimation results without these variables. The estimated
coefficients of the great earthquake in eastern Japan were 0.133 for males and 0.247 for

females. That result implies that the numbers of suicide deaths jumped respectively by
13% and 25% because of the earthquake. It is noteworthy that the effect on females was
greater than on males, although the incidence of suicide death was much greater among
males than among females.
Figure 3 presents excess mortality attributable to suicide in 2019 and 2020. Among
females, clearly large excess mortality was found in the last five months. Among males,
these were not greater than among females until October, 2020, but excess mortality in
male was larger than female in November, 2020. In the five months, total excess
mortality attributable to suicide was 1823.

4. Discussion
This study applied the NIID model to suicide deaths to detect excess mortality
attributable to COVID-19. Results showed that significant excess mortality attributable
to suicide was found between July and November 2020, especially in October. It was
estimated as 1599 for both genders. Especially, suicide in females was extremely high
in October. However, in November, excess mortality in suicide decreased. It might be
affected by activation of “Go To Travel Campaign” on July 22 which subsidized travel
and issuing coupons for shopping at tourist destinations which aims to enforce
sightseeing business.
As described earlier, some excess mortality in all causes was found for August and
October, 2020, respectively, as 12 and 104 cases. At least 12 cases of excess mortality

among all causes in August might result from 304 cases of excess mortality attributable
to suicide. At the same time, pneumonia deaths were recorded respectively as 178, 314,
and 75 cases of negative excess mortality, in May, June, and July. Those figures were
measured as the gap separating the observation and lower bound of 95% CI for baseline
if the former was lower than the latter in May, June, and July [11]. In August, negative
excess mortality attributable to pneumonia was not found, although the observation was
below the baseline. Therefore, excess mortality attributable to suicide was cancelled out
partially by negative excess mortality attributable to pneumonia. Therefore, no excess
mortality was found for all causes of death. However, in August, negative excess
mortality attributable to pneumonia was less than before. Therefore, excess mortality in
suicide led to overall excess mortality for all causes, even though it was a very small
number. In this sense, excess mortality attributable to suicide might be large in October,
although data were not available because excess mortality from all causes was reported
as a larger number than in August.
Throughout Japan, about 776 cases of mortality attributable to COVID-19 between
July and October 2020, as confirmed by PCR testing, were reported to the Ministry of
Health, Labour, and Welfare (MHLW) officially [1]. Therefore, excess mortality caused
by suicide was more than two times greater than that reported for COVID-19 death.

Pneumonia deaths sometimes lead to negative excess mortality. Therefore, the target of
countermeasures for COVID-19 should reduce excess mortality attributable to suicide,
at least in Japan. In other words, economic activity should be less restricted if there are
fewer infection opportunities.
Some researchers in Japan have emphasized considerable excess mortality from all
causes of death through October of around 19 thousand at maximum due to COVID-19
[12] when using the Farrington algorithm [13] and EuroMOMO [14] , which was 11
times larger than the number of death confirmed by PCR test. This study measured
excess mortality as the gap separating observations and baseline, not a threshold, as in
prefectures where observations were higher than the threshold Therefore, their
estimated too huge excess mortality might seriously mislead people into adopting
greater risks of infection by COVID-19 among the general population.
The present study has some limitations. First, our results reflect data obtained
through September, 2020 when the COVID-19 outbreak was not so widespread.
Subsequently, and especially in winter, a severer COVID-19 outbreak occurred. The
second state of emergency was declared on January 7, 2021. It required shortened
business hours for restaurants. In the first state of emergency declaration in April and
May, 2020, restaurants were required to shut down. Even though requirements of the

second state of emergency were milder than the first, it might have increased suicide
deaths several months after. Continuous monitoring is expected to be necessary.
Second, to ascertain the most appropriate countermeasures for COVID-19 in Japan,
cost-effectiveness analysis is necessary. At that time, loss of quality of life in should be
counted among the costs of restriction of economic activity as a major part of
countermeasures. It remains as a subject for our next research challenge.

5. Conclusion
The obtained results show excess mortality in suicide between July and October,
2020. Especially, suicide in female in October, 2020 was remarkable Continued careful
monitoring of excess mortality attributable to suicide is expected to be necessary for
evaluating countermeasures taken for the second state of emergency declaration.
The present study is based on the authors’ opinions: it does not reflect any stance or
policy of their professionally affiliated bodies.
