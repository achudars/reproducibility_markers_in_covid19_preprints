Abstract

27

Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is an emerging concern regarding the potential

28

adverse effects during pregnancy. This study reviews knowledge on the impact of

29

COVID-19 on pregnancy and describes the outcome of published cases of pregnant

30

women diagnosed with COVID-19.

31

Methods: Searches were conducted in PubMed® up to 8 April 2020, using PRISMA

32

standards, to identify original published studies describing pregnant women at any

33

gestational age diagnosed COVID-19. There were no date or language restrictions on the

34

search. All identified studies were included irrespective of assumptions on study quality.

35

Results: We identified 30 original studies reporting 212 cases of pregnant women with

36

COVID-19 (30 discharged while pregnant), 200 from China and 12 from other countries.

37

The 182 published deliveries resulted in one stillbirth and 185 live births. Four women

38

with severe COVID-19 required admission to an intensive care unit but no cases of

39

maternal death were reported. There was one neonatal death. Preterm births occurred in

40

28.7% of cases, but it is unclear whether this was iatrogenic. All cases with amniotic fluid,

41

placenta, and/or cord blood analyzed for the SARS-CoV-2 virus were negative. Four

42

newborns were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and three newborns had high levels of IgM

43

antibodies. Breast milk samples from 13 mothers and described in seven studies showed

44

no evidence of SARS-CoV-2.

45

Conclusion: The evidence related to the effect of COVID-19 on pregnant women is still

46

limited. Pregnant women and newborns should be considered particularly vulnerable

47

populations regarding COVID-19 prevention and management strategies.

Introduction

52

The disease resulting from infection with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome

53

Coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) and designated COVID-19 by the World Health

54

Organization (WHO) was first identified in humans in December 2019, in the city of

55

Wuhan, China,1 and can present from asymptomatic to a severe acute respiratory infection

56

requiring intensive care.2,

57

proportionally uncommon in children (<1% of the total cases). The infection fatality rate

58

is around 1% but much higher in older people or those with pre-existing medical

59

conditions (such as heart disease, diabetes, COPD).2, 4

60

Person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 is well established and can occur when an

61

infected person coughs, sneezes or speaks and scattered droplets are inhaled or reach the

62

mucous membranes of the mouth, nose or eyes of susceptible. COVID-19 can also be

63

transmitted through direct hand contact with surfaces or objects contaminated with

64

SARS-CoV-2 followed by contact with the mouth, nose or eyes.2

65

Pregnant women and newborns receive special attention and there is an emerging concern

66

with the potential risk of SARS-COV-2 vertical transmission (from mother to fetus) or

67

associated malformations, and contagion during delivery and breastfeeding; likewise, it

68

is important to determine the potential adverse effects of COVID-19 in pregnant women.5-

This study reviews published cases of pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19.

We searched PubMed® up to 8 April 2020 to identify original published studies

76

describing pregnant women at any gestational age diagnosed with COVID-19 (confirmed

77

by clinical/radiological evidence of pneumonia compatible with SARS-CoV-2 and/or by

78

quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or dual fluorescence PCR of

79

SARS-CoV-2 infection). The following search expression was used [(COVID-19 OR

80

2019-nCoV OR "novel coronavirus" OR SARS-CoV-2 OR “coronavirus 2”) AND

81

(pregnancy OR delivery OR pregnant OR obstetric* OR maternal OR perinatal OR

82

breastfeeding)]. Also, reference tracking was carried out to identify other potential studies

83

to be included.

84

Each reference retrieved was screened independently by two researchers (IB and RD)

85

following predefined criteria to determine eligibility for the systematic review. Studies

86

were excluded if: (1) did not involve humans (e.g. in vitro or animal research); (2) non-

87

original articles (e.g. book chapters, review articles, editorials, comments, guidelines); (3)

88

data not reporting pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19; and (4) duplicate studies

89

or evaluating the same sample. There were no date or language restrictions on the search.

90

Two researchers (IB and RD) reviewed the included studies and extracted the following

91

data: collection period, maternal age, pregnancy complications, type of delivery,

92

indication for cesarean section, gestational age at birth (or at admission), pregnancy

93

outcome, maternal admission to intensive care unit, maternal death, neonatal outcomes

94

(birth weight, Apgar at 1 and 5 minutes, neonatal complications, breastfeeding),

95

intrauterine and/or neonatal samples collected for detection of SARS-CoV-2 (such as

96

amniotic fluid, cord blood, placenta, breast milk, nasopharyngeal and anal swabs) and

97

their results (negative/positive).

98

All identified original studies reporting cases of pregnant women at any gestational age

99

diagnosed with COVID-19 were included irrespective of study quality. Cases reported in

more than one study, and for which it was possible to identify duplicates, were described

101

only once, presenting the more detailed data. We identified duplicates based on author

102

names and hospital location, publication date, participant admission date, maternal and

103

neonatal characteristics and outcomes.

104

Doubts on possible duplicates and/or differences in the data extraction were discussed

105

and resolved by consensus, involving a third researcher (CR) whenever necessary.

Table 1 summarizes the main characteristics of the 212 reported cases of pregnant women

114

diagnosed with COVID-19 and identified in 30 original studies published until April 8,

115

2020. A detailed description of each reported case is presented in Table S1 (supplemental

116

material).

117

All published cases occurred in China, except eight from the United States of America,11,

118

12

119

Sweden.16 Maternal age ranged from 22 to 41 years. From the 212 pregnant women

120

described, 182 delivered and 30 were discharged during pregnancy (undelivered). Most

121

women were in the third trimester of pregnancy and there was only one study reporting

or throat, sample collection varying from immediately to 9 days after birth. Two studies

130

also used maternal and neonatal sera samples to test for IgG and IgM antibodies.27, 28

131

Four newborns (2.2%) presented positive oral swabs for SARS-CoV-2.21, 24, 25, 29 In a

132

cohort of 33 newborns from mothers with COVID-19, admitted to the Pediatric Hospital

133

of Wuhan, three of the newborns had positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 in

134

nasopharyngeal and anal swabs collected on the second and fourth days after delivery,

135

with negative results on the sixth day for two newborns and on the seventh day for

136

another. However, placenta, amniotic fluid, and cord blood samples were not analyzed.29

137

There is yet another case of a newborn with a positive RT-PCR for SARS COV-2 in one

138

throat swab collected at 36 hours after birth.21, 24 However, it was not possible to confirm

139

whether it was a real case of intrauterine transmission since the umbilical cord and

140

placenta blood samples were negative for SARS-CoV-2 and the possibility of postnatal

141

contact could not be discarded.21, 24 No other study reported positive results for the SARS-

143

COVID-19.5, 11-20, 22-26, 29-36

144

In a series of six cases that had blood collected after delivery evaluated, two of the

145

newborns had high levels of IgG and IgM antibodies (>10 AU/mL) and three had high

146

values of IgG antibodies with normal levels of IgM in, but in none SARS-CoV-2 virus

147

was detected by RT-PCR in the oropharyngeal exudate.27 A case study also reported high

148

values of IgM and IgG antibodies in the blood at days 1 and 15 after delivery, but with

149

RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 negative in five samples of nasopharyngeal exudates collected

150

between the first two hours and the 16th day of life.28

Seven studies reported the test of breast milk samples from 13 mothers and none

evidenced SARS-CoV-2 virus.5, 15, 16, 20-22, 28

Maternal and neonatal outcomes

155

The clinical and obstetric conditions most frequently reported were fetal distress (n=20),

156

gestational diabetes (n=13), gestational hypertension (n=11), premature rupture of

157

membranes (PROM) (n=7), anemia (n=5), placenta previa/bleeding in the third trimester

158

(n=5), pre-eclampsia (n=4), hypothyroidism (n=4), chronic hypertension (n=3),

159

thalassemia(n=2), polycystic ovary syndrome (n=2), cholecystitis (n=2), asthma (n=2),

160

diabetes mellitus type 2 (n=2), placental abruption (n=1), oligohydramnios(n=1),

161

polyhydramnios (n=1), hepatitis B infection (n=1) and mitral valve and tricuspid valve

162

replacement (n=1). In one study that compared groups of pregnant women with and

163

without COVID-19, there were no significant differences in the occurrence of gestational

164

diabetes, severe pre-eclampsia, PROM, fetal distress, meconium-stained amniotic fluid,

165

premature delivery, neonatal asphyxia and procedures for severe post-partum bleeding.30

166

Cesarean section was the most common type of delivery: 88.0% of 158 cases with

167

available information. Most studies did not specify the indication for the cesarean section.

168

Four pregnant women with severe COVID-19 required admission to an intensive care

169

unit: one at 30 weeks of gestation, after an emergency cesarean section;19 another case at

170

34 weeks of gestation that resulted in an emergency cesarean for a stillbirth;31 and other

171

two cases at 37 weeks of gestation of women with high BMI (>35) and history of medical

172

complications, admitted for labor induction.12 No maternal deaths from COVID-19 were

173

published.

174

The 182 deliveries resulted in one stillbirth (intrauterine fetal death)31 and 185 live births

175

(four twin pregnancies). There was one neonatal death in a preterm infant (34 completed

176

weeks of gestation) from a pregnant woman with vaginal bleeding in the third trimester.18

177

Preterm birth occurred in 28.7% (45/157) among those with available information on

178

gestational age. Approximately 16% of preterm births were spontaneous due to PROM5,

180

were spontaneous or iatrogenic.

Although all breast milk samples from COVID-19 infected mothers have tested negative

182

for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, most infants did not receive breast milk.

184

Discussion

185

There is no evidence that the risk of infection with COVID-19 in pregnant women is

186

greater than in the general population.7, 37 However, the incidence of infection in pregnant

187

women is unknown, as screening tests were not generally used, except in the presence of

188

symptoms. In a New York’s hospital that implemented universal SARS-CoV-2 testing in

189

all pregnant women admitted for delivery, 15.4% of them were positive for SARS-CoV-

190

2, but 87.9% were asymptomatic.38

191

Although most of the published cases confirm the absence of transmission of the SARS-

192

CoV-2 virus antenatally or intrapartum, at least when the infection occurs in the third

193

trimester of pregnancy,5,

194

transmission is possible.21, 24, 25, 27-29 However, the evidence is still limited to a reduced

195

number of reported cases, large variability in the type of biological material analyzed and

196

the time of its collection. Even if vertical transmission occurred in the reported cases, the

197

proportion would be low, below 5% of the published cases.

198

Regarding the effect of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on the fetus, no congenital malformation

199

has been reported so far and the association of COVID-19 and fetal malformation seems

200

unlikely considering the reduced risk of intrauterine infection.37

201

Higher risk of fetal distress and preterm births have been reported, but it is unclear if

202

preterm birth occurs spontaneously (spontaneous onset of labor or following PROM) or

203

is iatrogenic. The evidence related to the effect of COVID-19 on pregnant women is still

11, 13, 15, 18-26

emerging evidence has suggested that vertical

limited. The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 were similar to those described in non-

205

pregnant women, suggesting that the prognosis is not worse in pregnant women, although

206

the number of cases studied is still reduced.5,

207

summarized the clinical manifestations of 108 pregnant women confirmed with COVID-

208

19 and most of them presented fever (68%) and coughing (34%), and lymphocytopenia

209

(59%) with elevated C-reactive protein (70%).39

210

The maternal and neonatal outcomes observed so far are quite different from the two most

211

serious coronavirus-related previous epidemics.7, 40-53 The first also appeared in China, in

212

2002-03, and was characterized by severe respiratory infections caused by the Severe

213

Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The second occurred in 2012,

214

initially in the Middle East, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome - Coronavirus

215

(MERS-CoV).7, 40 These epidemics have demonstrated the ability of coronavirus to cause

216

serious complications during pregnancy,43, 53 with worse prognosis in pregnant women

217

than non-pregnant women.42, 54

218

In the 2002 epidemic, 12 pregnant women were infected with SARS-CoV, with a fatality

219

rate of 25%.53 Among the seven pregnant women infected in the first trimester, four had

220

a miscarriage.53 Two of the five pregnant women infected during the second or third

221

trimester had fetal growth restriction and four had a preterm delivery (one spontaneous;

222

three induced by the maternal condition).53 In a review of the pregnancy outcomes of 11

223

women infected with MERS-CoV, seven pregnant women required admission to the

224

intensive care unit and three died, of which only one had one comorbidity (asthma). Two

225

fetal deaths occurred, and three of nine newborns were preterm.43

226

However, considering that SARS-CoV-2 has genetic homology and some clinical

227

similarities to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and the immunological and physiological

228

changes that occur during pregnancy, such as in cell-mediated immunity or lung function,

A recent systematic review

229

that affect both the susceptibility and the clinical severity of pneumonia, it is important

230

to pay particular attention to the monitoring of pregnant women with COVID-19, because

231

maternal and perinatal adverse outcomes are potentially relevant.7, 40 Although there were

232

no maternal deaths described, possible maternal deaths were reported in social media, but

233

without any robust evidence.37 Furthermore, one study reported two asymptomatic

234

pregnant women at admission for delivery that rapidly evolved to severe COVID-19

235

disease requiring admission to an intensive care unit.12

236

Thus, it is essential to prevent the infection of COVID-19 and any other viral respiratory

237

infection, as these infections represent an increased risk for the pregnant woman and for

238

the pregnancy itself.7, 55, 56 It is therefore extremely important that pregnant women adopt

239

preventive actions for COVID-19 with great intensity.37 For pregnant women with

240

suspected or confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2, recommendations for health

241

professionals and services have already been published.37, 55, 57-59

242

Most women in this review had a cesarean section, many of them without a clear medical

243

indication. The decision on the type of delivery in pregnant women with suspected or

244

confirmed infection with COVID-19 should take into account the maternal and fetal

245

clinical characteristics, as in normal practice, and not the diagnosis of COVID-19

246

infection per se. Thus, there is no obstetric contraindication to any mode of delivery,

247

unless the pregnant woman's clinical condition implies an emergent decision.37

248

In Portugal, we can estimate that about 80,000 pregnant women are exposed to the

249

pandemic at different gestational ages, which represents an important challenge for

250

individual and public health, to avoid infection in this population that should be

251

considered at higher risk. According to the information reported by health professionals,

252

there were eight cases of COVID-19 positive women delivered in Portugal by the 31st of

253

March 2020. None of the first eight infants (all live births) born in Portugal tested positive

254

for the SARS-CoV-2. Preterm birth occurred in 25% (2/8) of them and 5 (62.5%) resulted

255

in cesarean section.

256

The limited scientific knowledge currently available makes it difficult to develop specific

257

breastfeeding recommendations. There is not enough scientific evidence to unequivocally

258

state that there is no possibility that mothers with COVID-19 can transmit the virus

259

through breast milk.55 Therefore, recommendations should be based on the available data

260

5, 15, 16, 20-22, 28

261

Breastfeeding is recognized as the best form of child feeding due to the countless benefits

262

for both the mother and the newborn, including the protection against gastrointestinal and

263

respiratory infections.60 Thus, considering the benefits of breastfeeding and the fact that

264

the transmission of other respiratory viruses is insignificant through breast milk, there is

265

no indication to stop breastfeeding. According to the recommendations of

266

WHO/UNICEF61 and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the United

267

States,55 women with suspected or confirmed infection with COVID-19 can initiate or

268

continue breastfeeding as long as clinical conditions permit. The CDC indicates that the

269

decision to initiate or continue breastfeeding must be determined by the mother with

270

COVID-19, together with family members and health professionals.55

271

Limitations of this systematic review should be acknowledged. Considerable

272

heterogeneity was observed across the studies, which did not allow us to conduct a meta-

273

analysis. On the other hand, we cannot guarantee that we were able to identify all the

274

cases of pregnant women described in the literature. Possibly there are additional cases

275

currently presented in other types of publications, such as reports. Also, considering the

276

importance of summarizing all existing cases, we did not assess the quality of the studies

277

included in this review. Several studies had missing outcome data and selective reporting

278

bias could not be excluded. Additionally, there may be some cases which could be

Conclusion

283

According to this review, fetal distress and preterm delivery seem to be more frequent

284

among pregnant women with COVID-19. There is emerging evidence on possible vertical

285

transmission (four positive results in the neonatal oral swabs for SARS-CoV-2 were

286

reported and three newborns had high values of IgM antibodies), but the clinical relevance

287

of the fetal infection is unclear. So far, there is no evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 virus

288

is transmitted through breast milk. Maternal deaths were not reported and hospitalizations

289

in intensive care were uncommon. Although the complications appear to be similar to

those of non-pregnant women, services must be prepared to attend to complications,

291

especially in pregnant women with comorbidities. Therefore, pregnant women and

292

newborns should be considered particularly vulnerable populations regarding COVID-19

293

prevention and management strategies. Information, counseling and adequate monitoring

294

are essential to prevent major adverse effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection during

295

pregnancy.
