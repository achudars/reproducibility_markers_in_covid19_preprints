ABSTRACT
Background: COVID-19 has emerged as a global pandemic, affecting nearly 104 million people
worldwide as of February 4th 2021. In previous published studies, the association between the mean Vit D
status of each country and COVID-19 infection rate, and mortality among the adult population in
European countries was examined. The aim of this study was to re-examine the relationship between the
Vit D status of each country and COVID-19 infection, recovery, and mortality using updated data and a
different methodological approach.
Methods: Information only form the last decade on Vit D concentration/deficiency for each country was
retrieved through literature search on PubMed® database. As of February, 4th 2021, COVID-19 infections
and mortalities per one million population as well as total recoveries were extracted from the
Worldometer website. The association between vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 infection, recovery,
and mortality were explored using correlation coefficients and scatterplots.
Findings: The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among European countries ranged from 6·0 (Finland)
to 75·5% (Turkey), with several countries facing more than 50% of vitamin D deficiency among their
population. Non-significant correlations were observed between the number of COVID-19 infections
(r=0·190; p=0·374), recoveries (rs=0·317, p=0·131), and mortalities (r=0·129; p=0·549) per one million
population, with the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency.
Interpretation: Prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was not significantly associated with either number of
infections, recoveries or mortality rate of COVID-19 among European countries. Thus, it is an important
parameter to be considered when implementing preventive measures to face COVID-19.
Funding: None
Keywords: Vitamin D, deficiency, COVID-19, infections, mortalities, Europe.

INTRODUCTION
COVID-19 has become a global public health emergency, affecting more than 104 million people
from 218 countries and territories1 in less than a year since the very first outbreak in Wuhan, China.2 As
of February, 4th 2021, the lowest and highest number of confirmed cases were reported among Oceanic
(50.336) and North American (31.357.026) continents respectively.1 This substantial variation in the
number of infections and as well as the severity and mortality of the disease can be accredited to several
factors both at the state level as well as at an individual level. “State level” parameters include diverse
factors, such as a country’s preparedness, actions of the governments, health infrastructure, timing of
lockdown, rapid border closures, implementation of social distancing and socioeconomic status,3 while
the “individual level” includes the sociodemographic factors and other determinants of health status such
as sex, age, chronic diseases, obesity, and malnutrition.4,5
It is well known that malnutrition constitutes a risk factor for increased mortality and morbidity of
several diseases.6 Protein and energy malnutrition, and other specific micronutrient deficiencies have
been shown to manifest adverse effects in immunity and thereby exhibit poor prognosis of viral
infections.7 Regarding micronutrients, the association between vitamin D (Vit D) deficiency and various
diseases’ prevalence and/or severity, such as autoimmune disorders, diabetes, skeletal diseases and acute
respiratory tract infections have been adequately established in the past years.8,9 However, evidence with
regards to Vit D concentration and preventive and/or curative mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection are
limited10 or present some controversies.11-13 Recent studies have demonstrated the mechanisms for
possible interactions between serum vitamin D concentration and rate of COVID-19 infections.
Particularly, Vit D modulates the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), angiotensin (17) (Ang (1-7)), and mas receptor (MasR) axis and plays a crucial role in the protection against lung
infection.14-16 Thereby it acts as a renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitor in treating COVID-19
patients with underlying comorbidities17,18 and can lead to a weakening of the cytokine storm and the

Acute Respiratory Syndrome (ARS) risk among COVID-19 patients, but all this evidence lacking clinical
validation19,20.
In three recently published studies the relationship between mean concentration of Vit D and
number of cases and deaths of COVID-19/1M population in 20 European countries, negative correlations
were reported.10,21,22 In this study we aimed to re-examine the relationship between the status of Vit D and
infections, recoveries, and mortalities of COVID-19 in European countries, using a bigger sample of
countries and a different methodological approach.

METHODS
Data sources and inclusion/exclusion criteria
Information on COVID-19 infections, recoveries and mortalities, were retrieved from the
Worldometer website, which provides real time statistics 1. This source contains data derived directly
from official government reports of individual countries and/or indirectly through reliable local media
resources.
Data on the prevalence of Vit D deficiency among these countries were extracted by conducting a
comprehensive electronic search in PubMed® database (up to February 6th 2021). An advanced search was
performed at the level of title/abstract by using keywords such as “Vitamin D” or “25-hydroxyvitamin
D3”, combined with “deficiency”, “prevalence” or “status” and the name of each European country. The
final search string for each country and additional information about our search strategy are presented in
Supplementary Material.
Inclusion criteria for our study were: a) Population-based studies that reported data in the last ten
years; b) Studies reporting non-institutional adults (>18 years old); c) Studies defining Vit D deficiency
as serum concentration <20 ng/ml or <50 nmol/l; d) Studies reporting Vit D deficiency prevalence of the
sample population; e) European countries with population >1M; f) European countries in which >60.000
COVID-19 test/1M population were performed. Conference proceedings, editorials, commentaries, book

chapters/book reviews and studies confined to selective sample of community-dwelling people, such as
pregnant women, menopausal women and patients with diagnosed illnesses were excluded. As a last step,
out of the screened articles for each country, the prevalence of Vit D deficiency data was retrieved from
the most recently published study, including the most representative sample for each country.

Data extraction
For each European country, information on COVID-19 infections, recoveries and mortalities per
1M population as of February, 4th 2021, were extracted from the Worldometer website.1 From the
selected articles reporting Vit D deficiency among these countries, name of the first author, published
year, sample size, age range of the study population, mean Vit D concentration (nmol/L) and prevalence
(%) of Vit D deficiency were retrieved. All data were extracted by one reviewer (DB) using a
standardized excel form and were checked for accuracy by a second reviewer (MC).

Data analysis
The relationship between the prevalence of Vit D deficiency and variables, such as number of
COVID-19 infections, recoveries and mortalities per 1M population were explored with Pearson (r) or
Spearman’s rank (rs) correlation coefficients. Scatter plots were used to visually represent the
correlations. All countries were represented by a 3-letter country code according to the ISO (International
Organization for Standardization) 3.166, as per the Terminology Bulletin Country Names and the Country
and Region Codes for Statistical Use maintained by the United Nations Statistics Divisions.23 Both
Pearson’s and Spearman’s correlation (2-tailed) tests were performed using the IBM SPSS® version 26·0
software.

A total of 24 European countries, satisfying the inclusion/exclusion criteria were selected for the
analysis24-47 (Table 1). Countries excluded due to their limited population and/or lower number of
COVID-19 tests were Andorra, Channel Islands, Faeroe Islands, Gibraltar, Iceland, Isle of Man,
Liechtenstein Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco, Montenegro, San Marino, and Vatical city. Moreover,
Albania, Belarus, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Netherlands, North Macedonia, Serbia, Slovakia,
Spain, and Sweden were not part in our analysis because of the absence or the non-updated evidence
regarding Vit D concentration, i.e. only data older than 10 years were available. The prevalence of Vit D
deficiency ranged from 6.0-75.5% with the lowest and highest rates reported in Finland,32 and Turkey45
respectively. In 11 of the countries, the majority (>50%) of the adult population studied was Vit D
deficient (i.e. <20 ng/ml or <50 nmol/l).25,27,31,34,39-41,43,45-47 The size of study population which was used
to retrieve data for the prevalence of Vit D deficiency varied from 280 (Slovenia)43 to 74.235 subjects
(Italy).37
As of February, 4th 2021, in regard to the total number of COVID-19 infections per 1M of the total
population, Russia reported the lowest with 2.684/1M population, while the Czech Republic had the
highest with 94.522/1M population infections. Regarding the COVID-19 mortalities per 1M population,
the lowest number, was documented in Norway (105 deaths/1M), whereas the highest number, was
reported in Belgium (1.826 deaths/1M). Regarding total recoveries the lowest number was reported in
Switzerland (365.4/1M) whereas in Czech Republic the highest number of recoveries was observed
(84.136/1M).
Cases of COVID-19 infections per 1M population displayed a non-significant, positive correlation
(r=0·190; p=0·.374) with the prevalence of Vit D deficiency (Figure 1).
As illustrated in Figure 2, COVID-19 mortality per 1M population was also not significantly
correlated with the prevalence of Vit D deficiency (r=0·129; p=0·.549).
As per the recovered COVID-19 cases per 1M population, similarly a non-significant correlation
with the prevalence of Vit D deficiency can be observed in Figure 3 (rs= 0·317, p=0·131). Moreover, the

correlation and the scatter plot of prevalence of Vit D deficiency and total recoveries per COVID-19
cases per country can be found in our Supplementary Material
We also examined the relationships between COVID-19 infections, recoveries and deaths with the
mean vitamin D concentration of each country, as can been seen in the Supplementary Material, but
again no significant correlation was found.

DISCUSSION
Our analysis concluded that the prevalence of Vit D deficiency among the European population
does not constitute a strong risk factor for COVID-19 neither infection, mortality nor recovery rates.
However, these findings are not in line with outcomes of similar research works published recently.10,21,22
According to the outcomes of our study, in several of the European countries included in this
analysis, more than 50% of the adult population was Vit D deficient, which constitutes a factor that
should not be disregarded in the planning of public health preventive measures.

25,27,31,34,39-41,43,45-47

Factors that can influence Vit D concentration include the fluctuations of sunlight exposure among
seasons,48 especially the negligible amount of sunlight during winter and cloud covers during summer
could potentially reduce the cutaneous synthesis of Vit D in some less south located countries,49,50 as well
as extend of clothing coverage and sunscreen use.51,52 Furthermore, dietary sources of Vit D are limited
and the obesity epidemic in the Europe, which is also related to poorer dietary choices, can worsen its
deficiency.53 Additionally, chronic diseases such as kidney disease,54,55 liver disease,56 malignancies57 and
genetic-epigenetic factors58 can influence Vit D status.
The results of our analysis showed that the prevalence of Vit D deficiency is not significantly
associated with COVID-19 infections (r=0·190; p=0·374), recoveries (rs=0·312, p=0·138), and mortality
rates (r=0·129; p=0·549). Nevertheless, the fact that our results differ from previous similar published
studies10,21,22 can be attributed to the alternative methodological approach, which we think is correct. In
our study only prevalence of Vit D deficiency for each European country was used instead of mean Vit D

status for each country, a parameter which was used in those studies. A “mean” value cannot be
representative of the Vit D status of a whole country because it is influenced by outliers and skewed
populations. However, we have also conducted these analyses using updated data regarding Vit D mean
concentration (only from the last decade) without finding any statistical significance (Supplementary
Material). Therefore, we think that in the light of the most recent evidence of the COVID-19 pandemic, as
well as by using updated information on Vit D deficiency prevalence for each included country, we can
end up in more accurate conclusions.
Consequently, of course Vit D deficiency observed in several European countries is considered to
be a crucial factor that should be frequently treated under medical supervision and not only by enhanced
dietary intake59,60 but abuse and/or misuse of Vit D supplementations, as a method to lower the risk for
COVID-19 infection is not considered appropriate.
Numerous preprints with regard to Vit D status and its association with the COVID-19 infection,
recovery and mortality can be found in relevant databases (e.g., medRxiv), but these preprints have not
been peer-reviewed and therefore should not be used as clinical practice guidance; additionally, such fasttrack publications constitute a common risk for low quality information and should not be considered of
paramount importance during the COVID-19 pandemic. An editorial in Lancet, stands equally skeptical
towards findings regarding Vit D supplementation in COVID-19 patients, until more solid data become
available.61 Moreover, also outside the scope of COVID-19, evidence regarding associations of Vit D
with any outcome seems not to be convincing despite the great number of systematic reviews and metaanalyses that have been published.62
Although only 24 European countries satisfied our inclusion criteria, the analysis included a
significant part of the European population.63 Therefore, the results of our study could be generalized to
most of the excluded European countries too. Moreover, along with the majority of high income
countries, upper-middle income countries, such as Russia and Bosnia and Herzegovina were also included
in the analysis,64 reflecting the effect of economic status in the outcomes.

Among the limitations of our study is that the data on prevalence of Vit D deficiency of the
countries included was not generated from national level surveys. Therefore, the very recently published
studies (including data only from the last decade) with the most representative sample for each country’s
population were carefully selected for our analysis. As described in our Methods, screened studies were
limited to adults (≥18 years), as the severity of COVID-19 infections among children has been rather
mild.65 More detailed data regarding neither COVID-19 infection rates per age nor age distribution for
each country was available, and therefore correlations for these subgroups could not be performed.
Governments should implement proper preventive measures to increase awareness among the
populations on the risk of Vit D deficiency rather than on its role in during the COVID-19 pandemic. Vit
D supplementation should be advised only for those belonging to a high risk group of deficiency, such as
new-borns, toddlers, pregnant women, elderly as well as non-Western immigrants,66 always under
medical supervision and not as a preventive factor of COVID-19 infection. There might be several ongoing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining the vitamin D supplementation in COVID-19
patients,67 however until there are solid data available from well-designed RCTs that will allow us to take
relevant clinical decisions, the supplementation of Vit D as a way to prevent infection or improve
recovery cannot be evidence based suggested.

CONCLUSION
Non-significant correlation was detected between the total number of COVID-19 infections per 1M
population (r=0.190; p=0.374), recoveries (rs= 0.317, p=0.131) and mortality per 1M population (r=0.129;
p=0.549) with respect to country-specific prevalence of Vit D deficiency among 24 European countries.
The different methodological approach and the updated data regarding Vit D status of each country
included, led to different results to previous published studies and this should be taken into account for
the clinical practice.
