Abstract
The effective reproductive number Rt of COVID-19 is determined indirectly from data that are only incompletely known. Approaches based
on reconstructing these data by sampling time lags from suitable distributions introduce noise effects that can result in distorted estimates of
Rt . This, in turn, may lead to misleading interpretations of the efficacy of
the various measures taken to limit COVID-19 transmission. We discuss
in some detail a study used for real time monitoring of the reproductive
number in Switzerland; see https://ncs-tf.ch/en/situation-report.

Figure 1: Effective reproductive numbers in Switzerland as shown in the
real time monitoring on May 13. Mean and 95% uncertainty intervals are
estimated on confirmed cases [1]. The shaded region is the onset of strong
public health measures.
We argue that the method used to derive the above curve is systematically flawed and leads to an underestimation of the efficacy of the lockdown. The method adopted by the Robert Koch Institute suffers from
similar deficiencies, their impact is however smaller.

Introduction
The daily varying effective reproductive number Rt is often used to monitor
the spread of epidemic diseases such as COVID-19. It measures the expected
number of secondary infections on day t due to a single infected individual and
is given by
It
,
Rt = P
n>0 It−n wn
where It is the number of new infections on day t (and equally It−n the number
of infections on day t − n and so on), and the wn are the infection intensities, i.e.
wn is the probability that a secondary infection was contracted from a person
who got infected n days earlier. While the infection intensities can be fitted to
available data, the It are not observable directly, unless representative proportions of the population were tested on a daily basis. Therefore, they need to be
inferred indirectly from some other data.
There exist different schemes to reconstruct the It from the data, like the
classical statistical inference methods. In the present article we concentrate on
schemes that are based on the idea of a ”mechanical” reconstruction of the
infection data by sampling time lags of observed data from suitable distributions.
In the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic, such schemes have been
implemented in different ways by various groups in different countries.
In the following section, we present these schemes and show how they systematically introduce noise into the true data. In the remaining sections we
examine the impact of the noise on the reproductive numbers calculated from
these data.

The reconstruction scheme and its smoothing effect
We exemplify the scheme and how it introduces noise into the data by the
version implemented by Scire et al [2], that is very similar to the implementation
by Abbott s, Hellewell J, Thompson RNN et al [3]. For the sake of clarity,
we limit our exposition of the scheme to the observables Ct , the number of
confirmed cases on day t. The other observables used analogously by the group
are hospitalizations and deaths. Moreover, as our focus is on the days around
March 17, when the lockdown started, and as more than two months have
passed since then, we restrict our exposition to those days of infection where all
infections can be assumed to be confirmed by the actual date of the monitoring.
According to the parameters used by the group, 95% of the cases are confirmed
within 20 days after infection. For their method of extending the reconstruction
to later days we refer again to their article.
Now, let X denote the incubation time of a randomly drawn case, i.e. the
time between infection and symptom onset, and analogously Y the time between
symptom onset and confirmation. The distributions of X and Y result from
fitting to available data; see [2] and references therein. Then for every confirmed
case a one samples independently a x0a from the distribution of X and a ya0 from
the distribution of Y .

The reconstructed infection day i0a of this case a is then simply the day when
the virus infection was confirmed minus (x0a +ya0 ). Counting the number of cases
that fall now on day t gives the reconstructed It , that we denote by It0 . The
reproductive numbers calculated from these It0 are denoted by Rt0 .
That this scheme introduces noise into the true data is seen as follows.
We denote the true infection day by ia , the true incubation period by xa and
the true time between symptom onset and confirmation by ya . Then we have
i0a = ia + xa + ya − x0a − ya0 . As the sampled x0a and ya0 are independent of
the true xa and ya (because we don’t know these; we just know that they are
approximately distributed like X and Y , respectively), the reconstructed i0a
equals the true ”signal” ia plus some ”noise” d0a = xa + ya − x0a − ya0 .
As we will see in the now following examples, this results in a smoothing
of the infection number statistics1 , which in turn, under certain circumstances,
has a significant impact on the reproductive numbers calculated from it.

An illustrative example
The following example illustrates the effect of this scheme on the reconstructed
reproductive number. Assume that I1 = 128 and Rt = 2 for t ≤ 6 and Rt = 0.8
for t ≥ 7, and that infectiousness is limited to the day after infection, i.e.
w1 = 1. This yields the ’true’ infection numbers and reproductive numbers
which are illustrated by the red curves in Fig. 2. For the reconstructed data we
take X and Y both to be gaussian with mean 5 and standard deviation 1. Thus,
the ”noise” is also gaussian with mean 0 and standard deviation 2. With this
”noise”, the scheme results in the average in the corresponding blue curves.

Figure 2: ’True’ (red) and reconstructed (blue) infection and reproductive numbers
Of course, the blue curve R0 is prone to lead to wrong decisions: If a lockdown
caused the sharp decline in R from day 6 to day 7, then the blue curve may
suggest that its impact was much less important and that most of the reduction
1 From a mathematical point of view, this is clear: If all the I are large, then we have

C u I ∗ p, where pn = P (X + Y = n), and I 0 u C ∗ p̃, where p̃n = p−n , i.e. I 0 u I ∗ p ∗ p̃.

was achieved already before the lockdown. It might even lead to the conclusion
that the lockdown was not needed at all and that softer measures in force already
before day 6 have had a sufficient effect, where in reality they had no effect at
all. This in turn could lead to the conclusion, that the pandemic can be kept
under control by adhering to soft measures only.

The reproductive number in Switzerland around March 17
We now turn to the situation in Switzerland around March 17, 2020. A calculation based on distributions for the time lags X and Y and the infection intensity
as described in [2] yields the following result:

Figure 3: Cases and reproductive numbers in Switzerland around March 17.
See text below for the definition of the curves.
Unlike in the illustrative example above, we cannot start from ’true’ numbers
of new infections. We instead choose2 the numbers of new infections, denoted by
I f it (red curve), in such a way that the resulting expected numbers of confirmed
cases C av (solid black curve) fit well the black dots C true which show the actually
reported data of confirmed cases [4]. Here, to get C av from the numbers of new
infections, we shift forward the infection day of each such case by sampling
independently from X and Y .
Given I f it , we proceed as in the illustrative example, but, of course, with
”noise” according to these X and Y instead of the gaussians used there. This
gives the reconstructed numbers of new infections I 0 (blue curve). Using the
infection intensities wn from [2], we calculate the corresponding reproductive
numbers Rf it and R0 . The latter matches well the green curve RT F that shows
the estimated mean reproductive numbers, as published on the website [1] on
May 13.
The remarks made above on the illustrative example apply also here. We
note also that our red curve of reproductive numbers is in quite good agreement
with the results of the inference analysis reported in [5, 6].

An alternative approach to reconstruction
Contrary to Switzerland, where, as far as we know, the date of symptom onset
of the single cases is not collected systematically, this information is available
for the majority of the cases in Germany. For the sake of clarity, we assume
here that it is known for all cases.3 Then, the Robert Koch Institute applies the
following simpler scheme [7]:4 The reconstructed infection day i00a of a case a is
the day of its symptom onset minus m, where m is the average incubation time.
Counting the number of cases that fall now on day t gives the reconstructed It
that we denote by It00 . The reproductive numbers calculated from these It00 are
denoted by Rt00 .
Of course we can view the subtracted value m as sample from the distribution
of the constant time lag X = m. Therefore, this scheme is at least formally very
similar to the one adopted by [2].
From the above discussion it is now clear that the so reconstructed infection
times i00a = ia + d00a with ”noise” d00a = xa − m lead also to a smoothing of
the infection number statistics and thus to misleading reproductive numbers.
But it is also intuitively clear, that the impact is significantly smaller. This is
confirmed by the following calculation.
Assume that the above I f it are the true new infections per day, and that the
distribution of the incubation time X is as above. Denote by Stav the resulting

expected number of cases with symptom onset on day t. Then It00 = St+m
Assuming moreover that also the infection intensities are as above, we get the
following result:

numbers of cases with symptom onset per day (yellow) and of confirmed cases
per day (black). Right: The corresponding ’true’ reproductive numbers (red)

We stress that the knowledge of the dates of symptom onset is an advantage,

our focus is again on the days around March 17, we restrict our exposition to those
days of infection where all infections can be assumed to be confirmed by the actual date of
the monitoring. For a method to extend the reconstruction to later days we refer to [7].

as adopting the same scheme but with dates of confirmation instead of symptom
onset, would introduce the ”noise” xa + ya − m0 , where m0 is the average time
between infection and confirmation, into the true data, and this is clearly more
”noise” than in the scheme based on dates of symptom onset.

Conclusion
In this note we have reexamined a type of schemes used to estimate the effective
reproductive numbers Rt for COVID-19 by the example of two versions actually in use [2, 7]. These schemes are based on reconstruction of not directly
observable data by sampling time lags of observed data from suitable distributions. Noise effects inherent in these schemes smooth the number statistics of
the true data. The analysis of thus smoothed number statistics yields stable
results and is easier to handle than classical inference methods as applied in
[5, 6]. However, under certain circumstances like the current COVID-19 pandemic, the introduced noise effects dominate the information contained in the
true data and lead to erroneous interpretations. The simpler approach adopted
by [7] performs better than the one used in [2]. Moreover, we point out that
adequate knowledge of the date of symptom onset is an advantage.

Appendix A: Fitting algorithm
Our algorithm leading to the curves I f it and Rf it of Fig. 3 can be viewed as a
deterministic or non-Bayesian version of the analysis performed in [6] to estimate
the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions on COVID-19 in Europe. We give
in the following the details of our algorithm.
As in the main text, we denote by wn , n ≥ 1, the infection intensities and
by Rt the effective reproductive number on day t.
We assume that no infections were present in Switzerland before t0 = February 24, 2020, i.e. for t < t0 we set It = 0.
The period between t0 and t1 = March 06 is taken as the burn-in phase,
where we assume that each day λ infections are imported and that these already
lead to secondary infections, i.e. for t = t0 , t0 + 1, . . . , t1 − 1, we set
X
It = Rt
It−n wn + λ.
n≥1

After t1 , we assume that the ”internal” secondary infections dominate such
that imported infections can be neglected, i.e. for t ≥ t1 the number of new
infections It are given by
X
It = Rt
It−n wn .
n≥1

In particular, we assume throughout that the number of new infections is a
deterministic function of the imported infections and of the reproductive numbers, i.e. that random fluctuations in the number of infections can be neglected.

A posteriori, these choices turn out to be consistent. According to our fit
of the new infections per day, we get approximately 500 new cases for March
06. Thus, the neglected fluctuations are with a fairly large probability within
twice the square root of 500, i.e. within ±45, while the fitted value for λ is
approximately 47.
We denote by Z the (random) number of days between infection and confirmation by virus test. Then the number of cases that are tested on day t and
confirmed positive is given by
Ct =

δt (s + Zs,i ),

s≤t i=1

where Zs,i are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) copies of Z and
δt (x) = 1, if x = t, and 0 otherwise.
We denote the probability measure of the common probability space of all
these random variables by P , and expected values with respect to P by E. For
the expected number Ctav = E[Ct ] of confirmed cases on day t we get

where we make explicit, that this series depends on the series of reproductive
numbers, R = (Rt ), and on the number λ of daily imported infections during
the burn-in phase.
Next, we denote by Cttrue the true number of cases confirmed positive on
day t. For determining the best fit, we use the L2 -distance expression in the
form5

where the last information taken into account is that of T = April 27, 2020, the
last number of confirmed cases not affected by the first relaxation of measures

Then we set
(Rf it , λf it ) = argmin χ2 (R, λ),
(R,λ)∈A×R

where A is a suitable set of admissible R-curves, encoding a priori assumptions
to reduce the number of parameters to be fitted, which is necessary, because
minimization over all R-curves would lead to overfitting. The a priori assumptions made by us are as follows.
It is reasonable to assume that the Rt do not fluctuate largely from day
to day, except possibly around a limited number of ”change points”, where a
5 The reason, why we choose the L2 -distance between the cumulative counts and not between the daily counts, is that testing shows a weekly pattern due to non-corona related
effects. Its impact shows less in the cumulative view. We refer to appendix B for a more
direct way to take these effects into account.

change of measures is put in force. Therefore, we have chosen A to consist of
piecewise linear R-curves. As we concentrate on the days around the lockdown,
we limit ourselves to a minimal number of pieces. The natural choices for
the change points are t2 = March 12 (the last day of ”normal life”), t3 =
March 13 (the press conference announcing first drastic measures), t4 = March
17 (lockdown), t5 = March 20 (ban of gatherings > 5 people), t6 = March
27 (intermediate change point). After that, we assume that the reproductive
number stays constant. (Here, the intermediate change point is introduced to
test that after the ”ban of gatherings > 5 people” the reproductive number stays
effectively approximately constant. If this was not the case, then the choice of
change points needed revision.) Moreover, the case numbers are too low to
estimate the reproductive numbers in the burn-in phase. Therefore, we rely for
this period on typical estimates found in the literature and set Rt = 3.30, for t
between February 24 and March 05. Finally, as up to March 20 measures are
strengthened, but never relaxed, we require that the admissible R-curves do not
increase before t5 . Summarizing, we choose
A = {R =(Rt )t=Feb 24,...,Apr 27 : R is piecewise linear with change
points at t1 , . . . , t6 and RFeb 24 = RMar 05 = 3.30,
Rt1 ≥ Rt2 ≥ · · · ≥ Rt5 , RT = Rt6 },
i.e. we fit 6 reproductive numbers, RMar 06 , RMar 12 , RMar 13 , RMar 17 , RMar 20 ,
RMar 27 , plus λ.
We would like to emphasize that the reproductive numbers resulting from
this fitting procedure are quite unstable, in particular with respect to variations
of the distributions of Z and of the infection intensities wn that are not inferred
here but estimated elsewhere [2, 8]. Therefore, Rf it should at most be considered
a likely picture of reality. To get more confidence in the results, a thorough
sensitivity analysis would be required, confidence intervals should be calculated
(see e.g. the above mentioned [6]), and improvements to the analysis like the
ones described in appendix B schould be incorporated.

Appendix B: Suggested improvements to the analysis
The simple analysis described above only gives a first indication of the reproductive numbers around the lockdown. In order to more precisely quantify the
effects of the measures on the reproductive number, this analysis should be
extended to include at least the following elements.

Find change points in a systematic way
Instead of choosing the change points by a priori reasoning as above, one can
infer them from the data by replacing the above A by
A = {R =(Rt )t=Feb 24,...,Apr 27 : ∃(τi )i=1,...,6 with t0 < τ1 < · · · < τ6 such that
R is piecewise linear with change points at τ1 , . . . , τ6 and
RFeb 24 = RMar 05 = 3.30, Rτ1 ≥ Rτ2 ≥ · · · ≥ Rτ5 , RT = Rτ6 }.
Weekend effects
Weekend effects can be taken into account by substituting the above Ct by

Here, ζt,i , i ≥ 1, are i.i.d. copies of ζwd(t) , where wd(t) ∈ {Mon, Tues, . . . , Sun}
denotes the weekday of t. P (ζSat = 2) is then the probability, that a test that
without weekend effects would have been performed on a Saturday was actually
performed on the following Monday. These probabilities could be estimated
directly from the confirmed cases, or they can be fitted together with the other
parameters. For the expected number of confirmed cases on day t we get then

Impact of quarantining on infection intensities
A natural guess for the infection intensities wnqu of those that quarantine starting
the day after the onset of symptoms is
wn P (X ≥ n)
, n ≥ 1,
k≥1 wk P (X ≥ k)

wnqu = P

where X denotes the incubation time.
The average infection intensities at day t are then
γt wn + (1 − γt )wnqu ,
where γt ∈ [0, 1] is the proportion of infectives on day t that do not quarantine although symptomatic. Thus, quarantining can be taken into account by
minimizing over A × R × G, where G consists of an adequate set of admissible
γ-curves.
