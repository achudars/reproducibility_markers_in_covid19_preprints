ABSTRACT
Despite rapid progress in characterizing the role of host genetics in SARS-Cov-2 infection, there
is limited understanding of genes and pathways that contribute to COVID-19. Here, we integrated
a genome-wide association study of COVID-19 hospitalization (7,885 cases and 961,804 controls
5

from COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative) with mRNA expression, splicing, and protein levels
(n=18,502). We identified 27 genes related to inflammation and coagulation pathways whose
genetically predicted expression was associated with COVID-19 hospitalization. We functionally
characterized the 27 genes using phenome- and laboratory-wide association scans in Vanderbilt
Biobank (BioVU; n=85,460) and identified coagulation-related clinical symptoms, immunologic,

10

and blood-cell-related biomarkers. We replicated these findings across trans-ethnic studies and
observed consistent effects in individuals of diverse ancestral backgrounds in BioVU, pan-UK
Biobank, and Biobank Japan. Our study highlights putative causal genes impacting COVID-19
severity and symptomology through the host inflammatory response.

SINGLE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
15

Large-scale genomic studies identify genes in the inflammation and coagulation pathways
contributing to risk and symptomology of COVID-19 disease.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first reported in December 2019 and rapidly progressed into a
global pandemic (1). Approximately 10-20% of patients known to be infected with the respiratory
virus SARS-CoV-2 need hospitalization (2), and among them, a fraction face significant morbidity
5

and mortality (3). The host’s genetic background is likely to contribute in explaining such diverse
clinical outcomes. While previous efforts have demonstrated the role of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in
host defense against COVID-19 (4), there remains limited understanding for the role of host
genetics contributing to severe COVID-19 outcome variability.

10

Here we integrated mRNA expression, splicing, and protein abundance data (n=18,502) with
GWAS of COVID-19 related hospitalization (n=7,885 cases, 961,804 controls; Freeze 4 COVID19 HGI excluding 23andMe participants (5–9) ) to map genes and pathways involved in COVID19 severity. We performed mRNA/splicing/protein transcriptome-wide association studies
(TWAS/spTWAS/PWAS) to identify 27 genes across 13 genomic regions whose genetically

15

predicted activity is associated with COVID-19 related hospitalization. We investigated the
functional role of these 27 genes using phenome-wide (PheWAS) and laboratory-wide (LabWAS)
association scans to map their role in immunity and blood biomarkers in European and African
ancestry patients from the Vanderbilt University Medical Center biobank (BioVU; n=85,460). We
replicated phenotypes identified from BioVU in secondary cohorts of multi-ethnic individuals

20

from the Pan-UK Biobank (980 Admixed American, 6,636 African, 8,876 Central/South Asian,
2,709 East Asian, 420,531 European, and 1,599 Middle Eastern) and Biobank Japan (up to 212,453
Japanese participants). Taken together, our results suggest multiple molecular mechanisms
contributing to severe COVID-19 outcomes and highlight potential therapeutic targets.

To identify genes underlying COVID-19 related hospitalization, we tested the predicted expression
of 22,207 genes across 49 tissues for association with COVID-19 related hospitalization (see
Methods). We identified 123 associations representing 21 genes across 45 tissues at 8 independent
genomic regions (p-value < 2.3E-6; Fig. 1, 2; Tables S1-S3). Next, to improve statistical power,
5

we tested for association between predicted gene expression levels from multiple tissues

simultaneously with COVID-19 related hospitalization GWAS. Of the 22,207 tested genes, we
identified 14 genes across 10 genomic regions, which consisted of 2 additional genes – XCR1 and
DNAH3 (p-value < 1.4E-06; Fig. S1.; Table S4.). Overall, we found 23 TWAS-based gene
associations across 10 genomic regions.

To find additional support for genetic regulation of identified susceptibility genes by SNPs at risk
regions, we tested the 123 gene/tissue pairs identified in single-tissue scans for allelic imbalance
within 1Mb GWAS regions (see Methods). We identified 9 genes (ABO, CCR2, CXCR6, FYCO1,
5

IFNAR2, IL10RB, LZTFL1, OAS1, OAS3) with evidence of allelic imbalance at COVID-19 GWAS
risk variants, with 3 genes (ABO, OAS3, IL10RB; see Fig. S2., Table S5.) when restricted to
leading GWAS index variants (p-value < 0.05 / 21). Together, these results further support a model
where risk is conferred through genetic dysregulation at susceptibility genes.

Next, we focused on the impact of genetic regulation of alternative splicing for COVID-19 severity
and performed a multi-tissue splicing transcriptome-wide association study (spTWAS; see
Methods). Overall, we tested 131,376 splice sites of predicted alternative-splicing expression
across 49 tissues for association with COVID19 related hospitalization and identified 420

identified 34 splice variants for 12 genes (2 genes – IFIT3 and GNL3 not identified in single-tissue
scans) across 40 tissues (p-value < 3.7E-07; see Fig. S3.; Table S9.).
Comparing genes identified from TWAS (23 genes) and spTWAS (13 genes), 9 genes were
5

implicated by both approaches - LZTFL1, DPP9, IL10RB, IFNAR2, OAS3, FYCO1, ABO, OAS1
and XCR1. Alternative splicing had stronger overall association signals at the 9 genes in common
(p-value = 2.17E-09), with 5/9 genes showing greater signals on average (p-value < 0.05 / 9; see
Table S10.).

10

Next, we interrogated the role of genetic regulation of protein abundances and performed a
proteome-wide association study (PWAS) using 1,031 predictive models of plasma proteins fitted
from population data in the INTERVAL study (N=3,301; see Methods) (10). Of the 1,031 tests
performed, 2 genes (ABO, and OAS1) were significantly associated with COVID-19 related
hospitalization (p-value < 4.85E-5; Fig. 1, Table S11.).

15

Phenome- and laboratory-wide association scans highlight functional role for
the 27 genes
We investigated the potential functional role of the 27 TWAS genes using data of 1,404 clinical
phenotypes for N=70,439 individuals of European ancestry using the Vanderbilt Biobank, BioVU
(see Methods; Fig. 4., Table S12.). Overall, 40 clinical phenotypes were significantly associated

20

with genetically-predicted ABO, IFNAR2, and CCR1 expression levels; ABO accounted for the
majority (30 out of 40) of the associations. Across the 17 phenotype categories, we found
circulatory system-related phenotypes were enriched for association (see Methods; 7.23-fold
enrichment, p-value = 8.62E-22, Table S13). We repeated an enrichment analysis using all
association data, regardless of statistical significance, and observed circulatory- and infectious

25

disease-related phenotypes strongly enriched for association signal on average (p-value < 3.9E44; Table S14). Top associations with genetically-derived ABO gene expression were driven by
circulatory system phenotypes, including acute pulmonary heart disease, deep vein thrombosis,
other venous embolism and thrombosis, pulmonary heart disease, and acute pulmonary thrombosis
and infarction (OR=1.47; p-value = 3.97E-11). IFNAR2 was associated with migraine (OR = 1.35;

30

p-value = 4.10E-06) and with throat pain (OR = 2.05; p-value = 2.62E-05; Table S12).

(x-axis) and -log10(p-value) (y-axis). The dashed line represents Bonferroni threshold, and most significant

Next, we focused on laboratory results for N=70,337 individuals of European ancestry using the
Vanderbilt Biobank, BioVU (see Methods). For the 323 laboratory traits tested, we found 32 labs
significantly associated with four genes (ABO, IFNAR2, KEAP1, and SLC6A20; p-value < 1.55E5

04; see Fig. 5., Table S15.). Of these, ABO captured 27/32 significant associations (mean OR =
1.33; p-value = 8.02E-14 < 1.40E-04). Across the 12 broad lab definitions in our data, our
significant LabWAS findings were enriched for blood-related lab measurements (see Methods;
4.21-fold enrichment, p-value = 1.23E-11; Table S16.). When extending our enrichment analyses
to all associations, we found blood- (see Methods; p-value = 9.23E-22; Table S17.) and immune-

10

related labs (p-value = 2.81E-14) displayed the greatest enrichment, with toxicology-, urinary-,
and cancer-related labs exhibiting significant depletion of signal (Table S17.). Geneticallypredicted ABO expression was associated with various measures of blood and platelet count,
coagulation factors, and ferritin in blood, as well as labs measuring immune and metabolic function
(Table S15.). Genetically-predicted IFNAR2 expression was negatively associated with creatine

kinase (OR=0.89; p=5.85E-05; Table S15.). Genetically-predicted KEAP1 expression was
positively associated with total cholesterol, and non-high-density lipoprotein levels (beta= 0.50,
p=3.72E-05). SLC6A20 genetically-predicted expression was negatively associated with basophil
volume in blood (beta = -0.19, p= 4.04e-5) and magnesium volume in serum/plasma (beta= -0.26,
5

p= 1.04e-4).

Cross-ancestry phenotypic comparisons
To perform cross-ancestry validation of the clinical and laboratory phenotypes implicated in the
European-based results, we performed PheWAS and LabWAS in the N=15,123 individuals of
10

African ancestry in the BioVU records. Of the 32 identified laboratory measures, we found 22
ABO-associated labs replicated at nominal levels (p-value < 0.05) with 5 replicating after adjusting
for the number of tests performed (p-value < 0.05 / 32). We attribute lack of statistical power to
the 17 phenotypes that did not replicate after multiple testing correction. Effect sizes across

ancestries were highly concordant (slope=0.87, 95CI [0.73, 1.01], p-value = 1.66-13; see Methods;
Table S15), with no individual gene/lab pair demonstrating evidence of significant heterogeneity
(p-value < 0.05 / 32). Of the 40 clinical phenotypes identified in participants of European ancestry,
we found none that replicated at Bonferroni adjusted levels. This was largely due to reduced
5

statistical power from smaller sample sizes, as estimated effect-sizes were similar across ancestries
(slope=0.33, 95CI[0.25, 0.41], p-value = 6.72E-10; see Methods; Table S12.). These crossancestry analyses suggest similar effects of predicted expression on relevant clinical and laboratory
phenotypes.

10

We next sought to test cross-ancestry replication of identified phenotypes in the Pan-UK Biobank
and Biobank Japan. Briefly, we performed PheWAS using LD-independent eQTL/sQTL SNPs
(see methods) of TWAS-identified genes. We identified 233 FDR significant SNP-phenotype
results dominated by the associations between ABO (214/233, 91.8%) SNPs and blood differential
tests such as basophils and monocytes. A subset of 80/233 (34.3%) FDR significant associations

15

also were nominally significant in at least one population of non-European ancestry (p-value <
0.05; Tables S18.-S19.). There were six instances of FDR significant effect estimate heterogeneity
across ancestries, all of which involved ABO SNPs and the biomarker alkaline phosphatase or
erythrocyte properties. We next tested how significant EUR effect estimates reflect SNP effects
across ancestries. We found that EUR SNP effects significantly predicted SNP effects in six global

20

ancestry groups (maximum prediction in AMR; Table S20.).

DISCUSSION
COVID-19 disease is characterized by a wide variability in presentations and severity. We
integrated multi-tiered regulatory information with publicly available variant-level data to identify
genes associated with COVID-19 related hospitalization. To investigate the clinical relevance of
25

these findings, we performed a phenome-wide and lab-wide assessment of the genetically
predicted mRNA expression value of each gene that was significantly associated with COVID-19.
We further examined these associations across diverse ancestries and found nominal replication of
blood cell traits in diverse ancestral cohorts of Pan-UKBB, BBJ, and an African American
population in BioVU.

All three TWAS approaches (mRNA expression, splicing, and protein expression) identified two
genes – ABO at 9q34.2 and OAS1 at 12q24.13. PheWAS results implicated ABO in several
thrombotic and coagulation-related phenotypes. Thrombotic complications are reported to be both
risk factors and sequalae to COVID-19 diagnosis. For example, coagulopathic conditions such
5

venous thromboembolism (11, 12), deep vein thrombosis (13), and pulmonary heart disease and
embolism (14, 15) constitute of more than 30% prevalent disorders in hospitalized COVID-19
patients. Abnormal blood cell indices are a common denominator shared by severe COVID-19
(16) and thrombotic disorders (17). These phenotypic observations are further supported by labtrait associations which showed predicted expression of ABO was associated with coagulation

10

factor VIII, which is critical for thrombotic homeostasis regulated by its carrier protein - von
Willebrand factor (18, 19). Analysis in individuals of both European and African ancestry
supported predicted ABO expression associating with blood differential tests including mean
corpuscle volume, monocyte count, and erythrocytes.

15

We observed that associated phenotypes and gene functions converged on cytokine-cytokine
receptor signaling involved in inflammatory response (e.g., CXCR6, CCR9, CCR5, XCR1,
IFNAR2, IL10RB), and on JAK-STAT signaling pathways involved in antiviral host response (e.g.,
IFNAR2, OAS1, OAS3). IFNAR2 encodes the interferon-alpha/beta receptor beta chain and is
responsible for stimulating interferon response which is critical for anti-viral immunity previously

20

observed in influenza viral infection (20). IFNAR2 is hypothesized to modulate immune response
to COVID-19 (21–23) and interferon deficiency is reportedly associated with severe symptoms
of COVID-19 (24–26). These findings are reinforced by results showing that reduced expression
(observed in 14 of the 16 significant tissues) of IFNAR2 is associated with COVID-19 related
hospitalization. Genetically predicted expression of IFNAR2 was associated with migraine in

25

BioVU patients without severe COVID-19. Given that more than 10% of the COVID-19 diagnosed
individuals requiring hospitalization reported migraine and headache symptoms (27, 28), we
hypothesize that reduced host expression of IFNAR2 may modulate risk for migraine symptoms in
the context of severe COVID-19 infection.

30

Our results are consistent with previous studies investigating the impact of inflammation on severe
COVID-19 outcomes; however, we note there are limitations. First, TWAS analyses rely on SNPPage | 13

based predictive models of mRNA and alternative splicing trained using mostly European-ancestry
individuals in GTEx v8 (29). While consistent with the ancestry makeup of COVID-19 HGI
GWAS ((6); https://www.covid19hg.org/), applying these models to non-European individuals
(e.g., African Americans in BioVU) will result in loss of power or bias due to different underlying
5

linkage disequilibrium patterns. Second, TWAS uses mRNA, alternative splicing, or protein levels
in bulk tissue, with cell-type effects likely to be missed. Third, TWAS assumes additivity of SNP
effects on gene expression and downstream hospitalization risk, which ignores the possibility of
epistatic and gene-environment interactions contributing to COVID-19 related hospitalization risk.
Finally, our study focuses on the host genetic factors that contribute to severe COVID-19 but did

10

not incorporate the social determinants of health that are known to influence risk for severe
COVID-19. The biological insights identified here should not be interpreted as explanatory factors
for disparity, but instead as key genomic pathways modulating host response to SARS-Cov-2
across populations.

15

Functional studies of key genes identified are needed to identify mechanisms through which these
genes influence COVID-19 related hospitalization. Additionally, while well-powered molecular
genetic datasets in diverse populations often lag behind European-ancestry counter parts, massive
collaborative science efforts such as the HGI-19 continue to accumulate new datasets to address
this discrepancy. Leveraging population eQTL/spQTL/pQTL data with ancestry-matched

20

COVID-19 GWAS will be crucial in identifying and understanding mechanisms underlying
COVID-19 related hospitalization. In conclusion, our work raises specific hypotheses relating host
genetic variation to symptom and lab-trait profiles thereby focusing efforts for future drug
repurposing and therapeutic discovery research.

statistics do not include 23&Me cohort results, and their sample size was removed from final
sample reported. Genome-wide association statistics consisted of inverse-variance meta-analyzed
log-odds ratios and their standard errors to compute a final Wald statistic and p-value. Most of the
5

individuals of the contributing studies to meta-analysis genomic study were of European descent
(93%). We performed strict quality control on GWAS data, by filtering statistics at palindromic
variants, harmonizing variants with GTEx v8 European-panel genotypes (29). Our quality control
procedure resulted in a final count of 10,340,768 autosomal genetic variants with summary
statistics.

TWAS and spTWAS using models of predicted gene and alternative splicing
expression
To perform TWAS and spTWAS we leveraged pre-trained prediction models fitted in GTEx v8
data (49 tissues, N=838) using the fine-mapping software DAP-G with a biologically-informed
prior, Multivariate Adaptive Shrinkage in R (MASHR). For detailed information regarding

15

molecular, genetic, and phenotypic data in GTEx v8, please see (29). Prediction models for each
tissue were integrated with COVID19-HGI GWAS data using the software S-PrediXcan (30). In
total, we tested 655,563 and 1,728,429 models of total expression and alternative splicing,
respectively for association with severe COVID19 outcomes, however, owing to the significant
amount of correlation across tissues, we used a per-tissue Bonferroni correction threshold in our

20

multi-tissue analyses (see Table S1). To combine association statistics across all tissues while
adjusting for tissue–tissue correlation, we used S-MultiXcan (31). For 22,206 genes, we also
performed a joint multi-tissue approach using S-MultiXcan which accounts for tissue correlation
and boosts statistical power. Here, we applied a single Bonferroni correction of 0.05 / 22,206.

PWAS using models of predicted expression
25

To perform a protein-wide association study (PWAS) using predicted protein expression, we fitted
predictive models using genetic and plasma proteins from European-ancestry individuals in the
INTERVAL study (N=3,301) (10). We performed quality control on genotype data and kept only
bi-allelic SNPs with MAF ≧ 0.01, HWE p > 5e-5, imputation quality INFO > 0.6 and were

annotated in HapMap3. Plasma proteins had undergone strict quality control and adjustment in the
30

within 1Mb flanking the gene body (i.e., ±500kb gene start and stop). For measured proteins
consisting of multiple monomers (i.e., dimer, trimer, etc.), we fit multiple predictors, each
restricted contributing gene’s region. We included the following covariates into all downstream
models of protein abundance: age, sex, duration of blood processing, the top 3 genotyping PCs,
5

contributing cohort, and top 4 protein PCs). To reduce the number of tests and increase statistical
power, we restricted to genes whose protein levels exhibited evidence of genetic control by testing
for non-zero cis-heritability (p-value < 0.05) using GCTA. Our final set of local/cis-based
predictors resulted in 1,031 models of protein with significant cis-SNP heritability (p-value <
0.05). We fit penalized linear models using SuSiE (32) and performed downstream PWAS using

10

the tool FUSION (33) with the same quality controlled genome-wide association statistics as
above.

Allelic Specific Expression
To determine the allelic effect of GWAS SNPs (p-value < 5e-5) on identified susceptibility genes,
we used haplotype-level ASE data with WASP filtering (34) from the GTEx v8, containing 15,253
15

samples spanning over 49 human tissues and 838 individuals (29, 35). We used haplotypeaggregated allelic expression generated by phASER (36). To assess cis-acting regulatory effect of
expression imbalance between the alleles in heterozygous individuals, we compared allelic
imbalance between the individuals homozygous and heterozygous for each SNP. All individuals
with minimum coverage of 8 reads (with one pseudocount added) were included. Allelic imbalance

20

was quantified as the log ratio between the two allelic counts or log allelic Fold Change (log aFC)
(37) and to ensure robustness to rare variant effects and phasing errors the absolute value of log
aFCs are compared, using a one-sided ranksum test. We used a gene-level Bonferonni correction
for the total number of genes tested (p-value < 0.05 / 21).

EHR-based PheWAS
25

To better understand the phenotypic consequences of dysregulated mRNA expression across our
genes of interest, we performed a Phenome-Wide Association Study (PheWAS) (38) including
patients in the Vanderbilt EHR and linked biobank, BioVU. Phenotypes in BioVU are represented
as phecodes, which are assigned as a dichotomous trait and are a hierarchical clustering of the
International Classification of Diseases (ICD9/ICD10) codes. For each phenotype we required a

minimum number of 100 cases for inclusion in our PheWAS analyses, which resulted in testing
1,404 phecodes in 70,439 individuals of European ancestry and 740 phecodes in 15,174
individuals of African ancestry. We used the PheWAS package in R to perform logistic
regressions to identify the phecodes that are significantly associated with imputed gene
5

expression after adjusting for sex, age, and the top ten principal components from genetic data
to control for population stratification (Denny et al. 2010, 2013). We corrected for the number
of tests (i.e. 0.05/1404 = 3.56e-05) to determine statistical significance.

EHR Biomarker LabWAS
The Lab-Wide Association Scan (LabWAS) (39) allows us to screen clinical lab tests from the
10

Vanderbilt University Medical Center EHR. For each gene identified in the TWAS analyses, we
tested the association between its predicted gene expression and all clinical labs. We applied the
QualityLab cleaning pipeline (39) with settings to yield median age-adjusted (residual taken after
regressing the cubic splines of age with 4 knots) inverse normal quantile transformed lab values
(to control for skewness and non-normality). We screened across all labs with measurements for

15

at least 100 individuals, which resulted in testing 323 labs in 70,337 individuals of European
ancestry and 241 labs in 15,123 individuals of African ancestry. The lab tests are divided into 12
sub-categories; blood, metabolic, endocrine, kidney, immune, liver, urinary, OB/gyn, toxicology,
cardiovascular and cancer. Our analyses included the covariates age, sex, and top ten principal
components from genetic data to adjust for genetic ancestry. We used a Bonferroni-corrected

20

threshold accounting for the number of labs present in the associations tested (i.e. 0.05/323 =
1.55e-04).

PheWAS and LabWAS category enrichment analyses
We tested for enrichment of association signals across the clinical categories of phenotypes
(laboratories) in PheWAS (LabWAS) in two ways. First, we performed a hypergeometric test
25

using phenotypes/labs that were labelled as significant/not-significant per category. Second, we
performed a relaxed test that considers for the average magnitude of association signal in a given
category. Here, we computed the mean 𝜒𝜒 2 association statistic per phenotype (laboratory) category

and bootstrapped its standard error using 2000 bootstraps. Our enrichment (depletion) statistics for
a phenotype (laboratory) category were the difference between its mean 𝜒𝜒 2 from 1 (the expected

value < 0.05 / k to determine enrichment or depletion for either aproach, where k=17 for PheWAS
category enrichment tests and k=12 for LabWAS category enrichment tests.

Cross-ancestry gene effects
5

We compared effect-sizes of predicted expression on phenotypes and laboratories estimated in
European-ancestry patients from the BioVU with estimates obtained from of African-ancestry
records. To do so, we performed a weighted linear regression, 𝛽𝛽̂𝐴𝐴,𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽̂𝐸𝐸,𝑖𝑖 𝛼𝛼 + 𝜖𝜖𝑖𝑖 , where 𝛽𝛽̂⋅,𝑖𝑖 are the
effect-sizes estimated for the ith gene/phenotype or gene/laboratory pair in African- (A) or

10

European-ancestry (E) patients, 𝛼𝛼 is the cross-ancestry relationship, and 𝜖𝜖𝑖𝑖 ∼ 𝑁𝑁 �0, 𝜎𝜎 2 ⋅
2
𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆�𝛽𝛽̂𝐴𝐴,𝑖𝑖 � � is the gene/phenotype-specific (gene/laboratory) noise parameterized by the overall

variance 𝜎𝜎 2 and squared standard-error around the African-ancestry-based estimate. We report
estimates of 𝛼𝛼� and its 95 confidence intervals assuming normality.

Cross-ancestry SNP effects

We investigated BioVU phenotypes and laboratory measures significantly associated with TWAS15

associated loci for heterogeneous effects in the trans-ethnic Pan-UK Biobank (Pan-UKB). The
Pan-UKB represents a multi-ancestry analysis of 7,221 phenotypes in six continental ancestry
groups: African (AFR N=6,636), Admixed American (AMR N=980), Centra/South Asian (CSA
N=8,876), East Asian (EAS N=2,709), European (EUR N=420,531), and Middle Eastern (MID
N=1,599). The Pan-UKB consists of 16,119 genome-wide association studies of biological assays,

20

health status, behavioral information, and lifestyle factors. We clumped SNPs in PLINK using
eQTL/sQTL p-values (q-value ≦ 0.05) reported in GTEx v8 and limited pair-wise SNP

correlations to r2=0.1 over 250kb windows. Per-tissue clumping resulted in 27 SNPs (ABO,
IFNAR2, CCR1, and SLC6A20) that were tested with respect to 1,571 Pan-UKB phenotypes from
the same trait domains detected by PheWAS in BioVU (e.g., circulatory system, digestive disorder,
25

neurological). We used linear models to test for consistency of EUR effect estimates at FDR
significant and high confidence SNPs with those estimated in AFR, AMR, CSA, EAS (Pan-UKB
and Japan Biobank), and MID populations. Additionally, we used Biobank Japan to verify
associations between EUR and EAS-based SNP effects in the Pan-UKB due to increased sample
