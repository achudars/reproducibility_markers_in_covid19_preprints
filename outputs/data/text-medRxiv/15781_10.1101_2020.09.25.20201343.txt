ABSTRACT
Objectives:

The

multifaceted

manifestation

of

COVID-19

requires

longitudinal

characterization of symptoms, to aid with screening and disease management.
Methods: Phone interviews and follow-ups were completed with 112 mostly mild COVID-19
RT-PCR-positive adult patients, over a six-months period.
Results: More than one symptom at disease onset was experienced by ~70% of the patients.
About 40% of the patients experienced fever, dry cough, headache, or muscle ache as the first
symptom. Fatigue, if reported, usually was the first to appear. Smell and taste changes were
experienced 3.9 ± 5.4 and 4.6 ± 5.7 days (mean ± SD) after disease onset and emerged as first
symptom in 15% and 18% of patients, respectively. Fever had the shortest duration (5.8 ± 8.6
days), and taste and smell changes were the longest-lasting symptoms (17.2 ± 17.6 and 18.9
± 19.7 days, durations censored at 60 days). Longer smell recovery correlated with smell
change severity. Cough, taste change and smell change persisted after negative RT-PCR tests
(in 20%, 26% and 29% of the patients in total). At six-months follow-up, 46% of the patients
had at least one unresolved symptom, most commonly fatigue (21%), chemosensory changes
(14%) or breath difficulty (9%).
Conclusions: More than one symptom typically occurred at disease onset. Chemosensory
changes and cough persisted after negative RT-PCR in a quarter of the patients. Almost half
of the patients reported at least one unresolved symptom at six-months follow up, mainly
fatigue, smell changes and breath difficulty. Our findings highlight the prevalence of longlasting
effects of COVID-19.

BACKGROUND
The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become a worldwide pandemic, with more than 37
million cases and over a million deaths (World Health Organization, October 12th, 2020).
COVID-19 symptoms, severity and duration vary widely[1–4]. Researchers and patient groups
are urging clinicians and scientists to use the term “long COVID” and to listen to patients
voices[5].
COVID-19 initially targets the human respiratory system, with the most common symptoms
according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) being fever, cough,
shortness of breath, fatigue, muscle aches, headache, new loss of smell or taste, sore throat,
congestion, nausea/vomiting and diarrhea. Other commonly reported symptoms also include
sputum production, hemoptysis and lack of appetite[6,7]. The symptoms order of
appearance, severity, durations and persistence after recovery, is only partly studied[8–10]
and is the focus of our study here.

METHODS
Aim and setting
This is a follow-up study of patients that participated in our previous study, see Karni and Klein
et al.[11], performed in Israel, from April 2020 to October 2020. The study comprised of Israeli
residents aged ≥18 years with positive COVID-19 RT-PCR results, who were recruited via social
media (Twitter and Facebook) and word of mouth for phone interviews. We excluded severely
ill patients, and non-Israeli residents. Participants were not screened or targeted for
experiencing chemosensory changes. Informed consent was obtained from all participants.
The study was approved by the Hadassah Medical Center Helsinki Committee (permit number

0236-20-HMO). Upon agreement to participate, the explanation of the interview, including
questions on taste and smell, were read to the participants.

General design
The questionnaire was developed in parallel with the Global Consortium for Chemosensory
Research, GCCR[12]. The questionnaire[11] had five parts: 1) General information (e.g., age,
gender); 2) Medical history (e.g., medical conditions, chronic medications use); 3) Current
illness (e.g., 23 physical signs and symptoms, RT-PCR swab test results and dates, subjective
recovery feeling); 4 and 5) Smell and taste: Participants were instructed to rate their sense of
smell/taste before, during and after their illness, on a scale from 1-10 (1 corresponding to “no
sense of smell” and 10 to excellent sense of smell). Data was kept in Compusense Cloud online software (Compusense Inc., Guelph, ON, Canada).

Patients follow-up
COVID-19 positive patients from our previous Karni and Klein et al. study[11], were followed
here to monitor the progress of their illness and recovery. Out of 144 RT-PCR-positive
patients, 114 had answered the phone, of which two had missing information regarding rating
of chemosensory symptoms, resulting in 112 patients answering the first questionnaire.
Recovered patients' category refers to those who had recuperated from all their symptoms
and received two consecutive negative RT-PCR test results, with one or more days apart.
Patients who either did not recover from their symptoms in the first questionnaire, or did not
get two consecutive negative RT-PCR results at the time of answering the first questionnaire,
were contacted 3 weeks after the initial interview, for their second interview (n=101). If they
had not fully recovered at their first follow-up, they were contacted again 3 weeks after their

second interview, for their third interview (n=46). Additionally, all patients were contacted
again approximately six months after their fourth interview (n=105, 7 patients did not answer
the phone).Data from these four interviews was analyzed for symptoms characteristics:
onset, duration, persistence post recovery and severity.

Data analysis
The participants were asked about 27 symptoms (see web-only Supplementary Figure S1). 7
symptoms occurred in more than 50% of the patients (taste change, smell change, fever, dry
cough, muscle aches, headache, lack of appetite) and were therefore included in the analysis.
All but lack of appetite are official CDC symptoms as of October 2020. 7 additional official CDC
symptoms were included as well: productive cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, sore throat,
congestion, nausea/vomiting, and diarrhea. “Fatigue” did not explicitly appear in the
questionnaire but was self-reported in 18% of patients under "any other symptoms" and was
therefore included in the final analysis.
Disease onset is defined as the first appearance of any of the COVID-19 symptoms listed
above.
"Number of days after disease onset" was the date of symptoms' appearance minus the date
of the first symptom to occur. Mean ± SD number of days since illness started was then
calculated for each symptom.
Persistent symptoms are defined as symptoms that persist after the patient's recovery as
described above.
Unresolved symptoms refer to those that were unresolved at the six-months follow-up. Order
of appearance were calculated from the onset dates reported by the participants for each
symptom. Duration was calculated from the onset and resolution date of each symptom. In

case patients reported unresolved symptoms or could not report a precise resolution date
between the 6-weeks follow-up to the six-months follow-up, their symptoms' duration was
censored at 60 days, the longest reported duration by the 6-weeks follow-up. This resulted in
10% of the data being censored.
Maximal severity of smell (taste) change was calculated as the difference between the rating
of the respective sense level before the illness and its rating during the illness, rated on a 110 scale.

Statistical analysis
Analyses were conducted using the statistical software R (https://www.r-project.org/).
Descriptive statistics are presented as the mean and standard deviation.
Correlations were measured using Pearson correlation coefficients, and p-values are based
on correlation t-tests. A level of P<0.05 was used to determine statistical significance. P-values
for the pair-wise comparisons between symptom durations were calculated using a two-sided
Wilcoxon rank-sum test, and adjusted for multiplicity using the BH procedure[13]. A level of
P<0.05 for the adjusted p-values was used to determine statistical significance.

RESULTS:
Patients' characteristics
Completed questionnaires were obtained from 112 COVID-19 positive patients. The median
age of the respondents was 35 ± 12 years (mean ± SD), 72 men. 6 patients were hospitalized
(received respiratory support during their hospitalization and / or were hospitalized in the
intensive care unit) and the remaining 106 were classified as ambulatory patients.

Order of symptoms' appearance
Symptoms usually appeared concomitantly: The first and second symptoms to appear were
accompanied by additional symptoms in 69% and 45% of the patients, respectively.
Headache, fever, dry cough, and muscle aches were the first to appear in over a third of
patients, at 2.0 ± 5.0, 1.8 ± 4.6, 1.4 ± 3.4 and 2.1 ± 5.1 days (mean ± SD), respectively, after
disease onset. Smell and taste changes appeared later, at 3.9 ± 5.5 and 4.6 ± 5.7 days (mean
± SD), respectively, after disease onset (Figure 1B) and were the first symptoms in only 15%
and 18% of patients. Fatigue was a first symptom in 14% of patients and was the first symptom
in the majority of patients (80%) in which it occurred (Figure 1A). Each of the 14 symptoms
analyzed here could occur as first or co-first. Vomiting, breathing difficulty and diarrhea were
the most spread out in the order in which they appear (see web-only Supplementary Figure
S2).
Vomiting and diarrhea appeared after the highest number of days since disease onset (5.6 ±
8.3 and 5.9 ± 10.0, respectively) (Figure 1B).

Distribution of symptoms durations and persistence
Figure 2 depicts the durations of the most prevalent symptoms (>50%) among 112 COVID-19
patients. Fever had shorter duration than all other symptoms (5.8 ± 8.6 (mean ± SD)) (P<0.05).
Muscle aches, lack of appetite and headache (6.9 ± 8.1, 7.8 ± 6.9 and 7.8 ± 8.5 (mean ± SD))
had shorter mean of censored durations than those of dry cough and changes of taste and
smell (14.8 ± 14.6, 17.2 ± 17.6 and 18.9 ± 19.7 (mean ± SD)) (P<0.05). In these patients, the
most prolonged symptom was breath difficulty, in some unresolved even after 213 days.

Patients with smell change, taste change, and dry or productive cough still had these
symptoms post recovery (41%, 35%, 28%, respectively, equivalent to 29%, 26% and 20% of all
patients) (Figure 2). Persistent taste change within 6-weeks was usually accompanied by a
persistent smell change in the same patient, and in some cases also accompanied by a
persistent cough (productive or dry). In 14% of the patients with cough, it persisted without
persistent chemosensory change (Figure 3A).

At six-months follow-ups, 51 patients (46%) still reported unresolved symptoms, mainly

difficulty, memory disorders and hair loss, were not typically reported during the 6-weeks
follow-ups (thus “new symptoms”), while other symptoms such as muscle aches, headache
and chemosensory changes usually carried over from previous interviews (Figure 3C). For
additional symptoms at six-months follow-up, see web-only Supplementary Table S1).

Of the 23 patients that had not fully recovered during 6-weeks of follow-ups, 17 reported
smell changes. 11 of these patients still reported smell changes at six-months. 4 patients who
reported they recovered from their smell change at the 6-weeks follow-up, stated at the sixmonths follow-up that their sense of smell continued fluctuating and remained unresolved.
Patients who experienced chemosensory changes at six-months follow-up had either smell
changes only (n=8), or smell and taste changes (n=7). Seven patients reported distorted sense
of smell.

Smell change severity and recovery
The durations of changes in smell and taste reported at the 6-weeks follow-up, were highly
correlated (0.82, p<0.001) (Figure 4A).
As seen in Figure 4B, a weak yet significant correlation was found between smell change
severity and its duration (correlation 0.34, p=0.003). However, there was no correlation
between taste change severity and duration (see web-only Supplementary Figure S3).
Moreover, it is apparent that some patients' smell change had recovered independently of
how severe it was, while for another group of patients, it was closely dependent on its severity
(Figure 4B). No special characteristics of subpopulations could be identified.
Chemosensory recovery patterns indicate full recovery in some patients and a slower and
gradual recovery of the senses in others (see web-only Supplementary Figure S4).

DISCUSSION
Smell and taste changes had emerged as distinctive COVID-19 symptoms[11,14]. Additional
symptoms are emerging for long haulers[5].
Our study reveals that smell and taste were the first symptoms to appear, in 15% and 18% of
cases, respectively, either with or without other symptoms. Spinato et al.[15] had found that
the onset of smell or taste changes was prior to other symptoms in 11.9% of cases and
concomitant with other symptoms in 22.8% of cases. Our slightly lower prevalence as first
symptoms, could be due to recall bias caused by retrospective data collection.
We found the means of censored durations of taste change to be 17.2 ± 17.6 days and of
smell change to be 18.9 ± 19.7 days (mean ± SD), and their post-recovery persistence to be
prevalent in 35% and 41% of patients (usually by the same patient). Additionally, cough, either

dry or productive, was also found to persist in approximately 27% of patients who reported
experiencing this symptom.
Different reports found that the time for chemosensory recovery is ranging from 8 ± 6.4 to
11.6 ± 6.2 days (mean ± SD)[16,17], others found their persistence post recovery in the range
of 20% to 78% of patients[10,18]. The higher numbers in these studies could be due to smaller
samples or different patients' recruitment.
Our long (up to six-months) follow-up enabled to capture longer duration of chemosensory
changes than those reported by others[16,17,19]. Moreover, our detailed phone interviews
provide reliable data which is not readily available in online studies.
Importantly, we monitored quantitative recovery back to normal levels, possibly accounting
for the longer recovery rate we found for the chemosensory changes and higher persistence
post-recovery than when binary classification was used[19].
We found smell (but not taste) change severity to be correlated with its time to recover.
However, while for a group of the patients, the time necessary for their smell change recovery
correlated with magnitude of the change they had experienced, for another group, the
severity of their smell change was unrelated to the time it took to recover. Such grouping was
also reported by Gerkin et al.[14], but characteristics that might account for the differences
between these two groups could not yet be unraveled and require further exploration with
large groups of patients.
Concerning other COVID-19 symptoms, we found that even though their order of appearance
is varied, headache, fever, dry cough, and muscle aches were often (38% -43%) the first
symptoms to appear. Additionally, out of the 18% patients who experienced fatigue, 80% had
experienced it as a first symptom (14% of all patients). Of note, the prevalence of fatigue in
our study was lower than previously reported 36%-46%[20,21], probably because here it was

not explicitly part of the questionnaire, but rather self-reported under the "any other
symptom" question.
Overall, 51 patients had not fully recovered from their symptoms six months after their first
questionnaire, with most of them reporting unresolved fatigue, chemosensory changes, and
breath difficulty. These unresolved symptoms can occur together or separately, and some of
them were not reported during the initial 6-weeks follow-up.
Study limitations
Our sample did not include severely ill patients, and therefore is relevant for light to
moderately ill patients only. No objective testing was performed, and the information was
self-reported by the participants. Additionally, the retrospective data collection method used
in this study may have caused recall bias.
Patients were contacted for the second and third interviews only if they have not reported
recovery. In principle, it is possible that some of the recovered patients could have
recurrences of symptoms as well[22]. Therefore, for the six-months follow-up we recontacted
all study participants for reports of unresolved symptoms. Long period studies of larger
groups of COVID-19 patients, with more follow-ups are needed to further monitor and
characterize manifestations of “long COVID”[23].

Conclusions
We carefully mapped the start and end dates of various COVID-19 symptoms of 112 mild
patients in Israel. The results indicate that despite large variability in symptoms onset and
duration, some symptoms (headache, fever, dry cough, and muscle aches) are common as
first or co-first symptoms. Fatigue, if occurs, usually appears as a first symptom. Taste and
smell changes are not typically first, and appear on average, 3.9 ± 5.4 and 4.6 ± 5.7 days (mean

± SD), respectively, after disease onset. Their recovery can be either fast, or longer and
gradual, sometimes accompanied by cough. Interestingly, while dry cough appears early (1.4
± 3.4 days (mean ± SD)) and productive cough later (4.5 ± 7.1 days (mean ± SD)), both types
of cough may persist post recovery. At six-months follow-up, 46% of patients experienced
unresolved symptoms, with symptoms either continuing throughout the illness (e.g.,
chemosensory changes), or appearing as new (e.g., memory disorders).
This information regarding their symptoms' durations and persistence post recovery, paves
the way to further long COVID studies and advances towards better understanding and
management of the disease.
