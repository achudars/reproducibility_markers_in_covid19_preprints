Abstract
Introduction The new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a challenge for clinical
decision-making and the effective allocation of healthcare resources. An accurate
prognostic assessment is necessary to improve survival of patients, especially in
developing countries. This study proposes to predict the risk of developing critical
conditions in COVID-19 patients by training multipurpose algorithms.
Methods A total of 1,040 patients with a positive RT-PCR diagnosis for COVID19 from a large hospital from São Paulo, Brazil, were followed from March to
June 2020, of which 288 (28%) presented a severe prognosis, i.e. Intensive Care
Unit (ICU) admission, use of mechanical ventilation or death. Routinely-collected
laboratory, clinical and demographic data was used to train five machine learning
algorithms (artificial neural networks, extra trees, random forests, catboost, and
extreme gradient boosting). A random sample of 70% of patients was used to
train the algorithms and 30% were left for performance assessment, simulating
new unseen data. In order to assess if the algorithms could capture general
severe prognostic patterns, each model was trained by combining two out of
three outcomes to predict the other.
Results All algorithms presented very high predictive performance (average
AUROC of 0.92, sensitivity of 0.92, and specificity of 0.82). The three most
important variables for the multipurpose algorithms were ratio of lymphocyte per
C-reactive protein, C-reactive protein and Braden Scale.
Conclusion The results highlight the possibility that machine learning algorithms
are able to predict unspecific negative COVID-19 outcomes from routinelycollected data.

Introduction
The COVID-19 epidemic that first appeared in Wuhan, China, has rapidly spread
worldwide and still continues to affect most countries, through late initial infections1,2 and
second waves3,4. Currently, there have been more than 14 million cases and five
hundred and ninety thousand confirmed deaths5. In critical patients, the disease has
been shown to rapidly worsen a few days after infection 6,7 requiring immediate clinical
decisions, especially in developing countries with limited resources 8,9. An accurate
COVID-19 prognosis assessment is crucial for screening and treatment procedures and
may increase patient survival10,11.
The consequences of COVID-19 have been disastrous for health systems in
middle and low-income countries (LMICs) 12, especially in Brazil13. The lack of
established knowledge about the disease has made it difficult to identify risk criteria to
support clinical conducts and to allocate human and physical resources in health
facilities and hospitals14. Currently, many Brazilian cities are at their saturation capacity
for the provision of clinical care, especially regarding ICU beds and mechanical
ventilators15,16.
Previous studies have used blood tests17, CT images18,19, sociodemographic and
comorbidities history20 to develop COVID-19 diagnostic and prognostic models, including
machine learning techniques21-23. Biomarkers from blood tests have emerged as
important variables for poor prognostic factors24, which are a promising tool in poorer
regions, due to its low cost and inclusion in standard protocols for clinical care. However,
the majority of studies25 rely on algorithms trained on a single prognostic outcome, which
in theory require the training of specific algorithms for each distinct negative outcome.
This study proposes to develop multipurpose machine learning algorithms to
analyze if it is possible to predict overall poor prognosis for COVID-19 patients. We aim
to test if the algorithms can generalize risk patterns for severe conditions, so they can be

used as tools to assist in the prognosis of distinct negative outcomes for COVID-19
patients.

Methods
Data Source
A cohort of 3,280 patients with a RT-PCR diagnostic exam for COVID-19 from a
large hospital chain in the city of São Paulo (BP- A Beneficência Portuguesa de São
Paulo) were followed between March 1, 2020, and 28 June, 2020. Of these, 1,040
(31.7%) patients were positive for COVID-19 and were included in the analysis. The
study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of BP - A Beneficência
Portuguesa de São Paulo (CAAE:31177220.4.3001.5421), including a waiver of
informed consent. The study followed the guidelines of the transparent reporting of a
multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis (TRIPOD). 26
Individual patient data was collected from electronic medical records. We
included as predictors only variables collected in early hospital admission, i.e. within 24
hours before and 24 hours after the RT-PCR exam. A total of 57 routinely-collected
variables were used for the development of the predictive models, including
demographic data, laboratory tests and vital signs (the complete list is described in
Supplementary Table 1). Figure 1 illustrates the overall process.

Machine learning techniques
Five of the most popular machine learning models for structured data (artificial
neural networks27, extra trees28, random forests29, catboost30, and extreme gradient
boosting31) were trained with 70% of the data, and tested in the other 30%, simulating
new unknown data. All the results reported in this study are from the test set. K-fold
cross-validation with 10 folds was used to adjust the hyperparameters with Bayesian
optimization (HyperOpt). Due to the unbalanced nature of the outcomes, random
undersampling was performed in the training set, by randomly selecting examples from
the majority class for exclusion. This technique was implemented using the
RandomUnderSampler imbalanced-learn class32.
Variables with more than two categories were represented by a set of dummy
variables, with one variable for each category. Continuous variables were standardized
using the z-score. Variables with a correlation greater than 0.90 (mean arterial pressure,

the median. To assess the performance of the models, measures such as accuracy,
sensitivity (also known as recall), specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) (also known
as precision), negative predictive value (NPV), and F1 score were analyzed. The value
of the AUROC was used to select the best model.
To understand the individual contribution of each variable to the predictive
models, we calculated their respective Shapley values. All the analyzes were performed
using the Python programming language with the scikit-learn library.

Algorithms performance
We analyzed the predictive performance of the algorithms for three negative
prognostic outcomes: ICU admission (n=263, 25.5%), mechanical ventilation (MV)
intubation (n=106, 10.2%) and death (n=92, 9.4%). We first tested the predictive
performance of the machine learning algorithms for a specific individual outcome (e.g.
death). We then used the other two outcomes (in this specific example, mechanical
ventilation and ICU admission) to train another model, and then tested this model
performance to predict the previous outcome (death). We then compared the
performance of the two strategies using the 95% confidence interval of the area under
the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC).

Table 2 shows the results of the models trained with the aggregated outcomes
and the models with a single outcome. Every model, even the ones trained with different
outcomes, presented high predictive performance, always with an AUROC over 0.91 in
the test set. The individual models were overall better, but the difference between the
aggregated and individual models were all within the 95% confidence intervals.
Supplementary Figure 1 shows the AUROC for each model. The sensitivity and
specificity of the machine learning algorithms were also very high, in most cases over
0.8, with an average sensitivity of 0.92 and specificity of 0.82. In Supplementary Table 2
we present the final hyperparameters for each model.

The Braden score played an important role in the aggregated outcome
algorithms, ranking as the most important predictor in two of three models. Also, the Creactive protein and ratio of lymphocytes per C-reactive protein proved to be good
predictors, appearing in the top 5 in all three models. Urea, age, creatinine, and arterial
lactate were important for only one of the aggregated models.

Discussion
We found that machine learning algorithms were able to predict with high overall
performance negative prognostic outcomes for COVID-19, even when the specific
outcome was not included in the training of the algorithms. All models presented an
AUROC higher than 0.91 (average of 0.92) in the test set, with high sensitivity and
specificity (average of 0.92 and 0.82, respectively). The results highlight the possibility
that high-performance machine learning algorithms are able to predict unspecific
negative COVID-19 outcomes using routinely-collected data.
Brazil is currently the second country in the world in total number of cases and
deaths from COVID-1933. There is a growing demand in Brazil, and in many other
developing countries, for decision support in the allocation of scarce hospital resources,
especially in relation to the availability of ICU beds and mechanical ventilators 34,35. From
a clinical standard, knowledge about immediate risks of negative prognosis can also
contribute to the early start of preventive measures and new interventions, and thereby
increase patient survival10,11.
The results of this study highlight that it is possible to predict with high
performance the risk of a negative prognosis in patients with COVID-19. Additionally, we
found that it is also possible to predict the risk of negative outcomes well even when they
were not used for training of the model. This result is promising for the prediction of
specific outcomes that are not possible to be collected for model training, either due to

technical difficulties in registering the presence of these outcomes, or in the case of
predicting a new negative outcome previously unknown.
The development of multipurpose prognostic algorithms, i.e. algorithms that
identify nonspecific outcomes and overall future clinical deterioration, can be used in a
large number of situations, especially in the case of complex and unknown diseases that
lead to the development of several different negative outcomes. Instead of having to
develop a different algorithm for each of the specific outcomes, multipurpose models can
provide more comprehensive and clinically relevant information about the risks of future
health problems of patients.
For every outcome, variable importance analysis identified that age, C-reactive
protein (CRP), creatinine, urea and the Braden Scale were usually among the most
important. While the age of the patient is widely found to be an important predictor for
most negative health outcomes, CRP has been increasingly included among the main
inflammatory biomarkers for the prognosis of cardiovascular36 and respiratory
diseases37. High levels of CRP have been also previously associated with individual
severity of SARS-CoV-238,39. Interestingly, previous studies have also identified that
chronic kidney disease is associated with developing severe conditions in COVID-19
patients40-42, where it has been observed that patients with higher levels of creatinine
and urea are more at risk43. The Braden Scale is often used as a predictor for pressure
ulcers, a common clinical classification scale for predicting pneumonia44 during clinical
reception, and in this study, it was an important predictor for negative prognosis in
COVID-19 patients. The scale has a score between 1 (worst score) and 4 (best score)
where the factors included are sensory perception, skin moisture, activity, mobility,
nutritional status and friction45. The percentage of lymphocytes in the blood has been
described as a strong predictor of prognosis for the severity of the new coronavirus. The
randomized study by Lin Tan et al.46 suggests that, in most confirmed cases, the

percentage of lymphocytes was reduced to 5% in two weeks after the onset of COVID19, in line with other studies findings47.

The study has a few limitations that need to be mentioned. First, some of the
outcomes overlap which may have helped the performance of the aggregated models,
even though in the majority of cases the outcomes were independent. In the case of ICU
admission, 55% of the patients did not die or used MV, while in the case of MV and
death, 63% and 70% of their respective aggregated model was trained on other
outcomes. Ideally, the outcomes would never overlap, but this is clinically unfeasible
given the interlaced nature of negative prognostic outcomes. Another limitation is that we
analyzed data from an urban COVID-19 hotspot in Brazil, in a period where clinical
protocols for the disease were still being established, so this could affect the incidence of
prognostic outcomes and may not directly generalize to other periods.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we found that machine learning algorithms can predict severe
outcomes in COVID-19 patients with high performance, including previously unobserved
outcomes, using only routinely-collected laboratory, clinical and demographic data. The
use of multipurpose algorithms for the prediction of overall negative prognosis is a
promising new area that can support doctors with clinical and administrative decisions,
especially regarding priorities for hospital admission and monitoring.
