Abstract
Purpose: The rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has prompted researchers from all over
the world to share their experience. The results were numerous reports with variable quality.
The latter has provided an impetus to examine all published meta-analyses and systematic
reviews on COVID-19 to date to examine available evidence. Methods: Using predefined
selection criteria, a literature search identified 43 eligible meta-analyses and/or systematic
reviews. Results: Most (N=17) studies addressed clinical manifestations and associated
comorbidity, 6 studies addressed clinical manifestations in pregnant women and younger
individuals, 8 studies addressed diagnostic data, 9 studies addressed various interventions, and
9 studies addressed prevention and control. The number of studies included in the various
systemic reviews and meta-analyses ranged from 2 to 89. While there were some similarities
and consistency for some findings, e.g. the relation between comorbidities and disease severity,
we also noted occasionally conflicting data. Conclusion: As more data are collected from
patients infected with COVID-19 all over the world, more studies will undoubtedly be published
and attention to scientific accuracy in the performance of trials must be exercised to inform
clinical decision-making and treatment guidelines.

Introduction
In December 2019, an outbreak of a new infectious disease in Wuhan in the Hubei Province of
China was announced (1). Little did we know; this disease would change the world. The disease
was caused by a beta-coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2), and the disease was recently named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). On
March 11, 2020, when there were around 120,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases in over 10
countries, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. As of 30 April 2020,
3,250,267 cases have been reported across 185 countries, resulting in 234,701 deaths, and
1,052,550 people have recovered (2).
The rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, its alarming severity and mortality, and the
resultant detrimental impact on world economy and social and financial needs of millions of
people across the globe, have prompted researchers and clinicians from all over the world to
share their experience. For better or for worse, a mass of scientific research has been
published, as COVID-19 has created the need for fast dissemination of information about the
pandemic. Published and preprint manuscripts are shared widely via news and social media
outlets, allowing the experiences to be shared across the globe. Nevertheless, there has been
recent concern about the quality of COVID-19 research, and how rigorous the peer review
processes were in this era of rapid dissemination (3, 4). While the experiences should be shared
rapidly and broadly since this is a novel disease process, care must be taken to distinguish
between anecdotal experiences and data from randomized controlled trials- the standard clinical
trials based on which treatment guidelines are usually created.
In this review, we examined all published meta-analyses and systematic reviews about COVID19 to date. While we did not intent to evaluate the quality of published studies, we planned to
thoroughly examine the data provided and we attempted to compare studies that addressed
similar research questions to establish consistency or discrepancy between reports.

Methods
Search strategy

Between January 1st, 2020 and April 30th, 2019, we identified eligible studies using electronic
literature search of the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. We
used Medical Subject Heading terms or keywords using a combination of the following search
terms: “2019 novel coronavirus,” OR “COVID‐19,” OR “Coronavirus,” OR “SARS‐CoV‐2,” OR
“Chinese Coronavirus”. The search terms were combined with the publication types “systematic
review,” OR “meta-analysis”. Following screening of retrieved records for the relevant titles, the
relevant abstracts were reviewed, subsequently, the full text articles were obtained to
determine appropriateness for final inclusion.
Selection criteria

We included all studies that met the following criteria: (1) published in English language
between January 1st, 2020 and April 30th, 2020; (2) only published as systematic review, or
meta-analysis, or both; (3) examining any of the following: clinical features, diagnosis,
associated comorbidity, treatment and intervention, or prevention and control of COVID-19.
Studies that addressed any combination of those features were also considered eligible; and (4)
including relevant data for any age, gender, race, or a specific risk group. We also intended to
include duplicate articles if they provided additional relevant data.
Data extraction

All authors reviewed the full text of potential articles and discussed the data intended for
extraction and decisions were documented. Extracted data included the following fields: first
author last name, the purpose of the study, the type of the study being a systematic review; a
meta-analysis; or both, number of included articles, number of included patients, pertinent
cross references, and the relevant findings.

Results
We identified 7,330 potentially relevant articles. After exclusion of duplicate references, nonrelevant literature, and those that did not satisfy the inclusion criteria, 43 systematic
reviews/meta-analyses were included (5-47).

Table 1 depicts the summary of the 43 included systematic reviews/meta-analyses. Most

(N=17) studies addressed clinical manifestations and associated comorbidity, 6 studies
addressed clinical manifestations in pregnant women and younger individuals, 8 studies
addressed diagnostic data, 9 studies addressed various interventions, and 9 studies addressed
prevention and control. Several studies were designed to report on more than one aspect. The
number of studies included in the various systemic reviews and meta-analyses ranged from 2 to
89 and some systemic reviews and meta-analyses included no COVID trials.
In Table 2 highlights the most significant findings derived from each systematic review/metaanalysis classified according to the research objective(s).

Table 2 highlights the most significant findings derived from each systematic review/meta-

analysis classified according to the research objective(s). The systematic reviews/meta-analyses
we reviewed included studies with occasionally disparate outcomes. The systematic review by
Vardavas et al (6) included studies that demonstrated no relationship between COVID-19
infection severity and smoking and others that did. Three systematic reviews/meta-analyses
reported patients were predominantly middle-aged men (10) (19) (40), and 2 systematic
reviews/meta-analyses reported the prevalence of hypertension and diabetes to be around 16%
and 8%, respectively (17) (20). Fever (>80%) and cough (~60%) were the most common
symptoms in 2 systemic reviews and meta-analyses (10) (19) (40). Hypertension and diabetes
were reported to be associated with more severe disease in several systematic reviews/metaanalyses and ARDS was reported as complication in 9.4% to ~30% of COVID-19 infections.
COVID-19 mortality varied anywhere from 3.2 to 14% (10) (20) (39). In pregnant women with
COVID-19 infection, the caesarean section rate was >80% and 2 systematic reviews/metaanalyses showed no vertical transmission. Children with COVID-19 presented with mild to
moderate symptoms and 2 systematic reviews/meta-analyses reported no deaths in children
aged 0 to 9 years (Table 2).

The most frequent chest CT findings were GGO and bilateral infiltrates in several systematic
reviews/meta-analyses and 1 meta-analysis showed increased procalcitonin concentrations were
associated with higher risk for severe COVID-19 infections (23). With regards to medication
interventions, 3 systematic reviews/meta-analyses reported no benefit for using antiviral drugs
(15) (29) (35). One systematic review concluded neither benefit or harm with use on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and that interleukin-1 and -6 have no modulatory effects on
the course of COVID-19 infections (12). Systematic reviews/meta-analyses on the effects of
chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine showed varying results. One systematic review noted
superior symptom control and improvement in radiographic imaging in one study and superior
virological clearance compared to control in another study (13). Another systematic
review/meta-analysis also showed reduction in radiologic progression of disease, but no
significant benefit regarding virological cure or mortality reduction (24) (Table 2).
Systematic reviews/meta-analyses on prevention and control of COVID-19 provided occasionally
conflicting results as well. For example, one review concluded that school closures did not
contribute to control of SARS and modeling for COVID-19 predicted school closures would only
prevent 2-4% disease mortality (45); while another review that combined COVID-19 and nonCOVID-19 studies reported that quarantine combined with school closures and other measures
was effective (5). One systematic review/meta-analysis examining medical masks vs N95
respirators for preventing COVID-19 in healthcare workers did not include any COVID-19
studies (26).

Discussion
Of the 7850 potentially relevant articles, 43 systematic reviews/meta-analyses met our
inclusion/exclusion criteria were included (Figure 1). The various studies included addressed
clinical manifestations and associated comorbidity, clinical manifestations in pregnant women
and younger individuals, diagnostic data, various interventions, and prevention and control of
COVID-19. As noted, we did not intent to evaluate the quality of published studies but noted
occasionally conflicting data, large ranges for COVID-19 associated acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS) and mortality estimates, systematic reviews/meta-analyses that included nonCOVID-19 trials, similarities for comorbidities increasing disease severity such as diabetes and
hypertension, and predominance of middle-aged male patients with COVID-19 infections.
Following the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan in the Hubei Province of China in December
2019 (1) and the subsequent declaration by the WHO of a pandemic that has caused alarming
mortality and disruption of the world economy affecting several millions of people worldwide,
there was need for rapid dissemination of information regarding this novel infection as more
clinicians and scientists dealt with the reality of COVID-19. Technology and social media played
a large part in the sharing of clinical information and experiences with disease managementChinese clinicians communicated their experiences with European and American clinicians via
virtual conferences, for example, because the virus had affected their community first. The
information disseminated this way was based on clinical experiences and the patients seen in
their hospitals who may differ in comorbidities from patients seen in Europe and North America,
however, the dissemination of information was critical to guide clinicians.
We also witnessed a flood of published manuscripts in several journals, including highly
impactful ones. Some published studies included small numbers of patients and it is likely the
studies were published to share as much information as possible given the devastating effects
of COVID-19 on millions globally. As more patients became ill with COVID-19, as hospitals
became overwhelmed with sick patients with various ranges of disease severity and ran out of
beds and ventilators, as personal protective equipment was challenging to secure in some
countries, as various medications were attempted for prophylactic use and treatment, as
financial institutions suffered major loses, as weaknesses in healthcare systems were exposed,

and most important, as millions of lives were lost, the internet served as an integral space to
share both accurate and inaccurate information; including published and retracted studies.
There were common clinical manifestations and comorbidities in the systematic reviews/metaanalyses we included. Notably, patients were predominantly middle-aged men and
comorbidities such a diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and smoking were
prevalent and associated with more severe disease. The most common clinical manifestations
were fever, cough, and dyspnea. Rates of ARDS and mortality varied between studies. In
pregnant women with COVID-19 infection, the caesarean section rate was >80% and children
with COVID-19 presented with mild to moderate symptoms and no deaths were reported in
children aged 0 to 9 years (Table 2). The most frequent chest CT findings were GGO and
bilateral infiltrates. With regards to medication interventions, no benefit for using antiviral drugs
was found, no benefit or harm with use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs was found,
and no benefit with interleukin-1 and -6 was found. Radiographic improvement and better
symptom control were reported with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. Finally, quarantining,
social distancing, and school closures may contribute to reduction of disease spread and may be
more effective if used in combination (Table 2).
The ability to rapidly disseminate information via the rapid review process some journals
implemented is a double-edged sword. It remains of utmost important to maintain the integrity
of published science while keeping in mind the devastation this COVID-19 has caused and the
desperate need for a cure, medications that will lessen disease severity, and/or a vaccine.
Additionally, care must be taken to distinguish between anecdotal experiences and data from
randomized controlled trials- the standard clinical trials based on which treatment guidelines are
usually created.
As more data is collected from patients infected with COVID-19 all over the world, more studies
undoubtedly will be published. As clinicians, scientists, and members of society, we will look
forward to the sharing of information. Scientists, reviewers, editors, and journals alike must
work to maintain the integrity of the science shared. The internet, social media, the ability to
hold virtual conferences across the globe, and the yearning to find a cure will promote

we live, but also encourage the use of non-conventional methods to share science.

Main findings

Clinical manifestations and comorbidity

19

Vardavas, et al. (6)

Three of the included studies involved small number of patients (41, 140, and 190), and they showed no significant relation
between smoking and COVID-19 infection severity. The largest study (1099 patients), showed that smokers were 1.4-fold
more likely to have severe symptoms, and have 2.4-fold increase of requiring admission to intensive care unit (ICU);
needed mechanical ventilation; or die as compared with non-smokers (48).

Cheung et al. (9)

The authors estimated a pooled prevalence of 18% of gastrointestinal tract symptoms among patients. Symptoms also
occurred among those with mild COVID-19 illness (12%).

Rodriguez-Morales
(10)

Patients median age was 52 years, and they were predominantly male (56%). 37% of patients had associated comorbidity.
The most prevalent clinical manifestations were fever (88.7%), cough (57.6%), and dyspnea (45.6%). 20% of patients
required ICU admission. Of the estimated complications, 33%, 13%, 8%, and 6% developed acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS), cardiac insult, acute kidney injury, and shock, respectively. The mortality rate among hospitalized
patients was 14%.

Asadi-Pooya et al.
(11)

Two studies that had the largest number of patients (214 and 221 patients, respectively), reported an overall prevalence of
central nervous system manifestations of 25%, with dizziness (17%) and headache (13%), were the most common
symotoms. The authors acknowledged the limitation of available data.

Emami et al. (17)

The pooled prevalence of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, smoking, and diabetes among patients were estimated as
16%, 12%, 8%, and 8%, respectively.

Park et. al. (18)

In an extensive epidemiologic systematic review, the authors estimated that the epidemics takes 3-7 days to double in size.
The analysis also showed that the incubation period varies between 4 to 6 days, while the serial interval was estimated to
be 4-8 days. The basic reproduction number ranging from 1.9 to 6.5. At the time of the publication, the authors
acknowledged that the true case fatality risk was not yet known, however, their model has estimated a mortality rate of
0.3% to 1.4%.

Lovato et al. (19)

In that systemic review, male represented 57.5% and the mean age was 49 years. Pooled data showed that pharyngodynia
was present in 12% of patients, and nasal congestion in 3.7%. Other constitutional symptoms were fever (86%), cough
(69%), and fatigue (39%).

Hu et al. (20)

The authors reported that the pooled prevalence estimates for fever, cough, fatigue, and dyspnea symptoms were 86%,
66%, 42%, and 21.4%, respectively. The prevalence of diabetes was 7.7% and hypertension was 15.6% and they were
associated with critical cases in 44,5% and 42% of patients, respectively. Underlying malignancy was rare (1.2%). The
reported complications were, ARDS (9.4%), acute cardiac injury (5.8%), acute kidney injury (2.1%). The risks of severity
and mortality ranged from 12.6 to 23.5% and the pooled estimates of severe illness and mortality were 18.0 and 3.2%,
respectively.

Main findings

Zhou et al. (30)

The pooled estimate of the prevalence of thrombocytopenia was approximately 30% (for all the three human coronavirus
diseases combined). For patients with COVID-19, no pooled estimate was reported. However, the prevalence in 3 COVID19 studies were 3%, 5%, and 12%, respectively.

Fu et al. (39)

The most common symptoms were fever (83%), cough (60%), and fatigue (38). The overall estimated proportion of
severe cases and mortality was 26%, and 3.6%, respectively.

Zuin et al. (40)

Patients were predominantly middle aged (mean age 56 years), males (62%). The pooled estimate of the prevalence of
hypertension was 24%. As compared with normotensive patients, those with hypertension demonstrated 3.36- fold
increase in mortality.

Cao et al. (34)

The meta-analysis showed that the most common clinical manifestations were fever (87%), cough (58%), dyspnea (38%),
and fatigue (36%). Additional pooled estimates: ICU admission (29%), ARDS (29%), multiple organ failure (8.5%),
mortality (6.8%).

Pang et al. (35)

The only study that included COVID-19 patients (228 samples) using RT-PCR assay that showed threshold sensitivity of 10
genome equivalents per reaction, with good reproducibility (49). The RT-PCR reaction was more sensitive than the nested
PCR reaction.

Huang et al. (41)

Among patents with COVID-19 infection, diabetes is associated with more increased severity (RR = 2.45, 95% CI; 1.793.35, p<0.001), more disease progression (RR = 3.31, 95% CI; 1.08-10.14, p=0.04), and increased death rate (RR =
2.12, 95% CI; 1.44-3.11, p<0.001).

Wang et al. (42)

The authors found that the presence of hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular
disease, and cerebrovascular disease are associated with an odds ratio (OR) of COVID-19 infection of 2.29, 2.47, 5.97,
2.93, 3.89, respectively. The meta-analysis revealed no correlation between increased risk of COVID-19 and liver disease,
malignancy, or kidney disease.

Santoso et al. (47)

The meta-analysis showed that cardiac injury was associated increased need for ICU admission (RR = 7.94, 95% CI; 1.5141.78, p = 0.01), severer infection (RR = 13.81, 95% CI; 5.52-34.52, p <0.001), and higher mortality (RR = 7.95, 95% CI,
5.12-12.34, p <0.001).

Clinical manifestations in pregnant women and young individuals

20

Di Mascio et al. (16)

Of 41 infected hospitalized pregnant women, preterm birth <37 weeks occurred in 41% of patients, while the rate of
perinatal death was 7%. Cesarean section (CS) rate was 84%. No vertical transmission was reported in the 41 newborns.

Zaigham et al. (22)

Like in non-pregnant women, the most frequent symptoms were fever (68%) and cough (34%). While the most frequent
laboratory abnormalities were lymphocytopenia (59%) with elevated C-reactive protein (70%). ICU admission was required
for 2.8% of women with no maternal mortality. CS rate was 91%. One neonatal death and one intrauterine fetal death
were reported.

Table 2 Cont.
Main findings

Della Gatta et al. (33)

The CS rate among pregnant women infected with COVID-19 was 96%. The authors reported no vertical transmission, but
one still birth and one neonatal death.

Castagnoli et al. (8)

Of the included young population, 42% were younger than 10 year, and 58% were aged between 10 and 19 years. Those
young patients presented with mild symptoms (fever, dry cough, fatigue, and other upper respiratory symptoms, such as
nasal congestion). No deaths were reported in children aged 0 to 9 years, while a single mortality was reported in the age
range of 10 to 19 (50).

Chang et al. (28)

75% of the children had a household contact history. Most patients had mild to moderate symptoms (98%), with only 2
patients (2%) required ICU admission. Fever occurred in 59% of patients and cough in 46%. 26% of patients were
asymptomatic.

Ludvigsson et al. (31)

Of all COVID-19 patients, children represented 1 to 5% of all reported cases. Children present with mild or moderate
symptoms and they may be asymptomatic at diagnosis. The authors acknowledged that the data on laboratory
abnormalities in children were rare. As reported also by Castagnoli et al. (8), no deaths were reported in children aged 0 to
9 years, while a single mortality was reported in the age range of 10 to 19 (50).

Diagnostic studies

21

Cheung et al. (9)

The study showed that stool samples were tested positive for the virus RNA in 48% of patients. Stool samples remained
positive among 70% of patients after clearance of the virus from the respiratory specimens.

Rodriguez-Morales
(10)

The pooled estimates showed the following prevalence: hypoalbuminemia (75%), abnormal liver functions > 50%,
lymphopenia (43%), and raised C-reactive protein (CRP) (58%). Chest images showed bilateral pneumonic infiltrates
(73%), and ground glass opacity (68%).

Salehi et al. (14)

The most common initial CT findings include bilateral, multi-lobar ground-glass opacity (GGO) mainly in the lower lobes and
less frequently within the right middle lobe. Pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, lymphadenopathy, and cavitation are less
common. Follow-up CT in the intermediate stages of the disease shows progressive transformation of GGO into
consolidation and septal thickening. The worst severity of CT findings appears around day 10 after symptom onset.
The imaging signs associated with clinical improvement usually occur after week 2 of the disease course.

Wynants et al. (21)

The included studies were used to develop 3, 18, and 10 models to predict hospital admission due to pneumonia and other
events, diagnosis; and prognosis, respectively. Predictors of COVAID-19 diagnosis included age, body temperature, and
signs and symptoms. While the prognostic predictors of severe infections included age, sex, features derived from CT scan,
CRP, lactic dehydrogenase, and lymphocyte count. Although the performance of those models was acceptable, the authors
of this systematic review concluded that most reports did not include a description of the study population or intended use
of the models, and rarely calibrate the prediction outcomes.

Lippi et al. (23)

The meta-analysis showed that increased procalcitonin values were associated with an almost 5-fold higher risk of
severe COVID-19 infection (OR = 4.76; 95% CI; 2.74–8.29).

Main findings

Bao et al. (32)

Among 2,738, the pooled positive rate of the CT imaging was approximately 90%. The most prevalent radiology findings
were ground glass opacities (GGO) (83%), GGO with consolidation (58%), adjacent pleura thickening (52%), septal
thickening (49%), and air bronchogram (47%). Less commonly were signs of crazy paving pattern (15%), pleural effusion
(6%), bronchiectasis (5%), pericardial effusion (5%), and lymphadenopathy (4%).

Chang et al. (28)

In a children population, the most common radiographic findings were GGO (48%) and patchy consolidation (31%).

Cao et al. (34)

The main CT imaging findings were bilateral pneumonia (76%) and GGO (70%).

FU et al. (39)

The authors reported the pooled estimates of the most common laboratory abnormalities. Raised CRP was prevalent in
67% of patients, while lymphopenia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase were demonstrated with pooled estimates of
58%, and 52%, respectively. GOG (80%), and bilateral pneumonia (73%) were the most frequently reported findings on
CT.

Interventional studies

22

Russell et al. (12)

The review concluded that the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is not associated with either benefit or harm in
patients infected with COVID-19. Furthermore, it was concluded that interlukin-6 or interlukin-1 inhibitors have no
modulatory effect on the course of the infection. No specific studies exist to support a potential beneficial role for cytotoxic
chemotherapy or a contraindication for their use in patients with COVID-19 infection.

Singh et al. (13)

The authors reported on two small human studies that have been conducted with both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine
in COVID-19 and have shown significant improvement in some parameters in patients with COVID-19. In the first study,
the authors quoted a Chinese trial involving more than 100 patients of COVID-19. The study found that, compared with
control group, users of chloroquine had superior symptoms control, slower progression of pneumonia, radiologic images
improvement, and higher rate of seroconversion. In the second non-randomized French study (36 patients), the virological
clearance at day-6 post-inclusion, hydroxychloroquine vs. control was 70.0% versus 12.5%, respectively (p <0.001).

Ford et al. (15)

In one randomized trial, 99 patients with severe COVID-19 disease were randomized to receive the antiviral agents
lopinavir/ritonavir and 100 patients to receive the standard of care for 14 days (51). The antiviral use was not associated
clinical benefit; however, the mortality rate was lower in the treatment arm (14%) vs. that in the control arm (25%), a
difference that was not statistically significant. The second trial (21 lopinavir/ritonavir vs. 16 control), was also negative
(52).

Sarma et al. (24)

The analysis concluded that the use of hydroxychloroquine was associated with 69% reduction in the radiological
progression of lung disease, however, the drug showed no significant benefit concerning virological cure or mortality
reduction.

Yousefifard et. al.(29)

The authors reported the results of the randomized trial that was described earlier (51). Additionally, examining 21 caseseries and case-report studies where antiviral agents were used for COVID-19 infection, the authors concluded that there is
not enough evidence to support a potential benefit for using antiviral drugs.

Main findings

Pang et al. (35)

The authors concluded that there is no available vaccine yet for COVID-19 infection, neither there are effective specific
antivirals nor drug combinations that are supported by high-level evidence.

Shah et al. (36)

Although pre-clinical studies suggested a prophylactic effect of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, at present, there are
no original clinical studies on their prophylactic role against COVID-19.

Yang et al. (38)

In the two studies that involved COVID-19 patients, patients with severe infection were more likely to receive corticosteroid
(RR = 2.36, 95% CI; 1.31–4.28, P = 0.004). In that population, corticosteroid use was not associated with improvement in
mortality rate (RR = 2.56, 95% CI; 0.99–6.63, P = 0.053). Moreover, among SARS-CoV patients, corticosteroid use was
associated with detrimental effects.

Zhang et al. (37)

Extrapolating from studies of other viral infections, the authors suggested that the nutritional status of patients should be
assessed, and patients should receive various vitamins and other elements like iron, zinc, and selenium. The authors also
concluded that COVID-19 patients should receive standard care, coronavirus‐specific treatments, and antiviral treatments.
However, no high-level evidence data were provided.

Studies on prevention and control

Nussbaumer-Streit (5)

The examined models showed a benefit of quarantine measures averted 44% to 81% incidence case with a 31% to 63%
reduction in mortality compared to no measures, Furthermore, combining quarantine with other measures such as school
closures, travel restrictions and social distancing was more effective than individual measures alone.

Romney et al. (7)

The authors reviewed plans on the crisis standards of care for 31 states, and only the plans from 5 states fulfilled the the 5
elements crisis standards of care recommended by the National Academy of Medicine (53). Of those 5 states, only the
plans from two states had all the hazards documents required for public protection and safety.

Song et al. (25)

Based on that systematic review, it is suggested that prolonged moderate aerobic exercise could decrease the risk of
influenza-related infection and it improve individual immune response to viral infection.

Bartoszko et al. (26)

As compared with N95 respirators, using medical masks was no associated with increased risk of respiratory viral infection
among healthcare workers. No data related to COVID-19 infection were reported. Of the four included studies, only one
study reported on the occurrence of non-COVID-19 coronavirus infection (54).

Verbeek et al. (43)

Compared with N95 mask, the use of a powered, air-purifying respirator with coverall provides better protection against
contamination (RR = 0.27, 95% CI; 0.17 to 0.43), however; their use was less convenient and associated with high noncompliance rate (RR = 7.5, 95% CI; 1.81 to 31.1). The authors examined the protective efficacy of several modifications in
the personal protective equipment (PPE) and they showed that the modifications provided significantly better protection as
compared with standard PPE.

Couper et al. (44)

The authors could not demonstrate a relationship between either chest compression or defibrillation with aerosol
generation or transmission of infection. No study describing patients with COVID-19.

Main findings

Viner et al. (45)

Based on data derived from SARS preventive measures, the systematic review concluded that the school closures did not
contribute to the control of the disease. Various modelling studies of COVID-19 predicted that school closures alone would
prevent only 2–4% of disease mortality (55).

Houghton et al. (46)

Among the identified barriers: guidelines are long and ambiguous, guidelines did not reflect international recommendations,
guidelines constantly changing, recommended measures increased workload and fatigue, etc. The review also identified
several facilitators: clear and effective communication, effective training and readiness, provision of sufficient space
(isolation rooms, anterooms, showers, etc.), ensure adequate supply of PPE, emphasize the value and benefit of
adherence, etc.
