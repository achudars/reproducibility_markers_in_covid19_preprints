ABSTRACT

Background: Deaths from COVID-19 have exceeded 1.8 million globally (January
2020). We examined trends in markers of neonatal care before and during the
pandemic at two tertiary neonatal units in Zimbabwe and Malawi.
Methods: We analysed data collected prospectively via the NeoTree app at Sally
Mugabe Central Hospital (SMCH), Zimbabwe, and Kamuzu Central Hospital (KCH),
Malawi. Neonates admitted from 1 June 2019 to 25 September 2020 were included.
We modelled the impact of the first cases of COVID-19 (Zimbabwe: 20 March 2020;
Malawi: 3 April 2020) on number of admissions, gestational age and birth weight,
source of admission referrals, prevalence of neonatal encephalopathy, and overall
mortality.
Findings: The study included 3,450 neonates at SMCH and 3,350 neonates at KCH.
Admission numbers at SMCH did not initially change after the first case of COVID-19
but fell by 48% during a nurses’ strike (Relative risk (RR) 0·52, 95%CI 0·40-0·68, p <
0·002). At KCH, admissions dropped by 42% (RR 0·58; 95%CI 0·48-0·70; p < 0·001)
soon after the first case of COVID-19. At KCH, gestational age and birth weight
decreased slightly (1 week, 300 grams), outside referrals dropped by 28%, and there
was a slight weekly increase in mortality. No changes in these outcomes were found
at SMCH.
Interpretation: The indirect impacts of COVID-19 are context-specific. While this
study provides vital evidence to inform health providers and policy makers, national
data are required to ascertain the true impacts of the pandemic on newborn health.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed for evidence of the indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
on neonatal care in low-income settings using the search terms neonat* or newborn,
and COVID-19 or SARS-CoV 2 or coronavirus, and the Cochrane low and middle
income country (LMIC) filters, with no language limits between 01.10.2019 and
21.11.20. While there has been a decrease in global neonatal mortality rates, the
smaller improvements seen in low-income settings are threatened by the direct and
indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. A modelling study of this threat predicted
between 250000-1.1 million extra neonatal deaths as a result of decreased service
provision and access in LMICs. A webinar and survey of frontline maternal/newborn
healthcare workers in >60 countries reported a decline in both service attendance
and in quality of service across the ante-, peri- and post-natal journey. Reporting fear
of attending services, and difficulty in access, and a decrease in service quality due
to exacerbation of existing service weaknesses, confusion over guidelines and
understaffing. Similar findings were reported in a survey of healthcare workers
providing childhood and maternal vaccines in LMICs. One study to date has reported
data from Nepal describing an increase in stillbirths and neonatal deaths, with
institutional deliveries nearly halved during lockdown.
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, this is the first and only study in Sub-Saharan Africa describing
the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on health service access and outcomes for
newborns in two countries. We analysed data from the digital quality improvement
and data collection tool, the NeoTree, to carry out an interrupted time series analysis
of newborn admission rates, gestational age, birth weight, diagnosis of hypoxic
ischaemic encephalopathy and mortality from two large hospitals in Malawi and
Zimbabwe (n~7000 babies). We found that the indirect impacts of COVID-19 were
context-specific. In Sally Mugabe Central Hospital, Zimbabwe, initial resilience was
demonstrated in that there was no evidence of change in mortality, birth weight or
gestational age. In comparison, at Kamuzu Central Hospital, Malawi, soon after the
first case of COVID-19, the data revealed a fall in admissions (by 42%), gestational

age (1 week), birth weight (300 grams), and outside referrals (by 28%), and there
was a slight weekly increase in mortality (2%). In the Zimbabwean hospital,
admission numbers did not initially change after the first case of COVID-19 but fell by
48% during a nurses’ strike, which in itself was in response to challenges
exacerbated by the pandemic.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our data confirms the reports from frontline healthcare workers of a perceived
decline in neonatal service access and provision in LMICs. Digital routine healthcare
data capture enabled rapid profiling of indirect impacts of COVID-19 on newborn
care and outcomes in two tertiary referral hospitals, Malawi and Zimbabwe. While a
decrease in service access was seen in both countries, the impacts on care provided
and outcome differed by national context. Health systems strengthening, for example
digital data capture, may assist in planning context-specific mitigation efforts.

INTRODUCTION
The World Health Organization declared coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a Public
Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020.1 Confirmed cases
have exceeded 80 million globally with nearly two million deaths.2 Zimbabwe
recorded its first case on 20 March and has reported >17000 cases with >400 deaths
to date.2 Malawi confirmed its first three cases on 3 April and has reported ~7000
cases and ~200 deaths to date.2

Before the COVID-19 pandemic, considerable improvements were made in global
child health: the global neonatal mortality rate fell from 31 to 18 deaths per 1,000 live
births between 2000 and 2018.3 Yet there were disparities in the rates of decline with
the sub-Saharan Africa region facing highest neonatal mortality rates3. Now, there is
a danger that health outcomes in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs)
will fall further behind high-income countries. While countries worldwide face
challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic, LMICs are particularly struggling with
financial constraints, limited testing capacity, lack of personal protective equipment,
and staff shortages.4,5 As children are at low-risk of infection or severe disease from
COVID-19,6-10 any impacts on their health outcomes will likely be attributable to the
indirect effects of the pandemic on health systems, as in previous disease
outbreaks.11,12 These include increased rates of parental unemployment, food and
housing insecurity, and reduced access to routine care.13,14

The NeoTree application (app) is an Android tablet-based quality improvement
platform that aims to reduce neonatal mortality in LMICs.15 Developed in
collaboration with local stakeholders, it is embedded in routine practice at two

neonatal units (NNUs) in Zimbabwe and Malawi, providing real-time clinical decision
support, neonatal care education, and digital data capture.16,17

We aimed to examine trends in markers of neonatal care before and during the
COVID-19 pandemic at Sally Mugabe Central Hospital (SMCH), Zimbabwe, and
Kamuzu Central Hospital (KCH), Malawi. Specifically, we compared the:
1. number of admissions,
2. gestational age and birth weight of admitted neonates,
3. source of admission referrals,
4. prevalence of neonatal encephalopathy (NE), and
5. overall mortality rate
before and after the first reported cases of COVID-19.

METHODS
This study is reported in accordance with the Strengthening the Reporting of
Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement (Appendix 1).

Setting
SMCH is a public referral hospital in Harare, Zimbabwe. It has the largest of three
tertiary NNUs nationwide with 100 cots and predominantly doctor-led care. KCH,
Lilongwe, is one of four regional referral hospitals in Malawi and the NNU has 75
cots. In contrast to SMCH, care in the NNU is mostly nurse-led. Both units accept
local and national referrals for specialist surgical care.

Participants
All neonates admitted to each NNU over a 16-month period from 1 June 2019 to 25
September 2020 (69 complete weeks) were eligible for inclusion. We applied no
specific exclusion criteria.

Data collection
Data were collected prospectively using the NeoTree app. Health workers complete
a digital form when a neonate is admitted to the unit (admission form) and when they
are discharged or die (outcome form). The app guides assessment of the neonate
and collects data on patient demographics, examination findings, diagnoses, and
interventions. Pseudonymised forms are uploaded monthly to University College
London servers (Zimbabwe data) and Amazon Web Services (Malawi data).
Admission and outcome forms are linked by a unique identifier generated by the app
at admission.

Outcomes
We evaluated five outcomes:
1. Number of admissions: determined from the admission date of each
completed admission form.
2. Gestational age at birth (weeks) and birth weight (grams): as entered into the
admission form from obstetric records.
3. Source of admission: defined as ‘within’ (labour ward, postnatal ward,
antenatal ward, obstetric theatre, or fee-paying ward [KCH only]) or ‘outside’
(referral from another health facility or postnatal self-referral from home).
4. Diagnosis of NE: defined as “hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy” or “birth
asphyxia” recorded as a diagnosis, cause of death or contributory cause of
death on the outcome form.
5. Mortality: defined as an outcome of “neonatal death” on the outcome form. All
other neonates, including those discharged, transferred to another facility or
who left on parental request, were considered alive.

Ethical approval
Research ethics approval was granted by the UCL Research Ethics Committee
(17123/001) and ethics committees in Malawi (P.01/20/2909) and Zimbabwe
(MRCZ/A/2570) (Appendix 2). The need to obtain informed consent was waived as
we collected only pseudonymised data routinely documented for clinical care.

Statistical analysis
Analyses were performed in R version 3.6.3,18 running on RStudio version
1.2.5033.19 First, admission forms were matched with their corresponding outcome
form based on the unique identifier generated at admission. Lack of completed
outcome forms (SMCH: n=316[9.1%]; KCH: n=243[7.2%]) or errors in entry of the
unique identifier at discharge (SMCH: n=318[9.2%]; KCH: n=182[5.4%]) meant we
were unable to match some admission forms with outcome forms (SMCH:
n=634[18.3%]; KCH: n=425[12.6%]). For outcomes 1-3, we based analyses on data
from all admission forms, regardless of match status. For outcomes 4 and 5, we
based analyses on matched records only. Matched records implying a negative
admission duration (i.e. outcome date prior to admission date) were excluded
(SMCH: n=58[2%]; KCH: n=25[1%]). See Appendix 3 for a flow diagram of record
inclusion. Missing data were excluded using pairwise deletion for each analysis as
frequencies of missing values were minimal (Appendix 4).

This study used an interrupted time series design with weekly data windows. We
considered the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in each country as the intervention
(Zimbabwe: 20 March 2020; Malawi: 3 April 2020).2 For all outcomes, we
hypothesised a level change impact model without a lag (for a description of these
models, see Bernal et al.20). Gestational age and birth weight were modelled with
linear regression. All other outcomes were modelled using quasi-Poisson regression
to account for overdispersion,21 with the logarithm of the number of admissions in
each weekly window included as an offset. All SMCH models were adjusted for a
period of doctors’ strikes from 3 September 2019 to 22 January 2020.22 KCH models
were unadjusted. Additional models were constructed to explore the effects of a

RESULTS
Outcome 1: Admissions to the neonatal unit
We included 3,450 neonates at SMCH and 3,350 neonates at KCH. Figure 1 shows
the seven-day moving average of admissions to the NNU.

At SMCH, the mean (SD) number of weekly admissions was 54·6 (23·5) before the
first case of COVID-19 (pre-COVID-19) and 42·8 (19·9) afterwards (post-COVID-19).
The level change regression model, adjusted for the doctors’ strike, showed no
evidence of a change in admissions after the first case of COVID-19 (relative risk
[RR] 0·83; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0·60-1·14; p = 0·25) but the scatterplot
indicated this model fit the data poorly (model 1, Figure 2A). An alternative model,

additionally adjusted for the nurses’ strike, again showed no change in the overall
post-COVID-19 period (RR 0·90; 95%CI 0·69-1·17; p = 0·43) (model 2, Figure 2B).
However, this model suggested that admissions fell by 48% during the nurses’ strike
period (RR 0·52, 95%CI 0·40-0·68, p < 0·001) and fit the data better (F[1, 64] =
24·66, p < 0·001).

At KCH, the mean (SD) number of weekly admissions was 54·5 (10·8) in the preCOVID-19 period and 38·0 (10·9) in the post-COVID-19 period. The level change
model suggested a 42% reduction in admissions after the first case of COVID-19
(RR 0·58; 95%CI 0·48-0·70; p < 0·001) (Figure 2C).

Outcome 2: Gestational age and birth weight
At SMCH, the mean (SD) gestational age at birth was 36·1 (4·4) weeks in the preCOVID-19 period and 36·0 (4·2) weeks in the post-COVID-19 period. The mean (SD)
birth weight was 2500 (908) grams in the pre-COVID-19 period and 2487 (896)
grams in the post-COVID-19 period. Regression analysis indicated no change in
gestational age at birth nor birth weight after the first case of COVID-19 (gestational
age: beta 0·04; 95%CI -0·53-0·61; p = 0·89, birth weight: beta -7·2; 95%CI -127·1112·6; p = 0·91) (Figure 3A, Figure 3C). Adjusting for the nurses’ strike did not
improve model fit (data not shown).

At KCH, the mean (SD) gestational age was 35·0 (3·9) weeks in the pre-COVID-19
period and 34·8 (3·9) weeks in the post-COVID-19 period. The mean (SD) birth
weight was 2402 (883) grams in the pre-COVID-19 period and 2299 (870) grams in
the post-COVID-19 period. Gestational age decreased by one week in the postCOVID-19 period (beta -1·14; 95%CI -1·62-[-]0·65; p < 0·001) (Figure 3B) and birth
weight decreased by 300 grams (beta -299·9; 95%CI -412·3-[-]187·5; p < 0·001)
(Figure 3D).

Outcome 3: Source of admission referral
At SMCH, the mean (SD) percentage of outside referrals to the NNU was 39(11)% in
the pre-COVID-19 period and 35(9)% in the post-COVID-19 period. The regression
model showed no evidence of a change in the percentage of outside referrals after
the first case of COVID-19 (RR 0·98; 95%CI 0·79-1·23; p = 0·88) (Figure 4A).
Adjusting for the nurses’ strike did not improve model fit (data not shown).

At KCH, the mean (SD) percentage of outside referrals was 61(8)% in the preCOVID-19 period and 51(10)% in the post-COVID-19 period. Regression analysis
suggested a 28% relative reduction in outside referrals after the first case of COVID19 (RR 0·72; 95%CI 0·65-0·81; p < 0·001) (Figure 4B).

Outcome 4: Prevalence of neonatal encephalopathy
At SMCH, the mean (SD) percentage of admitted neonates diagnosed with NE was
16(6)% in the pre-COVID-19 period and 21(12)% in the post-COVID-19 period
suggesting a possible increase. Regression analysis showed no statistically
significant change in the percentage of neonates diagnosed with NE post-COVID-19
(RR 1·08; 95%CI 0·76-1·55; p = 0·67) (Figure 5A). Adjusting for the nurses’ strike did
not improve model fit (data not shown).

At KCH, the mean (SD) percentage of admitted neonates diagnosed with NE was
15(6)% in the pre-COVID-19 period and 13(5)% in the post-COVID-19 period. The
regression model suggested a possible increase in diagnoses of NE after the first
case of COVID-19, but this was not statistically significant (RR 1·30; 95%CI 0·951·80; p = 0·11) (Figure 5B).

Outcome 5: Overall mortality
For SMCH, the mean (SD) percentage of deaths per week of admission was
25(10)% in the pre-COVID-19 period and 26(16)% in the post-COVID-19 period. The
level change regression model, adjusted for the doctors’ strike, showed no evidence
of a change in mortality after the first case of COVID-19 (RR 0·80; 95%CI 0·56-1·15;
p = 0·23) but the scatterplot indicated this model fit the data poorly (model 1, Figure
6A). An alternative model, additionally adjusted for the nurses’ strike, again showed
no change in overall mortality (RR 0·72; 95%CI 0·51-1·03; p = 0·07) but fit the data
better (F[1, 64] = 11·61, p = 0·001) (model 2, Figure 6B).

For KCH, the mean (SD) percentage of deaths per week of admission was 19(6)% in
the pre-COVID-19 period and 23(9)% in the post-COVID-19 period. The level
change regression model suggested a possible increase in mortality after the first
case of COVID-19, but this was not statistically significant (RR 1·31; 95%CI 0·981·73; p = 0·07) (Figure 6C). However, fitting a slope change impact model suggested
a small relative increase in mortality by 2% per week in the post-COVID-19 period
(RR 1·02 per week; 95%CI 1·00-1·04, p = 0·04) (Figure 6D).

DISCUSSION
Summary
We performed an interrupted time series analysis to examine changes in neonatal
care provision at two tertiary NNUs in Zimbabwe and Malawi after the first cases of
COVID-19. We found that admissions at SMCH did not change significantly after the
first case of COVID-19 when considering this period as a whole, but there was a
considerable decrease (~50%) in the number admissions in June to August 2020,
coinciding with a nurses’ strike. We did not find significant changes in gestational
age or birth weight, source of admission referrals, prevalence of NE or mortality at
SMCH. Conversely, we found several changes in markers of neonatal care at KCH
after the first case of COVID-19 in Malawi. The number of admissions fell by 42%
and we noted a decrease in the gestational age and birth weight of admitted
neonates (by ~1 week and ~300 grams, respectively), a 28% relative decrease in
outside referrals, and a small but statistically significant weekly increase in mortality
by 2% after the first case of COVID-19. Although this study is descriptive, we can
speculate about explanations for our results based on existing literature and
discussions with local health workers.

Interpretation
The number of admissions at SMCH fell by around 50% between June to August
2020, but we noted no change outside this strike period, suggesting some resilience
to the impact of the pandemic. However, nurses went on strike over pay and
availability of personal protective equipment,23 so the strike is itself an indirect
consequence of COVID-19. A similar reduction in admissions was seen at KCH, but,
unlike at SMCH, this 42% decrease was noted within a week of the first case of

COVID-19. In Figure 7, we propose several interlinked factors that might explain
reduced admissions to the NNU. Several of these factors, such as fear of using
health services, disrupted transport networks and staff shortages have been directly
reported by local sources in LMICs and were highlighted in a recent report by
Graham et al.24

We found a slight decrease in gestational age and birth weight of neonates at KCH,
but not SMCH. Studies have reported increased rates of preterm birth in pregnant
women with COVID-19 compared to those without the disease, mostly from
medically-induced preterm birth; although none of these studies were conducted in
LMICs.26 Preliminary analysis suggests rates of emergency caesarean section
increased at SMCH and KCH, with a more marked increase at KCH (Appendix 6).

This is one potential explanation for our findings. However, we noted that the number
of outside referrals decreased by 28% at KCH, and neonates referred from outside
KCH are more likely to be from lower-risk pregnancies that delivered in a health
centre with higher gestational ages and birth weights. Further analysis should stratify
by source of admission referral to clarify this finding, but is supported by the fact that
referrals were rigorously triaged by the on-call paediatrician during the pandemic,
and that referrals from some areas were diverted away from KCH.

We hypothesised that rates of NE would increase during the pandemic. NE is the
clinical manifestation of disordered brain function and can have multiple
aetiologies.27 The term ‘hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy’ is reserved for cases
where there is evidence of intrapartum asphyxia.27 In LMICs, obstructed labour is a
major cause of maternal mortality and can lead to intrapartum asphyxia with
subsequent neonatal morbidity and mortality, including NE.28 Therefore, the
prevalence of NE might be expected to increase as a marker of delayed presentation
to a health facility. It is reassuring that we did not find increased rates of NE at
SMCH or KCH. However, these findings should be interpreted cautiously as some
neonates with NE may not have presented to a health facility at all.

Finally, we observed a slight increase in overall mortality at KCH (a relative increase
of 2% per week after the first case of COVID-19), although not at SMCH. In KCH, the
increase in mortality may be due to decreased gestational age and birthweight, but
also due to a reduced rota of nursing staff implemented to protect healthcare
workers. In fact, there was a suggestion that mortality decreased after the first case
of COVID-19 in Zimbabwe, but this was not statistically significant. The reasons for

this are unclear but could include factors such as increased stillbirth rates or
improved care for the smaller number of neonates on the NNU. More complete
analysis of facility-based and community-based neonatal mortality is greatly needed.

Limitations and future work
Some limitations should be noted. A limitation intrinsic to interrupted time series
analysis is the possibility that another event occurred close to the first case of
COVID-19 in either country causing spurious observations. Another potential threat
to validity is changing data collection practices. For example, overstretched clinicians
might not input data into the NeoTree app for all admitted neonates. However, this is
unlikely as the NeoTree app is embedded into routine practice at SMCH and KCH
and discussions with local collaborators suggest use of the app has continued
without issue.

The NeoTree app only collects data on neonates admitted to the NNU. Therefore,
our analysis does not capture stillbirths or neonatal deaths that occur in the
community. It is troubling to see a dramatic fall in admissions in both sites, raising
the possibility that many unwell neonates did not attend a health facility and died at
home. A recent study found that facility births decreased by over 50% during the
lockdown in Nepal, and facility stillbirth and neonatal mortality rates increased
significantly.29 The NeoTree research team is currently collecting data on stillbirths at
SMCH and KCH, but these data will still only represent stillbirths that occurred in a
health facility. Given the COVID-19 pandemic is not over, it will be important to
repeat our analysis over the coming months to further examine longer-term trends in
neonatal care provision.

Conclusion
The indirect impacts of COVID-19 are context-specific, with more significant and
evident effects on neonatal care provision seen at KCH (Malawi) than SMCH
(Zimbabwe). While this study provides vital evidence to inform health providers and
policy makers, national data are required to ascertain the true impacts of the
pandemic on newborn health.
