Decisions on school closures and on safe schooling during the COVID-19 pandemic should
be evidence-based. We conducted a systematic literature review to assess child-to-child and
child-to-adult SARS-CoV-2 transmission and to characterise the potential role of school
closures on community transmission. 1337 peer-reviewed articles published through August
31, 2020 were screened; 22 were included in this review. The literature appraised provides
sufficient evidence that children can both be infected by and transmit SARS-CoV-2 in
community, household and school settings. Transmission by children was most frequently
documented in household settings, while examples of children as index cases in school
settings were rare. Included studies suggested that school closures may help to reduce SARSCoV-2 transmission, but the societal, economic, and educational impacts of prolonged school
closures must be considered. In-school mitigation measures, alongside continuous
surveillance and assessment of emerging evidence, will promote the protection and
educational attainment of students and support the educational workforce.

One of the more perplexing and controversial dimensions of the COVID-19 pandemic
surrounds the role of children in the transmission. Are they drivers of the pandemic, or are
they merely innocent bystanders, affected in myriad ways by school closures and other physical
distancing measures while not being generally at-risk of COVID-19 themselves?

During the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic, the vast uncertainty surrounding the
epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 led many countries globally to include school closures as part
of more general lockdowns. In the European Union (EU) / European Economic Area (EEA),
all but two countries, Iceland and Sweden closed primary schools roughly during the period of
March 2020 â€“ May 2020 (Figure 1); all EU/EEA countries closed secondary schools, to some
degree, during the same period (1). These school closures were concomitant with other societallevel physical distancing measures during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Available data from The European Surveillance System (TESSy) indicates that severe
outcomes from SARS-CoV-2 infections, including fatalities, are much lower in paediatric
patients compared to adults (Figure 2). As of 1 November 2020, and from over a million
reported COVID-19 cases in Europe from 12 countries (Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, Germany,
Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Norway, Poland and Slovakia), rates of
hospitalization and severe hospitalization (i.e. intensive care unit admissions, respiratory
support or oxygen therapy) are notably lower for children than for adults (particularly for those
over 40 years of age), with one notable exception being hospitalization rates for infants under
1 year (Figure 2). Meanwhile, fatalities among children due to COVID-19 are very rare: as of
1 November 2020, across these 12 countries in the European Union and European Economic
Area (EU/EEA), there have been 12 reported fatalities for children under 16 years of age (of
67,701 reported cases), and six deaths for children between 16 and 19 years of age (of 42,545
reported cases). Since September 2020, which coincides with start of the new school year, the
age-specific risk of severe outcomes has fallen in all age groups (Figure 2, panels a-c).

Other epidemiologic indicators of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children provide a complex
picture regarding their potential role in the transmission chain. A systematic review concluded
that, based on current evidence, children and adolescents have lower susceptibility to SARSCoV-2 infection (2). However, when infected and symptomatic, children appear to shed viral
RNA in similar quantities to adults (3), and that younger children (under 5 years) with mild to
moderate symptoms may shed even more virus than older children and adults (4). While the
proportion of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections among children in the general population
is uncertain, 16% of paediatric cases in Europe were classified as asymptomatic (5), while up
to 90% of paediatric cases in China were deemed to be asymptomatic, mild, or moderate (6).
It is possible that children are less often asymptomatic carriers than adults: a study of nonCOVID-19-related hospitalizations in Milan identified 1% of children and 9% of adults as
asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2 (7).

Important potential sources of evidence surrounding the role of children in the COVID-19
pandemic come from studies situated in the community, household, or school settings and from

modelling studies. As the emerging literature may have important insights to guide decisionmaking around school closures as well support decision making for mitigation measures in
household and school settings, and to complement the literature on the susceptibility of
children to SARS-CoV-2 (2), a systematic literature review was conducted to assess the role
of children in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

The primary aim of this systematic literature review was to assess child-to-child and child-toadult SARS-CoV-2 transmission and secondarily to characterise the potential role of the
opening and closing of schools on community transmission. Here we outline the findings from
this review, while highlighting perspectives of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and
Control (ECDC) on current uncertainties and research gaps, mitigation measures for schools,
community and household settings, and surveillance and monitoring priorities.

METHODS
Search Strategy
This systematic literature review is reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items
for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines (8). The methodology used
adhered to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis)
guidelines. Relevant studies published between December 2019 and August 31, 2020 were
identified by searching Medline and Embase. The following set of inclusion criteria were used
to determine eligibility of the studies, which is based on the PCC framework (P-Population, CConcept, C-Context). The study Population was restricted to people 1-17 years old (excluding
neonatal transmission), the Concept was to assess child-to-child and child-to-adult
transmission, while the Context was to assess community, household and school transmission.
Subject heading terms and free text words relating to the Population, Concept and Context
terms as identified in the inclusion criteria were used to develop a comprehensive list of terms
for the search strategy (Supplementary Table 1). We included all studies of quantitative
research, while opinion pieces, commentaries, editorials were excluded. We additionally
screened reference lists of the included articles to identify further relevant studies. The search
was limited to the English language.

Data extraction
The data extraction template was piloted independently by the two reviewers on a random
sample of two included studies to enable an assessment of consistency in data extraction and
to identify where amendments needed to be made to the template. The remaining studies were
then data extracted independently by two reviewers, and the results were double checked across
the original manuscript by a third reviewer.

Data synthesis
Characteristics of the included studies were presented in tabulated form detailing the study
design, geographical location of the study, sample size, characteristics of the populations
considered, setting, context, and the findings of the study. A narrative synthesis approach was
applied to look systematically at the data and to describe each study categorized by the study
design. Patterns in the data were identified through tabulation of results, and an inductive
approach was taken to translate the data to identify areas of commonality between studies.
Mathematical modelling and simulation studies were assessed separately from those reporting
real-life data.

Study selection
Initially, a pilot screening process was used where 100 identical articles were screened for their
eligibility independently by two reviewers to ensure consistency in screening. As a high
measure of inter-rater agreement was achieved between the two reviewers during the pilot
assessment (percentage agreement >90% and/ or Cohenâ€™s Kappa >0.81), the remaining titles
were randomly allocated to the two reviewers and screened for eligibility independently by
them. After an initial selection of the titles, each reviewer assessed each otherâ€™s selected
studies. The retrieved articles were then independently double-screened by two reviewers
based on the full text of the articles.

Study selection and description
A total of 1411 studies were identified according to the specified selection criteria from
Medline and Embase. After the removal of duplicates, 1337 were screened by title/abstract, out
of which 102 were assessed via full text, and 22 studies subsequently included in this review.
Overall, 14 of the included studies reported on child-to-adult transmission of SARS-CoV-2,
while eight explored the impact of school closures on the epidemiology of the COVID-19
pandemic. Almost all studies (7/8) that assessed the impact of school closure were simulation
models, while all 14 studies that assessed child-to-adult transmission patterns were
observational in design. The PRISMA flowchart showing the flow of study selection is
presented in Figure 3.

Fourteen published studies were identified to address child-to-adult transmission of SARSCoV-2. Two referred to transmission within a community setting, six within a household and
six within a school setting.

Community settings
Only one case study and one ecological study assessed child-to-adult transmission of COVID19 within a community setting. A case study by Jung et al. (9), reported the contact-tracing
results of a 9-year-old infected asymptomatic girl. A total of 1206 close and casual contacts
were identified of which 96% underwent a SARS-CoV-2 PCR test and for which the results
were negative for every close and casual contact, except for one adult. Goldstein & Lipsitch
(2020) (10) used data on COVID-19 cases in Germany evaluated the contributing role of
different age groups in COVID-19 community transmission. According to their analyses,
COVID-19 cases among 10-14 and 15-19 year olds were 0.78 times lower and 1.14 times more
likely respectively to be a case compared to other age groups after the implementation of
physical distancing measures. In comparison to all age groups, individuals aged 10-14 years
had lower odds of being a case compared to adults 15-34 years old, while 15-19 year olds were
less likely to be a case (OR 0.81) than 20-24 year olds, after the implementation of physical
distancing measures, including school closure.

Household settings
Four studies assessed household child-to-child and child-to-adult transmission within family
clusters as detailed in Table 1. Posfay-Barbe et al. assessed the clinical presentation of the 111
household contacts of the first pediatric cases of COVID-19 in Geneva, Switzerland, according
to which only in 3/39 (8%) of households the study child was the index case (11). Similarly,
Teherani et al., conducted contact tracing among household members of 32 confirmed pediatric
COVID-19 cases, for which only in 7/32 households did children develop first symptoms of
COVID-19 and were assumed as the suspected index cases (12). Somekh et al. also investigated
the role of children in household COVID-19 transmission in Israel, using a cluster of 13
families, and found that only in one family the index case was a child (13). Maltezou et al.
noted that among 23 family clusters in Greece only in 2 families the index case was a child,
while there was no evidence of child-to-adult or child-to-child secondary transmission (14).

Two studies from South Korea assessed secondary attack rates when children were the index
cases as depicted in Table 2. Park et al. performed an assessment of 46 COVID-19 index cases
(three cases 0-9 years old and 43 cases 10-19 years old) in households. For index cases under
9 years old, the household secondary attack rate was 5.3%, the non-household 1.1% and the
overall secondary attack rate was 2.1%. On the contrary, for index cases 10-19 years of age,
the secondary attack rates were 18.6% (household), 0.9% (non-household) and 9.8% (overall)
(15). An additional study from South Korea among 107 index children and 248 household
members, identified only one case of secondary transmission to a household member and the
secondary attack rate was estimated to be 0.5%. In this study an additional 40 confirmed cases
were found in household members, but it could not be determined as a secondary transmission
as they had the same exposure as the pediatric index case (16).

School settings
Six studies assessed SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a school setting the main results of which
are outlined in Table 3. Heavey et al. conducted a case study in order to explore the role of
transmission among children in the school setting in the Republic of Ireland, before school
closure (17). Three pediatric and three adult cases of COVID-19 with a history of school
attendance were detected with 1155 contacts. Child-to-adult transmission or child-to-child
transmission was not reported in this study. Similarly Danis et al. presented the contact tracing
results of a nine-year-old child in France, who visited 3 different schools the first days of
symptom appearance. There was no evidence of secondary transmission in any of the school
contacts (18). Moreover, Yung et al. traced three COVID-19 cases (2 pediatric and 1 adult) in
three different educational settings, and the results were negative (19). One study from New
South Wales, Australia presented an overview of COVID-19 cases and transmission in schools.
In a total number of 25 schools and 10 Early Childhood Educational and Care Settings, 27
index cases were identified, among which 12 were children and 15 staff members. Secondary
transmission was noted only in four out of 25 educational settings, and the overall child-toadult attack rate was estimated at 1.0%. (20).

Two studies reported on the regional evidence after the re-opening of schools. A school
outbreak in Israel after reopening of schools in May 2020 was described by Stein-Zamir et al.
(21). The outbreak assessment was initiated by two pediatric COVID-19 cases that were not
epidemiologically related. The results showed that 153/1161 students and 25/151 staff
members tested positive for COVID-19. However, this outbreak was attributed to crowded
classes, combined with the exemption of facemasks and the use of air-condition due to an
extreme heatwave. On the contrary, a study by Link-Gelles et al., in Rhode Island, USA. among
666 child care programs that reopened on 1 June, 2020 after a 3-month closure revealed 52
confirmed and probable cases (33 confirmed cases), of which 30 were among children and 22
among adults (22). Secondary transmission for 10 cases was noted in only 4/666 childcare
programs, which was attributed to class distancing, the use of face masks for adults, universal
symptom screening daily and disinfection.

The impact of school closure on COVID-19 transmission

Eight published studies were identified with regard to the effect of school closure on the
epidemiology of the COVID-19 pandemic, the results of which are presented in Table 4. Seven

of these studies were based on mathematical modelling and various assumptions of infectivity
from the first 3-4 months of the pandemic (23-29), while one was a time series study (30). The
modelling studies in principal indicated that school closure is associated with a reduction in the
number of cases, a reduction of hospitalizations and ICU admissions, with the effect of school
closure dependent on the transmission rate, and the duration of school closure. Only one time
series was reported by Auger et al. assessing data collected between 9 March 2020 and 7 May
2020, aiming at determining whether the closure of primary and secondary schools affects
COVID-19 incidence and mortality in the USA (30). The results (adjusted for other enacted
policies and testing rates) indicated that school closure was associated with a 62% reduction of
COVID-19 incidence per week and a 58% reduction in mortality per week. It was found that
countries which had a low cumulative COVID-19 incidence at the time of school closure, had
greater reductions in incidence and mortality compared to those with a higher cumulative
incidence at the same time.

This study provides an up-to-date rapid review of the peer-reviewed literature pertaining to
SARS-CoV-2 transmission by children, a topic which is a crucial input to assessments of the
role of school settings in COVID-19 transmission (31). The literature appraised in this review
provides sufficient evidence that children can both be infected by and transmit SARS-CoV-2
in both community, household and school settings. This finding is corroborated by research
published after the cut-off date for this review, such as a large study from India (32).

Transmission of SARS-COV-2 has thus far been documented to be higher in household settings
than in other community settings â€“ including schools â€“ a finding which may be potentially
attributable to the individual, behavioural and contextual factors of households vs. other
settings, as has been suggested elsewhere (33). Meanwhile, while children are overall noted to
have lower rates of severe COVID-19 cases, there is evidence of differing transmission
dynamics between younger vs. older children. In particular, there is some evidence that when
index cases, younger children, such as under 10 years of age, lead to lower secondary attack
rates than older children and adult. This matter warrants further investigation before concrete
conclusions can be drawn (34, 35).

Within our review there were limited cases in the assessed studies in which a child index case
was responsible for secondary transmission in schools, with the notable exception of an
outbreak in Israel (21), which was associated with dense spacing, lack of the use of
facemasks and closed spaces with poor ventilation. On the contrary, evidence from Rhode
Island in the US, noted a very small number of cases after schools reopened during June-July
2020, which the authors attribute to the strict non-pharmaceutical interventions implemented
including the use of face masks, physical distancing, screening for symptoms and classroom
disinfection (22). A similar experience has been highlighted in Hong Kong, where multiple
potential introductions of COVID-19 did not lead to secondary transmission, amidst a setting
with numerous precautionary in-school measures, such as widespread facemask use, daily
temperature checks, and staggered entries and exits (36).

In our review, seven modelling studies assessed the role of school closure, and overall
indicated that school closure is associated with a reduction in the number of cases,
hospitalisations and ICU admissions. However, the primary endpoints in the modelling
studies were dependent on the transmission rate and the duration of school closure. While
school closure may reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission, the societal and economic impacts of
prolonged school closure are noteworthy, as they may impact the availability of the
healthcare workforce, (25, 37) and may also have negative effects on children through the
interruption of the educational learning, social isolation, increased exposure to home
violence, and rise in dropout rates (38).

There are important limitations to this study that may impact the direct implications for
decision-making. As we assessed peer-reviewed evidence published in two biomedical
databases, it inherently reflects the status quo of the end of the previous school year (20192020) due to the lag time between study implementation, peer review and publication. A further
limitation of this report refers to the study designs, notably case series and case reports. Finally,
the household studies that we assessed reflect a broad geographical and temporal range are
limited in comparability due to varying factors such as: background levels of community
SARS-CoV-2 transmission; enrolment strategies; household structures and social isolation
practices within households; study testing rates; and varying physical distancing policies
including school closures.

271

273

Despite these limitations, the findings presented here provide an up-to-date assessment of the
currently published peer-reviewed evidence. However, with an upsurge of cases in autumn
2020, the likelihood of introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into school settings increases.
Continuous surveillance and assessment of the evidence is warranted to ensure the maximum
protection of the health of students and the educational workforce. Where schools remain open,
in-school mitigation measures, particularly for schools with older children, should be adopted
and continually refined as new knowledge comes to light.

OBJECTIVE

RESULTS

Simulation
study

To investigate the impact of
school closure, quarantine,
workplace distancing on the
number of cases on day 80 of
the pandemic.

Simulation
study

To estimate the impact on
mortality attributable to the
reduction of the U.S.
healthcare labor force due to
child-care responsibilities
induced by school closure

Total number of infections on day 80 of the
pandemic based on the implementation of the
measures
Ro=1.5
Baseline cases 279,000 (245,000-320,000)
School closure alone would reduce the cases to
10,000 (200-28,000)
Ro=2.0
Baseline cases 727,000 (670,000-776,000)
School closure alone would reduce the cases to
97,000 (14,000-219,000)
Ro=2.5
Baseline cases 1,207,000 (1,164,000 â€“
1,249,000)
School closure alone would reduce the cases to
466,000 (175,000-728,000)
The reduction in healthcare workers due to
school closures must not raise the mortality per
case to more than 3Â·4% (2Â·7â€“4Â·2) or the
elasticity of healthcare worker productivity must
not exceed 0Â·099 (0Â·077â€“0Â·124) in order school
closures to be effective.

Scenario 1 - Vacation periods
In a COVID-19 outbreak for a baseline Ro of 2.5
and assuming a vacation mixing pattern, the
mean peak daily incidence is reduced by about
64%.
Scenario 2 - Regular weekdays with removal of
all contacts: In the corresponding scenario where
school contacts are removed, a reduction of
about 42% was noted.

Intense control measures of prolonged school
closure and work holidays reduce the cumulative
infections + peak incidence and delay the peak of
the outbreak.
The modelled effects of prolonged school closure
and work holidays vary by duration of
infectiousness
To model the effect of school Assuming that the transmission rate increased

10-fold after schools open, a school opening on 2
epidemic in South Korea.
March 2020, would lead to an additional 60
cases within one week, +100 cases within the
following two weeks.
Assuming higher transmission rates lead to a
higher number of cases after school opening.

Observational
(time series)

To assess the impact of
school closures on COVID19 incidence and mortality.
Data were collected for 6
weeks after school closure.

At the regional level a reduction in peak demand
for hospital beds by 5.2% and for ICU beds by
6.8%
The effectiveness of school closures decreases
with increasing R0 values
In the scenario that daily contacts are reduced by
60% a reduction in the peak of COVID-19
incidence by 24.4%, in the attack rate by 8.1%
and in ICU admissions by 4.6% was estimated.
In the scenario that daily contacts are reduced by
80% a reduction in the peak of COVID-19
incidence by 32.4%, in the attack rate by 11.8%
and in ICU admissions by 5.5% was estimated.
School closure was associated with a significant
decline in COVID-19 incidence.
Relative reduction in COVID-19 incidence per
week by 62% and a relative reduction in
mortality per week by 58%
