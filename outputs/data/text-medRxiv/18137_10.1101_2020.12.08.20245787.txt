Abstract
Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses multiple psychologicallystressful challenges and is associated with increased risk for mental illness. Previous studies have
mostly focused on the psychopathological symptoms associated with the outbreak peak.
Methods: We examined the behavioural and mental health impact of the pandemic in Israel using an
online survey. We collected 12,125 responses from 4,933 adult respondents during six weeks
encompassing the end of the first outbreak and the beginning of the second. We used clinically
validated instruments (Brief Symptom Inventory 18 (BSI-18), Perceived stress scale (PSS), Brief COPE
inventory) to assess anxiety- and depression-related emotional distress, symptoms, and coping
strategies, as well as questions designed to specifically assess COVID-19-related concerns.
Results: Respondents indicated worrying more about the situation in their country and their close
ones contracting the virus, than about their own health and financial situation. The reported distress
correlates with the number of new COVID-19 cases and higher emotional burden was associated with
being female, younger, unemployed, living in low socioeconomic status localities, encountering more
people, and experiencing physiological symptoms. Unexpectedly, older age and having a prior medical
condition were associated with reduced emotional distress.
Conclusions: Our findings show that inequalities in mental-health burden associated with the COVID19 pandemic are relevant also following the initial outbreak, and highlight the environmental context
and its importance in understanding individual ability to cope with the long-term stressful challenges
of the pandemic.

Introduction

male, were all negatively correlated with
reports of depression, anxiety, and PTSD
during the initial stage of the COVID-19
pandemic6. These and other studies describe
the anxiety induced by the pandemic and its
negative correlation with sleep quality and
social support, both in the general population
and in susceptible groups, such as healthcare
staff members7–9 and self-isolated people10,11.

As of October 31st 2020, the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2), which causes the coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID‑19) , has infected 45 million
people and taken the lives of over 1,180,000 in
more than 200 countries and territories
around the world1. The pandemic has
dramatically affected virtually all aspects of
our lives: It has led to the largest global
recession since the Great Depression2, and to
extreme social isolation due to changes in
educational and work activities, local
lockdowns,
and
international
travel
restrictions. Social isolation and financial
instability, together with fear of contracting
COVID-19 and uncertainty of the future, pose
substantial psychological stressors for the
general population3. It is likely that the
pandemic induces a considerable degree of
fear, worry and concern in the general
population.

To further shed light on this emerging global
picture, we set out to assess the long-term
mental health-related effects of the pandemic
on the adult population in Israel using an
online survey. During the six weeks between
April 28th and June 9th 2020, we collected
12,125 responses from 4,933 adult
respondents (see study population description
in Methods section). The respondents agreed
to answer a two-stage online questionnaire,
where in the first stage, they reported on
COVID-19-related physiological symptoms and
behaviours together with background
demographic and medical information, and in
the second stage on the effects of COVID-19 on
their psychological and emotional state (see
Methods). Importantly, our data were
collected after the initial outbreak peak, and
thus reflect a period in which people have had
the chance to adapt to the new circumstances,
rather than the initial reactions to the
outbreak. These six weeks of data collection
allowed us a broad and dynamic view of the
period between the first and the second
outbreaks.

Studies of the impact of this pandemic on

consequences for vulnerable subgroups, are
critically needed. So far, most of the work in
this area has addressed the acute mental
health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,
measured during the outbreak peak. Indeed,
despite geographical and cultural differences,
several studies have provided largely
consistent results in these aspects: A study
conducted on Chinese residents found that
54% of 1,210 respondents rated the
psychological impact of the COVID-19
outbreak as moderate or severe4. In an
Australian study using an online survey during
the outbreak peak, 78% of 5,070 respondents
reported worsening of their mental health
since the outbreak5. An additional study
performed on a Spanish cohort (n = 3,840),
found that age, economic stability, and being

personal situation - namely, contracting the
coronavirus and their financial situation - than
they did about the situation in their country
and about people close to them contracting
the virus (Fig.1e-f; Friedman’s test with posthoc Bonferroni correction for multiple

psychological and emotional effects of the
pandemic. Thus, to try and assess what people
are most worried about during the pandemic,
we asked respondents to rate the extent to
which they were concerned about specific
issues. Despite the many unknowns about the
COVID-19 disease and its potential effects on
our personal lives in the future, respondents
reported lower levels of concern about their

represented by a smaller number of factors.
We used factor analysis on the answers to the
distress- and worry-related questions, which
revealed three principal factors or components
(see Methods and Supp. Fig. 2). The three
factors respectively corresponded to questions
related to: (1) general emotional distress and
worrying about your financial situation
(henceforth: “general emotional distress”); (2)
worrying about contracting COVID-19 and
about people close to you contracting COVID19
(henceforth:
“COVID-19
infection
concern”), and (3) worrying about the situation
in Israel and around the world (henceforth:
“national and global concern”). In most of the
following analyses, we focus on these three
measures, along with the number of stressrelated physiological symptoms experienced
and the number of stress-coping strategies
used.

In addition to specific reasons for worry, we
looked into reports of distress-related
symptoms and emotions more generally, using
questions from the anxiety and depression
subscales of the brief symptom inventory 18
(BSI-1812) and from the perceived stress scale
(PSS13) (Supp. Fig 1). In our cohort, the mean
BSI-18 scores for anxiety and depression were
0.72±0.8 and 0.42±0.61, respectively. These
scores are similar to the Israeli norm (anxiety:
0.85±0.71; depression: 0.7±0.69), which is
based on a nationwide representative sample
of 510 community respondents between the
ages of 35 and 65 years14. We further asked
about experiencing several stress-related
physiological symptoms and about the stresscoping strategies used (part of the brief-COPE
questionnaire15). To gain a more integrative
and concise description of respondents’
emotional responses, we examined to what
extent answers were correlated across
questions and could thus be compactly

p<1e-21), but not for the COVID-19 infection
concern (Fig. 2b; n=4,841; Tau=0.01; p=0.733)
and the national and global concern (Fig. 2c;
n=4,841; Tau=-0.01; p=0.963). Notably,
although the dynamics of the national-global
concern seem somewhat similar to those of
the other scales (a decrease followed by an
increase and another decrease), its initial rise
starts earlier and it seems largely more stable
compared to the other scales (Fig. 2c). Overall,
these correlations may demonstrate our
questionnaire’s sensitivity in capturing stressrelated effects of COVID-19 in real-time.
Interestingly, a similar correlation between
stress symptoms (assessed by social media
data mining) and the number of new COVID-19
cases was also found in a study in the United
States16.

Next, we examined whether and how
responses changed with time. We observed
qualitatively similar characteristics between
the temporal dynamics of our five main scores
and the number of new daily COVID-19 cases
as published by the Israeli Ministry of Health
(health.gov.il; Fig. 2a-e). All of these scores
seem to gradually decline over the first several
weeks, together with the decline in the
numbers of new daily COVID-19 patients.
Similarly, around May 26th, as the numbers of
new cases started to rise, so did the reports.
However, about a week later, despite the
continued rise in new cases, these values
started to decline, presumably reflecting an
adaptation or behavioural habituation to this
new situation. Thus, we quantified the
correlation between the number of new cases
and these five scores, and found a statistically
significant correlation for the general
emotional distress scale (Kendall’s correlation

exercising or meditating (Supp. Fig. 3;
OR=1.19; p=0.0434). This may suggest that
more coping methods are needed to alleviate
a greater sense of emotional distress.
Importantly, considering the full distribution of
responses, the differences between genders
seem much more prominent at the lower
levels of general emotional distress, as well as
for lower numbers of symptoms and coping
strategies (Fig. 3a,d-e), while they seem less
prominent for both high and low levels of
concern about COVID-19 and about the
national and global situation (Fig. 3b-c).

Next, we asked whether the emotional
response to the pandemic differed between
genders (see note regarding non-binary
genders in Methods section). Similar to
previous studies17,18, we found that female
respondents reported higher levels of distress
on the general emotional distress scale (Fig.
3a-b; Mann-Whitney U test; nM=2,178,
nF=2,473; U=0.55; p=1.7e-9); the COVID-19
infection concern scale (Fig. 3a,c; nM=2,178,
nF=2,473; U=0.55; p<4.5e-9); and the nationalglobal concern scale (Fig. 3a,d; nM=2,178,
nF=2,473; U=0.52; p<0.024). In accordance
with the higher levels of emotional distress, we
also found that women reported experiencing
a greater number of stress-related symptoms
(Fig. 3a,e; nM=2,212, nF=2,525; U=0.56; p=2e14), and using more stress-coping strategies
(Fig. 3a,f; nM=2,212, nF=2,525; U=0.56; p=4e13). Specifically, women were more likely to
report experiencing increased heart rate
(Supp. Fig. 3; nM=2,212, nF=2,525; see perquestion contingency table counts in figure;
Fisher’s exact test: odds ratio (OR)=1.69;
p=0.0026), increased appetite (Supp. Fig. 3;
OR=1.56; p=0.0006) and trouble sleeping
(Supp. Fig. 3; OR=1.44; p=7.2e7). Women were
also more likely to report using specific coping
strategies, such as contacting someone for
support (Supp. Fig. 3; OR=2.79; p<1e-26) and

Age negatively correlates with reported
distress
Since age is a known factor influencing the
stress response19, we evaluated the effect of
age on people’s emotional responses to the
pandemic. We quantified the correlation
between respondents’ age and their answers,
and found that younger respondents scored
significantly higher on the general emotional
distress scale (Fig. 4a-b; Kendall’s correlation
coefficient with Bonferroni correction for
multiple comparisons: n=4,641; Tau=-0.2;
p<1e-86), and on the COVID-19 infection
concern scale (Fig. 4a,c; n=4,641; Tau=-0.11;
p<1e-25). This reduction in concern with age
may seem counterintuitive, in light of the
significantly increased risk for complications
among older COVID-19 patients20, but it is
consistent with several previous studies6,11,21.

contrast with all other types of concern and
distress, older respondents scored higher on
the national-global concern scale (Fig. 4a,d;

the separation of these concerns into discrete
factors.

Currently unemployed respondents (both
since before and due to the pandemic)
reported significantly higher emotional
distress and a significantly higher number of
stress-related symptoms compared to
currently employed respondents (see statistics
in Fig. 5a,d). Moreover, respondents who were
terminated or on leave due to COVID-19
reported using significantly more stress-coping
strategies compared to respondents who were
either currently working or unemployed since
before the pandemic (see statistics in Fig. 5e).
In accordance with our age-related findings,
the retired group reported significantly lower
levels of emotional distress and concern about
COVID-19 infection, and a significantly lower
number of stress-related symptoms compared
to all the other subgroups (see pairwise
comparisons in Fig 5a-b, d). Retired
respondents also reported using the lowest
number of stress-coping strategies, but this
difference was only statistically significant
compared with respondents who were
terminated or on-leave due to COVID-19 (see
statistics in Fig. 5e). Taken together, these
results may exemplify the roles employment
plays in providing both financial security, social
support, and better self-esteem25, which
ultimately influence emotional state.

have the same frequency, a stark contrast to
the matrices we obtained (Fig. 4b-f). Taken
together, these analyses reveal that the
pandemic may be affecting younger people’s
mental and emotional states more severely.

Employment status is associated with
reported distress
As the pandemic influenced the stability of
working places22–24, we assessed the
association
between
respondents’
employment status and their emotional
response to the pandemic. We divided the
respondents into four groups: (1) respondents
who are currently working (n=2,546); (2)
respondents who lost their job due to COVID19 (either termination of employment (ToE), or
on paid or unpaid leave, or forced retirement;
n=700); (3) respondents who were
unemployed since before the pandemic
(n=405); and (4) respondents who were retired
since before the pandemic (n=1,131).
Comparing the responses between these four
subgroups revealed several interesting
findings: First, work status was significantly
associated with general emotional distress,
COVID-19 infection concern, stress-related
symptoms, and coping strategies. Nationalglobal concern was the only scale that did not
significantly associate with work status (Fig. 5;

High city socioeconomic status is
associated with lower reported distress

national-global concern scale (Fig. 5a,d;
n=4,009; Tau=0.032; p=0.0164) and using
exercising or meditating as a coping strategy
(Mann-Whitney U test with Bonferroni
correction for multiple comparisons; Supp. Fig.
5; n=4,088; U=0.535; p=0.001).
To visualize this relationship in detail, we
divided the respondents into five equally sized
subgroups according to their CSS, and the
continuous responses (general emotional
distress, COVID-19 infection concern and
national-global concern scales) into five groups
according to extent quintiles, and plotted the
frequency of each pair of CSS-response groups
(fig. 5b-f; see Methods for details). Similar to
the age plots, under the null hypothesis, we
would expect all matrix cells to have a similar
frequency, which was not the case here.

Socioeconomic status is a strong predictor of
health outcomes, and is generally associated
with distress and with prevalence of mental
health problems26. To evaluate the association
between the respondents’ socioeconomic
status and their emotional response to the
pandemic, and since we did not have details
about the respondents’ income, we used their
city socioeconomic score (CSS). The CSS is
provided by the Israeli Central Bureau of
Statistics (cbs.gov.il), who scores all cities,
towns and other incorporated settlements in
Israel from 1 to 255, with higher numbers
corresponding to higher status. We first
quantified
the
correlation
between
respondents’ CSS and their responses. We
found that respondents with lower CSS
reported significantly higher levels of
emotional distress (Fig. 5a-b; Kendall’s
correlation coefficient with Bonferroni
correction for multiple comparisons: n=4,009;
Tau=-0.041; p=7.9e-4), and using more stresscoping strategies (Fig. 5a,f; n=4,081; Tau=0.033;
p=0.026).
More
specifically,
respondents with lower CSS reported more
frequently that they drew strength from belief
in god (Supp. Fig. 5; Mann-Whitney U test with
Bonferroni
correction
for
multiple
comparisons; n=4,088; U=0.29; p<1e-10), and
approached a family member or a friend for
support (Supp. Fig. 5; n=4,088; U=0.45;
p=0.005), but less frequently that they
exercised or meditated (Supp. Fig. 5; n=4,088;
U=0.54; p=0.001). Moreover, although
respondents with lower CSS did not report
experiencing more stress-related symptoms
overall, they were significantly more likely to
report experiencing difficulty breathing
(Mann-Whitney U test with Bonferroni
correction for multiple comparisons; Supp. Fig.

higher CSS was positively correlated with the

Respondents
with
prior
medical
conditions report elevated concern about
contracting COVID-19 but reduced
general distress
Various medical conditions may increase the
risk for complications of COVID-1927,28.
Therefore, we explored whether having such
prior
medical
conditions
influenced
respondents’ emotional distress. As expected,
respondents with at least one prior medical
condition worry more about contracting
COVID-19 (Fig. 7a; Mann-Whitney U test with
Bonferroni
correction
for
multiple
comparisons; n=4,162 respondents reported
whether or not they had each of the
conditions; n=1,568 respondents had at least
one condition; U=0.57; p<1e-10). However, to

lower levels of distress on the general
emotional distress scale (Fig. 7a; U=0.46;
p=2.3e-5), were less worried about people
close to them contracting COVID-19 (Fig. 7a;

reduced worry about contracting COVID-19 or
with elevated general emotional distress. We
did not find an association between any of
these medical conditions and worrying about
the national or global situation. Taken
together, these analyses demonstrate that
people with certain prior medical conditions
that might increase the risk for complications
of COVID-19 are more worried about
contracting COVID-19, but are nevertheless
less emotionally distressed in general.

COVID-19 (Fig. 8a; U=0.56; p=0.071), as well as

(Fig. 8a; U=0.57; p=7.2e-3) and using more

Next, we examined the extent to which
activities and symptoms related specifically to
COVID-19 were associated with reported
distress. These include behaviours or habits
meant to reduce one’s risk of contracting
COVID-19, such as wearing a mask and/or
gloves, and behaviours which increase the risk
of contracting COVID-19 through social
contact, such as meeting people face to face
and using public transport. First, we found that

respondents had met is associated with their
reported distress. Notably, these encounters
likely included various types (e.g., meeting
family and friends, colleagues or strangers).
We found that respondents who reported
meeting face-to-face with more people under
the age of 18 during the past day reported
significantly higher levels of general emotional
distress (Fig. 8c; n=4,087; Tau=0.05; p=6.6e-5)
and worrying about people close to them
contracting COVID-19 (Fig. 8c; Tau=0.06; p=4e5), but reduced national-global concern (Fig.
8c; Tau=-0.03; p=0.022). In contrast,
respondents who reported meeting with more
people over the age of 18 did not report higher
levels of general emotional distress (Fig. 8c;
Tau=0.002; p>0.9), or of worrying about
people close to them contracting COVID-19
(Fig. 8c; Tau=5.7e-4; p>0.9). However, they did
report significantly lower levels of both
worrying about themselves contracting the
virus (Fig. 8c; Tau=-0.04; p=0.01) and of
national-global concern (Fig. 8c; Tau=-0.04;
p=1.5e-3), as well as using fewer stress-coping
strategies (Fig. 8c; Tau=-0.05; p=1.8e-4).

stress-coping strategies (Fig. 8a; U=0.59;
p=6.6e-4).
Second, we found that respondents who
reported always wearing gloves, also reported
significantly lower levels of general emotional
distress
(Fig.
8b;
ngloves_always=111;
ngloves_not_always=1,397; U=0.37; p=6.3e-5), but a
nearly significantly higher level of concern
specifically about contracting COVID-19 (Fig.
8b; U=0.57; p=0.077). We found similar trends
for mask-wearing, but these effects were
slightly smaller (general emotional distress
scale: nmask always=960; nmask_not_always=549;
U=0.46; p=0.066; contracting COVID-19:
U=0.53; p=0.07). Of note, wearing a mask in
Israel has been mandatory since April 4th,
while wearing gloves has never been a
mandatory requirement, which may explain
the difference in both the effect sizes and the
sizes of their confidence intervals.
Third, since social relationships are associated
with better physical and mental health29,30 and
better coping with stressful situations31, but
may also increase the risk of contracting
COVID-19, as previously mentioned, we
examined whether the number of people

We further examined the reports of
respondents who are potentially at higher risk
for contracting COVID-19, namely, being in
quarantine, tested for COVID-19, or
experiencing COVID-19 related symptoms.
Respondents who reported being in
quarantine (due to contact with patients,
returning from abroad, having symptoms, or
voluntarily isolating oneself) also report
significantly higher levels of worrying about
contracting COVID-19 (Fig. 8d; nquarantine=181;
nnot_quarantine=3,964; U=0.58; p=0.001) and of
the national-global concern scale (Fig. 8d;
U=0.57; p=0.018). Furthermore, respondents
who reported being tested for COVID-19
reported significantly higher levels of general
emotional distress (Fig. 8e; ntested=120;
nnot_tested=3,967; U=0.59; p=0.003) and
experiencing more stress-related symptoms
(Fig. 8e; U=0.61; p=3.1e-6).
Finally,
respondents
who
reported
experiencing common symptoms of COVID-19
(see Methods for the full list of symptoms and
the score used here) also reported significantly
higher levels of general emotional distress (Fig.
8f; n=4,087; Tau=0.14; p<1e-10), worrying
about themselves and their close ones
contracting COVID-19 (Fig. 8f; themselves:
Tau=0.09; p=3.3e-10; close ones: Tau=0.10;
p<1e-10), and more stress-related symptoms
(Tau=0.21; p<1e-10). Notably, difficulty
breathing may result from both stress and
COVID-19 sickness, and therefore appears in
both questionnaires, which likely contributes
to this strong association between both types
of symptoms.

end of the first outbreak and the beginning of
the second one in Israel. We used clinically
validated instruments (BSI-18, PSS, COPE) to
assess symptoms and coping strategies, and
questions specifically designed to assess
COVID-19-related concerns. As expected, in
reaction to stressful events, people reported a
variety of concerns, mainly related to their
close surroundings (their country and
relatives). These non-self-centred concerns
may reflect an increased sense of belonging to
the country/community. Non-self-centred
concerns were reported during the pandemic
outbreak in the United States17 and also during
other times of threat in Israel32.
Despite the reported concerns, the anxietyand depression-related responses (based on
the BSI-18 anxiety and depression subscales)
are similar to the Israeli norm, based on a
nationwide representative sample of 510
community respondents between the ages of
35 and 65 years14, and are lower compared
with Israelis’ scores during war years33. This
may be due to sampling at a stage at which the
pandemic was mostly well controlled, with low
number of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Of
note, the normal levels of the anxiety and
depression subscales of the BSI assessed in a
representative Israeli sample were still higher
than the normal levels in the USA and UK at the
time14. Another important point to consider is
that our research sample may not accurately
represent the general Israeli population: The
percentage of respondents with academic
education and the average CSS are higher
compared to the general population (70% vs.
50.2%, and 187.06 vs. 132.7 respectively34).
Given the negative correlation we found
between CSS and emotional distress (Fig. 6a-

were similar in their levels of emotional
distress to those who were unemployed since
before the pandemic (Fig. 5a-d). The utilization
of more coping strategies by the newly
unemployed (Fig. 5e) may also reflect higher
levels of distress in this group, which are not
shared by those who were unemployed before
the pandemic.

b), this may explain the relatively low levels of
emotional distress in this cohort (Supp. Fig. 1).
Even though levels of general emotional
distress were similar to the norm, our study
describes the inequalities in mental-health
burden associated with the COVID-19
pandemic. As shown, higher emotional burden
is associated with being female, younger,
unemployed, and living in places with low
socioeconomic status. Our findings add to the
reported gender differences that were
assessed during the COVID-19 outbreak phase
in China and in the United States4,17. It is
interesting to compare our findings to those of
the UK COVID-19 social study35,36: The number
of COVID-19 cases during the outbreak was
much higher in the UK compared to Israel;
therefore, it is not surprising that contracting
COVID-19 remains the most prevalent concern
in the UK, and was a lesser concern in Israel.
However, despite these differences, in both
populations being younger and having lower
socioeconomic status correlated with
increased emotional distress. The level of
community
resources
may
influence
individuals’ ability to cope with life challenges,
and low socioeconomic places of living,
characterized by fewer resources, were found
to be more vulnerable in Israel37,38 in
agreement with the conservation of resources
theory39.

Throughout our analysis, we observe a high
accordance between the levels of emotional
distress, the number of stress-related
symptoms, and the number of stress-coping
strategies (Figures 3a, 4a, 6a, 7a, 8b,f). This
may suggest that employing multiple stresscoping strategies is a sign of inefficient coping,
and/or that using multiple strategies is
characteristic of highly emotionally disturbed
individuals. It would be interesting to
investigate whether assessing the coping
strategies people use could be used to predict
their level of distress.
In summary, although we cannot say what is
considered a "normal” response to this new
reality, in our research sample the prevalent
emotional response to the pandemic was low
compared to previous challenging times in
Israel. Still, our findings highlight the
importance of biological and environmental
differences for understanding individuals’
ability to cope with the challenges posed by
the pandemic. Such considerations should
inform planning and policy for the following
waves of the pandemic. In light of the dramatic
increase in COVID-19 cases and the
unprecedented social-economic crisis that
Israel and the rest of the world are
experiencing, it is of great importance to
continue to investigate the long-term mentalhealth effects of the pandemic and its
consequences.

Employment instability can have devastating
effects on the psychological, economic, and
social well-being of individuals and
communities40,41. Despite the importance of
this topic during crises42, many open questions
remain, especially in the context of the COVID19 pandemic. In our research sample, the
people who lost their job due to the pandemic

were partly based on the anxiety and
depression subscales of the brief symptom
inventory 18 (BSI-18) and the perceived stress
scale (PSS; see full survey description in the
methods section and Supp. Fig. 2). Additional
questions were designed to assess reasons for
concern specifically related to the COVID-19
pandemic, specific stress-related physiological
symptoms experienced and stress-coping
strategies taken from the brief-COPE
questionnaire15. Responses were collected in
six common languages in Israel (Hebrew,
Arabic, English, Russian, French and Spanish),

were analyzed here. The latest version of this

Visualizing the association between two
ordinal variables

Statistical analyses

Since both our independent and dependent
ordinal
variables
(e.g.,
stress-related
responses, age, city socioeconomic status) had
numerous repeated values, heatmaps were
used instead of scatter plots to visualize their
relationships. The data were divided into five
equally numerous bins whenver possible (i.e.,
whenever
distinct
quintiles
existed).
Otherwise, wherever no distinct quintiles
existed (e.g., for the number of reported
stress-related symptoms in Fig. 3e), the raw
values were used. We chose to use five bins
whenever possible to match the number of
possible responses in most of our questions.
Under the null hypothesis – that the variables
are statistically independent – all heatmap
cells are expected to have roughly the same
frequency (f = n/d, where n = number of
responses and d = number of heatmap cells),
which makes it very straightforward to
examine visually. Importantly, the correlation
coefficients and the corresponding p-values
and confidence intervals were quantified using
the raw data, i.e., without any binning (see
‘Methods - Statistical analyses’).

Statistical analyses were performed using
Matlab (v.2019b, MathWorks) and R (v-4.0.2).
All statistical hypothesis tests are two-tailed
and non-parametric, not assuming normality
of the marginal or joint distributions of the
variables. Bonferroni’s correction for multiple
comparisons was used whenever multiple
comparisons were made. Unless explicitly
stated otherwise, statistical analyses were
done based on each respondent’s first
response, to ensure the basic assumption of
independent samples. The term “statistically
significant” was used when p<0.05, following
the common convention, but p-values are
always shown rounded by at most 5e-4.
For the Mann-Whitney statistic, we denote
U=Pr[X<Y]+0.5 Pr[X=Y], where X and Y are
randomly chosen observations from the two
distributions. Thus, U=1 and U=0 represent
complete separation of the distributions, while
U=0.5 represents complete overlap. The U
statistic and its corresponding p-values and
confidence intervals were calculated using the
‘wmwTest’ function of the ‘asht’ package in
R45. Odds ratios and their corresponding pvalues and confidence intervals were
calculated using the ‘oddsratio’ function of the
‘epitools’ package in R46 with Fisher’s exact
conditional maximum likelihood estimation
option. The Kendall rank correlation coefficient
(commonly known as Kendall’s Tau) and its
corresponding p-values were calculated using
the Matlab ‘corr’ function and its
corresponding confidence intervals were
calculated using bootstrapping with the
Matlab ‘bootci’ function and the ‘bias
corrected and accelerated percentile’
method47,48.

COVID-19 symptoms score (SRt)
The COVID-19 symptoms score used here was
previously described in detail49. Briefly, this
score aims to reflect the importance of each
symptom with respect to its prevalence in
confirmed COVID-19 patients, as previously
reported50. The symptoms included in the
score calculation were: fever (79% of
confirmed COVID-19 patients), shortness of
breath (3.5%), cough (58%), fatigue (29.3%),
muscle pain (3.8%), sore throat (3.2%),
headache (6%) and diarrhea (5.7%).
