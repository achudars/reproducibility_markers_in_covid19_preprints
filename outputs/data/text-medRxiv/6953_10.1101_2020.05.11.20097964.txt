Abstract
The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) spatial distribution in Italy is inhomogeneous, because
of its ways of spreading from the initial hotspots. The impact of COVID-19 on mortality has been
described at the regional level, while less is known about mortality in demographic subgroups
within municipalities.
We aimed to describe the excess mortality (EM) due to COVID-19 in the three most affected Italian
regions, by estimating EM in subgroups defined by gender and age classes within each
municipality from February 23 to March 31, 2020.
EM varied widely among municipalities even within the same region; it was similar between
genders for the ≥75 age group, while in the other age groups it was higher in males. Thus, nearby
municipalities may show a different mortality burden despite being under common regional health
policies, possibly as a result of policies adopted both at the regional and at the municipality level.

1. Introduction
As of May 10, 2020, 4,051,431 confirmed cases and 279,734 deaths of Coronavirus Disease 2019
(COVID-19), a respiratory infectious disease caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), were reported worldwide, affecting 187 countries (Center for
Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University (JHU), 2020). Among
Western countries, Italy was the first affected. The first case of local transmission of COVID-19
was confirmed in a 38-year-old man in the municipality of Codogno (Lombardy region) on February
20, 2020 (Zangrillo et al., 2020), while on February 21, a resident of Vo’, a small town near Padua
(Veneto region), died of pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 infection (Crisanti and Cassone, 2020;
Lavezzo et al., 2020). On February 23, the Italian government created two red zones confining ten
towns including Codogno and the town of Vo’, quarantining 50,000 people.
Despite these containment measures, SARS-CoV-2 rapidly spread not only in the Lombardy and
Veneto region, but also in some areas of the bordering Emilia Romagna region. It became clear
that, without appropriate measures, SARS-CoV-2 would have spread dangerously all over Italy.
This prospect convinced the government to lockdown the whole country on March 10, 2020, when
confirmed cases were 10,149 and 631 deaths (Italian Civil Protection Department, 2020). At first,
commercial activities were closed, but some productive ones were allowed to stay open. On March
22, the government closed all productive activities, except for those necessary to produce
essential goods. As of May 10, 2020, official cases in Italy are 219.070 (Italian Civil Protection
Department, 2020), while deaths from COVID-19 reached 30.560. The COVID-19 had an
extremely varied distribution in Italy, because of its ways of spreading and of geographical
differences in population density, distribution of healthcare facilities, presence of care and nursing
homes and locally defined strategies to contain/mitigate its spreading. As a matter of fact, in Italy,
regions must provide the so called “Essential Levels of Care” (i.e. the core benefit package and
standard of health services), set by the central government, through the Regional Health Service
(RHS), but they are responsible and autonomous for the local organization and delivery of health
care (Lenzi et al., 2013). In each region, the municipalities followed the general indications given
by the Regional Government, but with different scaling up strategies at the local level.
Deaths from COVID-19 as reported by official data may be underestimated because of various
factors, among which the classification of cause of death when the deceased suffered from other
pre-existing conditions and the absence of post-mortem testing among those who have died before
they could be swabbed. For this reason, the most reliable method to estimate COVID-19 related
mortality to date is to calculate the excess all-cause mortality occurred during the COVID-19
outbreak compared to all-cause mortality in the same period in the previous years.
The Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT), called on by researchers and local
administrators, promptly released and regularly updated the data of confirmed deaths (Italian
Institute for National Statistics (ISTAT), 2020b). The first studies (Colombo and Impicciatore, 2020;
Mancino, 2020) performed on these data reported higher excess mortality mainly in the
municipalities closer to the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak epicenters, such as those in Lombardy. Most of
these studies (Bucci et al., 2020; Buonanno et al., 2020; Modi et al., 2020) aimed to infer excess
mortality at the regional or national level, but all of them had to acknowledge the caveats implied
by relying on incomplete data to draw such predictions. Other studies, utilizing data provided by
the heat waves surveillance systems collected only in a limited number of municipalities (Davoli et
al., 2020), provided conflicting results, without showing a particular excess of mortality.
Importantly, excess mortality is not evenly distributed over the national territory and at the regional
and municipality level (Davoli et al., 2020; Italian Institute for National Statistics (ISTAT), 2020b;
Italian Institute for National Statistics (ISTAT) and Italian Superior Institute of Health, 2020;
Mancino, 2020; ScienzaInRete, 2020). In fact, some municipalities seem to be unaffected by the
epidemic, with a number of deaths equal to or even lower than that related to the same period of
previous years, while in others the number of deaths was estimated between 6 to 10 times higher.
Therefore, the aim of our study is to describe the spatial and demographic distribution of excess
mortality due to COVID-19 in the three most affected Italian regions, by estimating excess mortality
in subgroups defined by gender and age classes within each municipality with available data.

2. Methods
We conducted a longitudinal study using the data provided by the Italian Institute of Statistics
(ISTAT) on May 4, 2020, which include the number of deaths available for 6,866 Italian
municipalities (87.0% out of the 7,904 municipalities) (Italian Institute for National Statistics
(ISTAT), 2020c) divided by gender and age classes in the period from January 1 to March 31 of
the years 2015-2020. The municipalities with available data were 1,439/1,506 (95.8%) in
Lombardy, 490/563 (87.0%) in Veneto and 295/328 (89.9%) in Emilia-Romagna.
Excess mortality (EM) was estimated for each municipality in six subgroups defined by gender and
three age classes consistent with data provided by ISTAT (0-64, 65-74 and ≥75 years) in the time
period from February 23, 2020 to March 31, 2020, corresponding to the EPidemic Period (EPP). In
each subgroup a simple linear regression was conducted on the observed deaths from 2015 to
2019; the constant and slope obtained were used to estimate by extrapolation the expected
number of deaths in 2020. The ratio of observed to expected death is the relative mortality (RM)
experienced by each subgroup and the corresponding excess mortality is obtained by subtracting
1 from the RM and multiplying this value by 100. To avoid obtaining a negative expected number
of deaths, which might happen in the smallest municipalities, we set to 1 each prediction ≤0.
Moreover, taking into account that 2020 is a leap year we corrected estimates by dividing for a
coefficient of 1.022.
To summarize the impact of COVID-19, we reported for each age and gender subgroup how many
municipalities showed an excess mortality (separating those under +50%, which could include also
not anomalous increases of mortality, from those over +50%) and how many showed a lower
mortality in the EPP.

27

Lastly, relative mortality ratios were applied to choropleth maps (Pisati, 2007) of the three Italian
regions considered, in order to visually identify the areas that suffered the greatest burden of
COVID-19 mortality during the epidemic and the municipalities where a reduction in mortality was
observed. We drew side by side regional maps of two age groups (0-64, ≥75 years) to visually
check the RM differences.

28

All analyses were carried out using Stata v.15.1 (StataCorp; College Station, TX, USA).

3. Results
Relative mortality during the COVID-19 outbreak exhibited a very composite pattern among the
three examined regions, and between age classes and genders (Table 1). Generally, Lombardy
experienced the highest burden of mortality, and Veneto the lowest. In the three regions, females
displayed an excess mortality only among those aged ≥75 years. Males in age groups 65-74 and
≥75 had excess mortality in the three regions, except for the age group 65-74 in Veneto.
People aged ≥75 years had the highest excess mortality. In Lombardy, this excess was +170% for
males and +146% for females, in Emilia-Romagna +123% for males and +104% for females; in
Veneto +35% for males and +37% for females. While among people aged ≥75, EM was quite
similar between males and females, in the other two age classes it was higher in males. For
instance, in the 65-74 age group the EM of males was almost twofold compared to females in
Lombardy and Emilia Romagna.

3.1. Municipality level
In Lombardy, males aged ≥75 experienced an EM in 60.3% of municipalities, compared to the
previous five years, while in the remaining 39.7% no EM was observed (Table 2).
In Emilia-Romagna the proportion of municipalities with EM was similar to that of Lombardy (64.4%
of municipalities, males ≥75 years) while in Veneto it was lower (40.6%). These figures were
similar for females aged ≥75. As illustrated in Table 2, in most of the municipalities no EM was
found for males and females in the age groups 0-64 and 65-74.

Concerning individual municipalities (Supplementary materials), the highest EM was estimated in
Brembate di Sopra (10 km from Bergamo, in Lombardy) in males aged ≥75 (+4,600%), with 47
deaths occurred against 1 expected.
In the major towns, Parma (Emilia-Romagna) displayed a +633% EM in males aged 65-74;
Bergamo (Lombardy) +551% EM in males aged ≥75, +409% EM in males aged 65-74 and +368%
EM in females aged ≥75; Piacenza (Emilia-Romagna) had +491% EM in males ≥75. The regional
capitals Venezia (Veneto) and Bologna (Emilia-Romagna) experienced EM rates generally below
+50%. On the contrary, Milano (Lombardy) had an EM of +166% in males aged 65-74 and an EM
between +56% and +76% in the other groups except for females aged 0-64 with +4%.
Examination of the Lombardy map for men aged ≥75 (Figure 1) confirmed that the municipalities of
Bergamo, Brescia, Cremona and Lodi provinces, corresponding to the central and eastern part of
the region, experienced the highest EM. The “green” municipalities with a mortality reduction are
mainly located in the peripheral areas of the region which are more distant and less connected to
the epidemic epicenters. In men aged 0-64 this pattern is less visible, because most municipalities
did not experience an EM for this age group. Differently from Lombardy, a geographical pattern of
epidemic spread for males aged ≥75 is not clearly visible in Veneto (Figure 2), as municipalities
with EM seem to be scattered in different areas, intertwined with “green zones”. Moreover, in men
aged 0-64 very few municipalities displayed an EM. The western Verona province, bordering
Lombardy, was not the most hit by mortality within the region. From these maps we can argue that
Veneto successfully isolated itself from the potential epidemic flow coming from the nearby region.

As for the Emilia-Romagna region (Figure 3), it is evident for both age groups an EM north-south
gradient from the area bordering the Lodi and Cremona provinces of Lombardy, following the
trajectory of the main regional route that connects almost all the major regional centers. Moreover,
one local hotspot of COVID-19 can be seen in the east of the region, spreading from the
municipality of Medicina, and another local critical area might be noticed in the southernmost
municipalities, bordering the Pesaro province of the Marche region, where another known hotspot
was located. Similarly to Lombardy and Veneto, EM in the ≥75 age group was remarkably higher
than in the 0-64 age group.

Comparing the epidemic period with the first five weeks of the year, in the large majority of
municipalities of Lombardy and Emilia-Romagna, and to a lesser extent in Veneto, mortality in
2020 before the COVID-19 outbreak was lower than expected (data not shown). This trend has
been observed in many countries worldwide (EuroMOMO, 2020).

4. Discussion
In this study we found that excess mortality due to COVID-19 in Italy has an inhomogeneous
spatial and demographic distribution in the most affected regions of Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna
and Veneto, and within each region between the different municipalities.
Our study highlighted that COVID-19 related EM was similar between males and females for the
≥75 age group, while in the other age groups it was higher in males. Whether SARS-CoV-2 has a
higher rate of severe clinical manifestations and mortality among older people will be clarified when
more studies on the characteristics of patients will be available. However increasing age and preexisting conditions such as diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular diseases could play an important
role (Onder et al., 2020; Italian Superior Institute of Health, 2020).
The spread of COVID-19 epidemic clearly originated from specific areas and initially affected the
surrounding municipalities. The epidemic was spread by individuals living in a community, and
circulated across the regions through the main commercial and commuting routes, as suggested
by other analyses (Adnkronos, 2020; Gloria, 2020; Golinelli et al., 2020; Sebastiani, 2020). Some
areas distant from the principal epicenters most likely benefited from the lockdown measures
enforced nationwide before the epidemic spread could massively reach them.
The different RHS organizations must be taken into account when analyzing the responses to the
epidemic. Lombardy has a Regional Health System based on a strong hospital-centered approach,
with many excellences in secondary and tertiary care. The Veneto region has a RHS with a solid
primary care level; Emilia-Romagna is somewhere in between, but its health care system is more
similar to the one in Veneto (Cicchetti et al., 2020). When SARS-CoV-2 started spreading in the
town of Vo’, the RHS in Veneto and the policies adopted at the regional and local level allowed the
region to quickly react. Adopting mainly a community based approach, a multitude of actions were
taken at once: the municipality of Vo’ was immediately declared a red zone, massive testing (even
if at the beginning of the outbreak test capacity is usually low (Ruan, 2020), isolation of cases,
rapid contact tracing. In Vo’, all people, also the asymptomatic, were tested (Crisanti and Cassone,
2020; Lavezzo et al., 2020). Importantly, Veneto largely relied on home care assistance, limiting
hospital admissions to the most severe cases and started early testing of the healthcare workers
operating in the community and in the hospitals. In Emilia-Romagna, the community-based
approach was used to contrast the epidemic as well, but Piacenza, where the first outbreak of the
region was registered, originating from the nearby hotspot of Codogno, still remains one of the
most affected municipalities in Italy. Probably the virus had already extensively spread when the
first case was found, and the community services were not equipped to promptly react, being
overwhelmed by the high volumes of contemporary cases. Also, it could be that the municipality
was not quickly declared a red zone, when there was the suspicion that the number of cases still
undetected might have been dangerously high. Nevertheless, the RHS was able to adapt and
started being more effective in mitigating the spread of the virus, following the same approach
used by Veneto, particularly leaning towards home care assistance and relying on general
practitioners to implement an active surveillance system among their patients with phone calls to
monitor their symptoms.
On the contrary, the organizational structure of the RHS in Lombardy that promotes a hospital
centered approach at the expenses of the community-based services, may have contributed to
exacerbate the criticalities presented by COVID-19. Thereto, the region did not address the
outbreak adopting the same plan in municipality experiencing similar circumstances: while the

towns around Lodi were quickly declared red zones when the first cases were identified, thus
containing the spread of the virus, the outbreak of the virus in a hospital in the province of
Bergamo, didn’t lead to the establishment of a confinement, that was implemented only when the
national lockdown was enforced (De Luca, 2020). This contributed to make the Bergamo area one
of the most hit areas in Europe. Especially at the beginning of the epidemic, most people were
admitted to hospitals. The dramatic flow of patients saturated the intensive care units, forcing
doctors to decide who could go forward (Rosenbaum, 2020). In the hospital setting, the virus was
spread not only by patients, but also by healthcare workers, who could not always rely on
appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) risking their lives while doing their job.
Analyzing the deaths’ toll in Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia-Romagna, we argue that the best way
to address epidemics is through proactive medicine at a community-based level, opposite to
reactive medicine at a hospital level. Moreover, to foster discussions and more in depth analysis
on the EM due to COVID-19 infections, we hypothesized several factors that could have equally
affected the infections and mortality in the three regions: household transmission, which led to the
most vulnerable being exposed when a family member got the infection; congestion of the
healthcare system; late diagnosis of the healthcare workers for COVID-19; limited number of
executed swabs; inadequate contact tracing; public transportation; inadequate community based
interventions.
At the regional level, the difference in adopted strategies certainly reflects different RHS’s
organization and operational approaches. In tackling the epidemic, the Veneto and Lombardy
regions adopted two opposite strategies regarding, for example, the recommendations on testing.
As of March 31, Veneto performed 21.6 swabs per 1,000 population (4,905,854 inhabitants) and,
whenever possible, tested also asymptomatic people; Lombardy (10,060,574 inhabitants)
performed 11.3 swabs per 1,000 population, testing mainly patients with more severe clinical
symptoms, as instructed by the Italian Ministry of Health in that moment. On this topic, Emilia
Romagna had a more similar approach to Lombardy, performing 12.2 swabs per 1,000 population
on a total population of 4,459,477 inhabitants (Italian Civil Protection Department, 2020; Italian
Institute for National Statistics (ISTAT), 2020a; Onder et al., 2020).
At the local level, the reason of higher COVID-19 mortality in some specific municipalities can be
debated, as several different causes other than the distance from the hotspots or a possible bias in
estimation or some casual local factors might be involved. Possible explanations for a marked
difference in excess mortality between close municipalities could be the presence of gathering
places (i.e. sport venues, cinemas), or of some industrial/commercial activities, care and nursing
homes or of particular events that may have taken place before the lockdown. In the municipality
of Medicina (Emilia Romagna), a gathering at a bowls club was the cause of the rapid spread of
the virus; almost all the people present got infected, and all but one died. Medicina immediately
became a red zone (Regione Emilia-Romagna, 2020), successfully narrowing the afflicted area.
This demonstrates that it is important to contrast the spread of the virus at the smallest possible
level and in the most accurate possible way.
Several municipalities showed a lower increase of COVID-19 related deaths or even a reduced
mortality. This can be likely attributed to a smaller incidence of deaths for causes such as
accidents or occupational injuries, favored by the lockdown. On the other hand, the high mortality
figures especially for people aged ≥75 may also have been favored by the lower incidence of
influenza observed this year in Italy, compared to last year, which left more elderly people exposed
to COVID-19 (Bella, 2020).
Our study suggests that the difference in the response to the epidemic can be the result of policies
adopted both at the regional and at the municipality level. Most of the studies conducted on this
epidemic (Bucci et al., 2020; Buonanno et al., 2020; Modi et al., 2020; ScienzaInRete, 2020) have
tried to explain its course considering the regional policies, as so did we, but, as an added value, in
the present study we explored also the pattern of the epidemic within regions and noticed that, net
of regional policies, even nearby municipalities showed different excess mortality rates.
Accordingly, the causes of such differences should be sought not only at the national and the
regional policies, but also in local factors which cannot be brought to light if data are analyzed as
regional or higher aggregates. Therefore, focusing on the regional and municipality level could be
11

more helpful than a regional level analysis alone and we advocate that our approach may help to
shed some light on the areas where the death toll was highest and thus trigger further
investigations on some specific/local dynamics of the outbreak.
Our study presents some caveats. First, it is based on incomplete territorial coverage, therefore
our conclusions could have been partially different if data for all municipalities was available.
However, our data cover >87% of Italian municipalities, which is a relevant coverage. We used
linear regression to derive a mortality trend from 5 years, which could not always be adequate as it
may be leveraged by anomalous mortality figures in the first or in the last year of the time interval
used for prediction. By using linear regression, we intended to capture a trend in mortality where it
exists, and in these cases its prediction is more accurate than the projection of the average
mortality observed in the previous five years. In addition, we reduced potential confounding by
estimating excess mortality within subgroups defined by age class and gender. Nevertheless, our
results should be considered as provisional estimates until official data of verified quality covering
all municipalities will be released and made available to researchers for further investigations.

5. Conclusions
Our approach could be used to generate or to confirm hypotheses regarding the flow of epidemics
starting from the main originating sites, and to detect affected loci that are distant from these initial
affected areas. Analyses are fundamental at the regional and subregional level. Identifying the
municipalities where the mortality burden was higher, and the pathways used by the virus to
spread may help to concentrate efforts in understanding the reasons why this happened and to
identify the frailest areas in case of the occurrence of a second epidemic outbreak. Whether higher
excess mortality depended on lack of preparedness, or on a particularly old age structure, or on
inefficacy in the enforcement of containment measures, this should lead to different types of
interventions in the preparation of a possible second wave of COVID-19.
The phase of coexistence with the virus will be as challenging as the phase of the outbreak. An
adequate organization of the health services is imperative.
Our study demonstrates that nearby municipalities within each region may show highly different
mortality levels, despite being under common regional health policies, therefore further studies are
necessary to analyze more in depth the local determinants of COVID-19 spread.
