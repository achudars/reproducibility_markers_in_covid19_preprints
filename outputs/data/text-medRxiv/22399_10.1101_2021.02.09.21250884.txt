ABSTRACT
Objective: Determine the CALL SCORE's diagnostic accuracy for the prediction of
ICU admission and death in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia in a
reference hospital in Peru.
Methods: We performed an analytical cross-sectional observational study. We included
patients with COVID-19 pneumonia treated at the "Dos de Mayo" National Hospital.
Patients over 18 years old with a diagnosis confirmed by rapid or molecular testing
were included. Those with an incomplete, illegible, or missing medical history and/or
bacterial or fungal pneumonia were excluded. Data were extracted from medical
records. The primary outcomes were mortality and admission to the ICU. The Call
Score was calculated for each patient (4 to 13 points) and classified into three risk
groups. Summary measures were presented for qualitative and quantitative variables.
The area under the model curve and the operational characteristics (sensitivity,
specificity) were calculated for the best cut-off point.
Results: The Call Score reported an area under the curve of 0.59 (IC95%: 0.3 to 0.07),
p = 0.43 for predicting death. However, for a cut-off point of 5.5, a sensitivity of 87%
and a specificity of 65% were obtained. The area under the curve for ICU admission
was 0.67 (95%CI: 0.3 to 0.07), p = 0.43; the 5.5 cut-off point showed a sensitivity of
82% and a specificity of 51%.
Conclusions: The Call Score shows a low performance for predicting mortality and
admission to the ICU in Peruvian patients.

INTRODUCTION
The new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) has generated a global health crisis
that has placed international public health in great danger[1]. Worldwide, 44 358 000
confirmed cases are reported, of which approximately 1 174 624 people have died from
the disease[2]. Peru is no stranger to this problem; currently, approximately 891,000
new cases have been estimated in the country, with a total of 34,197 deaths[2]. To date,
the SARS-CoV-2 infection continues to spread, and newly infected people grow every
day, despite the isolation and quarantine measures established worldwide.
As the pandemic grows, we acknowledge that comorbidities such as obesity, arterial
hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus are risk factors and essential predictors for
severity and death in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia[3,4]. Based on those
mentioned above and due to the need for a more practical, rapid, and valid approach,
different clinical prediction rules have been developed. However, most are based on
complex calculations with measurements of variables that we do not have in our country
[5,6].
The CALL SCORE was developed in China, a clinical tool based on four variables that
facilitate patient decision-making with COVID-19 to achieve a practical and valid
clinical prediction tool[3]. However, it is not validated for Latin American populations;
its performance has only been evaluated in the Italian population with important results.
It is crucial to evaluate its predictive impact and clinical performance in real clinical
conditions on important outcomes such as mortality and ICU admission. Both, due to
the lack of resources in our society and the need to improve our patients' management
and make an adequate triage of those who require specialized treatment[3].

The objective was to determine the CALL SCORE's diagnostic accuracy for predicting
admission to ICU and death in patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 pneumonia in a
reference hospital in Peru.
METHODS
Study Design
We conducted a retrospective analytical cross-sectional study based on the guidelines of
the STROBE[7] statement. The study was registered in the PRISA database for
observational studies of the National Health Institute of Peru, with the following

Context
It was carried out in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia treated at the "Dos
de Mayo" National Hospital between April to July 2020.
Participants
Patients older than 18 years with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 by rapid or
molecular testing were included, and those with an incomplete, illegible or missing
medical history and/or bacterial or fungal pneumonia were excluded. The patients were
registered in the COVID-19 hospital wards registry book, used as a source for the

sampling frame and sample selection. The patients were selected using a simple random
probability sampling process.
Variables
Death was defined as the passing of the patient during his/her hospital stay. Admission
to the ICU was defined as the patient's admission to the ICU while hospitalized in
COVID-19 wards. The CALL SCORE was calculated with de data taken at the
admission for each patient spanning a range of 4 to 13 points (comorbidity 1-4 points,
age 1-3 points, lymphocytes 1-3 points, LDH 1-3 points). Additional variables such as
sex, age, comorbidities, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and absolute lymphocytes
were included to describe the patients' characteristics.
Data Source
The data were extracted from the medical records of the selected patients and recorded
in a standardized instrument developed based on the study's objectives.
Sample size
We required a minimum of 51 patients (Power 80%, an estimated area under curve 0.76,
and a distribution ratio of 4.6) 6. It was calculated on the page's web application:
http://www.biosoft.hacettepe.edu.tr/easyROC/).
Quantitative variables
The CALL SCORE classifies into three risk groups according to their probabilities of
progression of COVID-19 pneumonia.

→ Class A → Low-risk → probability of progression

<10%.

Statistical methods
Frequencies and percentages were presented for the qualitative and mean variables and
standard deviation for the quantitative variables based on the normality tests (P>0.05).
The area under the model curve and the operational characteristics (sensitivity,
specificity) were calculated for the best cut-off point. 95% confidence intervals (IC95%) were presented. The data were processed in the SPSS statistical software version
20.
RESULTS
Participants
We found 120 patients who were admitted to hospitalization during the study period.
Nevertheless, we included 51 patients to analyze.
Descriptive data
The most frequent gender was male (66.7%; n=34). The mean age was 55.6 ± 15 years.
The most frequent comorbidity was obesity (23.5%; n = 12). The median for LDH and
absolute lymphocytes was 360 mg/dL (range: 208-1054) and 1100 lymphocytes/mm3
(range: 298-5671) respectively. The median Call Score was 6, with a range of 4 to 13.
When they were divided into risk groups based on the CALL SCORE, the most frequent
risk category was low risk (51%; n=26), followed by intermediate risk (33.3%; n = 17)
and high risk (15.7%; n=8), respectively. See Table 1 for the general characteristics of

the patients based on risk groups. A total of 8 patients died, representing 15.7% of the
total. Eleven patients were admitted to the ICU (21.6%).

Main results
The CALL SCORE reported an area under the curve of 0.59 (IC-95%: 0.3 to 0.07),
p=0.43 for predicting death (Figure 1). Nonetheless, for a cut-off point of 5.5, a
sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 65% were obtained. For the prediction of ICU
admission, the area under the curve was 0.67 (IC-95%: 0.3 to 0.07), p=0.43 (Figure 2).
The cut-off point of 5.5 presented a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of 51%.
DISCUSSION
Summary of the main results
The CALL SCORE showed a low performance for predicting mortality and admission
to ICU in Peruvian patients. However, it presented a high sensitivity to predict
admission to ICU and death with a cut-off point of 5.5.
Contrast with the literature
These findings differ from the values reported in the derivation and validation study
carried out in Chinese patients, with an area under the curve of 0.91 (IC95%: 0.86 to
0.94)[3]. Similarly, when the model was evaluated in the Italian population, the CALL
score's predictive power as a predictor of hospital mortality was good (AUC 0.768,
IC95%: 0.705 to 0.823), differing from our result[8]. And in another study conducted in
Pakistan, the call score was strongly associated with progression and mortality in
patients with COVID-19[9]. The results show the importance of evaluating the validity
of the clinical prediction rules developed in other countries for use in our population.

We observe that the performance differs from the two reported populations (China, Italy
and Pakistan) and that its usefulness to evaluate mortality and severity in our country is
limited.
Approximately 20% of COVID-19 patients are reported to develop severe respiratory
illness, with an overall fatality rate of around 2.3%, and are secondary to COVID-19
complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome. (ARDS), respiratory
failure, liver injury, acute myocardial injury, acute kidney injury, septic shock, and even
multiple organ failure[1]. In our study, 21.6% of patients were admitted to the ICU due
to disease severity, and mortality was 15.7%. We did not evaluate the causes of
admission to the ICU as it was not our study objective.
Patients with underlying comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, pre-existing respiratory
infection, cardiovascular disease, and cancer) are more likely to succumb and
experience progression to the more severe forms of COVID-19. They are also at higher
risk of developing complications[10]. In a document carried out by the Unit of Evidence
and Deliberation for Decision Making of the University of Antioquia, they found that
for mortality, severe illness and admission to the ICU, age over 60 years, as well as
cardiovascular disease, arterial hypertension, and diabetes mellitus increase the risk[4].
We found that the most frequent comorbidity was obesity, followed by Diabetes
Mellitus 2 and arterial hypertension, respectively. When classified by risk groups
according to the CALL SCORE, these comorbidities were more frequent in the
intermediate and high groups. Association measures were not performed because it was
not the objective of the study. However, the predominance of these diseases can be
observed in patients with a higher risk of severe disease, consistent with the literature.
As the pandemic has progressed and the disease is more widely known, it is found that
various characteristics, including laboratory results, imaging studies, among others, are

associated with a greater risk of hospitalization, death, or stay in intensive care units[3].
We found that the higher the risk group for the severe disease was, the more frequent
lymphopenia was. However, we did not see the same behavior with elevated LDH.
The CALL SCORE's low performance or clinical validity does not allow adequate
prediction of mortality and admission to the ICU in our population. Apparently, with
scores of 6, screening could be carried out due to the high sensitivity extended to
patients not necessarily hospitalized.
We do not recommend using the CALL SCORE to predict mortality or admission to the
ICU in Peruvian patients. It is probably useful as a screening test due to its high
sensitivity in patients presenting to other services such as the emergency.
Conclusions
The CALL SCORE presents a low clinical performance for predicting mortality and
admission to the ICU in Peruvian patients. We do not recommend its use for the
classification of patients requiring hospital management. The different clinical
prediction rules used in our environment should be evaluated. The study should be
replicated in other establishments and countries in South America.
