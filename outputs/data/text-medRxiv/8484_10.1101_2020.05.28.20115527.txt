Summary: The goal of this analysis is to estimate the effects of the diverse government intervention measures
implemented to mitigate the spread of the Covid-19 epidemic. We use a process model based on a
compartmental epidemiological framework Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Dead (SIRD). Analysis of case data
with such a mechanism-based model has advantages over purely phenomenological approaches because the
parameters of the SIRD model can be calibrated using prior knowledge. This approach can be used to investigate
how governmental interventions have affected the Covid-19-related transmission and mortality rate during the
epidemic.

Introduction
An outbreak of “pneumonia of unknown etiology” detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in early December
2019 has induced a large epidemic in China (Li et al. 2020) and has become a worldwide threat, as it was
declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) (WHO Regional Office for Europe 2020).
The causative, newly emerging, agent was identified as a new betacoronavirus and named Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome virus coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov2), as it is genetically related to the SARS-CoV1 that
emerged in 2003. The SARS-Cov2 associated disease has been named “COVID-19” by the WHO on 11 February
2020 (WHO 2020l).
Similarly, to the SARS-CoV1 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, the SARS-Cov2 is
transmitted from person to person principally by respiratory droplets and induces, in most cases, fever and
respiratory symptoms, such as cough, and shortness of breath. The incubation time (latent period) is estimated
to be between 2 and 14 days. To date few cases have been documented in children (Z. Wu and McGoogan 2020;
Cai et al. 2020).

China implemented very stringent intervention measures in response to the outbreak. On January 23, 2020, a
cordon sanitaire was set around Wuhan (known as the “Wuhan lockdown”). In the following week, the traffic
was suspended, a home quarantine was enforced, all gatherings were prohibited, and wearing a face mask in
public place became mandatory (Berlinger, George, and Kottasová 2020; Cyranoski and Silver 2020). Despite
these draconian intervention measures, the epidemic continued to spread, with the number of new cases per
day reaching a peak in early February and the epidemic was controlled only in March (for a detailed discussion
of Covid-19 in Wuhan, see section Hubei, China below). Later, worldwide, countries have implemented
unprecedented mitigating interventions, before the introduction of the disease on their respective territories
and in response to the increasing number of cases. However, how those interventions affected the transmission
potential of the Covid-19 is still largely unknown.
Predictive mathematical models for epidemics are essential to understand the course of the epidemic and to
inform preparedness and control strategy plans, as the recent Ebola epidemic made clear (Merler et al. 2015). A
paradigmatic mathematical approach to describe and forecast the course of an epidemic is so-called
compartmental models (Brauer 2008). In the simplest case of such models, the population is segmented into
three different subpopulations or compartments: Susceptible, Infected and Recovered (SIR) individuals
(Kermack, McKendrick, and Walker 1927). There is a constant rate at which susceptibles get infected after a
contact; infected people recover with a constant rate. In these models, epidemic outbreaks only end once the
susceptible population has been depleted to a point where one infected on average transmits the disease to less
than one other person, the threshold of “herd immunity.”
There is a bestiary of model variations in which additional compartments are added to the SIR baseline, such as
an exposed state of individuals that have been infected but are not yet infectious themselves, giving a so-called
SEIR model (Liu, Hethcote, and Levin 1987). If individuals become susceptible again after recovering, one has a
SEIRS model, and so forth. A wide range of epidemic growth patterns can be explained by such models by
including more spatial details, more complex population structures, and how different subpopulations mix
(Chowell et al. 2016). For instance, in many countries the “flattening of the curve” of the COVID-19 epidemic can
be described by extensions of SIR models that model the isolation and quarantine of infected individuals, as well
as lockdown and social distancing measures imposed on the general population (Maier and Brockmann 2020).
Recent years also brought a surge in epidemic models in which susceptible and infected people do not meet
randomly (as in SIR-type models) but interact on social networks (Keeling and Eames 2005), giving rise to
sophisticated agent-based modeling approaches for epidemic forecasts (Ajelli et al. 2010; Balcan et al. 2010).
Here, we use an SIRD model in which individuals either recover or die after being infected. We differ from the
standard textbook formulation of compartmental models by assuming that the rates at which individuals
transition between compartments changes dynamically. These time-dependent rates are often account for
seasonality effects (Stone, Olinky, and Huppert 2007). In this study, we assume that the time-dependence is a
direct consequence of non-pharmaceutical intervention measures. Therefore, the effectiveness of these
interventions can be estimated by measuring the strength of the concurrent reduction in disease transmission
rates.
In this research paper, we propose a model that examine the course of the Covid-19 epidemic and applied it to
29 country case studies. The model considers four stages of infection: susceptible (S), infected (I), recovered (R),
and dead (D).

Analyzing Covid-19 Data using SIRD Models

P age |3

Modeling Framework
The starting point is a discrete-time version of a standard compartmental epidemiological SIRD (susceptible–
infected–recovered–dead) model.

Variables
t

time in days

S(t)

the number of susceptible at time t

I(t)

the number of infected at time t

R(t)

the number of recovered at time t

D(t)

the number of deaths at time t

N

= S + I + R + D, the total population (approximately a constant)

Equations (suppressing time-dependence on the right-hand side, thus, S(t) → S):
S(t+1) = S – βSI/N
I(t+1) = I + βSI/N – γI – δI
R(t+1) = R + γI
D(t+1) = D + δI

Parameters
β
γ
δ

transmission coefficient
recovery rate
death rate

The exponential growth rate during the initial phase of the epidemic, when S ≈ N, is r0 = β – (γ + δ). Note that this
is the (per capita) growth rate per day; thus, its unit is day–1. It is different from the basic reproductive number,
R0 = β/(γ + δ) which is dimensionless. Epidemic grows when r0 > 0 (R0 > 1) and dies out otherwise.

Estimating Intervention Impact on SIRD Parameters
Let ΔS = S(t+1) – S(t) be the daily change in S. ΔI, ΔR, ΔD are defined analogously. Rewriting the discrete SIRD
models in the differenced form we obtain
ΔS = – βSI/N
ΔI = βSI/N – γI – δI
ΔR = γI
ΔD = δI
Solving these equations for parameters we have
β = ΔC/I
γ = ΔR/I
δ = ΔD/I
where ΔC is change per day in the total number of cases, C = I + R + D. We also assumed that S ≈ N (because the
number of total cases so far has been less than 1 percent of the total population).
Thus, if we have data on daily change in I, R, and D we can obtain sequential estimates of the SIRD parameters
on a daily basis. Naturally, these estimates will be very noisy due to both process and observation noise. While
the number of infected are relatively small at the beginning of the pandemic, the process noise is expected to be

particularly high. Measurement noise can arise as a result of a number of factors. First, there can be delays in
reporting cases. A constant delay causes no problem for this analysis, because it merely shifts all trajectories by
a constant time lag. However, the delay in reporting may also change. For example, if no data are reported on a
weekend, we will observe zeros infected over the weekend and a cumulative number (over three days) on
Monday. Second, we expect that the detection rate of new cases will be low in the beginning of the epidemic
and then gradually increase as the awareness of the epidemic spreads. Because many individuals infected with
SARS-CoV-2 are asymptomatic, the prevalence of testing asymptomatic cases will affect how many cases are
reported. This affects both new cases and deaths, because initially many deaths due to Covid-19 may be
misclassified as pneumonia caused by other diseases. Third, government agencies responsible for collecting data
may change their definitions of what constitutes “infected” and “recovered”.
All these sources of measurement error will tend to obscure the changes in epidemiological rates resulting from
interventions. Smoothing the daily estimates helps to reveal patterns in the data. This is an effective procedure
for reducing the error arising from variable reporting delays. Ultimately the results reported below are
informative only as long as we can filter out the effect of various errors resulting from inaccurate reports.

Model parameters
The Johns Hopkins University CSSE data repository (Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and
Engineering 2020) provides data on three time-series of Covid-19 indicators: daily counts of confirmed cases (C),
recovered cases (R), and deaths (D). These data allow us to calculate additional time-series, such as:
I(t) = C(t) – [R(t) + D(t)]
ΔC(t) = C(t+1) – C(t)
ΔD(t) = D(t+1) – D(t)

The number of Infected (aka active cases)
New cases
Daily deaths

We use these data to calculate the daily estimates of the SIRD parameters, as described in the preceding
section.
Next, we smooth the data using ksmooth(), a kernel regression function in R. We use the normal kernel and
bandwidth of 10 for β and δ, and 20 for γ. Because data are very noisy when the total number of cases is still
small, we smooth the data only after C(t) exceeds 100 cases and use a constant for the period before, set equal
to the first smoothed estimate.
Using smoothed estimates of the model parameters we solve the SIRD model forward in time for the period of
the epidemic. For initial values we assume S(0) = N, and R(0) = D(0) = 0. For I(0) we use a value that matches
mean model-predicted I(t) to the number of infected in the data for the time period when the cumulative
number of cases exceeds 100. In other words, I(0) is a parameter estimated from the data.
As a measure of model fit, we use the coefficient of prediction R²
predR² = 1 – Σ(Y – X)2/ Σ[X – mean(X)]2
where Y(t) are model predictions (Y stands for C, R, etc), X(t) are data, and mean(X) is the mean of X. This
measure, known as the coefficient of prediction, is similar to the coefficient of determination in regression. It
also reaches a maximum of 1 for perfect prediction. Unlike regression R², however, predR² can be negative,
when the model predicts data worse than the data mean. We calculate predR2 separately for log-transformed
and not-log-transformed data.
Note that the purpose of numerically solving the SIRD equations is not to provide an independent test of the
model. Using raw (unsmoothed) daily parameter values will generate a perfect “fit” of the model to data
because these values were obtained from the data. Calculating trajectories with smoothed parameter curves, on
the other hand, provides a check of internal coherence of the approach. In other words, the question becomes

whether smoothing can still generate trajectories close to the data. The second reason to run the predicted
trajectories is that initial counts typically severely underestimate the true number of infected. By chosing I(0)
that fits the later course of the epidemic (after the number of infected exceeds 100) we obtain an estimate of
the course of the epidemic before this threshold is reached. The difference between the predicted and observed
I provides us with an informal estimate of the degree with which the initial numbers were underestimated.

Case studies
In the rest of the document we report analysis results for each country (except for China, where we focus on the
province of Hubei). Each case study begins with Background, which provides a narrative on the overall course of
the Covid-19 epidemic in the focal country. This section is followed by Analysis Results, which are organized as
folllows:
The top two rows show the data (points) and model predictions (curves) for (a) I, (b) D, (c) R, (d) ΔC, (e) ΔD, and
(f) C.
(g) Transmission coefficient (β): daily estimates (points) and smoothed estimate (curve).
(h) Death rate (δ): daily estimates (points) and smoothed estimate (curve).
(i) Exponential growth rate of the epidemic (rt). The dotted line is rt = 0, above which the epidemic grows and
below which it declines.
The final section, Conclusions, provides a brief summary of what has been learned by applying the SIRD model to
the data for the country.

Hubei, China
Background
On 31 December 2019, the WHO China Country Office was informed of a cluster of 27 pneumonia cases of
unknown etiology that had emerged in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, China (World Health Organization,
2020a) (although an unverified report from the South China Morning Post suggested that a Covid-19 case traced
back to 17 November 2019, in a 55-year-old from Hubei province, may have been patient zero (Ma 2020)). Cases
within the cluster shared an epidemiological link with the Wuhan Huanan seafood wholesale market, which was
shut down on 1 January 2020. At this stage, there was no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission
(WHO 2020a). On 8 January 2020, results from sequencing analysis from lower respiratory tract samples
revealed a novel coronavirus, which was then named “2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)” (F. Wu et al. 2020).
On 11 January 2020, the first death from 2019-nCoV was reported in Wuhan (Bryson Taylor 2020). On 20
January 2020, Hubei reported 258 confirmed cases including six deaths (WHO 2020d) and by 29 January the
virus had spread to almost all provinces of mainland China (7,736 confirmed and 12,167 suspected cases, 170
deaths) and to 18 countries around the world (82 confirmed cases) (WHO 2020g). By 8 February, over 723
deaths from the coronavirus infection had been reported in China and 34,598 were confirmed to be infected, of
which 27,100 were in Hubei (WHO 2020k). As of 6 April 2020, the epidemic has led to 67,803 confirmed cases
and 3,212 deaths in Hubei province.
The Chinese health authorities claimed to have promptly enforced intervention measures against the outbreak.
These measures were implemented from 20 January 2020 and included intensive surveillance, epidemiological
investigations of the cluster cases, identification and monitoring of contacts, and active case finding as well as risk
communication to improve public awareness and promote self-protection measures (WHO 2020a). In a press
conference on 20 January, the population was advised to avoid visiting Wuhan unless extremely urgent and to
wear face masks. Moreover, the Chinese New Year celebrations were cancelled and health and temperature

screening was implemented for travelers moving in and out of railway stations (X. W. Wu 2020). Commands for
epidemic control (CEC) were set up in different regions, including Wuhan and Hubei. Many inter-province public
transportation services were suspended. On 23 January 2020, the government of the People's Republic of China
imposed a lockdown in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province. This was the first known instance in modern
history of a major city with as many as 11 million people being locked down (Crossley 2020; Cyranoski and Silver
2020). The imposed lockdown included travel restrictions to and from Wuhan, a suspension of public transport
within the city, and a mandatory home quarantine (citizens were only allowed to leave their home every two days,
for a maximum of 30 minutes). Social distancing measures were enforced, including the cancellation of events and
gatherings, closure of public places, schools and universities, and prohibition of outdoor activities (Lau et al. 2020;
Zhu, Wei, and Niu 2020). On 23 January, the construction of an emergency field hospital (Huoshenshan Hospital)
to treat patients infected with the coronavirus began, and was completed within 10 days. A second emergency
hospital (Leishenshan Hospital) was built nearby and opened on 8 February (Holland and Lin 2020). New
laboratories were also rapidly set up to increase testing capacity (Miller et al. 2020). Healthcare capacity was
enhanced from 24 January onwards, with more than 30,000 medical workers sent to Hubei, two-thirds of which
were sent to Wuhan (Ye 2020). On Wednesday 18 March, some travel restriction measures were lifted in Hubei.

Conclusions
The dataset for China has some limitations. Indeed, the Chinese authorities revised the reporting of cases at
least six times. On April 17 they suddenly accounted for additional >300 cases and >1000 deaths due to Covid19. Since diagnostic dates for those additional cases are unknown, the results above were fitted to the data
series ending on April 16. An overall poor fit between model-calculated trajectory and data suggests that the
limitations in the data reporting mentioned above precludes us from obtaining an accurate understanding of the
course of Covid-19 epidemic in Wuhan based on the data reported.
However, we note that Wang et al (2019) obtained a very good fit using a similar mode, which was fitted
to data extracted from the Chinese municipal Notifiable Disease Report System (reference:
https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.03.20030593). Below we reproduce a figure from this article. The implication
from this comparison is that our failure to obtain a good fit was due to problems with the data we have

available, rather than the course of epidemic in Wuhan deviating from the pattern predicted by the
epidemiological model.

South Korea
Background
The first case of Covid-19 in South Korea was reported on 20 January 2020 and the number of cases increased in
the following weeks (Duddu 2020; Shim et al. 2020). The number of confirmed cases increased significantly after
19 February (Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering 2020; Shim et al. 2020). By 21
February, the cumulative number of infections had passed 100, with 155 confirmed cases and the first death
from the virus. By a week later, on 28 February, there had been 2,022 cases and 13 deaths (Our World in Data
2020a; 2020d). This explosive growth in infections was linked to “Patient 31,” a member of the Shincheonji

Church of Jesus in the city of Daegu who has been described as a “superspreader” (Gregory 2020; Shin and Cha
2020). However, measures taken by the government to contain the Daegu cluster and control the spread of the
virus have been successful. On 15 March, the total number of cases stood at 8,162 and deaths at 75 (Our World
in Data 2020a; 2020d). As of 2 April, there have been 9,976 confirmed cases, of which 169 have died and 5,828
have been reported as recovered (Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering 2020).
South Korea has therefore achieved an unusually low case fatality rate so far, keeping its Covid-19 death toll
below 300.
The government response to the first cases of Covid-19 in the country focused on contact-tracing and high-tech
surveillance through smartphone data, closed-circuit television footage and credit card data (Sonn 2020).
Mass testing has been a cornerstone of South Korea’s approach. By mid-March around 20,000 people—
including those without symptoms—were being tested per day (Bicker 2020; Edward 2020). Drive-through
testing centres have been used to protect healthcare workers and reduce delays caused by the need to disinfect
hospital facilities after each patient. Both those who test positive and their contacts within the past 14 days
were quarantined and smartphone apps were used to monitor their movements (Kasulis 2020). As of 1 April,
421,547 people have been tested (Statista 2020).
Following the identification of the Daegu cluster, emergency measures were put in place to contain the
outbreak: extra testing centres, contact-tracing and monitoring of Shincheonji members in Daegu and beyond,
and case isolation (Kim 2020; Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2020). No national lockdown
was implemented: many restaurants and other businesses stayed open but checked customers’ temperature
before admitting them (Choe 2020).
The government has also sought to encourage social distancing and respiratory etiquette among the population.
Schools were closed in late February and as of 2 April they have not yet reopened (BBC News 2020f; Ock 2020;
Shin 2020). Many policies have relied on voluntary public cooperation. Large-scale public information campaigns
promoted wearing masks, washing hands often and thoroughly, and maintaining social distance (Chunghoon
and Soh 2020).

Conclusions
Although South Korea did not enforce a national lockdown, the measures implemented by the government were
very effective in stopping the disease. The transmission rate declined very rapidly within a ten-day period
centered on 1 March. This caused the exponential rate of disease to cross the zero-line around 10 March.
Currently, all signs indicate that the epidemic is under control (ref).

Japan
Background
On 15 January 2020, the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in Japan in an adult male, with a history of travel
to Wuhan, China (WHO 2020c; 2020b). Up to 1 February 2020, 17 confirmed cases had been reported to the
WHO (WHO 2020h). The first death due to Covid-19 in Japan was confirmed on 14 February 2020, while 33 cases

were confirmed (WHO 2020m). On 1 March 2020, there were 239 confirmed cases and 5 deaths (WHO 2020p).
On 1 April, the total number of confirmed cases was 2,178 with 57 deaths (WHO 2020z). Four days later the
number of new confirmed cases had increased by 66%, counting 3,271 cases and 70 deaths (WHO 2020ab).
Approximately one-third of these confirmed cases were from the Tokyo region (Knüsel 2020). At the end of
March, the new Covid-19 infections could no longer be traced back to known sources, bars, karaoke clubs and
other entertainment venues being the most probable places of infection (Knüsel 2020). Some schools in Japan,
in municipalities with no Covid-19 cases, are set to reopen in April (Siripala 2020). However, many public schools
in Tokyo will remain closed until early May. In the second week of May, a month-long state of emergency for the
Japanese regions of Tokyo, Kanagawa, Saitama, Chiba, Osaka, Hyogo and Fukuoka was declared (Johnston 2020;
McCurry 2020). The state of emergency creates the opportunity to implement at subnational levels (prefectures
and municipalities) more effective and specific measures to mitigate the spread of Covid-19 (Johnston 2020;
McCurry 2020).
As of 3 April 2020, a total of 39,446 people in Japan had undergone PCR tests for COVID-19 (Statista Research
Department 2020) (0.00031% of the total population).

Conclusions
The number of cases was low initially in Japan. However, we observe an explosive growth in the number of
infected people around the end of March and the beginning of April 2020. As of 21 April, Japan was able to
reverse the exponential growth rate of epidemic, but it has not crossed the zero line yet. The decay in
exponential growth rate might be related to the strict measures taken by the Japanese government, such as a
state of emergency in seven prefectures on 7 April, which was further extended to the whole country on 16
April.

India
Background
On 30 January 2020, India reported its first case of Covid-19 to the WHO (WHO 2020g; Reid 2020). In total, three
confirmed cases were reported by 1 March 2020 (WHO 2020p), but by 1 April, the number of confirmed cases had
increased to 1,636, with 38 deaths (WHO 2020z). In January, the Indian government announced a travel alert for
Indian citizens, in particular for the city of Wuhan (Yan and Wallen 2020). Screening of people at airports began
on 17 January and approximately 600,000 passengers had been screened for symptoms up to 3 March (Biswas
2020). Between 9 and 23 March, more and more Indian federal states closed their land borders with neighbouring
countries, followed by a travel ban for non-neighboring states, e.g. the European Union. Other countries, such as
Nepal and Bhutan, closed their borders with India (The Hindu 2020; Laskar 2020; ET Bureau 2020). All Indian states
were required to implement social distancing measures from 16 March (Sharma 2020).
On 24 March, the Indian government announced a national lockdown for the next 21 days (BBC News 2020g),
although some Indian states have extended the lockdown until 30 April (Hindustan Times 2020). In this context,
universities, schools, all transports and services have been suspended (exception e.g. essential goods, emergency
services, supermarkets and hospitals). Testing coverage was increased from 20 March: people with symptoms
suggesting possible Covid-19 infection, particularly those of pneumonia, were tested regardless of travel or
contact history (Ghosh 2020). As of 8 April, a total of 127,919 samples have been tested (Findlay 2020) from which
5,194 were positive, and 149 deaths have been reported to the WHO (WHO 2020ac).

Conclusions
We observe a growth in the number of infected individuals between the middle of March and the first week of
April 2020 in India. As of 11 May, the exponential growth rate of epidemic has decreased, but it has not crossed
the zero line yet. The decay in the exponential growth rate of the epidemic could be related to various
measures, including the enforcement of a national lockdown. What is worrying is that the growth rate of the
epidemic stopped declining in mid-April. Thus, as of 11 May, the government has not succeeded in controlling
the epidemic.

Austria
Background
On 25 February 2020, the first two confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Austria were reported, in Innsbruck. Both
patients had a travel history to Bergamo, Italy (ORF.at 2020a). Both were admitted to hospital and were later

discharged, on 5 March (ORF.at 2020b). All contact persons were traced and tested (Al Jazeera 2020a). By 1
March, 1,826 tests had been conducted (Tiroler Tageszeitung 2020). The first Covid-19 death in Austria was
reported on 12 March; the patient had a recent travel history to Italy (ORF.at 2020c; WHO 2020s).[6-7]. One month
later (on 26 March), there were 5,888 confirmed cases and 34 deaths (WHO 2020w). On 3 and 4 April 2020, there
were more newly recovered than newly infected people (on 3 April: 11,383 infected and 2,022 recovered and on
4 April: 11,665 infected and 2,507 recovered (Bundesministerium für Soziales, Gesundheit, Pflege und
Konsumentenschutz 2020a; 2020b)).
On 10 March, the first universities closed, airport and health checks (especially at the border crossings to Italy
(Anschober 2020) were implemented, and people returning from Italy were quarantined. On 10 March, mass
gatherings were prohibited (i.e. of over 100 people indoors or over 500 outdoors) (Kurier 2020). All schools were
closed from 16 March (Peitler-Hasewend and Jungwirth 2020), as of 8 May 2020 they remain closed but are
scheduled to reopen in mid-May 2020 (ORF.at 2020j).
On 13 March, a cordon sanitaire was implemented around the municipalities of Ischgl, Kappl, See, Galtür and St.
Anton am Arlberg in Tyrol (ORF.at 2020e) and four days later (17 March) around the entire federal state of Tyrol
(Van der Bellen and Kurz 2020).[13] On 7 April, the cordons sanitaires were lifted (except for St. Anton, the
Paznaun valley and Sölden) (Kleine Zeitung 2020a). On 14–15 March the Austrian parliament passed the Covid-19
Law, ordering the closure of all non-essential shops from 16 March (ORF.at 2020d). Initially bars, restaurants and
cafes were allowed to open until 3 p.m. (Kleine Zeitung 2020a), but from 17 March all restaurants and bars were
closed completely (ORF.at 2020f). With the Covid-19 Law (ORF.at 2020g), far-reaching restrictions on individual
movement were imposed. Social distancing measures were implemented, e.g. direct patient contact with doctors
was reduced by issuing electronic prescriptions over the phone. The law also required people to keep a distance
of 1–2 meters from others and banned gatherings of more than five people. On 20 March, further social distancing
measures were introduced: children’s playgrounds and sports grounds were closed and working from home was
encouraged. On 25 March, the “Stopp Corona” tracking app was released, which allows users to be notified when
they have come into contact with a person infected with Covid-19 (Österreichisches Rotes Kreuz 2020).
From 6 April, it became compulsory to wear a basic face mask, covering the mouth and nose, inside supermarkets,
and from 14 April this requirement was extended to public transport (ORF.at 2020i; 2020h). Beginning on 14 April,
small shops under 400 m2, hardware stores and garden centres were allowed to reopen with adaptative measures,
i.e. no more than one customer per 20 square meters. From 1 May, other shops and hairdressers will also be able
to reopen in Austria (Der Standard 2020).

Conclusions
Austria gradually shut down in early March and by 15 March the implemented measure may have decreased the
transmission coefficient. The progress was rapid and by early April the exponential growth rate of the epidemic
crossed the zero line. Under the current conditions the epidemic is showing clear signs of dying out.

USA
Background
The first confirmed case in the United States was reported to the WHO on 23 January 2020 (WHO 2020e). On 1
March 62 cases had been confirmed (WHO 2020p). On 3 May, a total of 1,093,880 confirmed cases and 62,406
deaths had been reported (WHO 2020ah).

The United States has introduced a series of travel restrictions. Foreign nationals with a travel history within the
past 14 days to specific countries, such as China (from 2 February) and Iran (2 March), were barred from entering
the country, while Americans returning from these countries were ordered to self-quarantine for 14 days
(University of Colorado Boulder 2020; Robertson 2020). On 13 March a national state of emergency was declared
(Liptak 2020a). On 16 March the government advised against meetings of over 10 people (Liptak 2020b).
New York has been particularly severely affected by the epidemic, the state of emergency was declared on 7
March. Several executive orders requiring progressively more non-essential workers to stay at home were issued.
All mass gatherings of over 500 people were cancelled from 13 March, and events with fewer than 500 attendees
were ordered to “cut capacity by 50 percent” (The New York State Governor 2020). Effective from 22 March, the
“New York State on PAUSE” executive order ordered “all non-essential businesses statewide” to close (NY State
Department of Health n.d.). This order also directed the population to suspend all non-essential social contact,
maintain a distance of six feet from other people in public, limit the use of public transport to “when absolutely
necessary,” and to self-isolate at home if they became sick.
Ohio’s state government closed all bars and restaurants on 15 March, and was followed by Illinois (Conradis 2020),
New York, New Jersey, and Maryland (Education Week 2020). On 16 March, the national government announced
that citizens should stay home and avoid contact for 15 days, and these social distancing measures were then
extended until the end of April (Keith et al. 2020). Lockdowns were implemented at different times in different
states, such as in Idaho on 25 March and Alabama on 4 April (Education Week 2020). The majority of schools
nationwide have been closed since 10 April (Education Week 2020). At the beginning of April, the governments of
several states and cities, including New York, Los Angeles, Colorado, and Pennsylvania, have asked citizens to wear
face masks in public spaces (Education Week 2020; Durkin 2020; Briggs, Wolfman-Arent, and MacDonald 2020).

Conclusions
The early course of the Covid-19 epidemic in the USA (before March) cannot be resolved with the present data.
The reporting rate clearly improved after 1 March. For the first three weeks in March, the epidemic grew nearly
exponentially with a transmission rate of nearly 0.25 per day. Beta started to decline only towards the end of
March. Unfortunately, by 11 May beta was still at 0.025, which was enough to slow down the growth of
epidemic but not enough to bring it to an end. As of 11 May, the exponential growth parameter, r(t), is still
positive.

Taiwan
Background
The first confirmed case in Taiwan was reported on 21 January, and according to the Central Epidemic Command
Center (CECC), set up on 22 January, 124 separate measures have been implemented since the beginning of the
pandemic (Wang, Ng, and Brook 2020). Taiwan began to respond to the pandemic early on, before the first
confirmed cases. The government introduced inspection measures for all incoming flights from Wuhan, China
from 31 December 2019. Health screening was implemented for all incoming travellers from Wuhan on the
same date (Wang, Ng, and Brook 2020).
Contact tracing started on 5 January: the government started monitoring travellers who had been to Wuhan,
China in the past 14 days. Individuals classified as high-risk according to their recent travel history were ordered
to self-quarantine (Wang, Ng, and Brook 2020). On 14 February the government launched the Entry Quarantine
System for contact tracing, an online health declaration platform for all incoming travellers upon arrival (Wang,
Ng, and Brook 2020).
The government promoted the wearing of face masks as a preventative measure and banned the export of face
masks on 24 January. To prevent citizens from hoarding face masks and raising the price, the government
implemented a mask rationing system, which limited the quantity each citizen could buy and when they could
buy them, based on their health insurance number (Ku and Kao 2020). The government increased face mask
production to 8 million per day and formed 60 new production lines to meet the demand (Yang 2020). By 7
April, daily testing capacity had increased to 3,800 (Taiwan Centers for Disease Control 2020b).
Travel tours from China were suspended in February, and this restriction was subsequently extended to other
high-risk regions. The number of confirmed cases rose rapidly in March due to the high volume of incoming
travelers (The Straits Times 2020). The government tightened its airport and border control by denying entry to
foreign nationals from 19 March and imposing a 14-day self-quarantine for all incoming travelers (Chang, Huang,
and Chen 2020). Social distancing measures have also been implemented, including the cancellation of mass
gatherings of over 100 people on 25 March (Taiwan Centers for Disease Control 2020c; 2020a).

Conclusions
The time series runs from 22 January to 21 April 2020, with confirmed cases ranging from 1 to 422. The
relatively low active cases and infection rate may be due to the Taiwanese government’s early interventions:
case identification and health checks at airports from 31 December 2019, travel restrictions denying entry to
people who had been in Wuhan from 22 January 2020, and social distancing measures (event cancellations and
closure of educational institutions) in February 2020. Additional quarantine measures were introduced on 19
March 2020.The government has increased testing capacity since 24 January 2020 (when there were just three
confirmed cases), which is an important measure for targeting the source of the spread.

The overall trend of the R(t) and the SIRD model suggests that the infection rate and number of active cases rose
rapidly after day 40. The SIRD model-fitting did not perform too well using data from Taiwan, with a mean R2 of
0.76. In particular, the daily death rate was estimated poorly. The confirmed cases were underestimated prior to
day 40. Taiwan implemented a series of measures early on during the pandemic, which may be the reason for
the low number of cumulative active cases, and relatively low R(t) until 8 March. The surge in the number of
cases was mostly due to imported cases, which cannot be addressed by one or two intervention measures
alone. The transmission rate in the country decreased around mid-March. The effectiveness of increased testing
capacity and contact-tracing measures may be reflected in the rising infected cases from day 58. The
exponential growth rate of the epidemic decreased rapidly from around the end of March to mid-April, and the
growth rate has crossed the zero-line. The fitted model suggests that the epidemic is slowing down in the
country and that the interventions were effective.

Australia
Background
The first confirmed case in Australia was reported on 25 January 2020 (Australian Government Department of
Health 2020), and as of 13 April there were 6,322 confirmed cases (Our World in Data 2020b). The government
barred entry to travellers from China on 1 February as the virus spread rapidly there, and subsequently imposed
an additional travel ban from other high-risk countries, such as Italy and South Korea (Bagshaw 2020; Bagshaw
and McCauley 2020; Pannett 2020). Prime Minister Scott Morrison declared a human biosecurity emergency on
18 March, which allowed the government to enforce restrictions on individual movement and regional
lockdowns (Pandey 2020). On the following day, Australia closed its border to all foreign nationals not resident
in the country (Brockett and Scott 2020). On 22 March it was announced that no more than one person per four
square metres would be allowed in indoor public places such as bars and restaurants, while other social
distancing measures (including closing educational institutions and non-essential services) varied from county to
county (Boseley and Knaus 2020). Mass gatherings of more than 500 people were suspended on 13 March, and
more stringent measures limiting gatherings to two people came into force on 29 March (ABC News 2020;
Worthington 2020). In addition to travel restrictions and social distancing, measures designed to prepare the
healthcare system have been introduced, such as increasing the number of ventilators available and enhancing
testing capacity (Lawson 2020; Tadros, McIlroy, and Margo 2020).

Conclusions
The model fitted with mean R2=0.91. The infected cases reached a peak around day 70, and the number of
active cases began to decrease after this point. The total deaths showed similar a pattern to the new cases. The
death rate was very low and flat during the observation period, and the transmission rate has been decreasing
from the beginning of March. There was a growth in the number of infected cases around 15 March, which may
due to the increasing testing capacity. Subsequently the growth rate of the epidemic declined rapidly and
crossed the zero-line. The fitted model showed signs that the epidemic is slowing down and is under control in
the country.

Italy
Background
On 20 February 2020, the first case of Covid-19 was notified in Italy, in the Lombardy region. In the following
week, the number of cases increased rapidly in the southern part of Lombardy (Cereda et al. 2020). On 22
February 2020, 60 additional cases as well as the first two deaths were notified (Dong, Du, and Gardner 2020).
As the epidemic progressed, it spread to other Italian regions. On 19 March 2020, the number of deaths due to
Covid-19 in Italy surpassed that of China. As of 7 April 2020, Italy is one of the biggest active hotspots of Covid19 worldwide, with a total of 132,547 confirmed cases and 16,523 deaths (Dong, Du, and Gardner 2020).
However, the true number of cases has probably been underestimated due to limited testing capacity (Flaxman
et al. 2020).
On 31 January, the Italian government declared a state of emergency and all flights to and from China were
suspended. On 21 February a cordon sanitaire was imposed around 10 municipalities in northern Italy (DesvarsLarrive et al. 2020). The cordon sanitaire around the epicentre of the outbreak in Codogno appears to have
played a critical role in controlling the infection (Cereda et al. 2020). On 2 March 2020, as Italy reached 100
deaths, the government announced the complete closure of all educational institutions. On 9 March 2020, a
national lockdown was imposed (Desvars-Larrive et al. 2020). Two days later, the government ordered the
closure of all bars, restaurants and non-essential shops (Sylvers and Legorano 2020). On 19 March 2020 nonessential individual movements were prohibited, including all outdoor activities, and public places closed down.
On 23 March 2020, all non-essential companies and industries were closed (Desvars-Larrive et al. 2020).

Conclusions
Although Italy has declared a state of emergency on 31 January, effective measures to slow down the rate of
spread of the epidemic required more than a month to take effect. The transmission rate began declining after 1
March. Meanwhile, the death rate increased, reaching a peak in mid-March, probably because the healthcare
system of Italy was overwhelmed by the number of patients requiring intensive care and respirators. The
measures taken by the government finally bore fruit when the exponential growth rate of the epidemic crossed
the zero line in late April.

Spain
Background
Spain has been one of the countries worst-hit by the pandemic. The first few cases of Covid-19 were identified
outside peninsular Spain and were linked to tourism in the Canary Islands. On 31 January, a German tourist on

the island of La Gomera tested positive (Linde 2020). In late February a doctor from Lombardy (northern Italy)
on holiday in Tenerife was found to have contracted the virus, causing the hotel he had been staying in to be
locked down for two weeks (Jones, Boseley, and Burgen 2020; BBC News 2020c). Cases on the Spanish mainland
began to take off in early March. The number of confirmed cases for the whole country by 29 February was 34;
this had risen to 5,753 just two weeks later (15 March), and by 31 March 78,797 people had tested positive (Our
World in Data 2020c). Spain overtook China in the number of confirmed cases on 30 March (Laudette and
Landauro 2020). With 140,511 cases as of 7 April, the country is now second only to the USA in the scale of its
epidemic (Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering 2020). Its death rate is also very
high: again as of 7 April, 13,897 people have died and 43,208 have been recorded as recovered (Johns Hopkins
University Center for Systems Science and Engineering 2020).
Both the Spanish government and the governments of the autonomous communities have been criticized in the
international press for a delayed response to the pandemic, despite the crisis unfolding in nearby Italy (Tremlett
2020; Ward 2020). An Interministerial Coordination Committee (Comité de Coordinación Interministerial) was
created on 4 February to spearhead the country’s response (Ministerio de Sanidad, Consumo y Bienestar Social
2020; Desvars-Larrive et al. 2020). However, testing was initially slow to take off, and medical professionals
warned that they lacked the resources needed to test all those showing symptoms (Güell, Sevillano, and Linde
2020).
Border restrictions were introduced gradually: flights between Spain and Italy were suspended on 11 March
(Ministerio de la Presidencia, Relaciones con las Cortes y Memoria Democrática 2020), and on 16 March Spain
announced that it would not allow foreign nationals to enter through its land borders except in special cases (Al
Jazeera 2020c).
An important turning point in Spain’s approach was the declaration of a state of alarm on 14 March. Before that
point, some social distancing measures had been implemented, such as the closure of schools by all autonomous
communities between 9 and 12 March (Mateo and Ferrero 2020; RTVE.es 2020) and a ban on events with over
1,000 people by the Catalan government on 11 March (Rodríguez 2020). But on 8 March, “sports events,
political party conferences and massive demonstrations to mark International Women’s Day all took place”
(Tremlett 2020). The state of alarm signaled a much more restrictive approach, effectively a complete lockdown:
citizens were ordered to stay at home unless going to work, shopping for necessities or helping others; cafes,
restaurants and entertainment venues were closed (Zafra, Galocha, and Alonso 2020). Even leaving the house
for exercise (such as a short walk, jog or bike ride) was banned. On 29 March the lockdown was tightened: all
non-essential workers were ordered to stay at home (Marcos 2020). Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez announced
on 4 April that the state of alarm would be extended until the 26th of the month (Cué, Junquera, and Vizoso
2020).

Conclusions
Spain is another example in which lockdown was implemented slowly over an extended period of time. As a
result, the transmission rate began declining only in mid-March. What’s worse, the death rate increased
substantially in the second half of March, perhaps because the hospitals were overwhelmed. The exponential
growth rate has been declining, and finally crossed the zero line in late April.

Turkey
Background
Turkey announced its first case of Covid-19 relatively late in comparison with nearby countries, on 11 March 2020
(McKernan 2020; Our World in Data 2020e). By a week later (19 March), the confirmed cases had jumped to 191
and the first death had been recorded. By the end of March, 9,217 cases and 168 deaths had been officially

recognized according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (Our World in Data 2020f;
2020e). As of 24 April, there have been 101,790 confirmed cases, of which 2,491 have died (WHO 2020af).
On 24 January, thermal cameras were installed at the Istanbul airports. During February, all flights from China
(Daily Sabah 2020; Hürriyet Daily News 2020) and all flights to and from Iran (Wintour 2020), Italy, South Korea
and Iraq (Reuters 2020b) were suspended. The list of countries for which the flight ban was imposed was expanded
on 13 March to include Germany, France, Spain, Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Sweden, Austria and the Netherlands
(Zontur 2020). At the beginning of March, the government recommended that the public as much as possible
refrain from going outside during the coming weeks (WKO Austria 2020d). As of 16 March all public facilities, such
as schools, universities, theatres, cinemas, bars, and sport centres, have been closed, with the exception of
restaurants and shopping centres (WKO Austria 2020d; Habertürk 2020). On 3 April, a 15-day entry ban to 30
Turkish provinces was introduced. Masks covering the mouth and nose became mandatory (CNN Türk 2020). On
11 April, a 48-hour curfew over the weekend was implemented in Turkey’s 31 largest cities, including Ankara,
Antalya, Istanbul, and Izmir (Kleine Zeitung 2020b; Hörtenhuber 2020). The weekend curfew was extended for the
following weeks (Hörtenhuber 2020).

Conclusions
Turkey started with a very high infection rate in March 2020. The exponential growth rate of the epidemic has
now decreased, as of 21 April. This may be related to various preventive measures taken by the Turkish
government, such as travel and gathering restrictions from 13 March, a ban on prayer gatherings in mosques
from 16 March, and other social distancing measures. However, the exponential growth rate is still well above
the zero line, which indicates that infection is still spreading rapidly.

Malaysia
Background
The first confirmed case in Malaysia was reported on 25 January 2020 (Reuters 2020a). On 4 February 10 cases
were confirmed, 7 of whom had a history of travel to China [2]. On 1 March there were 24 infections and no deaths
(WHO 2020j), but by 31 March the number of infected people had increased significantly: there were 2,626
confirmed cases and 37 deaths (WHO 2020y). As of 9 April, a total of 4,119 confirmed cases and 65 deaths had
been reported to the WHO (WHO 2020ad).
An event held by the Tablighi Jamaat religious movement in Kuala Lumpur is believed to have been an infection
hotspot, with about 16,000 people attending from 27 February to 1 March. Two-thirds of the 673 cases confirmed
by 17 March were due to this event (Barker 2020).
In February, 3.5 million free face masks were distributed nationwide to control the spread of Covid-19 (The Star
2020).
The travel restrictions imposed by the Malaysian government can be divided into four phases:
1) Early February (09.02.2020): travelers from China (i.e. from Wuhan, Hubei, Zhejiang and Jiangsu
provinces) are no longer allowed to enter Malaysia (Borneo Post online 2020);
2) From 13 March onwards, all Malaysians returning from Iran, Italy or South Korea must spend 14 days
in self-quarantine in their homes (New Straits Times 2020a);
3) Malaysia bans travelers from Denmark from entering the country as of 14 March (Pei 2020); and
4) On 18 March, all entry to and exit from Malaysia is prohibited (Hassan 2020).
Between 18 and 31 March, controls on movement and social distancing measures were introduced and were then
extended until 28 April (Sukumaran 2020; Bunyan 2020; Rodzi 2020). These measures included the cancellation
of mass events, closure of kindergartens, state and private schools, and the closure of non-essential businesses
(with the exception of food supermarkets and other vital services, such as supplying the population with water
and electricity) (Bunyan 2020; New Straits Times 2020b). On 8 April, 24.62 million free face masks were distributed
nationwide (Yiswaree 2020).

Conclusions
The exponential growth rate of the epidemic decreased rapidly in Malaysia from the middle of March 2020. This
decay might be related to the movement control order of the Malaysian government, which was implemented
on 18 March and extended until 28 April. As of 21 April, the exponential growth rate has crossed the zero line.
This shows that the epidemic is dying out.

Brazil
Background
The first confirmed case of Covid-19 infection in Brazil was reported to the WHO on 26 February (WHO 2020o).
On 17 March, the Brazilian authorities partially closed the country’s border with Venezuela (Reuters 2020f). On
18 March, six municipalities in the state of Rio de Janeiro – Rio de Janeiro, Guapimirim, Niterói, São Gonçalo, Nova
Mesquita and Iguaçu – declared a state of emergency to help contain the novel coronavirus (Globo.com 2020a).
On 19 March, the first death was reported and there were 291 confirmed infections (WHO 2020t).
By 20 March, many schools and universities had been closed, partly as a precautionary measure, but also because
of proven cases of Covid-19 (France 24 2020; Renteria and Moreno 2020). Many states and municipalities have
already declared a state of emergency and implemented measures such as event bans and school closures. On 22
March Brazil closed its borders with all neighbouring countries (WKO Austria 2020e). From 30 March, entry to
Brazil by air or land was barred to all foreign nationals for 30 days. However, the movement of goods is not
affected by the restrictions and border closures. By 10 April, a total of 15,927 cases and 800 deaths had been
reported (WHO 2020ae). Currently, only people with severe symptoms are tested for Covid-19 in Brazil
(Globo.com 2020b). At present (as of 11 April 2020), the Brazilian government has not yet decided on any Brazilwide measures such as school closures or bans on events (WKO Austria 2020e).

Conclusions
We observe a rapid growth in infected individuals during the initial stage of the epidemic in Brazil. As of 21 April
2020, the exponential growth rate of the epidemic has decreased significantly. However, it has not crossed the
zero line yet.

Israel
Background
On 21 February, Israel reported its first confirmed case of Covid-19 infection to the WHO (WHO 2020n; Times of
Israel 2020a). The first death was reported on 20 March, by which point there was a total of 712 confirmed cases
(WHO 2020u). By 10 April there were 9,755 infected and 79 had died (WHO 2020ae). On 26 February, the Israeli
government issued a travel warning for Italy and stressed that all trips abroad should be cancelled (YNet News
2020). On 9 March, an obligatory quarantine was imposed on all persons entering Israel: all those entering were
ordered to quarantine themselves for 14 days upon entry (BBC News 2020b). The regulation was immediately
valid for all Israelis returning home and was applicable to all foreign citizens from 13 March (BBC News 2020b).
On 10 March, Israel began to restrict gatherings to 2,000 people. The next day, 11 March, assemblies in Israel
were further limited to 100 people. On 14 March, new regulations were announced, which came into force on 15
March. These included a ban on meetings of more than 10 people and the closure of all educational institutions,
restaurants, shopping centres, pubs, dance clubs, gymnasiums, venues for events and conferences, cultural
institutions, etc. Snack bars, supermarkets and pharmacies were allowed to remain open (Al Jazeera 2020b).
On 15 March, the Israeli government announced that they were considering allowing the Shin Bet internal security
service to use mobile phone data to monitor the previous movements of people diagnosed with Covid-19. On 17
March the telephone surveillance program was approved (Gross 2020b; 2020a).
On 1 March, Israel banned all foreigners from entering the country with immediate effect (WKO Austria 2020c).
The following day, Prime Minister Netanyahu proclaimed a national state of emergency. On 25 March, more
stringent restrictions on the free movement of citizens were imposed by the government. According to the new
guidelines, people are not allowed to move further than 100 m from their homes; private vehicles may carry only
two passengers; and indispensable workers must be tested for fever at their place of employment. People with a
temperature above 38° C are to be sent home (Israel Ministry of Health n.d.; 2020). Since 12 April, all Israelis must
cover their nose and mouth when leaving their homes (Times of Israel 2020b).
On 31 March, meetings of over two people (except for close family members) were prohibited (WKO Austria
2020c). On 2 April, the city of Bnei Brak was declared a “restricted zone”, and the Haredi quarters in Jerusalem
were locked down on the 12th. According to statistics from the Ministry of Health, almost 75% of coronavirus
infections in the city could be linked to these districts (Times of Israel 2020c).

Conclusions
We observe a rapid growth in the number of infected individuals between 15 March and 1 April 2020.
Subsequently, the exponential growth rate of the epidemic has decreased rapidly. This decay might be related to
the strict restrictions on citizens’ movements that were implemented on 25 March. As of 21 April, the
exponential growth rate has crossed the zero line, indicating that the epidemic is dying out.

Philippines
Background
The first case of Covid-19 in the Philippines was confirmed on 30 January, in a woman from Wuhan, China (WHO
2020g; ABS-CBN News 2020). By 1 February, two cases and one death had been reported to WHO, but the person
who died had been in close contact with the first confirmed case (WHO 2020i). As of 10 April, 4,076 confirmed
cases and 203 deaths have been reported in the Philippines (WHO 2020ae).
Since 22 January 2020, tourists from Wuhan have been denied Philippine travel visas under the “Visa-upon-arrival”
(VUA) programme (Ramirez 2020). On 2 February, an entry ban was imposed for all foreign travellers who had
visited China, Hong Kong or Macao in the previous two weeks (Glee and Gregorio 2020). Holders of permanent
visas from the Philippines and Filipino citizens were allowed to enter the country but had to undergo a mandatory
14-day quarantine. On 19 March, the Philippine government announced that it would refuse entry to all foreign
nationals “until further notice” (CNN Philippines 2020).
President Duterte issued Proclamation No. 922 on 9 March, declaring a public health emergency (Parrocha 2020).
On 13 March it was announced that the National Capital Region (Metropolitan Manila) would be partially locked
down for a month (Esguerra 2020); the lockdown was subsequently extended repeatedly and remains in place as
of 1 May (Dancel 2020). In addition, local government units outside the National Capital Region were ordered and
authorized to impose a local quarantine under certain conditions. On 16 March the province of Luzon was placed
under an “enhanced” community quarantine, which includes the following measures: temporary shutdown of
public mass transport; restricted land, air and sea transport; a strict house quarantine for all households; and the
closure of non-essential businesses (Luna 2020; Office of the President of the Philippines 2020). The Luzon
lockdown has been extended until 30 April (PhilStar Global 2020). A general curfew between 8 p.m. and 5 a.m.
applies to all residents (WKO Austria 2020b). Other cities and regions have introduced similar measures, including
Cebu, Davao City, Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, Iloilo, Negros Occidental, and Negros Oriental (WKO Austria 2020b).

Conclusions
The exponential growth rate of epidemic has decreased since the middle of March. This reduction in the rate
might be related to various measures taken by the Philippine government, including lockdown measures.
However, the exponential growth rate of the epidemic has not crossed the zero line yet.

Chile
Background
On 3 March 2020, Chile notified the WHO of its first case of Covid-19 (WHO 2020r). By one month later (3 April),
the number of confirmed cases and deaths had risen to 3,404 and 18 respectively (WHO 2020aa), with the first
death reported on 21 March (WHO 2020v). On 10 April the total number of confirmed cases was 5,972 and the
number of deaths 57 (WHO 2020ae).
On 13 March, public events involving more than 500 people were banned (Reuters 2020e). One day later, about
1,300 passengers on two cruises in Chilean waters were quarantined because one passenger tested positive for
Covid-19 (Roberts 2020). From 15 March to 30 September 2020, cruise ships are no longer allowed to dock in any
Chilean port (WKO Austria 2020a). Chile has been tightening its measures and closed its borders for 14 days from
18 March (WKO Austria 2020a). Chileans and foreign nationals who have a permanent residence in Chile can enter
the country, but they must agree to a 14-day quarantine upon arrival. Since 16 March schools have been closed.
On 18 March the government declared a “state of catastrophe” for 90 days. This was followed by more
intervention measures, such as the indefinite closure of all shopping centres, with the exception of essential shops
like food supermarkets or pharmacies. On 20 March other businesses, such as restaurants and cinemas, were
closed. Two days later, a nationwide daily curfew from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. was introduced (WKO Austria 2020a).
From 20 March, preventive quarantines were imposed in the regions of Las Condes, La Reina and Vitacura. Since
1 April, health checks have also been carried out at all bus stations, and since 8 April the wearing of face masks
has been mandatory on public and private transport (WKO Austria 2020a). Quarantines were extended to certain
areas of Chile, e.g. in the cities of Chillán, Osorno, Temuco, Punta Arenas and Padre Las Casas until at least 15 April
and to Las Condes until at least 17 April (WKO Austria 2020a).

Conclusions
The exponential growth rate of the epidemic has decreased gradually from 20 March 2020. This decay might be
related to various measures, including lockdown measures taken by the Chilean government during the last
week of March. However, the exponential growth rate of the epidemic has not crossed the zero line yet.

Ecuador
Background
The first known case of Covid-19 in Ecuador was in an Ecuadorian woman resident in Spain who imported the
virus to the city of Guayaquil on 14 February 2020, showing no symptoms during the flight (El Comercio 2020).
This case was confirmed on 29 February, making Ecuador the third country with confirmed cases in South
America. The disease spread among the contacts of the first case, leading to 10 confirmed cases by 4 March
(CNN Ecuador 2020). On 7 and 10 March, two additional imported cases from the Netherlands were confirmed
in the province of Sucumbíos (El Universo 2020c). The first case was also the first confirmed death, on 13 March
(Metro Ecuador 2020c). On 14 March the sister of the first case also died of Covid-19 (Metro Ecuador 2020b).
The disease spread quickly in the province of Guayas (Expreso Ecuador 2020), where Guayaquil is located. By 5
April, the country had 3,646 confirmed cases and the presence of the disease was confirmed in all 24 provinces
(El Universo 2020f). At the time of writing on 13 April, the total count of confirmed cases is 7,466 with 333
deaths (Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering 2020), making Ecuador one of the
countries in South America most affected by the pandemic.
On 26 February, before the first case was confirmed in Ecuador, the government announced measures to
prepare for an outbreak, in reaction to the first case reported in Brazil (Secretaría General de Comunicación de
la Presidencia 2020a). These measures consisted of airport and seaport checks for travelers coming from
affected countries (China, Korea, Italy, and Iran, but not Spain) and the preparation of clinical facilities to handle
cases of Covid-19. After the first case was confirmed on 29 February, the government started an active
information campaign, including a hotline, online resources, and frequent announcements on social media
(Secretaría General de Comunicación de la Presidencia 2020b). Temperature checks and health controls in
airports began on 1 March (El Universo 2020a) and the city of Guayaquil applied public social distancing
measures and disinfection of public spaces from 7 March (El Universo 2020b). A health emergency was declared
on 12 March for a period of 60 days (Metro Ecuador 2020a). From that day, all in-person teaching at schools and
universities was cancelled and replaced with online means (El Universo 2020d). Mass gathering events with
more than 250 participants were cancelled, and the limit was lowered to 30 participants on 14 March (El
Universo 2020e). The same day, air and sea borders were closed and land borders were partially closed, putting
travelers into quarantine. On 16 March, a national state of emergency was declared, closing non-essential shops
and workplaces, as well as bars and restaurants (El Oriente 2020). On 6 April, additional mobility restrictions
were applied and it became compulsory to use gloves and masks in supermarkets (Primicias 2020). The state of
health emergency declared can be extended beyond the initially planned period of 60 days and air and sea
borders are closed until further notice.

Conclusions
The exponential growth rate of the epidemic began to decrease from the third week of March 2020 in Ecuador.
This decay might be related to the national state of emergency that was declared on 16 March, closing nonessential shops and workplaces as well as bars and restaurants. However, the exponential growth rate has not
crossed the zero line yet, indicating a growth of infected individuals.

Switzerland
Background
The first case of Covid-19 infection in Switzerland was registered on 25 February 2020 in the canton of Tessin: a
70-year-old man returning from Milan (Italy) had contracted the disease (Tagblatt 2020). On 27 February, seven
additional cases were reported in the cantons Aargau, Basel, Geneva, Graubünden, Tessin, Waadt and Zurich. All
cases were linked to previous stays in Italy. The first death linked to Covid-19 was reported on 4 March, as a 74year-old woman with a pre-existing condition succumbed to the disease (Der Bundesrat, das Portal der
Schweizer Regierung 2020a). At the beginning of March (5 March), Switzerland registered 1.06 confirmed cases
per 100,000 inhabitants and was the second most affected country in Europe (CASH 2020). Since 7 March,
patients with mild symptoms are no longer tested for Covid-19 (CASH 2020). As of 10 April, 190,000 tests for the
virus had been conducted, of which 15% returned a positive result. The median age of infected people in
Switzerland is 53 years, and 53% of people infected are women. The death rate is about 2.9% and the median
age of people who have died due to Covid-19 is 84 years. Among the deceased, 97% had at least one preexisting condition (Bundesamt für Gesundheit BAG 2020e).
On 28 February, the Swiss Federal Council declared a “besondere Lage” (special situation) (Bundesamt für
Gesundheit BAG 2020c), leading to the prohibition of gatherings with more than 1,000 attendees (Bundesamt
für Gesundheit BAG 2020b). On 1 March, a large-scale public information campaign was launched, including
billboards, flyers and a telephone hotline (Bundesamt für Gesundheit BAG 2020a) and on 11 March nine border
crossings to Italy from the canton of Tessin were closed (Eidgenössische Zollverwaltung 2020). On 13 March, the
Federal Council implemented several more severe measures, including the prohibition of gatherings of more
than 100 people (50 people in restaurants, bars and clubs), and the closure of schools and all skiing areas (Der
Bundesrat, das Portal der Schweizer Regierung 2020b). On 16 March, the federal council declared an
“ausserordentliche Lage” (extraordinary situation) until 19 April, entailing the closure of all bars, restaurants and
shops (except grocery stores), the prohibition of all gatherings, and travel restrictions from all neighboring
countries except Liechtenstein (Bundesamt für Gesundheit BAG 2020d).
Because of the pronounced federal organization of the Swiss state, several cantons implemented measures at
different points in time from the Federal Council. The canton of Tessin has been the most severely affected by
the spread of the novel coronavirus because of its proximity to Italy. Therefore it declared a “state of
emergency” on 11 March – leading to the closure of all schools and entertainment venues – one week before
the Federal Council put similar measures in place (Sansano 2020).
Switzerland has been criticized in the media for its lack of clear and consistent reporting of the number of deaths
from Covid-19. Much of the documentation of cases has been carried out on paper rather than digitally, and
there have been considerable difficulties keeping track of the actual number of deaths due to the lack of a
common reporting standard (Fichter 2020).

Conclusions
Switzerland started with a relatively high exponential growth rate. Subsequently, it has decreased rapidly. As of
21 April 2020, it has crossed the zero line and the epidemic is now dying out.

Belgium
Background
The first case of Covid-19 infection in Belgium was reported on 4 February 2020 (Kockartz 2020), affecting a
person returning from Wuhan, China. On 27 February, a second case was reported, in a woman returning from a
business trip in northern France (Zeimers 2020). Until mid-March, Belgium registered a rather low number of
cases (886 on 15 March), considering that its neighboring countries France and the Netherlands were severely
hit by the spread of the novel coronavirus. In late March, case numbers and numbers of deaths started to rise
rapidly. As of 10 April, Belgium is reporting 260 deaths per 1 million inhabitants, making it the third most
affected country in Europe, behind Italy and Spain (Worldometer 2020a). As of 10 April, there have been 28,018
reported cases and 3,346 deaths, giving a fatality rate of 11.9% (Sciensano 2020). It should be noted that
Belgium counts deaths with clinical symptoms of Covid-19 as “suspicious” and includes them in the figures of
Covid-19 deaths, even if the patients were not tested (Counasse 2020).
On 10 March, the Belgian government advised that any indoor events with more than 1,000 attendees should be
cancelled, but stopped short of a ban (De Standaard 2020a). On 12 March, the government doubled down on
the measures and ordered the closure of schools, restaurants, bars, clubs and the cancellation of all public sport
and cultural events starting on 13 March (Belgian Government 2020). On 17 March, all non-essential travel was
prohibited, all non-essential shops were closed and all gatherings banned (Belgium Official Information and
Services 2020). On 20 March the country closed its borders to all non-essential travel (VRT NWS 2020).
Especially in the early phases of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Belgium, the Belgian government was criticized
heavily by scientists and healthcare organizations for its lack of timely and decisive action to curb the spread of
the virus (Wathelet 2020; De Wolf 2020). Belgium’s minister of health failed to secure the supply of medical
equipment for the healthcare sector early in the pandemic, as her department’s first order of 5 million masks
was not delivered, possibly due to fraud (De Standaard 2020b). In addition, Belgium has been faced with a
shortage of reagents needed for testing since the beginning of March, and needed to implement a triage system
to limit the number of tests (Hope 2020). The potentially very high “dark number” of people infected with Covid19 in Belgium due to this lack of testing is a possible explanation for the extremely high fatality rate in this
country.

Conclusions
The exponential growth rate of the epidemic began to decrease from the middle of March 2020 in Belgium.
However, it has not crossed the zero line yet.

Portugal
Background
The first confirmed positive case of Covid-19 infection in Portugal was reported on 2 March 2020, in a man who
had returned from a holiday in northern Italy (La Vanguardia 2020). Having reached 78 positive cases
(Worldometer 2020b), Portugal declared a nationwide state of alert on 12 March, forbidding large-scale indoor
and outdoor events, suspending many international flights, and closing schools and universities as well as bars
and restaurants (Franco 2020; OSAC 2020). Nearly a week later, on 18 March, the president declared a state of
emergency, to last until at least 17 April (Visit Portugal 2020). The next day, a package of measures was
introduced to restrict movement and implement social distancing. Commercial passenger flights were cancelled,
public spaces like museums, monuments and tourist attractions were closed, and companies were advised to
switch to teleworking (Oliveira 2020). By that time, 642 Covid-19 cases had already been reported (Worldometer
2020b). As the virus was by then spreading within the community and could no longer be contained, Portugal
moved into a “mitigation phase” starting from 26 March (Arreigoso 2020). Under the new guidelines, provision
of care for those infected with Covid-19 should not be centralized in hospitals, but also include the primary
sector (Arreigoso 2020). On 2 April, the Portuguese parliament extended the state of emergency for another 15
days (SAPO 24 2020). Prime Minister António Costa announced the closure of all airports during Easter to slow
the spread of the novel coronavirus (Mayberry, Stepansky, and Varshalomidze 2020).
On 5 April, the vast majority out of the total 11,278 confirmed cases in Portugal were recovering at home
(9,927), about 9% were hospitalized (1,084) and 267 were in intensive care units (The Portugal News 2020). As
of 9 April, Portugal has reached 13,956 confirmed cases, of which 205 have been reported as recovered and 409
have died (Direção-Geral da Saúde 2020a). The majority of confirmed cases (around 8,000) seem to be located in
the north of the country, followed by the region of Lisbon with around 3,500. Fewer cases have been observed
on the islands of Madeira (53) and the Azores (91). So far, the highest number of new cases on one day (1,035)
was recorded on 31 March, with 1,035 (Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering
2020). Since then, daily increase has lowered and has remained under 852 new cases per day (Direção-Geral da
Saúde 2020b).

Conclusions
Portugal started with a relatively high exponential growth rate. Subsequently, the rate has decreased rapidly,
but it has not crossed the zero line yet.

Russia
Background
On 31 January 2020, the first two Covid-19 cases on Russian territory were reported, both in Chinese nationals
(TASS Russian News Agency 2020a). A month later, on 2 March, Moscow confirmed its first case, in a man who
had returned from a holiday in Italy (Interfax.ru 2020a). The first case of infection not imported from another
country was reported on 13 March [3]. The first death of a person who had tested positive for Covid-19 was that
of a 79-year-old woman on 19 March. By 31 March, the number of daily new cases had already reached 500,
with a majority (387) of them from Moscow (Federal Service for Surveillance on Consumer Rights Protection and
Human Wellbeing 2020). As of 10 April, the total number of confirmed cases was 11,917, with 795 recovered
and 94 deaths. The number of daily new cases shows no tendency of slowing down (Johns Hopkins University
Center for Systems Science and Engineering 2020).
On 23 January, Blagoveshchensk, a Russian city on the border with China, decided to suspend its cultural
exchange and official visits to China (Sputnik 2020). Starting on 2 February, the Russian government
implemented its first intervention measures. Trains to China were suspended and restrictions on the entry of
foreign nationals from China were applied. From 16 February, people returning from China were monitored and
ordered to self-isolate, and Chinese citizens were banned from entering Russia. Between 23 and 29 February,
Moscow began using a facial recognition network to ensure compliance with quarantine measures. The entry of
Iranian citizens was restricted, and the government issued travel warnings for Italy (The Moscow Times 2020b).
Additional measures were implemented in the first week of March. All Russians returning from Covid-19 hotspot
countries were ordered to self-isolate; the health ministry recommended against foreign travel; and the export
of medical supplies like masks, gloves and protective suits was temporarily banned. Random temperature checks
on the Moscow Metro were also introduced (The Moscow Times 2020b). On 11 March, when the WHO declared
the virus a pandemic, Moscow banned any events with over 5,000 attendees. Five days later, this restriction was
extended to all events with over 50 people. Museums, monuments, circuses and other cultural institutions were
closed on 17 March (Meduza 2020). Schools and universities as well as all sports facilities were closed from
March 21.
The mayor of Moscow ordered residents older than 65 to self-isolate starting on 26 March, with a reward of
4,000 rubles for following the order (The Moscow Times 2020b). The same day, the ban for foreigners entering
Russia was lifted for immediate relatives and spouses of Russian nationals (The Moscow Times 2020b; РБК
2020). Shops, restaurants and bars were closed from 28 March to 5 April in what President Vladimir Putin called
a “paid holiday”, and this was subsequently extended to 30 April (The Moscow Times 2020a). On 28 March
Russian land and sea borders were closed (The Moscow Times 2020b; Russian Government 2020). From 31
March, Moscow and the surrounding region have enforced self-isolation for all residents, restricting movement
to the closest shops and walks within 100 m of their homes (Interfax.ru 2020b). The same restrictions were
applied in many other Russian regions during the following days (RIA Novosti 2020; TASS Russian News Agency
2020b; 76.ru 2020). On 9 April, Russia reported that it had carried out more than 1 million tests for Covid-19.
Legislation setting out severe punishments, including prison sentences, for those breaking quarantine rules and
spreading fake news was signed by President Putin on 10 April (The Moscow Times 2020b).

Conclusions
We observe a rapid growth in infected individuals from the middle of March 2020 in Russia. The transmission
rate has decreased, but very slowly. Between 15 March and 11 May, β has decreased from 0.23 to 0.07, still too
high to bring the epidemic under control.

Norway
Background
Norway reported its first case of Covid-19 on 26 February. The patient had returned from China a week earlier
(The Local 2020b; Norwegian Institute of Public Health 2020). During the following week, case numbers rose to
56 by 4 March, all of which could either be directly or indirectly (through direct contact with the first patient)
linked to foreign travel (Folkehelseinstituttet 2020a). Following the further rise of new cases, the Norwegian

government introduced a package of measures on 12 March, largely following the example of other European
countries (Nikel 2020). These included the closure of educational institutions; cancellation of sports, cultural,
and business events; the closure of bars, restaurants and the entire hospitality sector; and the quarantine of
people returning from countries other than Finland or Sweden, regardless of whether they were showing
symptoms. Travel within Norway was strongly discouraged (Nikel 2020). On 16 March, further travel restrictions
were announced, prohibiting entry to Norway except for residents (Nikel 2020).
The first fatality due to Covid-19 was reported on 12 March, the same day that the first set of measures were
introduced (NRK Norge 2020). As of 13 April, a total of 6,488 Covid-19 cases have been confirmed
(Folkehelseinstituttet 2020b) with only 134 fatalities, giving a comparably low case-fatality rate (VG 2020).

Analysis results

Conclusions
The rate of infection in Norway experienced a rapid decline in mid-March followed by more gradual decline
thereafter. As of 11 May 2020, the exponential growth rate of the epidemic has not crossed the zero line yet.

Ireland
Background
Ireland reported its first case of Covid-19 on 29 February 2020. The first patient was a student who had recently
returned from northern Italy (RTÉ 2020a). Already a month before the first case, Ireland had set up a National
Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), a working group in the Department of Health, to monitor and respond
to the outbreak (Boland 2020). A week later, by 7 March, there were 19 cases, the majority of which were
independent from one another (Sunderland 2020). Ireland reported its first official death from Covid-19 on 11
March (BBC News 2020d). After that point the number of cases rapidly grew, exceeding 100 on 14 March, 500
on 19 March, and 1,000 on 23 March, according to the Irish government’s online dashboard (Irish Government
2020a). Deaths numbered 2 on 14 March, 3 on 19 March, and 6 on 23 March. As of 6 April there have been
5,364 cases and 174 deaths.
Early attempts to trace the contacts of the first infected individuals led to some school closures (RTÉ 2020a).
Already on 6 March, an instance of community transmission of the virus in Cork forced 60 staff at Cork
University to self-isolate (RTÉ 2020b). The government introduced measures to control the spread of Covid-19 in
stages, similarly to other EU countries. All schools, universities, and childcare facilities were closed on 12 March
(BBC News 2020e). St Patrick’s Day events, scheduled for 13–17 of March, were cancelled by 9 March, though
some reports suggest pubs were still open and busy until the 14th (BBC News 2020a). Stay-at-home orders and
further restrictions on public gatherings were announced on 27 March by Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Leo
Varadkar (Irish Government 2020b).
Due to limited testing capacity, Ireland prioritizes the testing of healthcare workers, individuals who have been
in direct contact with a positive case, and individuals with a fever and at least one other Covid-19 symptom
(Health Service Executive 2020). Some testing facilities are drive-through. Ships of the Irish Navy have been
repurposed to test and treat patients (TheJournal.ie 2020). On 6 April the Health Service Executive (HSE)
announced that it would double the public health system’s capacity to test within a week, promising a capacity
of 4,500 tests per day (RTÉ 2020c).

Conclusions
As of 21 April 2020, the exponential growth rate of the epidemic is below the zero line in Ireland. The epidemic
is dying out in the present environment.

Mexico
Background
The first few confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Mexico were reported on 27 February 2020 (Animal Político 2020a).
In a press conference the next day, ministers recommended that the population should practice social distancing
and regular hand-washing (Animal Político 2020b). Confirmed cases of Covid-19 grew from 53 on 15 March
(Animal Político 2020b) to 118 on 18 March (Animal Político 2020d; 2020c). The first death was reported on 18
March (Animal Político 2020b; 2020c).
Between 20 and 23 March, social distancing measures were imposed, schools were closed and mass gatherings
were cancelled (Enciso L. 2020). On 24 March, it was announced that Mexico had entered “Phase 2” of the
epidemic, with 5 non-imported cases in the country (Animal Político 2020e). The number of infections grew
rapidly, with 475 confirmed cases and 6 deaths as of 25 March (Animal Político 2020f). On 30 March, with 1,093
confirmed cases and 28 deaths, a public health emergency was declared and social-distancing measures were
extended until 30 April (Animal Político 2020g).
As of 6 April, 20,475 tests have been carried out; the country has 2,439 confirmed cases, 6,295 suspected cases
and has seen 125 deaths linked to Covid-19. The national incidence rate per 100,000 inhabitants is 1.91.

Conclusions
We observe a rapid growth in the number of infected individuals from 15 March 2020 in Mexico. As of 21 April,
the exponential growth rate of the epidemic has decreased, but it is still well above the zero line.

Hungary
Background
Hungary reported its first two cases of Covid-19 on 4 March 2020 (Reuters 2020c). The first two cases were both
Iranian students who had returned to Hungary from Iran in late February to continue their studies. The third
case was announced on 5 March, in a British man who had recently visited Milan (Reuters 2020d). By 15 March,
32 cases had been confirmed, many with links to the first two outbreaks (Belügyminisztérium 2020). On the
same day, Hungary recorded its first death officially linked to Covid-19. The number of confirmed cases grew
quickly, exceeding 100 on 21 March and 500 on 2 April (Átló 2020). As of 9 April, there have been 980 confirmed
cases and 66 deaths.
The government established a crisis group with representatives from several ministries in late January (Hír TV
2020). Early steps taken included the return and quarantine of Hungarian citizens living in Wuhan (About
Hungary 2020). On 7 March, the government cancelled the national holiday celebrations planned for 15 March
(Zoltán 2020). Budapest introduced more frequent cleaning of public transportation and new rules restricting
interactions with bus drivers on 11 March (Hungary Today 2020). Also on 11 March, the national government
declared a state of emergency, granting itself extra powers to deal with the outbreak (Eder 2020). At this time
large gatherings (at least 500 people outdoors or 100 people indoors) were banned, and universities were
closed. Travel from Iran, Italy, South Korea and China was restricted. Kindergartens were closed on the 13th, and
other schools on the 16th.
On 16 March Prime Minister Viktor Orbán announced further measures, including the closure of national
borders to non-citizens (later clarified to exempt some commuters and individuals from the European Economic
Area resident in Hungary), the cancellation of all public events, and the daily closure of restaurants by 3 p.m.
(Makszimov 2020). A general curfew, restricting movement except for essential activities (grocery shopping,
going to the pharmacy, exercise) came into effect on 28 March. Since then, shops have been reserved for those
over 65 between the hours of 9 a.m. and 12 p.m.
The Hungarian Parliament has voted to extend the state of emergency indefinitely, allowing the Prime Minister
to rule by decree, and banning elections until the parliament lifts the state of emergency. The provisions
included the criminalization of the spreading of misinformation, which opposition parties and journalists have
claimed could lead to censorship and the suppression of dissent (Makszimov 2020). The decision has drawn
international criticism (Rankin 2020).

Conclusions
The SIRD model fits the data in Hungary well, with mean R2=0.91, particularly the active cases of infection and
the total confirmed cases. The fitted model underestimated the total deaths during the observation period. The
death rate remains constant at the beginning of until April 1st. The transmission rate decreases gradually around
1 April. The decline in the exponential growth rate of the epidemic may be due to various degrees of social
distancing interventions in Hungary, but it has not crossed the zero-line yet, as of 21 April.

Denmark
Background
On 27 February 2020, Denmark notified the WHO of its first case of Covid-19 (WHO 2020o). One month later (27
March), the number of confirmed cases and deaths had risen to 1,877 and 41 respectively (WHO 2020x). On 24
April the total number of confirmed cases was 8,073 and the number of deaths 394 (WHO 2020af).
On 14 March, Denmark closed its borders and public institutions such as schools and universities were closed from
16 March. One day later, gatherings with more than 10 people were prohibited, and these restrictions on the
number of people per meeting should continue until 10 May. In the middle of March, restaurants, cafes etc. were
also closed. On 15 April, schools opened for specific age groups of children and on 20 April, some businesses,
including hairdressers and massage therapists, were allowed to reopen (Pagh-Schlegel 2020; Dagbladet 2020).

Conclusions
The draconian measures implemented by Denmark in mid-March had an immediate effect in bringing an initially
high rate of transmission from 0.32 to 0.07. This was, however, followed by a slight rebound. The exponential
growth rate crossed the zero line one month later, in mid-April. All indications since then suggest that the
epidemic is under control. In particular, partial opening of schools and businesses in late April, has not (as of 11
May) resulted in a second wave of the epidemic.

Sweden
Background
On 31 January 2020, the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in Sweden, in a woman with a history of travel to
Wuhan, China (The Local 2020a). Up to 1 March 2020, 13 confirmed cases had been reported to the WHO (WHO
2020p). As of 24 April, there have been 16,755 cases, of which 2,021 have died (WHO 2020af). On 17 February,
the Swedish government recommended against all travel to China’s Hubei province, extending this to Iran on 2
March (Regeringskansliet 2020a; 2020b). Since 19 March non-essential travel to Sweden from countries outside
the EU has been prohibited, and on 18 March universities switched to distance learning (WKO Austria 2020f).
Further Swedish government recommendations were to practice social distancing and work from home where
possible. On 11 March, the government banned all gatherings larger than 500 people, and two weeks later (27
March) reduced this number to 50 people (Krisinformation.se 2020; Die Welt 2020b). Beginning on 1 April, all
private visits to nursing homes were prohibited (Lidköpingsnytt 2020). Most restaurants and shops have remained
open, though with restrictions designed to enforce physical distancing (Lidköpingsnytt 2020; The Local 2020c).

Conclusions
Although Sweden did not implement a complete lockdown, as did neighboring Denmark, it was nevertheless
able to substantially reduce the rate of transmission in mid-March. Since then, however, the progress has been
slow. Unlike Denmark, in which the exponential growth rate crossed the zero line in mid-April, in Sweden r(t) is
still positive.

Germany
Background
The first confirmed case in Germany was reported on 28 January 2020 (WHO 2020f). By 1 March, 57 cases had
been confirmed (WHO 2020p). On 3 May, a total of 161,703 confirmed cases and 6,575 deaths had been
reported to the WHO (WHO 2020ag).

Since 27 February, travelers from China, South Korea, Japan, Iran or Italy have been required to inform the
authorities of their whereabouts and of their possible contacts (Der Spiegel 2020a). On 8 March, the
government recommended the cancellation of events with more than 1,000 attendees (Tagesschau 2020a). In
all federal states, childcare facilities and schools began to be closed between 16 and 18 March (European Union
Agency for Fundamental Rights 2020). From 16 March, those wishing to travel from Germany to France, Austria,
Luxembourg, Switzerland or Denmark must have special reasons for travelling (Tagesschau 2020b). One day
later (17 March) a worldwide travel warning was announced by the Federal Foreign Office (Der Spiegel 2020b).
Several measures based on physical distancing have been implemented in the country, but at different times in
the individual federal states of Germany (Dimitriu, Möllers, and Hermann 2020). The first recommendation to
avoid social contact was announced on 12 March. On 22 March, the governments of the German states agreed
to implement “restriction of social contact” (Bundesregierung 2020a), such as a minimum distance of 1.5 m
between people in public spaces. Gatherings were limited to two people, and restaurants were closed (though
allowed to serve food and drink to be taken home) (Die Welt 2020a). Mandatory face-mask wearing was
introduced at different times in different states: in Saxony on 20 April; in Saxony-Anhalt on 23 April; in Thuringia
on 24 April; and in Bavaria, Mecklenburg-West Pomerania and several other states on 27 April (Tagesschau
2020c; Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk 2020; ARD 2020). Some federal states, such as Bavaria, Berlin, Brandenburg,
the Saarland, Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt, imposed further restrictions. For example, leaving one's own home and
entering public spaces generally is only possible with a “valid” reason in these states (Mischke 2020; Löbbecke
2020; Ministerin für Soziales, Gesundheit, Integration und Verbraucherschutz 2020).
Some measures were eased from the second half of April. On 20 April, shops with sales areas of up to 800
square metres were allowed to open, though with restrictions on the number of customers allowed in at once.
On 4 May, some schools reopened, but mass gatherings are prohibited until at least 31 August. On 30 April, the
governments of the federal states agreed to relax further restrictions on public life: museums can open for
visitors, church services can take place and playgrounds can be reopened (Bundesregierung 2020b).

Conclusions
The time series consists of a 74-day observation period (27 January–21 April 2020), 14,7065 cumulative
confirmed cases, and 4,862 reported deaths. Germany implemented the following measures during the
observation period: risk communication, airport health check, resource allocation, increasing hospital capacity,
social distancing, and travel restrictions. The number of cases surges around 40 days into the pandemic, which
may be due to the increasing testing capacity in the country in early March.
The SIRD model was fitted with a mean R2=0.92. Although the confirmed cases were high in Germany, the death
rate was relatively low. The low death rate may be due to the enhanced health capacity, the low mean age of
infected patients, and the highly active testing to identify infected patients at an early stage. The model fitted
well in terms of total dead and recovered; the number of infected (active cases) was overestimated after the

peak (from day 60 onward). The transmission rate declined by about 18% around 1 March, and the exponential
growth rate crossed the zero-line within the observation period. The decreasing growth rate suggests that the
combination of social distancing and increased testing may have played an important role in mitigating the
Covid-19 pandemic in the country.

Czechia
Background
The first three confirmed cases in Czechia were reported on 1 March 2020 (WHO 2020q). One month later (1
April), 3,308 cases and 31 deaths had been confirmed (WHO 2020z). On 3 May, a total of 7,737 confirmed cases
and 240 deaths had been reported to the WHO (WHO 2020ag).
On 10 March, schools were closed and two days later the governments declared a state of emergency,
mandating the closure of restaurants, bars and non-essential shops (PNP.de 2020; iDNES.cz 2020). On 16 March,
Czechia’s borders were closed. Czechia was one of the first European countries to introduce the compulsory
wearing of face masks covering the mouth and nose, on 19 March (NTV 2020).
On 14 April, the government presented a plan for returning to normal. For instance, from 20 April, sports
facilities and some other businesses were allowed to reopen and weekly farmers’ markets can take place. On 28
April, shops with a floor space under 200 square meters opened. On 11 May, shops up to 1000 square meters
may reopen and from 25 May restaurants, bars and other public areas, such as the outdoor areas of zoos, will
open (Bućan 2020). On 8 June, all shops will reopen and events with fewer than 50 attendees will be permitted
(Němec 2020).

Conclusions
The SIRD model fitted the Czech data well, with mean R2=0.90 for an observation period of 52 days. The total
dead and recovered were underestimated from day 20 to day 40. The fitted model showed a decrease in new
cases from day 30. The transmission rate decreased rapidly from 15 March, by approximately 20%. Czechia
implemented lockdown on 16 March (day 16) and mandatory face-mask wearing on 18 March (day 18), which
may correspond to the sharpest drop in the transmission rate. The exponential growth rate of disease had
almost reached the zero-line by the end of the observation period. The data suggest that the spread of the
pandemic is slowing down and is under control in the country.
