Abstract

49

Background:

50

The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) was the fourth country in the world to authorize the

51

BNT162b2 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine, which it rolled out on December 17,

52

2020 and first targeted at healthcare workers (HCWs). This study assesses vaccine uptake

53

among this group during the first month of its availability.

54

Methods:

55

A national cross-sectional, pilot-validated, self-administered survey was conducted among

56

HCWs in the KSA between December 27, 2020 and January 3, 2021. The survey included

57

sociodemographic details, previous contact with COVID-19 patients, previous infection with

58

COVID-19, receiving (or registering with the Ministry of Health website to receive) the COVID-19

59

vaccine, sources of HCWs’ information on vaccines, awareness of emerging variants of concern,

60

and anxiety level using the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder assessment. A descriptive

61

bivariate analysis and multivariate logistic binary regression analysis were performed. The

62

primary evaluated outcome was vaccine uptake.

63

Results:

64

Of the 1,058 participants who completed the survey, 704 (66.5%) were female, and 626 (59.2%)

65

were nurses. Of all the respondents, 352 (33.27%) were enrolled to receive or had already

66

received the vaccine, while 706 (66.73%) had not registered. In a bivariate analysis, not

67

enrolling for vaccination was more likely in females than males (78.5% vs. 21.5%, P < 0.001),

68

HCWs between the ages of 20 and 40 years than those > 40 years (70.4% vs. 29.6%, P = 0.005),

69

Saudi HCWs than expatriates (78% vs 22%, P < 0.001), and among HCWs who used social media

70

as a source of information than those who did not (69.8% vs. 38.6%, P < 0.001). In a

71

multivariate analysis, independent factors for not enrolling to receive the vaccine included

72

being female (aOR = 0.287, 95%CI = 0.206–0.401, P < 0.001), being less than 40 years of age

73

(aOR = 1.021, 95%CI = 1.002–1.040, P = 0.032), and using social media as a source of

74

information (aOR = 0.207, 95%CI = 0.132-1.354, P = 0.001). Factors associated with uptake were

75

being a Saudi national (aOR = 1.918, 95%CI = 1.363–2.698, P < 0.001), working in an intensive

76

care unit (aOR = 1.495, 95%CI = 1.083–2.063, P = 0.014), and working at a university hospital

77

(aOR = 1.867, 95%CI = 1.380–2.525, P < 0.001).

78

Conclusions:

79

A low level of vaccine uptake was observed especially in female HCWs, those younger than 40

80

years old, and those who used social media as their source of vaccine information. This survey

81

provides important information for public health authorities in order to scale up vaccination

82

campaigns targeting these HCWs to increase vaccine enrollment and uptake.

Introduction
After the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) reached pandemic levels, vaccine

86

development was fast tracked through government funding, corporate spending, and private

87

donations [1]. Once vaccines were made available in December 2020, a phased approach for

88

vaccine allocation was recommended, with Phase 1a targeting first respondents and healthcare

89

workers (HCWs) [2]. Several vaccine manufacturers have published their Phase 3 trials

90

confirming the safety and efficacy of the vaccine [3-5]. However, such unprecedented scientific

91

achievement is challenged by the hesitancy of HCWs to accept vaccination [6]. In an earlier

92

study from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), 70% of the 1521 HCWs surveyed were willing to

93

receive the COVID-19 vaccine [6]. Another study showed that 63% of the nurses surveyed were

94

willing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine [7]. In two studies, the acceptance of the COVID-19

95

vaccine among adults was found to be between 58% and 69% [8, 9]. The KSA granted

96

Pfizer/BioNTech emergency use authorization for the BNT162b2 vaccine on December 10,

97

2020, becoming the fourth country to do so after the United Kingdom, Bahrain, and Canada [10,

98

11]. On that same day, the Ministry of Health (MoH) sent out mass short message service texts

99

and emails to all HCWs in the country encouraging them to voluntarily enroll for vaccine uptake

100

through a dedicated smartphone application or the MoH website. COVID-19 vaccine rollout

101

began on December 17, 2020. This study was conducted to evaluate vaccine enrollment and

102

uptake within the first month of its rollout among HCWs in the KSA.

Method
Data collection
This national cross-sectional survey was conducted among HCWs in Saudi Arabia during

107

the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected between December 27, 2020 and January 3, 2021.

108

At the time of data collection, the national coronavirus vaccination campaign had already

109

begun in the KSA, with HCWs as one of the prioritized groups. HCWs were surveyed regarding

110

their intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Participants were invited using a convenience

111

sampling technique. We used several social media platforms and email lists to recruit

112

participants. The survey was a pilot-validated, self-administered questionnaire that was sent to

113

HCWs through SurveyMonkey

114

surveys via the web. The questionnaire was adapted from our previously published studies with

115

modification and additions related to the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

116

(SARS-CoV-2) variant of concern (VoC) [6, 12, 13].

, a platform that allows researchers to deploy and analyze

The questions asked about respondents’ demographic characteristics (job category, age,

118

gender, years of clinical experience, and work area), previous exposure to COVID-19 patients,

119

previous COVID-19 infection, and travel history in the prior 3 months. We assessed the level of

120

intention to and actual receipt (i.e., uptake) of the COVID-19 vaccine among HCWs. In addition,

121

we assessed factors affecting respondents’ intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, including

122

their level of awareness of the new SARS-CoV-2 VoC and sources of information. HCWs’ anxiety

123

was measured by the validated 7-item General Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaire, which

124

has been used in several studies assessing HCWs’ anxiety levels during the pandemic [13, 14].

125

HCWs were informed of the purpose of the study in English at the beginning of the

126

online survey. The respondents were given the opportunity to ask questions via a dedicated

127

email address for the study. The Institutional Review Board at the College of Medicine and King

128

Saud University Medical City approved the study (approval #20/0065/IRB). A waiver for signed

129

consent was obtained since the survey presented no more than a minimal risk to subjects and

130

involved no procedures for which written consent is usually required. To maximize

131

confidentiality, personal identifiers were not required.

134

2.2

Statistical analyses
Descriptive analyses with means and standard deviations were applied to continuous

135

variables, and categorically measured variables were described with frequencies and

136

percentages. Histograms and statistical Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests of normality were used to

137

assess the statistical normality of continuous variables. HCWs’ awareness of the new mutagenic

138

COVID-19 virus strain was measured with eight questions, which received a score of 1 for each

139

correctly answered knowledge/awareness question and 0 for each incorrectly answered

140

question. Total awareness of the mutagenic viral outbreak was measured by adding up the total

141

scores on the knowledge indicators, yielding a mutagenic disease awareness ranging from 0 to

142

8 points.

143

Independent samples t-tests were used to assess the statistical significance of mean

144

scores between the levels of dichotomous categorical variables. Chi-squared tests of

145

independence were used to assess the associations between categorically measured variables

146

with the HCWs’ uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine. The logistic binary regression analysis was

147

used to understand HCWs’ immunization uptake by regressing their sociodemographic, clinical,

148

and professional characteristics and mutant viral strain perceptions against their odds of having

149

actively received the COVID-19 immunization shot or registering for it. The associations

150

between HCWs’ measured independent variables and COVID-19 vaccine uptake were expressed

151

as adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). IBM® SPSS® was used for

152

the statistical data analysis, and significance was considered at the 0.05 alpha level.

Of all the respondents, 352 (33.27%) were enrolled to receive or had already received

163

the vaccine, while 706 (66.73%) did not wish to register for vaccination. The bivariate analysis

164

of association between the respondents’ characteristics and their tendency to receive the

165

vaccine is shown in Table 2. A significantly higher percentage of females compared to males

166

reported not receiving or registering to receive the vaccine (78.5% vs. 21.5%, P < 0.001), and

167

younger age (between 20 and 40 years old) was associated with a significant tendency to

168

decline to receive the vaccine compared to older age groups (P = 0.005). A lower percentage of

169

expatriates reported receiving or registering to receive the vaccine compared to Saudi nationals

170

(P < 0.001).

171
172

A significantly higher percentage of nurses (69.5%) and HCWs working in

public/governmental hospitals (49.8%) had not received or registered to receive the vaccine in

comparison to other clinical roles (P < 0.001) and HCWs in other hospital sectors (P = 0.002).

174

HCWs working in university hospitals (44.9%, P = 0.002) and tertiary care hospitals (74.1%, P =

175

0.048) were more inclined to receive the vaccine.

176

HCWs’ previous infection with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, previous contact with

177

COVID-19 patients, and their travel history over the last 3 months were not correlated with

178

their vaccine uptake. The respondents who were inclined to receive the vaccine were

179

significantly less dependent on using social media as a source of information and had a

180

significantly lower GAD-7 score, higher awareness about the new VoC, and lower level of worry

181

about travelling abroad.

A binomial logistic regression was performed to analyze the independent association between

189

HCWs’ characteristics and their vaccine uptake behavior as shown in Table 3. Females were

190

significantly less likely to receive or register to receive the vaccine (aOR = 0.287, P < 0.001),

191

while older age (aOR = 1.021, P = 0.032) and Saudi nationality (aOR = 1.918, P = 0.001) were

192

associated with an increased likelihood of vaccine uptake. Intensive care unit (ICU) staff (aOR =

193

1.495, P = 0.014) and staff working in university hospitals (aOR = 1.867, P < 0.001) were also

194

significantly and independently more likely to receive or register to receive the vaccine. A

195

higher level of awareness of the VoC also significantly predicted vaccine uptake among HCWs

196

(aOR = 1.131, P = 0.047). HCWs’ level of anxiety as measured by their GAD-7 score, history of

197

travelling abroad over the previous 3 months, and personal history of previous polymerase

198

chain reaction (PCR)-positive COVID-19 did not independently predict their vaccine uptake

behavior. Figure 1 illustrates the linear incremental relation between HCWs’ age and the

to almost 45% for those over 50 years of age.

Discussion
In this reported national survey on COVID-19 vaccine uptake in one of the first countries

212

to roll out the BNT162b2 vaccine, only 352 (33.3%) of 1,058 HCWs had either registered

213

to/received the vaccine within 3 weeks of its availability. In a previous cross-sectional survey to

214

assess HCWs’ COVID-19 vaccine confidence and hesitancy prior to launching a vaccine campaign

215

in the KSA, 70% were willing to receive a vaccine once available[6]. Additionally, half of the

216

participants indicated that they would receive the vaccine as soon as it became available, while

217

more than one-third preferred delaying receiving it for a few months. In a study that specifically

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.29.21250749; this version posted February 1, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

218

focused on vaccine acceptance according to vaccine type, only 20.9% were willing to receive

219

BNT162b2 [15]. The low vaccine uptake reported in the current study, together with HCWs’

220

earlier reports of preferring to delay getting vaccinated, is alarming and should trigger public

221

health officials to target these groups with campaigns to enhance their vaccine confidence and

222

acceptance.

223

In the current study, two-thirds of participants were female, almost 60% were nurses,

224

70% were expatriates, and the majority worked at tertiary care hospitals. These findings are

225

similar to a previous study that was conducted prior to the vaccine rollout [6]. However, that

226

study included only 50% nurses. In this study, 69% of nurses had neither received nor registered

227

to receive the vaccine, while half of the physicians had. This is similar to influenza vaccine

228

uptake among HCWs, as it has been reported that physicians have significantly higher flu

229

vaccination rates compared to nurses [16, 17].

230

Almost all of the participants worked in clinical areas, and 80% managed COVID-19

231

patients. HCWs working in clinical areas other than the ICU, such as the emergency room (ER)

232

and wards, did not converge significantly on their vaccine uptake. In an influenza vaccine

233

uptake study, only working in the building where the vaccination was being performed made a

234

significant difference [18].

235

HCWs from university hospitals were found to be significantly more likely to receive the

236

vaccine than those working in private and public sectors. Additionally, HCWs in tertiary

237

healthcare settings were significantly more likely to get the vaccine than those working in

238

primary and secondary healthcare settings. In a systematic review on influenza vaccination

239

among HCWs, the top reason for vaccine uptake was self-protection rather than protecting

240

patients or setting an example for their patients, with no observed difference in hospital

241

settings [19].

242

A gender difference was observed in the vaccine uptake, with female HCWs being

243

significantly less likely to receive the vaccine than male HCWs (P < 0.001). The discrepancy

244

between males and females in the uptake of this vaccine is interesting. Male sex was shown to

245

be associated with increased death and ICU admission in a recent meta-analysis of COVID-19

246

patients [20]. However, anti-Spike antibodies declined faster in female than male patients in a

247

recent French study [21]. These differences are important to further enhance our

248

understanding of vaccine uptake and design-specific interventions.

249

While another study showed no effect of age on COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among

250

the general population [22], our study revealed that HCWs over 40 years of age were more

251

motivated to receive the vaccine. This is in contrast to a vaccine intent survey among nurses

252

that showed a stronger COVID-19 vaccination intention among younger workers [7]. While

253

older HCWs are at a higher risk of COVID-19 infection, protection of the entire healthcare

254

workforce is crucial during this pandemic.

255

Saudi HCWs were found to be significantly more likely to receive the vaccine than

256

expatriates (P < 0.001). The KSA has made the COVID-19 vaccine available free of charge to all

257

citizens and residents. A previous study found a disparity in the outcome of patients infected

258

with SARS-CoV-2 in relation to gender and ethnicity [23]. In a study among blood donors in the

259

KSA, non-Saudis were found to be more likely to have positive SARS-CoV-2 serology [24]. These

260

differences between Saudi and expatriates deserve further study in order to understand the

261

factors contributing to this disparity, which could allow for strategies and communication plans

262

to alleviate the risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and enhance the acceptance of the COVID-19

263

vaccine among the population.

264

HCWs’ clinical role was correlated with their uptake of the vaccine in the bivariate

265

analysis. Nurses were found to be significantly less inclined to receive the vaccine than

266

physicians and other professionals (P < 0.001), which is similar to a previous study from the KSA

267

[6]. The multivariate analysis did not show any significant differences between location with the

268

exception of ICU staff, who were significantly more inclined to receive the vaccine (aOR = 1.495,

269

P = 0.014). HCWs are more likely to acquire vaccine-preventable diseases, with 20% of HCWs

270

contracting influenza annually, recent reports showed low influenza vaccine uptake among

271

doctors and nurses (56.5% and 34.8% acceptance rate, respectively)[25].

272

Interestingly, no significant differences in vaccine uptake were found between HCWs

273

who managed COVID-19 patients compared to those who did not or between HCWs with

274

previous COVID-19 infections compared to those without. The low COVID-19 vaccine uptake

275

rate in the middle of a pandemic is alarming, and efforts should focus on increasing vaccine

276

acceptance and uptake to match the speed of the pandemic.

277

The VoC-202012/01 emerged in December 2020, resulting in new travel restrictions

278

[26]. However, there is evidence that the BNT162b2 vaccine is effective against this variant

279

based on in-vitro studies [27]. In this study, vaccine uptake was not influenced by HCWs’ travel

280

history. However, the overall sample size of returning travelers was small and may not be

281

representative. Information on evolving variants are emerging in various countries [28], and

282

concerns regarding the vaccine’s efficacy against these variants may hinder vaccine uptake. This

283

is a concerning situation that warrants further study.

284

Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccination was considered an emotionally

285

charged topic in many cultures [29]. However, vaccine hesitancy is common and includes

286

people who have not yet rejected vaccination but do not trust the institutions connected to the

287

vaccine [30]. Current recommendations suggest not only to make a safe and effective vaccine

288

available but also deep engagement of around the human element to build public trust in any

289

vaccine [31]. This highlights the importance of addressing societal concerns and fears to ensure

290

a vaccination campaign’s success [32]. Personal worries and baseline anxiety should not be

291

neglected as these could trigger vaccine refusal in the community via the butterfly effect.

292

Findings in the current study highlight how HCWs, especially those with lower GAD-7 scores,

293

were more likely to accept the new vaccine. It also provides a glimpse of the relationship

294

between higher awareness (in this case, of the new variant) and the likelihood of considering

295

vaccination.

296

The use of social media for information could greatly affect HCWs’ and the general

297

populations’ COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. While some studies did not find associations

298

between willingness to vaccinate and social media use [22, 33], others found a higher

299

vaccination willingness among respondents from the general population who did not rely on

300

social media for COVID-19 information [34, 35]. One study assessed the attitudes towards

301

COVID-19 vaccines using the Vaccine Conspiracy Belief Scale and showed higher conspiracy

302

beliefs among respondents who relied on social media platforms as their main source of

303

information [35].

Study limitations and strengths/future potential
This study is subject to the limitations of cross-sectional surveys, including sampling,

307

response, and recall biases. While this work did not explore the reasons why HCWs did not

308

register for the vaccine, it presents their initial vaccination acceptance, which needs to be

309

explored in future studies. It should be noted that HCWs’ perceptions and vaccine hesitancy

310

may differ from one country to another.

4.2

Conclusion
This study observed a low level of COVID-19 vaccine enrollment among HCWs during the

314

first month of the vaccine rollout in one of the first countries to roll out the vaccine. Public

315

health officials should scale up their efforts to increase vaccine acceptance and uptake among

316

HCWs to match the speed of the growing pandemic. Optimizing protection of HCWs through

317

vaccination and encouraging them to subsequently recommend vaccination to their patients is

318

vital to curbing this global crisis.
