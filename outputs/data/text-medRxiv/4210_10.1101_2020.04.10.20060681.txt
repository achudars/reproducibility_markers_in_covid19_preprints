A Stratified Model to Quantify the Effects of Containment Policies on the
Spread of COVID-19
Vahid S. Bokharaie∗

Summary
Background
The SARS-Cov-2 virus is spreading fast all over the world and has already imposed a significant social and
economic cost in many countries. Different countries have utilised a variety of containment policies with
an emphasis on social distancing as a strategy to stop the spread of COVID-19. Quantifying the effects of
such policies in different time-scales and comparing the efficacy of various available policies is of utmost
importance for policy-makers in different countries. That is even more important when the policy-makers
want to plan for long-term strategies and to weigh each option based on its epidemiological effects and
socio-economic costs. In the absence of detailed knowledge of the interactions between individuals in
a population and the characteristics of the SARS-Cov-2 virus, quantifying the effects of these policies is
very difficult. Hence, there is an immediate need for models that can predict the spread of COVID-19 in
a population, without the need for such detailed information.
The Method
In this manuscript, a method is presented that can be used to predict the spread of COVID-19 in any
country and under any containment policy imposed separately on different groups in the population.
The method tunes the parameters of a known stratified model based on the available data on the spread
of COVID-19. The model includes a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations and is easy to simulate
and easy to understand. As it is presented in this manuscript, the population is divided into age-groups.
But given the availability of the data, there is no reason to limit the stratification into only age-groups and
we can consider any relevant groups. To estimate the parameters of the model such that it reflects the
characteristics of the spread of COVID-19 in a population, the method relies on an optimisation scheme.
More specifically, the optimisation scheme estimates the contact rates between different age groups in
the population. But a very important and useful feature of the model is that the estimated parameters for
one population can be translated and used for any other population with a known age-structure, which
in this day and age, includes almost any country or city in the world. Also, it is shown that the method
is quite insensitive to the underlying assumptions in the optimisation scheme and also to deliberate or
non-deliberate errors that might have occurred in collecting the data.
Results
The capabilities of the model are demonstrated using a case study under different containment policies,
from an uncontained population to mitigation and suppression policies. Also, we can use the model to
quantify the effects of strategies which include switching between different containment policies at predetermined points in time. The model allows us to quantify the effects of each of these policies on the
spread of the disease in a population, in particular, the instantaneous and total numbers of infectious
individuals in a population which are important parameters for policy-makers. The simulation results,
as explained in the following, provide some insight into various policies and some of the results are
possibly counter-intuitive for many people. For example, the model predicts that closing down schools
and universities without any other containment policy imposed on older age-groups has almost no impact
on the number of patients that might need support-care in hospitals. The method provides an easy-to-use
tool to use the information collected on the spread of COVID-19 in a country or region and then use that
information in another population which might not have been as widely affected by the disease yet.

1 Introduction

19 to be infected again [11], which if proved to be
a common phenomenon, then SIS models would be
more suitable for COVID-19. But in the absence of
overwhelming evidence to the contrary, assuming
short-term immunity for COVID-19 seems to be a
reasonable choice. Although in the interest of completeness, the mathematical descriptions for both
SIS and SIR models are presented in Section S.1.
One important feature of the model used in this
manuscript is that in the model, each compartment
is divided into groups. The choice of how to group
the population is completely arbitrary from a theoretical perspective. But from a practical point of
view, such a choice should be informed by the characteristics of the disease and also the availability of
the relevant data used to tune the parameters of
the model. And in that regard, a very good choice
for modelling the spread of COVID-19 is to divide
the population into age groups. More specifically,
the population in each compartment S, I and R is
divided into nine age groups 0-10, 10-20, ..., 70-80
and 80+. And the subsequent model is a set of 3×9
nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs)
with some unknown parameters which we should
estimate based on the known characteristics of the
SARS-CoV-2 virus. These parameters are transfer
rates, and contact rates. Transfer rate, represented
with γi for each of the age-groups i = 1, · · · , 9, is
the rate at which individuals leave the Infectious
compartment and is relatively easy to estimate. It
depends on the average time period between the
moment an individual becomes Infectious and the
moment that the individuals are considered cured
or die. There are some estimates for this time
period, as reported in [2]. I have assumed this
time-period for COVID-19 to be 20 days. Considering one day to be the unit of time, and assuming
this time-period is on average the same for all age
groups, then γi = 0.05 for i = 1, · · · , 9.
Another set of parameters are contact rates, represented with βij for i, j = 1, · · · , 9 which denote
the rate at which Susceptibles in age-group i are
infected by Infectious individuals in age-group j.
Contact rates are very difficult to estimate because
they capture various characteristics of the population and the dynamics of the virus. Their value can
depend on the average number of direct contacts
between the members of different groups, which
needs a comprehensive and detailed analysis of
the behaviour and mobility of the individuals in a
population. Contact rates can also depend on the
differences in susceptibility of each age-group to
the virus and also on the mechanisms of its transmission. Hence, to directly calculate the values
of contact rates is a monumental task that even
if possible, might be extremely difficult and timeconsuming.
In this manuscript, a method is presented that
allows us to overcome the difficulties in estimat-

There is an abundance of mathematical models
of various degrees of sophistication to model the
spread of a disease in a population. But there
are usually two problems in using these models for
real-world applications. One is the difficulty in estimating the values of the parameters of the model
based on the characteristics of the disease and the
host population. Second is how to translate the
requirements of different containment policies to
meaningful changes in the parameters of the mathematical model.
There have been some efforts to address both of
these issues. The most notable among them for
COVID-19 is [9] which is based on long-term effort going back to at least [10]. But those models rely on a detailed knowledge of the population under study which is not easy to replicate for
many countries which have not been the subject of
similar studies. To fill this gap and to provide an
easy to use tool for policy-makers in different countries/regions/cities, in this manuscript, a known
stratified epidemiological model is used to predict
the spread of COVID-19 in an uncontained population. In the model, the population is divided into
different age-groups, as will be explained shortly.
Hence, the model can be used to quantify the effects of various containment policies that affect different age-groups differently. The parameters of
the model are estimated based on available data
on the early stages of the progress of COVID-19 in
China. Although the parameters of the model are
estimated based on the data collected from China,
as we will see in the following, the structure of the
model allows us to adapt these parameters for any
other country or any population with a known age
structure.
2 Methods
The mathematical model used for the spread of
COVID-19 is an SIR compartmental model, as detailed in SI Section S.1.1. In such models, the population is divided into compartments that capture
different stages in the progress of that disease. The
three compartments are Susceptible, S, which includes those who are healthy and can be infected
with the virus; Infectious, I, which includes those
who are infected and can transmit the disease; and
Removed, R, which includes those who were Infectious but are not any more, because they recovered or because they died. This choice is guided
by the common consensus among immunologists
that people have short-term immunity to seasonal
coronaviruses. For the SARS-CoV-2 virus, it is already shown to be the case for Macaque monkeys
in [5] and for humans in [4]. Although there has
been a report of a patient recovered from COVID2

ing contact rates between individuals or groups in
a population, and estimate these parameters indirectly based on the available data. The method
uses an optimisation scheme to achieve this goal.
The optimisation scheme is based on two distinct
but important sets of data on the spread of COVID19. One is the estimate for basic reproduction number, R0 , for COVID-19 in the early stages of the
spread of the virus. There are various estimates
for that parameter, but the one reported in [15],
which is R0 = 2.28 is used in this manuscript. A few
other groups have also reported values very close to
that [2]. The other piece of information is coming
from [1], which shows the relative distribution of
confirmed cases of COVID-19 in each age-group in
China as of February 11th, as shown in SI Section
S.2. Up until two weeks before this date, Chinese
authorities did not impose any meaningful containment strategies and the virus was spreading in an
uncontained population. Hence we can assume to
most part these numbers are the results of the uncontained spread of the virus. But what makes the
adopted optimisation scheme so effective is that it
relies on the ratio of confirmed cases in age-groups,
not their absolute values. The advantage of this
choice is that it makes the resulting model quite insensitive to the underlying assumptions in the optimisation scheme. The other advantage is that relying on the absolute numbers of confirmed cases can
make the methodology vulnerable to deliberate or
non-deliberate errors that might have occurred in
the reported data. But assuming similar probabilities of occurrences of such errors in different agegroups, the ratio between these values would be
less affected.
Mathematical details of both the model and the
optimisation schemes are explained in detail in the
Supplementary Information section. The important
thing to keep in mind is that although the optimisation scheme uses data collected from China, the
structure of the mathematical model is such that
it allows us to use the obtained values for contact
rates in any other population or country. The model
has some advantages and disadvantages which are
discussed in Section 4. But it can serve as a useful
first step to evaluate various containment policies
in different countries. Next section explains some
of these applications.

has been chosen as a case study mainly because
among the countries which are affected sooner and
wider, has been the one with almost no effective
containment strategy in place, and such a policy
can lead to consequences as explained in the next
section.
3.1 Uncontained Spread of the Virus
Let’s consider the case in which COVID-19 is spread
uncontained, i.e. the case that people in the society
interact with each other as in normal times, with
no external or self-imposed restrictions in the interactions.
Figure 1.1 shows how the ratio of Infectious people changes in the 18 months after the introduction
of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the population. And figure
1.2 shows the trajectory of the Removed ratio in
each population. As a reminder, Removed compartment includes those who were Infectious, and then
were cured or died. It should be noted that the
model is not directly concerned with the mortality
rate or the number of those who might need respiratory or intensive care in hospitals. Such information can be inferred from the number of Infectious
and Removed compartments in each country, based
on the available data or estimates.
As can be seen, the model predicts the peak in
the number of Infectious people and the eventual
ratio of the Removed population which varies considerably among different countries. That can be
explained based on differences in the population
pyramids in these countries. For example, in Iran,
66.8% of the population are under 40, while in
Italy only 39.8% are under 40 years old [3]. The
model predicts that countries with an older population would be affected more if they let the virus
spread uncontained, in agreement with for example [9] when comparing mortality rates in the USA
and UK.
To solve any system of Ordinary Differential
Equations (ODEs), apart from the equations themselves, we should also define the initial conditions,
which in our case means the initial ratios of Infectious and Removed populations in each age group.
In all the figures presented in this manuscript, I
have assumed 1 in 10,000 in each age group is Infectious, and the Removed population is 0 in Day 1.
For a country of 10 million, that amounts to 1,000
Infectious in total. We should be cautious in using
a model based on a system of continuous ODEs for
numbers lower than that. It should be noted that
the peak values in Figures 1.1 and 1.2 are barely
affected by the choice of initial conditions. But that
is not true for the time it takes to reach the peak
values. Hence, in order to predict the day in which
the number of Infectious reaches the peak value,
we should have a reasonable estimate of the initial
conditions. But given the fact that usually in early

Using the methodology explained in the previous
section, we can predict the trajectory of Infectious
and Removed compartments in each age group in
any population with a known age-structure (which
includes almost every country in the world). In the
following, we can see results of such simulations for
different countries, with an emphasis on Iran. Iran

remain hidden from authorities, initial conditions
are almost impossible to guess. But the good news
is that having a good estimate of the numbers of
Infectious and Removed ratios in the age groups,
at any moment in time, not necessarily the early
stages of the spread of the disease, allows us to find
the initial conditions that will result in that specific
solution in that specific instance in time, and from
there, we can predict the time to reach the peak
value of the Infectious ratio.

Figures 1.3 and 1.4 show the Infectious and Removed population in each age-group in Iran. As
mentioned in the previous section, the output of
the model is the trajectory of the spread of the disease in each age group, and the plots in Figures
1.1 and 1.2 are calculated using the relative distribution of the population of each country in one
the nine age-groups; 0-10, 10-20, ..., 60-70, 70-80,
80+. The same applies to any aggregate plot presented in this manuscript. This characteristic of the
model is particularly useful when we want to evaluate the effects of different containment strategies
applied to different age groups, as shown in the following.

3.2 Suppression Strategies
The advantage of having a stratified model is that
we can quantitatively evaluate the effects of various containment strategies that affect different
age-groups differently. Table 2 has listed some of
the more common policies and how they are defined. The column under Policy Description defines
to what extent the contacts of some age-groups are
assumed to be decreased under each policy. These
values are chosen intuitively, but any other definitions and any other policies can be easily defined in
the software package that is developed as a part of
this study [6].
As can be seen in Figures 2.1 and 2.2, all the containment policies decrease both the peak instantaneous Infectious ratio and eventual Removed ratio,
which is to be expected. The most effective policy among the ones listed in the Table 2 is Lockdown. Although it does not differ much from SD,
in which individuals in the population have 20% or
25% interactions compared to normal times, compared to only 10% in Lock-down.Depending on the
social and economic circumstances in the country,
the slight decrease in peak Infectious ratios might
not be worth the cost of imposing a much more invasive policy such as total lock-down.
One policy that seems to be performing better
than expected, is KI, shutting down all schools and
universities which is considered as the decrease of
contact rates of age groups 0-10 and 10-20 to 10%
of the normal times. This policy will decrease the
eventual Removed ratio (which is the ratio of the
population which has been Infectious at any time
during the time period of interest) by more than
20%. To see how this huge decrease has happened,
we should have a look at the break-down of the
model outputs in age-groups, as shown in Figure
2.3. As can be seen, this policy has decreased the
Removed ratios in the first two age groups to almost 0, but its effects tend to decrease for other age

groups, to the extent that it is almost non-existent
for 70-80 and 80+ age groups. Added to that the
fact that 17.4% of the Iranian population is in 0 − 10
age range and 13.9% in 10−20, we can see why this
policy has decreased aggregate numbers of the Removed compartment so much. But we can also see
that this policy has less and less effect on the ratio of Removed compartment in older age-groups
who are more vulnerable to COVID-19. Hence this
policy will have a minimal effect on the mortality
rate and the number of patients that need support
care in hospitals. Interestingly enough, the first policy that the Iranian government imposed was shutting down schools and universities. At the time of
writing this text, offices and companies are ordered
to continue their normal operations, after a short
break during the Persian new year holidays, while
schools are kept closed, and while there is no official decree to keep the elderly at home. A policy
that the model show is quite ineffective.
Table 2 also shows the basic reproduction number, R0 , for each policies. As can be seen in Figure
2.1, and as it is well-known in epidemiology, when
R0 < 1, the disease starts to disappear from the
population. But as importantly, bringing the ratio of
the Infectious population down to a small enough
ratio of the total population can take months, even
if we impose a total lock-down strategy (the exact time depends on the ratio of Infectious when
we start the policy). And maintaining such a strategy might not be feasible in many countries with a
more fragile economy. In the next section, we will
see what happens if we switch between different
strategies as a long-term plan.

when the number of Infectious people grows fast
and we need to immediately lower the growth rate.
Without such policies, Iran, or any other society for
that matter, will face a humanitarian disaster, and
the whole purpose of this report is to highlight this
imminent threat.
But let’s assume that there is an immediate containment policy in place and the ratio of the Infectious population starts to drop. As we saw, bringing down the ratio of Infectious to a level that can
be considered small enough for eradicating the disease from the population can take months. And the
economy might collapse if such a stringent strategy
imposed for such a time-period. Apart from that,
even if the virus is eradicated in one country, in

our globalised and connected world there is always
the possibility that the virus is re-introduced from
other countries who have not imposed containment
strategies. So, the natural question is, what policy
is suitable as a long-term strategy?
Let’s first see what kind of policy can keep R0
close to 1.0, so the Infectious ratio does not increase, even if it does not decrease in the shortterm. To find the answer to that, we need to run an

tact rates in each age group which would bring R0
from the original estimated 2.28 for the spread of
COVID-19 in an uncontained population, to around
1.00. In the simplest case, when we decide to impose a uniform policy to all age groups, the coefficient is 0.4386 or 43.86%. It means that if everybody
brings down their direct contacts with other individuals to 44% of what it was in the normal times in
Iran, the ratio of Infectious would stay the same or
decrease at a slow pace. Please note that this value
applies to the age structure of Iran and is different
for other countries. This value is calculated using
the same optimisation algorithm as explained in SI
Section S.2, but with a different objective function.
Now let’s see how these values change if we want
to impose different policies for each age group. To
make it realistic, I have assumed a different policy
for people under 20, between 20 and 70, as the
workforce in the society, and above 70. And let’s
assume the minimum feasible coefficient is 10% for
all age groups. Running the optimisation scheme
again, we get values of [15.76%, 14.39%, 99.92%]
for the three age brackets, 0-20, 20-70, and 70+.
But bringing down the interactions of the working force to 14% of the normal level while not enforcing any changes to the contacts of the elderly
does not seem like a sound policy. Let’s set a lower
threshold of 40% to the interactions of the working force and keep it at 10% for the other two
age ranges. Also, let’s set an upper limit of 20%
on the interactions of 70-80 and 80+ age groups,
meaning we ask them to self-isolate until further
notice, and an upper limit of 50% for people in 020 age-bracket. The optimised coefficients are now
[29.84%, 60.74%, 10.15%]. So, under such a policy, if
kids and teenagers’ interactions are brought down
to around 30%, adults to 61% and elderly to 10%,
number of Infectious would stay more or less the
same for a long period of time.
To bring this idea one step further, let’s assume
we plan to impose a switching policy, i.e. we
switch between uncontained and different containment strategies at pre-specified time points. To clarify, let’s assume we impose a lock-down strategy for
30 days, and then remove the regulations for 30
days to ease the economic burden, and continue
the switching for a few times. Figures 3.1 and 3.2
shows how the spread of the virus changes. As
can be seen, the ratio of Infectious follows a seasaw pattern and in general decreases. Given that
we switch to the uncontained policy, it is no surprise that the decrease does not happen as fast as
the continuous lock-down policy. Nonetheless, we
have managed to stop the Infectious ratio to reach
its potential peak value and ease the burden on the
healthcare system in the most critical time.
Now let’s add the R0 = 1.0 policy to the mix.
This time we switch between uncontained, lockdown and R0 = 1.0 policies. Figures 3.3 and 3.4

show how Infectious and Removed ratios change
under such a policy. Since this time there are 60
and not 30 days between uncontained periods, we
see a more significant decrease in the Infectious ratio. But that means more people in the population
remain susceptible, and if we stop the containment
strategy too early, the Infectious ratios bounce back
to a greater degree compared to the previous case.
And as the last switching policy, let’s consider
switching between uncontained and R0 = 1.0 policies. As expected, such a relatively lax policy has a
more attenuated effect on the Infectious ratio. But
if any of the previous policies cannot be imposed in
a country, policies such as this one can at least ease
the burden on the healthcare systems by temporally
distributing the Infectious population.

different age groups or on the whole population.
The output of the model is the ratio of Infectious
and Removed population in each age-group. The
Removed population includes those who have been
Infectious and then recovered or died. The main
advantage of the model is that it needs no a priori
knowledge of the interactions between individuals
in a population, or how the virus affects each agegroup. The contact rates are estimated based on
the available data on the spread of COVID-19. The
model itself is a set of nonlinear Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), hence simulating various
containment policies in different time frames does
need any special computational power.
But the methodology has some shortcomings that
we should keep in mind while interpreting the results. The method assumes the virus affects individuals (of the same age) in different countries
similarly. If it is the case that the differences in
genetic backgrounds or vaccination histories in different countries can affect the infection rate, such
differences would be lost in this model. Also, it is
an implicit assumption in the model that the general interactions between people in different coun-

tries and societies are in general similar to each
other. To clarify the point, if, for example, people
older than 70 years in one country live with or have
more contacts with the next generations, and in another country, they live in isolation or in nursing
homes, then such differences in contacts between
age groups are lost in the model. Another issue
we should keep in mind relates to the test dataset
used in this paper, which was the number of confirmed cases in China in each age-group as of February 11th, and from that, we calculated the desired
ratios between the states of the model. And my understanding is that these confirmed COVID-19 cases
has been mostly those who have developed symptoms. Hence, the implicit assumption is that the
ratio of symptomatic to total number of those infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus is the same for all age
groups. If this assumption is proven to be wrong,
then the symptomatic to total infected ratio should
also be incorporated in calculating the desired ratios between the states of the models.
The method can be extended in various directions to make the results even more useful. We

can, for example, divide each age-group into subgroups based on their vulnerability to the virus, or
based on the relative amount of interactions with
other individuals in the population. For example,
we can divide the population in each group to those
with normal levels of contacts, and two sub-groups
with one order of magnitude less or more contacts
with other members of the populace. Even a rough
estimate of the relative numbers of these three subgroups in each age group can give us more insight
into more effective ways to contain the spread of
the virus with less social and economic impact. The
compartmental model can be extended if necessary.
For example, we can add compartment E to include
latent periods, if it is shown such a time-period is
significant in COVID-19. Also, in this manuscript, I
have assumed a simultaneous introduction of the
virus to different cities and regions in a country,
which is not always a realistic choice. Given the fact
that nowadays the population structure in different
cities/regions in almost every country is known, we
can use the model to describe the spread of the
virus for each region or city, and then, assuming
in and out-flow traffic to each city is known, consider them as exogenous inputs to our system of
ODEs. That would allow us to consider time-lags
that might exist in the spread of COVID-19 to different parts of a country. But even as it is, this model
with its estimated parameters can be a useful tool
for different policy-makers in different countries.

S.1.2 SIS Model

S.1 The Mathematical Model

Although we only use the SIR model in this
manuscript, SIS is also presented here, both in the
interest of completeness and to provide a theoretical basis for the SIR discussions. The formulation
presented in this section is adopted from [8]. In
this model, the population of interest is first divided
into two compartments S, Susceptibles, and I, Infectious. For COVID-19, if a latent period exists, it
seems to be negligible for practical purposes [12].
Otherwise, we can add another compartment called
E, for Exposed, of those who are infected but not
yet Infectious. Each compartment is sub-divided
into n groups. These groups can represent different age groups, different health conditions, professions, etc. In this manuscript, I consider the population in each compartment is divided into n = 9
age-groups defined as 0-10, 10-20, ..., 70-80 and
80+.
Let Ii (t) and Si (t) be the number of Infectious
and Susceptibles at time t in group i for i =
1, · · · , n, respectively. Also, let Ni (t) = Si (t) + Ii (t)
be the total population of group i. The total population of each group is assumed to be constant;
formally, Ni (t) = Ni . This does not oversimplify
the model, especially when the total population is
significantly greater than the number of Infectious,
which is still the case for COVID-19 at the time of
writing this manuscript. But even if that assumption is not deemed realistic for a population, the
formulation stated below can be easily altered accordingly.
Here, βij , the contact rate between groups i and
j, denotes the rate at which Susceptibles in group
i are infected by Infectious in group j for i, j =
1, · · · , n. Further, γi , the transfer rate, is the rate at
which an infective individual in the group i leaves
the Infectious compartment. We also consider birth
and death in the population, although to keep the
total population constant, we should set the birth
and death rates in each age-group to be the same
value µi . Using the mass-action law, the basic SIS
model is then described as follows [8]:

To understand the model discussed in this section,
it is enough to know the basics of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) and some basic concepts
in linear algebra are needed. Although knowing
the following notations and reminding some basic
definitions can be helpful.
S.1.1 Notations and Some Basic Definitions
R is the field of real numbers and R+ is The set of
non-negative real numbers. Rn is The space of column vectors of size n of real numbers and Rn×n is
The space of n × n matrices of real numbers. I use
xi to represent The ith entry of the vector x in Rn ,
for i ∈ {1, · · · , n}. Please note that x0 is a vector
in Rn that usually represents initial condition. Notation aij is used for (i, j) entry of the matrix A.
D = diag (x) is an n × n diagonal matrix in which
dii = xi for all i. A−1 is The inverse of the matrix
A. I is the identity matrix of proper dimensions and
0 is the zero matrix of proper dimensions. σ(A) is
the set of all eigenvalues (spectrum) of the matrix
A. ρ(A) is the spectral radius of the matrix A, i.e.
the maximum of the absolute values of all eigenvalues. µ(A) is The spectral abscissa of the matrix
A.
A  B means aij > bij , for all i, j ∈ {1, · · · , n}.
It should not be mistaken with Positive Definite
(PD) matrices. A > B means aij ≥ bij , for all
i, j ∈ {1, · · · , n} and A 6= B and A ≥ B means
aij ≥ bij , for all i, j ∈ {1, · · · , n}. Rn+ is The
positive orthant of Rn , given by {x ∈ Rn : x ≥ 0}.

Knowing the following basic definitions can help
in understanding the text better.
A matrix A is called Hurwitz, if µ(A) < 0.
A real n × n matrix A = (aij ) is Metzler if its
off-diagonal entries are non-negative.
The matrix A is irreducible if and only if for every non-empty proper subset K of N := {1, · · · , n},
there exists an i ∈ K, j ∈ N \ K such that aij 6= 0.

S.3 Normalised Contact rates for COVID-19
Below, you can find the normalised values of contact rates for the spread of COVID-19 in different populations. These are the results of the optimisation scheme described in SI Section S.2. You can insert
these values in the SIR model, (6) in Section S.1.2 or (7) in Section S.1.3, and then solve the ODE with
any desired initial conditions to calculate the trajectory of Infectious and Removed populations in each
age-group. But please note that in those equations, you need β̃i,j which is calculated as β̃i,j = βi,j Nj /Ni ,
in which βi,j is the element in row i, column j of the matrix B defined below, and Ni and Ni are the
relative ratios of age groups i and j in the population of interest. As a reminder, the nine age groups used
in this manuscript are defined as 0-10, 10-20, ..., 60-70, 70-80 and 80+. You can find the age structure
of countries in many online resources, for example in [3]. Also, the values of contact rates for both SIS
and SIR models, and the code used to run the model and generate the figures we saw in this manuscript
can be found in a publicly available online repository [6].
As a last note, when applying a containment policy, the values of the contact rates should be changed
accordingly. As an example, when a policy requires the contacts between the first age-group, [0 − 10], is
decreased to 10% of the uncontained case, the values of the first row of the matrix B should be multiplied
by 0.1.
