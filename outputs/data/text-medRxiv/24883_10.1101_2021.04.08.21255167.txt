Among 30 consecutive patients reporting persistent symptoms (median 6 months)
self-attributed to COVID-19, pain, fatigue and disability were reported in virtually all
patients.
More than one third of patients suffer from psychological disorders such as anxiety,
depression and/or post-traumatic stress disorder, regardless of SARS-CoV-2
immunity.
At the time of evaluation, only 50% of patients had cellular and/or humoral sign of a
past SARS-CoV-2, and serology positivity varied depending of the kit used.
Exhaustive clinical, biological and immunological evaluations failed to find an
alternative diagnosis, or to identify specific cytokine signature including type I
interferon.

Abstract

67
68

Background: COVID-19 long-haulers or “long-COVID” represent 10% of COVID-19

69

patients and remain understudied.

70

Methods: In this prospective study, we recruited 30 consecutive patients seeking medical

71

help for persistent symptoms (> 30 days) attributed to COVID-19. All reported a viral illness

72

compatible with COVID-19. The patients underwent a multi-modal evaluation including

73

clinical, psychological, virological, specific immunological assays and were followed

74

longitudinally.

75

Results The median age was 40 [interquartile range: 35-54] and 18 (60%) were female. After

76

a median time of 152 [102-164] days after symptom onset, fever, cough and dyspnea were

77

less frequently reported as compared with the initial presentation, but paresthesia and burning

78

pain emerged in 18 (60%) and 13 (43%) patients, respectively. The clinical examination was

79

unremarkable in all patients although the median fatigue and pain visual analogic scales were

80

7 [5-8] and 5 [2-6], respectively.

81

Extensive biological studies were unremarkable, as were multiplex cytokine and ultra-

82

sensitive interferon-a2 measurements. At this time, nasopharyngeal swab and stool RT-PCR

83

were negative for all tested patients. Using SARS-CoV-2 serology and IFN-γ ELISPOT, we

84

found evidence of a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection in 50% (15/30) of patients, with

85

objective evidence of lack or waning of immune response in two. Finally, psychiatric

86

evaluation showed that 11 (36.7%), 13 (43.3%) and 9 (30%) patients had a positive screening

87

for anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, respectively.

88

Conclusions Half of patients seeking medical help for long-COVID lack SARS-CoV-2

89

immunity. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 immunity did not cluster clinically or biologically

90

long haulers, who reported severe fatigue, altered quality of life, and exhibited psychological

91

distress.

Introduction

93

After SARS-CoV-2 infection, some patients may continue to experience symptoms for

94

months (1), a condition called “long-COVID” or “COVID-19 long-haulers” (2). These long-

95

term symptoms contribute to the worldwide COVID-19 burden and have been extensively

96

communicated by the patients and some physicians (3,4). Long-COVID manifestations are

97

clinically diverse, and their underlying mechanisms are likely to be multiple. Patients who

98

underwent long hospitalization because of severe disease may exhibit lung or heart chronic

99

injury due to the severe immune response (5,6), micro- or macrovascular thrombotic

100

neurological complications (7), and/or physical deconditioning (8). Indeed, a recent cohort

101

study found that among 1733 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 76% reported at least one

102

symptom after 6 months, and objective pulmonary abnormalities were found in more than

103

20% (9). However, these pathological mechanisms are less likely to explain the

104

manifestations in patients with initially non-severe COVID-19 who experience long-lasting

105

symptoms. Although 10% of COVID-19 patients may show chronic symptoms (>12 weeks)

106

(10), only scarce data are available on the clinical presentation, biological characteristics and

107

overall prognosis of such patients (11,12). Moreover, the virological definition of the long-

108

COVID entity in terms of serology and other specific immunological assays is still not

109

precisely established (11,13).

110

The aim of our study was to refine the clinical and biological characteristics of long-COVID

111

by conducting a multimodal evaluation of consecutive patients seeking medical help for

112

persistent symptoms attributed to COVID-19 (long-COVID).

Methods

115

Patients and ethical considerations

116

We included 34 consecutive patients seeking medical help for persistent symptoms attributed

117

to COVID-19 for a systematic prospective study. Patients were recruited in the “Grand-Est”

118

region of France, the area with the highest incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection during the

119

first epidemical wave in France (February to April 2020) (14). Information about a long-

120

COVID consultation in our tertiary center was advertised through local media and social

121

networks, and consulting patients were then asked to participate in the study. All patients

122

provided written informed consent. Age-matched patients with a history of non-severe

123

COVID-19 (positive humoral and cellular response) without persistent symptoms were

124

controls for the immunological assays. This study is part of the “COVID-HUS” study, which

125

was approved by the ethics committee of the University Hospital of Strasbourg (NCE–2020–

126

51).

127

128

Medical evaluation

129

All patients were evaluated at our reference center for rare systemic and autoimmune

130

diseases. Five physicians (MS, RF, EC, LP and JS) conducted the clinical evaluation with a

131

physical examination and a standardized questionnaire on medical and SARS-CoV-2–related

132

infection history. Dedicated questionnaires were used to evaluate subjective symptoms: DN4

133

for neuropathic pain (15), Fibromyalgia Rapid Screening Tool (FiRST (16)) and visual

134

analog scales for fatigue/pain/dryness. Additionally, patients underwent systematic blood

135

testing to rule out alternative diagnoses (full list in supplementary file 1).

138

Blood samples were collected at the same time as the clinical evaluation for immuno-

139

virologic assays. The testing included extensive serology evaluation with 4 commercial

140

assays. One lateral flow assay tested for the receptor binding 2 (RBD) of the spike protein as

141

an antigenic source (Biosynex BSS IgM/IgG assay), and two enzyme-linked immunosorbent

142

assays (ELISA) targeted the RBD (Wantai total antibody) and the S1 domain (Euroimmun

143

IgG). Finally, ELISA was used to detect anti-nucleocapsid (anti-N) IgG (Abbott Architect

144

IgG). To explore the SARS-CoV-2–specific T-cell response, heparin-anticoagulated blood

145

tubes were collected for interferon gamma (IFN-γ) enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT)

146

assay. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated by using Ficoll-Paque gradient, and

147

CD3+ cell frequencies were measured by flow cytometry. Anti–IFN-γ antibody-coated wells

148

(UCytech) were seeded with 200,000 CD3+ cells per well. Cells were stimulated in duplicate

149

with overlapping 15-mer peptide pools spanning SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins (spike

150

protein [S1 and S2], nucleoprotein, membrane and envelope proteins) and accessory proteins

151

(NS3, NS7A, NS8, NS9B) as well as the spike glycoprotein of human coronaviruses 229E

152

(ES1, ES2) and OC43 (OS1, OS2) (PepMix, JPT Peptide Technologies). Culture medium

153

was a negative control and phytohemagglutinin (PHA) a positive control. Peripheral blood

154

mononuclear cells were cultured overnight (20 ± 4 hr) before enzymatic revelation of IFN-

155

capture (UCytech). Spots were counted by using an ELISPOT reader (AID) and results are

156

expressed as mean number of spot-forming units/106 CD3+ cells after subtraction of the

157

background value. Positivity was defined as a T-cell response ≥ 3 times the standard

158

deviation of the negative controls. To complete the immunological evaluation, IFN-α2 (with

159

Single Molecule Array; SIMOA, Quanterix (17)) and cytokines (with a custom multiplex

160

cytokine assay; Luminex Thermo Fisher) were measured from serum samples.

163

A standardized interview was conducted by a clinical psychologist (R.A-M). The interview

164

aimed at evaluating psychiatric history and treatments, presence of sleep issues and increase

165

of toxic or anxiolytic use. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on quality of life was

166

assessed by using the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-form (SF-36) and Health

167

Results

185

Patients

186

A total of 34 consecutive patients seeking help for persistent symptoms attributed to COVID-

187

19 visited to our center between June and August 2020; 30 were included in the study.

188

Reasons for non-inclusion were refusal of physical consultation because of geographical

189

distance (n=3), spontaneous improvement of the condition (n=1). In total, 60% were women

190

(18/30) and the median age was 40 years (IQR 35-54). The cohort included 2 married

191

couples, and other patients were unrelated. Before the initial presentation, none of the patient

192

reported chronic pain nor the use of analgesics. Other characteristics are in Table 1.

193

194

Initial presentation

195

All patients declared a viral illness compatible with COVID-19. Initial symptoms occurred

196

between 1 February and 9 April 2020 and were mainly characterized by fever (60%), myalgia

197

(76.7%), cough (73.3%) and anosmia (43.3%) (Figure 1). Among 9 patients who underwent

198

nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR within 5 weeks after symptom onset, 55.6% (5/9) had

199

a positive result and all RT-PCR tests conducted after this time were negative (n = 11). Seven

200

patients consulted in the emergency department, and one was hospitalized in a conventional

201

hospital unit to receive oxygen for 7 days, without specific treatment. All other patients were

202

cared for at home. A total of 13 patients were prescribed treatments: 2 received

203

hydroxychloroquine 400 mg/day, 4 prednisone 1 mg/kg for 5-7 days, 8 antibiotics

204

(azithromycin, n = 6; amoxicillin, n = 2) and 2 low-dose aspirin. The other 17 patients

205

received only symptomatic treatment (acetaminophen).

207

Persistent clinical features

208

Patients were clinically evaluated after a median of 152 days (IQR 102-164) after the

209

reported initial symptom onset. Seventeen (56.7%) reported a resolution of initial symptoms

210

after a median of 21 days (IQR 15-33), followed by a resurgence after a median of 21 days

211

later (IQR 15-44). Conversely, the 13 other patients had no free-symptom intervals. Persistent

212

symptoms had a cyclical pattern in 28 (93.3%) patients and were mostly represented by

213

fatigue, myalgia and thoracic oppression (Figure 1A). Fever, shivering and cough were

214

significantly less frequent as compared with the initial presentation (p < 0.005 for all; Figure

215

1A). Fatigue was severe for most patients and rated at a median of 7 (IQR 5-8) on a 10-point

216

scale, with pain rated at 5 (IQR 2-6).

217

Overall, 60% and 43.4% of patients exhibited diffuse paresthesia and burning pain later after

218

the initial presentation (Figure 1A). The DN4 questionnaire screening neuropathic pain was

219

positive (≥4/10) for 50% (15/30) of patients and the FiRST questionnaire screening for

220

fibromyalgia-like symptoms was positive (≥ 5/6) for 56.6% (17/30; supplementary figure

221

1).

222

The clinical examination including neurological examination was unremarkable. At this time,

223

no patients received corticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or opioids.

224

Finally, 16 (53.3%) patients reported a trend toward a decrease of symptoms over time.

225

226

Virologic and specific immunologic evaluation

227

Specific analyses related to SARS-CoV-2 infection were conducted at a median of 174 days

228

(IQR 144-215) after symptom onset. At this time, in 18 (60%) and 6 (20%) of patients

229

underwent nasopharyngeal and stool RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2; all tests were negative.

230

Exploration of the cellular immune response by SARS-CoV-2 IFN-γ ELISPOT assay

231

revealed that 15 (50%) patients had a positive response to at least SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid

232

and spike proteins (considered ELISPOT-positive, Figure 2A). Among ELISPOT-positive

233

patients, 73.3% (11/15) also had a cellular response against non-structural SARS-CoV-2 as

234

compared with only 1 (6.7%) of ELISPOT-negative patients (p < 0.0001). Cellular response

235

to the spike protein of human coronavirus 229E and OC43 was similar in both SARS-CoV-2

236

ELISPOT groups (E+100% vs E– 86.7% and E+ 80% vs E– 73.3%).

237

Among patients with a negative IFN-γ ELISPOT result, all but one had negative serology

238

results (Figure 2A). This patient had an isolated anti-S IgG assay. Among the 15 patients

239

with a positive IFN-γ ELISPOT result, all had at least one positive serological assay. In

240

detail, 14 (93.3%) had a positive result for anti-RBD total antibodies, 11 (73.3%) anti-RBD

241

IgG/IgM, 12 (80%) anti-S IgG and 11 (73.3%) anti-N IgG (Figure 2A). We dichotomized the

242

patients into an immunized group (ELISPOT-positive and at least one positive serological

243

assay, n = 15) and a non-immunzed group (ELISPOT-negative, n = 15; Figure 2B), with

244

little difference in terms of symptoms (Figure 1B).

245

One ELISPOT-positive patient showed a decreasing signal for anti-N (equivocal to negative)

246

and anti-S signal (positive to equivocal) between day 133 and day 251. Additionally, one

247

patient with negative results for both IFN-γ ELISPOT and serology assays (conducted 140

248

days after symptom onset) previously had a positive nasopharyngeal RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2

249

result early after the first symptoms (Figure 2B). This patient also had 2 negative IgG

250

serology tests for SARS-CoV-2 at 37 and 85 days after symptom onset (Biosynex ICT and

251

CLIA Cobas Roche, respectively).

252

IFN-α2 levels were similar for patients with persistent symptoms (regardless of their

253

immunity status) and those with a history of documented COVID-19 free of residual

254

symptoms (sampled > 12 weeks after infection; Figure 3). Other cytokine levels were low or

255

non-detectable and were similar between patients with and without immunization for SARS-

256

CoV-2 (Supplementary figure 2).

257

258

Biological evaluation

259

Biological analyses (supplementary file 1) were conducted at the same time as the clinical

260

evaluation (152 days [IQR 102-164] after initial presentation). Routine biological test results

261

were within normal limits for all but one patient (an iron-deficiency anemia that was further

262

investigated and corrected). Values for markers of cardiac and muscle injury (troponin and

263

creatine phosphokinase) and coagulopathy (D-dimers, fibrinogen) were normal, and serology

264

for HIV, hepatitis C virus and Lyme disease was negative for all patients.

265

Screening for autoimmunity revealed low (1/160) and medium (1/320 to 1/640) titers of anti-

266

nuclear antibodies in 12 and 3 patients, respectively. Low to medium anti-nuclear antibody

267

titers were numerically more prevalent in SARS-CoV-2 immunized than non-immunized

268

patients (66.7% vs 33.3%, p = 0.067). Screening for anti-extractable nuclear antigens, anti-

269

double-stranded DNA, anti-citrullinated protein and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies as

270

well as rheumatoid factor was negative for all patients. Eight patients (4 in each

271

immunization group) showed isolated low titers (< 3 times normal range) of anti-cardiolipin

272

antibodies, with no history of thrombosis (IgM for 6, IgG for 2), and one patient was positive

273

for lupus anticoagulant. After 12 weeks, the repeat antiphospholipid antibodies testing was

274

negative for all patients.

275

276

Psychological evaluation

277

The phone interview by a clinical psychologist took place after a median of 224 days [202-

278

238] after initial symptom onset. In all, 10% (3/30) and 26.7% (8/30) of patients had a history

279

of depression and anxiety disorders, respectively. Sleep issues were reported by 23 (73.3%)

280

patients, and 4 (13.3%) had started an anxiolytic prescriptions (Table 2); 5 (16.7%) and 7

281

HADS screening for anxiety and depression was positive for 11 (36.7%) and 13 (43.3%) of

283

patients, respectively (Table 2). Using the PCL-5 questionnaire, 9 (30%) patients had scores

284

compatible with PTSD (Table 2). These values did not differ by immunization status (Figure

285

4). Several components of the SF-36 scale, physical limitations, energy and pain, were

286

severely affected, with no significant difference between patients immunized or not for

287

SARS-CoV-2 (supplementary figure 3). Family, friends and colleagues were a major source

288

of support for 20 (66.7%), 18 (60%) and 11/25 (44%) patients, respectively. Conversely, 7

289

(23.3%) patients felt significant support by physicians.

Discussion

292

In this study, we included 30 consecutive patients seeking medical help for persistent

293

symptoms (median 6 months) self-attributed to COVID-19. We identified two clinically

294

comparable groups of long-COVID: those with and those without objective SARS-CoV-2

295

immunity. In 93% of patients, persistent symptoms had a cyclical pattern and were mostly

296

represented by fatigue, thoracic oppression, myalgia, paresthesia and burning pain, which

297

agrees with the literature (20,21). Dichotomizing patients by presence or not of anti-SARS-

298

CoV-2 immunity resulted in only small differences in clinical presentation (Figure 1B).

299

Indeed, both groups had high pain/fatigue indexes and limitations in several components of

300

the SF-36 scale (Supplemental Figures 1 and 3).

301

Only half of the patient had objective cellular (IFN-γ ELISPOT-based) and humoral

302

immunity for SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 2B). There are three possible (and non-exclusive)

303

explanations for this result. First, some patients may have been infected with SARS-CoV-2,

304

without detectable immunity. As already described (22), one of our patients with RT-PCR–

305

proven SARS-CoV-2 infection had a negative SARS-CoV-2 serology result at several times

306

(36, 85 and 140 days after initial symptoms) as well as on IFN-γ ELISPOT (after 140 days).

307

Second, immunity may have developed in some patients but subsequently waned over time,

308

although such reports are discordant (23,24). In our cohort, one patient with PCR/ELISPOT-

309

confirmed infection showed IgG serology findings between days 133 and 251, both on anti-N

310

(from equivocal to negative) and anti-S (from positive to equivocal) ELISA. Additionally,

311

patients with cellular immunity might have negative serology, particularly anti-N IgG

312

(Figure 2A). Finally, some patients may have presented a non-specific viral illness and

313

subsequent symptoms, which were falsely attributed to SARS-CoV-2. In fact, the period of

314

the first pandemic wave was highly anxiogenic and may have exacerbated pre-existing

315

psychological conditions and induced a nocebo effect in some patients (25).

316

The high prevalence of probable anxiety and depression disorders (36.7% and 43.3%

317

respectively) are striking. A cohort study in the United Kingdom revealed that the incidence

318

of probable anxiety and depression disorder in the general population was 24% and 18.1%

319

during the pandemic (26). A history of reported COVID-19 was associated with increased

320

risk anxiety and depression. We also highlighted a high rate of probable PTSD (33.3%),

321

which is similar to the 30.8% prevalence in a US study (27). PTSD reflects the hardship of

322

the patient’s experience with COVID-19. The persistence of physical symptoms (related or

323

not to COVID-19) is likely associated with the psychological burden of the pandemic,

324

synergistically contributing to the emergence of “long-COVID”, and may explain the high

325

prevalence of psychological disorders in our cohort.

326

Long-COVID is an ill-defined condition characterized by symptoms persisting for at least 4

327

to 12 weeks after SARS-CoV-2 infection, depending on the study (10,13). Excluding

328

alternate diagnoses is crucial because objective evidence of previous COVID-19 may not be

329

mandatory for the diagnosis of long-COVID (13,20). Deep phenotyping of our patients did

330

not lead to alternative diagnoses in all patients. Long-COVID mainly represents patients with

331

non-severe initial presentations (12), and its pathophysiology is likely multifactorial. For non-

332

hospitalized long-COVID patients, physical deconditioning (28), psychological disorders

333

(29), viral encephalitis (7), dysautonomia (30), and immunological abnormalities are

334

plausible suspects and could co-exist. Indeed, auto-immunity has been demonstrated

335

following COVID-19 (31,32). However, viral-induced autoimmunity is likely transient, as

336

demonstrated by the negative repeat screening for antiphospholipid antibodies in 8 initially

337

positive patients, as well as the lack of significant increase in cytokine/IFN-α2 levels and

338

clinical/biological signs of autoimmune disease. Further studies will need to explore other

339

potential mechanisms at play in such patients (e.g., dysautonomia, neurological studies).

340

This study has limitations. First, we included 30 consecutive patients, which may not allow to

341

capture the complexity of long-COVID. However, this number allowed for a multimodal

342

evaluation without missing data, and the consecutive recruitment limited potential selection

343

bias. Given our study design, we cannot infer the prevalence of long-COVID, which has been

344

evaluated at 10% in the United Kingdom (10). Only 9 patients had a RT-PCR test in our

345

cohort in the 5 weeks after symptom onset, because RT-PCR tests were not available for mild

346

diseases during the first epidemic wave in France. Finally, we cannot exclude that our design

347

implied a selection bias of patients with psychological distress. However, our study allowed

348

for accurately evaluating the patients seeking medical advice for persistent symptoms self-

349

attributed to long-COVID and will therefore be of use for clinicians who may be under-

350

prepared to answer these patients’ questions. Although no treatment has been approved for

351

long-COVID, more than half of our patients reported a spontaneous and gradual

352

improvement of symptoms over time, which provides a window of hope for these patients.

353

To conclude, our study sheds light on the burden experienced by patients reporting long-term

354

symptoms self-attributed to COVID-19, as well as some of the mechanisms at play. A better

355

recognition and understanding of long-COVID will help healthcare providers care for these

356

patients.
