Abstract
Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) spreads rapidly around the
world.
Objective: To evaluate the association between comorbidities and the risk of death in
patients with COVID-19, and to further explore potential sex-specific differences.
Methods: We analyzed the data from 18,465 laboratory-confirmed cases that
completed an epidemiological investigation in Hubei Province as of February 27,
2020. Information on death was obtained from the Infectious Disease Information
System. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the association
between comorbidities and the risk of death in patients with COVID-19.
Results: The median age for COVID-19 patients was 50.5 years. 8828(47.81%)
patients were females. Severe cases accounted for 20.11% of the study population. As
of March 7, 2020, a total of 919 cases deceased from COVID-19 for a fatality rate of
4.98%. Hypertension (13.87%), diabetes (5.53%), and cardiovascular and
cerebrovascular diseases (CBVDs) (4.45%) were the most prevalent comorbidities,
and 27.37% of patients with COVID-19 reported having at least one comorbidity.
After adjustment for age, gender, address, and clinical severity, patients with
hypertension (HR 1.55, 95%CI 1.35-1.78), diabetes (HR 1.35, 95%CI 1.13-1.62),
CBVDs (HR 1.70, 95%CI 1.43-2.02), chronic kidney diseases (HR 2.09, 95%CI
1.47-2.98), and at least two comorbidities (HR 1.84, 95%CI 1.55-2.18) had significant
increased risks of death. And the association between diabetes and the risk of death
from COVID-19 was prominent in women (HR 1.69, 95%CI 1.27-2.25) than in men

(HR 1.16, 95%CI 0.91-1.46) (P for interaction = 0.036).
Conclusion: Among laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Hubei province,
China, patients with hypertension, diabetes, CBVDs, chronic kidney diseases were
significantly associated with increased risk of death. The association between diabetes
and the risk of death tended to be stronger in women than in men. Clinicians should
increase their awareness of the increased risk of death in COVID-19 patients with
comorbidities.

1 Introduction
The number of cases of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS- CoV-2), is rising at an
unprecedented rate, threatening people in various countries around the world. As of
May 14, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has affected over 4,258,666 people in at least 216
countries worldwide.

1

Thousands of people die of COVID-19 every day, and the

number of deaths has already surpassed 300,000 globally and is expected to increase
further as the disease spreads rapidly, posing a serious threat to human health.
Based on the data from WHO, the case fatality rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection
varies in different regions or countries (0~19.11%). Generally, those COVID-19 cases
with higher age, male sex, and more comorbidities were prone to have severe disease
and subsequent mortality.

2,3

Most of the available studies have shown that

hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases (CBVDs)
were the most prevalent comorbidities in COVID-19 patients.

2,4,5

In a recent study,

the presence of hypertension and diabetes was respectively associated with 1.58-fold
and 1.59-fold increased risk of death in patients with SARS-Cov-2 infection.4 Not
only that, a meta-analysis of retrospective studies confirmed that COVID-19 patients
with hypertension, diabetes, or CBVDs were associated with a significant increased
risk of aggravation.6 However, because of the relatively small sample sizes in
previous studies, larger sample sizes studies are needed. Moreover, sex-specific
mortality of SARS-Cov-2 has been well documented, but whether there are
sex-specific differences on the association of comorbidities with the risk of death in

COVID-19 patients is still unknown. 7
Therefore, this study was conducted to 1) address the association between
comorbidities and the risk of death; 2) explore the sex-specific differences on the
associations of comorbidities with the risk of death in patients with COVID-19 in
Hubei province (the epicenter of China).
2 Methods
2.1 Data sources and data extraction
The participants in this study were from all cases of epidemiological investigation
in Hubei Province as of February 27,2020 (N=72,802). The final date of follow-up
was March 7, 2020. The criteria of exclusion were as follows, 1) patients with missing
value of comorbidities (n=42,011); 2) patients with age lower than 20 years (n=1288);
3) patients were diagnosed as asymptomatic or suspected or clinical diagnosed cases
(n=11,038). Finally, a total of 18,465 laboratory-confirmed cases were included in the
present study for analysis.
2.2 variables
The general characteristics and clinical features were collected using a case
questionnaire at the time of diagnosis, and then imputed into the Infectious Disease
Information System by local epidemiologists and public healthcare workers. The case
questionnaire contains basic demographic or epidemic information (e.g., sex, birthdate,
present address, occupation, and exposure history) and clinical information (e.g.,
symptom onset, the date of symptom onset, blood cell count, comorbidities). We
computed the age of each case using the date of symptom onset and birthdate.

According to the present address, all the records were further classed as residents in
Wuhan and not. The clinical severity was categorized as mild, common, and severe or
critical. The diagnosis criteria of clinical severity can refer to the Chinese Clinical
Guidance for Covid-19 Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment.8 All the underlying
comorbidities were self-reported by patients, and were classified as hypertension,
diabetes, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases (CBVDs), lung diseases,
chronic kidney diseases, chronic liver diseases, and other comorbidities. Information
on death was obtained from the Infectious Disease Information System. All the
confirmed cases were diagnosed based on clinical signs or symptoms as well as
positive viral nucleic acid test results on throat swab samples.9 Waiver of informed
consent for collection of epidemiological data from patients with COVID-19 was
granted by the National Health Commission of China as part of the infectious disease
outbreak investigation. All identifiable personal information was removed for privacy
protection.
2.3 Statistical analysis
The continuous variables were presented as medians (interquartile ranges), and
the categorical variables were expressed as counts (percentages). The associations
between comorbidities and the risk of death were estimated using Cox proportional
hazards regression model ("survival" and "survminer" packages in R), with the
hazards ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) being reported. And
covariates included in the Cox model were based on prior publication, including age
(20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, or ≥60 years), gender (women or men), address (Wuhan

or not), and clinical severity (severe or not). Since men have a greater risk of death
than women, we therefore performed a subgroup analysis based on gender. A term of
comorbidities*gender was added into the regression model to explore the potential
interaction effect of gender on the association between comorbidities and the risk of
death.
All data were analyzed with R software, Version 3.5.3. A two-tailed P value <
0.05 was considered statistically significant, and a P value for interaction < 0.10 was
considered significant.
3 Results
3.1 Demographic and clinical characteristics
A total of 18,465 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases with age higher than 20
years were included in the present study for analysis, and the epidemiological and
clinical characters of the study population are shown in Table 1. Of these 18,465
cases, the median age was 50.53 years. 8828(47.81%) patients were females. Severe
cases accounted for 20.11% of the study population. The most common onset
symptoms were fever (79.52%), cough (56.42%), and fatigue (28.35%). Abnormal
chest CT manifestation was identified in 82.47% of patients. As of March 7, 2020, a
total of 919 cases deceased from COVID-19 for a fatality rate of 4.98% (Table 1).
There were 3562(19.29%) and 1281(6.94%) for patients with 1 comorbidity and 2
or more comorbidities, respectively. As compared with patients without comorbidities,
patients with 1 comorbidity or at least 2 comorbidities had significant higher rate of
digestive symptoms (11.82% or 13.74% vs 9.22%), higher proportion of severe cases

(27.26% or 40.67% vs 16.31%), and higher mortality rate (8.39% or 17.88% vs 2.87%)
(Table 1). And the similar results were also observed in both men and women (Table
S1).
3.2 The prevalence of comorbidities stratified by gender
The results of the prevalence of comorbidities in different gender are shown in
table 2. A total of 2561(13.87%), 1022(5.53%), 822(4.45%), 463(2.51%), 149(0.81%),
and 124(0.67%) patients reported having hypertension, diabetes, CBVDs, lung
diseases, chronic kidney diseases, and chronic liver diseases, respectively. As
compared with women, men were more likely to have at least one comorbidity (27.37%
vs 24.98%). Significant higher prevalence of hypertension (14.73% vs 12.92%), lung
diseases (2.92% vs 2.06%), chronic kidney diseases (0.94% vs 0.66%), and chronic
liver diseases (0.84% vs 0.49%) were observed in men than in women. The
prevalence of diabetes (5.81% vs 5.23%) and CBVDs (4.66% vs 4.23%) were similar
in men and women (Table 2). Furthermore, we have further identified the
epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with different comorbidities in
men and women (Table S2 and S3). Of the men, patients with hypertension or
diabetes or CBVDs were more likely to be older, have decreased lymphocyte or
increased neutrophil counts, and have higher mortality rate. The rate of digestive
symptoms in patients with hypertension was similar to that in patients without
hypertension, but patients with diabetes or CBVDs had significant higher rate of
digestive symptoms compared with those without diabetes or CBVDs (Table S3). Of
the women, patients with comorbidities were more likely to be older, have decreased

lymphocyte or increased neutrophil counts, have higher rate of digestive symptoms,
and higher mortality rate (Table S2).
We also identified the proportion of comorbidities in women and men stratified
by death status (Table S4). A total of 327 and 592 cases deceased from COVID-19 in
women and men, respectively. Of these deceased patients, the most prevalent
comorbidities were hypertension, CBVDs, and diabetes in both women and men, and
the corresponding proportions of the three comorbidities were 35.47%, 18.35%, and
18.04% in women; 36.99%, 17.4%, and 13.85% in men.
3.3 The associations between comorbidities and death
Patients with comorbidities had significantly escalated risks of death compared
with those without (Figure S1). In the crude model, patients with hypertension (HR
3.74, 95%CI 3.27-4.28), diabetes (HR 3.25, 95%CI 2.71-3.89), CBVDs (HR 5.08,
95%CI 4.29-6.02), lung diseases (HR 2.5, 95%CI 1.89-3.3), chronic kidney diseases
(HR 5.05, 95%CI 3.55-7.18), and at least two comorbidities (HR 6.78, 95%CI
5.76-7.98) had significantly escalated risks of death than those without. After
adjusting for age, the association between comorbidities and the risks of death were
significantly decreased but was still significant. After further adjusting for gender
(men or women), address (Wuhan city or not), and clinical severity (severe or not),
patients with hypertension (HR 1.55, 95%CI 1.35-1.78), diabetes (HR 1.35, 95%CI
1.13-1.62), CBVDs (HR 1.70, 95%CI 1.43-2.02), chronic kidney diseases (HR 2.09,
95%CI 1.47-2.98), and at least two comorbidities (HR 1.84, 95%CI 1.55-2.18) had
significant increased risks of death (Table 3).

In subgroup analysis (Table 4), the association of hypertension, CBVDs, lung
diseases, and chronic kidney diseases with the risk of death was similar in both men
and women, but the association between diabetes and the risk of death from
COVID-19 was prominent in women (HR 1.69, 95%CI 1.27-2.25) than in men (HR
1.16, 95%CI 0.91-1.46). And the interaction effect of gender on the association of
diabetes with the risk of death was significant (P for interaction = 0.036).
4 Discussion
In the present study, we found that hypertension, diabetes, and CBVDs were the
most prevalent comorbidities, and 27.37% of patients with COVID-19 reported
having at least one comorbidity. After adjustment for age, gender, address, and
clinical severity, COVID-19 patients with hypertension, diabetes, CBVDs, chronic
kidney diseases were significantly associated with increased risk of death. And a
significant sex-specific difference on the association between diabetes and the risk of
death was observed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest sample among
the reports so far on the association between comorbidities and the risk of death.
Our observations were in line with previous findings in terms of the commonness
of comorbidities in patients with COVID-19.4,5,10-12 Few studies, however, have
explored the association between comorbidities and mortality of SARS-Cov-2
infections. A recent cohort study indicated that hypertension or diabetes were
significantly associated with higher risks of the development of acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS), but there was no significant correlation between
hypertension or diabetes and the risk of progression from ARDS to death.3 Guan et al

showed that the presence of hypertension and diabetes was respectively associated
with 1.58-fold and 1.59-fold increased risk of death in patients with SARS-Cov-2
infection.4 Cheng et al showed that kidney disease on admission was associated with
an increased risk of in-hospital death.13 Zhou et al illustrated that coronary heart
disease, diabetes, and hypertension were critical risk factors associated with
in-hospital death.2 Nonetheless, a major limitation of these researches has been small
sample size. Additionally, sex-specific mortality of SARS-Cov-2 infection has been
well elucidated, but no studies have pointed out the sex-specific differences on the
correlation of comorbidities with mortality. The present study has therefore added
further evidence that comorbidities were associated with a greater mortality in patients
with COVID-19 based on the large sample size.
The etiology behind the increased risk of death in COVID-19 patients with
comorbidities is likely to be multifactorial. Evidence has pointed out that
SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a cell entry receptor.
14,15

Recent findings have demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 cell receptor gene

ACE2 was expressed in a wide variety of human tissues, such as small intestine,
kidneys, heart, lungs, and adipose tissue.16 Therefore, the coronavirus may enter
various human cells via ACE2-dependent pathway and cause functional deterioration,
leading to the exacerbation of the original comorbidities and subsequently increasing
the risk of death. Additionally, cells infected by SARS-CoV-2 produce elevated levels
of pro-inflammatory cytokines which may cause immuno-mediated damage to the
lungs and other organs, resulting in multi-organ dysfunction.11,17,18 Findings from

experimental study have illustrated that diabetic mice had a prolonged phase of severe
disease and delayed recovery after infection with MERS-CoV.19 Therefore, immune
dysregulation and prolonged inflammation might be the critical drivers of greater
mortality in COVID-19 patients with comorbidities. However, further studies are
required to solve this mystery.
Generally, male sex or diabetes comorbidity were related to a greater risk of death
of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Anomalously, a significant stronger association between
diabetes and the risk of death in COVID-19 patients was observed in females than in
males. Estrogen or estrogen receptor might be the key drivers of the sex-specific
difference. Population-based studies have shown that lower premenopausal estrogen
levels were associated with higher risk of developing diabetes.20 The estrogen has
been reported to modulate the differentiation, maturation, lifespan, and effector
functions of innate immune cells.21 Consequently, the decreased levels of estrogen in
females with diabetes might be associated with decreases in immune function or
increases in inflammatory mediators, resulting in poor clinical outcomes. A cohort
study of people with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes provided indirectly evidence
that female sex confers specific vulnerability to the effects of inflammation on
adverse health condition.22 Additionally, cellular and animal studies have established
that G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor is involved in the regulation of inflammation
as well as glucose homostasis. Therefore, we speculated that the levels of estrogen or
estrogen receptor might play critical roles in the progression of COVID-19 in patients
with diabetes. Clearly, experimental studies are needed to elucidated the underlying

reasons.
Even though this study included a large number of patients with COVID-19,
several limitations should be noted. First, the disease severity and duration of
comorbidities, as well as some clinical laboratory indicators (e.g., inflammatory
markers) was unavailable in the present study. Second, self-reported diagnosis of
comorbidities might result in underestimation of the prevalence of comorbidities, and
the existence of recall bias might inevitably affect our assessment. Last, the duration
of follow-up was relatively short, and studies with sufficiently long time frame are
warranted in future.
5 Conclusion
Among laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Hubei province, China,
patients with hypertension, diabetes, CBVDs, chronic kidney diseases were
significantly associated with increased risk of death. The association between diabetes
and the risk of death tended to be stronger in women than in men. Clinicians should
increase their awareness of the increased risk of death in COVID-19 patients with
comorbidities.
