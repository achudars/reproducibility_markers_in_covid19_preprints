Key Points

27

Question: What is the intention to receive COVID-19 vaccination in Macao and the influencing

28

factors?

29
30

Findings: A cross-sectional study involving 552 respondents found that the intention rate of COVID-

31

19 vaccination was 62.3% in Macao. Positive predictors of intention included being able to make

32

arrangement to receive the vaccine, a sense of social responsibility, and an offer of time off from

33

work after vaccination. Concerns over vaccine safety and relying on online resources for vaccine

34

information were negative predictors.

35
36

Meaning: Intention to receive COVID-19 vaccination is multifactorial requiring multi-component

37

strategies to promote vaccine uptake.

Abstract

41

Importance: Understanding the intention of receiving COVID-19 vaccines is important for

42

informing effective vaccination strategies especially for areas with low incidence.

43
44

Objective: This study aimed to investigate the intention to receive COVID-19 vaccination, identify

45

the key influencing factors, and determine the most important intention predictors using a

46

theoretically principled model.

47
48

Design, setting, and participants: This was a cross-sectional online survey study hosted by Survey

49

Monkey and implemented for 10 days from May 14 2021. People who aged 18 years or above and

50

had been residing in Macao for 12 months prior to the study were recruited through social media.

51
52

Main outcomes and measures: Intention, the constructs of protection motivation theory (perceived

53

severity, perceived susceptibility, maladaptive response reward, self-efficacy, response-efficacy, and

54

response cost), constructs of health belief model (cues to action), social attitude, social norm, past

55

experience and information seeking behavior, in addition to demographic variables.

56
57

Results: Of the 552 respondents, 79.5% aged between 25 and 54 years old, 59.4% were female, and

58

88% had a bachelor degree or above. Overall, 62.3% of the respondents indicated their intention

59

while 19.2% were hesitant and 18.5% did not have any intention. While 67.0% believed COVID-19

60

infection was life-threatening, only 19.0% thought they were at risk. Control variables such as age,

61

gender, education level, and having travel plans were significantly correlated with intention.

62

Significant associations were found between intention and all the measures (p<0.05). The most

63

important positive predictors of intention were “being able to make arrangement to receive the

64

vaccine” (β = 0.333, P <0.001), “a sense of social responsibility” (β = 0.326, P < 0.001), and “time

65

off from work after vaccination” (β = 0.169, P <0.001), whereas “concerns over vaccine safety” (β = -

66

0.124, P < 0.001) and “relying on online resources for vaccine information” (β = -0.065, P <0.05)

67

were negative predictors. Perceived severity was not a predictor of intention.

68
69

Conclusion and relevance: Multi-component strategies that address various factors affecting

70

intention are needed to formulate effective interventions. Health literacy, vaccination convenience,

71

social responsibility, reasonable incentives and well-informed risk and benefit analysis are

72

recommended consideration for future vaccination campaigns.

Introduction

74

The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on human health, economy and societal activities is

75

unprecedented. Health systems continue to endure massive challenges in preventing and managing

76

the infection with COVID-19 and its variants, and be stretched to deliver effective public health

77

measures.1

78

One of the critical public health interventions to mitigate COVID-19 pandemic at the population

79

level is for individuals to get vaccinated with COVID-19 vaccines. Since the release of the genetic

80

sequence of SARS-CoV-2 in January 2020, the R&D activity to develop a vaccine against the disease

81

has been intense across the globe.2 As of June 1 2021, at least 102 vaccines were in clinical

82

development.3 Evidence about the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in preventing

83

symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 infections, related hospitalizations, severe disease, death,

84

and protection against variant strains is acumulating.4-6 Drug regulatory authorities and the World

85

Health Organization have successively listed a number of new COVID-19 vaccine candidates for

86

emergency use, and many governments rushed to distribute the vaccines to their people. 7-10

87
88

The speedy development, approval and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, however, do not

89

necessarily translate into full-range vaccine uptake. As of June 3 2021, only 41.2% of the total

90

population in the US were fully vaccinated11; in China, 723.5 million doses were administered on the

91

same day12 but to vaccinate 40% of population by end-July was a speculation13. Vaccination rates

92

also varied largely among other developed countries (40.1% in the UK, 20.1% in Germany, 17.6% in

93

France, 6.4% in Canada, 3.14% in Japan).14 Besides availability, accessibility and affordability,

94

vaccine hesitancy affecting an individual’s decision-making process about getting vaccinated is a

95

critical challenge to national vaccination programs.15,16 Vaccine hesitancy refers to “delay in

96

acceptance or refusal of vaccination despite availability of vaccination services”, and a high rate of

97

hesitancy or a low rate of intention would undermine the level of demand for a vaccine.15

98

Considering the far-reaching goal of 60-75% vaccination rate to achieve herd immunity17,18, it is

99

paramount to have a good understanding of the vaccination intention in order to encourage vaccine

100

uptake.

101
102

The decision about taking a COVID-19 vaccine is multifactorial and context-specific varying across

103

people, time, place and vaccines. 15 There is an ongoing need to investigate the factors contributing to

104

vaccine hesitancy or affecting the intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19. This is particularly

105

important for areas whereby intention may be hampered by low incidence of COVID-19 cases.

106

Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19

107

and the associations between such intentions and theoretically principled and sociodemographic

108

factors in Macao.

109
110

Methods

111

An online, cross-sectional survey method was applied in this study. The project has been approved

112

by the Panel on Research Ethics of the University of Macau in May 2021 (SSHRE21-APP018-

113

ICMS). As indicated in the Participant Information Statement, it was assumed that, by completing

114

and submitting the survey online, participants agreed to take part in the research study. This study

115

followed the American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) reporting guideline.

116
117

Macau is a city with a population of around 690,000 over 32.9km2 ranked one of the most densely

118

populated places in the world. As of June 6 2021, there were only 51 imported cases in the city all of

119

whom fully recovered, and no signs of community transmissions.19 The percentage of population

120

fully vaccinated was around 10%. The target population in this study was people aged 18 years or

121

above who had resided in Macao in the past 12 months. A minimum sample size of 384 respondents

122

would provide a target 5% margin of error for population percentage estimates with a level of 95%

123

confidence.

124
125

The online questionnaire, hosted by Survey Monkey, was open on from May 14 2021 and closed on

126

May 23 2021 when no new responses were received for 24 hours. Invitations to participate in the

127

study were distributed through social media like Facebook and WeChat, and news media social

128

platform. Given the popularity of the social media among the Macao population and the need to

129

maintain social distancing, social media and online communication platform was chosen. Simplified-

130

snowball sampling technique was also used to recruit more people from respondents’ contact. The

131

survey took less than 8 min to complete on average.

132
133

Measures

134

The design of the questionnaire was informed by (1) the current literature on intention of COVID-19

135

vaccination20-22, (2) the health belief model23 and the protection motivation theory24, and (3) a

136

clinician involved in the local COVID-19 vaccination campaign. The schematic diagram of the

theoretically principled constructs applied to the intention to receive COVID-19 vaccination in this

138

study is provided in Figure 1.

139
140

(Figure 1. Schematic diagram of theoretically-principled constructs applied to the intention to receive

141

COVID-19 vaccination)

142

The questionnaire mainly comprised of 2 sections: Section A collect respondents’ demographic

143

information and Section B asked respondents to rate their level of agreement using a 5-point Likert

144

scale (1=strongly disagree, 2=disagree, 3=not sure, 4=agree, and 5=strongly agree) their intention

145

and 28 items representing 11 constructs: perceived severity, perceived susceptibility, maladaptive

146

response rewards, self-efficacy, response-efficacy, response costs, social attitude, social norms, past

147

experiences, information seeking behavior, and cues for action. At the conclusion of the study,

148

participants were invited to provide additional feedback via a free-text response box.

149
150

The questionnaire was pilot-tested twice (2 doctors, 2 pharmacists and 2 researchers in Round 1, and

151

10 individuals in Round 2) following the concepts described by Leavy25 to assess content validity,

152

content consistency, and comprehension, defective questions and the time needed to complete.

153
154

Statistical analysis

155

The data was analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 24 software

156

for Windows. In addition to descriptive statistics (frequencies, means, and standard deviations),

157

Pearson chi-square test was used to compare the differences in COVID-19 vaccination intentions

158

among subgroups, Spearman’s rho was used to test the correlation of intention with the variables, and

159

multiple linear regression analysis to identity predictors of intention. Whenever the P-value is found

160

to be smaller than 0.05, the association would be considered statistically significant at a confidence

161

level of 95%.

163

Results

164

Respondents’ characteristics and the differences in the intention among subgroups

165

A total of 552 valid responses were received. As shown in Table 1, 79.5% aged between 25 and 54

166

years old, 59.4% were female, 74.8% were local residents, 88% had a bachelor degree or above and

167

64.5% planned to travel in and out of Macao within the next 6 months. In general, the respondents

168

were broadly representative of the population in Macao in terms of age and types of residency, but

169

the proportion of female and people having higher levels of education were higher than intended.

170
171

Intention to receive COVID-19 vaccination

172

Overall, 62.3% of the respondents indicated their intention to receive COVID-19 vaccination, while

173

19.2% were hesitant and 18.5% did not want to get vaccinated at all. The intention rate within each of

174

the subgroup is shown in Figure 2. According to the Pearson Chi-square test results (Table 1),

175

statistically significant differences in the intention were observed among the subgroups of age,

176

gender, residency types, education level, parental status and having plans to travel in and out of

177

Macao.

181

Respondents’ perception about the measurements

182

Descriptive statistics for items assessing factors related to intention are reported in Table 2. The

183

results of Spearman's rho suggested that almost all of the items were significantly associated with

184

respondents’ level of intention to receive COVID-19 vaccination.

185
186

While respondents rated severity highly (mean=3.82+1.47), the perceived susceptibility was much

187

lower (mean=2.49+1.24). Regarding maladaptive responses, respondents rated the money they had

188

to spend on COVID-19 vaccination the least concern (mean=1.72+1.10). The rating for self-efficacy

189

was high especially about their ability to register for COVID-19 vaccination (mean=4.41+1.02) and

190

make appropriate arrangements (mean=4.14+1.22). Their ratings on the response-efficacy was

191

relatively low regarding the effect of reducing symptoms (mean=3.68+1.22). More than one-third of

192

the respondents believed that it would be likely for them to experience unbearable side effects after

193

COVID-19 vaccination. In terms of social attitudes, the respondents recognized the effectiveness of

194

COVID-19 vaccination on the community (mean=4.09+1.06) more than that on their family

195

(mean=3.88+1.14). The respondents thought highly of getting COVID-19 vaccination as a social

196

responsibility (mean=3.99+1.17). In terms of the source of information about COVID-19, they relied

197

mostly on the government (mean=3.68+1.27) and least on family and friends (mean=2.73+1.27).

198

Regarding cues for action, the respondents rated loosening of travel restrictions as a result of

199

COVID-19 vaccination the highest (mean=3.91+1.30) and financial incentive the lowest

200

(mean=3.07+1.52).

201
202

Results of multiple linear regressions

203

All factors found to be significantly associated with intention in Table 1 and 2 were analyzed as the

204

independent variables, and the intention as the dependent variable. As shown in Table 3, the model

205

is able to explain 57.9 % of the variance in intention to receive COVID-19 vaccination. In addition to

206

age, 8 items from 7 constructs were shown to be predictors of intention, including 5 positive

207

predictors and 3 negative predictors.

208
209

Positive predictors were: (1) “I am able to make arrangement to get COVID-19 vaccination” in self-

210

efficacy (β = 0.333, P <0.001); (2) “I consider getting COVID-19 vaccination a social responsibility”

211

in social norm (β = 0.326, P < 0.001); (3) “I might have a stronger intention to take COVID-19

212

vaccination if there is a rewarding system such as time off from work” in cues to action (β = 0.169, P

213

<0.001); (4) “Most people I know would expect me to get COVID-19 vaccination” (β = 0.114, P =

214

0.000) in social norm; and (5) “The risk for me to catch COVID-19 is high” in perceived

215

susceptibility (β = 0.076, P <0.05).

216
217

Negative predictors were: (1) “It is likely that I will have serious side-effects that I cannot bear from

218

COVID-19 vaccination” in response cost (β = -0.124, P < 0.001); (2) “If I do not get a COVID-19

219

vaccination, I will not have to worry about the safety of the vaccine” in maladaptive response reward

220

(β = -0.082, P <0.05); and (3) “I rely on online sources (such as internet, social media) for accurate

221

information about COVID-19 vaccination” in information seeking behavior (β = -0.065, P <0.05).

222
223

Discussion

224

This is one of the few studies that investigated the intention rate of COVID-19 vaccination in areas

225

with low incidence rate. The intention rate in Macao was 62.3%, and age, gender, type of residency,

226

education, parental status, and having travel plans exhibited significant correlation with intention.

227

Importantly, it was also found that the ability to make arrangement to receive the vaccine, a sense of

228

social responsibility, an offer of time-off from work after vaccination, peer influence, and perceived

229

susceptibility were predictors of increased intention, while concerns about vaccine safety and seeking

230

vaccine information from online sources were predictors of decreased intention. Together with age,

231

these predictors could explain 57.9% of the variance in vaccination intention.

232
233

The intention rate of COVID-19 vaccination in Macao (62.3%) was higher than that reported in Hong

234

Kong (4.2% to 44.2%)26,27, but lower than that reported in China (88.6%-91.9%)28,29 and other

235

countries (such as 94.3% in Malaysia30, 75.8% in Australia31 and 67.9% in Singapore32). These

236

intention rates indicated that hesitancy and refusal about COVID-19 vaccines is a common challenge

237

impeding the vaccine uptake across the populations.33 This is especially concerning for Macao

238

considering that the low vaccination rate (around 10%) and the slow uptake since vaccination was

239

launched in February 2021, exposing the vulnerability of the city against the spread of the virus..

240
241

1.

Improve health literacy to counteract the negative effect of low education background

242

Consistent with previous findings34,35, respondents with lower education level indicated lower

243

vaccination intention. On this note, the association between lower education level and poorer health

244

was repeatedly reported36 and the mechanism behind the association could be explained by the

245

concept of health literary, presenting an opportunity for intervention.37 Future vaccine

246

communication strategies should consider the level of health literacy in subpopulations when

247

considering the content and means of the promotion activities.32 Decreasing the complexity in

248

communication and information processing, using infographic along with detailed information,

249

streamlining the COVID-19 vaccination process, and involving healthcare professionals in improving

250

public health literacy may help to mitigate the impact associated with low education level.38,39

251
252

2.

Mitigate the false sense of “safety zone”

253

The correlation between not having travel plans and low vaccination intention was less reported in

254

previous studies. Due to effective border control and low incidence rate in Macao, non-travelers

255

generally felt “remote” from COVID-19 pandemic and thus perceived a low level of susceptibility

256

despite high perceived severity affecting their intention to receive vaccination. This is worrying

257

because for a completely naive population, a pathogen can easily spread among susceptible hosts in a

258

rampant manner when there is sufficient exposure of susceptible hosts to infected individuals.40

259

Moreover, it would up to 2 weeks after administration of the second shot to reach the expected

260

efficacy. Educating the public that the risks of infection would increase with the pace back to

261

“normality” and the time lag between vaccine administration and optimal protection is crucial to help

262

them decide about taking preventative actions in a timely manner.

263
264

3.

Promote the social responsibility in COVID-19 vaccination and make positive action visible

265

Our model showed that the sense of social responsibility and peer influence could largely explain the

266

variance in intention. According to the 2012 Global Vaccine Action Plan approved by the WHO,

267

“individuals and communities understand the value of vaccines and demand immunization as both

268

their right and responsibility”.41 The recognition of individual’s social responsibility should be

269

strongly promoted within the community to leverage the power of social norm.42 Empowering

270

vaccine recipients to share their personal stories and reasons for vaccination, and making positive

271

decisions visible by, for instance, providing vaccination badges or ribbons have been

272

recommended.42,43 Promoting and displaying the development momentum of social norms has been

273

shown to be a powerful tool to shift public mentality towards health behavior change.42,43

274
275

4.

Empower the public by optimizing their self-efficacy

276

The respondent’s ability to make arrangement to receive COVID-19 vaccine being a strong predictor

277

reaffirmed previous findings about self-efficacy.44,45 To better leverage self-efficacy, the convenience

278

of getting the vaccine could be enhanced. At present, mass vaccination sites have been employed to

279

allow high throughput, and tailored vaccine-administration software systems enabled user-

280

friendliness in making prior booking and onsite enrolment.46 Group-based, out-reach vaccination

281

sites (e.g. corporate and universities) to reach people in their communities were also initiated. To

282

bring vaccination services to the neighborhood, mobile vaccination trucks may be employed in future

283

campaigns.47 Importantly, the “customer journey” should also be reviewed and streamlined

284

consistently to promote vaccine recipient’s pleasant experiences. Increasing vaccination capacity to

285

cater for increased vaccine demand, onsite registration and appointment rescheduling, as well as

286

reminding system for the second dose and follow-up for no-shows should also be considered.48

287
288

5.

Prioritize vaccination incentives (vaccination certificates and time off work, and money?)

289

Most people agreed that they would be more willing to receive COVID-19 vaccination should there

290

be incentives, and preferred easing travel restrictions with vaccination and time off work over

291

monetary incentives. Incentivizing individuals with vaccination certificates is crucial for social good,

292

and the implications for the “recovery” of economic and socially activities are profound. Regarding

293

time-off from work after vaccination, people might experience such side effects as fever, tiredness

294

and muscle pain which might last for about 1-2 days.49 As such, as the US-CDC recommended, it is

295

important for employers to take strategies that appropriately help their employees to manage side

296

effects after vaccination. In contrast, the evidence about monetary incentives in changing health

297

behavior is mixed.50,51 Moreover, it is difficult to determine the amount of money sufficient enough

Educate the public about scientific-based risk and benefit analysis about COVID-19 vaccines

302

Concerns about vaccine safety and seeking COVID-19 vaccine information from internet were found

303

to be negative predictors of COVID-19 vaccination as reported previously.53,54 Misinformation

304

regarding the vaccine safety and lack of advanced vaccination knowledge can easily contribute to

305

anxiety, leading to overestimating possible side effects.55,56 On this note, there is a need for

transparency and to answer concerns about the speedy development and safety of CIVD-19

LIMITATIONS

317

This study had a number of limitations. Firstly, using an online platform to invite participants and

318

operating the survey online might have induced sampling. People with lower information technology

319

literacy might also be under-represented in this study. By the nature of cross-sectional study, no

320

causal inferences could be made between the key factors and the intention. There is also the

321

timeliness to the study findings as people’s intention to receive COVID-19 vaccination is bound to

322

fluctuate with the spread of the virus, new evidence about vaccine safety and efficacy, emergence of

323

new variants, etc. Lastly, the vaccination intention may be affected by factors not explored in this

324

study. Follow-up studies to identify influencing factors more comprehensively, and stratified studies

325

to determine the differences in the impact of such factors on various subgroups would be necessary

326

for precision vaccination strategy design.

CONCLUSION

329

This study reaffirmed that low intention to receive COVID-19 vaccination is a common challenge in

330

the combat of the pandemic. Multi-component strategies that address various factors affecting
