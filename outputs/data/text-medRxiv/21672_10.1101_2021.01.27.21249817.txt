Abstract
OBJECTIVE: Neurological complications can worsen outcomes in COVID-19. We defined the
prevalence of a wide range of neurological conditions among patients hospitalized with
COVID-19 in geographically diverse multinational populations.
METHODS: Using electronic health record (EHR) data from 348 participating hospitals across
6 countries and 3 continents between January and September 2020, we performed a crosssectional study of hospitalized adult and pediatric patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction test, both with and without severe COVID-19. We
assessed the frequency of each disease category and 3-character International Classification
of Disease (ICD) code of neurological diseases by countries, sites, time before and after
admission for COVID-19, and COVID-19 severity.
RESULTS: Among the 35,177 hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, there was
increased prevalence of disorders of consciousness (5.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI]:
3.7%-7.8%, pFDR<.001) and unspecified disorders of the brain (8.1%, 95%CI: 5.7%-10.5%,
pFDR<.001), compared to pre-admission prevalence. During hospitalization, patients who
experienced severe COVID-19 status had 22% (95%CI: 19%-25%) increase in the relative risk
(RR) of disorders of consciousness, 24% (95%CI: 13%-35%) increase in other
cerebrovascular diseases, 34% (95%CI: 20%-50%) increase in nontraumatic intracranial
hemorrhage, 37% (95%CI: 17%-60%) increase in encephalitis and/or myelitis, and 72%
(95%CI: 67%-77%) increase in myopathy compared to those who never experienced severe
disease.
INTERPRETATION: Using an international network and common EHR data elements, we
highlight an increase in the prevalence of central and peripheral neurological phenotypes in

Introduction
The World Health Organization declared coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to the
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection as a global
pandemic on March 11, 2020.1 Increasing evidence points to the multi-organ involvement of
COVID-19, including the nervous system, which increases morbidity and mortality.
Understanding the neurological manifestations is essential for developing strategies to mitigate
disability and death from the neurological consequences of COVID-19.

Many case reports and reviews have highlighted neurological phenotypes in adults with
COVID-19, including cerebrovascular disease2, meningoencephalitis and encephalomyelitis3,4,
encephalopathy5, headache6, cranial neuropathies7, Guillain-Barré syndrome8,9, plexopathy10,
anosmia and ageusia11,12, and cognitive dysfunction13. Children with COVID-19 have similar
presentations, including ischemic stroke, encephalopathy, headache, and muscle
weakness14,15. Thus, neurological complications in the setting of COVID-19 affect both the
central and the peripheral nervous system. Prior studies reported the prevalence of COVID-19associated neurological conditions at country level, including China16, the United Kingdom17,
and Italy18, but few studies have used validated common data elements to examine the
prevalence of neurologic conditions across countries. While studies have described the
spectrum of neurological conditions associated with severe COVID-1919–21, no multinational
study has compared the prevalence of neurological complications in patients with severe
versus non-severe disease, based on respiratory and/or critical illness status. Given the health
consequences of neurological complications, recognizing the associated neurological
complications could inform prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.

Clinical data in electronic health records (EHRs) enable studies across institutions to estimate
the prevalence of neurological conditions in patients with COVID-19. There are several
challenges when using international and multi-institutional EHR data for clinical discovery: (1)
adopting common data elements and standardization processes for representing and
aggregating clinical events, (2) sharing clinical data across institutions while adhering to multinational patient privacy laws such as the United States Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the European Union General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR), and (3) rapidly developing and deploying analytical solutions at scale by leveraging
existing informatics infrastructures and frameworks. Our team created the International
Consortium for Clinical Characterization of COVID-19 by EHR (4CE; www.covidclinical.net),
standardizing and aggregating EHR data from nearly 350 hospitals across six countries to
identify and address critical clinical and epidemiological questions relevant to COVID-19.22,23
Leveraging the highly scalable, multinational networks of the 4CE consortium, we estimated
the prevalence of neurological conditions in hospitalized patients with reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by site and country, and
compared the differences in the prevalence of neurological conditions between patients with
and those without severe disease based on the internationally validated 4CE criteria.24

Methods
Patients and Data
4CE contributing sites began in March 2020 to collect EHR data from hospitalized patients with
positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests. The analyzed data spanned from January 2020 through
early September 2020. We defined COVID-19-related hospitalization as the first hospital
admission that occurred between 7 days before and up to 14 days after the first positive
SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. The first admission date within this -7 to +14 day window is the index
admission date.

According to the 4CE consortium agreement, we de-identified contributing sites to protect site
confidentiality. The institutional review board of each participating site approved the sharing of
anonymous, aggregate data in compliance with multi-national patient privacy laws exempting
the requirement for individual patient consent. A small level of obfuscation to preserve sitespecific privacy and to reduce the risk of patient re-identification may slightly but not
significantly affect the total patient counts.

Using the standardized 4CE common data model22,23, we collected demographics (age, sex,
self-identified race/ethnicity) and the International Classification of Disease (ICD) codes
(versions 9 or 10) pertaining to neurological conditions (Fig. 1) as well as COVID-19 severity,
defined according to the 4CE definition.24 Of the 45 contributing sites, five sites (all from Italy)
provided only ICD-9 codes while the remaining 40 sites provided predominantly ICD-10 codes.
As such, we used ICD-10 data for the main analyses and ICD-9 data for supplementary

analyses. We used the first three alphanumeric characters of a given ICD code, which
designates the category of the disease or injury (e.g., ICD-10 G44 denotes the category of
“Other headache syndromes”).

For all patients hospitalized with COVID-19, we collected ICD codes at two time periods,
before and after the admission date. The period before COVID-19 hospitalization ranged from 365 days to -15 days preceding the admission date. Inclusion of EHR data up to one year
before admission is a pragmatic decision to balance available data from all sites and minimize
past medical conditions that might not be relevant. The period after admission date ranged
from the date of admission to the end of the hospitalization. According to the pre-planned
consortium-wide strategy, we excluded all codes in the two weeks preceding the hospital
admission date to ensure that diagnoses before admission were independent of COVID-19. It
could take a few days from SARS-CoV-2 infection to symptom onset and additional days
before a positive PCR test and/or hospital admission. Similarly, we analyzed ICD codes before
and after the admission date according to whether patients ever met the 4CE criteria for
severe COVID-1924 (Fig. 1).

Exposures
We first examined all hospitalized patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests. We then
examined hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who met any of the definitions for severe
COVID-1924, including advanced respiratory care management at any point during their

hospitalization. Definitions of severe COVID-19 included diagnoses, procedures, laboratory
results, or medications (Table 1).

Neurological Outcomes
We queried 21 ICD-10 codes in 12 categories pertaining to neurological phenotypes following
a literature search in August 2020. The neurological disease categories included
consciousness, coordination, dizziness, headache, inflammatory, muscle, neuropathy,
psychiatric, seizure, vascular, vision and other unspecified neurological conditions (Table 2).

Statistical Analyses
We first compared the prevalence of each neurological ICD code and disease category among
all hospitalized patients with COVID-19. For each ICD code, we reported the total count and
the proportion of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 at each site (and each country), both
before and after admission date (Supplementary Material, eEq. 1). We used the proportion
data before admission as reference control. We calculated the difference in the proportion of
cases with a given ICD code before and after admission date (eEq. 2) and used paired twosided t-tests to examine whether there was a statistically significant difference in the proportion
after admission date when compared to before admission date.

We next compared the prevalence of each neurological ICD code and disease category after
admission date between patients who ever met the criteria of severe COVID-19 and those who

did not, by site and by country. For each ICD code, we computed the expected number of
severe cases (eEq. 3) and compared with the observed number of severe cases for the given
neurological code. To examine the difference in proportion of severe cases for the neurological
ICD codes, we calculated the enrichment of each neurological ICD code by dividing the
observed number of severe cases by the expected number of severe cases and reported a
value of log2 enrichment (LOE) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) (eEq. 4). We estimated the
LOE 95% CI using the Delta method.25 Finally, we computed the p-values using Fisher’s exact
test26 and corrected for multiple hypothesis testing with Benjamini–Hochberg’s false discovery
rate (FDR) procedure.27 A result was statistically significant if pFDR<0.05.

Results
Demographics
Among the 35,177 hospitalized patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, aggregate
demographic data were available for 34,647 patients (98.5%) from 348 hospitals (affiliated with
43 sites, after excluding two US sites with incomplete demographic data). The cohort had a
greater proportion of men (20,814, 60.1%) than women (13,546, 39.1%), while 287 (0.8%)
patients had unknown sex (Fig. 2). Variation in the proportions of severe COVID-19 cases
among the US sites was large, with 18 sites reporting >90% severe cases. The proportions of
severe COVID-19 cases were higher in France than Germany, Italy, Spain, and Singapore.
There was no clear relationship between COVID-19 severity and median age (Fig. 2B). Most
sites in Europe did not report race. Among the US sites, there was a disproportionately high
proportion of Black individuals (Fig. 2C). The study population included a high proportion of
individuals above age 50 years and a low proportion of children (<age 18 years) (Fig. 2D).

Prevalence of Neurological Conditions in All Patients
Using the prevalence before admission as reference, we found that the majority of contributing
sites (77%) reported an increase in the proportion of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with
disorders of consciousness (ICD-10 R41: “Other symptoms and signs involving cognitive
functions and awareness”) with a mean increase of 5.8% (95% CI: 3.7-7.8%, pFDR<0.001) after
admission (Fig. 3, eFig. 1). Similarly, 84% of sites reported an increase in the proportion of

patients with “Unspecified disorders of the brain” (ICD-10 G93, including “encephalopathy”)
with a mean increase of 8.1% (5.7-10.5%, pFDR<0.001) after admission. (see interactive data
repository: https://covidclinical.github.io/Phase1.1NeuroRCode/01-analysisicd10.html#prevalence-change-table). The proportion of patients with “epilepsy and recurrent
seizures” (ICD-10 G40), “encephalitis, myelitis, and encephalomyelitis” (ICD-10 G04) and
“other and unspecified myopathies” (ICD-10 G72) increased after admission, but these findings
were not significant after adjusting for multiple testing. Likewise, none of the other neurological
conditions showed a statistically significant difference in prevalence after admission.

Prevalence of Neurological Conditions in Severe COVID-19
For each neurological ICD code, we used Fisher’s exact test to examine the enrichment or
depletion of the condition among patients who ever experienced severe disease when
compared to those who never experienced severe disease (Fig. 4). A positive log2 value of
enrichment (LOE) value denoted a higher proportion of severe cases for a given neurological
condition than the never-severe cases, while a negative LOE value indicated the opposite. For
instance, a LOE value of 0.283 for ICD code R41 meant that the observed number of severe
cases reporting R41 (disorder of consciousness) was 20.283 or ~1.22 times higher than the
expected number of severe cases for R41, which was equivalent to a 22% increase in relative
risk (i.e., relative risk difference RRD=22%). We presented in Table 3 the statistically
significant associations of neurological conditions and severe COVID-19 status (pFDR<0.05).

repository for the full table containing the LOE, 95% confidence intervals, and p values for all
neurological ICD-codes.

In the period after hospital admission date, using the patients who never experienced severe
disease as reference, we observed a significantly higher proportion of patients with severe
disease who had “other symptoms and signs involving cognitive functions and awareness”
(R41: RRDafter=22%), “other cerebrovascular disease” (ICD-10 I67: RRDafter=24%),
“nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage” (ICD-10 I60: RRDafter=28%), “other and unspecified
nontraumatic intracranial hemorrhage” (ICD-10 I62: RRDafter=34%), “nontraumatic intracerebral
hemorrhage” (ICD-10 I61: RRDafter=36%), “other disorders of the brain” (ICD-10 G93, including
“encephalopathy”: RRDafter=36%), “encephalitis, myelitis and encephalomyelitis” (ICD-10 G04:
RRDafter=37%), and “other and unspecified myopathies” (ICD-10 G72, including “inflammatory
and immune myopathies” and “critical illness myopathies”: RRDafter=72%). In contrast, we
noted a significantly lower proportion of patients with severe disease who had “blindness and
low vision” (ICD-10 H54: RRDafter=-23%), “dizziness and giddiness” (ICD-10 R42: RRDafter=28%), “other headache syndromes” (ICD-10 G44: RRDafter=-47%), “transient cerebral ischemic
attacks and related syndromes” (ICD-10 G45: RRDafter=-45%), and “unspecified psychosis not
due to a substance or known physiological condition” (ICD-10 F29: RRDafter=-44%) during
hospitalization (Table 3, Fig. 4). Subgroup analysis comparing the US and non-US sites
yielded mostly consistent and expected results (eFig. 2).

Exploratory Analysis
As 11 sites in the US and Italy contributed data entirely or partially consisting of ICD-9 codes,
we performed separate subgroup analyses using only the ICD-9 data (eTable 1), given that
one-to-one mapping of some ICD-9 codes to ICD-10 codes was not feasible. To summarize,
there was increased prevalence of “disorders of consciousness” and “other neurological
conditions” in patients after admission date when compared to before admission date, similar
to the ICD-10 data analysis (eFig. 3, eFig. 4). The increase in these conditions appear to be
driven by the US sites but not the Italian sites. There was no statistically significant difference
when examining the change in prevalence of individual neurological ICD-9 codes after
admission date. In severity analysis, there were similarities with the ICD-10 data (e.g.,
“disorders of consciousness”) but also notable differences involving seizure and
cerebrovascular events that would require caution in interpretation due to differences in
sample size (see Supplementary Material, eFig. 5, eTable 2).

Discussion
In this study, we implemented a research strategy for rapidly aggregating EHR-derived clinical
facts across multiple international sites while preserving patient privacy. We report the
prevalence of central and peripheral neurological conditions among patients hospitalized with
SARS-CoV-2 infection across geographically diverse hospital systems from six countries,
using the time period before hospitalization as reference. Importantly, we further compared the
prevalence of neurological conditions between patients with and without severe COVID-19
disease.

We found disorders of consciousness and other disorders of the brain as the most prevalent
neurological phenotypes (based on ICD codes) among all patients hospitalized with positive
SARS-CoV-2, consistent with prior reports.16,17,21 Interestingly, our study showed low
prevalence of early COVID-19 symptoms such as alterations in smell and taste12, likely
attributable to the inconsistent documentation of these symptoms in the EHR for the
hospitalized patient population, particularly those with severe COVID-19. Further, we did not
find statistically significant changes in the prevalence of other previously reported neurological
conditions such as dizziness, encephalopathy, headache, seizure, vascular, and vision
disorders after admission to the hospital. These discrepancies may be partially due to
methodological differences, as our analysis examined the change in prevalence using the data
before admission as the reference.

Our major finding indicates that a significantly higher proportion of hospitalized patients with
severe COVID-19 had disorders of consciousness, encephalitis and/or myelitis,

cerebrovascular events, and myopathy when compared to patients who never had severe
disease. While these findings are largely consistent with prior reports16,20,21, our contribution is
the report of findings from geographically diverse multinational sites. First among these
findings, disorders of consciousness, including altered mental status and encephalopathy as
well as encephalitis, are consistently reported neurological complications of COVID-19.
Sedation for advanced respiratory support and hypoxemia from respiratory failure may partially
explain the association of disorders of consciousness with severe COVID-19. Notably,
encephalopathy is independently associated with high morbidity and mortality in COVID-19.21
Future studies will be important to identify whether the mechanisms underlying encephalitis
(with or without myelitis) are direct central nervous system (CNS) invasion by SARS-CoV-2,
acute systemic inflammation with secondary CNS involvement, and/or post-infectious immunemediated effect on the CNS.28,29

Second, our finding of cerebrovascular diseases associated with severe COVID-19 include
both ischemic strokes and intracranial hemorrhages (nontraumatic intracerebral and
nontraumatic subarachnoid), highlighting the difficult balance when managing severe COVID19 with respect to antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy. Strokes that occurred in the setting
of COVID-19 were associated with high mortality (38% for ischemic stroke and 58% for
intracranial hemorrhage)30 and morbidity. COVID-19 might increase the risk of ischemic stroke
through diverse mechanisms such as activation of innate immune system, cardioembolic
events, hypoxia-induced ischemia secondary to severe pulmonary disease, coagulation
activation, thrombotic angiopathy, and endothelial damage31. Proposed mechanisms
underlying intracranial hemorrhage in COVID-19 include coagulation abnormalities, endothelial

dysfunction, dysregulation of the renin-angiotensin system, and disruption of cerebral blood
flow autoregulation32,33. Patients with severe COVID-19 may have additional risk factors such
as hypertension or cardiovascular disease that could further drive cerebrovascular diseases.34

Finally, while myopathy is common among COVID-19 patients, its mechanism remains
unclear. Given that SARS-CoV-2 interacts with the spike domain of ACE2 on host cells35 and
skeletal muscle tissues express ACE236, muscle may be susceptible to direct SARS-CoV-2
infection. However, myopathy in patients with severe COVID-19 is likely attributable to
prolonged or severe critical illness37, complications due to multi-organ involvement, or
medication-induced myotoxicity (e.g., Hydroxychloroquine, steroids). Our current study design
cannot differentiate whether the neurological phenotypes are the direct consequence of SARSCoV-9 neurotoxicity or due to secondary causes.

Interestingly, some neurological phenotypes are less prevalent in patients with severe COVID19, including psychosis, dizziness, vision impairment, transient ischemic attack, and headache.
The likely explanation is that critically ill patients with or without respiratory failure would either
not have objective evaluation or proper documentation and coding for these conditions.

Our study has limitations as the result of trade-offs to standardize data collection from
multinational sites while strictly preserving patient privacy and adhering to multinational privacy
laws across all contributing sites. First, this study relied on ICD codes that may not capture
fully or accurately the disease phenotypes, particularly for conditions better documented in
clinical notes. To standardize collection of ICD codes across contributing sites and to mitigate

coding discrepancies, we used ICD codes at the categorical level (e.g., the first 3
alphanumeric characters before the decimal point for ICD-10). Thus, further characterization of
certain conditions such as “other disorders of the brain” was not feasible at this stage. Second,
the proportions of severe cases varied across sites. Adding the number of patients from all
sites for each ICD code retained statistical power in the severity analysis, though data from the
larger sites likely drove the findings. Third, because we aggregated data across sites, we were
unable to consolidate all related ICD codes (e.g., organizing into PheCode38) at the individual
patient level. The 4CE consortium is addressing these issues to prepare for the next phase of
the analyses by developing a framework for conducting patient-level analyses at each site.
Fourth, we might not have captured all pre-admission EHR data if patients did not receive all of
their care in the same hospital system as the COVID-19 admission. This is a limitation
common to all research using EHR data from non-universal health systems. Finally,
contributing sites with small patient counts used obfuscation to reduce the risk of re-identifying
sites, but the effect of obfuscation is negligible because few sites had neurological conditions
of interest in cases fewer than the obfuscation level. Despite the limitations of deploying this
rapid, scalable, patient privacy-preserving research strategy, our key findings replicated prior
reports from well-characterized but often smaller and single-center cohort studies.

We report the first multinational prevalence study of a broad spectrum of central and peripheral
neurological phenotypes in hospitalized patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection,
particularly those with severe disease, using a common EHR data collection method. Our
EHR-based efforts complement registry-based research design. In future studies, we will
conduct individual-level analysis using additional EHR data such as complete ICD codes,

Figure 4. Analysis of enrichment or depletion of neurological conditions after admission
in patients with severe disease. For each neurological ICD-10 code, we show the log2
enrichment (LOE) and its 95% confidence interval (left), and the absolute difference between
the observed () and expected (∙) number of patients experiencing severe COVID-19 in squareroot scale (right). A purple positive LOE value for an ICD-10 code indicates a statistically
significantly higher proportion of severe cases having a given neurological ICD-10 code when
compared to the never-severe cases. Conversely, a green negative LOE value indicates a
statistically significantly lower proportion of severe cases having a given neurological ICD-10
code when compared to the never-severe cases. Neurological ICD-10 codes are ordered by
the expected number of severe cases after admission.
