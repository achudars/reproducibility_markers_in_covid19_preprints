Abstract
Ascertaining the state of coronavirus outbreaks is crucial for public health decision-making. Absent repeated representative viral test
samples in the population, public health oﬃcials and researchers alike
have relied on lagging indicators of infection to make inferences about
the direction of the outbreak and attendant policy decisions. Recently
researchers have shown that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in municipal sewage sludge with measured RNA concentrations rising and
falling suggestively in the shape of an epidemic curve while providing an earlier signal of infection than hospital admissions data. The

present paper presents a SARS-CoV-2 epidemic model to serve as a
basis for estimating the incidence of infection, and shows mathematically how modeled transmission dynamics translate into infection indicators by incorporating probability distributions for indicator-specific
time lags from infection. Hospital admissions and SARS-CoV-2 RNA
in municipal sewage sludge are simultaneously modeled via maximum
likelihood scaling to the underlying transmission model. The results
demonstrate that both data series plausibly follow from the transmission model specified and provide a 95% confidence interval estimate of
the reproductive number 0 ≈ 24 ±02. Sensitivity analysis accounting for alternative lag distributions from infection until hospitalization
and sludge RNA concentration respectively suggests that the detection
of viral RNA in sewage sludge leads hospital admissions by 3 to 5 days
on average. The analysis suggests that stay-at-home restrictions plausibly removed 89% of the population from the risk of infection with
the remaining 11% exposed to an unmitigated outbreak that infected
9.3% of the total population.

Highlights
•A maximum likelihood method for aligning observed lagged
epidemic indicators via an underlying transmission model is derived and illustrated using observed COVID-19 hospital admissions
and SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations measured in sewage sludge
to model a local SARS-CoV-2 outbreak
•The method enables direct estimation of the reproductive number 0 from the observed indicators along with the initial prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population at risk
•The analysis suggests tracking SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration in sewage sludge provides a 3 to 5 day lead time over tracking
hospital admissions, consistent with purely statistical time series
analysis previously reported
•The model enables estimation of the fraction of the population compliant with government-mandated stay-at-home restrictions, the size of the exposed population, and the fraction of the
population infected with SARS-CoV-2 over the outbreak

Introduction

Ascertaining the state of coronavirus outbreaks is crucial for public health
decision-making. Absent repeated representative viral test samples in the
population (Kaplan and Forman 2020), public health oﬃcials and researchers
alike have relied on lagging indicators of infection to make inferences about
the direction of the outbreak and attendant policy decisions. How useful
these indicators are depends upon their typical lags behind the incidence of
infection. Some indicator lags, such as time from infection to hospitalization,
have been studied empirically (Lewnard et al 2020, CDC 2020, MIDAS 2020).
Other indicators have been proposed with the hope that they would greatly
reduce the lag time from infection. One such promising indicator is measured
SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration in municipal wastewater (Foladori et al
2020, Hart and Halden 2020, Peccia et al 2020). How much earlier might
such a signal inform oﬃcials of changes in the state of the outbreak?
This paper tackles this question by using an epidemic transmission model
to create model-scale versions of whatever indicator is of interest, and then
scales these model quantities to match observed indicator values in the real
world. This approach clarifies the time lags that should be expected from
SARS-CoV-2 incidence to whichever indicator is of interest, and by doing so
makes it possible to compare the relative timing of one indicator to another,
providing the model fit to the data is suﬃciently close.
Our study takes advantage of recently conducted research tracking the

local SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in the New Haven, Connecticut, USA metropolitan area.

As reported by Peccia et al (2020), daily SARS-CoV-2 RNA

concentrations were obtained by sampling sewage sludge from the local wastewater treatment plant and conducting PCR tests to determine virus RNA
concentration. Daily COVID-19 admissions to the Yale New Haven Hospital restricted to residents of the same four towns served by this wastewater
treatment plant were also recorded over the same time period. An epidemic
model developed by Kaplan (2020b) was taken as the basis for calibrating
these two lagging indicators while simultaneously estimating the initial condition and reproductive number 0 of this outbreak. This paper details the
methodology employed and results obtained from doing so.
The next section presents a quick description of the transmission model
reported in Kaplan (2020b). In Section 3, a simple method is described for
linking model-scale lagging epidemic indicators to SARS-CoV-2 incidence
based on the model and appropriately defined lag probability density functions, which enables a model-scale comparison of diﬀerent indicators to see
how they should appear over the course of an outbreak (Figure 1). Section 4
presents a simple statistical approach to analyzing real-world indicator data
by scaling modeled indicators up to observed values based on maximum likelihood estimation while also estimating the initial condition and reproductive
number of the epidemic wave from the underlying transmission model. We
simultaneously scale hospital admissions and the RNA virus concentration
observed in the sewage sludge to the epidemic model (Table 1, Figure 2 and

3). The results show that accounting for the inherent noise in the data, both
the virus RNA concentration in the sewage sludge and hospital admissions
match the model expectations reasonably well, and provides a 95% confidence interval for the reproductive number 0 ≈ 24 ± 02. Section 5 reports
a sensitivity analysis to allow for diﬀerent probability distributions for the
lags from infection to hospital admissions and sludge RNA concentration respectively. The analysis verifies that there is a 3 to 5 day separation between
the sludge RNA concentration and hospital admissions curve, consistent with
earlier analysis based on statistical time-series analysis (Peccia et al 2020).
Section 6 uses the preceding analysis to provide epidemic insights suggesting
that stay-at-home restrictions eﬀectively bifurcated the local population by
plausibly removing 89% of the population from the risk of infection with the
remaining 11% exposed to an unmitigated outbreak that infected 9.3% of
the total population. Section 7 provides a summary of the key points of the
paper.

Transmission Model

Data detailing person-to-person SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Wuhan were
reported by Li et al (2020). These data enabled an early model-based assessment of prospects for containing coronavirus via isolation and quarantine
(Kaplan 2020a), while that analysis was extended to a dynamic transmission
model for SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Connecticut (Kaplan 2020b). This

latter model incorporates infection-age-dependent transmission, and thus
falls into the class of renewal equation epidemic models (Heesterbeek and
Dietz 1996, Champredon and Dushoﬀ 2015). The key model element is the
age-of-infection dependent transmission rate (), which can be thought of
as the instantaneous transmission intensity of an individual who has been infected for  time units. At the beginning of an outbreak when an infectious
person is embedded in an otherwise susceptible population, the expected
number of infections transmitted per infectious person equals the reproductive number 0 , which is given by

as is well known. Li et al (2020) reported estimates of both the exponential
growth rate  and backwards generation time probability density function

(Kaplan 2020a, 2020b; Britton and Tomba 2019; Champredon and Dushoﬀ
2015; Wallinga and Lipsitch 2007), which together imply a point estimate of
0 = 226 (Kaplan 2020a), consistent with values widely reported elsewhere
(Ferguson et al 2020, Kissler et al 2020, MIDAS 2020, Park et al 2020).

An alternative representation of () is

(3)

() = 0 ()

where () is the forward generation time density that dictates the timing
of transmission (Britton and Tomba 2019; Champredon and Dushoﬀ 2015;
Wallinga and Lipsitch 2007). We adopt this representation in the present
analysis, as it enables estimation of the underlying reproductive number 0
directly from the data at our disposal.
The transmission model developed in Kaplan (2020b) that will be used
to anchor our infection indicators analysis follows. Let
() ≡ transmission potential (or force of infection) at chronological time
;
() ≡ fraction of the population that is susceptible to infection at chronological time ;
( ) ≡ density of the population that has been infected for duration 

Equation (4) defines the transmission potential at time , which is infectionage-dependent transmission () weighted by the infection-age-dependent
prevalence of infection in the population ( ); equation (5) equates SARSCoV-2 incidence to the product of the fraction of the population that is
susceptible and the transmission potential; equation (6) depletes susceptibles with the incidence of infection; and equation (7) aligns the fraction of
the population infected for duration  at time  with the incidence of infection at time  − , adjusting for the initial conditions at time zero. There is
no additional accounting for the duration of infectiousness because the time
course of infection is already built into ().

Model-Scale Infection Indicators and Time
Lags

In the absence of repeated representative viral testing in a population, oﬃcials and researchers alike have turned to lagging indicators of infection such
as diagnosed COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths to monitor the
state of the outbreak. How useful such indicators are depends upon their lag
time from infection. Let () be the value of a model-scale infection indicator
that represents a distributionally lagged signal of the incidence of infection.
Specifically, denote  as the time lag from infection, and define  ()
as the probability density function governing the lag   The model-scale

() ≈ (0  − ( ))

(10)

which suggests that the model-scale indicator value can be approximated by
incidence evaluated ( ) time units earlier. The model-scale indicator at
time  is just the expected value of SARS-CoV-2 incidence  time units
into the past. Note from equation (8) that

which shows that the model-scale indicator solely reflects the timing at which
SARS-CoV-2 incidence is experienced for whatever indicator is of interest
while conserving the total incidence of infection. The units for all modelscale indicators thus equal infections per person per unit time, regardless of
which real-world indicator is being considered.

3.1

Example: Hospital Admissions

Hospital admissions have been used as an indicator for the coronavirus outbreak under the presumption that the fraction of new infections that require
hospitalization remains constant over time. Define  as the time from infection to hospitalization for those infected persons that do require hospital
treatment. A review of several published studies by Lewnard et al (2020) estimated that the time from infection until hospitalization averages 13.5 days
with 95% probability coverage ranging from 4.8 to 27.9 days. We approximate this finding by employing a gamma distribution with  = 4954 and
 = 2725 to represent the probability density of  ,  (). This distribution also has a mean of 13.5 days with 95% probability coverage ranging from
4.4 to 27.7 days (see Figure 4a). Similar times from infection to hospitalization are implied by the Centers for Disease Control COVID-19 pandemic
planning scenarios (CDC 2020) and also MIDAS (2020). We employ this density in our base case analysis, but will consider distributions with shorter and
longer times from infection to hospital admissions in the sensitivity analyses
of Section 5.
Conditional upon the transmission model described in equations (4-7), the

Example: SARS-CoV-2 RNA in Municipal Sewage
Sludge

Peccia et al (2020) reported daily SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations based
on sampling sludge from a municipal wastewater treatment plant serving
the combined 200,000 population of the towns of New Haven, East Haven,
Hamden, and Woodbridge in the state of Connecticut, USA. Virus RNA
concentrations in sludge should reflect the amount of virus shed in feces by

infected persons in the population served by the treatment plant, resulting in
a fecal estimate of community virus RNA concentration. Though virus RNA
concentrations in feces degrade exponentially with the time from excretion
to sample collection (Foladori et al 2020, Hart and Halden, 2020), virus RNA
concentrations obtained from sludge sampled daily should be discounted by
approximately the same degradation factor, rendering the resulting signal a
plausible surrogate tracking community virus RNA concentration over time.
Referring back to the epidemic model, the appropriate measure of virus
RNA concentration is the transmission potential (), as the amount of virus
shed in feces should reflect the average infectiousness of the population. However, to use the indicator framework developed above, the age-of-infection
transmission rate () must be normalized to the scale of a probability density function. This is easily achieved by defining

 () =

()
,0

which is immediately recognized as the forward generation time probability
density () introduced earlier. This density enables the definition of the

For () as defined in equation (3) using the forward generation time
density () corresponding to Li et al (2020), the expected lag ( ) is given
by 8.9 days, or 4.6 days shorter than the lag from infection to hospitalization
(we consider an alternative generation time distribution in Section 5). Figure
1 reports the model-scale virus RNA indicator () under the same epidemic
modeling assumptions described for the hospitalization indicator (). Given
the transmission model, the timing of both the virus RNA concentration and
hospitalization indicators is clear, and provides a clue as to what might be
expected when examining the timing of observed hospital admissions and
SARS-CoV-2 data in sewage sludge. We turn to such an empirical analysis
in the next section.

Scaling Indicators to Transmission: Hospital Admissions and SARS-CoV-2 RNA in
Sewage Sludge

Consider a model-scale infection indicator () as earlier described, and let
 () be the random variable denoting the real-world-scale observable value
of this indicator at time . For example, corresponding to the model-scale
hospitalization indicator (), the real-world number of hospital admissions
observed on day  is the random variable (). Similarly, random variable
 () denotes the actual concentration of RNA observed in sewage sludge on
day , corresponding with the model-scale virus RNA concentration indicator
().
The observable indicator  () is modeled as a random variable with mean
proportional to (), that is,

( ()) =  ()   

(15)

for some indicator-specific constant  . We thus scale observable indicators
to their model-scale values in expectation. Note from equation (11) that

We also allow the indicator variance  2 () to depend upon (). Given the
transmission model, we treat  () as conditionally independent of  (0 ) for
all  6= 0 , for correlation in observed values across time would almost entirely
be due to the underlying epidemic. The specific probability law presumed
for  () given () can diﬀer by infection indicator, as will become clear by
example. Given observed indicator values at diﬀerent points in time and an
underlying epidemic model, one can estimate the scaling constants  (and
variance parameters if needed) via maximum likelihood or other methods.
The Peccia et al (2020) study of sewage sludge obtained daily COVID-19
admissions data to the Yale New Haven Hospital restricted to residents of
the same four Connecticut towns served by the local wastewater treatment
plant. The data record the first such admission as occurring on March 14,
2020, 24 days following our February 19 starting date ( = 0). We focus here
on daily admissions data recorded through May 1, 2020 ( = 72).
Daily hospital admissions data  are modeled as realizations of a Poisson
random variable () with mean proportional to the model-scale indicator

Also as reported in Peccia et al (2020), sludge samples from the local
wastewater treatment plant were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations with two diﬀerent primers applied to two sample replications daily.
These values were adjusted to control for day to day variations in treatment
plant flow, sludge solids content, and RNA extraction eﬃciency (Peccia et
al 2020). The data we employ here are  , the day  average of these four
adjusted values with measurement units 105 SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies / ml

the forward generation lag density  () =  () based on Li et al (2020),
and hospital lag density  () based on Lewnard et al (2020)). Three of the
parameters estimated are the hospitalization scaling constant  , the sludge
RNA scaling constant  , and the sludge RNA variance scaling constant
 . The fourth parameter estimated is 0 which scales the strength of the
outbreak and enables direct comparison to SARS-CoV-2 epidemics elsewhere.
The final parameter estimated is (0), which sets the initial condition of the
model via the relation

This modeling choice reflects the random arrival of imported infections to the
area of study in the thirty days preceding the onset of community transmission, in eﬀect determining the placement of the main epidemic wave without
changing its shape. A larger value of (0) would pull the epidemic earlier
in time, while a smaller value would push the epidemic later. In this way,
the hospital admissions and sludge virus RNA concentration data jointly
determine the size and the placement of the epidemic wave while impacting the transmission dynamics via the model described in equations (4-7).
Consequently, population susceptibility at time 0 is given by (0) = 1 − (0)

trations (in 105 RNA copies / ml sludge) from the sewage study along with
conservative 95% prediction intervals. While peak RNA virus concentrations
are higher than what would be expected based on the model, the data again
match the estimated pace of the epidemic, suggesting that community virus
RNA concentration in sewage sludge can indeed be represented by the transmission potential in an epidemic model. The data rise and fall as expected,
albeit with much random noise to be sure.

Note that the estimated reproductive number is 2.38 with a 95% confidence interval ranging from 2.18 to 2.58. This places the local SARS-CoV-2
outbreak in New Haven squarely in the middle of reproductive numbers estimated elsewhere (for examples see CDC (2020) and MIDAS (2020)). What
is noteworthy is that this reproductive number was estimated from a model
linking transmission to hospital admissions and SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations measured in sewage sludge. The data, not the model, determined

the magnitude of 0 , supporting the plausibility of the hospitalization and
generation time lag distributions employed to match the observed data to an
underlying transmission model.
Together with the epidemic model, these data help explain one of the
findings in the Peccia et al (2020) study, which is that the SARS-CoV-2
RNA signal from the sewage sludge led hospital admissions by only 4 days,
when many were expecting a much earlier signal. The model shows that the
natural time lag for virus RNA concentration is governed by the mean forward
generation time, estimated at 8.9 days in this model. Given an average 13.5
day lag from infection to hospitalization documented elsewhere (Lewnard et
al 2020), tracking the outbreak by relying on the sewage sludge RNA signal
leads similar tracking by hospital admissions by 4.6 days on average, which
is very close to the purely statistical time series results reported by Peccia et
al (2020).

Sensitivity Analyses

The analysis of Section 4 relies on two particular lag distributions: the forward generation time based on Li et al (2020) and the hospital admissions
density based on Lewnard et al (2020). Diﬀerent lag distributions could generate diﬀerent results yet also appear reasonably consistent with the data.
In this section we will summarize maximum likelihood scalings as in the
previous section but using alternative lag density combinations.

Starting with the forward generation time density that is used to both
drive the epidemic model and provide a model-scale indicator for SARS-CoV2 RNA in sewage sludge, we turn to the meta-analysis of several published
studies reported by Park et al (2020). The consensus distribution from that
analysis is also a gamma density but with a mean (standard deviation) of
8.5 (6.1) days.

Figure 4a plots both the Li et al (2020) and Park et al

(2020) generation time densities, from which one can see that the timing of
transmission is relatively early under the Park et al (2020) model relative
to our base case of Li et al (2020). Regarding the distribution of the time
from infection until hospital admission for those requiring hospitalization,
CDC (2020) recommends a mean of 12 days based upon 6 day mean times
from infection until the onset of symptoms, and from the onset of symptoms
until hospitalization. We model this “short” hospitalization lag as a gamma
distribution with a mean (standard deviation) of 12 (6) days.

To explore

the possibility that sludge RNA provides a longer lead time over COVID-19
hospitalizations, we also consider a “long” hospitalization gamma-distributed
lag with a mean (standard deviation) of 15 (6.7) days. Figure 4b plots the
short, base case (following Lewnard et al 2020), and long hospitalization lag
densities.

Table 2 reports the mean lead time (given by the diﬀerence between the
mean hospitalization and forward generation/sludge RNA lags), log likelihood function, estimated reproductive number 0 and estimated initial fraction infected  0 for all six combinations of the hospitalization and forward
generation lags. While all the maximized log likelihood values are comparable, the late transmission Li et al (2020) generation time density fits slightly
better than the early transmission Park et al (2020) generation time density
for all three hospital lags, while the hospitalization lag densities fit best from
short to Lewnard et al (2020) to long for both generation time densities.
The point estimates for 0 range from 2.2 (early transmission and long hospitalization lag) to 2.43 (late transmission and short hospitalization lag), and
are all within the 95% confidence interval provided by our earlier base case
analysis in Section 4. The point estimates for the initial fraction infected
0 range from 0.010 to 0.019, and are also all within the 95% confidence

there is slightly more evidence favoring shorter RNA sludge lead times. The
best fitting model (late transmission and short hospital lag) estimates that
sludge RNA provides an expected lead time of only 3.1 days over hospital
admissions data, while the worst fitting model (early transmission and long
hospital lag) has an expected lead time of 6.5 days. Together these results
suggest that the sludge RNA signal provides a 3 to 5 day lead time over hospital admissions, consistent with what was found based on statistical time
series analysis in Peccia et al (2020).

Epidemic Insights

The epidemic model developed describes an unmitigated outbreak among a
population at risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection, but in Connecticut where this
study took place, social distancing and lockdown-like stay-at-home orders
were imposed on March 22 (Lamont 2020a) and extended past the duration of

our study period (Lamont 2020b). An unmitigated outbreak with 0 = 238
would leave 87.5% of the population infected, but clearly that did not occur
in the greater New Haven urban area.
Nonetheless, the timing of the sludge and hospital admissions data are
consistent with an unmitigated outbreak. Models reflecting the eﬀect of lockdowns and social distancing applied uniformly to large populations show that
transmission is both delayed and slowed, resulting in the oft-cited flattening
of the epidemic curve (Ferguson et al 2020, Kissler et al 2020, Kaplan 2020b).
The epidemic models we have shown to be consistent with the observed data
do not behave this way, suggesting that the eﬀect of the stay-at-home orders was not experienced uniformly. A diﬀerent possibility is that stay-athome restrictions essentially bifurcated the population into two groups: a
large group of citizens whose compliance with stay-at-home restrictions removed them from potentially infectious interactions, and a smaller group of
essential workers, other vulnerable persons such as nursing home residents,
or non-compliant individuals that, due to necessity or choice, continued to
experience exposures via interactions with others, enabling continued transmission. Were that the case, then members of the “exposed” population
could have experienced an unmitigated outbreak while compliant individuals
escaped unscathed. The epidemic model of this paper might only portray
transmission among the exposed population, yet all infections and hence
hospitalizations and SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the sewage sludge would have
emanated from this group.

To investigate this possibility, we will use our model results to produce
a back-of-the-envelope estimate of the fraction of the population that was
exposed, and consequentially the fraction of the entire population that complied with the stay-at-home restrictions. We will also estimate the implied
number of infections that must have occurred under this bifurcation hypothesis, including the initial number of infected persons circa February 19, 2020
(which recall is clock time 0).
First, we apply equation (16) to the expected total number of hospital
admissions over all time from this outbreak which yields

H =  

(21)

Next, define N and C as the number of persons in the exposed population
and the total number of diagnosed COVID-19 cases that occurred in that
population respectively over all time. A second equation for H is given by

infections in the exposed population, also known as the case ascertainment
ratio.

Under the bifurcation hypothesis, this will be the same as the ra-

tio of diagnosed COVID-19 cases to infections in the overall population, as
infections and cases only accrue in the exposed group.

A direct estimate

of the reciprocal of the case ascertainment ratio (that is, the number of infections per diagnosed COVID-19 case) was reported by Havers et al (2020)
for Connecticut covering March 23 - May 12 of 2020 via a population-based
seroprevalence survey. Havers et al (2020) estimated an average of 6.0 infections per case (95% confidence interval 4.3−7.8).

The ratio HC can

be estimated directly from Peccia et al (2020) who reported that there were
2,674 diagnosed cases and 734 hospital admissions emanating from the four
towns served by the local wastewater treatment plant. The constant  was
estimated in our base case analysis of Section 4 to equal 1006.6 (see Table
1).

persons were infected by May 1 in the New Haven metropolitan area (or 9.3%

diagnosed cases, a 95% confidence interval estimate for the number infected
runs from 11,500 to 20,900 persons, in agreement with our model-based result. Finally, given our estimate that 1.6% of the exposed population was

Summary

This paper has focused on modeling lagging epidemic indicators and how they
relate to each other. The approach has been to utilize an epidemic model as
a basis for scaling indicators like hospital admissions or SARS-CoV-2 RNA
observed in sewage sludge. After characterizing how indicators lag incidence,
we showed how one could use an epidemic model to simultaneously estimate
the placement of an epidemic wave (via estimating the initial condition),
the strength of an outbreak (via estimating 0 ), and situate lagging indica-

tors appropriately, allowing one to view the data in a more epidemiologically
meaningful way. Using data from a recently published study of SARS-CoV-2
RNA concentrations observed in municipal sewage sludge, we showed why
the RNA data were only able to shorten the time from infection to signal
by 3 to 5 days relative to hospital admissions. The RNA and hospitalization data jointly implied an epidemic with 0 of approximately 238, well
within the range implied by numerous studies. To reconcile this finding with
the fact that Connecticut was under strict lockdown-like stay-at-home orders
throughout most of the study period, we postulated that the stay-at-home
restrictions eﬀectively bifurcated the population, resulting in an unmitigated
outbreak among an estimated 11% of the population who remained exposed
to infections while sparing the remaining 89% who complied with the restrictions.

Overall we estimated that about 9.3% of the total population

became infected. To our knowledge, ours is the first study to develop such
population-level findings based on exploiting the infection signal contained
in SARS-CoV-2 RNA in sewage sludge and COVID-19 hospital admissions
data.
