Keywords: COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; The elderly; Risk assessment; Risk prediction

prediction of severe or critical events of COVID-19 in the elderly patients in China. (2) Methods:
The clinical data of COVID-19 in the elderly patients admitted to the Shanghai Public Health
Clinical Center during the period of January 20, 2020 to March 16, 2020 were collected. A
retrospective cohort study design was conducted to screen out independent factors through Cox
univariable regression analysis and multivariable regression analysis, and the efficacy of risk
prediction of severe or critical illness was examined through the receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) curve. (3)Results: A total of 110 elderly patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. 52 (47.3%)
were males and 21 (19.1%) had severe or critical illness. Multivariable regression analysis showed
that CD4 cells and D-dimer were independent risk factors. D-dimer, CD4 cells, and D-dimer/CD
cells ratios with cut off values of 0.65 (mg/L), 268 (cell/ul) and 431 were in the prediction of severe
or critical illness of the elderly COVID-19. The AUC value of D-dimer, CD4 cells, CD4
cells/D-dimer ratio, the tandem group and the parallel group were 0.703, 0.804, 0.794, 0.812 and
0.694, respectively. (4) Conclusions: D-dimer, CD4 cells and their combination have risk assessment
value in predicting severe or critical illness of COVID-19 in the elderly.

1. Introduction
The disease burdens of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), have been continuously increasing [1]. To date,
there have been over 3.5 million confirmed patients and over 0.24 million deaths globally according
to COVID-19 global data from Johns Hopkins University (JHU). Elderly has been reported as a
significant predictor of morbidity and mortality in patients with COVID-19 [2]. The mortality of
elderly patients with COVID-19 is higher than that of young and middle-aged patients and elderly

patients with COVID-19 are more likely to progress to severe disease [2]. A rennet meta-analysis
found that the case-fatality rate (CFR), proportion of severe cases, acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS) were significantly higher in studies in which the proportion of elderly patients
was larger [3].A single center retrospective study found that elder patients with comorbidities and
ARDS were at increased risk of death [4]. A multivariate Cox regression analysis results showed age
and severe cases were identified as independent prognostic factors for virus clearance. Another
study also confirmed that high proportion of severe to critical cases and high fatality rate were
observed in the elderly COVID-19 patients [5]. Furthermore, a study showed that older patients with
comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death [4]. Given a large aging population
worldwide, it is important to understand characteristics and susceptibility of and impact on elderly
patients with COVID-19. Up to now, there has been few reports on risk assessment of severe or
critical illness of COVID-19 in the elderly [2, 5, 6].This study aims to provide a comprehensive
understanding clinical characteristics of elderly patients with COVID-19 and determinants of
prognosis.

Patients with COVID-19 confirmed diagnosis admitted to the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center from
January 20, 2020 to March 16, 2020 were included. Confirmed diagnosis met following criteria: the patients
had epidemiological contact history or clinical manifestations, and positive nucleic acid of COVID-19 was
confirmed with real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Severe events of COVID-19
patients was defined as one of the following conditions: shortness of breath with respiratory rate (RR) ≥30
times/min; the oxygen saturation ≤93% at rest; the arterial partial oxygen pressure (PaO2)/oxygen absorption
concentration (FiO2) ≤ 300mmHg. Critical events of COVID-19 patients was defined as one of the following
conditions: respiratory failure with the need for mechanical ventilation; shock; patients with other organ
-failures should be treated in ICU [7].Elderly patients were defined as aged ≥ 60 years old. Severe or critical
illness were defined as patients with COVID-19 developed severe or critical events during hospitalization. The
index date was set as the first day of hospitalization. The endpoint was the occurrence of severe or critical illness
during hospitalization. The high-risk group was defined as elderly patients with COVID-19 who developed
severe or critical events during hospitalization, and the control group was defined as the elderly patients with
COVID-19 who did not develop to severe or critical illness during hospitalization.
Informed consents of patients were obtained for diagnosis and treatment, and the study protocol was approved
by the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center Clinical Committee. All the data received Institutional Review
Board (IRB) approval by the Ethics Committee. The IRB number was YJ-2020-S015-01.

2.2 Study design and indicators
A retrospective cohort study design was conducted to collect the demographic and clinical data from
electronic medical record (EMR) including hospital information system (HIS), laboratory information system
(LIS) and radiology information system (RIS) of Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center. The demographic and
clinical data included age and sex of the patients, the number of pulmonary lobe involved by COVID-19 on the
CT scan, history of hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease; laboratory testing results including alanine
aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH), total bilirubin (TBIL), albumin (ALB), prealbumin (PA), total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), urea

thrombin time (APTT), fibrinogen (Fg) and thrombin time (PT), coagulation time (TT), D-dimer (D-D),
leukocyte (WBC), leukocyte(Neu), lymphocyte(Lym), hemoglobin (Hgb), blood platelet (PLT), and
CD4+cells(CD4). All the above baseline information was collected in the 24 hours after admission.

Person chi-square test was used for counting data analysis. The K-S test was used for the normality of
continuous variables. Data with normal distribution were described as mean ± standard deviation. The median
and quartile was used for the data without normal distribution. The difference between case and control groups
was tested by Manny-Whitney U.
The possible risk factors of severe or critical illness were investigated with Cox proportional hazards (PH)
regression models for univariate and multivariate analyses to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence
intervals (CIs). PH assumption was verified using Schoenfeld residuals.
For the prediction indicators, the cut-off value was calculated according to of maximum Youden Index.
Youden Index (YDI) is the main summary statistic of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve used in
the interpretation and evaluation of an indicator, which defines the maximum potential effectiveness of a
diagnostic test. An optimum cut-off point can be determined by calculating Youden's index (J can be formally
defined as YDI = maxc {Se (c) + Sp (c) − 1}) for each possible cut-off point. The cut-off point that achieves this
maximum Youden's Index is referred to as the optimal cut-point (c*) because it is the cut-off point that
optimizes the diagnostic test’s differentiating ability when equal weight is given to sensitivity and specificity.
The prediction efficiency of prediction indicators was evaluated by ROC curve. The area under curve (AUC) of
ROC were compared using Delong test. The P value of two-sided less than 0.05 was considered as statistically
significant. SPSS software version 16.0 (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA,) was used for statistical analysis of the
data.

3.1 Baseline profile of COVID-19 in elderly adults
A total of 110 elderly patients of confirmed COVID-19 were included in this study, in which 52
were males (47.3%). 21 patients (19.1%) were included in the high-risk group and 89 patients (80.9%)
in the control group. The proportion of males, aspartate aminotransferase, creatine kinase, lactate
dehydrogenase, total bilirubin, creatinine, activated partial thrombin time, thrombin time,
creatinine, D-dimer, neutrophil count, neutrophil percentage and hemoglobin in the high-risk
group were higher than those in the control group (P<0.05). The level of albumin, pre-albumin,
lymphocytes and CD4 cells in the high-risk group were lower than those in the control group
(P<0.05). The detailed information was shown in

The novel coronavirus is a virus of the family coronavirus, which is derived from bats
according to gene sequencing. It belongs to a new independent evolution branch of coronavirus,
and has high homology with coronavirus related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and
coronavirus related to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) [8-16]. The virus is mainly
spread by droplets and contact, and there is the possibility of aerosol transmission. Incubation
patients and asymptomatic virus carriers are also infectious [17].As SARS virus through S protein

human to human transmission [18-20]. Compared with the SARS virus, COVID-19 virus is less
virulent but more infectious [19, 20].
Studies have confirmed that aging is an independent contributor to COVID-19 death. Therefore,
it is of great value to analyze the risk prediction indicators. This study is mainly to analyze the risk
factors and practical applications of severe or critical events in the elderly patients. In this paper, the
regression analysis was used to collect COVID-19 keywords from recent literature retrieval, and
representative indicators were selected for statistical analysis based on clinical experience and
practical value. To avoid the time difference between baseline data and severe or critical events at
admission, Cox regression was used for progressive analysis to determine whether the study
parameters were independent influencing factors. The ROC curve was used to deduce the warning
value of risk factors.
The lung accumulation range of COVID-19 in the early stage was generally wide in the elderly,
and the median of both the risk group and the control group was 5 lobes, showing no statistically
significant difference between the two groups. Age and sex were the risk factors for COVID-19
severe or critical events in the elderly. The complications of hypertension, diabetes and
cardiovascular disease did not significantly aggravate with the severe or critical events. These
imported cases may have milder comorbidities; because the cases with severe comorbidities may be
less likely to be infected due to the limited range of daily communication.
Subsequently, the sample size could be increased to stratify the severity and control of
complications and further verify the risk ratio. However, the number of complications in the elderly
is more than that in the non-elderly, and the complications of basic diseases in the elderly is
significantly correlated with the occurrence of end-stage event [2, 6].Alanine aminotransferase and
aspartate aminotransferase had no effect on severe or critical events in elderly COVID-19, which
was consistent with earlier reports [21].Early indicators such as creatine kinase, lactate

dehydrogenase, bilirubin, urea, creatinine, albumin, prealbumin, white blood cells, neutrophils and
hemoglobin were related factors influencing the severe or critical events of COVID-19 in the elderly,
rather than independent factors. It could be related to the basic metabolism, characteristics of
infection, body immunity, combination of basic diseases and starting point set by the research in the
elderly patients.
In this study, CD4 cells were independent factors affecting severe or critical events of
COVID-19 in the elderly. Previous studies of SARS have also confirmed a decrease in the absolute
count of CD4 cells, with characteristic changes throughout the pathogenesis, which is consistent
with the characteristics of coronavirus family infection. Recent studies have reported that novel
coronavirus infection can induce CD4 cell apoptosis [22]. Compared with the survival group, the
absolute count level of CD4 cells in the death group of viral pneumonia was significantly reduced,
suggesting that a large number of T cells were activated and depleted during the antiviral process.
All of the above supports the study results of CD4 cells; and CD4 cells < 268 cell/ul have a
significant predictive effect on the occurrence of severe or critical COVID-19 events in the elderly,
with high sensitivity(81.0%) and negative predictive value (94.7%).
As for the lymphocyte count, there were significant differences in the univariate analysis, but
no significant differences in the multivariate analysis. Lymphocyte count was preliminarily
determined to be a risk factor associated with COVID-19 severe or critical events in the elderly,
rather than an independent factor. Recently, novel coronavirus pneumonia has been reported to
have a significant decrease in lymphocytes in the whole population [23, 24]; novel coronavirus may
act on lymphocytes via ACE2 receptor, causing lymphocytopenia [25]or induce lymphocytopenia
by TNF, interleukin-6, and other pro-inflammatory cytokines [26]; which is also characteristic of
coronavirus infection of immune cells. In this study, lymphocytes were indeed low in the elderly,
with a lower value of 0.84±0.45 (10^9/L) in the risk group, but a normal range of 0.8-3.5 (10^9/L).
However, the early count of lymphocytes was not an independent factor affecting severe or critical
events, which may be related to the characteristics of the elderly. But, studies have suggested that
the dynamic expression of lymphocyte percentage can predict the severity of COVID-19 [27].Later
cases could be added, and lymphocyte counts at different stages were used to evaluate the severity
of COVID-19 and verify whether there was a statistical difference.
D-dimer was also an independent factor affecting severe or critical events of COVID 19 in the
elderly. In terms of this indicator, recent studies have reported that the significant increase of
D-dimer is associated with the poor prognosis of severe new coronary pneumonia [28, 29]. The
death cases of COVID-19 had significant increase of plasma D-dimer [29]. Moreover, in adults with
community-active pneumonia, increased plasma D-dimer was associated with increased
inflammatory response, admission to intensive care and 30-day mortality, and was superior to
C-reactive protein and procalcitonin in predicting admission to intensive care and 30-day mortality
[30]. All of the above reflected the value of D-dimer and supported that the increase of D-dimer was
an independent factor affecting the severe or critical events of COVID 19 in the elderly. Similarly,
the severe or critical events of D-dimer>0.65 mg/L in elderly COVID -19 were also evaluated by
ROC curve with high predictive efficacy, with high sensitivity(81.0%) and negative predictive
value(93.0%), respectively.
In order to consider the effects of novel coronavirus on immunity and coagulation in elderly
patients, we can combined use of D-dimer level and CD4 cell count, to evaluate the occurrence of

severe or critical events. The combined use of the both had high inferential efficiency on the
occurrence of risk events in the elderly COVID-19, there were respective significant contributions
on the evaluation index, with high sensitivity (90.5%), specificity (91.0%), positive predictive value
(65.2%) or negative predictive value (95.6%).
Based on the results of this study and the close correlation between autoimmune disorders and
coagulation abnormalities and thrombosis events in patients[31], we propose a hypothesis: CD4
cells and D-dimer may trigger in the progression of the elderly COVID-19; novel coronavirus may
act on CD4 cells through ACE2 receptor, and affect CD4 cells count reduction; the level of D-dimer
can be increased by immune imbalance and inflammatory response in the elderly. In the early stage
of the disease, when the number of CD4 cells decreases to a certain number and the D-dimer
increase to a certain level, the risk event trend of COVID-19 will be continuously affected. Therefore,
the immune imbalance, cytokine disorder and multi-organ damage can be continuously induced in
the state of low cellular immunity and high coagulation to a certain extent, leading to the severe or
critical events of COVID-19.
The highlight of this study was the elderly COVID-19 as the research object, because the elderly
population has its own characteristics with risk factors of the severe or critical events [2, 4, 6]. It was
found that D-dimer and CD4 cells were independent factors affecting the severe or critical events of
COVID-19 in the elderly, and the indicators had important clinical application value. However, the
proportion of comorbidities and their prognostic analysis were significantly different from the other
studies [5, 6]. which would be related to the fact that the samples of this study were all imported
domestic cases and regional prevention and control policies. The advantage of this study lied in the
in-depth analysis of all the research data; the independent influencing factors of the elderly
COVID-19 risk events in the elderly were identified, and the application value was evaluated; the
study population were all imported domestic cases, and the results were stable. One of the
limitations is that data on novel coronavirus load were not available.

COVID-19 risk factors in the elderly have their characteristics. The decrease of CD4 cell count
and the increase of D-dimer level in the early stage of the disease are independent influencing
factors for the occurrence of severe or critical events. The application of D-dimer, CD4 cells and the
combination have important risk prediction efficacy for the severe or critical illness of the elderly
with COVID-19.
