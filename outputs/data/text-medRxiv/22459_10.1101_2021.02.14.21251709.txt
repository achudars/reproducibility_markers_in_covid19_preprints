ABSTRACT
Background The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 engages the human angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to enter host cells, and neutralizing antibodies are effective at
blocking this interaction to prevent infection. Widespread application of this important marker of
protective immunity is limited by logistical and technical challenges associated with live virus
methods and venous blood collection. To address this gap, we validated an immunoassaybased method for quantifying neutralization of the spike-ACE2 interaction in a single drop of
capillary whole blood, collected on filter paper as a dried blood spot (DBS) sample.
Methods Samples are eluted overnight and incubated in the presence of spike antigen and
ACE2 in a 96-well solid phase plate. Competitive immunoassay with electrochemiluminescent
label is used to quantify neutralizing activity. The following measures of assay performance
were evaluated: dilution series of confirmed positive and negative samples, agreement with
results from matched DBS-serum samples, analysis of results from DBS samples with known
COVID-19 status, and precision (intra-assay percent coefficient of variation; %CV) and reliability
(inter-assay; %CV).
Results Dilution series produced the expected pattern of dose-response. Agreement
between results from serum and DBS samples was high, with concordance correlation = 0.991.
Analysis of three control samples across the measurement range indicated acceptable levels of
precision and reliability. Median % neutralization was 46.9 for PCR confirmed convalescent
COVID-19 samples and 0.1 for negative samples.
Conclusions Large-scale testing is important for quantifying neutralizing antibodies that can
provide protection against COVID-19 in order to estimate the level of immunity in the general
population. DBS provides a minimally-invasive, low cost alternative to venous blood collection,
and this scalable immunoassay-based method for quantifying neutralization of the spike-ACE2
interaction can be used as a surrogate for virus-based assays to expand testing across a wide
range of settings and populations.

INTRODUCTION
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a potentially deadly infectious disease that is
caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)1. Serological
testing is an important part of the effort to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, and detects the
presence of antibodies in blood samples from exposed individuals 2. Antibodies are detectable
3-10 days after infection, and anti-SARS-CoV IgG antibodies persist for at least 5 months after
the resolution of symptoms 3,4. Neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) are of particular importance
because they can bind to viral proteins and inhibit entry into host cells, thereby preventing
infection 5. For SARS-CoV-2, the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the surface spike protein
engages the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to gain entry into host
cells, and anti-SARS-CoV-2 NAbs are effective at blocking this interaction and preventing viral
entry 6,7.
Serological testing has been widely used to identify individuals who have been exposed
to SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, due to their functional role in blocking viral entry, the
measurement of NAbs provides information on the magnitude of immune response to prior
infection and the level of protection against re-infection 8. In addition, NAbs can be used to
assess conferred immunity through vaccination, as neutralizing antibody response is frequently
used as a correlate of protection following vaccination, including vaccination against SARSCoV-2 9,10.
Conventional methods for measuring neutralizing activity require live virus—either a nonreplicating virus with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein expressed from a viral vector
(“pseudotyped virus” or “pseudovirus”) or replication-competent SARS-CoV-2. Either live virus
approach limits widespread application as the assays are time-consuming and require
specialized laboratory containment facilities. SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies can also be
quantified utilizing a surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT), which detects NAbs without live
virus and can be implemented with immunoassay techniques 6,11. The sVNT approach replicates
the virus-host interaction by incubating a blood sample with purified versions of viral spike
protein and human ACE2 receptor. Neutralizing antibodies prevent the spike protein from
binding to ACE2, and the degree of inhibition is quantified in a competitive immunoassay to
indicate the level of NAbs in the sample. There is a high level of agreement in results derived
from sVNT and live virus methods, and the specificity and sensitivity of sVNT are comparable to
conventional neutralization tests 11,12.
While sVNT provides a more streamlined alternative to conventional assays for
neutralizing antibodies, the use of venous blood limits the screening of large numbers of people
in non-clinical settings due to the costs and logistical constraints associated with collecting,
processing, and transporting venous blood. There is an alternative in finger stick dried blood
spot (DBS) sampling13. With DBS, a lancet is used to prick the finger, and up to five drops of
blood are placed on filter paper, where it dries. In comparison with venipuncture, DBS sampling
is low-cost, reduces biohazard risk during sample collection and transport, and it affords the
possibility of self-sampling, with participants collecting their own blood and returning the sample
through the mail, without the need for a cold chain or special handling14. Due to these
advantages, DBS sampling is the foundation of neonatal screening programs in the US, and it is
increasingly applied as a minimally-invasive alternative to venipuncture in community- and
population-based health research, including several applications in infectious disease
epidemiology 15,16.
We recently validated a protocol for quantifying anti-RBD SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in
DBS samples that is being used in several community-based seroprevalence studies 17-19. Here,
we describe a method for quantifying neutralization of spike-ACE2 binding in DBS samples.

The protocol is relatively short (<4 hours), can be implemented with widely available laboratory
infrastructure, and can be scaled up for high-throughput processing. We describe the assay
protocol, as well as results demonstrating performance characteristics and the validity of
measuring SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in DBS samples.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The DBS method is based on modifications to a commercially available protocol (Meso
Scale Diagnostics V-PLEX SARS-CoV-2 Panel 2 Kit; K15386U-2), designed for the multiplex
capture of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in serum on the Meso Scale Diagnostics QuickPlex SQ 120
Imager. This method utilizes a 96-well solid phase plate with antigens printed as arrays in
discrete spots within each well, an electrochemiluminescent detection system, and a
competitive binding protocol. The assay principle is as follows: Diluted sample is incubated in
plate wells in the presence of ACE2 conjugated with an electrochemiluminescent label;
neutralizing antibodies, if present, compete with conjugated ACE2 for viral antigen binding sites;
after separation an electrical impulse generates light in proportion to bound ACE2 at each spot
in the array; the signal is negatively proportional to the concentration of neutralizing antibodies
in the sample, and % neutralization is calculated as follows: % neutralization = 100 x 1 (sample signal/negative control signal).
Serum assay protocol
Serum samples were quantified per manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, the assay plate
included two SARS-CoV-2 antigens coated to the bottom of each well: spike and RBD. The
nucleocapsid antigen is also available in the plate, but does not bind ACE2 and is not a target
for neutralizing antibodies; it was therefore not used in this protocol. The assay plate was
blocked for 30 minutes and washed. Serum samples were diluted (1:40) and 25uL were
transferred to each well. The plate was then incubated at room temperature for 60 minutes
while shaking at 700rpm, followed by the addition of SULFO-TAGTM conjugated ACE2, and
continued incubation with shaking for 60 minutes. The plate was washed, 150 μL MSD GOLDTM
Read Buffer B was added to each well, and the plate was read using the QuickPlex SQ 120
Imager. Mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) values were generated for each sample. Sample
diluent was used as the negative control for the calculation of % neutralization.
DBS assay protocol
Three levels of DBS control material (low, mid, and high neutralization antibodies) were
manufactured by diluting neutralizing monoclonal antibody to SARS CoV-2 spike (provided with
kit) in assay diluent, mixing with an equal volume of washed red blood cells, then transferring to
filter paper (Whatman 903 Protein Saver Card, #10534612) in 60 uL drops using a pipette
(Rainin pipet lite LTS L100)13. A DBS negative control sample was made with the same
procedure, using assay diluent.
To begin the protocol, DBS samples and DBS controls were eluted overnight in a nonbinding 96-well plate (Corning 96 Well TC-Treated Microplate; Sigma #CLS3599). One 5.0 mm
disc was removed using a pneumatic hole punch (Analytical Sales and Services #327500,
Flanders, NJ), 100 uL assay diluent were added to each well, and the plate was covered and
incubated overnight at 4°C.
The following day, the elution plate was from removed from the refrigerator and rotated
for one hour at 300 rpm. The MULTI-SPOT® 96-well assay plate was blocked for 30 min at
room temperature, washed, and 25 uL of each sample were transferred from the elution plate to
the assay plate in duplicate. The assay plate was then incubated at room temperature for 60

minutes while shaking at 700rpm, followed by the addition of 25 uL of SULFO-TAGTM
conjugated ACE2, and continued incubation with shaking for 60 minutes. The plate was
washed, 150 μL MSD GOLDTM Read Buffer B was added to each well, and the plate was read
using a MESO® QuickPlex SQ 120MM Imager. Mean MFI values were generated for each
sample, and the DBS negative control was used to calculate % neutralization for each sample.
Evaluation of assay performance
The following aspects of DBS assay performance were evaluated: dilution series of
confirmed positive and negative samples, agreement with results from serum samples, analysis
of results from DBS samples with known COVID-19 status, and precision and reliability.. Assay
precision, or intra-assay variability, was calculated as the percent coefficient of variation (CV;
SD/mean x 100) for 10 replicates each of DBS control samples with high, medium, and low
levels of neutralizing antibodies. Reliability, or inter-assay variability, was assessed by running
the three DBS control samples across ten separate assay plates.
Agreement between results from DBS and serum samples was evaluated in a set of
matched samples collected from n=20 convalescent individuals with PCR positive confirmed
cases of COVID-19, and n=10 negative samples collected in early 2019, before the pandemic.
Immediately following collection of venous blood, five drops of whole blood (60 uL each) were
transferred by pipet to filter paper (Whatman #903, GE Healthcare, Pascataway, NJ), allowed to
dry overnight, and then stacked and stored at -30ºC. DBS samples with known SARS-CoV-2
seropositivity status were drawn from an ongoing community-based seroprevalence study and
collected between June 24 and November 11, 2020, with serostatus determined using a SARSCoV-2 anti-RBD IgG immunoassay validated for use with DBS 17,18. These samples were
categorized as seronegative (n=38), seropositive with PCR confirmed COVID-19 (n=51), and
seropositive with no PCR test (n=32). An additional set of negative DBS samples, collect in
early 2019, were also assayed (n=27). All samples were de-identified and all research activities
were implemented under protocols approved by the institutional review board at Northwestern
University (#STU00212371, #STU00212457 and #STU00212472).
All samples were analyzed in duplicate using the DBS and serum protocols, as
described above. Passing-Bablok regression models and difference plots were used to
evaluate patterns of agreement in results 24-27. Statistical analyses were implemented with
Stata/SE (version 15.1 for Windows, StataCorp, College Station, TX). Results are presented for
neutralization of the spike-ACE2 interaction only. Results for neutralization of RBD-ACE2
interaction were highly correlated with spike (Spearman R = 0.90) and were not considered
further as part of this validation.
RESULTS
Analysis of DBS samples from convalescent, PCR confirmed cases of COVID-19
demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 Spike-ACE2 interaction can be neutralized in a dosedependent manner (Figure 1). There was no evidence of neutralization in pre-pandemic
negative DBS samples. Results from a set of matched DBS and serum samples, including
confirmed positive and negative cases, indicated a high level of agreement in % neutralization
across the two sample types (concordance correlation = 0.991) (Figure 2). A Bland-Altman
difference plot indicated that the pattern of association was linear and consistent across the
measurement range, with relatively tight 95% limits of agreement (bias = 0.63 % inhibition;
lower limit = -8.4; upper limit = 9.6) (Figure 3).
Repeat analysis of three Nab-positive DBS control samples indicated a high level of
precision and reliability for the assay, particularly at higher levels of neutralization of the spike4

ACE2 interaction. Levels of intra-assay variability for high, mid, and low Nab positive DBS
control samples were 0.2, 3.2, and 14.9 %CV, respectively. Inter-assay variability was 0.7, 5.7,
and 14.1 %CV, respectively.
Analysis of DBS samples with known COVID-19 serostatus produced the expected
pattern of results, with the highest levels of neutralization in samples from convalescent, PCR
confirmed cases (Figure 4). Median neutralization in this group was 46.9%, but values spanned
the entire measurement range. All negative samples (seronegative and pre-pandemic) showed
low levels of neutralization, with % neutralization <14%. Median % neutralization was 0.1% for
negative samples, and mean neutralization was 0.0% (SD=6.5). Using 3SD above the mean as
a criterion, the cut-off value for differentiating negative from positive samples is 19.5%.
Neutralizing activity that blocks spike-ACE2 interaction in this assay above this threshold was
detected in only 18.8% of samples collected from individuals who tested seropositive for SARSCoV-2 anti-RBD IgG but who did not have symptoms that led to a clinical diagnosis of COVID19. Among confirmed PCR positive cases, 68.6% were above the cut-off.
DISCUSSION
Serological testing is critical for tracking the spread of SARS-CoV-2, and for identifying
the factors that influence transmission, immunity, and vulnerability to severe infection. High
rates of asymptomatic and mild infection underscore the need for approaches that are
amenable to large-scale application. Testing for neutralizing antibodies may be particularly
important at this stage in the pandemic, as it can inform our understanding of immunity among
vaccinated individuals and those previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2. We have validated a
method for quantifying neutralization of the SARS-CoV-2 spike-ACE2 interaction in a single
drop of blood, collected on filter paper following a simple finger stick, in order to facilitate remote
sampling and large-scale testing of neutralizing antibodies.
Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using DBS samples for serological testing of
SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies with a competitive immunoassay that quantifies inhibition
of the spike-ACE2 interaction. Neutralization is high in samples from PCR confirmed
convalescent cases of COVID-19, and low in samples that are known to be negative for SARSCoV-2. We document dose-dependent reduction in neutralization in dilutions of samples with
high initial neutralization, as well as close correspondence in results from DBS in comparison
with matched serum samples. The method also produces results that are precise and reliable,
which is particularly important for studies with large numbers of samples assayed across
multiple plates. Furthermore, the method can be implemented in ubiquitous BSL2 laboratories,
without the specialized facilities and biohazard risks associated with live virus methods.
Finger stick DBS sampling is relatively low-cost and minimally-invasive, and samples
can be self-collected in the home 14,15. In addition, antibodies remain stable in DBS for several
weeks at room temperature, and can be sent in the mail as nonregulated, exempt materials 20.
The possibility of remote serological testing, with large numbers of people, may be particularly
advantageous when clinical resources are stretched thin and people are being encouraged to
stay home. A disadvantages of DBS includes the small volume of blood in comparison with
venipuncture. Other potential issues, depending on the application, are variable quality of selfcollected samples, and the possibility that samples may be delayed or lost during shipment by
mail.
Recent studies have documented neutralization antibody responses to vaccination and
natural infection with SARS-CoV-2 8,21,22, and prior research with other viruses suggests that
neutralizing antibodies are excellent indicators of protective immunity 9. More widespread,

community-based testing is important for determining the level of neutralizing antibodies that
provide protection against COVID-19, and for estimating the level and duration of immunity in
the general population—and subpopulations of particular interest—following multiple waves of
community transmission 23. Testing for neutralization antibodies can also play a role in
evaluating the effectiveness of vaccines, and heterogeneity in vaccine responses across
individuals 8. Our quantitative DBS-based assay for neutralizing antibodies can help advance
research and surveillance in these important areas.
