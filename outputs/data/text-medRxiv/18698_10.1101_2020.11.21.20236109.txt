Abstract
Quantifying severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in clinical samples
is crucial for assessing the infectivity of coronavirus disease 2019 and the efficacy of antiviral
drugs. Here, we describe a digital warm-start CRISPR (WS-CRISPR) assay for sensitive
quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples. The WS-CRISPR assay combines lowtemperature reverse transcription dual-priming mediated isothermal amplification (RT-DAMP) and
CRISPR-Cas12a-based detection in one-pot, attributed to the mediation role by pyrophosphatase
and phosphorothioated primers. The WS-CRISPR assay is initiated at above 50 °C and
overcomes undesired premature target amplification at room temperature, enabling accurate
digital nucleic acid quantification. By targeting SARS-CoV-2’s nucleoprotein gene, digital WSCRISPR assay is able to detect down to 5 copies/μl SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the chip within 90
minutes. It is clinically validated by quantitatively determining 32 clinical swab samples and three
clinical saliva samples, showing 100% agreement with RT-PCR results. Moreover, the digital WSCRISPR assay has been demonstrated to directly detect SARS-CoV-2 in heat-treated saliva
samples without RNA extraction, showing high tolerance to inhibitors. Thus, the digital WSCRISPR method, as a sensitive and reliable CRISPR assay, facilitates accurate SARS-CoV-2
detection toward digitized quantification.

Main
Since firstly emerged in December 20191, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) as the causing agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread
worldwide, resulting in over one million deaths2. As of now, fully validated COVID-19 vaccines
and antiviral drugs are still unavailable. Therefore, sensitive and accurate quantification of the
SARS-CoV-2 plays a crucial role in assessing the infectivity and controlling the ongoing pandemic.
To quantify SARS-CoV-2, TaqMan probe-based reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) is frequently used as a gold standard method due to its high sensitivity and specificity3,
4
. However, it greatly depends on expensive real-time quantitative PCR instruments and its
quantitation accuracy is highly associated with well-designed TaqMan probes, not suitable for
small clinics or community health settings. Alternatively, some isothermal nucleic acid
amplification methods have been developed to rapidly detect SARS-CoV-2, such as reverse
transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) 5, 6, 7, reverse transcription
recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA)8, 9, reverse transcription recombinase-aided
amplification (RT-RAA)10, 11, and sensitive splint-based one-pot isothermal RNA detection
(SENSR)12. However, most of these isothermal amplification assays are either intended for the
qualitative detection or subjected to undesired nonspecific amplification signals (or false positive
signals).
As next-generation molecular diagnostics, nucleic acid detection based on clustered regularly
interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and its associated proteins (Cas nucleases)
possesses great prospects13. In CRISPR-Cas-based nucleic acid detection, target-specific
CRISPR RNA (crRNA) ensures high specific and reliable detection and Cas nucleases’ collateral
cleavage activity produces amplified fluorescence signals14, 15, 16. Currently, CRISPR-Cas12abased DETECTR (DNA Endonuclease-Targeted CRISPR Trans Reporter) system and CRISPRCas13a-based SHERLOCK (Specific High-sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter UnLOCKing) system
have been applied to detect SARS-CoV-217, 18. However, these assays are typically two-step
approaches in which RT-RPA or RT-LAMP, as separate target preampification step, is
indispensable. The transferring of amplified products potentially increases the risk of carry-over
contaminations and compilates the detection operation. To overcome this technical bottleneck,
our lab and Zhang’s lab developed all-in-one dual CRISPR-Cas12a (AIOD-CRISPR) assay 19 and
SHERLOCK testing in one pot (STOP) assay20 for SARS-CoV-2 detection, respectively. However,
these one-pot CRISPR assays are not quantitative. Recently, Yu’s lab has reported a digital
quantitative strategy based on RPA-based CRISPR assay (termed RADICA) for synthetic SARSCoV-2 RNA detection21. However, it is still a challenge to prevent undesired premature target
amplification and accurately quantify nucleic acid, since the RPA/RT-RPA can be initiated at room
temperature22, thereby potentially overestimating the initial target amount in the digital detection.
To minimize premature target amplification, the reaction mixture needs to be prepared on ice and
loaded into chips within one minute21, which complicates detection procedure and remains a
challenge in massive COVID-19 testing.
Here, we present, for the first time, a digital warm-start CRISPR (WS-CRISPR) assay for sensitive
quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical COVID-19 samples. The digital WS-CRISPR
assay is established through partitioning a one-pot WS-CRISPR reaction into sub-nanoliter
aliquots using QuantStudio 3D digital chips. The WS-CRISPR reaction combines low-temperature
reverse transcription dual-priming isothermal amplification (RT-DAMP)23 and CRISPR-Cas12abased fluorescence detection in a one-pot format and is efficiently initiated at above 50 °C,

thereby preventing premature target amplifications at room temperature and enabling accurate
digital quantification of nucleic acids. Through targeting the SARS-CoV-2’s nucleoprotein (N)
gene, digital WS-CRISPR assay is developed to quantitatively determine 32 clinical swab
samples and three clinical saliva samples. More importantly, digital WS-CRISPR assay is used
to directly detect SARS-CoV-2 in heat-treated saliva samples without need for RNA extraction.

Results
Overview of digital WS-CRISPR assay
As shown in Fig. 1a, one-pot WS-CRISPR reaction mixture is first prepared in one tube,
containing Cas12a-crRNA complex, six DAMP primers (two outer primers of FO and RO, two
inner primers of FI and RI, and two competition primers of FC and RC), nontarget single-stranded
DNA fluorophore-quencher (ssDNA-FQ) reporter, SuperScript IV reverse transcriptase, Bst DNA
polymerase, and SARS-CoV-2 RNA target. To achieve digital detection, the prepared reaction
mixture is distributed into a QuantStudio 3D digital chip (Thermo Fisher Scientific). This chip is
etched with 20,000 consistently-sized hexagon wells (max width of 60 μm) in a silicon substrate
and can partition the mixture into over ten thousand sub-nanoliter (~0.7 nL) microreactions. After
90-min incubation at 52 °C, the microreactions with target RNA indicate strong green fluorescence
(positive spots), whereas not in those without targets (negative spots). The target RNA can be
quantified through testing and counting the number of positive spots of the chips.
The WS-CRISPR assay combines low-temperature RT-DAMP with CRISPR-Cas12a detection in
one-pot. The DAMP developed in our lab is one variant of loop-mediated isothermal amplification
using a new primer design strategy23. Each inner primer of the DAMP is formed with two target
sites with a distance of below 40 nt and a pair of competition primers is added to mediate pairpriming strand extension (Fig. 1b). Our previous study23 has confirmed that the DAMP/RT-DAMP
has not only improved the detection sensitivity, but also generated ultralow nonspecific signals.
In the digital WS-CRISPR assay, six DAMP primers recognize six distinct sites in target
sequences to initiate self-priming and pair-priming (dual-priming) isothermal amplification, thus
producing multiple amplicons with closed loop structures. Simultaneously, Cas12a-cRNA
complex specifically binds the sites of the amplicons to activate Cas12a’s collateral cleavage
activity, thereby indiscriminately cleaving surrounding nontarget ssDNA-FQ reporter to generate
increased fluorescence. The ssDNA-FQ is a 5-cytosin nucleotide single-stranded DNA (5′CCCCC-3′) labeled with FAM (Fluorescein) at 5′ end and Iowa Black FQ quencher at 3′ end, and
is used in our assay due to its higher affinity to Cas12a24. Fluorescence is quenched via
resonance energy transfer in intact ssDNA-FQ reporters, but can be recovered after activated
Cas12a cleaves the reporters.

Fig. 1. Overview of digital WS-CRISPR assay. a, One-pot WS-CRISPR reaction mixture is first prepared
in one tube. After distributed into QuantStudio 3D digital chip, over ten thousand sub-nanoliter (~0.7 nL)
microreactions are isolated in microwells. When incubated at 52°C, each microreaction with SARS-CoV-2
RNA target undertakes WS-CRISPR reaction and generates strong green fluorescence (positive spots),
whereas not in those without target (negative spots). Scale bar is 300 μm. Through detecting and counting
the positive microreactions (or spots), SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be quantified based on the proportion of
positive spots. b, Working principle of one-pot WS-CRISPR assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection. The WSCRISPR reaction mixture contains Cas12a-crRNA complex, six DAMP primers (two outer primers of FO
and RO, two inner primers of FI and RI, and two competition primers of FC and RC), ssDNA-FQ reporter,
SuperScript IV reverse transcriptase, Bst DNA polymerase, and SARS-CoV-2 RNA in a one-pot format.

Optimization of WS-CRISPR assay
As of now, there still remains a challenge to directly couple LAMP or DAMP with CRISPR-Cas12a
detection in a one-pot format due to the significant difference in their reaction buffer compositions
and reaction temperature. For example, one of the major concerns is the concentration of Mg 2+.
The cleavage of Cas12a nucleases for both on-target and collateral activity is typically high-Mg 2+dependent25, 26, 27. To enable highly sensitive nucleic acid detection, two different Cas12a
nucleases were evaluated and compared at various Mg2+ concentrations. As shown Fig. 2a, when
reducing the Mg2+ concentration from 8 mM to 2 mM, the detection efficiency of the CRISPRCas12a dramatically decreases. Interestingly, the Cas12a from Recombinant Acidaminococcus
sp. BV3L6 (A.s. Cas12a) still has relatively high collateral cleavage activity at 2 mM Mg2+.
Whereas, 2 mM Mg2+ completely inhibits the activity of Cas12a from Lachnospiraceae bacterium
ND2006 (Lba Cas12a). Thus, A.s. Cas12a is used in our WS-CRISPR assay due to its tolerance
to low Mg2+ concentration. In addition, during isothermal amplification, primer extension by DNA
polymerase continuously consumes dNTPs and produces a large number of pyrophosphate ions
that can chelate Mg2+ to form magnesium pyrophosphate precipitate as the reaction byproduct
(Fig. 2b), thereby consuming a large amount of free Mg2+ and significantly reducing the collateral
cleavage activity of CRISPR-Cas12a nuclease. To this end, pyrophosphatase (PPase) is added
into the WS-CRISPR reaction system to degrade the magnesium pyrophosphate precipitate,

which releases free Mg2+ and maintains a constant Mg2+ concentration. As shown in
Supplementary Fig. 1, the optimal concentration of PPase is 0.2 U/μl in our WS-CRISPR assay.
Another concern in developing one-pot CRISPR assay is the significant difference of the optimal
reaction temperature between nucleic acid amplification and CRISPR-based detection. Most
Cas12a nucleases have an optimal activity at 37°C, but LAMP/DAMP powered by Bst DNA
polymerase typically requires a relatively high temperature of 60-65°C23, 28. To develop a one-pot
assay, phosphorothioated inner primers of FI and RI (Supplementary Table 1) were employed
in our WS-CRISPR assay to reduce the reaction temperature of isothermal amplification as
reported by Ellington’s lab29. Therefore, through supplementing PPase and employing
phosphorothioated inner primers, one-pot WS-CRISPR assay has been successfully developed
(Fig. 2c).
To achieve the best performance, we further optimize the one-pot WS-CRISPR reaction system
in terms of the concentrations of Mg2+, Bst DNA polymerase, and SuperScript IV reverse
transcriptase. As shown in Supplementary Figs. 2-4, the optimal concentrations are 0.2 U/μl
PPase, 2 mM Mg2+, 24 U/μl Bst DNA polymerase, and 2 U/μl SuperScript IV. In addition, several
different DNA polymerases were investigated and compared, including Bst DNA polymerase
(large fragment), Bst 2.0 DNA polymerase, Bst 3.0 DNA polymerase, GspSSD 2.0 DNA
polymerase, Bsm DNA polymerase (large fragment), IsoPol BST+ DNA polymerase, and IsoPol
SD+ DNA polymerase. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 5, the best DNA polymerase for our WSCRISPR is Bst DNA polymerase (large fragment). Furthermore, we assessed the effect of
reaction temperatures from 48 °C to 60 °C on the one-pot WS-CRISPR assay. Fig. 2d shows that
the optimal temperature of the WS-CRISPR assay is 52 °C and the reaction is initiated at above
50 °C. Therefore, our WS-CRISPR assay provides a warm-start nucleic acid detection and
circumvents undesired premature target amplification at room temperature, which is crucial to
developing a sensitive and reliable digital detection for nucleic acid quantification.

detection and endpoint fluorescence comparison of one-pot WS-CRISPR assay with PPase and/or PS
primers at 52°C. PS primers specifically denote two phosphorothioated inner primers of FI and RI and the
rest of primers are non-phosphorothioated. “w/o PS primers” means reactions with the nonphosphorothioated inner primers. Positive, the reaction with 5×104 copies/μl SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Three
replicates were run (n = 3). d, Effect of reaction temperature on one-pot WS-CRISPR assay. Positive 1 and

were conducted with the similar results. NTC, non-template control. Error bars represent the
means ± standard deviation (s.d.) from replicates. The statistical significance was analyzed using unpaired
two-tailed t-test.

As shown in Fig. 3a, the WS-CRISPR reaction is only initiated when all the components of the
RT-DAMP and CRISPR-Cas12a are mixed in one-pot. In addition, the specificity of WS-CRISPR
assay is evaluated by detecting SARS-CoV control, MERS-CoV, and Hs_RPP30 control. As
shown in Fig. 3b, the WS-CRISPR assay has a high specificity to detect SARS-CoV-2. By
detecting various concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, the WS-CRISPR assay is able to
detection down to 500 copies/μl SARS-CoV-2 RNA in sample (equivalently 50 copies/μl RNA in
the reaction) within 90 min (Fig. 3c). Furthermore, Fig. 3 demonstrates that the detection results
of the WS-CRISPR assay can be visually read out based on the fluorescence imaging of reaction
tubes under either LED blue light or UV light, enabling simple visual detection.
In summary, we successfully develop a one-pot warm-start CRISPR assay by combining the lowtemperature RT-DAMP and CRISPR-Cas12a-based fluorescence detection in a one-pot format.
It has high sensitivity and specificity for SARS-CoV-2 detection in both real-time fluorescence
monitoring and endpoint visual readout. Especially, the WS-CRISPR assay is typically initiated at
above 50°C, presenting the first report of one-pot warm-start CRISPR-Cas12a assay, which is
crucial to develop a digital CRISPR assay for accurate and reliable quantification of nucleic acids.

unpaired two-tailed t-test.

Development of digital WS-CRISPR assay
The digital WS-CRISPR assay is developed through partitioning the one-pot WS-CRISPR
reaction mixture into sub-nanoliter microreactions in the QuantStudio 3D digital chips. As shown
in Fig. 4a, a typical workflow of digital WS-CRISPR assay consists of RNA extraction from clinical
samples, one-pot CRISPR reaction mixture preparation, distribution of the reaction mixture into
the chip, and incubation at 52°C. First, the digital WS-CRISPR assays with various incubation
times (e.g., 10, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min) were investigated. As shown in Fig. 4b and 4c, a 90-min
incubation is enough for the digital WS-CRISPR assay to reach the maximum percentage of
positive spots.
To avoid overestimating the initial amount of target nucleic acid by digital detection, it is crucial to
prevent undesired premature target amplification during reagent preparation at room temperature.
For example, some DNA polymerization reactions (e.g., RPA) can be initiated at room
temperature22. To determine if there is any premature target amplification in our digital WSCRISPR assay, we set up various waiting times at room temperature during the reaction solution
preparation and distribution steps (Fig. 4d). For comparison, we also assess the digital detection
of our previously reported RT-AIOD-CRISPR assay, a one-pot RT-RPA-based CRISPR assay
(19). As shown in Fig. 4d, positive spots can clearly be observed as short as 10 min-waiting time
at room temperature in the digital RT-AIOD-CRISPR assay, confirming the premature target
amplification occurs, which is consistent to recent report with the RADICA assay in digital chips
by Yu’s lab (21). To minimize premature target amplification, they prepared reaction mixture on
ice and quickly distributed it into the chips (within 1 min)21. However, this complicates the assay’s
procedure and typically requires highly well-trained operators. On the contrary, no positive spots
are observed in our digital WS-CRISPR assay even after 720-min waiting time at room
temperature (Fig. 4d). Thus, our digital WS-CRISPR method provides a warm-start assay
strategy and enables a simple, sensitive, and reliable quantification of SARS-CoV-2.

digital chip for the SARS-CoV-2 detection with various incubation time (0, 10, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min) at

of positive spots comparison for the digital WS-CRISPR assays with various incubation time at 52°C.The
number of positive spots was counted by setting the same threshold in the ImageJ software. Percentages
of positive spots in each micrograph was calculated (n = 6). Error bars represent the means ± s.d. from
replicates. The statistical significance was analyzed using unpaired two-tailed t-test. d, Effect of various
waiting time at room temperature on digital WS-CRISPR assay and digital RT-AIOD-CRISPR assay during

RNA. NTC, non-template control. Scale bars are 300 μm. Each micrograph is a representative of six distinct
regions taken to cover about 2809 microreactions.

Next, specificity assay of the digital WS-CRISPR is carried out by testing non-SARS-CoV-2
nucleic acids. As shown in Fig. 5a, positive spots are observed in the chip loaded with the SARSCoV-2 positive control, whereas not for other non-target nucleic acids, such as SARS-CoV control,
MERS-CoV, and Hs_RPP30 control, which is consistent to the results of the tube-based bulk
reaction format (Fig. 3b). By testing various concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, the detection
sensitivity is investigated. As shown in Fig. 5b, digital WS-CRISPR assay is able to detect down
to 50 copies/μl SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the sample (equivalently 5 copies/μl RNA molecules in the
reaction), a 10-fold higher compared with the bulk WS-CRISPR assay in the tube format (Fig. 3c).
In addition, Fig. 5b also indicates that there is an excellent linear relationship (R2=0.9934)
between the concentration of targets (from 5×103 to 3×106 copies/μl) and the percentage of
positive spots. However, when plotting the number of positive spots in digital WS-CRISPR assays
according to the commonly used Poisson distribution30, we find that the target concentration
quantified by our digital WS-CRISPR assay is lower than that of the initial target added, likely
attributed to relatively low filling rate of microwells in the digital chip. In our digital WS-CRISPR
assay, we used commercially available QuantStudio digital chip that is specially designed for
digital PCR/RT-PCR assay. The WS-CRISPR reaction system has a distinct wettability behavior
on the digital chip due to the different reaction components. We will explore other digital chips
(e.g., Clarity™ digital chip21) to test our digital WS-CRISPR assay in the future. Nonetheless, our
digital WS-CRISPR has the capability of accurately quantifying targets based on a standard curve.

assays (n = 3). Each micrograph is a representative of six distinct regions taken to cover about 2809
microreactions. Scale bars are 300 μm. Error bars represent the means ± s.d. from replicates.

Clinical validation of digital WS-CRISPR assay
To validate the clinical utility of the digital WS-CRISPR assay, we detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA
extracted from 32 clinical swab samples and three clinical saliva samples. For comparison, an inhome RT-qPCR assay using the U.S. CDC-approved SARS-CoV-2 N1 gene’s primers and probes
(provided by Integrated DNA Technologies) were set up as the parallel experiment. As shown in
Fig. 6a, 12 positive samples and positive control are consistently detected and identified by digital
WS-CRISPR assays, while all negative samples show negative signals, showing a 100%
agreement with that of RT-qPCR method. Fig. 6b shows the determined concentrations of SARSCoV-2 RNA in the 12 positive samples and the positive control by digital WS-CRISPR and RTqPCR methods. The averaged viral loading was quantified with the range from 1.4×104 to 2.3×106
copies/μl, showing similar order of magnitude as those determined by RT-qPCR. However, Fig.
6b also indicates that digital WS-CRISPR cannot quantify the sample 12 and 19 with larger Cq
values (Cq = 26.09 and 35.34) in RT-qPCR assay, likely attributed to its high limitation of
quantitation (Fig. 5c). Despite it, the digital WS-CRISPR assay is able to quantify the SARS-CoV2 RNA extracted from both clinical swab and saliva samples, showing a comparable performance
with conventional RT-qPCR method. In addition, our digital WS-CRISPR method is the first digital
CRISPR assay that is clinically validated by using clinical samples.

Direct SARS-CoV-2 detection in saliva samples by digital WS-CRISPR assay
Recent research showed that saliva sampling is an attractive alternative to swab sampling in
SARS-CoV-2 detection due to its simplicity, convenience and non-invasive nature 31. Especially,
saliva samples can be self-collected by patients themselves, avoiding direct interaction between
health care workers and patients. Given this, we investigated whether our digital WS-CRISPR
assay can directly be adapted to detect SARS-CoV-2 in crude saliva samples without RNA
extraction step. As shown in Fig. 7a, each saliva sample contains 90% (v/v) of human saliva
obtained from healthy individual, 0%-10% (v/v) of spiked heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 from BEI
Resources (Catalog # NR-52350), and 1× inactivation reagent developed by Rabe and Cepko 7.
After heated at 95°C for 5 min, 1.5 μl of the saliva samples was directly added into the digital WSCRISPR reaction system. As shown in Fig. 7b, the digital WS-CRISPR assay is successfully able
to detect the SARS-CoV-2 spiked in the saliva samples without need for RNA extraction and
purification, exhibiting high tolerance to potential inhibitors in saliva samples due to reaction
partitioning. Thus, this interesting finding suggests that our digital WS-CRISPR assay has the
potential to directly detect SARS-CoV-2 from crude clinical saliva specimens through simple
heating treatment, facilitating rapid and early molecular diagnostics of COVID-19 infection.

Discussion
In this study, we proposed a digital WS-CRISPR-Cas12a assay for sensitive quantitative detection
of SARS-CoV-2 from clinical samples. We took advantage of a newly established one-pot warmstart CRISPR reaction combining a low-temperature RT-DAMP and CRISPR-Cas12a-based
detection. To couple these two different reaction systems into one-pot, pyrophosphatase is added
to maintain a constant Mg2+ concentration by degrading the magnesium pyrophosphate byproduct.
In addition, phosphorothioated inner primers are used to mediate efficient reverse transcription
isothermal amplification at relatively low-temperature such as 52°C. Through partitioning the onepot reaction mixture into sub-nanoliter microreactions using QuantStudio 3D digital chips, we
successfully develop a digital CRISPR assay for sensitive and reliable quantification of SARSCoV-2.
Compared to previously reported CRISPR-based nucleic acid assays 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, our digital WSCRISPR assay offers several remarkable advantages. First, our WS-CRISPR assay is the first
demonstration of one-pot CRISPR assay by combining Bst DNA polymerase-based reverse

transcription isothermal amplification with CRISPR-Cas12a detection, not relying on CRISPRCas12b that requres higher reaction temperature (e.g., 60-65 °C) and longer crRNA (> 100 nt) 32,
33
. Second, digital WS-CRISPR assay is typically initiated at an elevated temperature (e.g., above
50°C), thoroughly addressing the challenge of undesired premature target amplification in digital
detection. Third, digital WS-CRISPR assay has high detection specificity and 10-fold higher
sensitivity than tube-based bulk assay format. By targeting the SARS-CoV-2’s N gene, digital WSCRISPR assay is able to quantify down to 5 copies/μl SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the chip. Fourth,
digital WS-CRISPR assay can quantify the SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples, benefiting assessing
the COVID-19 infectivity and the efficacy of antiviral drugs. Last, our digital WS-CRISPR assay
shows high tolerance to inhibitors and can directly detect SARS-CoV-2 in crude saliva samples
without need for RNA extraction, which does not only facilitate the COVID-19 diagnosis, but also
lowers the infection risk in health workers without directly sampling from patients.
These advantages notwithstanding, new digital chip needs to be further explored for digital WSCRISPR assay in the future, enabling absolute quantitative of nucleic acids. In addition, although
our digital WS-CRISPR assay uses relatively expensive fluorescence microscopy for
fluorescence image, smartphone-based portable fluorescence microscopy can become the
alternative to achieve onsite quantitative detection34, 35, 36. Of note, digital WS-CRISPR opens a
new exploration for CRISPR-base nucleic acid quantitative detection. For example, although RTDAMP is only used in this study, other isothermal methods are also applicable with our proposed
strategies, such as RT-LAMP, reverse transcription isothermal multiple-self-matching-initiated
amplification (RT-IMSA)37, and reverse transcription cross-priming amplification (RT-CPA) 38. As
the first clinically validated digital CRISPR assay, our digital WS-CRISPR assay provides a
reliable, sensitive and straightforward SARS-CoV-2 quantitative detection.

Design of primers and crRNA
Six DAMP primers and one CRISPR-Cas12a’s crRNA were designed to target seven distinct sites
in the 173 bp SARS-CoV-2 N gene fragment with the location from 28769 to 28941 in the viral
genome (GenBank accession MW202218.1). The selected primer or crRNA recognition sites are
highly conserved based on the GISAID-provided genomic epidemiology of hCoV-19 for 3564
genomes sampled between Dec 2019 and Nov 2020 (as of Nov 11, 2020.
https://www.gisaid.org/epiflu-applications/phylodynamics/). The DAMP primers can be manually
designed using the OligoAnalyzer Tool (https://www.idtdna.com/pages) and the PrimerExplorer
(http://primerexplorer.jp/e/) according to previously reported design principle23. Also, they can be
designed using the online DAMP primer design platform developed by our lab
(https://github.com/xuzhiheng001/DAMP-Design). CRISPR-Cas12a’s crRNA targeting the middle
site of DAMP region (Fig. 1) was also designed using the OligoAnalyzer Tool and its sequence
was checked against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV gene sequences. Primers, crRNA, ssDNA-FQ
reporter, and SARS-CoV-2 N DNA fragments were synthesized from Integrated DNA
Technologies (Coralville, IA). All the sequence information of the used primers and crRNAs has
been listed in Supplementary Table 1.

One-pot WS-CRISPR assay
One-pot WS-CRISPR assay system was prepared separately as Component A and B.
Component A consisted of 1× isothermal amplification buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM KCl, 10
mM (NH4)2SO4, 2 mM MgSO4, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, and pH = 8.8 at 25°C), 2 U/μl SuperScript
IV reverse transcriptase, 50 mM taurine, 1 U/μl invertase, 0.01 mg/ml BSA, 0.4 mM each of dNTPs,
0.2 μM FO primer, 0.2 μM RO primer, 1.6 μM PS-FI primer, 1.6 μM PS-RI primer, 1.6 μM FC
primer, 1.6 μM RC primer, 10 μM ssDNA-FQ, 20 ng/μl ET SSB, 24 U/μl Bst DNA polymerase
(large fragment), 0.2 U/μl PPase, and 1 U/μl RNase inhibitor. Component B contained 1.28 μM
A.s. Cas12a (Ultra) and 1.2 μM DAMP-crRNA (Supplementary Table 1). All the indicated
concentrations were calculated based on the finally assembled reaction system. In a typical 15μl assay, 12.5 μl Component A was first mixed with 1.5 μl of the target solution and then
supplemented with 1.0 μl Component B. The assembled reaction mixture was then incubated at
52°C for 90 min in the Bio-Rad CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Hercules, CA)
for real-time fluorescence detection. After incubation, the tubes were placed in the Maestrogen
UltraSlim LED blue light illuminator (Pittsburgh, PA) or the Bio-Rad ChemiDoc MP Imaging
System with its built-in UV channel (Hercules, CA) for endpoint visual detection. The endpoint
fluorescence was the determined raw fluorescence subtracting the averaged raw fluorescence of
non-template control reaction. Specificity assay was investigated by using the control plasmids
containing the complete N gene from SARS-CoV-2_PC, SARS-CoV control, MERS-CoV control,
and Hs_RPP30_PC. Sensitivity assay was conducted by testing serially diluted SARS-CoV-2
RNA (Twist Bioscience) in water with concentrations of 5×105, 5×104, 5×103, 5×102, and 5×101

copies/μl. CRISPR-Cas12a-based detection, namely trans-cleavage assay was incubated at
37°C for 40 min and performed in a solution containing 1× isothermal amplification buffer, 0.32
μM A.s. Cas12a, 0.32 μM DAMP-crRNA, 1.0 μM synthetic SARS-CoV-2 N DNA fragment, and
1.0 μM ssDNA-FQ reporter.

Digital WS-CRISPR assay
The reaction system for digital WS-CRISPR assay was the same as that in the tube-based bulk
reaction mentioned above. The procedure of digital WS-CRISPR assay was modified based on
the operational workflow for QuantStudio 3D digital PCR (Quick Reference Manual. Thermo
Fisher Scientific). Briefly, a 15-μl digital WS-CRISPR reaction solution was first prepared in a tube
by mixing Component A, B and the sample. Then, the reaction solution was loaded into the
QuantStudio 3D digital PCR chip (version 2), followed by applying the lid, loading the immersion
fluid, and sealing the chip. This step can be finished by using the QuantStudio 3D digital PCR
Chip Loader (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Afterwards, the sealed chip was placed in ProFlex 2× Flat
PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 90-min incubation at 52°C. After incubation, the chip
was taken out for the examination using a ZEISS Axio Observer fluorescence microscopy
connected with ZEISS Axio Cam 305 and X-Cite 120Q fluorescence lamp illumination. For each
chip’s microscopy, the same parameters were set up including 5× magnification objective, 10×
magnification eyepiece, 700 ms exposure time, 2.1 gamma value, and 2000 white value. Six
distinct regions without overlapping areas were randomly captured by the microscopy to cover
about 2809 microreactions. The number of positive spots was counted by using the ImageJ
software.
The
step-by-step
operation
is
described
below:
Image>Type
(8bit)>Edit>Invert>Image>Adjust
(Threshold:
0
and
245)>Apply>Analyze>Analyze
Particles>Distribution>List. In the list, the count for over 0.02 bin start was enrolled and summed
up.
Similarly, specificity assay of the digital WS-CRISPR assay was performed by testing the control
plasmids mentioned above and sensitivity was evaluated by testing serially diluted SARS-CoV-2
RNA (Twist Bioscience) in water with concentrations of 5×105, 5×104, 5×103, 5×102, 5×101 and
5×100 copies/μl, as well as 3×106 copies/μl SARS-CoV-2 RNA extracted from saliva sample.
SARS-CoV-2 in each clinical sample was quantified using the calibration curve of digital WSCRISPR by applying the averaged percentage of positive spots in six micrographs. Direct SARSCoV-2 detection in saliva samples by digital WS-CRISPR assays were assessed through testing
five saliva mock samples. The reaction system and procedure were the same as described above,
just replacing the target RNA solution with 1.5 μl of heat-treated saliva sample solution at 95 °C
for 5 min. The saliva mock samples (400 μl) were prepared by adding 1× inactivation reagent
(0.0115 N NaOH, 1.0 mM EDTA, and 1.0 mM TCEP-HCl), 360 μl human saliva, and various
volume percentages (0%, 1%, 2.5%, 5%, and 10%) of heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2.

Real-time quantitative RT-PCR assay
Real-time quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qCPR) assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection was carried out
according to U.S. CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic
Panel (https://www.fda.gov/media/134922/download) with minor modifications. A typical RTqPCR reaction system included 2 U/μl SuperScript IV reverse transcriptase, 1× QuantStudio
master mix (Catalog # A26358), 0.5 μM nCOV_N1 forward primer, 0.5 μM nCOV_N1 reverse
primer, 0.125 μM nCOV_N1 probe, and 1.5 μl of the target solution. The thermal cycler protocol
consisted of Stage 1 (2.0 min at 25°C), Stage 2 (15.0 min at 50°C), Stage 3 (2.0 min at 95°C) and
Stage 4 (40 cycles of 3.0 s at 95°C and 30 s at 55°C). The capture point of fluorescence was set

at 55°C in Stage 4. Real-time quantitative analysis was performed in the Bio-Rad CFX96 Touch
Real-Time PCR Detection System (Hercules, CA). Through testing serially diluted SARS-CoV-2
RNA (Twist Bioscience) with concentrations of 5×105, 5×104, 5×103, and 5×102 copies/μl, a fourpoint calibration curve was plotted based on the relationship between Cq value and the log of
target concentration (Supplementary Fig. 6). On the basis of this curve, SARS-CoV-2 in each
clinical sample was quantified by loading the determined Cq value.

Statistics and reproducibility
GraphPad Software Prism 8.0.1 was used to plot real-time fluorescence curves, analyze linear
regression, and verify statistical significance between two assay groups. The unpaired twotailed t-test was made with the p value < 0.05 as the threshold for defining significance. For
endpoint imaging of the chip using fluorescence microscopy, six distinct regions without
overlapping areas were randomly taken to cover about 2809 microreactions. Unless otherwise
specified, each image for visual detection or micrograph for chip testing is a representative of at
least three independent experiments. To plot the linear relationship between percentage of
positive spots and concentration of targets in digital WS-CRISPR, total positive spots in all the six
micrographs were used and three chips were taken to run three independent assays. Clinical
sample testing by both digital WS-CRISPR and RT-qPCR assays was repeatedly conducted at
three times to ensure the data accuracy.
