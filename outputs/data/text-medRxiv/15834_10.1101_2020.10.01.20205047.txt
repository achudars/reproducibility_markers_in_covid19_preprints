Traditional contact tracing for COVID-19 tests the direct contacts of those who test positive

7

even if the contacts do not show any symptom. But, why should the testing stop at direct

8

contacts, and not test secondary, tertiary contacts or even contacts further down? The ques-

9

tion arises because by the time an infected individual is tested the infection starting from him

10

may have infected a chain of individuals. One deterrent in testing long chains of individuals

11

right away may be that it substantially increases the testing load, or does it? We investigate

12

the costs and benefits of testing the contact chain of an individual who tests positive. For

13

this investigation, we utilize multiple human contact networks, spanning two real-world data

14

sets of spatio-temporal records of human presence over certain periods of time, as also net-

15

works of a classical synthetic variety. Over the diverse set of contact patterns, we discover

16

that testing the contact chain can both substantially reduce over time both the cumulative

17

infection count and the testing load. We consider elements of human behavior that enhance

18

the spread of the disease and lower the efficacy of testing strategies, and show that testing the

19

contact chain enhances the resilience to adverse impacts of these elements. We also discover

20

a phenomenon of diminishing return beyond a threshold value on the depth of the chain to

21

be tested in one go, the threshold then provides the most desirable tradeoff between benefit

in terms of reducing the cumulative infection count, enhancing resilience to adverse impacts

23

of human behavior, and cost in terms of increasing the testing load.

24

To slow down the spread of COVID-19, public health authorities like the US Center for

25

Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have recommended to test those who have in the recent

26

past been in physical proximity with a patient who has tested positive, even when the contacts

27

do not exhibit any symptom [30]. This preemptive action, commonly known as contact tracing,

28

is deployed because given how contagious the disease is, a patient is likely to have passed on

29

the contagion to his contacts, and the infected contacts have the potential to infect others even

30

before they show symptoms [12]. Moreover, the CDC estimates that up to 70% percent of the

31

infected individuals are asymptomatic, showing no symptom throughout the entire course of the

32

disease [25], and clinical research has revealed that the asymptomatic individuals can infect others

33

[16, 29]. Testing and isolating the infected can stop these infected individuals from spreading the

34

disease early on, that is, while they do not show symptoms, as compared to the strategy that tests

35

only those who show symptoms and seek medical help. Slowing down the spread by testing the

36

contacts comes at the cost of an increase in the testing load as compared to the latter policy, yet,

37

the cost-benefit tradeoff for contact tracing is understood to be substantially favorable (cost is the

38

testing load, benefit is the ability to contain the outbreak).

39

A question that naturally arises is if cost-benefit tradeoffs may be enhanced through general-

40

izations of the core concept of contact tracing - this is what we seek to answer in this paper. In the

41

time that elapses between when an individual is infected and until he is tested, the disease spreads

42

from him through a chain of several hops - he infects those he is in contact with, those he infects

testing only the direct contacts of those who test positive) and 3-hop contact tracing (i.e., testing
the direct, secondary and tertiary contacts of those who test positive). The time at which a health
authority tests the patient-0 (red) was after the infection has propagated 2 hops. By t+3 time units,
both testing policies test 4 individuals (black) other than the patient-0; the 3-hop policy tests and
isolates the positive ones in a shorter time, while 1-hop tests and isolates them progressively and
therefore over longer times. Accordingly, only 3 individuals are infected under the 3-hop policy,
while 10 individuals are infected under the 1-hop policy.

infect their contacts, the infected contacts infect their contacts, and so on. Fewer people are likely

44

to be infected if we preemptively test not only the direct contacts of an individual who tests posi-

45

tive, but contacts of the contacts and so on. Such testing will enable us to identify and isolate the

46

individuals further down the chain who have imbibed the disease, earlier than if we had tested only

47

the direct contacts of those who have tested positive and reached down the chain progressively.

48

Earlier isolation of the infected reduces the number they infect. Does such aggressive preemptive

49

testing schemes necessarily increase the overall number of tests? The answer is not apriori clear

50

as reduction in overall infection spread through such a testing strategy may eventually reduce the

51

number of tests required, as illustrated in Figure 1.

52

We formalize this aggressive preemptive testing scheme as k-hop contact tracing (k), where

53

k = 0 does not trace contacts and tests only those who show symptoms and seek medical help,

54

k = 1 is the traditional contact tracing that tests the direct contacts of an individual who tests

55

positive, k = 2 additionally tests the contacts of the contacts, k = 3 tests yet another hop of

56

contacts, and so on. Our investigation will quantify the 1) benefits i.e., reduction in the number

57

of individuals infected over time, 2) costs, i.e., increase in total number of tests, with increase in

58

k, for a wide variety of disease parameters, contact patterns, extent of willingness of individuals

59

to cooperate with the health officials on testing. We investigate for a wide variety of the above

60

parameters because values of the parameters that arise in practice are not definitively known at

61

this nascent stage of research on the novel disease, and will in general be different for different

62

ambiences. The goal of our investigation is to reveal if this natural generalization has any merit and

63

provide specific policy recommendations with respect to testing strategies. We will also examine

64

whether there arises the principle of diminishing return, that is, increasing the number of hops

65

beyond a certain threshold only marginally decreases the infection count but noticeably increases

66

the testing load - if so, such threshold, which we seek to identify, provides the optimum cost-benefit

67

tradeoff.

69

Human behavior plays an important role in determining the nature and extent of the spread
of an infectious disease and the efficacy of tests:

70

• When a contagious individual interacts with a susceptible individual, the latter is infected

71

with a probability whose value depends on various factors such as the duration, environment

72

(e.g., indoor or outdoor) of the interaction, distance between interacting individuals, protec-

73

tive gears worn by the individuals involved, personal hygiene like hand washing observed

74

right after interactions etc. [28]. The probability is understood to be higher for longer du-

75

rations, shorter distances, indoor environments and lower when appropriate protective gears

76

are worn and good personal hygiene is observed [7, 26, 27]. But, ambiences that reduce

77

probability of infection can not always be guaranteed owing to professional necessities and

78

voluntary choices. For example, several societal interactions will have to be in indoor envi-

79

ronments (e.g., among customers and staff of indoor businesses, fellow travelers in elevators,

80

public transports), for long durations (inside business units, public transport, elevators), in

81

close proximity (inside elevators, public transport). Protective gears like masks and personal

82

hygiene like hand washing can be recommended but not enforced. The most effective masks

83

like N95 masks may not be available for every individual and may also be inconvenient for

84

daily use for common people, masks may not always be worn properly. The net effect of

85

all of these is that probability of infection can not be controlled and may be high in various

86

circumstances.

87

• Human behavior also affects the reach of testing. It has been documented that only a frac-

88

tion of contacts of patients who test positive can be tested, as many contacts either do not

89

consent or can not be traced [14]; we refer to this fraction as cooperativity. Many contacts

90

for example do not respond to outreach by public health authorities. Contact-tracing apps

91

installed in wearable or hand-held devices can temporarily record contacts between individ-

92

uals and communicate pertinent information to the centralized database once an individual

93

tests positive [9]. Such contact tracing apps have been rolled out in Germany, Singapore,

94

England and some states in the US. These increase the fraction of cooperativity, but still

95

do not guarantee full cooperativity as individuals may function in areas of poor signal and

96

may not carry their personal devices all the time. Besides downloading such apps can not be

97

mandated owing to concerns on privacy and considerations of civil liberties and free choice.

98

Thus their acceptance to the populace is unclear at this point. Hence cooperativity may be

99

low in real life.

100

Resilience of a testing strategy to elements of human behavior that enhance the spread of the

101

disease and lower the efficacy (i.e., reach) of testing constitutes an important benefit. We refer to

102

k-hop contact testing for k > 1 as multi-hop contact tracing and ask if and in what sense multi-

103

hop contact tracing enhances resilience compared to 1-hop contact tracing (that is, the traditional

104

contact tracing), that is, can multi-hop contact tracing somehow offset the larger spread due to

105

imponderables of human behavior?

Figure 2:

Virus transmission model illustration. The Compartmental model consists of the

following compartments: Susceptible (S), Presymptomatic-Latent (Ip -L), Presymptomatic (Ip ),
Symptomatic (Is ), Ready-to-Test (RT ), Asymptomatic-Latent (Ia -L), Asymptomatic (Ia ), Recovered (R), and Dead (D).
106

The significance of our investigation also draws from the fact that the testing recommen-

107

dations by the regulating authorities have not been finalized yet, and recommendations are being

108

continually adapted as new facets are being discovered. For example, in the last few months the

109

CDC has changed its recommendation about testing the asymptomatic individuals multiple times

110

[29]. Thus, new findings about testing strategies are likely to find their way to practice now with

111

fewer legacy-related complications.

112

We consider a discrete time stochastic evolution of COVID-19 in a population that initially

113

consists of susceptible and a few contagious individuals. We model the progression of the disease

114

using a compartmental model (Figure 2). The disease spreads from the contagious to the suscepti-

115

ble individuals through mutual interaction. In any given interaction with a contagious individual,

116

a susceptible is infected with a probability. After a latency period (the presymptomatic-latent

117

and asymptomatic-latent are in this latency period), the newly infected individuals become conta-

118

gious. Specifically, at the end of the latency period, the individuals either become presymptomatic

119

(the stage before exhibiting symptoms), or asymptomatic (that is, they never show symptoms).

120

Presymptomatics proceed to become symptomatics in the next stage. Presymptomatics, asymp-

121

tomatics, symptomatics all however are contagious.

122

We assume that test results are obtained in the same day, owing to the availability of reliable

123

RT-PCR and antigen tests that are able to do so [11, 23] (recent antigen test authorized by the FDA

124

under an emergency use can give results in 15 minutes with 97.1% sensitivity).

125

Given the imponderables of human behavior, we consider a range of values for the parameters

126

they affect directly, namely, cooperativity and probability of infection. For the former we consider

127

the following values: 0.2, 0.5, 1.0. In addition, we assume that the contacts who can be identified

128

are identified within a day, contact-tracing apps can provide such turnaround times and can be

129

easily modified to trace and alert indirect exposures through iterative algorithms. Tests can then be

130

scheduled the next day through the same apps. As to the probability of infection, we use this term to

131

denote the probability with which a symptomatic individual infects a susceptible individual during

132

a contact, and consider the following values: 0.04, 0.2, 0.4. We consider that a presymptomatic

133

individual infects a susceptible with the same probability as a symptomatic individual, and that an

134

asymptomatic individual infects a susceptible with 0.75 times this probability [25].

135

We have simulated k-hop contact tracing for k = 0, 1, 2, 3 to large values of k for con-

136

tact patterns obtained from real-world data and various synthetic topologies. We consider two

137

contact networks obtained from real-world data of: 1) physical proximity of university students

138

obtained from their smartphones equipped with Bluetooth over 28 days, as part of the Copenhagen

139

Networks Study [22] (University student contact network), and 2) locations and time-stamps of

140

individuals in Tokyo, Japan which they provide over a social network (Foursquare) over 100 days

141

[32] (Foursquare contact network). These capture certain semblances of reality in that they are

142

obtained from spatio-temporal records of actual human presence; here the contact patterns vary

143

over time which is also what happens in reality. Yet, these are but constructed from only two sets

144

of data, which may not be representative of all contact patterns. We therefore examine whether

145

the phenomena observed in these also recur in some other very different networks, namely in two

146

examples of classical synthetic networks: Erdős Rényi and scale-free networks. These two exam-

147

ples complement each other in some fundamental characteristics such as in the nature of the degree

148

distribution. The degrees of the nodes represents the number of contacts of the corresponding in-

149

dividuals. The Erdős Rényi network is more regular, in that there is relatively low variance in the

150

degree distribution. The scale-free network, on the other hand, has some nodes with high degrees

151

(perhaps representing celebrities who interact with a large number of individuals) and many more

152

nodes with low degrees (representing common folks); the degree distribution therefore has a high

153

variance. For these the connections do not change over time, they are static in this sense. Any

154

phenomenon that is observed in the four very different types of networks modeling human contact

155

patterns is likely to recur extensively.

Results

159

We start with a summary of our important findings from the simulations for k-hop contact tracing

160

that we perform for k = 0, 1, 2, 3, . . .. We observe the following for multi-hop contact tracing

161

(which is k-hop contact testing for k > 1):

162

• Benefit of multi-hop contact tracing: Multi-hop contact tracing considerably reduces the total

163

number of infections over time compared to 1-hop contact tracing (that is, the traditional contact

164

tracing). The reduction is higher with 1) increase in probability of infection 2) the decrease in

165

cooperativity 3) decrease in the latency period. In addition, multi-hop contact tracing substan-

166

tially reduces the average daily new infection count in the peak infection period (time until the

167

daily new infection count peaks) compared to 1-hop contact tracing.

168

• Cost of multi-hop contact tracing: Over time the overall number of tests required in multi-

169

hop contact tracing is usually lower, than that in 1-hop contact tracing. But, studying how the

170

number of tests changes with time, initially the number of tests needed for multi-hop is somewhat

171

(considerably in few instances) higher than for 1-hop contact tracing.

172

Increasing the value of k from k = 1, the number of infections and the number of tests over

173

time decreases up to a threshold value of k (we observe that this threshold value is k = 2 or k = 3

174

in our simulations). Formally, we define the threshold point as the value of k at which the overall

175

number of tests required (cost) is minimized. As k increases beyond this threshold value, we see a

176

phenomenon of diminishing return, that is, the number of infections only marginally decreases and

177

number of tests increases (considerably, in some instances). We substantiate the above findings

with the results reported in Figures 3, 4, and 6; Figures 3 and 4 are for contact networks obtained

179

from real-world data and Figure 6 is for synthetic topologies. In each case we report the average

180

of 1000 simulation runs on given topologies.

181

We start with contact networks obtained from real-world data. We first consider the highest

182

probability of infection (i.e., 0.4) and lowest cooperativity (i.e., 0.2) from our range of choices

183

for the University student contact network. Recall that probability of infection and cooperativity

184

are determined by human behavior and their respective increase and decrease enhance the spread

185

of the disease and lower the reach of testing. Thus, this scenario represents a combination of

186

elements of human behavior that render a populace most vulnerable to a pandemic (among our

187

parameter choices). As k increases from 0 to 3, the cumulative number of infections considerably

188

decreases, and subsequently decreases only marginally with further increase in k. 3-hop contact

189

tracing achieves 80% reduction in the cumulative number of infections compared to 0-hop contacts

190

tracing (i.e., no contact tracing), while 1-hop contact tracing achieves only 30% reduction (top left

191

of Figure 3a). The total number of tests for k-hop contact tracing steadily decreases with increase

192

in k from k = 1 to k = 3, and subsequently steadily increases as k increases further. This number

193

is minimized for 3-hop contact tracing, at which value 27% fewer tests are required, overall, than

194

1-hop tracing (bottom left of Figure 3a). Thus, the threshold value is k = 3. Studying how the

195

daily number of tests varies with time, it is somewhat higher initially for 3-hop contact tracing, but

196

rapidly declines soon, as compared to 1-hop contact tracing (top of Figure 5a), leading to overall

197

fewer number of tests for multi-hop contact tracing. These observations may be explained as

198

follows. Multi-hop contact tracing may test greater number of individuals in early stages because it

199

traces up to more hops even from the same number of confirmed cases (top of Figure 5a). However,

200

this aggressive preemptive testing from early stages can rapidly mitigate the spread of infection

201

earlier than 1-hop contact tracing through early identification and isolation of the infected (bottom

202

of Figure 5a), thus fewer number of individuals transmit the virus and need tests with passage of

203

time. The latter phenomenon more than compensates for the larger number of tests required in

204

early stage for multi-hop contacts of those who test positive.

205

The above phenomena also recurs in the other contact network we obtain from real-world

206

data, namely the Foursquare contact network. Figures 4 and 5b for the Foursquare contact network

207

show identical trend as Figures 3 and 5a respectively for the University student contact network.

208

For the same probability of infection (i.e., 0.4) and cooperativity (i.e., 0.2), the threshold is again

209

k = 3. Again, the cumulative number of infections considerably decreases, as k increases from 0 to

210

the threshold point of 3, and with subsequent increase in k the decrease in the cumulative number

211

of infections is only marginal. 3-hop contact tracing achieves 81% reduction in the cumulative

212

number of infections compared to 0-hop contact tracing, while 1-hop contact tracing achieves only

213

24% reduction (top left of Figure 4a). 37% fewer tests are required, overall, for 3-hop contact

214

tracing as compared to 1-hop tracing (bottom left of Figure 4a). Again, although as compared to

215

1-hop contact tracing , 3-hop contact tracing initially needs somewhat higher number of daily tests,

216

the number of daily tests in 3-hop contact tracing rapidly declines soon (top of Figure 5b), leading

217

to overall fewer number of tests for 3-hop contact tracing. The higher number of tests in the early

218

stages helps contain the spread of infection rapidly (bottom of Figure 5b).

219

All the phenomena reported above is replicated for other parameters for both the University

221

of the advantage and values of the thresholds differ. The differences in the specific numbers reveal

222

that multi-hop contact tracing is more resilient to components of human behavior that enhance the

223

spread of the disease and lower the reach of testing:

224

• When cooperativity increases to 1, the reach of testing is higher, and the efficacy of 1-hop

225

tracing increases substantially. In University student contact network, it reduces cumulative

226

infections by 80% compared to 0-hop tracing (top right of Figure 3a). In Foursquare contact

227

network, it reduces cumulative infections by 83% compared to 0-hop tracing (top right of

228

Figure 4a). Comparing the results for cooperativities of 1 and lower, we note that multi-

229

hop contact tracing can offset the limitation arising from the lack of available information on

230

contacts. This is because decrease in cooperativity reduces the reach of tests while multi-hop

231

contact tracing increases the reach.

232

• As probability of infection decreases, the disease spreads slower, and 1-hop contact tracing

233

becomes more and more effective, and the threshold value generally decreases (or remains

234

the same). For University student contact network, refer to Figure 3b for the intermediate

235

value of 0.2 for the probability of infection, and to Figure 8 in Supplementary Information

236

for the lowest value of 0.04. For Foursquare contact network, refer to Figure 4b for the

237

intermediate value of 0.2 for the probability of infection, and to Figure 9 in Supplementary

238

Information for the lowest value of 0.04. In other words, therefore, employing multi-hop

239

contact tracing is more beneficial when probability of infection is high.

240

We consider synthetic networks now (Figure 6). All the phenomena reported above is repli-

241

cated, but the specifics differ. When probability of infection is 0.4, the threshold value is 2 for both

242

the scale-free and Erdős Rényi networks (first column in Figure 6). In the two cases, despite the

243

fact that the overall number of tests required in 2-hop contact tracing is significantly lower than

244

that in 1-hop contact tracing, 2-hop contact tracing reduces the cumulative number of infections by

245

96% and 98%, respectively compared to 0-hop tracing, while 1-hop tracing reduces by 56% and

246

41%, respectively (top left of Figure 6a and 6b). The phenomenon of diminishing return is even

247

more accentuated in these as the number of tests sharply increase with increase in k beyond k = 2

248

for k−hop contact tracing (bottom left of Figure 6a and 6b). Also, considering the variation of the

249

number of tests over time, we notice that in scale-free networks, the number is significantly higher

250

for multi-hop contact tracing than that for 1-hop contact tracing initially (top of Figure 7a). But,

251

the decline in the number of tests required for multi-hop contact tracing becomes equally precip-

252

itous over time, and the rapid decline starts in a short time from the start of the testing period as

253

well. Figure 6 plots the average of 1000 simulation runs over 1 realization of the synthetic topolo-

254

gies, Figure 11 in Supplementary Information reports the average of 100 runs over 10 realizations

255

of the same synthetic topologies, corresponding plots in Figure 6 and Figure 11 show identical

256

trend.

257

We now focus on the peak infection period and the average daily new infection count during

258

this period for all the contact networks considered above. The duration of this period is a measure

259

of how soon the infection is contained. The average daily new infection count during this period

260

is a measure of the treatment-load health care centers experience in a critical period in which

19

261

these have the potential to be overwhelmed. Under multi-hop contact tracing the peak infection

262

period is shorter, in some cases considerably shorter, and the average daily new infection count

263

during this period is invariably substantially lower, and therefore the healthcare facilities run lower

264

risk of being overwhelmed. For example, in University student contact network and Foursquare

265

contact network, considering the parameters as the first column in Figure 3a and 4a, respectively,

266

for 3-hop contact tracing, the peak infection periods are 7 and 7 days, respectively, and an average

267

of 8.8 (per 1000 population) and 3.6 (per 1000 population) daily new infections occurs during

268

this period, respectively. On the other hand, for 1-hop contact tracing in these networks, the peak

269

infection periods are 10 and 11 days, and an average of 18.6 (per 1000) and 8.6 (per 1000) daily new

270

infections occurs during this period, respectively (Figure 5). Next, in scale-free and Erdős Rényi

271

networks, considering the parameters as the first column in Figure 6, under 2-hop contact tracing,

272

the peak infection periods are 8 and 10 days, respectively, and an average of 3 (per 1000) and 1.1

273

(per 1000) daily new infection occurs during this period, respectively. On the other hand, for 1-hop

274

contact tracing in these topologies, the peak infection periods are 10 and 22 days, respectively,

275

and an average of 8.9 (per 1000) and 7.7 (per 1000) daily new infections occurs during this period,

276

respectively (Figure 7). Note that multi-hop contact tracing substantially reduces the peak infection

277

period in Erdős Rényi network.

278

We now examine how increase in the latency period affects the results. In this case, the in-

279

fected individuals become contagious later, thus, the potential of 1-hop contact tracing to detect and

280

remove individuals before they become contagious or in the early period of their becoming con-

281

tagious increases. Comparing the results for randomized latency periods of two different means,

282

we note that this is indeed the case. In University student contact network, when the mean latency

283

period is 1 day (2 days, respectively), 1-hop contact tracing can achieve 30% (43%, respectively)

284

reduction in the cumulative number of infections compared to 0-hop contact tracing, and 3-hop

285

contact tracing can achieve 80% (86%, respectively) reduction. In Foursquare contact network,

286

when the mean latency period is 1 day (2 days, respectively), 1-hop contact tracing can achieve

287

24% (33%, respectively) reduction in the cumulative number of infections compared to 0-hop con-

288

tact tracing, and 3-hop contact tracing can achieve 81% (86%, respectively) reduction. In scale-free

289

network, when the mean latency period is 1 day (2 days, respectively), 1-hop contact tracing can

290

achieve 56% (71%, respectively) reduction in the cumulative number of infections compared to

291

0-hop contact tracing, and 2-hop contact tracing can achieve 96% (98%, respectively) reduction.

292

In Erdős Rényi network, when the mean latency period is 1 day (2 days, respectively), 1-hop con-

293

tact tracing can achieve 41% (58%, respectively) reduction in the cumulative number of infections

294

compared to 0-hop contact tracing, and 2-hop contact tracing can achieve 98% (99%, respectively)

295

reduction. Refer to Figure 12 in Supplementary Information for a bar-graph representation of this

data.

297

Discussion

298

Our findings obtained through extensive simulations over a diverse set of four contact networks,

299

starting from those obtained from real-world data to synthetic networks show that multi-hop con-

300

tact tracing has the potential to substantially reduce total number of infections (which would in

301

turn reduce fatalities and treatment load on healthcare facilities) and reduce overall testing load. It

302

is more resilient to elements of human behavior that enhance the spread of the disease and lower

303

the reach of testing. It also helps contain COVID-19 outbreaks within shorter times and reduces

304

average daily new infection counts, specifically in the period up to when the daily new infection

305

count peaks, which would in turn reduce the treatment load on healthcare facilities during the

306

peak period. All these collectively have the potential to contain the outbreak without extensive

307

lockdowns and economic downturns.

308

309

310

Our findings lead to the following recommendations for public health authorities:

• Deploy multi-hop contact tracing; usually testing up to secondary or tertiary contacts of
those who test positive suffices.

311

• The recommended number of hops are on the higher end of the above range for lower latency

312

periods and when human behavior enhances the spread of the disease and lowers the reach

313

of testing, that is: 1) the probability of infection in each contact is high (e.g., from indoor

314

contacts, longer durations of contacts, lack of protective gears and personal hygiene) 2)

315

cooperativity is low. Given the imponderables in human behavior, the probability of infection

316

and cooperativity can not usually be accurately estimated apriori. Thus, it is safer to err on

317

the side of caution and opt for the higher end of the recommended range on the number of

318

hops.

319

• Create the infrastructure for handling a larger testing load for limited periods, which will

320

lead to a reduction in the overall testing load over time with the daily testing load expected

321

to decline shortly after the testing starts (if multi-hop contact tracing is deployed).

322

Finally, multi-hop contact tracing may provide similar benefits for other infectious diseases which

323

exhibit silent propagation (infection from individuals who do not show symptoms).

324

Note that the contact tracing recommendation of the CDC involves both testing and quar-

325

antining (even when the test result is negative) the direct or primary contacts of those who test

326

positive. Along the same lines, recent works considered tracing and quarantining (or testing) the

327

direct contacts of those who tested positive [1, 6, 9, 13]. Another recent work considered tracing

328

and quarantining both primary and secondary contacts of those who test positive, and found that

329

quarantining secondary contacts decreases the cumulative infection count compared to quarantin-

330

ing only the primary contacts, but also requires substantially higher number of quarantines [10];

331

[10] appears to reject the notion of quarantining secondary contacts and did not therefore explore

332

quarantining tertiary or even more distant contacts. It does not investigate testing the primary and

333

secondary contacts, perhaps because they would be quarantined regardless of the test results. We

334

instead explore tracing and testing multi-hop contacts, testing eliminates the need for extensive

335

quarantining as only those who test positive need to be isolated. Our results show that multi-hop

336

contact tracing even reduces the number of tests required. The difference between our finding

337

and the recent work arises because quarantine is a cumulative process in which each contact is

338

quarantined for several days, while tests related to each positive patient are done only once. As

339

to the primary contacts of those who test positive, we take no position on whether they should be

340

quarantined even when they test negative, and leave that to the policies of the relevant public health

341

authorities.

342

We now discuss the scenarios in which some of our assumptions may not hold. Tracing con23

343

tacts and scheduling tests for those traced may require more than a day when individuals do not

344

use contact tracing apps. PCR test results are not obtained same day if the testing site and labora-

345

tory are not co-located, though this delay may not affect the broad nature of our findings if those

346

tested quarantine until the test results are known. Antigen tests give results in an hour but some of

347

them reportedly record non-negligible proportion of false negatives. Depending on classifiers such

348

as duration, environment (indoor or outdoor), usage of protective gears, observance of personal

349

hygiene, different contacts may pass on infection with different probabilities. Assuming that such

350

a probability is identical for all contacts with same infectious categories, which is what we did,

351

is equivalent to considering an average over all contacts. Explicitly investigating the impact of 1)

352

delay in tracing contacts and obtaining test results 2) errors in test results 3) non-uniform infection

353

probabilities constitute directions for future research.

354

Methods

355

Construction of contact networks from real-world data. Our goal has been to evaluate the

356

multi-hop contact tracing strategy using publicly-available data of human contact patterns. For

357

evaluating the impact of multi-hop contact tracing, data sets need to involve large population sizes,

358

otherwise length of the contact chains will be limited by the size of the target populace. Also, in

359

reality, pandemic spread involves large target populaces and over several days, weeks and months.

360

Data of human contact patterns is not plentiful in the public domain due to privacy and other

361

concerns, the availability becomes even less for contact patterns of even moderate population sizes

362

and over moderate periods of times (e.g., even several weeks). Nonetheless, we construct two

363

different contact networks from data of real-world spatio-temporal records of human presence

364

over certain periods of time: (1) University student contact network and (2) Foursquare contact

365

network.

366

For the University student contact network, we utilize data collected by smartphones of Uni-

367

versity students, as part of the Copenhagen Networks Study [22]. The smartphones were equipped

368

with Bluetooth cards which recorded proximity between participating students at 5-minute reso-

369

lution. According to the definition of close contact by CDC [30], we only used proximity events

370

between individuals that lasted more than 15 minutes in a row in the same day to construct daily

371

contact networks. We postulated that two individuals had a contact if there are at least three consec-

372

utive proximity events with a 5-minute resolution between them. The constructed contact network

373

has 2959.82 daily contacts on average among 672 individuals spanning 28 days. The strength of

374

this data set is that it provides actual proximity events of a moderate number of individuals over

375

several weeks (a moderate period of time).

376

For the Foursquare contact network, we utilized the data that users of Foursquare service (a

377

Location-Based Social Networking or LBSN) made available in Social Media about their locations

378

in Tokyo, Japan along with time-stamps. This dataset contains advertised locations (or check-

379

ins) collected for about 10 months (from 12 April 2012 to 16 February 2013). Each check-in

380

contains information about the time at which the user visited the location, the GPS coordinates of

381

the locations, and the nature of the locations (e.g., coffee shops, restaurants etc.) [32]. We use the

382

first 100 days of data with at least one check-in. The strength of this data set is that it provides actual

383

time-stamped locations of a large number of individuals, more than 2000, over several months (a

384

long period of time). The weakness is that the contacts are still sparser than what arises in reality

25

385

as the locations in question are usually crowded and much larger number of individuals actually

386

visit these locations in overlapping time intervals but their whereabouts are not being reported in

387

this dataset as they do not use this LBSN. The contact network will become denser if their presence

388

can be considered. To compensate for this artificial sparsity we construct contact patterns based on

389

the available data by postulating that people have had a contact if they have been at the same venue

390

in the same day. Note that in reality individuals who have been at the same location in the same

391

day do not always do so at the same time and are therefore not always in physical proximity to

392

pass on the disease from one to another. Thus, the contact pattern we consider is denser than what

393

the dataset actually provides, which may compensate for the artificial sparsity in question. The

394

constructed contact network of Foursquare users has 5553.71 daily interaction on average among

395

2120 individuals.

396

The University student network involves spatio-temporal records of a smaller number of

397

individuals and over a shorter period of time as compared to the Foursquare contact network. The

398

contacts in the former are however based on actual proximity, while those in the latter are based

399

on visits to the same location during the same day. Thus these two networks have complementary

400

strengths and weaknesses. The evaluations can be repeated on more accurate and expansive contact

401

patterns, which would combine the strengths of the two contact networks above, as they become

402

available through collective efforts and enrichment of existing data repositories.

403

Finally during the contacts in these two contact networks a contagious individual passes the

404

disease on to a susceptible individual with a certain probability (we mention how we choose these

405

probabilities where we provide details on the Compartmental model of virus transmission and in

407

Synthetic networks The synthetic topologies consist of scale-free network [2, 3] and Erdős Rényi

408

random network [3, 8]. Figure 6 have been provided for only one realization of scale-free network

409

and Erdős Rényi random network, Figure 11 in Supplementary Information however shows plots

410

of averages over 10 realizations of each.

411

The scale-free network topologies are generated by Barabási-Albert method where new

412

nodes are added at each time step with m links that connect to existing nodes with a probabil-

413

ity being proportional to the degree of the existing nodes; we set m = 2 to generate the net-

414

work. We consider topologies of 10, 000 nodes and 19, 997 edges, thus average degree of a node

415

is hki = 3.9994. For the single realization we use in Figure 6a, diameter and average path length

416

are 9 and 5.01, respectively. Figure 10a in Supplementary Information shows that for the one real-

417

ization we consider in Figure 6a, the degree distribution is well approximated by power-law with

418

degree exponent 3, as should be for scale-free networks with the same degree exponent. Thus, the

419

single realization in question is a typical scale-free network.

420

The Erdős Rényi network consists of 10, 000 nodes which are connected with 20, 000 ran-

421

domly placed edges, thus the average degree of a node is hki = 4. For the one realization we

422

consider in Figure 6b, diameter (i.e., the greatest distance between pair of nodes of connected

423

components) is 14 and average path length (i.e., average distance along the existing paths) is 6.76.

424

Figure 10b in Supplementary Information shows that for the one realization we consider in Figure

425

6b, the degree distribution is well approximated by Poisson distribution with parameter hki, as

426

should be for Erdős Rényi random networks. Thus, the single realization in question is a typical

428

Compartmental model of virus transmission. We use a discrete time compartmental disease

429

model to model the progression of COVID-19 where the transition from each compartment to

430

the next happens after a random amount of time with a geometric distribution. Compartmental

431

model is also used in [1, 31]. Different stages of the disease are shown in Figure 2. The Com-

432

partmental model consists of the following stages: Susceptible (S), Presymptomatic-Latent (Ip -L),

433

Presymptomatic (Ip ), Symptomatic (Is ), Ready-to-Test (RT ), Asymptomatic-Latent (Ia -L), Asymp-

434

tomatic (Ia ), Recovered (R), and Dead (D). Only symptomatic individuals show symptoms, while

435

presymptomatic, symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals infect others.

436

When a susceptible (S) individual comes into contact with a symptomatic (Is ) individ-

437

ual, he is infected with the probability of infection βs . Similarly, a presymptomatic (Ip ) and an

438

asymptomatic (Ia ) individual infects a susceptible upon contact with probabilities, βp (= γp βs ),

439

βa (= γa βs ), respectively, where γp and γa are respectively infectiousness of presymptomatic and

440

asymptomatic individuals relative to symptomatic individuals. If a susceptible individual i inter-

441

acts with l symptomatic, m presymptomatic, and n asymptomatic individuals at time t − 1, the

442

probability that the susceptible individual is infected at time t is 1 − (1 − βs )l (1 − βp )m (1 − βa )n .

443

Once an individual is infected he becomes contagious after a geometrically distributed la-

444

tency time, whose statistics depends on whether he will develop symptoms at some point or

445

otherwise. Following the nomenclature in compartmental models already utilized for COVID-

446

19, we assume that an infected individual becomes asymptomatic-latent (with probability pa ) or

447

presymptomatic-latent (with probability 1 − pa ). The asymptomatic-latent (Ia -L) individuals never

develop symptoms, do not infect others for an mean latency duration of 1/λ, and subsequently be-

come contagious, at which stage we call them asymptomatic or Ia for simplicity. An asymptomatic

individual remains contagious for a geometrically distributed random duration with mean 1/ra , af-

452

the presymptomatic-latent compartment. A presymptomatic-latent individual becomes contagious

453

after a mean latency period of 1/λ, at which point we call him presymptomatic or Ip . He remains

velops symptoms and is called symptomatic. A symptomatic individual continues to infect his

456

contacts until he opts for testing (RT ). The duration for which a symptomatic individual infects

457

others is geometrically distributed with mean 1/w. Once this duration ends, the patient quaran-

458

tines himself and does not infect others. He ultimately dies (D) with probability pd , or recovers

459

(R) with probability 1 − pd , after a geometrically distributed duration whose mean is 1/rs . We do

460

not consider that individuals can be reinfected.

461

In all the networks, except in the University student contact network, we consider that ini-

462

tially all but three individuals are susceptible, among the three there is one each of presymptomatic,

463

symptomatic and asymptomatic. Since the University student contact network involves fewer in-

464

dividuals, we consider a fewer number of initially infected individuals. Specifically we consider

465

that initially all but one symptomatic individual are susceptible.

466

467

The parameters we choose and further justification for the choices are listed in Table 1 in
Supplementary Information.

468

Multi-hop contact tracing process. Every day individuals who are ready to test by virtue of

469

showing symptoms are tested and isolated if they test positive. Considering an individual who

470

tests positive on day t, we describe the process of tracing his k-hop contacts on day t and testing

471

them on day t+1. On day t after the individual in question tests positive, the public health authority

472

traces his k-hop contacts, over the last 14 days, and informs them that they may have been exposed.

473

If cooperativity is q, only q proportion of interactions per day can be identified. Tests are scheduled

474

on day t+1. Those scheduled to be tested are isolated from everyone else on the day of the test. The

475

test results are available in the same day, and those who test positive are isolated until they recover

476

and those who test negative can resume their normal activities. Individuals who test positive will

477

not be tested again, but those who test negative can be tested again after 3 days from the test date if

478

they have direct or indirect interactions with any one who tests positive or if they show symptoms.

Figure 8: The cumulative number of infections and average daily tests required for k-hop
contact tracing for various values of k for University student contact network. The probability
of infection is 0.04. The red colored bar corresponds to the threshold value for k. For k exceeding
the threshold value, the curves for the cumulative number of infections heavily overlap and become
indistinguishable.

that this figure plots the results averaged over 10 network realizations and 100 simulation runs on
each network realization, while Figure 6 plots the results averaged over 1000 simulation runs over
1 network realization. This figure closely resembles Figure 6 both in overall trends and specific
