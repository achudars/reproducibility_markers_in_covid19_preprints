Abstract

29

Objectives: To develop a regional model of COVID-19 dynamics, for use in estimating

30

the number of infections, deaths and required acute and intensive care (IC) beds using

31

the South West of England (SW) as an example case.

32

Design: Open-source age-structured variant of a susceptible-exposed-infectious-

33

recovered (SEIR) deterministic compartmental mathematical model. Latin hypercube

34

sampling and maximum likelihood estimation were used to calibrate to cumulative

35

cases and cumulative deaths.

36

Setting: SW at a time considered early in the pandemic, where National Health

37

Service (NHS) authorities required evidence to guide localised planning and support

38

decision-making.

39

Participants: Publicly-available data on COVID-19 patients.

40

Primary and secondary outcome measures: The expected numbers of infected

41

cases, deaths due to COVID-19 infection, patient occupancy of acute and IC beds and

42

the reproduction (“R”) number over time.

43

Results: SW model projections indicate that, as of the 11th May 2020 (when

44

‘lockdown’ measures were eased), 5,793 (95% credible interval, CrI, 2,003 – 12,051)

45

individuals were still infectious (0.10% of the total SW England population, 95%CrI

46

0.04 – 0.22%), and a total of 189,048 (95%CrI 141,580 – 277,955) had been infected

47

with the virus (either asymptomatically or symptomatically), but recovered, which is

48

3.4% (95%CrI 2.5 – 5.0%) of the SW population. The total number of patients in acute

49

and IC beds in the SW on the 11th May 2020 was predicted to be 701 (95%CrI 169 –

50

1,543) and 110 (95%CrI 8 – 464) respectively. The R value in SW England was

51

predicted to be 2.6 (95%CrI 2.0 – 3.2) prior to any interventions, with social distancing

52

reducing this to 2.3 (95%CrI 1.8 – 2.9) and lockdown/ school closures further reducing

53

the R value to 0.6 (95CrI% 0.5 – 0.7).

54

Conclusions: The developed model has proved a valuable asset for local and

55

regional healthcare services. The model will be used further in the SW as the

56

pandemic evolves, and – as open source software – is portable to healthcare systems

57

in other geographies.

Introduction

72

Since the initial outbreak in 2019 in Hubei Province, China, COVID-19, the

73

disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-

74

2), has gone on to cause a pandemic [1]. As of 11th May 2020, the Centre for Systems

75

Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University reports over 4,000,000

76

confirmed cases and 250,000 deaths globally [2]. National responses to the outbreak

77

have varied; from severe restrictions on human mobility alongside widespread testing

78

and contact tracing in China [3] to the comparatively relaxed response in Sweden,

79

where lockdown measures have not been enacted [4]. In the UK, advice to socially

80

distance if displaying symptoms was given on the 15th March, while school closures

81

and ‘lockdown’ measures were implemented from 23rd March onwards [5].

82

Mathematical modelling has been used to predict the course of the COVID-19

83

pandemic and to evaluate the effectiveness of proposed and enacted interventions [6–

84

11]. These models have been predominantly aimed at the national level and have

85

largely been based on epidemiological and biological data sourced from the initial

86

epidemic in Wuhan, China [12] and the first large outbreak in Lombardy, Italy [13].

87

In the UK, the epidemic escalated most rapidly in London [14] and the majority

88

of national modelling is seemingly driven by the trends in London, due to its large case

89

numbers and large population. One of the key issues facing NHS authorities is

90

planning for more localised capacity needs and estimating the timings of surges in

91

demand at a regional or healthcare system level. This is especially challenging given

92

the rapidly evolving epidemiological and biological data; the changes in COVID-19

93

testing availability (e.g. previously limited and changing eligibility requirements); the

94

uncertainty in the effectiveness of interventions in different contexts; significant and

95

uncertain time-lags between initial infection and hospitalisation or death; and different

96

regions being at different points in the epidemic curve [9]. South West England (SW)

97

is the region with the lowest number of total cases in England (as of 11th May 2020),

98

lagging behind the national data driven by the earlier epidemic in London [9,14].

99

COVID-19 results in a significant requirement for hospitalisation, and high

100

mortality amongst patients requiring admission to critical care (particularly amongst

101

those requiring ventilation) [15,16]. In the SW, the population is on average older than

102

in London [17] and is older than the UK as a whole (Table S1). Older age puts

103

individuals at elevated risk of requiring hospital care [18–20]. Consequently, we might

104

expect higher mortality and greater demand for beds in the SW than estimations output

105

from national models that may lack such granularity or risk sensitivity.

106

However, the SW’s first case occurred around 2 weeks later than the first UK

107

case [14]; perhaps implying that the local SW epidemic may be more effectively

108

controlled due to a lower number of baseline cases (than the national average) at the

109

time national interventions were implemented, as well as reduced transmission due to

110

rurality. This sub-national analysis can support in mapping the local epidemic, planning

111

local hospital capacity outside of the main urban centres, and ensuring effective

112

mobilisation of additional support and resources if required. Should demand be lower

113

than expected, reliable forecasts could facilitate more effective use of available

114

resources through re-introducing elective treatments (that had initially been

115

postponed) and responding to other, non-COVID-19 sources of emergency demand.

116

In this study, taking into account the timeline of UK-wide non-pharmaceutical

117

interventions (social distancing, school closures/lockdown) we illustrate use of our

118

model in projecting estimates for the expected distributions of cases, deaths,

119

asymptomatic and symptomatic infections, and demand for acute and intensive care

120

(IC) beds. We present the model trajectories for SW England using publicly-available

121

data.

122
123

Methods

124

We developed a deterministic, ordinary differential equation model of the

125

transmission dynamics of COVID-19, including age-structured contact patterns, age

126

specific disease progression and demand for hospitalisation, both to acute and IC. We

127

then parameterised the model using available literature and calibrated the model to

128

data from the SW. The model is readily adapted to fit data at sub-regional (e.g. Clinical

129

Commissioning Group), regional or national level. Key assumptions of the model are

130

summarised in the supplementary information.

131

The model was developed in R and all code and links to source data are freely

132

available (github.com/rdbooton/bricovmod). The model is coded using package

133

deSolve, with contact matrices from package socialmixr, and sampling from package

134

lhs.

135

Model structure

136

The stages of COVID-19 included within this model are 𝑺-susceptible, 𝑬-exposed (not

137

currently infectious, but have been exposed to the virus), 𝑨- asymptomatic infection

138

(will never develop symptoms), 𝑰-symptomatic infection (consisting of pre-

139

symptomatic or mild to moderate symptoms), 𝑯-severe symptoms requiring

140

hospitalisation but not IC, 𝑪-very severe symptoms requiring IC, 𝑹-recovered and 𝑫-

141

death. The total population is 𝑵 = 𝑺 + 𝑬 + 𝑨 + 𝑰 + 𝑯 + 𝑪 + 𝑹 + 𝑫 (Figure 1).

142

Each compartment 𝑿𝒈 is stratified by age-group (0-4, 5-17, 18-29, 30-39, 40-

143

49, 50-59, 60-69, ≥70) where 𝑿 denotes the stage of COVID-19 (S,E,I,A,H,C,R,D) and

144

𝒈 denotes the age group class of individuals. Age groups were chosen to capture key

145

social contact patterns (primary, secondary and tertiary education and employment)

146

and variability in hospitalisation rates and outcomes from COVID-19 especially in older

147

age groups. The total in each age group is informed by recent Office for National

148

Statistics (ONS) estimates [21].

149

Susceptible individuals become exposed to the virus at a rate governed by the

150

force of infection 𝝀𝒈 , and individuals are non-infectious in the exposed category. A

151

proportion 𝜹 move from exposed to symptomatic infection and the remaining to

152

asymptomatic infection, both at the latent rate 𝜼. Individuals leave both the

153

asymptomatic and symptomatic compartments at rate 𝝁. All asymptomatic individuals

154

eventually recover and there are no further stages of disease: the rate of leaving the

155

asymptomatic compartment is therefore equivalent to the infectious period, 𝝁. A

156

proportion of symptomatic individuals 𝜸𝒈 go on to develop severe symptoms which

157

require hospitalisation, but not intensive care. Once requiring hospitalisation, we

158

assume individuals are no longer infectious to the general population due to self-

159

isolation guidelines restricting further mixing with anyone aside from household

160

members (if unable to be admitted to hospital) or frontline NHS staff (if admitted to

161

hospital). Individuals move out of the acute hospitalised compartment at rate 𝝆, either

162

through death, being moved to intensive care at rate 𝝐, or through recovery (all

163

remaining individuals). A proportion 𝝎𝒈 of patients requiring IC will die at rate 𝝍, while

164

the rest will recover.

175

Contact patterns under national interventions

176

We assume the population is stratified into pre-defined age groups with age-

177

specific mixing pattern represented by a contact matrix 𝑴 with an element of 𝒎𝒊𝒋

178

representing the contacts between someone of age group 𝒊 ∈ 𝑮 with someone in age

179

group 𝒋 ∈ 𝑮. The baseline contact matrix (with no interventions in place) is taken from

180

the POLYMOD survey conducted in the United Kingdom [22]. The contact pattern may

181

also be influenced by a range of interventions (social distancing was encouraged on

182

15th March 2020, schools were closed and lockdown occurred on 23rd March 2020).

183

We implement these interventions by assuming that the percentage of 0-18-year olds

184

attending school after the 23rd March 2020 was 5% (reducing all contacts between

185

school age individuals by 95%) and that social distancing reduced all contacts by 0-

186

50%. We take the element-wise minimum for each age group’s contact with another

187

age group from all active interventions (distancing, schools/lockdown). A study on

188

post-lockdown contact patterns (CoMix [11]) is used to inform contacts after lockdown

189

(first survey 24th March 2020, with an average of 73% reduction in daily contacts

190

observed per person compared to POLYMOD).

191

Moving between contact matrices of multiple interventions was implemented by

192

assuming a phased, linear decrease. After lockdown we vary a parameter (endphase)

193

to capture the time taken to fully adjust (across the population, on average) to the new

194

measures (allowed to vary from 1 to 31 days). This assumption represents the time

195

taken for individuals to fully adapt to new measures (and household transmission),

196

and is in line with data on the delay in the control of COVID-19 (reductions in hospital

197

admissions and deaths after lockdown) [23]. The parameter endphase can be

interpreted as accounting for the time taken to adjust to all interventions (and not just

lockdown).

The force of infection

202

The age-specific force of infection 𝝀𝒈 , depends on the proportion of the population who

203

are infectious (asymptomatic 𝑨𝒈 and symptomatic 𝑰𝒈 only) and probability of

The basic reproduction number R0

207

The basic reproduction number 𝑅- of COVID-19 is estimated to be 2.79 ± 1.16 [24].

208

We include this estimate within our model by calculating the maximum eigenvalue of

209

the contact matrix 𝑴, and allowing the transmission parameter to vary such that 𝑅- is

210

equal to the maximum eigenvalue of 𝑴 multiplied by the infectious period 𝜇 and the

211

transmission parameter 𝛽. This gives the value for the initial basic reproduction

212

number 𝑅- , which changes as the contact patterns change as lockdown and other

213

interventions are implemented.

215

Parameter estimates and data sources

216

Model parameters are detailed in Table 1. We used available published literature to

217

inform parameter estimates. We used the following publicly-available metrics for

218

model fitting: regional cumulative cases in SW England (tested and confirmed case in

219

hospital), and deaths (daily/cumulative counts) from the Public Health England

220

COVID-19 dashboard [14], and ONS weekly provisional data on COVID-19 related

221

deaths [25]. The case data is finalised prior to the previous five days, so we include all

222

data until 14th May 2020, based on data reported until 18th May 2020. The mortality

223

data from ONS does not explicitly state the number of COVID-19 related deaths

224

occurring in hospital, but they do report this value nationally (83.9% of COVID-19

225

deaths in hospital, as of 17th April 2020). We assume that this percentage applies to

226

the SW data and re-scale the mortality to 83.9% to represent an estimate of total

227

deaths in hospital.

228
229

Model calibration

230

Using the available data (Table 1), we define ranges for all parameters in our model

231

and sample all parameters simultaneously between these minimum and maximum

232

values assuming uniform distributions using Latin Hypercube Sampling (statistical

233

method for generating random parameters from multidimensional distribution), for a

234

total of 100,000 simulations. We used maximum likelihood estimation on total

235

cumulative cases and cumulative deaths with a Poisson negative log likelihood

236

calculated and summed over all observed and predicted points. For 𝑖 observed cases

237

𝑋* (from data), and 𝑖 predicted cases 𝑌* (from simulations of the model), we select the

238

best 100 parameter sets which maximise the log-likelihood ∑ 𝑋* log(𝑌* ) − 𝑌* from the

239

total sample of 100,000 simulations. The best 100 samples were taken as part of a

240

bias-variance trade-off (Supplementary Information, Sensitivity analysis), and the

241

qualitative inferences would not change with other choices of sample size. For each

242

data point (taken from cases and deaths) we calculate this log-likelihood, and weight

243

each according to the square-root of the mean of the respective case or death data.

This ensures that we are considering case and death data equally within our likelihood

calculations.

Model outputs

249

For each of the 100 best parameter sets we run the model until 11th May 2020 and

250

output the cumulative cases and deaths in the SW. We output the predicted proportion

251

of the population who are infectious and who have ever been infected over time.

252

Finally, we estimate the daily and cumulative patterns of admission to and discharge

253

from hospital (intensive care and acute) and cumulative mortality from COVID-19.

254
255

Results and outputs

256

From 100,000 simulated parameter sets, we selected the best 100 baseline model fits

257

on the basis of agreement to the calibration data on daily confirmed COVID-19 cases

258

and weekly mortality due to COVID-19 in SW England. The distribution of the best

259

fitting values are shown in Figure S1a (and the priors in Figure S1b). All results are

260

shown with median and 95% credible intervals (95%CrI).

261
262

On 11th May 2020, the reported cumulative number of individuals with (lab confirmed)

263

COVID-19 was 7,116 in SW England [14], and the most recent report on total

264

cumulative deaths showed that 2,306 had died from COVID-19 (as of 8th May 2020)

Figure 4 shows the model prediction for the reproduction (“R”) number over time until

300

11th May 2020, when lockdown measures were relaxed. All interventions (social

301

distancing, school closures/lockdown) had a significant impact on the reproductive

302

number for COVID-19 in the South West of England. We predict that prior to any

303

interventions R was 2.6 (95%CrI 2.0 – 3.2), and the introduction of social distancing

304

reduced this number to 2.3 (95%CrI 1.8 – 2.9). At the minimum, R was 0.6 (95%CrI

305

0.5 – 0.7) after all prior interventions were enacted and adhered to (social distancing,

306

school closures and lockdown).

Discussion

311

We have developed a deterministic ordinary differential equation model of the

312

epidemic trajectory of COVID-19 focussing on acute and IC hospital bed capacity

313

planning to support local NHS authorities, calibrating to SW-specific data. The model

314

is age-structured and includes time-specific implementation of current interventions

315

(following advice and enforcement of social distancing, school closures and lockdown)

316

to predict the potential range of COVID-19 epidemic trajectories.

317

Using the publicly-available data on cases and deaths, combined with the early

318

estimates of parameters from early epidemics in other settings, we predict that on the

319

11th May 2020 a total of 5,793 (95%CrI 2,003 – 12,051) were infectious, which equates

320

to 0.10% (95%CrI 0.04 – 0.22%) of the total SW population. In addition, we find that

321

the model predicts a total of 189,048 (95%CrI 141,580 – 277,955) have had the virus

322

but recovered, which is 3.4% (95%CrI 2.5 – 5.0%) of the SW population.

323

We also estimate that the total number of patients in acute hospital beds in SW

324

England on 11th May 2020 was 701 (95%CrI 169 – 1,543) and in IC were 110 (95%CrI

325

8 – 464), while the R number has decreased from 2.6 (95%CrI 2.0 – 3.2) to 0.6

326

(95%CrI 0.5 – 0.7) after all interventions were enacted and fully adhered to.

327

The fits generally agree well with both the daily case data, and the cumulative

328

count of deaths in the SW, although the model overestimates the case data at early

329

stages, and underestimates later on (which can see seen in Figure S2a, and a scatter

330

plot of expected versus observed outputs in Figure S2b). This could be because we

331

are using formal fitting methods, or from the under-reporting of cases in the early

332

epidemic.

333

The primary strength of this study is that we have developed generalisable and

334

efficient modelling code incorporating disease transmission, interventions and hospital

335

bed demand which can be adapted for use in other regional or national scenarios, with

336

the

337

(github.com/rdbooton/bricovmod). We have worked closely with the NHS and at

338

Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) level to ensure the model captures key clinical

339

features of disease management in SW hospitals and provides output data in a format

340

relevant to support local planning. We combined local clinical expertise with detailed

341

literature searches, to ensure reasonable parameter ranges and assumptions in the

342

presence of high levels of parameter uncertainty.

343

The main challenge of this work is in balancing the urgent need locally for

344

prediction tools which are up to date (i.e. not relying on the national trends to inform

345

capacity planning), versus more exhaustive and robust methods for model

346

comparison. The latter of which uses existing models and more time-consuming (but

347

more robust) data fitting methods [30,31]. However, we believe that release of this

348

paper and sharing of model code will facilitate multidisciplinary collaboration, rapid

349

review and support future model comparison and uncertainty analyses [31].

350

As with all models of new infections there are significant parameter

351

uncertainties. Rapidly emerging literature is exploring a wide range of biological and

352

epidemiological factors concerning COVID-19, but due to the worldwide nature of

353

these studies, often parameter bands are wide and may be context specific. For

354

example, early estimates of the basic reproduction number ranged from 1.6 to 3.8 in

355

different locations [32,33], with an early estimate of 2.4 used in UK model projections

356

[8]. In addition, the information which informs our parameter selection is rapidly

357

evolving as new data is made available, sometimes on a daily basis. From our initial

358

analysis, we identified the following parameters as critical in determining the epidemic

359

trajectory within our model – the percentage of infections which become symptomatic,

360

the recovery time for cases which do not require hospital, the period between acute

361

and IC occupancy, the length of stay in IC, the probability of transmission per contact

362

and the gradual implementation of lockdown rather than immediate effect. Other

363

parameters (such as the percentage reduction in school-age contacts from school

364

closures) did not seem to influence the dynamic trajectory as strongly – and thus we

365

assume point estimates for these parameters. However, for example assuming that

366

95% of school-age contacts are reduced as a direct result of school closures is

367

perhaps an overestimate, and future modelling work should address these

368

uncertainties and their impacts on the epidemic trajectory of COVID-19 (but in this

369

case, this value was somewhat arbitrary, and the assumption was used in the absence

370

of school-age contact survey data). More research is urgently needed to refine these

371

parameter ranges and to validate these biological parameters experimentally.

372

We have also assumed that there is no nosocomial transmission of infection

373

between hospitalised cases and healthcare workers, as we do not have good data for

374

within-hospital transmission. However frontline healthcare staff were likely to have

375

been infected early on in the epidemic [34], which could have implications for our

376

predicted epidemic trajectory. Our model also assumes a closed system, which may

377

not strictly be true due to continuing essential travel. But given that up until 11th May,

378

travel restrictions are very severe due to lockdown measures [5], any remaining inter-

379

regional travel is likely to have minimal effects on our model outputs.

380

Similar to most other COVID-19 models, we use a variant on a susceptible-

381

exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) structure [8–10,16,30,35,36]. We do not

382

spatially structure the population as in other UK modelling [9,10], but we do include

383

age-specific mixing based on POLYMOD data [22], and the post-lockdown CoMix

384

study [11]. We also explicitly measure the total asymptomatic infection, and the total

385

in each of the clinically relevant hospital classes (acute or IC), which is a strength of

386

our approach. Future models could also take into account local bed capacity within

387

hospitals (including Nightingale centres) and accommodate the effect of demand

388

outstripping supply leading to excess deaths, inclusive of non-hospital-based death

389

such as is occurring within care homes. As with all modelling, we have not taken into

390

account all possible sources of modelling misspecification. Some of these

391

misspecifications will tend to increase the predicted epidemic period, and others will

392

decrease it. One factor that could significantly change our predicted epidemic period

393

is the underlying structure within the population leading to heterogeneity in the average

394

number of contacts under lockdown e.g. key workers have high levels of contact but

395

others are able to minimise contacts effectively, this might lead to an underestimate of

396

ongoing transmission, but potentially an overestimate of the effect of releasing

397

lockdown. We also know that there are important socio-economic considerations in

398

determining people’s ability to stay at home and particularly to work from home [37].

399

Early UK modelling predicted the infection peak to be reached roughly 3 weeks

400

from the initiation of severe lockdown measures, as taken by the UK government in

401

mid-March [8]. A more recent study factoring spatial distribution of the population

402

indicated the peak to follow in early April due to 𝑅- reducing to below 1 in many settings

403

in weeks following lockdown [9]. Other modelling indicated that deaths in the UK would

404

peak in mid-late April; furthermore, that the UK would not have enough acute and IC

405

beds to meet demand [38]. While modelling from the European Centre for Disease

406

Prevention and Control estimated peak cases to occur in most Euopean countries in

407

mid-April [20], these estimations were largely at a national level. Due to the expected

408

lag of other regions behind London, these estimated peaks are likely to be shifted

409

further into the future for the separate regions of the UK, and as shown by our model

410

occurred in early- to mid-April. This is also likely to be true for future peaks which may

411

result from relaxing lockdown.

412

Outside of the UK, similar modelling from France [35] (which went into lockdown

413

at a similar time the UK on 17th March), predicted the peak in daily IC admissions at

414

the end of March. Interestingly however, when dissected by region, the peak in IC bed

415

demand varied by roughly 2 weeks. Swiss modelling similarly predicted a peak in

416

hospitalisation and numbers of patients needing IC beds in early April, after lockdown

417

implementation commenced on 17th March [36]. US modelling [39] disaggregated by

418

State, also highlights the peak of excess bed demand varies geographically, with this

419

peak ranging between the 2nd week of April, through to May dependent on the State

420

under consideration. The modelling based in France also cautioned that due to only

421

5.7% of the population having been infected by 11th May when the restrictions would

422

be eased, the population would be vulnerable to a second epidemic peak thereafter

423

[35].

424

The ONS in England estimated that an average of 0.25% of the population had

425

COVID-19 between the 4th and 17th May 2020 (95% confidence interval: 0.16 – 0.38%)

426

[40], which is greater than the 0.10% (95%CrI 0.04 – 0.22%) we found with our model

427

(on 11th May 2020), but with some overlap. In addition, the ONS estimated that 6.78%

428

(95%CrI 5.21 – 8.64%) tested positive for antibodies to COVID-19 up to 24th May 2020

429

in England [41], and Public Health England estimated that approximately 4% (2 – 6%)

430

tested positive for antibodies to COVID-19 between the 20th and 26th April 2020 in

431

the SW [42]. Comparing to our model, 3.4% (95%CrI 2.5 – 5.0%) had recovered on

432

the 11th May 2020 (2 weeks later), demonstrating that our model estimates may be

433

within sensible bounds, and further highlighting the need for more regional estimates

434

of crucial epidemiological parameters and seroprevalence. We have assumed that

435

individuals are not susceptible to reinfection within the model timeframe, however in

436

future work it will be important to explore this assumption. It is not known what the long

437

term pattern of immunity to COVID-19 will be [43], and this will be key to understanding

438

the future epidemiology in the absence of a vaccine or effective treatment options.

439

With this in mind, our findings demonstrate that there are still significant data

440

gaps – and in the absence of such data, mathematical models can provide a valuable

441

asset for local and regional healthcare services. This regional model will be used

442

further in the SW as the pandemic evolves and could be used within other healthcare

443

systems in other geographies to support localised predictions. Controlling intervention

444

measures at a more local level could be made possible through monitoring and

445

assessment at the regional level through a combination of clinical expertise and local

446

policy, guided by localised predictive forecasting as presented in this study.

Key assumptions used in the model

639
640

i.

Closed, static population size with no immigration or emigration due to

641

the model being run over a short period of time, and current travel restrictions which

642

should prevent significant movement of individuals in and out of the South West.

643

ii.

No nosocomial transmission.

644

iii.

Recovered individuals are not susceptible to reinfection within the timeframe of

645
646

the model horizon.
iv.

647

Trajectory of model outputs is assuming that there is no easing of lockdown situation
over the timeframe of the model horizon.

648

v.

There is no restriction on number of hospital (IC and acute) beds available.

649

vi.

Asymptomatic and symptomatic are equally infectious and recover at the same rate.

650

vii.

95% reduction in 0-18-year old contacts from school closures

651

viii.

Range of 0 - 50% reduction in contacts from social distancing and range of 63 - 90%

652
653

reduction in contact rates due to lockdown
ix.

654
655

school closures and social distancing.
x.

656
657

R_0 is sampled between 2.79 +/- 1.16 and the infectious period and transmission
probability are chosen to achieve this

xi.

658
659

The reduction of any given contact rate is taken to be the minimum from lockdown,

Proportion symptomatic which require hospitalisation depends on age, with increased
risk for older age groups

xii.

660

Proportion in IC who will die depends on age, with increased risk for older age
groups

661

xiii.

The percentage of infections which become symptomatic is 73.15 - 91.05%

662

xiv.

The percentage of those requiring hospital who will require IC 0 - 30%

Sensitivity analysis

692

The choice of the final sample size m=100 taken from 100k samples is based on a

693

bias-variance trade-off with lower m giving a better model fit but higher m allowing

694

more predictions to be included. The choice of m is not of practical significance for the

695

median and 95% credible intervals of the main outcome measures of the model – bed

696

modelling - as shown in the below table.

Increasing m does slightly increase the estimate of the infectious population (total

699

infectious). This is explained by including models with slightly higher R value, i.e. R is

700

biased upwards as we move further away from the best answer. The bias is small

compared to the modelling uncertainty.

The inverse of 𝜇 and

705

𝜅, and 𝜖 in order to account for this bias in R.

707

We choose to report values for m=100 samples as part of the bias-variance trade-off.

708

The bias is small for this choice, with R close to unbiased and the confidence

intervals capture all of the significant variation components. The qualitative

710

inferences would not change with any of the above choices of m and uncertainty has

711

been well captured.
