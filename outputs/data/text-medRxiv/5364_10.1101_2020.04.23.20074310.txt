ABSTRACT
Background
From March 2-April 12, 2020, New York City (NYC) experienced exponential growth of
the COVID-19 pandemic due to novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Little is known
regarding how physicians have been affected. We aimed to characterize COVID-19
impact on NYC resident physicians.
Methods
IRB-exempt and expedited cross-sectional analysis through survey to NYC residency
program directors (PDs) April 3–12, 2020, encompassing events from March 2–April 12,
2020.
Findings
From an estimated 340 residency programs around NYC, recruitment yielded 91
responses, representing 24 specialties and 2,306 residents. 45.1% of programs
reported at least one resident with confirmed COVID-19: 101 resident physicians were
confirmed COVID-19-positive, with additional 163 residents presumed positive for
COVID-19 based on symptoms but awaiting or unable to obtain testing. 56.5% of
programs had a resident waiting for, or unable to obtain, COVID-19 testing. Two
COVID-19-positive residents were hospitalized, with one in intensive care. Among
specialties with >100 residents represented, negative binomial regression indicated that
infection risk differed by specialty (p=0.039). Although most programs (80%) reported
quarantining a resident, with 16.8% of residents experiencing quarantine, 14.9% of
COVID-19-positive residents were not quarantined. 90 programs, encompassing 99.2%
of the resident physicians, reported reuse or extended mask use, and 43 programs,
encompassing 60.4% of residents, felt that personal protective equipment (PPE) was
suboptimal. 65 programs (74.7%) have redeployed residents elsewhere to support
COVID-19 efforts.
Interpretation
Many resident physicians around NYC have been affected by COVID-19 through direct
infection, quarantine, or redeployment. Lack of access to testing and concern regarding
suboptimal PPE are common among residency programs. Infection risk may differ by
specialty.

INTRODUCTION:
For the first time in over a century, the United States (US) is part of a global pandemic
known as COVID-19,1 with anticipated impact comparable to the Spanish flu of 1918.
The causative novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV-2), first described in Wuhan,
China,2,3 has spread worldwide, particularly in New York City (NYC), which is currently
the US epicenter of cases and mortality.4 The first case was confirmed in NYC on March
1, 2020;5 six weeks later, hundreds of patients are dying from COVID-19 daily.6
Healthcare workers (HCW) are on the front lines of this pandemic.2,7 However, although
at least 4,500 peer-reviewed articles have been published on this topic between
January 1, 2020 and April 18, 2020, comparatively little is known about the toll of
COVID-19 on healthcare workers directly occupied with patient care.
Notably, the first physician to sound the alarm about the novel coronavirus causing
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was the Chinese
ophthalmologist Li Wenliang, who died after infection by a pre-symptomatic patient.8
Anecdotally, HCW in NYC have experienced unique challenges in combatting the
illness, including close contact with the sickest patients, exposure to high viral loads,
redeployment to clinical duties outside of their ordinary responsibilities, and severe
shortages in personal protective equipment (PPE).7,9,10 Among those at highest risk are
resident physicians, who are commonly stationed in high-acuity settings and comprise a
substantial part of the healthcare workforce in the United States.11 The activities of
resident physicians are standardized among residency training programs throughout the
US via accreditation with the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education
(ACGME), with each residency program supervised by an appointed program director.12
The structure of residency programs, with many resident physicians reporting to one
program director responsible for their activities and well-being, makes the resident
physician population practical for study through collection of data from residency
program directors. However, to our knowledge, no primary peer-reviewed data has
addressed implications of COVID-19 for resident physicians, whose situation has only
been described in editorials.13,14 We also sought to explore whether specialty-specific
risks existed for COVID-19 infection. By surveying residency program directors among
all departments within NYC from April 3-12, 2020, we captured the immediate features
and impact of COVID-19 among resident physicians during the exponential phase of the
COVID-19 pandemic in NYC. As future or recurrent outbreaks are likely, such
knowledge may help tailor future interventions to mitigate the burden of COVID-19
among HCWs.
METHODS:
Recruitment of program directors
Recruitment of residency program directors throughout the greater NYC area was
performed through circulation of electronic mail message sent by one investigator at
Columbia University Irving Medical Center (R.W.S.C.), with responses received from
April 3, 2020 through April 12, 2020. Identification of programs, respective program

directors, and contact electronic mail addresses were retrieved from either previous
correspondence or publicly available search tools with ACGME via hyperlink
(https://apps.acgme.org/ads/Public/Programs/Search). The survey was first distributed
to 12 ophthalmology residency program directors in the greater NYC area, who
expanded distribution to 188 additional non-ophthalmology training programs within
their own institutions. As a second method, 303 programs identified separately in the
ACGME database by two authors (M.P.B., A.H.A.) were also contacted electronically.
Ultimately, at least one contact attempt was made at every known residency training
program in the greater NYC area (approximately 340 total), as our two approaches may
have overlapped.
Survey of resident physician experience
An anonymous survey (Supplemental Content) eliciting de-identified information was
included in circulated electronic mail message by hyperlink with SurveyMonkey® cloudbased software (SurveyMonkey®, San Mateo, CA, USA). More than one survey
completion by the same user was prohibited, both by request within the recruitment
electronic message and based on internet protocol address. The need for subject
consent was waived due to minimal risk, anonymous nature, and lack of sensitive
information in the study design as per Columbia University Institutional Review Board
expedited exemption protocol IRB-AAAS9946. All procedures were reviewed and in
accordance with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.
Diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 among residents was elicited in our survey based
on clinical presentation with symptoms including: sore throat, cough, fever, shortness of
breath, chest pain, myalgia, malaise, conjunctivitis, anosmia, or gastrointestinal
symptoms. Survey questions pertained to 3 distinct groups among resident doctors: (1)
“confirmed” – defined as resident physicians with COVID-19 symptoms and positive test
results; (2) “presumed” – defined as resident physicians with COVID-19 symptoms
without test results, and (3) “suspected” – defined as resident physicians with COVID-19
symptoms and negative test results. Suspected cases were tallied in our analysis due to
the relatively high false negative rate of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) testing for active infection by this virus15,16 as well as high pre-test probability
for COVID-19 in the context of suggestive symptoms, due to HCW status and NYC
location.
Inclusion and exclusion of responses
Responses were reviewed for inclusion based on specific training program. Fellowship
programs were excluded from the analysis. Because certain specialties have programs
that exist as a residency-fellowship continuum, these training programs with ACGME
accreditation were included. We did not distinguish between these integrated programs
and residency-only programs. All programs included were ACGME-accredited, with the
exception of oral maxillofacial surgery (OMFS), which was included as many OMFS
programs offer clinical experience through ACGME-accredited rotations such as general
surgery, ultimately leading to medical licensure with or without an M.D. degree, in

addition to pre-existing dental licensure. Programs were included if within or
immediately adjacent to NYC. All queried programs but one were centralized within 30
miles of Central Park in Manhattan, verified by Google Maps with hyperlink:
https://www.google.com/maps (Google Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA) for distance
calculations which used mailing addresses from primary affiliations for each recipient of
the survey.
Statistical analyses
Proportions are reported as percentages with 95% confidence interval (CI) calculated
using the Clopper-Pearson approach.
Specialties with representation by 100 or more residents were selected for further
between-specialty analyses. Because the number of COVID-19 positive residents by
individual programs were count outcomes and non-normally distributed, Poisson
regression and negative binomial regression were fitted to determine whether specialty,
program size, or date of survey response affected the number of residents with positive
COVID-19 tests. Likelihood ratio (LR) testing was used to determine the
appropriateness between Poisson regression and negative binomial regression.
Fisher’s exact test was used to assess the overall effect of specialties on the proportion
of residents with confirmed COVID-19. Pearson’s chi-squared test was used to compare
infection rate and redeployment rate between departments. Correction for multiple
comparisons was made with Bonferroni procedures.
Statistical analyses were performed in the R programming language (Version.1.2.5042).
Type 1 error was defined at the 5% level for hypothesis testing with two-tailed
probabilities.
RESULTS:
Study sample
102 program director responses were received between April 3 and April 12, 2020, 10
of which were excluded based on residency and ACGME-accreditation criteria, and one
of which was removed as it was incomplete and reported zero residents in the program.
Thus, 91 programs representing 2,306 residents from 24 different specialties were
included in this study (Figure 1). Average program size was 25 residents (standard
deviation [S.D.] = 21), with a range of 1 – 98 residents per program. 49 programs
(53.8%, 95% CI 43.1-64.4) reported that residents provided services for >3 different
hospitals.
Overall cases and testing frequency of COVID-19
All 91 program directors reported numbers for symptomatic residents who had tested
positive for COVID-19 (“confirmed” cases). 90/91 program directors reported numbers
for symptomatic residents who were awaiting or unable to obtain testing (“presumed”

6
cases) and symptomatic residents who had tested negative for COVID-19 (“suspected”
cases). In total, 41/91 (45.1%, 95% CI 34.6-55.8) programs reported at least one
confirmed case, 49/90 programs (54.4%, 95% CI 43.6-65.0) reported at least one
presumed case, and 36/90 programs (40%, 95% CI 29.8-50.9) reported at least one
suspected case. Among all residents from all programs pooled together, 101 residents
were confirmed cases, 163 were presumed cases, and 76 were suspected cases
(Figure 2). The total number and proportion of affected residents by specialty are
shown in the Table.
86/91 program directors reported knowing how many residents were tested for COVID19. Among the 2,088 residents in these 86 programs, a total of 242 residents (11.6%,
95% CI 10.2-13.0) were tested for COVID-19. 177 residents who were tested also had
results reported by the time of the survey. Among these, 101 (57.1%, 95% CI 49.4%64.5) tested positive and 76 (42.9%, 95% CI 35.5- 50.6) were negative.
69/91 program directors reported knowing the exact number of residents who were
tested for COVID-19 as well as whether residents were awaiting testing. Among 1,673
residents in these 69 programs, 113 residents (6.8%, 95% CI 5.6-8.1) were waiting for
or unable to obtain testing. 39 (56.5%, 95% CI: 44.0- 68.4) residency programs had at
least 1 resident waiting for or unable to get testing.
For residents who tested positive for COVID-19 as well as those who tested negative,
the majority of testing was performed with RT-PCR of samples collected by nasal swab
(n=85 [84.2%] for test-positive; n=59 [77.6%] for test-negative), followed by
oropharyngeal swab (n=5 [5.2%] for test-positive; n=6 [7.9%] for test-negative).
Disease burden by specialty
To determine whether any specific medical specialties were more likely to have a
COVID-19 positive resident, all specialties with more than 100 residents in our sample
were compared. Programs that met this criterion included anesthesiology, emergency
medicine, general surgery, internal medicine, ophthalmology, pediatrics, and psychiatry
(Figure 1). Three specialties (anesthesiology, emergency medicine, ophthalmology)
appeared to cluster as high-risk specialties by proportion of residents with confirmed
COVID-19, compared to the remaining specialties (p=0.015, Fisher’s exact test). In
negative binomial models adjusted for the size of the residency program and date of
survey completion, specialty remained significantly associated with the number of
confirmed positive residents (p= 0.039). Using anesthesiology as the reference group
(as this specialty had the highest number of positive residents), anesthesiology was
significantly more likely to have a COVID-19 confirmed resident, compared to both
internal medicine (p= 0.020) and pediatrics (p = 0.029, Figure 3).
Timing of symptom onset
Symptom onset was reported to occur as early as or prior to the week of March 2–8,
2020 for 5 residents (1.5%) with confirmed (n=1), presumed (n=3), or suspected (n=1)

COVID-19 (Figure 4). Most residents with confirmed COVID-19 (35, 34.7%, 95% CI
25.5-44.8) were reported to first experience symptoms the week of March 22–28, 2020.
By contrast, most with presumed (53, 32.5%, 95% CI 25.4-40.3) and suspected (29,
38.2%, 95% CI 27.2-50.0) COVID-19 reported symptoms beginning the week of March
15–21, 2020. Symptom onset for affected residents among every category (confirmed:
n=3 [3.0%], presumed: n=3 [1.8%], suspected: n=1 [1.3%]) continued through the last
week of survey participation, April 6–12, 2020.
Personal protective equipment (PPE)
The majority of programs, encompassing 1,832 residents (79.4%, 95% CI 77.7-81.1)
used either N95 or surgical masks during patient encounters, depending on the context.
Nineteen programs, encompassing 323 residents (14%, 95% CI 12.6-15.5) used only
surgical masks during patient encounters; and 8 programs, encompassing 31 residents,
(5.7%, 95% CI 4.8-6.7) used an N95 respirator for all patient encounters. Excepting one
radiology program, all programs, encompassing 99.2% of residents in this study,
reported reuse or extended use of their masks (vs. single-use). Protocols mandating
universal wearing of surgical masks were introduced as early as the week of March 2–8,
2020 in only 3 programs (3.5%), and as late as March 30–April 5, 2020 in 20 programs
(23.5%, Figure 4).
43/87 program directors (49.4%, 95% CI 38.5-60.4) representing 1,314 residents
answered “yes” when asked whether their residents had had to work with suboptimal
PPE. There was no correlation between the mask type used by residents (surgical, N95,
or both) to perceived shortage of PPE.
Care Setting and Hospitalization
Among the 101 residents with confirmed COVID-19, 57 (56.4%, 95% CI 46.2-66.3)
presented to clinic or primary care, 17 (16.8%, 95% CI 10.1-25.6) visited the emergency
department, 2 (2.0%, 95% CI 0.2-7.0) were hospitalized, and 1 (1%, 95% CI 0-5.4) had
care escalated to the intensive care unit (ICU). The 163 residents with presumed
COVID-19 presented to primary care or clinic in 40 cases (24.5%, 95% CI 18.1-31.9)
and the emergency department in 6 cases (3.7%, 95% CI 1.4-7.8). Among the 76
residents with suspected COVID-19, 38 (50%, 95% CI 38.3-61.7) were evaluated in
clinic or by primary care, 5 (6.5%, 95% CI 2.2-14.7) presented to emergency
department, and 1 (1.3%, 95% CI 0-7.1) was hospitalized. In total, among the 340
residents with confirmed, presumed or suspected COVID-19, 3 (0.9%, 95% CI 0.2- 2.6)
were hospitalized (1 each from emergency medicine [who was also hospitalized and
went to the ICU], ophthalmology, and psychiatry programs; 2 were confirmed, and 1
suspected COVID-19). There were no deaths reported in any of the completed surveys.
Quarantine
One program (pediatrics) of 58 residents did not report any quarantine data. Of the
remaining 90 programs encompassing 2,248 residents (including 339 residents with

confirmed, presumed, or suspected COVID-19 infection), 377 (16.8%, 95% CI 15.218.4) residents from 72 programs (80% of programs, 95% CI 70.2-87.7) were reported
to be quarantined. 22 programs (24.4%, 95% CI 16.0-34.6) reported at least one
asymptomatic, but exposed, resident, who was quarantined. Among 34 asymptomatic
but exposed residents with known duration of quarantine, the time ranged from 1 – 14
days. 15 residents (14.9%, 95% CI 8.6-23.3) from 2 programs with confirmed COVID19, 26 residents (16.0%, 95% CI 10.8-22.6) from 5 programs with presumed COVID-19,
and 5 residents (6.6%, 95% CI 2.2-14.7) from 2 programs with suspected COVID-19
were not quarantined.
Redeployment
87/91 program directors responded to questions about residents redeployed to other
departments or locations to support COVID-19 efforts. 65 programs (74.7%, 95% CI
64.3-83.4) reported at least one resident redeployed, with 35 (40.2%, 95% CI 29.9-51.3)
programs redeploying more than one-third of their workforce. 594 residents (27.3% of
2,176 residents for whom redeployment information is known, 95% CI 25.4-29.2) were
reported to be redeployed. Anesthesiology had the highest redeployment rate, with 158
(56.0% of 282 total anesthesiology residents, 95% CI 50.0-61.9) residents being
redeployed to other services (p<0.001, Pearson’s chi-squared test). Of programs that
redeployed residents, 53 programs (81.5%, 95% CI 70.0-90.1) instituted redeployment
between the fourth and fifth weeks of March, approximately 1 month after the first case
in NYC was confirmed. Among residents redeployed to duties beyond their usual clinical
responsibilities, the majority went to the ICU (283/594 redeployed residents, 47.6%,
95% CI 43.6-51.7), followed by hospital floors (176/594, 29.6%, 95% CI 26.0-33.5), and
the emergency department (85/594, 14.3%, 95% CI 11.6-17.4).
DISCUSSION:
As of the date of our survey’s close, NYC is the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in
the US, and the daily death toll continues to rise.6 Here, we report the impact of
COVID-19 on NYC resident physicians, as reported by their residency program
directors, surveyed between April 3-12, 2020. Many of these residents have been
directly infected (101 confirmed positive), quarantined (16.8% of residents), or
redeployed (27.3% of residents) to duties outside of their usual clinical activities in
support of COVID-19 efforts.
101 residents were reported to have confirmed COVID-19 in our sample. While this is
4.4% of the 2306 residents whose program directors participated in our study, the true
rate in our sample may be higher, since 242 resident physicians were tested for COVID19, and only 177 had received their test results at the close of the survey.
We highlight a few points found in our study. First, program directors reported 15
confirmed COVID-19 residents and 26 presumed COVID-19 residents who were not
quarantined. Whether this was due to these residents being initially asymptomatic,
workforce need, delay in obtaining testing, or some other reason is not known.

However, we do note that 57.4% of residency program directors reported at least one
resident awaiting or unable to obtain COVID-19 testing. Second, 49.4% of residency
directors answered “yes” to the question of whether resident physicians for whom they
were responsible had suboptimal PPE. While this might reflect selection bias with
respect to which residency directors chose to answer the survey, we note that 90/91
programs reported reuse or extended use of masks that are ordinarily disposable after a
single use. Third, we find that some specialties may be at greater risk for contracting
COVID-19 compared to others. In particular, anesthesiology had significantly higher
numbers of confirmed COVID-19 residents than several other specialties. It is possible
that the higher infection rates may be due to the critical skill of intubation provided by
anesthesiologists, which comes with high probability of aerosolization and exposure to
viral particles.17
We recognize limitations to our current study. While not all presumed and suspected
cases have COVID-19, we present these numbers given the high pre-test probability of
infection in HCW with suggestive symptoms, as well as known limitations of RT-PCR
detection of the virus.15,16 Future work using serological testing may provide a more
accurate census of confirmed positives, as recent studies have shown.18 Selection bias
may have affected our findings, as fields such as ophthalmology may have been overrepresented due to the authors’ connections to colleagues in this field, while other
specialties may have been under-represented because of significant stress and lack of
time to complete the survey. It is also possible that program directors whose residents
have been affected by COVID-19 would be more likely to respond.
However, we capture 91 NYC residency programs (out of an estimated 340 total
residency programs) during a period of exponential pandemic growth, offering a unique
perspective on the impact on resident physicians during what may be the height of
COVID-19 in NYC. Indeed, capturing the experience as it happens avoids recall bias
after the fact. It is our hope that this insight may allow locations not yet as substantially
affected by COVID-19 to better anticipate the needs of resident physicians, who are
truly at the front lines of an unprecedented challenge.

FIGURE CAPTIONS:
Figure 1. Flow-chart of survey recruitment and responses among greater New York City
training programs, including represented specialties and number of residents. ACGME =
Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education; PDs = training program directors.
Figure 2. Of 2,088 total residents with known COVID-19 testing status, 101 residents
were confirmed (positive), 163 were presumed (untested), 76 were suspected
(negative), and 1,748 neither had symptoms nor were tested.
Figure 3. Number of residents by specialty with confirmed positive COVID-19 testing.
All 7 specialties with a sample size greater than 100 residents as surveyed across 91
representative program directors among 24 specialties and 2,306 residents from the
greater New York City area are included. Anesthesiology was significantly more likely to
have a COVID-19 confirmed resident, compared to both internal medicine (p= 0.020)
and pediatrics (p = 0.029).
Figure 4. Number of residents with new COVID-19 symptoms by week. Most confirmed
COVID-19 cases (N = 35) were reported during the week of 3/23- 3/29. Most presumed
COVID-19 cases (N= 53) and suspected COVID-19 cases (N = 29) were reported a
week earlier than the peak of confirmed cases during 3/16 – 3/22. Total number of
confirmed, presumed and suspected COVID-19 cases all started to drop after the week
of 3/23 -3/29. Bottom panel shows the number of programs enforcing mask policy by
week. Most programs started to enforce universal mask policy during the week of 3/23 –
3/29.
