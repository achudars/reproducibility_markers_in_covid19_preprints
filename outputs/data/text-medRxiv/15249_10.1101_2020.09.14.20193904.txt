Abstract
SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh coronavirus known to infect humans and has caused an emerging
and rapidly evolving global pandemic (COVID-19) with significant morbidity and mortality.
To meet the urgent and massive demand for the screening and diagnosis of infected
individuals, many in vitro diagnostic assays using nucleic acid tests (NATs) have been
urgently authorized by regulators worldwide. The limit of detection (LoD) is a crucial feature
for a diagnostic assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples, and a reference standard
with a well-characterized concentration or titer is of the utmost importance for LoD studies.
Although several reference standards of plasmids or synthetic RNA carrying specific genomic
regions of SARS-CoV-2 have already been announced, a reference standard for inactivated
virus particles with accurate concentration is still needed to evaluate the complete procedure
including nucleic acid extraction and to accommodate customized primer-probe sets targeting

different genome sequences. Here, we performed a collaborative study to estimate the
NAT-detectable units as viral genomic equivalent quantity (GEQ) of an inactivated
whole-virus SARS-CoV-2 reference standard candidate using digital PCR (dPCR) on multiple
commercialized platforms. The median of the quantification results (4.6×105 ± 6.5×104
GEQ/mL) was treated as the consensus true value of GEQ of virus particles in the reference
standard. This reference standard was then used to challenge the LoDs of six officially
approved diagnostic assays. Our study demonstrates that an inactivated whole virus quantified
by dPCR can serve as a reference standard and provides a unified solution for assay
development, quality control, and regulatory surveillance.

Introduction
COVID-19 is the disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and is an emerging and
rapidly evolving worldwide pandemic1,2. This pandemic has affected more than 188 countries
or regions with more than 18,575,326 confirmed cases and 701,754 confirmed deaths as of
August 6, 20203. Person-to-person transmission from asymptomatic individuals has been
reported and can exacerbate the spread of the pandemic4. A major challenge faced by assay
developers and health authorities is providing clinical diagnostic tests with a good limit of
detection (LoD) and accuracy for the screening and diagnosing of those suspected of having
COVID-19, even when the virus is present in minute quantities. Clinical diagnosis can
identify infected individuals including asymptomatic people. This can inform patient care and
disease management, suppress infection and transmission, and provide epidemiological and
surveillance information. To meet the urgent and massive demand for diagnostic tests, the
China National Medical Products Administration (NMPA; formerly, CFDA) and other health
authorities have urgently authorized a large number of in vitro diagnostic assays based on
nucleic acid tests (NATs)5. Although LoD is a part of the product specification, a direct
comparison to assess and benchmark those assays under well-defined settings remains
unexplored.
To determine the LoDs of diagnostic assays, various reference materials such as synthetic
RNA transcripts, extracted genomic RNA, armored RNA, or inactivated virus particles with
known concentrations or titers are commonly used. The use of various reference materials

without consolidation leads to inaccurate and improper determination of LoDs of different
diagnostic test kits—especially during an emergency such as COVID-19.
Virus particles are the ideal reference standard because they can evaluate the entire
process, from nucleic acid extraction to results reporting. The reference standard must be
appropriately quantified. Discrepancies in reference standards hinder attempts to understand
assay performance by both assay developers and regulatory agencies because the same
diagnostic assay can deliver very different performance metrics depending on which reference
standard is used. Malfunctioning assays due to poor precision of reference standard will suffer
issues such as low positive rates in the field, inconsistent test results, delays in clinical action,
and the premature release of sick people.
Digital PCR (dPCR) is an emerging technology that achieves the absolute quantification
of nucleic acid targets in a sample by partitioning analyte molecules into a large number of
miniaturized reaction volumes, followed by the Poisson statistical analysis of the end-point
binary results from each partition6-9. Due to its superior sensitivity, specificity, and absolute
quantification ability, dPCR has been used for the diagnostic detection of SARS-CoV-2 as

well as the quantification of reference standards especially when the calibration material is
not readily available10-13. For example, synthetic viral RNA, extracted genomic RNA, and
inactivated virus particles offered by Biodefense and Emerging Infections Research
Resources Repository (BEI resources) were quantified with a Bio-rad QX-200 Droplet Digital
PCR System. However, quantification efforts that rely on one particular platform can deliver
biased measurements due to technical, environmental, and biological factors. This systematic
error, if not well characterized and understood, can lead to adverse effects with different NATs.
We aim to overcome this challenge through recruiting several distinct dPCR platforms in our
study.
This work reports a multi-platform dPCR quantification of a SARS-CoV-2 reference
standard candidate via inactivated whole-virus particles in collaboration with nine
independent participants equipped with six dPCR platforms. Several estimators were explored
to determine the consensus true value of the concentration of virus particles in the reference
standard. Finally, this reference standard was used to challenge the LoDs of six diagnostic

assays approved by WHO and China NMPA.

Methods and Experiments
Preparation of reference standard candidate.
A SARS-CoV-2 culture (BetaCoV/Wuhan/IPBCAMS-WH-01/2019, GenBank: MT019529.1)
was provided by the Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences &
Peking Union Medical College. The strain was cultured with Vero cells (ATCC® CCL-81) at
37°C in a 5% carbon dioxide incubator. The cultured viruses were frozen and thawed once at
-80°C; cytopathic effects (CPE) were observed in more than 60% of cells. The cultured
viruses were inactivated by heating at 56°C for 1 hour (h). The collected viruses were then
centrifuged to remove cell debris at 3000 g, 4°C for 10 min. The concentration of the
supernatants was determined using a digital PCR detection kit (TargetingOne Corporation,
China). The SARS-CoV-2 stocks were diluted to ~ 1×106 GEQ/mL in a universal buffer (10
mM PBS buffer pH 7. 5, 1% human serum albumin, 0.1% trehalose). Bulk preparations were
aliquoted into 2 ml screw-cap tubes and stored at -80°C for inclusion in the collaborative
study. This sample was provided to nine independent participants equipped with six different
dPCR platforms, and the experiments were performed immediately upon sample arrival.
Viral RNA extraction and One-step RT-dPCR.
The same viral RNA extraction kit and protocol were adopted by all participants in the
quantification of the reference standard candidate. Viral total RNA was extracted with the
QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kits (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) in biosafety level-2 laboratories
(BSL-2). A volume of 140 μL virus sample was used for RNA extraction, and the extracted
RNA was eluted in 60 μL RNase-free water. The RNA extraction process was performed in
duplicate for the quantification of reference standard candidate. To quantify the SARS-CoV-2
reference standard candidate using digital PCR method, three participants used a QX-200
system (Bio-rad, CA, USA), two participants used the TD-1 system (TargetingOne, Beijing,
China), and the other four participants used the Naica system (Stilla Technologies, Villejuif,
France), OsciDrop Flex system (Dawei Bio, Beijing, China), Starry 10K system (DAAN
Gene, Guangzhou, China), and MicroDrop-100 system (Forevergen, Guangzhou, China).
Estimation of measurement uncertainty.

The concentration of virus particles for ORF1ab and N gene in the reference standard
candidate was reported by the participants. The replicate measurements from extraction were
combined to calculate the mean value of concentrations for each gene. The variance from
extraction and dPCR replicates was calculated through a one-way ANOVA in R14.
The standard uncertainty of the measurement data was calculated by taking the square root of
the sum of the variance divided by the number of replicates15. The relative standard
uncertainty of the measurement data was obtained by dividing the standard uncertainty of the
measurement data by the mean concentration for each gene. Finally, the relative standard
uncertainty for the concentrations of ORF1ab and N genes was determined by combining the
relative uncertainty of measurement data and the relative uncertainty of droplet volumes from
instrument specification16,17.
Estimation of the consensus true value of the concentration of virus particles.
All candidate Key Comparison Reference Value (KCRV) estimators were calculated in R. The
mean, median, and their associated uncertainties were calculated with native R functions. The
DerSimonian-Laird (DSL) procedure and restricted maximum likelihood (REML) fits were
calculated from the metrology package. The uncertainty-weighted mean was calculated from
the glm function in the stats package. The Huber estimate 2 (H15) was calculated from the
MASS package. The uncertainty-weighted Huber estimate was calculated with rlm function
from the MASS package.
Evaluation of LoD of commercial diagnostic assays.
The quantified reference standard was serially diluted and applied to LoD probit regression
analysis for six diagnostic assays. A total of at most 10 concentration levels were tested with
multiple replicates per concentration according to the manufacturer's instructions with an
additional 10 replicates of viral transport medium as the blank control. Probit regression
analysis of 95% hit rates was performed with SPSS 16.0 software (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL).

Results and discussion
Study design for quantification of reference standard candidate.
We adopted a multi-platform strategy to achieve accurate quantification of the SARS-CoV-2
reference standard candidate. We hypothesized that platforms and assays with different

properties such as precision and accuracy of droplet volume, number of effective droplets, or
assay threshold for distinguishing positive and negative reactions would introduce
supplier-dependent systematic errors into the measurements. Therefore, we included a variety
of dPCR platforms and service laboratories in this study. A reference standard candidate
containing heat-inactivated virus particles was provided to nine participants equipped with six
dPCR platforms including four new digital PCR platforms introduced by Chinese companies.
The technical specifications and key features of the dPCR platforms are summarized in Table
1. These platforms operate through droplet microfluidic chips, microwells, and Droplet Array
Production by Cross-interface Oscillation (DAPCOTM) technologies and generate droplets
ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 with a claimed precision of droplet volume between 2.8%
and 10%. Two to four fluorescence channels are available for hydrolysis of the fluorescence
probe-based assays.
The study comprises two major steps: RNA extraction and one-step RT-dPCR. Virus
particles were used as the starting material to ensure that the entire workflow is evaluated, and
variations in each step contribute to the precision and accuracy of quantification. They thus
provide a good estimate for real-world situations in clinical diagnostic settings. QIAamp Viral
RNA Mini Kit is one of the kits recommended by the US CDC and was used by all the
participants to extract total viral RNA. Due to logistical constraints, two replicate extractions
were performed by each participant. All participants were required to follow the same RNA
extraction protocol. A 5-step, 10-fold dilution series of the starting material was prepared, and
each dilution was measured with an individual dPCR platform to determine which dilution
falls into the linear digital quantification range to report an accurate quantification result.
One-step RT-PCR reactions were performed to ensure consistency and minimize
cross-contamination. Reverse transcription was initiated after droplet formation with
gene-specific primers to synthesize cDNA that was used as PCR templates in the following
hydrolysis probe-based assays. Each participant adopted their own experimental conditions
including primer-probe sets, input amounts of RNA templates, RT-PCR supermix, cycling
conditions, and dPCR platforms: These were optimized for the RT-PCR assay-dPCR platform
combinations and were necessary to assess quantification results as practical dPCR assays at
each laboratory.

The one-step RT-dPCR assays were performed in two formats: singleplex and duplex.
Singleplex assays are straightforward to implement. Each data point is an independent
measurement because the reaction is performed separately. Although multiplex assays may be
influenced by primer/probe interactions or competition for resources, they facilitate
simultaneous amplification of multiple target sequences in the same tube for the same sample.
Singleplex dPCR assays targeting the ORF1ab and N regions were performed by five
participants, and duplex dPCR assays targeting the ORF1ab and N regions simultaneously
were performed by four participants. The quantification results were reported by the
participants and analyzed to determine the consensus true value of the virus GEQs.

Determination of the viral GEQ of the reference standard.
We first visualized aggregate results from all participants and assays with a box plot, a violin
plot (Figure 1A) and histogram (Figure 1B). Overall, the results showed a high degree of
consistency on a coarse scale with means of 4.88×105 GEQ/mL (CV=43%) and 4.22×105
GEQ/mL (CV=44%) for the concentrations of ORF1ab and N gene, respectively. This
agreement is remarkable in light of the differences in instruments, assays, experimental
conditions, and operators between all nine participants. There is no calibration curve or
internal control. This highlights the unique capability of dPCR for accurate and absolute
quantification of nucleic acids. Technical duplicates from RNA extraction demonstrated high
reproducibility within each participant. Considering the variation in droplet volume, the

relative standard uncertainties of concentrations of ORF1ab and N genes in the sample for all
suppliers showed decent precision and was less than 10% for most suppliers (Figure 1C).
At fine scale, however, the variation of the measured number of copies of ORF1ab and N
gene with different dPCR platforms is apparent. Histograms for both ORF1ab gene and N
gene showed dispersal with a multi-modal distribution (Figure 1B). These data indicate
heterogeneity within the data sets. The variation presumably stems from anticipated
substantial differences in platforms, plexy, and assay design as well as the RNA extraction
induced variation. In particular, we looked at the effect of assay plexy on the quantification
outcome. The duplex assay gives a higher variation. The relative standard deviations (RSD)
of measured mean concentrations with singleplex dPCR are 20.8% and 31.5% for ORF1ab
and N regions; those with duplex dPCR are 73.5% and 60.3%, respectively. Our attempt with
a t-test and two groups of data sets: singleplex (n=4) and duplex (n=5) on the mean
concentration of each gene analyzed resulted in an insignificant difference (p>0.1). However,
the effect of assay plexy on measured concentrations could not be rigorously determined due
to the confounding factor of the dPCR platforms. Therefore, both singleplex and duplex data
sets were included in the subsequent analysis.

(CCQM) guidance note CCQM13-2218. The entire data set was used to calculate the candidate
KCRV estimators. The results are plotted in Figure 2. The candidate KCRV for the
concentration of ORF1ab gene varied from 3.9×105 to 4.9×105 GEQ/mL. Those for the
concentration of the N gene varied from 4.0×105 to 4.4×105 GEQ/mL. Most participants
presented precise measurements with similar uncertainties. We considered seven estimators
including estimators that do not leverage reported uncertainties in location estimation such as
mean, median, and H15 estimates. Given the dispersion and heterogeneity within the data set,
a median estimator was used for KCRV assignment because of its resistance to outliers. The
median is 4.8×105 GEQ/mL with a standard uncertainty of 1.3×105 GEQ/mL for the
concentration of ORF1ab gene, and 4.4×105 GEQ/mL with a standard uncertainty of 3.4×104
GEQ/mL for the concentration of N gene. We used the arithmetic mean of concentration of
ORF1ab gene and N gene to calculate the concentration of virus particles. The standard
uncertainty of the reference standard was obtained by combining of the standard uncertainties
of ORF1ab and N genes. The concentration of virus particles is determined to be 4.6×105
GEQ/mL with a standard uncertainty of 6.5×104 GEQ/mL.

We applied the reference standard with consensus true value to evaluate the LoDs of six
diagnostic assays approved by WHO or China NMPA (Figure 3). The tests cover one-step
RT-PCR assays that require an extra step for nucleic acid extraction or release (Sansure, BGI,
and Liferiver), fully automated NAT following the conventional workflow (Roche), and
cartridge-based POCT devices for rapid “sample-in-answer-out” diagnostic tests (Cepheid
and Ustar). According to the manufacturers' instructions, the claimed LoDs of these
diagnostic assays were obtained using reference materials such as armored RNA and clinical
specimen RNA. Using the reference standard established in this work, we measured LoDs for
all target genes of six diagnostic assays based on probit regression analysis of 95% hit rates
(Fig. 3). Our study demonstrates that most diagnostic assays included in the study can meet or
exceed the claimed sensitivity and are reliable for SARS-CoV-2 detection. All 12 claimed
LoDs fall within the two-fold region of the measured LoDs. The results show that the
reference standard is suitable for the assessment of various NATs and allows for comparable
LoD studies of various detection methodologies. However, further validation using clinical
samples is required to thoroughly evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of these diagnostic
assays. For example, additional features such as reliability with poor quality and stability of
viral RNA in the clinical sample, high specificity against background genetic material, and
robustness to PCR inhibitors may further stratify the performance of diagnostic assays in
clinical settings.

Conclusion
This paper established a quantitative reference standard for inactivated SARS-CoV-2
whole-virus particles cultured from a representative isolate with a multi-platform dPCR
approach. The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) recommends the use of
WHO or relevant reference materials with accurate assigned values for the LoD
determinations of diagnostic assays, especially for NATs of infectious diseases19. The
reference standard established in this work was prepared using an inactivated whole-virus
culture that was accurately measured using multi-digital PCR platforms. The standard can be
used for LoD determinations during assay development as well as assessment. Thus, in

comparison with existing reference materials such as synthetic RNA, genomic extraction, or
pseudoviruses, the newly established reference standard is more suitable for the determination
of the LoDs of various NAT assays regardless of assay platforms, extraction methods, and
target genes.
We leveraged the unique capability of dPCR for the absolute quantification of nucleic
acid samples and adopted a variety of dPCR technologies with distinct partitioning
mechanisms and technical features to achieve the consensus true value of the concentration of
virus particles through statistical analysis of the data set and judicious choice of estimators.
The use of multiple platforms effectively corrects the system-level deviation from the true
value due to the use of a single digital PCR platform20,21.
However, this collaborative and multi-platform emergency research also has some
limitations. First, we found that single-plex dPCR provides lower inter-laboratory variation
than multiplex dPCR and is better suited for the quantification of reference materials.
However, the effect of the plexy of digital PCR for quantification was not adequately
addressed due to limitations in the scope of the study as well as constraints from commercial
suppliers. Second, the claimed droplet volume precision by manufacturers was used to
estimate its contribution to measured uncertainty while variations in droplet volume were not
experimentally determined and provided by the participants or the manufacturers. Third, the
efficiency of nucleic extraction and operator-induced variability were not thoroughly assessed
due to the difficulty of using an inter-laboratory study design to accommodate many
replicates. Therefore, data sets with some participants may introduce random errors in
addition to the variation of dPCR platforms. Future research should consider these limitations
for better validation of the reference materials. Despite these constraints, our results were
derived from the consensus of a large number of relatively uncorrelated dPCR platforms and
service suppliers with distinct characteristics. The consensus quantification should outperform
its individual constituents for accuracy and precision.
Overall, our findings showed how the quantification result can be influenced by
platforms and assays, and a multi-platform collaborative effort is a promising approach for
ensuring quality and accuracy in a timely manner. A reference standard using inactivated
whole-virus particles ensures a thorough evaluation of the complete in vitro diagnostic
