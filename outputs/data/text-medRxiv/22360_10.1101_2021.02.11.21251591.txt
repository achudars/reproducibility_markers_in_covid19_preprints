Abstract
Background
Although many studies identify the presence of comorbidities and socioeconomic
vulnerabilities as risk factors for worse COVID-19 outcomes, few have addressed this
issue in children. We aimed to study how these factors have impacted COVID-19
mortality in Brazilian children and adolescents.

Methods
This is an observational study using publicly available data from the Brazilian Ministry of
Health. We studied 5,857 patients younger than 20 years old, all of them hospitalized
with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. We used multilevel mixed-effects generalized
linear models to study mortality, stratifying the analysis by age, region of the country,
presence of noncommunicable diseases, ethnicity, and socioeconomic development.

Findings
Individually, most of the comorbidities included were risk factors. Having more than one
comorbidity increased almost tenfold the risk of death (OR 9·67 95%CI 6·89-13·57).
Compared to White children, Indigenous, Pardo (mixed), and East Asian had a
significantly higher risk of mortality. We also found a regional effect (higher mortality in
the North), and a socioeconomic effect (higher mortality among children from less
socioeconomically developed municipalities).

Interpretation
Besides the impact of comorbidities, we identified ethnic, regional, and socioeconomic
effects shaping the mortality of children hospitalized with COVID-19 in Brazil. Putting
these findings together, we propose that there is a syndemic among COVID-19 and
noncommunicable diseases, driven and fostered by large-scale sociodemographic
inequalities. Facing COVID-19 in Brazil must also include addressing these structural
issues. Our findings also identify risk groups among children that should be prioritized
for public health measures, such as vaccination.

Funding
None.

Introduction
The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is the most significant health challenge of

1

the century, with more than 80 million infected and 1·8 million deaths as of December 2020.

After a first wave that elicited radical containment measures around the world, during the last
months of 2020, we have watched the numbers rise again, prompting countries to reinstate
lockdowns and reinforce containment policies, with special focus on vaccination. Unfortunately,
Brazil has lagged. The federal government has been widely criticized for questioning the
seriousness of the disease or denying its gravity altogether, delaying a timely response.

1

December 2020, Brazil ranks third in number of cases and second in deaths.

2,3

As of

The country is

currently struggling with its vaccination strategy, an effort hindered by partisan politics.

Children and adolescents are mostly spared by COVID-19, with few having severe symptoms

4

and even fewer dying.

However, the description of the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in

children reinforced that, although rare, severe clinical presentation and death is possible in the

5

pediatric population.

Multiple studies have associated the presence of underlying

comorbidities with severe clinical presentation and unfavorable outcomes in pediatric COVID-

6-8

19 patients,

however this association is less established than for adults. Additionally, it’s well

recognized that ethnic minorities and those with less favorable socioeconomic status (SES)

9,10

suffer a disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,

but this relationship hasn’t yet

been studied for children specifically.

To make sense of its interaction with noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and sociodemographic
vulnerabilities, COVID-19 has been proposed to be a part of a syndemic rather than a

11

pandemic.

The syndemic theory was developed in medical anthropology as a way to explain

how diseases can interact with each other, clustering in specific unfavorable socioeconomic
settings. It is based on the synergism of two or more health conditions and the underlying
socioeconomic inequality context. The combination of the conditions involved in a syndemic
worsens their individual health outcomes, moving beyond the multimorbidity model to study
how the socioeconomic and cultural factors promote these interactions.

12,13

In this study, we analyze a large dataset of COVID-19 hospitalized children and adolescents to
assess risk factors for mortality in this age group. We focused our attention on the impact of
NCDs and sociodemographic variables such as country region, socioeconomic development,
ethnicity, and age.

Methods
Study design and population
This is a cross-section observational study using publicly available data from the Brazilian

14

Ministry of Health. We analyzed the SIVEP-Gripe database,

which contains prospectively-

collected data from all patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) across the
country. In Brazil, the notification of SARS is mandatory, and all the registered cases are
included in the dataset. The reporting form is standardized and usually filled in the setting of

hospitalization. The studied data comprises all reported COVID-19 hospitalizations in Brazil, up
th

to December 7 , 2020. (appendix pg.1)

Brazil is divided into 26 states and the Federal District, and grouped in 5 macroregions: North,
Northeast, Central-west, Southeast, and South. For analytical purposes, we chose to divide the
country into two maximally contrasting regions: North (comprising the North and Northeast
macroregions) and South (comprising the Central-west, Southeast, and South macroregions).
This division was based on economic, health, and educational indexes, and is usual in
sociodemographic and economic studies of the Brazilian population. Previous literature on

15

COVID-19 in Brazil also divided the country in a similar way.

The Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) divides the Brazilian population in five
categories, based on self-reported skin color: Branco (White), Amarelo (East Asian), Preto
(Black), Indígeno (Indigenous), and Pardo.

16

Pardo refers to mixed and diverse ethnic

background, as a result of the intense miscegenation that characterizes Brazilian people. In late
2020, 46·4% of Brazilians identified themselves as Pardo, 44% as White, 8·6% as Black, and 1%

17

as East Asian or Indigenous.

GeoSES is a Brazilian composite SES index that incorporates education, poverty, mobility,
wealth, segregation, income, and deprivation of resources and services, generating a score for
each municipality ranging from -1 (less developed) to 1 (most developed) with good association

18

with the Human Development Index.

We used the GeoSES of the patient’s municipality as a

proxy of SES. It is important to note that in Brazil there is a considerable overlap between the
regional, ethnic, and socioeconomic variables mentioned above. (appendix pg.3)

To address NCDs, we retrieved data from the SIVEP-Gripe on previous comorbidities. The
dataset comprises the following conditions: cardiovascular disease, hematologic disease,
hepatic disease, asthma, diabetes, neurological disease, pulmonary disease,
immunodepression, kidney disease, obesity, Down Syndrome, and “other comorbidities”.
Therefore, most of the diseases are included in groups of diagnosis, rather than specific
conditions.

The rate of missing data or data reported as “unknown” varied among the variables: 1,385
(23·6%) patients had no ethnicity recorded and 166 (2·8%) did not have GeoSES data available.
Sex was unknown for one patient. For comorbidities, we chose to assume missing data as
absence of that comorbidity. (appendix pg.2)

Statistical analysis
Categorical variables were described using their absolute and relative frequency and
continuous variables using their mean and standard deviation. Distribution according to
outcome was initially analyzed through chi-square test (categorical variables), t-test
(continuous variables normally distributed) or Kruskal-Wallis rank test (continuous variables not
normally distributed).

Multilevel mixed-effects generalized linear models were built to calculate the odds ratio and
95% confidence intervals between exposure and outcome. We assumed the municipality where
the subject resided and the health unit where hospitalization occurred as random effects.
Crude analyses were followed by adjusted models for confounders (sex, age, GeoSES, ethnicity,
and country region), and by models accounting for interaction. Given the broad age range in
pediatrics, the final models were presented separately for those 10 years old or younger and
older than 10 years old.

Role of the funding source
This study received no funding.

Results
As of December 7th, the SIVEP-Gripe database included 1,000,024 patients. We filtered it by
age to only include patients less than 20 years old, finding a total of 79,498. Of that total, only
7,706 had a positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2, and 758 of them were not hospitalized. Out of the
6,948 remaining, the outcome was known for 5,857, the final population included in our
analysis (Figure 1).

Table 1 describes the sociodemographic and clinical features of the included patients. There
was an even distribution among sexes, both in hospitalization (51·4% male vs 48·6% female)
and in death rates. The mortality for age follows a U-shaped curve, with a higher death rate
among neonates and adolescents.

The North region accounted for 36% of the included patients, the same proportion of the
population living in the region. However, despite accounting for only one third of the
hospitalizations, this region concentrated 57% of the deaths. We found an overall mortality of
9·6% in the country, but it varied among regions, with a higher rate in the North. We also found
that although the distribution of cases among ethnicities roughly mirrors the population
distribution, some ethnicities have a higher mortality than others, notably Indigenous and
Pardo. Additionally, children who died lived in municipalities less socioeconomically developed
than those who survived (GeoSES -0·23 vs -0·058, p<0·001).

In order to provide a clear picture of the disease distribution, we analyzed the number of
hospitalizations and mortality state by state (Figure 2). São Paulo, the state with the largest
population, leads with 1,880 reported hospitalizations. However, proportionally to the total
th

state population, Sao Paulo was only the 4

in the country, after Sergipe, Pernambuco, and the

Federal District. Roraima, the least populated state in Brazil, had the highest mortality rate
(70·6%), a figure that needs to be interpreted with care due to the low number of cases
reported in the state. The states with the highest mortality rates were mostly concentrated in
the North, which corroborates our approach of dividing Brazil into two regions.

Analyzing NCDs prevalence, 39·6% of the children had at least one comorbidity, in the overall
studied population and for both regions equally. The most frequently reported NCDs among

hospitalized children with COVID-19 were asthma (7·8%) followed by immunodepression
(5·4%), and neurologic conditions (5·1%). Multiple NCDs were reported by 10·4%. The overall
mortality rate for children with NCDs was 15·8%, against 5·6% in healthy children. With the
exception of asthma, all comorbidities increased the rate of death, especially kidney disease
(29.2%) and cardiovascular disease (26.3%).

Assessing the odds ratio (OR) of mortality for all comorbidities and for cumulative
comorbidities, we found that almost all categories significantly increased the risk of death. The
exceptions were asthma, which appeared to be a protective factor (OR 0.42) in this population,
and hepatic diseases. Individually, cardiovascular disease was the category that presented the
highest effect on mortality (OR 4.98), followed by kidney disease, and immunosuppression.
Having two or more comorbidities increased almost tenfold the odds of death (Figure 3). It is
important to note that we excluded asthma when analyzing multiple comorbidities, since it’s
protective effect would reduce the magnitude of the association.

Our next step was to study how regionality, socioeconomic, and ethnic variables impact
mortality. Figure 4 illustrates the association between each of those factors and COVID-19
mortality in hospitalized children. We found that Pardo (OR 1·93), East Asian (OR 2·98) and
Indigenous ethnicities (OR 5·83) have significantly increased mortality figures when compared
to White. Analyzing regions, children in the North region had more than three times the risk of
death when compared to those in the South. SES, estimated by the GeoSES index, also showed
a significant correlation with mortality: children from cities in the middle third GeoSES group
had a 50% lower risk of mortality when compared to those in the lowest third. As for those in
more developed cities, the risk reduction was almost 75%.

To study the impact of all the aforementioned factors together on mortality, we developed five
models (Table 2). Model 1 accounts for the impact of having comorbidities (at least one –
asthma excluded) on mortality, adjusted for sex, and found an increase in the risk of death by
almost five times. Adjusting for sociodemographic variables (age group, ethnic, region, and
socioeconomic development – Model 2), similar results were found . Considering the possibility
of interaction between comorbidities and the sociodemographic factors (Model 3), the impact
of comorbidities in mortality is lower, but all the factors keep significance. Expanding the
analysis, we split the patients into two age groups: 10 years old or younger (Model 4), and older
than 10 years (Model 5). While the impact of NCDs appear to be more relevant for adolescents,
in children the sociodemographic factors are more important. Moreover, in adolescents sex
seems to be a relevant feature, with females having a 30% reduction in the risk of death,
although the 95% CI included the unity (p=0.055).

Finally, we compared the rate of NCDs in the studied population to the rate among the
deceased, for each sociodemographic category (Figure 5). It is clearly noticeable that in the
North region, in lower socioeconomic settings, and among ethnic minorities, a higher
proportion of healthy children died, even though the proportion of hospitalized children
without comorbidities is fairly similar for all categories. This is also true for the younger than 10
years, as in adolescence more than 70% of the deaths were in children with at least one NCD.

However, in the age categories we see a larger gap in NCDs prevalence, with a higher rate
among adolescents.

Discussion
This is, to our knowledge, the most comprehensive study on risk factors for mortality of
hospitalized children with COVID-19, covering both clinical and sociodemographic
characteristics in a large population. We described the higher risk of mortality associated with
having NCDs as well as among ethnic groups such as Indigenous and Pardo. We also found
regional and socioeconomic disparities associated with mortality in this specific population,
painting a broad picture of how these sociodemographic elements interact with NCDs to shape
mortality in COVID-19 hospitalized children.

We found significant differences in mortality rate when splitting age in groups to consider

19

previously described ages of potential risk, like neonates and older adolescents.

The higher

mortality in neonates might be related to the developing immune system, associated with an
immature respiratory system, resulting in them being more prone to severe complications of
lung infections. Adolescents, in turn, bear a higher burden of NCDs. Accordingly, in our
explanatory models, having at least one NCD increased the risk of death over five times for
adolescents, while for those younger than 10 years, the comorbidity effect was not significant.

The proportion of hospitalized children among the regions was consistent with the national
population, evidencing a uniform distribution of the disease. As we studied data up to
December, our results mirror a late stage of the pandemic in Brazil, with a widespread
distribution of COVID-19. The state reporting the highest number of hospitalized children with
COVID-19 was Sao Paulo. However, proportionally to population size, Sergipe, a small state in
the Northeast macroregion, with 20 times less people than Sao Paulo, and significantly lower
levels of socioeconomic development and health indicators, took the lead. These findings
reinforce the idea that COVID-19 is spreading especially among more vulnerable populations,
which can have catastrophic public health consequences. Two national serologic household
surveys also found inequalities in the prevalence of the disease, with a higher prevalence in
poorer areas and among minorities.

20

We found a high prevalence of NCDs (39·6%) in hospitalized children with COVID-19,

6-8

corroborating the findings of other studies.

Almost all the conditions studied individually

posed as risk factors for mortality, however, it was their association that stood out. Due to the
medical advances of the last decades, especially in newborn care and NCD treatments, we have
seen a significant rise in the prevalence of children with multiple chronic conditions and

21

medical complexity.

Our findings support the idea that this population is at a higher risk of

mortality, and deserves special attention with respect to preventive measures, including
vaccination.

Other than multiple comorbidities, indigenous ethnicity was the most important risk factor for
mortality in the population studied. Brazil is a country marked by discrimination and

governmental negligence against Indigenous populations, reflecting on shortcomings in
multiple socioeconomic and health indexes. Mortality for Indigenous children and adolescents,

22

for instance, is much higher than for non-Indigenous.

This setting of structural disadvantage

reflects on special vulnerability to diseases: in 2009, for example, the H1N1 influenza
devastated Indigenous tribes, with a mortality 4·5 times higher than the general Brazilian
population.

The current Brazilian political scenario makes matters even worse: deforestation

previous literature

20,23

Our data and

raise the alarm to a significantly higher risk of COVID-19 spreading and

mortality among Indigenous, prompting quick and decisive governmental intervention.

Besides Indigenous, we identified Pardo and East Asian ethnicities as risk factors for mortality.
In the early stages of the pandemic in Brazil, Marra and colleagues also found Pardo ethnicity as
a risk factor in adults, attributing it to a greater susceptibility of contracting COVID-19, reliance
on public health care, and reduced access to intensive care.

15

It is reasonable to assume that

Pardo children are subject to the same difficulties as adults, although the assessment of
pediatric intensive care unit availability is compromised by the lack of official data on the
subject. Additionally, Pardo and Black children also have higher general mortality rates when

22

compared to White,

mirroring generations of structural socioeconomic and health

disadvantages. Surprisingly, in our study, black ethnicity was not associated with a higher
mortality. The higher risk for East Asians is consistent with the findings of a recent meta-

25

analysis including more than 18 million patients of all ages.

The GeoSES index incorporates multiple social and economic dimensions, including variables

18

often neglected like mobility and segregation.

It is, therefore, a more comprehensive proxy

than the ones classically used, like the HDI. The analysis by GeoSES terciles clearly demonstrates
the abyss separating different levels of privilege in Brazilian society. It is appalling to see
children dying almost 4 times more in cities less socioeconomically developed. In the battle
against COVID-19, these children are clearly being left behind.

We also found a regional effect, with a higher mortality in Northern Brazil. Even in models
incorporating all the sociodemographic factors together, the correlation stands, showing that
there is a regional outcome discrepancy that is not explained by ethnicity or socioeconomic
development alone. Marra and colleagues also found this regional effect, attributing it to a

15

difference in health care availability and variation in number of comorbidities.

Since the North

region is less developed than the South, with worse health indexes, it is reasonable to assume
that health care is also less available for children. However, we could not find a clear difference
in the prevalence of comorbidities among regions. This finding must be interpreted cautiously,
as a lower availability of health care renders underdiagnosis more likely. We also expect that
children in Northern Brazil have a worse control of their chronic conditions, contributing to
poor outcomes.

While we found a fairly similar proportion of children without NCDs in both regions, among
different ethnicities and in the GeoSES terciles, the rate among the deceased varies remarkably.

There is a clear pattern of an excess of deaths in healthy children from less favorable
socioeconomic settings and among minorities. While this might be related to underdiagnosis, it
also raises an alarm for a possible failure of the Brazilian health system in protecting these
populations.

Approaching the COVID-19 as a syndemic rather than a pandemic helps understanding some of
the complex relations the disease has established with NCDs and sociodemographic features.
We propose that there is a syndemic between COVID-19 and NCDs in Brazilian children, driven
by large-scale socioeconomic forces that promote the concentration and interaction of these
conditions. For a syndemic to occur, there must be two epidemics interacting. Our findings
clearly show that the presence of NCDs worsens the outcomes of children with COVID-19,
especially when multimorbidity is present.

We have evidence that the opposite is also true: COVID-19 can have an impact on people with
NCDs, either increasing the risk of developing them or worsening their care. COVID-19, for
instance, can impair glucose metabolism and complicate preexisting diabetes or even have a

26

diabetogenic effect.

COVID-19 preventive strategies are based primarily on reducing social

contact, which might lead to increased exposure to NCDs risk factors, like tobacco use and
sedentarism. Furthermore, lockdowns have disrupted health care access for patients living with

27

chronic conditions, making disease management harder.

Our data reinforces the previously described idea that COVID-19 is spreading mainly through
vulnerable populations, with a higher prevalence in states in the Northern region. Many factors
might explain this higher transmissibility, like crowded living conditions and poor access to

20,25

public health measures and healthcare.

Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the

pandemic is clustering in vulnerable populations, driven by the major socioeconomic forces that
are determinant to health. Literature shows that NCDs also cluster in these same populations,
that are more exposed to risk factors like unhealthy diets, physical inactivity, and tobacco use.
This is also true for children, with the exposure to these factors starting in the womb and
continuing through life. The social determinants of health have a greater impact over children,
since they are not able to advocate for themselves, and are socially and economically

28

dependent on their caregivers.

Approaching COVID-19 as part of a syndemic invites a broader vision that goes beyond
biomedical solutions and encompasses the socioeconomic environment that promotes the
disease cluster and interaction with NCDs(11). Adequate treatment, preventive measures, and
vaccination are not enough: governmental intervention is necessary to address the challenge of
changing disparities structurally rooted in Brazilian society. Fortunately, Brazil has precedent on
this topic: the Bolsa Familia, a nationwide conditional cash transfer program that covers over

29

15 million families, has been shown to significantly reduce childhood mortality.

This example

illustrates how large governmental interventions tackling socioeconomic disparities can have a
positive impact on children’s health.

Our study had several limitations. Our analysis relied on secondary data, with case
ascertainment bias being a possibility. There was also a high rate of missingness for ethnicity,
which could imbalance the results if the missingness was differential for some groups, but no
evidence was found in literature to support this hypothesis. Ethnicity was defined on the basis
of self-declared skin color or appearance, rather than ancestry, and there’s a significant overlap
between the Pardo and Black categories. Underreporting is also an issue, especially in less
advantageous socioeconomic contexts, which might have underestimated the effect size in our
models. As for the SES analysis, using municipality development as a proxy for socioeconomic
status can hide major discrepancies within each city, especially in large metropolises.

We were not able to fully address healthcare availability by ethnicity, socioeconomic status,
and region, since our analysis was restricted to children only. Noticeably, the GeoSES index

18

does not include a health component in its dimensions.

Therefore, the different levels of

socioeconomic status derived from the index do not cover health access or morbidity and
mortality risks. We didn’t have data on out-of-hospital mortality, which might be substantial
especially in lower socioeconomic settings, possibly resulting in an underestimation of the
pandemic effect in these settings.

In conclusion, we have described how the presence of NCDs and sociodemographic
vulnerabilities can impact the mortality of hospitalized children and adolescents with COVID-19
in Brazil. We have found a higher risk of death associated with most of the NCDs included,
especially when more than one was present. Indigenous, Pardo and East Asian ethnicities, as
well as the Northern region and lower socioeconomic development were also risk factors for
mortality. Putting these findings together, we proposed a syndemic approach for COVID-19 and
NCDs in Brazilian children. Our findings are relevant for public health policy makers, as the
country is still planning its vaccination strategy and trying to find the best way to navigate the
health challenges imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

condition, the reference group was patients without such condition. The groups “1 comorbidity” and “>1 comorbidities” includes all the
aforementioned, Down syndrome and conditions disclosed as “other comorbidities”. Both categories exclude asthma, as asthma seems to

Table 2: Explanatory models for the relationship between sociodemographic factors and
mortality in hospitalized children with COVID-19 in Brazil. Results of multilevel mixed-effects
generalized linear models, with municipality and hospital as random effects. Model 1 considers exclusively the
impact of comorbidities (at least one, asthma excluded) in mortality, adjusted for sex. Model 2 includes adjustment
for sociodemographic factors (ethnicity, region, age and GeoSES). Model 3 expands Model 2, including the
assessment of possible interactions between comorbidities and sociodemographic factors. Models 4 and 5 are
equivalent to Model 3, filtering for age group (up to ten years old or older than ten years old, respectively). The
reference category for “comorbidity” was patients without previous conditions. OR: odds ratio. 95%CI: 95%
confidence interval.
