ABSTRACT
Introduction:

Some COVID-19 patients evolve to severe lung injury and systemic hyperinflammatory
syndrome triggered by both the coronavirus infection and the subsequent host-immune
response. Accordingly, the use of immunomodulatory agents has been suggested but still
remains controversial. Our working hypothesis is that methylprednisolone pulses and
tacrolimus may be an effective and safety drug combination for treating severe COVID-19
patients.
Methods and analysis:

TACROVID is a randomized, open-label, single-center, phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy
and safety of methylprednisolone pulses and tacrolimus plus standard of care (SoC) versus
SoC alone, in patients at advanced stage of COVID-19 disease with lung injury and systemic
hyperinflammatory response. Patients are randomly assigned (1:1) to one of two arms (42
patients in each group). The primary aim is to assess the time to clinical stability after
initiating randomization. Clinical stability is defined as body temperature ≤ 37.5ºC, and
PaO2/FiO2 > 400 and/or SatO2/FiO2 > 300, and respiratory rate ≤24 rpm; for 48 consecutive
hours.
Discussion:

Methylprednisolone and tacrolimus might be beneficial to treat those COVID-19 patients
progressing into severe pulmonary failure and systemic hyperinflammatory syndrome. The
rationale for its use is the fast effect of methylprednisolone pulses and the ability of
tacrolimus to inhibit both the CoV-2 replication and the secondary cytokine storm.
Interestingly, both drugs are low-cost and can be manufactured on a large scale; thus, if
effective and safe, a large number of patients could be treated in developed and developing
countries.

1. BACKGROUND:

In December 2019, an emerging disease (COVID-19), caused by a newly identified human
coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), was first recognized in Wuhan, China and spread worldwide [1,2].
The WHO declared the COVID-19 epidemic to be a pandemic on March 12, 2020 [3].
Unfortunately, there are still no proven effective and safe therapies for treating the COVID19 illness other than supportive care. Despite the lack of evidence, the urgency of care leads
to a large number of severe patients receiving off-label and compassionate use therapies,
based on their in vitro antiviral or immunomodulatory properties. Among suggested
treatments, the repositioning of older drugs may be a plausible strategy given that their
proven safety profile [4,5]. Furthermore, there are several ongoing randomized controlled
trials (RCTs) assessing different drug regimens for treating patients with COVID-19 [6].
Of great concern, some COVID-19 patients evolve to fatal lung injury and multi-organ failure
due to the serious inflammatory process triggered by the viral infection [7-12]. While the
use of some immunosuppressive drugs has been reported to be potentially harmful, other
such drugs, paradoxically, have been justified in treating the excessive inflammation
triggered by the viral infection [13]. Unfortunately, studies performed following pragmatic
randomized controlled trials (pRCT) are still very limited to date and current international
recommendations have not taken a position either in favor of or against the use of
immunomodulatory therapy in such patients.
Our working hypothesis is that methylprednisolone pulses and tacrolimus might be an
effective and safe drug combination strategy for severe COVID-19 patients. Accordingly,
given the rapid spread of COVID-19 and the current health emergency worldwide, we
performed a proof-of-concept study in a randomized, open-label, single-center, clinical trial
to evaluate the efficacy and safety of methylprednisolone and tacrolimus plus standard of
care (SoC), versus SoC alone, in severe COVID-19 patients with lung injury and systemic
hyperinflammatory syndrome.
The rationale for the present pRCT is based on the fact that glucocorticoids such as
methylprednisolone are a mainstay in the treatment of several immune-mediated disorders,
with multiple mechanisms of action involving both the humoral and cell-mediated arms of
immunity. As for tacrolimus, the rationale for its use is based on its specific mechanism of
action leading to an impaired lymphocyte function and a decrease in pro-inflammatory
cytokines (PIC) [14]. Interestingly, severe COVID-19 disease presents a fairly similar clinical
and cytokine profile to other diseases such as secondary hemophagocytic
lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH) [15] or clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis (CADM) associated
with anti-melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA-5), where calcineurin inhibitors
such as tacrolimus or cyclosporine play a central role in its treatment [16]. Furthermore,

some human coronavirus (CoV) replication depends on active immunophilin pathways,
which can be inhibited by tacrolimus, at low, non-cytotoxic concentrations in cell culture
[17]. In this regard, anecdotal case series suggest that tacrolimus may exert a protective
effect in solid organ transplanted patients affected by MERS-CoV [13]. Thus, tacrolimus has
an immunosuppressive effect but would also block viral replication and may have beneficial
impacts on severe COVID-19 lung injury.
2. METHODS:
2.1 Study design

TACROVID is a pragmatical, randomized (1:1), open-label, single-center, phase II clinical trial
to evaluate the efficacy and safety of methylprednisolone pulses and tacrolimus plus SoC,
versus SoC alone, in severe COVID-19 patients with lung injury and systemic
hyperinflammatory syndrome.
2.2 Population

randomization, if they meet all the inclusion criteria and there is no reason for exclusion.
Inclusion criteria:

1) COVID-19 infection confirmed by nasopharyngeal RT-PCR,
2) New pulmonary infiltrates (either by chest X-ray or computerized axial tomography),
3) Respiratory failure (PaO2 / FiO2 <300 or satO2 / FiO2 <220),
4) High analytical inflammatory parameters (CRP >100 mg/L, and/or D-Dimer >1000 µg/L

2.3 Setting

The TACROVID trial is being conducted at Bellvitge University Hospital (BUH), a 750-bed
tertiary care public hospital in Barcelona (Catalonia, Spain). BUH is the reference hospital for
high complexity patients from the Southern Area of Catalonia, a region of approximately 2
million inhabitants.
2.4 Randomization:

On day 0, patients are centrally and randomly assigned using the RedCap computer platform
that allows data collection and patient randomization. Patients are not stratified by baseline
variables. Participants are randomized in a 1:1 ratio into one of two study groups:
methylprednisolone pulses, tacrolimus and SoC, or SoC alone.
2.5 Treatment:

Patients are being randomly assigned to one of the following arms:
1. Experimental: methylprednisolone pulses of 120 mg/day are administered on 3
consecutive days (if not previously administered) and immediate release tacrolimus is
administered twice daily until clinical stability is achieved. Tacrolimus dosing is
individualized through therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) to achieve blood trough levels
of 8-10 ng/mL. In addition, patients in the experimental arm can receive standard of care
(SoC) for their management in accordance with treating physicians.
2. Control (SoC): SoC includes measures of supplemental oxygen and respiratory support,
fluid therapy, antipyretic treatment, postural measures, low molecular weight heparins,
and may also include other treatments, whether antiviral or immunosuppressive drugs,
or those necessary at the discretion of the treating physician, except for cyclosporine
and/or tacrolimus.
The experimental drugs start immediately after having been randomly assigned to this
group. The experimental treatment is discontinued after “clinical stability”, which is
achieved after fulfilling all of the following criteria for 48 consecutive hours: body
temperature ≤ 37.5ºC; PaO2/FiO2 > 400 and/or SatO2/FiO2 > 300; and respiratory rate ≤ 24
rpm.
Experimental treatment is also discontinued if the included patient has a severe or
potentially severe infection, required invasive mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal
membrane oxygenation (ECMO), or has any serious medication-related adverse event (of
special interest refractory HTA, decrease of more than 50% of the GFR compared to the
baseline, or ventricular tachycardia).

2.6 Study visits:

All patients are followed from day 0 through day +56 or death. The planned visits are: 1)
randomization visit (day 0) in which the patient is screened and eventually included in the
study; 2) Hospitalization visits that are variable according to the period of admission; 3)
Visits on day +28 ±3 and on day +56 ±3 from randomization. These visits are face-to-face to
evaluate whether patients present a relapse or worsening of the disease, as well as the
presence of adverse events or mortality. Specific procedures that are performed on each
visit are detailed in Table 1 and the evaluation methods section.

2.7 Evaluation Methods
2.7.1 Clinical parameters

The randomization visit (day 0) includes the collection of demographic variables [date of
birth, sex, ethnicity], weight and height, clinical data [symptoms onset date, hospital
admission date, clinical manifestations, radiological characteristics of pulmonary infiltrates],
comorbidities [smoking and alcohol consumption, Charlson index], functional and cognitive
assessment [Barthel and Pfeiffer index respectively], 8-point Ordinal scale
(https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04280705), vital signs [temperature, blood pressure,
heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen assessment and supply (type of oxygen mask and FiO2,
non-invasive or invasive ventilator support devices, or ECMO, PaO2/FiO2 and/or
SatO2/FiO2), and conscious level using the Glasgow Coma Scale], as well as concomitant
medication. With all these data we automatically calculate body mass index (BMI), the
Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) and CURB-65 index, and determine the extent of organ
failure (SOFA score). The hospitalization visits include the collection of vital signs, 8-point
Ordinal scale, adverse events and mortality. Visits on day +28 ±3 and +56 ±3 include vital
signs, ordinal scale, relapse or worsening of the disease, adverse events and mortality.
2.7.2 Tests and other procedures

A blood analysis is performed before starting the study treatment with the following
biomarkers: 1) hematology (hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, absolute lymphocyte
count, leukocyte count with differential) assessed using Sysmex® XN2000 analyzer (Sysmex
Europe GmbH; Norderstedt; Germany); 2) basic chemistry (creatinine, albumin, ALT, total
bilirubin) and inflammatory parameters (ferritin, D-dimer, CRP, LDH) measured with Cobas®
6000/8000 analyzer (Roche Diagnostics®, Risch-Rotkreuz, Switzerland), which has
spectrophotometry and immunochemistry modules with electrochemiluminescent
detection; and 3) coagulation (activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time and
fibrinogen) using ACLTOP® 550 analyzer (Werfen®; Barcelona, Spain). Furthermore, all
patient samples are collected, processed and stored at randomization, and weekly after
randomization by the BUH-IDIBELL Biobank following standard operating procedures. During
hospitalization, a blood analysis is performed 3 times a week with the same parameters as

used at randomization. Tacrolimus levels are measured using a method based on ultra-highperformance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLCMS/MS) [18].
The QTc interval is evaluated using an ECG before randomization, and an electrocardiogram
3 times a week is recommended during hospitalizations. All pulmonary tests performed
during hospitalization at the discretion of the treating physician are being collected (chest xRay CT scan). A chest CT scan, the six-minute walk test (6MWT) and functional respiratory
tests on day +56 ±3 follow-up visit are performed.
In addition, a follow-up oropharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR is performed on day +28 ±3 and
+56 ±3 visits. Blood viral load will be evaluated using quantitative RT-PCR to assess the
impact of immunosuppressive treatment on viral dynamics. Microbiological tests are being
carried out by the Microbiology Department at the BUH.
All samples will be sent to the Immunology Laboratory of the Biomedical Diagnostic Center
at the Clinic Hospital in Barcelona to perform a multiple cytokines quantification technique
by Luminex®. Concentration of the following cytokines will be analysed: IL-6, IL-18, CXCL10,
CXCL9, TNF-alpha, IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, IFN-gamma, IL1RA, IL1-beta, IL10 and IL-2R / CD25.
2.8 Outcomes:
2.8.1 Primary end point:

Average of days until clinical stability from treatment randomization
Treatment failure is defined as: 1) patient who does not meet the criteria for clinical stability
56 days after starting treatment; 2) patient presenting with a grade 3 or 4 adverse event
attributed to trial treatment; or 3) patient who dies after being included in the clinical trial.
2.8.2 Secondary endpoints:

- Days until normalization of each of the clinical parameters (body temperature,
PaO2/FiO2 and/or SatO2/FiO2, respiratory rate) from day +1 through day +56.
- Days until normalization of each of the analytic parameters (D-dimer, CRP, ferritin, LDH,
IL-6) from day +1 through day +56.
- Number of patients requiring non-invasive and invasive ventilatory support devices
during hospitalization.
- Clinical status according to the 8-point Ordinal scale from day +1 through day +56.
- Number of patients who reach a clinical status ≤ 2 after 10 days or hospital discharge,
whichever is first.
- Number of patients who reach clinical stability after 10 days or hospital discharge,
whichever is first.

- Value of each of the analytical values (D-dimer, CRP, ferritin, LDH, IL-6) after 10 days or
hospital discharge, whichever is first.
- Days with trial experimental treatment.
- Days until hospital discharge.
- Changes in blood quantitative viral load by RT-PCR before start treatment and weekly
during hospitalization.
- Changes in expanded cytokine profile before starting treatment and weekly during
hospitalization.
- Long-term efficacy (28 and 56 days after trial treatment initiation) measuring whether
clinical stability are maintained and the incidence of relapse of COVID-19 illness.
- Description of the radiological abnormalities (chest x-ray, chest CT scan, functional tests)
at day 56.
- Adverse events according to their severity and relationship to trial experimental
treatment.
- COVID-19 related mortality at day +28 and +56 after randomization.
- All-cause mortality at day +28 and +56 after randomization.

2.8.3 Criteria for withdrawing a patient from the study

Patients must be withdrawn from the study in any of the following situations: 1) any adverse
event for which clinicians consider it necessary to withdraw trial experimental therapy; 2)
the patient requests to be withdrawn from the study (at any time during the patient’s
participation); 3) the principal investigator (PI) considers that there has been a serious
protocol violation; 4) lost to follow-up; and 5) pregnancy during the study.
When a patient withdraws from the study, the investigator records the reason/s in the
clinical chart and the electronic case report form (eCRF). If the reason for withdrawal is a
serious adverse event, the patient must be followed-up until resolution or stabilisation of
the event. Patients who withdraw will not be replaced.
2.9 Statistical analysis
2.9.1 Determination of sample size:

The median time to clinical stability in the control group is expected to be 16 days. If the
hazard ratio of clinical stability of control patients in relation to the patients in the
experimental group were 0.52, it would be necessary to include 42 patients in each group in
order to be able to reject the null equality hypothesis with a power of 80%. The probability
of Type I error associated with this hypothesis test is 0.05 and includes 5% of withdrawal.

2.9.2 Statistical considerations:

A descriptive analysis of the study variables will be carried out. Continuous variables will be
described as mean and Standard Deviation (SD) or as median and range; and categorical
variables as absolute frequencies and percentages. The main analysis will be performed
when all patients reach clinical stability or failure. If patients are in hospital for 56 days, they
will be considered clinical failures. Comparison between average time to achieve clinical
stability between the two study groups will be measured using the log-rank test. To quantify
the degree of association, hazard ratio will be estimated with a Cox proportional hazards
model using a 95% confidence interval.
Efficacy analyses will be performed for the intention to-treat (ITT) population. If a
proportion of subjects >10% is detected to have relevant deviations from the protocol (for
example, non-compliance with the selection criteria, non-compliance or inability to receive
the trial treatment), the per protocol (PP) analysis will exclude those subjects with such
deviations. If this group is defined, all exploratory efficacy analyses will be repeated as a
sensitivity test.
As additional analysis, a Cox proportional hazards model, adjusted for clinically relevant
confounding factors such as age, sex, comorbidities using the Charlson index, indexes to
assess the severity of pneumonia (PSI and CURB-65), index of organic dysfunction (SOFA)
and inflammatory parameters will be performed. In addition, prespecified subgroup
analyses involving sensitivity analysis will be used to evaluate outcomes in patients not
receiving invasive mechanical ventilation.
For evaluation of secondary variables, we will calculate unadjusted and adjusted estimations
of effect size and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals using linear, logistic or
proportional hazards Cox regression. Study adverse events will be described according to
their severity and relationship with other treatments, and will be compared between
treatment groups. Midway through recruitment, i.e. 21 patients per arm, an intermediate
efficacy and safety analysis will be performed. For this, a correction of the type I error will
be applied following Lan-DeMets (O’Brien – Fleming) in evaluation of efficacy.
The IDIBELL Biostatistical Unit will perform analysis and analysts will be blind to the
treatment received by the patients (intervention vs. usual care). R version 3.6.2 or higher for
Windows (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, http://www.r-project.org) will be used for
data treatment and analysis.

2.10 Monitoring

An electronic case report form (eCRF) has been created using the RedCap computer
platform. IDIBELL Clinical Research and Clinical Trials Unit (UICEC-IDIBELL) is carrying out the
monitoring of the trial. Regular monitoring is performed by the UICEC IDIBELL according to
the ICH GCP. Compliance with the approved protocol and verification of data is evaluated
according to applicable regulatory requirements. The key data in the Monitoring Plan are
those related to informed consent, primary outcome, mortality and safety data.

2.11 Adverse events reporting and quantification
2.11.1 Definitions

: any injury related to medical management (including all aspects of
care) that occurs during the patient’s participation in the clinical trial will be considered
an adverse event. An adverse event may be related to the study medication or be nonrelated.

\

Adverse event (AE)

\

Adverse drug reaction (AR): any ‘adverse drug event’ that occurs when the medication is
used as directed and in the usual dosage will be considered an adverse drug reaction.

\ Serious AE (SAE) or serious AR (SAR) are considered to be those that at any dose:
- provoke death (Note: death is a possible evolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection);
- put patient’s life at risk;
- require the patient’s hospitalization or the extension of an existing hospitalization.
- cause permanent or significant disability or incapacity;
- cause a congenital anomaly or malformation;
- are considered medically relevant.
\ Adverse drug event of particular interest for the study: The investigator shall record in the
eCRF and communicate to the promoter, the AE that are considered of special interest as
soon as possible and no later than 15 days after he becomes aware of them. The AEs that
are considered of special interest are:
- refractory hypertension (defined as poor blood pressure control despite 3
antihypertensive drugs including a diuretic);
- renal impairment (decrease of more than 50% of the GFR compared to the baseline);
- ventricular tachycardia.
2.11.2 Reporting

The UICEC-IDIBELL is carrying out pharmacovigilance of the trial. All SAEs (including death),
regardless of their relationship with the investigational medications, have to be notified by
the investigator within 24h. The investigator has to make the notification via the SAE
Notification Form, sending it by email to the pharmacovigilance unit that will review it and,
if appropriate, will request additional information from the investigator. The investigator
will provide information to the promoter or pharmacovigilance unit whenever requested

and, in any case, when its initial evaluation changes regarding severity or causation.
Likewise, all additional information regarding the AE, until the end of the study or until its
definitive outcome, must be communicated without delay, via follow-up reports following
the notification procedure previously described.
In case of a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR), UICEC-IDIBELL will
report to the competent authorities. The sponsor will also report the development update
safety report (DSUR) once a year to the ethics committee and the Spanish Agency for Drugs
and Health Products (AEMPS).

2.12. Ethical considerations

This trial conforms to the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and
personal data protection as required by Spanish law (LOPD 3/2018). The protocol and
informed consent form (ICF) were approved by the BUH’s Ethical Committee for Drug
Research (EC) and by the Spanish Agency for Drugs and Health Products (AEMPS) in March
2020, in accordance with current legislation, Royal Decree 1090/2015 of December 4 and
European Regulation 536/2014 of April 16, regulating clinical trials with drugs. The study
received the ethics approval by the Research Ethics Committee of Bellvitge University
Hospital (AC010/20).
The patient, his or her closest legal or family representative (in case of incapacity due to the
severity of the clinical situation) has to accept the ICF. As patients with COVID-19 can infect
researchers via the ICF document, patients can consent orally with a witness, and this is
documented in the patient’s medical history. If the legal representative or a close relative is
in quarantine due to COVID-19 quarantine, informed consent is provided orally by
telephone and documented in the patient's medical history. The written ICF is obtained
when the patient or his/her closest legal or family representative are able to give consent,
as they are not quarantined.

2.12. 1 Protocol amendments

The protocol was approved by the EC and the AEMPS on March 31, 2020, in a process of
authorization adapted to the pandemic situation and based on a protocol synopsis (March
28, 2020). A substantial amendment to the original protocol was submitted to the EC and
the AEMPS in accordance with Spanish legislation, and accepted on April 9, 2020. We
decided to reduce tacrolimus plasma levels from 10-15 to 8-10 ng/mL and not to maintain
corticosteroids by protocol beyond the three pulses of methylprednisolone in the
experimental group. In addition, some exclusion criteria were added, such as glomerular
filtration ≤ 30 mL / min / 1.73m2, leukopenia ≤ 4000 cells / µL or other conditions that cause
immunosuppression, and concomitant and potentially serious infections. Another additional
amendment was accepted by the EC and AEMPS on May 25, 2020, including a complete
clinical study protocol with new secondary key outcomes (8-point Ordinal scale and
radiological abnormalities) that are being analysed in several COVID-19 clinical trials. These
outcomes are being prospectively reported in the trial's eCRF, but were not reported in the
protocol synopsis. We do not remove any of the previous key study outcomes.

2.13 Publication plans

The trial is currently actively recruiting patients. Completion of patient recruitment is
expected for Q3-Q4 of 2020. The sponsor commits itself to publishing the data within 12
months of completion of the study. Results will be analysed and reported in accordance
with CONSORT guidelines.

3. DISCUSSION

Clinically, COVID-19 patients can evolve into 3 stages of progressive severity. Viral
incubation and early establishment of the disease are the predominant components in the
first week from the onset of symptoms. In the second stage, viral replication and transition
into moderate acute lung involvement are the most important components. The third and
most advanced stage manifests as severe pulmonary injury and systemic multi-organ failure,
resulting from cytokine storm and systemic hyperinflammatory response. Older age,
comorbid chronic conditions, elevated body mass index, lymphopenia, and elevated
transaminases, LDH, D-dimer, ferritin, and soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R) on admission are
some of the reported risk factors associated with higher mortality [7-12]. From a

pathological viewpoint, two different pathological mechanisms appear to coexist in the
COVID-19 illness; the first, triggered by the virus itself, and the second, by the host-immune
response. Accordingly, a two-step sequence of antiviral and anti-inflammatory drug
administration has been proposed, regarding the natural 3-stage evolution of COVID-19
disease [19].
Despite randomized clinical trials (RCTs) being the only way to find effective and safe
treatments, very limited available RCTs for treating COVID-19 have been reported to date
[20]. Given the emergency situation, most patients are receiving compassionate, unproven
therapies to avoid clinical progression into severe advanced stages where host-immune
inflammatory response is the most important component [21].
Several studies demonstrate that cells infected by coronavirus (CoV) produce elevated levels
of PICs in order to tackle the invading virus. The overproduced PICs may cause immunomediated damage to the lungs and other organs, resulting in severe lung injury and systemic
hyperinflammatory syndrome [22]. Once this excessive inflammatory response has been
triggered, it may self-perpetuate in some patients despite a decrease in the CoV viral load.
So, it may be necessary to add "anti-inflammatory" treatments such as corticosteroids, antiIL-6 or anti-IL-1 inhibitors, Janus kinase (Jak) inhibitors, polyclonal immunoglobulins, etc. to
reduce the secondary deleterious inflammatory response triggered by the virus [6].
In this regard, glucocorticoids appear as a key first-line option, especially given their
worldwide availability and cost. However, their use has been controversial in patients with
SARS-CoV, MERS-Cov or influenza infections. On the one hand, intravenous steroid use has
been associated with delayed elimination of coronaviruses in the blood and lungs of
patients with MERS-CoV [23] and SARS-CoV [24], and steroids associated with an increased
risk of mortality and adverse events in influenza patients [25-27]. On the other hand, a
Cochrane review of glucocorticoids as adjunctive therapy in influenza found evidence of low
quality due to confounding by indication [28], and there are some series which suggest
improvement of severe COVID-19 lung injury after administration of steroids [8,10].
Furthermore, a small retrospective observational study conducted in China [29] suggests the
efficacy of tocilizumab (an IL-6 inhibitor) in the treatment of 21 COVID-19 patients with
severe pneumonia and high IL-6. But tocilizumab can cause even deeper
immunosuppression than steroids, increasing the risk of sepsis, bacterial pneumonia,
gastrointestinal perforation, and hepatotoxicity [20]. Another drawback of tocilizumab is its
shortage in some hospitals worldwide and its high cost to national health systems.
Interestingly, IL-1 blockade has shown particular promise in cytokine storm syndrome and
high-dose regimens have been shown safe even in the context of overt sepsis [30].
Emapalumab (anti-IFNγ) is FDA-approved for HLH and may be effective in COVID-19
inflammatory phase. JAK inhibition appears promising; however, the safety of this

medication in severe viral infection remains unknown. Accordingly, some ongoing RCTs are
studying glucocorticoids and blockage of IL-1, IL-6, and IFNγ in COVID-19 [6]. However, at
the end of April 2020, no trials assessing calcineurin inhibitors, whether tacrolimus or
cyclosporine, had been registered either at www.clinicaltrials.gov nor EU Clinical Trials
Register, thus prompting us to carry out the present investigation.
Given the scarcity of medical reports supporting the use of immunosuppressive therapy in
severe COVID-19, the TACROVID trial was initiated on March 29, 2020. The study is a
pragmatical, randomized, open-label, single-center, phase II clinical trial to evaluate the
effectiveness and safety of methylprednisolone and tacrolimus in combination regimen plus
SoC, versus SoC alone, in COVID-19 with severe lung injury and systemic hyperinflammatory
syndrome. We decided to consider methylprednisolone pulses for their rapid onset of
action, combined with the ability of tacrolimus to inhibit both the multiple PICs, and the
SARS-CoV replication in cell cultures. Moreover, the rationale of our study is aligned with an
Ovid MEDLINE review article [13] searching for current evidence for immune-suppressing or
stimulating drugs to treat COVID-19, which concludes that low-dose methylprednisolone
and tacrolimus may have a beneficial impact in such COVID-19 populations.
Tacrolimus has been administered for decades to prevent allograft rejection in transplanted
patients as well as to treat patients with severe autoimmune diseases, and it has a wellknown safety profile. In addition, it is a low-cost drug and can be manufactured on a large
scale. Thus, if tacrolimus is effective in treating the inflammatory process triggered by
COVID-19, a large number of patients could be treated in developed and developing
countries. Despite the fact that tacrolimus has been shown to be safe for other diseases, we
[researchers] are particularly aware of the possible occurrence of associated AE throughout
the present TACROVID trial. In this respect, most patients in the advanced stage of the
COVID-19 illness are currently given on immunosuppressive treatment and it is well-known
that this facilitates certain opportunistic infections, making it difficult to attribute them to
one particular drug. Moreover, the drawback of tacrolimus is that it may interact with some
antiviral treatments used in COVID-19 (especially Lopinavir). Finally, tacrolimus is started
when patients transition into the most severe clinical stage which, in turn, facilitates the
occurrence of AE.
Interestingly, in addition to its immunomodulatory effect, tacrolimus has been also reported
to show certain in vitro activity against different human coronaviruses, inhibiting viral
replication through immunophilins, although its efficacy and safety have not been assessed
in clinical practice. For this reason, an interim analysis will be conducted when half of
patients (21 per arm) will be recruited in order to measure the basal and weekly viral load,
and the potential AE related to immunosuppression.

Regarding the study design, the present trial was not designed as a double-blind trial. This
was considered unrealistic given the emergency situation and the extensive workload that it
would involve for the hospital pharmacy service. For the above-mentioned reasons, the
TACROVID trial was designed as an open study which allows the use of all drugs that treating
physicians prescribe, even without clear evidence to support their use. To minimize the
impact of an open study, the primary end-point “time to clinical stability”, is based on
objective, quantitative measures for 48 consecutive hours: body temperature, and
PaO2/FiO2 and/or SatO2/FiO2, and respiratory rate. Likewise, the statistician performing
analysis is blind to the treatment that patient receives (experimental vs control).
Cytokine measurement throughout the trial can reveal new available information on COVID19 evolution and potential new treatment targets. IFNγ and IL-1β are very relevant cytokine
in MAS, but they are not easily assessed in the peripheral blood. CXCL9, a stable chemokine,
is a useful surrogate for IFNγ activity in MAS, as are IL-18 and IL-1RA for IL-1β. Thus, in this
trial we will not only analyse how the cytokine profile evolves after treatment with
tacrolimus, but we will also be able to detect increases in cytokines that can also be treated
by other proven specific inhibitors (e.g. IL-18 with Tadekinig alpha, IFNγ with Emapalumab).
In summary, the TACROVID trial assesses the combined use of tacrolimus and
methylprednisolone, in addition to the standard of care in patients with severe COVID-19
illness. The aim is to evaluate both the beneficial effect of tacrolimus on controlling viral
replication and, in combination with methylprednisolone pulses, modulating the hostimmune inflammatory response triggered by the virus. In addition, potential adverse events
related to this immunosuppressive therapy are carefully followed-up throughout the
investigation. The results of the present trial might encourage further RCTs to assess the
efficacy and safety of new antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs regimens, in sequential
combination, at earlier clinical stages of COVID-19.
