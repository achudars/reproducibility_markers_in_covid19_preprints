Using ICU data to improve the real-time estimation of the effective
reproductive number of the COVID-19 epidemic in 9 European countries

1. Summary
We replicate a recent study by the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team (Flaxman
et al, 2020) that estimates both the effective reproductive number, Rt, of the current
COVID-19 epidemic in 11 European countries, and the impact of different
nonpharmaceutical interventions that have been implemented to try to contain the
epidemic, including case isolation, the closure of schools and universities, banning of
mass gatherings and/or public events, and most recently, widescale social distancing
including local and national lockdowns. The main indicator they use for measuring the
evolution of the epidemic is the daily number of deaths by COVID-19 in each country,
which is a better statistic than the number of identified cases because it doesn’t depend
so much on the testing strategy that is in place in each country at each moment in time.
We improve on their estimation by using data from the number of patients in intensive
care, which provides two advantages over the number of deaths: first, it can be used to
construct a signal with less bias: as the healthcare system of a country reaches saturation,
the mortality rate would be expected to increase, which would bias the estimates of Rt and
of the impact of measures implemented to contain the epidemic; and second, it is a signal
with less lag, as the time from onset of symptoms to ICU admission is shorter than the
time from onset to death (on average, 7.5 days shorter). The intensive care signal we use
is not just the number of people in ICU, as this would also be biased if the healthcare
system has reached saturation (in this case, biased downwards, as admissions are no
longer possible when all units are in use). Instead, we estimate the daily demand of
intensive care, as the sum of two components: the part that is satisfied (new ICU
admissions) and the part that is not (which results in excess mortality).
Thanks to the advantages of this ICU signal in terms of timeliness and bias, we find
that most of the countries in the study have already reached R t<1 with 95%
confidence (Italy, Spain, Austria, Denmark, France, Norway and Switzerland, but not
Belgium or Sweden), whereas the original methodology of Flaxman et al (2020), even

2. The COVID-19 intensive care signal
We construct an indicator of demand of intensive care by combining the number of deaths
by COVID-19 with the number of admissions into intensive care and what is known about
the time of evolution of the disease.
Bhatraju et al (2020) describes the distribution of time in intensive care and final result
(death or discharge) for 24 patients in the region of Seattle. According to this data, the
mortality rate among ICU patients is 50%, with the distribution of daily probabilities of
death and discharge that we present in figure 1. It must be recognized, though, that there
is great uncertainty around these estimates: Wei-jie Guan et al (2020), using data from 55
ICU patients in several Chinese hospitals until 29th of January of 2020, estimates a
mortality rate of 20%, whereas Fei Zhou et al (2020) estimates a mortality rate of 78%
using data from 50 ICU patients from two hospitals in Wuhan before 31 st January 2020.
The aggregation of all of these results would lead an estimated mortality rate of 48%,
close to the one reported by Bhatraju et al (2020), which in any case is the one we use
because it includes the full distribution of times from ICU admission to death or discharge.

Using this distribution and the number of COVID-19 patients in intensive care, we can
estimate the number of deaths coming from ICU patients, and compare this with the total
number of deaths in each country to calculate, through this excess mortality, the demand
for intensive care that has not been met. For this we assume that patients in need of
intensive care that could not get admission into ICU will die in the following two days. Two
facts allow us to confidently make this assumption: first, an extremely high mortality rate is
to be expected for this group, as patients that get intensive care already face a 50%
mortality rate; and second, we know this happens very fast, because in Spain, whose
healthcare system has been saturated during the epidemic (as of today, 10,468 people
have received intensive care and 16,353 people have died) average time from onset of
symptoms to ICU admission and from onset of symptoms to death is basically identical: 8
vs 9 days, with interquartile ranges of 5-10 and 5-12 respectively1. Given this information,
it seems like a reasonably conservative assumption.
The estimation is done through a simple inflow-outflow model of the number of people in
intensive care (see appendix), using the lag distribution of Bhatraju et al (2020). In the case

of Spain, this is done separately by region and then aggregated, as different regional
governments publish numbers of ICU patients in terms of prevalence (people in ICU today)
or cumulative figures (total number of people that have been in ICU until today).
This signal provides information about the evolution of the epidemic with an approximate
lag of 14.5 days: average time from contagion to death (20 days), minus average time from
ICU admission to death (7.5 days), plus two days of extra lag because of the assumption
about the mortality of patients in need of intensive care but not receiving it. It is therefore a
more timely indicator than the number of deaths, which has an approximate lag of 20
days. But it also adequately models the change in that information lag as the epidemic
progresses and the healthcare system becomes saturated: when a higher portion of
patients requiring critical care is unable to receive it, the time from contagion to death
shortens. The mechanical ICU inflow-outflow model also provides information about how
saturated the healthcare system is in each country.

Figure 2 presents the results of this estimation of the demand of intensive care in nine
European countries: those included in the paper by Flaxman et al (2020), minus United
Kingdom and Germany, that don’t publish the necessary information about people in
intensive care. Additionally, the data for France only includes deaths in hospitals, as the
figures for deaths in retirement homes has been published late and without the necessary
detail about date of death. The figures separate the two components (met and unmet
demand) and therefore show the different degrees of saturation of the healthcare systems
in different countries. According to this, Italy has been able to meet a lower share of the
demand for intensive care than other countries, including Spain, probably because the
epidemic has been more concentrated (Lombardy represents 52% of the ICU demand in
Italy, whereas the region of Madrid represents 36% of the demand in Spain). On the other
extreme, results for countries such as Austria, Denmark and Norway show that they have
been able to provide intensive care to almost all the COVID-19 patients that required it, in
part because the epidemic reached a smaller relative size. The case of France, which has
both a large epidemic and high coverage rate, is probably an artefact of the exclusion of
deaths in retirement homes in the data.
3. Estimations of the effective reproductive number using ICU data
Now we plug the intensive care demand indicators presented in the previous section into
the model of Flaxman et al (2020). Their codes are kept unchanged, including the
database of nonpharmaceutical interventions implemented in each country, but our ICU
indicator is used instead of the number of deaths (and the probability distribution that
represents the time between the onset of symptoms and this event is reduced
accordingly, i.e. we use a gamma distribution with a mean that is reduced by 7.5 days and
coefficient of variation that is not altered).
The model estimates the effect of the nonpharmaceutical interventions that have been
applied in these countries as a shift in the effective reproductive number that determines
the rate of growth of the epidemic. Within the model, no other factors can affect R t apart
from these interventions.
Figure 3 presents the results of this time-varying estimation of Rt in each country. The first
column replicates the original results with the original data (including also United Kingdom
and Germany, even if they are not plotted in the figure). The second column updates the
database and excludes United Kingdom and Germany, that don’t publish the necessary
ICU data. And finally the third uses the model based on ICU demand.
A result of Rt <1 with 95% confidence means that the interventions are enough to make
the epidemic recede: instead of growing, it is becoming smaller every day. When Flaxman
et al (2020) published their results, it was too early to conclude that this was the case in
any of the countries considered. Updating the database with data available on the 12th of
April delivers an estimation of Rt <1 with 95% confidence in Italy and Switzerland, but not
in the others: in most countries the estimation is inconclusive, with most of the mass of
probability for Rt below 1 but some significant amount above 1 as well. Using the
intensive care demand indicator allows the estimation to conclude that we have
reached Rt<1 in 7 of the 9 countries considered: Italy, Spain, Austria, Denmark,
France, Norway and Switzerland (but not Belgium or Sweden).

indicator that we want to calculate: the number of people who would need ICU admission
at time t.
Let Dt be the number of COVID-19 patients who die at time t, and Ďt the estimation of the
