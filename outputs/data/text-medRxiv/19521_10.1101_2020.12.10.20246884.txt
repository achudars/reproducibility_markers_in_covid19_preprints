Abstract
Background. SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19, which emerged in China in late 2019, rapidly spread across the
world causing several million victims in 213 countries. Switzerland was severely hit by the virus, with
43’000 confirmed cases as of September 1st, 2020.
Aim. In cooperation with the Federal Office of Public Health, we set up a surveillance database in
February 2020 to monitor hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in addition to their mandatory reporting
system.
Methods. Patients hospitalised for more than 24 hours with a positive PCR test, from 20 Swiss hospitals,
are included. Data collection follows a custom Case Report Form based on WHO recommendations and
adapted to local needs. Nosocomial infections were defined as infections for which the onset of symptoms
started more than 5 days after the patient’s admission date.
Results. As of September 1st, 2020, 3645 patients were included. Most patients were male (2168 59.5%),and aged between 50 and 89 years (2778 - 76.2%), with a median age of 68 (IQR 54-79).
Community infections dominated with 3249 (89.0%) reports. Comorbidities were frequently reported:
hypertension (1481 - 61.7%), cardiovascular diseases (948 - 39.5%), and diabetes (660 - 27.5%) being the
most frequent in adults; respiratory diseases and asthma (4 -21.1%), haematological and oncological
diseases (3 – 15.8%) being the most frequent in children. Complications occurred in 2679 (73.4%)
episodes, mostly for respiratory diseases (2470 - 93.2% in adults, 16 – 55.2% in children), renal (681 –
25.7%) and cardiac (631 – 23.8%) complication for adults. The second and third most frequent
complications in children affected the digestive system and the liver (7 - 24.1%). A targeted treatment was
given in 1299 (35.6%) episodes, mostly with hydroxychloroquine (989 - 76.1%). Intensive care units stays
were reported in 578 (15.8%) episodes. 527 (14.5%) deaths were registered, all among adults.
Conclusion. The surveillance system has been successfully initiated and provides a very representative
set of data for Switzerland. We therefore consider it to be a valuable addition to the existing mandatory
reporting, providing more precise information on the epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical course of
these cases.

Introduction
With almost 27 million confirmed infections, of which 70.5% recovered, and more than 850’000 deaths
[1], the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)/ Coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) pandemic has had a massive impact on all aspects of everyday life; including politics, travels,
and economics. The virus was initially identified in a cluster of Chinese adult patients with pneumonia of
unknown cause [2] incriminating a large seafood and animal market in Wuhan City as the source of the
outbreak; but rapidly spread via person-to-person transmission. Since then, 213 countries and territories
have been affected [3].
On January 30th 2020, the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the outbreak a Public Health
Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). WHO emphasized the urgent need to coordinate
international efforts to investigate and better understand this novel coronavirus, to minimize the threat
in affected countries and to reduce the risk of further international spread [4]. WHO designed various
study protocols for early investigation of the outbreak, including a global Anonymized Clinical Data
Platform (the “nCoV Data Platform”) to enable State Parties of the International Health Regulations (IHR)
(2005) to share with WHO anonymized clinical data and information related to patients with suspected or
confirmed infections with the disease (collectively “Anonymized nCoV Data”) [5].
The first patient with COVID-19 in Switzerland was reported on February 25th, 2020, in the canton of
Ticino, earlier than in most European countries due to its proximity and cross-border commuting with
Italy. In order to prevent and monitor the spread of the disease in Switzerland, suspicion of COVID-19
cases by clinicians were reported to the Federal Office of Public Health (hereafter FOPH) through an
obligatory declaration form [6]. The number of confirmed cases rose rapidly to more than 8000 positive
cases and 66 deaths within only a month after the start of the epidemic in Switzerland. Compared to its
neighbour countries, Switzerland has similarly suffered from the pandemic with a cumulative incidence of
496.5 confirmed cases per 100’000 habitants (Germany - 264.7, France - 449.9, Italy - 448.4) but with an
overall lower cumulative death incidence of 200.9 deaths per 1’000’000 inhabitants (Germany - 111.6,
France - 471.2, Italy - 586.2) as of September 4th, 2020 [7].
Early analysis and preparations for the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic in Switzerland by officials,
including identification of risk groups and forecasting, were based on Chinese data. However, the Chinese
population differs from the Swiss population, and such models were therefore misleading and inaccurate.
Based on our experience with the hospital-based surveillance of influenza cases in Switzerland [8] and in
collaboration with the FOPH, we developed a surveillance system of hospitalised COVID-19 cases in early
February. We aim to:
1. Test the adaptability of the influenza system to other infectious diseases and quantify the
workload to be able to react faster to future epidemics.
2. Monitor the evolution of hospitalised COVID-19 cases in Switzerland, alongside the mandatory
reporting system.
3. Provide a reliable, harmonized, in-depth dataset for hospitalised COVID-19 cases in Switzerland
that can be used for decision-making and public health purposes.
The aim of the current manuscript is to present a profile of patients hospitalised with COVID-19 during
the first epidemic wave in Switzerland.

Study design and procedures
Inclusion
The study was designed to capture most of the severe COVID-19 cases in Switzerland by including
hospitalised patients from 20 large cantonal and university hospitals. To ease the process and to minimize
the time of developing the system, we first contacted the participating hospitals of the Influenza pilot
surveillance system [8]; seven of which agreed to participate (Hôpitaux Universitaires de Genève,
Kantonsspital St Gallen, Ospedaliero Cantonale Ticino, Hôpital du Valais, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire
du Canton de Vaud, Universitätsspital Zürich, Universitäts-Kinderspital Zürich). Since patients were more
likely to be sent to large hospitals with more capacity and means to treat a novel disease, the system also
captures patients from other large university and cantonal hospitals which agreed to participate:
Universitätsspital Basel, Inselspital Bern, Kantonsspital Graubünden, Luzerner Kantonsspital (including
Kinderspital Luzern), Spitäler Schaffhausen Kantonsspital, Thurgau Hospital Group, and smaller cantonal
hospitals (Hôpital de Fribourg, Kantonsspital Aarau, Kantonsspital Winterthur, Kantonsspital Nidwalden,
and Klinik Hirslanden Zürich). Three of the smaller hospitals (Fribourg, Aarau, and Winterthur) only
contributed with paediatric cases. We also included three paediatric hospitals, separate from their adult
counterparts: Universität Kinderspital Basel, Ostschweizer Kinderspital, and Kinderspital Zürich. The
Kantonsspital St. Gallen also included cases from all public hospitals of the canton: they were included by
the identical infection control team.
Patients, regardless of age or gender, with a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed COVID-19
diagnosis who were hospitalised for more than 24 hours, were included in the database. The data were
collected by infection control specialists or other physicians, dedicated study nurses, or medical students
of the participating centres under the supervision of physicians and stored anonymously in a secure
REDCap database [9] located in the Clinical Research Center of the University Hospitals of Geneva. Data
entry started on March 1st, 2020 and is still ongoing. Data were also collected retrospectively.

Questionnaire
Data are collected based on the Case Report Form (CRF) developed for the Influenza surveillance pilot [8]
with relevant COVID-19 additions. This CRF is split in two parts: the compulsory part contains inclusion
criteria, demographics, case declaration (classification, date of detection and date of symptoms,
laboratory sample information), admission details (hospitalisation ward, origin of patient, severity at
admission), and follow-up forms. The optional part describes the patient’s stay in more detail with
description of complications, intensive/intermediate care stays, treatment, and risk factors in a clinical
complementary information form. The CRF is added as supplementary material.
Since the system was put in place when movement and contact tracing became difficult, we only selected
part of the recommended WHO COVID-19 CRF [10] and of the FOPH obligatory declaration form [6]. We
therefore removed any information about travels to foreign countries or ethnicity. We, however, kept
employment in healthcare facilities as an important risk factor. The follow-up and daily forms of the WHO
CRF were deemed too time consuming to retrieve by participating hospitals, and were therefore discarded
in favour of the influenza CRF structure. Complications and underlying medical conditions (UMC) were
also similar to the Influenza CRF with small additions to conditions shown to be of importance either as
risk factors (e.g. hypertension, angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor treatments, obesity), or as

consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 infection (acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),
thrombosis/embolism). To assess the severity of the disease at admission, we also added the CURB-65
score [9] for adults, and a similar severity score for children based on the expertise of the participating
paediatric infectious disease specialists. Finally, we classified cases as community-acquired or nosocomial,
by defining nosocomial cases to be cases for which the onset of symptoms started more than 5 days after
the patient’s admission date. This time limit was to account for the incubation time for the virus.
As a surveillance tool and because of the rapid growth of the epidemic, basic epidemiological information
had to be reported within 48h, comprising at minimum the inclusion criteria, demographics, and case
declaration forms in order to report the new cases and their location with little delay. Additional
information on the hospitalisation itself (admission, follow-up, and clinical information) were filled as soon
as possible depending on the severity of the epidemic and local issues.
The database records entries as COVID-19 episodes rather than per patient, with the possibility to link
two episodes. A new episode was defined if a patient was readmitted into hospital more than 30 days
after their previous discharge. If a transfer between hospitals occurred, a new record was created in the
destination hospital. The database and the CRF implementation were tested by the participating sites at
the time of deployment and tweaked following their feedback. Small additional changes were made as
the database was already in production when new information about the disease became available (e.g.
thrombosis/embolism).
The data presented in this manuscript were extracted on August 31st, 2020. The week used in the figures
of this manuscript is the week of interest for the system, defined as the week of the sample collection
date (equivalent to the diagnosis) for nosocomial cases or the week of admission into the hospital for
other cases.

Characteristics of patients
Demographics
As of August 31st, 2020, 3650 episodes in 3645 patients have been recorded in the database, with 66
patients having been hospitalised more than once for the same episode. Figure 1 shows the age and
gender distribution of patients in the database and Table 1 shows their baseline characteristics. Overall,
2168 (59.5%) patients were male and 1477 (40.5%) female, and the median age was 68 years (IQR 54-79).
Most were aged between 50 and 89 years (2778 – 76.2%), followed by patients between 40 and 49 years
(299 – 8.2%), patients between 90 and 99 years (215 – 5.9%), and patients between 30 and 39 years (185
– 5.1%). Among children, patients between 13 and 19 years and patients between a month and less than
a year are dominant, with 24 (0.7%; 35.3% of all children) and 23 (0.6%; 33.8% of all children) patients
respectively.
The majority of episodes were community acquired (3249 - 89.0%) while 349 (9.6%) were nosocomial
acquired or of unknown source (52 - 1.4%). Nosocomial cases were found less often in children (4.4% of
all episodes in children versus 9.7% of all episodes in adults). Figure 2 shows the evolution in the number
of episodes throughout the epidemic. The first episodes were recorded in week 2020-09, followed by a

rapid rise to about 900 episodes in week 2020-13 before decreasing and stagnating from week 2020-20
onwards to a few episodes declared. A small increase in week 2020-25 was observed. At the time of
writing, the number of new cases stabilised to around 30 per week.

Potential risk factors for COVID-19
The risk factors recorded, categorised into comorbidities (typically, chronic diseases), pregnancy status
for women, and history of smoking are split by age group for adults and children in Table 2 and 3
respectively. The Charlson Index [12] was used to calculate an overall risk score which median value was
3.0 (IQR 1-6) for both the overall and adult patients. This score had a median value of 0.5 (IQR 0-1.75)
among children.
In adults, comorbidities were recorded for 2401 (67.0%) episodes, and 1884 were recorded to have more
than one comorbidity. Among those, hypertension was the most frequent comorbidity, with 1481 (61.7%)
occurrences, followed by chronic cardiovascular diseases (948 - 39.5%) and diabetes (660 - 27.5%).
Chronic respiratory diseases were reported in 515 (21.4%) episodes, renal disease in 500 (20.8%) episodes,
and neurological impairment in 386 (16.1%) episodes. Oncological pathologies (315 – 13.1%), asthma (204
– 8.5%), dementia (198 - 8.2%), liver diseases (144 - 6.0%), and immunosuppression (128 – 5.3%) were
registered less often, and other comorbidities were only observed sporadically (<5%). The information
about comorbidities was missing for 574 (16.0%) episodes among adults.
In children, comorbidities were recorded for 19 (27.9%) episodes and 9 were recorded to have more than
one comorbidity. Respiratory diseases and asthma were the most frequent comorbidities in 4 (21.1%)
episodes each, followed by haematological and oncological pathologies (3 – 15.8%), renal and liver
diseases alongside neurological impairment and immunosuppression (2 – 10.5%). Finally, diabetes,
hypertension, and cardio-vascular diseases were accounted in one (5.3%) episode. The information about
comorbidities was missing for 7 (10.3%) episodes in children.

Complications
Tables 2 and 3 further show lists of complications encountered in COVID-19 episodes in adults and
children, respectively. Out of the 3650 episodes, 2679 (73.4%) reported at least one complication due to
the COVID-19 infection, 2650 being among adults, and 29 among children. Multiple complications
occurred in 1961 adult episodes and 14 children episodes. Overall 565 episodes with complications also
reported a stay on Intensive Care Unit (ICU), 560 of which in adults.
In adults, respiratory complications were dominant with 2470 (93.2%) occurrences. Pneumonia was found
in 2162 episodes (87.5% of respiratory complications), of which 2096 (96.9%) were found to be caused
solely by COVID-19. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) was reported in 557 (22.5%) cases of
respiratory complications. Renal complications were observed in 681 (25.7%) adult episodes, followed by
cardiac (631 - 23.8%), liver (510 - 19.2%), digestive (498 - 18.8%), and neurological (436 - 16.5%)
complications, bacterial infections other than pneumonia (329 - 12.4%). Other complications were
present in less than 10% of the episodes and include thrombosis and embolisms (210 - 7.9%),
ear/nose/throat complications (ENT; 193 - 7.3%; among which 8 - 4.1% - of acute otitis media), nonbacterial infections (132 – 5.0%), and osteo-articular complications (127 - 4.8%).
In children, respiratory complications were also dominant with 16 (55.2%) occurrences. Pneumonia (11 –
68.8%) was directly caused by COVID-19 in 10 (90.9%) cases of pneumonia. Those comprised ARDS in 4
(25.0%) cases in children episodes. Contrarily to adults, digestive and liver complications were the second
dominant complications as they were reported in 7 (24.1%) children’s episodes with complications,
followed by cardiac (6 – 20.7%), ENT (5 – 17.2%; among which one case of acute otitis media), and
neurological (4 – 13.8%) complications. Finally, renal complications and thrombosis/embolism were each
reported in three episodes with complications (10.3%), and non-bacterial infections in 2 (6.9%). Other
bacterial infections as well as osteo-articular complications were not reported in children.
Other types of complications were registered in 1170 (43.6%) episodes with complications. Ageusia,
anemia, and deconditioning syndromes were mostly reported among those. Anosmia was reported in 4
(0.2%) COVID-19 episodes. The information was missing for 596 (16.3%) of the 3650 episodes.

Drug treatments
The distribution of drugs prescribed against the COVID-19 infection can be found in Tables 2 and 3. In
1299 (35.6% - 36.2% of episodes in adults and 5.9% of all episodes in children) episodes, one or often a
combination of therapeutic agents were used. Hydroxychloroquine was the most prescribed treatment
against COVID-19 (989 - 76.1%; 985 in adults and 2 in children) alongside Lopinavir/Ritonavir (675 – 52.0%;
exclusively in adults). Remdesivir was the third dominant drug used to treat COVID-19 (146 – 11.2%; only
once in children). Other treatments were marginally prescribed (twice for Interferon and once for
Tenofovir), or not at all for Ribavirin. Note that hydroxychloroquine was almost abandoned once no more
recommended by international and national authorities.

Outcomes
Figure 3 shows the cumulative number of episodes, discharges, and deaths reported in the database.
Among the 3650 episodes, 2989 (81.9%) were reported as discharged from the hospital, among which
2275 were discharged to their domicile, 230 to another hospital. 222 to a long term care facility, and 249
to other locations, such as rehabilitation centres.

Death was reported in 527 episodes (14.4%), but none in children. The first death occurred in the week
following the first recorded episode (2020-10). The number of reported deaths increased rapidly during
the first 10 weeks, with only a small number of deaths occurring after week 2020-20. Figure 4 shows the
number of death versus the time between the date of interest for the surveillance and the death date.
Most deaths occurred in patients with comorbidities (431 – 81.8%) between the first two weeks following
their diagnosis with a median time between diagnosis and death of 8 days (IQR 5-14 days). Overall, deaths
has been recorded mostly in patients between 80 and 89 years (224 – 42.5%) and in patients between 70
and 79 years (147 – 27.8%) as seen in Figure 5. No deaths were reported in patients below 30.

Pregnant women
Pregnancy accounted for 5.9% (35) episodes of reproductive women (i.e. between 15 and 50 years old)
registered in the database. Among those, 16 suffered from comorbidities (3 asthma, 3 diabetes, 2
hypertension, and 14 other comorbidities), and 14 complications occured, mostly respiratory
complications in 7 episodes and ENT complications in 4. Only one pregnant woman stayed in ICU. None
of them were treated against COVID-19, and no deaths were reported.

Healthcare workers
A total of 146 (4.0%) patients were employed in a healthcare facility: one of which (0.7%) was infected in
a hospital and six (4.1%) were of unknown source.

Strengths and limitations
By using an existing surveillance system for influenza and adapting it for the surveillance of SARS-CoV2/COVID-19 cases, we quickly developed a large harmonised dataset of hospitalised COVID-19 cases in
Switzerland. The data enables assessments of disease severity, risk factors, treatments and the clinical
course of the disease. The data are useful for informing public health authorities and policy makers on the
impact of health regulations put in place during the pandemic and provides potential for modelling the
future of the disease in the country. Due to the lack of data at the European level when the pandemic
started in Europe, most models and measures taken against COVID-19 in Switzerland were based on
Chinese data. The data obtained during this first wave will therefore enable healthcare workers and policy
makers to respond more efficiently to the disease in the future.
Despite being rapidly set up, use of the system for real-time monitoring of the epidemic presented some
challenges. Discussions with the FOPH to adapt the existing influenza database started in early February
and the system was fully operational by the end of the same month, shortly after the first case was
declared in Switzerland. This highlights the adaptability of the original system for surveillance of other
respiratory viruses. Despite the strength of the system in place, it was difficult to obtain data within 48h
of the diagnosis for most centres when faced with a high number of cases. Some hospitals started the
data collection later than others, and had to enter data both retrospectively and prospectively. Other
centres were overwhelmed by the large number of cases and had to focus on patient care first, while at
the same time trying to train new staff who could help with data entry. The overall median time difference
between the first positive laboratory test and the inclusion in the database was 13 days (IQR 3-28). Figure
4 shows the time delay throughout the pandemics. The maximum delay was observed during the height
of the epidemic in Switzerland, but quickly decreased as the number of cases decreased as well. Note that
other Swiss entities also requested data from several participating hospitals, making it more difficult to
report episodes within the demanded 48h.

Figure 4. Time delay (in days) between the date of interest for the system and the inclusion of the patient
in the database.
Using the same approach as the influenza database, data were checked for inconsistencies weekly and
reported to the participating hospitals and the FOPH. Outliers in dates, impossible combinations of
variables, length of stays and treatments, out of range numbers, and missing values were consistently
checked. This allowed the participating hospitals to correct wrong and missing data rapidly. Additional
checks on the data were made by the supervising physicians in each hospital based on the patients'
records to ensure medical accuracy.

By including a large number of university and cantonal hospitals, we collected 3650 cases confirmed by
PCR as of September 1st, 2020 and 527 (14.4%) COVID-19 related deaths. At the same date, the mandatory
reporting system put in place by the FOPH [13] registered 4405 confirmed hospitalisations related to
COVID-19. As of September 3rd, 4541 confirmed hospitalisations were recorded, among which 921
(20.3%) had died during their hospital stay. 59.9% of patients were male and 40.1% female. Comorbidities
were found to be hypertension in 45.9% of the patients, chronic cardiovascular diseases in 39.6%, diabetes
in 20.7%, chronic respiratory diseases in 13.8%, oncological disease in 8.9%, and immunosuppression in
3.7%. Those numbers match with the proportions found in the hospital database, except for hypertensive
patients, cardiovascular pathologies, and patients suffering from diabetes for which the FOPH reporting
system found higher proportions. The median age of the patients in the compulsory declaration system is
also slightly higher than that in our database (70 years old versus 68 years old).
We nevertheless included more than two third of the total number of hospitalisations of confirmed SARSCoV-2/COVID-19 reported in the obligatory system of the FOPH on September 1st, 2020 (82.9%). The
lower proportion of deaths in our system suggests that many patients may have died after discharge from
the hospital or in another institution not captured by the system. We are also missing data on adult

patients from hospitals which only agreed to contribute paediatric cases, potentially explaining the
difference in the median age in both systems.

Conclusion and outlooks
The setup of this database is a first step towards an in-depth understanding of the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19
epidemic in Switzerland, and is a powerful tool in for the second wave, initially reported in China [14] and
currently occurring in Europe. The data will allow authorities to tackle risk populations more precisely and
adapt restrictions. The system was easily adapted from the influenza surveillance system in a matter of
days to include and remove disease-specific information, which allowed a fast response to obtain data.
However, the lack of human resources, the severity of the pandemic, and the multiplication of COVID-19
data collection in hospitals by Swiss medical societies and authorities made it difficult to obtain data
rapidly. Therefore, monitoring the epidemics on time was difficult: an issue that needs to be addressed
rapidly for future pandemics by working more closely with officials to insure avoiding repeated efforts.
The surveillance is still ongoing and we plan, in the future, to include patients with negative PCR results
but suggestive clinical presentation combined with radiographic findings compatible with COVID-19
infection, and patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 serology. We will distinguish these 3 modes of diagnosis:
while positive PCR ensures that the virus is present, CT-scans and radiology show specific features of
COVID-19 only resulting in suspicions. Serology indicates that a patient was previously infected, and could
therefore be of interest for hospitalisations due to complications of the infection (e.g. if the patient was
not initially hospitalised).
Discussions are also ongoing for linking patients from the database to their biological samples, in order to
study associations between risk factors, complications, and specific strains of the virus; and, therefore,
possibly establish a microbiological surveillance of the disease.
Finally, we plan to study long-term consequences of infections since the system in place allows us to track
several hospital stays in afflicted patients.

Accessing the data
The anonymised data can be accessed through a multi-stage process. Applicants must fill a concept-sheet
(supplementary material) and send it to the team in charge of the study. An Executive Committee of
experts and representatives of hospital participants will review the concept. Depending on the goal of the
analysis, additional ethics clearance might be needed. Data will be restricted to the request and shared
through a secure platform. All steps to access the data are described in the aforementioned concept-sheet
(supplementary material).
