Key Point

47
48

IMPORTANCE: The emergency of COVID-19 requires the implementation of urgent

49

strategies to prevent the spread of the disease, mainly in health personnel, who are the

50

most exposed and has the highest risk of becoming infected with the SARS-COV-2.

51

Drug repurposing is a pragmatic strategy, a faster and cheaper option, compared to the

52

new drug development that has proven successful for many drugs and can be a key

53

tool in emergency situations such as the current one that requires quick action. In

54

addition, considering the limited access to vaccines for developing countries,

55

preventive use of ivermectin can be a palliative that minimizes the risks of infection.

56
57

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the protective effect of the combination Ivermectin / Iota-

58

Carrageenan (IVER/IOTACRC), intensive treatment with repeated administration in

59

oral- and nasal-spray, respectively, as a prophylaxis treatment prior to exposure to

60

SARS-CoV-2, in health personnel at Public Healthcare Centers.

61
62

PARTICIPANTS, DESIGN AND SETTING: Randomized controlled 1-1 clinical

63

trial in Personal Health, n = 234. The subjects were divided into experimental (EG:

64

n=117; 39.6 ± 9.4 years old, 65F) and control groups (CG: n=117; 38.4 ± 7.4 years old,

65

61F). The EG received Ivermectin orally 2 tablets of 6 mg = 12 mg every 7 days, and

66

Iota-Carrageenan 6 sprays per day for 4 weeks. All participants were evaluated by

67

physical examination COVID-19 diagnosed with negative RT-PCR at the beginning,

68

final, and follow-up of the protocol. Differences between the variables were

69

determined using the Chi-square test. The proportion test almost contagious subject

70

and the contagion risk (Odds Ratio) were calculated using software STATA. The level

71

of statistical significance was reached when p-Value < 0.05.

72
73

RESULT: The number of subjects who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in EG was

74

lower, only 4 of 117 (3.4%) than subjects in CG: 25 of 117 (21.4%) (P-Value = 1.10-5).

75

Nineteen patients had mild symptoms, 4 were in EG whereas, 15 were in CG (p-Value

76

= 0.001). Seven subjects were moderate, and 3 with severe diagnostics, all them in CG.

77

The probability (Odds Ratio) of becoming ill with COVID-19 was significantly lower

78

in EG with values of 0.13, 95% 0.03 to 0.40; p-Value = 1.10-4, this value (<1) indicates

79

a protective effect of the IVER/IOTACRC in the EG. Logistic regression test

80

demonstrated that treatment was effective to prevent COVID-19 (Odds Ratio 0.11,

81

95% 0.03 to 0.33; p-Value = 1.10-4). We also found that when increase the age,

82

decrease contagious risk (Odds Ratio 0, 93, 95% 0.88 to 0.98, p-Value= 0, 02). On the

83

other hand, the probability of contracting COVID-19 was dependent on the patient's

84

preexisting comorbidity (Odds Ratio 5.58, 95% 2.20 to 14.16, p-Value = 1.10-5). The

85

other variables sex and designation were independent.

86
87

CONCLUSION:

The

intensive

preventive

treatment

88

IVER/IOTACRC was able to reduce the number of health workers infected with

89

COVID-19. This treatment had also effect in preventing the severity of the disease,

90

since all patients treated were mild. We propose a new therapeutic alternative for

91

prevention and short-term intervention scheme (intensive) that is of benefit of the

92

health worker in this pandemic accelerated time. This intervention did not produce

93

lack of adherence to treatment or adverse effects.

Background

100

At the end of December 2019, the incidence of atypical pneumonia of unknown

101

cause was reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan1. Since then, the cases have spread on

102

a global scale generating the new COVID-19 pandemic, which represents the largest

103

global public health crisis of this generation2. Genetic studies identified a new

104

coronavirus, which was named SARS-CoV-2 due to its structural similarity with others

105

SARS-related coronaviruses3.

106

Considering that there are no specific therapies approved by the United States

107

Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-

108

CoV-2)4, the repositioning of different drugs with established safety profiles on the

109

market is being studied in clinical trials and compassionate use protocols based on in

110

vitro activity (against SARS-CoV-2 or related viruses) and / or on the limited clinical

111

experience available. Drug repurposing is a pragmatic strategy, a faster and cheaper

112

option, compared to the new drugs development that has proven successful for many

113

drugs and can be a key tool in emergency situations such as the current one that requires

114

quick action5–7. In addition, considering the limited access to vaccines for developing

115

countries, preventive use of ivermectin can be a palliative that minimizes the risks of

116

infection in the population.

117

Ivermectin is a broad spectrum anti parasitic agent approved by the FDA that in

118

last few years has shown to have in vitro antiviral activity against a wide range of

119

viruses

120

activity may be effective against SARS-CoV-212. Different studies indicate that

121

ivermectin would have two mechanisms of action on the COVID 19 virus: extra and

122

intracellular. The first is through interaction with ionophores cavities or channels

123

present in the cell membrane that electrically trap the corona of the virus capsid and

4,8–11

. Caly et al. (2020) suggested that ivermectin’s nuclear transport inhibitory

124

prevent access to the cell13. The second is carried out by destabilization of the importin

125

heterodimer complex (IMP α / β1)13. When destabilized, the entry to the nucleus of the

126

virus proteins is blocked, preventing viral replication. This fact will probably result in a

127

reduction of the antiviral responses inhibition, leading to a normal and more efficient

128

antiviral response.

129

In line with these studies, numerous clinical trials are evaluating the potential of

130

ivermectin against COVID-19 with results that are not conclusive yet regarding its

131

efficacy and safety. At the end of March 2021, there were about 60 studies registered in

132

https://www.clinicaltrials.gov and 43 studies listened https://www.who.int/clinical-

133

trials-registry-platform about the safety and effectiveness of Ivermectin in COVID-19

134

patients, for treatment and prophylaxis14. A preliminary meta-analysis realized with 18

135

randomized Clinical Trials in 2282 patients, showed a faster time to clinical recovery

136

and signs of viral clearance in patients who took ivermectin, comparating with control

137

group15.

138

Carrageenans, are polysaccharides produced by algae of various families of the

139

Rhodophyceae (red algae), its use as a food thickener additive is approved by the FDA.

140

Its antiviral activity has been attributed to its ability to interfere with the binding of

141

virions to host cell. Carrageenans are in vitro inhibitors of several viruses, including

142

herpes simplex virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, human papilloma virus, varicella

143

zoster virus, human rhinoviruses, and others16.

144

In this context, Health personnel are at high risk of developing the disease. Their

145

contact with infected patients puts them at greater risk from high viral loads, resulting in

146

more serious and prolonged illness17–20. Treatment with oral ivermectin, associated with

147

iota-Carrageenan (antiviral association) applied locally in the nasal and oral cavity,

148

would decrease the probability of the appearance or progress of clinical manifestations

149

and the appearance of severe disease, and would decrease the viral load in the upper

150

airway and the time of virus shedding13.

151

152

Objective

153

The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of oral Ivermectin treatment,

154

which has been associated with iota-carrageenan in repeated doses through the nasal and

155

oral topical route, on the appearance and eventual progression of COVID-19 disease in

156

a healthy population that are exposed to it and have a higher risk of contagion of SARS-

157

COV-2 for being health personnel from community health centers, compared to

158

standard care (usual practice).

160
161

Primary Outcome

162

Reduction the infections rate for COVID-19 disease in healthcare agents.

163
164

Secondary Outcomes

165

Reduction in symptoms number’s presence, and protection against the appearance of

statistical power, 95% proportion of infected patients in the CG, 85% proportion of

173

infected patients in the EG. The sample size calculated, without considering losses, was

174

231 participants. Sample size adjusted to 20% loss ratio was 289 participants.

175
176

Participants

177

The total group n = 300 to enroll included personnel who perform patient care

178

and administrative tasks identified like: i) Healthcare: medical personnel, nurses,

179

kinesiologists; and ii) No Healthcare: administrative and cleaning personnel. Health

180

personnel belonging to the Tucumán State Health System (SI.PRO.SA, Tucumán,

181

Argentina) participated in the study from October 2020 to December 2020. The

182

recruitment procedure was managed by coordinators from each health care center who

183

accept to participate in this trial. Enrollment was staggered until complete the sample

184

size. The people who agreed to participate in the study gave their informed consent

185

before starting the study (Research Ethics Committee / Health Research Directorate, file

186

number 52/2020). The clinical trials registry number is NCT04701710. This study

187

conforms to all CONSORT guidelines and re-ports the required information accordingly

Design

199

Randomized controlled clinical trial (1:1). Once the sample was consolidated, each

200

patient was assigned an ID corresponding to a number from 1 to 234. The selection to

201

each group was performed through a random number generation process by an Excel

202

spreadsheet. Then, 117 of them were randomly selected to generate the CG and EG.

Intervention Protocol

210

The individuals of the EG received active treatment with IVER/IOTACRC. Ivermectin

211

was administered orally in 2 tablets of 6 mg = 12 mg every 7 days and Iota-Carrageenan

212

6 sprays per day. The entire treatment lasted 4 weeks. The CG did not receive any

213

prophylactic treatment. Both groups used standard biosecurity care and personal

214

protective equipment (PPE).

215

A post-control follow-up was carried out at 14 days (remote clinical telemedicine

216

follow-up) at the end of which an RT-PCR test was performed. EG and CG patients

217

were evaluated every 7 days in 4 visits from the beginning of the study. Enrolled

218

subjects completed symptom questionnaires (including reporting any adverse effects of

219

treatment), physical examinations, and COVID-19 nasopharyngeal secretion tests (RT-

220

PCR) at each time. Also in the visit, in person, was supplied the corresponding dose for

221

the week. Cases will be classified according to the WHO definitions of COVID-19

Security definitions

225

Adverse Event (AE) was defined as any medical event, signs, symptoms, or disease

226

temporarily associated with the use of the medication, which could occur in the subjects

227

enrolled in the study23.

228
229

Adherence to treatment

230

The World Health Organization (WHO) defines adherence to treatment as compliance

231

with it; that is, taking the medication according to the dosage of the prescribed schedule;

232

and persistence, taking the medication over time24. We quantify adherence to treatment

233

through weekly controls that include drug administration and a clinical questioning

234

which includes the report of adverse events. Adhesion tests like Hermes, Morisky and

235

Green have not been used, since they have been designed for treatment of chronic

236

diseases with daily drug intake25. Coordinators in charge of each health care center were

237

responsible for the recruitment and accompaniment during the trial.

238
239

Statistics

240

Categorical variables were analyzed with frequencies and percentages, and continuous

241

variables with mean and standard deviation (SD). Pearson's Chi-square and proportions

242

test, as appropriate, were used to analyze the statistical differences between the

243

qualitative variables of each group. To know the contagion risk, the Odds Ratio (OR)

244

was calculated. A Logistic Regression analysis was carried out to know the dependence

245

between the study variables. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant.

246

Calculations were performed using STATA 11.2.

Demographic profile

250

In total, 234 individuals from the health personnel were recruited for this study; 117

251

received treatment with IVER/IOTACRC and 117 within the control group who used

252

biosecurity measures. All the participants completed the study. 57.26% of the

253

participants enrolled in total group were women. The median age in total group was 38

254

years (min: 22; max: 69). 77.4% of the study participants were healthcare personnel.

261

Table 1 shows that the demographic profile and the reported comorbidities distribution

262

of the recruited population is homogeneous, p-Value> 0.05, in all the fields initially

263

analyzed. Only, it was observed that the obese population is greater in the CG than in

264

the EG, a relationship 18 vs. 10, respectively, with p-Value = 0.06 at the borderline.

265

Similarly, the distribution of health agents in relation to their function was different in

266

each group, after randomization was performed (p-Value <0.05). It should be noted that

267

initially, no subjects had compatible COVID-19 signs, and all were diagnosed with

268

negative RT-PCR.

277
278

It is important to note in Table 2 that most of the symptoms, all related to

279

COVID-19, were reported in the CG (p-Value <0.05). The most frequent symptoms

280

were fever (21), taste and / or smell disturbance (19), and headache (19). With

281

intermediate frequency of symptoms, cases with polymyoarthralgia (9), diarrhea (9),

282

abdominal pain (8), and low oxygen saturation (SpO2) (6) were reported. Symptoms

283

related to ALRI symptoms and signs (1) were reported with lower frequencies. Table 2

284

shows the significant differences (p-Value < 0.05) between EG vs CG in relation to

285

each of the reported symptoms. CG had a prevalence of all the most frequent symptoms

19 in EG was lower, only 4 of 117 (3.4%), than subjects in CG: 25 of 117 (21.4%) (p-

297

Value = 1.10-4). Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were classified as mild, moderate

298

and severe, according to the gravity cases. Figure 2B shows the distribution of cases in

299

each group and their respective classification.

300

Nineteen patients had mild classification for COVID-19, n= 4 in EG, and n= 15

301

in CG (p-Value = 0.001). Seven subjects were moderate, and 3 with severe diagnostics,

302

all them were in CG. In addition, it was found that in the EG people who contracted

303

COVID-19 only 1/4 had any symptoms, while the CG 24/25 (p-Value = 1.10-5).

304
305

Odds Ratio and variables influence on intervention

306

The probability (Odds Ratio) of becoming ill with COVID-19 was significantly

307

lower in EG with values of 0.13, 95% 0.03 to 0.40; p-Value = 1.10-4, than in GC with

308

values of 7.67, 95% 2.57 to 22.85; p-Value = 1.10-4. The value <1 indicates a protective

309

effect of the IVER / IOTACRC for EG. Consequently, people with treatment decrease

310

their chance of contracting COVID-19 by 87%.

311

Logistic regression test was also performed in order to determinate the influence

312

of different variables on the clinical trials. In this model dichotomous dependent

313

variable was used as having or not suffering from COVID-19 in relation to the five

314

variables: IVER/IOTACRC intervention, comorbidity, age, sex and designation. Figure

315

3 shows the influence of different variables on the probability to getting or not COVID-

316

19. The probability (Odds Ratio) in relation at all variables was that becoming ill with

317

COVID-19 was maintained significantly lower in people treated with IVER/IOTAC

318

relative to non-treated people, Odds Ratio 0.11, 95% 0.03 to 0.33; p-Value = 1.10-4. We

319

find that the mean value, including the Confidence Interval (CI), was <1. This value

reduction of the risk to contracting COVID-19 were maintained even in interaction with

322

other variables.

323
324

< Table 3 >

325

Table 3. Influence of different variables on the probability to getting or not COVID-19.

326
327

On the other hand, the probability of contracting COVID-19 was dependent on

328

the patient's preexisting comorbidity. People with comorbidities had a greater chance to

329

contracting COVID-19, Odds Ratio 5.58, 95% 2.20 to 14.16, p-Value = 1.10-5 (Odds

330

Ratio >1).

331

Regarding to age, this was study as continues variable, it can be observed that as

332

this increase, they had minor chance of getting COVID-19. This indicates that as age

333

increases by one unit, the chance of getting or contracting COVID-19 decreases 7% the

334

chance of getting COVID-19. This is because the Regression Coefficient (RC) has a

335

negative sign (RC = -2.37, 95% -0.12 to -0.01, p-Value = 0.018). This may be due to the

336

fact that the average age of all people enrolled in this study was 39 years, no

337

significative differences in booth EG and CG groups (Table 1), range between 32 to 41

338

year was 48.3%. Odds Ratio to this variable was 0.93, 95% 0.88 to 0.98, p-Value =

339

0.02.

340

Getting COVID-19 was independent of sex when this variable was analyzed in

341

both groups (CG and EG) (Table 3). When this variable was studied using a stratified

342

model in male and female (see Table 1), we founded that the protective power of

343

ivermectin is conserved in both sex groups (Sex F Odds Ratio 0.148, 95% 0.02 to 0.55

344

p-Value = 0.0012 Sex M Odds Ratio 0.098, 95% 0.002 to 0.796; p-Value = 0.010)

345

When the variable was studied using a stratified model in four age interquartile

346

(see Table 1), we founded the protective power of ivermectin is conserved in the first

347

three age interquartiles. In people older 45 years of age we found the preventive

348

treatment wasn’t effective.

349

In relation to designation (Healthcare vs. no-Healthcare) and comorbidities

350

getting COVID-19 was independent of this variable (see Table 3).

351

Discussion

352

Health personal is one of the most exposed groups to COVID-19 contagion, because of

353

their steady contact with infected patients. In our work we found a protective effect of

354

the intensive IVER/IOTACRC treatment in pre-exposure prophylaxis to COVID-19 in

355

health agents. The number of people affected by the disease was significantly higher in

356

the CG when compared to the EG who followed the intervention. In agreement with our

357

findings, Tarek Alacom et al. in an observational prophylactic study conducted in 118

358

healthcare workers, they found that significant minor contagious in subjects which re-

359

ceived ivermectin26. In the aforementioned study, a lower dose of ivermectin was used

360

unlike the treatment proposed here, held for one month and iota carrageenan was used

361

in conjunction with ivermectin. The findings in our work, in agreement with Carvallo H

362

et al., confirm the hypothesis that the association IVER/IOTACRC works by decreasing

363

the possibility of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and possibly acts synergistically27. We

364

interpret that a double viral barrier would be formed that would enhance its action and

365

allow to increase the protective effect in the following way: i) The first barrier for viral

366

protection would be at the entry of the virus into the nasal cavity where the carrageenan

367

would behave as a mucolytic agent in the barrier of sulfacted polysaccharides with neg-

368

ative charge28; ii) The other action of ivermectin is to decrease the viral load based on

369

its systemic cellular action29. It is coincident with reports of viral clearance in other clin-

370

ical trials which evaluate the use of ivermectin to treat COVID-19. Ahmed S. et al.

371

found that a 5-day course of ivermectin resulted in earlier clearance of the virus com-

372

pared to placebo group 30.

373

It is understood that it is capable of preventing the entry into the cell nucleus of the viral

374

RNA by blocking importin alpha/beta, thereby preventing replication since SARs-

375

COVID-2 does not have the nuclear mechanisms and enzymatic actions for the tran-

376

scription of new viral replicates31. In this direction, our work meets the work of Sharun

377

et al (2020)32, who demonstrated the effect of ivermectin as a drug for inhibiting virus

378

replication in vitro laboratory conditions and places the drug as a new therapeutic can-

379

didate against SARS-CoV-2 / COVID-19. There are other works, either in prevention,

380

that found that a two-dose of ivermectin was associated with a reduction of SARS-CoV-

381

2 infection, what makes ivermectin useful for healthcare personal preventive use33.

382

Secondary outcome found was that IVER/IOTACRC not only prevents the infections

383

rate, but also has a protective effect on reduction in symptoms number’s presence, and

384

protection against the appearance of severe stages for COVID-19 disease (Figure 2). As

385

can be seen in Figure 2B, the EG only had mild cases, while the CG had mild, moderate

386

and severe cases, the differences between both groups being significant. We observed in

387

Table 2 that the symptoms description in the EG is significantly lower that CG. On the

388

other hand, it’s necessary point out that the comorbidities or risk factor such as hyper-

389

tension, DBT, obesity or over 60 years old were similar in booth group (Table 1). So,

390

the results above mentioned, cannot attributed to presence to comorbidities in the CG.

391

In our greatest consideration, this would be an important contribution. When the effec-

392

tiveness of IVER / IOTACRC treatment was analyzed together with the other variables,

393

we found that, even in the presence of the comorbidity variable, the protective effect of

394

IVER / IOTACRC was maintained, with Odds Ratio <1 (Table 3). It is observed that the

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.26.21254398; this version posted March 30, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

395

protective effect only has a small and no significant increased (87% to 89%) in the

396

chance getting COVID-19 in EG.

397

In relation to comorbidities and their greater impact on the severity of COVID-19, other

398

researchers have shown a positive relationship34,35. In relation to the sex variable, in

399

total group, we found that was independent in relation to treatment with

400

IVER/IOTACRC (Table 3). Stratified model by age showed that treatment was

401

protective for people under 45 years old, independent of sex.

402

The proposed prophylactic treatment is also independent of the designation (healthcare

403

and no healthcare).

404

During the study, there was no lack of adherence to IVER/IOTACRC treatment. We

405

hypothesized that good adherence was due to the design of the protocol, since it provid-

406

ed for the follow-up of the enrolled subjects periodically. These were designed every

407

seven days using two strategies: i) face-to-face visits, and ii) remote monitoring via tel-

408

emedicine. Another fact that may have influenced good adherence is that a short-term

409

intensive protocol was used.

410

Adverse effects

411

Regarding adverse effects, they were not reported in any case. The explanation for this

412

is that it could be due to the fact that IVER/IOTACRC only produces these effects when

413

the drug acts as an anti parasitic, unlike the viricidal action proposed in this study. An-

414

other fact that reinforces the absence of adverse effects is that the doses used in this pro-

415

tocol are low doses, in which previously, in the literature, it has been reported that they

416

do not produce adverse effects37.

417

Benefits

418

Through this study, it was possible to show a prophylactic effect of IVER/IOTACRC

419

against COVID-19 disease. This association of drugs was inexpensive and is also

420

accessible in the local pharmaceutical industry (Argentina). It is more relevant

421

considering the limitations in vaccines supplies.

422

Limitations

423

The main limitation of this study was the number of agents to enroll. This trial does not

424

include the report of adverse event in the long run, so will be interesting to include in

425

future trials biochemical examination for control of potential adverse effects. Financial

426

limitations impacted in the study design, which not involved blinded evaluation and/or

427

placebo administration. It’s also for considering the limitations of RT-PCR test in

428

relation to diagnosis, which in future works can be complimented with other approved

429

qualitative tests. On this last point, economic constraints had a determining rol.

430

Future work

431

We consider that our results, taking together with other trials, are encouraging for

432

develop further studies. New clinical intervention studies in our region and also partners

433

in other countries that may show the effect of the IVER/IOTACRC compound in mild-

434

stage outpatients. The design that would be proposed would be to use the same

435

treatment time but at higher doses. Other way, more strong results could be obtained

436

from randomized double blinded studies with long term controls to arrive to solid

437

conclusions about safety and efficacy of IVER/IOTACRC

438

Conclusion

439

The intensive preventive treatment (short-term) with IVER/IOTACRC was able

440

to reduce the health workers number infected with COVID-19. This treatment had an

441

additional effect in preventing the severity of the disease, since most of the patients who

442

received the treatment were mild.

443

In the presence of the comorbidity variable, the protective effect of IVER /

444
445
446

IOTACRC was maintained in the chance getting COVID-19 in the treatment group.
The proposed prophylactic treatment is independent of the sex variable, and
designation (healthcare and no healthcare).

447

We propose a new therapeutic alternative for prevention and short-term

448

intervention scheme (intensive), which is of benefit of the health worker in this

449

pandemic accelerated time. This intervention did not produce lack of adherence to

450

treatment or adverse effects.
