43

The global COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS CoV-2 is causing both mortality/morbidity

44

and collateral social and economic damage related to public panic and aggressive public policy

45

measures to contain the disease worldwide.(1) The epidemic appears to have taken hold much

46

more slowly in sub-Saharan Africa than most of the world.(2) Antibody testing to evaluate the

47

population proportion previously infected with SARS CoV-2 has the potential to guide public

48

policy, but has not been reported so far for sub-Saharan Africa.

49
50

Because a large proportion of cases of COVID-19 are asymptomatic and because the elderly are

51

disproportionately affected with severe and symptomatic disease, we hypothesized that a young

52

population might have experienced an epidemic without having recognized it before COVID-19

53

become widely known. Such a prior epidemic might explain slower growth of the epidemic in

54

sub-Saharan Africa than elsewhere. We hypothesized that a severe influenza-like illness was

55

epidemic in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia around the time COVID-19 was recognized, and might

56

represent a prior epidemic. Because responses taken to contain COVID-19 prevent population-

57

based sampling, and due to the urgency of the situation, we undertook a serological study of

58

approximately 100 persons presenting to a laboratory for other reasons, and an additional group

59

convalescent from the outbreak in November 2019/February 2020, to assess the extent of

60

exposure of the population in Addis Ababa and indirectly assess whether this epidemic may have

61

been attributable to SARS CoV-2.

62
63

The study was conducted at International Clinical Laboratories in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, which

64

offers the Abbott IgG test run on the ARCHITECT platform with approval of the Ethiopian Food

65

and Drug Administration to the general public. This test, which has received the European CE

66

mark and an Emergency Use Authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration, has

67

been found to have 100% sensitivity and 99.9% specificity using the Abbott-determined index

68

value cutoff of 1.4 in an independent study by the University of Washington conducted in Idaho,

69

USA.(3) It has not yet been independently validated in Africa.

70
71

Subjects enrolled as part of the two groups met the following eligibility criteria: Age 14 years or

72

higher; resident in Addis Ababa for all of November 2019-February 2020 and no travel outside

73

Ethiopia since November 1, 2019. The following exclusion criteria also were absent: sore

74

throat, runny nose, cough or difficulty breathing and/or hospitalized or quarantined in the last 28

75

days; measured temperature>99.6 Fahrenheit, resting heart rate >100/minut, and/or resting

76

respiratory rate ≥25/minute); incarceration for a crime; unwilling to participate; or unable to

77

consent. The study was approved in advance by the Institutional Review Boards of MyungSung

78

Medical College (Addis Ababa, Ethiopia) and Partners Healthcare (Boston, USA), and the Addis

79

Ababa Regional Health Bureau; subjects provided written informed consent in Amharic or

80

English.

81
82

After training the study team, 99 subjects were recruited from the participating laboratory’s

83

waiting room during May 18-21 inclusive; their characteristics are summarized in the Table.

84

Among these, three tested positive for SARS CoV-2 IgG (3.03%, 95% binomial exact

85

confidence interval (CI): 0.63%-8.6%). None of the positive cases were taking medications; one

86

had a chronic runny nose with no other symptoms. Taking into account the sampling scheme

87

and pre-test probability (1.26% based on 1,923 positive results among 152,334 tests as of June 9,

88

2020(4)), the range of plausible values according to the method of Larremore and colleagues(5)

are given in the Figure. Forty-five Ethiopians recruited from the investigators’ network who

90

recalled being sick with a COVID-compatible illness between November 1, 2019 and February

91

29, 2020, were recruited enrolled May 22-27, of whom one tested positive for SARS CoV-2 IgG

92

(2.2%, 95% CI: 0.056%-12%).

93
94

Our results, the first serological general population data on SARS-CoV2 reported from sub-

95

Saharan Africa, are a start toward the vast and important work of characterizing the extent of

96

spread over time in this region with approximately one-seventh of the world’s population. While

97

the results of this kind of sample are limited in scope and not easily generalizable, the results do

98

suggest that the large majority of residents of Addis Ababa have not yet been infected by SARS

99

CoV-2 and are at risk. The results do not suggest any particular risk factors for SARS CoV-2

100

seropositivity.

101
102

Decision-makers in Ethiopia, Africa, and elsewhere all are faced with the dilemma of weighing

103

the trade-offs between the direct consequences of the COVID-19 epidemic and the health,

104

economic and other consequences of aggressive control measures.(2) Given the very young age

105

structure of sub-Saharan Africa with associated lesser direct risk from COVID-19,(6, 7) the risk

106

of famine(8) and limited access to essential services(1) as well as economic problems in this

107

region as collateral problems from COVID-19-associated public panic and restrictive policies,

108

different decisions may be appropriate in the African situation than in countries with an older

109

population age structure and developed economic situation. (9)
