Manuscript Type: Original Article
Title of Manuscript: Is there hope for the Hajj? Using the SIR Model to Forecast COVID-19
Progression in the City of Makkah
Abstract:
Background: The Hajj is the largest annual gathering in the world, and it is a very important event
for every Muslim. Makkah annually receives three million pilgrims who perform Hajj. Although
precautionary measures have been taken in Saudi Arabia to slow down the spread of COVID-19,
such as locking down the most affected cities, practicing social distancing, and applying the
infection-control precautions, the number of cases has increased. The total confirmed number of
cases in Makkah was 10,709 with 127 deaths as of May 16, 2020.
Aims of the study: Forecasting the COVID-19 progression in the city of Makkah will help the
policymakers decide if the Hajj will be able to operate this year. Thus, to see a clear picture of
the fight against COVID-19 for the economy and healthcare industry in Saudi Arabia,
specifically in Makkah, the SIR model will predict COVID-19 progression in the city of
Makkah.
Method: The Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered (SIR) model has been used to track the
transmission dynamics and growth among the city of Makkah. The growth index was calculated,
according to the data from March 16 until May 9. The estimated vital epidemiological parameters,
such as forecasting works and transmission rates, were done.
Result: The data showed an interesting result about the peak of the disease progression. It is
projected to occur around the 12th day after running the model. According to the model, the peak
time will be around the 22nd of May. Then, the number of cases will start to decrease.
Conclusion: Using the SIR model, the result predicts the disease progression peak and an
estimated end of COVID-19 in the city of Makkah to help the policymakers decide if the Hajj
will be able to operate this year.

Is there hope for the Hajj? Using the SIR Model to Forecast COVID-19 Progression in
the City of Makkah
Uncertainty about COVID-19 leaves people wondering about returning to their normal
lives. Social distancing affects family gatherings and religious rituals. Mosques in Saudi Arabia
have been closed to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Makkah is located in Saudi Arabia and
hosts the largest annual Muslim ritual gatherings in the world, the Hajj. Muslims are waiting for
this holy gathering with the hope that they can perform the Hajj, which will be around August
22nd, 2020. Forecasting the disease progression in the city of Makkah will help the policymakers
to decide if the Hajj will be able to operate this year. Thus, to see a clear picture of the fight
against COVID-19 for the economy and healthcare industry in Saudi Arabia, specifically in
Makkah, the SIR model will predict COVID-19 progression in the city of Makkah.
Makkah is considered one of the holiest cities in Islam. Approximately eight in ten
people around the world follow a religious group. Muslims are considered the second largest
religious group worldwide after Christianity. There are 1.6 billion Muslims around the world 1.
Makkah’s population is 2,042,000, without counting the large number of undocumented
residents 2. Since the discovery of oil in Saudi Arabia, general development increased around
1960. Then, Saudi Arabia has become an attractive country in which to live. The Saudi way of
life has adopted higher standards to boost the economy; the Saudi cities became developed, and
new jobs were opened. Although Saudi Arabia has a strong economy, it is suffering from a
shortage of a local workforce. Due to the economic difficulties in some Arab and South East
Asian countries, Saudi Arabia was the best country to immigrate to work in for the last two
decades 3.

Historically, pilgrims who came to Makkah brought with them many diseases such as
cholera, plaque, and smallpox, which frequently occurred in over-crowded places. The holy
places are frequently packed with people. That’s why many times epidemics happened. In the
nineteenth century, Makkah became the station of cholera between Bangal and Egypt. Cholera
arrived in Makkah from countries with cholera pandemics such as Java and Singapore, and it
killed 15,000 people out of 90,000. The effects- of cholera traveled with pilgrims to their own
countries, causing 60,000 deaths in Egypt 4. Due to the disease that travelled with the pilgrims,
Saudi Arabia’s health officials issued visa requirements for entry for Hajj and Umrah. The
requirements include vaccination against pandemic influenza A (H1N1), yellow fever, bubonic
plaque, meningococcal meningitis, and poliomyelitis 5. Applying these requirements reduced the
spread of diseases among the pilgrims. However, COVID-19 has no approved treatment and
vaccination to prevent its spreading 6.
Containing COVID-19 is not an easy thing to do across Saudi Arabia, especially in the
city of Makkah, due to the undocumented immigrants who have been living there for decades.
The undocumented immigrants in Saudi Arabia are categorized into four groups. The first group
came for Hajj, or Umrah, and extended their stay in Makkah without permission. The second
group came for a working visa and stayed longer after violating their work contract. Third are the
people who were smuggled from the neighboring countries such as Yemen. The fourth group is
the children who were born from illegal immigrants; their status in Saudi Araba was considered
illegal 7.
The government’s actions were effective in preventing the spread of the disease among
those who violated their stay in Saudi Arabia. The Saudi government announced that all
undocumented immigrants would be screened for COVID-19, and provided the treatment needed

for them for free without asking about their legality of stay. Moreover, the health officials
targeted the areas with high numbers of undocumented immigrants to test the largest amount of
people there. Makkah now has the most COVID-19 patients among the Saudi cities, but with
these actions from the government, the number is expected to go down 8.
COVID-19 is highly contagious, which means it has the ability to spread very fast. The
total confirmed cases in Saudi Arabia is 52,016 with 302 deaths (WHO) as of May 16, 2020.
Although precautionary measures have been taken in Saudi Arabia, such as locking down the most
affected cities, practicing social distancing, and applying the infection control precautions (MOH),
the number of cases has increased. The total confirmed cases in Makkah is 10,709 with 127 deaths
(MOH).
Investigating various types of epidemic models, the main purpose is to understand the
mechanism of disease progression. There are many models for forecasting, and the SIR model is
one of the models that has a proven history to predict many infectious diseases. Susceptible,
Infected, and Recovered (SIR) is a frequently used model that tracks the transmission dynamics
and growth amongst the population. The usage of SIR model is to estimate vital epidemiological
parameters, such as forecasting works and transmission rates 9. It is supportive to use a
mathematical procedure that has dealt with various infectious diseases and apply it to COVID-19
to have an evidence basis for forecasting.
Method
Based on the nature of COVID-19 and the characteristic of the virus, SARS-CoV-2 that
causes the disease, a SIR model is a good fit to forecast the end period of COVID-19. The
growth index will be calculated according to the data from March 16 until May 9. Susceptible,
Infected, and Recovered are the main state variables of the model. The susceptible will be the

whole population of the city of Makkah because this disease is highly contagious, closer to the
2000000. This data was taken from an authoritative source (Ministry of health). The infected and
the recovered are secondary data that have been taken from (Ministry of health).
The SIR model first introduced by Kermack and Mckendrick (1927) 10, where they have
three components susceptible, infected, and recovered as the disease spread. In our study we
employ a SIR model to predict the peaks of cases before they decrease over time. The
importance of our study is to give a prediction to all Muslim people all over the world whether
they can complete one of their five pillars of Islam (Hajj). Additionally, according to the
Ministry of Tourism, 75% of hotel rooms are in Makkah and Medina, which economically have
a negative impact on tourism sectors and increase the unemployment rate. However, a study
found that during a flu pandemic it is cost efficient to lockdown travel if death rate is high or
above average 11. Today, the number of cases in Makkah is still increasing at a sustainable rate,
because of the preventive measure that health officials are taking to control the spread of the
virus. While everyone is hoping to an end to COVID-19 or at least control the number of cases,
it’s important to forecast and predict the length of time to lessen the lockdown and open
gradually.
So, a population of N in our study divided to (S) susceptible, (I) infected, and (R)
recovered
where: N = S +I + R
So, where rewrite it as a function of time as follows:
S = S(t) number of susceptible individuals over time,
I = I(t) number of infected individuals over time, and

At the initial condition at initial time {S (0), I (0), R (0)} where parameter β = 1.7 per day is the

Parameter β represent the rate of Susceptible who get infected over time, and parameter ϒ
represent the recovery rate whose been infected. By running the simple SIR model we can
forecast when is the peak time of COVID -19 in Makkah over time where t = 70.
Results
In this section, the results of the SIR calculations were presented. The time period was 70
days as the study in China calculated their sample of 70 days 12. We have S (0) = .9999 of the
population is susceptible and starting infected at I (0) = 0.0001, which was a percent of population
infected, and recovery rate is zero R (0) = 0. We compared our findings with China’s cases, and it
presented similar results to the constant parameters for the SIR model that has been used to forecast
the epidemic COVID-19 in China. The following table 1 shows the state variable parameters for
the SIR model in the city of Makkah, Saudi Arabia. It is important to declare that Saudi Arabia is
implementing a lockdown of all activities and ordering individuals to stay at home which we did
not consider in our study.

The data presented in graph 1 is the daily number of cases reported in Saudi Arabia, and
the daily number reported in Makkah from 3/16/2020 to 5/09/2020. Both curves indicate the
increasing number over time, with 673 being the daily average of infected people in Saudi
Arabia and the average daily cases in Makkah is 145.

To have a better understanding of the speed of COVID-19, we calculate the growth
index. Graph 3 shows our calculation of the growth index of COVID -19 from the first reported
date of 3/16/2020 to 5/9/2020, and it is clear that we had a big spike after the 5th day of the first
reported case. On average, the growth index is 1.7.

Graph 2: Growth index of Daily Cases

Figure 1 shows the dynamics of the three variables S, I, and R. We observe that the curve
of susceptible is decreasing over time due to the assumption that the birth rate = 0. Also, we
assumed that once susceptible people are infected, they will never return to a state variable of
susceptible. The infected curve shows that the number of infected people will reach the peak in
15 days before it starts to decrease. The recovery curve starts low before it increases dramatically
as the number of recovered individuals accumulates and rises above the infected curve. The
intersect between the recovery curve and infected curve assumingly will be in 18 days, which is
the beginning of June. The data showed an interesting result about the peak of the disease
progression. It is estimated to occur around the 15th day after running the model. According to
the model, the peak time will be around the 22ed of May. Then, the cases will decrease until the
30th day, which is around the 15th of June.

Discussion
This study has been done in a very important time in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
The main goal of the study was estimating the disease progression in the city of Makkah and to
help the policy makers to decide if the Hajj will be held this year. One of the important features
of a SIR model is the feature of identifying simultaneously with model parameters, which can
detect and forecast positive infected people of the ϒ factor that relates to the actual number of
infected individuals in the sample population 13. For the accumulated data of Saudi Arabia, the
recovery rate is 32%, and the real mortality rate of the infection is .5% as of May 9 (Ministry of
Health). The data covers 70 days since the emergence of the first infected person in a city of
Makkah, Saudi Arabia, which was on March 16th (Ministry of Health). The parameters have
been used according to this data. The model and the parameters allowed us to forecast the time
needed to predict the end time of COVID-19 in Makkah or at least when the curve would be

flattened. The other countries that had a decline took around three months. So, the time was
estimated around 70 days. An important note about the study that it is did not consider Saudi
Arabia is imposing prevention measures on the time period we are covering. Another important
note is that on the 22nd of March the number jumped significantly on the growth index, which
can be explained by the 72 reported cases at a hotel in Makkah (Ministry of Health). The
findings provide significant outcomes for health authorities to ensure the availability of all
resources that they might need. Also, it helps them to forecast when the curve will flatten and
apply their economic and health polices accordingly. Figure 1 predicted that the curve will
flatten in 20 days within the constraint that nothing changes. As of the 27th of February, Saudi
Arabia stopped Umrah visas, which was an early prevention to slow down the spread of the virus
and decrease the number of infected people.
Conclusion
The economy and the healthcare industry have been most affected by this pandemic.
Solidarity is now needed in the fight against COVID-19 to resume to the normal life, attend
family gatherings, and perform religious rituals. Using the SIR model, the result predicts the
disease progression peak and an estimated end of COVID-19 in the city of Makkah to help the
policymakers decide if the Hajj will be able to operate this year.
