in severe cases.

Reunion (RUN) island is one of the outermost region in Europe, part of the Mascareigna
archipel and best known for its major epidemic of chikungunya in 2005-2006 affecting over
1/3 of the population (ie. 258 000 cases)

1

. Yet again, the island has been impacted more

recently from beginning of March 2020 with the first set of imported cases of the novel
coronavirus SARS-CoV2. Both cellular and humoral immunities are critically important to
control the infection but little is known about the kinetics of those responses and, in
particular, in patients who will go on to develop a severe form of the disease over several
weeks. Previous but limited studies have demonstrated that IgG serum levels were higher in
severe patients than in non-severe patients two weeks after symptom onset but to what
extent this response could last (or not) is unknown.

We herein present the first set of data of our prospective cohort study of hospitalized cases.
Serological surveys were thoroughly performed over 2 month period by assessing IgG and
IgM responses by immunofluorescence, immunoblot, Western blot and conventional ELISA
using clinical RUN isolates of SARS-CoV2 immobilized on 96 well plates.
Among the ninety hospitalized RTPCR+ cases tested at CHU of la Réunion (11 March20 May 2020), we further fully explored the kinetic of the antibody responses in twenty
cases over ten to sixty-four days. While the IgM and, unexpectedly, the IgG responses were
readily detected early during the course of the disease (5-7 days post-first symptoms), our
results (n=3-5 and over the full dilution set of the plasma 1/200 to 1/12800) demonstrated a
significant

decrease

(over

2.5-fold)

of

IgG

levels

in

severe

(ICU)

hospitalized

patients

(exemplified in patient 1). It has already been demonstrated that seroconversion for IgG and
IgM

occurred

simultaneously

and

that

antibody

titers

plateaued

within

6

days

after

seroconversion. In contrast, mild non-ICU patients had a steady and yet robust rise in their
specific IgG levels against the virus. Interestingly, both responses (IgM and IgG) were initially
against the nucleocapsid (50kDa band on the WB) and spreading to other major viral protein
S and domains (S1 and S2).

Our original data have several major implications. The techniques used herein clearly
argue for the use of conventional methods to perform reliable serological surveys and
particularly given the major shortage of commercial kits. Serological testing may be helpful
for

the

diagnosis

of

suspected

patients

with

negative

RT-PCR

results

and

for

the

identification of asymptomatic infections. Moreover, medical care and protections should be
maintained particularly for recovered patients (severe cases) who may remain at risk. Our
data suggest that immune protection against SARS-CoV-2 might rapidly vanish over time (in

2

a matter of days) as reported for patients with SARS-CoV-1 (but yet in a matter of months) .
RTPCR surveys should be reinforced even in the event of past positive serology. Of further
critical note, patient 4 remained SARS-CoV2 + by RTPCR (E and N genes) at day 46. Finally,
we believe that the emphasis should be although on studies not only addressing the T cell
responses but although their kinetics overtime. All in all, these studies will help to delineate
the best routes for vaccination.
