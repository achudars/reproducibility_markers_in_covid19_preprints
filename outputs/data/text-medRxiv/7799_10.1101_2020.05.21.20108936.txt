Abstract

26
27

Objectives:

28

To undertake a preliminary hypothesis-generating analysis exploring putative risk factors for

29

coronavirus diseae 2019 (COVID-19) population-adjusted deaths, compared with non-COVID-19

30

related deaths, at a local authority district (LAD) level in hospital, care homes and at home.

31

Design:

32

Ecological retrospective cohort study

33

Setting

34

Local authority districts (LADs) in England, Scotland and Wales (Great Britain (GB)).

35

Participants

36

All LAD deaths registered by week 16 of 2020.

37

Main Outcome Measures

38

Death registration where COVID-19 is mentioned as a contributing factor per 100,000 people in all

39

settings, and in i) cares homes, ii) hospitals or iii) home only, in comparison to non-COVID-19 related

40

deaths.

41

Results

42

Across GB by week 16 of 2020, 20,684 deaths had been registered mentioning COVID-19, equivalent

43

to 25.6 per 100,000 people. Significant risk factors for LAD COVID-19 death in comparison to non-

44

COVID-19 related death were air pollution and proportion of the population who were female.

45

Significant protective factors were higher air temperature and proportion of the population who

46

were ex-smokers. Conversely, for all COVID-19 unrelated deaths in comparison to COVID-19 deaths,

47

higher rates of communal living, higher population rates of chronic kidney disease, chronic

48

obstructive pulmonary disease, cerebrovascular disease deaths under 75 and dementia were

49

predictive of death, whereas, higher rates of flight passengers was protective. Looking at individual

50

setttings, the most notable findings in care homes was Scotland being a significant risk factor for

51

COVID-19 related deaths compared to England. For hospital setting, the proportion of the

52

population who were from black and Asian minority ethnic (BAME) groups significantly predicted

53

COVID-19 related death.

54

Conclusions

55

This is the first study within GB to assess COVID-19 related deaths in comparison to COVID-19

56

unrelated deaths across hospital, care homes and home combined. As an ecological study, the

57

results cannot be directly extrapolated to individuals. However, the analysis may be informative for

58

public health policy and protective measures. From our hypothesis-generating analysis, we propose

59

that air pollution is a significant risk factor and high temperature a significant protective factor for

60

COVID-19 related deaths. These factors cannot readily be modelled at an individual level. Scottish

61

local authorities and local authorities with a higher proportion of individuals of BAME origin are

62

potential risk factors for COVID-19 related deaths in care homes and in hospitals, respectively.

63

Altogether, this analysis shows the benefits of access to high quality open data for public

64

information, public health policy and further research.

Introduction

73
74

The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis has presented the United Kingdom (UK) with

75

an unprecedented challenge in the management and prediction of infection and mortality rates.

76

With the benefit of frequently updated open-access population health data, it is possible for

77

researchers in the UK to identify regional influences of disease progression and outcome that,

78

crucially, might help to model service provision in real-time.

79

Studies of disease trajectory related to COVID-19 have emerged over the past few weeks and have

80

highlighted several demographic and clinical factors that influence outcome. Initial data from Wuhan

81

suggested that increased age and presence of co-morbidities, in particular cardiovascular disease,

82

predicted death (as compared with discharge) in a cohort of patients admitted to hospital with

83

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.[1,2] A meta-analysis of

84

44,672 laboratory-confirmed cases in China confirmed these findings, and also highlighted the

85

increased risk of death among men, with an equal rate of infection among males and females.[3]

86

In a series of 4103 patients in New York City, 48.7% were hospitalised, with age >65 and obesity

87

most strongly predicting admission; tobacco use was an independent negative predictor of

88

hospitalisation.[4] A further multivariable report of 16,749 patients from 166 UK hospitals (33%

89

death rate) confirmed that increased age was strongly independently associated with death and that

90

co-morbidities (in order of importance: dementia, obesity, chronic cardiac disease, chronic kidney

91

disease (CKD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and malignancy) were also

92

independently associated with mortality.[5] Females were 20% less likely to die than males.

93

However, the study did not control for ethnicity, smoking status, local population factors such as

94

social deprivation, population density, population and goods movement, or ecological factors such

95

as climate and pollution.

96

Risk factors for in-hospital deaths have also been explored using a large cohort of primary care

97

patients in England[6]. Primary care linkage data permitted detailed analysis of past medical and

98

demographic risk factors, which were studied in individual age and sex-adjusted models; significant

99

variables were then incorporated into a multivariable model. Again, co-morbidities were considered

100

to impart significant risk of death, as well as deprivation and being from Asian and black ethnicity

101

minorities. Current smoking was found to be protective against death from COVID-19 but lost

102

significance when adjusted for ethnicity.

103

Ethnicity has recently been identified as a research priority, following observations from the Institute

104

of Fiscal Studies that COVID-19 related death rates of people of black, Asian and minority ethnic

105

(BAME) origin are 2.5 times that of people of white ethnic origin in English hospitals. Exclusion of

106

ethnicity data from some multivariable analyses thus far is a concerning omission.[7]

107

Ecological modelling suggests that ‘lived’, or perceived, population density, and climate are thought

108

to modify the rate of transmission of SARS-CoV-2.[8,9] Moreover, direct links between air pollution

109

and the severity of respiratory disease or inflammatory response in COVID-19 disease have been

110

postulated in Northern Italy,[10] England[11] and the United States.[12] Cultural and behavioural

111

variables are more difficult to study but, inevitably, local, domestic and international travel and

112

transport[13,14] and public and cultural awareness[15] is thought to contribute to population

113

spreading.

114

While respiratory failure is the most common cause of death of people with COVID-19 in hospital[1],

115

evidence for an overwhelming burden of out-of-hospital deaths has emerged in the UK. Possible

116

reasons for this include: i) recent proactivity from primary care providers in formalising ‘Do Not

117

Attempt Resuscitation’ orders in care home residents and individuals over 70 with co-morbidities; ii)

118

triaging of intensive care admissions; iii) expected deaths in those with co-morbidities with

119

concomitant infection with SARS-CoV-2 being an “epiphenomenon”.[16] However, other

120

independent disease-specific or location-specific influences may contribute. Systematic analysis of

121

risk factors for COVID-19 related deaths in the community is currently lacking.

122

Death rates in Great Britain are anticipated to be amongst the highest in Europe,[17] although

123

variation in reporting of out-of-hospital deaths currently makes between-country comparisons

124

difficult.[18] In light of ongoing fatalities, factors influencing survival may have broader public health

125

implications and help to model services at a local authority level. Using publicly available aggregate

126

Local Authority District (LAD) data, we undertook a multivariable, multivariate ecological study of

127

SARS-CoV-2 infection related deaths in England, Scotland and Wales in hospitals, care homes and at

128

home. We anticipated that these data would: i) generate further data-driven hypotheses regarding

129

risk factors for death related to COVID-19 at a local authority level; ii) identify differences between

130

risk factors for COVID-19 related deaths and deaths due to all other causes; and iii) identify risk

131

factors specific to hospital, care home and at home COVID-19 related deaths.

132
133

Aim

134
135

To undertake a preliminary hypothesis-generating analysis to explore putative risk factors for novel

136

coronavirus (COVID-19) population-adjusted death rates, compared with non-COVID-19 related

137

deaths, at a local authority district (LAD) level in hospital, care homes and at home.

138
139

Methods

140
141

We adhered to the Strengthening the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology (STROBE)

142

guidelines for the reporting of this observational study.[19]

Sources of data

145

All data used in the present analysis is free, publicly available, and open source.

146
147

Outcome

148

We used open-source government data for total English, Scottish and Welsh (hereafter referred to

149

as Great Britain (GB)) death registrations mentioning COVID-19 by LAD for week 16 obtained from

150

the Office for National Statistics (ONS) for England and Wales (registrations to 17 April 2020), and

151

from the National Records of Scotland (NRS) for Scotland (registrations to 19 April 2020).[20,21]

152

The International Classification of Diseases, 10 Edition (ICD-10) definitions are as follows: COVID-19

153

(U07.1 and U07.2).[22] At the time of analysis, Northern Ireland COVID-19 death registrations were

154

not available at a LAD level. Deaths rates were adjusted for GB LAD population obtained from the

155

ONS, per 100,000.[23] GB COVD-19 deaths per 100,000 by LAD were analysed altogether and

156

separately by location – in hospital, care homes and at home. All LAD deaths (except COVID-19) were

157

also analysed across the four settings by way of comparison.

158

Local authority district (LAD) level is the smallest division UK geographical area for which COVID-19

159

death rates are publicly released. There are 317 LADs in England made up of 36 metropolitan

160

boroughs, 32 London boroughs, 192 non-metropolitan districts, and 55 unitary authorities, as well as

161

the City of London and the Isles of Scilly. Scotland has 32 LADs equivalent to council areas, and

162

Wales has 22 LADs known as principal areas. In total, there are 371 GB LADs.

weather and air pollution; demographics and social influences; population disease rates and

168

behaviours; transport and information behaviour. After dummy coding, this resulted in 27 variables.

169

A literature search was conducted between 28 April and 4 May 2020 independently by SPL, DJL

170

and PKM via Pubmed, Google and Twitter (given the very preliminary nature of the literature

171

surrounding COVID-19 which is mainly available via expert opinion, government briefings and

172

preprint servers), using the search terms “coronavirus” OR “COVID-19” AND “risk” or “risk factors”.

191

obtained from 2011 Census data from the ONS for England and Wales,[28] and NRS for Scotland.[29]

192

Deprivation level for each LAD was defined as the proportion of the LAD’s lower super output areas

193

(LSOAs) in the most deprived 10% of all the constituent nation’s LADs using summary data provided

194

by the 2019 English (EIMD2019), 2020 Scottish (SIMD2020) and the Welsh (WIMD2019) indices of

195

multiple deprivation.[30–32] The proportion of care home residents self-funding – as a surrogate

196

marker for community wealth – was obtained for England regions in 2017 via a House of Commons

197

Library Briefing Paper and mapped to their LADs,[33] for Scottish LADs via the Care Home Census for

198

Adults in Scotland (2017),[34] and for Wales via a 2015 Public Policy Institute for Wales report.[35]

199
200

Population Disease Rates and Behaviours

201

For all health and illness LAD authority data, all LAD population prevalences were standardised

202

within the constitutive GB nation, to account for differences in methodology and time of their

203

measurement. Where data for a LAD was not available, health board (Scotland and Wales) or county

204

(England) level data was mapped to LAD. Cancer rates were obtained for England as ‘incidences of all

205

cancers, standardised incidence ratio 2012 – 16’ via Public Health England (PHE),[36] for Scotland as

206

Quality Outcome Framework (QOF) 2015 prevalence via gpcontract.co.uk,[37] and for Wales as QOF

207

2019 prevalence via StatsWales.[38] Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) rates were

208

obtained for England as ‘estimated prevalence of COPD (all ages) 2015’ via PHE, and for Scotland and

209

Wales via QOF, as above. For Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) rates were obtained for England as ‘CKD

210

prevalence estimates for local and regional populations – 2015’ via PHE, and for Scotland and Wales

211

via QOF. For cardiovascular disease (CVD) age-standardised death rates per 100,000 for coronary

212

heart disease under 75s by LAD 2015/17 were obtained for all GB LADs via the British Heart

213

Foundation.[39] Diabetes rates were obtained for England as ‘estimated prevalence of diabetes

214

(undiagnosed and diagnosed) 2015’, and for Scotland and Wales via QOF. Dementia rates were

215

obtained for England as ‘dementia: QOF prevalence (all ages) 2018/19’ via PHE, and for Scotland and

217

218

were obtained as ‘Obesity: QOF prevalence (18+) 2018/19’ via PHE, for Scotland via the Scottish

219

Health Survey 2018,[40] and for Wales via the Welsh Health Survey 2015.[41] Rheumatoid Arthritis

220

(RA) rates were obtained for England as ‘rheumatoid arthritis: QOF prevalence (16+) 2018/19’ via

221

PHE, and for Scotland and Wales via QOF. Finally, current and ex-smoking rates were obtained for

222

England via the GP Patient Survey on PHE, and for Scotland and Wales via their respective 2018 and

223

2015 health surveys.

224
225

Transport and Information Behaviour

226

Population standardised flight passengers to and from each LAD were obtained via the Civil Aviation

227

Authority 2018 Passenger Survey, rounding down to the nearest 100,000 passengers per 100,000

228

people. Where necessary, county-level figures were divided across their constituent LADs according

229

to their relative populations.[42] Port activity statistics in tonnage were obtained from the UK

230

Government’s Department for Transport and mapped to the port’s LAD for all Major Ports with an

231

activity level greater than the largest Minor Port.[43] Lastly, Google search trend data – as a proxy

232

marker for information-seeking behaviour and public awareness – were obtained from Google

233

Trends for relative search volume for the term "Coronavirus" scaled by population per region (cities,

234

towns and areas of London) mapped to LAD, averaged between 1 February to 19 March 2020.[44]

Sample Size Calculation

237
238

Using Green’s method to calculate sample size for multiple ordinary least squares regression, we

239

would require a minimum of 266 observations for 27 variables (50 + 8 x number of variables).[45]

240

We had outcome data for all 371 GB LADs, exceeding Green’s criteria. Alternatively, using

241

G*Power,[46] at alpha 0.05 and power 0.80, the sample size and number of predictors is sufficient to

242

detect an overall model effect size of f = 0.07 (equivalent to R = 0.07).

Statistical Analysis

245
246

Univariate Analysis

247

Country was dummy coded with England as the reference group. Independent variables were

248

standardised to Z-scores. Missing data were handled by multiple imputation (chained equations

249

using predictive mean matching with five nearest neighbours; five imputations) and estimates were

250

pooled using Rubin’s rules.[47] Pearson’s correlation was assessed across the independent variables.

251

Separate multivariable linear regression models with the same independent variables were fitted by

252

ordinary least squares against two sets (COVID-19 deaths and all deaths except COVID-19) of four

253

different dependent variables: LAD deaths per 100,000 people in all settings combined, care homes

254

only, hospitals only, and, at home only. Coefficient estimates with 95% confidence intervals are

255

reported, along with the model’s adjusted R . Assumptions of homoscedasticity and normality of

256

residuals were checked for each outcome model and found not to be violated. We also conducted a

257

sensitivity analysis with robust standard errors which did not change the interpretation of the

258

results.

Multivariate Analysis

261

To establish whether independent variables which were statistically significant in explaining COVID-

262

19 LAD deaths in the univariate multiple regression were the same or different to independent

263

variables which explained all LAD deaths (except those caused by COVID-19), a multivariate

264

multivariable analyses (otherwise known as seemingly unrelated regression) was undertaken within
12

265

each of the four settings. That is, for each multivariate analysis, two dependent variables, LAD

266

COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 and all LAD deaths (except COVID-19) per 100,000, were regressed

267

against the same 27 standardised independent variables. A type II multivariate analysis of variance

268

(MANOVA) was conducted to assess if the independent variables’ coefficients remained significant in

269

the multivariate multiple regression model via Pillai’s trace. Then, the equality of each multivariate-

270

significant independent variable’s coefficient across the two dependent outcomes was tested using a

271

Wald test, with the null-hypothesis being that the coefficient magnitude was equal for both

272

dependent outcomes (i.e. two-tailed). Significance for the Wald tests was corrected for multiple

273

comparisons by controlling for the false discovery rate. The dependent variables were standardised

274

before performing the Wald tests, to enable a like-for-like comparison across coefficients, given that

275

the outcome prevalence was much larger for deaths except COVID-19 than for COVID-19 deaths. As

276

pooling across the five imputed datasets was not possible for the MANOVA analysis, this analysis

277

and the Wald tests were based on the first imputed dataset only. Replicating the Wald tests with

278

Results

291
292

All LADs had complete outcome data. Eighteen of the independent variables had missing data with

293

obesity having the highest percentage missing at 6.5%. Summary statistics for the variables chosen

294

are openly available as referenced above. Across GB by week 16, there had been a total of 20,684

295

deaths registered mentioning COVID-19 including 3,627 in care homes, 15,668 in hospitals and 1,050

296

at home. Figure 1 shows the population-weighted deaths per 100,000 for COVID-19 by week 16 for

297

all settings across each LAD. Of the 371 GB LADs, Inverclyde had the highest reported COVID-19

298

deaths per 100,000 across all settings at 97.2, while only the Isles of Scilly had no reported COVID-19

299

deaths. Supplementary Figure 1 shows the population-weighted deaths per 100,000 for all causes

300

except COVID-19. Table 1 summarises these numbers. Figure 2 shows the univariate correlation

301

matrix for the putative risk factor variables.

302

Figure 3 summarises the results of the univariate multiple linear regression analyses for all settings

303

for LAD COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 (A) and all LAD deaths (except COVID-19) (B). Significant

304

predictors for COVID-19 related deaths at a local authority level included air pollution, deprivation,

305

and proportion of the population who are female. In contrast, higher temperatures, dementia, ex-

306

smokers and self-funding care were significantly protective factors against COVID-19 deaths. The

307

adjusted R² was 0.46 (95% CI 0.38, 0.53), with the model explaining 46% of the variance in the

308

outcome. Supplementary Figures 2-4 summarise the same analyses for care homes only, hospitals

309

only and at home only, respectively.

310

Table 2 shows the independent variables that were significant in the multivariable multivariate

311

analysis of both dependent death outcomes (COVID-19 related versus all except COVID-19 related

312

death rates) across all settings, along with the results of their Wald equality tests. These results

highlight significant differences between COVID-19 related and COVID-19 unrelated deaths after

314

correcting for multiple comparisons (†). The Wald test z-value shows the direction of significance

315

(positive value indicating that the risk factor is more strongly associated with COVID-19 related

316

deaths over COVID-19 unrelated deaths). Interpreting these data in the context of Figures 3A and

317

3B, we can conclude that air pollution (p = 0.007) and higher female population proportion (p =

318

0.036) are significant risk factors for COVID-19 related deaths at a local authority level compared

319

with all deaths except those related to COVID-19. In contrast, higher temperatures (p = 0.004) and a

320

higher proportion of ex-smokers (p = 0.002) are protective. Conversely, older median age (p =

321

0.007), higher rates of communal living (p <0.001), higher rates of CKD (p = 0.017), COPD (p = 0.003),

322

CVD deaths (p <0.001) and dementia (p <0.001) are more significant risk factors for deaths that are

323

unrelated to COVID-19 at a local authority level, whereas a higher number of flight passengers (p

324

<0.001) is relatively protective. Female population proportion was also a risk factor for COVID-19

325

unrelated death, but there was a significantly stronger association in the COVID-19 related death

326

model.

327

Supplementary Table 1 shows the significant results for the same multivariate analyses but the

328

respective deaths in care homes, hospitals and at home separately. These can be interpreted in the

329

context of Supplementary Figures 2 – 4. These data tell us that, relative to COVID-19 unrelated

330

deaths, deaths related to COVID-19 in care homes are predicted by being in Scotland (p = 0.008);

331

however, a higher proportion of ex-smokers (p <0.001) remains protective. Relative to COVID-19

332

related deaths, COVID-19 unrelated deaths in care homes are associated with higher median age (p

333

= 0.005) and higher rates of communal living (p <0.001), CKD (p = 0.026) and dementia (p <0.001),

334

but being in Wales (p = 0.028) is a protective factor.

335

Relative to deaths in hospital that are unrelated to COVID-19, COVID-19 related deaths in hospital

336

are higher in LADs with a higher population proportion of BAME origin (p = 0.006) and higher

337

proportion of women (p = 0.006), whereas higher rates of communal living (p = 0.021), self-funding

338

care homes (p = 0.019) and dementia (p = 0.016) are relatively protective. Risk factors for COVID-19

339

unrelated deaths in hospital (relative to COVID-19 related deaths) are being in Scotland (p = 0.012)

340

and Wales (p <0.001), as well as higher population prevalence of CKD (p = 0.002), COPD (p = 0.004),

341

CVD deaths (p <0.001) and current smoking (p = 0.020). Air pollution is a significant risk factor for

342

both COVID-19 related and COVID-19 unrelated deaths in hospital but is significantly more strongly

343

associated with COVID-19 related deaths (p = 0.015), in-keeping with the results for all combined

344

settings.

345

Finally, compared with COVID-19 unrelated deaths, COVID-19 death rates at home are higher in

346

LADs with a greater female population proportion (p = 0.023), whereas higher temperatures (p =

347

0.001) and rates of CVD deaths (p = 0.004) are relatively protective at the LAD level. COVID-19

348

unrelated deaths at home (relative to COVID-19 deaths) are more strongly associated with humidity

349

(p = 0.020) and higher rates of hypertension (0.025), whereas higher rates of cancer (p = 0.016) and

350

flight passengers (p = 0.013) are relatively protective.

Discussion

353
354

All Combined Setting Models

355
356

In this study of risk factors for COVID-19 related deaths, we have generated explanatory

357

multivariable regression models using the most granular publicly available demographic and

358

ecological data in Great Britain. In contrast with previously published population studies during this

359

pandemic period, we have incorporated both hospital and community death rates across Scotland,

360

England and Wales. Beyond simply identifying significant predictors of COVID-19 related deaths in a

361

multivariable model adjusted for all putative confounders, we have presented this in the context of

362

all GB deaths excluding those related to COVID-19 to identify factors which are significantly unique

363

to COVID-19, thereby minimising over-interpretation of our models and potential collider bias.[55]

364

From our data, we propose that air pollution (PM2.5 exposure) is the single biggest risk factor for

365

COVID-19 related deaths at a local authority level. In all settings combined, a 1SD increment in

366

population-weighted annual mean PM2.5 (equivalent to 2.00 ߤg/m3) was associated on average

367

with eight additional deaths per 100,000. A study from the United States similarly looked at PM

368

exposure, controlling for 20 potential confounding variables, and found that a small increase in long-

369

term fine particulate exposure (1 ߤg/m ) was associated with a significant increase in COVID-19

370

related death rates (8%).[12] Air pollution causes immune and inflammatory changes both within

371

the lung and systemically, which may be particularly relevant to the excess death rate in COVID-

372

19.[56] Air pollution is also significantly detrimental in the model of COVID-19 unrelated deaths, but

373

the magnitude of the effect is significantly greater in the COVID-19 model (Table 2). Interestingly,

374

our results show that air pollution is significantly positively correlated with higher temperatures

375

(Figure 2). However, a higher temperature is significantly protective against COVID-19 deaths in our

376

models – a factor which has been suggested previously and demonstrated in the first SARS-CoV

377

pandemic.[57]

378

In spite of consistent evidence showing that being male is a risk factor for in-hospital COVID-19

379

related deaths, we have shown that, at the LAD level, a higher female population proportion imparts

380

a significantly greater risk. This highlights the importance of careful interpretation of this ecological

381

study: the observation is not related to the rate of female deaths but rather indicates that more

382

deaths overall occur in LAD areas in which more women reside. The underlying relationship between

383

this population-level finding and the observed greater risk of COVID-19 related death among men at

384

the individual level is likely to be complex. A potential explanation might be that women are more

385

likely to be asymptomatic carriers and perpetuate the spread of disease in communities. Indeed, in a

386

study of all women being admitted to an obstetric unit in New York, 88% of all women positive for

387

SARS-CoV-2 were asymptomatic.[58] Women are also more likely to be employed in care-giving roles

388

and involved in direct community infection control measures, such as at testing centres, and this

389

may be a further potential route of transmission.[59]

390

We observe that a higher rate of ex-smokers in the population is associated with a lower rate of

391

COVID-19 related deaths at the LAD level. Current smoking is not significant in the all combined

392

settings model, but the coefficient is still negative (Figure 3A). While this observation may seem

393

counterintuitive in the context of a respiratory infection, it confirms previous similar findings.[60]

394

Researchers in France have found that smokers were significantly less likely to develop a

395

symptomatic or severe infection from SARS-CoV-2.[61] One possible theory is that nicotine

396

depresses expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors (the functional receptor for

397

SARS-CoV-2)[61], though this effect might be attenuated over time in the case of ex-smokers. Other

398

hypotheses may relate to immunomodulation via nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, leading to

399

decreased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, thereby dampening local

400

inflammation; this mechanism has been suggested in ulcerative colitis where smoking is a known

401

protective factor.[62] The older median age in the LAD is a significant predictor of death only in the

402

model with all deaths excluding those related to COVID-19. Older age has previously been shown to

403

be a significant predictor of in-hospital COVID-19 related deaths.[5,60,63] In view of the aggregate

404

nature of our results, they do not contradict this but rather highlight that, compared to deaths in

405

LADs from all other causes, COVID-19 disease also raises the risk of death in younger people.

406

While population prevalence of other illnesses (CKD, COPD, CVD deaths and dementia) were

407

significant predictors of COVID-19 unrelated deaths, these were not significantly associated with

408

outcome in the COVID-19 model. Again, this cannot be extrapolated to individual patient risk but

409

does suggest that SARS-CoV-2 related deaths are not patterned according to chronic disease

410

prevalence at the LAD level compared with deaths from other causes. It is also possible that SARS-

411

CoV-2 infection contributed to all-cause deaths, driven by these risk factors, without these deaths

412

being laboratory-confirmed or COVID-19 suspected and entered on the death certificate.

413

Alternatively it may be that individuals with a high burden of disease have experienced excess

414

deaths in the context of reduced general healthcare provision due to scaling back of services during

415

the pandemic and public concerns about accessing healthcare. Future research should focus on

416

‘excess mortality’ which is the number of deaths recorded during the present pandemic above the

417

level we would have expected under ‘normal’ conditions and would capture all deaths caused by

418

COVID-19, not just those suspected and registered.[64] At the time of analysis, these data was not

419

available at a local authority level.

420

LADs with higher levels of recorded flight passengers have lower death rates for all deaths except

421

those related to COVID-19. This is correlated with population density and is negatively correlated

422

with median age and so may reflect a younger, more active population. This protective effect is not

423

seen in the COVID-19 model, perhaps due to a detrimental influence of flight activity on population

424

movement and spread in the context of this highly transmissible disease.

425

Contrary to expectations of a highly contagious disease, population rates of communal living did not

426

significantly associate with COVID-19 related deaths and, if anything, had a negative coefficient. On

427

exploring this further, we note that communal living includes those in protected settings where

428

perhaps strict social distancing measures can be implemented. Further, of the 1.8% of the GB

429

population that reported living in a communal setting, only 31.2% were over the age of 65; the

430

biggest contribution was from 16-24 year olds (39.2%). This group have among the lowest risk of

431

COVID-19 death. Again, there may be an ecological explanation for this apparent anomaly – the

432

highly mobile nature of the 16-24 year old population who are mostly in education may have meant

433

that on the institution of the national lockdown, these groups returned ‘home’ to their local

434

authority of origin where they had resided prior to entering education (e.g. to their parent or

435

guardian’s accommodation). This would deflate the actual population for the LAD in which the

436

communal living establishment was based without altering the denominator population-based on

437

mid-2018 estimates and thus leading to a lowered death rate per 100,000 than would otherwise be

438

expected.

439

Deprivation prevalence at the LAD level is a risk factor for COVID-19 deaths and COVID-19 unrelated

440

deaths, but there is no statistical difference between the two, suggesting that it is not a factor

441

unique to COVID-19. A higher rate of care home self-funding is strongly negatively correlated with

442

LAD deprivation and, indeed, appears to be protective against COVID-19 related deaths (though,

443

again, this is not significantly different relative to COVID-19 unrelated deaths).

444

While it has been noted that many people of BAME origin have died from COVID-19 disease, we find

445

that having a higher proportion of BAME residents at the LAD level does not significantly associate

446

with COVID-19 related deaths in the combined settings model. This may reflect the larger urban

447

setting of BAME people and the correlated risks of air pollution and flight passenger numbers, which

448

we accounted for in our analyses.

449
450

Care Home, Hospital and Home Setting Models

451
452

Examination of settings separately highlighted setting-specific features. In the care home setting,

453

Scotland LADs were significantly associated with COVID-19 related deaths, compared with those in

454

England. Further investigation may elucidate reasons behind this observation, perhaps related to

455

policy differences on criteria for hospital admissions. Rising death rates in Scottish care homes has

456

recently prompted specific intervention from the Scottish Government.[65] In the care home setting,

457

dementia is a significant risk factor for COVID-19 unrelated deaths only, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2

458

infection is not dependent on this factor. While not reaching significance in the all combined settings

459

models, LADs with a higher proportion of people of BAME origin have significantly more COVID-19

460

related hospital deaths, in-keeping with publicised figures.[66,67] As higher proportions of BAME

461

individuals is strongly positively correlated with population density and negatively correlated with

462

higher median age, we hypothesise that younger people living in urban areas are more likely to

463

receive hospital-level care. We also observe that air pollution and a higher proportion of females in

464

the LAD are also strongly associated with hospital COVID-19 deaths. Hospital deaths are the biggest

465

contributor to all COVID-19 related deaths and so these findings are understandably similar to those

466

in the combined settings model. Dementia is a relative protective factor for COVID-19 related

467

hospital deaths, perhaps suggesting that individuals with dementia are less likely to be admitted to

468

hospital. Finally, in a home setting, as with the combined model, LADs with a higher level of flight

469

passengers have lower death rates for COVID-19 unrelated deaths but not for COVID-19 related

470

deaths. Again, this may suggest an influence of movement of young and mobile individuals returning

471

home from other countries or regions on SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

472
473

Limitations

474
475

We have reported aggregate data related to local authorities in GB. We acknowledge that such data

476

should not be used to make inferences about individual outcomes (the ecological fallacy). Indeed,

477

one recent study observed that living further from the

478

associated with reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection[68]. However, ecological studies do allow us to

479

make inferences about population for public health intervention and are important for hypothesis

480

generation.[69] Further, our study may provide clarity regarding some factors which are only

481

relevant at a local or population level when controlled for societal confounders, such as pollution

482

and climate.[69]

483

In multivariable models such as ours in which all predictors are modelled together, the

484

interpretation that each predictor is ‘mutually adjusted’ for the others is problematic when some

485

predictors in fact form a mediating pathway towards the outcome. Although we have identified

486

certain risk and protective factors whose association with the outcome is statistically significant even

487

when other covariates are in the model, we have not attempted to conceptualise these in a causal

488

order. Future research using individual-level data should consider plausible hypotheses to be tested

489

in path models, to identify the likely temporal order of risk factors and the optimum point along the

490

path at which an intervention could be targeted.

491

If data regarding a predictor was available, and measured in the same way at a GB-wide level, this

492

was used. Unfortunately, many of the putative predictor variables were recorded differently and at

493

different times, in the constituent nations of GB. To try to offset these differences, such predictors

494

were z-transformed within the constituent nation prior to their combination across nations. This

495

assumes that the mean and standard deviation of the predictor is similar within each nation. For

496

certain variables, for example deprivation, we know this to be untrue. Deprivation levels have been

497

found to be similar in Scotland and England, but relatively higher in Wales.[70]

498

Further, occupational risk factors were not included in this analysis. ONS Occupational Coding does

499

not provide sufficient detail to make assumptions about specific occupational exposure and it was

500

not possible to take into account the effects of furlough. Occupation may influence some of our

501

observations – for example, females are more likely to be employed in caring professions which may

502

perpetuate spreading of SARS-CoV-2.

503

Our study can be compared with that of the OpenSAFELY Group, who studied individual patient data

504

derived from primary care and linked hospital records, facilitating more accurate stratification of

505

patients by past medical history and demographic parameters[6]. While this study benefited from

506

better individual patient granularity, the platform only captures 40% of the population of England

507

and examines in-hospital deaths only. Our study, in contrast, is inclusive of all LADs in England,

508

Scotland and Wales and, uniquely, is informative regarding community death rates.

509

A number of our references relate to pre-prints and non-academic sources, as is to be expected in

510

the context of this rapidly evolving pandemic. While these need to be interpreted with caution, the

511

wealth of information available is testament to the combined efforts and transparency of our

512

research communities and associated open-access data.

514

Conclusions

515
516

From this ecological study of risk factors related to COVID-19 related deaths in GB, we have

517

identified significant predictors of death rates in LADs in COVID-19 related cases, in direct

518

comparison with cases not related to COVID-19. We have examined death rates across all hospital

519

and community settings, both combined and separately, and have highlighted factors that appear

520

more relevant in specific settings. We can now hypothesise that air pollution and a higher proportion

521

of females at the local authority level are significantly associated with COVID-19 related deaths. The

522

former is strongly associated and should prompt further studies of individual risk. The latter may

523

relate to asymptomatic carrier status. In contrast to COVID-19 unrelated deaths, COVID-19 related

524

deaths do not seem to be patterned by other illnesses or co-morbidities. Air temperature is

525

protective against COVID-19 deaths at a LAD level. Emergence of data regarding COVID-19 death

526

rate decline in different climates may further elucidate this observation. Ex-smoking appears to

527

protective factor, perhaps related to its modifications on the immune system; clinical trials of

528

immunomodulatory agents are in progress.[71] In specific settings, exploration of reasons behind

529

Scottish care home COVID-19 related deaths and BAME-associated hospital COVID-19 deaths is

530

merited. We anticipate that this comprehensive examination of community and in-hospital data

531

across GB will provide direction for regional and setting-specific research priorities.

Summary Box

535
What is already known on this topic

•

The novel SARS-CoV-2 virus has presented Great Britain with an unprecedented challenge
in the management and prediction of infection and mortality rates.

•

Several individual risk factors for COVID-19 disease mortality have been postulated,
including male sex, age, pollution, co-morbidty and ethnicity.

•

The influence and interactions of these factors across Great Britain, and in different care
settings, is unknown. Relationship of these factors to deaths unrelated to COVID-19 have
also yet to be explored.

What this study adds

•

In this ecological study of local authority death rates, air pollution was a significant risk
factors for mortality from COVID-19 across all care settings. Air temperature, however,
was protective.

•

Local authority being in Scottish was a significant risk factor for COVID-19 related deaths
in the care home setting.

•

Local authority having a higher proportion of people from black, Asian and minority ethnic
groups was a significant risk factor for COVID-19 related deaths in the hospital setting.

•

This study highlights the value of open access data in driving research and informing
public policy.

Comparison of Risk Factors for LAD Deaths from COVID-19 and Deaths Except COVID-19, in All

583

Settings Combined. The independent variables that were found to be significant in the multivariate

584

multiple regression model MANOVA are presented. For these significant variables only, the

585

equivalence of the variable’s coefficient was tested across both outcome models via a Wald test. If

586

the z value is positive, the independent variable is a relatively stronger risk factor for COVID-19

587

deaths (Model 1) compared to all deaths except COVID-19 (Model 2), or is more protective against

588

all deaths except COVID-19. If the z value is negative, the variable is a relatively stronger risk factor

589

for all deaths except COVID-19, or is more protective against COVID-19 deaths. For the Wald tests, †

590

indicates significance adjusted for multiple comparisons. The MANOVA p-values do not require

591

adjustment for multiple comparisons.
