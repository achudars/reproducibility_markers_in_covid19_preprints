A Systematic Review of Droplet and Aerosol Generation in
Dentistry
Abstract

Objectives:

Against the COVID-19 pandemic backdrop and potential disease transmission

risk by dental procedures that can generate aerosol and droplets, this review aimed to
identify

which

clinical

dental

procedures

do

generate

droplets

and

aerosols

with

subsequent contamination, and for these, characterise their pattern, spread and settle.

Data Sources:

Six

databases

were

searched

and

citation

chasing

undertaken

(to

11/08/20).

Study selection:

Screening stages were undertaken in duplicate, independently, by two

researchers. Data extraction was performed by one reviewer and verified by another.

Results:

Eighty-three studies met the inclusion criteria and covered: Ultrasonic scaling

(USS, n=44), highspeed air-rotor (HSAR, n=31); oral surgery (n=11), slow-speed handpiece
(n=4); air-water (triple) syringe (n=4), air-polishing (n=4), prophylaxis (n=2) and handscaling (n=2). Although no studies investigated respiratory viruses, those on bacteria,
blood

splatter

and

aerosol

showed

activities

using

powered

devices

produced

the

greatest contamination. Contamination was found for all activities, and at the furthest
points studied. The operator’s torso operator’s arm, and patient’s body were especially
affected.

Heterogeneity

precluded

significant

inter-study

comparisons

but

intra-study

comparisons allowed construction of a proposed hierarchy of procedure contamination
risk:

higher

risk

(USS,

HSAR,

air-water

syringe

[air

only

or

air/water

together],

air

polishing, extractions using motorised handpieces); moderate (slow-speed handpieces,
prophylaxis with pumice, extractions) and lower (air-water syringe [water only] and hand
scaling.

Conclusion:

Significant gaps in the evidence, low sensitivity of measures and variable

quality limit firm conclusions around contamination for different procedures. However, a
hierarchy of contamination from procedures can be proposed for challenge/verification
by

future

research

which

should

consider

standardised

methodologies

to

facilitate

research synthesis.

Clinical significance (49 words):
This manuscript addresses uncertainty around aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) in
dentistry. Findings indicate a continuum of procedure-related aerosol generation rather
than the current binary AGP or non-AGP perspective. This informs discussion around
AGPs and direct future research to help support knowledge and decision making around
COVID-19 and dental procedures.

Background
SARS-CoV-2 is the highly infectious virus which causes COVID-19 [1]. Transmission has
been thought to be primarily via respiratory droplets, direct contact and fomites. Virus
particles can be detected up to 72 hours after inoculation of plastic and steel surfaces [13]. However, SARS-CoV-2 has been found to remain viable in air for at least three hours
with growing evidence and concern over possible airborne transmission [2, 4].
Dental care involves close patient contact for prolonged periods leading to concern over
transmission through aerosol generation during dental procedures [5, 6], compounded
by consistent detection of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva [7]. In dentistry, universal precautions
have been standard practice, based on evidence-informed infection control. These evolve
as evidence emerges, particularly in response to blood and water borne infections and
prion transmission [8-10].
The term Aerosol Generating Procedure (AGP) has been described as, “any procedure on
a patient that can induce the production of aerosols of various sizes” although there is
currently no agreed definition and a confusing lack of consistency in terminology. The UK
National Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group has described “dental
procedures (using highspeed devices such as Ultrasonic scalers and highspeed drills)” [11]
as posing an increased risk of respiratory infection transmission. New terms such as
aerosol generating exposure (AGE) have been suggested [12]. Policy documents have
focused on ultrasonic scalers (USS), high-speed air-rotors (HSAR), air-water syringes (also
known as triple or 3-in-1), and air polishers as sources of aerosols, with rubber dam and
high-volume suction as mitigating measures [13-15].
To manage transmission risk of SARS-CoV-2, the extent and contamination of droplets
and aerosols involved in dental procedures need to be identified. Similarly, the pattern,
and timing, associated with spread and settle of droplets and aerosols in the context of
clinical dentistry need to be understood to inform policy on surgery fallow times between
patients. Globally specified patient spacing times for AGPs vary from none to 120 minutes
[16].
An aerosol is defined as a suspension of liquid or solid in air [17, 18]. When an aerosol is
created with a liquid, a wide range of droplet sizes are produced. Particle size is a
continuum, from larger heavier droplets, > 5 µm in diameter that fall rapidly to the
ground, typically within 1 m of the source as splatter. Aerosols are composed of droplet
nuclei ≤ 5 µm in diameter and can remain suspended in air for many hours and be moved
by air currents. At present, dental procedures are categorised dichotomously as either
aerosol producing or non-aerosol producing. The former refers to procedures considered
to produce smaller droplets of ≤ 5 µm and the latter referring to procedures that are
considered to produce few or no smaller droplets but may still produce larger droplets (>
5 µm). For the purposes of this review, aerosol will refer to suspensions of particles ≤ 5
µm in diameter.
This review aims to critically assess existing knowledge and reduce uncertainty around
dental procedures that generate droplets and aerosol, supporting policy making and local
IPC protocols.

Research question
What is known and what is not known about aerosols and droplets relevant to clinical
dentistry?
Objectives:
1. To identify and catalogue activities within clinical dentistry and the dental surgery
that generate aerosols and droplets
2. For these activities, to:
a. Characterise the pattern of droplet and aerosol spread and settle relevant
to the dental surgery and dental laboratories
b. Identify whether there is evidence of an association with exposure,
infection and transmission of pathogenic micro-organisms
c. List micro-organisms that have been studied
d. Record outcomes and outcome measures
3. To identify gaps in the evidence related to aerosols and droplets relevant to
clinical dentistry

Information Sources
Medline (OVID), Embase (OVID), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus,
Web of Science and LILACS databases were searched for studies meeting the inclusion
criteria and ClinicalTrials.gov was searched for recently completed, ongoing, or recruiting
trials from the start of the databases to May 2020. The search was updated on 11 August
2020 to identify new studies published since the original search was conducted.

Search
The search strategy (Appendix 2) comprised controlled vocabulary and keywords. The
references of all reviews, policy documents and included studies were screened for
eligible studies.

Screening and selection of studies
Titles and abstracts were deduplicated and screened in Rayyan [20] independently and in
duplicate by two reviewers. Where either reviewer considered a paper potentially eligible
for inclusion, the full text was sought. Full texts of potential articles were retrieved and
assessed independently and in duplicate. Full texts were exported into Endnote and a
database created in Excel. Differences were resolved by consensus involving at least one
other research group member.

Data extraction
A standardised data extraction form was developed a priori and refined based on repeat
pilot testing with a minimum of five publications and three data extractors. Eight
reviewers were trained in data extraction form completion. Reviewers extracted data
into an excel spreadsheet singly but consulted another reviewer where data reporting
was unclear. Key missing data items were managed by contacting study investigators
where possible. For studies where an intervention was measured for its ability to alter
droplet and aerosol spread, only data relating to the baseline or control (i.e. without the
intervention effect) was extracted.

Data items
The items of data extracted included: study demographics; dental procedures
investigated; methodology; findings – (related to the reviews’ outcomes). Detection
methods for contamination were categorised as microbial, blood and other (nonmicrobial/non-blood) methodologies.

Quality assessments
The quality of the papers (see Protocol in Appendix 1) was assessed. Increases in
evidence production aligning to infectious disease outbreaks was checked to investigate
publication bias.

Sensitivity assessments
The sensitivity of contamination assessment tools was assessed using schema tailored to
the individual methodologies: microbial measures; blood measures; other [non-

microbial/non-blood measures). These are presented overall for all studies and grouped
by procedure to allow a picture of the sensitivity of the methods used, and therefore
accuracy of the results in reflecting actual contamination. This allowed a judgement on
the likelihood of under- or over-reporting of contamination for each study, and by
procedure.

Relative contamination of procedures
Where methodology was similar enough to compare contamination levels or studies
included multiple procedures, the relative contamination levels between procedures
were examined.

Results
There were 83 studies (Appendix 3) which met the inclusion criteria and for which we
could obtain full manuscripts (see PRISMA flow chart Figure 1.).

Figure 1.

Studies originated from 24 countries, the majority conducted in the USA (n=26) and India
(n= 21). They were published between 1963 to 2020 with 43/83 (52%) of the studies
published in the last decade (Figure 2.)

Figure 2.

A full description of the studies’ characteristics and the data extracted can be found in
Appendix 4.
The extracted data were heterogeneous across key characteristics, including; aims,
methodology and outcomes. A narrative summary was undertaken and within study
comparisons of relative contamination made. Whilst there were no studies showing a
direct association between dental procedures with exposure, infection and transmission
of pathogenic micro-organisms (outcome 2b), there was evidence of contamination of
persons in the dental surgery and the surgery environment (surfaces, equipment etc.)
and air from all procedures investigated although the levels of contamination varied
(Appendix 4).
Approaches to the investigation varied: some studied procedures, some instruments and
some both. Data were separated into the following categories: USS (n=44 studies), HSAR
(n=31); oral surgery (n=11), slow-speed handpiece (n=4); air-water syringe (n=4), air
polishing (n=4), prophylaxis with cup and pumice (n=2) and hand scaling (n=2).

Settle plates were used in 48 studies, 12 used visual inspection and 23 used air samplers
(specific for aerosol). The main findings for each of the instruments/ procedure
categories is summarised below (n= number of studies), with further detail provided in
Table 1 and Appendix 4.

USS (n=44 studies)
All 37 studies with measures for droplet contamination (splatter) and where samples
were collected from the air (n=7) had positive findings including those that used high
volume and standard suction. There was greater droplet contamination within 1m
distance of the patient (n=8) [21-28]. The operator’s face (mask and visor area) were
heavily contaminated (n=10) as were areas closer to the patient (operator’s nearest arm)
(n=2) [27, 29]. When assessed, contamination was identified on the assistant’s face and

11
arm (n=4). The patient’s body was heavily contaminated and their chest one of the most
heavily contaminated areas. Contamination levels reduced with increasing distance from
the mouth. At the maximum measured distance of 3 m, contamination was identified. Air
sampling (n=3) found contaminated aerosol was generated during treatment [27, 30, 31]
with a small proportion detectable at four feet before returning to baseline two hours
post-treatment [30].

HSAR (31 studies)
There was wide variability in the procedures investigated: Restorative (n=27); cavity
preparation, gaining endodontic access, fixed prosthesis tooth preparation; and
Orthodontic (n=4); cement removal [following fixed appliances]; and procedural time (10
seconds to four hours). Contamination was detected on settle plates on surfaces across
all (n=15) areas measured up to three meters from patient mouth [23, 32].
Contamination levels were highest in front of the patient and reduced with increasing
distance from the mouth [21, 32, 33] and the lowest areas of contamination levels were
behind the patient [33]. One study found approximately 80% of aerosol settled
immediately following the procedure and reached baseline levels after two hours [30].
The operator, assistant and patient were consistently contaminated, most heavily on the
operator’s head and patient’s chest. One study directly compared both single and multisurgeries and found that contamination was detected over a larger distance when there
were multiple dental chairs in an area [30].

Oral surgery (n= 11)
Oral surgery involving removal of teeth, generally third molars, used motorised
handpieces of variable speeds (n=10; 1 assumed), reporting the use of irrigation (n=6),
intra-oral suction/aspiration (n=5) in single and multiple chair dental settings, found risk
of contamination (mostly blood, with evidence of anaerobic bacteria). Contamination was
present on the patient (chest and face), operator (face/head, arm/glove/cuff, chest,
abdomen, leg) and assistant (face/head, arm/glove/cuff, body) as well as the dental
operatory and air environment (< 1 meter). Surgeons and assistants wore surgical PPE
including gowns and the research was conducted in a range of settings, mainly dental
hospital outpatient facilities (n=10). Most evidence was of blood spatter (visible and
imperceptible) whilst microbiological examination was limited to aerobic testing.
Imperceptible blood splatter was significantly higher than visible stains. Very limited
evidence on extractions (n=2) suggests lower risk but not without risk of contamination.
Risk increased with time, type of procedure and decreased with distance.

Slow-speed handpiece (n=5)
Three studied removal of excess material following fixed orthodontic appliance treatment
[34-36] with air sampling equipment (to detect aerosol). Findings varied but could be
related to study design differences. Dawson et al. [36] and Day et al. [35] found a marked
increase in bacterial load during debonding and enamel cleaning compared to baseline

levels. Ireland et al. [34] detected particles (2µm to >30µm diameter) demonstrating
facilitation of aerosol and droplets.
With denture polishing and trimming [37, 38] microbiological contamination was highest
2 feet from the operatory position compared to 1ft and 3ft [37] and microorganisms such
as yeasts and Gram-negative bacteria were in the aerosol generated [38].

Air-water syringe (n=4)
All studies identified contamination following use [21, 39-41]. However, the extent of
contamination varied widely (n=3). Air and water used together (spray) generated more
than air alone and water alone the least [21, 39, 40]. Smaller particles remained in the
air for more than 6 hours [41]. Bacterial contamination from droplets was detectable at 4
feet from the patient [39] and 6 feet from patients [21]. These were the maximum points
sampled

Air polishing (n=4)
Air polishing demonstrated contamination of, in ascending order, the operator’s
forehead, operator’s mouth and patients’ chest. Contamination from air polishing was
found nine feet from the treatment area even in a surgery with 13 air changes/hour [42].

Prophylaxis (n=2)
Prophylaxis with cup and pumice (n=2), [21, 40] produced less contamination than airpolishing (n=4). It produced a higher rate of contamination than washing teeth with a
water stream, but lower than drying teeth with an air spray or using a high turbine with
water coolant, as measured using the same closed test chamber (n=1).

Hand scaling (n=3)
Hand scaling produced minimal contamination (two artificial environments; patients’
head in a closed experimental test chamber with side glove ports for the operator (n=1),
and a mannequin in a closed box (n=1). Levels of air contamination in the test chamber
were comparable to a clinical examination in the same experiment. When hand scaling
with orthodontic treatment was compared to HSAR contamination was much lower when
no powered instruments were used [33].

Relative contamination levels

Although there were 83 studies, the degree of heterogeneity in methodology meant it
was not possible to compare data between them. The outcome of interest was
contamination. It could be grouped as being microbial, blood and non-microbial/nonblood. However, within these, there were a large variety of outcome measures (Appendix
4). For example, even within those looking at colony forming units, the outcome

volume of sampled air (CFU/cm /min), Index of Microbial Air Contamination (CFU/m /h)
and rate of production (CFU/min).
However, it was evident that there was a hierarchy of contamination levels with some
procedures generating more contamination than others. A network diagram (Figure 3)
illustrates where intra-study comparisons exist. Data from these 13 studies were
tabulated (Appendix 5, Table 1) and compared for relative contamination levels within
studies (Appendix 5, Table 2).

Figure 3

These studies and their data were then categorised as higher, moderate and lower
relative contamination levels (Figure 4). This is a proposed hierarchy model and it should
be noted that positions denote relative positions along a spectrum rather than definitive
cut-offs between the three levels.
Figure 4

Quality Assessment
The quality assessment (Appendix 6) for the studies showed a mixed picture for each of
the seven domains; the majority of studies scored “high” quality for one domain
(controls), “moderate” for four (study funding, conflict of interest, procedure description
and outcome reporting) and “low” for two (equipment use and sample size).

Sensitivity
Across all studies, for detecting contamination, 59 were rated as low sensitivity, 11 were
moderate and 11 as having a high sensitivity. Sensitivity gradings for each procedure and
by study are detailed in Appendix 6.

Discussion
The 83 studies included in this review looked at eight different activities classified as;
USSs, HSAR and slow-speed handpieces, oral surgery, air-water syringe, air polishing and
hand scaling. There was heterogeneity between methodologies used to investigate
contamination and a lack of consistency even when the same methodology was used by
different studies. Few studies used a high sensitivity measure making under-reporting of
levels of contamination a concern. Despite the variable methodology and broadly low
sensitivity of the methods used, all activities and all studies identified contamination
from droplets that had either settled (splatter) or droplet nuclei remaining in the air as
aerosol and at the furthest points studied.
Contamination levels varied with some activities such as hand scaling generating
contamination no greater than occurs during speaking [21]. The greatest levels of
contamination were found with procedures involving powered devices and water (HSAR
and USS). Devices that used air and water together also generated splatter and aerosol
and highest nearest the patient. It was not possible to draw conclusions around the use
of the slow-speed handpiece with any certainty because no study compared it with
anything else for either use of carious tissue removal or orthodontic cement removal.
Although dental procedures are commonly categorised dichotomously as either aerosol
producing or non-aerosol producing, this is an over-simplification, bearing in mind that
while droplet nuclei ≤ 5 µm in diameter are categorised as aerosols, in reality droplet size
lies on a continuum. Since SARS-CoV2 transmission has been reported up to 4 m from the
source [43], aerosol transmission remains a possibility.
The majority of studies used a settle plate methodology which is limited to capturing
droplets which can carry viruses. Settle plates can detect droplets that have fallen onto a

surface. However, air turbulence caused by movement in the surgery may affect what is
captured. Air samplers, most of which actively sample the air in the room, will therefore
detect both aerosol and airborne droplets before they have fallen to ground (n=23
studies). Many of the studies that stated they were detecting aerosols, did not use a
methodology that investigated airborne transmission (i.e. droplets <5 µm) such as air
samplers. Most studies’ findings related to droplet splatter detected on settle plates.
However, both droplets and aerosols can carry viruses although the universal precautions
currently in use will provide protection from droplet transmission.
Although we identified 83 studies investigating eight different procedures, it was difficult
to draw definitive conclusions about relative droplet and aerosol generation between
procedures. Firstly, because diverse methodologies had been used and secondly, because
study quality was generally low, especially in relation to sensitivity of measuring
contamination. Low sensitivity could result in significant underestimates: for example,
saliva cultured under highly sensitive conditions will yield c 108 CFU/ml but only 105 -106
using low-sensitivity methods. Thirdly, all studies found contamination as far as they
measured it and most, for as long as they measured it – which begs the question as to
whether greater distances and times measured would have resulted in further positive
findings. There was also insufficient data to explore differences according to
environmental context such as ventilation or single/multi-chair surgeries (although where
multi-surgery environments were studied this showed contamination over larger
distances [30, 44].
There has been growing research in this area with over half of the studies being
published in the last decade. Most studies (n=62) used microbes purported to be from
the oral cavity to monitor contamination from procedures. All, apart from two looking at
the bloodborne virus Hepatitis B [45, 46] and three at fungi, investigated bacteria. None
of the studies investigated contamination by respiratory viruses. This is despite several
significant outbreaks of respiratory viruses where AGPs might have been a risk factor
(Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) 2003; Swine flu 2009; Middle East
Respiratory Syndrome in 2012). Viruses are difficult to culture, in comparison to bacteria,
which may account for this. Most of the studies looked at easily cultured oral bacteria as
surrogates of contamination from the droplets and aerosol generated from the
procedure. However, viruses are small (typically between 20-300 nm in diameter) and
can be carried in the same way as bacteria, therefore patterns of bacterial splatter and
aerosol can provide some information to inform viral spread.
None of the studies directly explored exposure (for the dental team or patient) to
potentially pathogenic micro-organisms. Studies did, however, identify significant
contamination relating to the operator’s head and the patient’s body when powered
devices (HSARs and USSs) were used. Visors, glasses and masks were often heavily
contaminated, with a small number of ultrasonic studies finding contamination under the
visor and mask. The body and operating arm of the operator were subject to significant
contamination and studies of the assistant found less contamination (although this varied
depending on the area of the mouth being worked on). Areas closest to the patient were
most affected. This has implications for decisions about personal protective equipment
and the coverage needed. The patient’s face and body were significantly contaminated as
a result of powered devices (HSARs and USSs) and were often measured in the oral
surgery procedures were also found to be contaminated. No studies investigated
contamination of other areas, notably the patient’s (and dentist’s) leg areas but there is
no reason to expect them to not be contaminated, given the spread noted across surgery
areas in front of the patient. This has implications for infection control measures.
Beyond time, distances and settings there were further obvious gaps in the data as a

whole. These include a lack of negative controls and baseline measures, clarity of
reporting over specific procedure times and time periods during and following them to
see when there was no longer contamination from the procedure. However, the most
concerning gap may be the general failure across the studies to report the limits of
contamination for distance and very few reporting on time for settle. Studies on
mitigating interventions (such as high-volume evacuators, HEPA filters, air changes etc.)
may be able to clarify this area further. However, it is encouraging to see more research
in the field being undertaken, with three papers published since this search was
undertaken, fitting the inclusion criteria [47-49] and one further paper [50]awaiting full
text assessment at the time of submission, hopefully these will add to the body of well
conducted research informing risk and risk mitigation in relation to AGPs.
This review has focused on droplet and aerosol contamination relating to specific dental
procedures, extending beyond previous work that looked at micro-organisms and
hazards generated in dental practice [51]. This provides evidence which may be used to
determine the baseline risks associated with dental procedures, helping dental
professionals to identify clinical situations with increased aerosol transmission risks
where mitigation would be strongly advisable.

Conclusion
Despite generally low sensitivity measures being used, there was evidence of
contamination of surfaces around the surgery environment/ personnel or contamination
in air from all procedures that were looked at: USS (n=44); HSAR (n=31 studies); oral
surgery (n=11), slow-speed handpiece (n=4); air-water (triple) syringe (n=4), air polishing
(n=4) hand scaling (n=2), prophylaxis with cup and pumice (n=2). There was evidence that
this varied by procedure type. Most studies used microbial surrogate measures (mainly
oral microbiota) and blood or colored water for detecting contamination following these
procedures. None looked at respiratory viruses. The variability in methodology and
variety of outcome measures thwarted attempts to synthesise across studies. By looking
at comparisons of procedures within studies, blunt generalisations could be made over
higher, moderate and lower risk procedures. There are significant gaps in the evidence
and its quality that limit conclusions around all aspects of contamination for different
procedures. These hamper evidence-based clinical recommendations and policy decision
making, especially relevant for dentistry and COVID-19.

Table 1 Main characteristics of the included studies categorised by dental procedure/
instrument use (n=83). Please note that the numbering in this table refers to the list of
references (included studies) in Appendix 3 and are not the same numbering system as
found in the main text.

(PRISMA) (Moher et al. 2009) flow chart. A full description of study characteristics
can be found in Appendix 4.
Figure 2. Publications by date (n=81; 2 publications from 2020 were not included).
Figure 3. Network diagram illustrating where studies included comparison
between different procedures within them. (See also Appendix 5). The nodes
represent the eight procedures and the lines between them show where a study
compares them. The number of studies is shown by ‘n=’ and also the relative
thickness of the lines. Where a node has no linkages, there are no studies
comparing it with another procedure.
Figure 4. Proposed levels of contamination associated with different procedures,
drawn from Appendix 5 showing levels of contamination within studies to
minimize dissimilarities in methodology, procedures and outcomes that might
account for differences. Note that this must be interpreted with caution and will
need to be modified as further evidence becomes available. *Indicates very low
certainty.
