Abstract

35

Background

36

Serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies provides important research

37

and diagnostic information relating to COVID-19 prevalence, incidence, and host

38

immune response. A greater understanding of the relationship between functionally

39

neutralising antibodies detected using microneutralisation assays and binding

40

antibodies detected using scalable enzyme immunoassays (EIA) is needed in order

41

to address protective immunity post-infection or vaccination, and assess EIA

42

suitability as a surrogate test for screening of convalescent plasma donors. We

43

assessed whether neutralising antibody titres correlated with signal cut-off ratios in

44

five commercially available EIAs, and one in-house assay based on expressed spike

45

protein targets.

46

Methods

47

Sera from individuals recovered from patients or convalescent plasma donors who

48

reported laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (n=200), and negative control

49

sera collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (n=100) were assessed in parallel.

50

Performance was assessed by calculating EIA sensitivity and specificity with

51

reference to microneutralisation.

52

Results

53

Neutralising antibodies were detected in 166 (83%) samples. Compared with this,

54

the most sensitive EIAs were the Cobas Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (98%) and Vitros

55

Immunodiagnostic Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (100%), which detect total antibody targeting

56

the N and S1 antigens, respectively. The assay with the best quantitative relationship

57

with microneutralisation was the Euroimmun IgG.

Conclusions

59

These results suggest the marker used (total Ab vs IgG vs IgA), and the target

60

antigen are important determinants of assay performance. The strong correlation

61

between microneutralisation and some commercially available assays demonstrate

62

their potential for clinical and research use in assessing protection following infection

63

or vaccination, and use as a surrogate test to assess donor suitability for

64

convalescent plasma donation.

Introduction

71

The easing of COVID-19 control measures requires extensive surveillance for the

72

early detection of new clusters, as well as an understanding of the level and duration

73

of protective immunity in the community. Serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 specific

74

antibodies is an important tool that serves multiple diagnostic and research purposes

75

including: i) confirmation of suspected infection, ii) informing public health policy by

76

determining the true infection rate (symptomatic and asymptomatic cases) occurring

77

within a population, iii) assessing seroconversion following infection or vaccination

78

and iv) as a potential scalable screening test to determine suitablitiy for convalescent

79

plasma donation (1-4).

80

It is important to decipher the neutralising capability of developed SARS-CoV-2

81

specific antibodies to understand whether the host response will provide sufficient

82

protection from future reinfection. Neutralising antibodies can be detected using the

83

microneutralisation assay and plaque reduction neutralisation test. These assess the

84

ability of patient-derived serum samples containing SARS-CoV2 specific antibody to

85

inhibit infection of cells cultured in vitro (5). These virus neutralisation tests require

86

the handling of replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 in specialized containment

87

laboratories (biosafety level 3, at minimum (6)), and for this reason are impractical to

88

scale. Commercially available serology tests such as enzyme immunoassays (EIA)

89

are faster and less laborious than traditional culture-based methods, which is

90

advantageous in the diagnostic laboratory setting (7). However, these assays do not

91

differentiate between binding antibodies and neutralising antibodies (8). The

92

detection of binding antibodies does not necessarily confer virus-neutralisation or

93

protection against virus replication in the infected host, and traditional virus

94

neutralisation tests remain the reference standard (9). Correlation of binding

95

antibodies detected using EIA with neutralising antibody titres will be crucial for

96

population-level screening of seroconversion and assessment of herd-immunity

97

following vaccination and rapid assessment of the suitablity of convalescent plasma

98

donors (4, 10).

99

In response to demand for SARS-CoV-2 serological testing kits, numerous assays

100

have been released under relaxed regulatory assessment criteria (1). Validation

101

studies by end-users are important to assess the performance characteristics of

102

these new commercial assays, and to determine the correlation between EIAs and

103

neutralising antibody titres. To date, a small number of studies have validated a

104

range of commercially available SARS-CoV-2 serological assays against a live-virus

105

neutralisation test (11-15). Assays assessed in these publications incorporate

106

automated platforms as well as serology-based point of care tests and have some,

107

but limited crossover with the comparison of EIAs in the present study. Others tested

108

too few samples to effectively correlate EIA resuts with neutralising antibody titres

109

(16-20), lacked comparison of head-to-head EIAs (21, 22), or used live-virus

110

neutralisation as a reference standard primarily to validate assays developed in-

111

house (23-26). Here we report on the performance of a unique set of five

112

commercially available SARS-CoV-2 serological assays and an in-house developed

113

EIA, with reference to a reference-standard microneutralisation assay.

Methods

119

Sample collection and testing

120

All samples were received by the Serology and Virology Division at the Prince of

121

Wales Hospital Randwick, Australia. Two hundred sera were collected from

122

laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients (n=157) between March and June of 2020.

123

The majority were recruited as convalescent plasma donors (self-reported laboratory

124

confirmed infection) and tested as part of the release test to ensure donor suitablity

125

on behalf of Australian Red Cross Lifeblood (161 samples from 124 donors). Donor

126

samples were collected 37 to 101 days post- test postivitity date (mean=60·5). The

127

donors ranged in age from 20 to 78 years old (mean =45·3 years) with 54.6% being

128

males. A smaller proportion of serum (39/200), were obtained from COVID-19

129

patients 1 to 47 days post- laboratory-confirmed diagnosis. An additional 100 sera

130

were obtained from patients prior to the COVID-19 pandemic between 2016 and

131

2018 (control cohort). This included 25/100 samples serologically positive for

132

antibodies to common respiratory viruses (Supplementary Table 1). Antibodies to

133

SARS-CoV-2 in samples were measured using a microneutralisation assay at two

134

dilutions (1:40 and 1:80), and up to six other immunoassays including an in-house

135

delveloped EIA. Commercially available assays were performed according to the

136

manufacturer’s instructions, using kits of the same lot number for all assays.

137

Samples returning equivocal/borderline results (as per the manufacturer-specified

138

range) were not included in sensitivity and specificity calculations.

141

Dilutions of test serum were prepared on a 96-well plate in duplicate in viral culture

142

media (MEM + 2% fetal bovine serum + 1x penicillin-streptomycin-glutamine). The

143

dilutions were incubated for one hour at 37°C with an equal volume of 200 TCID50

144

SARS-CoV-2 isolate. A suspension of Vero E6 cells containing 2x104 cells was

145

added to each well, and plates were incubated at 37°C (5% CO2) for three days. The

146

plates were observed for cytopathic effect and the neutralisation titre determined as

147

the dilution that conferred complete protection from infection in both replicates.

148

Neutralising titres of 1:40 and above were considered positive.

The Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG (Abbott Diagnostics, Australia) is a chemiluminecent

166

microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) for the detection of IgG antibodies to the

167

nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2 in serum and plasma. The platform

168

calculated a result by dividing the chemiluminescent signal from each sample with a

169

calibrated signal. The unit for the assay is Index (S/C) and the result was interpreted

170

as positive (≥1·4) or negative (<1·4).

assay (ELISA) based platform that utilizes recombinant S1 protein to bind anti-

175

SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in serum or plasma. Separate kits for the detection of IgG

176

and IgA were used. Photometric measurement of colour intensity was used to

177

calculate a ratio of the sample over the calibrator. The ratio was interpreted as

178

positive (≥1·1), borderline (≥0·8 - <1·1), or negative (<0·8).

The in-house ELISA was performed by coating 96-well microtiter ELISA plates with

182

biotinylated RBD antigen (Supplementary information), which bound SARS-CoV-2

specific antibodies. Diluted serum (1:101) or controls were added to respective wells

184

for one hour. Wells were aspirated and washed three times with wash solution (PBS

+ 1% Tween 20). A secondary antibody (antihuman-IgG conjugated with the enzyme

186

alkaline phosphatase, Virion/Serion) was then added to wells for 30 minutes to

188

addition of substrate solution (p-nitrophenylphosphate, Virion/Serion) for 30 minutes.

189

The stopping solution was then added (<0·1 N sodium hydroxide and 40 mM EDTA,

190

neutralising antibodies including 112 (67%) which were neutralising at the highest

211

dilution tested (1:80). No samples in the control cohort were positive for neutralising

213

Across all assays SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in 182/200 (91%) samples

Discussion

231

Serological assays need to have validated performance characteristics in assessing

232

SARS CoV-2 infection for diagnosis, surveillance and correlation with other assays.

233

Given neutralisation activity is important for immunity and for potential therapeutic

234

options such as convalescent plasma and immunoglobulin production, the major

235

strength of our study is that it is one of the few to validate serological assays for

236

SARS-CoV-2 against a virus neutralisation test. On reference testing, neutralising

237

antibodies were detected in 83% of samples, compared to EIA which detected

238

SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in 91% of samples across all assays. This was unsurprising

239

considering that not all patients with COVID-19 develop neutralising antibodies to

240

infection (27). For this reason, all assays produced false positives in reference to

241

microneutralisation, with Euroimmun IgG displaying the highest positive predictive

242

value and best correlation with neutralising antibody titres. Clinically, EIAs that

243

correlate strongly with microneutralisation are of importance considering that the

244

detection of neutralising antibodies may be useful in informing return to work and the

245

discontinuation of transmission-based precautions (1).

246

For the aim of detecting protective neutralising antibodies, the S1-based Vitros

247

Immunodiagnostic and the N-based Cobas Elecsys assays were most sensitive. A

248

previous study suggested that assays targetting RBD and N proteins were more

249

sensitive and better correlated with neutralisation titres than those targeting the S1

250

protein (23). Our testing of 300 samples found assay sensitivity to be dependent on

251

assay marker (total Ab vs IgG vs IgA), and quantitative relationship dependent on

252

the target antigen used – with the three spike-based assays best correlating with

253

neutralising antibody titre (Figure 2).

254

In line with other validation studies using composite reference standards (28-30), the

255

Euroimmun anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA was highly sensitive and specific.

256

However, the reported performance of the Euroimmun anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA ELISA

257

is mixed, and here we found it to have low sensitivity. IgG response is longer lived

258

(31) and these findings may be reflective of our cohort, which was primarily made up

259

of convalescent serum collected more than 36 days following laboratory-confirmed

260

infection. The performance of the Architect IgG assay in detecting neutralising

261

antibody was moderate, and in convalescent samples positivity was well below the

262

sensitivity values advertised by the manufacturer (74% vs 100%). This highlights the

263

importance of independent validation studies comparing a range of assays against

264

multiple reference standards. Interestingly, there were five convalescent sera from

265

reported laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients that returned negative results by

266

microneutralisation and all EIAs tested. This also occurred in a validation study and

267

could be explained by a failure to develop a measureable systemic antibody

268

response, clearance of infection via other immune mechanisms, or an initial false-

269

positive RT-qPCR result (32). Whilst donors in our study were required to confirm

270

they had laboratory confirmed infection to donate, proof in terms of visualisation of a

271

hard copy of the donors’ results did not occur. Therefore it is possible that donors

272

were non-compliant, or that the five samples in our study that were negative on all

273

assays had a biological absence of antibodies.

274

All assays other than Euroimmun IgA displayed excellent specificity in testing a

275

control cohort of pre-COVID-19 sera. The control cohort also included a small panel

276

of non-SARS-CoV-2 sera positive for other respiratory virus antibodies, and we

277

found no cross-reactivity on any of the assays used. Others have suggested that S1

278

and N are highly specific targets for SARS-CoV-2 serological analyses (23), and

279

these antigens largely form the basis of current commercially available assays. A

280

limitation of this work is that the timing of serum collection was not standardised, and

281

that samples obtained were not tested equally across all assays due to limitations in

282

sample volume and dead volume requirements of the automated EIAs. Nonetheless,

283

the relatively large number of samples run remains a strength of this study, and

284

allows for a head-to-head comparison of commercially available SARS-CoV-2

285

serological tests seen in few other studies.

286

We and others have shown that commercially available serological assays for

287

SARS-CoV-2 have varying performance that is dependent on both the platform and

288

marker used. The assay chosen by end-users should be tailored to specific

289

applications - for example, assays measuring antibodies to the nucelocapsid antigen

290

might be best suited to disease surveillence as spike-protein based vaccines

291

become available. During the COVID-19 pandemic, serological assays will be crucial

292

in answering questions of immune protection against reinfection. If convalescent

293

plasma or COVID-19 immunoglobulin is found to be a potentially effective

294

therapeutic intervention, high throughput serological assays that closely correlate

295

with neutralisation antibody levels are vital for scalability. As further testing platforms

296
