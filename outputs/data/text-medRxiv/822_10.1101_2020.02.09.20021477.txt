Abstract

13

Background

14

After the outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) starting in late 2019, a number

15

of researchers have reported the predicted the virus transmission dynamics. However,

16

under the strict control policy the novel coronavirus does not spread naturally outside

17

Hubei Province, and none of the prediction closes to the real situation.

18

Methods and findings

19

We used the traditional SEIR model, fully estimated the effect of control measures, to

20

predict the virus transmission in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei Province, and

21

Beijing. We forecast that the outbreak of 2019-nCoV would reach its peak around

22

March 6±10 in Wuhan and March 20±16 in Beijing, respectively. The infectious

23

population in Beijing would be much less (only 0.3%) than those in Wuhan at the

24

peak of this transmission wave. The number of confirmed cases in cities inside Hubei

25

Province grow exponentially, whereas those in cities outside the province increase

26

linearly.

27

Conclusions

28

The unprecedented province lockdown substantially suspends the national and global

29

outbreak of 2019-nCoV.

1. Introduction

33

A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) appeared in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei

34

Province in central China had triggered city closure on Jan. 23, 2020, and lockdown

35

of all major cities in the province a few days later (Fig. 1). At present, over 50 million

36

people are constrained locally. Due to the threat of 2019-nCoV to public health, World

37

Health Organization (WHO) declared novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak to be

38

“public health emergency of international concern” on Jan. 30, 2020 [1]

39

It is always a great challenge to fight effectively against a pandemic [2, 3],

40

especially when little is known about the new virus [4]. Ideally, governments,

41

communities and medical services take rapid, effective, rational, and proportionate

42

responses to such health emergencies; either minimalist or maximalist responses may

43

potentially be very harmful [5, 6].

44

To facilitate decision making against the 2019-nCoV, researchers had predicted

45

the transmission dynamics in different scenarios. Read et al. [7] estimated that only

46

5.1% (95% CI, 4.8–5.5) of infections in Wuhan were identified; ahead of 14 days,

47

they predicted the number of infected people in Wuhan to be greater than 250

48

thousand on Feb. 4, 2020. Read et al. [7] suggested, before the city closure of Wuhan,

49

that travel restrictions from and to Wuhan city are unlikely to be effective and 2019-

50

nCoV would outbreak in Beijing, Shanghai, etc. with much larger sizes. Leung et al.

51

[8] estimated the transmission dynamics of 2019-nCoV in six major cities in China

52

under six scenarios: 0%, 25%, 50% transmission reduction with and without 50%

53

mobility reduction. However, the assumption of 50% mobility reduction is much

54

lower than the real situation. China government enforced tourism ban on Jan. 24, and

55

carried out other control measures such as extending holidays, closing schools,

56

cancelling meetings, suggesting a 14-day quarantine after travel. In particular,

57

highway traffic control is strictly implemented in many cities, towns, and villages.

58

The majority of communities in large cities such as Beijing and Shanghai have closed

59

to visitors.

60

Under the circumstance of strict control measures, we forecast the transmission

61

dynamics of Wuhan and Beijing. Wuhan is the source of 2019-nCoV, suffered a long

62

history (two months) of virus transmission, with lack of medical resources to

63

quarantine exposed and suspect people. Beijing is a larger city with 22 million

64

residents, including 10 million inbound passengers after the holidays of Chinese New

65

Year. We believe our estimation is close to the real situation and is helpful for 2019-

66

nCoV control.

where S is the susceptible population, E is the exposed population, I is the infectious

78

infected individuals per infectious subject per unit time, α is the reciprocal of average

79

latent period, v is the rate of recovery (reciprocal of duration of the infection).

80

We assumed the infection rate of the novel coronavirus decreased when

81

temperature goes up starting from March 1, 2020, since other viruses have a seasonal

82

pattern (wave), such as the 2009 H1N1 pandemic [10]. As such, we defined the

83

decreasing infection rate exponentially as below:
𝛽𝑡 = 𝛽 × (1 − 𝐶)𝑡−90 (Equation 2)

84

where βt is the infect rate at the time t (the first day, t = 1, is Dec. 1, 2019, based on

85

the first confirmation of 2019-nCoV on Dec. 8); C is a constant (simulated at 0.01-

86

0.1) defining the decreasing rate of transmission per day.

For the cities with continuous imported infected people, we modify the growth
rate of infectious population as:

where imported is the daily number of imported infections.

2.2. Determination of Model Parameters

92

The basic reproductive number R0 for 2019-nCoV had been estimated in several

93

independent studies (Table 1). It was noticed that changes in reporting rate of

94

confirmed cases substantially affected R0 estimation [11]. In fact, R0 is highly

associated with the intensity of control measures. We used a series values of R0 to fit

the number of cases in Wuhan and Beijing.

The mean value of R0 in Table 1 is 3.51, and the mean CV (coefficient of

The incubation period (1/α in SEIR model) was estimated as 6.4 (95% CI: 5.6 -

101

7.7) days, ranging from 2.1 to 11.1 days [14]. Liu et al. [12] provided a lower value,

102

4.8 days, for the period. Based on information from other coronavirus diseases, such

103

as SARS and MERS, the incubation period of 2019-nCoV could be up to 14 days

104

[15]. We used 6 days as the incubation period for our simulation.

105

Other model parameters are: population size of Beijing and Wuhan are 22

106

million and 10 million, respectively, based on the data (for 2018) provided by

107

National Bureau of Statistics of China at

108

http://data.stats.gov.cn/easyquery.htm?cn=E0105. The proportion of susceptible is

109

50% of the total population. The rate of recovery ν = 1/5 per day. The basic

110

reproductive number R0 does not directly used in the SEIR model. It has the following

111

function with the model variables and parameters: R0 = β/ν x S/N.

124

We simulated the virus transmission process using the SEIR model and

125

estimated the model parameters for Wuhan (Fig. 3) and Beijing (Fig. 4). For Wuhan,

126

we first fit the number of confirmed cases (Fig. 3A), where the R0 is 5.75, much

127

higher than that in most studies yet lower than Tang et al.’s result (Table 1). Due to

128

the reality that a number of infected people in Hubei Province have not been checked

129

[7, 8], we fit a more realistic transmission dynamics, under a condition of a fixed

130

starting day on Dec. 1, 2019 (Fig. 3B). The best fit model having the R0 5.0. After the

131

city closure on Jan. 23, the residents of Wuhan performed strong self-protection by

132

isolating themselves at home, so that we halved basic reproductive number to 2.5,

133

reflecting the pattern of family cluster infection of the virus. Since Feb. 8, a door-to-

134

door check was started in Wuhan in order to take all confirmed and suspected people

135

into medical care, and the transmission between family members dropped greatly. As

136

such, we further decrease the R0 to 1.5. With these transmission rates, the infectious

137

population could reach the peak of 1.75±2.12 x 105 on March 6±10, 2020. The

138

warming climate, based on Equation 2, may shorten the transmission duration by 1-2

139

months (Fig. 3D).

140

For Beijing, about half of the infections were directly imported from Wuhan [8].

141

We assume the infection flow would last for 30 days (from Jan. 19 to Feb. 18), caused

142

by the 10 million people leaving the returning Beijing for holidays. We simulated the

143

numbers of imported cases and found the best fit of daily imported cases for the 30

144

days following a normal distribution, with mean value and SD to be 19 ±12.7

145

individuals / day. To estimate the fluctuation of this time series of imported cases, we

146

calculated the standard deviation of the mean value (19 individuals / day) of the daily

147

imported patients from Jan. 19 to Feb. 8, which is 3.67. We adopted this uncertainty

148

to run 200 simulation, and found the R0 1.4 is the perfect fit (Fig. 4A). Considering

149

the strict community locking (close to any visitors) and other extreme control

150

measures (such as office building control, i.e. checking body temperature for every

151

one and refusing visitors) in Beijing, we adopted a lower R0 1.2 after the first 30 days

152

of transmission. The uncertainty of R0 was simulated with CV = 15% (see Table 1),

153

and the results indicate that the infectious population may reach 607±553 on March

154

20±16 (Fig. 4B). The uncertainty of the transmission dynamics, as simulated by the

155

SEIR model, is very high due to large variance in imported cases and R0 (Fig. 4).

4. Discussion

174

We simulated the transmission dynamics of 2019-nCoV, with taking into account of

175

the strict control measures enforced in the two cities. For Wuhan, city closure was a

176

chock upon the local residents and they took much better protection than before.

177

Accordingly, we halved the R0 after the city closure. As to Beijing, strict control

178

measures have been implemented. As a result, the local infection happened only 41

179

times until Feb. 3, with 124 people infected, which equals to half of the confirmed

180

cases [16]. The dynamics of virus transmission are dramatically different within and

181

without Hubei Province (Fig. 2), so that we gave different model parameters for the

182

two cities. Our results about infectious population in Wuhan is lower than Read et

183

al.’s estimation by 60%. Our estimation for Beijing is also much lower than the

184

prediction of other studies [e.g. 7, 8]. We believe we provide a more realistic forecast,

185

as we are witnessing the strict prevention activities carried out by all organizations

186

and local communities in Beijing, and the linear increase (not exponential increase) of

187

daily confirmed cases has proved the effectiveness of control measures.

188

China is running an antivirus campaign against 2019-nCoV. Besides the

189

lockdown of Hubei Province, many cities blocked the highway and stopped the traffic

190

through their domain. The longest vacation (for Chinese New Year) had been

191

extended twice. The majority of people quarantine themselves at home for 14 days

192

after travel. All domestic and international tourism were cancelled and banned.

193

Numerous meetings, games, shows have been postponed. Schools are still closed.

194

Compared with the prevention measures against SARS 17 years ago, this campaign

195

has much stricter control on local communities (only accessible to residents). In the

196

meantime, every people wear a musk during outdoor activities. Mandatory quarantine

197

for close contactors is not enforced at this time.

198

There are three difficulties in the antivirus campaign. 1. The incubation period

199

of 2019-nCoV is long. 2. Some patients have no symptoms yet they are infectious.

200

Although a case of no symptom transmission [17] had been proved flaw [18], more

201

other cases had been reported in many sources such as newspapers, website, and

202

Wechat, etc. The current prevention method, body temperature checking, could not

203

detect such people. 3. The false negative rate of 2019-nCoV diagnosis is high. For

204

example, Dr. Wenliang Li (WHO Twitter mourned his death due to 2019-nCoV on
10

205

Feb. 6, 2020) had mentioned at his Wechat account that the nucleic acid detection for

206

him was negative, when he suffered breath difficulty. We think it would have a longer

207

fight (Fig. 3 & 4) against 2019-nCoV than SARS and MERS.
Wuhan can represent the situation of other cities in Hubei Province. After the

208
209

lockdown, these cities are isolated. Even over ten thousand medical workers from

210

other cities all over China have entered Wuhan for help, the infectious population is

211

still too large to be taken care of. However, starting from Feb. 2 and Feb. 8, two newly

212

established hospitals (Huoshenshan and Leishenshan Hospitals) with altogether 2500

213

beds for infectious patients have been already in service. With square bay hospitals

214

having been built and coming into use, and a door to door checking of all residents in

215

Wuhan started on Feb. 8, all infected and suspected people in Wuhan would be under

216

medical care. The infectious population in Wuhan, under the progressive prevention

217

activities, can be substantially lower (Fig. 3B) than the situation of natural

218

transmission of the virus.
Beijing is a representative of other large cities outside Hubei Province in China.

219
220

In Beijing, all confirmed and suspected cases have been taken into designated

221

hospitals, with their close contactors being tracked and quarantined in hotels or at

222

home. Similar controls are being implemented in other Chinese cities. The linear

223

increases of total number of confirmed cases (Fig. 2) indicates the spread of the virus

224

is under strictly control. The lockdown of Hubei Province substantially decreased the

225

imported infections, ensure the situation being manageable outside the province.
We kept the parameters of incubation period and serial interval constant for all

226
227

simulations. The uncertainty of these parameters also influences the results. The

228

estimation of R0, its variance, and the rate of susceptible population, as well as the

229

effect of control measures and warming climate, are relatively arbitrary. In spite of the

230

weakness, we provide a more accurate estimation than previous studies. We hope our

231

results are valuable for instructing further antivirus activities.
