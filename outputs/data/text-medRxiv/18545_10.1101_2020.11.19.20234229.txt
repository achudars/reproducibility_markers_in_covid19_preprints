One Sentence Summary: Microbial classifier highlights specific taxa predictive of SARS-CoV2 prevalence across diverse microbial niches in a COVID-19 hospital unit.
Abstract: Synergistic effects of bacteria on viral stability and transmission are widely documented
but remain unclear in the context of SARS-CoV-2. We collected 972 samples from hospitalized
patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), their health care providers, and hospital
surfaces before, during, and after admission. We screened for SARS-CoV-2 using RT-qPCR,
characterized microbial communities using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and
contextualized the massive microbial diversity in this dataset through meta-analysis of over 20,000
samples. Sixteen percent of surfaces from COVID-19 patient rooms were positive, with the highest
prevalence in floor samples next to patient beds (39%) and directly outside their rooms (29%).
Although bed rail samples increasingly resembled the patient microbiome over time, SARS-CoV2 was detected less there (11%). Despite viral surface contamination in almost all patient rooms,
no health care workers contracted the disease, suggesting that personal protective equipment was
effective in preventing transmissions. SARS-CoV-2 positive samples had higher bacterial
phylogenetic diversity across human and surface samples, and higher biomass in floor samples.
16S microbial community profiles allowed for high SARS-CoV-2 classifier accuracy in not only
nares, but also forehead, stool, and floor samples. Across distinct microbial profiles, a single
amplicon sequence variant from the genus Rothia was highly predictive of SARS-CoV-2 across
sample types and had higher prevalence in positive surface and human samples, even compared to
samples from patients in another intensive care unit prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. These
results suggest that bacterial communities may contribute to viral prevalence both in the host and
hospital environment.

Introduction

2

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of

3

a novel infectious disease, COVID-19, that has reached pandemic proportions. COVID-19 was

4

first detected in Wuhan, China, in patients with pneumonia in December 2019. This pandemic has

5

been characterized by sustained human to human transmission and it has caused more than 44

6

million cases and over 1.2 million deaths worldwide (as of 1 November 2020, WHO report). The

7

United States now has the largest number of cases worldwide at over 11 million as of November

8

20th, 2020 (1). COVID-19 is primarily transmitted via either respiratory droplets or aerosols

9

produced by an infected person and inhaled by another individual. Other routes of transmission

10

have also been proposed including fecal oral transmission (2, 3) and fomite transmission (4)

11

although the relative importance of various transmission routes is uncertain (5–8). The potential

12

role of fomite transmission is especially concerning as SARS-CoV-2 has been detected on a variety

13

of surfaces including plastic, stainless steel, cardboard, and copper, and in aerosols (9). A more

14

comprehensive understanding of what influences SARS-CoV-2 stability, transmission, and

15

infectivity is crucial to implementing effective public health measures.

16

Viruses exist in a complex microbial environment, and virus-bacterial interaction has been

17

increasingly documented in humans. In the animal microbiome, the gastrointestinal tract contains

18

the highest amount of bacteria and many virus-bacterium interaction studies have therefore

19

focused on enteric viruses. Gut bacteria have been shown to directly modulate enteric virus

20

infectivity via improving thermostability (10), increasing environmental stability (11), and

21

encouraging viral genetic diversity and fitness (12). Virus-bacterium interactions have also been

22

observed in upper-respiratory tract infections including influenza A (13, 14) and oral human

23

papillomavirus infection (15). Most recently, prevalent bacteria in the human microbiome have

24

been demonstrated to alter the human glycocalyx thereby modulating the ability of SARS-CoV-2

25

to bind host cells (16). Given the nature of known virus-bacterium interactions, we hypothesized

26

that virus-bacterium interactions may also exist in indoor spaces (the ‘built environment’).

27

The risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 is higher indoors than outdoors particularly in poorly

28

ventilated areas (17), and the built environment has a distinct microbiome (18). The built

29

environment microbiome is usually dominated by human-associated microbes (19), and it is

30

estimated that humans shed approximately 37 million bacterial genomes per hour into their built

31

environments (20). In a study following the building of a new hospital, we discovered that the

32

indoor spaces were colonized with microbes from patients and health care workers, and

33

metagenomic analysis was used to infer transmission between occupants via surface transmission

34

(21). To test whether specific bacterial taxa in the host or built environment influence SARS-CoV-

35

2 persistence, we collected samples from hospital surfaces, patients, and health care workers in the

36

intensive care unit (ICU) and medical-surgical floor during the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak

37

and screened for viral presence and microbial context.

SARS-CoV-2 detection across surfaces and patient samples

41

Sample collection for SARS-CoV-2 detection is typically performed using viral transport

42

media containing fetal bovine serum and a cocktail of antibiotics, which could negatively influence

43

studies of bacteria and other microbes (22, 23). For this study, swab samples were stored in 95%

44

EtOH, in order to inactivate the virus for safe transportation (24) while stabilizing the microbial

45

community (25). A total of 972 samples were collected longitudinally from 16 patients with

46

clinical laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (118 samples), 10 health care workers

47

assigned to these patients (113 samples), and 734 hospital surfaces either inside or immediately

48

outside of the patients’ rooms over the span of two months (Fig. 1A).

49

The 16 patients enrolled in this study ranged from age 20 to 84, with a median age of 49.5

50

(Fig S1). 31% were female and 69% were male, consistent with reports that men tend to experience

51

more severe COVID-19 symptoms (26). Of the patients for whom antibiotic treatment information

52

was collected, 77% were on antibiotics, of which 80% were taking more than one antibiotic. The

53

number of days spent in the hospital ranged from 1 to 25, with a median stay of 9 days.

54

Each sample was screened for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 using three distinct

55

primer/probe sets: the U.S. Center for Disease Control N1 and N2 targets, and the World Health

56

Organization E-gene target (see methods). The US Food and Drug Administration has issued

57

Emergency Authorization for more than 150 RT-qPCR assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2,

58

the majority of which define a positive result as amplification in a single target (27). Accordingly,

59

we designated samples as positive if at least one out of three targets amplified with a Ct value

60

below 40. Serial dilutions of quantified virus amplicons were included in each RT-qPCR plate in

61

order to extrapolate the viral load of each sample. Of the surfaces sampled, 13.1% were positive

62

for SARS-CoV-2, including those touched primarily by health care workers (keyboard, ventilator

63

buttons, door handles inside, and outside the rooms) and those directly in contact with the patient

64

(toilet seats, bed rails). Of the patients enrolled in the study, we collected at least one positive

65

sample from 15/16 patients (nares, forehead, or stool) and from 14/15 associated hospital rooms.

66

In rooms where patient samples were not available, surfaces screened positive at least once for 6/6

67

COVID-19 rooms and 4/5 non-COVID-19 rooms.

68

Floor samples had the highest positivity rates (36% of samples collected from the floor

69

near the patients’ bed, i.e. “Inside Floor”, and 26% of samples collected from the floor immediately

70

outside of the patient room, i.e. “Outside Floor”) (Fig. 1B, Fig. S2). In some cases, SARS-CoV-2

71

was detected on the floors of rooms with patients who tested negative for COVID-19 and in rooms

72

that had been cleaned following COVID-19 patient occupancy (Fig. 1B, Fig. S3B). Most of the

73

positive surface samples amplified only one or two out of the three SARS-CoV-2 targets (Fig. 1C)

74

and had significantly lower viral load over time compared to patient nares and stool samples

75

(p<0.003, non-parametric test from sparse functional principal components analysis) (28), but

76

similar viral load to patient forehead samples (Fig. 1D).

77

SARS-CoV-2 viral load tended to decrease in patients over time (Fig. 1E) but was

78

detectable in patient nares up to 27 days after symptom onset. Trajectories of viral load varied for

79

different patients (Fig. S3). For a COVID-19-positive patient’s stay, viral load also tended to

80

decrease slightly on hospital surfaces including bed rails and floor samples but remained detectable

81

up to 16 days after patient admission (Fig. 1F).

82

Of 113 health care worker samples, only one stool sample amplified for one of the three

83

viral targets. No other samples collected from this health care worker, and no samples from any

84

other health care worker treating COVID-19 patients had any viral target amplification. Moreover,

85

all health care workers in this study did not have detectable serum antibodies against SARS-CoV-

Diverse microbial context of SARS-CoV-2

107

16S V4 rRNA gene amplicon (16S) sequencing was performed and a total of 589 out of

108

the 972 samples passed quality filtering (see methods). Most of the sample dropouts were low

109

biomass samples from surfaces in the built environment (49% of hospital surface samples

110

compared to 9% of human samples). Fewer samples that failed 16S sequencing were SARS-CoV-

111

2 positive (6.7%) compared to samples that sequenced successfully (23.9%). A meta-analysis with

112

samples from the Earth Microbiome Project (29), an intensive care unit microbiome project (30),

113

and a hospital surface microbiome study performed at another hospital (21) (a total of 19,947

114

samples) contextualized the microbial composition of samples from this hospital study and the

115

broad range of microbial diversity covered in this dataset (Fig. 2A). Through source-tracking (31)

116

on the meta-analysis we found that floor samples, which cluster separately from the rest of this

117

dataset (Fig. 2C), are similar to built environment samples from previous studies (Fig. S4).

118

Beta-diversity estimated using unweighted UniFrac distances (32) in this study showed

119

that floor samples, stool samples, and nares/forehead samples formed three distinct clusters with

120

other surfaces falling between the human skin and floor samples (Fig. 2B-C). SARS-CoV-2 viral

121

load was weakly correlated with unweighted UniFrac beta-diversity (PERMANOVA R2 <0.01, p-

122

value = 0.043, Fig. S5).

123

We compared beta-diversity between human samples and paired built environment

124

samples from the patients’ respective hospital rooms. Microbial composition of high touch

125

surfaces routinely used by healthcare workers, such as keyboards and floor samples, were

126

significantly more similar to health care worker samples, whereas samples from bed rails that are

127

not frequently touched by health care workers were significantly more similar to the patient

128

samples (Fig. 2D). Notably, the percent of SARS-CoV-2 positive bed rail samples was lower than

129

floor (11% vs 39%) despite the high similarity of bed rail microbiomes to the corresponding patient

130

microbiomes.

Longitudinal beta-diversity analysis reveals patient-surface microbial convergence

143

To account for the longitudinal nature of this dataset, we applied a compositional tensor

144

factorization method implemented through the Gemelli QIIME2 plugin (33, 34) (Fig. 3A).

145

Actinomycetales and Bacteroidales were the most highly ranked taxa driving the separation of

146

patient’s forehead and nares samples from surface samples, separating those two groups along the

147

first principal component axis (PC1). Bacillales was also ranked among the top contributors to

148

microbial separation in our dataset and has been successfully used for biocontrol on hospital

149

surfaces (35–38). The log-ratio of Bacillales versus Actinomycetales and Bacteroidales was higher

150

in surface samples compared to human samples (Fig. 3B). The trajectory of this log-ratio showed

151

that with longer hospitalizations, bed rail samples became more similar to patients' nares and

152

forehead samples. Upon patient discharge and room cleaning, this log-ratio converged back

153

towards floor samples.

The high alpha-diversity of floor samples and significant association with SARS-CoV-2

181

detection led us to examine potential differences in biomass across floor samples. Two

182

independent metrics were used to assess biomass; 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing read

183

count, which because of our equal volume sequencing library pooling approach correlates with

184

total bacterial load (39, 40), and the Ct value from the CDC’s human RNAse P RT-qPCR target,

185

which correlates with human biomass. 16S read count and human RNAse P Ct values are indirect

186

measures of total bacterial and human biomass, respectively, and were significantly correlated

187

(Pearson R2 = -0.40, p<0.0001). 16S read count was significantly higher in floor samples with

188

detected SARS-CoV-2, but did not correlate with the number of viral copies detected (Fig. 5B).

189

The abundance of human RNAse P was also significantly higher in floor samples with SARS-

190

CoV-2 (lower Ct values), and positively correlated with viral load (Pearson R2 = -0.31, p-value =

191

0.011) (Fig. 5C); this correlation was not observed for the other sample types examined (nares,

192

forehead, stool, bed rail). These results suggest that due to gravity SARS-CoV-2 is more likely to

193

be detected on floors with high load of total microbial and human biomass.

194

To determine if SARS-CoV-2 affected microbial composition in the built environment, we

195

performed forward stepwise redundancy analysis (41) on unweighted UniFrac (42) principal

196

components from floor samples (n=215). We chose floor samples for this analysis since floor

197

samples had the largest number and highest biomass of all surfaces sampled (Fig. S6). Three non-

198

redundant variables had a significant effect size, explaining a total of 21.7% variation in the data

199

(Fig. 5C). The variable with the strongest effect size was patient identity (17.5%, p-value =

200

0.0002), which aligns with previous work demonstrating that the built environment microbiome is

201

contributed from the humans inhabiting that space (21). Whether the sample was an inside floor

202

sample (next to patient bed) or outside floor sample (hallway directly in front of patient room) also

Unique microbial signatures predict SARS-CoV-2 across patient sample types

217

To identify microbial features associated with SARS-CoV-2 positive samples, we

218

independently trained Random Forest (RF) classifiers on nares (N=76), stool (N=44), and forehead

219

samples (n=79) from COVID-19 patients and health care workers. Based on 16S rRNA gene

220

amplicon sequencing microbial profiles, the RF models predicted SARS-CoV-2 status (positive

221

vs. not detected) with 0.89 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) in

222

unseen nares samples (Fig. 6A). Strikingly, skin (AUROC = 0.79) and stool (AUROC = 0.82) also

223

showed high classifier accuracy. As the SARS-CoV-2-negative samples were overrepresented in

224

the data, we also employed the area under the precision recall curves (AUPRC) to evaluate the

225

prediction performance of each classifier, which were 0.76, 0.72, and 0.7 for nares, stool and

226

forehead, respectively (Fig. 5B). A RF model built from bacterial profiles on the inside floor also

227

showed a moderate prediction accuracy for discriminating SARS-CoV-2 status (AUROC=0.71;

228

AUPRC=0.6, Fig. 5A and B). RF classifiers trained on outside floor and bed rail samples did not

229

perform well, especially in the precision recall curves (Fig. S7).

230

The phylogenetic relationship of the top 100 ranked amplicon sequence variants (ASV)

231

from the RF models were visualized with EMPress (43) (Fig. 5C). Stool and inside floor samples

232

each had distinct sets of taxa driving the RF model compared to nares and forehead samples, which

233

were more similar. Many of the highly ranked ASVs in the stool samples are from the class

234

Clostridiales, a polyphyletic group of obligate anaerobes that were also identified as predictive of

235

SARS-CoV-2 status in a wastewater study (2).

236

ASVs from the genera Actinomyces, Anaerococcus, Dialister, Gemella, and Schaalia were

237

in the top 40 ranked features of both forehead and nares samples (Data File S2); these taxa are

238

normally found in anterior nares samples (44–46), but are not commonly described in forehead

239

microbiome samples. Interestingly, from Figure 2C, we observed that the unweighted UniFrac

240

distance between samples from the same individual’s nares and forehead were more similar in

241

COVID-positive room surfaces, suggesting that patients who shed virus into their environment

242

could be cross-contaminating bacteria between nares and forehead (Fig. S8).

243

One ASV with an exact match to Rothia dentocariosa (GenBank ID CP054018.1) was

244

highly ranked across all four disparate sample types: nares, forehead, stool, and inside floor.

245

Further investigation shows this ASV is more prevalent in SARS-CoV-2 positive samples across

246

all sample types examined. To exclude the possibility of this Rothia ASV being associated with

247

sick patients generally, we examined the prevalence of this ASV in an intensive care unit

248

microbiome study that was performed in 2016 (30), and found that high Rothia prevalence is

249

specific to SARS-CoV-2 positive patient samples (Fig. 5D).

Discussion

266

The COVID-19 pandemic continues unabated as outbreaks ebb and flow around the globe.

267

Because evidence for the synergistic effects of host-associated bacteria on viral pathogen stability

268

and transmission continues to emerge, we set out to identify possible correlations between host-

269

or surface-associated bacteria with SARS-CoV-2 presence and abundance in the built

270

environment. At the onset of sampling, no hospital rooms or health care workers enrolled in the

271

study had known exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Despite patients continually testing positive and

272

shedding virus resulting in consistent surface contamination in the patient rooms, all samples

273

collected from health care workers providing direct patient care to patients with COVID-19 were

274

negative by both clinical RT-qPCR and antibody tests (data not shown). This includes the 3 health

275

care workers who collected samples for the study. Aside from one stool sample where one of three

276

viral targets amplified in our screening, all of the health care worker samples in this study (n=113)

277

were negative for SARS-CoV-2, similar to findings from previous studies of exposed health care

278

workers using airborne, contact and droplet protective PPE (47–49). This contrasts with early

279

reports of high SARS-CoV-2 transmission levels among health care workers before the

280

implementation of general hospital-wide masking of healthcare workers and patients and of eye

281

protection when interacting with an unmasked patient (50, 51). Our findings highlight the

282

importance of providing healthcare workers with appropriate PPE and with rigorous training in

283

donning and doffing procedures to minimize self-contamination. In this hospital, the infection

284

prevention measures (universal masking, eye protection, and appropriate PPE) were effective in

285

preventing transmissions.

286

In this study, approximately 16% (83/529) of surface samples from hospital rooms

287

occupied by COVID-19 patients and 6% (13/205) of surface samples from hospital rooms not

288

currently occupied by COVID-19 patients had detectable levels of SARS-CoV-2.

289

surprisingly, of the various surfaces sampled in this study, floor samples had the highest prevalence

290

of SARS-CoV-2 detection. The intense and frequent oropharyngeal, respiratory, skin, bowel care

291

provided to these critically ill patients is expected to produce shedding and contamination of the

292

environment in close proximity of the patient, including the floors. Our findings replicate previous

293

studies where floors had the highest prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 of all hospital room surfaces (52,

294

53). Previous studies of environmental contamination report higher surface prevalence of SARS-

295

CoV-2 in hospital settings, ranging from 25% to over 50% (52, 54–56). The lower SARS-CoV-2

296

prevalence rates in this study could be due to differences in sampling strategy (e.g. area sampled,

297

storage and extraction methods), more careful environmental cleaning of high touch areas around

298

the patient, or due to physiological differences since different surface types differentially influence

299

viral persistence (57). Furthermore, contamination of hospital room surfaces with SARS-CoV-2

300

tends to be highest during the first 5 days after symptom onset (Chia et al., 2020). All patients

301

enrolled in our study had symptoms for at least 6 days before admission to the hospital and

302

enrollment in this study.

Not

303

While SARS-CoV-2 was identified via RT-qPCR for both patient and hospital room

304

samples, it cannot be determined whether the detected virus was viable. Infectivity is both a

305

function of viral viability and abundance. One study assaying infectivity and RT-qPCR in parallel

306

showed that samples with Ct values >30 were not infectious (56). In our study, only 2 out of 79

307

positive surface samples amplified at least one SARS-CoV-2 target under 30 cycles, suggesting a

308

relative low viral abundance. Interestingly, both of these samples were from the floor directly next

309

to the patient bed in rooms that hosted patients who were mechanically ventilated during their stay.

310

One of these potentially infectious samples was collected after the patient was transferred to the

311

ICU and after room cleaning, and there were no other surface positives detected at that same time

312

point. The other low-Ct floor sample came from a room where the patient had a consistently high

313

viral load (Fig. S3B). However, the high Ct values for a majority of built environment samples in

314

this study, and the lack of health care worker infection, suggest that the positive surfaces identified

315

are an unlikely source of viral transmission in the hospital setting when contact precautions (gowns

316

and gloves) are used correctly.

317

It should be acknowledged that transportation of samples in ethanol (to ensure the safety

318

of those handling samples, as well as to enable microbiome analysis) instead of using viral

319

transport media may have resulted in overall lower viral RNA yield. Despite these potential

320

sources of variation, we found that bed rail and patient samples were highly similar in microbiomes

321

to one another before cleaning, but this similarity disappeared after cleaning. Microbial community

322

composition was also more similar between humans and the surfaces they touched (including

323

between health care workers and keyboards, as well as patients and bed rails), supporting the

324

robustness of our microbial sample collection and processing protocols.

325

It is both a strength and a limitation of this study that standard of care environmental

326

cleaning was performed and was not influenced or altered by the study team. The daily cleaning

327

regimen can vary depending on staff and other variables (hospital room surface types and

328

disinfection protocols are summarized in Table S1) which is representative of hospital

329

environmental practices worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 was amplified from floor samples, albeit at a

330

relatively low abundance based on Ct values, in rooms even without COVID-19 patients and after

331

cleaning. This highlights the importance of maintaining effective cleaning practices to mitigate the

332

risk of viral spread via fomites. Although transmission risk from the floor is likely negligible as

333

discussed above, the relatively high positivity rate for floor samples allowed us to use them as a

334

proxy to study how microbial communities are interrelated with shed virus.

335

In the built environment, microbial load, human biomass and alpha-diversity were higher

336

in floor samples positive for SARS-CoV-2. Floor samples also had the highest biomass of all the

337

surface samples tested, including high-touch surfaces (e.g. bedrail, keyboard, door handles). This

338

may help explain the higher prevalence of positive floor samples in COVID-19 patient rooms

339

(39%) versus bed rail samples (11%), despite their distance from the patient. This is in agreement

340

with previous research showing that bacterial- and viral load are positively correlated in built

341

environment samples (58). The relatively low prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 contamination on bed

342

rail samples may also be because many of the patients were deeply sedated and were not actively

343

moving in bed including touching the bedrails or because high touch areas in close proximity to

344

the patient are cleaned by nurses at each shift, and/or due to differences in material (vinyl versus

345

plastic).

346

Using Random Forest models to classify microbes associated with SARS-CoV-2 detection,

347

we found 16S microbial profiles had high predictive accuracy of SARS-CoV-2 presence in nares,

348

stool, forehead, and inside floor samples. Despite these sample types having distinct microbiomes

349

covering a broad range of microbial diversity (Fig. 2), we identified a single Rothia ASV that was

350

highly ranked in the Random Forest classifier across all four sample types. This ASV was also

351

more prevalent in SARS-CoV-2 positive samples across all human sample types and floor and bed

352

rail samples in our dataset. By comparing the prevalence of this ASV across our dataset and a 2016

353

study from an intensive care unit (30), we found that this signal is specific to SARS-CoV-2 positive

354

samples, and not other factors associated with an ICU admission such as antibiotic use. This

355

finding supports previous work reporting Rothia to be enriched in SARS-CoV-2 positive stool (59)

356

and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (60), and further suggests a role in nares, forehead, and surfaces.

357

While the mechanism remains unclear, the consistent Rothia ASV prevalence trend across

358

both patient and surface sample types suggest an association of this bacteria with SARS-COV-2.

359

Species from the genus Rothia are common to the human oral microbiome (61), but have also been

360

identified as opportunistic pathogens (62). Oral microbes have been found to colonize the

361

gastrointestinal tract, especially in disease states (63). This suggests a possible increased oral-fecal

362

transmission triggered under viral infection that manifests as a hallmark of COVID-19.

363

Interestingly, we also found that patients with cardiovascular disease comorbidities tended to have

364

higher prevalence of the Rothia ASV associated with SARS-CoV-2, compared to patients with

365

pre-existing cardiovascular disease (45% versus 26%, respectively). Rothia dentocariosa can

366

cause endocarditis, particularly in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease (62, 64). Using

367

data from the American Gut Project (65), we tested for the presence of this Rothia ASV in samples

368

from those self reporting a medical diagnosis of a cardiovascular disease, and those self reporting

369

not having a cardiovascular disease. We observed a significantly higher prevalence of Rothia in

370

samples with a medical reporting (Fisher’s exact test, p=0.041) than those without, suggesting that

371

Rothia may be associated with cardiovascular disease even outside of the context of SARS-CoV-

372

2. Cardiovascular disease can predispose individuals to worse outcomes with COVID-19, and

373

COVID-19 itself can cause cardiovascular problems (66). Further studies are required to determine

374

the mechanism underlying this association and how it may be translated into effective methods for

375

reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

376

This large-scale study is the first to examine the microbial context of SARS-CoV-2 in a

377

hospital setting. We detected viral contamination across a variety of surfaces in the ICU and the

378

general medical-surgical unit, including rooms that were not used to treat patients with COVID-

379

19 infection. Nonetheless, current hospital infection prevention measures including standard

380

environmental cleaning and the use of PPE were adequate in preventing hospital transmission of

381

SARS-CoV-2 to healthcare workers who directly provided care to patients with COVID-19

382

infection. Across a remarkable diversity of microbiomes (floor, nares, stool, skin), we identified a

383

single bacterial ASV, Rothia dentocariosa, that was highly predictive of and co-identified with

384

SARS-CoV-2. This association could be a result of direct interactions with the virus, or indirect

385

correlations through effects on the host, but both possibilities present exciting new avenues to

386

combat SARS-CoV-2 virulence. Our discovery of bacterial associations with SARS-CoV-2 both

387

in humans and the built environment demonstrates that bacteria-virus synergy likely plays a role

388

in the COVID-19 pandemic.

We followed the excretion pattern of the virus from the skin, respiratory tract, and

from the forehead, nares, and stool. Additional throat swabs and/or tracheal aspirate samples were

collected for a subset of patients and health care workers; ‘oral’ samples. Patient samples were

collected by gloved health care workers via dual-tipped synthetic swabs which were immediately

transferred to tubes containing 95% ethanol. Stool was collected from patient bed pans or from

408

collection bags that were connected to a rectal tube. Health care workers self-collected swabs over

409

a time series of 4 days. A chronological series was also employed for patient samples, with the

target sampling schemes as follows: samples collected within the first 12 hours of hospital

411

admission with sequential samples obtained once daily for the first 4 days of hospitalization and a

collection timing varied by patient availability and duration in the hospital (Fig. S3).

was present, the intake was swabbed. For a subset of samples, patient care equipment such as

423

portable ultrasound and ventilator screen were also swabbed, as well as the toilet seat. After sample

424

collection, dual-tipped swabs were returned to the swab container. Surface samples were collected

425

at the same time as patient sample collection, as well as prior to patient admission and following

426

patient discharge and room cleaning, when possible.

427

Nucleic acid extraction

428

Sample plating and extractions of all clinical and environmental specimens were carried

429

out in a biosafety cabinet Class II in a BSL2+ facility. Sample swabs were plated into a bead plate

430

from the 96 MagMAX™ Microbiome Ultra Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (A42357 Thermo Fisher

431

Scientific, USA). Following the KatharoSeq low biomass protocol (Minich 2018), each sample

432

processing plate included eight positive controls consisting of 10-fold serial dilutions of the

433

ZymoBIOMICS™ Microbial Community Standard (D6300 Zymo, USA) ranging from 5 to 50

434

million cells per extraction. Each plate also contained a minimum of 8 negative controls. Nucleic

435

acids purification was performed on the KingFisher FlexTM robots (Thermo Fisher Scientific,

436

USA) using the MagMAXTM Microbiome Ultra Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (Applied

437

BiosystemsTM), as instructed by the manufacturer. Briefly, 800 μL of lysis buffer was added to

438

each well on the sample processing plate, and briefly centrifuged to bring all beads to the bottom

439

of the plate. Sample swab heads were added to the lysis buffer and firmly sealed first with

440

MicroAmp™ clear adhesive film (Thermo Fisher Scientific, UK) using a seal roller, and the

441

sealing process repeated twice using foil seals. The plate was beaten in a TissueLyser II (Qiagen,

442

Germany) at 30 Hz for 2 minutes and subsequently centrifuged at 3700 x g for 5 minutes. Lysates

443

(450 μL/well) were transferred into a Deep Well Plate (96 well, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA)

444

containing 520 μL of MagMaxTM binding bead solution and transferred to the KingFisher FlexTM

446

nuclease free water and used for downstream SARS-CoV-2 real time RT-qPCR.

SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR and viral load quantification

448

The Center for Disease Control (CDC) 2019-Novel Coronavirus Real-Time RT-PCR

449

Diagnostic Panel (67) , and the E-gene primer/probe from the World Health Organization (68),

450

were used to assess SARS-CoV-2 status via reverse transcription, quantitative polymerase chain

451

reaction (RT-qPCR). Accordingly, each plate of extracted nucleic acid (96-well plate) was

452

aliquoted into a 384-well plate with four separate reactions per sample; two reactions targeted the

453

SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid gene (CDC N1 and N2), one reaction targeted the SARS-CoV-2

454

virporin forming E-gene (WHO E-gene), and one reaction targeted the human RNAse P gene as a

455

positive control for sample collection and nucleic acid extraction (CDC).

456

Each reaction contained 3 μL of TaqPathTM 1-Step RT-qPCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher

457

Scientific, USA), 400 nm forward and reverse primers and 200 nm FAM-probes (IDT, USA - table

458

with sequences below), 4 µL RNA template, and H2O to a final volume of 10 µL. Master mix and

459

sample plating were performed using an EpMotion automated liquid handler (Eppendorf,

460

Germany). Each plate contained both positive and negative controls. The positive control was

461

vRNA and eight serial dilutions of viral amplicons for viral load quantification (details below).

462

Six extraction blanks and one RT-qPCR blank (nuclease-free H2O) were included per plate as

463

negative controls. RT-qPCR was performed on the CFX384 Real-Time System (BIO-RAD).

464

Cycling conditions were reverse transcription at 50°C for 15 minutes, enzyme activation at 95°C

465

for 2 minutes, followed by 45 cycles of PCR amplification (Denaturing at 95°C for 10 s;

466

Annealing/Extending at 55°C for 30 s). Cycle threshold (Ct) values were generated using the

467

CFX384 Real-Time System (BIO-RAD) software.

468

Viral load quantification was performed using a standard ladder comprising serially diluted

469

target amplicons. SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using the

470

Superscript IV enzyme (Thermo Fisher, USA) and PCR amplified with KAPA SYBR® FAST

471

qPCR Master Mix (KAPA Biosystems, USA) using the N1, N2, and E gene primers in duplicate

472

20 µL reactions with cycling parameters as detailed above. Each amplicon reaction was run across

473

a 1.5% agarose gel and the resulting bands were excised and purified into 100 µl nuclease-free

474

water with the MinElute Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Germany). Amplicons were quantified with

475

in duplicate with the Qubit™ dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher, USA) and copies per µL were

476

calculated based on predicted amplicon length (N1 72 bp, N2 67 bp, and E gene 113 bp). Eight,

477

10-fold serial dilutions were added to the RT-qPCR for final estimated copy input per reaction of

478

10 million to one. Viral load per swab head was calculated by first using the slope and intercept

479

from the N1 amplicon ladder linear regression per plate to determine the number of viral copies

480

per reaction, and then multiplying this number by 25 since 4 µL out of a total 100 µL extracted

16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing

485

16S rRNA gene amplification was performed according to the Earth Microbiome Project

486

protocol (Thompson et al., 2017). Briefly, Illumina primers with unique reverse primer barcodes

487

(Caporaso et al., 2012) were used to amplify the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene (515f-806rB,

488

Walters et al., 2016). Amplification was performed in a miniaturized volume (69), with single

489

reactions per sample (70). Equal volumes of each amplicon were pooled, and the library was

490

sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq sequencing platform with a MiSeq Reagent Kit v2 and paired-

491

end 150 bp cycles. Raw data is available through EBI under accession ERP124721 and associated

492

feature tables are publicly available in Qiita (qiita.ucsd.edu) (Gonzalez et al., 2018) under study

493

ID 13092.

Statistical Analysis

496

Data pre-processing

497

Raw 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing data was demultiplexed, quality filtered, and

498

denoised with deblur (71) through Qiita (72) under study ID 13092. Downstream data processing

499

was performed using Qiime2 (33). The serially diluted mock communities included in each

500

extraction plate (see Nucleic Acid Extraction section) were used to identify the read count threshold

501

at which 80% of sequencing reads aligned to the positive control according to the KatharoSeq

502

protocol (40) (code available at https://github.com/lisa55asil/KatharoSeq_ipynb), and all samples

503

falling below the threshold set for each independent sequencing run were removed from

504

downstream analysis. The KatharoSeq-filtered feature tables were merged, and features present in

505

less than three samples were removed from downstream analysis, with the final feature table

506

containing 589 samples and 9461 features.

507
508

Beta-diversity analyses

509

To verify that study samples of particular types clustered with similar types from other

510

microbial studies, we estimated the UniFrac phylogenetic distance between samples and visualized

511

the distance of variation of our current project in reference to samples from the Earth Microbiome

512

Project. For significance testing based on distances from sequencing data, a permutation test was

513

used. This was chosen since univariate statistical tests often assume that observations are

514

independently and identically distributed, which is not the case with distance calculations. Similar

515

to PERMANOVA, the group labels were shuffled, and a Kruskal-Wallis test was applied. P-values

516

were calculated by (#(K > Kp) + 1) / (number of permutations + 1) where K is the kruskal-wallis

statistic on the original statistic and Kp is the Kruskal-Wallis statistic computed from the permuted

518

grouping. 1000 permutations were used for the permutation test.

519
520

Longitudinal data analysis

521

To detect microbial changes over time without being limited by interindividual variation,

522

we used a dimensionality reduction tool, compositional tensor factorization (CTF) (34). This tool

523

incorporates microbiome information from an individual host or sample source, which has been

524

sampled across multiple time-points and reveals the net differences in microbial beta-diversity

525

across sample types or patient profiles. We used Bayesian Sparse Functional Principal

526

Components Analysis (SFPCA) (73) methodology to model temporal variations and sample type

527

differences in viral load.

528
529

To quantify the contribution of potential source environments (i.e. patient microbiome) to
the hospital surface microbiome (as a sink), SourceTracker2 (31) was used.

530
531

Random Forest Analysis

532

We performed machine learning analysis of bacterial profiles derived from 16S rRNA gene

533

amplicon sequencing from multiple sample types (nares, skin, stool, inside floor, outside floor,

534

and bed rail) to predict the samples’ SARS-CoV-2 status according to RT-qPCR (i.e., “positive”

535

or ”not detected”). For each sample type, a Random Forest sample classifier was trained based on

536

the ASV-level bacterial profiles with tuned hyperparameters as 20-time repeated, stratified 5-fold

537

cross-validation using the R caret package (74). The dataset of each sample type was repeatedly

538

split into five groups with similar class distributions, and we trained the classifier on 80% of the

539

data, and made predictions on the remaining 20% of the data in each fold iteration. We evaluated

540

each classifier using both area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and area

541

under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) based on the samples’ predictions in the holdout test

542

set using the R PRROC package (75). For all four sample types, our data had an imbalanced

543

representation of SARS-CoV-2 status, and “not detected” was consistently the majority class

544

(nares: 45 not detected vs. 31 positives; forehead skin: 63 not detected vs. 16 positives; stool: 33

545

not detected vs. 11 positives; inside floor: 67 not detected vs. 40 positive; inside floor: 81 not

546

detected vs. 27 positives; bed rail: 38 not detected vs. 8 positives). To assess how well a classifier

547

can predict the SARS-CoV-2 positive samples (the minority class) using microbiome data, the

548

AUPRC was calculated by assigning “positive” as the positive class. Next, the importance of each

549

ASV for the prediction performance of the four classifiers (for nares, forehead skin, stool, and

550

inside floor) was estimated by the built-in Random Forest scores in the 100-fold cross-validation.

551

For each body site or environmental site, we finally ranked all ASVs by their average ranking of

552

importance scores in the 100 classification models. The code for generating the multi-dataset

553

machine learning analysis is available at https://github.com/shihuang047/crossRanger and is based

554

on Random Forest implementation from R ranger package (76).

555

To identify the ASVs consistently important to the prediction of SARS-CoV-2 across the

556

four different sample types, we visualized the top 100 ranked important ASV’s and their

557

phylogenetic relationship for each sample type using EMPress (43).

558
559

Redundancy Analysis

560

To quantify the effect size of different metadata variables on our 16S rRNA gene amplicon

561

sequencing dataset, we applied redundancy analysis on the robust Aitchison principal coordinates

562

analysis biplot (77) as described previously (41). Briefly, RDA employs the varpart function in R
