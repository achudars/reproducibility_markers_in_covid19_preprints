Short title: COVID-19 on maternal and neonatal outcomes

Contribution:
What are the novel findings of this work?
Amongst a few cases from the case-series that had qRT-PCR testing in vaginal mucus
and breast milks, the results were negative for SARS-CoV-2. Similarly, some of the
cases from the case-series had qRT-PCR testing in amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal
throat swab and neonatal feces, and the results were negative for SARS-CoV-2.
Amongst the case-reports, there were two maternal deaths and two neonates tested
positive for SARS-CoV-2 at 16 / 24 hours of life.
What are the clinical implications of this work?
The subject of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 remains controversial and more
data is needed to investigate this possibility. In order to collect meaningful pregnancy
and perinatal outcome data, we urge researchers and investigators to reference
previously published cases in their publications and to record such reporting when the
data of a case is being entered into a registry or several registries.

ABSTRACT

Objective
To perform a systematic review of available published literature on pregnancies affected
by COVID-19 to evaluate the effects of COVID-19 on maternal, perinatal and neonatal
outcomes.

Methods
We performed a systematic review to evaluate the effects of COVID-19 on pregnancy,
perinatal and neonatal outcomes. We conducted a comprehensive literature search
using PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure
Database and Wan Fang Data until April 20, 2020 (studies were identified through
PubMed alert after April 20, 2020). For the research strategy, combinations of the
following keywords and MeSH terms were used: SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, coronavirus
disease 2019, pregnancy, gestation, maternal, mothers, vertical transmission,
maternal-fetal transmission, intrauterine transmission, neonates, infant, delivery.
Eligibility criteria included laboratory-confirmed and/or clinically diagnosed COVID-19,
patient was pregnant on admission, availability of clinical characteristics, including
maternal, perinatal or neonatal outcomes. Exclusion criteria were unpublished reports,
unspecified date and location of the study or suspicion of duplicate reporting, and
unreported maternal or perinatal outcomes. No language restrictions were applied.

Results
We identified several case-reports and case-series but only 19 studies, including a total
of 266 pregnant women with COVID-19, met eligibility criteria and were finally included
in the review. In the combined data from seven case-series, the maternal age ranged
from 20 to 41 years and the gestational age on admission ranged from 5 to 41 weeks.
The most common symptoms at presentation were fever, cough, dyspnea/shortness of
breath and fatigue. The rate of severe pneumonia was relatively low, with the majority of
the cases requiring intensive care unit admission. Almost all cases from the case-series
had positive computer tomography chest findings. There were six and 22 cases that had

nucleic-acid testing in vaginal mucus and breast milk samples, respectively, which were
negative for SARS-CoV-2. Only a few cases had spontaneous miscarriage or abortion.
177 cases had delivered, of which the majority by Cesarean section. The gestational
age at delivery ranged from 28 to 41 weeks. Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes ranged
from 7 to 10 and 8 to 10, respectively. A few neonates had birthweight less than 2500
grams and over one-third of cases were transferred to neonatal intensive care unit.
There was one case each of neonatal asphyxia and neonatal death. There were 113
neonates that had nucleic-acid testing in throat swab, which was negative for
SARS-CoV-2. From the case-reports, two maternal deaths among pregnant women
with COVID-19 were reported.

Conclusions
The clinical characteristics of pregnant women with COVID-19 are similar to those of
nonpregnant adults with COVID-19. Currently, there is no evidence that pregnant
women with COVID-19 are more prone to develop severe pneumonia, in comparison to
nonpregnant patients. The subject of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 remains
controversial and more data is needed to investigate this possibility. Most importantly, in
order to collect meaningful pregnancy and perinatal outcome data, we urge researchers
and investigators to reference previously published cases in their publications and to
record such reporting when the data of a case is being entered into a registry or several
registries.

INTRODUCTION

With over three million individuals infected,1 the global pandemic caused by the severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) is a global public health crisis.2,3 Most cohort studies have focused on
evaluating the effects of COVID-19 on the general population,2-4 and there is insufficient
data on vulnerable populations, such as pregnant women.

It is recognized that pregnant women are at an increased risk of acquiring viral
respiratory infection and developing severe pneumonia due to the physiologic changes
in the immune and cardiopulmonary systems.5,6 Lessons learned from the two notable
coronavirus outbreaks, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)
and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), suggest that
pregnant women are particularly susceptible to adverse outcomes, including the need
for endotracheal intubation, admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), renal failure and
death.7-9 The first study describing the clinical characteristics and investigating the
possibility of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in nine pregnant women with
laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, demonstrated that the impact of COVID-19 on
pregnant women was similar to that of non-pregnant adults and that there was no
evidence of vertical transmission as SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in amniotic fluid,
cord blood and neonatal throat swab of six cases.10 To date, the largest series reporting
on both pregnancy and neonatal outcomes, with a total of 99 COVID-19-infected
pregnant women, demonstrated that COVID-19 during pregnancy was not associated
with an increased risk of adverse outcomes such as spontaneous preterm birth.
Amongst the 100 neonates born to these women, none was infected with
SARS-CoV-2.11 Based on very scarce data to-date, conflicting evidence from nuclei
acid-based testing and antibodies testing in neonates born to mothers with COVID-19
has raised further controversy in relation to the risk of vertical transmission during
pregnancy.12,13

The objective of this study was to perform a systematic review of available published

literature on pregnancies affected by COVID-19 to evaluate the effects of COVID-19 on
maternal, perinatal and neonatal outcomes.

METHODS

Search strategy:
We conducted a comprehensive literature search using PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane
library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database and Wan Fang Data until
April 20, 2020 (Studies were identified through Pubmed alert after April 20, 2020). For
the search strategy, combinations of the following keywords and MeSH terms were
used: SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019, pregnancy, gestation,
maternal, mothers, vertical transmission, maternal-fetal transmission, intrauterine
transmission, neonates, infant. The search strategy is provided in Appendix 1. Eligibility
criteria included laboratory-confirmed and/or clinically diagnosed COVID-19, patient
pregnant on admission, availability of clinical characteristics, including at least one of
maternal, perinatal or neonatal outcomes. Exclusion criteria were unpublished reports,
unspecified date and location of the study or suspicion of duplicate reporting, and
unreported maternal or perinatal outcomes. No language restrictions were applied.

Selection of the articles:
Titles were selected from first screening and abstracts of citations were reviewed by two
reviewers independently (J.J. and M.M.G.) to identify all potentially relevant articles. We
identified several case-reports and case-series. After the first screening of titles and
abstracts, we decided to repeat the screening procedure and exclude case-reports or
case-series that include less than 10 cases from China in order to avoid duplication of
cases as there have since been several cohort series published. The potentially
relevant articles were fully evaluated by the same reviewers. Reference lists of relevant
original and review articles were searched for additional reports. Full-text articles were
retrieved for further consideration for inclusion. Disagreements were resolved by the
opinion of a third party (L.C.P.), who also independently reviewed the final included
articles to confirm they met the inclusion criteria. The review was registered in

PROSPERO on 23 April 2020,14 prior to data extraction (registration number
CRD42016032409).

Data extraction, quality assessment and outcome measures:
Two authors (J.J. and M.M.G.) extracted the information (population, outcome, study
design and results) from the selected studies. A modification of the Cochrane Public
Health Group Data Extraction and Assessment Template,15 which was previously
piloted by the researchers, was used to tabulate findings of the included articles. Finally,
they independently assessed methodological quality of the studies using the Joanna
Briggs Institute (JBI) tool for case-series and case-reports.16 Publication bias was
considered high since all the included studies were either case-series or case-control in
design. The quality of this review was validated with the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) tool.17

The following information was extracted from the articles: author names, institution and
country, study design, sample size, maternal age, gestational age on admission,
symptoms on admission, pregnancy complications, gestational age at delivery, mode of
delivery, disease severity, laboratory and radiological findings, maternal and neonatal
outcomes, samples collection (amniotic fluid, cord blood, placenta, vaginal secretion,
urine, feces, breast milk, neonatal pharyngeal swab, neonatal blood, neonatal urine,
neonatal feces, neonatal gastric juice). Any evidence of maternal to fetal transmission of
SARS-CoV-2 was also recorded. We contacted the authors directly when further
clarification on their data was needed, such as overlapping cases in different studies
published by the same group or to complete outcome data. Details on correspondence
are provided in Supplementary Table 1.

Statistical analyses:
Due to the lack of studies with designs that allow for meta-analysis, we opted to perform
a narrative synthesis using the Synthesis Without Meta-analysis (SWiM) reporting
guideline (intended to complement the PRISMA guidelines in these cases).18 Summary
statistics (numbers and ranges) were calculated to show sample distribution, where

appropriate.

RESULTS

Figure 1 summarizes the selection of articles for review. Initial database searches
identified 536 records which, after exclusion of duplicates, were screened for the
eligibility criteria and included in the current systematic review. Finally, 19 studies,
including a total of 266 pregnant women with COVID-19, met the eligibility criteria and
were included in the review. There were seven case-series, including 253 pregnant
patients, published from March 4, 2020 to April 24, 2020 (Tables 1-6). There were 12
case-reports, including 13 pregnant patients, published from March 25, 2020 to April 18,
2020 (Tables 1-6). From the case-series, all seven studies reported all cases diagnosed
during the study period. We recorded data related to maternal and perinatal
characteristics, the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 at admission including
laboratory testing, treatment received and maternal, perinatal and neonatal outcomes.
The majority of the studies originated from China, but cases from Australia, Canada,
France, Korea, Iran, Peru, Spain, Sweden, Turkey and United States were also included.
We differentiated cases that were laboratory-confirmed from those that were clinically
diagnosed but data from the two types of diagnosis were combined for presentation. A
laboratory-confirmed case of COVID-19 was defined as a positive result on quantitative
reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction

pharyngeal swab specimens. It is important to note that at the peak of the COVID-19
outbreak within Hubei province, China, cases with relevant symptoms, significant
epidemiological history and typical chest computer tomography (CT) findings were
clinically diagnosed as COVID-19, as the viral nucleic acid test was reported to have a
false-negative rate of 30%.19

Reasons for exclusion are provided in Supplementary Table 2. Quality assessment of
the included studies is reported in Supplementary Tables 3 and 4.

In the combined data from consecutive case-series, the maternal age ranged from 20 to
41 years and the gestational age on admission ranged from 5 to 41 weeks. Two-thirds
of the data derived from laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases. The most common
symptoms at presentation were fever, cough, dyspnea/shortness of breath and fatigue.
Based on the case-series by Yan et al and Breslin et al, up to one-third of
COVID-19-infected pregnant patients were asymptomatic on admission.11,20 The rate of
severe pneumonia was relatively low, with the majority of the cases requiring ICU
admission, of which only a few cases received invasive mechanical ventilation. The
majority of cases received antibiotic therapy, whilst the minority of cases received
antiviral therapy and corticosteroids. Few cases received hydroxychloroquine. There
were no cases of maternal death from the case-series.

Almost all cases from the case-series had positive CT chest findings. On admission, the
majority of cases had normal or low leucocytes, whilst half had lymphocytopenia and
increased C-reactive protein (CRP). Of note, there were six and 22 cases that had
nucleic-acid testing in vaginal mucus and breast milk samples, respectively, which were
negative for SARS-CoV-2.

From the case-reports, two maternal deaths among pregnant women with COVID-19
were reported by Karami et al. and Zamaniyan et al. from Iran.21,22 The first case was a
27-year-old 30 weeks pregnant woman who complained of fever, cough, and myalgia
for 3 days. Her admission laboratory tests showed leukopenia and thrombocytopenia,
accompanied with elevated CRP and lactate dehydrogenase levels [R]. Soon after
admission, her temperature was noted at 40°C and her respiratory rate was 55 per
minute, accompanied by suprasternal and intercostal retraction. Immediate blood tests
showed metabolic alkalosis while the patient was under non-invasive ventilation. She
was eventually intubated for mechanical ventilation due to worsening acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS) based on clinical and radiological findings. On day 2 of
admission, the patient had spontaneous onset of labor and delivered a cyanotic
neonate vaginally with no signs of life that did not respond to neonatal cardiopulmonary
resuscitation. One day after birth, the mother developed multi-organ failure (ARDS,

acute kidney injury, and septic shock) and died.21 The second case was a 22-year-old
32 weeks pregnant woman with dyspnea, myalgia, anorexia, nausea, non-productive
cough and fever for 4 days. On admission, she was treated with Azithromycin,
Ceftriaxone, Kaletra, Tamiflu and hydroxychloroquine. Based on the CT chest findings,
lymphopenia, worsening pneumonia symptoms, and an unfavorable cervix for induction,
a Cesarean delivery was indicated to terminate the pregnancy at 33 weeks’ gestation. A
preterm female infant, weighing 2350 grams, was delivered uneventfully; with Apgar
scores of 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The amniotic fluid tested positive for
SARS-CoV-2 by qRT-PCR. The immediate post-delivery nasal and throat swabs of the
newborn tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, however, repeat testing 24 hours later
became positive. Such results raised the possibility of vertical transmission. The mother
underwent peritoneal dialysis due to ARDS on day 4 and 6 postpartum, and required
intubation and mechanical ventilation due to sudden oxygen desaturation to 70% on
day 10 postpartum. She developed emphysema after intubation that resolved
spontaneously on day 12 postpartum, however, her condition deteriorated dramatically
and she died on day 15 postpartum.22

Pregnancy and Neonatal Outcomes
From the case-series, the rates of gestational diabetes, hypertensive disorders of
pregnancy and preeclampsia did not appear to be higher than in pregnant women
without COVID-19. There were only a few cases with hypothyroidism and placenta
previa/acreta. Nearly one-third of the cases (72/253) were not delivered at the time of
reporting. A few cases had spontaneous miscarriage or abortion. In the remaining 177
cases, including two with twin pregnancy, the majority had a Cesarean delivery. The
gestational age at delivery ranged from 28 to 41 weeks. The Apgar scores at 1 and 5
minutes ranged from 7 to 10 and 8 to 10, respectively. A few neonates had birthweight
less than 2500 grams and over one-third of cases were transferred to neonatal intensive
care unit (NICU). There was one case each of neonatal asphyxia and neonatal death.
For the neonates, a few cases had increased white blood cells and CRP. No cases had
lymphocytopenia and thrombocytopenia. Of note, there were 29, 29, 113, 19, 19 and 19
cases that had nucleic-acid testing in amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab,

neonatal feces, neonatal urine and neonatal gastric juice samples, respectively, which
were negative for SARS-CoV-2.

There was a case-report demonstrating that the neonate throat swab tested positive for
SARS-CoV-2.23 The mother was a 41-year-old woman with pre-existing diabetes
mellitus and significant COVID-19 exposure from immediate family members. She
presented at 33 weeks’ gestation with a 4-day history of malaise, fatigue, low-grade
fever, and progressive shortness of breath. The nasopharyngeal swab of the patient
was positive for SARS-CoV-2. The patient developed severe respiratory failure
requiring mechanical ventilation on day 5 of disease onset. She was started on
azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, meropenem, vancomycin, and oseltamivir. The
patient underwent a preterm Cesarean delivery due to compromised respiratory status.
Neonatal isolation was implemented immediately after birth, without delayed cord
clamping or skin-to-skin contact. The neonate weighed 2970 grams, with Apgar’s
scores of 6 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The neonate was not exposed to
family members. Breastfeeding was not initiated. The neonate was placed in the NICU
with no other COVID-19 cases, as this was the first pediatric case at the institution.
Chest X-ray showed no abnormalities. At 16 hours after delivery, the neonatal
nasopharyngeal swab tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR, which was repeated
48 hours later that remained positive. However, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG were
negative at birth. The possibility of postpartum neonatal infection cannot be completely
excluded because of the delay in testing. The newborn required ventilatory support for
12 hours, after which he was extubated and placed on continuous positive airway
pressure, with favorable outcome.

DISCUSSION

This systematic review has demonstrated that, first, the clinical characteristics of these
patients with COVID-19 pneumonia during pregnancy are similar to those of
nonpregnant adults with COVID-19;24,25 second, the most common symptoms reported

are fever, cough, dyspnea/shortness of breath and fatigue; third, on admission, most
cases have patchy shadowing or ground-glass opacity on CT of the chest, and that
normal or low leukocyte, lymphocytopenia and raised CRP are the most common
laboratory findings observed in COVID-19-infected pregnant patients; fourth, the rate of
severe COVID-19 pneumonia is relatively low but there are two reported maternal
deaths, as of April 23, 2020; fifth, COVID-19 does not appear to increase the risk of
adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preeclampsia; sixth, only a few pregnancies have
resulted in a spontaneous miscarriage or abortion; seventh, of those who have delivered,
the gestational age at delivery ranged from 28 to 41 weeks and the majority of cases
have had Cesarean delivery; and eighth, in the case-series there have been no reported
cases of neonates tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, however, in the case-reports there
has been one case each with positive SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid and neonatal throat
swab.

At present, there is much controversy relating to the possibility of vertical
mother-to-baby transmission of SARS-CoV-2. In the two earlier studies, with a
combined total of ten pregnant women with COVID-19 in the third trimester, amniotic
fluid, cord blood and neonatal throat-swab samples tested negative for SARS-CoV-2,
suggesting there was no evidence of vertical transmission in women who developed
COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy.10,26 In another series, a neonate born to a
pregnant woman with COVID-19 that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the pharyngeal
swab sample 36 hours after birth, it was subsequently confirmed that qRT-PCR testing
of the placenta and cord blood was negative for SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that
intrauterine vertical transmission might not have occurred.27,28

Two research letters12,13 have suggested the possibility of vertical transmission of
SARS-CoV-2 based on the presence of IgM antibodies in blood drawn from three
neonates born to COVID-19-infected mothers. However, for all three, the respiratory
samples tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, one neonate had repeated
testing for SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies, and the observed rapid decline of IgG
levels within 14 days, along with a decline in IgM antibodies, strongly suggested that

neonatal SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were derived transplacentally from the mother,
and not actively induced by the presumed neonatal infection.

The findings of the case of maternal death reported by Zamaniyan et al,22 where
amniotic fluid and neonatal nasal and throat swabs tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and
the case-report by Alzamora et al,23 where neonatal throat swab tested positive for
SARS-CoV-2, have again raised the possibility of vertical transmission. The authors of
the former case-report could not measure specific antibodies in the neonate, which
might have provided supplementary evidence for vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
This case is of particular interest because the pregnant patient might have had virulent
COVID-19, which was not immediately apparent prior to delivery as her clinical course
only dramatically deteriorated after delivery. There appear at least two ways through
which SARS-CoV-2 can cause intrauterine infection by vertical transmission.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which has recently been indicated as the
putative surface receptor of sensitive cells for SARS-CoV-2,29 has been shown to be
expressed in human placentas.30 This opens up the possibility for SARS-CoV-2 to
spread transplacentally through ACE2. Specifically, the viral surface spike glycoprotein
(S protein) of SARS-CoV-2 is cleaved by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2)
to facilitate efficiency of entry and viral replication, there is emerging evidence that
SARS-CoV-2 co-opts and recruits additional host proteases for transmissibility.31,32 It is
however unknown whether there is placental expression of host proteases (such as
TMPRSS2 and others) necessary for cleavage of the S protein and receptor priming.
On the other hand, placental barrier damage caused by severe maternal hypoxemia in
women with COVID-19 infection could also be one potential way through which
SARS-CoV-2 can cause intrauterine infection. There is an urgent need to further
investigate the possibility of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 [R,R].

The second case of maternal death that was reported by Karami et al underwent autopsy
and histopathologic evaluation of paraffin embedded lung tissue that showed alveolar
spaces with focal hyaline membrane, pneumocyte proliferation, and metaplastic
changes.21 There was evidence of viral pneumonia (viral cytopathic effect including

multinucleation and nuclear atypia and a mild increase in alveolar wall thickness). These
findings are comparable to what have been observed in nonpregnant cases.33 A recent
case-series reported on maternal death of seven pregnant women presenting with
severe COVID-19 during the latter second and third trimester over a 30-day interval in
Iran.34 All cases received a three-drug regimen, which included oseltamivir 75 mg PO
every 12 hours for 5 days, hydroxychloroquine sulfate 400 mg PO daily or chloroquine
sulfate 1000 mg tablet PO as a single dose and lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg PO every
12 hours for 5 days. There were two key distinguishing features from these cases. First,
the average maternal age of this series (36.7 + 7.3 years versus 30.3 + 3.6 years) was
higher than others. Second, none of the pregnant patients had pre-existing
co-morbidities, such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease and asthma.34 The
authors believed that the COVID-19-infected pregnant patients did not receive
suboptimal care and raised concern regarding the potential for maternal death among
pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 in the latter trimester. Notably, the authors
did not provide details of cause(s) of death.34

This systematic review had several strengths. We undertook a meticulous process in
identifying duplicate reporting: (i) case reports from China were excluded, (ii) when a
hospital had published their cases more than once, only the paper with the biggest data
or published on the later date was included, (iii) we were able to identify the duplicates
from our own publication,11 which is the biggest cohort series with available pregnancy
outcome data from China and (iv) when necessary we contacted the corresponding
authors using their native language, i.e. Chinese and Spanish, thus increasing the
chance of receiving a response from them. We did not apply any language restrictions
in order to capture a global picture of the impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy and
perinatal outcomes and most importantly we had the capability to ensure that data from
China could be accurately interpreted and recorded. There were several major
limitations. We were unable to include the second biggest cohort series with available
pregnancy outcome data from China because the data were pooled from a national
registry.35 Despite contacting the corresponding author directly, it was not possible to
identify the actual sources of cases. All 68 pregnant patients with pregnancy outcome

data were cases from Wuhan, and the authors did not make reference to previously
published cases. In our publication we included 77 cases from Wuhan and we had
strong reasons to believe that there was significant overlap between the two series, and
therefore we regrettably had to exclude the data from Chen et al in order to avoid
inflating the number of COVID-19-infected pregnant cases in China. We also learned
that COVID-19-infected pregnant cases could have been transferred to other hospitals,
which made it difficult to determine duplicate reporting as cases could have been
reported by both the admitting and receiving hospitals. We decided to combine
laboratory-confirmed and clinically diagnosed COVID-19 cases in our analysis because
both groups had similar outcomes.11 We believed it was important to include the
clinically diagnosed cases in this review as clinically diagnosed cases had typical
COVID-19 chest CT findings and significant epidemiological exposure. Only two cases
of maternal death had been reported, as of April 23, 2020, in the literature. Traditionally
any maternal death requires an extensive process of investigation and therefore it is not
immediately reported and made public. It is highly probable that COVID-19-related
maternal case fatality rate is higher but such data will only come to light at the end of the
pandemic.

In conclusion, the clinical characteristics of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia
are similar to those of nonpregnant adults with COVID-19 pneumonia. Currently, there is
no evidence that pregnant women with COVID-19 are more prone to develop severe
pneumonia, in comparison to nonpregnant patients. The subject of vertical transmission
of SARS-CoV-2 remains controversial and more data is needed to investigate this
possibility. Lastly, in order to collect meaningful pregnancy and perinatal outcome data,
we urge researchers and investigators to reference previously published cases in their
publications and to record such reporting when the data of a case is being entered into
a registry or several registries.
