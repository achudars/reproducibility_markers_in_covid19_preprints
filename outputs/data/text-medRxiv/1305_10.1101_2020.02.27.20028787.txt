Abstract
BACKGROUND: In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)–infected
pneumonia (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, China. Travel-associated cases have also
been reported in other countries. The number of cases has increased rapidly but
laboratory diagnosis is limited.
METHODS: We collect two groups of cases diagnosed with COVID-19 for
experiments. One group collected 63 samples for Enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) IgG and IgM antibodies. The other group collected 91 plasma samples
for colloidal gold-immunochromatographic assay (GICA).
RESULTS: The sensitivity of the combined ELISA IgM and ELISA IgG detection
was 55/63 ( 87.3%), The sensitivity of the combined GICA IgM and GICA IgG
detection was 75/91 ( 82.4%), Both methods are negative for healthy controls,
specificity of 100% .There is no significant difference between the sensitivity of
between ELISA and GICA (IgM+ IgG).
CONCLUSIONS: ELISA and GICA for specific IgM and IgG antibodies are
conventional serological assays, they are simple, fast, and safe, the results can be used
for clinical reference, and the huge clinical diagnosis and treatment pressure can be
greatly relieved.
Background
In December 2019, a cluster of acute respiratory illness, now known as novel

coronavirus–infected pneumonia (NCIP), occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China
.The disease has rapidly spread from Wuhan to other areas. By February 27, 2020,

(1-3)

there were 78630 confirmed cases reported in China, and tragically we have now
surpassed 2747 people in China have lost their lives because of this virus. Most of the
cases and most of the deaths are in Hubei province, Wuhan. Outside China, there are
3545 cases in 40 countries, and 35 death. The type of pneumonia caused by the 2019

novel coronavirus is a highly infectious disease, and the ongoing outbreak has been
declared by WHO as a global public health emergency.
A novel coronavirus of zoonotic origin (2019-nCoV) has recently been
identified in patients with acute respiratory disease. This virus is genetically similar to
SARS coronavirus and bat SARS-like coronaviruses. Outbreaks in health care
workers indicate human-to-human transmission. Full-genome sequencing and
phylogenic analysis indicated that 2019-nCoV is a distinct clade from the beta
coronaviruses associated with human severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and
Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)(1). International Committee on
Taxonomy of Viruses（ICTV）is announced that 2019-nCoV is officially classified as
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)(4,5).The World
Health Organization (WHO) announced that the official name of the disease caused
by this virus is Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19)(6).

Huang et al first reported 41 cases of NCIP in which most patients had a history of
exposure to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. Patients’ clinical manifestations
included fever, nonproductive cough, dyspnea, myalgia, fatigue, normal or decreased
leukocyte counts, and radiographic evidence of pneumonia. Organ dysfunction (eg,
shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute cardiac injury, and acute
kidney injury and death can occur in severe cases(2). Although most patients present
with mild febrile illness with patchy pulmonary inflammation, a significant portion
develop severe ARDS, with a current case fatality of 4.3%(3).

Diagnosis is based on clinical history and laboratory and chest radiographic
findings, but confirmation currently relies on nucleic acid-based assays. The nucleic
acid-based assay has been used to confirm the diagnosis of new pneumonia, but many
patients will miss the diagnosis. We have verified the two new reagents kit that are

currently not on the market and have achieved good results. The following are
reported as follows:

Materials and Methods
Study Design and Participants
This case series was approved by the institutional ethics board of Wuhan Jinyintan
Hospital. All consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to Jinyintan
Hospital from January 1 to January 28, 2020, were enrolled. Oral consent was
obtained from patients. Jinyintan Hospital, located in Wuhan, Hubei Province, the
endemic areas of COVID-19, is first designated hospital for COVID-19 patients in
Wuhan. All patients with COVID-19 enrolled in this study were diagnosed according
to World Health Organization interim guidance (7, 8). The remaining serum samples
for clinical testing were collected from two groups of patients. One group collected 63
samples from February 2, 2020 for Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
IgG and IgM antibodies. The other group collected 91 plasma samples from February
3-4, 2020 for colloidal gold-immunochromatographic assay (GICA), of which 81
cases took throat swab sample for nucleic acids (Real-Time Reverse Transcription
Polymerase Chain Reaction Assay, qRT-PCR) detection. 35 healthy individuals
served as controls in both groups.

ELISA
The novel coronavirus IgG/IgM antibody ELISA kits (lot number 2020010108)
were manufactured by Zhu Hai Liv Zon Diagnostics Inc. The 98 serum samples
were tested according to the manufacturer’s instructions. IgM capture ELISA: Firstly,
5 μL serum samples were diluted in 500 μL sample diluent. Then added 100 μL
diluted samples to duplicate wells of microplates which were coated with mouse
anti-human IgM monoclonal antibody (μchain), and incubated for 60 min at 37±1.

Plates were washed five times and reacted with 100

μL

enzyme marker

(enzyme-labeled antibody-linked antigen) for 30 min at 37±1°C for the purpose of

detecting IgM against new coronavirus in serum samples. IgG indirect ELISA:5 μL
serum samples diluted in 100 μL sample diluent were added to duplicate wells of

microplates which were coated with recombinant antigen of new coronavirus, and
incubated for 60 min at 37±1. Plates were washed five times and reacted with 100

μL enzyme marker (HRP-conjugated monoclonal mouse anti-human IgG) for 30 min
at 37±1 °C for the purpose of detecting IgG against new coronavirus in serum
samples. Plates were then washed five times, and 50 μL substrate buffer and 50 μL
tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate solution were added to each well for a
chromogenic reaction for 15 min at 37±1 °C. The color reaction was stopped by the

addition 50 μL of 2 M H2SO4 to each well. Finally, the OD450 was measured and
recorded immediately using an Infinite 200 PRO microplatereader.
GICA
The novel coronavirus IgG/IgM antibody GICA kits (lot number 2001010220) were
manufactured by Zhu Hai Liv Zon Diagnostics Inc, China. The 126 serum samples
were tested according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For each test, 10μL of serum

sample and 100μL of sample diluent were added vertically onto the sample pad of the
test strip. The strip was then placed flat to allow the solution to migrate up the

membrane, through gold-labeled pad, the testing area, quality control area and finally
to adsorption zone.
After 10 min, the result was judged by the color of the test and control lines. If both
the detection band and the control band turned red, the sample was recorded as
positive. If the control band turned red but the detection band was not colored, it was
recorded as negative. If neither band was colored, the test reagents were assumed to
be not working.

collected for extracting 2019-nCoV RNA from patients suspected of having
2019-nCoV infection. After collection, the throat swabs were placed into a sterile test
tube with 1 ml sterile saline, the sputum samples were added equal volume of
acetylcysteine (10g/L) and shaken at room temperature for 30 min to be fully
liquefied, and total RNA was extracted using the nucleic acid extraction kit (QIAamp
viral RNA mini kit). In brief, 40μL of cell lysates were transferred into a collection
tube followed by vortex for 10 seconds. After standing at room temperature for 10
minutes, the collection tube was centrifugated at 1000 rpm/min for 5 minutes. The
suspension was used for qRT-PCR assay of 2019-nCoV RNA. Then, n*19 μL mixed
reagent of fluorescence PCR detection for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid and n* 1

μL

RT-PCR enzyme (n was the number of reaction tubes) were mixed and vortexed for a
few seconds. The above mixture of 20

μL

was put into the PCR reaction tube

respectively, after that the extracted sample by 5 μL was added. qRT-PCR analysis
was conducted using the ABI 7500 Real-Time PCR System. The PCR parameters
were 45 °C for 10 min, 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s,
58 °C for 30 s, and a single fluorescence detection point at 58°C. Two target genes,
including open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) and nucleocapsid protein (N), were
simultaneously amplified and tested during the qRT-PCR assay. The qRT-PCR assay
was performed using a 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection kit according to the
manufacturer’s protocol (Shanghai ZJ Bio-Tech Co Ltd). A cycle threshold value
(Ct-value) less than 37 was defined as a positive test result, and a Ct-value of 40 or
more was defined as a negative test. These diagnostic criteria were based on the
recommendation by the National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention
(China) (http://ivdc.chinacdc.cn/kyjz/202001/t20200121_211337.html). A medium
load, defined as a Ct-value of 37 to less than 40, required confirmation by retesting.

Statistical Analysis
All analyses were performed using SPSS 22.0. Categorical variables were expressed
as frequencies (percentages), and performed using the chi-square test with Yates’s

Discussion
At present, the sample collection for nucleic acid detection of suspected cases of
COVID-19 is mostly upper respiratory tract samples (mainly throat swabs) (9). The
collection of throat swabs is not standardized and it is easy to miss the diagnosis. The
collection process is extremely risky for medical staff. Confirmed diagnosis is playing
an important role in facilitating patient isolation, treatment and assessment of
infectious activities. However, due to their limited capacity to handle an epidemic of
the current scale and insufficient supply of assay kits, only a portion of suspected
cases can be tested, leading to incompleteness and inaccuracy in updating new cases,
as well as delayed diagnosis. A fast-performing serologic assay is acutely needed for
the current and outbreak.
In this study, we tested serum samples from confirmed COVID-19 patients with
two assay kits and achieved a high positive rate. The sensitivity of the combined
ELISA IgM and IgG detection was 55/63 (87.3%), The sensitivity of the combined
GICA IgM and IgG detection was 75/91 (82.4%), and the healthy controls were
negative. The case group was COVID-19 patients diagnosed by qRT-PCR. Since
many patients are undergoing treatment, they are gradually recovering, the nucleic
acid test result has become negative, so the positive rate of patients tested was only
51.9%.
It is worth noting that the new type of coronavirus antibody of the kit is against
the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronavirus, not only against
SARS-CoV-2, but the IgG originally infected with SARS may also be positive. But
our research found, the healthy controls are all negative and the specificity is very
good.
ELISA and GICA for specific IgM and IgG antibodies is conventional
serological assays, they can offer a high-throughput alternative, which allows for
uniform tests for all suspected patients, and can facilitate more complete identification
of infected cases and avoidance of unnecessary cross infection among unselected

patients. They use plasma or serum as test samples, and blood samples can be
collected easily, which can greatly reduce the risk of infection for medical staff. The
complicated processing procedure of the sample during the laboratory test is removed,
the test result can be obtained quickly, the operation is simple, the safety of medical
staff can be protected, and the huge clinical diagnosis and treatment pressure can be
greatly relieved.
Although ELISA and GICA are simple, fast, and safe, the results can be used for
clinical reference. Cases confirmation still depended on qRT-PCR, and analyze
epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and other laboratory
data. There is a need to further increase the number of samples tested to prove their t
of sample testing to confirm their significance.
In conclusion, ELISA and GICA for specific IgM and IgG antibodies is
conventional serological assays, they are simple, fast, and safe for diagnosis
COVID-19. The results can be used for clinical reference, and the huge clinical
diagnosis and treatment pressure can be greatly relieved.
