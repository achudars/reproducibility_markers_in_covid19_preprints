Abstract
Background Covid 19 is pandemic in the UK. To date only studies in the UK on hospital deaths
have been published in the peer reviewed literature. Legal requirements for cremation in England
and Wales require the collection of information that can be used to improve understanding of Covid
19 deaths in both hospital and community settings.
Aim To document demographic and clinical characteristics, including likely place of infection, of
individuals dying of Covid 19 to inform public health policy
Design A comprehensive case series of deaths from Covid 19 between 6 April and 30 May.
Setting A crematorium in South Wales
Participants Individuals for whom an application was made for cremation.
Main outcome measures Age, sex, date and place of death, occupation, comorbidities, where
infection acquired.
Results Of 752 cremations, 215(28.6%) were Covid-19 of which 115 (53.5%) were male and 100
(46.5%) female. The median age was 82 years, with the youngest patient being 47 years and the
oldest 103 years. Over half the deaths (121/215: 56.3%) were over 80 years. Males odds of dying
in hospital, rather than the community were 1.96 times that of females (95% Confidence Intervals
(CI) 1.03 -3.74, p=0.054) despite being of similar age and having a similar number of
comorbidities. Only 21(9.8%) of 215 patients had no comorbidities recorded. Patients dying in
nursing homes were significantly older than those dying in hospital(median 88y (IQ range 82-93y)
v 80y (IQ range 71-87y): p<0.0001). Patients dying in hospital had significantly more comorbidities
than those dying in nursing homes (median 2: IQ range 1-3 v. 1: IQ range 1-2: p <0.001).
Conclusions In a representative series, comprising both hospital and community deaths, persons
over 80 with an average 2 comorbidities predominated. Although men and women were
represented in similar proportions, men were more likely to die in hospital. Over half the infections
were acquired in either hospitals or nursing and residential homes with implications for the
management of the pandemic, historically and in the future.

Background
Covid-19, a viral infectious disease caused by the SARS CoV 2 virus emerged in China at the end
of 2019 and was declared pandemic by the World Health Organisation on 11 March 20201. The first
case occurred in the UK on 31st January 2020 and in Wales, where 1,441 deaths have occurred as of
12 June 20202, on 28th February 20203. The disease has given rise to a number of far-reaching
public health measures. So far, in the UK, there have been three large community studies, of which
in two, the main outcome is deaths in hospital4,5 and in the third positive SARS CoV 2 tests6. There
has also been a small study of risk factors for intensive care unit admissions in South Wales7. All
identify similar risks for mortality and morbidity; increasing age, male gender, diabetes, chronic
heart, lung, kidney or neurological disease, malignancy and dementia. Importantly, although there
has been an ecological study comparing death rates, including out-of-hospital deaths, by local
authority area, in Great Britain8, no UK studies, to date, have reported the characteristics and risks
of death in individuals dying from COVID-19 that includes those patients dying out-of-hospital, in
nursing and residential homes or at home, as well as those dying in hospital.
In 2012, as a result of The Cremation (England and Wales) Regulations 20089, themselves arising
out of the Inquiry into Harold Shipman10, a new suite of forms for the authorisation of cremation
came into use. Although procedures have been temporarily simplified to assist the management of
the Covid-19 pandemic11, the key information requirements are unchanged. These emphasise that
the fact and cause of death has been definitely ascertained and require a brief text account (question
9, form 4) of the "symptoms and other conditions" that led to the conclusions about the cause of
deaths. This account, although unstructured, permits a view of the course of the final illness which
can be used better to understand deaths from Covid-19.
Cardiff Thornhill Crematorium is a Local Authority run crematorium (run by Cardiff Council, one
of 22 unitary local authorities in Wales) that performed 2,850 cremations in 2017, a typical year in
terms of activity.
Objectives
To characterise those individuals dying from Covid-19, that were authorised for cremation, in terms
of age, sex, occupation, comorbidities and where the infection had been acquired, in order better to
inform public health policy to address the infection.
Methods
Information was taken from: Cremation Form 4 in which a certifying clinician is required both to
record the cause of death (question 11) in a format that reflects the separate Medical Certificate of
Cause of Death (MCCD) and to give a brief account (question 9) of the "symptoms and other
conditions" that led them to that conclusion: Cremation Form 1 in which the applicant for cremation
(usually the next of kin) gives the age and occupation of the deceased. Both forms record the home
address, date and time of death. Ethnicity, however, is not recorded.
Deaths were defined as Covid-19 if specifically mentioned in response to q.11 or if a SARS CoV2
positive test was documented in response to q.9. Comorbidities were any relevant conditions
mentioned in answer to either of questions 9 or 11.
The authors authorised all patients over the study period. Data was entered onto a structured pro
forma; sex, age, occupation, date of death, location of death (hospital, institutional nursing or
residential home, own home), comorbidities and whether infection was acquired in hospital (defined
as occurring 6 days after admission OR following admission for an unrelated condition). Nursing

and residential home residents were assumed to have acquired their infection in their nursing or
residential home unless they fulfilled the criteria for having acquired the infection in hospital.
Analysis was performed in EpiInfo version 7(US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC))12. Median and interquartile ranges were calculated for age and the number of
comorbidities; simple frequencies for other variables. Differences in patient characteristics and
comorbidities (i) between men and women and (ii) by place of death were examined using the
Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables and the chi squared test (Yates corrected) for
categorical variables.
Patients and the public were not involved in this study, responding, in a timely way, to a Public
Health Emergency of International Concern.
Results
Of the total of 752 cremations authorised over the period of 6th April until 29th May, 215(28.6%)
were Covid-19 of which 115 (53.5%) were male and 100 (46.5%) female (p=NS). Dates of death
are shown in Figure 1. The median age was 82 years, with the youngest patient being 47 years and
the oldest 103 years. Over half the deaths (121/215: 56.3%) were over 80 years. Among 146
patients who died in hospital, 85 (58.2%) were male and 61 (41.8%) were female (p NS). Males'
odds of dying in hospital, rather than the community were 1.96 times that of females (95%
Confidence Intervals (CI) 1.03 -3.74, p=0.054) despite being of similar age (males: median age 81y:
interquartile (IQ) range 72y-87y v females: 84y: IQ range 72-90.5y) and having a similar number of
comorbidities (both sexes: median 2, range 0-7). Only 21(9.8%) of 215 patients had no
comorbidities recorded.
Patients' comorbidities, by place of death, are shown in Table 1. Patients dying in nursing homes
were significantly older than those dying in hospital(median 88y (IQ range 82-93y) v 80y (IQ range
71-87y): p<0.0001). Patients dying in hospital had significantly more comorbidities than those
dying in nursing homes (median 2: IQ range 1-3 v. 1: IQ range 1-2: p <0.001). Patients dying in
hospital were significantly more likely than those dying in nursing homes, to have chronic heart
disease (p<0.05) or chronic pulmonary disease, excluding asthma (p<0.05) but significantly less
likely to have dementia (p<0.00005). No patient dying in their own home had dementia (p<0.001).
Of the 31(14%) patients less than 65y, 20 were recorded as working and occupations included 2
NHS, 2 care sector and 1 transport sector staff.
Of 215 cases of Covid-19, 63 (29.3%) of infections were hospital acquired and a further 55(25.6%)
acquired in nursing or residential homes.
Discussion and Conclusions
This is the first comprehensive study of deaths, including individuals dying both in hospital and in
the community, in the United Kingdom. Other studies have either looked at patients dying in
hospital4,5,7 or patients testing positive for SARS CoV 2 in the community6 or have been ecological
studies8.
The study uses the information required by a crematorium, under the law of England and Wales9,
before a person can be cremated, information which includes a brief clinical account to support the
stated causes of death. Although unstructured text, official guidance on completion of the forms
does exist13 and this information can give a rounded picture of the circumstances leading to a death,
similar to a clinical referral letter. Cremation forms, in this way, represent a rich source of

information on the end of life and elements such as the type and appropriateness of care. This timehonoured and legally laid down process, can thus be used to promote health and prevent disease. To
utilise better, this would require a degree of central organisation at regional or national level. The
introduction of the Medical Examiner system, in England and Wales14 may present an opportunity to
do this but hitherto the focus has been almost entirely on patient satisfaction (or, more strictly, that
of their relatives) and healthcare quality. Whilst important, this ignores the usages that mortality
statistics have been put to, historically, to tackle other areas of public health such as health
protection and health promotion, such as Clean Air Acts, following the 1953 London smog or the
current tracking of Covid-19. In fact, better collation of mortality statistics and more extensive and
systematic recording of clinical, pathological and risk factor data and linking those mortality
statistics with other public data sources (eg cancer registries, prescribing data, hospital episode
statistics, air quality data) would allow the contemporary quantification of several "big ticket"
current public health issues, other than Covid-19, such as, alcohol use, obesity, anti-microbial
resistance and air pollution.
The denominator population, from which patients that use Cardiff Thornhill crematorium are
drawn, is difficult to characterise exactly, as more than one crematorium serves the Cardiff Council
area and equally cremations are accepted from other local authority areas. Cardiff itself has a
population of 335,145 persons, according to the 2011 census and Thornhill crematorium users are
thought broadly to reflect this.
Deaths occurred, as in other studies, worldwide, mainly in the elderly (median age 82y) with over
half in those over 80 years old and with over 90% having pre-existing medical conditions. The
proportion of men and women in the whole group did not differ significantly, unlike the other UK
studies, restricted to deaths in hospital. However, an excess of male deaths, in the subset of deaths
occurring in hospital, was similar to these other UK studies. The odds of men dying in hospital was
thus nearly twice that of women, even though they were of similar age with a similar number of
comorbidities. This phenomenon is unexplained and it will be of interest to know if it is replicated
in other settings where deaths in the community are also recorded.
Over half the infections, plausibly, were acquired in institutional care settings, of which nearly 30%
were acquired in hospital. Concerns have been raised about hospital transmission in other UK
settings but in the absence of official figures, the proportion has been estimated as 5-20%15. This
inevitably poses the question of what proportion of these could have been prevented by more
effective infection control procedures. It is particularly sobering to compare these percentages with
the purported benefits of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs), as modelled by Imperial
College, London,16 which were so influential in guiding UK government policy at the start of the
pandemic. The biggest predicted percentage reduction in deaths, for any of the combinations of
NPIs was also 50%. The implication of this is that more focussed interventions to prevent the
introduction of SARS CoV 2 and to control its spread, in healthcare settings, may have had the
same potential to reduce deaths as the general social distancing and other costly measures that were,
in the event, introduced. It poses the question whether the UK's high mortality, when compared
with other European countries17, has as much to do with its historically high hospital occupancy
rates18 and underfunding of the social care sector19 as it does with the, widely blamed, delay in
introducing lockdown20. Indeed, given the apparent ineffectiveness of the NPIs in keeping mortality
down, a focus on control of SARS CoV 2 infection in hospitals, nursing and residential homes
might have been a more effective approach in limiting deaths and certainly would not have resulted
in the same social and economic disruption as lockdown and general social distancing. Going
forward, this may still represent the most effective use of testing and tracing teams rather than
attempting to extinguish spread in a wider community of people who would, largely, be expected to
recover from the infection without mishap.

Conclusion
Cremation certificates represent a useful source of information on health problems locally and
could, with greater co-ordination, contribute to a national picture. In a representative series of
deaths, in persons, authorised for cremation, in South Wales, comprising both hospital and
community deaths, persons over 80 with an average 2 comorbidities predominated. Although,
unlike most other studies, there were similar proportions of men and women overall, men were
more likely to die in hospital. Over half the infections were acquired in either hospitals or nursing
and residential homes with implications for the management of the pandemic, historically and in the
future.
