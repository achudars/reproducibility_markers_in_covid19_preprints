In June 2020 Gilead Sciences CEO announced that US hospitals would be charged
$3,120 for a course of remdesivir, a price roughly 33% higher than the company plans to charge
other high-income countries.1 The sole justification offered was that remdesivir would save
hospitals $12,000 per patient by shortening hospital length of stay (LOS) by four days. This
presumed benefit was extrapolated from the ACTT-1 trial, which found median time to recovery
(an approximation of median time to hospital discharge) of 11 days in patients receiving
remdesivir versus 15 days in those receiving placebo.2
But as justification for such a high price it is critical that the ACTT-1 finding is robust. It
may not be, either because the outcomes of the study population are not generalizable, or
because of exclusion from the trial of patients who were expected to be discharged within 72
hours. Remdesivir treatment requires a 5-day inpatient stay, so patients who would otherwise
be discharged sooner may remain hospitalized to complete treatment. This also limits the
achievable LOS reduction for patients who would otherwise be hospitalized 5-8 days. The
remdesivir Emergency Use Authorization does not limit its use based on LOS, and specifies that
intravenous remdesivir be given in an in-patient setting.3 We assessed what percentage of
severe COVID-19 patients belonged to each of these LOS groups in a real world cohort.

Methods
Our study cohort consisted of adults age ≥18 years with severe COVID-19 consecutively
hospitalized from the emergency department (ED) at NewYork-Presbyterian Columbia
University Medical Center and the Allen community hospital between March 9, 2020 and April
23, 2020, with follow-up through June 10, 2020. Data abstraction methods have been published
previously.4 We defined severe COVID-19 based on remdesivir trial and FDA criteria: an initial
oxygen saturation ≤94% on room air or the use of any supplemental oxygen within 24 hours of
ED presentation.2,5 LOS was measured from presentation to death or hospital discharge.

Results
There were 1,643 adults admitted with severe COVID-19, after excluding 21 (1%) who
were discharged in <9 days to another hospital. The median age was 67 (interquartile range,
56-78) years, a majority were Hispanic or Black and had ≥1 comorbidity, 12% required
mechanical ventilation within 24 hours, median LOS was 7 (3-14) days, and in-hospital 28-day

mortality was 26%. Five-hundred and eighty-six patients (36%) had a LOS of 1-4 days, 384
(23%) had a LOS of 5-8 days, and 673 (41%) were hospitalized ≥9 days (Table). The
distribution was similar when excluding patients who died during their hospital stay (Table). The
majority of those with a LOS of 1-4 or 5-8 days were ≥60 years old (67% and 70%, respectively,
Figure).

Discussion
In our cohort the median LOS was markedly shorter than the equivalent endpoint in the
ACTT-1 trial (7 days vs. 15 days). This difference raises immediate questions as to whether
remdesivir could reduce LOS by the four days used to justify the treatment’s price. We found
that only 41% of patients could both receive a 5-day course of remdesivir and have LOS
shortened by 4 days or more, while 36% could have their LOS potentially prolonged to complete
therapy.
Our evaluation is relevant to the extent that our older-adult multi-morbidity predominant
cohort is representative of severe COVID-19; LOS may be even shorter in younger and
healthier populations. Our data are from patients hospitalized before dexamethasone became
standard of care. Some patients may be prescribed 10 rather than 5 days of remdesivir, which
could further prolong LOS (both durations are authorized by the FDA). Whether physicians will
keep patients who otherwise could be discharged to complete treatment could not be
determined.
Studying shorter remdesivir treatment courses, developing intranasal remdesivir,6 and
implementing programs to facilitate outpatient intravenous remdesivir administration should be
considered.
