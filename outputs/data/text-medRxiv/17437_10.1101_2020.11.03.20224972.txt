Conclusion
The novel primer-probe set(LZU3) targeting N gene of SARS-CoV-2 could be both
used in rRT-PCR and ddPCR with better sensitivity, furthermore, ddPCR method had
higer sensitivity than rRT-PCR, hence it could significantly improve SARS-CoV-2
detection efficiency in low virus load and asymptomatic infection.
1. Introduction
Coronaviruses (CoVs) are one of the largest class of RNA associated viruses that are
responsible for infectious disorders in human beings and mammals, the word
Coronavirus derived from Latin the meaning is crown. Coronaviruses belong from the
Coronaviriade family that has a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome. It
comprises a sizeable genome range between 26 to 32 kilobases; they have a
club-shaped structure under electron microscopy. According to the distinctive
genomic sequences, the Coronavirinae subfamily is divided into four leading
subgroups: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta, coronaviruses[1, 2]. Previously, almost six
human pathogenic coronaviruses were identified. The Novel Coronavirus
SARS-CoV-2 is highly pathogenic that is caused by severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (COVID-19). The genome sequences have revealed that
SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to SARS-CoV，it showed more than 80% similarity
with the genomes of other bat derived coronaviruses[1, 2].
In the interest of people's health in January 2020, the WHO announced the pandemic
of COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and counseled the
countries with poor health systems[3]. According to the COVID-19 situational report
209, by 16 August 2020, coronavirus disease has spread globally in 216 countries or
territories with 21 294 845 confirmed cases and 761 779 confirmed deaths[4].
The COVID-19 affected individuals can be symptomatic or asymptomatic, in the
symptomatic host's clinical manifestations are visible, but there is a lack of clinical
signs in asymptomatic hosts[5, 6]. However the early recognition of SARS-CoV-2 is
difficult because its general manifestations are similar to other atypical pneumonia,

the capability to verify or clear the suspected client during the worldwide epidemic
scenarios is crucial especially when the clinical signs are hard to differentiate[7].
At present, there are several tools and tests are suggested by health care authorities for
the diagnosis of COVID-19, but previous studies mentioned that molecular diagnosis
is a standard and most effective technique to examine rapidly human pathogenic
viruses than the CT scan and serological approaches[8-12]. Moreover, coronaviruses are
challenging to cultivate in cell culture and isolation of the pathogenic viruses demand
safety level 3 proficiency, which is not accessible in most public health institutions,
because of limitations, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) remains the most beneficial
laboratory diagnostic test for COVID-19 globally[13, 14].
SARS-CoV-2 genome structure was published to promote molecular diagnostic tests,
which assist to develop specific sets of primers and probes to detect SARS-CoV-2[15].
The first assay was released on Jan 23 to target RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
(RdRp), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) genes of SARS-CoV-2[14].
In the current situation several real-time RT-PCR and reverse transcription-PCR
(RT-PCR) assays have been evaluated by using different primers and probes to
examine SARS-CoV-2 with safety to decrease the possibility of false laboratory
diagnosis[14, 16, 17].
Although Some specific primers and probes have been formulated to target (ORF) 1ab,
envelop (E) and nucleocapsid (N) gene，but the main issue in the diagnosis of
COVID-19 is to increase the detection sensitivity and specificity of SARS-CoV-2[14, 18,
19]
.
Previous reports showed that sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 identification depends on the
limit of detection (LOD) of designed primers and kit reagents. The RdRP and E genes
had notable analytical sensitivity for detection whereas the N gene showed low
analytical sensitivity[13, 19, 20]. The WHO advised to detect at least two different targets
from the SARS-CoV-2 genome to diminish the possibility of false results[19].
In the present study, we designed the set of primers and probes N(LZU3) targeting N
gene of SARS-CoV-2 （ LZU3 ） to developed the quantitative reverse
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and droplet digital polymerase
reaction (ddPCR) for the detection and screening of SARS-CoV-2.

Metrology of China (Beijing, China). This reference material was obtained by in vitro
transcription of key characteristic genes of SARS-CoV-2, including the nucleoprotein
N gene (full length), the envelope protein E gene (full length), and the open reading
frame1ab (ORF1ab) gene fragment (genomic position: 13201-15600, GenBank

128

No.NC_045512). In the material, the copy number of ORF1ab gene was about 9.00◊

2.2 Primers and probes
Two genes of SARS-CoV-2 were used in rRT-PCR and ddPCR: an open reading
frame1ab (ORF1ab) gene and nucleoprotein N gene. For targeting ORF1ab gene, we
used the primers and probes used in previous research[21]. For targeting N gene, we
used 5 sets of primers/probes, N(CDC) and N(USA) were referred from previous
research (Laboratory testing for 2019-nCoV in humans) whereas N(LZU1), N(LZU2)
and N(LZU3) were designed by ourselves. The sequences are described in Table 1.
Primers and probes were purchased from The Beijing Genomics Institute (Beijing,
China).

2.3 Multiplex rRT-PCR
An Applied Biosystems StepOnePlus™ Real-Time PCR Systems (Applied
Biosystems, USA) was used for rRT-PCR. HI Script II U+ One Step rRT-PCR Probe
Kit (Vazyme Biotech Co., Ltd, Nanjing, China) were used for rRT-PCR. Each 30 μL
reaction mixture contained 15 μL of 2× One-Step U+ Mix, 1.5μL One-Step U+
Enzyme Mix, 0.6μL 50×ROX Reference Dye 1, 0.6μL Gene Specific Primer Forward
(10μM),0.6μL of Gene Specific Primer Reverse (10μM), 0.3μL Taqman Probe
(10μM), and 3 μL of total nucleic acid. The final concentrations of primers and probes
were 0.2 μM and 0.1 μM, respectively. The standard cycling procedure was as follows:
reverse transcription at 55°C for 15 min; polymerase activation at 95°C for 30 secs;
and 45 cycles of PCR at 95°C for 10 secs and 60°C for 30 secs (signal acquisition).
The filter combinations were 465-510 (FAM) and 540-580 (VIC). The Cq values were
determined by the automated Fit Points method.

total nucleic acid. The final concentrations of primers and probes were 900 nM and
250 nM, respectively. Secondly, twenty microliters of each reaction mix were
converted into droplets with the QX200 droplet generator (Bio-Rad). Thirdly, the
droplet-partitioned samples were then carefully transferred to a 96-well plate, sealed
and cycled in a T100 Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad) under the following cycling
procedure: 50 ◦C for 60 min (Reverse Transcription), 95 ◦C for 10 min (Enzyme
activation), followed by 40 cycles of 94 ◦C for 30 s (denaturation) and 55 ◦C for 1 min
(annealing), then 98 ◦C for 10 min (enzyme deactivation), 4 ◦C for 30 min (droplet
stabilization), and infinite 4-degree hold. Finally, after amplification, the cycled plate
was then transferred and read in the FAM and HEX channels using the QX200 reader
(Bio-Rad). The absolute copy numbers values were determined by the manual
threshold line.

2.5 Data statistical analysis
Analysis of the ddPCR data was performed with Quanta Soft analysis software
v.1.7.4.0917 (Bio-Rad) that accompanied the droplet reader to calculate the
concentration of the target DNA sequences, along with their Poisson-based 95 %
confidence intervals. The concentration reported by QuantaSoft equals to the copies
of the template per microliter of the final 1× ddPCR reaction, which was also used in
all the results. In addition, plots of linear regression were conducted with GraphPad
Prism 7.00, and probit analysis for lower limit of detection (LLoD) was conducted
with StatsDirect software v3.2.9. The LLoD were defined as the lowest concentration
at which 95 % of positive samples were detected.

3.1 One-step rRT-PCR reagents and probe chemistries
Simplex rRT-PCR with different set of primers/probe was performed using a synthetic
standard RNA transcript with about 90000 copies/µl for ORF1ab and 70000 copies/µl
for N gene as the rRT-PCR template. Each experiment was performed in duplicate.
We compared the amplification efficiency and the average Ct values for target
ORF1ab, N(CDC), N(USA1), N(LZU1), N(LZU2) and N(LZU3). The average Ct
values and standard deviations (SD) were 23.293 (0.144), 24.113(1.059),
25.866(1.769), 23.682(0.399), 24.930(0.028), 25.919(0.039), respectively (data not
shown). These results showed that the kit, the primers/probe set we designed, as well
as the amplification condition, are workable.

3.2 Limit-of-detection (LOD) of simplex one-step RT-PCR with different set of
primers/probes for target N gene
In order to investigate which primer/probe set has good amplification for the target
gene, the LOD was analyzed using serially diluted synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA
material (21000, 2100, 210, 105, 52.5, 21 and 2.1 copies/reaction for N gene). The Cq
values, detection rates, slope, Y-intercept, R2, efficiency, and LOD with 95% detection
probability are shown in Table 2. The standard curves for each primer/probe set were

shown in fig1. Comparing with the N(CDC) and N(USA1), N(LZU3) has the similar
Ct value and detection rate in the lower concentration of template, and the slope,
Y-intercept, R2 of N(LZU3) were −3.228, 38.735, and 0.989, respectively (fig 2). The
calculated PCR efficiency by machine was 104.093. The detection rate was 100% up
to 105 copies/reaction. The calculated lower limit of detection (LOD) with 95%
detection probability was 118 copies/reaction, which is the almost same as that of N
(CDC) (121 copies/reaction) and N (USA1) (119 copies/reaction), suggesting that the
prime/probe for N(LZU3) might be another potential primer/probe testing method for
target gene N of SARS-CoV-2.

3.3 Detection of SARS-CoV-2 invitro transcribed RNA reference material with
ddPCR
In order to investigate the detection efficiency of ddPCR on SARS-CoV-2, serial
dilutions of a SARS-CoV-2 invitro transcribed RNA reference material (27000, 2700,
270, 135, 67.5, 27, 2.7 copies/reaction for ORF1ab gene and 21000, 2100, 210, 105,
52.5, 21, 2.1 copies/reaction for N gene) were tested with primers/probe sets ORF1ab,
N (CDC), N(USA) and N(LZU3), the sequence can be seen in table 1. The ddPCR
results were analyzed with Quanta software using a manual threshold to define the
positive and negative droplets, the total events are above 15000 for each sample (data
not shown), which make the statistics reasonable, and the positive and negative
droplets could be distinctively separated (fig 3).

is from 118 copies/reaction to 121 copies/reaction for both ORF1ab and N
primes/probe sets (table 2). Therefore, the ddPCR is more sensitive for samples with a
low level quantity of samples.

Linear regression was analyzed according to the mean measured quantity for each
primer/probe sets. In figure 4, It shows good linearity for primer/probe sets ORF1ab,
N(CDC), N(USA) and N(LZU3), (R2: 0.9917 ,0.9886, 0.9978 and 0.9863,
respectively). The reportable range of ddPCR is from 2.7copies/reaction to 27000
copies/reaction for ORF1ab and from 2.1copies/reaction to 21000 copies/reaction for
N primes/probe sets. According to statistics, the Lower limit of detection (LOD)
which was defined as the lowest concentration at which 95 % of positive samples
were detected for primer/probe sets ORF1ab, N(CDC), N(USA) and N(LZU3) were
21.5 copies/reaction, 22.7 copies/reaction, 23.1 copies/reaction, and 22.4

Discussion
We developed a new primer/probe set N (LZU3) for targeting N gene of SARS-CoV-2
for molecular diagnosis of COVID-19 in both rRT-PCR and ddPCR. The sensitivity
and specificity of rRT-PCR is affected by various factors, such as the nucleic acid
extraction method, the one-step rRT-PCR reagent, and the primer/probe sets.
Optimizing protocols are required before using this methodology in diagnostic
laboratories [19]. There are more asymptomatic infection and mild symptomatic
infection in which the virus quantity might be very low, multiplex ddPCR might be
much more useful for detecting asymptomatic infection.
We designed three primers/probes sets targeting the N gene of SARS-CoV-2.
According to linear regression statistic in rRT-PCR, when the quantity of template
was 105 copies/reaction, the detection rate for N(LZU1) and N(LZU2) were 83.3%,
while the detection rate for N(LZU3) was 91.7%, which was similar with that of
N(CDC) and N(USA) (91.7%) (table 2). Most importantly, if the quantity of template
was 52.5 copies/reaction, the mean Ct value of N(LZU3) was 33.835, however, the
mean Ct value of N(LZU1) and N(LZU2) were above 37, which would be assumed to
be negative (table 2). For another hand, when we use N(LZU3) in ddPCR, it also
showed good linearity with LOD at 22.4 copies/reaction. These result suggested that
N (LZU3) might be another potential primer/probe set for detection of the
SARS-CoV-2. Since the N (LZU3) target the different fragment N gene from N(CDC)
and N(USA), these three primers/probe sets could be combine used in detection which
may ensure multiplex rRT-PCR methodology highly sensitive for detection of
SARS-CoV-2.

We also demonstrated that ddPCR had better sensitivity with lower LOD than
rRT-PCR. We chose different primer/probe sets N (CDC), N (USA) and N (LZU3) for
rRT-PCR, we found that the detection efficiency for low quantity of RNA template
(lower than 52.5 copies/reaction) were limited (lower than 85%). The LOD with 95%
detection probability for rRT-PCR was above 100 copies/reaction, which is 33.3
copies/ul. In this scenario we used one-step ddPCR to detect the same serial dilution
of RNA template. The LOD with 95% detection probability for ddPCR was about 20
copies/reaction, which is about 1 copy/ul, which was 5 times lower than rRT-PCR
These results confirmed that the ddPCR is more sensitive for low level quantity of
sample which is similar to previously reported results. [22, 23]. Moreover, the Biorad
Company had investigated new kit (The Bio-Rad SARS-CoV-2 ddPCR Test) for
detecting 2019-nCoV_N1, 2019-nCoV_N2, and Human RPP30 genes using Droplet
Digital PCR. In the kit, the LoD for the samples extracted with the QIAamp Viral
RNA Mini kit was also 625 cp/mL for N1 and N2, which were similar to our results.
In order to improve the detection sensitivity and specificity of SARS-CoV-2, at least

Conclusion
We developed another potential primer/probe set targeting N gene for the detection of
SARS-CoV-2, it could be used in both rRT-PCR and ddPCR. It can be combined with
ORF1ab, N(CDC) or N(USA) in multiplex rRT-PCR and ddPCR. By using these
primer/probe sets we have compared the analytical performance of rRT-PCR and
ddPCR, we found that ddPCR could significantly improve the sensitivity of detection,
which might be useful in detecting very low viral load in mild symptomatic and
asymptomatic infection of COVID-19. Furthermore, it is also suitable for monitoring
the change of the viral load in the convalescent patients.

Comparing with the suggested methods (rRT-qPCR. next generation sequencing
(NGS), and immunological detection of IgM and IgG) for detection of SARS-CoV-2,
ddPCR had several advantages. First of all, nucleic acid detecting is the most direct
way to demonstrate the presence of the virus. Secondly, ddPCR may be more proper
in which nucleic acid detection is the most direct way to demonstrate the presence of
the virus [24], it could achieve absolute quantification of SARS-CoV-2 without the
standard curve[24]. Thirdly, through detection within portioned droplets, ddPCR is
much more sensitive [25] and accurate[26] in portioned droplets detection, which is
might be a strong tool for the detection of very low viral load in mild symptomatic
and asymptomatic infection, it is also suitable for monitoring the change of the viral
load in the convalescent patients[27]. Fifthly, ddPCR has a good tolerance for PCR
inhibitory substances that might exist in the sample and reaction, therefore improve
the detecting efficiency[28]. An additional advantage of ddPCR is that it can provide
high concordance between sites, runs and operators[26, 29, 30]. However, it is not
possible to compare Ct values on different runs or different machines. Thus, the
established digital PCR method in this study with primer/probe N(LZU3) could be a
powerful complementary method for detecting SARS-CoV-2.
The only limitation of the assay is the lack of clinical samples which required
biosafety level 3 laboratory, however in future with the building of P3 facility, we will
continue our work on ddPCR detection of SARS-CoV-2.

ORF1ab, and 21000, 2100, 210, 105, 52.5, 21and 2.1 copies/reaction for ORF1ab.
Colunm H is represented the negative control (NTC, no template). The dark dots are
represented the negative droplets, while the green and blue dots representative the
positives droplets in different channels with probe HEX or FAM. The pink line is the
manual multi well thresholding.

Figure 4. Plot of results from a linearity experiment to determine reportable range of
ddPCR targeting for ORF1ab and N of SARS-CoV-2 using different primer/probe set.
RNA template quantity values (converted to log10) were plotted on the X axis versus
measured quantities (converted to log10) on the Y axis using EXCEL software. Data
are representative of three independent experiments with 3 replicates for each
concentration.
