Abstract
Early non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are crucial to prevent and control of COVID-19
pandemic. We established a stochastic non-classical SEIR NPIs model (ScEIQRsh) which can
quantify the three kinds of NPIs measures simultaneously to mimic the clustered intra-family or
intra-acquaintance spreading pattern of COVID-19 under the effective integrated NPIs in
Mainland China. Model simulation demonstrated that measures to diminish contactable
susceptible (Sc), such as home confinement, travel constraint, social distancing etc. and measures
to avoid delay of diagnosis and hospitalized isolation (η) were more effective but consumptive
than contact tracing (κ, ρ). From fitted model by MCMC method, the proportion of asymptomatic
infectors was 14.88% (IQR 8.17%, 25.37%). The association between air temperature and the
fitted transmission rate (β) of COVID-19 suggests that COVID-19 pandemic would be seasonal
with the optimal temperature range of 5℃-14℃ and peak of 10℃ for spreading, and vaccine is
indispensable to ultimate prevention COVID-19.

Introduction
COVID-19 is spreading worldwide since January 2020 and has become a global health threat.
World Health Organization (WHO) has designated this novel coronavirus as SARS-COV-2(1, 2)
and declared it as a pandemic on March 11, 2020(3). As of May 19, 2020, there are a total of
4781963 accumulative confirmed cases in 214 countries and 84503 accumulative confirmed cases
in China. During the spreading of COVID-19 in Mainland China, integrated social interventions
including lockdown of high epidemic areas, travel restriction, social distancing, contact tracing for
quarantine, and hospitalized isolation were undertaken to prevent the COVID-19 spreading in all
the provinces after the lockdown of Hubei province on the Jan 23, 2020 in emergency (4). The
effectiveness of NPIs has been proved in some infectious diseases, like influenza(5-7) and
SARS(8). The NPIs are vitally important especially for COVID-19, because of the so fast
spreading and the subsequent insufficiency of health-care resources leading to high mortality(9).
Almost all the provinces were in semi-closure and executed with community closed management,
meanwhile multiple provincial contact tracing groups were established to notify the close contacts
to be in quarantine at home or indicated shelters. And for the suspected and diagnosed COVID-19
patients, early detection, early reporting, early isolation and early treatment were adopted
according to the Chinese Clinical Guidance for COVID-19 Pneumonia Diagnoses and Treatment
version 6(10).
Under the effective social NPIs, the spreading pattern of COVID-19 in most provinces of
China was characterized of clustered or intra-family transmission(11) and mitigation by NPIs(12).
To simulate the early spreading and early social intervention, we established a novel non-classical
SEIR NPIs model, named ScEIQRsh (contactable Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-QuarantinedRemoved) model to depict COVID-19 spreading. The classical SIR or SEIR (SusceptibleExposed-Infected-Removed) epidemic model assumes that infectors mix up with all the
susceptible per day, whereas ScEIQRsh model assumes that infectors mix up with the contactable
susceptible per day. The contactable susceptible indicates the family members, relatives, coworkers, friends and some contactable strangers for obtaining daily necessities of the infectors.
Several studies assessed one single aspect of NPIs, such as travel restriction(13, 14), airport
screening(15, 16), social distancing(17), and contact tracing(18) by classical SEIR based model

without consideration of the other NPIs’ influence on the transmission property of COVID-19. We
aim to estimate the effectiveness of integrated NPIs to simulate COVID-19 restricted spreading.
With the NPIs taken into account, the other clinical features, such as incubation period, the
communicable period and the proportion of so-called asymptomatic infectors of COVID-19 were
evaluated by this comprehensive model. The meteorological impact on COVID-19 transmission
was still controversial(19, 20), and with this new ScEIQRsh model, we depicted the association of
air temperature with COVID-19 transmission rate (β) among the provinces of China.
Results
Fitting the COVID-19 transmission with integrated social NPIs
The ScEIQRsh model can be well fitted with both the reported number of daily accumulative
confirmed cases and close contacts being in quarantine in 29 provinces of Mainland China (Fig. 2,
Fig. S1). The predicted daily Rh and Q compartments were coincident with the provincial reported
numbers. From the fitting curves, the accumulative confirmed cases reached the plateau and stop
increasing within 25-30 days, which indicated that the COVID-19 transmission was mitigated after
emergency response to COVID-19 in all the provinces. The median transmission rate (β) for 29
provinces were 10.22 (IQR 8.47, 12.35), which implied about 10.22 person would be infected by
one infector in case that the susceptible are mostly acquaintances and Sc is extrapolated to infinite
(Fig. 3A, Table S2-S3). The index for overall assessment of NPIs effectiveness, Rvq, was smaller
than one in every province with a median of 0.64 (IQR 0.62, 0.66), which demonstrated that
implemented NPIs was intensive enough to make the number of free infectors decrease (Fig. 3B).
The smallest Rvq (0.53±0.02) and largest Rvq (0.75±0.02) was observed in Shandong and Hubei
province (Wuhan locates on), respectively, which implied the difficulty of NPIs with greater
burden of contact tracing if the spreading has expanded with too many infectors in Hubei.
Assessment of NPI measures mitigating the spreading of COVID-19 and suppositional
simulation
Three independent parameters, contact rate (Sc(c)), η and surveyQ, were crucial for stopping
the spreading chain and evaluated separately for NPIs effectiveness. Based on our model, the
median Sc was estimated as 26.98 (IQR:13.97, 54.57) with the highest in Hubei and lowest in
Neimenggu province (Table S3). The median Sc(c) for 29 provinces was accordingly 6.84E-07

(IQR 3.77E-07, 1.44E-06) (Fig. 4A). The κ and ρ can be used to assess the effectiveness of CCT,
and the median κ of 29 provinces was 42.0 (IQR 27.83, 60.78), suggesting that 42 close contacts
of one infector had been excavated averagely by CCT groups (Fig. S2A). The COVID-19 positive
rate (ρ) in close contacts was speculated as 0.98% (IQR 0.47%-1.60%), ranged from 0.03%-5.10%
(Fig. S2B), which was quite close to the WHO-China joint report of 0.9%-5% in China(12).
SurveyQ, the product of κ times ρ, was 0.39 (IQR 0.22, 0.55), which indicated that 0.39 positive
cases were found in close contacts of CCT averagely for each confirmed infector (Fig. 4C). The
median for velocity of hospitalized isolation for infectors (η) was 0.69 (IQR 0.47, 0.87) among 29
provinces, with η value greater than 0.85 in Jilin, Heilongjiang, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Hubei, Hunan,
Guangxi and Guizhou province (Fig. 4B).
To illustrate the influence of NPI measures on COVID-19 transmission for ScEIQRsh model,
we arbitrarily adjusted Sc (c), κ, ρ, and η value with representative 30% or 50% up/downregulation to simulate the suppositional spreading situation. If Sc (c) were 30% or 50% enlarged
or η reduced, the eventual accumulative hospitalized cases (Rh) would strongly increase, the peak
of infectors (I) would be brought backward and vice versa (Fig. 4D-4G). In case of enlarged κ or
ρ, the eventual accumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 would diminish and the plateau of
Rh would be brought forward (Fig. 4H-4I, Fig. S2C-S2F). On the same adjusted amount, the
effectiveness of Sc (c) and η on spreading prevention were stronger than that of CCT parameters,
κ and ρ.
Blind zone of contact tracing and asymptomatic infectors in NPIs strategy
With the integrated social NPIs, COVID-19 transmission mostly occurred between free
infectors and acquaintances, as well as a few strangers whom the infectors have to contact for daily
necessities in China. In a typical clustered intra-acquaintance transmission, the index case
transmitted to four of his family members and one friend directly, and the friend’s family indirectly
within half a month(21) (Fig. 5A). After emergency response, multiply provincial contact tracing
group were established to investigate the contact history of each confirmed infectors and notified
the close contacts to be in self-quarantine at home or in shelters. CCT can easily find close contacts
of acquaintances, but be inefficient in finding transmission among strangers in public space. For
example, a salesman index transmitted to two unacquainted salesmen in other sales areas
sequentially without gathering in a large mall, and a customer without any inquiry and purchase

was infected by one of the transmitted salesmen after 30-minutes lingering (Fig. 5B). This
transmission chain in strangers could not be easily found by contact tracing, and was only revealed
after all the participants appeared symptoms (Fig. 5C).
Another blind spot of contact tracing is about asymptomatic infection. Rs compartment in the
ScEIQRsh model consists of the self-recovery individuals who have never be hospitalized and not
registered in healthcare system mostly because of asymptomatic infection or mild symptoms. The
calculated proportion of asymptomatic and mild-symptom infectors without hospitalization
(untraceable infectors, utI%) by ScEIQRsh model was 14.88% (IQR 8.17%, 25.37%), ranged from
3.92%-34.36% across 29 provinces, which implied that average 14.88% COVID-19 patients
couldn’t be found out with social NPIs, and the average proportion of asymptomatic in COVID19 patients should be smaller than 14.88% (IQR 8.17%, 25.37%) (Fig. 5D). The higher surveyQ
of CCT can only reduce but not eliminate utI% (Fig. 5E), but high η could decline the utI%
constantly (Fig. 5F). Hence, contact tracing is not sufficient to find all the infectors, especially in
stranger-stranger transmission and asymptomatic infection. An integrated NPI strategy is strongly
recommended; as we earlier simulated, Sc (c) and η have stronger prevent effectiveness, which
means staying home to diminish contacts, making diagnosis and hospitalized isolation as soon as
possible.
The incubation period and communicable period of COVID-19 in ScEIQRsh model
Computed with the fitted model, the median incubation period was calculated with sigma and
eta (incubation period ≈1/σ+1/η), of 4.16 days (IQR 3.60, 4.71) (Fig. 5G). The communicable
period of COVID-19 was infectious period related to asymptomatic and some mild-symptom
infectors, with a median of 6.77 days (IQR 4.53,10.36) calculated as 1/γ (Table S2). The median
time from individuals exposed to SARS-COV-2 to being contagious was 2.39 days (IQR 2.26,
2.56) determined by 1/σ (Table S2).
The influence of air temperature on the transmissibility of SARS-COV-2
The span of mean air temperature for every province was from -15 ℃ (5 ℉) to 20.25 ℃
(68.45 ℉) during the COVID-19 spreading period of Jan to Feb 2020 in China (Fig. 6A-6B). The
nonlinear association between transmission rate β and air temperature was depicted by LOESS
fitting. As the daily air temperature increased from subzero (0℃, 32℉), the value of β raised

gradually until the air temperature went up to a peak of 7℃(44.6℉) for minimum daily
temperature, or 10℃ (50℉) for mean or 15℃ (59℉) for maximum daily temperature respectively
(Fig. 6C-6E), and then declined sharply as the temperature continued to raise. We observed
transmission rate β was higher than 11 in the range of 5℃-14℃ (41℉-57.2℉) for mean air
temperature, which may be most suitable for COVID-19 spreading.
Discussion
With the experience of SARS in 2002, the first-level public health emergency response for
COVID-19 was launched on the Jan 23, 2020 in Mainland China. The integrated NPIs are as
follows(4): 1) lockdown of high epidemic areas; 2) extension of the Spring Festival to the Feb 2,
2020; 3) inter- and intro-province travel restraint; 4) closing public places, avoiding gatherings
and staying home; 5) environmental disinfection and personal protective measures including
wearing masks; 6) social distancing; 7) setting up provincial contact tracing groups and contact
tracing for each confirmed case or imported infector; 8) notification of close contacts to be in
quarantine for 14 days at home or shelters; 9) identification of suspected COVID-19 in cough and
fever clinics separately; 10) hospitalized isolation for every confirmed case; 11) preventing
healthcare-associated infections. Among them, 1-6 diminished Sc or c, 7-8 contributed to κ and ρ,
9-11 contributed to η in the ScEIQRsh model.
The classical SEIR based NPI model usually have to be staged to simulate the propagating
stage and NPI stage separately, instead, ScEIQRsh model can well fit the realistic provincial
epidemic and NPI data of COVID-19 in China entirely without halfway adjustment of the
parameters. The assumption of ScEIQRsh model makes it a model to depict intra-acquaintance
spreading pattern, and if Sc were replaced with all the susceptible, it could degenerate into classical
SEIR model. A report of the “WHO-China Joint Mission on COVID-19 ” claimed that humanto-human transmission of COVID-19 largely occurred intra-family in China(12). In Guangdong
and Sichuan province, about 78%-85% of clustered infections were within families(12). And in
Beijing, there are 176 clustered cases among 262 confirmed cases and 133 (50.8%) were clustered
intra-family cases(11). The implementation of effective social NPIs would change the spreading
pattern of COVID-19 into intra-acquaintance spreading, in which acquaintance refers to the family
members, relatives, friends and co-workers, as well as some contactable strangers for obtaining

daily necessities. That’s the reason why ScEIQRsh model can well fit both COVID-19 epidemic
and NPI data of China.
According to the ScEIQRsh model, Sc (c) and η are more effective to diminish the eventual
accumulative number of COVID-19 cases than CCT parameters κ and ρ. We can summarize the
goal of measures 1-6 as “staying home and going out with precautions” for the susceptible, and
measures 9-11 as “quickening diagnosis and hospitalized isolation” for infectors. In case of
insufficiency of medical resources, the better way to improve η could be enlargement of the
laboratory capacity for SARS-COV-2 testing or building makeshift hospitals to increase bed
capacity (22). Contact tracing is also helpful for mitigating COVID-19 spreading, which can be
regarded as a reminder to be more precautious for close contacts (quarantine for targeted
susceptible) than the common susceptible. The surveyQ (κ•ρ) of CCT could be improved with
adding more CCT staffs, loosening the criteria of close contacts in CCT, broadening SARS-COV2 testing to close contacts, or using digital tools. Nevertheless, lockdown and stay-at-home affects
the society and economy seriously, contact tracing is an alternative option with less quarantine and
consumptions.
Additionally, the asymptomatic infectors with contagiousness are source for recurrence of
COVID-19 epidemic. We demonstrated that the median and highest proportion of asymptomatic
infectors were 14.88% and 34.36% respectively. It was consistent with the reported 18% in 700
infectors never showed symptoms on Diamond Princess by Kenji Mizumoto et al(23) and claim
of 30.8% asymptomatic cases in 565 Japanese citizens evacuated from Wuhan by Hiroshi Nishiura
et al (24). The calculated median incubation period of COVID-19 was 4.16 days (IQR 3.60, 4.71),
which was close to the reported 3 days in a study of including 1,099 laboratory-confirmed cases
by Zhong N.S et al (25) and 5.1 days in 181 confirmed cases of COVID-19 by Lessler Justin et al
(26). The median communicable period (1/γ) of asymptomatic infectors was computed as 6.77
days (IQR 4.53, 10.36), which was near the 9.6 days in 24 asymptomatic infectors reported by
Shen H.B et.al(27).
Previous studies about meteorological impact on the SARS-COV-2 transmissibility were still
controversial. Wang Mao et al(19) and Sajadi MM et al(20) reported that regions in 30-50o N’
corridor with 5℃-11℃ (41℉-51.8℉) average temperature had increased COVID-19 transmission,
but Canelle Poirier et al(28) indicated no significant correlation between high temperature/

humility and COVID-19 transmission. We found the transmission rate β increased as the minimum,
mean, maximum temperature rose from -5℃ (23℉) and reach the peak at 7℃ (44.6℉), 10℃
(50℉), and 15℃ (59℉), respectively, and then started to decline at higher temperature across the
29 provinces. It is coincident with the curves reported by Wang Mao et al(19), who have claimed
that the peak of accumulative cases of 492 cities appeared at the minimum, average and maximum
temperature of 6.7℃(44.06℉), 8.72℃(47.7℉) and 12.42℃(54.36℉) respectively. The optimal
mean temperature ranges for COVID-19 transmission was 5℃-14℃ (41℉-57.2℉). Lowen Ac
et.al proved that influenza virus transmission by droplets was greater and the peak duration of
virus shedding lasted longer at 5℃ (41℉) than 20℃ (68℉)(29). Indeed, we observed the β of
COVID-19 at 5℃ (7.39±1.62) was higher than β at 20.25℃ (4.39±1.63). Another similar
infectious disease, SARS was found with higher transmission in temperature<24.6℃ than >24.6℃
circumstance in Hong Kong(30). From the curve we illustrated, we could suspect the transmission
rate would further reduce at higher temperature over 20.25℃ (68.45 ℉). It can be expected that
COVID-19 pandemic spreading would mitigate for the northern hemispheres in the coming
summer, but it is very likely to become a seasonal infectious disease. The broader range of air
temperature for optimal COVID-19 transmission strongly suggests the necessity and urgency of
vaccine at present or in the future.
This study only included the epidemic date of Mainland China for model validation because
we cannot access the NPIs data, e.g. close contacts of other countries. This model could be fitted
even if the NPIs data is sparse, but with less accuracy. The limited latitude spans made the range
of air temperature not so broad, especially for higher temperature, though the association of air
temperature with COVID-19 transmission rate was informative and suggestive. The proportion of
asymptomatic infection was smaller than some other reports, which may due to the meaning of
asymptomatic infectors has changed. The asymptomatic infectors mentioned in latter reports
usually indicated SARS-COV-2 RNA positive individuals without symptoms, and this could
happen in the early infection phase of SARS-COV-2.
In conclusion, we provided a new tool for quantitative assessment or prediction of the
effectiveness of NPIs strategy, which was validated with both spreading and social intervention
data of COVID-19 in China. The effectiveness of the three kinds of NPI measures in the fitted
model and the influence of air temperature on COVID-19 transmissibility were quantitatively
assessed, which provided new evidence to decision making of NPIs strategy for COVID-19

prevention and control. This model is also applicable for any other regions because the proportion
of acquaintances and strangers could auto-adjust by the fitting process, and it is also suitable for
other similar infectious disease.
Materials and Methods
Development of the dynamical non-classical SEIR model for COVID-19
The developed comprehensive ScEIQRsh model contains six compartments named as Sc
(contactable susceptible), E (the exposed to SARS-COV-2), Q (daily close contacts being in
quarantine), I (infectors outside of the healthcare system), Rh (accumulative hospitalized infectors),
and Rs (self-recovery individuals with asymptomatic infection or mild symptoms who have never
be hospitalized and registered in healthcare system) (Fig. 1). Sc represents the contactable
susceptible under the social NPIs, such as lockdown, social distancing, cancelling gatherings,
closing public places, which is set as a random variable in the model. Q reflects the contact tracing
(CCT) for quarantine, and Rh reflects the isolation of confirmed and hospitalized infectors. E, I,
and Rs compartments were outside of the healthcare system. The model can be mathematically
described as five differential equations (details in the supplementary methods).
Parameters in ScEIQRsh model
The definition and initial range of model parameters of β, σ, γ, κ, ρ, ω, η and Sc in the model
were listed in Table S1. β was the transmission rate dependent of the property of SARS-COV-2. σ
and γ were associated with the intrinsic incubation period and communicable period of COVID19. κ, ρ and ω were associated with contact tracing and quarantine. η reflected the pace of
confirmed diagnosis and hospitalized isolation for infectors. Other indexes could be calculated
from the solved model, such as the contact rate (Sc(c)), the quality of CCT (surveyQ), the
proportion of untraceable infectors (approximately equate to the asymptomatic) (utI%), the
incubation period and communicable period of SARS-COV-2, and among them, Sc(c) reflects the
proportion of Sc in population under the integrated NPIs, surveyQ represents the quality of contact
tracing. Rvq is defined as the ratio of transmission velocity to remove velocity when Q reached
the apex, which is used to evaluate the overall effectiveness of integrated NPIs.
Data and model validation

The daily accumulative confirmed cases and daily close contacts being in quarantine of
COVID-19 from January to March, 2020 through the 31 Provincial Health Commission of
Mainland China were collected. Xizang and Qinghai province were excluded because of few cases,
with only one and 18 confirmed cases respectively. Almost all the diagnosed cases were
hospitalized in isolation wards simultaneously according the Guidance, thus the reported
confirmed cases were just the hospitalized infectors in China. Details of the criteria of confirmed
cases and close contacts in quarantine were clarified in the supplementary methods. We fitted both
the reported accumulative confirmed cases and daily close contacts in quarantine with Rh and Q
compartments by ScEIQRsh model for each province. The value of parameters was random
sampled with one of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, Metropolis-Hastings (M-H)
algorithm, and documented under an appropriate tolerance of best fitting with at least 100000
iterations of 0.1 step size from 0 to 60 days with burn-in of 50000 iterations for every province of
Mainland China.
Air temperature of provinces in China during the COVID-19 spreading
The minimum, mean, maximum air temperature of each province was collected from the
National Meteorological Administration from Jan 15, 2020 to Feb 15, 2020 (one week before and
three weeks later of Jan 23, 2020 (Day 0)). The LOESS regression was used to depict the
relationship between the air temperature of 29 provinces and COVID-19 transmission rate in
ScEIQRsh model.
Statistical analysis
The enrolled 29 provinces for model validation were separated into seven geographical
regions, named as North, Northeast, East, Central, Northwest, South and Southwest China. Both
curves of Rh and Q was simultaneously fitted with the raw data by least squares method with
tolerance of 1.05, and the cost function was SSE/SST (Sum of Squares for Error/Sum of Squares
for Total). The proposal distribution for accept-reject in M-H algorithm is a Bernoulli distribution
from the comparison of cost function of curve fitting in iteration. The data process was performed
on R (version 3.6.1), and the “deSolve” R package was used as the solver of differential equations.
The R source code can be found in GitHub. The parameters were denoted as mean±SD for each
province, and the median (interquartile range, IQR: 25%, 75%) was used for describing across
provinces.
