Running title: Immunogenicity of BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine in nursing home

27

residents.

28

ABSTRACT

29

Objectives: The immunogenicity of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine is understudied

30

in elderly people with comorbidities. We assessed SARS-CoV-2-S-targeted antibody

31

and T cell responses following full vaccination in nursing home residents (NHR).

32

Methods: We recruited 60 NHR (44 female; median age, 87.5 years), of whom 10 had

33

previously had COVID-19, and 18 healthy controls (15 female; median age, 48.5 years).

34

Pre- and post-vaccination blood specimens were available for quantitation of total

35

antibodies binding RBD and enumeration of SARS-CoV-2-S-reactive IFN-γ CD4+ and

36

CD8+ T cells by flow cytometry.

37

Results: The seroconversion rate in presumably SARS-CoV-2 naïve NHR (95.3%),

38

either with or without comorbidities, was similar to controls (94.4%). A robust booster

39

effect was documented in NHR with prior COVID-19. Plasma antibody levels were

40

higher in convalescent NHR than in individuals across the other two groups. A large

41

percentage of NHR had SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive IFN-γ CD8+ and/or CD4+ T cells at

42

baseline, in contrast to healthy controls. Either CD8+ and/or CD4+ T-cell responses were

43

documented in all control subjects after vaccination. Contrariwise, the percentage of

44

NHR exhibiting detectable SARS-CoV-2 IFN-γ CD8+ or CD4+ T-cell responses (or

45

both), irrespective of their baseline SARS-CoV-2 infection status, dropped consistently

46

after vaccination. Overall, SARS-CoV-2 IFN-γ CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell responses in

47

NHR decreased in post-vaccination specimens.

48

Conclusion: The BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine elicits robust SARS-CoV-2-S

49

antibody responses in NHR. Nevertheless, the frequency and magnitude of detectable

INTRODUCTION

55

The BNT162b2 (Pfizer–BioNTech) COVID-19 vaccine, a nucleoside-modified

56

messenger RNA that encodes the full-length transmembrane S glycoprotein locked in its

57

perfusion conformation, elicits high levels of serum neutralizing antibodies (NtAb),

58

mainly targeting the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD), and strong TH1-

59

skewed functional CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in experimental models and humans

60

[1-4]. The efficacy of the vaccine has been shown to approach 95% in preventing severe

61

COVID-19 across a wide range of age groups [5]. Nevertheless, there is scarce

62

information as to the immunogenicity and efficacy of this vaccine in elderly people with

63

comorbidities and frailty [6-7], who have been prioritized for vaccination worldwide

64

due to their increased risk of developing severe clinical forms of COVID-19 [8]; indeed,

65

this subset was underrepresented in a phase III clinical trial [5]. In this regard, data from

66

the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine phase I trial suggested reduced lower antibody

67

responses in older people compared to younger participants [2]. To gain further insight

68

into this issue, here we assessed SARS-CoV-2-S targeted antibody and functional T cell

69

responses after vaccination with BNT162b2 in a cohort of nursing home residents

70

(NHR), most displaying one or more comorbidities, either presumably SARS-CoV-2

71

naïve or with documented prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.

74

We enrolled a total of 60 subjects (44 female) onto the study, randomly selected from

75

two NH affiliated to the Clínico-Malvarrosa Health Department, Valencia (Spain),

76

which together provide care for 226 residents. The median age of participants was 87.5

77

years (range, 53-100). As shown in Table 1, 51 subjects (84%) had one or more

78

comorbidities at enrollment (median, 4; range, 1-7). A total of 18 healthy individuals

79

(15 female) aged a median of 48.5 years (range, 27 to 60 years) with no history of

80

SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline served as controls. Baseline blood specimens were

81

collected within one week before first vaccine dose (from January 2021 to mid February

82

2021) in both NHR and controls. Post-vaccination specimens were drawn at a median of

83

17. 5 days (range, 14-35 days) or 15 days (range, 13-35 days) after the second dose in

84

NHR and controls, respectively (from February 2021 to mid March 2021). Blood

85

specimens from participants were collected in sodium heparin tubes (Beckton

86

Dickinson, U.K. Ltd., UK). Plasma specimens were separated following centrifugation

87

and cryopreserved at -20 ºC. Informed consent was obtained from participants. The

88

study was approved by the Hospital Clínico Universitario INCLIVA Research Ethics

89

Committee (February, 2021).

and 250 U/mL; (ii) Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (Roche Diagnostics) a qualitative

99

ECLIA detecting IgG and IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein. Both

100

assays were run on cobas® e601 modular analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Rotkreuz,

101

Switzerland). Plasma specimens were further diluted (1/10) for antibody quantitation

102

when appropriate. (iii) LIAISON® SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS IgG assay (Diasorin S.p.A,

103

Saluggia, Italy), run on a DiaSorin LIAISON platform (DiaSorin, Stillwater, USA),

104

which measures IgG antibodies against a trimeric S-protein antigen. Samples yielding

105

<13 AU/ml were considered negative. Immunoassays were performed and interpreted

106

following the instructions of the respective manufacturers. Cryopreserved plasma

107

specimens were thawed and assayed in singlets within one month after collection.

108

Baseline and follow-up specimens from a given participant were analyzed in the same

109

run.

SARSCoV2reactive IFNγproducingCD8+ and CD4+ T cells were enumerated

112

by flow cytometry for ICS (BD Fastimmune, BDBeckton Dickinson and

113

CompanyBiosciences, San Jose, CA), as previously described [10,11]. Briefly,

114

heparinized whole blood (0.5mL) was simultaneously stimulated for 6h with two

115

sets of 15mer overlapping peptides (11mer overlap) encompassing the

116

SARSCoV2 Spike (S) glycoprotein (S1, 158 peptides and S2, 157 peptides) at a

117

concentration of 1μg/mL per peptide, in the presence of 1μg/ml of costimulatory

118

monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to CD28 and CD49d. Peptide mixes were obtained from

119

JPT peptide Technologies GmbH (Berlin, Germany). Samples mock-stimulated with

120

phosphatebuffered saline (PBS)/dimethyl sulfoxide and costimulatory antibodies were

121

run in parallel. Brefeldin A (10μg/mL) was added for the last 4h of incubation.

the day of testing, stimulated blood was thawed at 37°C, washed, permeabilized (BD

124

permeabilizing solution) and stained with a combination of labeled mAbs

125

(antiIFNγFITC, antiCD4PE, antiCD8PerCPCy5.5, and antiCD3APC)

126

for 1h at room temperature. Appropriate positive (phytohemagglutinin) and isotype

127

controls were used. Cells were then washed, resuspended in 200μL of 1%

128

paraformaldehyde in PBS, and analyzed within 2h on an FACSCanto flow cytometer

129

using DIVA v8 software (BD Biosciences Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, CA).

130

CD3+/CD8+ or CD3+/CD4+ events were gated and then analyzed for IFNγ production.

131

All data were corrected for background IFN-γ production and expressed as a percentage

132

of total CD8+ or CD4+ T cells. Representative flow cytometry plots are shown in

133

Supplementary Figure 1.

134

Statistical methods

135

Frequency comparisons for categorical variables were carried out using the Fisher exact

136

test. Differences between medians were compared using the Mann–Whitney U-test or

137

the Wilcoxon test for unpaired and paired data, when appropriate. Two-sided exact P-

138

values were reported. A P-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. The

139

analyses were performed using SPSS version 20.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).

SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in NHR and controls

142

No serological evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection was found in 49 (83%) of the

143

59 NHR at baseline. Pre-vaccination plasma was not available from one patient. In

144

addition, these subjects had been tested at least once for presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA

145

in nasopharyngeal specimens since the beginning of the epidemic, as a part of a local

146

public health policy for nursing homes, systematically returning negative results. Ten

147

(17%) NHR had suffered from COVID-19, as evidenced by presence of SARS-CoV-2 S

148

and N-specific antibodies and a history of compatible clinical picture and one or more

149

RT-PCR positive results in nasopharyngeal specimens (convalescent NHR).

150

Plasma collected after the second vaccine dose was available for 43 of the 49 NHR with

151

no documented prior infection. One of the remaining six patients died before having

152

received the second dose. Forty-one out of the 43 subjects tested positive by Roche

153

SARS-CoV-2-S immunoassay. All but one specimen tested negative by SARS-CoV-2

154

N immunoassay, suggesting that one NHR had presumably contracted SARS-CoV-2

155

infection between the first and the second vaccine dose. Therefore, the overall

156

seroconversion rate in this NHR group was 95.3%. Of interest, plasma specimens from

157

NHR and controls testing negative were run with LIAISON® SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS

158

IgG assay, also returning negative results. All 10 convalescent NHR had detectable

159

SARS-CoV-2 S and N-binding antibodies at baseline; one patient died before receiving

160

the second vaccine dose. A booster effect was observed in all nine individuals following

161

full dose vaccination, with a median 33-fold (range, 10 to 600-fold) increase in antibody

162

levels. Seventeen out of 18 controls had SARS-CoV-2 S-binding antibodies after the

163

second vaccine dose, while none tested positive for N-specific antibodies. Accordingly,

164

the seroconversion rate in this subgroup was 94.4%. As shown in Figure 1, plasma

165

levels of SARS-CoV-2 S antibodies following complete vaccination were higher

166

(P<0.01) in convalescent patients (all 2,500 IU/ml) than in presumably SARS-CoV-2

167

naïve NHR (median 1120 IU/ml; range, 1.08-2,500) or controls (median 2,211 IU/ml;

168

range, 18.4-2,500).

169

Among NHR with no documented prior infection, the seroconversion rate was

170

comparable (P>0.99) in individuals presenting either with (33/35; 94%) or without

171

comorbidities (9/9; 100%). Moreover, having a comorbidity did not impact significantly

174

SARS-CoV-2-S-specific T cells in NHR and controls

175

Analysis of pre-vaccination blood specimens revealed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 S-

176

reactive IFN-γ CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in 18 (36.7%) and 30 (61.2%) of 49 naïve NHR,

177

and in 6 (60%) and 8 (80%) out of 10 infected NHR; these figures were substantially

178

lower in healthy controls (17.6% for CD8+ and 29% for CD4+ T cells) (Table 2).

179

Following the second vaccine dose, all control subjects had detectable SARS-CoV-2 S-

180

reactive IFN-γ CD4+ T cells and 88% had both IFN-γ CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.

181

Conversely, the percentage of NHR exhibiting detectable SARS-CoV-2 IFN-γ CD8+ or

182

CD4+ T cell responses (or both), independently of their baseline SARS-CoV-2 infection

183

status, dropped consistently after vaccination (except for CD8+ T cells in NHR without

184

prior infection), as shown in Table 2. Both loss and de novo acquisition of detectable

185

SARS-CoV-2 IFN-γ CD8+ or CD4+ T-cell responses were observed in some

186

individuals, particularly in CD8+ T cells. Overall, the magnitude of SARS-CoV-2 IFN-γ

187

CD8+ or CD4+ T cell responses in NHR, irrespective of their SARS-CoV.2 infection

188

status, decreased consistently in post-vaccination specimens, as can be seen in Table 3.

189

The opposite was observed for healthy controls. The same differential kinetics pattern

190

between NHR and controls was noticed when individuals with detectable T cell

191

responses at baseline were analyzed separately (Figure 2).

192

Overall, the rate and magnitude of detectable SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive IFN-γ CD8+ and

193

CD4+ T cell responses following vaccination were comparable in NHR with or without

194

comorbidities (Supplementary Table 1).

196

Data on the immunogenicity of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine in elderly people

197

with comorbidities is relatively limited. The phase I trial [2] included 12 participants

198

aged 55-85 years and assessed only B cell immunity using a SARS-CoV-2 serum

199

neutralization assay and RBD or S1-binding antibody assays. Slightly weaker antibody

200

responses were reported in older people than in younger participants [2]. Brockman et

201

al. [6] found suboptimal antibody responses after the first vaccine dose in long-term

202

care facility residents as compared to controls. Collier et al. [7] evaluated SARS-CoV-

203

2-S-targeted B and T cell responses elicited by multiplex particle-based flow cytometry,

204

and T cell responses as measured by a CD3+ IFN-γ Fluorospot, in 50 participants with a

205

median age of 81 years. They found comparable serum antibody neutralization titers

206

and SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive T cell numbers in participants 80 years or above as in

207

those under 80 following the second vaccine dose.

208

Here, we quantified total antibodies binding SARS-CoV-2 RBD by means of an ECLIA

209

normalized to the first WHO international standard [9], which strongly correlate with

210

neutralizing antibody titers [12,13]. In turn, SARS-CoV-2-S-reactive IFN-γ-producing

211

CD8+ and CD4+ T cell were enumerated using a whole blood flow cytometry assay

212

[10,11] at a median of 2-3 weeks after the second vaccine dose. Most NHR recruited

213

(median age, 87.5 years) had one or more comorbidities (84%), and were either with or

214

without a SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis by serological and molecular assay prior to

215

vaccination. The main findings of the study are summarized as follows.

216

First, overall, the SARS-CoV-2-S seroconversion rate was similar in NHR (95.2%) and

217

controls (94.4%), with no significant differences in median antibody levels across

218

groups. To rule out the presence of antibodies targeting epitopes outside RBD in plasma

219

specimens from NHR and controls testing negative, these were run with a SARS-CoV-2

220

TrimericS IgG assay, which also returned negative results. Second, a dramatic booster

221

effect was documented in all NHR previously infected by SARS-CoV-2; in fact, these

222

subjects reached significantly higher antibody levels than those measured in presumably

223

naïve NHR and controls.

224

Third, while detectable SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive IFN-γ CD8+ and/or CD4+ T-cell

225

responses were documented in post-vaccination specimens from all control subjects,

226

they were present in 50%-70% of NHR, depending upon the T cell subset considered

227

and whether or not subjects had prior history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this context,

228

NHR individuals with no prior documentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection appeared to

229

display poorer post-vaccination T cell responses than convalescent NHR. Moreover, in

230

contrast to controls, a consistent decrease in the number of SARS-CoV-2-S-reactive

231

IFN-γ CD8+ and CD4+ T cells was noticed in post-vaccination specimens from most

232

NHR, regardless of their SARS-CoV-2 infection status. Interpreting the T cell response

233

data presented herein is shadowed by difficulty in ascertaining the true infection status

234

of NHR and controls, regarding which a differential effect of the second BNT162b2

235

dose on T and B cell immunity was reported in COVID-19-naïve and recovered

236

individuals, with the latter exhibiting poorer responses [14,15]. In effect, functional

237

SARS-CoV-2-S IFN-γ T cells detected in pre-vaccination specimens from NHR and

238

controls with no evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection may well have been seasonal

239

coronavirus cross-reactive T cells, reported to be present in up to 60% (for CD4+ T

240

cells) of pre-pandemic blood specimens [see 16 for review]. Circulation of seasonal

241

coronaviruses in NH facilities and repeat exposure of residents is common over the

242

winter season. This may account for the large percentage of NHR with no documented

243

prior SARS-CoV-2 infection displaying T cell responses at baseline (60% for CD4+ T

244

cells). Nevertheless, we cannot rule out that some of the current study participants,

245

NHR in particular, could have been asymptomatically infected and failed to mount

246

durable antibody responses, despite robustly expanding SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells

247

[17]. This is plausible, as several SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks were declared in both NH

248

during 2020. Likewise, healthy controls in this study were laboratory employees or staff

249

at the Microbiology unit, and could have been exposed and infected. Regardless of the

250

true SARS-CoV-2 infection status of participants, NHR displayed poorer SARS-CoV-2

251

T-cell responses than healthy controls after vaccination. In contrast, Collier et al. [7]

252

found no age-related differences in T-cell response after full vaccination dose, although

253

the authors admitted they were unable to adjust for confounders such as immune

254

suppression and comorbidities and had no information on pre-vaccination SARS-CoV-2

255

infection status of participants. Our findings could be partly explained by the

256

detrimental impact of age-related immunosenescence on immune response to vaccines

257

[18]. Nonetheless, there is biological and clinical use in elucidating whether either

258

cross-reactive or truly specific pre-existing immunity to SARS-CoV-2 may qualitatively

259

or quantitatively modulate vaccine-elicited T cell immune responses, and if so, how this

260

translates into effective protection against the virus. The apparent contraction of SARS-

261

CoV-2-S-reactive IFN-γ T cells in convalescent NHR following the second vaccine

262

dose was also observed by Camara et al. [14], who hypothesized that this second dose

263

may functionally exhaust SARS-CoV-2-S-specific T cells. This may also apply to

264

cross-reactive T cells. In this sense, CD4+ T cell responses against common cold

265

coronaviruses (CCC) were decreased in SARS-CoV-2-infected health care workers,

266

suggesting that exposure to SARS-CoV-2 might somehow interfere with CCC

267

responses [19]. Whether this might also be the case following vaccination needs to be

268

defined. Fourth, comorbidities did not appear to have a major impact on either

269

seroconversion rate or magnitude of antibody or T-cell responses following the second

270

vaccine dose in NHR.

271

The current study has several limitations that must be underlined. Firstly, the number of

272

participants was relatively limited; second, the possibility that NHR displayed SARS-

273

CoV-2-S-reactive T cells with functional specificities other than IFN-γ production was

274

not explored. Additionally, a whole-blood flow cytometry assay was used to assess T-

275

cell immunity: it is uncertain whether employing isolated peripheral blood mononuclear

276

cells instead would increase sensitivity. Finally, no attempt was made to differentiate

277

between truly SARS-CoV-2-specific and cross-reactive T cells, which can be

278

accomplished according to recent reports, although this need further validation [20,21].

279

In summary, we were able to document robust SARS-CoV-2-S antibody responses

280

equivalent to those of healthy controls in NHR following complete vaccination,

281

irrespective of SARS-CoV-2 infection status and presence or absence of comorbidities.

282

Nevertheless, our data point to differential vaccine effectivity between NHR and

283

controls in terms of eliciting SARS-CoV-2 IFN-γ T-cell responses. In this context, the

284

potential detrimental effect of pre-existing bona fide or cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2

285

immunity seen in NHR merits further investigation.
