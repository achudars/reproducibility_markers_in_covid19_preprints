Abstract
The B.1.1.7 strain, a variant strain of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), is thought to have higher transmissibility than previously circulating strains in England. This paper
proposes a method to estimate the selective advantage of a mutant strain over previously circulating
strains using the time course of B.1.1.7 strain frequencies and the distribution of serial intervals. The
method allows instantaneous reproduction numbers of infections to change during the target period of
analysis. The proposed method, instead, assumes that the selective advantage of a mutant strain over
previously circulating strains is constant over time. Applying this method to the sequence data of SARSCoV-2 in England, the instantaneous reproduction number of the B.1.1.7 strain is estimated to be 33.7%
(with a 95% confidence interval (CI) from 33.6% to 33.9%) higher than previously circulating strains in
England, assuming that serial intervals of COVID-19 follow a lognormal distribution with a mean of 4.7
days and a standard deviation of 2.9 days. The result indicated that the control measure against B.1.1.7
strain needs to be strengthened by 33.7% from that against previously circulating strains. To get the same
control effect as before, contact rates between individuals needed to be restricted to 0.748 of the contact
rates that had been achieved by the control measure taken for previously circulating strains.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, has
been rapidly evolving since its emergence in 2019. In December 2020, the Public Health England
detected a new cluster of SARS-CoV-2 viruses phylogenetically distinct from the other strains circulating
in the United Kingdom (Chand et al. 2020). These viruses belong to the lineage B.1.1.7 according to the
PANGO nomenclature (Rambaut et al. 2020b). The World Health Organization (WHO) designated them
as Variant of Concern, year 2020, month 12, variant 01 (VOC 202012/01) (World Health Organization
2020).
The B.1.1.7 strain was first detected in England in September 2020, and the numbers of infections with
this strain increased in October and November in 2020 (Chand et al. 2020). By February 2021, B.1.1.7
strain occupied 95% of the SARS-CoV-2 circulating in England (Davies et al., 2021).
Several studies have compared the transmissibility of the B.1.1.7 strain to that of previously circulating
strains. Davies et al. estimated that the reproduction number of the B.1.1.7 strain is 43‚Äì90% (with a 95%
credible interval of 38‚Äì130%) higher than preexisting strains using data from England (Davies et al.,
2021). However, different models resulted in different ranges of estimates in their multiplicative increase
in reproduction number (ùëÖ). Grabowski et al. estimated a 83‚Äì118% increase with a confidence interval of
71‚Äì140% compared to previously circulating strains in England (Grabowski et al. 2021). Volz et al.
estimated 40‚Äì75% increase in ùëÖ using data from England (Volz et al. 2021). Their methods use the linear
regression of log odds ratio between B.1.1.7 strains and previously circulating strains and estimate
increase in transmissibility under the assumption that ùëÖ is constant over time during the target period of
analysis. Washington et al. estimated a 35‚Äì45% increase using data from the United States of America
using Volz‚Äôs method (Washington et al., 2021). Chen et al. estimated 49‚Äì65% increase in reproduction
number using data from Switzerland also under the constant ùëÖ assumption (Chen et al., 2021). Due to the
high transmissibility the B.1.1.7 strain, strong control measures such as lockdown were taken when the
strain was introduced (Davies et al., 2021). Thus, the constant ùëÖ assumption is questionable when
analyzing the increase in the reproduction number of B.1.1.7 compared to that of previously circulating
strains.
In this paper, we propose a method to estimate the selective advantage of a mutant strain over previously
circulating strains. Based on Fraser‚Äôs method to estimate instantaneous reproduction numbers (Fraser
2007), our method allows reproduction numbers to change during the target period of analysis. Our
approach is also based on the Maynard Smith‚Äôs model of allele frequencies in adaptive evolution, which
assumes that the selective advantage of a mutant strain over previously circulating strains is constant over
time (Maynard Smith and Haigh 1974). Applying the developed method to the sequence data in England
using the serial interval distribution of COVID-19 estimated by Nishiura et al. (Nishiura et al., 2020), we
estimate the increase in the instantaneous reproduction number of B.1.1.7 strains compare to that of
previously circulating strains in England. Based on the estimate, we discuss its implication to control
measures for COVID-19.

Nucleotide sequences of SARS-CoV-2 viruses were downloaded from the GISAID EpiCoV database
(Shu & McCauley, 2017) on March 1, 2021. Nucleotide sequences of viruses detected in England were
selected and aligned to the reference amino acid sequence of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 virus
(YP_009724390) using DIAMOND (Buchfink et al. 2015). The aligned nucleotide sequences were
translated into amino acid sequences, then were aligned with the reference amino acid sequence using
MAFFT (Katoh et al. 2002). Amino acid sequences having either an ambiguous amino acid or more than
ten gaps were excluded from the rest of analyses. Table 1 shows amino acids on the spike protein used to
characterize B.1.1.7 strain, retrieved from the PANGO database (Rambaut et al. 2020b).

We divided amino acid sequences into three groups based on amino acids shown in Table 1. The first
group consists of sequences having all of B.1.1.7-defining amino acids in Table 1. We call a virus in this
group a ‚ÄúB.1.1.7 strain‚Äù. The second group contains sequences that have none of the B.1.1.7-defining
substitutions. We call a virus in this group a ‚Äúnon-B.1.1.7 strain‚Äù. The third group is a set of sequences
that have at least one but incomplete set of the B.1.1.7-defining amino acids. We call a strain in the third
group a ‚ÄúB.1.1.7-like strain‚Äù. Table 2 shows the number of sequences categorized into each group. Figure
1 shows the daily numbers of GISAID sequences of B.1.1.7 strains, non-B.1.1.7 strains and B.1.1.7-like
strains detected in England from September 1, 2020 to February 19, 2021. We used the number of B.1.1.7
strains and non-B.1.1.7 strains for the rest of the analyses. B.1.1.7-like strains were excluded from the
analyses, since we do not know whether they had the same transmissibility as B.1.1.7 strains or not.
These numbers are provided in Supplementary Table 1.

The serial interval is the time from illness onset in a primary case to illness onset in a secondary case
(Nishiura et al., 2020). The method we propose in this paper uses discrete distributions of serial intervals.
Let ùëî(ùëñ) denote the probability that the serial interval of a transmission is ùëñ days. We obtained the values
of ùëî(ùëñ) by discretizing the lognormal distribution of serial intervals of COVID-19 estimated by Nishiura
et al. (Nishiura et al., 2020). Thus, the probability mass function of serial intervals for ùëñ ‚â• 0 is given by

Let us suppose that we have a large population of viruses consisting of strains of two genotypes ùê¥ and ùëé,
of which frequency in the viral population at a calendar date ùë° are ùëû$ (ùë°) and ùëû% (ùë°), respectively. Suppose
also that genotype ùê¥ is a mutant of ùëé that emerged at time ùë°& .

We assume that a virus of genotype ùê¥ generates 1 + ùë† times as many secondary transmissions as those of
genotype ùëé. Then, ùë† can be considered as the coefficient of selective advantage in adaptive evolution. As
described in Maynard Smith and Haigh (1974), the frequency of viruses of allele ùê¥ after n transmissions,
ùëû' , satisfies the following equation:
(1 + ùë†)ùëû'
1+ùë†
(1)
ùëû'"# =
=
ùëû .
(1 + ùë†)ùëû' + (1 ‚àí ùëû' ) 1 + ùë†ùëû' '
Maynard Smith‚Äôs formulation of allele frequency can be extended using the concept of instantaneous
reproduction numbers of infectious diseases. The instantaneous reproduction number is defined as the
average number of people someone infected at time ùë° could expect to infect given that conditions remain
unchanged (Fraser 2007). Let ùêº(ùë°) be the number of infections by viruses of either genotype ùê¥ or ùëé at
calendar time ùë° and ùëî(ùëñ) be the probability mass function of serial intervals, defined in the previous
subsection. Suppose that instantaneous reproduction numbers of genotypes ùê¥ and ùëé at calendar time ùë° are
ùëÖ$ (ùë°) and ùëÖ% (ùë°), respectively. Assuming that the distribution of generation time of a disease can be
approximated by the serial interval distribution, the following equations give the discrete version of
Fraser‚Äôs instantaneous reproduction numbers of infections by genotype ùê¥ and ùëé at time ùë°.
ùëÖ$ (ùë°)

‚àí ùëñ)

(3)

Suppose that ùëî(ùëñ) is small enough to be neglected for ùëñ < 1 and ùëñ > ùëô, then ùëî(ùëñ) can be truncated and the
above formula can be treated as follows.
ùëÖ$ (ùë°)

ùëû$ (ùë°)ùêº(ùë°)

Since a virus of genotype ùê¥ generates 1 + ùë† times as many secondary transmissions as those of genotype

the number of infections at the time when previous generations infected can be regarded as considerably
small, i.e.
ùêº(ùë° ‚àí 1) ‚âà ùêº(ùë° ‚àí 2) ‚âà ‚ãØ ‚âà ùêº(ùë° ‚àí ùëô) .

B.1.1.7-difining substitutions on its spike protein were considered as genotype ùê¥. The non-B.1.1.7 strains,
viruses having none of B.1.1.7-defining substitutions were considered to be genotype ùëé. The B.1.1.7-like
strains, viruses having an incomplete set of B.1.1.7 substitutions on the spike protein, were excluded from

normalized ùëî(ùëñ) to ensure that ‚àë#1

profile likelihood (Pawitan 2013). The optimization of likelihood function was done by the nloptr

In this paper, the selective advantage of the B.1.1.7 strain over non-B.1.1.7 strains in England was
estimated to be 0.337 with a 95% CI from 0.336 to 0.339. The date of emergence of B.1.1.7 strains in
England was estimated to be September 20, 2020 with its 95% confidence interval from September 17,
2020 to September 20, 2020. The initial frequency of B.1.1.7 among all sequences except B.1.1.7-like
strains at the time of emergence in England was estimated to be 0.00574 with its 95% confidence
intervals from 0.00443 to 0.00618.
The estimated selective advantage of 0.337 indicates that the B.1.1.7 strain has 33.7% higher
instantaneous reproduction numbers than those of previously circulating strains in England. This means
that control measures for the B.1.1.7 strain needed to be strengthened by 33.7% compared to that for the
previously circulating strains. To get the same control effect as for the previously circulating strains, the

Our estimation method is based on the principle that the expected frequency of a mutant strain among all
strains can be determined from those in the previous generation using the serial interval distribution of
infections. The method assumes that the selective advantage of a mutant strain over previously circulating
strains is constant over time, which is based on Maynard Smith‚Äôs model of allele frequencies in adaptive
evolution. Based on Fraser‚Äôs method for estimating the instantaneous reproduction number, our method
allows reproduction numbers of strains to change during the target period of analysis. Thus, the proposed
method removes the assumption that the reproduction number is constant over time, which is assumed in
previous studies. Our method can estimate selective advantage of viruses in a genotype over the other
genotype without estimating the reproduction numbers of viruses of each genotype. Thus the method can
be applicable for the analysis on the selection of new variants even when strong control measures such as
lockdown were introduced during the target period of analysis. We think this is the largest contribution of
this paper to the field of molecular evolution, population genetics, and infectious disease epidemiology.
The selective advantage estimated in this study relies on the serial interval distribution, and thus the
results may change depending on the serial interval distribution used in the analysis. In this paper, we
used the serial interval distribution estimated by Nishiura et al. (Nishiura et al., 2020). The distribution is
a lognormal distribution with a mean serial interval of 4.7 days with a standard deviation of 2.9 days.
Several groups have estimated the serial intervals of SARS-CoV-2 using different datasets. Some
variations are observed among these estimated values (Rai et al. 2021). Volz et al. (Volz et al. 2021)
assumes a fixed serial interval of 6.5 days based on the results by Bi et al. (Bi et al., 2020). However, Ali
et al. have reported that the serial interval estimated using data from China before January 22, 2020 was
longer than estimates after January 22, 2020 (Ali et al., 2020). The serial interval estimated by Bi et al.
contains data before January 22, 2020 and there might be some possibility that the estimated serial
interval does not reflect the current situation. This important limitation will be removed when the serial
interval distributions is analyzed using a large dataset of COVID-19 transmissions in the world.
As of March 17, 2021, the B.1.1.7 strain has been observed in 93 countries (Rambaut, Holmes, et al.,
2020). The selective advantage of the B.1.1.7 strains over previously circulating strains in other countries
remains to be our future work. Variant strains originated in Brazil and South Africa also show higher
transmissibility than previously circulating strains (World Health Organization 2021). There is an urgent
need to estimate the selective advantage of these strains over previously circulating strains. We hope that
the methodology developed in this paper provides important information for countries in the world to
establish control measures against highly transmissible variants strains such as the B.1.1.7 strain.
