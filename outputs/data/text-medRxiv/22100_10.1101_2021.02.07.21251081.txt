Abstract
INTRODUCTION
The Coronavirus pandemic has hit the world with its vast contagiousness, high morbidity, and mortality.
Apart from the direct damage to the lung tissue, the corona virus infection is able to predispose patients
to thrombotic disease, thus causing cerebral or coronary incidents.
AIMS
The aim of this study was to find a clinical or laboratory parameter, that would help in distinguishing
between COVID-19 patients with myocardial infarction (MI), who have an infarct-related artery (IRA) and
therefore, require immediate revascularization, and those, who have no IRA.
METHODS
This was a single-center, observational study of 10 consecutive patients with COVID-19, who were
admitted with confirmed MI.
RESULTS
In our study group the mean age was 67.5 ± 8.3 years, half of the patients were female; all of them had
arterial hypertension; 8 patients (80%) had dyslipidemy; 4 (40%) had diabetes. 30% of the patients with
MI did not have an IRA, and did not require pPCI. Patients with MI and IRA had significantly higher hsTrI
values (48.9 ± 43.2 vs 0.6 ± 0.7, p=0.007) and exclusively typical chest pain 100% vs 0%, p=0.007),
compared to patients with MI without an IRA. The ECG changes had only marginal statistical significance.
Our results suggest that using a higher cut-off value for hsTrI (>7.5 times upper reference range)
increases the specificity and positive predictive value for diagnosing a MI with the presence of IRA and
need for pPCI, to 100%
CONCLUSION
In our analysis we confirm that a higher cut-off value for hsTrI helps distinguish between COVID patients
with MI, who have IRA and therefore, require immediate revascularization, compared to those, who have
no IRA.

INTRODUCTION
The coronavirus pandemic has hit the world with its vast contagiousness, high morbidity, and mortality
[1]. Apart from the direct damage to the lung tissue, the corona virus infection is associated with
multiple organ damage, including the heart. Emerging evidence reveals a direct correlation between
COVID-19 and cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure, myocarditis, arrhythmias, conduction
abnormalities and acute coronary syndromes [2]. The SARS-CoV-2 infection can frequently induce
coagulation abnormalities that are associated with cardiopulmonary deterioration and death as a
possible complication in all patients, despite presence or absence of concomitant risk factors and
diseases. In addition, many patients with severe COVID-19 undergo thromboembolic events, which seem
to be related to this particular coagulopathy [3][4]. One of the most unpleasant and life-threatening
types of thromboembolism is the one involving the coronary circulation, thus causing a heart attack.
Many additional problems arise due to this condition e.g., access to a Cath lab, exposure of additional
medical personnel, more complications and increased mortality for the patients.
Invasive angiography for COVID-19 patients is logistically challenging and, in some cases, there is no
intervention target, since microcirculatory disease and thrombosis is common in this group. Therefore,
we studied in detail the case series of 10 patients referred for primary percutaneous coronary
intervention (pPCI) for MI in our catheterization laboratory during the course of COVID-19 infection [5].
And we set ourselves the purpose to evaluate if there are some factors or parameters that could predict
the presence of an interventional target – infarct related artery (IRA), prior to catheterization, and to
determine their sensitivity and specificity.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The COVID-19 department of Heart & Brain University Hospital, Pleven, Bulgaria, functions since
11.2020, with 64 beds, 24 of which are intensive with the option for mechanical ventilation. For the last
two months of 2020, 214 patients were treated in our COVID-19 department. Ten of them were referred
to the catheterization laboratory for selective coronary angiography with myocardial infarction (MI),
defined by the third universal definition of MI [6]. Most of our patients were directed to our hospital
with ACS as their diagnosis, while others developed ACS during their stay in the COVID department and
were therefore brought to the Cath lab. During the procedure, appropriate personal protective
equipment (PPE) is worn by the medical personnel, including a sterile gown, gloves, goggles and a N95
mask. The patient is brought to the Cath lab trough a different one-way corridor, in order to reduce
chances of infection. The angiography includes a standard set of diagnostic and guiding catheters, mainly

EBU 3.5/6Fr for the left coronary artery, and JR3.5 for the right, coronary guidewires, drug eluting stents
and balloons. The majority of the catheterization laboratories have either normal or positive ventilation
systems and are not designed to contain an infectious environment. Therefore, catheterization
laboratories will require a thorough disinfection following every procedure, leading to delays for the
scheduled procedures.
Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS statistical software for Windows version 19.0. The
distribution of continuous variables was tested using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Normally distributed
data were presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD), whereas non-normally distributed data – as
median and interquartile range (IQR) (the difference between the 25th and 75th percentile). Categorical
variables were presented in percentage terms. We compared differences between groups with
Independent-Samples T-Test. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV and
NPV) were calculated according to the true positive (TP), false positive (FP), true negative (TN) and false
negative (FN) results, using the following formulas: Sensitivity = TP/(TP+FN); Specificity = TN/(TN+FP);
PPV = TP/(TP+FP); NPV = TN/(TN+FN). A two-tailed p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Ethics
All patients signed an informed consent for coronary angiography and PCI, and for personal data
analysis. The study protocol is in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

RESULTS
Mean age in our group was 67.5 ± 8.3 years; half of the patients were female; all patients had arterial
hypertension; 8 patients (80%) had dyslipidemy; 4 (40%) had diabetes. On admission all patients had
chest pain [typical in 7 (70%), atypical in 2 (20%) and non-stenocardic in 1 (10%)] and an increase in
serum level of high-sensitive Troponin I (hsTrI).
Five of the patients (50%) had ST segment elevation, typical for ST elevation myocardial infarction
(STEMI); one person (10%) had a new onset left bundle branch block (LBBB); 1 (10%) had significant ST
depression and 3 (30%) had no significant ECG changes.
Three of the patients (30%) had heart failure symptoms on admission. Before developing symptoms and
signs of MI, most of the patients (6 – 60%) were hospitalized and treated for COVID-19 at our COVIDdepartment, 2 (20%) were referred from other hospitals with COVID-departments, and 2 (20%) were
referred from emergency care units after being treated for COVID-19 at home. The mean hospital stay
before the acute coronary syndrome (ACS) was 11.3 ± 10.8 days; 2 patients were in Intensive care unit
(ICU) and they were on mechanical ventilation. All but one person in our group were discharged alive.
After coronary angiography, we found that 7 patients (70%) had an infarct related artery / lesion (IRA)
and they underwent pPCI. The other 3 (30%) did not have an IRA, pPCI was not performed, and the
diagnosis of myocardial infarction with no obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) was made, most
probably due to myocarditis.

Comparing the patients with IRA to those without we found that the subjects who finally required pPCI
had significantly higher hsTRI values, exclusively had typical chest pain (7 out of 7 patients with IRA had
typical chest pain, while the other three without IRA had an atypical or non-stenocardic chest pain, with
significant difference between the groups regarding characteristics of chest pain: p=0.007), and had
more often ST elevation (5 out of 7 patients with IRA had ST elevation, 1 had new LBB and 1 had no ECG
changes, while 1 out of 3 patients without IRA had ST depression and 2 had no ECG changes, with a
borderline significance between the groups regarding ST segment changes: p=0.05). The other studied
variables did not differ significantly between the groups with or without IRA – table 1.

Regarding hsTrI concentrations [the upper reference limit (URL) in our laboratory is 0.2 ng/ml], all but
one patient with IRA and pPCI had hsTrI >1.5 ng/ml (>7.5 times URL), and all patients without IRA and
pPCI had hsTrI ≤1.5 ng/ml (≤7.5 times URLN). Therefore, for hsTrI >1.5 ng/ml (>7.5 times URL) to predict
the presence of IRA and the need for pPCI the sensitivity is 86%, the specificity is 100%, positive
predictive value (PPV) is 100%, while the negative predictive value (NPV) is 10%.

Myocardial infarction, defined by the third universal definition of MI, could complicate up to 5% of
COVID-19 cases. In our study group, 30% of the patients with MI did not have an IRA and, consequently,
did not need a coronary intervention. Patients with MI and IRA had significantly higher hsTrI values and
exclusively typical chest pain, compared to patients with MI but without an IRA, whose hsTrI values were
lower and chest pain was atypical or non-stenocardic. ECG changes had only a minor statistical
significance for distinguishing between MI patients with or without IRA. Our results suggest that using a
higher cut-off value for hsTrI increases the specificity for diagnosing a MI and therefore - interventional
treatment.
According to the third universal definition of myocardial infarction the diagnosis requires evidence of
myocardial necrosis in a clinical setting consistent with acute myocardial ischemia. These criteria require
detection of a rise and/or fall in cardiac biomarker levels (preferably cardiac troponin) with at least one
value above the 99th percentile upper reference limit, with at least one of the following: symptoms of
myocardial ischemia, new or presumed new significant ST-segment T-wave changes or new left bundle
branch block, development of pathological Q-waves on the ECG, imaging evidence of loss of viable
myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality or identification of intracoronary thrombus by
angiography or autopsy.
This universal definition of MI, however, might not be the optimal guide to send a patient to the
catheterization laboratory in the setting of procoagulation abnormalities in the course of acute or postacute COVID-19.
The range of clinical responses to COVID-19 is extremely broad. Endothelial injury is an underlying
mechanism that links the inflammation and consequent thrombosis [7], [8]. It is currently hypothesized
that ACE-2 receptor is the entry gate for the virus to invade and infect tissues. The vascular endothelium
appears to be targeted directly by the virus as ACE-2 is expressed widely in the blood vessels and the
heart. The result is exocytosis of endothelial granules containing VWF (von Willebrand factor), P-selectin,
and other proinflammatory cytokines, which mediate platelets adhesion, aggregation, and leukocyte
adherence to the vessel wall, with a final result of intravascular thrombosis [9].
Even though our analysis is on a small number of patients, similar incidence of arterial (coronary and
cerebral) thrombosis (4%) has been described by other authors. In this study, however, the authors have
not provided a guide to the right moment of interventional treatment. According to our published data
search, we were not able to find another study, analyzing the predictors for the presence of IRA and the
need for pPCI in COVID-19 MI patients.
CONCLUSION
In our analysis we confirm that a higher cut-off value for hsTrI helps distinguish between COVID patients
with ACS, who have IRA and therefore, require immediate revascularization, compared to those, who
have no IRA.
