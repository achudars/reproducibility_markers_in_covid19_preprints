ABSTRACT
The disease burden of SARS-CoV-2 as measured by tests from various countries present varying
estimates of infection and fatality rates. Models based on these acquired data may suffer from
systematic errors and large estimation variances due to the biases associated with testing and lags
between the infection and death counts. Here, we present an augmented compartment model to
predict epidemic dynamics while explicitly modeling for the sampling bias involved in testing.
Our simulations show that sampling biases in favor of patients with higher disease manifestation
could significantly affect direct estimates of infection and fatality rates calculated from the
numbers of confirmed cases and deaths, and serological testing can partially mitigate these biased
estimates. We further recommend a strategy to obtain unbiased estimates, calculating the
dependence of expected confidence on a randomized sample size, showing that relatively small
sample sizes can provide statistically significant estimates for SARS-CoV-2 related death rates.

INTRODUCTION
The spread of SARS-CoV-2 across the world has led to a significant disease burden with
widespread health impact. While the search for a vaccine or a successful pharmaceutical agent
continues, non-pharmaceutical interventions have been the only currently available recourse.
Planning and implementing such interventions is intimately connected with epidemiological
disease modeling and requires the estimation of key metrics such as the speed of infection spread,
recovery and fatality rates, and kinetics related to the persistence or loss of acquired immunity.
Early reports from the World Health Organization (WHO) stated a case fatality rate of over 3.8%1
for SARS-COV-2 as it was first detected in Wuhan, China and spread across the world.
Subsequently, epidemiological modeling and projection, with its inherent estimation of infection,
recovery, and fatality rates has become central to various institutional actors dealing with the
management of epidemic. These studies and reports are, by necessity, ultimately based on
reported numbers from tested patients, which were sampled by public health agencies in the
countries where virus had started spreading2-4. However, there are wide differences across

countries in the number of people who were tested, the availability of test kits, as well as the
stratification of the population that were tested. With this criteria, the presentation of infection,
recovery, and case fatality rate (CFR) based on current SARS-CoV-2 data is difficult to interpret 24, masking the true extent and dynamics of the disease spread and ensuing fatality.
We were among the first to raise concerns regarding the accuracy of determined fatality rates
based on two potentially important issues5,6. These issues deserve the attention of the scientific
community involved in understanding the spread of the pandemic. One of these is the underlying
spread of immunity. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the commonly
employed method to confirm the presence of SARS-COV-2, only informs about the live status of
the virus in the population, and therefore may mask the percentage of people who contracted the
virus and subsequently resolved the infection by acquired immunity7, if the disease has spread
more than our current estimates suggest. SARS-COV-2 is known to induce a detectable antibody
response following few days of infection7,8. An initial report suggested that a larger cohort of
tested populations which were negative for an active viral load can now be regarded as having
previously contracted the virus9, but the effect size found was smaller than could be statistically
determined from error rate of the underlying test, besides concerns about the sampling bias
during recruitment of the subjects. . Serological testing using a better study design by other
researchers or public health agencies will not only shed more light on the true prevalence of
COVID-19 resistance, but subsequent follow up of any COVID-19 immune individuals found
therein will also answer very critical questions on the nature and persistence of COVID-19
immunity in the general population. Without sufficient attention to these questions, it will not be
possible to model the chances of subsequent waves of COVID-19 spread in the future with much
confidence. This in turn has grave implications for public health capacity planning and
intervention decisions beyond the next few months.
Secondly, we highlight the bias within the sampling (testing for SARS-CoV-2 presence), which
could potentially alter the estimates of both the infection and fatality rates. There have been
multiple mathematical studies modeling the kinetics of disease spreading with and without social
distancing interventions10. However, these are dependent on model parameters estimated from
limited, and likely biased and non-uniform sampling, as indicated by large differences across
countries in the rate of fatalities. The data collected across countries were collated for the objective
of public health operations, identifying infected individuals and tracing their contacts etc., and
for preparation of adequate health facilities. However, these approaches may introduce bias in
testing for individuals presenting with symptoms, rendering models built on these data
vulnerable to systematic sampling bias. This raises significant concerns regarding the accuracy
of the estimates of fatality and morbidity rates, with far reaching consequences on capacity
planning and policy making.
In this work, we present a new model to predict the dynamics of disease spread by augmenting
the commonly employed SIRD compartment model by stratifying the infected population and
introducing bias in their sampling. We show that biases within testing could have a significant

effect on the estimation of the infection and fatality rates. We also accounted for testing by
serological means and found that estimation of acquired immunity could partially mitigate the
effect of testing biases. We also demonstrate that because death counts lag the infection rate, case
fatality rates may underestimate the infection fatality rates.
However, large variance within the estimation of infection, as well as fatality suggested a strong
need to determine the effect of bias within sampling itself. As the countries have introduced
substantial social distancing, it has become difficult to predict if the disease has spread widely, or
only in limited population niches. In which case the high estimation of fatality rates from
positively tested patients in certain countries could either mean a high true fatality rate, or a high
sampling bias wherein the more symptomatic patients with an enhanced likelihood of mortality
are tested. Both these scenarios are theoretically plausible, and it is essential to estimate the true
fatality rates associated with the epidemic to mount an appropriate response, or for an informed
preparation11. Indeed, these numbers vary widely across different countries, resulting in large
variations in suggested mortality rates11. In practice, kinetic models used to project the epidemic
spread attempt to mitigate or sidestep the effects of sampling bias by various methods. Verity et
al. give estimates for the infection fatality rates based on testing of foreign nationals repatriated
from China12. While this sample may not have been directly biased with symptom severity, it is
still likely to be highly correlated to age, health, and placement within social and physical contact
networks, and therefore indirectly correlated with infection status and susceptibility to fatality.
Other methods may fit on reported deaths, which are less likely to suffer from sampling bias, but
could miss untested fatalities. We therefore propose that an unbiased randomly sampled testing
study in a region with high fatality presents the best course to estimate the true fatality rates. Our
calculations indicate that a reasonable unbiased testing sample can provide high confidence data
to test the hypotheses of different fatality rates.
Together with our augmented compartmental model, our proposed scheme presents a coherent,
statistically rigorous estimation method to determine infection and fatality rates, which is both
cognizant of the testing bias in favor of the more symptomatic or severe patients, and given
sufficient follow-up time, resistant to the underestimation bias due to lagging death counts.

RESULTS
An Augmented Compartment Model to Estimate Epidemic Dynamics Incorporating
Testing Bias
We considered an augmentation of the currently prevalent models of epidemic dynamics
to explicitly model the potential sampling bias within the tested populations for the
specific disease, thus enabling the modeling of reported case numbers and the effects of
different testing strategies. In the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, this sampling bias is
potentially large because data from different countries present very different fatality rates
(Figure 1A). Indeed, directly measured case fatality rates (CFR) was proportional to how

biased the sampling of positive tests were in each country (number of positive cases
found per unit test conducted) (Figure 1A). We therefore attempted to incorporate biases
involved in the stratification of populations tested for the active viral load, with an
objective to study the effect of sample bias in the reported case numbers and any
subsequent direct estimates of infection and fatality rate dynamics.
The most common model used to study epidemic dynamics is the SIRD compartment
model, from which many derivatives have been designed. We decided to choose the
simplest SIRD model to test whether testing bias could have an effect in the estimate of
patients belonging to a given compartment. The basic SIRD compartmental model
stratifies the population in 4 compartments: Susceptible (S), Infected (I), Recovered (R),
and Dead (D). Movements of subpopulations from one compartment to the other are
described by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The parameters for each of these
ODEs are the rate constants, β, describing the rate of infection, and γ, describing the rate
of death (Figure 1B).
In various countries, the initial tests for viral presence have been biased based on the
severity of the disease manifestation, or weighted towards symptomatic patients.
However, in certain situations, these biases could be present in other directions too,
wherein patients with more likelihood of death are under-sampled. We therefore decided
to introduce testing bias by stratifying the infected population based on the severity of
disease manifestation. Specifically, we further stratified the infected compartment (I) into
two other sub-compartments, H (high) and L (low) referring to the high or low
symptomatic manifestation of the disease respectively. Although the transition from the
S (susceptible) compartment to the infected (I) is driven by rate constant β, the factor q
describes the fraction of the infected subpopulation manifesting a high symptomatic
manifestation of the disease. We assumed that the fraction within L (low manifestation)
die in miniscule rates, and nearly all deaths occur from the H fraction. This added subcompartmentalization is a simple addition to the model, but we believe that if welldefined stratification could be measurably identified within the infected (I) compartment,
more subcompartments should be added. These fractions could include people with
known co-morbidities with a higher chance of fatality, or those with measurably high
severity of disease manifestation.
We then superimposed upon our augmented compartment model a testing policy
(Figure 1C). We assumed that T tests are available per unit time (kept constant for
simulations below, but which could itself be a time varying function based on the

availability of testing capabilities over time). The untested, and alive individuals are
assumed to be randomly selected for testing in proportion to their numbers, but those
with high disease manifestation (H) are selected with an increased bias b. In addition,
patients who were tested as being negative for viral load at a previous time point, but
presenting severe symptoms at the present time would also be selected with an increased
bias b. The biased testing policy was implemented by splitting the compartments in our
augmented SIRD model for the untested and the tested fractions (Figure 1D). True death
rate would depend upon the factors q (fraction with high disease manifestation), and f
(fraction dying within the H compartment) (Figure 1E). Details for the ODEs describing
the transition through these compartments are provided in the Methods section.
Testing Bias Strongly Affects the Direct Estimation of Infection Rate
We simulated our augmented compartmental model with testing bias and calculated the
infection rate dynamics based on an active viral test (based on measurement of viral
sequences), as well as based on a serological test (measuring if antibodies against the
virus have been created). In our augmented model, the estimated infection rate is
calculated as a ratio of those tested positive, and all tested population within a given time
frame. Here, the testing bias is reflected within the sampling of stratified populations, H
and L in the infected (I) compartment.
Assuming no errors within the tests (sequence based, or serological), we found that
testing bias had a profound effect on the naïve estimation of infection rate based on active
viral test, the most commonly employed tests (Figure 2A). In contrast, estimation of the
contraction rate was much less affected by the bias, largely because the immunologically
recovered population as a fraction increases as time progresses (Figure 2B). Our
simulation provides a strong argument in favor of serological testing beyond the obvious
argument of their capability to correctly assign the compartment of recovered (R) fraction
to the population which contracts the disease but tests negative. That the testing bias
could be substantially mitigated in the estimation of contraction rate by serological test is
a strong argument in favor of serological testing, although these tests are unlikely to be
available in the initial spread of the epidemic. Nevertheless, our augmented model will
allow estimation of the effect of biased sampling itself in predicting disease dynamics,
and underlines the importance of unbiased sampling to predict estimates reflecting
reality.
Testing Bias Influence True Fatality Rates and Case Fatality Rates in Time-Dependent
Manner

Since the initial report of case fatality rate of 3.8% from Wuhan China by WHO, there has
been a substantial variance in the listed death rate among nations. Case fatality rate is
calculated as the ratio of number of deaths measured and number of positive cases2. Since
death is a lag indicator, case fatality rate would asymptotically reach the more
conservative death rate, which is the ratio of deaths and a sum of those who died or
recovered. We, therefore, considered the latter death rate and tested the effect of sampling
bias upon its estimation. We found that sampling bias can linearly affect the estimation
of death rate (Figure 3A). If the fraction of population with high manifestation of disease
is high (and therefore the inherent bias of sampling is low), then trivially the effect of bias
is somewhat mitigated (Figure 3B). Our data strongly underlines the importance of
incorporating bias in testing itself as a key parameter to model epidemic dynamics,
because key predicted metrics, including death rate, are substantially affected by these
biases.
We then tested how testing bias would affect the case fatality rate (ratio of dead to the
number of positive cases). We found that sampling bias indeed resulted in large effects
in CFR estimates, but crucially, these effects reduce as the infection reaches its peak, and
then amplify as the infections subside within the population (Figure 3C). When
compared to the true death rate, CFR initially underestimates the death rate, and then
overestimates the rate in a bias dependent manner. CFR, as is calculated here, has two
opposing biases inherent in it. In the initial part of the pandemic, and for testing biases
below a threshold, it underestimates the true death rate because the growth of the
infections happens earlier than the growth in the number of death. In other words, while
the pandemic is growing, the number of deaths always lag, and the number of infections
at a particular time are some multiplicative factor larger than the corresponding
infections that existed when the currently dead were infected. This leads to estimation of
an overly optimistic CFR. On the other hand, for later and waning stages of the epidemic,
and the testing biases being greater than a threshold, the CFR leads to an overly
pessimistic number compared to the real death rate. This is due to a greater prevalence
of the severely ill patients counted among the cases. Indeed, if the fraction of population
with a high disease manifestation (H) are changed and correspondingly the death rate
adjusted to keep the true death rate the same, then CFR can underestimate the true death
rate for a longer duration of the pandemic (Figure 3D). The direction of the bias in the
CFR depends on the pandemic kinetics (β, γ) and the testing bias.
However, if CFR were to be measured using serological tests, thereby counting the
recovered population as being previously infected, the effect of bias on estimation of

fatality rate is mitigated (Figure 3E-F). Crucially, our calculations argue that for all
metrics of naïve estimation of fatality rates, contribution of testing bias is substantial, and
attempts made to measure the bias itself, and be accounted for.
Randomized Unbiased Serological Sampling of Widely Infected Population is
Necessary to Determine True Fatality Rates
Our augmented model demonstrated that sampling bias could play a significant role in the direct
estimates of both the infection and the fatality rates, and may partially explain the large variance
across the death rates reported across countries, as well as in epidemic prediction models. We
therefore propose that a random sampling of a population that has suffered a large infection load
should be utilized to estimate the true infection, recovery, and fatality rates. In addition, as
serological tests are becoming available to detect the antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 specific
antigen, it is possible to identify individuals who have developed immunity against the virus but
may not necessarily test positive owing to reduced viral load. We believe it is necessary to test if
the wider population in an area with high death numbers is a consequence of (i) a wider spread
of the disease and a smaller death rate, or (ii) a larger death rate in a smaller subpopulation that
has contracted the virus. In order to minimize the variance of the infection death rate, this random
testing is suggested to be conducted among a population wherein the infection is understood to
have spread widely.
We propose using census, tax ID, or driving licenses in a given area as an unbiased identifier of
a sampling set, upon which the serological test and PCR (or pooled next generation sequencingNGS based tests) could be conducted. We calculated the sample sizes required to gain an accurate
estimate of the community infection rates and the infection fatality rates. A random selection of
individuals will provide estimates without systematic biases; therefore, the appropriate measure
of accuracy need only be concerned with the variance of the estimates. In the following, we have
chosen to frame this in terms of mostly confidence intervals and hypothesis testing.
An initial calculation expectedly suggested that with low infection rates, attaining a 5% error of
estimation for the infection rate would require a moderate sample size. In contrast, if the real
infection rate is higher (closer to 50%), expectedly, a smaller sample set will be sufficient for an
accurate estimate of infection rate (Figure 4). Therefore, in the present scenario, an example of an
ideal location where such tests could be performed with a limited number of sample size
(approximately 10,000) is New York City, where the deaths have rapidly climbed up in the last
week of March 2020.

Estimating the mortality or infection fatality rate requires another probability to be multiplied to
the estimate of infection rate within a sample population. A calculation of the sample size
required for a 95% confidence interval indicates that even for a potentially highly infected

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.02.20088120; this version posted May 6, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

population, like in NYC, it may require a very large sample size to accurately determine the true
fatality rate (Figure 5A). This may be one reason why countries have resorted to large sampling
to obtain data for true fatality rate. However, biased and non-random sampling renders these
data difficult to interpret to estimate the fatality rates.
We therefore propose to instead test the hypotheses that the true fatality rate is higher than a
given value, which would be rejected if the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval is lower
than the said value. Calculating these sample sizes with the statistically significant 95%
confidence interval, we found that a relatively much smaller sample size would be sufficient to
estimate if the true fatality rate is below or higher than a given percentage (Figure 5B). Our
calculations indicate that for a sample with 50% infection rate, a sample size of 1,000 may be
sufficient to identify if fatalities are much lower than 1% , while for a sample with 25% infection
rate, it may be below 10,000 — a logistically achievable size to determine a crucial parameter.

Continuous Sampling of a Selected Cohort can Provide Useful Dynamics on
Acquirement of Immunity
The availability of a serological test, if applied using a random and unbiased sampling strategy
could allow the identification of a key subset of people who have developed immunity, but do
not carry the infectious disease burden. However, it is usually not possible to have antibody tests
available at the onset of a disease, and a rapidly spreading pandemic may make it difficult to gear
policies based on an accurate assessment of the development of herd immunity. In contrast, the
recent development of genomic amplification or sequencing technologies has made it possible to
prepare rapidly deployable tests to assess active infectious loads. We therefore propose to use a
continuous sampling of a representative unbiased cohort on a weekly basis to determine the
initial onset of infection, the rate of its spread, development of immunity, and eventually the
ensuing aftermath of the infection. Indeed, as we showed, for very small infection rate, a larger
sample may be required. However, this concern is easily addressable by pooled sequencing
(NGS), which can be used to determine rare onset, mutagenesis, and characterization of
infections13-15, and if sufficient signal for infection is found, then the continuous sampling be used
for that cohort. The dynamics of readout (of active viral load) in a fixed sample set will allow an
accurate estimation of the development of immunity and its dynamics in a given population.

DISCUSSION
The wide, and constantly updated, estimates of key metrics of the disease, including fatality and
recovery rates associated with SARS-COV-2 raise important questions about the quality of our
public health scientific inquiry. Additionally, the effects of the public health and economic
policies adopted around the world on the socio-economically and politically vulnerable sections
of the population has so far received insufficient attention. This is the most severe global health
crisis to have inflicted humanity within this generation, although its true impact has still not been

understood completely. Indeed, even after months of its spread, there is a large variation in the
estimate of infection, recovery, and fatality rates. Crucially, an accurate estimate of the true
dynamics and infection, recovery, and fatality rates is necessary for the scientific inquiry into the
disease from a systems perspective, operations planning and to advocate for an apt public health
policy. We show that direct estimates of these parameters lack in this respect methodologically.
Testing of the general population has been justifiably biased towards symptomatic patients, since
it is driven by the desire to identify, care for, or safely isolate vulnerable populations rather than
to estimate accurate metrics. This has resulted in the biased sampling that is not perfectly suited
for modeling of the epidemic and calculation of key metrics.
In this work, we attempted to systematically model this crucial issue by incorporating the testing
bias within the compartmental model of epidemic dynamics. Our model also includes tests for
active viral load, as well as for those who have developed immunity, along with the sampling
bias in testing. We believe that our proposed augmentation not only provides a systematic basis
to ascertain the effect of testing policies in estimates of epidemic dynamics, but also demonstrates
that biased sampling may substantially influence epidemic projections if metrics are naïvely
calculated only reported case numbers.
Another problem that we demonstrate with the directly calculated case fatality rates is that the
counts of deaths lag the infection rates, and therefore while the pandemic is growing, the case
fatality rates underestimate the infection fatality rates. While the bias introduced due to this lag
is in the opposite direction to that introduced by the sampling bias, the result only makes the
situation worse. In terms of statistical theory, the case fatality rate is a large variance, biased
estimate with an unknown direction of bias. Case fatality rate estimates calculated for countries
with proportionately very extensive testing such as Iceland have been optimistically cited as the
true infection fatality rates. However, as some sources of systematic errors are mitigated in
extensive testing, the effect of the lagging death counts will proportionately become more
important. Therefore, until we arrive towards the end of the pandemic, these optimistic case
fatality rates may be more optimistic than the reality.
Although much data is collected on the number of cases, the ensuing deaths, and those that have
recovered, the naïve interpretation of fatality and infection rates from non-uniform data across
countries may be fraught with substantial inherent problems. Therefore, we recommend a
limited, unbiased, random uniform sampling of population to test hypotheses of fatality rates.
We also propose a method to continually monitor a static sample set to estimate the onset, and
dynamics of disease spread, acquired immunity, and ensuing morbidity and fatalities associated
with an infectious spread. As a recent example, a large number of deaths in New York City could
be explained either by (i) a high fatality rate in a small population contracting the virus, or (ii) a
rapid spread of the virus which has resulted in large number of people to develop immunity with
a smaller percentage succumbing to the viral infection. In order to distinguish between the two
widely varying scenarios, the most direct method with the least amount of statistical
assumptions, would be to serologically test a limited, random sample of individuals. This should

occur in addition to any surveillance methods currently being employed that are independently
needed for targeted medical care and public health interventions.

METHODS
SIRD model with disease stratification into high and low symptomatic populations
First, we augment the canonical SIRD model by stratifying the infected population into high (H)
and low (L) symptom populations. The differential equations for disease progression can be
written as

where 𝑆 stands for the susceptible population, 𝑅 for the recovered population, 𝐷 for dead, and
𝐻 + 𝐿 for the total infections. 𝛽 is, according to convention the infection rate constant, and 𝛾 the
recovery rate constant, 0 ≤ 𝑞 ≤ 1, is the fraction of infections that develop the 𝐻 manifestation of
the disease, and 0 ≤ 𝑓 ≤ 1 is the fraction of the 𝐻 disease population that dies from it.
Augmented SIRD model with testing
We go one step further that model the testing for the infection conducted as part of a surveillance
program, under the following assumptions:
1.

Both uninfected and infected individuals can be tested in a surveillance program, with different
probabilities.

2.

The amount of surveillance testing capacity is limited to 𝑇 tests per unit time (day).

3.

Uninfected people who are tested, and test negative aren’t tested again, unless they show significant
symptoms (𝐻) at some point later.

4.

Once an individual has tested positive, they are a confirmed case, and any further testing etc. as part
of the care program is not counted in this model since such testing will not change the confirmed case
numbers, and isn’t assumed to come from the surveillance testing capacity.

In total, we have the following states

Estimates of infection and death rates
Using the testing results, the conventional estimate of the infection rate as currently being
reported would simply be the fraction of positive test cases found in a time period
̂ Rate =
Infection

𝛥𝑇𝑝
,
𝛥𝑇𝑝 + 𝛥𝑇𝑛

and the cumulative death rate estimate would be the calculated from the number of people who
died from the pandemic versus those recovered
𝐷𝑇𝑝
.
𝐷𝑇𝑝 + 𝑅𝑇𝑝

̂Rate =
Death

The case fatality rate, as it is being currently being defined is
CFR =

𝐷𝑇𝑝
,
𝑇𝑝

which would change to
CFRSero =

𝐷𝑇𝑝
𝑇𝑝Sero

if we use serological testing.
Instead, the true infection rate in the population would simply be the fraction of the population
with any kind of infection
True Infection Rate =

𝐿+𝐻
,
𝑁

and the true death rate would be simply the total number of people who died of the disease versus
the total that died or recovered
True Death Rate =

𝐷

Calculating the variance of estimates for unbiased random sampling

Suppose the fraction of population that has contracted SARS-CoV-2 detectable by a serological
test (the infection rate) is 𝑝. In addition, assume that within those with SARS-CoV-2, a fraction 𝑚
have died or die within the study time-frame. Therefore, in sampling a random sample of 𝑆
samples, we expect to find 𝑆𝑝 positive cases, and 𝑆𝑝𝑚 deaths. In terms of the sampled numbers,
if we find 𝐶 positive cases out of a total 𝑆 sample size and 𝐷 deaths, the estimates of the infection
rate will be 𝑝 = 𝐶/𝑆 and the estimate of mortality rate 𝑚 = 𝐷/𝐶. These are unbiased estimates,
and their conservative, guaranteed confidence interval can be calculated from the ClopperPearson interval16.

disease symptoms respectively; The factor q is the fraction of infected within H; We assume that
high manifestation of disease leads to death in a fraction f of the individuals. (D) A simplified
representation of the model of the testing policy; T tests are available per unit time; Untested alive
individuals (U) are randomly selected in proportion to their numbers, but patients in H are
selected with an increased bias b. Further compartments arising due to testing and movement at
different stages are omitted here for clarity; Detailed equations in the Methods section. (E)
Fraction f and q determine the true death rate; Two values with similar death rates chosen for
simulations are marked.

disease manifestation at different fractions resulting in similar true death rates: (A) 5% of the
infected population with 15% death rate, and (B) 50% of the infected population with 2% death
rate; Red lines refer to true death rate and green-black lines refer to biased estimates of death
rates. (C-D) Estimates of case fatality rate (percentage of confirmed fatalities within positively
