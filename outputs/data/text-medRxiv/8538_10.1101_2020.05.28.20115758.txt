ABSTRACT

The COVID-19 pandemic caused by infection with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to more than 100,000 deaths in the United States. Several
studies have revealed that the hyper-inflammatory response induced by SARS-CoV-2 is a major
cause of disease severity and death in infected patients. However, predictive biomarkers of
pathogenic inflammation to help guide targetable immune pathways are critically lacking. We
implemented a rapid multiplex cytokine assay to measure serum IL-6, IL-8, TNF-a, and IL-1b in
hospitalized COVID-19 patients upon admission to the Mount Sinai Health System in New York.
Patients (n=1484) were followed up to 41 days (median 8 days) and clinical information, laboratory
test results and patient outcomes were collected. In 244 patients, cytokine measurements were
repeated over time, and effect of drugs could be assessed. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to
compare survival by cytokine strata, followed by Cox regression models to evaluate the
independent predictive value of baseline cytokines. We found that high serum IL-6, IL-8, and TNFa levels at the time of hospitalization were strong and independent predictors of patient survival.
Importantly, when adjusting for disease severity score, common laboratory inflammation markers,
hypoxia and other vitals, demographics, and a range of comorbidities, IL-6 and TNF-a serum
levels remained independent and significant predictors of disease severity and death. We propose
that serum IL-6 and TNF-a levels should be considered in the management and treatment of
COVID-19 patients to stratify prospective clinical trials, guide resource allocation and inform
therapeutic options. We also propose that patients with high IL-6 and TNF-a levels should be
assessed for combinatorial blockade of pathogenic inflammation in this disease.

INTRODUCTION:
As of late May 2020, COVID-19 disease, caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, has resulted
in more than 5,000,000 infections and 350,000 deaths worldwide. A recent study from hospitals
in New York City, the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, reported that of
2,634 patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 between March 1 and April 4 2020, 21% of
patients died1 which correlates with the outcomes of patients in the Mount Sinai Hospital System2.
There are currently no curative or preventive therapies for COVID-19, highlighting the need to
enhance current understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis for the rational development of
therapeutics.
Recent studies have suggested that in addition to direct viral damage, uncontrolled
inflammation contributes to disease severity in COVID-193,4. Consistent with this hypothesis, high
levels of inflammatory markers, including CRP, ferritin, D-dimer, high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte
ratio5-7 increased levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines5,7-9 have been observed in
patients with severe diseases. Pathogenic inflammation, also referred to as cytokine storm,
shares similarities with what was previously seen in patients infected with other severe
coronaviruses including SARS-CoV and MERs-CoV10 and bears similarities with the cytokine
release syndrome (CRS) observed in cancer patients treated with chimeric antigen receptor
modified T cells (CAR-T)11. Tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor inhibitor, is an FDA approved treatment
for CRS in patients receiving CAR-T cells12. A number of single center studies have used IL-6
inhibitors to treat COVID-19 patients with some clinical benefits13, and reported failures12. Beyond
IL-6, several cytokines have been shown to be elevated in CRS and to contribute to tissue
damage. TNF-a is important in nearly all acute inflammatory reactions, acting as an amplifier of
inflammation, and its blockade has been used to treat more than ten different autoimmune
inflammatory diseases, suggesting that TNF-a blockade may be an interesting therapeutic
approach to reduce organ damage in COVID-19 patients14. IL-1 is also a highly active proinflammatory cytokine and monotherapy blocking IL-1 activity is used to treat inflammatory
diseases including rheumatoid arthritis and inherited autoinflammatory syndromes such as
cryopyrin associated syndromes and has led to sustained reduction in disease severity15. IL-8 is
a potent proinflammatory cytokine playing a key role in the recruitment and activation of

neutrophils during inflammation16 and, given the frequent neutrophilia observed in patients
infected with SARS-CoV2, it is possible that IL-8 contributes to COVID 19 pathophysiology.
To mitigate inflammation caused by SARS-CoV-2, a frenzy of immunomodulatory agents
including small molecules and monoclonal antibodies targeting cytokines have rapidly been
entering into clinical trials3 and many such FDA-approved agents are already being used routinely
in the clinic in an off-label manner. Given the significant side effects associated with the use of
these agents, there is an urgent need to identify biomarkers that can accurately predict which
patients will decompensate due to an unchecked inflammatory response, and help guide rational
targeted immunomodulatory therapeutic strategies.
In this study, we asked whether inflammatory cytokine levels can help predict disease
course and outcome in COVID-19 patients. To enhance the relevance of the cytokine assays, we
focused on four pathogenic cytokines, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-a, and IL-1b, with clinically available drugs
to counteract them, and chose the ELLA microfluidics platform to rapidly measure them (within 3
hours), making these results potentially actionable.
We followed 1,484 patients hospitalized for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 at the
Mount Sinai Health System from the day of hospitalization to the day of discharge or death. We
measured serum IL-6, IL-8, TNF-a, and IL-1b levels upon admission and correlated these results
with clinical and laboratory markers of disease severity and with disease outcome. We found that
elevated IL-6 and TNF-a serum levels at presentation were strong predictors of disease severity
and survival independently of standard clinical biomarkers of disease severity, including
laboratory and clinical factors. These results suggest that multiplex cytokine profiling should be
used to stratify patients and guide resource allocation and prospective interventional studies.

RESULTS
Cohort characteristics and cytokine ranges
We obtained laboratory and clinical information as part of standard practice from 1,484
patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalized at the Mount Sinai
Hospital System in New York City between March 21 and April 28, 2020, under expedited IRB
approval. Using an emergency use approval from the New York State Department of Health, we

implemented the ELLA microfluidics soluble analyte test in the clinical laboratories to measure
four inflammatory cytokines known to contribute to pathogenic inflammation in CAR-T cell
associated CRS – IL-6, IL-8, TNF-a and IL-1b – and assessed their correlation with severity and
survival. Of the patients tested, 1,257 had a documented positive or presumptive positive SARSCoV-2 PCR test, while the remaining 167 could not be confirmed.
A total of 1953 specimens were analyzed to quantify circulating IL-6, IL-8, TNF-a and IL1b, serum levels using the ELLA rapid detection ELISA microfluidics platform (described in
Methods and in Supplemental Figure 1A-C). In most of the 1,484 patients accrued, samples were
collected once, typically upon admission to the hospital (median, 1.1 day; IQR, 0.7-2.6). A subset
of patients (n=244) had repeated cytokine measurements performed more than once after
admission, though for all prognostic analyses, only the first available test was used. For the entire
cohort, the median time available from first cytokine test to last follow-up (i.e., date of discharge,
date of death, or date still in hospital, whichever is latest) was 8 days (IQR, 2.9-14.7, up to 41
days). Patient characteristics are listed in Table 1. As reference, and to serve as control, cytokine
measurements were previously performed in healthy donors and in cancer patients who either
developed or did not develop CRS post-CAR-T cell therapies.
We found that IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-a were significantly elevated in COVID-19 serum
compared to healthy donor serum or plasma isolated from CAR-T cell treated patients with no
CRS (Figure 1). The four cytokines assessed had different detection ranges, with IL-6 having the
most dynamic profile, followed by IL-8, and TNF-a (Figure 1, Supplementary Figure 1D). In line
with previous reports, IL-1b levels were mostly low or at the limit of detection (even though controls
worked as expected, Supplementary Figure 1B). The vast majority of patients therefore presented
with elevated cytokines, or cytokine storm, but in contrast to the coordinated increase in cytokines
during CAR-T CRS (average Spearman r=0.6), cytokine levels were not as highly correlated with
each other in COVID-19 samples (average Spearman r=0.4), suggesting differential patterns of
cytokine expression and potentially distinct clinical presentations based on the relative profile of
each independent cytokine (Supplemental Figure 1E and 1F). Since >70% of samples analyzed
for each cytokine in COVID-19 fell within CRS range based on our post-CAR-T defined cutoffs,
and because we did not have an established cutoff for IL-1b, we decided to separate high vs. low
values using the median for each cytokine in COVID-19 patients. The median cutoffs for further
statistical analyses were >70 pg/mL for IL-6, >50 pg/mL for IL-8, >35 pg/mL for TNF, and >0.5
pg/mL for IL-1b.

Association with demographics and comorbidities
We used the first available cytokine measurement in each patient to measure correlations
with demographics and comorbidities. We hypothesized that cytokines are elevated in COVID-19
patients compared to healthy donors and non-CRS CAR-T treated patients due to SARS-CoV-2
infection. Of the 1,484 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 symptoms, 11.7% were negative for
SARS-CoV-2 by PCR and therefore were excluded from further univariate analyses. It should be
noted that there may have been false negative tests for SARS-CoV-2 viral detection based on
subsequent tests demonstrating antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 S spike protein in 3/5 SARS-Cov-2
PCR negative patients tested. Despite similar comorbidities, cytokine levels in this subset of
patients were significantly lower compared to patients that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2
infection (Figure 2A).
Men had higher levels of IL-6 than women, but no sex differences were observed for the
other three cytokines (Figure 2B). With increased age brackets (<50, 50-70, >70 years old), levels
of IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-a increased (Figure 2B) and the same was observed for age when
assessed as a continuous variable (not shown). There was no association of any cytokine
measured with body mass index, however, there is an increased prevalence of obesity in our
studied population. Smoking and race/ethnicity showed weak but significant univariate
associations with IL-6, IL-1b, and/or TNF-a which were not confirmed after adjusting for the other
covariates, except for IL-1b and TNF-a which remained significantly higher when comparing
Hispanics to African Americans.
We then assessed whether cytokine levels were associated with co-morbidities listed in
Table 1. We found that TNF-a and IL-8 were significantly increased in patients with chronic kidney
disease (CKD), diabetes, and hypertension, while TNF-a was also increased in those with
congestive heart failure, based on univariate analyses. IL-6 and IL-8 were elevated in patients
with a history of atrial fibrillation. No associations were found between cytokines and active cancer,
asthma, COPD, HIV, and sleep apnea (not shown).
Using multivariable regression models, we confirmed that CKD was the only comorbidity
significantly associated with elevated cytokine levels, while elevated TNF-a in patients with
diabetes and hypertension were explained by other variables. From demographics, age and sex
(for IL-6) remained significantly associated with cytokine levels as seen in univariate analyses.
Therefore, we included demographics and comorbidities as confounding variables in subsequent
analyses. Time to ELLA testing from time of hospital admission did not impact the cytokine levels,
meaning whether patients were tested for cytokines immediately upon admission or later (as will

be discussed in the longitudinal follow-up section) did not impact the level of cytokines. Therefore,
this time difference was not considered as a potential confounder.
Association between cytokines and risk of death
Next, we considered factors affecting survival defined as time to death and censored
regardless of cytokines in the overall cohort with univariate Kaplan-Meier analyses. We found that
only age and CKD were significantly associated with increased risk of death from COVID-19. We
evaluated whether cytokines could distinguish patients based on overall survival and disease
severity after COVID-19 hospitalization. Stratifying patients by cytokine levels of high vs. low using
the cutoffs described in the statistical analysis section, we found that each cytokine could predict
the overall survival of patients, based on the first available measurement following hospital
admission. Each cytokine was independently predictive of overall survival, after adjusting for
demographics and comorbidities, i.e., sex, age, race/ethnicity, smoking, CKD, hypertension,
asthma, congestive heart failure (Figure 3).
When considering all cytokines together in the model, for their relative independence, all
but IL-1b remained significant, even after adjustment for demographics and comorbidities. This
confirmed the relative independence of each cytokine tested, with only age (50-70 vs. >70, HR
0.55 [0.42-0.72]; <50 vs. >70: 0.24 [0.15-0.41]), IL-6 (HR 2.27 [1.65-3.12], IL-8 (HR 1.48 [1.111.97]), and TNF-a (HR 1.50 [1.10-2.05]) remaining significantly associated with decreased
survival after adjustments (respectively p<0.0001, p<0.0001, p=0.0076, p=0.0105). As additional
validation, we also performed this analysis using a competing risk model, in which patients
discharged alive were considered competing events and patients in hospital were censored, and
found the same conclusion, where high IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-a remained significantly associated
with worse outcome regardless of demographics and comorbidities (not shown). We used the
competing risk model in the next analysis,
Using cytokines to complement risk stratification
Next, we asked whether cytokines were of value for risk stratification and survival,
independently of known laboratory and clinical severity metrics (i.e., temperature, O2 saturation,
respiratory rate, severity score as defined in Methods). We first tested whether the 4 tested
cytokine levels were associated with known inflammation markers CRP, D-dimer, and ferritin, and
found strong correlations in all cytokine with each measurement, with IL-6 and IL-1b additionally
associated with fever (Figure 4A). In addition, IL-6 and IL-8 levels were closely correlated with
severity scale, which takes into account lung imaging and use of ventilation and end organ

damage, while TNF-a did not distinguish moderate vs. severe COVID-19 presentation, but instead
was only increased with end organ damage. Looking at the predictive value of cytokines on
survival after adjusting for levels of CRP, D-dimer, ferritin, and all comorbidities, IL-6 and IL-8
remained independently predictive of survival, therefore showing additive value to these known
markers (not shown). However, when including additional severity metrics, severity scoring, IL-8
was no longer independent from other variables, likely because it was eclipsed by stronger
measurements which follows a similar pattern (Supplementary Table S1). We then investigated
correlations of cytokines with an additional series of well-established markers of inflammation,
renal function, myocardial strain, and respiratory distress for their impact on survival within this
cohort. Using unsupervised analyses, neutrophils, white blood cells, CRP, ferritin, D-dimer, LDH,
and low O2 saturation were co-clustering with all cytokines except TNF-a, which was more closely
correlated with markers of tissue damage like creatinine (Supplementary Figure 2). Selecting the
most informative variables using a backward elimination process to define each of the available
measurements to be used as confounding factors in a competing risk regression analysis of
survival along with the cytokines, we found severity score, O2 saturation, platelets, low albumin,
systolic blood pressure, D-dimer, albumin, calcium, chloride, and platelet count remaining.
Remarkably, even when using these measurements as variables to adjust when assessing the
predictive value of cytokines on survival in the competing risk regression analysis, we found that
IL-6 and TNF-a remained significantly associated with a worse prognosis (Figure 4B). Therefore,
we conclude that IL-6 and TNF-a are independently predictive of patient outcomes in terms of
both disease severity and survival (Supplementary Table S2). Even after stratifying for risk factors
with the strongest p value, i.e., severity score, O2 saturation, and age, IL-6 and TNF-a remained
independently predictive of survival (Figure 4C and Supplementary Table S3).
Effect of medication and treatment on cytokine levels
Although our data does not demonstrate a causative role for IL-6 and TNF-a on disease
outcome, we wanted to shed light on the effect of various treatments on measured cytokines, as
potential mitigation strategies should there be a pathogenic effect from these inflammatory agents.
From a subset of 244 patients with more than one ELLA cytokine assay performed, and by
mapping time from treatment start to first ELLA test, we were able to assess the effect of various
treatments and experimental drugs on cytokine levels (Figure 5). Interestingly, off-label treatment
with the anti-IL-6R monoclonal antibody tocilizumab, which was given in a subset of patients with
progressive respiratory failure with marked systemic inflammation, showed that patients who
received this drug started with elevated IL-6 levels, and then had a transient increase in serum

IL-6, which has previously been explained by disrupted clearance following drug saturation of the
IL-6 receptor17. This transient elevation was only observed for IL-6, not IL-8, while TNF-a
appeared gradually decrease following therapy. Other treatments such as corticosteroids and
remdesivir showed, respectively, a rapid and gradual reduction in IL-6 over time compared to
patients who did not receive these drugs, but no effect on TNF-a, while hydroxychloroquine,
acetaminophen, or anti-coagulants did not clearly appear to alter cytokine levels. The clinical
outcome of patients stratified based on IL-6 levels will need to be confirmed in prospective
randomized trials.

DISCUSSION
As COVID-19 started overwhelming the health systems around the world, we aimed to
understand the role of inflammatory cytokines on disease course and outcome. We established
a rapid multiplex cytokine test to measure IL-6, TNF-a, and IL-1b, as known markers of
inflammation and organ damage, along with CXCL8/IL-8 because of its potent role in the
recruitment and activation of neutrophils, commonly elevated in COVID-19 patients. Importantly,
drugs blocking these cytokines are either FDA approved or in clinical trials. Studying over 1,400
hospitalized patients in a month, we established that COVID-19 is associated with high levels of
all four cytokines at presentation. Importantly, our observations indicate that cytokine patterns are
predictive of COVID-19 survival and mortality, independently of demographics, comorbidities, but
also of standard clinical biomarkers of diseases severity, including laboratory and clinical factors.
We found that IL-6 was one of the most robust prognostic markers of survival, eclipsing or
outperforming CRP, D-dimer, and ferritin after adjusting for the demographic features and
comorbidities. It remained independently associated with severity and predictive of outcome when
including information about ventilation and end organ damage. Furthermore, elevated TNF-a,
known to contribute to organ damage, was also a strong predictor of poor outcome even after
adjusting for other risk factors such as age, sex, hypoxia, disease severity scoring based on
clinical assessment, and IL-6. Our cytokine panel also included IL-8, which showed association
with survival time even though it was eclipsed by other severity factors after multivariate
adjustments, and IL-1b which was poorly detected and as a result had only marginal predictive
value. Although classic markers used routinely to determine inflammation and severity were still
useful to stratify patients on their own, when combined in multivariate analyses, many were no
longer significant likely due to collinearity, while IL-6 and TNF-a remained independently
predictive of outcome. Both overall survival and for competing risk models used here consistently

showed the significant prognostic value of TNF-a and IL-6 when all tested cytokines were in the
model, along with demographics, comorbidities, and other clinical and laboratory measurements,
highlighting the robustness of our findings. Interestingly, the COVID-19-related cytokine response
was quite distinct from the traditional cytokine storm associated with sepsis and CAR-T cells, with
sustained elevated cytokine levels over days and weeks, and relative absence of coordination
among them. This raises possibilities of honing on mitigation strategies with anti-cytokine
treatments, though which one(s) and the window of opportunity for their use remain to be
established. Guiding such therapies based on mechanistic association with cytokine levels could
provide a rational approach.
Trials to block IL-6 signaling with already FDA-approved drugs have been launched across
the world and some clinical benefits have been seen in a subset of patients in small single center
observational studies13,18. In contrast, interim analysis of randomized trials with sarilumab versus
placebo identified potential benefit only in patients with severe but not moderate disease19. There
are no available data correlating levels of IL-6 and response to treatment, and none of the current
studies have used cytokine profiling as part of their inclusion criteria. It is possible that patients
with moderate disease and high IL-6 levels will best benefit from cytokine blockade. There is also
a need to evaluate the effect of anti-TNF-a therapy on its own in COVID-19. Since IL-6 and TNFa appear to be independent variables, studies with combination regimen blocking both cytokines
would be important to consider for added clinical efficacy.
Early cytokine measurements are reliable predictors of outcome and therefore raise the
critical importance of using serum cytokine levels for treatment decisions. The predictive value of
these cytokines may help to inform therapeutic interventions to determine which individuals are
likely to develop respiratory failure, end organ damage, and death. Cytokine levels can serve to
evaluate appropriateness for pharmacotherapy with available or experimental agents and to
select optimal trial designs to disrupt the underlying inflammatory milieu. A prediction model built
on cytokine levels early in disease may serve to inform health care allocation and prioritization of
individuals at highest risk.
Our current efforts are to build such a predictive model from our current study using a
validation cohort of more than 700 patients admitted from April 20, 2020 onward, and to
supplement it with data from higher dimensional assays such as Olink proximity extension assay
and Somalogics aptamer platform20. which can assay hundreds to thousands of soluble analytes
from serum or plasma. The most informative dimensions from these assays could then be carried
back into the rapid 4-8 plex ELLA cytokine detection system for clinical decision making, in

standard of care in prognosticating and monitoring of patients with COVID-19.

METHODS
ELLA cytokine test
The ELLA platform is a rapid cytokine detection system based on four parallel singleplex
microfluidics ELISA assays run in triplicate within cartridges following manufacturer’s instructions.
We first validated IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-a detection by ELLA at the Mount Sinai Human Immune
Monitoring Center using plasma from multiple myeloma patients undergoing immunotherapies
such as CAR-T cells and bispecific antibodies, known to elicit cytokine release storm. Analytical
validation (Supplementary Figure 1A-C) was performed using both reference cytokine controls
and biological replicates across different lots of cartridges, the reproducibility was >95%, with an
intra-assay CV of 0.8%, and an inter-assay CV of 0.4-0.8% for analytes in the high detection
range (>250 pg/mL), and a CV of 2.6-4.2% for analytes in the lowest detection range (5-50 pg/mL).
Serum and plasma appear to be equivalent for detection of these cytokines. In March 2020, as
the number of COVID-19 cases was increasing in New York City, we transferred the ELLA
methodology to the Mount Sinai Hospital Center for Clinical Laboratories, which allowed the ELLA
cytokine test to be coded into our electronic health record ordering system as part of a COVID-19
diagnostic panel.
Patient information and data source
This study was reviewed and approved by the Mount Sinai Institutional Review Board. A waiver
of informed consent was obtained to query the patient electronic medical record. Samples for the
RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 lab test were collected via nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab at one
of 53 different Mount Sinai locations, representing outpatient, urgent care, emergency and
inpatient facilities. Blood specimen for ELLA were collected via venipuncture within the MSHS. All
specimen and imaging were collected as part of standard of care.
Between March 21 and April 28, 1,484 patients hospitalized with suspicion of COVID-19 were
tested for SARS-CoV-2 viral infection status by PCR and for the ELLA cytokine panel, and we
obtained routine laboratory measurements, blood counts, and as part of their medical care.
Patients were identified by querying the pathology department electronic database for individuals
with both SARS-CoV-2 PCR-based testing and ELLA cytokine panel. Cytokine data was obtained
from pathology department electronic databases and clinical and demographic data was
supplemented with information from the Mount Sinai Data Warehouse, obtained from EPIC
electronic medical records (Verona, WI). Clinical follow-up data was collected up to May 7, 2020.

Two investigators (D.M.D.V. and S.G.) independently compiled all clinical and laboratory
information from these various sources, and compared them with near total matches. Differences
were adjudicated based on individual patient chart review, and were explained by either missing
or updated information from the data warehouse.
Variables
Our dataset included 3 broad classes of variables: (1) demographic variables (age, sex, race,
ethnicity and smoking status); (2) clinical variables for each day of hospital encounter (body mass
index (BMI), heart rate, temperature, respiratory rate, oxygen (O2) saturation, systolic blood
pressure, diastolic blood pressure, admission status, discharge status, and deaths; and (3)
comorbid conditions (chronic kidney disease (CKD), asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD), hypertension, obesity, diabetes, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), sleep
apnea, and cancer). All 3 categories were obtained from the patients’ electronic medical record
with comorbid conditions defined as an active ICD code and vital signs recorded for each patient's
given encounter.
Determining COVID-19 Disease Severity
A severity scale for COVID-19 was devised by pulmonologists at Mount Sinai based on literature21
and clinical practice, which defined categories as follows: 1) mild/moderate COVID-19, based on
normal/abnormal (<94%) oxygen saturation, respectively, or pneumonia on imaging; 2) severe
COVID-19, based on use of high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC), non-rebreather mask (NRB), bilevel
positive airway pressure (BIPAP) or mechanical ventilation, and no vasopressor use, and based
on creatinine clearance (CrCl) >30 and ALT < 5x upper limit of normal; and 3) Severe COVID-19
with end organ damage, based on use of HFNC, NRB, BIPAP or mechanical ventilation with use
of vasopressors, or based on CrCl <30, new renal replacement therapy (hemodialysis/continuous
veno-venous hemofiltration) or ALT > 5x ULN. Clinical notes and imaging reports were reviewed
in effort to establish the patient’s COVID-19 disease severity over time. Using a bag-of-words
approach to vectorize both clinical notes and image reports, vectors were derived from the chest
x-ray imaging report, in order to reflect the presence of viral pneumonia and worsening respiratory
symptoms. Intubation status and oxygen therapy modality were obtaining by examining the
patient clinical notes. The use of endotracheal tube, bilevel positive airway pressure, continuous
positive air pressure, high-flow nasal cannula, mechanical ventilator, and/or supplemental oxygen
greater than FiO2 70% was associated with severe COVID-19. End organ damage was defined

by an alanine aminotransferase level of greater than five times the upper limit of normal, creatinine
clearance less than 30, use of vasopressors, and/or new renal replacement therapy.
Sample size and power consideration:
The primary endpoint is the hazard ratio of death between the high and low levels of the cytokines
(TNF-a, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1b). We tested the hypothesis for H0: HRTNF-a=HRIL-6=HRIL-8=HRIL-1b=1
against Ha: any HR≠1. In this study, the event of interest is death. A two-sided log-rank test with
an overall sample size of 674 patients (337 in each group) achieves 80% power at a 0.05 type I
error to detect a hazard ratio of 2.29 when the proportion of death in the low group is 20%. The
study lasted for 40 days with an accrual time of 30 days and a median follow-up time of 9 days.
The proportion of patients who are still in the hospital during the study period is 10%. The sample
size calculation was conducted using PASS software. The primary analyses assessed the impact
of the cytokine levels after adjusting for patients’ demographics and comorbidities. The patients
eligible for further analyses were those with cytokine tests on the date or before the date of last
follow-up (n=1,298), which ensured the power ≥ 80% to test the primary hypothesis after adjusting
for the covariates. Approximately 5% of patients had missing values in baseline demographics
and comorbidities, and the cohort with complete cases was used for the primary analyses. The
secondary analyses assessed the impact of the cytokines on the event of death after further
adjusting for the clinical severity metrics. The analysis procedures were described in the statistical
analysis section.
Statistical analysis
Patients’ characteristics were summarized using the standard descriptive statistics: median
/interquartile range (IQR) for continuous variable, and count/percent for categorical variables.
Distributions of the cytokine values were assessed and log-2 transformed to render the parametric
statistical analyses. The cytokines were then categorized at the level of 70 pg/mL, 50 pg/mL, 35
pg/mL, 0.5 pg/mL, 100 mg/L, 1,000 µg/L, and 1 mg/L for IL-6, IL-8, TNF-a, IL-1b, CRP, ferritin,
and D-dimer, respectively. These stringent cutoffs for cytokines were decided based on the
median distribution within COVID-19 samples, while those for elevated inflammatory markers
were based on 2-3x the upper limit of normal detection. The univariate analyses assessed the
association of the cytokines and laboratory tests with patients’ characteristics using MannWhitney U test, Kruskal Wallis test and Spearman’s rank correlation test as appropriate.
Additionally, Deming regressions and Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated for
correlations between the cytokines and laboratory tests. We used multivariable linear regression

models to test the association of the cytokine values with patients’ demographics and
comorbidities22. The Kaplan-Meier plots along with the log-rank test were conducted to assess
the differences in survival probabilities between the high and low levels of each cytokine across
the follow-up time frame, which was calculated from the date of cytokine testing to date of death,
discharge or end of follow-up period as appropriate23. The Cox Proportional Hazard Model was
used to estimate the hazard of death adjusting for the covariates (e.g., patients’ demographics,
comorbidities, laboratory test results), which were determined by the backward elimination
method24,25. We assessed the survival model, censoring patients discharged alive and in hospitals.
The competing risk model, in which death was the event of interest, the live discharge was the
competing event, and inpatients were censored26,27, was also fitted as a sensitivity analysis. The
predicted survival probabilities and cumulative incidence curves were provided. The analyses
were performed using GraphPad Prism 8.4.2., SAS 9.4, and R v.3.6.3.

Supplementary Table S3.
After stratification by the most predictive variables (O2 saturation, age group, and severity score),
the independent predictive value of IL-6 and TNF-a remains, and IL-8 returns to significance. The
estimates were obtained using SAS PHREG procedure and STRATA statement.

Supplementary Figure S1. Sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility testing of the ELLA platform
and cytokine levels and correlation observed in COVID-19 specimens. A. Spearman r correlation
between IL-6 tested by two other platforms for soluble analyte detection, Olink and LabCorp, using plasma
or serum specimens from CAR-T CRS or COVID-19. B. Interassay and intraassay coefficient of variation
(CV) of replicates for two recombinant controls used at high or low concentration in each assay for IL-6 and
TNF-a using a first set of controls, and for the ELLA panel used in this study using Randox recombinant
antigens at three dilution levels. C. Reproducibility testing replicates of the same biological specimen from
CAR-T samples, with Spearman r indicated. D. Distribution of each cytokine in all COVID-19 samples
tested. E. Correlation matrix of IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-b levels in COVID-19 plasma specimens and in
E. multiple myeloma specimens during immunotherapy-related CRS. Scale indicates value of Spearman r
correlation. Cytokines levels are less coordinated in COVID-19 than in CAR-T CRS.

Supplementary Figure S2. A. Unsupervised clustering of laboratory measurements in a subset of 1069 patients with
sufficient available information. On the y axis are vitals and laboratory values after z-scoring, and on the x axis are
individual patients, using metrics measured from the time point corresponding to the first ELLA cytokine test. Grey bars
on the side of the plot indicate clusters of patients or analytes, where cytokines co-cluster with known severity metrics,
such as LDH, CRP, ferritin, D-dimer, but also high neutrophil, platelet and white blood counts. Annotations show
patients who died in orange, and maximum severity score achieved in gray shades. B. Similarity matrix of patients
based on analytes and measurements, showing two major clusters, with enrichment in patients who died and had more
severe COVID-19 on the upper left. C. Similarity matrix of cytokines, lab measurements and vitals, showing IL-6, IL-8,
and IL-1b co-clustering with known inflammatory markers such as LDH, CRP, ferritin, and D-dimer, while TNF-a coclusters with organ damage markers.
