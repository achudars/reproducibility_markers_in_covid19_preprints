TABLE OF CONTENTS SUMMARY
This retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data demonstrates the significant
association between the original and modified Caprini score and symptomatic VTE or
unfavorable outcome in 168 patients with confirmed COVID-19. The Caprini score may be
used for VTE risk assessment, and identification of persons at extremely high risk among
COVID-19 patients admitted to the hospital.

Abstract
Objective. The study aimed to validate the original Caprini score and its modifications
considering coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as a severe prothrombotic condition in patients
admitted to the hospital with confirmed infection.
Methods. The relevant data were extracted from the electronic medical records with the
implemented Caprini score and were evaluated retrospectively. The score was calculated
twice: by the physician at the admission and by the investigator at discharge or after death.
The second calculation at discharge, considered additional risk factors that occurred during
inpatient treatment. Besides the original Caprini score (a version of 2005), the modified
version added the elevation of D-dimer and specific scores for COVID-19 as follows: 2
points for asymptomatic, 3 points for symptomatic and 5 points for symptomatic infection
with positive D-dimer, were evaluated in a retrospective manner. The primary endpoint was
symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) confirmed by appropriate imaging testing or
dissection. The secondary endpoint included the unfavorable outcome as a combination of
symptomatic VTE, admission to the intensive care unit, the requirement for invasive
mechanical ventilation, and death. The association of eight different versions of the Caprini
score with outcomes was evaluated.

Results. Totally 168 patients (83 males and 85 females at the age of 58.3±12.7 years
old) were admitted to the hospital between April 30 and May 29, 2020, and were discharged
or died up to the time of data analysis. The original Caprini score varied between 2-12
(5.4±1.8) at the admission and between 2-15 (5.9±2.5) at discharge or death. The presence of
the virus increased these scores and resulted in an increased score with the maximal value for
those including COVID-19 points (10.0±3.0). Patients received prophylactic (2.4%),
intermediate (76.8%), or therapeutic (20.8%) doses of enoxaparin. Despite this, the
symptomatic VTE was detected in 11 (6.5%) and unfavorable outcomes in 31 (18.5%)
patients. The Caprini score of all eight versions demonstrated a significant association with
VTE with the highest predictability for the original scale when assessed at discharge.
Supplementation of the original score by elevated D-dimer improved predictability only at
the admission. Four versions of the Caprini score calculated at the admission had a significant
correlation with the unfavorable outcome with the minor advantages of specific COVID-19
points.
Conclusion. The study identified a significant correlation between the Caprini score
and the risk of VTE or unfavorable outcomes in COVID-19 patients. All models, including
specific COVID-19 scores, showed high predictability with minor differences.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a highly infectious disease caused by the SARSCoV-2 virus leading to the development of severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS). The infection has appeared in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in
December of 2019, and has been spread globally.1 The high prevalence of venous
thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE),
and pulmonary artery (PA) thrombosis, among the inpatients and critically ill patients, have
been reported since the beginning of the pandemic.2-11 The overall duplex ultrasound scan
(DUS) detected the presence of DVT in 46% of the patients in the general ward and up to
79% of the patients in the intensive care unit (ICU).10, 11 Proven PE using contrast computed
tomography (CT) scan was observed in 30% of all COVID-19 patients.8 The evidence of
small and mid-sized PA thrombosis and microthrombi in alveolar capillaries was found in
most of the deceased patients in parallel with the occlusion of big branches of PA in 9-33%
of dissections.12-16 Considering the high incidence of thrombotic complications in COVID-19,
most of the current guidelines suggest routine pahrmacoprophylaxis using low-molecularweight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin (UFH) for patients admitted to the
hospital.17-21 Some publications support the intensification of anticoagulation (intermediate to
therapeutic doses of heparin) in subjects at individually highest risk for VTE including
critical illness, obesity, and high level of D-dimer.17,

19, 20

The tools mentioned in these

publications for VTE risk assessment include: the Caprini score, Padua score, and IMPROVE
VTE score.18-20 The Padua score was assessed in two papers without a clear correlation with
VTE events.22, 23 To the best of our knowledge, the Caprini and IMPROVE VTE scores have
not been validated in COVID-19 patients.

To cover this gap, we decided to perform the current study aimed to validate the
original Caprini score and its modified version considering COVID-19 as a severe
prothrombotic condition in patients admitted to the hospital with confirmed SARS-CoV-2
infection. We also tested the influence of several levels of D-dimer combined with the
original Caprini score to improve the identification of patients at the highest risk of VTE.
Methods
This study is a single-center retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data
obtained from medical records of patients admitted at the Clinical Hospital no.1
(Volynskaya) of the President's Administration of the Russian Federation (Moscow, Russian
Federation) with verified COVID-19. The hospital stopped standard medical care and was
reoriented for COVID-19 on April 30, 2020. Two years before the Caprini score (a version of
2005 in Russian translation24) was integrated into the electronic medical records (EMR) and
became mandatory for assessment. The EMRs were extracted on May 30, 2020, when all
COVID-19 patients were discharged, and the hospital turned back to the standard care.
The initial Caprini score was calculated by the physician at the time of patients
admission. It did not take into account some risk factors related to inpatient treatment (bed
rest for >72 hours, central venous catheter, acquired thrombophilia, etc.). Standard
coagulation testing, including the level of D-dimer, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial
thromboplastin time (APTT), was performed in all admitted patients but was not considered
within the primary assessment of Caprini score. The reason being at the time of admission,
the blood test results were not known by the initial examiner. In Russia, the indication for
inpatient treatment for adults is a moderate to severe disease according to the locally adopted
criteria with respiratory rate >22 per min or SpO2 <93% with room air, a mild illness in
subjects over 65 years old with significant co-morbidities (chronic heart failure, diabetes
mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]), and pregnancy. We decided that

all patients with moderate to severe illness and/or representing specific signs of pneumonia
on a chest CT scan should receive one Caprini point for pneumonia at the admission as well
as one additional score for medical illness with bed rest (Table I).
The final score was assessed by the two investigators via EMR after patients' discharge
or death. The additional risk factors related to inpatient treatment were evaluated. Also, the
elevated D-dimer at admission was assessed as "acquired" thrombophilia from the block of 3
scores. We used a liberal or strict approach in the assessment of D-dimer and achieved two
different versions of the Caprini score. In the liberal version, we put an additional 3 points for
any patient who had elevated D-dimer over the upper limit of normal (ULN: >0,55 mg/L) at
the admission. Within the strict version, only patients with D-dimer >3 times ULN (>1,5
mg/L) received the additional 3 points. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, one of the authors
(JA Caprini) proposed using a modified score for COVID-19 patients. It adds 2 points for
COVID-19 patients with asymptomatic disease, 3 points for those with symptomatic illness,
and 5 points for symptomatic patients with a positive D-dimer. This modification also was
used for the retrospective analysis.
We calculated the four different Caprini scores obtained at the admission and the
discharge or death. We achieved eight versions of the scale: Caprini[orig:adm] - original
score calculated at admission; Caprini[orig:fin] - original score calculated at discharge or
death;

Caprini[Dd>ULN:adm] - score with liberal D-dimer calculated at admission;

Caprini[Dd>ULN:fin] - score with liberal D-dimer calculated at discharge or death;

The standard prevention of VTE included prophylactic or intermediate doses of
LMWH. The local protocol proposed in our clinic required intermediate doses of LMWH for
all patients without bleeding risk. It was suggested at the background of the high prevalence
of VTE and PA thrombosis in COVID-19 patients. Although not all international guidelines
support this approach, it was not contradictory to the interim Russian national
recommendations. Only patients at high risk of bleeding were managed with the standard
prophylactic doses LMWH. The therapeutic anticoagulation was prescribed for subjects
without confirmed VTE in case of a critical level of D-dimer (>6 times the ULN) or
suspected thrombi in PA (e.g., hypoxemia disproportionate to known respiratory pathologies,
or acute unexplained right ventricular dysfunction). The local protocol suggested empiric
initiation of therapeutic anticoagulation in case of presumptive VTE with the mandatory
further verification by appropriate imaging tests before discharge. A duplex ultrasound scan
was used to assess superficial and deep veins of lower and upper extremities, computed
tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) - to exclude thrombi in the pulmonary artery. If
the patient died, the autopsy with an evaluation of lung vessels and veins of lower limbs was
obligatory for the final VTE verification.
The primary endpoint was symptomatic venous thromboembolism confirmed by
appropriate imaging testing or dissection at autopsy. The secondary endpoints included: (1)
the unfavorable outcome as a combination of symptomatic VTE, admission to the ICU, the
requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation, and death, and (2) a bleeding outcome as a
combination of major and clinically relevant non-major (CRNM) bleeding by the criteria of
International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis.25,

All events were assessed in a

score calculated either at admission or discharge or death. In contrast, the correlation between
an unfavorable outcome and the Caprini score was done only at the time of admission.
No need for ethical approval and a waiver of informed consent because of the
retrospective character of the analysis in the urgent situation was confirmed by the
Institutional Review Board of Clinical Hospital no.1 of the President's Administration of the

Statistical analysis. All absolute values are represented by mean with standard deviation
(SD) in the normal distribution or by a median with interquartile range (IQR) 25-75
percentile in the non-normal distribution assessed by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The relative
values are represented as percents, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) calculated by Wilson.
The data were compared by paired t-test or ANOVA. The association between the Caprini
score and outcomes was evaluated by the generalized linear model (GLM), a form of linear
regression analysis. The predictability of Caprini scores for proposed outcomes was assessed
by a single-factor univariate logistic regression analysis and evaluation of receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curves with their areas under the curve (AUC). The cut-off for the
Caprini score with current sensitivity and specificity was extracted from the coordinates of
ROC curves. The analysis was performed using SPSS version 26 software package (IBM
Corp, Armonk, NY). The value of p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
A total of 168 patients were admitted to the hospital between April 30 and May 29,
2020. Up to the time of data extraction, everybody was discharged or died, and every EMR
was eligible for analysis. The number of males and females was equivalent (83 and 85,
respectively). The age varied between 21 and 86 (mean of 58.3±12.7) years old. COVID-19
diagnosis was confirmed with polymerase chain reaction on nasopharyngeal swabs of 140
patients (83%); 28 (17%) despite the negative result had a typical pattern of viral pneumonia

on chest CT scan (ground-glass opacity) as assessed by the experienced radiologists. The
interim Russian national guidelines classified the disease severity as moderate (body
temperature >38 degrees of Celsium, respiratory rate >22 per min, dyspnea in physical
activity, pneumonia by chest CT scan, SpO2<95%, C-reactive protein >10 mg/mL) in 155
(92%) patients. Severe disease criteria (respiratory rate >30 per min, SpO2≤93%, PaO2 /FiO2

≤300 mm Hg, disease progression by chest CT scan, a decrease of consciousness or agitation,
unstable hemodynamics, serum lactate >2 mmol/L, qSOFA >2) were found in 13 (8%)
subjects. Time to admission from the onset of symptoms varied between 1 and 24 (mean of
7.2±4.0) days. During this period, patients were treated at home with symptomatic therapy,
chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, and antibiotics.
The PT at the admission ranged from 9.3 to 29.1 sec (mean of 11.6±1.9 sec; the normal
range of 9.8-12.1 sec). It was prolonged in nine (5%) patients. The APTT varied between
22.0-54.1 sec (mean of 32.9±5.0 sec; the normal range of 26.4-37.5 sec). It was increased in
44 (26%) subjects. The D-dimer varied from 0,1 to 6.7 mg/L (median of 0.6 mg/L with the
IQR of 0.4-1.0 mg/L; ULN is 0.55 mg/L). Any elevation of D-dimer was observed in 102
(61%) patients and elevation >3 times ULN – in 15 (9%) subjects. We did not use the ageadjusted ULN for D-dimer like all previous reports on its level in patients with COVID-19.3,

All patients received therapy with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, antibiotics, noninvasive and invasive oxygen therapy, symptomatic treatment, and prophylactic
anticoagulation. The LMWH was used in the standard prophylactic dose (enoxaparin 40 mg
once daily) in 4 (2.4%) patients, in the intermediate dose (enoxaparin 60-80 mg once daily) in
129 (76.8%) patients, and in therapeutic doses (enoxaparin 1 mg/kg twice daily) in 35
(20.8%) patients. The duration of inpatient treatment varied from 1 to 29 days (mean of
13.9±4.0 days).

The risk factor distribution by the Caprini score is represented in Table I. By the
original scale, the score ranged from 2 to 12 (mean of 5.4±1.8) as calculated at the admission
and between 2 and 15 (mean of 5.9±2.5) as calculated at discharge or death. Among all
modifications, the highest score was observed with Caprini[COVID-19] version followed by
Caprini[Dd>ULN], Caprini[Dd>3ULN], and the original version. All scores significantly
increased when they were measured at the end of hospitalization (Table II).
The symptomatic VTE was detected in 11 of 168 (6.5%; 95% CI, 3.7-11.3%) patients
including catheter-related venous thrombosis of upper limbs in 3 (1.8%; 95% CI, 0.6-5.1%)
cases; isolated DVT in 2 (1.2%; 95% CI, 0.3-4.3%) cases; combination of DVT and PE in 1
(0.6%; 95% CI, 0.1-3.3%) case, and isolated PE in 5 (3.0%; 95% CI, 1.3-6.8%) cases. Of
three DVT, two affected the distal veins, and one – the proximal veins. Thrombosis of calf
muscle veins was the only one of these leg clots associated with PE. Of six pulmonary
embolism, five were fatal and confirmed by autopsy; the last one was confirmed by CTPA.
All lesions affected segmental and subsegmental branches of PA. All VTE events developed
despite intermediate (n=5) or therapeutic (n=6) doses of LMWH.
The unfavorable outcome was detected in 31 (18.5%; 95% CI, 13.1-24.7%) patients
including admission to the ICU in 28 (16.7%; 95% CI, 11.8-23.1%), the requirement for
mechanical ventilation in 8 (4.8%; 95% CI, 2.5-9.2%), and death in 8 (4.8%; 95% CI, 2.59.2%) cases. Of 8 patients on mechanical ventilation, 7 (88%) finally died. The CRNM
bleeding was detected in only 2 (1.2%; 95% CI, 0.3-4.3%) subjects represented by
subcutaneous hematoma required surgical drainage and uterine bleeding. Both occurred while
receiving a therapeutic and intermediate dose of LMWH, respectively.
The statistically significant association with symptomatic VTE was observed for all
versions of the Caprini score calculated either at the admission or discharge or death
(p<0.001, Figures 1 and 2). The high predictability was confirmed by the single-factor

(Caprini[Dd>ULN:adm]). The score of ≥10 with the sensitivity of 73% and specificity of
85% predicted the occurrence of symptomatic venous thromboembolism. However, the
standard version (Caprini[orig:adm]) demonstrated high predictability as well: with a
sensitivity of 73% and the specificity of 80%, the score of ≥7 predicted VTE. Among those
scores obtained at the discharge or death, the best predictability was observed for the original
version of the scale (Caprini[orig:fin]): with the sensitivity of 73% and specificity of 96%
score of ≥11 predicted VTE. Also, this model had the highest AUC among all evaluated. The
second highest predictability was observed for the version considering any elevation of Ddimer (Caprini[Dd>ULN:fin]): with the sensitivity of 73% and specificity of 97% score of

≥14 predicted VTE. Generally, better predictability and higher specificity were observed for
the Caprini score obtained at the end of inpatient treatment.
The significant association between the Caprini score of all versions obtained at the
admission and the unfavorable outcome in COVID-19 patients was observed (Figure 3). The
logistic regression and the analysis of ROC curves confirmed the high predictability of all
models (Table III, IV, Figure 5). The modified version considering the COVID-19 points
(Caprini[COVID-19:adm]) provided the highest AUC. The score of ≥11 with the sensitivity
of 68% and specificity of 75% predicted the unfavorable outcome. However, the original
version (Caprini[orig:adm]) provided comparable predictability: the score of ≥6 predicted the
unfavorable outcome with the sensitivity of 74% and specificity of 66%.
Discussion
The Caprini score is the most validated risk assessment tool for VTE that was evaluated
in about 5 million medical and surgical patients worldwide.35-37 The previous study showed

improved predictability when the results of viscoelastic measurements supplemented the
original score.38 However, it has not been validated in patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 to
date. Despite this, the American Venous Forum has already recommended using the Caprini
score for VTE risk assessment at admission and discharge.19 They referenced the original
Caprini score in their recommendations. The score of ≥8 was suggested as an indication for
the intensification of pharmacological prophylaxis in the hospital and extended prophylaxis
after discharge. Our study is the first to use a COVID-19 modified Caprini score, and
compare it to the original score. We also tested some theoretical score modifications based on
the D-dimer level. At the same time, our study shows that an original score of ≥7, as
calculated at admission, and a score of ≥11, as calculated at discharge, are associated with
increased risk of VTE despite the administration of LMWH (predominantly intermediate
doses). Such patients may be considered as an extremely high-risk group that requires special
attention. The threshold of 11 points has been identified previously as a criterion for
extremely high-risk of VTE in surgical patients.24, 38 The importance of the D-dimer level in
COVID-19 was introduced recently. It appears to be associated with unfavorable outcomes,
increased mortality, and VTE.3, 8, 10, 27-34 The thresholds for VTE verification were found at
the levels of 1.0-2.3 mg/L3,

8, 10

. The prophylactic doses of LMWH increased survival in

patients with D-dimer level >6 times the ULN.39 The American Venous Forum proposed
therapeutic anticoagulation for subjects with D-dimer >3 times ULN.19 However, in our
study, the suggested level of D-dimer supplemented the scale did not improve the
predictability of the original Caprini score for VTE. At the same time, considering any
elevation of D-dimer improved the predictability and specificity of the original score when
calculated at admission, but not at the discharge. In general, all evaluated models
demonstrated good predictability with minor differences.

The predictive value for the unfavorable outcome was similar for all models with
limited advantage of the one considering the new COVID-19 points. It was the only issue
where the suggested modification appeared useful. However, the original version
demonstrated sufficient predictability. Of note, any change of the original Caprini score
affects the predictive threshold for extremely high-risk group, which could vary by 4-5
points. So the prognosis for VTE and detection of patients requiring intensified prophylaxis
and/or additional imagining tests for VTE should be based on a specific threshold of every
version of the scale (Table IV).
Interestingly, the incidence of VTE and mortality rate in our study appeared to be lower
than previously reported for the general ward.4, 7, 10 This fact may be related to the use of
intermediate to therapeutic doses of LMWH in 97,6% of all patients. There is a limited
evidence that therapeutic anticoagulation can improve survival in COVID-19 patients
requiring mechanical ventilation.40 However, the risk-benefit ratio of intensified
anticoagulation should be confirmed in robust randomized clinical trials.
The study was limited by a retrospective character, small sample size, absence of the
total instrumental screening for VTE, and lack of follow-up after discharge. Despite these
disadvantages, it may be essential to improve VTE risk stratification in COVID-19 patients.
Conclusion
The study identified a direct correlation between the Caprini score and the risk of VTE
or unfavorable outcomes in COVID-19 patients. The score of ≥7, as calculated at the
admission, or ≥11, as evaluated at the discharge, predicts symptomatic venous
thromboembolism despite pharmacological prophylaxis. The predictability of the original
score may be improved by the implementation of a D-dimer or specific COVID-19 points.
However, the original Caprini score is essential. Further studies are needed to determine if
there are any clinical benefits using the modified COVID-19 Caprini score. It will be

Caprini score and the use of post-discharge prophylaxis.

Caprini[COVID-19:adm] – considering 2 points for asymptomatic infection, 3 points for
symptomatic infection, 5 points for symptomatic infection with positive D-dimer, score
assessed at admission (p<0.001 by GLM);
ULN – upper limit of normal

Figure 4. Predictability of different versions of Caprini score for symptomatic VTE by
the ROC curves
Caprini[orig:adm] – the original score assessed at admission; Caprini[orig:fin] – the original
score assessed at discharge or death; Caprini[Dd>ULN:adm] – considering 3 points if Ddimer increased over ULN, score assessed at admission; Caprini[Dd>ULN:fin] – considering
3 points if D-dimer increased over ULN, score assessed at discharge or death;
Caprini[Dd>3ULN:adm] - considering 3 points if D-dimer increased >3 times over ULN,
score assessed at admission; Caprini[Dd>3ULN:fin] - considering 3 points if D-dimer
increased >3 times over ULN, score assessed at discharge or death; Caprini[COVID-19:adm]
– considering 2 points for asymptomatic infection, 3 points for symptomatic infection, 5
points for symptomatic infection with positive D-dimer, score assessed at admission;
Caprini[COVID-19:fin] – considering 2 points for asymptomatic infection, 3 points for
symptomatic infection, 5 points for symptomatic infection with positive D-dimer, score
assessed at discharge or death; ROC – receiver operating characteristic

Figure 5. Predictability of different versions of Caprini score for unfavorable outcome
in COVID-19 by the ROC curves
Unfavorable outcome combined symptomatic VTE, admission to the intensive care unit, the
requirement for mechanical ventilation and death
Caprini[orig:adm] – the original score assessed at admission; Caprini[Dd>ULN:adm] –
considering 3 points if D-dimer increased over ULN, score assessed at admission;
Caprini[Dd>3ULN:adm] - considering 3 points if D-dimer increased >3 times over ULN,
score assessed at admission; Caprini[COVID-19:adm] – considering 2 points for
asymptomatic infection, 3 points for symptomatic infection, 5 points for symptomatic
infection with positive D-dimer, score assessed at admission; ROC – receiver operating
characteristic
