ABSTRACT

Importance: Essential workers in agriculture and food production have been severely affected by the
ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Objective: To identify risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 shedding and antibody response in
farmworkers in California.

Design: This cross-sectional study collected survey data and determined current SARS-CoV-2 shedding
and seropositivity among 1,107 farmworkers in California’s Salinas Valley from 16 July to 30 November
2020.

Setting: Farmworkers receiving transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) tests for SARS-CoV-2
infection at federally qualified community clinics and community sites were invited to participate in our
study.
Participants: Individuals were eligible if they were not pregnant, ≥18 years old, had conducted farm work
since the pandemic started, and were proficient in English or Spanish.

Exposures: Sociodemographic, household, community, and workplace characteristics.
Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Current (as indicated by TMA positivity) and historical (as indicated
by IgG seropositivity) SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Results: Most farmworkers enrolled in the study were born in Mexico, had primary school or lower levels
of educational attainment, and were overweight or obese. Current SARS-CoV-2 shedding was associated
in multivariable analyses with attained only primary or lower educational levels (RR=1.32; 95% CI: 0.991.76), speaking an indigenous language at home (RR=1.30; 0.97-1.73), working in the fields (RR=1.60;
1.03-2.50), and exposure to known or suspected COVID-19 case at home (RR=2.98; 2.06-4.32) or in the
workplace (RR=1.59; 1.18-2.14). Antibody detection was associated with residential exposures including
living in crowded housing (RR=1.23; 0.98-1.53), with children (RR=1.40; 1.1-1.76) or unrelated
roommates (RR=1.40; 1.19-1.64), and with a known or suspected COVID-19 case (RR=1.59; 1.13-2.24).
Those who were obese (RR=1.65; 1.01-2.70) or diabetic (RR=1.31; 0.98-1.75) were also more likely to be
seropositive. Farmworkers who lived in rural areas other than Greenfield (RR=0.58; 0.47-0.71), worked
indoors (RR=0.68; 0.61-0.77), or whose employer provided them with information on how to protect
themselves at work (RR=0.59; 0.40-0.86) had lower risk of prior infection.

Conclusions and Relevance: Our findings suggest both residential and workplace exposures are
contributing to SARS-CoV-2 infection among farmworkers in California. Urgent distribution of COVID-19
vaccines is warranted given this population’s increased risk of infection and the essential nature of their
work.

INTRODUCTION

Essential workers in agriculture and food production have been severely affected by the ongoing COVID19 pandemic. Widely-reported outbreaks associated with occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2 have
1

strained U.S. food supply chains and drawn attention to circumstances potentially placing workers at risk,
including poor hygienic conditions, lack of access to educational materials in languages other than
English, medical leave policies, and residential crowding.

2

Agricultural work is one of the lowest-paid occupations of the U.S. economy, with 29% of full-time workers
3

earning an annual income below $26,200 for a family of four. More than half of U.S. farmworkers are
4

5

Latino, and many live in crowded housing of substandard quality. In California, at least half of
farmworkers are believed to be undocumented, which could further lead to labor exploitation and a less
protected working environment.6 In a study in Monterey County, California, we have reported 4-fold higher
SARS-CoV-2 test positivity among farmworkers than the county population at large, and 24% higher test
7
positivity among farmworkers than other individuals residing in the same communities. Statewide,

agricultural and food workers experienced a 39% higher risk of all-cause death from March-October 2020
than during the same period in 2019 — a greater increase than any other occupational group;8 for
workers of Latino backgrounds, the increase in all-cause mortality was 60%.

9

Because specific exposures accounting for the high risk of infection among farmworkers remain poorly
understood, there is uncertainty about what strategies can reduce risk of infection in this population.

10

Here, we assessed sociodemographic, household, community, and workplace factors associated with
SARS-CoV-2 infection and antibody response in a population of over 1,000 farmworkers working in the
Salinas Valley in Monterey County, California.

METHODS

Study setting

The Salinas Valley, located within Monterey County, California, is home to an agricultural workforce of
approximately 50,000 resident farmworkers, with an additional 40,000 seasonal workers supporting the
11
peak summer and fall seasons. Clinica de Salud del Valle de Salinas (CSVS), a federally qualified

community health center, is the main healthcare provider for Monterey County’s farmworkers and their
families with a network of 12 clinics throughout the valley serving approximately 50,000 low-income,
primarily Spanish-speaking patients.

SARS-CoV-2 testing

Testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection at CSVS began 15 June 2020 and was offered to all individuals
regardless of exposure, symptoms, documentation, or health insurance status. Medical personnel
collected oropharyngeal specimens for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA via the qualitative Hologic
(Marlborough, Massachusetts) Aptima nucleic acid transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) assay.
Testing was conducted on clinic premises or at community sites, including low-income housing,
agricultural fields, and CSVS-run community health fairs.
Study enrollment

Between 16 July and 30 November 2020, we invited farmworkers (i.e., anyone employed in the
agricultural sector) receiving care or getting tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection at CSVS clinics and
community sites to participate in our study. We posted flyers about the study at the clinics and around
town and provided study information to community groups and growers. Farmworkers were eligible for
participation if they were not pregnant, ≥18 years old, had conducted farm work within the two weeks
preceding their testing date, and were sufficiently proficient in English or Spanish to give consent and
complete study procedures. Beginning 5 October, we enrolled any individuals who had engaged in
agricultural work at any time since March 2020 since the growing season was ending.

We enrolled a total of 1,115 farmworkers. We excluded 8 farmworkers who did not provide blood samples
or were not employed as farmworkers at time of enrollment from analyses, leaving a total of 1,107
participants. Study protocols were approved by the Office for the Protection of Human Subjects at UC
Berkeley. All participants provided informed written consent.

Study procedures
After the participant completed the SARS-CoV-2 TMA test and consented to participate in the study, the
study team obtained a blood sample by venipuncture for testing of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody status. We
then measured (with shoes on) height and weight using a digital scale. The study team administered a
45-minute computer-guided questionnaire by telephone in Spanish or English within two days before (for
pre-consented participants) or after the enrollment visit, but before SARS-CoV-2 testing results were
available. The questionnaire gathered information on socio-demographic characteristics, risk factors for
SARS-CoV-2 infection, and impacts of the pandemic on daily life and wellbeing. Participants received a
$50 prepaid VISA gift card which was loaded upon completion of all data collection activities.

Blood specimens were stored immediately at 4-7ºC and centrifuged and aliquoted within 48 hours
following collection. We used an in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to measure
immunoglobulin G (IgG) reactivity to the SARS-CoV-2 spike and receptor binding domain proteins, as
described previously.7 Prior validation of the assay used convalescent sera from hospitalized, mildly
symptomatic, and asymptomatic PCR-positive cases as well as pre-2020 control specimens.

Statistical analyses

We analyzed current (TMA-positivity) and historical (IgG antibody reactivity) SARS-CoV-2 infection
separately. Analyses examining risk factors for TMA positivity included participants who worked in
agriculture in the two weeks preceding enrollment (n=911); analyses for seropositivity included all
farmworkers who provided a blood sample (n=1,058).

We performed bivariate analyses for a wide range of socio-demographic, household, community, and
work-related characteristics known or suspected to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection (Tables 1-4
and eTables 1-4) and assessed correlations between these characteristics (eFigure 1). We included
covariates in multivariate models if there were >5 TMA positive or seropositive cases in each category,
respectively, and a chi-square or t-test p-value<0.2 in bivariate analyses. Categorical risk factors were
modeled as shown in Tables 1-4, with the exception of language spoken at home (modeled as
indigenous language spoken at home — yes/no) and working in the fields (yes/no). Age, years in the
U.S., and household size were modeled as continuous variables. We did not consider specific agricultural
crops in multivariate analyses because farmworkers reported working in a variety of them. We used
backward stepwise elimination (with a threshold of p<0.1) to select covariates for inclusion in final models.

We used multiple imputation with chained equations to account for missing values (<2.5% missing for all
variables). To account for differences between those recruited at clinics vs. community events, as well as
changes in the background positivity rate in Monterey County over the course of the study period, we
grouped participants into strata by recruitment site and period (i.e., 16 July-31 August, 1-30 September,
1-31 October, or 1-30 November). We used conditional fixed-effects Poisson models

12

to estimate

adjusted risk ratios (aRRs) while accounting for differences among strata, estimating robust standard
errors using the Huber-White estimator.

RESULTS

Most study participants were born in Mexico, had primary school or lower levels of educational
attainment, were married or living as married, and were overweight or obese (Table 1). Participants

averaged 39.7 (standard deviation (SD)=12.6) years of age and had lived in the U.S. for an average of
21.3 (SD=11.1) years. About 85% spoke Spanish at home, and 10% spoke an indigenous language. Half
of participants reported household earnings <$25,000 per year. Three-quarters lived with children,
including 36.9% living with children five years old or younger (Table 2). As many as 18.6% lived with
unrelated roommates and 74.4% lived with other farmworkers. On average, farmworkers lived with 5.5
(SD=2.5) household members and 36.5% lived in crowded conditions (>2 persons/bedroom). Few
reported leaving home for non-essential reasons (13%) or attending social gatherings with non-household
members (10.1%) in the two weeks preceding the survey. As many as 17.9% reported living with
someone who had symptoms of COVID-19 or were known to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 since the
pandemic started, and 10.9% reported such exposures at home in the two weeks preceding their test.

About three-quarters of participants worked in the fields and farmed a variety of crops; the most common
were berries (28.6%), leafy greens (26.4%), and broccoli (18.8%) (Table 3). Nearly all farmworkers
reported using a face covering at work, and 34.3% commuted to work with members of other households.
Almost 40% worked during the pandemic with someone who had symptoms of COVID-19 or were known
to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and 13.5% reported such workplace exposure during the two weeks
preceding their testing date. Almost all farmworkers reported that their employers provided them with
hand sanitizer, gloves, face coverings, and handwashing stations; disinfected surfaces and tools
regularly; and provided them with information on how to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission at work and
the importance of staying away from work if they were sick (Table 4). However, 44.7% reported that their
employer did not screen for fever and symptoms upon arrival at the workplace, which was recommended
as part of a countywide agricultural advisory.

Risk factors for current SARS-CoV-2 infection (TMA-positivity)

Thirteen percent (n=118) of the 911 participants currently working in agriculture tested positive for current
SARS-CoV-2 shedding by TMA, including 18.5% of those recruited at the clinics and 5.8% of those
recruited via outreach (Table 1). Several socio-demographic, household, community, and work-related
variables were associated with TMA positivity in bivariate analyses (Tables 1-4). Notably, we found that
participants who had a lower educational level, spoke indigenous languages at home, lived in the
community of Greenfield, worked in the fields, did not work indoors, commuted to work with nonhousehold members, lived or worked with someone who had symptoms of COVID-19 or with known
infection in the preceding two weeks, and were not screened for either fever or COVID-19 symptoms
upon arrival at work had a higher prevalence of TMA positivity. We also observed correlations between
some of these characteristics (eFigure 1).

In multivariate analyses, we found that TMA positivity was more common among individuals who had only
primary school or no education (aRR=1.32; 95% CI: 0.99-1.76), spoke an indigenous language at home
(aRR=1.30; 0.97-1.73), or lived with (aRR=2.98; 2.06-4.32) or worked with (aRR=1.59; 1.18-2.14)
someone who had symptoms of COVID-19 or was known to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the previous
two weeks. Additionally, working in the fields (compared to agricultural work in all other settings) was
associated with higher risk of current SARS-CoV-2 infection (aRR=1.60; 1.03-2.50). In contrast,
farmworkers screened by employers for symptoms of COVID-19 or elevated temperature had a reduced
risk of current infection (aRR=0.79; 0.61-1.01; Figure 1A).
Risk factors for prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (IgG antibody reactivity)

We found that 19% of the participants who provided a blood sample had antibody evidence of prior
infection, with similar prevalence among those tested in the clinics (18.4%) and at community sites
(19.4%; Table 1). Farmworkers with primary school or no education, who lived in Salinas or Greenfield
(vs. other towns), were overweight or obese, lived in large households or with children ≤5 years, lived in
crowded housing, had ever lived with someone who had symptoms of COVID-19 or were known to be
infected with SARS-CoV-2, and worked in the fields had higher antibody prevalence than their
counterparts (Tables 1-3). We also found that those who worked indoors and whose employer provided
information on how to protect themselves at work had lower likelihood of seropositivity (Tables 3 and 4).

In multivariate analyses, we found that participants who were obese (aRR=1.65; 1.01-2.70) or overweight
(aRR=1.42; 0.94-2.16) or reported being diabetic (aRR=1.31; 0.98-1.75) were more likely to be
seropositive. Additionally, we identified higher risk of seropositive status among those living with children

≤5 years old (aRR=1.40; 1.1-1.76), with unrelated roommates (aRR=1.40; 1.19-1.64) or in crowded
housing (aRR=1.23; 0.98-1.53), and those who had ever lived with someone who had symptoms of
COVID-19 or were known to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 (aRR=1.59; 1.13-2.24; Figure 1B).
Farmworkers who lived outside the region’s largest communities of Salinas and Greenfield (aRR=0.58;
0.47-0.71), worked indoors (aRR=0.68; 0.61-0.77), or whose employer provided them with information on
how to protect themselves at work (aRR=0.59; 0.40-0.86) had a decreased risk of serpositivity.

DISCUSSION
In this primarily Mexican-born and very low-income farmworker population in California, current SARSCoV-2 infection was associated with having lower levels of education, speaking an indigenous language,
working in the fields rather than elsewhere in agriculture, and exposure to known or suspected COVID-19
case at home or in the workplace. We also found higher prevalence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection,

indicated by IgG seropositivity, associated with outdoor work and with residential exposures (living in
crowded housing, with children or unrelated roommates, and with a known or suspected COVID-19 case).
Those living in the more urban areas of the county were particularly at risk, as were those who were
obese or diabetic. As evidence of the importance of health education, farmworkers who reported that their
employer provided them with information on COVID-19 protection were less likely to have been infected.

Our study suggests several routes of SARS-CoV-2 exposure that may be of importance to the farmworker
population. Unsurprisingly, living in crowded housing or with unrelated roommates was associated with
higher risk of prior infection. Independent of these associations, we also saw higher seroprevalence
among individuals living with children five years old or younger. While the role of children in SARS-CoV-2
transmission has been uncertain in many populations, in part due to lower risk of symptoms and lower
frequency of testing at younger ages,

14–16

recent investigations have demonstrated equivalent viral load

17

across ages and higher risk of transmission from infected children than from adults, given similar
18
household exposures. While schools and formal daycare establishments were closed during our study,

informal or home-based childcare arrangements with relatives or friends may have led to additional
exposure to infection. Taken together, our findings suggest substantial risk of infection associated with
residential exposures in this low-income essential workforce population.

Several workplace factors were also associated with infection risk. Farmworkers whose employers
provided informational resources on preventing COVID-19 at work had 41% lower risk of prior infection,
whereas farmworkers whose employers screened them for symptoms or fever had 21% lower risk of
current infection. This reduction could owe to benefits of health education, as well as more stringent
efforts by employers to reduce risk by providing education and screenings. Individuals working outside
and in the fields were more likely to be both currently infected and seropositive, respectively. Whereas
indoor exposures are thought to be associated with the greatest risk of transmission,

19

a lower perceived

sense of risk during outdoor work, difficulty using PPE while engaged in physically demanding tasks, or
socioeconomic differences among outdoor and indoor workers may contribute to the observed
association in our study. While the estimated risk ratio for infection associated with workplace exposure
was lower than that for household exposure, this difference could in part reflect misclassification, if
individuals are are more likely to know about the health of household members. Previously, we have
reported higher SARS-CoV-2 test positivity among farmworkers than among age- and sex-matched
7
adults from the same communities who also received testing at CSVS, further supporting the hypothesis

that workplace exposures specific to agriculture may be of importance to SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

Last, we observed that farmworkers who spoke indigenous languages and those with lower education
were more likely to currently have COVID-19 at the time of testing. Those who spoke indigenous
languages also had a lower educational level and had more recently arrived in the U.S. They lived in

more crowded conditions and were more likely to work in the fields and to commute to work with nonhousehold members (see eFigure 1). Only limited COVID-19 health messages have been provided in
indigenous languages, which are primarily not written languages.
We also saw associations of prior infection with comorbid conditions. While it is known that obesity
20
increases the risk for severe COVID-19 illness, we also observed an increased risk of prior infection

among obese individuals. This finding is consistent with a recent meta-analysis of 20 studies which found
46% higher odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection among obese individuals,
21–23

systemic metabolism, including altered adipokines

20

possibly related to alterations in

and chronic low‐grade inflammation.24,25 Similarly,

diabetes can attenuate the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., interferon gamma and
26
interleukins) and their downstream acute phase reactants, but also impair macrophage and lymphocyte
27
functions. As obesity and diabetes are prevalent among farmworkers as well as other low-income Latino

populations, our findings that these conditions are associated with higher risk of infection add to previous
concerns based on the knowledge that these conditions may also exacerbate risk of adverse clinical
outcomes.

Our work represents the first epidemiological study to address risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection
6,28–30

among U.S. farmworkers, and substantiates earlier concerns

that living and working conditions in

this population may contribute to risk of infection. Several limitations should be considered. We cannot
determine how well our sample represents the farmworker population, many of whom are “hidden” due to
31
their informal workforce participation and undocumented status. As we excluded individuals who did not

speak Spanish or English sufficiently well to participate, our study likely under-represents indigenous
populations. We observed differences in prevalence of current, but not prior, SARS-CoV-2 infection
7
between study participants recruited at clinics and those recruited via community outreach events, as

individuals seeking testing at clinics were more likely to be symptomatic or to report recent known
exposure; to mitigate confounding, we defined strata by recruitment site. In addition, waning antibodies,
particularly for individuals experiencing mild or asymptomatic infection,32 may have contributed to
misclassification for individuals infected early in the pandemic. Lastly, many identified risk factors were
highly correlated, making it difficult to separate out their unique effects.

Our previous analyses demonstrated a high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among farmworkers in
California’s Salinas Valley; findings reported here further underscore the urgent need to intervene on
modifiable risk factors such as increasing availability of isolation facilities to reduce exposure to COVID19 cases at home and access to paid medical leave to avoid transmission in the workplace. Farmworkers
speaking indigenous languages, who have very low levels of formal education, and who live in rural
communities were at especially high risk of infection in our study, demonstrate disparities even within this
very low-income and high-risk population. Efficacious vaccines have now been authorized and should be

distributed to farmworkers with urgency owing to the high risk of infection in this population, and the
essential nature of their work.
