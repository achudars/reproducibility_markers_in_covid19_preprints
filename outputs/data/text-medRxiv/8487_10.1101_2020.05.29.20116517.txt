Abstract

9

Background: Recent pandemic of the Noval Coronal Virus (COVID 19) has claimed more than

10

200,000 lives and about 3.8 million infected worldwide. Countries are being gradually exposed

11

to its devastating threat without being properly prepared and with inadequate response. COVID

12

19’s first two cases were reported in Pakistan on February 26, 2020. We present a model

13

depicting progression of epidemiology curve for Pakistan with and without interventions in view

14

of its health system’ response capacity in near future.

15

Methodology: We used a modified compartmental epidemiological SEIR model to describe the

16

outbreak of COVID-19 in Pakistan including the possibility of asymptomatic infection and

17

presymptomatic transmission. The behavior of the dynamic model is determined by a set of

18

clinical parameters and transmission rate.

19

Results: We estimated that in the absence of a set of proven interventions, the total susceptible

20

population would be 43.24 million, exposed individuals would be almost 32 million,

21

asymptomatic cases would be 13.13 million, mildly infected 30.64 million, severely infected

22

slightly more than 6 million and critical cases would be around 967,000 in number. By that time,

23

almost 760,000 fatalities of infected critical would have taken place. Comparing with the

24

healthcare capacity of Pakistan, if we could “flatten the curve” to a level below the dashed grey

25

line, the healthcare system will be capable of managing the cases with ideal healthcare facilities,

Background

34

December 2019 witnessed a new challenge to the advances of Public Health when a novel

35

corona virus emerged on the face of Earth infecting China’s Wuhan province and spread along

36

219 countries of the World within next four months causing more than four million cases and

37

nearly a quarter of million deaths, mostly in Europe and United States. The COVID 19, as the

38

name given to it, has been identified having three main strains: A, B and C. The ‘B’ strain

39

inflicted Chinese population and mutated to type ‘C’ when it reached Europe after clustering in

40

Singapore(1,2). It also reached Iran and from there to Pakistan. Pakistan had its first report of

41

cases on February 26th, 2020(3). Since then, by 16th of May, there have been reported 38,799

42

cases, with 834 deaths and 10,880 recovered cases(4).

43

A pandemic need to be understood in the context of its epidemiology and expected number of

44

cases with its case fatality rate and health system’s capacity in dealing with the critical patient

45

load with respect to its surge capacity, in an absence of proper preparedness. We conducted this

46

analysis, based on estimates considering that the cases identified were not the true picture due to

47

insufficient testing capacity and an absence of R0 for the country, to model Pakistan’s COVID

48

19’s trends and the health system’s capacity in dealing with the pandemic. This paper intends to

49

assess the effects of interventions like lock down, social distancing and awareness campaigns in

50

Pakistan via means of reduction in transmission. In the absence of any pharmaceutical aid, the

51

only interventions that can be implemented to avoid the spread of COVID-19 are social

52

distancing, self-quarantine and use of protective gears. The first lockdown was officially

53

imposed on 24th March, 2020 by the government in Pakistan and then eventually moved towards

54

a soft lockdown(4).

Methods

56

A modified compartmental epidemiological SEIR model is used to describe the outbreak of

57

COVID-19 in Pakistan including the possibility of asymptomatic infection and presymptomatic

58

transmission. The behavior of the dynamic model is determined by a set of clinical parameters

59

and transmission rate(5,6).The classic SEIR model assumes that an individual in the population

60

is susceptible (S), exposed (E) where they are asymptomatic and do not transmit infection,

61

infected and infectious (I), or recovered and immune (R) (7,8). It is assumed that when an

62

individual is symptomatic and infected, the progression from exposed stage (E) to becoming

63

infected and infectious (I) occur at the rate α . The model considers three clinical stages of

64

infections: mild, severe and critical (9) (refer to as I1 , I 2 , I3 onwards) (10). Each infection stage

65

of an individual has two possible outcomes: recovery and progression towards next stage leading

66

to death. Let γ 1 , γ 2 , γ 3 be the recovery rates at each of the three infectious stages respectively

67

and let ρ1 , ρ2 be the progression rates from I1 to I 2 and from I 2 to I3 respectively. While let δ

68

be the transition rate of the death (D) an individual at I3 . Let θ1 , θ2 , θ3 be the respective

69

transmission rates at the three stages I1 , I 2 , I3 of the model.

These expected ratios can further be used to determine the number of under reported cases under

91

the following assumptions:

92

i.

The model is formulated as a system of differential equations and its output represents the

93

expected values of each quantity. Further, as the stochastic events are not considered

94

therefore it cannot be assumed that the epidemic will extinct even for the very low values

95

Also, the model does not report the expected variance in the variables, which can

96

sometimes be large.

97

ii.

All individuals have equal transmission rates and equal susceptibility to infection.

98

iii.

Individuals must pass through stage before reaching stage and only the individuals at

99

critical stage die.

Despite close monitoring, there are chances of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection (11). This

105

paper incorporates the possibility of such infections by assuming that all the individuals

106

progressing from E to I can be categorized as either asymptomatic or symptomatic. Let π be the

107

proportion of individuals with asymptomatic infections such that they progress to I 0 from the

108

stage E, whereas (1 − π ) be the proportion of symptomatic individuals that progress to I1 from

109

the stage E. Thus the asymptomatic exposed class can be categorized into two sub-classes

110

namely E0 (no symptoms and no transmission) and E1 (no symptoms but transmit at the rate θ E )

111

with the rate of exit being α0 & α1 from each sub class respectively. It is pertinent to note that E1

112

represents the pre symptomatic class where delayed symptoms are observed relative to when an

113

individual actually got infected with COVID-19.

114

Assuming that the asymptomatic infections cannot progress to severe stages and have a

115

transmission rate θ0 , let γ 0 be the recovery rate of such individuals. Furthermore, all the

116

transmission rates are modified to incorporate the seasonality factor σ (t) = 1 + ε cos(2π (t-ϕ ))

117

where ε ∈ [0,1] is the relative amplitude of seasonal oscillation and ϕ ∈ [−∞, ∞] is the phase that

118

determine the peak time (in years) relative to starting time. The customized SEIR model is thus

119

given as:

S ′ = − (θE E1 + θ1 I1 + θ2 I 2 + θ3 I3 )Sσ (t)

We considered the impact of intervention and control measures on the spread of COVID-19 with

125

Given the intensity of the COVID-19 pandemic, where the most developed countries are falling

126

short in allocating appropriate medical facilities to all COVID-19 patients, an under-developed

127

country such as Pakistan has to be very cautious and concerned about optimizing its almost non-

128

existent healthcare facilities relative to its population size. In this regard, it becomes important to

129

analyze the health care capacity along with the COVID-19 estimates and predictions. The

130

analysis is based on the indicators such as hospital beds (per capita), ICU beds (per capita) and

Predicted COVID-19 cases of Pakistan by clinical outcome

136

Figure 1 (Fig 1: Predicted COVID-19 cases of Pakistan by clinical outcome ) shows the

137

progression of the epidemic in Pakistan, displaying the changes in the expected number of

138

individuals who are susceptible, exposed, infected and removed as per the modified SEIR model.

139

As the infected cases first experience an asymptomatic phase (incubation period) followed by an

140

infected phase that varies in intensity, the Infected individuals have been further categorized into

141

infected-asymptomatic; infected-mild (I1); infected-severe (I2) and infected-critical (I3) whereas

142

the Removed category has been sub-divided into recovered and dead depending upon the end

143

result of the infection. Using the R0 = 3.2 and r = 0.17, it is predicted that the inflection

144

point/peak is expected to fall on the 117th day (21st June, 2020) in Pakistan. The rate at which the

145

infection would be spreading according to this model is reflected by T2, which would be 4.1

146

days. The total susceptible population would be 43.24 million, exposed individuals would be

147

almost 32 million, asymptomatic cases would be 13.13 million, mildly infected 30.64 million,

148

severely infected slightly more than 6 million and critical cases would be around 967,000 in

149

number. By that time, almost 760,000 fatalities of infected critical would have taken place.

the severity of the infection with and without an intervention being implemented to control the
spread of the infection. With the intervention in place, the numbers of symptomatic infected
individuals (I1+I2+I3) are expected to be almost 20 million while without intervention; this
number rises to a maximum of almost 38 million at the peak of the epidemic. Note the change in
R0 as it moves from 3.174 without the intervention to a value of 2.8338 with any intervention.
Also noteworthy is the change in doubling time, which increases to 5 days upon implementation
of intervention instead of 4 days without intervention depicting the accelerated spread without
any control measures in place.

165

Almost 5 million deaths could be expected without intervention keeping the Case Fatality Rate
(CFR) of Iran of 3.6 as the standard, which can be reduced to 4.39 million deaths if interventions
are being implemented to control the spread (Fig 3: Reduction in predicted COVID-19 deaths of
Pakistan after intervention ).

COVID-19 cases versus healthcare capacity of hospital beds in Pakistan

167

Figure 4 (Fig 4: COVID-19 cases versus healthcare capacity of hospital beds in Pakistan) shows

168

the number of COVID 19 infections in comparison with the healthcare capacity of Pakistan. If

169

we can flatten the curve to a level below the dashed grey line, the healthcare system will be

170

capable of managing the cases with ideal healthcare facilities, the grey line representing the

171

healthcare capacity of Pakistan.

172

More than seven million individuals with critical and severe infections would need

173

hospitalization while hospital beds are available for only 26,500 individuals at present.

174

COVID-19 cases vs healthcare capacity of ICU beds in Pakistan

175
176
177
178

More than 1 million patients would need ventilation and intensive care and considering the
number of ICU beds available, the current available capacity of ICUs is around 0.01 per capita to
cater to the needs of one million patients (Fig. 5: COVID-19 cases vs healthcare capacity of ICU
beds in Pakistan).

179

More than 1 million patients would need ventilators along with intensive care and considering
the current number of ventilators, only 0.02 per capita would be available (Fig 6: COVID-19

Discussion

184

Our results show how the susceptible cases would increase over time along with expected

185

number of deaths. These figures look a bit exaggerated when compared to the reported data. But

186

they have similar results and trends for this pandemic done for other countries currently

187

experiencing some of the highest numbers of cases and deaths. As the recovered increase, the

188

susceptible population goes down. The country’s peak is however yet to be seen(15–17). Our

189

results of with and without intervention show a small impact of an intervention ( nearly 10

190

million less cases) as compared to number of expected cases, in reducing transmission of

191

diseases with “r” = 0.17 dropping to r=”r” = 0.15 with intervention. This small reduction with a

192

single intervention has been well documented (18). Timely interventions could reduce the

193

expected cases almost by half, and the expected load on the health system’s capacity, which is

194

quite limited. This could be possible only by introducing appropriate interventions for reducing

195

community transmission by social distancing, identifying cases and contacts by sufficient

196

number of tests for isolating the contacts/suspected cases in quarantines and treatment of cases

197

under suitable infection control conditions taken care of by healthcare personnel protected by

198

personal protective equipment (PPE). The severe infected cases would need hospitalization while

199

those in critical condition would require ventilators and care in Intensive Care Units (ICUs)(19–

200

23). Flattening of the curve and bringing it down with recommended interventions could not only

201

compensate for the limited capacity of the ICUs’s capacity and need for ventilators, it would also

202

improve the efficiency and preparedness of the system in saving lives(18,24,25).

203

Conclusion and Recommendations

204

We conclude that Pakistan’s COVID 19 outbreak is yet to see its see its peak probably towards

205

the third week of June 2020. The cases and admissions in emergency and critical care would

206

compromise the working of the health system. Timely implementation of the prudent

207

interventions would minimize the morbidity and mortality due to the pandemic and would

208

support the weak health system in responding to the outbreak. Pakistan need to invest in the

209

resilient health system and robust pandemic preparedness in place to address control measures

210

for a pandemic as large and devastating as COVID 19.

Limitations and strengths

212

Our results are based on assumptions and subsequent predictions based on modeling. These may

213

not be accurate. The mathematical models can guide and inform of a magnitude of disease or

214

event. It is imperative that the policy makers may make their own informed judgement in the

215

best interest of providing timely preventive and curative healthcare. The study’s strength lies in

216
