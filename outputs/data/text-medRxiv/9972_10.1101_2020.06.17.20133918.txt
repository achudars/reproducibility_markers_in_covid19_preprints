Abstract
Background: Previous research on infectious disease has revealed that infection risk as well
as the severity of diseases is related to income and poverty. In this study we investigate if
unemployed persons have a higher risk to become hospitalized with a COVID-19 diagnosis
compared with employed persons.
Methods: We used routine data on hospitalizations in a study population of 1,298,416persons
between the ages 18 and 65 who were enrolled in a German health insurance and who were
active on the labour market (either employed or unemployed). Hospital diagnosis of COVID19 (ICD-10-GM U07.1 and U07.2) were reported on a daily basis from 01.01.2020 to
04.06.2020. We studied if the rate of persons hospitalized with a COVID-19 diagnoses differed
by employment situation. Logistic regression models comparing employed with short- and
long-term unemployed were calculated adjusting for age and sex.
Results: In total, we observed 1,311 persons who were hospitalized, corresponding to a rate of
100.98 cases per 100.000 in our study population. Rates varied between the groups in different
employment situations with lowest rates for employed and highest for long-term unemployed.
Odds ratio for a hospitalization was 1.84 (1.64 - 2.07) for long-term and 1.18 (0.75 - 1.85) for
short-term unemployed compared with employed persons.
Conclusion: The results are in line with earlier (mainly ecological) studies from the USA and
Great Britain which found social inequalities in hospitalization risk. The fact that differences
exist in Germany, a country with a universal health care system, indicates socioeconomic
differences in the COVID-19 pandemic exists across countries.

Introduction
Socioeconomic differences are found for most diseases (e.g. diabetes, respiratory diseases,
coronary heart disease or depression) where people in more advantaged socioeconomic
positions (SEP; usually measured on the basis of income, education and occupation) are
healthier than their disadvantaged counterparts (1, 2). Studies also confirmed socioeconomic
differences for various infectious diseases, including the H1N1 pandemic in 2009/2010 and
seasonal influenza (3-10). In these studies, a disadvantaged socioeconomic position was both
associated with risks of infection and severity of the disease (i.e. hospitalization, need of
intensive care, and mortality).
These findings are in line with a currently growing number of studies from the US and England
that report socioeconomic difference in the COVID-19 pandemic (for an overview see (11) or
(12)). A recent study from New York (13), for example, compared the number of SARS-CoV-2
infections between neighborhoods and found that numbers were generally higher in more
deprived neighborhoods than in rich areas (same for COVID-19-related hospitalization and
mortality) (14). The same pattern became obvious across England in an analysis by the Office
for National Statistics (ONS) that compared number of COVID-19 deaths between more than
32.000 areas and their level of deprivation (measured by the national index for multiple
deprivation). In addition to these studies (which are based on ecological data with different
levels of aggregation) a small number of recent studies also rely on individual data. Analyses
of the UK biobank data, for example, show associations between low income and the
probability of hospitalization (15), and between educational qualifications and SARS-CoV-2
infections (16). Furthermore, official individual data from the ONS revealed clear differences
of COVID-19 mortality by occupational positions (17).
Whether theses inequalities exist for other countries (with other welfare and health care
systems) is unknown, largely because national health monitoring of several countries does not
consider any indicator of socioeconomic position, or because nationwide indicators of regional
deprivation are not available on a level of small areas (18). It is the core objective of the present
paper to help filling this gap of empirical evidence for Germany, a country where the pandemic

was accompanied by a comparatively lower number of infections, as well as lower fatality rates
up till now (19). We will focus on severe cases requiring hospitalization and their associations
with unemployment. Unemployment is related to health in several ways, e.g. via psychosocial
stress or poverty-related unhealthy behavior and is a known risk factor for acute and chronic
diseases (20, 21). As underlying health conditions increase the likelihood of a severe COVID19 disease that requires hospitalization, we assume that unemployment increases the
likelihood of COVID-19 hospitalization. To study this association, we rely on individual level
data from a German health insurance with information on 1.298.416 insured men and women.
As an indicator of a disadvantaged socioeconomic position we use information on whether
individuals receive any form of unemployment benefits (see Methods for details).

Methods
Population
Our study uses data from the German statutory health-insurance, namely the “AOK
Rheinland/Hamburg”. This is one of the largest health insurances carrier in Germany for
individuals living across Rhineland (western part of the state North Rhine-Westphalia) and
Hamburg. For this study, we rely on data of 2,799,119 persons who were insured at any time
during the observation period from 01.01.2020 to 04.06.2020 and applied the following
restrictions: First, we restricted the analyses to men and women between the ages of 18 and 65
at the beginning of the observation period (to avoid an age-bias). Second, we restricted the
analyses to individuals who were active on the labour force. This both includes people who are
currently working and those who are unemployed but healthy enough to be available for work.
Finally, we excluded students, retired persons (incl. those in disability retirement), and
persons who were neither employed nor job-seekers (e.g. non-working partners of employed
insured). As of 11 June 2020, these restrictions leave us with a group of 1,298,416 individuals
(573,863 women, 724,553 men) who were active on the labour market at the beginning of the
observation period (either employed or unemployed), and who were between the ages 18 and
65.

Measures

COVID-19 hospitalization: People who are insured via the German statutory health insurance
system have free access to hospital care in case of medical need. In case of hospitalization the
responsible doctor records main and secondary diagnoses and this data are transferred to the
insurance on a daily basis. Hospitalization due to COVID-19 is indicated by the international
WHO ICD-10-GM code U07.1 (laboratory confirmed) and U07.2 (symptom based). In the
infrequent case that more than one hospitalization was reported, we only consider the first
hospitalization. During the observation period of the present study 418 patients were
hospitalized with a U07.1 diagnosis and 893 with a U07.2 diagnosis. For the analyses,

“caseness” was defined if either type of diagnosis was recorded (1,311 cases). We also conducted
additional sensitivity analyses, where all findings were recalculated with confirmed cases
(U07.1) only.

Employment situation: As part of its routine data collection, the health insurance also collects
information on the legal employment situation of their members using a standardized coding
system. This allows to distinguish between “regularly employed”, “short term unemployed”,
“special benefits for low-income employees/job-seekers”, and “long-term unemployment”. A
regular employment means that the insured person is working either as an employee or as a
self-employed. Short-term unemployment means that the insured person is a job-seeker who
receives benefits from the regular German unemployment insurance (about 60% of the
previous income, called “ALG I”). For unemployed persons who do not find a new job within a
defined period (see discussion) a special welfare system exists which provides a more restricted
unemployment benefit (not calculated on the basis of previous income; called “ALG II”). A
fourth category are low-salary workers or short-term unemployed with an income below a
minimum threshold who additionally receive benefits from the “ALG II” system (called
“Aufstocker” or “Ergänzer” in Germany). By definition, the reception of unemployment benefit
is strongly related to a lower income, specifically in case of long-term unemployment and must
be considered as a reliable and valid indicator of poverty risk and a disadvantage
socioeconomic position for the active working population.

Additional Variables: The analyses also included age and sex, mainly as possible confounders
in multivariable regression models.

Data protection and ethics
Data are part of the routine data collection of hospitals and insurance carriers. The sample was
completely pseudonymized preventing any de-pseudonymization by small subgroups for each
analytical variable. The evaluation of the data was carried out exclusively by the AOK
Rhineland/Hamburg that owns the data. Only descriptive/statistical results were made

available, which do not allow any conclusions about the insured persons. The analyses plan
was approved by the data protection office of the AOK Rhineland/Hamburg.

Statistical methods
A simple analytical approach was applied. The cumulative incidence of hospitalization due to
COVID-19 during the observations period was the binary outcome in a logistic regression
model. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated comparing – for the main
analyses – persons in employment as a reference population with the other employment
situation groups. The outcome has a low incidence and fulfills the rare disease assumption.
The odds ratios should therefore approximate relative risks closely. All calculations were
performed using SAS 7.15.

Results
The study population of 1,298,416 insured persons included slightly more men than women
(55.8% men, see Table 1). The large majority was employed (72.2%), and most unemployed
were long-term unemployed. Short-term unemployment and special benefits were less
common. In total there were 1,311 cases of hospitalization with a COVID-19 diagnosis. This
corresponds to a crude rate of 100.97 cases per 100,000 in the study population. The rate of
hospitalization was generally higher among men and among unemployed, with highest rates
of hospitalization for long-term unemployed.

The results were confirmed in multivariable regression models that also included age (linear
and squared) and sex (see Table 2). In details, the adjusted model shows that the odds for being
hospitalized was 1.84 times higher for long-term unemployed compared to employed persons
(references group). Compared with employed persons odds were also higher for short-term
unemployed (1.18 times higher) and special benefit recipients (1.31 times higher).

A separate analysis for men and women shows that findings are consistent for both genders,
specifically in case of long-term unemployment (see Table 3). Slight differences were observed
for short-term unemployment (stronger association for women) and for special benefit
recipients (stronger associations) in men. These latter findings, though, deserve more detailed
analyses (e.g. inclusion of interaction term) to draw conclusion about gender differences.

Discussion
In this study of around 1,3 million German health insured we found a gradient in the risk of
hospitalization with a COVID-19 diagnoses in short- and long-term unemployed compared
with gainfully employed persons. This finding is in line with findings from previous epidemic
outbreaks such as the H1N1 pandemic in 2008 and with recent reports from the COVID-19
pandemic (11, 12, 14, 17, 22-24). Reliable data on COVID-19 is still limited to a small number
of countries and this first report from Germany – a country with universal welfare and health
care access – adds new evidence for the existence of a social gradient in infectious disease
including COVID-19.
While the evidence of health inequalities in the COVID-19 Pandemic is growing, one important
challenge is to understand the reasons for these inequalities. Based on a framework by Quinn
and colleagues, three potential explanations can be distinguished (22, 25): First, different
living and working conditions may lead to inequalities in exposure to the virus (22). For
example, ongoing studies confirm that people in more advantaged socioeconomic positions
work less frequently in occupations with a high exposure risk. Similarly, people with lower
income are more likely to the live in adverse environments (including crowded housing
conditions or possible exposure in public transport). A second explanation refers to
inequalities in vulnerability. Underlying health conditions are more frequent among
socioeconomically disadvantaged groups, thus, leading to increased risk of infections and
severe health outcomes (26, 27). Likewise, recent studies highlight the role of environmental
pollution (e.g. air pollution) and their impact on underlying health conditions (28). It seems
likely that disadvantaged population groups rather live in areas where pollutions levels are
high (29). A third explanation are Inequalities in care. These include comparatively limited
access to medical care (e.g. difficult access to medical facilities (30) or - as shown in a USAmerican study - less frequent opportunities for testing in disadvantaged areas (31)), but also
differences in utilization (e.g. delayed symptom awareness and later help seeking behavior
(32)). Exploring these potential pathways (and their relative importance for different outcomes
and indicators of SEP) will surely be part of future studies.

For the present study, we assume that a higher vulnerability due to underlying health
conditions is a plausible link. The prevalence of chronic conditions such as cardiovascular
disease and of behavioural risk factors like smoking or obesity is higher for unemployed
persons in many countries (21, 33) including Germany (34). Those conditions are important
risk factors for a severe progression of a SARS-CoV-2 infection and higher rates among the
unemployed may explain our findings (35) . Regarding a differential exposure no data exists
comparing workers with unemployed populations. Possibly, though, the risk of infection may
be even lower for unemployed because of their lower mobility (i.e. commuting) and the fact
that they are not exposed to the virus through social contacts with colleagues, customers or
patients during work. It was not possible to account for differences in infection risk per se in
this analyses because data was not yet available and future investigations combining risk of
infection and risk of severe diseases are needed. The third explanation (inequalities in care)
may be less important in our case. The German health care systems offers universal access to
both ambulatory and hospital care. Utilization of health care, however, could have played a
role as data from Germany shows that poor people avoid the utilization of health care – unless
universal access – more often than more affluent persons (30, 36).

Strengths and Limitations
We were able to study the complete population of insured people of the insurance carrier who
meet the inclusion criteria which guarantees a high internal validity of the sample. The large
number of observations and the reporting of diagnosis on a daily basis must be considered as
further a strength of the analyses. Our measure of unemployment is also based on official
standardized records which meant that the reliability of the main exposure variable was high.
Yet, the present study has important limitations and calls for future studies. First, we used data
from only one statutory insurance carrier for people living in specific regions of Germany, while
there are several other carriers in Germany. Our study population may therefore be selective.
Specifically, it is well-known that the health insurance we have used in this study does
historically over-represent persons with unemployment. This does surely prevent to draw
conclusions about the composition of the labour force in Germany (e.g. percentage of
12

unemployed). But it is unlikely that it affects the reported associations between unemployment
and hospitalization. Second, our study relies on data and an observation period that covers an
early period of the COVID-19 pandemic with rather low number of infections from January to
March 2020, and we may question if findings will be even stronger once the Pandemic has
progressed. Next, administrative data includes only limited information on socio-demographic
and socio-economic position.
An important limitation is the lack of information on diagnosis of COVID-19 treated in
outpatient care. It is well documented that the majority of persons with a COVID-19 diagnosis
is not hospitalized and it must be expected that a large number of COVID-19 diagnosis was
unmeasured in our study and no conclusions about overall infection rate can be made. Missing
information on the timing of the diagnosis is also a problem. Detection bias may have occurred
as unemployed are more often hospitalized due to other chronic conditions and that diagnosis
were more likely to be made in the hospital as part of routine care. Thus, future analyses also
need to consider different outcomes, such as infection risk, use of intensive care or mortality
among those who are infected.
Another limitation is that we used a relatively simple modelling approach (logistic regression
with cumulative incidence as an outcome) which does not allow to account for the (small)
number of persons who died for other reasons than COVID-19 during the observation period
or who changed their employment situation.
Finally, it was not possible to adjust for the duration of unemployment as we defined
unemployment using official coding of insurance status. In Germany, short-term unemployed
receive benefits from the unemployment insurance, while long-term unemployed are enrolled
in another system of benefit. The time after which a person switches from short- to long-term
is legally defined and dependent of age and duration of the payment of contributions to the
unemployment insurance. It lasts between 6-24 Months and there is therefore a certain
heterogeneity within the groups.
In conclusion, this study delivers first empirical evidence of differences in COVID-19
hospitalization by employment situation for Germany. If further supported by future studies
with alternative indicators of socioeconomic position together with different outcomes of

morbidity (incl. risk of infection, risk of intensive care) and mortality, this underlines the
importance of socioeconomic factors. These factors should be considered – together with age
and underlying health conditions – as important factors to identify high-risk groups and to
develop infection control measures (18). In addition, our study highlights the importance to
improve the availability of data in Germany and to collect information on socioeconomic
factors to allow for studying socioeconomic difference during the COVID-19 pandemic.
