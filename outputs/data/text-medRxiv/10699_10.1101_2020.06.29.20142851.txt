Abstract
Following the onset of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic throughout the world, a large fraction of the global population is or has been under strict measures of physical distancing and
quarantine, with many countries being in partial or full lockdown. These measures are imposed
in order to reduce the spread of the disease and to lift the pressure on healthcare systems. Estimating the impact of such interventions as well as monitoring the gradual relaxing of these
stringent measures is quintessential to understand how resurgence of the COVID-19 epidemic
can be controlled for in the future. In this paper we use a stochastic age-structured discrete
time compartmental model to describe the transmission of COVID-19 in Belgium. Our model
explicitly accounts for age-structure by integrating data on social contacts to (i) assess the impact of the lockdown as implemented on March 13, 2020 on the number of new hospitalizations
in Belgium; (ii) conduct a scenario analysis estimating the impact of possible exit strategies
on potential future COVID-19 waves. More specifically, the aforementioned model is fitted to
hospital admission data, data on the daily number of COVID-19 deaths and serial serological
survey data informing the (sero)prevalence of the disease in the population while relying on a
Bayesian MCMC approach. Our age-structured stochastic model describes the observed outbreak data well, both in terms of hospitalizations as well as COVID-19 related deaths in the
Belgian population. Despite an extensive exploration of various projections for the future course
of the epidemic, based on the impact of adherence to measures of physical distancing and a
potential increase in contacts as a result of the relaxation of the stringent lockdown measures, a
lot of uncertainty remains about the evolution of the epidemic in the next months.

Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), a pathogenic infectious agent, which was initially identified in Wuhan (China), where several
patients presented with pneumonia after developing symptoms between December 8, 2019 and January 2 [1]. COVID-19 was officially declared a pandemic by the WHO on March 11, 2020. More
than 6 million confirmed cases and more than 380,000 deaths were reported globally by June 1,
2020, of which 58,000 confirmed cases and 9,500 deaths occurred in Belgium [2].
In line with other EU countries, the Belgian government issued a travel notice advising against
non-essential flights to China, excluding Hong Kong, on January 29. As of March 6, a travel ban
was issued for school trips to Italy. On March 10, Belgian authorities advised to cancel all indoor
events of 1,000 participants or more. Furthermore, physical distancing measures were taken with
companies being advised to allow their employees to work from home as much as possible. A closure
of all schools, cafes and restaurants was ordered as well as a cancellation of all public gatherings
as of March 13 at midnight. On March 17, the Belgian National Security Council announced additional measures to be taken, thereby imposing stricter measures of physical distancing, prohibiting
non-essential travel to foreign countries and within the own borders (i.e., only allowing people to
leave their homes to buy food or to go to work, at least when working in healthcare, transport or
other essential professions), closure of shops providing non-essential services with the addition of
penalties for everyone not abiding with the rules. A lockdown was imposed on Wednesday March
18 at noon. The borders were closed as of March 20. Throughout the epidemic, the government
continuously stressed the importance of measures of physical distancing and hygiene, thereby avoiding physical contacts, ensuring regular washing of the hands, coughing and sneezing in the inner
elbow, not shaking hands and staying at home when having COVID-19 related symptoms [3].
Upon having imposed very strict measures of physical distancing, including mobility restrictions and
school closure, a thorough investigation of different exit strategies is required to relax unsustainable

social life and economic constraints while maintaining control over pressure exerted on the health
care system. After a specific exit strategy is implemented, a careful monitoring of the outbreak is
necessary to avoid subsequent waves of COVID-19 infections.
Here we use a stochastic, discrete, age-structured compartmental model for COVID-19 transmission.
The model is contrasted to Belgian data on the daily number of new hospitalizations and deaths
prior and after mitigation strategies have been imposed. The model accounts for pre-symptomatic
and asymptomatic transmission. Age-specific data on social contacts is used to inform transmission
parameters [4] and serial serological survey data is incorporated in the model to inform the prevalence of past exposure to the disease [5]. The impact of the intervention measures as well as various
exit strategies upon relaxing lockdown measures are studied in the context of this model.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide specific details on the (stochastic) compartmental model, its parametrization and estimation of model parameters based on several data
sources. Moreover, we study the impact of intervention measures and subsequent exit strategies
on the spread of COVID-19. The results of fitting the stochastic model to the available data is
presented in Section 3. Furthermore, the impact of various exit strategies on the number of new
hospitalizations is visualized using an extensive scenario-analysis. Finally, in Section 4, we discuss
limitations and strengths of the proposed approach and we present avenues for further research.

Methodology
Mathematical compartmental transmission model

We use an adapted version of an SEIR mathematical compartmental model to describe COVID-19
disease dynamics. In this model, individuals are susceptible to infection when in compartment
S, and after an effective contact (between a susceptible and infectious individual) the susceptible
individual moves to an exposed state E at age- and time-specific rate λ(t), referred to as the force of
infection (with boldface notation representing a vector including age-specific rates). After a latent
period, the individual becomes infectious and moves to a pre-symptomatic state Ipresym at rate
γ. Afterwards, individuals either develop symptoms (state Imild ) with probability 1 − p or remain
completely free of symptoms (compartment Iasym , probability p). Asymptomatic cases recover at
rate δ1 . Symptomatic infections are either very mild and such cases recover at rate δ2 = δ1 (for
an age-dependent fraction of these individuals, represented by the vector φ0 ) or they move to a
state Isev at rate ω prior to requiring hospitalization (i.e., severe infection is defined as requiring
hospitalization). When severely ill, implying hospitalization, individuals move to state Ihosp with
probability φ1 , or become critically ill (IICU ) with probability 1 − φ1 . Hospitalized and critically
ill patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) recover at rate δ3 and δ4 with probabilities
{1 − µhosp (a)} and {1 − µicu (a)}, respectively, where µhosp (a) and µicu (a) represent the age-specific
case-fatality rates (i.e., probabilities of dying when severely ill and hospitalized on a general ward
or admitted to ICU). Hospitalized and ICU patients die at rate τ1 or τ2 with probabilities µhosp (a)
and µicu (a), respectively. A schematic overview of the compartmental model is given in Figure 1.
Individuals in the red compartments are able to transmit the disease.
The following set of ordinary differential equations describes the flows in the (deterministic version

where, for example, S = (S1 (t), S2 (t), . . . , SK (t))T represents the vector of number of susceptible
individuals in age group k = 1, . . . , K in the population at time t. A full account on the definition
of the different compartments and the notation used for the number of individuals therein can be
found in Table A1 in Appendix A. An overview of the different parameter definitions can be found
in Table B3.
The proposed age-structured compartmental transmission model consists of 10 age classes, i.e., [010), [10-20), [20-30), [30-40), [40-50), [50-60), [60-70), [70-80), [80-90), [90, ∞) with the number of
individuals in each age class obtained from Eurostat.

2.2

Social contact data and transmission rates

As mentioned previously, the infectious phase of COVID-19 disease is divided into two different
states: a pre-symptomatic state occurring before the end of the incubation period, followed by a
state in which individuals may either remain asymptomatic or develop (mild to severe) symptoms
(see Figure 1). Transmission of the disease is governed by an age- and time-dependent force of
infection. The age-specific force of infection in age group k = 1, . . . , K, denoted by λ(k, t), is
defined as the instantaneous rate at which a susceptible person in age group k acquires infection at
time t. Furthermore, the time-invariant transmission rate β(k, k 0 ) represents the average per capita
rate at which an infectious individual in age group k 0 makes an effective contact with a susceptible
individual in age group k, per unit of time. Consequently, the force of infection is defined as
λ(k, t) =

K
X

β(k, k 0 )I(k 0 , t),

k0 =0

where I(k 0 , t) denotes the total number of infectious individuals in age group k 0 at time t and β(k, k 0 )
can be rendered as
β(k, k 0 ) = qc(k, k 0 ),
when relying on the so-called social contact hypothesis [6]. This hypothesis entails that c(k, k 0 )
are the per capita rates at which an individual in age group k makes contact with an individual
in age group k 0 , per unit of time, and q is a proportionality factor capturing contextual and hostand disease-specific characteristics such as susceptibility and infectiousness. The (K × K)-matrix
C containing the elements c(k, k 0 ) is referred to as the social contact matrix describing mixing
behaviour within and between different age groups in the population. Social contact rates c(k, k 0 )
are estimated based on social contact data from Flanders (Belgium) collected in 2010 [7, 8, 4, 9].
We hereby assume that contact rates for Flanders can be used for all regions in Belgium.
In this manuscript, we rely on social contact matrices Csym and Casym estimated for symptomatic
and asymptomatic individuals, implying
βsym (k, k 0 ) = qsym csym (k, k 0 ) and βasym (k, k 0 ) = qasym casym (k, k 0 ),
defining transmission rates for both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, respectively (see Appendix C). Here, we assume that the relative infectiousness of symptomatic versus asymptomatic
cases is equal to rβ−1 = qsym /qasym . The age-dependent force of infection is defined as:
λ(t) = βasym × {Ipresym (t) + Iasym (t)} + β sym × {Imild (t) + Isev (t)} ,
where λ(t) = (λ(1, t), λ(2, t), . . . , λ(K, t)) written as a matrix multiplication with boldface notation
for vectors and matrices. Note that hospitalized individuals are assumed not to contribute to the
transmission process because of isolation.

2.3

Discrete time stochastic epidemic model

The spread of the virus is hampered by reductions in the number of contacts and changes in the
way contacts are made, either voluntarily or as a consequence of government intervention. These
time- (and age-) dependent behavioural changes introduce substantial uncertainty in the further
course of the outbreak and require stochastic model components to evaluate the effectiveness of the
intervention strategies and to make future predictions in terms of, for example, new hospitalizations. Moreover, stochastic epidemic models allow to determine the probability of extinction based
on multiple realizations of the model. Therefore, we amended the deterministic model hitherto
described into a discrete time stochastic epidemic model to describe the transmission process under
the mitigation strategies as highlighted hereabove.
Our chain binomial model, originally introduced by Bailey [10], is a so-called discrete-time stochastic alternative to the continuous-time deterministic model based on the health states and transitions
presented in Figure 1. The chain binomial model assumes a stochastic version of an epidemic obtained through a succession of discrete generations of infected individuals in a probabilistic manner.
Consider a time interval (t, t+h], where h represents the length between two consecutive time points
at which we evaluate the model, here h = 1/24 day. Let us assume that there are St (k) susceptible
individuals at time t in age group k, we expect St (k)p∗t (k) newly exposed individuals at time t + h,
i.e.,

Et+h
where It is the total number of infected individuals at time t and pt (k) represents the transmission
probability conditional upon contact between a susceptible individual in age group k and an infected
individual. The probability that a susceptible individual escapes infection (during a single contact
with an infected individual) is equal to qt (k) = 1 − pt (k), hence, assuming all contacts to be equally
infectious, the escape probability is qtm (k) in case the susceptible individual contacts m infectious
individuals. In this setting, the probability of infection p∗k (t) for a susceptible individual in age
group k = 1, . . . K can be obtained as:

Predictions based on the stochastic discrete age-structured epidemic model will account for two
sources of variability, namely (1) variability coming from the observational process reflected in
uncertainty about the model parameters; and (2) variability introduced by the stochastic process.
An overview of the fixed parameter values, sources (incl. literature), and distributional assumptions
are listed in Table B3 of Appendix B.

The basic reproduction number R0 for the proposed compartmental model can be obtained by
means of the next-generation approach [11]. More specifically, the basic reproduction number is
equal to the leading eigenvalue of the next generation matrix, i.e., R0 is

Note that the vector N ≈ S(0) denotes the population age distribution (i.e., the number of individuals in

N with the number of susceptible individuals S(t) at time t.

2.5

Intervention measures

Intervention measures mainly targeted the reduction of face-to-face contacts as an effective way of breaking
the transmission chains of COVID-19 disease. These measures have led to significant alterations in social
mixing patterns, hence, changing the trajectory of the dynamics of COVID-19. To assess the impact of these
measures, we utilize social contact matrices derived using the online SOCRATES tool [4], developed for social
contact data sharing and assessment of mitigation strategies, and including survey data for various locations,
i.e, home, work, school, transport, leisure and other places. The imposed measures have changed the contacts
made on these respective contact locations and altered disease transmission. Different social contact matrices
are considered to describe the data prior to the lockdown measures and those quantifying contact patterns
after the interventions taken. Different choices with regard to the reduction in social contacts are as outlined
in Table 1 and Appendix C.
Compliance to the intervention measures taken is assumed to be gradual and is therefore modelled in a

flexible way. More specifically, we consider a logistic compliance function
pc (t) =

exp[β0 + β1 (t − tI )]
,
1 + exp[β0 + β1 (t − tI )]

where tI is the time at which the interventions are initiated. The parameters associated with the compliance
function (β0 and β1 ) are estimated based on the available data.

2.6

Exit strategies

Following the intervention measures that the Belgian government imposed towards limiting the spread of
COVID-19 disease, well-tailored exit strategies are needed in order to enable individuals individuals to resume
their normal social life whilst protecting the health care system from unprecedented pressure leading to
unnecessary loss of lives. Here, we explore and compare possible approaches in lifting imposed measures.
The different aspects within the exit strategies are listed below:
• Progressive lifting of lockdown measures on key sectoral pillars of the economy that require physical
presence for workers/staff while keeping non-essential service providers closed. This will entail progressively re-adjusting the social contact matrices made at work, during travel/transport, and contacts at
other places.
• Gradual re-opening of schools. This will entail re-adjusting the contacts made at school. In line with
the exit strategies adopted in Belgium, various partial re-opening dates are considered and their joint
impact is explored.
• Opening social places like restaurants, retail stores and hotels. This will involve re-adjusting the social
contact matrices for those contacts made during leisure activities, work and transportation as well as
those made at other places.
Note that the aforementioned exit strategies cannot be looked at independently since, e.g., parents going
back to work will have to rely on childcare/schools to take care of their children. Therefore, we will refer to
exit scenarios rather than individual strategies in the remainder of the paper.

To assess the effectiveness of the individual exit strategies and combined scenarios, several comparisons will
be made as follows: each exit scenario will be compared to a (baseline) situation without changes, and with
each other. More details on the exit scenarios and the translation to the relative number of contacts compared
to the pre-pandemic situation are outlined in Table 2. The different scenarios presented in this table give
rise to a gradual relief of the lockdown measures taken, similar to the current strategy in Belgium:
Phase 1a – May 4: Although remote work remains the norm, business-to-business services and companies that are able to comply with physical distancing measures re-opened;
Phase 1b – May 11: Shops re-opened under strict requirements related to organisation of the work and
restricting access to the store to avoid overcrowding;
Phase 2a – May 18: Schools partially re-opened (first phase - selected grades in primary and secondary
schools);
Phase 2b – June 2: Schools partially re-opened further (second phase - pre-primary schools);
Phase 3 – June 8: Restaurants, bars, and cafes re-opened under strict measures including physical
distancing and a limited number of customers;
These comparisons were mainly made on the basis of the daily number of new hospitalizations and admissions
to the ICU. Furthermore, the implementations thereof in combination with the timing of holiday and school
periods will be studied to explore whether rebound effects will occur, i.e., whether deconfinement results in
subsequent COVID-19 waves.

Data and estimation procedure

In this section we briefly describe the parameter estimation procedure and different data sources that are
considered to fit the models.

2.7.1

Deterministic model

We first fit the deterministic version of the proposed compartmental model to the initial phase of the epidemic.
More specifically, we fit the model to the daily numbers of new COVID-19 hospitalizations (for all age groups
combined) starting from 1 March 2020 until 22 March 2020 (before intervention measures had an influence
on hospital admissions). We use a likelihood-based approach by assuming
!
K
X
 new
new
Yt ∼ Poisson
Ihosp,t (k) + Iicu,t (k)
,

where the realization yt of Yt is the observed total number of new hospitalizations across all age groups at
new
new
time (day) t (i.e., within the last 24 hours), and Ihosp,t
(k) and Iicu,t
(k) are the expected number of new
hospitalizations (without ICU) and ICU admissions at time t in age group k, respectively. These expected
numbers are obtained by numerically solving the set of ordinary differential equations. The aforementioned
procedure is used to obtain reasonable starting values for the model parameters in order to initialize the
MCMC sampler (see Section 2.7.4 in fitting the stochastic compartmental model to the available outbreak
data).

2.7.2

Stochastic model

Next to the social contact data used to inform the transmission parameters, three different data sources
are considered when fitting the stochastic compartmental model, namely (1) incidence data on the daily
number of new hospitalizations (until May 4) [12]; (2) incidence data on the daily number of new deaths
(excluding deaths in elderly homes) (until May 4) [12]; and (3) serial serological survey data collected during
the epidemic [5]. More specifically, the serological data is obtained from two data collections (30 March – 5
April, 2020 & 20 April – 26 April, 2020) within a prospective cross-sectional seroprevalence study and based
on residual sera obtained from individuals aged 0-101 years. Seropositivity of the samples is determined
based on a semi-quantitative ELISA test kit (EuroImmun, Luebeck, Germany) measuring IgG antibody
concentrations against S1 proteins of SARS-CoV-2 in serum (see Appendix D for more details).

where Yt,k and Zt,k represent the number of new hospitalizations and new deaths at time t in age group
k, respectively, relying on the assumption of equal age-specific mortality rates τ1 µhosp = τ2 µicu ≡ τ µ for
hospitalized patients on general and ICU wards. Since we do not have data on referral within hospitals, we
do not explicitly distinguish between hospitalized and ICU admitted patients in terms of hospital discharge
(including death), although the model is equipped to do so.
Moreover Wt∗ ,k represents the total number of seropositive individuals in age group k in a cross-sectional
serological collection of residual blood samples performed at time t∗ . All individuals tested in age group k
at time t∗ , denoted by nt∗ (k), have a probability πt∗ (k) (i.e., equal to the observed seroprevalence) to be
classified as seropositive accounting for sensitivity of the test psens (to ) as a function of time since symptom
onset and assuming perfect specificity of the test. The sensitivity of the test is assumed to follow a logistic
growth curve based on available information in the literature [13]. For more details, the reader is referred to
Appendix D.

2.7.3

Model initialization

The number of imported cases (and first generation(s) of infected cases through local transmission) is determined from the age-specific number of confirmed cases on 12 March 2020. More specifically, given a number
n0 (k) of confirmed cases in age group k, the expected number of imported cases in age class k equals


1
,
n0 (k)
1 − p(k)
where p(k) represents the asymptomatic fraction in age group k thereby assuming that confirmed cases solely
reflect the proportion of mildly and severely ill individuals. The introduction of the imported cases in the
system is presumed to take place on 1 March following the school holiday period.

2.7.4

Estimation

Model parameters are estimated using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach. A two phase method
is considered in which the first phase consists of an adaptive Metropolis-within-Gibbs (AMWG) [14, 15]
and/or adaptive mixture Metropolis-Hastings (AMM) algorithm [15] to achieve stationary samples that seem
to have converged to the target posterior distributions (stationarity is obtained after a maximum of 250,000
iterations). In the second phase, a non-adaptive Random-Walk Metropolis (RWM) algorithm [16] is used
to draw final samples from the posterior distributions. More specifically, 500,000 iterations were conducted
thereby retaining every 100th iteration after discarding an initial burn-in part of 250,000 iterations. An
overview of the different prior distributions is presented in Table B4 of Appendix B. In order to ensure
that plausible parameter values are obtained, logit- and log-transformations are considered depending on the
required range for the different model parameters.

Results

In this section, we show the results of fitting the stochastic compartmental model to the data at hand. First of
all, we study the fit to the data and the posterior distributions of the model parameters. Next, we investigate
the age- and time-varying (sero)prevalence derived from the model. Finally, we investigate the impact of
different exit strategies on the resurgence of the COVID-19 epidemic.

3.1

Baseline scenario accounting for mitigation strategies

Both the probability of experiencing an asymptomatic infection and the probability of having mild symptoms
upon contracting COVID-19, i.e., p and φ0 are assumed to be age-dependent. The latter is estimated using
a prior distribution based on current literature (see Tables B3 and B4 for more details). The relative
infectiousness of asymptomatic versus symptomatic individuals rβ is fixed at a value of 0.51 [17]. Other
model parameters are either fixed or estimated based on the available data (Table B3).
The best fitting model included social contact matrices with an 80% reduction of the normal work and
transportation contacts (α = 0.2 in Appendix C), with no school contacts and with 10% of the regular leisure
contacts and contacts related to other activities. In Figure 2, we graphically depict 25 stochastic realizations

and deaths are graphically depicted in Figure 3 for a selection of the 10 age categories.

3.2

Posterior distributions

In Table 3, we present summary measures for the posterior distributions of the model parameters including
the posterior mean, median, standard deviation and 95% credible intervals (CIs). The basic reproduction
number R0 at the start of the epidemic - prior to any government intervention - is estimated to be 3.344
with 95% CI (3.288, 3.398). On May 4, 2020 the effective reproduction number after the lockdown was
estimated to be 0.713 (95% CI: 0.708, 0.719). The time-dependent effective reproduction number Rt is
shown in Figure E3 of Appendix E. The posterior mean for ω is in line with estimates regarding the delay
distribution for hospitalizations [18] implying an average duration between symptom onset and hospitalization
of about 2/ω = 6.353 days (95% CI: 5.930, 6.802). Furthermore, the average length of the incubation and
−1
(asymptomatic/mild) infectious periods, ρ−1 and σasym
, are estimated to be 4.577 days (95% CI: 4.480, 4.672)
and 5.091 days (95% CI: 4.994, 5.192), respectively, similar to values reported in the literature (see Table B3).
For individuals experiencing severe symptoms, the average length of the infectious period, constrained due
to isolation in hospital, is limited to approximately 10.077 days (95% CI: 9.650, 10.531). Full compliance to
the intervention measures was obtained after 5 days (see Appendix E).
Boxplots of the marginal posterior distributions of the probability of hospitalization are presented in Figure 4.
The probability of hospitalization increases substantially with increasing age. A decrease in hospitalization
probability is observed in age class [80, 90) after which it increases again for individuals of age 90+. However,
the probability of hospitalization, as a proxy of disease severity, is likely time-dependent as well as biased for
the oldest age groups due to differential referral policy in elderly homes or end of life choices in the last will

3.4

Exit strategies

We performed short-term predictions of the dynamics of COVID-19 in the Belgian population through the use
of scenario analyses. In Figure 7, we show the impact of relaxing lockdown measures by increasing contacts
made by people at different locations. More specifically, we present stochastic realizations of the model to
predict the number of new hospitalizations under different scenarios with changes in contact behaviour as of
May 4, 2020 (Phase 1a, Scenarios S1–S3) and May 11, 2020 (Phase 1b). From May 4 onward, we presume
that work-related contacts will increase from 20% (baseline scenario - see Table 2) to 30% of the pre-pandemic
number of contacts at work (or transmissibility is reduced to an extent equivalent with the assumed reduction
in work-related contacts), and that the number of transport contacts and contacts during leisure and other
activities will increase respectively from 20% to 30% and from 10% to 20% of their pre-pandemic values. On
top of that, work, transport and leisure contacts stay constant (scenario S1) or increase to 40%, 40% and 30%
(S2) or 50%, 50% and 40% (S3) of the pre-pandemic values, respectively, from May 11 onward. Moreover, a
delay of one week is considered for each change in social contact behaviour (i.e., a full extent of all changes in
behaviour is reached on May 18, 2020). A small to moderate increase in the contacts at work, transportation
and during leisure (blue and purple scenarios) leads either to a complete reduction of hospitalizations or a
constant number of new hospitalizations over time. Only the most extreme increases in contacts give rise to
a resurgence of COVID-19 implying a second wave of COVID-19 infections (scenario S3 - orange lines).
A partial re-opening of schools as of May 18 (Phase 2a) is studied in detail in Figure 8. Work- and transportrelated contacts and contacts during leisure and other activities increase as of May 4. School-related contacts
are assumed to be 20% (S4 - blue lines), 40% (S5 - purple lines) or 60% (S6 - orange lines) of such contacts
prior to the epidemic. This increase in school-related contacts is imposed between May 18, 2020 and July
1, 2020. The start of the summer holiday on July 1, 2020 implies a reduction of all school-related contact
to 0%. A partial re-opening of schools in combination with a moderate increase in work, transportation and
leisure activities leads to a small to moderate increase in the number of new hospitalizations after lockdown
measures are relaxed.

schools are partially re-opened on May 18 and June 2, 2020 yielding 20% of school contacts as of May, 18

derived from Belgian mortality data [19]. In Figure 11, we show stochastic realizations under the baseline
scenario (without change in social contact behaviour after lockdown measures are relaxed) overlaid with new
data points after May 4, 2020 (black solid circles). In general, the stochastic model describes the observed
data well, even in the absence of changes in contact behaviour after intervention measures were relaxed.
Although the observed number of hospitalizations tends to remain constant, thereby deviating from a further
decrease thereof in the baseline scenario, no large differences between observed and predicted values are
found. Following the gradual relief of the intervention measures, no resurgence of the disease is noticeable to
date (end of June).

of the stringent measures, between May 18, 2020 and May 25, 2020. The overall weighted seroprevalence
was estimated to be 6.87% (95% confidence interval: 5.89%, 8.01%) (based on personal communication). In

Discussion

In this manuscript, we used a stochastic age-structured discrete time epidemic transmission model fitted to
daily hospital admission, COVID-19 related mortality data and serial serological survey data with regard to
SARS-CoV-2 antibody presence to describe and study COVID-19 disease dynamics in the Belgian population.
As age-specific heterogeneity has been proven to be of great importance in terms of transmission, clinical
presentation and mortality for COVID-19, our model explicitly accounts for such age differences informed by
age-specific data. Consequently, our model enables a more granular investigation of disease dynamics and
the impact of intervention measures targeting specific age groups. Model predictions of, for example, the
time-dependent prevalence in the population can be made for different age groups, which is especially relevant
to assess whether herd immunity levels are reached in age groups at the highest risk for severe disease.
Using this model, we evaluated the expected impact of the lockdown and exit strategies for the control
of COVID-19 transmission in the population. The basic reproduction number prior to lockdown was estimated to be 3.344 (3.288, 3.398) which is in line with estimates for the epidemic growth in Europe prior
to the implementation of nationwide intervention measures and epidemiological modeling in different countries [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25], based on recent meta-analytic results [26, 27] and on other modeling exercises
specifically tailored to the Belgian setting [28, 29]. Moreover, the intervention measures taken clearly flattened the epidemic curve followed by a progressive reduction of the number of (confirmed) cases over time
and the number of new hospitalizations. The decrease in average number of contacts implied a substantial
reduction in reproduction number Rt = 0.713 (95% CI: 0.708, 0.719) on May 4, 2020.
The proposed mathematical model is a ‘living’ model used for real-time modeling of the Belgian epidemic
and for long-term predictions focusing on, among other things, determining a purchase strategy for medical
supplies. Needless to say, the model is updated progressively as new data becomes available and extensions
towards improving the model and incorporating up-to-date information are considered in future research.
Although several scenarios have been displayed, the single scenario which will unfold in reality in the next
weeks and months is driven by unpredictable human behaviour and governmental decisions in case of a resurgence of the disease. Nevertheless, displaying and investigating a range of potential scenarios is crucial in
quantifying the impact of certain imposed changes, and of key importance to guide policy makers to shape
exit strategies.
Based on the various scenarios presented here, one can conclude that a small to moderate level of transmission in the upcoming months leads to an increased risk of having a large-scale resurgence of the disease later
on. In such a situation, a high number of new hospitalizations will be reported with a peak size which is
inversely related to the level of sustained transmission in the period preceding the wave of new COVID-19
infections. Lifting the stringent lockdown measures without adequate exit strategies put in place would inevitably have led to a large increase in the number of new infections as the population immunity is still too
low to rely on herd immunity (see, e.g., estimated seroprevalence in Figure 5). This signals an insufficient
depletion of susceptibles in order to prevent subsequent COVID-19 outbreaks in the future. Our scenario
analyses present both short and long-term predictions of new waves based on the current levels of population
immunity. However, to date, both the level of protection against infection in the presence of IgG antibodies
against SARS-CoV-2 as well as the extent of the (humoral and cellular) immune response in relation to the
symptoms of the infected person are still very unclear [5]. In the model, we assume that acquired immunity
after recovery lasts for the entire time period under study.
Our work suffers from several limitations. In our model, the reduction in transmission of COVID-19 is completely attributed to a reduction in social contacts rather than changes in transmissibility due to e.g., use
of masks, keeping distance when contacting persons, the use of antivirals [30], etc. However, since social
contact data collected during the pandemic was unavailable at the start of this project, we were unable to
disentangle these effects. In future work, we will use such social contact data collected in Belgium within the
EpiPose project [31] to quantify the impact of the lockdown and its relief on number of contacts made.
Second, in our model, pre- and asymptomatic individuals on the one hand and persons with mild and severe
symptoms (before hospitalization) on the other hand are presumed to have a similar level of infectiousness
thereby contributing in the same way to the transmission process. Patients suffering from severe disease probably reduce their contacts more than those with mild disease [32], but the associated reduction in contacts
may be compensated by greater infectivity per contact, as more severely affected patients are likely more
infectious (i.e., due to a higher viral load) [33]. Moreover the clinical presentation of the disease and disease
progression is not uniform with highly variable delay distributions between infection, symptoms, hospitalisa-

tion and death. For instance, some individuals with mild symptoms may enjoy a symptom-free intermediate
period after which (more severe) symptoms reappear, and immediate hospitalization may be required [34]. In
our model, isolation (and treatment) of hospitalized individuals is assumed to lead to a complete reduction
in ability to spread the infection. Nevertheless, the contribution of these nosocomial infections is believed to
be very limited.
The severe compartment in the stochastic model is used as a way to induce a non-exponential delay (Erlang
delay distribution) between time of first symptom onset and hospitalization. Faes et al. (2020) [18] showed
that the time between symptom onset and hospitalization is indeed non-exponentially distributed, albeit that
the best fitting distribution (i.e., a Weibull one) is difficult to incorporate in this modeling framework. As
important aspects of the transmission dynamics and the disease are still uncertain, some of the simplifications
made in the model will be revisited and updated as biomedical insights improve (e.g., regarding potential
seasonality in COVID-19 transmission). As a result of limited information with regard to hospital discharge,
the model is currently not able to directly predict the burden on hospital capacity. This will be particularly
relevant for surveillance of pressure on the healthcare system in future COVID-19 waves. However, based on
the model output in terms of new hospitalizations and information with respect to length of hospital stay,
an indirect calculation thereof is straightforward. In the current analyses, we did not distinguish between
hospitalization of individuals in elderly homes and individuals from the general population, nor between
deaths in hospitals and nursing homes, mainly due to the lack of detailed information to do so. Our model
therefore focuses on the general population. Next to that, we disregard potentially important factors such
as seasonality (i.e., induced by changes in temperature, humidity, exposure of the virus to ultraviolet light,
etc.) entailing an impact on social behaviour and transmission potential of the virus to an extent that is
largely unknown to date [35, 36]. Finally, in the scenario analyses presented in this paper, we assume that
no external re-importation of the disease in the population occurs, albeit that the stochasticity of the model
is able to account for this, at least to a limited extent.
Several mathematical approaches have been considered in the context of the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 epidemic in Belgium, all having different merits and limitations [29, 28]. For example, the individual-based
model by Willem et al. [29] enabled the direct study of contact tracing and case isolation as a control measure. The meta-population model by Coletti et al. [28] studied the impact of mobility on disease transmission.
This stochastic model enabled the detailed fitting to age-specific serology and incidence data using MCMC.
As there is no single best model to study all possible research questions related to the spread and control
of the disease, we compared model outputs and conclusions, as their predictions need continuous finetuning
and validation [37, 38]. In conclusion, predictions from our model are useful to inform subsequent serological
sample studies and to explore various exit scenarios with respect to disease transmission as an input for the
investigation of the economic impact of COVID-19 epidemics on society.

Model parameters

In this appendix, we provide a detailed overview of the different assumptions related to the transmission process and the change in behaviour upon (severe) symptomatic infection.

B.1

Susceptibility and infectiousness in children

Until recently, there was no (conclusive) evidence of differential infectiousness and/or susceptibility
to COVID-19 infection in children. Some authors claimed that no significant differences in viral
load were present between (symptomatic) children and adults, even after revising their work [1].
A re-analysis of these (initial) findings by Held and McConway and Spiegelhalter [2, 3], however,
clearly shows that children between 1 and 10 years old have on average only 27% (95% CI: 8-91%)
of the viral load of adults aged 20 years or more. For the mathematical model proposed here,
we do not differentiate between infectiousness and susceptibility in children as compared to adults
directly [4]. However, as children are presumed to be more likely to have a higher probability of being
asymptomatically infected (see Section B.2), and the relative infectiousness of asymptomatic versus
symptomatic individuals rβ is (assumed) equal to 0.51 [5], children are implicitly less infectious,
hence, contribute less to the transmission process relative to adults.

B.2

Age-dependent proportions of asymptomatic cases

The age-dependent proportions of asymptomatic cases, represented by the vector p, are based on
a study by Wu et al. (2020) [6]. More specifically, we use the age-specific relative susceptibility to
symptomatic infection reported by Wu et al. (2020) [6] to inform the proportion of asymptomatic
cases. In order to do so, we start from an overall age-weighted proportion of asymptomatic cases
in the Belgian population equal to 50% [6] implying that
p = (0.94, 0.90, 0.84, 0.61, 0.49, 0.21, 0.02, 0.02, 0.02, 0.02)T .
Although we are fixing the age-dependent proportions of asymptomatic cases in the model, we do

assumption of 50% of asymptomatic infections.
allow for differential probabilities of hospitalization through the specification of an age-dependent
probability of only having mild symptoms upon being symptomatic. The reason for this constraint
is the fact that based on the available data, we cannot disentangle the age-specific probability of
being asymptomatic from the probability of having mild symptoms.

φ1 (k) = 0.75 and φ0 (k) = 0.8, representing the probability of hospitalization conditional on having
severe symptoms and the probability of having mild symptoms in age group k, then the probability
of hospitalization in symptomatic individuals is equal to 0.2 × 0.75 = 0.15. Since we lack detailed

age-specific information about the relative proportions of ICU admissions as compared to the total number of hospitalizations, and data on referral between ICU and hospital wards throughout
hospital stay, we are not able to inform φ1 .

B.4

Case fatality rates

Age-dependent case fatality rates have been adopted from Riou et al. (2020) [8] which were estimated from outbreak data obtained in Hubei, China in the period January to February. In Table B2,
we present these age-specific case-fatality rates µ(k). In our analysis, these case-fatality rates are
taken to be equal for hospitalized individuals and critically ill individuals (i.e., µ(k) ≡ µhosp (k) =
µicu (k)), which also relates to the inability of disentangling hospitalization from ICU admission
based on the available data. In the stochastic model, however, we estimate these case fatality rates
µ(k) from the available mortality data and contrast them with the ones reported by Riou et al.
(2020) [8]. Due to the low number of deaths in young age categories, we assume that µ(1) = 0
and µ(2) = µ(3), comprising parameters to be estimated from the data. A complete list of model
parameters with reference values is presented in Table B3.

Social contact data
Baseline contact matrices

The contact matrices for the asymptomatic individuals (C asym ) is taken to be equal to the general
contact matrices collected in the Belgian survey in 2010–2011. Thus we assume that individuals
do not change their contact behaviour when being asymptomatically infected with COVID-19.
The overall contact matrix is the sum of the contact matrices encompassing contacts made at the
following locations: home, work, school, transportation, leisure and other places.
Thus C asym is obtained as follows:
C asym = C home + C work + C school + C leisure + C transport + C other
In Figure C1, we graphically depict the social contact matrix C asym in terms of the average number
of daily contacts for individuals of different age groups contacting each other. The contact matrices
for symptomatic individuals are obtained by re-scaling the matrix C asym in the respective locations
by the relative change in the number of contacts observed by Van Kerckhove et al. [34] during
the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic Influenza in England. Hence, we presume that social contacts are
adapted in a similar way in the Belgian population upon contracting the disease and experiencing
symptoms. Thus, C sym is defined as a weighted sum of the aforementioned contact matrices at
specific locations, i.e.,
C sym = C home + 0.09C work + 0.09C school + 0.13C transport + 0.06C leisure + 0.25C other

C.2

Intervention contact matrices

The contact matrices for the asymptomatic individuals during the lockdown depend on the intervention considered (see Table 1). The contact matrices made in all locations are changed except for
the one accommodating contacts made at home. The framework of assigning relative reductions to
the social contact matrices obtained at the different locations can be illustrated as follows:
C asym = C home + αC work + αC transport + βC school + ρC leisure + ρC other ,
where 1 − α represents the percentage of telework considered (people working from home and/or
who have stopped working), β represents the percentage of school contacts retained (hence, 0 in
case of school closure), ρ represents the fraction of contacts during leisure and other activities that

Serological survey data

We use serial serological survey data collected during two cross-sectional periods and based on
residual samples coming from 10 private laboratories [35]. Serological survey data is collected

at different cross-sectional sampling times and blood samples are tested for the presence of IgG
antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Consequently, individuals are classified as seronegative,
equivocal or seropositive based on their measured IgG antibody concentration against S1 proteins
of SARS-CoV-2 obtained from the EuroImmun semi-quantitative ELISA test kit (EuroImmun,
Luebeck, Germany). The age-specific seroprevalence is derived as the proportion of seropositive
individuals in each age class.
In order to relate the model-based prevalence of COVID-19 in the population to the observed
seroprevalence, we assume that the seroprevalence at calendar time t and age a is denoted by
π(a, t) and that IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 are detectable upon infection according to the
following logistic function:
psens (t0 ) = expit(β0 + β1 t0 ) =

exp(β0 + β1 t0 )
,
1 + exp(β0 + β1 t0 )

where psens (t0 ) represents the probability of having a sufficiently high IgG antibody concentration
to indicate past SARS-CoV-2 infection. The sensitivity of the diagnostic tests is considered to be a
function of the time since symptom onset t0 (at least in the presence of symptoms), i.e. sensitivity
of the diagnostic testing procedure as a function of time since onset of symptoms presuming a
sensitivity of zero prior to symptom onset. In this modeling approach, we rely on estimates of
the sensitivity curve obtained from the literature [36], reaching a sensitivity of 99% 14 days after
symptom onset, albeit that sufficient information regarding the sensitivity of the specific diagnostic
test in use is currently lacking. In this exercise, specificity of the test is presumed to be very high,
implying no false positive test results.
The total number of individuals of age a at the time of data collection t (expressed as days since
the start of the epidemic) in the population that will test positive can be written as:
np (a, t) =

onset at time t and the number of individuals of age a entering the asymptomatic state at time t,
respectively. Although still uncertain to date, asymptomatic individuals are presumed to be similar
to symptomatic ones in terms of their humoral immune response following exposure to the SARSCoV-2 virus.

More recently, Borremans et al. (2020) [37] showed that IgG antibody detection probabilities
increase with time since symptom onset, implying that nearly all (98–100% of) individuals had
detectable antibodies by day 22–23 after symptom onset. Although detection probabilities are
estimated based on different assays, these authors showed that all assays exhibit comparable growth
rates except for a slower increase in antibody levels for IgG ELISA-Spike assays. As a sensitivity
analysis, we show the impact of altering the logistic sensitivity curve psens (t0 ) (black line) with a
delayed 99% detectability of IgG antibodies in line with the aforementioned findings by Borremans
et al. (2020) (red line in Figure D3) in Appendix E.

The compliance to the intervention measures is modelled using a logistic curve which is depicted in
Figure E2. Full compliance to the measures is reached after approximately 5 days.

Time-dependent reproduction number

In Figure E3, we display the effective reproduction number over time with a 95% credible interval
as a red shaded area around the posterior mean. The reproduction number decreased from 3.334
prior to the lockdown to a value of 0.713 on May 4, 2020.

E.4

Mortality rates

Age-specific mortality rates are presented in Figure E4. Mortality rates are considered to be equal
for persons admitted to ICU and to a regular hospital ward as no distinction could be made between
referrals within hospitals, nor between deaths in ICU and hospital wards. Needless to say, mortality
rates increase by age with the highest mortality rate in the 90+ age category.

E.5

Infection fatality rates

Infection fatality rates (IFRs) are calculated based on the observed number of deaths by age group
and the estimated total number of infections in a specific age group (thereby accounting for asymptomatic infections). Note that the model disregards the number of deaths in elderly homes (as this
is considered to be a separate COVID-19 outbreak which is not accommodated in the considered
approach), thereby potentially underestimating the IFRs in the highest age groups, at least if the

Sensitivity to transmission potential of children

As a sensitivity analysis, we studied the impact of varying the infectiousness of children on the final
results. As mentioned in Section B.2, the role of children is still unclear albeit that some authors
have tried to investigate the transmission potential of children. More specifically, children present a
smaller viral load upon contracting the infection [1, 2, 3, 38, 39]. Furthermore, some authors claim
that children have a reduced transmissibility [40, 41], albeit that it remains unclear whether this
is due to a lower probability of presenting symptoms and differential transmissibility for asymptomatic versus symptomatic cases or directly by lowering infectiousness for both asymptomatic and

We present stochastic simulation results based on a 50% reduction in the infectiousness of symptomatic and asymptomatic children in age category [0, 10). In Table E1, posterior descriptive
measures are summarized for the model parameters. The posterior means are quite in line with a
small increase in the basic reproduction number R0 (3.418, 95% credible interval: 3.368, 3.468). In

Figures E7 and E8, we depict similar exit scenarios as the long-term scenarios S7–S12 presented in
