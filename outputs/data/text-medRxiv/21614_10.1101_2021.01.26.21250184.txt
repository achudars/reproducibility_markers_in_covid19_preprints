Key Points
Question: What are the public’s views on government or private use of immunity “passports” to
selectively lift COVID-19 restrictions?
Findings: Views are divided and do not vary substantially according to political affiliation or
many demographic factors. Support is greater among men but lower among Hispanics and those
who believe that immunity privileges would harm the social fabric of society.
Meaning: Social consensus will be difficult to achieve on the appropriateness of immunity
privileges.

ABSTRACT
Importance: Discovery of effective vaccines and increased confidence that infection confers
extended protection against COVID-19 have renewed discussion of using immunity certificates
or “passports” to selectively reduce ongoing public health restrictions.
Objective: To determine public views regarding government and private conferral of immunity
privileges.
Design and Setting: National on-line survey fielded in June 2020. Participants were randomly
asked about either government “passports” or private “certificates” for COVID-19 immunity.
Participants: Adults from a standing panel maintained for academic research, selected to
approximate national demographics.

Main Outcomes/Measures: Level of support/opposition to immunity privileges, and whether
views vary based on: government vs. private adoption; demographics; political affiliation or
views; or various COVID19-related attitudes and experiences.
Results: Of 1315 respondents, 45.2% supported immunity privileges, with slightly more
favoring private certificates than government passports (48.1% vs 42.6%, p=0.04). Support was
greater for using passports or certificates to enable returns to high-risk jobs or attendance at large
recreational events than for returning to work generally. Levels of support did not vary
significantly according to age groups, socioeconomic or employment status, urbanicity, political
affiliation or views, or whether the respondent had chronic disease(s). However, estimates from
adjusted analyses showed less support among women (Odds Ratio, 0.64; 95% Confidence
Interval, 0.51 to 0.80), and among Hispanics (0.56; 0.40 to 0.78) and other minorities (0.58; 0.40
to 0.85) compared with whites, but not among blacks (0.83; 0.60 to 1.15). Support was much
higher among those who personally wanted a passport or certificate (75.6% vs 24.4%) and much
lower among those who believed this would harm the social fabric of their community (22.9% vs
77.1%).
Conclusions and Relevance: Public views are divided on either government or private use of
immunity certificates, but, prior to any efforts to politicize the issues, these views do not vary
along usual political lines, nor by characteristics that indicate individual vulnerability to
infection. Social consensus on the desirability of an immunity privileges programs may be
difficult to achieve.

Earlier in the COVID-19 pandemic, the idea of immunity certifications (or “passports”) was
introduced as a means to lift public health restrictions on recovered patients who might be
considered safe from reinfection or further viral spread.1,2 Despite some thoughtful support,3,4
the idea quickly encountered substantial opposition, based partly on concerns about social
fairness.5,6 Scientific uncertainty over the extent of acquired immunity was another chilling
factor. However, there have been extraordinarily few documented reinfections to date7,8 and
more recent studies indicate that even mild infection confers some sustained viral defense.9,10
This evidence, coupled with new rounds of restrictions as COVID-19 cases surge, is likely to
prompt renewed calls for easing restrictions on those who can establish likely immunity.
Tailoring restrictions according to individual risk could help to defend public health restrictions
from legal or public opposition.11 Also, as vaccines are rolled out, easing restrictions on the
vaccinated could encourage vaccination and speed returns to normalcy.
Even without official exemptions, there are signs that immunity certification may advance
through private initiative.12 Firms are developing smart technologies that allow recovered or
vaccinated individuals to verify their presumptively safe status.4 Airlines are considering
immunity certification to promote safer travel. And employers face economic and regulatory
pressures to triage higher-exposure functions.1 We sought to gauge public views about
government or private use of immunity certification.
Methods
We conducted a national survey in late June 2020 using the on-line survey panel, Prolific
Academic, which has demonstrated good reliability and validity in prior studies.4,13,14 We

selected 1315 respondents using a quota system that approximated nationally-representative
demographics by sex, age groups, and race-ethnicity (eTable 1).
The survey randomly split respondents into two arms -- one that described government adoption
of an immunity “passport” and the other private adoption of an immunity “certificate.” Each arm
explained the immunity privilege concept as follows: ”if an antibody test shows that you have
had the disease, you could receive an '[immunity passport/certificate]' which would let you
engage in more activities.”
Support for the concept was assessed following questions about the fairness, acceptability, and
potential drawbacks of using passports/certificates for various specified purposes. Respondents
also reported experiences with COVID-19 and related restrictions, along with residential
location, employment, socio-economic status, health, and political affiliations. The full
questionnaire appears in the Appendix.
We calculated counts and proportions to describe support for immunity privileges, by
demographic subgroups and by attitudinal and experiential variables. Respondents indicated their
degree of support or opposition on a 6-point Likert scale; we dichotomized this variable,
classifying “Strongly support”, “Support” and “Somewhat support” responses as support.
Finally, we used multivariable logistic regression to estimate associations between support and
demographic characteristics.
Statistical analyses were performed using Stata, version 14.1.
Results
Respondents were fairly evenly split in their support for immunity privileges (Figure 1). Nearly
half (45.2%) supported them, with more in favor of private certificates than government

passports (48.1% vs 42.6%, p=0.04). Respondents were more likely to view passports or
certificates as fair for determining who may return to high-risk jobs or attend large recreational
events than for returning to work generally (Figure 1).
The overall level of support for immunity privileges was similar across most demographic
groups examined (Table 1). Estimates from the adjusted analysis indicated less support among
women (Odds Ratio, 0.64; 95% Confidence Interval, 0.51 to 0.80), and among Hispanics (0.56;
0.40 to 0.78) and other minorities (0.58; 0.40 to 0.85) compared with whites, but not among
blacks (0.83; 0.60 to 1.15). Support did not vary significantly according to political affiliation or
characteristics that mark vulnerability to COVID-19, such as age, chronic disease, low
socioeconomic status, and customer-facing employment.
However, supporters and opposers differed in several, but not all, of the attitudinal and
experiential factors shown in Figure 2. For example, respondents who reported that they wanted
a passport or certificate were substantially more likely to support the concept (75.6% vs 24.4%).
On the other hand, those who believed these programs would harm the social fabric of their
community (22.9% vs 77.1%) or that it may be years before we have a “safe and effective
vaccine generally available” (37.7% vs 62.3%) were substantially more likely to oppose.
Discussion
This nationally-representative survey, conducted in the early Summer of 2020, as the first round
of COVID-19 restrictions was lifting, found the public was more-or-less evenly divided on the
appropriateness of using immunity privileges programs to selectively allow people to return to
normal, pre-pandemic activities. Overall, 55% of respondents opposed the idea, although fewer
opposed certifications authorized by the private sector than by government. Levels of support did

not vary across many of the characteristics that frequently mark divergent views about social and
public health policies.
In mid-2020, political affiliation was not associated with support for or opposition to immunity
privileges. This finding is particularly noteworthy considering how deeply politicized so many
aspects of COVID-19 public health policy have been. One explanation is that the “immunity
passport” idea has not yet become sufficiently aired for political camps to form a position that
could influence the broader public. Another explanation is that, prior to any efforts to politicize
the issue, immunity programs were seem as having pros and cons that cross political lines:
conservatives may welcome the potential boost to economic recovery while lamenting identityspecific control of civil liberties; progressives may resent giving selective privileges, but may
also recognize the potential for those who have fared worse—minorities and the poor—to gain
the most.
Men were significantly more likely to support immunity privileges, as were non-Hispanic whites
and blacks. But systematic differences were not evident across other demographic groupings we
examined. Nor did we find that vulnerability to COVID-19—based on older age or lower health
or socioeconomic status—explained support for immunity privileges.
On the other hand, certain attitudes were strongly associated with opposition to immunity
privileges. For example, those who thought that immunity privileges would harm the
community’s social fabric were more likely to oppose them. Somewhat counterintuitively,
opposers were also more likely among those who, at the time of this survey, expected a longer
wait for a safe and effective vaccine. That alignment of views could reflect a desire for greater
social solidarity.

Our results are limited by the standard validity and reliability concerns that attend on-line
attitudinal surveys, although the panel we used was developed for academic research. We fielded
this cross-sectional survey in mid-2020, when the pandemic was at a different stage, and
respondents’ beliefs may have changed since then. Among the potentially influential changes
since the original survey, which could affect current views, is the increasing widespread
availability of immunity via a safe and effective vaccine, which additionally makes it much less
likely that people might self-infect in order to acquire immunity.
Also, respondents’ views may have been sensitive to assumptions about the accuracy of
immunity testing or completeness of immunity protection. We probed this latter issue through a
supplemental randomized experiment and found significantly higher support following an
assurance that immunity protection is virtually (99%) certain, compared with no information on
this point, but not when the assurance indicated lower levels of certainty (80%, 90%) (eTable 2).
Today more than 50 million Americans may be immune to SARS-CoV-2 from prior infection.15
The roll-out of vaccines in 2021 will gradually confer strong protection to many millions more.
Meanwhile, the Winter spike in COVID-19 cases is forcing shut-downs across the country. This
confluence will inevitably reignite debate about selectively relaxing restrictions. The public
appears divided over whether doing so is appropriate, although, in mid-2020, prior to efforts to
politicize the issue, the division did not appear to be along typical political and social lines.
