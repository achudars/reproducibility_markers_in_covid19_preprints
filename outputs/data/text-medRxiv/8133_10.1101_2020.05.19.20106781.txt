ABSTRACT
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the cellular entry point for severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) – the cause of COVID-19 disease. It has
been hypothesized that use of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibiting medications in
patients with hypertension, increases the expression of ACE2 and thereby increases the risk
of COVID-19 infection and severe outcomes or death. However, the effect of RAS-inhibition
on ACE2 expression in human tissues of key relevance to blood pressure regulation and
COVID-19 infection has not previously been reported.
We examined how hypertension, its major metabolic co-phenotypes and antihypertensive
medications relate to ACE2 renal expression using information from up to 436 patients
whose kidney transcriptomes were characterised by RNA-sequencing. We further validated
some of the key observations in other human tissues and/or a controlled experimental model.
Our data reveal increasing expression of ACE2 with age in both human lungs and the kidney.
We show no association between renal expression of ACE2 and either hypertension or
common types of RAS inhibiting drugs. We demonstrate that renal abundance of ACE2 is
positively associated with a biochemical index of kidney function and show a strong
enrichment for genes responsible for kidney health and disease in ACE2 co-expression
analysis.
Collectively, our data indicate that neither hypertension nor antihypertensive treatment are
likely to alter individual risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or influence clinical outcomes in
COVID-19 through changes of ACE2 expression. Our data further suggest that in the
absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, kidney ACE2 is most likely nephro-protective but the
age-related increase in its expression within lungs and kidneys may be relevant to the risk of
SARS-CoV-2 infection.

INTRODUCTION
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – the recent viral pandemic with high mortality rates
and overwhelming burden on the healthcare systems globally. The virus gains entry into
human host cells upon binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) – a molecule
operating both as the main transmembrane receptor for the virus1,2 and a component of
renin-angiotensin system (RAS) – the key blood pressure (BP) regulating cascade3,4.
Interestingly, elevated blood pressure (hypertension) has been implicated as a main comorbidity and a potential risk factor for more severe clinical outcomes of COVID-195,6, and
speculation mounted that this may be due to commonly prescribed antihypertensive
medications targeting RAS [i.e. angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) or
angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) antagonists (ARB)]. Indeed, RAS blockers have been
hypothesised to enhance SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cells and/or promote the organ
damage in patients with COVID-19 as a result of ACE2 up-regulation7–10. However, evidence
for a direct effect of hypertension or RAS blockers on ACE2 expression in human tissues
has remained elusive, largely because of the paucity of large gene expression datasets with
matching clinical information. As the inhibition of the ACE2-SARS-CoV-2 interaction gains
traction as a potential treatment strategy for COVID-1911, an urgent understanding of how
the key COVID-19 comorbidities alter ACE2 expression in human tissues is necessary to
gain new mechanistic and therapeutic insights.
Herein, we selected the human kidney as a tissue of key importance to BP regulation, RAS
and COVID-19 and examined how hypertension (as well as its major metabolic cophenotypes) related to ACE2 expression7,12–15. We further explored if RAS blockers were
associated with changes in ACE2 expression taking advantage of information on
antihypertensive treatment in patients whose kidney transcriptomes were characterised by
RNA-sequencing. Finally, we validated some of the key observations in other human tissues
and a controlled experimental model using kidneys from spontaneously hypertensive rats
(SHRs) treated with ACE-I and ARB.
METHODS
Human kidney tissue collections
We used 436 human kidney samples collected from patients recruited into five studies
[TRANScriptome of renaL humAn TissuE (TRANSLATE) study16–21, its extension –
TRANSLATE-T study18, moleculAr analysis of human kiDney-Manchester renal tIssue
pRojEct (ADMIRE)20, molecular analysis of mechanisms Regulating gene Expression in
Post-ischAemic Injury to Renal allograft (REPAIR)20 and Renal gEne expreSsion and
PredispOsition to cardiovascular and kidNey Disease (RESPOND)20] in our discovery
resource. In TRANSLATE, ADMIRE and RESPOND studies, the samples were collected
from patients with unilateral kidney cancer – the specimen was taken from unaffected by
cancer part of the kidney immediately after elective nephrectomy16–21. TRANSLATE-T and
REPAIR collected pre-implantation kidney biopsies18 from deceased kidney donors prior to
the organ transplantation18,20. The secured tissue samples from all the studies were
immersed immediately in RNAlater or snap-frozen for the purpose of further molecular
analysis. We used an additional cohort of 98 individuals from the NIH-supported Tissue
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)22,23 as a replication resource for some of our kidney gene
expression analyses. We only used samples collected as “companion normal tissue
specimen” – those taken from healthy (unaffected by cancer) part of the kidney after the
surgery23, in line with the tissue collection strategy used by TRANSLATE study. All patients
were of white-European ethnicity.
Phenotypes
For the purpose of this project we extracted the relevant demographic and clinical
information (age, sex, body weight index, height, hypertension, diabetes, renal function) from
the discovery projects’ databases. We calculated body mass index by dividing weight (in kg)
by height2 (in m). In TRANSLATE and RESPOND studies, hypertension was defined as BP

values ≥140/90 mmHg (measured on at least two separate occasions) and/or being on
pharmacological antihypertensive treatment, as reported elsewhere17. Diabetes was defined
as either self-reported history of diabetes and/or being on hypoglycaemic medications19. In
ADMIRE, TRANSLATE-T and REPAIR studies, information on history of hypertension and
diabetes was recorded by the respective recruitment teams based on the available hospital
documentation. All hypertensive patients had information on whether they were managed
using BP lowering medications. A total of 72.4% of hypertensive patients on
pharmacological antihypertensive treatment had further detailed information on the
prescribed antihypertensive medications. In these patients we allocated each of the
prescribed antihypertensive medication into one of the following antihypertensive classes:
ACE-I, ARB, beta-blockers (BB), calcium channel antagonists (CCA), diuretics (DRT) or
others. Serum levels of creatinine were measured by modified kinetic Jaffe method
(calibrated to an IDMS reference measurement procedure) in 310 individuals. In calculating
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) we used CKD-EPI equation24, as reported
before19. Only basic demographic information (age, sex) were available for patients recruited
in the kidney replication resource (TCGA)19.
Genotyping and genetic principal components
In the discovery resource, kidney DNA was extracted using Qiagen DNeasyBlood and
Tissue Kit, and then hybridised to the Infinium® HumanCoreExome-24 beadchip array, as
reported before18,20,21. In TCGA, DNA was extracted from blood samples using QiAAmp
Blood Midi Kit (CGARN, 2016) and hybridised with probes on the Affymetrix SNP 6.0 array23.
We applied the same quality control filters to genotyped variants and individuals in all data
sets. In brief, we excluded autosomal genotyped variants based on the following criteria:
genotyping rate <95%, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) P<1x10−3, minor allele frequency
(MAF)<5%, position duplicated variants18,20. Prior to further analyses we removed individuals
with: genotyping rate <95%, heterozygosity rate outside ±3 standard deviations from the
mean, cryptic relatedness to other individuals, inconsistent sex information and non-whiteEuropean genetic ancestry18,20. Genotype principal components (PCs) were calculated using
PLINK v1.90b6.225. In the calculation we firstly removed ambiguous genetic variants (C/G or
A/T) with MAF>0.4. Genetic variants in 24 high linkage disequilibrium (LD) regions were
removed thereafter. We then used “--indep-pairwise” in PLINK to further prune variants in LD
setting window size of 1000bp, step size of 50 variants and r2 cut-off threshold as 0.05. We
calculated the genotype PCA for each of the discovery and replication resource, using “--pca”
in PLINK.
Kidney transcriptome profiling
We used RNeasy kits (Qiagen) to extract RNA from kidney tissue in 75% of samples in our
discovery resource. The remaining samples were subjected to an RNA extraction using
miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). In the replication resource, kidney RNA was extracted from
snap-frozen samples using a modification of the DNA/RNA AllPrep Kit (Qiagen), as reported
before (https://brd.nci.nih.gov/brd/sop/show/1450).
Sequencing libraries were generated from 1µg of extracted RNA using Illumina TruSeq polyA protocol. Libraries were then sequenced using either 100 bp reads (on an Illumina HiSeq
2000) or 75 bp paired-end reads (on an Illumina NextSeq or HiSeq 4000) producing an
average of 32 million paired reads and 5.5 Gb per sample. The base calling and sequence
quality were evaluated using FastQC26 on all sequenced libraries. We used Kallisto to
quantify the expression of genes at a transcript level [in transcripts per million (TPM)]27 and
then summed them to generate gene-level expression values, as reported elsewhere20. For
the purpose of our downstream computational analyses we selected genes with the
expression >TPM of 0.1 and the read count ≥6 (in at least 20% of kidney samples, within
each study)20. All sequenced samples were examined using several quality control filters
including: number of total reads (>10million reads), D-statistic test (a normalised measure of
within tissue sample inter-correlation, D≤5), sex compatibility check (consistency between
the reported sex and expression of sex-specific genes, based on XIST and expression of

RPS4Y1, KDM5D, DDX3Y, EIF1AY and USP9Y), verification of sample code based on
comparing DNA base calls obtained from RNA-sequencing using GATK and DNA genotype
calls and visual inspection of principal component plots of processed TPM data.
After applying these quality control filters, 21,203 renal genes (common for all studies in the
discovery and replication dataset) were retained for the downstream analyses. Prior to the
downstream analyses, gene expression data that passed the quality control underwent
normalisation. The expression values underwent first log-transformation [natural logarithm of

followed
by

(http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/aroma.light.html),
as

20
elsewhere . The quantile-normalised data were then standardised using rank-based inverse
normal transformation18.
Kidney single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis
Single-cell RNA-sequencing data from the human adult kidney was obtained from Young et
al.28 and re-analysed20. Briefly, we used data from 41,778 normal kidney cells, combined this
with literature-curated markers to annotate cell types and used Seurat29 to determine cell
type marker genes and a two-dimensional t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (tSNE) of the expression data20. We identified 23 distinct cell clusters. These were then
grouped into 8 renal cell types, 5 immune cell types and 1 unidentified by their respective
expression of canonical cell type markers. The 8 renal cell types were then grouped and
visualised by their localisation to each nephron segment.
Kidney ACE2 co-expression analysis
The ACE2 co-expression analysis employed multivariate regression to determine the
association between each expressed kidney gene and ACE2; models were adjusted for age,
sex, diabetes, hypertension, three genetic PCs and surrogate variables automatically
inferred by the “sva” R package in line with Tukiainen et al.30. This analytical pipeline was
applied to the discovery and replication data sets separately. The crude P-values were then
adjusted by permutation-based resampling. The crude t-statistics were scaled by the mean
and standard deviation of t-statistics from 1,000 permutations of the data, then the P-values
were re-calculated and the FDR-based adjustment for multiple testing was applied. A gene
was considered as co-expressed with ACE2 if the following criteria were met: (i) FDR <0.05
in the discovery data, (ii) FDR <0.05 in the replication data and (iii) consistent direction of
association with ACE2 in discovery and replication.
Gene set overrepresentation for REACTOME pathways and gene ontology cellular
compartment annotation was performed by the PANTHER classification system31 employing
Fisher’s exact test. Official gene symbols for all ACE2 co-expressed genes were uploaded
as an input list to the PANTHER analysis and were compared against all human genes. The
kidney disease and BP gene sets were built from a combination of GWAS catalog
(https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/) association data for phenotypes “Blood pressure”
(EFO_0004325) and “Kidney disease” (EFO_0003086) and manually curated genetic
associations from the GWAS literature. Their enrichment among ACE2-coexpressed genes
was examined using Fisher’s exact test and all human genes as a comparator.
Renal expression of ACE2 – association analyses
We used ordinary least square linear regression models to examine associations between
normalised renal expression of ACE2 [or sex-related “control” genes (XIST, RPS4Y1)] as
dependent variables with each of the selected demographic/clinical variables – age, sex,
body mass index (BMI), hypertension, diabetes and eGFR as independent parameters;
separately in the discovery and the replication resource (where available). All the regression
models were adjusted for (i) first three genotype PCs – to adjust for the population structure,
(ii) a set of demographic (age, sex) and clinical (i.e. BMI, diabetes; where appropriate)
parameters – to minimise their potentially confounding effects on the dependent variable and
(iii) surrogate variables (SVs) – to remove the batch effects such as those generated by
variation in recruitment centres, DNA and RNA processing protocols, and times of

sequencing32. The SVs also remove the variation from unmeasured and/or technical
cofounders, including but not limited to the sources of tissues, effects of differences in cell
types33. The SVs were calculated for each model separately. The optimised number of
surrogate variables for each model was determined by the “sva” package32, in line with
previous studies30,34. The results from the analysis of the association between renal
expression of ACE2 and sex in the discovery and replication resources were combined
using an inverse-variance fixed-effect meta-analysis35.
The analysis of the association between renal expression of ACE2 and each of the
antihypertensive class was adjusted for age, sex, BMI, diabetes, first three genotype PCs
and SVs, and further corrected for the inter-correlation between the drug classes (using “gee”
R package). The absolute normalised and adjusted differences in renal ACE2 between
those who were taking a specific class of antihypertensive medications versus those who
were not on any medication were converted into fold differences using the exponential
values of the corresponding estimated coefficients. The correction for multiple testing was
calculated using “qvalue” package36,37 in R.
Expression of ACE2 in other human tissues – Genotype-Tissue Expression project
(GTEx)
We also explored the gene expression information from Genotype-Tissue Expression project
(GTEx) – an NIH-sponsored publicly available resource38. We extracted information on
normalised ACE2 expression from the transcriptome of the lung as well as the following
human tissues of relevance to hypertension/BP regulation: adrenal gland, visceral adipose
tissue, subcutaneous adipose tissue, left ventricle, atrial appendage, tibial artery, coronary
artery and aorta38. The number of post-mortem donors who contributed transcriptomic
information for these tissues was 515, 233, 469, 581, 386, 372, 584, 213 and 387
(respectively). Analysis of association between ACE2 expression and age as well as sex
were completed separately in each tissue using a multivariate regression model and the
“Limma” R package39. All models were adjusted for age, sex (as appropriate), BMI, sample
ischaemic time, death classification on the Hardy scale30, 3 genetic PCs and a tissuespecific number of SVs inferred by the “sva” R package. The nominal P-values were further
adjusted by FDR.
Kidney expression of ACE2 and eGFR – replication analysis in Nephroseq
To replicate the association between kidney ACE2 expression and eGFR, we examined
renal gene expression data sets curated by Nephroseq (www.nephroseq.org). Included were
gene expression studies on human renal tissue (tubulointerstitium) with a minimum of 10
informative individuals in the analyses. Five datasets from four studies [including European
Renal cDNA Bank (ERCB), Ju et al. – discovery and validation40, Sampson et al.41,
Woroniecka et al.42] were eligible; in ERCB transcriptome profiling was conducted using
RNA-sequencing, in the other studies – by microarrays. For each of the studies we
computed Pearson’s correlation coefficient for renal tubulointerstitial expression of ACE2
against eGFR. To determine the overall correlation between renal ACE2 expression and
eGFR we then combined the information from all studies with the Olkin-Pratt fixed-effect
meta-analytical approach (using the R package Metacor). Heterogeneity was examined
using Cochran’s Q test.
Kidney expression of ACE2 in rats treated with perindopril and losartan
To examine ACE2 expression in response to losartan and perindopril, we first sourced 6week old inbred male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) from the Animal Resources
Centre (Canning Vale, Western Australia). At 10 weeks old, SHR were implanted with
minipumps (Alzet model 2004, Durect Corp Cupertino, California) for infusions of either the
vehicle (normal saline), losartan (7.5 mg/kg/d) or perindopril (1 mg/kg/d). SHR received
infusions for 4 weeks, after which treatment ceased at 14 weeks old. SHR were sacrificed at
14 weeks old (n=4-10) under general anaesthetic with isoflurane and ketamine. The kidneys
were removed, decapsulated and dissected; renal cortices were subsequently submerged in

RNAlater stabilisation solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific), frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored
at -80°C. RNA was later extracted from the isolated cortices using the mirVana™ miRNA
isolation kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and quantified using the NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo
Fisher Scientific). To account for technical variation, gene expression of ACE2 was
normalised against housekeeping gene (GAPDH) using quantitative real-time PCR. We then
performed one-way ANOVA and unpaired student t-tests on ΔCt values using GraphPad
Prism 8 to assess variability between groups and calculated fold change from ΔCt values
equalling to 2-ΔΔCt with ΔΔCt = ΔCt(sample) – ΔCt(control).
Bioethics
The human studies adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki and were approved/ratified by the
appropriate Bioethics Committee of the Medical University of Silesia (Katowice, Poland),
Bioethics Committee of Karol Marcinkowski Medical University (Poznan, Poland), Ethics
Committee of University of Leicester (Leicester, UK) and the University of Manchester
Research Ethics Committee (Manchester, UK). Informed written consents were obtained
from all individuals – for the deceased donors from TRANSLATE-T, the consent was
obtained from the members of the family. All animal experiments were approved by the
University of Melbourne Animal Ethics Committee and were conducted in accordance with
the Australian Code of Practice for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes.
RESULTS
Renal expression of ACE2 – insights from kidney transcriptome profiling, coexpression analysis and single-cell experiments
We first processed RNA-sequencing-derived gene expression profiles of 436 kidneys from
our discovery resource (TableS1) and uncovered 21,203 kidney genes. The key RAS genes
showed from strong to moderate expression in the kidney with ACE2 in the top 20% of the
renal gene expression signal distribution (Figure1A). The analysis of human kidney singlecell data28 revealed a cell-type specific pattern of ACE2 expression, with proximal tubule
cells showing the strongest expression signal (Figure1B). Our co-expression analysis
conducted in both the discovery and replication data sets uncovered 47 kidney genes tightly
correlated with ACE2 (Figure1C). Twenty-three (49%) of these genes showed expression
specific to proximal tubule at the single-cell level (Figure1C). The ACE2-co-expressed genes
were enriched for amino acid metabolism (P=1.89x10-5), mitochondria (P=1.92x10-17,
Figure1C), kidney disease (P=1.88x10-10) and weakly for BP regulation (P=0.0225,
Figure1C). Taken together, these data show that ACE2 is a highly abundant kidney gene
with a cell-type specific pattern of expression in the proximal tubule and functional overlap
with metabolic processes of key relevance to human health and disease.
The effect of sex and age on ACE2 expression in the kidney and other human tissues
ACE2 is encoded by a gene on the short arm of the X chromosome (Xp22.2) and was
reported to escape X chromosome inactivation (XCI) in some human tissues30. To examine
whether there is the XCI-driven sex bias in the renal expression of ACE2, we compared
male and female gene expression profiles from 436 kidneys within the discovery data set
and 98 renal tissue samples from the replication resource. We first confirmed that the sexspecific X-chromosomal and Y-chromosomal gene controls (XIST and RPS4Y1, respectively)
showed the expected sex-specific pattern of expression in kidneys from both gene
expression data sets (FigureS1A). Our discovery analysis showed that women have
approximately 1.36-fold higher expression of ACE2 in the kidney when compared to men
(P=8.6x10-9) (FigureS1B). We then replicated this observation in an independent population
– TCGA (P=8.86x10-5) (FigureS1C). In the combined analysis of 534 samples women had
approximately 1.4-fold higher level of renal ACE2 expression when compared to men
(FigureS1D). We then examined how sex influences ACE2 expression in the lung and
several other relevant tissues from the GTEx project38. In some tissues (i.e. subcutaneous

adipose tissue) ACE2 showed higher expression in women than men, while in others (i.e.
aorta) there was the opposite pattern of sex-specificity in ACE2 expression (Figure1E).
Age showed a positive association with the renal expression of ACE2 in the discovery data
set (8.67x10-16) (Figure1D). The directionality of the age-renal ACE2 relationship was
consistent in the replication resource but the association did not reach the level of statistical
significance (P=0.2540), possibly because of the smaller number of samples in TCGA.
Similar to the findings in the kidney, we detected a statistically significant positive
association between age and the expression of ACE2 in lungs from the GTEx (P=1.62x10-4,
FigureS1E). In the majority of the examined human tissues the direction of the association
between age and ACE2 expression was consistent with that observed in the kidney and the
lungs (Figure1E).
Collectively, these data show that ACE2 exhibits a heterogeneous tissue-dependent sexspecific expression pattern in human tissues and that expression of ACE2 tends to increase
with age in the kidney, lungs and the majority of tissues of relevance to cardiovascular
system.
Analysis of association between renal expression of ACE2, hypertension and other
clinical phenotypes of potential relevance to COVID-19
Taking advantage of clinical information available in our discovery resource we examined
whether hypertension and other comorbidities/phenotypes of potential relevance to COVID19 (including diabetes, BMI, eGFR) were associated with renal expression of ACE2. Our
analysis, conducted in 269 hypertensives and 167 normotensives, revealed no association
between human hypertension and ACE2 expression in the kidney (P=0.6008) (Figure1F,
TableS2). An additional sensitivity analysis restricted to 215 individuals who were not on
antihypertensive treatment confirmed these findings (P=0.1212) (FigureS1F, TableS2).
Neither diabetes nor BMI showed an association with kidney expression of ACE2 (P=0.8445
and P=0.8843, respectively) (FigureS1G, TableS2). However, we detected a significant
positive association between renal expression of ACE2 and eGFR (P=2.41x10-5) (Figure1G,
TableS2). We then replicated this finding through a meta-analysis of correlation between
tubulointerstitial ACE2 expression and eGFR using 315 renal transcriptomes from an
independent
resource
–
Nephroseq
(P=1.19x10-17)
(FigureS1I,
TableS3,
www.nephroseq.org). Taken together, these data show that renal expression of ACE2 is
positively associated with a biochemical index of kidney function but not with hypertension or
other cardiovascular/metabolic comorbidities.
The effect of antihypertensive medications on the renal expression of ACE2 –
analysis of human and rat kidneys
Of 269 hypertensive individuals in our discovery tissue resource, 221 were on
antihypertensive treatment. We first confirmed that antihypertensive therapy (as a simple
binarised variable) was not associated with expression of ACE2 in the kidney (P=0.4176).
We then allocated each prescribed antihypertensive medication into one of six categories
consistent with the six main BP lowering drug classes, in 160 individuals with detailed
information on their pharmacological therapy (FigureS1H). After replacing the binarised
antihypertensive treatment indicator with the variables indicative of the six classes and after
correction for inter-correlation between the drug classes, we re-examined if renal ACE2
expression was associated with individual antihypertensive classes. There was a nominally
significant association with ARB but no significant associations after the correction for
multiple testing (Figure1H). We then corroborated these results in SHR treated for 4 weeks
with an ACE-I and an ARB for 4 weeks (Figure1I). Collectively, these data show that there is
no association between commonly prescribed antihypertensive medications and renal
expression of ACE2.
DISCUSSION
Despite widespread speculation that hypertension (and especially drugs that inhibit RAS)
would be associated with increased expression of ACE2 and that this is turn, lead to

increased susceptibility to COVID-19, our study revealed no effect of either on the renal
expression of ACE2. We also showed that while age and sex changed the abundance of
ACE2 in human tissues, common metabolic comorbidities of hypertension, including
diabetes and obesity index were not associated with renal expression of ACE2. Finally, we
revealed enrichment for amino acid metabolism, mitochondria and kidney disease in the
renal ACE2 co-expression analysis and demonstrated a positive association between renal
ACE2 expression and a biochemical index of kidney function in the absence of the SARSCoV-2 infection.
It is widely acknowledged that while viral pneumonitis is the main clinical manifestation of
SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 is a multi-organ disease43 affecting the cardiovascular
system, renal-urinary tract and other organs and tissues. The recent studies have revealed
the tropism of SARS-CoV-2 to the renal epithelium15 and the post-mortem electron
microscopy analyses demonstrated the presence of viral inclusion structures within the
kidney11,43,44. The autopsy findings of patients who died of COVID-19 confirmed the
prominent structural damage of tubular renal epithelium45 and it appears that the viral
invasion of the kidney parenchyma may (at least to some extent) contribute to acute kidney
injury in patients with COVID-1946. Importantly, ACE2 – a key trans-membrane receptor
used by SARS-CoV-2 to gain entry to the host cells2,11,47 – is very abundant in the human
kidney48,49, possibly more so than in the lungs46. These observations suggest that the kidney
is one of the key target tissues for SARS-Cov-2.
Our kidney transcriptome profiling studies mapped a strong cell-specific ACE2 expression
signal to the proximal tubule and showed a strong enrichment for this cell-type amongst the
genes showing the highest level of renal co-expression with ACE2. The over-representation
of genes that encode different enzymes and molecular transporters uncovered by our coexpression analysis appears consistent with the previously reported, but not widely
acknowledged, role of ACE2 in metabolic regulation, i.e. acting as a chaperone for amino
acid transport and metabolism50. We also observed strong (4.1x) enrichment for geneproducts that localise in the mitochondria lending support for the hypothesis that viral
disruption of mitochondrial oxygen sensing mechanisms may be relevant to SARS-CoV-2driven hypoxia51. In addition, we reveal that many ACE2 co-expressed kidney genes show a
well-established role in renal physiology and/or are strong determinants of renal health or
the risk of kidney diseases. For example, LRP2 and CUBN encode megalin and cubilin – the
receptors responsible for reabsorption of proteins, hormones, and vitamins in the proximal
tubule and regulation of urinary excretion of protein52. Encoded by GALNT11, polypeptide NAcetylgalactosaminyltransferase 11 acts a post-transcriptional modifier of LRP2, regulates
its function as an endocytosis receptor and associates with proteinuria53. Klotho (a product
of KL) operates as a multifunctional regulator of renal phosphate reabsorption, apoptosis,
fibrosis, and cellular senescence; the renal depletion of KL plays a role in both acute kidney
injury and chronic kidney disease54,55. SLC47A1 encodes a multidrug and toxin extrusion
protein involved in the tubular secretion of creatinine and different drugs56. Several of the
ACE2 co-expressed renal genes (including LRP2, CUBN, SLC47A1, GALNT1) were
associated with eGFR, albuminuria and/or the risk of chronic kidney disease in the genomewide association studies57–59. While the inactivation, loss-of-function and/or drop in renal
expression of most of these molecules is generally interpreted as detrimental to kidney
health47,48,53, in our analyses the expression of these genes showed a positive association
with the renal abundance of ACE2. Together with the directionally consistent positive
association between renal expression of ACE2 and eGFR in two independent datasets our
data point to the nephro-protective function of ACE2.
We detected no association between renal expression of ACE2 and human hypertension in
our analysis. We also observed only a very weak enrichment for BP regulation in our kidney
ACE2 co-expression analysis. Thus, the renal expression of ACE2 is unlikely related to the
reported over-representation of patients with elevated BP amongst those with COVID-19.
Indeed, while almost half of Chinese6 and Italian5 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were
hypertensive and hypertension was more prevalent amongst those who died at intensive
care units than in those who were discharged5 or those with more severe than non-severe

COVID-196, these associations were not adjusted for age – a key correlate of COVID-19related morbidity and mortality. Being older, male sex, higher BMI, and diabetes have been
linked to a higher risk of infection and/or adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-196. Of
these factors, only sex and age showed an association with renal ACE2 expression in our
analyses. While the effect of sex on ACE2 showed a strong dependence on the type of
tissue, the age-related increase in ACE2 was apparent in both the kidney and the lungs and
directionally consistent in the other examined human tissues. Whether this age-driven
increase in ACE2 represents a ubiquitous molecular mechanism enhancing the viral entry
into the host cells or protecting them from a virus-mediated organ injury (through, for
example, increased degradation of angiotensin II and/or synthesis of angiotensin 1-7)
1,8,11,45,60,61
remains to be established.
Our study provides an important new insight into how pharmacological blockade of RAS (a
well-established strategy in the management of hypertension and other cardiovascular
diseases) relates to ACE2 expression and its contemplated role in COVID-19-driven organ
injury. Indeed, the RAS inhibitors (through their potential effects on ACE2 expression) have
been considered as both potentially protective and harmful to patients infected by SARSCoV-2. While ACE2 is not a direct molecular target of the RAS blockers, ACE-I reduce the
levels of the ACE2 substrate (angiotensin II) while ARB block the angiotensin II-AT1
receptors interaction and thus have been proposed to attenuate the angiotensin II-mediated
organ injury60–64. On the other hand, RAS blockers have been hypothesised to enhance the
entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells and enhance the severity of organ damage in patients
with COVID-19, possibly as a result of up-regulated ACE2 expression7,8,62. There is a widely
acknowledged paucity of data linking ACE-I and ARB with ACE2 expression in the human
tissues of relevance to COVID-1960. Indeed, the available evidence on how RAS blockers
relate to ACE2 expression is based mostly on experimental models61,65,66 and clinical studies
conducted using blood66–70. However, ACE2 operates mostly as a tissue enzyme60,71 and
thus the findings from the previous studies cannot be extrapolated into the most relevant
human tissues including human kidney. The demonstrated lack of association between the
RAS blockers and renal expression of ACE2 shown in our study makes it unlikely that
antihypertensive treatment driven up-regulation of this key functional SARS-CoV-2 receptor
may alter individual risk of viral infection or influence clinical outcomes in COVID-19. These
observations are further supported by the recent observational studies showing no
association between treatment with RAS and the risk of infection72 and/or severe illness73,74.
To this end, our data also lend support to the clinical consensus (endorsed by International
Society of Hypertension, European Society of Hypertension and European Society of
Cardiology) not to discontinue RAS blocker in patients with COVID-1963.
Our analysis has an obvious limitation inherent to the observational origin of the detected
associations. However, our findings are based on the largest available discovery dataset
with >400 human kidneys and wherever feasible – replicated in independent resources. We
also provide data from other human organs as context to our findings and make use of both
whole tissue transcriptome profiling and single-cell experiments.
In summary, we reveal findings of potential biological and epidemiological importance to the
SARS-CoV-2 infection, i.e. the signature of age of ACE2 expression in tissues of relevance
to COVID-19 and the lack of association between common cardiovascular and metabolic
comorbidities of COVID-19 (i.e. hypertension, diabetes) on the renal expression of the
SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor. Furthermore, the lack of association between renal expression
of ACE2 and RAS blockers demonstrated in this study provides an important molecular
argument in favour of safety of commonly prescribed BP lowering medications (RAS
blockers) in patients with COVID-19. Finally, our data suggest that in the absence of SARSCoV-2, renal ACE2 is positively associated with eGFR and lends support to the notion that
renal ACE2 plays a more significant role in the local control of proximal tubule metabolism
and kidney function rather than in systemic BP regulation50.

Figure1. a. The distribution of gene expression values in the human kidney transcriptome derived from 436 samples of the discovery population. Deciles of
the distribution are shown as coloured regions from least expressed decile (dark purple) to most highly expressed (yellow). Renal expression of the genes of
the renin-angiotensin system are labelled (AGTRAP – angiotensin II receptor associated protein, ACE2 – angiotensin I converting enzyme 2, AGT angiotensinogen, REN - renin, ACE – angiotensin I converting enzyme, AGTR1 – angiotensin II receptor type 1, CTSG – cathepsin G). Expression units are
transformed (log2 of the sum of transcripts per million plus a constant offset of 1). b. Two-dimensional t-SNE representation of cells from normal kidney tissue.
ACE2 expressing cells are marked with a dark grey circle. Cells are coloured by their location in the nephron segment. t-SNE - t-distributed stochastic
neighbour embedding. c. Heatmap of 47 renal genes co-expressed with ACE2, genes are grouped and ordered by chromosomal location starting at the top
and proceeding clockwise. Expression – quantile of expression in the distribution of the kidney transcriptome, colouring identical to A. Discovery – direction
and strength of statistical association (t-statistic) in the discovery resource, positive association is shown from white (least strongly associated) to dark red
(most strongly associated). Replication – direction and strength of statistical association (t-statistic) in the replication resource, colouring identical to
“Discovery”. Proximal tubule – overlaps with the set of computational cell-type markers for proximal tubule cell - from Eales et al.20. Kidney disease – overlaps
with “renal disease” set from genetic association database. AA-metabolism – present in REACTOME “Metabolism of amino acids and derivatives”. Blood
pressure – present in the manually curated blood pressure genetically associated genes list. Mitochondrion – annotated with “GO:0005739” gene ontology
term. d. Association between renal expression of ACE2 and age in the discovery data set. RBINT – the residual of normalised ACE2 expression, P-value –
level of statistical significance. e. Heatmap of association between ACE2 expression and age and sex in the selected human tissues from Genotype-Tissue
Expression project. The degree of positive association with age is coloured from white to dark red. A significant association with female sex is shown as green
and with male sex as brown, less significant results scale towards white. f. Difference in renal expression of ACE2 between hypertensive and normotensive
individuals in the discovery data set, n – number of individuals. g. Association between renal expression of ACE2 and estimated glomerular filtration rate
(eGFR) in the discovery data set. h. The association between renal expression of ACE2 and each individual antihypertensive drug class, reference hypertensive patients not on antihypertensive treatment, FC – fold change; 95% CI – 95% confidence interval; P-value – nominal P-value from the generalised
estimation equation (gee) model; P-value* - adjusted P-value after correction for multiple testing. T vs N – treatment vs no treatment. i. Fold-change
(calculated relative to “vehicle”) in renal ACE2 expression after 4-week treatment with perindopril and losartan in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Pvalues – level of statistical significance on ΔCt values from t-test (sample size shown).
