Abstract
The SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7, now designated Variant of Concern 202012/01 (VOC) by
Public Health England, originated in the UK in late Summer to early Autumn 2020. We examine
epidemiological evidence for this VOC having a transmission advantage from several
perspectives. First, whole genome sequence data collected from community-based diagnostic
testing provides an indication of changing prevalence of different genetic variants through time.
Phylodynamic modelling additionally indicates that genetic diversity of this lineage has changed
in a manner consistent with exponential growth. Second, we find that changes in VOC
frequency inferred from genetic data correspond closely to changes inferred by S-gene target
failures (SGTF) in community-based diagnostic PCR testing. Third, we examine growth trends in
SGTF and non-SGTF case numbers at local area level across England, and show that the VOC

has higher transmissibility than non-VOC lineages, even if the VOC has a different latent period
or generation time. Available SGTF data indicate a shift in the age composition of reported
cases, with a larger share of under 20 year olds among reported VOC than non-VOC cases.
Fourth, we assess the association of VOC frequency with independent estimates of the overall
SARS-CoV-2 reproduction number through time. Finally, we fit a semi-mechanistic model
directly to local VOC and non-VOC case incidence to estimate the reproduction numbers over
time for each. There is a consensus among all analyses that the VOC has a substantial
transmission advantage, with the estimated difference in reproduction numbers between VOC
and non-VOC ranging between 0.4 and 0.7, and the ratio of reproduction numbers varying
between 1.4 and 1.8. We note that these estimates of transmission advantage apply to a period
where high levels of social distancing were in place in England; extrapolation to other
transmission contexts therefore requires caution.

Introduction
A novel SARS-CoV-2 lineage, originally termed variant B.1.1.7, is rapidly expanding its
geographic range and frequency in England. The lineage was detected in November 2020, and
likely originated in September 2020 in the South East region of England. As of 20 December
2020, the regions in England with the largest numbers of confirmed cases of the variant are
London, the South East, and the East of England. The variant possesses a large number of
non-synonymous substitutions of immunologic significance​1​. The N501Y replacement on the
spike protein has been shown to increase ACE2 binding 2,3​
​ and cell infectivity in animal models​4​,
while the P618H replacement on the spike proteins adjoins the furin-cleavage site​5​. The variant
also possesses a deletion at positions 69 and 70 of the spike protein (Δ69-70) which has been
associated with diagnostic test failure for the ThermoFisher TaqPath probe targeting the spike
protein​6​. Whilst other variants with Δ69-70 are also circulating in the UK, the absence of
detection of the S gene target in an otherwise positive PCR test increasingly appears to be a
highly specific marker for the B.1.1.7 lineage. Surveillance data from national community testing
(“Pillar 2”) showed a rapid increase in S-gene target failures (SGTF) in PCR testing for
SARS-CoV-2 in November and December 2020, and the B.1.1.7 lineage has now been
designated Variant of Concern (VOC) 202012/01 by Public Health England (PHE).
Phylogenetic studies carried out by the UK COVID-19 Genomics Consortium (COG-UK)​7
provided the first indication that the VOC has an unusual accumulation of substitutions and was
growing at a large rate relative to other circulating lineages. Here we analyse VOC whole
genomes collected between October and 5 December 2020 and find that the rate of increase in
the frequency of VOC is consistent with a transmission advantage over other circulating
lineages in the UK. To substantiate these findings, we investigate time trends in the proportion
of PCR tests exhibiting SGTF across the UK on ~275,000 test results as a biomarker of VOC
infection, and examine the relationship between local epidemic growth and the frequency of the
VOC. We demonstrate that increasing reproduction numbers (‘R’ values) are associated with
increased SGTF frequency among reported cases, our biomarker of VOC infection, and confirm

this association through a variety of analytical approaches. Critically, we find evidence that
non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were sufficient to control non-VOC lineages to
reproduction numbers below 1 during the November 2020 lockdown in England, but that at the
same time the NPIs were insufficient to control the VOC.

Origins and expansion of VOC 202012/01
We examined the time and location of sampling of 1,904 VOC whole genomes collected
between October and 5 December 2020, combined with a genetic background of 48,128
genomes collected over the same period. Sequences of the VOC were widely distributed across
199 lower tier local authorities (LTLAs) in England, but highly concentrated in the South East
(n=875), London (n=636) and East of England (n=293). Relative to this genetic background, the
growth of the VOC lineage is consistent with it having a selective advantage over circulating
SARS-CoV-2 variants in England (Figure 1A). While rapid growth of the variant was first
observed in the South East, similar growth patterns are observed later in London, East of
England, and now more generally across England. Across these regions, we estimate similar
growth differences between the VOC and non-VOC lineages of +49% to 53% per generation
(Supporting Table S1) by fitting a logistic growth model to the frequency of VOC sequence
samples through time and adjusting for an approximate mean generation time of SARS-CoV-2
of 6.5 days (see Supporting Methods) 8​​ ,​9.​
S gene target failure in SARS-CoV-2 testing as a biomarker for the VOC
The UK has a high throughput national testing system for community cases, based in a small
number of large laboratories. We were able to extend our genomic analyses to epidemiologic
case data, because the VOC lineage is not detected in the S-gene target in an otherwise
positive PCR test (ThermoFisher TaqPath as performed in the UK national testing system).
Several SARS-CoV-2 variants can result in SGTF, but since mid-November, more than 97% of
Pillar 2 PCR tests showing SGTF are due to the VOC lineage​10​. Before mid-November 2020,
the frequency of SGTF among PCR positives was a poorer proxy for frequency of the VOC. We
therefore developed a Gaussian Markov Random Field model (see Supplementary Information,
Figure S1) to predict the proportion of SGTF cases attributable to the VOC lineage by area and
week, here termed the true positive rate (TPR), and the number of SGTF cases attributable to
the VOC. In turn, the corresponding false-positives were attributed to the S-gene positive case
(S+) category.

Trends in SARS-CoV-2 cases with S gene target failure that are attributed to the VOC
SGTF data were available for 35% of Pillar 2 positive test results between November 26 to
December 13, 2020. Given the greater abundance of SGTF data, a more detailed picture of the
VOC frequency over time can be discerned after our TPR adjustments. Overall, empirical and
estimated frequencies of TPR-adjusted SGTF cases show a similar pattern of expansion as
frequencies estimated from genetic data in terms of time, region, and rate of growth (Figure 1D).
As of December 13, SGTF is detected in all regions of England (Figure S2), and the estimated
frequency of TPR-adjusted SGTF ranges from 15% in Yorkshire and the Humber to 85% in the
South East, where the VOC was first detected. Changes in COVID-19 infections correlate with
raw (not adjusted for TPR) SGTF cases on a regional basis. Figures 2 and S3 shows the time
trends of SGTF (S-) cases, S-gene positive cases (S+) and total PCR positive cases by NHS
England Sustainability and Transformation Plan (STP) areas (a geographic subdivision of NHS
Regions). Visually, it is clear that while lockdown successfully controlled S+ cases in virtually
every STP, S- case numbers increased during lockdown.

Figure 2. Case trends in a subset of NHS STP areas. Total cases reported are shown as a thick
line. A subset of these - those tested in the 3 largest “Lighthouse” laboratories - were tested for
SGTF. The total cases line is coloured according to percentage S- among those tested. Counts of
S+ and S- reported via the PHE SGSS system are shown by the thin lines. The dates of the second
lockdown are indicated by the vertical red lines. Nine representative NHS STP areas from all
regions of England are ordered by decreasing percentage S- in the most recent week of data. Raw
SGTF data are shown here (not adjusted for TPR), so S- cases in earlier weeks include other
non-VOC lineages, especially outside the East and South East of England. Plots for all STP areas
are shown in Figure S3.

Transmission advantage of the VOC
To examine the differences between S- and S+ growth rates, we focus on epidemiological
weeks 46-50 (8th November-12th December). We estimate the total S- and S+ in each STP and
week by adjusting counts upwards in proportion to total cases reported in each STP and week.
We then calculate the week on week growth factor in both S- and S+ cases by dividing the case
numbers in week ​t+1​ by the case numbers in week ​t​. Given an assumed mean generation time
of SARS-CoV-2 of 6.5 days​9​, we correct these weekly growth factors by raising them to the
power of 6.5
7 to ensure they can be interpreted as approximate reproduction numbers. For each
STP and week, we compute both the ratio and difference of the resulting empirical reproduction
number of the S-negative cases to that of the S-positive cases (Figure 3). Overall, the median

multiplicative advantage is 1.74 for the VOC, and the median additive advantage is 0.63,
showing a clear advantage of the VOC for both metrics.

divided by cases in week t) for the VOC versus non-VOC lineages. Each point represents either
the ratio (left) or difference (right) of weekly growth factors for the VOC versus non-variant for an
NHS England STP area and week, using the raw SGTF data shown in Figure S1 (not correcting for

on the bottom plot show a transmission advantage. The blue line represents the mean advantage
for a particular proportion of VOC among all cases, and the grey lines the 95% envelope. Scatter
at low frequencies largely reflects statistical noise due to low counts.

Paired growth rate trends of the VOC and non-VOC lineages demonstrate an increase in the
reproduction number
We next tested the hypothesis that the higher growth rates of the VOC compared to other
circulating lineages might be due solely to shorter generation times (e.g. a shorter incubation
period), rather than increased transmissibility (R). To this end, we compared the number of
NHS STP areas in which both VOC and non-VOC cases increased or decreased (Table 1). If
the VOC had the same reproduction number as non-VOC but a shorter generation time, VOC
cases are expected to grow faster than non-VOC cases in areas where non-VOC grew.
However VOC cases are expected to ​decline​ faster than non-VOC cases where non-VOC
declined. Furthermore, areas where VOC grew but non-VOC declined would, on average, be
equally balanced by areas where the opposite was true. That is, if only the generation interval of
the VOC had shortened , the proportion of areas with positive growth of the VOC and negative
growth of the non-VOC would be highly correlated with the proportion of areas with negative
growth of the VOC and positive growth of the non-VOC. However, of 168 STP-weeks (42 STP
areas, weekly growth factors for weeks 46-49) there were 97 STP-weeks where growth was
observed in S- and decline was observed in S+, but only 1 STP-week where the opposite was
true (Table 1), indicating strong evidence against S+ and S- reproduction numbers being equal

(McNemar’s Chi-square test with continuity correction test statistic 92.02, ​p​ < 1e-15). Comparing
the empirical distribution of growth factors from S+ and S- with the nonparametric

from the same probability distribution.

Share of age groups among VOC and non-VOC cases
To assess differences in the age distribution of VOC versus non-VOC cases, we considered Sand S+ case numbers in weeks 46-51 across NHS STP regions. Case numbers were
standardised for differences in the population age composition in each area, weighted to
compare S- cases from each NHS STP region and each epidemiological week with an equal
number of S+ cases from that same STP and week (a case-control design), and aggregated
over STP weeks. Accounting for binomial sampling variation and variation by area and week,
we observe significantly more S- cases, our biomarker of VOC cases, among individuals aged
0-19 as compared to S+ cases, and significantly fewer S- cases among individuals aged 60-79
(Figure 4). This trend is seen in each of the regions of England most affected by the VOC thus
far (East of England, London, South East and Midlands), and similar differences are seen
between the raw (non-case control weighted, and non-age-standardised) age distributions of S+
and S- cases.

Regression analysis of VOC transmissibility
To investigate the effect of VOC frequency on the overall time-varying reproduction number, R​t​,
we undertook a number of regression analyses. We conduct our analyses at two different
spatial scales - lower tier local authority (LTLA) and NHS STP areas. For each, we estimated R​t
by week and area using data on pillar 2 testing, deaths and hospitalisations using a previously
described model​9,11​. Figure 5 shows the empirical relationship between weekly estimates of R​t​ at
STP level and the frequency of the VOC estimates using genomic data.

Figure 5: Relationship between genomic frequency of the VOC lineage among all genomes plotted
against the time varying reproduction number for each week. Each datapoint is an STP area.

We apply a range of frequentist models with a bootstrapping procedure to account for
non-normality in responses, as well as a Bayesian regression which explicitly models VOC
frequency, such that it simultaneously informs the parameter for binomially-distributed
observations of frequency and the R​t ​estimates. The role of geography in explaining variance of
R​t ​ was examined using both fixed and random effects. These models were applied to both
genomic-based frequency estimates and TPR-adjusted SGTF proportions of pillar 2 cases for
which S-gene data was available. Given this definition and the approximately 1 week generation
time of SARS-CoV-2, we expect R​t​ to have stronger association with VOC frequency 1 week
earlier. We therefore present regressions of R​t​ against frequency at week ​t​-1 for our default
analysis (where ​t​ spans weeks 44-50), and a regression of R​t​ against frequency at week ​t​ is
provided in the Supplementary Information.
Regression results are reported in Table 2 (Table S2 for sensitivity analysis). We estimate the
additive effect on R​t​, i.e., the increase or decrease in R​t​ (using R​t​ as response in the linear
model) due to the variant. As an example, with an additive effect size of 0.4, an area with an R​t
of 0.8 without the VOC would have an R​t​ of 1.2 if only the VOC was present. As expected,
models which allow for fixed effects of week and region give lower effect sizes for the VOC than
random effect models, given the latter constrain week and time effects more than fixed effect
models, due to the assumptions that such effects arise from normal distributions. The Bayesian
model results closely resemble those from the frequentist random effects model.

The results in Table 2 show a clear association between the VOC and R​t​. However, this
analysis cannot prove causality. The estimated additive effect is specific to the conditions that
prevailed in England during the time period examined.

Estimating reproduction numbers for VOC and non-VOC independently
We estimated the reproduction number of the VOC via phylodynamic analysis of whole genome
sequences from Pillar 2 national SARS-CoV-2 testing, sampled up to December 6, 2020. First,
we fitted a non-parametric ​skygrowth​ model 12​
​ by maximum likelihood to 776 genomes that we
selected from England in inverse proportion to the number of diagnosed cases sequenced in
each region by week (see Supporting Methods). This model indicates that the effective
population size of VOC 202012/01 grew at a relatively stable rate of 58% per week from
September 20 to December 6, corresponding to a reproduction number of 1.59. Estimates of
growth rate were insensitive to uncertainty in the molecular clock rate of evolution. Second, we
fitted the model to genomes from four regions with more than fifty sequences, Kent (n=701),
Greater London (n=606), Essex (n=131), and Norfolk (n=81). This regional analysis indicated
growth rates ranging from 58% to 92% per week, corresponding to reproduction numbers
between 1.56 and 1.95 (Figure S6). ​Finally, we carried out a Bayesian non-parametric coalescent
analysis using the Skygrid model​13​ using the same set of ​776 genomes. This analysis showed
growth until the start of November followed by a plateau for the month of November coincident
with the second English lockdown (Figure S7). This suggests the lockdown constrained growth
of the VOC, but was insufficient to cause a reduction in incidence. ​To estimate parameter values
we also estimated the initial growth rate of the VOC lineage under a parametric logistic growth

coalescent model​14​. Under this model we estimated a growth rate of 71.5 per year, corresponding to
a doubling time of 3.7 days (95% CrI: 2.4 – 4.9) and a reproduction number of 2.27 (1.84 – 2.73). By
comparison, a simple exponential growth model over this entire period yields a growth rate of 27.9
with a doubling time of 9.1 days (7.4, 11.2) and reproductive number of 1.50 (1.40 – 1.60).

In a parallel epidemiological analysis, we estimated VOC and non-VOC pillar 2 case numbers
by STP area using TPR-corrected SGTF frequencies applied to overall PHE pillar 2 case
numbers. We then estimate R​t​ by week separately for VOC and non-VOC, using the same
model previously used to generate overall (non lineage-stratified) R​t​ estimates​11​. We first fit the
unstratified model to estimate the infection ascertainment ratio (numbers of infections being
identified as positive cases) and infection seeding (initial infections in each region). For seeding,
we use the estimated infections from our unstratified model. The mean number of daily
infections for week 42 and 43 are used for seeding both VOC and non-VOC models. The
fraction of SGTF cases is used to distribute infections for seeding between VOC and non-VOC
in weeks 42 and 43. We then compute R​t ​estimates for weeks 45-50, to avoid the seeding
assumptions affecting R​t​ estimates. Figure 6A shows the mean posterior difference between R​t
estimates for VOC and non-VOC for week 48 and 50, while figure 6B shows plots median R​t
estimates for VOC and non-VOC across all NHS regions for weeks 45-50. The R​t​ estimates for
VOC are greater than those for non-VOC for 94% of STP-week pairs (points above the diagonal
in Figure 6B). Figure S4 shows the mean posterior difference between R​t​ estimates for VOC
and non-VOC for all weeks 45-50, while Figure S5 shows the ratio of R​t​ estimates. The mean R​t
difference across weeks 45-50 is 0.51 [95% CrI: -0.09 - 1.10] which was computed from the set
of 42x6 (STP x week) posteriors of R​t​ estimated for the VOC and non-VOC.​ ​The mean ratio of
the estimated R​t​ for the VOC and non-VOC was 1.56 [95%CI: 0.92 - 2.28] for the same period,
see Figure S5. Aggregating across all STPs we find that the mean R​t ​during the second English
lockdown across all STPs was 1.45 [0.91-1.89] for the VOC and 0.92 [0.86-1.06] for non-VOC
strains.

Discussion
While evidence has accumulated that substitutions associated with the B.1.1.7 lineage are
associated with significant changes in virus phenotype​2–4,15​, assessing the extent to which these
changes lead to meaningful differences in transmission between humans is challenging and
cannot be evaluated experimentally. When randomised experimental studies are not possible,
observational studies provide stronger evidence if consistent patterns are seen in multiple
locations and at multiple times. While rapidly increasing frequency of a new lineage within a viral
population is consistent with a selective advantage, it is also possible that increases in
frequency may be caused by founder effects or genetic drift, especially for genetic variants
which are repeatedly introduced from overseas​16,17​. But in contrast to previous genetic variants
which have achieved high prevalence, we see expansion of the VOC from within the United
Kingdom and a pattern of faster epidemic growth in tandem with expansion of the VOC has
been repeated in multiple regions. In this paper we have focussed on spatiotemporally stratified
analyses using a variety of statistical approaches to evaluate the relationship between
SARS-CoV-2 transmission intensity and the frequency of the VOC, B.1.1.7 during
November-December 2020 in different UK regions.

Assessment of the transmission characteristics of the VOC (B.1.1.7) was aided by the high
correlation between its frequency and the occurrence of S-gene target failure (SGTF) in routine
PCR testing of community cases of COVID-19 associated with the Δ69-70 deletion present in
the VOC lineage (Figure 1 and S1). S-gene positivity results were available for over a third of all
PCR-positive community COVID-19 cases for November and December 2020, allowing us to
use SGTF frequency as a proxy for VOC frequency, and thus estimate VOC and non-VOC
incidence trends by region over that time period. We see a very clear visual association
between SGTF frequency and epidemic growth in nearly all areas (Figures 2 and S3), which is
reinforced by empirical assessment of area-specific week on week growth factors of VOC and
non-VOC case numbers (Figure 3) and by formal regression analyses of the association
between estimates of local R​t​ and VOC frequency estimated from SGTF data (Table 2).
Finally, we used the SGTF data to independently estimate R​t​ by region and week for the VOC
and non-VOC variants (Figures 6 and S4) and derived similar estimates for the increase in R​t
associated with the VOC. This latter analysis is perhaps the most powerful, as no parametric
assumptions are made about the relationship between R​t​ of the VOC and that of non-VOC
strains.
Phylodynamic modelling provides additional information about growth of the VOC in October
during a period when SGTF data is sparse. Although not apparent in all analyses, this suggests
that the VOC expanded rapidly in October, with growth slowing (but not reversing) during
national lockdown in November (Figures S6 and S7).
We were also able to rule out the hypothesis that increased incidence growth rates in the VOC
are solely due to a change in the latent period or generation time distribution, but not the
reproduction number itself (Table 1), since we see a large and statistically significant imbalance
between regions where the VOC increased and where the non-VOC decreased, and vice-versa.
A change solely in, for instance, the latent period would not be expected to change the direction
of incidence growth.
We quantified the transmission advantage of the VOC relative to non-VOC lineages in two
ways: as an additive increase in R that ranged between 0.4 and 0.7, and alternatively as a
multiplicative increase in R that ranged between a 50% and 75% advantage. We were not able
to distinguish between these two approaches in goodness-of-fit, and either is plausible
mechanistically. A multiplicative transmission advantage would be expected if transmissibility
had increased in all settings and individuals, while an additive advantage might reflect increases
in transmissibility in specific subpopulations or contexts. More generally, the temporal context is
important; these estimates of transmission advantage apply to a period where high levels of
social distancing were in place in England; extrapolation to other transmission contexts, without
detailed knowledge of the drivers of transmission, requires caution.
We observe a small but statistically significant shift towards under 20s being more affected by
the VOC than non-VOC variants (Figure 4), even after controlling for variation by week and
region. However, as with our earlier results, this observation does not resolve the mechanism

that might underlie these differences. Differences between the age-distributions of VOC and
non-VOC community cases may result from the overall increase in transmissibility of the VOC
(especially during a time where lockdown was in force but schools were open), increased
susceptibility of under 20s, or more apparent symptoms (and thus a propensity to seek testing)
for the VOC in that age range.
There are a number of limitations to our analysis. The genomic and epidemiological data
analysed was collected as part of routine surveillance, and thus may not be an entirely
representative sample of SARS-CoV-2 infections in England over the time period considered.
We also focussed on relatively simple, data-driven analyses using relatively simple models
making parsimonious assumptions, rather than, for instance, attempting to model the long-term
transmission dynamics of VOC and non-VOC lineages more mechanistically. We also did not
attempt to explicitly model the spatiotemporal correlation intrinsic in infectious disease data,
especially when considering the spread of a new variant from a point source. Doing so is an
important priority for future work, but will require explicit incorporation of data on population
movement patterns.
Early versions of our analyses informed the UK government policy response to this VOC and
that of other countries. The substantial transmission advantage we have estimated the VOC to
have over prior viral lineages poses major challenges for ongoing control of COVID-19 in the UK
and elsewhere in the coming months. Social distancing measures will need to be more stringent
than they would have otherwise. A particular concern is whether it will be possible to maintain
control over transmission while allowing schools to reopen in January 2021. These policy
questions will be informed by the ongoing urgent epidemiological investigation into this variant,
most notably examining evidence for any changes in severity, but also giving more nuanced
understanding into transmissibility changes, for instance in the household setting.

Logistic growth model applied to variant frequency data
The logistic growth model fitted to VOC frequency data arises from a simple mechanistic model
for competition between two strains. Let established lineages have a reproduction number ​R
and let the VOC have reproduction number ​R(​ 1+​s)​ . According to this model, the log odds of
observing a variant over time will be proportional to (​R/​ ​g)​ ​st,​ where ​R​ is assumed to be constant
over weeks 44-49, ​g​ is the generation time, ​s​ is a selection coefficient (assumed to be constant)
and t is time. If these conditions are met, s can be interpreted as a multiplicative change in the
reproduction number ​or​ as a change in the generation time or as some combination of these
factors. From available data on times of sampling each variant, the compound parameter (​R​/​g​)​s
can be estimated. An approximate estimate of ​s​ is obtained by treating​ ​R​=1​ and generation time
g​=6.5 days as a constant for weeks 44-49. In the text, we refer to s as the change in growth ​per
generation,​ and is comparable to multiplicative changes in ​R​t​ ​estimated using other methods.
Phylodynamic analysis
Analysis was based on Pillar 2 whole genome sequences with known Upper Tier Local Authority
(UTLA). Maximum likelihood non-parametric phylodynamic analysis was carried out by: 1)
estimating a maximum likelihood phylogeny in IQtree​18​ (HKY model of sequence evolution); 2)
We removed duplicated identical sequences and estimated a time-scaled phylogeny using
treedater​19​ using a strict molecular clock. The molecular clock rate of evolution was constrained
to 0.0005 - 0.0015 substitutions per site per year. Small branch lengths in the tree were
collapsed and polytomies randomly resolved to produce 20 new variations on the dated ML tree.
3) The skygrowth model was then fitted to these dated trees with parameters 64 time steps and
tau bounded between 0.0025-20. Growth rate estimates were translated to reproduction
numbers using the method of Wallinga and Lipsitch​20​ in the ​epitrix​ R package and using serial
intervals from Flaxman et al.​9​ The main text reports the median growth rate over time. A
sensitivity analysis was carried out with the molecular clock rate fixed at 0.001 substitutions per
site per year which yielded only marginally different estimates of the median growth rate.
Sequence sample weights were used to select samples for phylodynamic modelling. Weights,
assigned to sequence samples according to their UTLA and their collection date, correspond to
the number of confirmed cases represented by each sequence in a UTLA relative to other
UTLAs on the same date. To smooth over sparsity, case and sample counts were summed over
the fourteen days prior to the date. Confirmed cases were accessed from the ONS API
(​https://api.coronavirus.data.gov.uk​). Code to compute sequence sample weights is available at
https://github.com/robj411/sequencing_coverage​.

Bayesian coalescent phylodynamic analysis was performed using BEAST v1.10.4​14​ employing
the Skygrid non-parametric approach 21​
​ and exponential and logistic growth parametric models.
A Jukes-Cantor model of substitution and a strict molecular clock were assumed. MCMC chains
were run for 100M states, removing 10M as ‘burn-in’ and then thinning to 9000 samples from
the posterior. Parameters were summarised and demographic curves reconstructed using
Tracer v1.7.2 ​22​.
SGTF as a biomarker for the VOC and frequency of SGTF over time
Data on SGTF among pillar 2 tests was obtained from the 3 largest (“Lighthouse”) PCR testing
laboratories and integrated into the PHE Second Generation Surveillance System (SGSS)
database. We also obtained the total number of cases reported by Public Health England.
Application of SGTF as a diagnostic for the VOC provides a large advantage over genomic
sequencing in terms of cost, speed, and the sample size of available test results. We extracted
275,571 S target positive (S+) and 96,070 S target negative (S-) test results collected between 1
October and 19 December, 2020 and examined the potential to use SGTF cases (S-) as a
biomarker for the VOC lineage. While the tests are not a representative sample of infections
over this time period, they are a representative sample of tests within a given region and week
and thus provide information about the relative abundance of the VOC versus other variants
over time and between regions.
Other lineages have been observed to carry Δ69-70 which is associated with SGTF and which
would have a similar impact on the TaqPath assay. The diagnostic specificity of SGTF will
therefore vary over time and space as it depends on the abundance of other lineages with
Δ69-70. This deletion is mostly found in global lineage B.1.258 and is highly linked with the
spike N439K variant​23​. Lineage B.1.258 has circulated in the UK since June 2020 where it is
now widespread. However, the frequency of this variant has been relatively stable since
October 2020.
In order to capture diagnostic uncertainty with SGTF, we fitted a spatio-temporal model of the
frequency of the VOC relative to other variants carrying Δ69-70. We fitted a generalized additive
model​24,25​ to counts of genomes classified 26​
​ as belonging to the VOC lineage or genomes which
do not belong to the VOC lineage but still carry Δ69-70. Counts were tabulated by LTLA and epi
week. We used a cubic spline to model trends over time, and correlation between neighbouring
LTLAs was modeled with a Gaussian Markov Random Field (GMRF). This model was used to
predict the true positive rate (TPR) - the probability that a sample collected at a particular time
and place belongs to the VOC lineage, given that it carries Δ69-70. Figure S1 shows how this
prediction has changed over weeks spanning November 2020. From week 50 onwards, we
assumed the TPR was 1 across England. The fitted model thus provided an estimate of the true
positive rate (TPR) of using SGTF as a proxy for VOC frequency as a function of time and
region in England (Figure S2).
Regression analysis of VOC transmissibility

Using reported COVID-19 PCR-positive case counts and deaths, we estimated the time-varying
reproduction numbers R​t​ for epidemiological weeks 44-50 in each LTLA and STP in England.
These estimates were obtained from a previously developed​11​ Bayesian semi-mechanistic
transmission model with a latent weekly random walk process that does not include underlying
factors that drive transmission. The STP model is based on pillar 2 cases only, and includes
hospital admissions as an additional input; the LTLA model is based on both pillar 1 and pillar 2
data. Further model information can be found in previous publications​9,27​. These R​t​ estimates
refer to the reproduction number of the infections that gave rise to the infections at time ​t​. Given
this definition and the approximately 1 week generation time of SARS-CoV-2, we would expect
R​t​ to be most closely associated with VOC frequency 1 week earlier. We therefore present
regressions of R​t​ against frequency at week ​t-​ 1 for our default analysis (where ​t​ spans weeks
44-50), but present results for regression of R​t​ against frequency at week ​t​ as a sensitivity
analysis in Supplementary Information.
We consider two data sources when estimating the proportion of the VOC: Genomic-based
frequency estimates and TPR-adjusted SGTF proportions of pillar 2 cases for which S-gene
data was available. For the SGTF-based estimates, frequency estimates were available for all
STPs and LTLAs for the weeks 43-49 (294 STP-weeks in total). When using genomic data, 7
STP-weeks in the week range 43-49 had no sampled genomes, leaving 287 STP-weeks for
analysis, for which we had an average of 137 genomes per STP week (of which on average 7
were the VOC).
We use two types of frequentist models. The first uses a fixed effect for each area, the second
uses a random effect for each area. Fixed effects of epidemiological week were included in both
cases. Confidence intervals for the fixed and random effects models were computed through a
bootstrapping method which resamples the areas with replacement and also samples the
counts of VOC in each week/area pair based on the observed counts. This bootstrap aims to
account for potential skewness and non-normality of responses, dependence within areas and
the randomness in the proportion of the VOC sampled within an area. When using
genomic-based frequency estimates we excluded STP-weeks that had fewer than 5 genetic
profiles, as these were deemed to not give reliable estimates of the proportion of VOC. This
removed a further ​14 out of the 287​ STP-weeks from those analyses.
We also implemented a Bayesian regression model 28​
​ at STP level, taking into account
uncertainty in the frequency estimates and uncertainty in the R​t​ estimates. VOC frequency was
modelled explicitly, such that it simultaneously informed the parameter for binomially-distributed
observations of frequency and the R​t ​estimates. The regression for R​t​ included terms for the
VOC frequency, the week (modelled with a smooth spline) and the area as a factor. The formula
to describe the binomial frequency data includes a linear function of time with an
area-dependent slope, and was fitted to the genome counts and the counts of S-negative cases
separately.

Figure S5. Map of the ratio of median Rt estimates for VOC and non-VOC variants for all STPs
between week 45 to week 50. Darker color indicates the higher multiplicative advantage for VOC
variant in comparison to the non-VOC variant. The mean of the ratio between R estimates for Sand S+ for all posterior samples across weeks 45 to 50 and all STPs is 1.56, with 95% CI [0.92 2.28]1​ ​.

We calculated this as the posterior mean and 2.5-97.5 quantiles of the set of 42x6 posterior medians of
the distributions (R_{S-} - R_{S+}), one per STP-week

Figure S6. Maximum likelihood ​skygrowth​ estimates of the effective population size of the VOC
through time in England and in four areas of England with more than 80 whole genome
sequences. In the upper right panel the molecular clock rate of evolution was fixed at 0.001
substitutions per site per year. In all other analyses the rate was estimated and bound between
0.0005 and 0.0015 substitutions per site per year.
