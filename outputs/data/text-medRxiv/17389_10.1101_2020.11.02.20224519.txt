Abstract

48

SARS-CoV-2 cross-transmission has become an concern in hospitals. We investigate

49

healthcare workers(HCWs)

50

conceptions whether the virus can remain on HCWs mobile phones(MPs) and be part of the

51

chain of transmission.

52

A cross-sectional study was conducted at a COVID-19 Intensive Care Unit of a teaching-

53

hospital. Fifty-one MPs were swabbed and a questionnaire about hand hygiene and MP use and

54

disinfection was applied after an educational campaign. Although most of HCWs believed on

55

the importance of cross-transmission and increased hand hygiene adhesion and MP disinfection

56

during the pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in two MPs(culture of the samples was

57

negative).

58

Implementation of official hospital policies to guide HCWs regarding disinfection and care of

59

personal MP are needed.

Introduction

70

Mobile phones(MPs) have become a working-tool. However, there are no official policies from

71

the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC) about its disinfection in healthcare

72

facilities. Permanence of SARS-CoV-2 in surfaces of hospital environment has been described1

73

raising the concern about cross-transmission2. Even though SARS-CoV-2 has been found in

74

MPs of patients with COVID-193, they have not been portrayed as source of transmission in

75

the hospital.

76

Material and methods

77

This is a cross-sectional study performed at an adult Intensive Care Unit(ICU) of a teaching

78

hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The ICU has 11 separated patient-rooms.

79

Healthcare workers(HCWs) use scrubs, N95-respirators and surgical-cap inside of the unit and

80

add a surgical-gown, face shield and gloves when entering a patient's room.

81

An educational campaign about cross-transmission and disinfection of MPs was performed at

82

the beginning of the pandemic. Informative posters were left in the unit that had a QR-code

83

with access to a video of the campaign advising to use 70% alcohol swab on MPs and to place

84

a screen protector to protect the MP oleophobic coating; and avoid the use of MPs during

85

patient care and in the restroom.

86

Ten days after the campaign we collected samples from HCW's MPs. Herewith an electronic

87

questionnaire was applied. It included queried conceptions about hand hygiene and MP care.

88

The MPs were swabbed using a nylon FLOQ Swab™(Copan Italia SPA-Italy) beginning with

89

the front-screen and without taking its cases off. Once sampled, swabs were placed in universal

90

transport medium(UTM™ Copan Italia SPA-Italy) stored at -80ºC and submitted to SARS-

91

CoV-2 RT-PCR. Positive RT-PCR samples were submitted to viral culture.

92

The extraction of nucleic acids was performed using QIAmp viral RNA mini kit(QIAGEN-

93

USA). For the RT-PCR assay, the commercial RealStar®SARS-CoV-2 Kit1.0(Altona-

94

Diagnostics-Germany) that detects the presence of SARS-CoV-2 through amplification of the

95

S-gene and E-gene was used. The amplification was done using the Roche Light Cycler®

96

96System(USA). According to the manufacturer, the sample is considered positive when one

97

of the target genes is detected.

126

Culture was performed inoculating Vero cells (ATCC® CCL-81™), as previously described

127

45

128

antibiotics and antimycotics(Cultilab, Campinas, São Paulo, www.cultilb.com.br) at 37°C in

129

an atmosphere with 5%CO2. Every day the cells were examined for cytopathic effect(CE),

130

new RT-PCR of the samples and blind passage of culture supernatant was performed on the

131

third, seven and fourteen day of culture.

132

Results

133

Fifty-one of the fifty-three HCWs working in the unit participated on the survey and responded

134

the questionnaire. Nine(18%) had covered their MP with kitchen-plastic film in an attempt to

135

facilitate disinfection. Eleven(16%) did not recall the educational campaign and three(6%)

136

answered that it did not change their behaviour. Only four(8%) did not believe that the virus

137

could remain on MPs and one(4%) did not believe that the virus could remain on the hands;

138

98% referred washing their hands more since the pandemic(Table1).

139

Twenty-two COVID-19 patients were hospitalized in the unit, eleven(50%) had positive

140

SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and twenty(91%) had a lung computed-tomography suggestive of

141

COVID-19.

Fifty-one MP swabs were collected, two were positive by RT-PCR(4%), with Ct values of 34

149

and 36, both detected the E-gene.

150

The two RT-PCR positive samples were isolated for viral culture. The sample with Ct 34

151

showed CE on the third day, subsequent RT-PCR of this isolate was negative. The isolate with

152

Ct 36 did not show CE, subsequent RT-PCR of this isolate was negative as well. The

153

supernatant of both cultures were monitored for 14 days without observing any other CE

154

afterwards.

155

Discussion

156

In this study, although most of HCWs believed on the importance of cross-transmission and

157

increased the adhesion to hand hygiene and MP disinfection during the pandemic, we

158

identified SARS-CoV-2 on MPs. Our findings suggest the need of a universal policy in the

159

infection-control guidelines on how to care for electronic devices in the hospital.

Little is known about virus on MPs or its potential for cross-contamination. A study of MPs

161

from HCWs of a Paediatric unit6 found virus RNA in 38.5% of the cases(42∕109);

162

predominantly Norovirus(n=39).

163

Two samples from a CPAP helmet used by COVID-19 patients, were positive by the RT-

164

PCR[1] from patients who had 10 or more days of symptoms and were positive despite the fact

165

that surfaces were cleaned twice a day1.

166

Pre-symptomatic COVID-19 patients can contaminate their surroundings as well. A study of

167

quarantined asymptomatic students rooms showed that 8/22(36%) surfaces, including linen

168

were positive. The students later developed COVID-197. This study has limitations. It is not

169

clear which is the best method to collect the SARS-CoV-2 from MPs. Furthermore, the Cts

170

found are high and may be interpreted as having a small viral load8, although late amplification

171

may have been caused by the freezing and thawing of the samples9,10.

172

Conclusions

173

Healthcare worker's MPs can be contaminated by SARS-CoV-2. Thus, it is possible MPs

174

may be a part of the chain of virus transmission in healthcare settings.
