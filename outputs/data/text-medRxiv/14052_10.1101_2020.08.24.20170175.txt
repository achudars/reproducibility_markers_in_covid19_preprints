Abstract
Background
Cardiovascular complication in patients affected by novel Coronavirus respiratory disease (COVID-19) are
increasingly recognized. However, although a cardiac tropism of SARS-CoV-2 for inflammatory cells in
autopsy heart samples of COVID-19 patients has been reported, the presence of the virus in cardiomyocytes
has not been documented yet.
Methods
We investigated for SARS-CoV-2 presence in heart tissue autopsies of 6 consecutive COVID-19 patients
deceased for respiratory failure showing no signs of cardiac involvement and with no history of heart
disease. Cardiac autopsy samples were analysed by digital PCR, Western blot, immunohistochemistry,
immunofluorescence, RNAScope, and transmission electron microscopy assays.
Results
The presence of SARS-CoV-2 into cardiomyocytes was invariably detected. A variable pattern of
cardiomyocytes injury was observed, spanning from the absence of cell death and subcellular alterations
hallmarks to the intracellular oedema and sarcomere ruptures. In addition, we found active viral transcription
in cardiomyocytes, by detecting both sense and antisense SARS-CoV-2 spike RNA.
Conclusions
In this analysis of autopsy cases, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 into cardiomyocytes, determining variable
patterns of intracellular involvement, has been documented. All these findings suggest the need of a
cardiologic surveillance even in survived COVID-19 patients not displaying a cardiac phenotype, in order to
monitor potential long-term cardiac sequelae.

Introduction
Mortality due to the infection of novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)
1

disease (COVID-19) is still increasing worldwide. Beside SARS-CoV-2 virus lung tropism causing an
atypical severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),

2

evidence is now available about the

involvement in COVID-19 patients of several other organs, including the cardiovascular system. About 2040% of hospitalized patients manifest a wide spectrum of symptoms related to heart injury, ranging from mild
3

chest discomfort, palpitations, arrhythmias to cardiogenic shock and fulminant heart failure. Furthermore,
myocardial injury has been documented in more than 50% of deceased patients4 with up to 7% of COVID-19
related deaths linked to myocarditis.5 To date, it is not clearly understood whether the cause of the
cardiovascular involvement of COVID-19 patients is due to SARS-CoV-2 direct cell damage or is rather
secondary to the excessive immune system reaction. The systemic hyper-inflammatory status may act as a
trigger for an aberrant host immune response mediated by natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages, and Tlymphocytes.6 Inflammation-mediated leucocyte adhesion molecules on endothelium may cause coronary
dysfunction with ischemia7 or acute coronary syndrome.8 Alternatively, ARDS-induced hypoxia associated
7,9

with systemic sepsis, fever, and hypotension may lead to myocardial injury

due to the oxygen supply and

demand imbalance. On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 has been found in vascular endothelial cells of patients
affected by endotheliitis 10 as well as in cardiac macrophages of COVID-19 patients with cardiogenic shock
and myocarditis.11,12 Moreover, viral RNA has been previously reported in COVID-19 patients’ whole heart
tissue,

13,14

regardless of a cardiac phenotype.

15,16

The cell invasion mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 is mainly

17

mediated by ACE2 receptor , which is highly expressed by several cardiac cell types, such as pericytes,18
cardiomyocytes,19 and endothelial cells10,20. Nonetheless, immunohistochemistry for viral antigen detection in
cardiomyocytes has never been shown.21,22
Here, we present, for the first time, data on SARS-CoV-2 sense and antisense RNA as well as viral
protein presence in cardiomyocytes of autopsy heart samples of 6 patients deceased for COVID-19dependent severe respiratory insufficiency.

Materials and Methods
Data availability
The raw data are available in Zenodo, at https://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3974891.

Patients’ autopsy samples
Autopsies of 6 consecutive non selected patients involved in this study, 5 males and 1 female, aged 54-69
years (average age: 59.5 ± 5.9 years) with a diagnosis of COVID-19, confirmed by CT analysis (Suppl. Fig.
1) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), were performed in a BSL3 equipped autopsy room at the Unit of
Pathology of “ASST Santi Paolo e Carlo” of Milan. Examiners worn clad in all necessary DPIs. Examiners
followed the recently published guidelines for performing autopsies and samples with suspected COVID-19
(SIAPEC-IAP).23 The autopsy examination was performed as soon as possible, by following the recently
published recommendations. The period from death to post-mortem autopsy ranged from 1 to 2 hours,
documented instrumentally with a continuous and flat ECG for 20 minutes.
All patients had no clinical signs of heart damage and died for SARS-CoV-2-dependent respiratory
failure after hospitalization in the Intensive Care Unit. In Table 1 clinical characteristics of all 6 patients
involved in this study have been summarized. The autopsy included complete histopathology and virology
evaluation. Clinical records were checked for clinical conditions at hospitalization.

mRNA extraction and Digital PCR assay
Tissue samples for RNA were stored in RNAlater (Sigma‐Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA). Then, RNA was
extracted from tissues by using TRIzol (ThermoFischer Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and Hybrid-R
columns (GeneAll Biotechnology, Seoul, Korea), following the manufacturer's instructions.
The RNA quantification was performed by spectrophotometer ND-1000 (NanoDrop®, EuroClone,
Pero, Milan, Italy). For viral RNA quantification in myocardial specimens, a one-step chip-based digital PCR
was performed on a QuantStudio 3D Digital PCR System platform composed by the QuantStudio 3D
Instrument, the Dual Flat Block GeneAmp PCR System 9700 and the QuantStudio 3D Digital PCR Chip
Loader (ThermoFischer Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). TaqMan Fast Virus 1-Step Master Mix (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) was used in combination with TaqMan primers (10006830, 10006831)
and FAM probe (10006832) for viral N gene purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Integrated DNA
Technologies, Coralville, IA, USA), the primers and probe for the N gene were controlled and authorized by
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and human RPLP0 gene (Hs99999902_m1) with a VIC
probe, as internal amplification control, purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific. Reverse transcription (RT)
was performed at 50°C for 10 minutes, followed by RT inactivation/initial denaturation at 96°C for 5 minutes.
PCR cycling consisted of a denaturation step at 98°C for 30 seconds followed by
annealing/extension at 56°C for 1 minute (40 cycles) and a final extension at 60°C for 5 minutes. Analyses
were executed with the online version of the QuantStudio 3D AnalysisSuite (ThermoFischer Scientific Cloud,
Waltham, MA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions.

Western blot analysis
Heart tissues were fragmented by Spectrum™ Bessman Tissue Pulverizers (Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH,
USA) and lysed in cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) supplemented with
protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Sigma‐Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA).
Total protein extracts were quantified by BCA Protein Assay (ThermoFischer Scientific, Waltham,
MA, USA), then subjected to SDS‐PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes
were blocked for 1 hour at room temperature (RT) in Wash Buffer (Tris Buffer Sulfate 1×, 0.1% Tween 20)
supplemented with 5% Bovine Serum Albumine (BSA) and then incubated over-night (O/N) at 4°C with the
appropriate primary antibody. Primary antibodies adopted for western blot analysis were specific for ACE2
(R&D System, Minneapolis, MN, USA), SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (Sino Biological, Düsseldorfer,
Germany), SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (GeneTex, Irvine, CA, USA), and GAPDH (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Dallas, TX, USA).
The membranes were incubated with peroxidase‐conjugated secondary antibodies (GE Healthcare,
Chicago, IL, USA) for 1 hour. Signals were visualized using the Western blotting chemiluminescence
substrate LiteUP (EuroClone, Pero, Milan, Italy). Images were acquired with the ChemiDoc system (Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA).

Immunostainings and histochemistry
Hearts samples were mapped as follows: full thickness samples from ventricles, atri (2 for each side), and 2
from interventricular septum. Specimens were routinely fixed in 10% buffered formaldehyde for 48 hours as
recommended23 and then 3-µm sections were processed for histopathologic evaluation as well as for
immunostainings.
Immunohistochemistry was performed with the automatic immunostainer DAKO OMNIS (DAKO,
Glostrup, Denmark), using staining kit with magenta and brown chromogens, routinely applied in our
laboratory. The magenta staining was adopted to avoid misinterpretation with lipofuscin granularity typical of
cardiomyocyte cytoplasm.
The histochemistry with phosphotungstic acid haematoxylin (PTAH) was performed according to
manufacturer’s protocol (BioOptica, Milan, Italy).
Primary antibodies adopted for immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were specific for
SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (Sino Biological, Düsseldorfer, Germany), SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (GeneTex,
Irvine, CA, USA), and α-SARC (AbCam, Cambridge, UK).
As for SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein, samples from lungs of patients under study, with
immunoreactivity in reactive pneumocytes, macrophages and epithelial respiratory cells were used as
controls. Negative controls were also included in the study by omitting the primary antibody. For all the
stainings, archival heart and lung tissue samples from patients dead for diseases other than COVID-19 and
cardiologic causes were used as controls (Healthy Control).
Immunofluorescence images and analyses were performed by using a Zeiss LSM710 confocal
microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).
Except for immunofluorescence, all slides were digitalized with the NanoZoomer S360 Digital slide
scanner C13220-01 (Hamamatsu Photonics, Milan, Italy).

RNAscope assays
The RNAScope assays (ACD, Bio-technè, Minneapolis, MN, USA) was performed on 3-µm formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded sections, following Wang et al. published method24, by using specific probes for sense
and antisense SARS-CoV-2 RNA spike sequences. Nuclei were counterstained with haematoxylin and the
images were acquired by AxioImager microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).

TUNEL assay
DNA fragmentation associated to necrosis

and/or apoptosis was visualized using a terminal

deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-digoxigenin nick end labeling (TUNEL) detection kit
(Roche, Mannheim, Germany). At last, nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst (ThermoFischer Scientific,
Waltham, MA, USA) and images were acquired by ApoTomeII microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen,
Germany).

Transmission Electron Microscopy
Cardiac tissue samples for ultrastructural analysis were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.13 M phosphate
buffer pH 7.2-7.4 for 2 hours, post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated through graded ethanol and
propylen oxide, and embedded in epoxy resin. Ultrathin sections of 50 to 60 nm not counterstained were
observed with transmission electron microscope Leo 912ab (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).

Results
Patients’ clinical and autoptic features
The patient features reported in Table 1 highlight that all the subjects died for respiratory failure.
Supplementary Figures 1 shows a representative result of a pulmonary CT, pathognomonic for COVID-19
disease. Only 1 out of 6 presented a slightly altered cardiac clinical profile, due to a mild hypertrophic LV,
likely secondary to hypertension, occurring before the hospitalization for COVID-19 disease. Importantly, all
patients did not show alterations of ultrasensitive Troponin I; 2 out of 6 were hypertensive; 2 out of 6 showed
hypercholesterolemia, none was diabetic, and 1 presented thyroid dysfunction. All the 6 patients were
assisted by mechanical ventilation in Intensive Care Unit for a period ranging from 6 to 21 days.
Concerning autopsy details, hearts ranged in size 410-750 grams (normal: 365 ± 71 grams), with
cardiomegaly related to right ventricle dilation, due to lung overload. On cut surface, cardiac tissue was firm,
brown, free of lesions, with some delicate areas of myocardiosclerosis in 1 out of 6 patient left ventricles; the
coronary system was unremarkable, with no significant stenosis nor thrombosis.

SARS-CoV-2 genome and proteins are present in cardiac samples of COVID-19 patients.
We initially confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cardiac tropism in these patients, by examining with chip-based digital
PCR the presence of viral RNA in total RNA extracts from heart tissue samples. Viral RNA was found in all
COVID-19 heart specimens, but not in the healthy control. The number of copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA
molecules ranged from 4.44 to 5.33 log10(copies/mL) (Figure 1a).
A Western blot analysis of total protein cardiac autopsy specimen lysates confirmed that the wellknown viral gate of host cells ACE2 receptor17 was expressed in the cardiac tissue20. Similar levels of
expression were found in different cardiac districts and, of note, independently on COVID-19. Furthermore,
we showed, for the first time, that SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins are detectable in COVID-19 patient hearts,
while no traces have been found in the healthy control. In detail, nucleoprotein and spike protein were
expressed at different levels in the analysed patients (Figure 1b), raising the hypothesis that the viral
genome is actively transcribed into cardiomyocytes.

SARS-CoV-2 is localized in cardiomyocytes of COVID-19 patients in terms of viral proteins and RNA.
The light microscopy analyses performed firstly allowed us to define all COVID-19 cases as similar by
microscopic aspects. In details, the immunohistochemical analyses confirmed positivity for COVID-19 in left
ventricular cardiac samples for SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein and spike protein (Figure 2a, b). Of note, viral
proteins were found within cardiomyocytes cell body, and more specifically, in cytosolic are of lipofuscin
(Suppl. Fig. 2a). This finding was confirmed by immunofluorescence co-staining of viral nucleoprotein with

αSARC-positive cells (Figure 2c).
In order to determine the presence of SARS-CoV-2 as transcriptionally active virus into
cardiomyocytes, we performed the RNAScope assay (Figure 3).24 In detail, this in situ hybridization was
performed by use of two different probes, recognising the spike protein RNA, sense (Figure 3a) and
antisense (Figure 3b), allowing distinction of the viral RNA genome from its transcript. Signals were obtained

with both probes in cardiomyocytes of COVID-19 patients only, but the most abundant staining resulted from
the probe detecting the actively transcribed virus (Figure 3b).
Cardiomyocytes containing SARS-CoV-2 do not show cell death sign, but display intracellular alterations.
In Figure 4, the immunohistochemistry for SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein and PTAH staining, performed on
consecutive heart sections, highlighted several microscopic scenarios. Not all the cardiomyocytes contain
the virus, and among those positive for the viral nucleoprotein we found living and unaltered cells (Figure
4a). Nonetheless, we appreciated, through PTAH staining, isolated or grouped cardiomyocytes showing
atypical degenerative aspects, such as increased cell volumes with intracellular oedema, together with
rarefied, disarranged, disrupted, and plurifocally clumped myofibrils (Figure 4b).
In order to investigate whether these interesting features, concerning cardiac cell alterations, may be
linked to apoptotic/necrotic processes activation, we performed TUNEL assay on all the subject samples and
we detected no cell death signs, except for the peripheral sample regions (Figure 4c, d).
Vascular modifications were unremarkable; no endothelial viral cytopathic effects nor endotheliitis
was here documented. Furthermore, a low grade of inflammatory infiltrates was observed in cardiac tissue,
especially in sub-pericardiac regions without a specific distribution (Suppl. Fig. 2b). Sporadic interstitial
macrophages displayed a strong immunoreactivity for SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (Suppl. Fig. 2c).
The investigation by electron microscopy confirmed the previously obtained evidence on the SARSCoV-2 presence in cardiomyocytes. Indeed, single and/or grouped spherical particles about ~130 nm in
diameter, with electron dense periphery characterized by crown-shaped small external projections and a
morphology compatible to SARS-CoV-2 were clearly visible in the intracellular space between sarcomeres
and sarcolemma of cardiomyocytes (arrows, Figure 5a, b).
As for immunohistochemistry and histology assays, the cardiomyocyte phenotype is not univocal:
while some cardiomyocyte hosting SARS-CoV-2 did not present any evident abnormality in terms of cellular
structures, other cardiac cells presented peculiar degenerative features, such as excessive intracellular area
between sarcolemma and sarcomere structure (Figure 5c, d) and abnormal, disrupted and clumped
myofibrils (Figure 5e, f). Regarding the former alteration, this cardiomyocyte swelling (Figure 5c, hashtag)
may microscopically explain the cardiac oedema, previously observed in histological examinations.
Noteworthy, the sarcomere rupture occurs in co-localization of SARS-CoV-2 viral particle (Figure 5f,
hashtag).
Although the microscopy investigation was compatible with cardiomyocyte damage, it is important to
highlight that, at ultrastructural level, the sarcolemma and mitochondria resulted unaltered and structurally
undamaged (Figure 5a, c, e, asterisks), thus not suggestive of cardiomyocyte death.

Discussion
In this work, we reported the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the cardiac tissue of a series of 6 autoptic
samples, obtained from patients died for respiratory failure with no clinical signs of cardiac involvement and
with no heart disease history. The originality of our study consists in the observation, for the first time, in
cardiomyocytes of i) SARS-CoV-2 RNA and protein localization and ii) active viral transcription of both sense
and antisense RNA for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.
Although several papers have already reported the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the heart,

12,15,16

none of them has detected viral localization in cardiomyocytes. We here demonstrated, by means of several
techniques, the undisputable presence of active SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients’ cardiomyocytes, in
terms of viral transcript detection (by digital PCR and RNAScope assays), viral protein finding (by Western
blot, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence), and full virions identification (by electron microscopy).
Specifically, a clear signal for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was found in cardiomyocytes only, while a
granular diffuse immunostaining of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein antigen was present both in
cardiomyocytes and in interstitial inflammatory cells, mostly in macrophages. This latter data is in line with

and with RNA viral presence in

but added unprecedented insights about

SARS-CoV-2 protein expression and localization in the heart.
In this work, we have also observed intracellular alterations in cardiomyocytes harbouring SARSCoV-2. To date, studies based on endomyocardial biopsies or isolated autopsy description did not reveal
cardiomyocyte alterations in presence of SARS-CoV-2.11-13,20 In our samples, scattered and focal
degenerative cardiomyocyte features were confirmed by electron microscopy image analyses at
ultrastructural level. In details, several cardiomyocytes showed an altered cell structure, with increased cell
area and intracellular oedema, suggesting a cardiomyocyte swelling. Moreover, damaged sarcomeres, with
disrupted and clumped myofilaments, were also observed, in some cases associated to rarefaction of
myofibrils. It is important to point out that none of these cells showed disrupted or damaged sarcolemma. As
for cardiac cell swelling, this microscopic event may be interpreted as a precocious subclinical sign of cell
damage, potentially leading to myocardial interstitial oedema formation.
are in line with observation previously described by Tavazzi et al.

Moreover, focal myofibrillar lysis

degenerative characteristics reported in myocytes from COVID-19 patient autoptic tissues.26 The small
number of virions we observed is in line with the low SARS-CoV-2 loads, previously found by Escher et al.14
in a series of endomyocardial biopsies from patients with active heart disease, and with the reported
absence of immunoreactivity for SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein, described by Adachi et al. in a cardiac
autopsy case report.22
Noteworthy, available histologic findings reported in literature often lack a correlation to clinical data
(e.g. cardiac troponin levels), thus clinical relevance and incidence of COVID-19 cardiac involvement still
remains unclear. Our data complete the current literature in suggesting that the cardiac tissue, including the
contractile cell compartment, can be infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and this may initially result in
microscopic cardiomyocyte alterations, not leading to clinically-relevant macroscopic cardiac damage.
Our crucial study specifically suggest the need to redefine post-discharge surveillance guidelines for
surviving COVID-19 patients’ follow-up even in the absence of overt cardiac phenotype, since the

cardiovascular long-term outcome of COVID-19 patients may mirror SARS patients, who developed
cardiovascular abnormalities in 40% of recovered cases in a 12-years-long follow-up period.

Limitation of the study
This study has limitations inherent to the limited number of patients’ autopsies included. However, our
findings clearly and consistently show that SARS-CoV-2 is present and active in cardiomyocytes of our
COVID-19 patients. Accordingly, we deliberately did show any statistical analysis, since we observed a
complete absence of SARS-CoV-2 signal in healthy control samples included in the experiments. For all
these reason, future studies will be necessary to confirm our data which are, at present, unprecedented.
