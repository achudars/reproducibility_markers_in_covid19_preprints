Abstract

38

Detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in

39

upper and lower respiratory specimens and coinfection with other respiratory pathogens

40

in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were investigated. From the study

41

subjects (N = 258) retrospectively enrolled when confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 positive,

42

nasopharyngeal (NPS), oropharyngeal swabs (OPS), and sputum specimens were

43

restored for retesting SARS-CoV-2 and detecting respiratory pathogens. Majority of the

44

study subjects (95.7%, N = 247) were confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 positive using NPS/OPS

45

specimens, suggesting that the upper respiratory specimen is most valuable in detecting

46

SARS-CoV-2. Coinfection rates in COVID-19 patients (N = 258) with respiratory

47

pathogens were 9.7% (N = 25); 8.5% (N = 22) respiratory viruses and 1.2% (N = 3)

48

Mycoplasma pneumoniae, an atypical bacterium. Of the respiratory virus coinfection

49

cases (N = 22), 20 (90.9%) were co-infected with a single respiratory virus and 2 (0.8%)

50

(metapneumovirus/adenovirus and rhinovirus/bocavirus 1/2/3/4) with two viruses.

51

Respiratory viruses in single viral coinfection cases with SARS-CoV-2 were as follows:

52

non-SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses (229E, NL63, and OC43, N = 5, 1.9%), rhinovirus (N =

53

4, 1.6%), metapneumovirus (N = 3, 1.2%), influenza A (N = 3, 1.2%), respiratory syncytial

54

virus A and B (N = 3, 1.2%), and adenovirus (N = 2, 0.8%). No mixed coinfections with

55

respiratory viruses and M. pneumoniae were found. In conclusion, the diagnostic value

56

of utilizing NPS/OPS specimen is excellent, and, as the first report in Korea, coinfection

57

with respiratory pathogens were detected at a rate of 9.7% in patients with COVID-19.

Introduction

76

COVID-19, caused by the infection of SARS-CoV-2, was identified as a cluster of

77

pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and has spread to other countries

78

since then, resulting in 42 million cases and over 1.1 million deaths globally as of October

79

25, 2020 (1).

80

In Korea, a Chinese female from Wuhan, China, was identified as the first COVID-

81

19 case on January 19, 2020, during the quarantine inspection at Incheon airport (2).

82

Suspects with respiratory symptoms and/or a history of travel to other countries, including

83

China, were asked to test for SARS-CoV-2 infection, causing exponential growth by

84

conducting real-time PCR (RT-PCR) tests to identify COVID-19 using emergency use

85

authorized (EUA) in vitro diagnostics (IVD) assays (3).

86

For the fast and accurate diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 using IVD assays, the

87

selection of appropriate types of specimens collected from patients at the right time would

88

be an important factor (4). It has been reported that lower respiratory specimens such as

89

bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and sputum have been recommended as the best clinical

90

respiratory specimens for detecting SARS-CoV-2 (5, 6). Viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 were

91

higher in nasal swabs than those in throat swabs collected from symptomatic COVID-19

92

patients (7). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended upper

93

respiratory specimens as acceptable for initial diagnostic testing of SARS-CoV-2 in the

94

types of nasopharyngeal swab (NPS), oropharyngeal swab (OPS), nasal swab, and saliva

95

(8). Simultaneous collection and placement of NPS and OPS in a universal transport

96

medium (UTM) tube using two sets of swabs is recommended to increase sensitivity in

97

real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays in Korea, as long as the supply of

98

flocked swabs is not limited (9). We analyzed the number of patients with COVID-19 that

99

were confirmed as positive using NPS/OPS by measuring the detection rates of SARS-

100

COV-2 among the patients diagnosed during the screening process in the first outbreak

101

of the disease in Korea.

102

The IVD assays for detecting SARS-CoV-2 were not incorporated for testing

103

coinfections with other respiratory pathogens at the time of screening COVID-19 suspects.

104

Recently, coinfections in COVID-19 have been reported not to neglect infections by other

105

respiratory pathogens in addition to SARS-CoV-2 (10-14). This suggests that

106

simultaneous testing for coinfections between SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory

107

pathogens would be required to provide a better patient treatment during the COVID-19

108

pandemic (15).

109

Among the respiratory pathogens, including tuberculosis, virus and bacteria have

110

been predominantly reported as coinfection agents in COVID-19, as seen in the previous

111

influenza pandemic (10, 12, 16, 17). Common coinfecting viruses with SARS-CoV-2

112

include respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, rhinovirus/enterovirus, parainfluenza,

113

metapneumovirus, and non-SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses, and the coinfecting bacteria

114

included Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Chlamydia pneumoniae,

115

Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae

116

(10-13).

117

In this study, we simultaneously detected frequently reported respiratory viruses

118

and atypical bacteria in clinical specimens collected from patients with COVID-19 to

119

identify coinfection rates using RT-PCR-based commercial assays. Upper (NPS and OPS)

120

and lower (sputum) respiratory tract specimens were employed to investigate the

121

coinfections with respiratory pathogens when COVID-19 was confirmed as positive during

122

the screening process.

123

This study reports simultaneous detection of SARS-CoV-2 and coinfection with

124

respiratory pathogens (viruses and atypical bacteria) using commercially available RT-

125

PCR assays among COVID-19 patients confirmed during the first outbreak in Korea.

Materials and Methods

137

Study subjects

138

Request forms of COVID-19 suspects submitted to Seegene Medical Foundation,

139

a Non-Profit Independent Clinical Reference Laboratory, for detecting SARS-CoV-2 from

140

February 9 to 23, 2020, were retrospectively reviewed. The request forms were generated

141

and recorded by government healthcare centers, hospitals, or quarantine offices with

142

personal and clinical information of COVID-19 suspects, such as name, address, age,

143

birth date, sex, specimen type and collection date, and respiratory symptoms including

144

history of visiting foreign countries, based on the guidelines of the Korea Disease Control

145

and Prevention Agency (KDCA). Once request forms with respiratory tract specimens

146

(NPS/OPS and/or sputum) collected from the suspects were submitted, the test results

147

were reported within 24 h of turnaround time. Based on the guidelines for testing COVID-

148

19 in Korea, both upper respiratory tract samples (NPS and OPS) were placed in a tube

149

containing a UTM to increase test sensitivity (9, 18, 19).

150

We reviewed the request forms and enrolled study subjects who were COVID-19

151

positive for fever ( > 37.5°C) and cough because these two respiratory symptoms were

152

reported as the most common (10, 16). The respiratory specimens (UTM containing

153

NPS/OPS as upper respiratory specimen and sputum as lower respiratory specimen) of

154

the study subjects were restored from storage freezers (-70°C) and applied to extract

155

nucleic acids to reconfirm SARS-CoV-2 and detect respiratory pathogens simultaneously.

157

Specimen preparation and nucleic acid extraction

158

Specimens collected from the enrolled study subjects were subjected to nucleic

159

acid extraction as described below for detecting SARS-CoV-2 and respiratory pathogens.

160

A portion (200 µL) of the UTM containing NPS/OPS was directly applied to the nucleic

161

acid extraction. The sputum specimens were inspected for viscosity, homogenized, and

162

diluted with phosphate-buffered saline as recommended by the specimen treatment

163

guidelines of the Korean Society for Laboratory Medicine (9, 18) Then, 200 µL of diluted

164

sputum was applied for nucleic acid extraction.

165

Nucleic acid extraction was carried out by mixing the specimen (UTM or diluted

166

sputum) and ready-to use reagents of a commercial kit (MagNA Pure 96 DNA and Viral

167

NA Small Volume Kit; Roche Applied Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) as

168

recommended by the manufacturer. The mixtures were placed in MagNA Pure 96

169

instruments (Roche Diagnostics) and processed for nucleic acid extraction according to

170

the manufacturer’s instructions. The final elution volume of nucleic acids extracted from

171

each specimen was approximately 100 µL. The extracted nucleic acids were stored at -

172

70°C and used for detecting SARS-CoV-2 and respiratory pathogens.

Detection of SARS-CoV-2 and respiratory pathogens using RT-PCR
To detect SARS-CoV-2, a commercial RT-PCR assay (AllplexTM 2019-nCoV Assay,
Seegene Inc., Seoul, Republic of Korea) was employed in this study. Briefly, the extracted

177

nucleic acids (8 µL) were mixed with reagents of the commercial RT-PCR assay, such as

178

primers and probes for specifically detecting three target genes of the virus [envelope

179

protein (E) gene, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) gene, and nucleocapsid

180

protein (N) gene] (20), exogenous internal control, and Real-time One-step Enzyme in an

181

automated liquid handling workstation (STARlet, Seegene Inc.) to maintain accuracy and

182

prevent human errors. After that, RT-PCR reactions were performed in a CFX96 real-time

183

PCR cycler (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) as recommended by the manufacturer for

184

detecting SARS-CoV-2.

185

The nucleic acids extracted from the specimens of the study subjects were also

186

applied to simultaneously detect respiratory pathogens using commercially available

187

multiplex real-time PCR assays (AllplexTM Respiratory Panel 1, 2, and 3 assay for viruses

188

and AllplexTM PneumoBacter assay for atypical bacteria, Seegene Inc.). The respiratory

189

viruses detected in this study were influenza A and B (Flu A and Flu B), respiratory

190

syncytial virus A and B (RSV), adenovirus (Adv), metapneumovirus (MPV), enterovirus

191

(HEV), parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, 3, and 4 (PIV 1, 2, 3, and 4), bocavirus 1/2/3/4 (HBoV),

192

rhinovirus (HRV), and other coronaviruses (229E, NL63, and OC43). Atypical bacteria

193

such as M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, L. pneumophila, and Bordetella pertussis were

194

simultaneously detected with the respiratory viruses. Interpretation for positive and

195

negative detection of respiratory pathogens by RT-PCR was determined as

196

recommended by the manufacturer of the multiplex assays.

Statistical Analysis

199

The statistical significance of the difference in detection rates of respiratory

200

pathogens was analyzed using the Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test. The mean value

201

comparison of age and Ct values among the study subjects was evaluated using the

202

Mann–Whitney test. Statistical analysis was conducted using GraphPad Prism software

203

(Version 5.0; GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA) and GraphPad InStat software

204

(Version 3.0). P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Results

218

Study subject enrollment

219

A total of 258 study subjects with fever and cough were enrolled in this study. After

220

retrospectively reviewing the request forms and test results of suspects (N = 20,054)

221

conducted for screening COVID-19 from February 7 to 23, 2020, we found that 404

222

patients (2.0%) were confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 positive based on the Allplex 2019-nCoV

223

assay. Among the positives, patients without personal information (N = 62; 15.3%), such

224

as age, sex, and region where they live, were excluded. Additionally, patients with no

225

fever or cough as clinical symptoms (N = 84; 20.8%) were also excluded, and 258

226

subjects who were SARS-CoV-2 positive and had fever (higher than 37.5°C) and cough

227

were enrolled.

228

The mean age ± standard error of the mean (SEM) of the study subjects was 48.5

229

± 0.8 y (standard deviation: 15.4, 95% CI: 46.6–50.4) with a median age of 52.0 y . The

230

detection rates of SARS-CoV-2 by the age of the study subjects were 1.2% (N = 3) for

231

those below 20 years of age, 26.4% (N = 68) for those between 20 and 39 y, 46.1% (N =

232

119) for those between 40 and 59 y, and 26.4% (N = 68) for those aged > 60 y. This

233

indicates that SARS-CoV-2 was mostly detected at the age of 40–59 y in this study.

234

The ratio of males and females was 41.1% (N = 106) and 58.9 % (N = 152),

235

respectively. Residence area of the study subjects were predominantly Kyungpook

236

Province, including Daegu city (N = 241, 93.4%), where the first outbreak of COVID-19

237

occurred in February, followed by Seoul (N = 6, 2.3%), Chungnarm Province (N = 5, 1.9%),

Detection of SARS-CoV-2 by types of specimen

241

Study subjects (N = 258) were retested for SARS-CoV-2 using the Allplex 2019-

242

nCoV assay. The study subjects were classified as positive for SARS-CoV-2 in both

243

NPS/OPS and sputum (53.9%, N = 139), positive in NPS/OPS but negative in sputum

244

(2.3%, N = 6), and negative in NPS/OPS but positive in sputum (4.3%, N = 11) (Fig. 1).

245

Some patients (39.5%, N = 102) were SARS-CoV-2 positive in NPS/OPS, although their

246

sputum specimens were not submitted because they were not able to expectorate (Fig.

247

1). Collectively, when the NPS/OPS specimen was applied without sputum, the positive

248

rate of SARS-CoV-2 with the Allplex 2019-nCoV assay was 95.7% (N = 247) among the

249

study subjects (N = 258), suggesting that NPS/OPS would be the most valuable specimen

250

for molecular diagnosis for detecting SARS-CoV-2, especially in the screening of COVID-

251

19 (Fig. 1).

252

The study subjects were confirmed to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 when all three

253

target genes in the Allplex 2019-nCoV assay were positive, as recommended by the

254

Korea COVID-19 Diagnosis Testing Management Committee (18). Figure 2 shows the

255

mean cycle threshold (Ct) values of target genes for SARS-CoV-2 in the Allplex 2019-

256

nCoV assay. The mean Ct values for all study subjects with NPS/OPS (N = 247) were

257

20.9 ± 0.3 (95% CI: 20.2–21.6) for the E gene, 22.3 ± 0.3 (95% CI: 21.6–22.9) for the

258

RdRP gene, and 23.6 ± 0.3 (95% CI: 22.8–24.3) for the N gene. In sputum (N = 150), the

259

mean Ct values for E, RdRP, and N genes were 21.9 ± 0.4 (95% CI: 21.1–22.9), 23.3 ±

260

0.4 (95% CI: 22.4–24.2), and 25.1 ± 0.4 (95% CI: 24.3–26.0), respectively. The Ct value

261

for the E gene came first, RdRP gene second, and N gene third in the Allplex 2019-nCoV

262

assay applied in this study, and the differences (delta) of the mean Ct values for E, RdRP,

263

and N genes between NPS/OPS and sputum were 1.0, 1.0, and 1.5, respectively. The

264

mean Ct values for the E gene and RdRP gene detected in NPS/OPS were not

265

significantly different from those in sputum (P ≥ 0.072), but the mean Ct values for the

266

N gene between NPS/OPS and sputum were significantly different (P = 0.0055) (Fig. 2

267

A). The N gene in sputum was detected significantly later than that in NPS/OPS when the

268

Allplex 2019-nCoV assay was applied in the same patient.

For the study subjects who were SARS-CoV-2 positive in both NPS/OPS and

270

sputum (53.9%, N = 139) (Fig. 1), the mean Ct values for the E, RdRP, and N genes in

271

NPS/OPS were not significantly different (21.4 ± 0.5, 22.8 ± 0.5, and 24.1 ± 0.5,

272

respectively) from those (21.2 ± 0.4, 22.6 ± 0.4, and 24.5 ± 0.4, respectively) in sputum

273

(P < 0.0001) (Fig. 2 B). However, as shown in Figure 2 C, the mean Ct values (23.2 ± 2.8,

274

24.9 ± 2.6, and 26.0 ± 2.8, respectively) for the E, RdRP, and N genes in the study

275

subjects who were SARS-CoV-2 positive in NPS/OPS but negative in sputum (2.3%, N =

276

6) were significantly lower than those (31.7 ± 1.3, 22.6 ± 1.3, and 24.5 ± 1.2, respectively)

277

who were SARS-CoV-2 positive in sputum but negative in NPS/OPS (4.3%, N = 11) (P ≤

278

0.0145). The Ct values and viral load of SARS-CoV-2 are inversely proportional; therefore,

279

the viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 in sputum were significantly lower than those in NPS/OPS.

280

The viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 may influence the difference in the detection rates of the

281

virus between NPS/OPS and sputum.

282

The patients in whom NPS/OPS specimens were positive although sputum was

283

not submitted (39.5%, N = 102) (Fig. 1), the mean Ct values (20.0 ± 0.5, 21.4 ± 0.5, and

284

22.6 ± 0.5, respectively) for E, RdRP, and N genes in NPS/OPS specimen (Fig. 2 D) were

285

significantly lower than those of other study subjects confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 positive

286

with the same specimen as shown in Figure 2 B and C (P ≤ 0.0407). Interestingly,

287

although the patients were not able to expectorate sputum, the viral loads of SARS-CoV-

288

2 in the NPS/OPS specimen were higher than that of patients who were able to

289

expectorate sputum.

Coinfection with Respiratory Pathogens in COVID-19

292

Coinfection rates with respiratory viruses and atypical bacteria among the study

293

subjects (N = 258) were 8.5% (N = 22) and 1.2% (N = 3), respectively, which were

294

significantly different (P = 0.0001) (Table 1). Of the respiratory virus coinfection cases (N

295

= 22), 20 cases (90.9%) of SARS-CoV-2 positive were coinfected with a single respiratory

296

virus and two cases (0.8%) (MPV/Adv and HRV/HBoV) were coinfected with two viruses.

297

Respiratory viruses in single viral coinfection cases with SARS-CoV-2 were as follows:

298

non-SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses [N = 5, 1.9%; 229E (N = 3), NL63 (N = 1), and OC43 (N

299

= 1)], HRV (N = 4, 1.6%), MPV (N = 3, 1.2%), Flu A (N = 3, 1.2%), RSV (N = 3, 1.2%),

and Adv (N = 2, 0.8%).
Among the respiratory virus coinfections (N = 22), 59.1% (N = 13) were detected

302

in both NPS/OPS and sputum. Flu A, HRV, and MPV/Adv were detected only in NPS/OPS,

303

and RSV, Adv, and non-SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses were detected only in sputum (Table

304

1). Notably, four cases of coinfection (two patients with Flu A and two with HRV) provided

305

only NPS/OPS specimens without sputum (Table 1). The data in this study suggest that

306

both types of specimens should be employed for detecting coinfections with respiratory

307

pathogens in COVID-19.

308

All cases of respiratory bacterial coinfection (N = 3; male:female = 2:1) were M.

309

pneumoniae detected in both NPS/OPS and sputum specimens without any other atypical

310

bacteria detected in this study (Table 1). Additionally, no mixed coinfection of viruses and

311

bacteria among the study subjects was observed.

312

The ratio of males to females in the coinfection cases was 4:6 (Table 1), but no

313

difference in coinfection by sex was observed (P > 0.05), suggesting that both men and

314

women confirmed that COVID-19 would be susceptible to respiratory pathogens at the

315

same level.

316

The mean age of coinfection cases (N = 25, 9.7%) with respiratory pathogens

317

(both virus and bacteria) was 38.4 ± 3.3 y, which was significantly lesser than the mean

318

age (49.6 ± 1.0) of patients without coinfections (P = 0.0009). The mean ages for viral (N

319

= 22) and bacteria (N = 3) coinfection cases were 39.2 ± 3.6 y and 32.0 ± 6.0 y,

320

respectively, which were not statistically significant (P = 0.4841) (Table 1). Most of the

coinfection cases resided in Kyungpook Province, except two cases (coinfections of Adv

322

and HRV in Kyunggi Province and Seoul, respectively) (Table 1).

323

Figure 3 shows the age distribution of coinfection cases (N = 25) with respiratory

324

pathogens among the study subjects (N = 258). The rates of coinfections in the age

325

groups of < 20 years old, between 20 and 39, between 40 and 59, and > 60 were 0.4%

326

(N = 1), 4.3% (N = 11), 4.3% (N = 11), and 0.8% (N = 2), respectively. Coinfections with

327

Flu A were detected at ages below 20 y (N = 1) and between 40 and 59 y (N = 2). At age

328

> 60 y, both RSV and other coronaviruses were coinfected. Two cases (0.8%) of double

329

viral coinfections were found at ages between 20 and 39 y (HRV/HBoV) and between 40

330

and 59 y (MPV/Adv), respectively. All other coinfection cases (7.0%, N = 18) with virus

Discussion

341

In Korea, both NPS and OPS were placed in a UTM tube after collection from

342

suspects of COVID-19 for screening (9). The UTM tubes were transported for COVID-19

343

testing to the laboratory immediately after collection, with or without sputum samples. No

344

other upper or lower respiratory tract samples were transported and tested. Among the

345

suspects (N = 20,054) tested from February 9 to 23, 2020, during the first outbreak in

346

Korea, the positive rate of SRAS-CoV-2 was 2.0% (N = 404) using the RT-PCR assay,

347

which was lower than the finding (9.5%; N = 116) in a previous study, when tested for

348

patients in the USA (N = 1,217) enrolled from March 3 to 25, 2020 (21). From the positive

349

(N = 404), patients (N=258) with clinical symptoms (fever and cough) were enrolled as

350

study subjects for this study.

351

Among the study subjects (N = 258), 95.7% (N = 247) were confirmed to be

352

positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the RT-PCR assay by sampling NPS/OPS, regardless of the

353

collection of sputum (Fig. 1). Additionally, based on a comparison of the mean Ct values

354

for the genes specific to SARS-CoV-2, higher viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 were observed

355

in NPS/OPS than in sputum (Fig. 2), which would support the excellent detection rates of

356

SARS-CoV-2 in NPS/OPS (Fig. 1). This suggests that NPS/OPS would be the most

357

valuable for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 in molecular diagnosis assays, and it would not be

358

necessary to enforce sampling sputum specimens, especially when the patients were not

359

able to expectorate. However, in previous studies, sputum specimens were considered a

360

better choice than nasal samples for the molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2. Pan et al.

361

(6) measured the viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 from two COVID-19 patients at the early

362

stage of onset of symptoms in throat, sputum, urine, and stool. They found that the viral

363

loads were higher in sputum samples than in throat samples, especially in the early days

364

after onset. Wang et al. (5) compared the detection rates of SARS-CoV-2 among multiple

365

types of specimens collected from patients with COVID-19, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid

366

showed 93% positive rate as the highest, followed by sputum (72%), nasal swab (63%),

367

and pharyngeal swabs (32%). Collectively, based on the literature published, for detecting

368

SARS-CoV-2 in the patients, the best clinical specimen recommended was

369

bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and sputum was the second with strong recommendation,

370

whereas pharyngeal swabs were in moderate (22, 23). In contrast, our data support that

371

pharyngeal swab samples would be better than sputum in detecting SARS-CoV-2 among

372

the study subjects who underwent COVID-19 screening. A consistent finding with the

373

current study was also observed in a case study of two Korean patients, reporting that

374

viral loads of upper respiratory specimens (placing both NPS and OPS in the same tube)

375

were detected as similar to or sometimes higher than those in sputum using RT-PCR (24).

376

Coinfection rate in patients with COVID-19 (N = 258) with respiratory pathogens

377

was 9.7% (N = 25) in the current study (Table 1 and Figure 3): 8.5% (N = 22) of viral and

378

1.2% (N = 3) of atypical bacterial coinfections. The rate of viral coinfection has been

379

previously reported to range from 2.0% – 19.8% in different countries (21, 25-27). The

380

coinfection rate with respiratory viruses was 2.0% (N = 39) among 1,996 patients with

381

COVID-19 hospitalized in New York City (25). Tested at a hospital in Shenzhen, China,

382

six (3.2%) of 92 COVID-19 patients hospitalized were viral coinfection cases (26). Another

383

study conducted in Wuhan, China, reported that among patients with COVID-19 (N = 104),

384

5.8% (N = 6) had coinfections with non-SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses (2.9%, N = 3),

385

influenza A (2.9%, N = 3), and rhinovirus (1.9%, N = 2) (27). In the study by Kim et al. (21)

386

with patients in California, USA, 19.8% (N = 23) of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (N =

387

116) were positive for other respiratory pathogens. As the first report in Korea

388

representing the suspect group of COVID-19, especially from the first outbreak area in

389

February 2020, 8.5% of viral coinfections were found in this study, which is comparable

390

with previous reports.

391

Among the coinfections (N=25) by respiratory virus (N = 22) and the atypical

392

bacteria M. pneumoniae (N = 3), most cases were detected in both the NPS/OPS and

393

sputum specimens (64.0%, N=16), but some were in either NPS/OPS (20.0%, N=5) or

394

sputum (16.0%, N=4) (Table 1). This suggests that both upper and lower respiratory tract

395

specimens would be recommended to monitor the coinfection with respiratory pathogens

396

in COVID-19. This is consistent with a previous report by Zhu et al. (14), who suggested

397

that for detecting coinfections with respiratory pathogens in COVID-19, both upper and

398

lower respiratory tract specimens should be collected and considered to test while

399

diagnosing and treating COVID-19.

400

Based on a meta-analysis by Lansbury et al. (12) with the previously reported

401

studies regarding types of co-infected respiratory viruses in patients with SARS-CoV-2,

402

the most common co-infecting virus was RSV, followed by Flu A, HRV, PIV, and other

403

coronaviruses. A study in China, which was not included in the meta-analysis, consistently

404

reported that RSV was most commonly detected among the coinfection viruses in COVID-

405

19 patients diagnosed between January 19 and February 26, 2020 (15). However, in the

406

USA, Kim et al. (21) and Richardson et al. (25) detected rhinovirus/enterovirus as the

407

most common coinfection agent in their study, followed by RSV among the study subjects

408

enrolled in March 2020. In this study with Korean study subjects enrolled in February

409

2020, the most common respiratory virus as the coinfection agent was HRV [1.9 %, N =

410

5; one double viral coinfection with HBoV (HRV/HBoV) and four single viral coinfection

411

cases in SARS-CoV 2 positive] (Table 1). Five cases of single viral coinfections by non-

412

SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses (three cases of 229E, one case of NL63, and one case of

413

OC43) were also observed (Table 1).

414

SARS-CoV-2 and influenza coinfection was relatively rare in three patients (1.2%)

415

among the study subjects (N = 258) (Table 1). This finding is also consistent with previous

416

studies, such as 0.54% in Turkey (13), 0.9% (21) and 2.4% (25) in the USA, and from

417

1.2%–4.3% in China (14, 15, 27, 28).

418

Among the atypical bacteria tested in this study, only M. pneumoniae was

419

detected at the level of 1.2% (N = 3) of the study subjects (N = 258) (Table 1). In some

420

other studies, however, C. pneumoniae, another atypical bacterium, was nominated as

421

the coinfection agent in patients with COVID-19 in addition to M. pneumoniae (14, 15, 25).

422

The coinfection rates in the above studies for M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae ranged

423

from 1.6%–4.8% and 2.5%–5.2%, respectively. Lansbury et al. (12) emphasized, in their

424

meta-analysis study, that M. pneumoniae was the most common bacteria detected in

425

patients with COVID-19 having coinfections with respiratory bacterial pathogens, followed

426

by P. aeruginosa, H. influenza, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila spp.,

427

suggesting that in addition to coinfection by atypical bacteria, other respiratory bacteria

428

were also the candidates as co-infecting agents in COVID-19.

429

Unlike Kim et al. (21), who reported no difference in age between coinfection and

430

SARS-CoV-2 only (non-coinfection), the mean ages between them were significantly

431

different in this study (38.4 ± 3.3 y vs. 49.6 ± 1.0 y, respectively; P = 0.0009). This

432

suggested that young ages were more susceptible to coinfection with respiratory

433

pathogens in this study.

434

The viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 between the patients with coinfection and SARS-

435

CoV-2 only infection were not significantly different as Ct values for the target genes (E,

436

RdRP, and N) were statistically the same between them when the Allplex 2019-nCoV

437

assay was applied (P > 0.05). This suggests that the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 is not

438

responsible to cause coinfection with respiratory pathogens.

439

The current study has a few limitations. The effect of coinfection on the treatment

440

outcomes of COVID-19 patients enrolled in this study is unavailable. The study subjects

441

in this study were retrospectively enrolled during the process of screening COVID-19 in

442

the region of the first outbreak in Korea. Thus, the scope of this study was to investigate

443

the coinfection rates of respiratory pathogens among patients with COVID-19, not

444

hospitalized, but diagnosed as positive during the screening process for SARS-CoV-2.

445

Additionally, the results of the study cannot represent the coinfection rates for the winter

446

when respiratory pathogens such as influenza are dominant. The study subjects were

447

only enrolled in February; therefore, investigating the coinfection rates with respiratory

448

pathogens would be interesting during the whole winter season, especially from

449

November to March in Korea.

450

In summary, the upper respiratory tract specimen (NPS/UPS) provided excellent

451

detection of SARS-CoV-2 without lower respiratory specimens (sputum) in the RT-PCR

452

assay. However, detection of coinfections with respiratory pathogens in COVID-19

453

required both upper and lower respiratory specimens. Coinfection rates in patients with

454

COVID-19 (N = 258) with respiratory pathogens were 9.7% (N = 25) with mostly virus

455

(8.5%, N = 22) and an atypical bacterium, M. pneumoniae (1.2%, N = 3). The most

456

common respiratory virus detected as a coinfecting agent was HRV, followed by non-

457

SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses, HRV, MPV, Flu A, RSV, and Adv. As a conclusion,

458

simultaneous detection of respiratory pathogens and SARS-CoV-2 by molecular

459

diagnosis assays would be necessary for identifying the causative agents causing

460

coinfection, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.
