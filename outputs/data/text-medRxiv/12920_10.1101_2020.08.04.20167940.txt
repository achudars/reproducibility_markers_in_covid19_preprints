The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic poses a significant global threat to lives and livelihoods, with
over 16 million confirmed cases and at least 650 000 deaths from COVID-19 in the first 7
months of the pandemic. Developing tools to measure antibody responses and understand
protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is a priority. Many expression systems exist to produce
the proteins required in the establishment of these serological assays, but plant-based systems
have several advantages over more widely used conventional protein expression systems.
Most notably, they are rapid, scaleable and cost-effective, making them attractive protein
expression systems particularly in low-income settings such as ours in Africa. We were able
to develop a cost-effective serological assay by making use of plant-produced viral antigens.
Our study demonstrates that recombinant SARS-CoV-2 proteins produced in plants enable
the robust detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies equivalent to that observed in a high
sensitivity commercial assay in which antigens were produced in a mammalian expression
system. Our ELISA can be used to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence, describe the
kinetics of the humoral immune response in infected individuals, and investigate humoral
immunity in our setting where comorbidities are highly prevalent.

Abstract
Background: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has swept the world and poses a significant global
threat to lives and livelihoods, with over 16 million confirmed cases and at least 650 000
deaths from COVID-19 in the first 7 months of the pandemic. Developing tools to measure
seroprevalence and understand protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is a priority. We aimed
to develop a serological assay using plant-derived recombinant viral proteins, which represent
important tools in less-resourced settings.
Methods: We established an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using
the S1 and receptor-binding domain (RBD) portions of the spike protein from SARS-CoV-2,
expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana. We measured antibody responses in sera from South
African patients (n=77) who had tested positive by PCR for SARS-CoV-2. Samples were
taken a median of six weeks after the diagnosis, and the majority of participants had mild and
moderate COVID-19 disease. In addition, we tested the reactivity of pre-pandemic plasma
(n=58) and compared the performance of our in-house ELISA with a commercial assay. We
also determined whether our assay could detect SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and IgA in saliva.
Results: We demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulins are readily detectable
using recombinant plant-derived viral proteins, in patients who tested positive for SARSCoV-2 by PCR. Reactivity to S1 and RBD was detected in 51 (66%) and 48 (62%) of
participants, respectively. Notably, we detected 100% of samples identified as having S1specific antibodies by a validated, high sensitivity commercial ELISA, and OD values were
strongly and significantly correlated between the two assays. For the pre-pandemic plasma,
1/58 (1.7%) of samples were positive, indicating a high specificity for SARS-CoV-2 in our
ELISA. SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG correlated significantly with IgA and IgM responses.
Endpoint titers of S1- and RBD-specific immunoglobulins ranged from 1:50 to 1:3200. S1specific IgG and IgA were found in saliva samples from convalescent volunteers.
Conclusions: We demonstrate that recombinant SARS-CoV-2 proteins produced in plants
enable robust detection of SARS-CoV-2 humoral responses. This assay can be used for
seroepidemiological studies and to measure the strength and durability of antibody responses
to SARS-CoV-2 in infected patients in our setting.

The current global pandemic, caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in over 16 million cases and at least 650 000
deaths, as of 27 July 2020. SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in December 2019 in Wuhan, a
city in the Hubei province of China, and is thought to originate from zoonotic transmission of
a bat coronavirus (Tan et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19), the resultant disease, is commonly associated with fever, cough and fatigue, and in
severe cases, pneumonia and respiratory failure (Chan et al., 2020).

SARS-CoV-2 is a 30kB positive-stranded RNA virus that is a member of the
Betacoronavirus genus and the subgenus Sarbecovirus (Letko et al., 2020). The genus
harbours human pathogens that cause respiratory infections, namely the highly virulent
SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), as well as the
circulating ‘common cold’ human coronavirus (hCoV)-OC43 and hCoV-HKU1 (Su et al.,
2016). Betacoronaviruses express four essential structural proteins, namely the spike (S)
glycoprotein, membrane (M) protein, envelope (E) protein and nucleocapsid (N) protein, as
well as multiple accessory and non-structural proteins (Neuman et al., 2011, Lu et al., 2020).
The S glycoprotein is a homotrimer that protrudes from the surface of the viral particles
(Tortorici and Veesler, 2019), and interacts with the human cell receptor angiotensin
converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) through the receptor-binding domain (RBD), gaining viral
entry into the host cell (Li 2016; Letko et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2020). S is cleaved by host
cell proteases into two subunits: the S1 subunit which harbours the RBD and enables binding
to host cell receptors, and the S2 subunit that is important for fusion with the host cell
membrane (Walls et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020).

The S1 subunit is highly immunogenic, and its RBD portion is the main target of
neutralizing antibodies, thus becoming the focus of serological studies (Amanat et al., 2020;
Huang et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Okba et al., 2020). Recently, potent neutralizing
antibodies isolated from the convalescent sera of SARS-CoV-2 patients were demonstrated to
be protective against disease from high-dose SARS-CoV-2 challenge in a small animal model
(Rogers et al., 2020), suggesting the potential for therapeutic interventions as well as
inferring that recovered SARS-CoV-2 patients may be afforded protection from re-infection
by neutralizing antibody responses. Amanat et al (2020) showed a strong correlation between
the neutralizing antibody response and ELISA endpoint titers against S, suggesting the use of
serological assays in estimating the percentage of infected people who have neutralizing
antibodies that protect them from re-infection or disease.

Serological assays that can detect antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 are critical for
answering pressing questions regarding immunity to the virus. It is not known what
proportion of infected individuals elicit antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, if antibodies serve as
correlates of protection, and if so, what the threshold of binding or neutralizing titers are that
will provide immunity, and the duration of these responses. Serological assays such as
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) can assist in answering these questions.
These assays need to be both sensitive as well as demonstrate high specificity for SARSCoV-2, and not give false positives due to cross-reactivity with widely circulating hCoVs
NL63, 229E, OC43, and HKU1. While the N protein is more conserved among
coronaviruses, the S protein sequence has lower sequence conservation. The S1 portion is 2125% identical at the amino acid level to circulating hCoVs (Okba et al., 2020). Thus,
serological assays using the full-length S protein, S1 subunit or RBD portion as antigens have

Purified recombinant proteins are essential for the establishment of serological assays.
Numerous protein expression systems exist, each with their own advantages and limitations.
These include bacterial, mammalian, yeast, insect and plant-based systems (Shanmugaraj et
al., 2020, Yin et al., 2007). Plant-based systems have several advantages over more widely
used conventional protein expression systems (Shanmugaraj and Ramalingam, 2014). Most
notably, they are rapid, cost-effective and support post-translational modifications similar to
mammalian cell systems, making them attractive protein expression systems particularly in
low-income settings (Shanmugaraj and Ramalingam, 2014 and 2020; Maliga et al., 2004).
Historically, their major disadvantage was low yield (Shanmugaraj et al., 2020), however
advances in plant technology, including transient expression systems and viral vectors, have
led to improvements in protein yield (Kapila et al., 1997; Shanmugaraj and Ramalingam,
2014; Yamamoto et al., 2018). Additionally, SARS-CoV S1 protein expressed in tomato and
tobacco plants demonstrated good immunogenicity in mice (Pogrebnyak et al., 2005).
Together, these studies highlight the potential of plant-based expression systems for the
development of serological assay reagents as well as vaccines for the current SARS-CoV-2
pandemic.

In this study, we describe the development of an ELISA that enables detection of
antibodies directed at the S1 subunit and the RBD portion of the SARS-CoV-2 S
glycoprotein, generated through a plant-based expression system.

The S1 portion and receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2
Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate (GenBank: MN908947.3) were produced by Cape Bio Pharms, Cape
Town, South Africa. Briefly, Nicotiana benthamiana codon-optimized DNA encoding S1 and
RBD was synthesized commercially (Genscript). Both genes were fused at their C-terminal
region to the fragment crystallizable region (Fc) of rabbit IgG1 (Genbank: L29172.1) and
subsequently cloned into Cape Bio Pharms’ proprietary vector, pCBP2. Agrobacterium
tumefaciens strain GV3101 (pMP90RK) was used to carry agroinfiltration. Growth of
recombinant A. tumefaciens and vacuum infiltration of N. benthamiana plants was performed
as described previously (Maclean et al., 2007). Three days post-infiltration, leaves were
homogenized in the presence of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at a 2:1 ratio buffer:leaf
material. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10 000 g for 10 min at 4°C, and the
clarified supernatant was used for expression analyses and purification by Protein A affinity
chromatography.

For purification, the extract was filtered through a 0.22 µm cellulose nitrate filter
(Sartorius) before loading onto a pre-equilibrated 5 ml column packed with POROS
MabCapture A resin (Thermo Fisher). The column was then washed with 10 column volumes
of wash buffer (PBS, pH 7.5) and bound proteins eluted using elution buffer (0.1 M glycine,
pH 2.5). Eluted fractions were captured in 1/10th volume of neutralization buffer (1 M Tris,
pH 8.5) and then pooled and applied to a 10K molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) Amicon
centrifuge tube (Millipore) for buffer exchange against PBS and sample concentration.

Samples were collected from SARS-CoV-2 infected volunteers (n=77) recruited from
Gauteng and the Western Cape provinces of South Africa from 10 April 2020 to 26 May
2020. Volunteers had previously undergone a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2 from an upper respiratory tract (nose/throat) swab collected
into viral transport media. Swabs were processed through approved assays in accredited
public and private clinical laboratories. Inclusion criteria were age >=18 years and a
confirmed positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2 on the national database of the National Health
Laboratory Services (NHLS). Of the 77 participants, 34 (44%) had a second positive PCR
result recorded within a week after the first positive test. With respect to disease severity, five
participants were asymptomatic, 23 had mild disease (characterised by mild upper respiratory
tract symptoms), 38 had moderate disease (defined by gastrointestinal symptoms or lower
respiratory tract symptoms), and two had severe disease (admission to hospital). Serum and
saliva samples were collected between 8 and 70 days after the first positive PCR test. Ethical
approval for these studies was obtained from the Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC)
of the University of Witwatersrand (M200468) and the University of Cape Town (UCT;
210/2020). All participants provided written, informed consent.

Pre-pandemic plasma (n=58) was obtained from banked human samples that were
collected from participants recruited from Cape Town, South Africa in 2011-2012, from a
study protocol approved by the HREC of the University of Cape Town (158/2010). Storage
consent was provided by all participants, and approval for use of the samples in this study
was obtained from the HREC, UCT. Samples came from participants who were HIVinfected (n=27) or HIV-uninfected (n=31). All participants had tested positive for exposure to
Mycobacterium tuberculosis based on a positive IFN-γ-release assay (QuantiFERON-TB
Gold In-Tube), i.e. were classified as having latent tuberculosis infection. The median age
was 26 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 22-34 years) and 44/58 (76%) were female. All HIVinfected individuals were antiretroviral treatment (ART)-naive, with a median CD4 count of
591 cells/mm3 (IQR: 511-749).

231

All samples were treated with 1% Triton-X100 (Sigma) for 60 min at room
temperature to inactivate any potentially live virus in the samples (Remy et al., 2019).

varying concentrations (1-4 µg/ml) of purified recombinant RBD or S1 proteins in PBS or
bicarbonate buffer (both Sigma). The following day, plates were washed five times using an
automated plate washer and incubated at room temperature in blocking solution (1% casein
or 3% non-fat powder milk prepared in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T)). After 1 h, the

plates were washed five times and incubated with goat anti-human IgG (Fc-specific)
peroxidase conjugate (1:5000; IgG-HRP, Sigma), or goat anti-human IgA (-chain specific),
F(ab’)2 fragment peroxidase conjugate (1:5000; IgA-HRP, Sigma) or goat anti-human IgM
peroxidase conjugate (1:2000; IgM-HRP, Southern Biotech) for 1 h at room temperature. The
plate was then developed using 100 µl O-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (OPD; Sigma)
for 12 min before the reaction was stopped with 50 µl 3M hydrochloric acid (HCl, Sigma).
The plates were read at 490 nm using a Versamax microplate reader (Molecular Devices)
using SoftMax Pro software (version 5.3). A cutoff for positivity was set at two standard
deviations (SD) above the mean optical density (OD) of pre-pandemic samples. For
determining endpoint titers, 2-fold serial dilutions were performed for 20 PCR+ samples and
40 pre-pandemic controls. Area under the curve (AUC) was determined and the positivity
threshold was calculated as before, mean+2SD. All patient samples were also analysed using
the anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA (IgG; Euroimmun), which uses the S1 domain of the spike
protein, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

The S1 and RBD portions of the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 were expressed in Nicotiana
benthamiana as fusions to the rabbit IgG Fc tag. Western blot and SDS-PAGE analysis
revealed expression of purified S1 (Figure 1A & B) and RBD (Figure 1C & D) at the
expected protein sizes of ~140kDa and ~100kDa, respectively. Higher molecular weight
bands of ~280kDa and ~200kDa indicated possible dimer formation of S1 and RBD,
respectively. In addition, lower molecular weight bands indicated potentially multiple
cleavage products of S1 and RBD in the preparations.

Serum samples were collected from 77 volunteers who had previously tested positive for
SARS-CoV-2 by PCR. The demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants are
summarized in Table 1. Just over half the participants were female, and the median age was
39 years. The date of onset of symptoms was not available, but samples were taken a median
of 6 weeks after SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity. The majority of patients (79%) experienced
mild or moderate COVID-19 disease. We also included 58 archived plasma samples from
HIV-infected and uninfected individuals collected prior to the pandemic (2011-2012) as
negative controls for our assay.

In order to test whether plant-produced SARS-CoV-2 antigens were able to detect virusspecific antibodies from infected patients, we screened convalescent sera from 77 volunteers
who had recovered from COVID-19. Individuals were tested for reactivity against both S1
and RBD antigens by a standard indirect ELISA based on a published protocol (Stadlbauer et
al., 2020). Archived pre-pandemic plasma samples from 58 individuals, including 27 HIVinfected persons, were used to test the background reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 S1 and RBD.
The threshold for positivity was set at two standard deviations above the mean optical density
(OD) of the pre-pandemic samples.

Of the 77 COVID-19 convalescent serum samples, 51 (66%) tested positive for
SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG against S1, and 48 (62%) tested positive against RBD (Figure 2A
& B). In contrast, only 1/58 pre-pandemic plasma samples showed reactivity above the
positivity cutoff. As expected, S1 and RBD IgG OD values correlated strongly (r=0.977;
p<0.0001; data not shown). In order to independently validate our results, the same sera were
run in a separate laboratory in a blinded manner, using a commercial IgG ELISA based on S1
antigen from Euroimmun. All samples that were positive by the commercial ELISA test for
SARS-CoV-2 S1 antibodies were positive in our assay (42/77). We detected nine additional
samples that were positive in our assay, two of which had high OD values well above our
threshold for positivity, and six that were also positive for RBD-specific IgG. We
demonstrated a strong and significant direct correlation for sample OD values between the
two assays (r=0.89, p<0.0001; Figure 2C). Of note, we found no association between SARS-

We next determined the titers of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG, IgM and IgA responses in a
subset of 20 SARS-CoV-2 convalescent serum samples and 40 pre-pandemic samples.
Assays were performed on serially diluted samples (Figure 3A-F) to determine endpoint
titers and AUC values for quantitative interrogation of the data (Figure 3G-L). S1-specific
IgG was detected in sera of 15/20 individuals (75%), IgM in 13/20 (65%) and IgA in 12/20
(70%) of individuals (Figure 3G-I). The median AUCs of IgG, IgM and IgA were
significantly higher in convalescent individuals compared to pre-pandemic (p<0.0001 for all).
Results for RBD-specific IgG were similar (Figure 3J-L). Interestingly, of the five SARSCoV-2 convalescent sera that tested S1 IgG negative, three had S1-specific IgM and one had
S1-specific IgA. Similarly, of the four samples negative for RBD-specific IgG three were
positive for IgM and one was double positive for IgM and IgA. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 S1specific antibodies were detected in 19/20 convalescent samples and RBD-specific antibodies
in 20/20 samples.

Further examination of S1-specific antibody isotypes revealed that approximately one
third of individuals were positive for IgG, IgM and IgA (n=7/19), a smaller proportion has
both IgG and IgM or IgG and IgA (n=3 and 4, respectively), while some individuals were
positive for only IgG (n=1), IgM (n=3) or IgA (n=1) (Figure 4A). RBD-specific isotypes
gave similar results (Figure 4B). There was a significant correlation between S1-specific IgG
and IgM (r=0.595, p<0.007; Figure 4C) and anti-RBD (r=0.045, p<0.045; data not shown).
S1-specific IgG showed a trend towards a correlation with IgA (r=0.423, p=0.07; Figure 4D),
whilst RBD-specific IgG correlated significantly with IgA (r=0.635, p<0.003; data not
shown). There was no correlation between IgM and IgA responses for either S1 or RBD (data
not shown).

Endpoint titers for S1- and RBD-specific IgG, IgM and IgA were determined. S1specific IgG endpoint titers in 33% of the samples were high (20% at 1:1600 and 13% at
1:800), 13% were moderate (1:400) and the majority (54%) of samples had low titers (27% at
1:50, 20% at 1:100 and 7% at 1:200) (Figure 4E). S1-specific IgA titers were lower than IgG
and only 2 individuals have a titer of 1:800 or 1:400 each, and the remaining 84% had low
titers (=<1:200; (Figure 4F). IgM titers for both S1 and RBD were all low (=<1:100; data not
shown). RBD-specific titers for IgG and IgM were similar to those S1, with the exception of
two donors who had titers of 1:3200 (data not shown).

Given that virus-specific serum antibodies were readily detectable using plant-produced

from 10 participants. In these preliminary analyses, 1/7 samples that had detectable S1specific serum IgG also demonstrated S1 IgG positivity in saliva (Figure 5A). Additionally,
2/5 IgA+ sera exhibited virus-specific IgA in saliva. An additional IgA+ sample was detected
in saliva but absent from the serum (Figure 5B). This indicated that IgA was more readily
detectable in saliva than IgG. Further analyses to determine robust thresholds for positivity of
saliva immunoglobulins will be performed going forward. These preliminary results
demonstrate the potential of our ELISA to detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in saliva.

The in-house ELISA diagnostic assay in this study was developed from the published
protocol (Stadlbauer et al., 2020). To determine whether we could further improve the
robustness and sensitivity of the in-house ELISA assay, we optimized different parameters,
including S1 and RBD antigen coating concentration as well as the coating and blocking
buffers. Coating concentrations of 1, 2 and 4µg/mL S1 and RBD were compared for SARSCoV-2-specific IgG detection in four SARS-CoV-2 convalescent volunteers and three prepandemic samples. Two and 4 µg/ml demonstrated a significantly higher reactivity than 1
µg/ml for both S1 and RBD (Figure 6A & B; p=0.0005 and p=0.004, respectively), with
little increase in the background (negative control) signal. Coating of ELISA plates with
antigen in different coating buffers, namely PBS and bicarbonate buffer, was also assessed
(Figure 6C). No differences were detected, so PBS was selected for our procedure. A
comparison of the blocking buffers PBS with 0.1% Tween-20 (PBS-T), PBS-T with 1%
casein and PBS-T with 3% non-fat milk powder was performed (Figure 6D). PBS-T with 1%
casein was selected based on background signal and positivity trends.

There is a critical need for the development of serological tests to detect SARS-CoV-2
antibodies. Population seroprevalence studies to estimate the extent of pandemic spread in
communities, and studies defining protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2, all depend on
reliable serological tests. In addition, serological assays are required for the development and
evaluation of an effective vaccine. Ideally, such tests need to be cost-effective and easy to
scale up to be beneficial in low-income settings. In this study, we describe the establishment
of an indirect SARS-CoV-2 antibody ELISA using the S1 and RBD antigens of the spike
protein of SARS-CoV-2 expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana. S protein domains were
selected because they are highly immunogenic and the primary target for neutralizing
antibodies (Berry et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2020). Using sera from convalescent volunteers
with a PCR-confirmed past SARS-CoV-2 infection, we detected SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG,
IgA and IgM to viral S1 and RBD. Our results were highly concordant with a widely used,
high sensitivity and specificity commercial S1 IgG ELISA kit (Euroimmun).

A range of expression systems exist for the generation of the recombinant proteins
required for serological assays. Plant protein expression systems have some advantages over
more widely-used mammalian or insect cell systems, as they do not require expensive media
or growth conditions (Shanmugaraj et al., 2020). They are also advantageous over bacterial or
yeast systems in that they may support post-translational modifications similar to that of
mammalian cell lines, and lack contaminating pathogens or endotoxins that pose a problem
when purifying desired proteins (Shanmugaraj et al., 2020; Maliga et al., 2004). Lack of
correct protein glycosylation and recombinant protein yield are cited as disadvantages to
using plants to express protein. However, Nicotiana benthamiana is favoured for protein
expression due to its rapid generation of biomass, a defective post-transcriptional gene
silencing system, and the extensive range of engineering strategies, including
glycoengineering, that can be applied along its secretory pathway; all of which may
overcome the challenge of low yield (Margolin et al., 2020). Thus, there is great potential to
use plant-based expression systems for the rapid generation of serological assay reagents and
even vaccines for pandemics, including the current global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

Using our ELISA with plant-derived recombinant viral proteins, we detected S1specific IgG in 66.2% and RBD-specific IgG in 62.3% of individuals who had tested positive
for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR in the past. Responses between the two protein fragments were
highly correlated, as predicted, and the small difference in reactivity was not unexpected,
given the greater number of epitopes in the larger S1 domain. Our sensitivity appears lower
than that reported in the literature, with a seroprevalence of 90.1%-100% in individuals
confirmed to have been SARS-CoV-2-infected by PCR (Amanat et al., 2020; Beavis et al.,
2020; Long et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020), and a lower seroprevalence (65.8%) in those who
were diagnosed <14 days before serological testing (Pollán et al., 2020). However, we
obtained highly concordant results between our assay and a validated commercial ELISA. In
fact, the reported manufacturer’s sensitivity of the Euroimmun S1-specific IgG ELISA is
94.4%. This suggests that the lack of S1-specific IgG detection from some recovered
COVID-19 patients in our cohort is more likely due to low or absent IgG antibody at the time
of sampling, rather than a lack of sensitivity in our assay. With regard to specificity, we
detected IgG cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 in 1/58 (1.7%) of pre-pandemic plasma
samples from a cohort of HIV-infected and uninfected volunteers with latent TB infection,
giving a specificity of 98.3%. Cross-reactive antibody responses, while lower in magnitude,
have been reported in SARS-CoV-2 unexposed individuals (Khan et al., 2020), and likely

result from past infections with common circulating hCoVs. Thus, our assay for SARS-CoV2-specific IgG performs as well as a widely used commercial kit in terms of sensitivity and
specificity, and is suitable for serological studies of humoral responses in the current
pandemic.

Several factors may affect antibody detection after SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Timing
of sampling is important, with IgM typically arising first, peaking two to three weeks after
symptom onset (Long et al., 2020). IgG is typically detected after IgM in serum, peaking at
roughly the same time (Huang et al., 2020). However, in SARS-CoV-2 infection, antibodies
may not follow this typical pattern of seroconversion (Long et al., 2020; Seow et al., 2020)
and seroconversion to a single Ig subclass has been described (Seow et al., 2020).
Interestingly, when investigating isotype responses in addition to IgG, we showed that a
further 4/20 (20%) donors had S1-specific IgA or IgM. Thus, in our initial screen where 34%
of individuals who had previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR had no detectable
IgG responses, 20% may have had isotype responses other than IgG. A recent study showed
that combined detection of IgG, IgM and IgA increased the overall detection of SARS-CoV-2
antibodies, enabling better identification of infected individuals with low antibody levels
(Faustini et al., 2020).

A further factor in detection of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is waning of the response
over time, which has potentially important consequences for the duration of protective
immunity and the risk of reinfection. One study showed a decrease in IgG in half of patients
tested, calculating an overall half-life of 36 days for IgG (Ibarrondo et al., 2020). Waning of
binding antibody responses to S and RBD has been reported soon after their peak,
particularly IgM and IgA antibodies, but IgG responses have shown persistence for greater
than 90 days post-illness onset (Seow et al., 2020; Wajnberg et al., 2020). A limitation of our
study was that we did not have information on the date of COVID-19 symptom onset in our
cohort, limiting our analyses to time post PCR positivity, which did not yield a relationship
with antibody positivity or OD value. Additional factors that may also influence antibody
generation and kinetics include disease severity, age and comorbidities. We found no
relationship between increasing disease severity and antibody positivity or OD value, likely
due to the fact that the majority of our study participants had mild to moderate COVID-19.

We determined endpoint titers of binding antibodies to S1 and RBD in a subset of 20
convalescent participants in our cohort. Several studies have demonstrated that binding
antibody titers against S correlate with neutralization capacity (Amanat et al., 2020; Okba et
al., 2020; Premkumar et al., 2020). A recent study reporting S-specific IgG titers in almost 20
000 patients screened for eligibility as convalescent plasma donors demonstrated that 70% of
IgG+ donors had high titers (>1:960) of antibodies (Wajnberg et al., 2020). Importantly,
100% of those with titers >2880 exhibited neutralizing activity (ID50 of >1:10). Although we
performed our study on a much smaller sample size, we detected titers of S1 or RDB-specific
IgG of up to 1:3200. However, the majority of donors (54%) had titers below 1:200, and only
a third of samples had high titers >1:800. Unsurprisingly, IgA and IgM titers were lower than
IgG titers, and did not exceed 1:800 for IgA and 1:400 for IgM. Further studies characterising
antibody titers in recovered COVID-19 patients in our setting are warranted.

Saliva is a non-invasive specimen that can be self-collected and thus represents an
attractive sample type for large-scale sampling such as in seroprevalence studies. We
demonstrate that our ELISA can detect SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and IgA not only in
serum, but also in saliva. Further optimization and validation will be required to establish the
conditions for optimal detection of antibodies in saliva, including the use of pre-pandemic

saliva samples. Recent studies have reported the detection of S-specific antibodies in saliva
(Faustini et al., 2020; Randad et al., 2020). Faustini et al. (2020) suggested that the use of
both serum and saliva samples increased the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses,
reporting substantial discordance between the two sample types. Although preliminary, our
results provide the basis for investigating the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in saliva
using antigens expressed in plants.

In conclusion, our study demonstrates that recombinant SARS-CoV-2 proteins
produced in plants enable the robust detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. One of
our aims was to develop a cost-effective serological assay for both large-scale
seroepidemiology as well as research studies of SARS-CoV-2 humoral immunity. We
achieved this by making use of plants for the production of viral antigens, which has the
benefit of rapid scale-up, and sourcing reagents that were available locally and thus available
at a lower cost. Our ELISA can be used to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and
describe the kinetics of the humoral immune response in infected individuals. Serological
studies in a setting like ours, in South Africa, where comorbidities such as HIV and TB are
highly prevalent, are underexplored and can benefit from this assay.
