ABSTRACT
Objectives: To evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on clinical and surgical practice,
educational activities, health and lifestyle behavior of Brazilian urology residents.
Materials and Methods: A web-based survey was sent to 468 Brazilian urology
residents from postgraduate years (PGY) 3 to 5 to collect data on clinical practice and
training after 4 months of COVID-19. We also assessed health-related and behavior
changes, rate of infection by SARS-CoV-2, deployment to the front line of COVID-19,
residents’ concerns, and access to personal protective equipment (PPE).
Results: Massive reductions in elective and emergency patient consultations, diagnostic
procedures and surgeries were reported across the country, affecting PGY 3 to 5 alike.
Most in-person educational activities were abolished. The median damage to the
urological training expected for 2020 was 6.0 [3.4 -7.7], on a scale from 0 to 10, with
senior residents estimating a greater damage (P< 0.001). Educational interventions
developed included online case-based discussions, subspeciality conferences and
lectures, and grand rounds. Most senior residents favored extending residency to
compensate for training loss and most younger residents favored no additional training
(p< 0.001). Modifications in health and lifestyle included weight gain (43.8%), reduced
physical activity (68.6%), increased alcoholic intake (44.9%) and cigarette consumption
(53.6%), worsening of sexual life (25.2%) and feelings of sadness or depression (48,2%).
Almost half were summoned to work on the COVID-19 front-line and 24.4% had
COVID-19. Most residents had inadequate training to deal with COVID-19 patients and
most reported a shortage of PPE. Residents’ concerns included the risk of contaminating
family members, being away from residency program, developing severe COVID-19 and
overloading colleagues.
Conclusions: COVID-19 had a massive impact in Brazilian urology residents´ training,
health and lifestyle behavior, which may reflect what happened in other medical
specialties. Studies should confirm these findings to help developing strategies to mitigate
residents’ losses.

INTRODUCTION
COVID-19 led to profound changes in the medical scenario worldwide, including
a massive reduction of face-to-face medical consultations and suspension or
postponement of elective surgical procedures(1, 2). In addition, it caused a redeployment
of health professionals to work at the front line caring for infected patients(3, 4).
Urological practice was immensely affected. A recent survey conducted among Brazilian
urologists showed an enormous reduction of patient visits, elective, and emergency
surgeries, as well as a drastic reduction of income all over the country(5).
Urology residency programs have been facing problems that include not only the
major cutback of residents’ participation in medical visits and surgeries, but also the
reduction of educational and scientific activities (3, 4, 6, 7). Moreover, residents represent
a large component of the workforce at various health facilities and in many hospitals they
have become critical at the front line of care for patients with COVID-19(3, 4).
Urology residents have dealt with major challenges not only in terms of medical
training, but also regarding their personal lives, health and well-being. Social distancing,
fear of contamination and/or transmitting the disease to relatives and reduction of income
are some of the problems and concerns affecting medical residents. Consistent with this,
a significant proportion have been experiencing anxiety and depression disorders (8, 9).
While the pandemic numbers went down in many countries for some time, a
second wave is effective in many regions (US, Europe)(10, 11). Some countries like
Brazil, Argentina and India persist with high COVID-19 infection rates(10, 12). As a
result, a significant detrimental impact on urology training has occurred and should
remain indefinitely in many countries.
Considering the unique behavior of COVID-19 in Brazil, we hypothesized that
Brazilian urology residents were severely impacted in their training, health and personal
lives and that the impact on urology training was more severe for senior residents.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the University of
Sao Paulo School of Medicine (project number CAPPESQ 13029/2020) and informed
consent was obtained from all participants.
An electronic survey was emailed to 468 eligible urology residents from
postgraduate years (PGY) 3 to 5 registered in the Brazilian Society of Urology, with no
incentives for completion. The first e-mail inviting the residents to participate was sent
on June/11/2020 and data collection was closed on June/19/2020, when the whole country
had lived the third month of social distance officially recommended by state and federal
sanitary authorities
The primary goal was to collect data on resident’s clinical practice and urological
training since the beginning of COVID-19. The survey included an assessment of sociodemographic, clinical practice, educational, health-related and behavior parameters. The
invitation e-mail contained a link to a 39 questions, web-based survey (Supplementary
Questionnaire).

Most questions were closed-ended, multiple choice. One question

evaluated the subjective degree of damage to the urological training based on the
residents’ educational expectations for 2020. It was evaluated with a visual analog scale
ranging from zero to ten, in which “zero” was the least possible educational damage.
We also investigated alternative educational activities that were implemented by
urology residency programs such as web meetings, web conferences and online education
programs.
We investigated the number of residents that were infected by SARS-CoV- 2, the
deployment to the front line of COVID-19 and other aspects associated with residents’
fears and concerns, and access to personal protective equipment. Changes in health
parameters and behaviors such as body weight, physical activities, alcohol and tobacco
consumption and sexual life were also evaluated.
Finally, based on the continental dimensions of Brazil and the varying incidence
rates of COVID-19 and stages of economic opening, we compared data from states that
were among the lowest incidence rates at the time of the survey (Minas Gerais, Goias,
Rio Grande do Sul and Parana) with those among the highest incidence states (São Paulo
and Rio de Janeiro)(12).

Data collection and Statistical analyses
Data were initially elaborated using Survey Monkey® software online.
Quantitative variables were expressed as medians and interquartile ranges, while
qualitative variables were expressed as absolute values, percentages, or proportions.
Student´s t or ANOVA was used to compare continuous variables.
Categorical variables were compared using the Chi-squared or Fisher’s exact test.
Associations were described as Odds Ratios with respective confidence intervals. All tests
were 2-sided and a p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. GraphPad
Prism, version 8.0.4, San Diego-CA, USA, was used for data analysis

RESULTS
A total of 275 (58.7%) subjects completed the survey. Most respondents (90.5%) were
men, and the median age was 30 years [28-31]. Ninety (32.7%) participants were from
PGY 3, 90 (32.7%) from PGY 4 and 95 (34.6%) from PGY 5. The distribution of
participants was proportional to the actual distribution of Brazilian urology residents
across the country’s five different geographic regions (supplementary material; p=0.632).
IMPACT OF COVID ON RESIDENTS’ CLINICAL AND SURGICAL
ACTIVITIES: Major reductions in elective and emergency patient consultations,
diagnostic procedures and surgeries were reported by residents from all states. Similar
reductions of elective visits (p=0.398), emergency visits (0.092), minor surgeries
(p=0.344), major surgeries (p=0.107), and diagnostic procedures (p=0.159) were
observed across residents from PGY 3, 4 and 5. There were no differences between states
with highest vs lowest incidence of COVID-19 (Table 1).

IMPACT ON EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES:
The impact of COVID-19 on urology residents’ educational program and scientific
activities is shown in Table 2, with major reductions in general urology and subspecialty
meetings in addition to in-person practical educational activities.
The median estimated damage to the urological training expected for 2020 in a scale from
0 to 10 was 6.0 [3.4-7.7]. PGY 4 and 5 residents estimated a greater damage for their

training than PGY 3 (P< 0.001; figure 1). Residents living in states with highest incidence
of COVID-19 did not differ from those living in lowest incidence states (p=0.777).

EDUCATIONAL INITIATIVES DURING THE PANDEMIC:
Since the start of COVID-19 pandemic, educational interventions developed by residency
programs to compensate for the deprivation of training were frequent and included: case
based discussions, journal club web meetings, subspeciality web conferences, prerecorded video lectures, online courses and online general urology department grand
rounds (Table 2). Asked about their preferred educational activities, online courses and
lectures were chosen as their favorite instructional method by 48.1% of the urology
residents, case-based discussions web meetings by 38.2% and didactic podcasts by
14.6%.
Regarding measures that should be adopted to compensate for the loss of their
urological training in 2020, 147 (53.6%) suggested postponing the finishing date of the
residency program, 57 (20.8%) suggested additional training in specific subspecialties
and 70 (25.6%) required no compensation. Urology residents’ perceptions regarding the
need for additional training were significantly different according to postgraduate year,
with senior residents favoring extending residency for some months and younger
residents favoring no additional training (p< 0.001; Figure 1).
IMPACT ON RESIDENTS’S HEALTH: The impact of COVID-19 on urology
residents’ health is shown in Table 3. A total of 148 (53.8%), 54 (19.6%) and 73 (26.6%)
considered themselves healthy, moderately healthy and not healthy, respectively. Weight
gain was reported by 43.8% and 68.6% reported a reduction of physical activities. Of the
28 (11.4%) participants who declared being tobacco smokers, cigarette consumption
increased for 15 (53.6%) and decreased for 2 (7.1%) residents. Among the participants
who drink alcoholic beverages, increased consumption was reported by 44.9%. A total of
169 (61,68%), 44 (16.06%) and 61(22,26%) considered themselves satisfied, neither
satisfied nor dissatisfied and dissatisfied with their sexual life, respectively. In
comparison with their pre-pandemic sexual life, 163 (59.5%) subjects reported their
sexual life remained stable, 69 (25.2%) reported it became worse and 42 (15.3%) reported
an improvement. Feelings of sadness or depression were reported as at least sometimes
by 87 (31.7%) and frequent by 45 (16.5%) residents.

In June/2020, 67 (24.4%) of Brazilian urology residents had had COVID-19,
including 18.6% with unequivocal laboratory confirmation and 5.8% with a diagnosis
based on clinical, epidemiological and radiological parameters. In all instances, the
clinical presentation was mild or moderate and none required hospitalization. Also, 135
(49.3%) had been summoned up to work in the front-line treatment of COVID-19
patients. Of those directly involved in the treatment of patients infected by SARS-CoV2,70 (25.4%) reported receiving adequate training to work with such patients while 103
(37.7%) and 100 (36.6%) reported inadequate or no training, respectively.
Regarding the support received from their staff/mentors during the pandemics, 140
(51.1%) of the participants were satisfied or very satisfied, 78 (28.5%) were neither
satisfied nor dissatisfied and 56 (20.4%) were dissatisfied or very dissatisfied.
Among the concerns regarding being infected with SARS-CoV-2, the risk of
contaminating family members was reported by 234 (85.7%) residents, being away from
the residency program and fail to complete their training by 174 (63.7%), developing
COVID-19 by 129 (47.2%), being away from hospital and overloading their colleagues
by 114 (41.7%) and being summoned up to work in the front line by 53 (19.4%) residents.
Fifty-two (19.0%) residents changed their housing to self-isolate and avoid the risk of
transmitting the disease to a family member. A shortage of PPE was reported by most
residents, including N-95 masks by 124 (61.4%) residents, waterproof apron by 101
(50.8%), protective glasses or face shield by 80 (42.2%) surgical masks by 54 (28.4%)
and caps by 39 (20.3%) residents.

DISCUSSION
We have shown a massive impact of COVID-19 on urology residents' clinical
practice and education, regardless of the post graduate year or whether they train in a state
among the highest or lowest incidence of COVID-19. They have all experienced the
cessation or postponement of elective and preventive consultations, diagnostic procedures
and non-emergency surgeries. Training was thus severely impaired and junior residents
were less worried about their education breach, having evaluated the damage to their
training as significantly less severe than PGY 4 and 5 residents. Moreover, significant
changes in health and lifestyle were observed, with a great proportion of residents
considering themselves not healthy (46.2%), reporting feelings of sadness or depression

(48.2%), reporting weight gain (43.8%), reduction of physical activities (68.6%),
increased alcoholic intake (44.9%) and decreased satisfaction with sexual life (25.2%).
Finally, almost half of Brazilian urology residents had been summoned up to work in the
front-line treatment of COVID-19 patients and 24.4% had acquired COVID-19 at the time
of the survey.
Our study was performed in June/2020, when Brazil ranked second among the countries
with the highest number of deaths due to COVID-19 in the world (12, 13). As we finish
the preparation of this manuscript, in early December/2020, Brazil has maintained a very
high incidence of COVID-19 and is experiencing a second wave as many countries
worldwide(13). Governmental guidelines supporting economy closure or reopening and
social distancing have varied during the year and a return to more restrictive
recommendations is evolving in response to the second wave of the pandemics. As a
result, a sustained detrimental impact on residents’ training is to be expected.
A total of 458 eligible Brazilian urology residents received a link to the survey, of which
275 (58.7%) participated. Because we gave no incentives to participants and we used a
long questionnaire (39 questions), we consider our participation rate as very good, and in
line with recent online surveys evaluating medical residents, in which participation rates
varied from 45% to 60.8% (3, 4).The distribution of respondents was in accordance with
the actual distribution of residents throughout the different states of the country and also
regarding gender and the post graduate year, confirming a well-balanced and
representative participant distribution.

We observed a greater than 50% reduction in elective patient visits, diagnostic
procedures, elective surgeries and in 22.9% of urgent consultations. Residents from
different PGY were similarly affected. In a study that evaluated the impact of COVID-19
in Italian residents, a severe reduction (>40%) or complete suppression (>80%) of
training exposure ranged between 41.1% and 81.2% for “clinical” activities and between
44.2% and 62.1% for “surgical” activities (3). The reductions were more pronounced for
residents who attended the last year of training. This possibly reflects the heterogeneity
of urological training in various residency programs or different policies for restriction of
surgical procedures in the two countries. Although the impact on training has been
profound among all residents in Brazil, PGY 4 and 5 residents reported more severe
damage to their education, which may reflect the perceived opportunity of PGY 3 urology

residents to compensate for their educational losses in the following two years of
residency.
Urology residency programs cancelled most educational/scientific in-person
activities and developed a number of online educational programs including case based
discussion and journal club web meetings, subspeciality web conference, pre-recorded
video lectures, online courses and online general urology department grand rounds. (7,
14) Furthermore, local, national, and international societies have implemented various
educational activities such as webinars with ample access to participants that have also
contributed to mitigate residents’ educational curtailment(6, 15, 16).
Although online activities have served as a strong tool for medical education since
the beginning of the pandemics, people are getting exhausted with this format(17). Being
on a video call or teleconference requires more focus than face-to-face meetings and
lectures because it is harder to process non-verbal cues like facial expressions, the tone
and pitch of the voice, and body language(17). In addition, many of us are using video
calls at work, family celebrations and interaction with friends. Everything seems to be
happening in the same place, which further contributes to negative feelings for online
meetings. Moreover, the online meetings remind us of the people, opportunities, and
lifestyle that we have lost temporarily.

A significant impact was observed in several health indicators of urology
residents. Almost half of the participants considered themselves moderately healthy
(19.6%) or not healthy (26.6%). The mental afflictions resulting from the COVID
pandemic may have an important role in this self-reported perception of general wellbeing as well as in the high rates of depressive feelings reported. Similar findings have
been observed with French urology residents, of whom 56.5% reported medium to high
levels of stress (8). A survey with American urology residents demonstrated that
perception of access to personal protection equipment, local COVID-19 severity and
perception of susceptible household members are important risk factors of mental health
outcomes(18). All of these risk factors were present among Brazilian urologists.
To protect their families, many healthcare providers have chosen to isolate
themselves. (19) In our study, 20.0% of urology residents changed their housing status,
to avoid transmitting COVID-19 to a family member. Home confinement is also a factor
that might influence alcohol misuse, physical and sexual activity (20-23). A significant

decrease of physical activity has been shown in the general population during the COVID19 pandemic(9). In the present study, 68.6% of the participants reported reduced physical
activity. Many reported weight gain (43.8%) while 14.6% had weight loss. Increased
alcoholic intake during the COVID-19 pandemic was reported by 44.9% of the urology
residents, which was much higher than the 17.6% increase observed in the general adult
Brazilian population(9). A similar finding occurred regarding tobacco consumption,
which increased for 53.4% of the smoking participants while only 34.0% of the smokers
in the general Brazilian population reported increased tobacco consumption during the
pandemic(9). These numbers are alarming and may reflect the increased distress caused
by the pandemic among health professionals.
Sexual life satisfaction is an important issue related to mental health status. A
recent study with French urologists residents demonstrated that sexual intercourse is a
protective factors for burnout(24). In our study, 25.2% of the urology residents reported
being dissatisfied with their sexual life. Compared to pre-COVID-19 status, 25.18% of
the respondents reported a worse sexual life. Similar findings showing worsening of
sexual life were found among urologists in Brazil and the general population(5, 25).
A clinical infection by SARS-CoV-2 was reported by 24.4% of the participants.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to report on COVID-19 infection rates among
urology residents and surgical residents in general. The infection rate in Brazilian urology
residents seems much higher than expected and surpass the infection rate of 13.5%
reported by urologists in Brazil.(5) A recent meta-analysis showed that around 10% of
healthcare personnel working in hospitals had a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection and the
risk was higher among nurses.(26) In our study, none of the participants who had a clinical
infection by the COVID-19 required hospitalization. This is in great contrast with the
high rates of more severe COVID-9 in Brazilian urologists, among whom 34% required
hospitalization.(5) A recent meta-analyses showed a prevalence of severe COVID-19 of
5% among healthcare workers, while 0.5% died because of the complications of the
disease.(26) Certainly, the age difference between participants in the present study and
the one with urologists in Brazil (median of 30 and 46.0 years, respectively) was the main
reason for the observed difference in clinical severity of COVID-19.(27)
Involvement of residents in COVID-19 care varied substantially by specialty in
different countries. Some may be caring for patients with COVID-19 during assigned
rotations while others may be voluntarily redeployed to work with these patients. Half of
the participants of the present study have been summoned up to work in the front-line

care of patients with COVID-19. This is in contrast with urology and surgery residents in
Italy, of whom only 7.7% and 14.8% were moved to the front-line care of COVID-19
patients. (3, 28)A significant proportion of participants showed preoccupations regarding
being dislocated to the front-line treatment of COVID-19. Most frequent concerns were
transmitting infection to family members, compromising their urological training, being
infected with COVID-19 and maintenance of financial support. These concerns are in line
with those reported in other studies.(28, 29)
Only 25.4% of the respondents reported receiving adequate training to work with
COVID-19 patients and most residents reported insufficient availability of PPE, including
surgical masks (28.4% of the participants), N-95 masks (61.4%), face shield (42.2%) and
waterproof apron (50.8%). The combination of working in the front-line care of patients
with COVID-19 with inadequate training for dealing with these patients and insufficient
PPE availability may have contributed to the high rate of COVID-19 infection among
participants. In a recent manuscript published in the New England Journal of Medicine,
Gallagher and Schleyer remind us of the personal risks health care professionals face
when caring for patients with communicable diseases (29). We want to join them in
praising our medical students and trainees for stepping up during the Covid-19 pandemic
despite their risks and fears.
Asked about what should be done to mitigate their training breach throughout
2020, most proposed extending the training program for some months. Additional
training in subspecialties was also recommended by many participants. In a study
conducted in India with ophthalmology residents, eighty percent felt the pandemic had
damaged their medical education and suggested that extending the residency period
would be necessary (30, 31)
The main strengths of this study are the large number of participants, the balanced
distribution of residents from different postgraduate years and the comprehensive
evaluation of various aspects of medical practice, educational activities and health and
lifestyle parameters, allowing us to make a reliable picture of the impact of the pandemic
on urology residents in Brazil. This is the first study to report on COVID-19 infection
rates among residents of a surgical specialty. The cross-sectional design, providing an
evaluation of a single snapshot in time is a limitation of the study. As the pandemics has
assumed different faces throughout the year, residents’ mood and perceptions may
certainly fluctuate with time. The questionnaire is long, which may make participants
bored through the process of answering it. Nevertheless, the response rates were very

high. Another point is that the instruments used to evaluate many of the parameters are
not validated. For instance, mental health was assessed using a single question, instead of
a validated questionnaire. Despite these limitations, our findings seem to present a reliable
picture of the impact of COVID-19 in a number of aspects of Brazilian urology residents´
education, health and lifestyle behavior than can possibly be expanded for residents from
other medical specialties. Further studies should confirm these findings and expand on
the evaluation of the detrimental impacts of COVID-19 in medical residents from
different specialties to help developing strategies to mitigate their losses.

CONCLUSION
COVID-19 had a massive impact on Brazilian urology residents' clinical practice
and education. Training was severely impaired and junior residents perceived the damage
to their education as less severe than senior residents. Significant changes in health and
lifestyle were observed, with many residents reporting weight gain, reduced physical
activity, increased alcoholic intake and cigarette consumption, worsening of sexual life
and feelings of sadness or depression. Finally, almost half of Brazilian urology residents
had been summoned to work on the front-line treatment of COVID-19 patients and a
quarter had acquired COVID-19 at the time of the survey.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
