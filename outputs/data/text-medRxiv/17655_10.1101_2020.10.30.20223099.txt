ABSTRACT

34
35

Rapid tests to evaluate SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses are urgently needed to decipher

36

protective immunity and aid monitoring vaccine-induced immunity. Using a rapid whole blood

37

assay requiring minimal amount of blood, we measured qualitatively and quantitatively SARS-

38

CoV-2-specific CD4 T cell responses in 31 healthcare workers, using flow cytometry. 100% of

39

COVID-19 convalescent participants displayed a detectable SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cell

40

response. SARS-CoV-2-responding cells were also detected in 40.9% of participants with no

41

COVID-19-associated symptoms or who tested PCR negative. Phenotypic assessment indicated

42

that, in COVID-19 convalescent participants, SARS-CoV-2 CD4 responses displayed an early

43

differentiated memory phenotype with limited capacity to produce IFNɣ. Conversely, in

44

participants with no reported symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 CD4 responses were enriched in late

45

differentiated cells, co-expressing IFNɣ and TNFα and also Granzyme B. This proof of concept

46

study presents a scalable alternative to PBMC-based assays to enumerate and phenotype SARS-

47

CoV-2-responding T cells, thus representing a practical tool to monitor adaptive immunity in

48

vaccine trials.

INTRODUCTION

50
51

The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection (causing the disease known as COVID-19) that first

52

emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019, was declared a global pandemic on 12th March

53

2020, and is affecting all countries of the world, including those of Africa (Margolin et al., 2020).

54

There is an urgent need to understand better the clinical manifestations and the pathogenesis of

55

SARS-CoV-2 in order to develop relevant tools, including diagnostic tests, treatments and

56

vaccines, to stop the spread of disease as well as strategies to best manage this disease in all

57

population groups.

58
59

The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 is very wide, from asymptomatic through mild flu-like

60

symptoms to severe pneumonia and death. Understanding what constitutes immune protection

61

against SARS-CoV-2 is key to predicting long-term immunity and to inform vaccine design.

62

While much emphasis has been placed on the B cell and antibody response, it is not yet clear

63

what type of immune response confers protection to SARS-CoV-2 (Cox and Brokstad, 2020).

64

Several studies suggest that the T cell response may play an important role in SARS-CoV-2

65

pathogenesis and reports indicating that patients lacking B cells can recover from SARS-CoV-2

66

infection further highlight the likely importance of T cell immunity (Altmann and Boyton, 2020);

67

(Quinti et al., 2020). Additionally, accumulating evidence indicates that the presence of pre-

68

existing, cross-reactive memory T cells specific for common cold coronaviruses may affect

69

susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and partially explain the markedly divergent clinical

70

manifestations of COVID-19 (Braun et al., 2020; Canete and Vinuesa, 2020; Lipsitch et al., 2020;

71

Sette and Crotty, 2020).

72
73

Efficient, sensitive and simple assessment of human T-cell immunity remains a challenge. Most

74

commonly used T cell assays necessitate the isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells

75

(PBMC), requiring significant amount of blood. Therefore, whole blood assays could be more

76

advantageous than PBMC-based methods, by significantly reducing blood volume (~ 1 ml),

77

making them more applicable to paediatric populations. Moreover, such assays are rapid, as they

78

don’t require cell separation, and preserve the physiologic cellular and soluble environments,

79

mimicking better human blood condition. Here we report a rapid (~ 7 hrs) whole blood-based

80

detection method of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses with simple steps that could be

81

adapted to settings of limited resources. This rapidly applicable assay could represent an easily

82

standardizable tool to assess SARS-CoV-2-specific adaptive immunity to monitor T cell

83

responses in vaccine trials, gain insight into what constitutes a protective response, or define the

84

prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 T cell responders population wide.

METHODS

86
87

Study population

88

The population studied consisted of healthcare workers (HCW, n=31, 29% male) recruited

89

between July and September 2020, from Groot Schuur Hospital in Cape Town, the hardest hit

90

region of the initial COVID-19 epidemic in South Africa (Mendelson et al., 2020). Participants

91

were classified according to i) reporting of COVID-19-associated symptoms, ii) whether a

92

SARS-CoV-2 RNA PCR from a nasal or pharyngeal swab was performed and iii) SARS-CoV-2

93

PCR results. Based on these criteria, participants were subdivided into three groups: 1) persons

94

with no COVID-19-associated symptoms (n=15); 2) persons who reported symptoms but tested

95

SARS-CoV-2 PCR negative (n = 7); and 3) persons who had COVID-19-associated symptoms

96

and tested SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive (n = 9) (Table 1). In all groups, the exposure to COVID-

97

19 patients was comparable (86.8 to 100%). All participants with PCR confirmed COVID-19 had

98

mild symptoms and did not require hospitalization. Blood samples were obtained a median of 7.3

99

weeks post-SARS-CoV-2 testing in persons with a negative test results and 4.7 weeks in those

100

with a confirmed positive result (p=0.09). All participants were symptom-free at the time of

101

sampling. In four SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive participants, a second sample was obtained 1

102

month later. The University of Cape Town’s Faculty of Health Sciences Human Research Ethics

103

Committee approved the study (HREC: 207/2020) and written informed consent was obtained

104

from all participants.

105
106

Measurement of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid-specific IgG in plasma

107

The measurement of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies was performed using the Roche Elecsys®

108

Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland). This semi-

109

quantitative electro-chemiluminescent immunoassay measures SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid-

110

specific IgG. The assay was performed by the South African National Health Laboratory Service

(NHLS) and interpreted according to manufacturers’ instructions (Roche: V 1.0 2020-05).

112

Results are reported as numeric values in form of a cut-off index (COI; signal sample/cut-off),

113

where a COI < 1.0 corresponds to non-reactive plasma and COI ≥ 1.0 to reactive plasma. At 14

114

days post-SARS-CoV-2 PCR confirmation, the sensitivity and specificity of the Elecsys® Anti-

115

SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay is reported as 99.5% (95% CI, 97.0 to 100.0%) and 99.80% (95%

116

CI, 99.69 to 99.88%), respectively (Favresse et al., 2020; Muench et al., 2020; National, 2020).

117
118

SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralisation assay

119

Patient plasma was evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation activity using a SARS-CoV-2

120

pseudovirus infection assay. Single-cycle infectious SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirions based on the

121

HIV backbone expressing the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein and a firefly luciferase reporter

122

were produced in HEK-293TT cells (Buck et al., 2004; Buck et al., 2005) by co-transfection of

123

plasmids pNL4-3.Luc.R-.E- (NIH AIDS Reagent Program (#3418), Germantown, MD, USA) and

124

pcDNA3.3-SARS-CoV-2-spike Δ18 (Rogers et al., 2020). HEK-293TT cell culture supernatants

125

containing the virions were harvested 3 days post transfection and incubated with heat-inactivated

126

patient plasma at 5-fold serial dilutions for 60 min at 37˚C. Plasma/pseudovirus mixtures were

127

then used for transfection of HEK-293T cells stably expressing the ACE2 receptor (Mou et al.,

128

2020). Cells were lysed 3 days post infection using the Promega cell culture lysis reagent

129

(Promega Biosciences Inc., San Luis Obispo, CA, USA) and assessed for luciferase activity using

130

a GloMax® Explorer Multimode Microplate Reader (Promega Biosciences) together with the

131

Luciferase assay system (Promega Biosciences).

132
133

Whole blood-based T cell detection assay

134

Blood was collected in sodium heparin tubes and processed within 3 h of collection. The whole

135

blood-based SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell detection assay was adapted from a previously reported

136

whole blood intracellular cytokine detection assay designed to quantitate Mycobacterium

137

tuberculosis specific T cells in small volumes of blood (Hanekom et al., 2004). However,

138

significant modifications have been made, including a reduced incubation time, the usage of a

139

fixation buffer allowing the simultaneous lysis of red blood cells to streamline processing time,

140

leading to faster acquisition of results (Riou et al., 2020). Here, we adapted this assay to detect

141

SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells using synthetic SARS-CoV-2 PepTivator peptides (Miltenyi

142

Biotec, Surrey, UK), consisting of 15-mer sequences with 11 amino acid overlap covering the

143

immunodominant parts of the spike (S) protein, and the complete sequence of the nucleocapsid

144

(N) and membrane (M) proteins. All peptides were combined in a single pool and used at a final

145

concentration of 1 µg/ml. The workflow of the assay is presented in Figure 1. Briefly, 400 µl

146

whole blood was stimulated with the SARS-CoV-2 S, N and M protein peptide pool at 37°C for 5

147

hrs in the presence of the co-stimulatory antibodies against CD28 and CD49d (1µg/ml each; BD

148

Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) and Brefeldin-A (10µg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO,

149

USA). Unstimulated blood was incubated with co-stimulatory antibodies, Brefeldin-A and an

150

equimolar amount of DMSO. Red blood cell lysis and white cell fixation was then performed as a

151

single step using a Transcription Factor Fixation buffer (eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA) for

152

20 minutes. At this stage cells were cryopreserved in freezing media (50% foetal bovine serum,

153

40% RPMI and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide) and stored in liquid nitrogen until batched analysis.

154
155

Cell staining was performed on cryopreserved cells that were thawed, washed and permeabilised

156

with a Transcription Factor perm/wash buffer (eBioscience). Cells were then stained at room

157

temperature for 30 min with antibodies for CD3 BV650, CD4 BV785, CD8 BV510, CD45RA

Alexa 488, CD27 PE-Cy5, CD38 APC, HLA-DR BV605, Ki67 PerCP-cy5.5, PD-1 PE,

159

Granzyme B (GrB) BV421, IFNɣ BV711, TNFα PE-Cy7 and IL-2 PE/Dazzle 594, as detailed in

160

Supplementary Table 1. Samples were acquired on a BD LSR-II and analysed using FlowJo

161

(v9.9.6, FlowJo LCC, Ashland, OR, USA). A positive response was defined as any cytokine

162

response that was at least twice the background of unstimulated cells. To define the phenotype of

167

Graphical representations were performed in Prism (v8.4.3; GraphPad Software Inc, San Diego,

169

Prism. Non-parametric tests were used for all comparisons. The Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s

170

multiple comparison test was used for multiple comparisons and the Mann-Whitney and

171

Wilcoxon matched pairs test for unmatched and paired samples, respectively.

RESULTS

173
174

Serological assessment of SARS-CoV-2 sensitization.

175

Even though RT-PCR is the most specific technique to detect acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, the

176

positivity rate drops rapidly as soon as 10 days post-symptom onset, particularly in individuals

177

with mild forms of COVID-19 (Liu et al., 2020a; Liu et al., 2020b). Hence, serology assays

178

provide an important complement to RNA testing to identify individuals who have been

179

sensitized by SARS-CoV-2. Thus, to assess potential SARS-CoV-2 sensitization in participants

180

who did not have a SARS-CoV-2 PCR test performed or tested PCR negative, the presence of

181

SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies (e.g. SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid-specific IgG) was measured

182

and a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralisation assay was also performed in all participants.

183

While all participants with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test exhibited in vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2

184

neutralizing activity and 8/9 (88.8%) had detectable SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid-specific IgG,

185

none of the participants who tested negative or did not undergo PCR testing were positive for

186

SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid-specific IgG (Figure 2A) or displayed robust in vitro anti-SARS-

187

CoV-2 activity (Figure 2B). Overall, these results confirmed that PCR positive participants had

188

been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and mounted an immune response to the virus and suggested

189

that none of the participants who did not have a PCR test performed or tested PCR negative,

190

despite experiencing COVID-19-like symptoms, have been SARS-CoV-2 infected.

191
192

Magnitude and functional profile of SARS-CoV-2-responding CD4 T cells.

193

Amongst the 31 participants tested, 58% (n=18) had a detectable SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T

194

cell response (producing any of the measured cytokines, IFNɣ, TNFα or IL-2) using the described

195

whole blood assay (Figure 3A). We then defined the magnitude and phenotype of SARS-CoV-2

196

-specific CD4 responses according to participants’ clinical characteristics (Figure 3B&C). All

197

HCW with self-reported symptoms and a SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive test (n=9) were found to

198

have SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells (median frequency: 0.47%, IQR: 0.28-0.65) (Figure

199

3C). Of note, the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 specific CD4 T cells did not associate with the

200

magnitude of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid-specific IgG (p = 0.64, r = -0.18) or plasma

201

neutralizing activity (p = 0.46, r = 0.28) (data not shown). Interestingly, in participants with no

202

detectable SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid-specific IgG or neutralizing antibody activity, of those

203

with self-reported symptoms, 3/7 (43%) had detectable SARS-CoV-2-responding CD4 T cells

204

(median of responders: 0.02%, IQR: 0.019-0.03) and 6/15 (40%) of those with no self-reported

205

symptoms had detectable SARS-CoV-2-responding CD4 T cells (median of responders: 0.15%,

206

IQR: 0.05-1.47), suggesting that these responses correspond to SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive

207

memory CD4 T cells.

208

Next, we defined the polyfunctional profile of SARS-CoV-2-responding CD4 T cells, based on

209

their capacity to co-express IL-2, IFNγ or TNFα (Figure 3D). The overall functional profile of

210

SARS-CoV-2-specific cells in PCR positive participants was distinct from participants with no

211

reported symptoms (p=0.0002). Indeed, the SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 response in PCR+

212

participants was characterized by limited expression of IFNγ and was enriched in cells co-

213

expressing IL-2 and TNFα. On the contrary, in participants reporting no symptom, most SARS-

214

responding CD4 cells were distributed between triple functional cells (IL-2+IFNγ+TNFα+) and

215

cells co-producing IFNγ and TNFα. Overall, in this assay TNFα was the predominant cytokine

216

produced, with its production being significantly higher compared to IL-2 (p = 0.0026) and IFNγ

217

(p < 0.0001) (Supplementary Figure 2).

218
219

Phenotypic assessment of SARS-CoV-2-responding CD4 T cells

220

While the proposed assay can be performed using a limited antibody panel to identify the

221

frequency of SARS-CoV-2-responding T cells, by solely measuring cytokine production, the use

222

of a more extensive antibody panel also permits definition of the phenotypic profile of these cells.

223

To this end, we included additional markers to assess the memory differentiation (CD27,

10

224

CD45RA), cytotoxic potential (GrB) and activation profile (HLA-DR, CD38, Ki67, PD-1) of

225

SARS-CoV-2-responding CD4 T cells.

226

Figure 4A&B shows that in all individuals with symptoms, SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells

227

displayed almost exclusively (median: 97.7%) an early differentiated memory phenotype (ED:

228

CD45RA-CD27+). On the contrary, in 4/6 HCW with no symptoms, SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4

229

T cells exhibited a predominant late differentiated phenotype (LD: CD45RA-CD27-).

230

While the role of cytotoxic CD4 T cells is still unclear, the presence of these cells has been

231

described in several viral infections (Juno et al., 2017). We thus measured GrB expression in

232

SARS-CoV-2-responding CD4 T cells. While GrB was barely detectable in SARS-CoV-2-

233

specific CD4 T cells in PCR positive participants, elevated GrB expression was observed in 4 out

234

of 6 participants without symptoms (Figure 4C&D). Moreover, the proportion of ED SARS-

235

CoV-2-responding CD4 T cells inversely associated with GrB expression (p = 0.002, r = -0.71)

236

and the proportion of IFNγ and TNFα dual producing cells (p < 0.0001, r = -0.84) (Figure 4E).

237

The phenotypic characteristics of GrB expressing SARS-CoV-2-responding CD4 T cells (i.e.

238

highly differentiated and producing IFNγ and TNFα) are in agreement with a recent report

239

describing CMV-specific CD4 CTL T cells (Pachnio et al., 2016).

240
241

To determine if the overall phenotypic profile of SARS-CoV-2-responding CD4 T cells allowed

242

discrimination of participants based on their clinical characteristics, we performed a hierarchical

243

clustering analysis (Figure 5A) and a principal component analysis (PCA) (Figure 5B),

244

including four parameters (e.g. proportion of IFNγ+TNFα+IL2+ and IFNγ-TNFα+IL2+ cells,

245

proportion of ED, and GrB expression). Both analyses show that participants who reported no

246

symptoms and were negative for SARS-CoV-2 Abs separated clearly from PCR positive

247

participants. Conversely, PCR and SARS-CoV-2 antibody negative HCWs reporting symptoms

248

could not be separated from PCR positive participants. The loading plot shows that GrB

249

expression and the proportion of triple positive cells were the main drivers permitting the

Lastly, as the expression of activation markers (HLA-DR, CD38, PD-1 or Ki67) on antigen-

254

specific T cells are indicative of active infection (Chen and Wherry, 2020; Mathew et al., 2020),

255

we defined the expression of these markers on SARS-CoV-2-responding CD4 T cells. No

256

significant difference was observed in any of the measured markers amongst the different groups,

257

notwithstanding a few outliers observed in the PCR positive participant group (Figure 6A).

258

Interestingly, regardless of the participants’ clinical characteristics, PD-1 expression was highly

259

expressed on SARS-CoV-2-responding CD4 T cells, raising the question of a potential intrinsic

260

dysfunction/exhaustion of coronavirus-specific memory CD4 T cells (Jubel et al., 2020; Wherry

261

and Kurachi, 2015; Wykes and Lewin, 2018). We then defined the relationship between the

262

activation profile of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells and time post positive PCR test.

263

Figure 6B shows that in PCR positive participants, the expression of CD38 associated strongly

264

with the time post PCR testing (p <0.0001, r = -0.91), where CD38 expression decreased sharply

265

in the first 2 to 3 weeks post testing, suggesting a rapid clearance of the pathogen. Similar

266

associations where observed for all tested activation markers, with CD38 expression showing the

267

strongest correlation (Figure 6C).

DISCUSSION

269
270

In this proof of concept analysis assessing the use of a simple whole blood assay to

271

measure SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses in a small health care worker cohort, we show

272

that SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells (expressing IFNγ, TNFα or IL-2) were easily detectable

273

in all tested convalescent COVID-19 participants. However, in participants who did not

274

experience any COVID-19-related symptoms or tested SARS-CoV-2 PCR negative (despite

275

reporting symptoms), 9/22 (40.9%) also exhibited a detectable SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cell

276

response. Nevertheless, the median frequency of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells in the latter

277

groups was ~ 5-fold lower compared to SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive participants. Importantly,

278

unlike convalescent COVID-19 participants, none of participants without symptoms or who

279

tested PCR negative had detectable SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid-specific IgG or displayed robust

280

neutralizing activity. This strongly suggests that in these participants, SARS-CoV-2-responding

281

CD4 T cells may correspond to a pre-existing cross-reactive memory CD4 T cell response. Thus,

282

the sole presence SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4 T cells does not permit to infer SARS-CoV-2

283

infection or sensitization. These findings are in line with a number of studies demonstrating the

284

presence of SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4 T cells in 40 to 60% of SARS-CoV-2-unexposed

285

individuals in different populations around the world (Grifoni et al., 2020; Le Bert et al., 2020;

286

Rydyznski Moderbacher et al., 2020; Sekine et al., 2020). Additionally, it is important to point

287

out that all these studies were performed using PBMC and it is encouraging to find that a whole

288

blood-based assay using limited amount of blood (< 1ml) yields comparable results.

289

Further analyses of the polyfunctional and phenotypical profile of SARS-CoV-2-specific

290

CD4 T cells revealed that regardless of the clinical characteristics of the participants, the most

291

prevalent cytokine detected in response to SARS-CoV-2 peptides was TNFα. These observations

292

are in accordance with other studies pointing out an impairment of SARS-CoV-2 adaptive

293

immune responses, characterized by low level of type I and type II interferon (Blanco-Melo et al.,

13

294

2020; Sattler et al., 2020). However, it is also possible that the limited IFNγ production, we

295

observed in this study, is related to the short stimulation time (e.g. 5hrs) used in the assay.

296

Nevertheless, this suggests that TNFα could be a more reliable target than IFNγ, to detect SARS-

297

CoV-2-specific CD4 T cell responses. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2-responding CD4 T cells in all

298

participants were characterized by elevated of PD-1 expression. Such profiles have been observed

299

in acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and is likely driven by ongoing viral replication (Schub et al.,

300

2020; Sekine et al., 2020; Zheng et al., 2020). However, PD-1 expression on antigen-specific T

301

cells has been shown to decrease upon pathogen clearance (Barber et al., 2006; Sester et al.,

302

2008). Thus, elevated PD-1 expression in COVID-19 convalescent persons and uninfected

303

responders could reflect an intrinsic state of functional exhaustion of SARS-CoV-2-reactive

304

memory CD4 T cells.

305

Lastly, SARS-CoV-2-responding CD4 T cells were qualitatively different between

306

convalescent COVID-19 participants and participants who did not experience COVID-19-

307

associated symptoms. In the former group, SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells displayed almost

308

exclusively an early differentiated memory phenotype; while in the latter group, SARS-CoV-2-

309

responsive CD4 T cells exhibited a late differentiated memory phenotype and were enriched in

310

GrB. Differences in the attributes of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells distinguishing recent SARS-

311

CoV-2 infection from pre-existing immunity have been recently reported: strong ex vivo Elispot

312

responses and enhanced proliferation capacity were frequently observed in confirmed COVID-19

313

patients but rare in pre-pandemic or unexposed seronegative persons (Ogbe et al., 2020). This is

314

consistent with the phenotypic features we observed in our study. It remains to be determined

315

whether the presence of pre-existing cross-reactive memory T cells offers any protection against

316

SARS-CoV-2.

317

Although our results rely on a small number of participants and need to be confirmed in

318

larger cohorts, this study suggests that a whole blood assay could represent a valuable tool to

319

assess SARS-CoV-2-specific adaptive immunity. The whole blood assay described here is rapid

320

and scalable for varying complexities depending on laboratory resources and questions to be

321

addressed. It can be adapted to a simple 4-colour flow cytometry assay to monitor the frequency

322

of T cell responses in epidemiological studies or vaccine trials. Alternatively, it can also be used

323

to characterize in more depth the specific attributes of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells, as shown

324

here, to aid deciphering cellular features that may associate with immune correlates of protection.

325

Finally, as this standardizable assay requires a limited volume of blood, it can be easily used in

326

COVID-19 paediatric cases.
