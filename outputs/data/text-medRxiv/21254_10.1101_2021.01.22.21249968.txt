SUMMARY
Background: To externally validate a risk prediction algorithm (QCovid) to estimate mortality
outcomes from COVID-19 in adults in England.
Methods: Population-based cohort study using the ONS Public Health Linked Data Asset, a cohort
based on the 2011 Census linked to Hospital Episode Statistics, the General Practice Extraction Service
Data for pandemic planning and research, radiotherapy and systemic chemotherapy records. The
primary outcome was time to COVID-19 death, defined as confirmed or suspected COVID-19 death as
per death certification. Two time periods were used: (a) 24th January to 30th April 2020; and (b) 1st May
to 28th July 2020. We evaluated the performance of the QCovid algorithms using measures of
discrimination and calibration for each validation time period.
Findings: The study comprises 34,897,648 adults aged 19-100 years resident in England. There
were 26,985 COVID-19 deaths during the first time-period and 13,177 during the second.

The

algorithms had good calibration in the validation cohort in both time periods with close correspondence
of observed and predicted risks. They explained 77.1% (95% CI: 76.9% to 77.4%) of the variation in
time to death in men in the first time-period (R2); the D statistic was 3.76 (95% CI: 3.73 to 3.79);
Harrell’s C was 0.935 (0.933 to 0.937). Similar results were obtained for women, and in the second
time-period. In the top 5% of patients with the highest predicted risks of death, the sensitivity for
identifying deaths in the first time period was 65.9% for men and 71.7% for women. People in the top
20% of predicted risks of death accounted for 90.8% of all COVID-19 deaths for men and 93.0% for
women.
Interpretation: The QCovid population-based risk algorithm performed well, showing very high levels
of discrimination for COVID-19 deaths in men and women for both time periods. It has the potential to
be dynamically updated as the pandemic evolves and therefore, has potential use in guiding national
policy.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT
Evidence before this study
Public policy measures and clinical risk assessment relevant to COVID-19 need to be aided by
rigorously developed and validated risk prediction models. A recent living systematic review of
published risk prediction models for COVID-19 found most models are subject to a high risk of bias
with optimistic reported performance, raising concern that these models may be unreliable when applied
in practice. A population-based risk prediction model, QCovid risk prediction algorithm, has recently
been developed to identify adults at high risk of serious COVID-19 outcomes, which overcome many
of the limitations of previous tools.
Added value of this study
Commissioned by the Chief Medical Officer for England, we validated the novel clinical risk
prediction model (QCovid) to identify risks of short-term severe outcomes due to COVID-19. We
used national linked datasets from general practice, death registry and hospital episode data for a
population-representative sample of over 34 million adults. The risk models have excellent
discrimination in men and women (Harrell’s C statistic>0.9) and are well calibrated. QCovid represents
a new, evidence-based opportunity for population risk-stratification.

Implications of all the available evidence
QCovid has the potential to support public health policy, from enabling shared decision making
between clinicians and patients in relation to health and work risks, to targeted recruitment for clinical
trials, and prioritisation of vaccination, for example.

INTRODUCTION
The first cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were reported in the United Kingdom (UK) on the
24th

January 2020, with the first COVID-19 death on the 28th February 2020. As of 19 January 2021,

there have been over 90,000 deaths from COVID-19 in the UK, and over 2 million deaths globally1.
Emerging evidence throughout the course of the pandemic, initially from case series, and then
cohorts of individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, has demonstrated associations of age,
sex, certain co-morbidities, ethnicity and obesity with adverse COVID-19 outcomes such as
hospitalisation and death2-9. There is now a growing knowledge base regarding risk factors for severe
COVID-19. As many countries are re-introducing ‘lockdown’ measures and vaccination programmes
have started being rolled out, there is an opportunity to develop more nuanced guidance10 based on
predictive algorithms to inform risk management decisions. Better knowledge of individuals’ risks
could also help guide decisions on managing occupational risk and in targeting of vaccines to those
most at risk. Whilst several risk prediction models have been developed, a recent systematic review
found that they all have high risk of bias and that their reported performance is optimistic11.
The use of primary care datasets such as QResearch with linkage to registries such as death
records and hospital admissions data represents an innovative approach to clinical risk prediction
modelling for COVID-19 which has successfully been developed, validated, and implemented in the
NHS over the last 10 years12-14. It provides accurately coded, individual-level data for very large
numbers of people representative of the national population. This approach was used to develop the
QCovid prediction models15 drawing on the rich phenotyping of individuals with demographic, medical
and pharmacological predictors to allow robust statistical modelling and evaluation. Such linked
datasets have a track record for the development, and evaluation of established clinical risk models
including for cardiovascular disease12, diabetes14 and mortality13. Whilst QCovid predicts both COVID19 hospital related admission and COVID-19 death, the aim of this analysis is to validate the mortality
outcome which estimate the risks of becoming infected and subsequent death due to COVID-19 in an
extremely large national cohort. A companion study currently underway will externally validate these,
using datasets from Wales using

16SAIL17

and Scotland using EAVE-II18 and will be reported

separately.

METHODS
The Chief Medical Officer for England asked the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats
Advisory Group (NERVTAG), to develop and validate a clinical risk prediction model for COVID-19
in line with the emerging evidence. The resulting QCovid model was developed and validated using
the QResearch database and reported in accordance with TRIPOD19 and RECORD20 guidelines and
with input from a patient advisory group. The original protocol is published 21 along with the results of

the paper reporting the original derivation and validation of the model15. This paper reports the
validation of the model on an independent data source.

Study design and data sources
We undertook a validation cohort study of individuals aged 19-100 years using the Office for
National Statistics (ONS) Public Health Linked Data Asset. This dataset is based on the 2011 Census
in England, linked at individual level using the NHS number to mortality records, Hospital Episode
Statistics and the General Practice Extraction Service (GPES) Data for pandemic planning and research.
To obtain NHS numbers, the 2011 Census was linked to the 2011-2013 NHS Patient Registers using
deterministic and probabilistic matching, with an overall linkage rate of 94.6%. We excluded patients
(approximately 13.1%) who did not have a valid NHS number. For the purpose of the validation of the
QCovid algorithm, we further linked radiotherapy and systemic chemotherapy records based on NHS
number. The ONS Public Health Linked Data Asset includes data on most patients used to develop the
QCovid algorithm, but also includes patients registered with practices using IT systems other than
EMIS, such as TPP (used by 35% of GP practices).
We identified a cohort of all individuals aged 19-100 years who were enumerated at the 2011
Census and registered alive and resident in England on 24th January 2020. Patients entered the cohort
on 24th January 2020 (date of first confirmed COVID-19 case in UK) and were followed up until they
had the outcome of interest or 28th July 2020, which is the date up to which linked data were available
at the time of the analysis. This also extends the period of observation beyond the original QCovid
study. We divided the study period into two time periods: 24th January 2020 to 30th April 2020 and 01
May 2020 to 28th July 2020.
Outcomes
The outcome was time to COVID-19 death (either in hospital or out of hospital), defined as
confirmed or suspected COVID-19 death as identified by two ICD10 codes (U07.1 or U07.2) recorded
on the death certification.
Predictor variables
We derived pre-existing conditions and demographic characteristics using the same definitions
as used to develop the QCovid algorithm. The primary care records used in the ONS Public Health
Linked Data Asset were based on an existing GPES dataset which included many but not all of the
relevant clinical codes used to develop the QCovid algorithm. Nonetheless, we derived most of the preexisting conditions, although we could not identify patients who had a solid organ or bone marrow
transplant in the past six months; those on kidney dialysis; those with sickle cell disease or severe
combined immune deficiency syndrome; Similarly, we could not distinguish between patients suffering
from type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Variables used to validate the QCovid algorithm are listed in Box 1.

Model validation
We fitted an imputation model to replace missing values for body mass index (BMI), using
predicted values from linear regression models stratified by sex. Predictors included all predictor
variables in the QCovid algorithm, interacted with age.
We applied the QCovid risk equations (version 1) to men and women in the validation
dataset and evaluated R2 values22, Brier scores and measures of discrimination and calibration23 24 with
corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) over the two time periods. R2 values refer to the
proportion of variation in survival time explained by the model. Brier scores measure predictive
accuracy where lower values indicate better accuracy25. The D statistic is a discrimination measure
which quantifies the separation in survival between patients with different levels of predicted risks and
the Harrell’s C-statistics is a discrimination metric which quantifies the extent to which people with
higher risk scores have earlier events. Model calibration was assessed in the two time periods by
comparing mean predicted risks with observed risks by twentieths of predicted risk. Observed risks
were derived in each of the 20 groups using non-parametric estimates of the cumulative incidences.
The performance metrics were calculated in the whole cohort and in the following pre-specified
subgroups: 5-year age-sex bands, nine ethnic groups, and within each quintile of the Townsend Index,
a measure of deprivation. We also estimated the performance metrics on a sample restricted to patients
registered with practices using the TPP system, and therefore not used at all to derive the algorithm.
Ethics
The ethics approval for the development and validation of QCovid was granted by the East

Midlands-Derby Research Ethics Committee [reference 18/EM/0400].
Role of the funding source
This study is funded by a grant from the National Institute for Health Research following a
commission by the Chief Medical Officer for England whose office contributed to the development of
the study question and facilitated access to relevant national datasets, contributed to interpretation of
data, drafting of the report.

RESULTS
Overall study population
Overall, 34,897,648 people in England aged 19-100 years met our inclusion criteria. Out of the
40,136,597 people aged 19-100 who were enumerated at the 2011 Census and were alive on 24th January
2020, 5,238,949 (13.1%) people were excluded because they did not have a valid NHS number or had
an NHS number that could not be linked to the GPES data. This could be because they migrated out of
England, and therefore were no longer registered with the NHS in England. Our data cover 80.0% of

the population in England aged 19 or over (See Supplementary Table 1). The coverage is lowest in
London (68.2%) and highest in Yorkshire & Humber (83.7%).

Baseline characteristics
Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of patients. Of these patients, 16,599,875 (47.57%)
were men and 6,052,563 (17.34%) were of ethnic minority background. The mean age was 51.1 years,
which is slightly higher than in the cohort used to derive the QCovid models (48.2 years). For most
pre-existing conditions, the estimated prevalence in the ONS Public Health Linked Data Asset is similar
to the prevalence in the QResearch derivation cohort. However, the ONS dataset had higher proportions
of people taking anti-leukotriene or long acting beta2-agonists, or being prescribed oral steroids in the
last six months because of data limitations.
26,985 (0.08%) patients had a COVID-19 related death during the first period: 24 January 2020
to 30 April 2020). 13,177 (0.04%) patients had a COVID-19 related death during the second period (1
May 2020 to 28 July 2020). Out of the 49,461 deaths that occurred in England over the period, 81.2%
of these are included in our data (See Supplementary Table 1). The coverage is lowest in London
(74.2%) and highest in the North West (84.6%). In both periods, COVID-19 deaths occurred across all
regions, with the greatest numbers in London in period 1, (5,403 - 20.02% of all deaths) and in the
North West in period 2 (2,411 - 18.30%). Of those who died in period 1, 15,334 (56.82%) were male;
4523 (16.76%) were from ethnic minority groups; 22,538 (83.52%) were aged 70 and over; 8,700
(32.24%) had diabetes; 8,293 (30.73%) had dementia; 6,990 (25.90%) were identified as living in a
care home. Those who had a COVID-19 related death in period 2 had a similar profile to those in period
1 but were on average older (88.4% aged 70 and over) and more likely to live in a care home (31.4%).

Discrimination
Table 2 shows the performance of the risk equations in the validation cohort for women and
men in the two time periods. Overall, the values for the R2, D and C statistics were high and similar in
women and men in both periods. In the first period for women, the equation explained 76.3% of the
variation in time to COVID-19 death; Harrell’s C statistic was 0.945 and the D statistic 3.67. The
corresponding values in men were 77.1%, 0.935 and 3.76 respectively. All these discrimination
metrics are higher than in the original QResearch cohort used to validate the algorithm. The results were
similar for the second validation period. In period 2 for women, the R2 was 75.4%, Harrell’s C statistic

0.956, the D statistic 3.58. The corresponding values for men were 77.4%, 0.944 and 3.78
respectively.

Similar results were obtained when restricting the sample to 14,104,452 patients

registered with practices using the TPP system (Supplementary Table 2).

Figure 1 displays Harrell’s C statistic by age-band for men and women in period 1 (Panel A)
and period 2 (Panel B). The Harrell’s C statistics are over 0.7 for all age bands indicating that even
within each age band the model discriminates well. The C statistics are lower for patients aged 90 or
over than for younger patients. The C statistics, R2, and D by age-band, deprivation quintile and ethnic
group in men and women for both periods are reported in Supplementary Tables 3, 4 and 5. Performance
was generally similar to the overall results except for age where the performance was lower within
individual age-bands.
Calibration
Figure 2 displays the calibration plots for the COVID-19 mortality equation for men and women
and in both periods. Overall, both sets of equations were well calibrated, as the predicted and observed
risks were similar. However, as in the original QResearch validation cohort, the model underestimates
the risk of COVID-19 death for those in the top 5% of the predicted risk score.
Risk stratification
Figure 3 shows the sensitivity values for the mortality equation in period 1 (24 January 2020 –
30 April 2020) and period 2 (1 May 2020 – 28 July 2020) evaluated at different thresholds based on the
centiles of the predicted absolute risk in the validation cohort. Full results are reported in Supplementary
Table 6. The sensitivity was higher in women than in men, and in period 2 than period 1. In period 1,
65.94% of deaths in men occurred in those in the top 5% for predicted absolute risk of death from
Covid-19 (90 day predicted absolute risks above 0.289%) and 71.67% of deaths in women occurred in
the top 5% (predicted absolute risks above 0.188%). In period 2, 71.10% of deaths occurred in men in
the top 5% for predicted absolute risk of death from Covid-19 (predicted absolute risks above 0.278%)
and 77.16% of deaths occurred in women in the top 5% (predicted absolute risks above 0.181%).
Supplementary Figure 1 shows the sensitivity for the two time periods based on relative risks (defined
as the ratio of the individual’s predicted absolute risk to the predicted absolute risk for a person of the
same age and sex with a white ethnicity, body mass index of 25, and mean deprivation score with no
other risk factors). In period 1, 40.56% of deaths occurred in men in the top 5% for predicted relative
risk of death from Covid-19, and 42.63% for women. In period 2, 42.62% of deaths occurred in men in
the top 5% for predicted relative risk of death from Covid-19, and 43.57% for women.

DISCUSSION
We have validated the QCovid clinical risk prediction model for mortality due to COVID-19
using a national external linked dataset. We have used national linked datasets from the 2011 Census,
general practice, death registry data for a population-representative sample of nearly 35 million adults.
The risk models have excellent discrimination (Harrell’s C statistics>0.9), are well calibrated and have
a high sensitivity.

Our study had a number of important strengths. First, we used a unique linked dataset based on
the 2011 Census for nearly 35 million people living in England. Second, we used a wide range of
metrics, over two time periods to validate the QCovid predictive model, extending the period of
observation beyond the original study. All the metrics in the two time periods for both men and women
indicate that the algorithm performs well, and the metrics are comparable with the original validation
of QCovid in the QResearch database15. Finally, we showed that the model’s performance was similar
when restricting the sample to patients that were registered with practices using a different clinical
computer system provider (TPP), and therefore not used to derive the QCovid model.
This study also has several limitations. First, because of data limitations, we could not derive
all predictors in the same way as in the derivation cohort. Despite these inconsistencies, the model had
excellent discrimination and calibration. Second, we only focused on COVID-19 related deaths, but not
hospital admissions, because of the lack of data. Finally, because the Public Health Data Asset is based
on the 2011 Census, our sample was restricted to patients who were enumerated in 2011, that is about
94% of the population living in England in 2011. Recent migrants were excluded from this study, but
they tend to be younger than the native population and therefore at lower risk of COVID-19 death.
QCovid represents a new approach for population risk-stratification for adverse outcomes from
COVID-19, and our validation indicates that the risk algorithm performs well on external data not used
for its derivation. Whilst it has been specifically designed to inform UK health policy and interventions
to manage COVID-19 related risks, it also has international potential, subject to local validation. It
could also be deployed in a number of health and care applications, either during the current phase of
the pandemic, or in subsequent ‘waves’ of infection. These could include supporting
targeted recruitment for clinical trials, vaccine prioritisation, and discussions between patients and
clinicians in relation to work and health risks, for example through weight reduction since obesity is the
single most important modifiable risk factor for serious COVID-19 complications8.
In conclusion, this study presents a robust validation of a new prediction model that could be
used to support population risk stratification in relation to public health interventions, for example
vaccine utilisation. We anticipate that the algorithms will be updated regularly as understanding of
COVID-19 increases, as more data become available, as new variants emerge, effective treatments for
COVID become available, the vaccination program rolls-out, immunity levels change or as behaviour
in the population changes and hence we anticipate that this validation will need to be repeated on a
regular basis. It is important for patients/carers, and clinicians that there is a common appropriately
developed evidence-based model that is consistently implemented and is supported by the academic,
clinical and patient communities. This will then help ensure consistent policy and clear national
communication between policy makers, professionals, employers and the public.

Risk threshold is the centile value giving the cut-off of predicted risk over 97 days for defining each group
Sensitivity is percentage of total deaths over 97 days that occurred within the group of patients above the predicted risk
threshold

Supplementary Figure 1

Centiles based on predicted relative risks compared with someone of the same age/sex with no risk
factors. Sensitivity is percentage of total deaths in the period that occurred within the group of patients
above the predicted risk threshold.
