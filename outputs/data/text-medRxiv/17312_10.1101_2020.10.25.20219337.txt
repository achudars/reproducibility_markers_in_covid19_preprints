Abstract:
Background: The role of convalescent plasma (COPLA) for the treatment of severely ill
Corona Virus Disease-2019 is under investigation. We compared the efficacy and safety of
convalescent plasma with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) in severe COVID-19 patients.
Methods and findings: This was an open-label, single-centre phase II RCT on 29 patients
with severe COVID-19 from India. One group received COPLA with standard medical care
(SMC) (n=14), and another group received FFP with SMC (n=15). A total of 29 patients were
randomized in the two treatment groups. Eleven out of 14 (78.5%) patients remained free of
ventilation at day seven in the intervention arm while the proportion was 14 out of 15 (93.3
%) in the control arm (p= 0.258). The median reductions in RR per min at 48-hours in
COPLA-group and FFP group were -6.5 and -3 respectively [p=0.004] and at day seven were
-14.5 and -10 respectively (p=0.008). The median improvements in percentage O2 saturation
at 48-hours were 6.5 and 2 respectively [p=0.001] and at day seven were 10 and 7.5
respectively (p=0.026). In the COPLA-group, the median improvement in PaO2/FiO2 was
significantly superior to FFP at 48-hours [41.94 and 231.15, p=0.009], and also at day-7 [5.55
and 77.01 p<0.001]. We did not find significant differences in hospitalization duration
between the groups (0.08).
Conclusion: COPLA therapy resulted in rapid improvement in respiratory parameters and
shortened time to clinical recovery, although no significant reduction in mortality was
observed in this pilot trial. We need larger trials to draw conclusive evidence on the use of
Convalescent plasma in COVID-19. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrial.gov (identifier:
NCT04346446).

Introduction:
The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which had originated in Wuhan, China, has become
a pandemic involving more than 35 million population across the world, with almost 1
million deaths and still counting.1 The case-fatality rate of COVID-19 (Corona Virus disease2019) has ranged from 1.2-13%.1,2 The current evidence-based strategy relies on providing
supportive care in mild to moderate cases and providing mechanical ventilation and
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in severe cases. There is no targeted drug therapy
available at present. Some studies have indicated benefits with intravenous remidisvir and a
combination of lopinavir and ritonavir in reducing the severity and duration of illness, but not
mortality.3-5 Till now use of the only dexamethasone has resulted in reduced 28-day mortality
among severe and critical COVID-19 patients.6 Apart from antiviral drugs, virus-specific
neutralizing antibodies, which could accelerate virus clearance and prevent entry into target
cells, could serve as a mechanism for the restriction and clearance of the viruses by the host.
The plasma of convalescent patients who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection may
contain such neutralizing antibodies which may accelerate virus clearance in an infected
recipient and be used in the treatment of patients with COVID-19.7 The experience of using
convalescent plasma is derived from its utility in improving the survival rate of patients with
SARS infection wherein the patients who had no response to intravenous corticosteroids
showed improvement. Providing passive antibody therapy through convalescent plasma in
COVID-19 infection could be one of the approaches towards disease mitigation in the
absence of definitive treatment.5-9 This approach can be effective in patients before they
develop a humoral response to COVID-19.
Methodology:
Trial design and study setting: It was an open-labeled, phase II; pilot randomized controlled
trial conducted to assess efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma at the Institute of Liver

and Biliary Sciences (ILBS) and in collaboration with the Department of Internal Medicine,
Lok Nayak Hospital, New Delhi, a designated COVID-19 treatment centre. The first Donor
was recruited on 20 April 2020 while, the first patient was recruited on 21 April 2020, and
final follow up was completed on 30 May 2020. No scientific sample size calculation was
done as it was a pilot trial only. A total of 29 patients were included in the study. The trial
was approved by the Institutional Ethical Committees and was registered with
ClinicalTrial.gov (identifier: NCT04346446). The randomization was done by using block
randomization method with varying block sizes by an independent statistician. The allocation
concealment was done by using Sequentially Numbered Opaque Sealed Envelopes (SNOSE)
method.
Patients were enrolled for convalescent plasma transfusion along with the standard treatment
protocol in one arm and fresh frozen plasma [FFP] along with the standard treatment protocol
in another arm by random allocation. FFP transfused in the study was collected before the
emergence of the virus in our country to avoid any chance of providing COVID-19
convalescent plasma in the SMT group. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of
patients remaining free of mechanical ventilation in both groups on day seven. The secondary
outcome measures included mortality at day seven and day 28, improvement in PaO2/FiO2,
and the SOFA scores reduction at 48 hours and day 7, duration of hospital stay, duration of
Intensive Care Unit stay, requirements of vasopressors and days free of dialysis up to 28 days
from randomization. In addition to above, clinical assessment of patients was done by
assessing reduction in respiratory rate, and improvement in oxygen saturation at 48 hours and
seven days and laboratory effects of plasma therapy by improvement in lymphocyte count Ct
value at seven days and any adverse transfusion events with plasma transfusion.
We collected 500ml Convalescent plasma (COPLA) from COVID-19 recovered patients after
14 days of complete resolution of symptoms by Plasmapheresis (MCS+, Hemonetics USA)

after due consent. Two consecutive test negative results of Real-time reverse transcriptase
Polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were done 24 hours apart from combined oral and
nasopharyngeal swab for SARS CoV-2 for donation consideration. Final eligibility was
ascertained thorough medical history, physical examination and laboratory tests, as per the
Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 and further amended on 11.03.2020.10
Laboratory testing included serum protein and CBC; transfusion-transmitted infections
(hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, HIV, malaria, and syphilis), blood grouping and antibody
screening. The collected convalescent plasma was separated into two equal aliquots for
divided dosing, labelled as per regulatory requirements and stored at -80°C in a separately
designated deep freezer. It was issued to the interventional treatment arm patients under
study. FFP, a licensed product collected from whole blood donation from healthy blood
donors, was transfused to the control treatment arm.
IgG antibody against SARS CoV-2 assay: We tested each convalescent plasma unit for the
presence of IgG antibodies and neutralizing antibodies to SARS CoV-2. The titres of spike
protein S1 RBD IgG antibody was done by ELISA (SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1-RBD IgG
Detection Kit, Genscript, USA) representing spike protein antibody, directed against the
SARS-CoV-2 RBD (receptor binding domain) proteins. The titre was determined by ELISA
using positive, negative controls and sample dilutions (1:80, 1:160, 1:320, 1:640 and 1:1000.
All samples were run in duplicate. The ELISA titres were determined by endpoint dilution.
Also, the titres in 14 COPLA recipients and 15 FFP recipients were determined after plasma
therapy.
Neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV2 assay: The determination of serum
neutralization antibodies in donors was done by SARS-CoV-2 Surrogate Virus Neutralization
Test (sVNT) Kit (Genscript, USA). The test was used to detect circulating neutralizing
antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 that block the interaction between the receptor-binding

domains of the viral spike glycoprotein (RBD) with the ACE2 cell surface receptor. The S1
RBD IgG titre of 1:80 or above was preferred. The absorbance of the sample was inversely
dependent on the titre of the anti-SARS-CoV2 neutralizing antibodies.
RT PCR for SARS CoV2:
Sample Collection: Both nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were taken and
transported in a 3 ml viral transport media, maintaining a proper cold chain to the Virology
laboratory. A volume of 200 microlitres (µl) of the sample was further processed for viral
nucleic acid extraction by Qiasymphony DSP Virus/ Pathogen mini kit (Qiagen GmbH,
Germany) as per the manufacturer's protocol.
Performance of RT-PCR: The extracted elutes of RNA was subjected to RT-PCR for the
qualitative detection of both E as well as ORF 1ab (RdRP) genes of SARS-CoV-2 virus using
a commercial RT PCR kit (nCoV RT–PCR, SD Biosensor, Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea)
as per the kit literature. The sample was considered positive when fluorescence was seen in
both the target genes E as well as RdRP up to a cycle threshold (Ct) value 36. Ct value for
each gene was noted separately and keeping in mind that there exists an inverse relationship
between Ct value and the amount of viral nucleic acid in the specimen, Ct value was utilized
as a marker to monitor the clinical progress of the patients.
Patient selection: A written informed consent was taken from all the patient at the time of
enrolment in the study. The inclusion criteria of the trial were, a SARS-CoV-2 infection
(positive by real-time PCR assay) patient, with severe COVID-19 [respiratory rate (RR)

≥30/min, oxygen saturation level less than 93% in resting state, the partial pressure of oxygen
(PaO2)/oxygen concentration (FiO2) ≤300 mmHg, lung infiltrates >50% within 24 to 48
hours]. The exclusion criteria were; failure to obtain informed consent, patients less than 18
years or more than 65 years of age, those with co-morbid conditions (cardiopulmonary
disease-structural or valvular heart disease, coronary artery disease, COPD, chronic liver

disease, chronic kidney disease), patients presenting with multi-organ failure or on
mechanical ventilation, pregnant females, individuals with HIV, viral hepatitis, cancer,
morbid obesity with a BMI>35 kg/m2, extremely moribund patients with an expected life
expectancy of <24 hours, hemodynamic instability requiring vasopressors, previously known
history of allergy to plasma, or a PaO2/FiO2 ratio less than 150. The patients selected for
inclusion were randomized to receive either transfusion of COPLA or FFP along with the
standard treatment protocol within three days of onset of symptoms of severe COVID-19.
Clinical and Laboratory Monitoring: Demographic details, date of hospital admission,
symptoms present at the time of testing, the severity of illness, ongoing treatment protocols,
mechanical ventilator support were noted for all patients. Clinical data, including body
temperature, PaO2/FiO2, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Scores, were
collected and analysed. Samples from all potential plasma recipients for baseline and followup laboratory monitoring like CBC, serum antibody titres and cytokine levels were obtained.
Radiological data of chest x-ray, chest CT were collected, wherever available. Patients were
followed-up for any complications like pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS), and the development of multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).
Treatment protocol and patient monitoring:
Standard of Care: All the patients in the study were initiated on supplemental oxygen at
five litter/min with target SpO2 being ≥94%. If saturation remained below 94%, either of
high flow Oxygen or NIV (via BiPAP) was given. Medically, all patients received a course of
Hydroxychloroquine 400 mg BD on Day1, followed by 200 mg BD for five days along with
Oral Azithromycin 500 mg OD for five days. Standard medications for the control of diabetes
and hypertension were given when required.
Management of ARDS: In cases where patients had developed ARDS, were initiated on
high flow oxygen (5 - 15 litre/min) and responses were assessed regularly by using a pulse-

oximeter and ABG analysis. Still, if the patient remained in hypoxemia, we considered Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) in the form of BiPAP. Despite all this, if no clinical response was
observed, elective intubation was done, and patients were placed on mechanical ventilation.
Transfusion protocol: We transfused ABO blood group compatible 500 ml plasma (either
convalescent or FFP) in two divided doses on consecutive days to avoid transfusion-related
volume overload. All the patients were regularly monitored for vital signs before, during, and
after transfusion to detect any transfusion related adverse events.

Monitoring of patients: Patients were admitted to the ICU based on the severity of the
illness. Daily monitoring and clinical assessment were done by taking vitals (Blood Pressure,
Heart Rate, Temperature, Respiratory Rate) after following all IPC protocol. Due to the
nature of the COVID-19, monitoring via ABG (Arterial Blood Gases) and pulse-oximetry
were done.

After plasma (COPLA or FFP) transfusion, samples for laboratory monitoring on days
0, 3, 7, 14, and day 28 (wherever possible) were collected. Complete Blood Count for
analysis of haemoglobin (Hb), Hematocrit (Hct), total leukocyte counts (TLC), and
Neutrophils/lymphocytes (N/L) ratio was performed by using electrical impedance based on
multi parts cell counter (LH750, Beckman Coulter, Florida, USA). Plasma levels of IL-1β,
IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-10 were measured using multiplex procataplex (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Bender MedSystems GmbH, Campus Vienna Biocenter 2, Vienna Austria) using
cytokine bead assay following the Complete details provided by manufacturer's protocol. The
Luminex assay was run in xponent3.1TM Rev. 2 (Luminex Corporation, 12212 Technology
Boulevard, Austin, Texas, USA) and levels were determined.

Statistical analysis: Continuous variables were expressed as mean (SD) or median (range)
and compared by Student's t-test or Mann- Whitney U test as appropriate. The categorical

data were analyzed using Chi-Square or Fisher's exact test. To compare the pre and post
outcome values, a paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used. To find out the
predictor in survival analysis Cox-proportional hazard regression analysis was applied. The
actuarial probability of survival was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier graph and compared by
the log-rank test. The p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical
tests were performed using SPSS for Windows version 22 (SPSS IBM Corp. Ltd. Armonk,
NY)
Results:
A total of 292 patients with COVID-19 were assessed for inclusion in the study, of which 241
were excluded as they had mild to moderate disease and only 51 patients with severe
COVID-19 were found eligible. Twenty patients were further excluded due to
signs/symptoms of severe COVID-19 for more than three days before randomization (n=13),
lack of consent (n=7), or other exclusion criteria. Thirty-one patients underwent
randomization out of which 15 were assigned to receive convalescent plasma with standard
care and 16 to FFP with standard care. However, in both groups, one patient became RT-PCR
negative for SARS-CoV-2 on the day of plasma transfusion. Thus, a total of 14 patients
received COPLA and 15 received FFP (Fig. 1).
Baseline patient profile: The mean age, gender, and body mass index (BMI) were
comparable between the groups (Table 1). The patients in both COPLA and FFP groups had
severe disease with the high respiratory rate (35.36 ± 2.65 and 34.47 ± 2.47 respectively), and
low saturation (% O2 saturation of 85 ± 4.29 and 85.07 ± 3.92 respectively). Baseline
PaO2/FiO2 ratios were low (164.92 ± 15.85 and 161.06 ± 11.77 respectively), and X-ray
changes were present in 12 (85.7%) and 13 (86.67%) patients respectively in COPLA and
FFP groups. The baseline SOFA scores were also comparable.

Laboratory parameters
Baseline laboratory parameters: The baseline N/L ratio in COPLA and FFP groups [7.71 ±
1.59 and 7.20 ± 2.11] and platelet counts [2.05 ± 1.42 and 1.58 ± 0.95] were comparable. In
the COPLA group, the mean baseline Ct value was 30.83 ± 4.07 while in the FFP group, it
was 32.93 ± 2.46 [p = 0.12] (Table 1).
Antibody titres: The S1 RBD IgG, antibody titres of the COPLA donors, ranged from 10 to
640 (Table 2). 64.28% (9/14) of donors had IgG titre of 640, 28.57% (4/14) had a titre of 1:80
and 7.14 % (1/14) had a titre of 1:10. The neutralizing antibody titres of >80 were observed
in 13 donors, and one donor had titre <10 (Table 2). The S1 RBD IgG antibody titres of the
14 recipients ranged between 10 and 640 a day after the convalescent plasma transfusion and
0 to 640 after FFP transfusion. There was a significant time-dependent increase in the IgG
antibody titres in 85.71% (12 out of 14) of the convalescent plasma recipients as compared to
20% (3 out of 15) FFP recipients (p= 0.001) (Table 4). On intragroup analysis, we found that
in COPLA group S1 RBD IgG antibody titres were changed from median titres of 80 to 640
(400% change, p= 0.002) while no difference in median titre of 80 was there in FFP group
(p= 0.083).

Ct Value: The change in the Ct value represents a reduction in the viral load. It was
measured with respect to the rise in the antibody titres in the recipients, and it was observed
that the median increment in the Ct values at day seven was 7.7 (3.4, 9.2)and 5.2 (3.3, 6.3) in
the COPLA group and FFP group respectively. There was a higher reduction in the viral load
in the COPLA group, but possibly due to the small sample size, the difference was not
significant (p=0.11) (figure 2, table 4).
Cytokine levels: The baseline cytokine levels were comparable in both the study arms. On
convalescent plasma transfusion, median post-transfusion IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α levels were
reduced while IL-1β level was increased at day 7. In the FFP group, the median posttransfusion levels of IL-1β and TNF-α were reduced while IL-6 and IL-10 showed an
increase. These differences did not attain statistical significance post-transfusion, as shown in
table 3.

Clinical evaluation: The primary outcome of clinical efficacy was objectively analyzed in
both the treatment groups. Three (21.4%) patients in the COPLA group and 1 (6.7%) in the
FFP group needed mechanical ventilation within seven days of transfusion; the proportion of
patients free of ventilation at day seven were 11 out of 14 in the COPLA arm and 14 out of
15 in the control arm, this difference was not statistically significant (p= 0.258) [Table 4].

The secondary outcome measures showed significant benefits of convalescent plasma. In the
COPLA group compared to the FFP group, the median reductions in respiratory rate per min
at 48 hours were -6.5 (-10.3, -5) and -3 (-5,-1) respectively [p=0.004] and at day 7 were -14.5
(-18.75, -13) and -10 (-14, -9) respectively [p=0.008]. In the COPLA group, the median
improvement in % O2 saturation at 48 hours and day 7 was 6.5 (5, 7.25) and 10 (8.2, 11)
respectively. In the FFP group, the median improvement in % O2 saturation at 48 hours and
day 7 was 2 (1, 2) and 7.5 (4.75, 9.25) respectively (p = < 0.001, and p = 0.02). In the
COPLA group, the median reduction in SOFA score at 48 hours and day 7 was -2 (-2.25,-1)
and -5 (-6.5,-4.0) respectively while it was -1 (-1, 0.0) and -3 (-5.25, -2.75) respectively in the
FFP arm (p=0.016, and p=0.047). In the COPLA arm, median improvement in PaO2/FiO2 at
48 hour and at 7 days was 41.94 (1.25, 55.58) and 231.15 (183.37, 245.2) respectively
compared to 5.55 (-9.32, 11.11) and 77.01 (56.93, 96.20) respectively in the FFP arm
(p=0.009, and p = < 0.001). We found an early and statistically significant reduction in
respiratory rate/min, improvement in O2 saturations, reductions in SOFA scores and
PaO2/FiO2 at 48 hours and seven days in the COPLA group as compared to the FFP group.
The lymphocyte count was higher y t in the COPLA group on day 7. Requirements of
vasopressors were required overall in 4 patients (3 in the COPLA group and 1 in the FFP
group) until 28 days, but it not significant statistically (p=0.33) [Table 4].

In COPLA group median ICU stay, and mean hospital stay was 5 (4, 5.7) and 12.1 ± 4.27

These differences were not significant statistically (p= 0.72, and p= 0.08).
Mortality: A total of 4(13.79%) out of 29 patients, succumbed to COVID-19 during the
study period of 28 days out of which three were in COPLA group, and one was in FFP group.
One patient in the COPLA group had a severe acute respiratory illness with oliguria, uremic
encephalopathy, and AKI at presentation. Ideally, due to multi-organ failure, he should not
have been included, but since some of the laboratory reports came after randomization and

transfusion. This patient was put on haemodialysis. He became virus-negative by RT–PCR 6
days after the plasma therapy but succumbed on day 15 due to progressive multi-organ
failure. Two other patients who died in the COPLA group showed a continuous fall in O2
saturation from the time of randomization to transfusion, and thereafter, thus, further
transfusion was withheld, and the patients succumbed within 24 hours. One patient in the FFP
group, one 60 years male, showing SARI was admitted with poor O2 saturation and put on
ventilator support. He received FFP on day three and day four but died due to cardiac arrest
on day 5. Both the treatment arms were compared for survival analysis using Coxproportional hazard regression. In COPLA group three events of mortality were observed
while in the FFP group, one event was observed, the difference was statistically not
significant (HR, 4.23 [95% CI, 0.43-41.6]; P = 0.22).
Safety profile: One patient in each of the arms, showed signs of mild urticaria during plasma
transfusion, which was comfortably managed by treating physician. No significant untoward
side effects of convalescent plasma or FFP transfusion were observed in the study (p= 1), as
shown in Table 4.
Discussion:
We observed the safety of both types of plasma (convalescent plasma and FFP) and found
that convalescent plasma is as safe as FFP. Hence, convalescent plasma can be transfused to
COVID-19 patients without any added potential risk similar to the findings reported by
Joyner et al. on 5000 patients who were transfused COPLA and found it to be a safe
treatment modality in COVID-19 patients.11 The preliminary results in the present pilot trial
are encouraging and seem promising as clinical recovery by an early and significant
improvement in O2 saturation; reduction in respiratory rate and reduction in SOFA scoring
was observed. We found shorter ICU, and hospital stays using convalescent plasma, but these
findings were not significant. Still, there is no established therapy at present for severe

COVID-19. There are equivocal reports of plasma therapy compared to no therapy for
patients with severe Covid-19. The results of our trial show that convalescent plasma
significantly reduced the respiratory rate, improved O2 saturation, and improved the
PaO2/FiO2 ratio compared with fresh frozen plasma. There was no difference; however, in
the number of patients requiring ventilation or on mortality.
In this novel study, the purpose of using FFP in the control arm was to supplement and
balance the beneficial effects of plasma, whether FFP or COPLA, on coagulation
abnormalities developing in severe COVID-19 patients and study the added benefits specific
to SARS-CoV-2 antibodies present in COPLA.
Use of Convalescent plasma therapy in severe COVID-19 infection could be one of the
approaches towards disease mitigation in the absence of definitive treatment. There were
clear advantages of giving COPLA over FFP as evident from the results of our study. The
convalescent plasma therapy improved respiratory clinical parameters, but did not impact the
need for ventilation and also it did not improve survival. Thus its role in severe patients who
require ventilator support and who show rapid deterioration is not clear. Similar findings
were observed in a recently conducted trial in the China by Ling et al. where they didn’t find
a statistically significant improvement in severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients in time
to clinical improvement within 28 days.12 Contrary to this, convalescent plasma therapy has
shown improved survival in anecdotal and small case series; in five critically ill patients by
Shen et al., in 10 critically ill patients by Duan et al. and in 4 critically ill patients by Zhang et
al. respectively.5,8,9
There was a significant time-dependent increase in the S1 RBD IgG antibody titres in patients
who received COPLA as compared to FFP this was similar to the study done by Shen C et al.
where they found an increase in S1 RBD IgG antibody titres after COPLA transfusion.5 In
this pilot trial, we found an early increase in the Ct values in the COPLA group,

demonstrating a speedy reduction in the viral load. We found an early reduction in viral load
in the convalescent plasma group as compared to the FFP group. RT-PCR results showed no
detectable SARS CoV-2 RNA target in the nasopharyngeal swab within 14 days in the
COPLA group as compared to the FFP group where it took more than 14 days to become
negative. It is a critical laboratory marker for assessing the effectiveness of therapy, which
corroborates with all the previous studies done on it.13, 14
Further, the appearance of the anti-inflammatory marker IL-10 and reduction in levels
of pro-inflammatory markers (IL-1, IL-6, and TNF- TNF-α), has been well correlated with
the disappearance of clinical symptoms.15 We found a decrease in IL-6 and TNF-α level posttransfusion, showing it can limit immune-mediated damage and associated complications and
early sign of recovery in COVID-19 patients in the convalescent plasma group.16 In the FFP
group, we found an isolated decrease in the TNF-α level on transfusion while an increase in
the IL-6 showing ongoing active corona infection with the beneficial effect of FFP on
endothelium lining and coagulation system, as shown in a study done by Straat et al.17
Our study had certain limitations. We had fewer numbers of participants in this pilot trial thus
we could not draw clear cut and robust conclusions. Secondly, one patient in the convalescent
plasma group was already in renal failure. Third, all the patients were given Oseltamivir antiviral and hydroxychloroquine despite the uncertainty of the efficacy as part of their standard
care. Lastly, the dynamic changes in cytokines level during treatment were not investigated
in an absolute controlled way. However, the preliminary results in the present pilot trial are
encouraging and seem promising as early clinical recovery and shorter ICU, and hospital stay
was observed in the convalescent plasma group. We need to conduct larger RCTs to draw
conclusive evidence before advocating this mode of therapy.
