Simulating Pandemic Disease Spread and the Impact of Interventions in Complex Societal
Networks

Abstract
Introduction Projecting disease spread is challenging because of the heterogeneous nature of human
interactions, including both natural societal interactions and how they change in response to pandemics.
Simulations can provide important guidance regarding the likely impact of interventions on an assumed
base case. Methods This paper uses assumptions based on the COVID-19 pandemic to construct a
Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered model representative of US society, focusing on the interrelationships
of groups with differing contact networks (essential/non-essential workers and urban/non-urban
populations). The model is used to explore the impact of interventions (reduced interactions, vaccinations
and selective isolation) on overall and group-specific disease spread. Results In the absence of herd
immunity, temporary interventions will only reduce the overall number of disease cases moderately and
spread them over a greater period of time unless they virtually eliminate disease and no new infections
occur from exogenous sources. Vaccinations can provide stronger benefit, but can be limited by efficacy
and utilization rates. Conclusions While a highly effective and broadly utilized vaccine might halt disease
spread, some combination of increased long-term surveillance and selective isolation of the most
vulnerable populations might be necessary to minimize morbidity and mortality if only moderately
effective vaccines are available.

Introduction
During 2020, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent for COVID-19,
spread from initial detection in Wuhan, China to virtually every region of the world 1. A variety
of efforts have been made to model disease trajectory in the United States 2, but the resulting
models are challenged by substantial uncertainties with regard to disease parameters, inconsistent
official policy and the unpredictability of human behavior. While these factors may make
absolute prediction of disease spread difficult, understanding parameters that influence disease
spread and the relative impact of interventions can provide important qualitative public health
learnings. The goal of this paper is to explore factors that influence or mitigate airborne disease
spread using a baseline model that generally reflects current assumptions about COVID-19.
Modeling the spread of any airborne disease typically relies heavily on R 0, the disease’s
basic reproductive number. R0 reflects the average number of new cases that arise from every
infected individual 3. If R0 is greater than 1, the disease will be spreading exponentially (more
newly infected individuals in each infected generation), while if R 0 is less than 1, the spread will
be slowing. If individuals who survive an infection are immune to reinfection or individuals can
be rendered immune through vaccination, the effective R 0 for the disease will fall over time 4,
providing a natural barrier to further spread of disease (herd immunity). Initial R 0 for COVID-19
was estimated to be about 2.5 5; other early estimates ranged from about 2 to more than 6, with
most falling between 2 and 4 6.
R0 may vary because of a number of factors, including mechanics of transmission, length
of infectivity, magnitude of infectivity relative to symptoms, heterogeneity in number of
contacts, likelihood that a contact leads to disease transmission, underlying nature of human

contacts and disease control mechanisms. Importantly, human society is not structured such that
individuals have equal chances of contacting any other individuals. Most contacts (particularly
close and prolonged contacts) are with close friends and family, leading to increased odds of
transmission within such close core groups 7. Highly infectious “super-spreaders” may also play
a significant role in disease transmission 8. Some individuals may be relatively isolated; if they
have few close contacts and those contacts either never become infected or fail to transmit
disease when infected, they may remain disease naïve. Herrmann et al. 9 have shown the impact
of modeling societies as networks rather than homogeneous groups with relatively random
contacts and Britton et al. 10 have shown that considering societal subgroups can influence
requirements for herd immunity.
Absent interventions, pandemics can be divided into three phases for modeling purposes:
A ramp-up phase where the initially infected individuals may be few and localized, an
exponential phase where the number of infected individuals is increasing rapidly and infection is
extensive, and a post-exponential phase where the number of cases is declining. If a disease
spreads poorly (low R0) or early infected individuals are isolated/fail to spread disease, disease
spread may never become extensive.
This paper will start by exploring how connectivity impacts the spread of disease through
a population, use this understanding to build a model that reasonably reflects the US population,
and then look at the impact of potential interventions in this model. While no claims are made
that the model accurately reflects COVID-19 spread, assumptions were chosen based on general
current knowledge of this disease. General learnings are important with regard to current public
policy choices on this disease, such as the controversy regarding whether a policy of accepting

disease spread among those less likely to have severe disease consequences in order to develop
some herd immunity and protect the most vulnerable is a good idea (Great Barrington
Declaration11) or not (John Snow Memorandum12, 13).

Methods
Modeling was conducted using Microsoft Excel Professional Plus 2016.
Simulations used Visual Basic. Unless otherwise specified, 100,000 simulations were
performed for each example using a sample population of 1000 individuals, of whom one
random individual was initially infected. In most scenarios, additional infections from exogenous
sources were permitted.
For the purposes of this simulation, a simple Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR)type model was used for viral transmission. Time was divided into periods intended to represent
the primary infectivity period of individuals. During each period, currently infected individuals
had disease-spreading contacts with a number of individuals pulled from a Poisson distribution
that varied based on the infected individual’s characteristics. If the other individuals were
susceptible, they would become infected and be part of the next cohort of infected individuals.
Disease-spreading contacts were most likely to be with close members of the infected
individual’s network, reflecting both the higher number and greater intensity of those
interactions. Individuals were assumed to be infectious for only one period. The primary
infectivity period might proxy a real-world period encompassing late asymptomatic and early

symptomatic phases (perhaps five to nine days for COVID-19 in the real world 14, 15), and
simulations were allowed to run for up to 146 periods (~2 + years).
Note that in a population with homogenous individuals and random association, the
population-level parameter R0 and the number of disease-spreading contacts by an individual are
the same, but for heterogeneous populations, R 0 will reflect a blend of the properties of
individuals. As the number of previously infected individuals in the population rises, diseasespreading encounters are increasingly likely to be with immune individuals, leading to a
reduction in individual-level disease spread paralleling the population-level shift from an initial
R0 to effective R0.
Parameters that varied by simulation included the average number of infectious events,
likelihood of contact between any two individuals, and likelihood of additional infections from
outside the system. Factors could also vary between differently situated individuals within a
scenario or over time (interventions). For example, one individual might be more isolated and
have a smaller contact network and fewer infectious encounters, or might self-isolate after a
pandemic starts.
For the examples using a representation of the US society, individuals were placed into a
hierarchy that comprised a “core” group representing their most frequent contacts (household), a
broader group of less frequent contacts that formed a subset of their class (e.g. urban essential
workers), their class overall, and overall society. Parameters were chosen such that all
individuals had similar likelihoods of transmitting disease to members of their closest “core”
group (household), but members of different classes had different likelihoods of interacting
outside of their core group (See Table 1). Urban individuals were assumed to have more contacts

overall and essential workers were assumed to have both more contacts and more contacts with
individuals outside of their close network. Assumptions were roughly adjusted to give an early
disease spread rate similar to what was observed for COVID-19 in the US.
Limited disease spread is defined as situations where disease does not spread broadly
through the population despite parameters that could support broad spread. Disease spread may
be limited due to chance (early infected persons do not spread disease broadly) or the nature of
the societal connections (individuals serve as bottlenecks). In simulations, cases where disease
spread is 10% or less of the initial population were characterized as limited (as opposed to
extensive) disease spread.
For the analysis of time to elimination of disease from a cohort through isolation alone, a
simple cohort model with a homogeneous population was used wherein each individual had an
identical probability of infecting one individual in the next period. The initial cohort had 250,000
infected individuals and results were the average of 1000 simulations. There were no infections
from exogenous sources and the population size was deemed sufficient large such that the
number of previously infected (and presumptively immune) individuals was not relevant.

Results
Designing an Appropriate Model to Represent US Society
In a simple homogeneous model where individuals have equal chances of spreading
disease to any other individuals, disease spread is based primarily on the average number of
contacts an individual has that transmit disease (“infectious contacts”), a proxy for the

population-level R0 (See Methods). If early cases have few infectious contacts, disease spread
may remain limited, but if disease spreads beyond a few individuals or new cases continue to
arise from exogenous sources, disease spread will generally be extensive given a sufficiently
high average number of infectious contacts (data not shown).
From a modeling perspective, situations where initial disease is not contained are the
relevant public health scenarios. The pace of disease spread and average number ultimately
infected increase with the average number of infectious contacts (See Figure 1). Over time, the
number of susceptible individuals in the population declines (assuming that previously infected
individuals are resistant to reinfection) and an increasing proportion of contacts that would
otherwise spread disease can no longer do so (matching the population-level decline in effective
R0). The length of time until peak increases with the log of the population size (data not shown).
There are multiple ways to model more heterogeneous individual contacts in real
societies. Most contacts are likely to be with a small group of close family and friends, with a
broader set of secondary contacts that varies by individual. One could model the core groups as
relatively isolated, with only a small number of individuals having significant contacts outside of
the inner group (See Figure 2A), core groups that have common external contacts (Figure 2B) or
core groups where individuals have diverse external contacts (Figure 2C). Each of these
structures has analogs in real societies: Elderly individuals with few contacts outside the house,
common secondary associations with social groups (e.g. churches) or those geographically
proximal, and differing places of employment or schools for different family members. Models
where specific individuals are key intermediaries (Figure 2A) lead to substantial bottlenecks that
limit spread of the disease when core connecting individuals either do not become infected or do

not happen to infect individuals in other groups (data not shown), while models with very broad
contact networks if not substantially constrained become similar to societies with homogeneous
contacts. This paper uses a hybrid three-level model of society, wherein individuals have most of
their contacts with a small group, a smaller number of contacts with a broader shared group, and
a still smaller number of contacts with any other members of society.
As the US society is extremely heterogeneous, it is challenging to construct a model that
represents all aspects of society while remaining manageable and providing clear learnings with
regard to how intercessions might impact it. However, a relatively simple model can prove
informative. Two factors were chosen as most important for modelling: Population density and
breadth of interactions. Generally, it appears that spread of disease is correlated with population
density (See Appendix 1). While urban individuals do not have dramatically larger core contact
groups based on average household sizes 16, 17, there are more opportunities to interact outside of
the core group (e.g. apartment common areas, street crowds). Breadth of interactions reflects
individual proclivities, but was significantly reduced in many individuals other than essential
workers after the start of the pandemic. Table 1 shows parameters that were chosen for the base
model before any interventions (See Methods for details), recognizing that some of these
parameters were relatively arbitrary and chosen to make the model resemble real-world
experience; a replication with a different set of parameters for sensitivity yielded virtually
identical qualitative results to those shown below (data not shown).
In the absence of any behavioral changes to limit the spread of disease, this set of
parameters leads to rapid spread of disease through the population, with urban classes typically
hit faster and harder because of their larger typical number of contacts per individual and broader

contact groupings (See Figure 3), despite random initiation of the disease that tends to be outside
of urban areas due to the overall population distribution. Because of greater relative isolation of
individuals, spread through non-urban areas also tends to be less complete, with 60% of the nonurban/non-essential population ultimately affected compared to at least 96% of the other three
classes. Note that in the US as a whole, overall population is approximately 2 18 times larger than
the simulated population (1000), leading to a substantial increase in the time spent in each stage
in a real population.
Interventions to Limit Disease Spread
Interventions can affect disease spread through a population in four ways. First, they can
temporarily reduce interactions to minimize current disease spread and the number of near-term
affected individuals (“flatten the curve”). Second, they can make more permanent changes in
interaction patterns that reduce overall speed of spread, such as tracking disease, reducing
contacts and decreasing incentives for working sick. Third, they can decrease the number of
people who are susceptible to disease, reducing both near-term and long-term infection (e.g. by
vaccination). Finally, they can try to impact which individuals are infected, such as by making
special provisions for those who are most likely to have serious disease consequences.
Figure 4 shows the impact of a temporary reduction in interactions. Interactions were
virtually eliminated for non-essential workers from period 6-12, and reduced for essential
workers. When restrictions were removed, the disease spread resumed because residual cases had
remained in the population, recapitulating the initial ramp-up to exponential phases of disease
spread, though cases were likely to be scattered and thus more challenging to control. More
stringent or longer controls had greater opportunity to eliminate all cases in the absence of new

infections from exogenous sources (Figure 5). After the interruption, the urban/essential group
had substantially reduced number of cases due to many having already been infected in the first
peak, helping to mitigate the overall spread across all groups by about 11%.
Permanent changes in interaction patterns are likely to be more modest in nature, such as
reductions in sick individuals outside of the house 18 and increases in working from home. These
could reduce disease transmission in general, lowering R 0, but likely not significantly enough to
have major impact on COVID-19 except in combination with other control methods (See Figure
1). Aggressive use of testing and isolation of sick individuals could be used to control subsequent
spread after a temporary reduction in cases down to a manageable level.
Vaccines are unlikely to be 100% effective. The FDA has proposed a 50% minimum
point estimate of effectiveness for approval 19, in line with the 40-60% effectiveness seen for
influenza vaccines 20. In addition, surveys suggest that 20-50% of individuals might refuse
vaccination 21, with as many as 67% likely to delay vaccination 22. Figure 6 shows the reduction
in benefit from vaccines that would result from less than complete coverage due to some
combination of unvaccinated or ineffectively vaccinated individuals (but ignoring the loss due to
delays in vaccination). Any reductions in susceptible individuals due to prior exposure would be
synergistic with the vaccine benefit.
When only vulnerable groups such as older and less healthy individuals are isolated,
infections will occur in other segments of the population during initial exponential disease spread
and later provide some herd immunity for the vulnerable population. Figure 7 shows the impact
of taking populations with initially similar transmission patterns (Figure 7A) and sequestering
25% of the population for various periods of time. The curve for the less vulnerable population

shifts because there are assumed to be fewer interactions overall rather than a replacement of
some interactions that would otherwise have occurred with the sequestered population. If the
population that is sequestered emerges before the disease has run its course, there will be a
resurgence of disease in both populations (Figure 7B), leading to a modest benefit of 19% and
3% reduction in infections in the vulnerable and less vulnerable groups respectively. However, if
the vulnerable population remains sequestered until the disease has run through most of the less
vulnerable segment of the population, the less vulnerable population will provide herd immunity
for the more vulnerable population and reduce spread in the two groups by 60% and 14% (Figure
7C).

Discussion
Simulation can provide a useful tool for understanding disease spread and the impact of
potential interventions, both for a population as a whole and for specific defined subgroups of
interest. In this paper, we built a simple model that provides a useful proxy for the spread of
disease through the US population. While the stages of the model are much shorter than they
would be in a larger population, interactions between individuals lead to spread of disease in
patterns that are generally similar to how disease behaves in the US population. Populations
where interaction networks are broader (urban populations and essential workers in this model)
see faster spread of disease and can exacerbate spread in other populations.
Interventions can provide temporary or more permanent declines in the infected
population. Ideally, early efforts can reduce the number of infected individuals and

identify/isolate remaining cases or those newly introduced from exogenous sources. Societies
where it is possible to maintain the extent and time of isolation until there are no more active
cases can eliminate disease (Figure 5), but this level of control is very challenging in the US;
proposals for virtually complete shut downs in the US, which could eliminate all endogenous
cases, are opposed by approximately 36% of the population 23. However, in the absence of
vaccines, disease is likely to reemerge and development of herd immunity through careful
balance is difficult 24.
Vaccination can reduce disease spread both by protecting specific individuals and by
reducing the number of interactions that spread disease (herd immunity). However, if vaccines
are not completely effective or widely used, they will not fully contain the disease. A vaccine
that is 50% effective would reduce effective R 0 from about 2.5 to 1.25 if used by essentially the
entire population; this would slow, but not halt the spread of the disease. However, many might
refuse to take a vaccine, and it is unclear that a vaccine–or previous infection—will provide
long-lasting protection. Estimates of 43% overall vaccine efficacy (combination of utilization
and efficacy) in a very heterogenous population 10 or 60% or higher efficacy in a general
population 25 have been suggested to provide substantial benefit in line with what would be
necessary to reduce effective R0 sufficiently to minimize disease spread, generally in line with
the above modeling.
Ultimately, it is likely that a variety of methods will be necessary to reduce the extent and
spread of COVID-19 and reach the best achievable outcomes. Short-term plans to control spread
need to serve feasible longer-term objectives; they will not lead to substantial reductions in the
overall number of disease cases by themselves unless they virtually eliminate all disease

reservoirs. If they can provide a bridge to highly effective vaccines, they can reduce overall
morbidity and mortality. If the first generation of vaccines are not sufficiently effective, it is
important to consider some combination of shorter-term extreme isolation, development of
vaccine and natural immunity in less vulnerable populations, and heightened disease
tracking/quarantine of local outbreaks.

Limitations
Simulations and modeling are highly dependent on the assumptions and approaches that
underlie them. Assumptions in this model were guided by preliminary real COVID-19 data for
both inputs and reasonableness testing on outputs, but this does not guarantee that the system
will behave similarly to the real world when variables are perturbed; relative effects (changes
from baseline) are likely to be more robust than absolute projections. Also, these parameters are
preliminary and in many cases have not been peer reviewed and thus results should be
interpreted cautiously. The model utilized a small population that may have exaggerated some
effects and certainly impacted stage timing relative to larger groups, and the nature of cohorts
(rounds of sick patients) may have impacted model behavior. Random infection from exogenous
sources does not reflect the varying likelihoods of international contacts by differently situated
individuals. There remains substantial uncertainty regarding key parameters for COVID-19,
including how easily it is spread between individuals and whether infected individuals become
(and remain) immune to reinfection over the long term. The modeling of the US population
utilized convenient important subpopulations, but does not reflect the real heterogeneity of the
US population, as one might more appropriately do with an agent-based model. Patients are not

Appendix
Hamidi et al. 26 and Wheaton and Thompson 27 explored whether density is an important
factor in the rate of spread of SARS-CoV-2 and came to opposite conclusions. Both used county
level data from early in the pandemic that may be influenced by the non-uniform distribution of
early cases and challenges created (as noted by Hamidi et al. 26) with urban sprawl and the
potential for spread to regions close to urban hotspots.
State level data can provide additional insight into this question. While not claiming to
resolve this issue, an analysis of the state-level correlation of population density and number of
virus-related deaths per million (See Figure A1) is supportive of the hypothesis that population
density is related to viral spread. Factors like typical travel patterns (within and between states),
healthcare resources, levels of comorbidities and interventions to control spread are important,
but beyond the scope of this paper. While not sufficient to conclude that density is the critical
factor, its use as a proxy for factors that increase the typical number of contacts for some classes
of individuals is plausible.

Figure Legends.
Figure 1. Differences in disease spread with average infectious contacts (AIC). Each curve
represents the results of 100,000 simulations of 1000 homogeneous individuals with the
specified number of average infectious contacts (the individual-level proxy for R 0). Only
simulations with extensive disease spread (>=10% of overall population) were included,
representing 57%, 79%, 90%, 94%, 97% and 98% of simulations respectively for AIC of 1.5-4.
Average number of individuals ultimately infected were 582, 796, 893, 940, 966 and 980
respectively.
Figure 2. Potential models for interactions between members of a core interaction group (e.g. a
family) and the broader community. A) Most individuals have few external contacts with one
individual serving as the primary link to the external community. B) Individuals have most of
their contacts within the core interaction group, and external interactions are similar among all
members of the group. C) Individuals have most of their contact within the core interaction
group, but external interactions differ by group member.
Figure 3. Spread of disease through different segments of the population. Simulations used the
parameters described in Table 1, with initiation of disease in a random individual for each of the
100,000 simulations of 1000 individuals.
Figure 4. Spread of disease through the population with reduced interactions from period 4 to
period 11 (80% reduction in essential classes and 99% reduction in other classes). Exogenous
sources of infection were eliminated after period 4.

Figure 5. Time to elimination of disease through social distancing alone. Based on a simple
cohort model (See Methods), 250,000 current cases of disease can be reduced to zero through
draconian reductions in interactions, but an exponentially increasing number of periods are
necessary if the decrease in contacts is not extreme.
Figure 6. Spread of disease through the population with vaccination broadly administrated during
period 4, showing the sum of new cases across all groups. Relative to no vaccination, the total
number of infected individuals declines subsequent to period 4 by 19% (essential workers only
vaccinated with 100% efficacy), 40% (50% effective vaccination), 58% (75% effective
vaccination), and 74% (100% effective vaccination).
Figure 7. Spread of disease through populations with identical characteristics, classifying 25% of
individuals as vulnerable to worse disease outcomes. A) Baseline model with simple interaction
pattern (most contacts with core group, 10% with rest of population). B) Vulnerable individuals
have 99% reduced contacts from period 4 to 15. C) Vulnerable individuals have 99% reduced
contacts from period 4 to 24.
