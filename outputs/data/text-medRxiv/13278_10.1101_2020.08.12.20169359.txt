Key Points

44

Question. Does transfusion of human convalescent plasma reduce mortality among

45

hospitalized COVID-19 patients?

46

Findings. Transfusion of convalescent plasma with higher antibody levels to

47

hospitalized COVID-19 patients significantly reduced mortality compared to transfusions

48

with low antibody levels. Transfusions within three days of COVID-19 diagnosis yielded

49

greater reductions in mortality.

50

Meaning. Embedded in an Expanded Access Program providing access to COVID-19

51

convalescent plasma and designed to assess its safety, several signals consistent with

52

efficacy of convalescent plasma in the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients

53

emerged.

Abstract

55

Importance: Passive antibody transfer is a longstanding treatment strategy for

56

infectious diseases that involve the respiratory system. In this context, human

57

convalescent plasma has been used to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but

58

the efficacy remains uncertain.

59

Objective: To explore potential signals of efficacy of COVID-19 convalescent plasma.

60

Design: Open-label, Expanded Access Program (EAP) for the treatment of COVID-19

61

patients with human convalescent plasma.

62

Setting: Multicenter, including 2,807 acute care facilities in the US and territories.

63

Participants: Adult participants enrolled and transfused under the purview of the US

64

Convalescent Plasma EAP program between April 4 and July 4, 2020 who were

65

hospitalized with (or at risk of) severe or life threatening acute COVID-19 respiratory

66

syndrome.

67

Intervention: Transfusion of at least one unit of human COVID-19 convalescent plasma

68

using standard transfusion guidelines at any time during hospitalization. Convalescent

69

plasma was donated by recently-recovered COVID-19 survivors, and the antibody

70

levels in the units collected were unknown at the time of transfusion.

71

Main Outcomes and Measures: Seven and thirty-day mortality.

72

Results: The 35,322 transfused patients had heterogeneous demographic and clinical

73

characteristics. This cohort included a high proportion of critically-ill patients, with 52.3%

74

in the intensive care unit (ICU) and 27.5% receiving mechanical ventilation at the time of

75

plasma transfusion. The seven-day mortality rate was 8.7% [95% CI 8.3%-9.2%] in

76

patients transfused within 3 days of COVID-19 diagnosis but 11.9% [11.4%-12.2%] in

77

patients transfused 4 or more days after diagnosis (p<0.001). Similar findings were

78

observed in 30-day mortality (21.6% vs. 26.7%, p<0.0001). Importantly, a gradient of

79

mortality was seen in relation to IgG antibody levels in the transfused plasma. For

80

patients who received high IgG plasma (>18.45 S/Co), seven-day mortality was 8.9%

81

(6.8%, 11.7%); for recipients of medium IgG plasma (4.62 to 18.45 S/Co) mortality was

82

11.6% (10.3%, 13.1%); and for recipients of low IgG plasma (<4.62 S/Co) mortality was

83

13.7% (11.1%, 16.8%) (p=0.048). This unadjusted dose-response relationship with IgG

84

was also observed in thirty-day mortality (p=0.021). The pooled relative risk of mortality

85

among patients transfused with high antibody level plasma units was 0.65 [0.47-0.92]

86

for 7 days and 0.77 [0.63-0.94] for 30 days compared to low antibody level plasma

87

units.

88

Conclusions and Relevance: The relationships between reduced mortality and both

89

earlier time to transfusion and higher antibody levels provide signatures of efficacy for

90

convalescent plasma in the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. This

91

information may be informative for the treatment of COVID-19 and design of

92

randomized clinical trials involving convalescent plasma.

Introduction
Passive antibody transfer, including convalescent plasma or serum, has
1-3

96

previously been used to treat infectious diseases that involve the respiratory system

.

97

This therapeutic approach was established early in the last century and included

98

widespread use of convalescent plasma for treatment of the 1918 influenza 4. In this

99

context, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has revived interest in the

100

use of convalescent plasma for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

101

Although there is substantial interest in the use of COVID-19 convalescent plasma, the

102

efficacy signals are preliminary 5,6.

103

In response to the global COVID-19 pandemic and need for access to treatments

104

possibly providing benefit while randomized clinical trials were in various stages of

105

development and enrollment, the Mayo Clinic initiated the US Expanded Access

106

Program (EAP) for convalescent plasma, which resulted in widespread use of

107

convalescent plasma to treat COVID-19 in the U.S. The EAP received collaborative and

108

financial support from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority

109

(BARDA). Although the charter of the EAP was to provide access to and assess the

110

safety of COVID-19 convalescent plasma, we performed exploratory analyses on the

111

efficacy of this agent. We hypothesized, based on historical data that earlier

112

administration of convalescent plasma with high antibody levels would be associated

113

with reduced mortality. To address this hypothesis, we evaluated seven and 30-day

114

mortality in 35,322 hospitalized adults transfused with COVID-19 convalescent plasma

115

by asking two questions. First, was earlier treatment of patients with convalescent

116

plasma after diagnosis of COVID-19 associated with reduced mortality compared to

117

later treatment in the course of disease? Second, were higher antibody levels in the

118

transfused convalescent plasma associated with reduced mortality?

Methods

120

Design and Oversight

121

As described previously7,8, the EAP was a US Government-sponsored, national,

122

pragmatic intervention conducted as a multicenter, open-label protocol in hospitalized

123

adults with COVID-19. All hospitals or acute care facilities in the US and any physician

124

licensed in the US were eligible to participate provided they agreed to adhere to the

125

treatment protocol, FDA, and state regulations.

126

Mayo Clinic served as the academic research organization conducting the study. The

127

Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board (IRB) was the central IRB, approved the protocol

128

all modifications, and performed regulatory oversight for all sites and investigators. The

129

principal investigator served as the regulatory sponsor. A Data and Safety Monitoring

130

Board oversaw the safety analyses and advised the regulatory sponsor and the Mayo

131

Clinic IRB on risk. Written informed consent was obtained from the participant or a

132

legally-authorized representative prior to enrollment, except for those patients who

133

necessitated use of an emergency consent process defined in collaboration with the US

134

FDA.

135

Participants

136

Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, hospitalized with a laboratory confirmed

137

diagnosis of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-

138

CoV-2), and had (or were judged by a healthcare provider to be at high risk of

139

progression to) severe or life-threatening COVID-19. Inclusion criteria and the clinical

140

symptoms defining severe or life-threatening COVID-19 are outlined in Supplement 1.

141

Plasma Collection

142

Convalescent plasma was obtained from a registered or licensed blood collector, and

143

COVID-19 antibody levels were unknown at the time of plasma collection. Convalescent

144

plasma was donated by COVID-19 survivors with confirmed diagnosis via clinical

145

laboratory test whom were symptom free for 14 days, or more according to standard

146

blood center procedures9. An aliquot of plasma or serum was shipped from a subset of

147

blood collection centers for later antibody testing. At the time of collection, each plasma

148

unit was assigned a standardized identifying number (ISBT 128 code) specific to the

149

donor, which was used to link antibody levels with study outcomes corresponding to the

150

plasma recipient(s).

151

Plasma Transfusion

152

Compatible COVID-19 convalescent plasma was administered intravenously according

153

to individual institutional protocols. The transfusion dose of COVID-19 convalescent

154

plasma was at least one unit (approximately 200 mL), with the option to administer

155

additional doses if clinically justified.

156

Data Entry

157

Web-based, standardized data reporting surveys were completed to assess the clinical

158

status of patients using the Research Electronic Data Capture system (REDCap,

159

v.9.1.15 Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN)10,11, with FDA authorization, as previously

160

described7,8. Given the rapidity at which the EAP was implemented and considering the

161

stress on clinical staff at participating sites during this on-going pandemic, the web-

162

based case reporting forms were designed to optimize convenience. Additionally,

163

although the patient inclusion criteria were specific to hospitalized patients, these

164

criteria were exceptionally broad (Supplement 1). While these elements of the EAP

165

may be atypical, they are perhaps understandable in a crisis of the magnitude of the

166

COVID 19 pandemic.

167

Antibody testing

168

Binding antibody levels from sera were tested using the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics

169

VITROS Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) in accordance

170

with manufacturer instructions12. The Ortho-Clinical IgG CLIA is a qualitative assay

171

based on a recombinant form of the SARS-CoV-2 spike subunit 1 protein. Results of

172

this assay are based on the sample signal-to-cut-off (S/Co) ratio, with values <1.0 and

173

≥1.00 corresponding to negative and positive results, The S/Co values reflect relative

174

levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

175

Statistics

176

The sample size for the EAP was not determined a priori and patient accrual has not

177

concluded at the time of this writing. The sample sizes for these analyses varied by the

178

availability of linked antibody data, and in some cases, missing data. For the analyses

179

not associated with antibody data, all transfusions on or before July 4, 2020 were

180

included (i.e., three months after the first confirmed transfusion in the EAP). The

181

database was locked for this study report on August 5, 2020 to allow all included

182

patients to have up to 30 days of follow up after transfusion. For the subset of patients

183

with remnant samples suitable for antibody analysis, all patients matched by the

184

standardized identifying number (ISBT 128 code) were included, with some caveats

185

detailed below.

186

Based on insights from the pre-antibiotic era that antibody therapy was most effective

187

when given early2,13, our cohort was stratified into categories based on the days from

188

COVID-19 diagnosis to plasma transfusion, including: 0, 1-3, 4-10, and 11 or more days

189

and for some graphical presentations and analyses, dichotomized into 0-3 vs. 4 or more

190

days. The timing of death was recorded within the precision of a calendar day, so

191

adjustments were needed to develop survival estimates. For deaths that occurred on

192

the same day of plasma transfusion, a death indicator representing 0.5 days was

193

assigned. Otherwise, the number of days between plasma transfusion and death was

194

calculated for each patient. Transfused patients were assumed to be alive unless death

195

was recorded via web-based reporting survey.

196

Given that patients may have had more than one unit of plasma from different donors

197

and the days from diagnosis to transfusion were heterogeneous, decision rules were

198

required for analyses of the antibody data. To control for the potential confounding

199

effects of plasma volume and non-uniform antibody levels between multiple plasma

200

units in the analysis, plasma recipients with a single unit, defined as 150 – 250 mL of

201

plasma, were included in the analysis. Finally, plasma from a single donor may have

202

been fractioned into multiple plasma units and transfused to multiple recipients. The

203

analysis did not adjust for the potential clustering that may have occurred in doing so.

204

For the semi-quantitative Ortho-Clinical IgG assay, low, medium and high relative

205

binding antibody levels were established by setting thresholds for low and high based

206

on the ~20th and ~80th percentiles of the distribution for the S/Co ratios, respectively.

207

Accordingly, the thresholds were set at 4.62 S/Co and 18.45 S/Co.

208

Unadjusted (crude) mortality and adjusted mortality estimates were constructed. For the

209

unadjusted mortality, or case fatality rate, tabulations of the number of mortality events

210

recorded divided by the total number at risk were computed. Score confidence intervals

211

were estimated. For analysis within subgroups, crude mortality was also estimated by

212

grouping the events on key strata variables (e.g., time to transfusion; time epoch of the

213

study)

214

With the study being non-randomized and containing multiple sources of possible

215

confounding, adjusted estimates of point mortality were also estimated. Two

216

approaches to adjusting for confounding were implemented. First, the general process

217

of generating crude estimates by strata was used to estimate the relative risk by stratum

218

and then a pooled (common) estimate over all strata was estimated using the Mantel-

219

Haenszel estimator. The second approach for adjusted point estimates was developed

220

as an extension of the methods used for estimating adjusted survival, using a baseline

221

Cox regression model fitted to the data. Without loss of generality, we assumed a

222

single variable of direct interest (e.g., days to transfusion) and a set of covariates to be

223

controlled for within the estimate. Using the 'conditional' method for estimating adjusted

224

survival curves14, an adjusted estimate of the mortality at Day 7, for example, was

225

obtained. To estimate the confidence interval for the adjusted survival curve, the

226

bootstrap method was used. For each of the bootstrap replicates, the original full data

227

set was used to determine the reference distribution for standardization of the mortality

228

estimate. This approach was extended to provide an estimate of the relative risk over

229

one or more variables of interest. The posterior distribution of potential relative risks was

230

constructed by a Cartesian merge of the posterior adjusted survival estimates for each

231

group. The 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of this distribution were used as the bootstrap

232

confidence interval for the relative risk. No p-values were provided for this method. The

233

adjustment variables used in these analyses were as follows: time epoch (as shown in

234

Table 1), gender, race, age at enrollment (as categories), and indicator variables for

having already developed one or more severe COVID-19 conditions (as shown in Table

steroids prior to transfusion.

3.6.2.

Results

244

Patient Characteristics

245

Between April 4 and July 4, 2020, 47,047 patients were enrolled in the EAP, of whom

246

36,226 were transfused with COVID-19 convalescent plasma. Of the 1,959 registered

247

sites with at least one patient enrolled, 1,809 sites had transfused at least one patient

248

(92.3%) and 928 sites had transfused at least ten patients (47.4%), Figure 1. Data were

249

included for 35,322 transfused patients with 7-day and 30-day follow-up. Key patient

250

characteristics are presented in Table 1, stratified into three groups delineating the time

251

period of the study and COVID-19 pandemic. The data set represented a non-

252

probability sample of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with diverse representation of

253

gender, age, weight status, race, and ethnicity. As shown in Table 1, the patients

254

transfused early in the study period (before May 01) were more critically-ill (higher rates

255

of mechanical ventilation, ICU admissions and septic shock), had higher concomitant

256

treatment with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, and lower concomitant treatment

257

with remdesivir compared with groups transfused later in the study period.

258

Unadjusted Analyses

259

Since the initiation of the EAP, there has been a reduction in both the seven-day crude

260

mortality rate and a pronounced shift of the time to transfusion towards more rapid

261

transfusion of convalescent plasma. The crude seven-day mortality rate was reduced in

262

patients transfused within 3 days (8.7%, 8.3%-9.2%) of COVID-19 diagnosis compared

263

to patients transfused 4 or more days after COVID-19 diagnosis (11.9%, 11.4%-12.3%;

264

P<0.001), Table 2. Similar trends were seen for unadjusted 30-day mortality. Table 2

265

presents several additional analyses by risk modifiers (e.g., age and ventilation status at

266

time of transfusion). As a means for controlling for study epoch, the time to transfusion

267

association is presented further stratified by study period. More favorable estimates for

268

mortality were found for all early transfusions (3 or fewer days) across both 7- and 30-

269

day mortality for all three study months (P<0.001; Table 2).

270

Adjusted Analysis including Antibodies

271

In a subset of 3,082 transfused patients who received only a single unit of plasma (150

272

– 250 mL), the unadjusted antibody association with mortality is presented in Table 2.

273

Supplemental Table 2 presents the key demographic data by antibody groups (low,

274

medium and high) for these patients. While there were some statistically significant

275

differences among the antibody level groupings, this table shows that patients were well

276

balanced across the antibody level groupings as a whole. The associations of mortality

277

with antibody levels was found at both 7- and 30-days (p<0.05 for both) and when

278

antibody levels were stratified by time to transfusion, a pronounced separation in

279

mortality was found between the extremes of the classification (early transfusion, high

280

antibody levels vs. late transfusion, low antibody levels) albeit the associations for 7-day

281

mortality was at the threshold for statistical significance (p=0.05). Supplemental Table

282

2 presents additional estimates of crude mortality on the subset of patients with

283

matched antibody data.

285

Figure 2B presents these same data allowing for the timing of the transfusion to be

286

integrated directly into the analysis. These data demonstrate a clear “dose” dependent

287

relationship of reduced 7-day mortality with the higher antibody levels. Figure 2C and

288

2D replicate these findings using 30-day mortality data. While some confidence intervals

289

include the null value of relative risk of 1.0, the magnitude of relative risks, particularly

290

after adjustment, is an important finding of the study.

291

Figure 3 presents an alternate analytical approach to estimate the effect of the antibody

levels. The stratified Mantel-Haenszel approach estimates the relative risk for both 7-

293

and 30-day mortality for patient profiles in the analysis. This stratification approach

294

provides direct analytical control for the potential confounders as each row in the figure

295

represents homogeneity with respect to the factors listed. Overall, there is a consistent

296

signal of a protective effect of the high antibody levels across the strata. The pooled, or

297

common, relative risk for 7-day and 30-day mortality were 0.65 (0.47 to 0.92) and 0.77

298

(0.63 to 0.94). For this analysis only patients transfused with units containing antibody

299

levels over 18.45 S/Co or less than 4.62 S/Co were included.

Discussion

301

In our cohort of over 35,000 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, several signals

302

consistent with effectiveness for convalescent plasma were observed in a broad sample

303

of acute care facilities across the US. Earlier use of convalescent plasma was

304

associated with lower observed rates of 7-day and 30-day mortality. The use of

305

convalescent plasma with higher antibody levels was associated with reduced 7-day

306

and 30-day mortality. These findings were supported by two different analytical methods

307

used to control for confounding. The finding of a dose response between antibody levels

308

and reduction in mortality provides strong evidence that specific antibody is the active

309

agent in convalescent plasma for treatment of COVID-19. All data considered as a

310

whole, these findings are consistent with the notion that the quality and manner in which

311

convalescent plasma is administered to patients hospitalized with COVID-19 may

312

reduce mortality.

313

Given the historical efficacy of passive antibody therapy for infectious diseases, the

314

primary objective of the EAP was to facilitate access to convalescent plasma for

315

hospitalized COVID-19 patients across the US. The other major goal was to assess

316

safety. With these goals met7,8, we analyzed the data from 1,809 sites and noted there

317

was variability in time to transfusion after diagnosis. Initially, we had no information

318

about the antibody levels in the convalescent plasma being administered.

319

factors provided elements of inherent randomization in the data collected and formed

320

the basis of an exploratory analysis for signals associated to efficacy. They are also

321

consistent with key principles of antibody therapy recognized during the heyday of this

322

treatment modality in the 1920s and 30s15,16, supporting their use as a framework to

323

explore the efficacy of convalescent plasma in COVID-19.

324
325

Time to Treatment
Both 7-day and 30-day mortality adjusted for disease severity and demographic factors

326

were reduced in patients transfused within 3 days of COVID-19 diagnosis compared to

327

patients transfused 4 or more days after COVID-19 diagnosis. Additionally, the declining

328

week-to-week trends in crude mortality (as previously observed7) were temporally

329

associated with more rapid treatment. Prior to the antibiotic era, treatment of respiratory

330

infections with antibody therapy was most effective if initiated within three days of

331

hospitalization. Thus, we used a similar timeframe, relative to date of diagnosis rather

332

than hospitalization, for stratifying the current data. Along similar lines, 7 and 30 day

333

survivors received on average higher volumes of plasma in unadjusted analyses. This is

334

of interest because we had no knowledge of the volume of plasma which might

335

constitute an efficacious dose prior to beginning this study.

336

Antibody Assessment

337

Seven and 30 day mortality rates were reduced in patients who received plasma with

338

higher antibody levels. This finding is more limited than the time data as only a subset of

339

the plasma units had remnant samples preserved that were suitable for assaying

340

antibody levels. The survival benefit became more pronounced when the analysis was

341

restricted to less severely ill patients treated early. Because of the multifactorial nature

342

of antibody-mediated effects and the potential for other disease modifying factors to be

343

present in convalescent plasma, further assay development to more fully characterize

344

the mechanisms in which plasma confers anti-viral properties is warranted. We also

345

note that there was no evidence of worsening outcomes or increased mortality in

346

patients treated with very high antibody levels indicating that antibody dependent

347

enhancement of disease was unlikely. Finally, it is important to recognize that the

348

antibody levels we obtained were on repurposed remnant biospecimens collected for

349

blood banking quality assurance. Thus there was potential variability in a number of

350

factors related to biospecimen handling and storage that might influence the

351

measurement of antibody levels in the specimens available to us. Of note adjusted 30-

352

day mortality was 30% in patients treated with plasma with low antibody levels (IgG) 4

353

or more days after COVID-19 diagnosis. By contrast 30-day mortality was 20% in

354

patients treated within 3 days of diagnosis with plasma with high antibody levels. The

355

pooled estimate from the stratified analysis estimated a 23% relative reduction in

356

mortality at 30 days across a wide range of sub-strata within the study. This reduction in

357

mortality is similar to that observed in a number of small randomized trials and

358

retrospective matched control studies17.

Limitations

360

The design of the EAP has been criticized because it was not a randomized placebo,

361

controlled trial (RCT)18. We started the EAP in late March 2020. It was designed to

362

provide access to convalescent plasma largely at hospitals and acute care facilities that

363

were not already part of a RCT or did not have the infrastructure to support complex

364

RCTs. We also envisioned modest total enrollment and our original IRB approval was

365

for 5,000 patients. In this context, our primary goal was to report on the safety of

366

convalescent plasma and to perform an exploratory analysis for potential signals of

367

efficacy. As described earlier, the EAP was a pragmatic study design, organized to

368

allow routine clinical care to dictate the timing and administration of plasma with the

369

collection of real world data. We did not prespecify which medications patients should

370

be on to participate. The enrollment and data collection forms were streamlined to make

371

participation easy for sites engulfed in the work of a pandemic. The use of a central,

372

academic IRB allowed for consistent data evaluation and oversight. We streamlined PI

373

credentialing and IRB reliance processes. All forms were web-based at a time when

374

some believed that SARS-CoV-2 might be transmitted via paper contaminated with the

375

virus. We did not randomly assign treatment strategies or use of adjunctive medications.

376

Nonetheless, there were some elements of randomization or pseudo-randomization in

377

our study. Physicians could choose the timing of convalescent plasma, the number of

378

units administered, any repeat therapies and whether ICU or mechanically ventilated

379

patients were included. Furthermore, the degree of immune activity within the units of

380

convalescent plasma (i.e. specific IgG levels) was not known. It was assumed that

381

patients would receive plasma with low, medium and high antibody levels in a pseudo-

382

randomized manner and that would enable assessment of efficacy.

383

We acknowledge that RCTs produce evidence of the highest quality in most but not all

384

clinical situations. RCTs can occur when a number of specific criteria are present which

385

allow their conduct. First, RCTs necessitate a stable supply of investigational product

386

(i.e. convalescent plasma) or placebo/comparator which can be pre-positioned at all

387

participating sites. The supply of convalescent plasma in April was not sufficient for

388

such collection and pre-positioning. Second, RCTs require sufficient numbers of sites

389

which have an appropriate patient base to approach for the study. The COVID-19

390

pandemic has migrated across different US regions every few weeks, making it

391

challenging to predict where sites should be selected and prepared for a RCT. Third,

392

sites must be validated and activated. This work requires training of the investigators

393

and study team members as well as typically on-site visits. The crises of the COVID-19

394

pandemic were not compatible with these site training and activation activities; travel

395

within the US has been restricted and staff sent to activate sites would likely have been

396

quarantined for two weeks before being able to go to another region to activate sites.

397

Fourth, the very nature of a RCT requires subject willingness to be randomized to active

398

treatment or placebo or a comparator agent. There was no consensus in April nor is

399

there a global consensus now regarding what would be an appropriate placebo-control

400

to use.

401

randomized to a placebo based upon historical precedent. Sixth, the number of sites

402

who could have participated in a RCT is limited; who was the appropriate ethical entity

403

to pick those sites and to exclude other sites? Our design allowed any willing hospital,

404

PI and patient to be included in the pragmatic, real-world data study. Finally, there were

405

ongoing small RCTs when we started this program. Physicians, hospitals and patients

406

have the choices of this program versus a RCT. It is clear that over 90,000 patients and

407

over 10,000 physicians elected to participate in the pragmatic, real-world evidence

408

study design. We did not indicate our study would prove efficacy or even offer potential

409

help. It was clear that it was a research investigation and informed consent was

410

obtained in all subjects prior to the transfusion of plasma. Perhaps the current design

411

can inform trialists and RCT advocates of the importance of study designs which are

412

easy and simple to join/enroll and which make the workload of participation as easy and

413

clinically relevant as possible.

414

Conclusion

415

The relationships between mortality and both time to plasma transfusion, and antibody

416

levels provide a signature that is consistent with efficacy for the use of convalescent

417

plasma in the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

Fifth, many COVID-19 patients would likely have been distrustful of being

Trial Protocol

543

1 | Study Objectives
Convalescent plasma is a potential disease altering therapy for hospitalized patients
with COVID-19 infections. There is strong historical precedence for its use in respiratory
infections suggesting it may be effective in the treatment of COVID-19. Additionally, the
administration of convalescent plasma is considered well-tolerated and safe, both
historically and within the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic.

554
555

1.2 | Primary Objectives
The primary outcome of this Expanded Access Program was to provide access to
COVID-19 convalescent plasma, assessed as the availability of convalescent plasma.
1.3 | Secondary Objectives
The secondary outcome of this Expanded Access Program was to determine the safety
of transfusion of COVID-19 convalescent plasma assessed as the case-rate and
relatedness of serious adverse events.

557
558

1.4 | Tertiary Objectives
The tertiary outcome of this Expanded Access Program was to explore the efficacy of
transfusion of COVID-19 convalescent plasma.

559

2 | Study Intervention

560
561
562
563

This Expanded Access Program was a national, pragmatic intervention conducted as a
multicenter, open-label protocol in hospitalized adults with COVID-19. All patients
received the study intervention (COVID-19 convalescent plasma transfusion). Primary
study endpoints included:
1. Hospital discharge
2. Death
3. 30 days of observation after COVID-19 convalescent plasma transfusion

2.1 | Study Intervention Description
Compatible COVID-19 convalescent plasma was administered intravenously according
to accepted transfusion guidelines used for fresh frozen plasma.
2.2 | Dosing and Administration
For practical purposes in the current outbreak, one – two units of compatible COVID-19
convalescent plasma were administered. Convalescent plasma was obtained from a
registered or licensed blood collector and was collected preferably by apheresis or, if
necessary, by conventional methods. Individual institutional guidelines for the
administration of plasma were followed, including the use of any premedications, such
as acetaminophen or diphenhydramine.

583
584

2.3 | Preparation and Packaging
Compatible convalescent plasma units were obtained from a registered or licensed
blood collector following registration of a patient under the auspices of the Expanded
Access Program. COVID-19 convalescent plasma was supplied as an investigational
blood product for the treatment of COVID-19. The plasma container label of the COVID19 convalescent plasma unit included the following statement, “Caution: New Drug –
Limited by Federal (or United States) law to investigational use.” (21 CFR 312.6(a)).

585

3 | Research Population

586
587
588

Eligible patients for this Expanded Access Program were identified by their treating
providers. The patient inclusion criteria were specific to hospitalized patients, these
criteria were exceptionally broad.
