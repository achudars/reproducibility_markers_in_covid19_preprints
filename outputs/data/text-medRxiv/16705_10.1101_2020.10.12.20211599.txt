Abstract
The clinical course of COVID-19 is very heterogeneous: Most infected individuals can be managed in an
outpatient setting, but a substantial proportion of patients requires intensive care, resulting in a high rate of
fatalities. Recently, an association between contact to small children and mild course of COVID-19 was
reported. We performed an observational study to assess the impact of previous infections with seasonal
coronaviruses on COVID-19 severity. 60 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infections were included (age
30 - 82 years; 52 males, 8 females): 19 inpatients with critical disease, 16 inpatients with severe or
moderate disease and 25 outpatients (age and gender matched to inpatients). Patients with critical disease
had significantly lower levels of HCoV OC43- (p=0.016) and HCoV HKU1-specific (p=0.023) antibodies at
the first encounter compared to other COVID-19 patients. Our results indicate that previous infections with
seasonal coronaviruses might protect against a severe course of disease. This finding should be validated
in other settings and could contribute to identify persons at risk before an infection.

At present, approximately 10 to 20 percent of COVID-19 patients need medical treatment in hospitals and
about 5% need long-term treatment on intensive care units (ICU). In contrast, the majority of COVID-19
patients can be managed in an outpatient setting. Known important risk factors are age, male gender, high
body mass index and pre-existing chronic conditions [1]. However, also young and seemingly healthy
individuals are at risk to die from COVID-19 infections. At present, this heterogeneity of the disease course
is not well understood. Partial immunity against SARS-CoV-2 might contribute to this phenomenon, as
recently discussed in reports about cross-reactivity against SARS-CoV-2: Grifoni [2] and Le Bert [3]
described T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 in unexposed human individuals. In a recent survey, patients
with mild course of COVID-19 reported frequent contact to small children [4]; therefore, exposure to
childhood-related infections might modify the disease severity of COVID-19. This corresponds to the low
incidence of severe COVID-19 infections in small children [5]. Seasonal coronaviruses mainly cause mild
respiratory tract infections and are frequently found in children. Like SARS-CoV-2, those viruses belong to
the subfamily of Orthocoronavirinae. Hence, the objective of this work is to assess if previous infections
with a seasonal coronavirus – as indicated by antibody levels – modify the disease course of COVID-19.

Antibody measurement
Antibodies against seasonal coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 were measured with the immunostrip assay
recomLine SARS-CoV-2 IgG from Mikrogen GmbH, Neuried, Germany. Regarding seasonal coronaviruses,
this assay measures IgG antibodies directed against the nucleocapsid protein (NP) of HCoV 229E, NL63,
OC43 and HKU1. With respect to SARS-CoV-2, NP-specific and spike protein (S)-specific antibodies
directed against the S1 subunit and the receptor binding domain (RBD) were determined. Measurements
were performed at the Institute of Virology/Department of Clinical Virology of the University Hospital
Münster according to the guidelines of the manufacturer. To test precision and reliability, a dilution series
and repetitive antibody measurements were performed. Negative and positive controls were analyzed.

Data processing and analysis
Antibody levels were visually determined according to the guidelines of the manufacturer as ordinal values
using the cutoff band of immunstrips as internal reference. Results of individual coronavirus-specific bands
were rated on an ordinal scale as non-detectable (-), below cutoff (+/-), with cutoff intensity (+), above cutoff
(++), and very strong intensity (+++). In addition, relative antibody levels were quantitatively determined
with ImageJ (version 153, 64bit-Version for windows) [6] using the signal intensity of the cutoff band of
individual immunstrips as internal reference. Results were expressed as ratio signal intensity HCoV-specific
band to signal intensity cutoff band. Standardized photographs from immunostrip assays were used for this
analysis. Demographical data, type of treatment and length of stay were extracted by the Medical Data
Integration Center (MeDIC) from the hospital information system of the University Hospital Münster (ORBIS
from Dedalus Healthcare Group). Descriptive statistics and statistical tests were performed with R (version
3.6.1). Ordinal and numerical values were analyzed with Wilcoxon tests. Association of numerical values
was assessed with Spearman correlation. A two-sided p-value of 0.05 was considered significant.

According to the visual determination of band intensities, levels of HCoV OC43- and HKU1-specific IgG
antibodies were significantly lower for COVID-19 inpatients with critical disease compared to all other
patients (p=0.016 for OC43; p=0.023 for HKU1; Wilcoxon test with ordinal measurement data). Figure 1
presents ordinal IgG antibody levels against HCoV for COVID-19 patients with critical disease compared to
other COVID-19 patients. This finding was confirmed by densitometric determination of relative antibody
levels (Figure 2).

To further assess potential clinical implications of antibodies against endemic coronaviruses for COVID-19
patients, correlation of LoS and antibody levels against HCoVs OC43 as well as HKU1, respectively, was
analyzed (Figure 3). Long hospitalization periods were predominantly seen in patients with low antibody
levels, but this correlation was not significant.

Recently, several groups have reported immunological cross reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 in unexposed
individuals [2, 3]. From a public health perspective, the relatively high proportion of COVID-19 patients with
critical disease poses the key problem of this pandemic: overload of the healthcare system. If a previous
infection with a known pathogen modified the course of COVID-19, i.e. decreased the proportion of
intensive care patients, this could become a component to overcome the pandemic: Persons at risk for a
severe course of disease could be identified before a SARS-CoV-2 infection and appropriate protective
measures could be taken. Of note, this might also be relevant for vaccination strategies.

This observational study assessed a potential relationship between previous infections with seasonal
coronaviruses – measured as antibody levels – and the severity of COVID-19 disease. It was shown that
elevated antibody levels for HCoVs OC43 and HKU1 were associated with less need for intensive care
therapy. In addition, a clear trend towards a reduced length of hospital stay was observed. One might argue
that higher levels of antibodies against seasonal coronaviruses are merely a surrogate marker for a more
active immune system. However, HCoVs OC43 and HKU1 are betacoronaviruses and therefore closer
related to SARS-CoV-2 than HCoVs 229E or NL63. This is in line with our data that previous exposure to
HCoVs OC43 and HKU1 has a stronger association with severity of COVID-19 than HCoV 229E or NL63
infections in the past. A possible explanation might be that previous exposure to seasonal
betacoronaviruses facilitates immune response to SARS CoV-2. Further research is needed to assess the
molecular mechanism behind our findings. Of note, cross-reactivity between HCoV OC43 and SARS-CoV
was already described in 2006 [7]. Kissler [8] developed a simulation model for transmission dynamics of
SARS-CoV-2 and reports that even mild cross-immunity from HCoV OC43 and HCoV HKU1 could
potentially have a relevant effect on SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

129
130
131
132
133

Regarding SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, an inverse pattern was detected: inpatients with critical disease
demonstrated higher median antibody levels for NP, RBD and S1 of SARS CoV-2 compared to other
patients. Similar results were reported recently [9]. Hence, there is no evidence for a general bias regarding
antibody levels and the ability to mount a humoral immune response between the three groups (outpatient,
non-ICU, ICU) in our cohort.

135

137

This study has important limitations: It is a retrospective single-site study with a limited number of cases
and association is not causation. However, it is remarkable that the effect of HCoV OC43 and HKU1specific antibody levels reached statistical significance regarding the need for intensive care therapy with
only 60 patients.

138
139

Therefore, these findings should be validated in other sites with larger patient collectives. In a prospective
setting (e.g. for risk groups with contacts to many persons like employees of hospitals or supermarkets) it

should be tested if the absence of HCoV OC43 and HKU1-specific antibody levels can identify persons at
risk for a severe course of COVID-19. Identification of vulnerable individuals is a key priority in the current
stage of the pandemic to guide protective measures and to design vaccination strategies.

143

Conclusion

144
145
146
147

Elevated levels of pre-existing antibodies against seasonal coronaviruses, specifically HCoV OC43 and
HKU1, are associated with less severe course of COVID-19. Further studies should validate this finding
and explore the potential to identify persons at risk for severe disease course before a SARS-CoV-2
infection.
