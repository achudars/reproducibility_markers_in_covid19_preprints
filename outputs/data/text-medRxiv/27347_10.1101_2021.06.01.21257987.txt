ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Information is limited on messenger RNA (mRNA) BNT162b2 (PfizerBioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE) in preventing
SARS-CoV-2 infection or attenuating disease when administered in real-world conditions.
METHODS: Prospective cohorts of 3,975 healthcare personnel, first responders, and other
essential and frontline workers completed weekly SARS-CoV-2 testing during December 14
2020—April 10 2021. Self-collected mid-turbinate nasal swabs were tested by qualitative and
quantitative reverse-transcription–polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR). VE was calculated as
100%×(1−hazard ratio); adjusted VE was calculated using vaccination propensity weights and
adjustments for site, occupation, and local virus circulation .
RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 204 (5.1%) participants; 16 were partially (≥14 days
post-dose-1 to 13 days after dose-2) or fully (≥14 days post-dose-2) vaccinated, and 156 were
unvaccinated; 32 with indeterminate status (<14 days after dose-1) were excluded. Adjusted
mRNA VE of full vaccination was 91% (95% confidence interval [CI]=76%–97%) against
symptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection; VE of partial vaccination was 81% (95%
CI=64%-90%). Among partially or fully vaccinated participants with SARS-CoV-2 infection,
mean viral RNA load (Log10 copies/mL) was 40% lower (95% CI=16%-57%), the risk of selfreported febrile COVID-19 was 58% lower (Risk Ratio=0.42, 95% CI=0.18-0.98), and 2.3 fewer
days (95% CI=0.8-3.7) were spent sick in bed compared to unvaccinated infected participants.
CONCLUSIONS: Authorized mRNA vaccines were highly effective among working-age adults
in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections when administered in real-world conditions and
attenuated viral RNA load, febrile symptoms, and illness duration among those with
breakthrough infection despite vaccination.

Messenger RNA (mRNA) BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) COVID19 two-dose vaccines were highly effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 in
randomized placebo-controlled Phase III efficacy trials 1,2. Recently, we reported interim
estimates of vaccine effectiveness (VE) in preventing symptomatic and asymptomatic SARSCoV-2 infection that showed similar benefits for mRNA vaccines administered in real-world
conditions 3. Less is known about the potentially important secondary benefits of mRNA
COVID-19 vaccine, including reductions in severity of disease, viral RNA load, and duration of
viral RNA detection.
Using prospective cohorts of healthcare personnel, first responders, and other essential and
frontline workers in eight U.S. locations, this report had three aims. First, we estimated VE of
partial and full mRNA vaccination in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections, with adjustments for
propensity to be vaccinated and local virus circulation. Second, among participants with
laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, we compared the viral RNA load of participants
who were partially or fully vaccinated with those who were unvaccinated. Third, we compared
the frequency of febrile symptoms and the duration of COVID-19 among infected participants
who were partially or fully vaccinated versus unvaccinated infected participants.
METHODS
Study Population
HEROES-RECOVERi is a network of prospective cohorts in eight locations (Phoenix, Tucson,
and other areas in Arizona; Miami, Florida; Duluth, Minnesota; Portland, Oregon; Temple,
Texas; and Salt Lake City, Utah) that initiated in July 2020 and share a common protocol,
described previously and in Supplementary_Appendix_Methods. To minimize potential selection
biases, participants were invited to join the cohorts using a sampling strategy stratified by site,
sex, age group, and occupation. The present analysis was conducted during December 14, 2020April 10, 2021. All participants provided written consent and both the RECOVER and HEROES
studies were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Boards at participating sites or
under a reliance arrangement.

ii

Measures
Socio-demographic and health characteristics were self-reported by electronic surveys at
enrollment. Each month, participants reported potential SARS-CoV-2 exposure time and their

use of face masks and other employer recommended personal protective equipment (PPE) with
four measures: hours of close contact (within 3 feet) of others at work (co-workers, customers,
patients, or the public) in the past 7 days; percent time using PPE during those hours; hours of
close contact with someone suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 at work, home, or the
community in the past 7 days; percent time using PPE during this contact.
Active surveillance for symptoms consistent with COVID-19–like illness (defined as fever,
chills, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, diarrhea, muscle aches, or change in smell or taste)
occurred through weekly text messages, e-mails, and direct participant or medical record reports.
When COVID-19–like illness was identified, participants self-reported the symptom onset date
and completed electronic surveys at the beginning and end of illness to indicate symptoms,
temperature, days sick in bed for at least half the day, receipt of medical care, and last day
symptomatic or ill (Supplementary_Appendix_Methods). Febrile COVID-19–like illness was
defined as fever, feverishness, chills, or measured temperature >38 degrees Celsius.
Laboratory Methods
Participants self-collected a mid-turbinate nasal swab weekly, regardless of COVID-19–like
illness symptoms, and collected an additional nasal swab and saliva specimen at the onset of
COVID-19–like illness. Supplies and instructions for participants were standardized across sites.
Specimens were shipped weekdays on cold packs and were tested by reverse-transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay at Marshfield Clinic Laboratory (Marshfield,
Wisconsin). Quantitative RT-PCR was conducted by the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene
(Madison, Wisconsin). SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequencing was conducted at CDC using
previously published protocols4 for viruses detected among 22 participants who were ≥7 days
post dose-1 at infection (through March 3, 2021) and 3-4 unvaccinated participants (71 total)
location- and closest-date-matched, as available. Viral lineages were categorized as variants of
concern, variants of interest, or other. We compare the percentage of variants of concern
(excluding variants of interest) among participants who are at least partially vaccinated (≥14days post-dose-1) with those unvaccinated. Further details on laboratory methods are in
Supplementary_Appendix_Methods.
Vaccination Status

COVID-19 vaccination status was documented by self-report in electronic and telephone surveys
and through direct upload of vaccination card images. Additionally, data from electronic medical
records, occupational health records, or state immunization registries were reviewed at the
Minnesota, Oregon, Texas, and Utah sites (Supplementary_Appendix_Methods).
Statistical Analysis
The primary outcome was time to RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in vaccinated
versus unvaccinated participants. Secondary outcomes included viral RNA load, febrile illness,
and illness duration. VE was estimated for full vaccination (≥14-days after mRNA vaccine dose2) and partial vaccination (≥14-days post-dose-1 and up to 13-days post-dose-2). Days 1-13
following dose-1 were excluded because vaccination status was considered indeterminate.
Hazard ratios were estimated by the Andersen-Gill extension of the Cox proportional hazards
model, which accounted for time-varying vaccination status. Unadjusted VE was calculated as
100%×(1−hazard ratio). An adjusted VE model accounted for potential confounding in
vaccination status using an inverse propensity of treatment weighting (IPTW) approach 5.
Generalized boosted regression trees were used to estimate individual propensities to be at least
partially vaccinated during each study week conditional on baseline socio-demographic and
health characteristics and the most recent reports of virus exposure and PPE use (Table 1 and
Table_S2)6. Predicted propensities were then used to calculate stabilized IPTW weights. Cox
models incorporated these stabilized weights as well as covariates for site and occupation and a
daily indicator of local virus circulation (the percentage positive of all SARS-CoV-2 testing for
local counties; Figure_S1). A sensitivity analysis removed person-days among participants with
possible misclassification of vaccination or infection and at locations when local SARS-CoV-2
circulation fell below 3% as described in Supplementary_Appendix_Methods.
Due to the relatively small number of breakthrough infections, for evaluation of possible
vaccination attenuation effects, participants with RT-PCR-confirmed infections while partially or
fully vaccinated were combined into a single vaccinated group and compared to participants who
were unvaccinated when infected. The highest viral RNA load (Log10 copies/mL) measured
during RT-PCR-confirmed infections were compared using a Poisson model adjusted for days
from symptom onset to specimen collection and for days in transit to the laboratory.
Dichotomous outcomes were compared using binary log-logistic regression to calculate relative

risks RR). Comparisons of illness duration outcomes in days were made with Student’s t-test
assuming unequal variances. All analyses were conducted with SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute)
and R (version 4.0.2; R Foundation for Statistical Computing).
RESULTS
Participant Characteristics
After exclusion of 1,147 participants with laboratory documentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection
before the start of the study period, the analytic sample consisted of 3,975 participants;
CONSORT diagram is Figure_S2. Approximately one-half of the participants (50.8%) were
from the three Arizona study sites (Table 1). The majority of participants were female (62.0%),
aged 18–49 years (71.6%), White (86.3%), and non-Hispanic (82.8%) and had no chronic
medical conditions (68.6%). Participants included primary healthcare providers (20.4%), such as
physicians and other clinical leads, nurses and other allied healthcare personnel (33.0%), first
responders (20.6%), and other essential and frontline workers (26.1%). Over the 17-week study
period, adherence to weekly surveillance reporting and specimen collection was high
(median = 100%; interquartile range = 82%–100%).
COVID-19 Vaccination Status
Most (3,179/3,975, 80.0%) of the participants received at least one dose of an authorized mRNA
COVID-19 vaccine by April 10, 2021 (Table 1); 2,686/3,179 (84.5%) received both
recommended doses; vaccine products were 66.8% Pfizer-BioNTech, 32.7% Moderna, and 0.6%
unspecified mRNA vaccine. Too few participants received Johnson & Johnson/Janssen COVID19 vaccine (n=39) for comparison with mRNA vaccines, and therefore their person-time was
censored at vaccination, and they contributed only unvaccinated person-time. Receipt of at least
one vaccine dose was higher among participants in Minnesota or Oregon and participants who
were female, aged ≥50 years, White, non-Hispanic, healthcare personnel, or had ≥1 chronic
health condition. Mean hours of close contact with people suspected or confirmed to have
COVID-19 was lower and the percentage of time using PPE was higher among vaccinated
participants (Table 1). Associations with additional covariates included in the vaccination
propensity model are presented in Table_S2. Standardized mean differences between vaccinated
and unvaccinated were well balanced after propensity weighting with a maximum difference of
0.09 (Figure_S3).

SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-confirmed Infections
SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected by RT-PCR in 204 (5.1%) participants, including 5 fully
and 16 partially vaccinated, and 156 unvaccinated; 32 with indeterminate vaccination status (<14
days post-dose-1) were excluded. Of 93 genetically sequenced viruses, 10 were variants of
concern (8 B.1.429, 1 B.1.1.7, 1 B.1.427) and 1 was a variant of interest (P.2) (Table_S3).
Excluding 12 viruses among those with indeterminate vaccination, 10 viruses were detected
among partially or fully vaccinated participants; of these, 3 (30.0%) were variants of concern (all
B.1.429) compared to 7/70 (10.0%) among unvaccinated participants.
RT-PCR-confirmed infection was higher among participants in Arizona, Florida, and Texas or
and those who were males, Hispanics, or first responders (Table 1); however, infection outcome
did not differ by reported hours of potential virus exposure and PPE use. The majority of RTPCR-confirmed infections had COVID-19–like illness symptoms before or within 1 day of
specimen collection (74.0%) or within 2-14 days after collection (13.2%); the remainder had
other symptoms (2.0%) or were asymptomatic within 14 days before and after specimen
collection (10.8%). Only 26.0% of PCR-confirmed infections were medically attended, including
two hospitalizations among unvaccinated participants; no deaths were reported.
mRNA COVID-19 Vaccine Effectiveness
During the 17-week study period, 3,975 participants contributed a median of 19 (Interquartile
Range [IQR]=8-41) unvaccinated days per participant (127,971 total); 156 RT-PCR-confirmed
SARS-CoV-2 infections were identified. While partially vaccinated, 3,001 participants
contributed a median of 22 (IQR=21-28) days (81,168 total), during which 11 RT-PCRconfirmed infections were identified. While fully vaccinated, 2,510 participants contributed a
median of 69 (IQR=53-81) days (161,613 total) during which 5 RT-PCR-confirmed infections
were identified. Results of vaccination propensity weight calculations are shown in Figure_S3.
Estimated adjusted VE of full vaccination against RT-PCR confirmed infection was 91% (95%
confidence interval [CI] = 76%–97%); VE of partial vaccination against RT-PCR confirmed
infection was 81% (95% CI=64%–90%) (Table 2). Secondary VE estimates by mRNA vaccine
product and age group are available in Table 2. VE point estimates were unchanged in a
sensitivity analysis that excluded periods of low local virus circulation (Table_S4).

Comparisons Between Partially or Fully Vaccinated and Unvaccinated RT-PCR-Confirmed
SARS-CoV-2 Infected Participants
Characteristics of 16 participants who were partially or fully vaccinated at SARS-CoV-2
infection and 156 participants who were unvaccinated at the time of infection are listed in
Table_S5. The percentage infected while partially or fully vaccinated was higher among
participants in Arizona, Minnesota, and Utah and among healthcare personnel; otherwise, there
were no other differences by socio-demographic, health, virus exposure, or PPE use (Table_S5).
Vaccine Attenuation of Viral RNA Load
Mean viral RNA load measured for 155 participants was not associated with participant
characteristics, except for somewhat lower viral RNA load among first responders (Table_S6).
The mean viral RNA load (Log10 copies/mL) detected for SARS-CoV-2 infections was 3.8
among unvaccinated and 2.3 among partially or fully vaccinated participants; in an adjusted
model, this represented 40.2% (95% CI=16.3%-57.3%) lower viral RNA load after at least
partial vaccination (Table 3). Examining viral RNA only among those vaccinated, mean viral
RNA load detected declined after receipt of dose-1 (Figure_S4).
The majority of infections among partially or fully vaccinated participants were detected for only
a single week (75.0%), while the majority of infections among unvaccinated participants (72.4%)
were detected for 2 or more consecutive weeks; this represents a 66% reduction in the relative
risk of RT-PCR-detection for ≥2 consecutive weeks (Table 3).
Vaccine Attenuation of COVID-19–like Illness and Duration
Measures of COVID-19–like illness severity and duration were not associated with participant
characteristics, with the exception of a lower mean of symptom duration at Texas and Utah and a
lower percentage of febrile COVID-19–like illness at Florida and Utah sites (Table_S6). Among
participants with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, only 25.0% of partially or fully
vaccinated participants reported febrile COVID-19–like illness compared to 63.1% of
unvaccinated participants; this represents a 58% reduction in the relative risk of febrile COVID19–like illness following at least partial vaccination (Table 3). Vaccinated participants also
reported 6.4 fewer (95% CI =0.4-12.3) total days ill or symptomatic and 2.3 fewer (95% CI=0.83.7) days sick in bed with COVID-19–like illness than unvaccinated participants.

DISCUSSION
In prospective cohorts of 3,975 healthcare personnel, first responders, and other essential and
frontline workers followed over 17 weeks in eight U.S. locations, mRNA COVID-19 vaccines
(Pfizer-BioNTech’s BNT162b2 and Moderna’s mRNA-1273) were 91% (95% CI = 76%–97%)
effective in preventing symptomatic and asymptomatic RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2
infection; VE of partial vaccination was 81%. These estimates of VE in real-world conditions are
consistent with findings from 1,2 and from a similar prospective study of healthcare personnel
that also conducts routine SARS-CoV-2 testing 7.
Among small number of participants with breakthrough RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2
infections despite vaccination, mRNA vaccines appeared to attenuate infection and disease in
multiple ways. Specimens from participants who were partially or fully vaccinated at the time of
infection had a 40% reduction in viral RNA detected and were less likely to be RT-PCR-positive
for more than one week compared to infected, unvaccinated participants. The risk of infected
individuals developing febrile COVID-19–like illness was 58% lower and illnesses were on
average about 6 days shorter with 2 fewer days sick in bed among partially or fully vaccinated
participants compared with unvaccinated participants. Reduced viral RNA presence following
mRNA COVID-19 vaccination is consistent with another recent report8, and the combination of
virologic and clinical effects we observed is consistent with previous findings of lower quantity
and duration of viral RNA detection with milder COVID-19 9.
The mechanisms by which COVID-19 vaccination elicits disease attenuation are largely
unknown but are likely due to recall of immunologic memory responses that reduce viral
replication and accelerate elimination of virally infected cells 10. The biologic plausibility of
these benefits are supported by similar phenomena observed in other studies
10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19

. Our findings are also consistent with reports of lower symptom severity

among those with moderate COVID-19 following vaccination with the Ad26.COV2.S COVID19 vaccine compared to those who received placebo in a randomized controlled trial 20.
Among this study’s strengths are the focus on working-age adults without prior laboratorydocumented SARS-CoV-2 infections, use of weekly testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection and
illness with high surveillance adherence, multi-method documentation of vaccination status, and
estimation of VE using vaccination propensity weighting, continuous local virus circulation

updates, potential virus exposure, and PPE use. The study’s use of a standard synthetic RNA to
conduct quantitative RT-PCR improves upon most prior studies that have relied upon cycle
thresholds from real-time RT-PCR as a proxy for viral RNA load 9.
This study also has at least seven limitations. First, although our estimate of 81% VE for partial
vaccination is similar to other reports 1,2,7,21,22, this estimate is based on a relatively brief period
of follow-up (median of 19 days partially vaccinated versus 69 days fully vaccinated per
participant). Second, we may have overestimated VE if we disproportionately failed to detect
infections among vaccinated participants due to vaccine attenuation of viral RNA load or
reductions in RT-PCR sensitivity due to self-collection and shipping of specimens 23. Third, the
study has not completed genetic sequencing for all viruses. Fourth, due to the relatively small
number of breakthrough infections observed, we could not differentiate attenuation effects
associated with partial versus full vaccination. Similarly, sparse data reduced the precision of
estimates, though the consistency of trends across measures affirms the direction of the overall
effect. Fifth, due to sparse data and limited racial and ethnic diversity, we were also unable to
fully examine or adjust for potential confounders of vaccine attenuation effects. Nonetheless, we
stratified our participant recruitment to ensure a combination of participant characteristics by
occupation, age, and sex; we did not observe consistent associations between socio-demographic,
health, virus exposure, or PPE use with either vaccination status, viral RNA load, or illness
duration. Sixth, febrile symptoms and illness duration were measured using self-report, which
can be subject to recall and confirmation biases. Yet, these findings are consistent with our
virologic findings of reduced viral load and duration of detection. Finally, detection of viral RNA
is not equivalent to isolation of infectious virus; however, lower RT-PCR cycle thresholds have
been associated with the ability to isolate SARS-CoV-2 in culture9, and both viral quantity and
duration of viral RNA detection are associated with infectivity and transmission in other viral
infections19,24-26.
If further data confirms that mRNA vaccination reduces the number of viral RNA particles and
the duration of detection and this in turn blunts the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, then mRNA
vaccines are not only highly effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection, but they may also
mitigate the impact of breakthrough infections, which is especially important to essential and
frontline workers given their potential to transmit the virus through frequent close contacts with

* Contributing participants in vaccination categories do not equal the number of vaccination doses because participants must be in active surveillance and have met the vaccination criteria. Persondays during days 1-13 following dose-1 and the 32 associated RT-PCR-confirmed infections are excluded from this model because immunity was considered indeterminate.
† Adjusted VE is inversely weighted for propensity to be vaccinated with doubly robust adjustment for local virus circulation, study location, and occupation (Supplementary_Appendix_Methods)

* Maximum viral load measured among all mid-turbinate nasal swabs collected for each RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection
† One specimen could not be tested due to insufficient volume
‡ Poisson model adjusted for days from symptom onset to specimen collection and days of shipping to laboratory
§ Febrile illness defined as self-reported fever, feverishness, chills, or measured temperature >38 degrees Celsius

 For illness indicators among unvaccinated participants, the denominator for febrile versus afebrile/asymptomatic excludes 7 participants with confirmed COVID-like illness (CLI) but who did
not complete an illness survey to document symptoms (or 156-7=149); for illness duration, the same 7 participants do not have total illness duration due to the missing illness survey and an
additional participant had an illness without resolution by 4/10/21 (or 149-1=148); for days sick in bed, one additional participant completed an illness survey but was missing an answer to this
item (or 148-1=147)
** For illness indicators among vaccinated participants, 1 participant with confirmed CLI completed an illness survey but was missing an answer to days sick in bed (or 16-1=15)
