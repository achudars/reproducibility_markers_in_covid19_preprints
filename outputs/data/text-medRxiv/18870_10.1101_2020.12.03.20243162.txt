ABSTRACT

22
23

Rationale:

24

Inhaled antimicrobials enable high local concentrations where needed and, compared to orally

25

administration, greatly reduce the potential for systemic side effects. In SARS-CoV-2 infections,

26

hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) administered as dry powder via inhalation could be safer than oral HCQ

27

allowing for higher and therefore more effective pulmonary concentrations without dose limiting

28

toxic effects.

29
30

Objectives:

To assess the local tolerability, safety and pharmacokinetic parameters of HCQ

31

inhalations in single ascending doses of 5, 10 and 20 mg using the Cyclops dry powder inhaler.

32
33

Methods: 12healthy volunteers were trained in inhaling HCQ correctly. Local tolerability and safety

34

were assessed by pulmonary function tests, ECG and recording adverse events. To estimate systemic

35

exposure, serum samples were collected before and 0.5, 2 and 3.5 h after inhalation.

36
37

Results and discussion: Dry powder HCQ inhalations were well tolerated by the participants, except

38

for transient bitter taste in all participants and minor coughing irritation. There was no significant

39

change in QTc-interval or drop in FEV1 post inhalation. The serum HCQ concentration remained

40

below 10 µg/L in all samples.

41
42

Conclusion: Inhaled dry powder HCQ is safe and well tolerated. Our data support further studies with

43

inhaled HCQ dry powder to evaluate pulmonary pharmacokinetics and efficacy is warranted.

1. INTRODUCTION

46

In late December 2019 an outbreak of the novel coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome

47

Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), started in Wuhan, China, and caused the spread of corona virus disease

48

2019 (COVID-19) [1]. The WHO declared the epidemic of COVID-19 a pandemic on March 12th, 2020

49

[2]. The virus is still rapidly spreading with over 41 million cases and 1.1 million deaths reported

50

worldwide in the second week of November 2020 [3]. Currently Europe is again facing a steep rise in

51

incidence and is in its ‘second wave’ now autumn has come.

52
53

Given that this pandemic has a huge impact on healthcare systems, social life and economics, there is

54

an urgent need for treatment of COVID-19. Currently available treatment options are mostly used in

55

hospitalized patient: the anti-inflammatory drug dexamethasone and anti-viral nucleoside analog

56

prodrug remdesivir. These drugs reduce mortality and shorten time to recovery respectively [4, 5]. In

57

addition to an effective treatment there is also the need to be able to prevent and decrease

58

transmission in the general population and moreover in healthcare workers or other high-risk

59

groups. We are awaiting results from clinical trials with vaccines; as these will almost certainly not be

60

100% effective, alternatives should be investigated for both treatment in early disease and

61

prevention of transmission. Repositioning old drugs for use as antiviral or anti-inflammatory

62

treatment is an interesting strategy because the safety profile, side effects, posology and drug

63

interactions are already known which can speed up the trial program duration considerably.

64

Among those drugs is hydroxychloroquine sulphate (HCQ), which is mostly used in rheumatologic

65

conditions because of its immune-modulatory effects [6, 7]. HCQ has proven to be effective in in vitro

66

Vero cell systems infected with SARS-CoV-2 in two separate Chinese studies [8, 9]. Angiotensin

67

converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor expressing cells play an important role in the pathogenesis of

68

SARS-CoV-2 infection, as the virus uses this receptor for entering the cell [8, 10-12]. HCQ impairs the

69

terminal glycosylation of ACE2 and thereby inhibits cell-binding and consequently entry of the virus

70

into the cell [13-15]. Furthermore, HCQ also blocks transport of SARS-CoV-2 from early endosomes to

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.03.20243162; this version posted December 4, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

71

endolysosomes, a requirement to release the viral genome [8, 9, 16]. Finally, HCQ has anti-

72

inflammatory properties as it influences the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and

73

endosomal inhibition of toll-like receptors, which have a major role in innate immune response [8,

74

17-20]. Based on these in vitro findings oral HCQ was used abundantly worldwide in the beginning of

75

the COVID-19 pandemic, both off label and in clinical trials. Some observational studies showed

76

clinical benefit and antiviral effects [21-25] while others did not [26, 27] or were inconclusive [28,

77

29]. Currently both the FDA and EMA advice against the off-label use of oral HCQ based on the large

78

clinical RECOVERY trial that showed no beneficial effects on 28-day mortality [30]. The prospective

79

European DISCOVERY trial and WHO SOLIDARITY trial have discontinued the oral HCQ treatment

80

because of a lack of effect on mortality arms as well. The failing treatment with oral HCQ may be

81

explained by insufficient concentrations in alveolar epithelial cells due to its enormous volume of

82

distribution of 5500 L [31]. Raising the oral dose is not an option since this is limited by adverse or

83

even toxic effects, including the risk of cardiovascular toxicity (QTc prolongation).

84

Pulmonary administration of HCQ can be the solution to reach high local pulmonary concentrations

85

without systemic toxicity [32, 33]. For this purpose, we developed a dry powder formulation of HCQ

86

suitable for inhalation using the Cyclops dry powder inhaler. The Cyclops is a high dose disposable

87

inhaler that enables effective dispersion of up to 50 mg of drug in the preferred size range for

88

inhalation [34]. The aim of this study was to assess local tolerability and safety of increasing doses of

89

dry powder HCQ administered using the Cyclops to healthy volunteers. The chosen doses of 5 mg, 10

90

mg and 20 mg are comparable with known doses of inhaled nebulized HCQ and thus expected to be

91

safe [33, 35-38]

2. METHODS

97

Study design

98

This study was an open-label phase 1a single ascending dose study with twelve healthy volunteers. It

99

was performed at the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG) location Beatrixoord (Groningen,

100

the Netherlands) between in September and October 2020. It included administration of HCQ dry

101

powder per inhalation using the Cyclops in single ascending doses of 5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg. In- and

102

exclusion criteria are listed in Table 1. The study was approved by the local medical ethical review

103

committee (METc UMCG, Groningen, The Netherlands, METc number 2020.168). The study was

104

performed according to the Helsinki declaration (Fortaleza, Brazil, 2013) and was registered at

105

clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04497519). The study was conducted with the written informed consent of all

106

participating subjects.

107

Study drug

108

The dry powder formulation of HCQ was developed at the department of Pharmaceutical Technology

109

and Biopharmacy of the University of Groningen. For the production of the study drug

110

hydroxychloroquine sulphate was obtained from Ofipharma BV (Ter Apel, the Netherlands). The HCQ

111

Cyclops was produced by PureIMS B.V. (Roden, the Netherlands). Each Cyclops contained a nominal

112

dose of 5 mg or 10 mg HCQ; the 20 mg dose was administered as 2 successive inhalations with 10 mg

113

of HCQ.

114

Objectives and procedures

115

The primary objective was to assess local tolerability and safety. Local tolerability was assessed by

116

spirometry combined with active questioning about adverse events experienced by the participants.

117

A drop of the forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) of 15% or more after inhalation of

118

HCQ compared to baseline FEV1 was considered clinically significant and critical to decide on

119

proceeding with the next ascending dose. Spirometry was performed before inhalation (baseline)

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.03.20243162; this version posted December 4, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

120

and 35 minutes and 95 minutes after inhalation of HCQ according to the ATS/ERS guidelines [39].

121

Adverse events were continually assessed during the study day. Cough for more than one hour or

122

any other reported adverse event that made either the physician or the participant decide to stop

123

participation was considered critical to decide on proceeding with the next ascending dose. ECGs

124

were performed to assess the QTc interval as safety parameter. An ECG was obtained at the

125

screening visit, before inhalation of the first dose and approximately 3.5 hours after each HCQ

126

inhalation. An observed QTc interval of more than 500 ms was also considered critical on proceeding

127

with the next ascending dose. All tolerability and safety endpoints were discussed with a Data Safety

128

Monitoring Board (DSMB) after all twelve participants completed a dose step before proceeding to

129

the next ascending dose.

130

The secondary objectives were to assess systemic exposure of HCQ and measurement of inspiratory

131

flow parameters. To determine the systemic exposure, blood samples were collected from an

132

intravenous indwelling cannula just before inhalation and 30 minutes, 2 hours and 3.5 hours after

133

inhalation of HCQ. These samples were analyzed using a validated liquid chromatography tandem

134

mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method performed at the laboratory of the department of Clinical

135

Pharmacy and Pharmacology of the UMC Groningen (ISO15189:2012 (M170) certified). The limit of

136

quantification is 10 µg/L. The delivered dose was determined by subtracting the powder residue

137

inside the Cyclops after inhalation from the exact weighed dose pre inhalation. The powder residues

138

in the Cyclops were dissolved in demineralized water and the solutions were analyzed with a Thermo

139

Scientific spectrophotometer (Genesys 150 UV–VIS, The Netherlands) at a wavelength of 236.0 nm.

140

Prior to inhalation of the study drug, study participants received inhalation instructions followed by

141

training regarding handling of the device and performing a correct inhalation maneuver. Training

142

was done using an empty Cyclops connected to a laptop, with in-house developed software

143

application (labVIEW, National Instruments, the Netherlands) for recording of and processing of flow

144

curves generated through the device. When a series of consistent flow curves meeting the criteria for

145

good inhaler performance was obtained during training, a similarly instrumented Cyclops with HCQ

146

was handed to the participant. Inspiratory flow parameters were recorded during each drug

147

administration.

148

Data management and statistics

149

Study data were collected and managed using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) [40,

150

41]. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS version 23. Data from all eligible subjects who

151

received at least one dose of the study drug were included in analyses of safety. Data were

152

summarized using descriptive statistics. At each visit and timepoint, testing for differences in pre- to

153

post-dose changes in FEV1 (liters) and QTc interval were performed using the paired T-test or

154

Wilcoxon rank sum test. P values below 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

156

RESULTS

157

Twelve healthy volunteers were enrolled, and all completed the study. See table 2 for all patient

158

characteristics. All participants had normal baseline QTc interval and G6PD-deficiency was excluded

159

in all participants. At the screenings visit pregnancy was excluded in female participants.

160

There were no serious adverse events observed during or after the study (see table 3). None of the

161

participants had cough longer than the pre-defined safety period of one hour. Minor complaints of

162

cough were reported four times, each in a different participant, directly after inhalation of HCQ; two

163

times after a dose of 10 mg HCQ and two times after a dose of 20 mg HCQ. Complaints varied from

164

experience of an itchy or tickling sensation in the throat to a single or a few observed coughs that

165

were self-limiting. Two participants reported minimal dyspnea which disappeared after coughing or

166

spontaneously within 4 minutes after inhalation. All participants mentioned bitter taste after

167

inhalation. In most participants this lasted for 5-10 minutes, but one participant reported the bitter

168

taste for 2 hours. Participants were advised to rinse their mouth with water or eat something after

169

the dose was administered with satisfying effect. Two participants had complaints of slight nausea

170

relating to the bitter taste; one for 5 minutes after a dose of 5 mg HCQ and one for 70 minutes after

171

a dose of 10 mg HCQ. Sore throat was reported by three participants. Two participants developed

172

symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection in the following days of which one tested positive by

173

PCR nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 two days after the last study visit. One participant

174

experienced some hoarseness, which disappeared after drinking some water. Two other adverse

175

events were recorded. One participant with an intrauterine contraceptive device in situ experienced

176

minor spotting two days after inhalation of HCQ after both the 5 mg and 10 mg dose. This is not

177

mentioned as a known side-effect of oral HCQ [42]. One participant mentioned dry eyes once at a

178

dose of 20 mg, which seemed to be related to the dry hospital environment and not to

179

administration of the study drug.

180

None of the participants showed a significant drop in FEV1 (≥15%) at any time point after HCQ

181

administration (see table 4). A maximum drop of -7.51% was observed 95 minutes after inhalation of

182

5 mg HCQ. This participant mentioned a sort of burning sensation at the chest at that moment as

183

well but no dyspnea, something he also recognizes while running.

184

None of the participants had a QTc prolongation ≥ 500, nor even ≥ 450 ms. Mean QTc interval was

185

412 ± 21 ms (range 384-441) at baseline. This did not change significantly 3.5 hour after inhalation of

186

5 mg, 10 mg and 20 mg HCQ, respectively (see table 5).

187

In all participants, the serum HCQ concentrations sampled 30 minutes, 2 hours and 3.5 hours, were

188

below the detection level of 10 µg/L irrespective of dose. The mean delivered dose was 3.16 mg

189

(63%) after administration of 5 mg HCQ, 6.95 mg (70%) after administration of 10 mg HCQ and 14.86

190

mg (75%) after administration of 20 mg HCQ. Based on the recorded inspiratory flow parameters, all

191

participants correctly performed the inhalation maneuvers.

DISCUSSION

195

Pulmonary administration of HCQ for early COVID-19 treatment or prevention in post-exposed

196

individuals might be better than oral administration of HCQ due to the pharmacological properties of

197

HCQ. Hypothetically, it can reach higher pulmonary concentrations compared to oral HCQ while

198

using much lower doses and exerting lower systemic exposure. This phase 1 study with inhaled HCQ

199

with three different doses showed good local tolerability and safety without significant systemic side

200

effects.

201
202

Coughing was reported four times out of a total of 36 administered doses (11%) in four different

203

participants and was very mild in severity. Coughing is often reported after inhalation of

204

antimicrobials by both wet nebulization and dry powder inhalation, with data mainly available from

205

cystic fibrosis patients treated with colistin or tobramycin. In general, this population cough is more

206

frequently reported after dry powder inhalation (ranging from 75% - 90%) than after nebulization

207

(ranging from 31% - 78%) in these patients, although some studies found no differences [43-45]. The

208

trigger for both cough and probably bitter taste is deposition of the drug in the oropharynx. This

209

could be expected since HCQ is a quinoline known for its extremely bitter taste (249 on a bitter scale

210

compared to caffeine at 46) [46]. However, the majority reported that the taste was not disturbing

211

since the participants were warned beforehand, it was minor, and it disappeared within a few

212

minutes after HCQ inhalation or even faster when rinsing the mouth with water or eating something

213

directly after inhalation.

214
215

Bronchus obstruction was not a problem after inhalation of HCQ dry powder; in none of the twelve

216

participants experienced a drop in FEV1 of more than 15%. The maximum drop was 7.5 % compared

217

to baseline and this was not accompanied by dyspnea. One participant did mention a light burning

218

sensation at the chest at that moment, something he also experienced while running. Although not

219

formerly diagnosed, this participant might suffer from a mild exercise induced asthma. Nevertheless,

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.03.20243162; this version posted December 4, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

220

we believe that HCQ dry powder can be used safely in asthma patients as well, since aerosolized HCQ

221

has been applied in a phase I clinical study to assess safety for use in asthma and was concluded to

222

be safe and well tolerated in 31 healthy individuals in doses up to 20 mg daily for 7 days [33, 36]. In

223

2006, a phase 2 clinical trial with aerosolized HCQ as anti-inflammatory treatment for patients with

224

asthma followed. A dose of 20 mg daily was tolerated for up to 21 days, but it failed to meet the

225

primary clinical endpoints for effective asthma treatment; relative improvement in FEV1 compared to

226

baseline was not statistically significant after treatment compared to placebo [33, 37]. None of these

227

participants had significant ECG changes and side effects consisted of headache and nausea only [33,

228

36, 37].

229
230

HCQ serum concentrations were below the quantification limit of 10 µg/L in all participants and

231

irrespective of dose or timepoints. Possibly our timing of blood sampling was sub optimal. The

232

timepoints were chosen based on the absorption rate after oral administration, because data after

233

inhalation were not available at that time. If the maximum concentration (Cmax) occurs very shortly

234

after inhalation (Tmax), we might have missed this peak concentration with our first blood sample

235

drawn after 30 minutes. This is supported by the only other available pharmacokinetic data from a

236

phase I clinical trial with aerosolized HCQ that came available after our study protocol was

237

developed. Fifteen healthy volunteers inhaled single doses of 5, 10 or 20 mg HCQ. Reported HCQ

238

serum concentrations were mean Cmax between 22 and 69 µg/L with an early Tmax within 2-3 minutes.

239

The reported systemic exposure was very low (7-54 µg*h/L), suggesting elimination within 30

240

minutes [33].

241

Local lung concentrations are expected to be higher after inhalation of HCQ compared to oral

242

administration, even though the highest dose of inhaled HCQ in this study (20 mg) is only a fraction

243

of the usual oral HCQ dose (200-800 mg). For example, if the delivered dose of 14.86 mg

244

homogeneously distributes over the lung tissue (843 mL) [47] , then a lung tissue HCQ concentration

245

of approximately 40 µM would be achieved. Preliminary results from our own experiments in

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.03.20243162; this version posted December 4, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

246

primary human epithelial cells indicate that HCQ concentrations of approximately 20 to 40 µM do

247

result in a significant reduction in viral load after SARS-CoV-2 infection (manuscript in preparation).

248

This is in contrast to the lack of antiviral effect found by Mulay et al. at an HCQ concentration of only

249

10 µM, which because of the fourfold lower concentration than potentially achievable after HCQ

250

inhalation seems to hold less relevance [48]. Based on these considerations, effective concentrations

251

can potentially be achieved in lung tissue after inhalation of 20 mg HCQ. These high HCQ

252

concentrations and the superior potential of inhaled over oral HCQ should be the new starting point

253

of any further clinical studies on the activity of HCQ against SARS-CoV-2.

254

The concerns about cardiotoxicity of oral HCQ, a well-known drug and generally considered to be

255

safe and well tolerated, were magnified by a large retrospective observational study that reported a

256

strong association between the use of HCQ and ventricular tachycardia and death in hospitalized

257

COVID-19 patients [50]. However, this paper was retracted soon after publication because of

258

concerns about the data validity [49, 50]. White

259

extrapolating long-term risks of myocardial damage with chronic dosing to short-term exposures,

260

thereby overestimating the risk of ventricular arrhythmias [31]. Our study shows that systemic

261

exposure after inhalation is very low, which is a positive result regarding the risk of systemic toxicity.

262

Also, the concerns for any other possible systemic adverse event should be tempered because of

263

these results.

264

A limitation of our study is that only serum concentrations are measured and not local pulmonary

265

concentrations. So far, only in vitro experiments on Vero cells have shown efficacy and data from

266

human pulmonary concentrations and thus local efficacy are lacking [8, 9]. Since in our study no

267

systemic exposure of HCQ was detected for all participants and for all doses, it is not expected that

268

systemic side effects will occur and HCQ might therefore also be used in patients of older age and

269

with comorbidities.

state that a lot of confusion has arisen by

270

In conclusion, HCQ inhalation using the Cyclops is safe and generally well tolerated by healthy

271

volunteers, except for minor cough and bitter taste. These positive results and the superior safety

272
