Abstract
Background: Vaccine hesitancy is a potential threat to global public health. Since, there is an

unprecedented global effort to develop a vaccine against the COVID-19 pandemic, much less is
known about its acceptance in the community. Understanding key determinants that influence the
preferences and demands of a future vaccine by the community may help to develop strategies for
improving the global vaccination program. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of the
acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine, and their determinants among people in Saudi Arabia.

Methods: A web-based, cross-sectional study was conducted using snowball sampling strategy

under a highly restricted environment. A bilingual, self-administered anonymous questionnaire was
designed and sent to 1000 study participants through social media platforms and email. Study
participants were recruited across the country, including the four major cities (Riyadh, Dammam,
Jeddah, and Abha) in Saudi Arabia. Associations between COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and
sociodemographic profile of the respondents were explored using the chi-squared test. Key
determinants that predict vaccine acceptance among respondents were modelled using logistic
regression analysis.

Results: Of the 1000 survey invitees, 992 responded to the survey (response rate, 99.2%). The

majority (65.8%) of the study participants were female, 29.53% were in the age group (36–45 years),
and 17.9% were non-Saudi. Of the 992 respondents, 642 (64.72%) showed interest to accept the
COVID-19 vaccine if it is available. Willingness to accept the future COVID-19 vaccine is relatively
high among older age groups (79.2% among 45+ year old), being married (69.3%), participants with
education level postgraduate degree or higher (68.8%), non-Saudi (69.1%), employed in government
sector (68.9%). In multivariate model, respondents who were above 45 years (aOR: 2.15; 95% CI:
1.08-3.21), and married (aOR: 1.79; 95% CI: 1.28-2.50) were significantly associated with vaccine
acceptance (p < .05). Besides, people having trust in the health system were most likely to accept the
vaccine (aOR: 3.05; 95% CI: 1.13-4.92), and those having a higher perceived risk of acquiring
infection were 2.13 times (95% CI: 1.35-3.85) higher odds of accepting the vaccine.

Conclusion: Addressing sociodemographic determinants relating to the COVID-19 vaccination may
help to increase uptake of the global vaccination program to tackle future pandemics. Targeted
health education interventions are needed to increase the uptake of the future COVID-19 vaccine.

Introduction
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, which widely referred
to as ‘COVID-19’, has been infecting more than 5.5 million over 144 countries(1,2). The pandemic
poses a significant threat to the public health system, including catastrophic economic consequences
around the world(3,4). Saudi Arabia has been plagued with several pandemics, including the Middle
East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak (5,6). As of
26th May 2020, the virus has rapidly spread in the Kingdom, causing a total of 76,726 laboratoryconfirmed cases with 411 deaths (CFR 0.53%)(7). A vaccine is considered to be the most awaiting
intervention and hundreds of global R&D institutions engaged in unprecedented speed to develop
the vaccine (8–11). However, public perception towards COVID-19 vaccine uptake is not available.
Numerous studies have shown several factors responsible for vaccine acceptancy when a new
vaccine is introduced(12–15). These include the safety and efficacy of the vaccine, adverse health
outcomes, misconceptions about the need for vaccination, lack of trust in the health system, lack of
knowledge among the community on vaccine-preventable diseases(15,16). Misinformation leading
towards vaccine hesitancy could put public health at risk in responding to the current crisis.
In the previous pandemic like the H1N1 influenza A, when the vaccine was introduced, the
acceptancy rate varied between 8% to 67% (12). In the United States, the acceptance rate was
reported to be 64%(13). In the United Kingdom, 56.1% of the study participants reported accepting
the swine flu (influenza A H1N1v) vaccine(17). In Hong Kong, 50.5% of the study population intended
to receive a future A/H7N9 vaccine during the outbreak in 2014(18). In Beijing, China, 59.5% of the
study participants who had heard of H7N9 were willing to accept a future influenza A(H7N9)
Vaccine(19).
Vaccine acceptance and demand are complex in nature and context-specific, varying across time,
place, and perceived behavioral nature of the community(12,14,15,20–23). A study in Ireland
showed that health care workers avoided seasonal influenza vaccination due to their misconception,
efficacy, and trust in the vaccine(24). In China, demographics and public perceptions are the
predictors of vaccination acceptance(19). In Hong Kong, anxiety level and vaccine history were the
main predictors towards vaccine acceptancy(18). In the United States, perceived effectiveness of the
vaccine, social influence, and health insurance was the key predictor towards acceptance of an
influenza vaccine(25). Another study in the United States reported greater hesitancy associated with
lower vaccine uptake and greater confidence associated with higher vaccine uptake(26). In the
United Arab Emirates, a study investigates parent attitudes about childhood vaccines and reported
only 12% of parents hesitancy towards childhood vaccination(27). The study reported vaccine safety
(17%), side effects (35%), and too many injections (28%) are critical factors in vaccine hesitancy(27).

Respondents who had a history of being vaccinated against seasonal flu were more likely to report
their intention to be vaccinated(22,23).
A systematic review highlighted the role of public trust in vaccine uptake and reported a dearth in
the research of vaccine uptake based on public trust in low and middle-income settings(21). Another
review that investigated the general public’s willingness to accept or decline a pandemic vaccine
(H1N1) identified several key predictors like people’s perceived risk of infection, the severity of the
event, personal consequences, history of previous vaccination, and ethnicity(12). A recent study
highlighted that equitable vaccination across all population groups is challenging due to the complex
human behavior which changes over space and time (20), and a meta-analysis demonstrated
behavioral health model like the “theory of planned behavior” in explaining vaccine hesitancy(14).
Numerous studies urged to enhance tailored interventions and policies to increase vaccination
uptake(12,14,15,20,24,28).
Few studies has explored the prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, and their
determinants(29,30). A study conducted among health care workers (HCWs) in China showed a high
acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination among health care workers in comparison to the general
population(30). Another study in the United States, reported that only 20% intend to decline the
COVID-19 vaccine(29). Since vaccine acceptancy is context-specific and varies with geography,
culture, and sociodemographic, we aimed to understand the public willingness of a future COVID-19
vaccine in Saudi Arabia.

Methods
Study design, sample, and setting
The cross-sectional survey was designed using SurveyMonkey® platform and used a snowball
sampling strategy. Study participants were recruited across the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, including
major cities (Riyadh, Dammam, Jeddah, and Abha), and other minor cities. Initially, the study
investigators shared the survey link in social media (Twitter, WhatsApp, Telegram channel) and
through emails to their primary contacts (aged 18 and above). The primary participants were
requested to roll out the survey further. On receiving and clicking the link, participants got auto
directed to the informed consent page. After they consented, they were allowed to take the survey.
The survey was stopped when it reaches 1000 invitees.
Study questionnaires
The survey questionnaire was developed in bilingual (Arabic and English) format and consisting
sections on sociodemographic, knowledge and perception towards COVID-19, trust in the health

system, and participants willingness to accept the COVID-19 vaccine if it is available. The
questionnaire was self-administered, and responses were recorded on a Likert scale.
Data analysis
Descriptive statistics were conducted to generate summary tables for study variables. A crosstabulation analysis was performed to examine the distribution of intention to uptake COVID-19 with
respondents’ sociodemographic characteristics using chi-squared tests. Logistic regression models
were employed using a priori hypothesis to tabulate odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence
intervals (95% CI). All data analysis was performed using STATA 13.0. A two-tailed p-value <0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
Ethical considerations
The study approval was obtained from the Institutional Research Committee of Saudi Electronic
University. Study participants were asked to participate voluntarily and were allowed to skip any
question if they were not comfortable to answer. Anonymized data was used for analysis and
interpretation.

Results
Of 1000 survey invitees, 992 (99.2%) provided the informed consent and returned the survey. Table
1 shows the summary statistics of the sociodemographic profile of the study participants. Most of
the respondents 436 (43.9%) were aged between 26-35 years, followed by 264 (26.6%) aged 18-25
years, 239 (24%) aged 36-45 years, and 53 (5%) were aged 45 years and above (Table 1). Of the 992
participants, 653 (65.8%) were female, 512 (51.6%) were married, majority 814 (82%) of the study
participants were Saudi nationality, 455 (45.8%) were from Riyadh, 497 (50.1%) completed graduatelevel education, and 428 (43.1%) reported working in a government sector (Table 1).
Table 2 shows bivariate associations between sociodemographic characteristics and intent to uptake
the COVID-19 vaccine among respondents in Saudi Arabia. Of the 992 respondents, 642 (64.7%)
intended to uptake the hypothetical vaccine, only 70 (7%) reported hesitancy towards the COVID-19
vaccine, and 280 (28.2%) were reported “not sure” about their intention (Table 2). Of the 53
respondents who were aged 45 years and above, 42 (79.2%) of them showed interest to uptake the
vaccine if it is available. Of the 512 participants who were married, 355 (69.3%) reported accepting
the COVID-19 vaccination (Table 2).
Table 3 presents logistic regression analysis for sociodemographic prediction of intent to uptake the
COVID-19 vaccine among respondents. In the multivariate model, respondents who were above 45

years are 2.15 times likely to accept the vaccine (aOR: 2.15; 95% CI: 1.08-3.21). Similarly, participants
who were married are 1.79 times likely to accept the vaccination (aOR: 1.79; 95% CI: 1.28-2.50).
Table 4 shows the logistic regression analysis for factors potentially associated with the intention to
receive the COVID-19 vaccine among respondents. In the multivariate model adjusted for
sociodemographic characteristics, participants who concerned about acquiring infection with the
COVID-19 virus were 2.13 (95%CI: 1.35-3.85) times likely to accept the COVID-19 vaccine compared
with those who were not concerned with the infection. Participants, who trusted the health system
were 3.05 (95%CI: 1.13-4.92) times most likely to accept the vaccination than those who have
reported no trust.

Discussions
Vaccination is considered one of the most outstanding public health inventions in the 21st century.
However, its acceptancy is varied with space, time, social class, ethnicity, and contextual human
behavior (14,15,20,21,31). Our study, first of its kind in Saudi Arabia, used a web-based selfadministered questionnaire and collected responses across the Kingdom, including four major cities
(Riyadh, Jeddah, Dammam, and Abha) and some minor cities in the country. Of the 992 study
participants, 642 (64.7%) said ‘yes’ to uptake the COVID-19 vaccine, 70 (7.0%) said ‘no’ to uptake
COVID-19 vaccine, and 280 (28.2%) said ‘not sure’ to uptake the COVID-19 vaccine if it is available.
Further, being aged (45 years and above) (aOR: 2.15; 95% CI: 1.08-3.21), and being married (aOR:
1.79; 95% CI: 1.28-2.50) are likely to accept the COVID-19 vaccine than their counterparts. Study
participant’s trust in the health system (aOR: 3.05; 95% CI: 1.13-4.92) and perceived risk of acquiring
infection (aOR: 2.13; 95% CI: 1.35-3.85) were found to be significant predictors in explaining
acceptancy of the COVID-19 vaccine.
Though there have been limited studies to explore the intention to uptake the COVID-19 vaccine in
the current crisis, our results are in agreement with study conducted in China, and in the United
States(29,30). The Chinese study reported 72.5% of the general population’s intention to uptake
COVID-19 vaccine(30). And the study conducted in the United States reported 80% acceptance of
the COVID-19 vaccine among the study population(29). In our study, 64.7% of study participants
showed interest in the uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine. Similar observations were made during the
H1N1 pandemic(12).
Some qualitative comparisons can be made with similar studies, like in a systematic review, the
acceptance rate varied between 8% to 67% for the H1N1 influenza A pandemic vaccine(12). The
acceptance rate was reported to be 64% in the United States(13), 56.1% in the United Kingdom (17),

59.5% in Hong Kong(18), and 59.5% in China (19). The systematic review also highlighted that there
was no consistent association with participants' demographic variables (age and sex) with vaccine
uptake behavior (12). However, in our study, old aged participants are more likely to accept COVID19 vaccination than their counterparts (aOR: 2.15; 95% CI: 1.08-3.21).
Numerous studies reported the perceived risk of becoming infected as a predictor towards intention
behind vaccination(12,22,23,30). In our study, participants who had a higher perceived risk of being
infected are 2.13 times more likely to be vaccinated than those having a lower perceived risk (aOR:
2.13; 95% CI: 1.35-3.85). Studies have shown that a higher trust in the health system is associated
with the utilization of preventive health services such as vaccination(26,32,33). In our study, odds of
having greater trust in the health system were 3.05 times higher, reporting their intention to uptake
the COVID-19 vaccine (aOR: 3.05; 95% CI: 1.13-4.92).
Our study has several limitations; firstly, it is cross-sectional, depicts a picture of the community
response at the point of the study. We asked the respondents to report their intention to receive the
COVID-19 vaccine if it is available in the future. A considerable number of study participants (28.2%)
reported “Not sure” about their intention to uptake the COVID-19 vaccination. The real intention
could be different when the vaccine is available(22). It is interesting to study how the intention
varies over time and the context in the study population. Secondly, study responses were recorded
using a web-based self-administered survey, instead of a direct face-to-face interview. This may lead
to potential bias in reporting their responses. Third, the current study didn’t explore the motivation
behind the acceptance or barriers behind the hesitancy of the VOVID-19 vaccine.
Despite the above limitations, our study is the first of its kind, with a representative sample size
across the county demonstrated the population's intention to uptake the COVID-19 vaccine. Once
the pandemic is over, we will explore many additional research questions, including vaccine
promotion strategies, vaccine safety, vaccine referral/recommendations, cost (out of pocket
expenditure), including the key motivation and barriers towards COVID-19 vaccination.

Conclusions
This is the first community-based study under a highly restricted environment that assessed the
public’s intent to accept the hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine in the Kingdom with a representative
sample. The study participant has a good intention to accept the hypothetical vaccine and is in
accordance with the previously reported figures. Participants' perceived risk and trust in the health
system were found to be significant predictors towards the intention of the COVID-19 vaccine in the
Kingdom. Further study should corroborate our findings with public health promotion interventions.
