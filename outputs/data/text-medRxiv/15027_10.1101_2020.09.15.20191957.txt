WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC
•

Test, trace and isolate systems are one of the cornerstones of COVID-19 recovery
strategy.

•

The success of the test, trace and isolation system depends on adherence to isolating if
symptomatic, getting a test if symptomatic, passing on details of close contacts if
infection is confirmed, and quarantining of contacts.

•

Rates of adherence to test, trace and isolate behaviours in the UK need to be
systematically investigated.

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
•

Self-reported adherence to test, trace and isolate behaviours is low; intention to carry
out these behaviours is much higher.

•

Identification of COVID-19 symptoms is also low.

• Practical support and financial reimbursement are likely to improve adherence to test,
trace and isolate behaviours.

ABSTRACT
Objectives: To investigate rates of adherence to the UK’s test, trace and isolate system over
time.
Design: Time series of cross-sectional online surveys.
Setting: Data were collected between 2 March and 5 August 2020.
Participants: 42,127 responses from 31,787 people living in the UK, aged 16 years or over,
are presented (21 survey waves, n≈2,000 per wave).
Main outcome measures: Identification of the key symptoms of COVID-19 (cough, high
temperature / fever, and loss of sense of smell or taste), self-reported adherence to selfisolation if symptomatic, requesting an antigen test if symptomatic, intention to share details
of close contacts, self-reported adherence to quarantine if alerted that you had been in contact
with a confirmed COVID-19 case.
Results: Only 48.9% of participants (95% CI 48.2% to 49.7%) identified key symptoms of
COVID-19. Self-reported adherence to test, trace and isolate behaviours was low (selfisolation 18.2%, 95% CI 16.4% to 19.9%; requesting an antigen test 11.9%, 95% CI 10.1% to
13.8%; intention to share details of close contacts 76.1%, 95% CI 75.4% to 76.8%;
quarantining 10.9%, 95% CI 7.8% to 13.9%) and largely stable over time. By contrast,
intention to adhere to protective measures was much higher. Non-adherence was associated
with: men, younger age groups, having a dependent child in the household, lower socioeconomic grade, greater hardship during the pandemic, and working in a key sector.
Conclusions: Practical support and financial reimbursement is likely to improve adherence.
Targeting messaging and policies to men, younger age groups, and key workers may also be
necessary.
Key words: self-isolation; symptoms; quarantine; antigen testing; COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION
In the absence of a vaccine, governments around the world are relying on test, trace and
isolate strategies to prevent the spread of COVID-19.(1) Within the UK, guidance for people
who may have COVID-19 has evolved over time, but has focused on the need for people with
a persistent new onset cough, fever or loss of their sense of taste or smell to: remain at home
for at least seven days from the onset of their symptoms; request an antigen test; and provide
the details of their close contacts to a dedicated service if the test result is positive. Isolation
and quarantine differ, with isolation being the separation of someone who is ill from others
who are not ill and quarantine being the separation and restriction of movement of someone
who is not yet ill, but who may have been exposed to a contagious disease.(2) Current
guidance requires close contacts of people who have tested positive for COVID-19 to enter
quarantine and remain at home for 14 days from the time of their contact.(3)
The ability of the test, trace and isolate system to keep rates of infection under control relies
on how well people adhere to it.(4, 5) From the point where an index case develops
symptoms to the point where their contacts are allowed to emerge from quarantine, there are
multiple stages where adherence might break down.(6) A range of factors may affect
adherence. These can be categorised using the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation and
Behaviour (COM-B) model.(7) Capability encompasses the psychological and physical
capacity to engage in a behaviour. It includes, for example, knowledge as to what the
appropriate behaviour is and when to enact it. In the context of test, trace and isolate,
knowledge of what the symptoms of COVID-19 are among the UK population has previously
been shown to be poor.(8, 9) Insufficient knowledge about the purpose of quarantine has also
hindered public health efforts in previous emerging infectious disease outbreaks.(10)
Opportunity relates to factors outside the person, for example the presence of financial
constraints (9, 11) or cramped accommodation (12) that may make remaining at home
difficult to achieve and that, in turn, may be associated with socio-economic status or
ethnicity. Motivation describes the psychological processes that energise or inhibit a
behaviour and includes the perceived risk associated with a disease outbreak,(13) the belief
that you could engage in a behaviour if you wanted to (self-efficacy), and worry about
contracting COVID-19 or passing it to others. These motivational components may
themselves be influenced by whether information received about a pandemic is viewed as
credible (14, 15) and whether the individual considers that they are ‘immune’ to COVID-19,
particularly if they believe that they have already had it.(16)

During the 2009/10 influenza H1N1 (‘swine flu’) pandemic, we analysed a series of 39
surveys commissioned by the English Department of Health to identify the factors associated
with adherence to recommended behaviours among members of the public.(17-20) We
worked with public health stakeholders to prepare a refined set of questions that could be
used in any future pandemic.(21) Since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, we have worked
with the English Department of Health and Social Care to develop and analyse a series of
weekly cross-sectional surveys tracking relevant behaviours and their potential predictors in
the UK public. In this paper, we report data from 21 of these surveys that tracked adherence
to the key components of the test, trace and isolate system over time, and investigate
variables associated with capability, opportunity and motivation that may be related to
adherence to self-isolation if symptomatic; requesting an antigen test if symptomatic; sharing
details of close contacts if symptomatic; and quarantining after being alerted that you have
been in close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case. We also investigated variables
associated with correctly identifying the symptoms of COVID-19. Identifying the key factors
that increase or decrease adherence can be used to inform policies to improve the functioning
of the system and help the UK control the outbreak.

METHOD
Design
A national series of cross-sectional surveys were conducted by BMG Research on behalf of
the Department of Health and Social Care, England since early in the COVID-19 outbreak
(data collection started on 28 January 2020). Surveys were conducted weekly until 1 July
(wave 23), after which survey waves were fortnightly. For this paper, we use data from
surveys conducted between 2 March 2020 (wave 6) and 5 August 2020 (wave 26). Data were
collected over a three-day period (Monday to Wednesday) for each survey wave, except for
wave 6 (collected over Monday to Thursday) and wave 12 (collected Tuesday to
Wednesday).

Participants
This study reports on 42,127 responses from 31,787 participants. Participants (n≈2,000 per
wave) were recruited from two specialist research panel providers, Respondi (n=50,000) and
Savanta (n=31,500). Participants in the first seven waves were recruited from Respondi only;
subsequent waves included approximately equal numbers from each panel. Participants were

eligible for the study if they were aged 16 years or over and lived in the UK. Participants
could be involved in more than one wave. If a respondent completed the survey, they were
then unable to participate in the following four waves. Due to an error, some people
completed waves more often; 133 people (0.4% of our sample) completed nine waves or
more. Quotas were applied based on age and gender (combined) and Government Office
Region, and reflected targets based on data from the Office for National Statistics.(22)
Participants were reimbursed in points which could be redeemed in cash, gift vouchers or
charitable donations (up to 70p).

Study materials
As the outbreak progressed, relevant questions were added to the survey, while questions
judged to be less of a priority were removed. Items were initially derived from a set of
questions developed in 2014 in preparation for a future influenza pandemic.(23) These items
were refined in 2014 in three rounds of qualitative interviews (n=78) and were assessed for
test-retest reliability in two telephone surveys (n=621).(21) Additional items were designed
to measure behaviours, attitudes, beliefs and consequences pertinent to the COVID-19
pandemic.
See supplementary materials for full items and response options, with a breakdown of which
questions were included in individual survey waves.

Outcome measures
Identification of COVID-19 symptoms: single question asking participants to identify the
most common symptoms of COVID-19; multiple response options were allowed (up to four
initially, up to five from wave 18). We coded participants as identifying symptoms of
COVID-19 if they selected cough, high temperature / fever and loss of sense of smell or taste.
Self-isolation: self-reported and intended behaviour. We measured self-reported self-isolation
in participants who indicated that they had experienced symptoms of COVID-19 (high
temperature / fever, cough, or loss or change of sense of smell or taste) in the last seven days.
Participants were asked what, if anything, had caused them to leave home since they
developed symptoms. We measured intended self-isolation in participants who had not
experienced COVID-19 symptoms in the last week. Participants were asked to imagine they
developed COVID-19 the next morning and were asked what would cause them to leave
home after developing symptoms, if anything.

Requesting an antigen test: self-reported and intended behaviour. Participants who reported
COVID-19 symptoms were asked what actions they had taken since developing symptoms.
Response options included “I requested a test to confirm whether I have coronavirus”.
Participants not reporting COVID-19 symptoms were asked what actions they would take if
they were to develop symptoms.
Sharing details of close contacts: Intended behaviour. Participants who had not experienced
COVID-19 symptoms in the last seven days were asked to imagine they had tested positive
for COVID-19 and had been “prompted by the NHS contact tracing service”. We asked
participants how likely they would be to share details of people they had been in close contact
with on a five-point scale from “definitely would” to “definitely would not”. We recoded
intention to share details of close contacts into a binary variable (probably or definitely would
share details vs not sure, probably or definitely would not). Too few participants in our
sample indicated that they had requested a test and tested positive (n=8) to be able to conduct
analyses on rates of actual self-reported behaviour.
Quarantining after being alerted: self-reported and intended behaviour. Participants who
indicated they had been alerted by a contact tracing service and told they had been in close
contact with a confirmed coronavirus case were asked for what reasons, if any, they had left
their home in the 14 days after having been contacted the most recent time they were
contacted. Participants who had not been alerted were asked what would cause them to leave
home after being alerted, if anything.

Worry and perceived risk: we asked participants how worried they were about COVID-19,
and to what extent they thought COVID-19 posed a risk to themselves and others in the UK.
Had COVID-19: participants were asked to state if they thought they “had, or currently have,
coronavirus”. Answers were recoded to give a binary variable indicating whether participants
thought they had ever had COVID-19.
Symptom attribution: participants who reported having experienced symptoms of COVID-19
in the last week were asked what they thought their symptoms were caused by.
Having enough information about COVID-19 and protective measures: participants were
asked to what extent they agreed they had enough information from the Government and
other public authorities about a range of topics including symptoms of coronavirus, selfisolation, antigen testing and contact tracing programmes.
Understanding of Government guidance: participants were asked a series of true / false
statements about what guidance states you should do if you develop COVID-19 symptoms.
Government guidance states that you should not leave home for any reason if you develop
symptoms of COVID-19.(3, 24) We coded participants as having incorrect knowledge if they
selected any reason for being permitted to leave home.

Knowledge of who was eligible for an antigen test: single item asking participants to select
the groups of people eligible for NHS testing if they developed symptoms. Since 18 May
2020, anyone in the UK can have a COVID-19 antigen test if they are symptomatic.(25) We
coded participants as having incorrect knowledge if they did not select that everyone who
was symptomatic was eligible to be tested.
Perceived credibility of the Government: adapted form of the Meyer Credibility Index
(Cronbach’s α=.64).(26)
Perceived effectiveness of behaviours and systems to prevent the spread of COVID-19: we
asked participants to what extent they agreed that an effective way to prevent the spread of
COVID-19 was to self-isolate, test people with symptoms and to have a contact tracing
programme.
Perceived self-efficacy: we asked participants to what extent they agreed that if they wanted
to they could self-isolate, book an antigen test online, go to a drive-through testing centre, get
a home-testing kit for coronavirus delivered, and return a completed home-testing kit for
coronavirus. The period of self-isolation for people with symptoms of COVID-19 was
extended from seven days to ten days on 30 July 2020.(27) This change was reflected in data
collected on 3 to 5 August (wave 26), but was not analysed here.
Beliefs about spreading COVID-19: we asked participants to what extent they agreed that
someone could spread coronavirus to other people even if they did not have symptoms yet,
that they were concerned about passing coronavirus on to someone who might be at risk, and
that their personal behaviour had an impact on how coronavirus spreads.
Financial hardship: participants were asked to what extent in the past seven days they had
been struggling to make ends meet, skipping meals they would usually have, and were
finding their current living situation difficult (Cronbach’s α=.74).

Personal and clinical characteristics
We asked participants to report their age, gender, employment status, socio-economic grade,
highest educational or professional qualification, ethnicity, how many people lived in their
household and their marital status. Participants also reported whether: there was a dependent
child in the household; they or a household member had a chronic illness; they worked in a
key sector; and whether they were self-employed. Participants were asked for their full
postcode, from which region and indices of multiple deprivation were determined.(28)

We created a quadratic term for age, to test for a non-linear relationship. We coded
participants as having a chronic illness that made them clinically vulnerable to COVID-19
using guidance from the NHS website.(29) Participants were categorised as working in a key
sector if they worked in health or social care; education and childcare; key public services;
local or national Government; food and essential goods; public safety and national security;
transport; or utilities, communication and financial services.(30)

Ethics
This work was conducted as part of service evaluation of the marketing and communications
run by the Department of Health and Social Care, and so did not require ethical approval.

Patient and public involvement
Lay members served on the advisory group for the project which developed our prototype
survey material; this included three rounds of qualitative testing.(21) Due to the rapid nature
of this research, the public was not involved in the further development of the survey
materials during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Power
A sample size of 2,000 allows a 95% confidence interval of plus or minus 2% for the
prevalence estimate for a survey item with a prevalence of around 50%.

Analysis
We used logistic regressions to investigate factors associated with: identifying cough, high
temperature / fever, and loss of sense of smell or taste (25 May to 5 August 2020); selfisolation (14 April to 5 August 2020); requesting an antigen test (25 May to 5 August 2020);
intention to share details of close contacts if tested positive for COVID-19 (1 June to 5
August 2020); and quarantining after being alerted (8 June to 5 August 2020). Although
anosmia was added as a symptom of COVID-19 on 18 May 2020,(31) we did not include
data collected 18 to 20 May 2020 in these analyses as the announcement happened after data
collection had already started.
For each set of analyses, we ran univariable analyses and multivariable analyses.
Multivariable regressions investigating factors associated with identification of COVID-19
symptoms, self-isolation and intention to share details of close contacts if tested positive for
COVID-19 adjusted for survey wave, region, gender, age (raw and quadratic term), presence
of dependent child in the household, being clinically vulnerable to COVID-19, having a

household member with a chronic illness, employment status (working vs not working),
socio-economic grade (ABC1 vs C2DE), index of multiple deprivation (quartiles), highest
educational or professional qualification (degree or higher vs less than degree), ethnicity
(coded into six categories), and living alone. Due to small numbers of cases, for analyses
investigating factors associated with requesting an antigen test and quarantining after being
alerted, it was not advisable to carry out a multivariable regression analysis with a large
number of independent variables.(32) Thus, we controlled only for the three factors most
strongly associated with the respective outcome in univariable analyses.
Logistic regression analyses were carried out using data from waves starting 14 April to 5
August. 19,441 participants answered just one survey during this period, but 3459
participants (15%) answered more than one survey during this period. Most analyses were
conducted on data collected from May or June, therefore the proportion of respondents who
answered more than one survey is smaller. Logistic regression analyses treated all responses
as independent and did not correct for some participants being in more than one wave. As a
sensitivity analysis, we fitted matching generalised estimating equations (GEEs) for some
analyses, which adjust for multiple responses. These showed minimal differences in the fitted
odds ratios to the logistic regressions.

Sensitivity analyses
Due to the large number of analyses conducted on each outcome variable (n≈60), we focus
our interpretation on those that remained statistically significant after a Bonferroni correction
(p≤.001).

RESULTS
As patterns of results were similar for all outcomes, we narratively report factors associated
with outcomes at the end of the results section. Full reporting of associations (unadjusted and
adjusted) can be found in Tables 2 to 11.

Identification of COVID-19 symptoms
Only 48.9% of participants (95% CI 48.2% to 49.7%) identified cough, high temperature /
fever and loss of sense of smell or taste as symptoms of COVID-19. This percentage has
remained relatively stable over time. There were initial increases at the start of data collection

The factors most strongly associated with not identifying COVID-19 symptoms were: male
gender; younger age; not identifying as White British; thinking you have had COVID-19; and
not knowing that you can spread COVID-19 to others if you are asymptomatic (see Tables 2
and 3).

Self-isolation
Of those who reported having experienced symptoms of COVID-19 in the last seven days,
only 18.2% (95% CI 16.4 to 19.9) said they had not left home since developing symptoms.
The percentage of people reporting self-isolating has been largely stable over time (see
Figure 2). Intention to self-isolate if you were to develop symptoms of COVID-19 is much
higher (around 70%), and has shown a slight decrease over time.

Figure 2. Percentage of people who reported not leaving home at all since developing
COVID-19 symptoms (in those who had experienced COVID-19 symptoms in the last seven
days), and who reported intending not to leave home at all if they were to develop COVID-19
symptoms (in people who had not had COVID-19 symptoms in the last seven days). Error
bars are 95% confidence intervals.
The factors most strongly associated with non-adherence to self-isolation were: not knowing
Government guidance about what to do if you developed COVID-19 symptoms; not
identifying COVID-19 symptoms; thinking you have had COVID-19; having a dependent
child in the household; and working in a key sector (see Tables 4 and 5). Self-reported
reasons for not self-isolating are presented in the supplementary materials. The most common
reasons were: to go to the shops for groceries/pharmacy (18.2%); because one’s symptoms
got better (15.6%); and to go out for a medical need other than COVID-19 (14.9%).

Requesting an antigen test
Of those who reported experiencing COVID-19 symptoms in the last seven days, only 11.9%
(95% CI 10.1% to 13.8%) reported requesting an antigen test. While intention to request a
test has increased over time, self-reported behaviour has remained relatively stable (see
Figure 3).

Figure 3. Percentage of people who reported requesting an antigen test after developing
COVID-19 symptoms (in those who had experienced COVID-19 symptoms in the last seven
days), and who reported intending to request an antigen test if they were to develop COVID19 symptoms (in people who had not had COVID-19 symptoms in the last seven days). Error
bars are 95% confidence intervals.
The only factor strongly associated with not requesting an antigen test was lower confidence
that you could return a completed home-testing kit for COVID-19 by courier (see Tables 5
and 6). Common reasons for not requesting an antigen test included: not thinking that
symptoms were due to COVID-19 (20.0%); because symptoms improved (16.1%); and
because symptoms were only mild (16.0%; see supplementary materials).

Sharing details of close contact
Of those who had not experienced COVID-19 symptoms in the last seven days, 76.1% (95%
CI 75.4% to 76.8%) reported that they probably or definitely would share details of their
close contacts with the NHS contact tracing service if they tested positive for coronavirus,
and were prompted by the NHS contact tracing service (see Figure 4).

Data collection

Figure 4. Percentage of people who reported that they probably or definitely would share
details of their close contacts if contacted by the NHS contact tracing service (in people who
had not had COVID-19 symptoms in the last seven days). Error bars are 95% confidence
intervals.
Key factors associated with not intending to share details of close contacts if you test positive
for COVID-19 were: not believing that contact tracing systems were effective at preventing
the spread of COVID-19; not knowing that you can spread COVID-19 to others if you are
asymptomatic; being concerned about spreading COVID-19 to someone who may be at risk;
and thinking that your personal behaviour has an impact on how COVID-19 spreads (see
Tables 8 and 9). The most common reasons for not intending to share details of your close
contacts were: not knowing if data would be secure and confidential (18.8%); not knowing
what would happen to the data (17.2%); and thinking that the contact tracing system was not
accurate and reliable (14.2%; see supplementary materials).

Quarantining after being alerted
Of those who reported having been alerted by the NHS contact tracing service and told they
had been in close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case (n=405), 10.9% (95% CI 7.8% to
13.9%) reported that they had not left home at all in the following 14 days. This figure has
remained relatively stable; intention to quarantine is much higher, at around 65% (see Figure
5).

they had been in contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case by the NHS contact tracing

COVID-19 case by the NHS contact tracing service (in people who had never been alerted).
Errors bars are 95% confidence intervals.
The only factor strongly associated with non-adherence to quarantine was having a dependent
child in the household (see Tables 10 and 11). Key reasons given for not quarantining
included: not thinking it was necessary to stay away from people outside your household as
you could not stay away from people in your household (14.3%); not developing symptoms
(11.9%); to go to the shops for groceries/pharmacy (10.9%); and having just finished
quarantining because you had been in contact with a different confirmed COVID-19 case
(10.9%; see supplementary materials).

Factors associated with multiple outcomes
Patterns of results were similar for all outcomes. Lower adherence was associated with being
male, younger age, having a dependent child in the household, lower socio-economic grade,
greater hardship, and being less informed about COVID-19 and guidance to prevent the
spread of the virus (e.g. not being able to identify key symptoms of COVID-19, not knowing
government guidance if you were to develop symptoms of COVID-19, and disagreeing that
someone can spread COVID-19 even if they are asymptomatic).

DISCUSSION
As in other countries, the test, trace and isolate system is the cornerstone of the UK’s public
health strategy for coping with the COVID-19 pandemic.(1) Its success relies on adherence to
multiple behaviours at multiple stages.(6) Our data suggest that self-reported rates of
adherence to isolating, testing and quarantining are currently low, as are rates of recognition
of the main symptoms of COVID-19 (see Figure 6). Rates of intended behaviour are much
higher than rates of self-reported behaviour. This is unsurprising.(33) The percentage of
people who share details of close contacts after receiving a positive COVID-19 antigen test is
therefore likely much lower than the percentage of intended sharing of contacts reported here.
Our observed rates of adherence were largely stable over time with the notable exceptions of
symptom recognition, where recognition of ‘new’ symptoms increased over the first one or
two weeks after they were introduced, and intended (but not actual) requests for an antigen
test, which have been steadily increasing. These findings are in line with other research
finding low rates of symptom identification and low adherence to self-isolation in the UK.(8,
9, 16) Our estimate of the percentage of people requesting a test (11.9%) is lower than the
estimate that can be derived by dividing the number of cases per day identified in the
community by NHS Test and Trace (34) by the estimated daily incidence recorded by the
Office of National Statistics (35) (35% for 6-13 August). This discrepancy might be
accounted for by different sample biases, the probable inclusion of people in our sample with
an obvious, non-COVID explanation for their symptoms, and the probable inclusion of
asymptomatic cases in the NHS Test and Trace data.
Stability of the outcomes indicates that changes to messaging between March and early
August have had little effect on behaviours relevant to test, trace and isolate. This suggests
either that the changes introduced so far have been ineffective, the budget allocated to
messaging about the test, trace and isolate system has been insufficient to allow changes to

have an impact, or that the factors preventing people from engaging with behaviours are not
amenable to messaging alone.
Our results suggest that financial constraints and caring responsibilities impeded adherence to
self-isolation, intending to share details of close contacts, and quarantining of contacts. The
disproportionate impact of the pandemic on people from lower socio-economic backgrounds
and with caring responsibilities has been well-documented.(36, 37) Previous research has
shown that people who have received help from others outside their household because of
COVID-19 were more likely to adhere to self-isolation.(9) To encourage adherence, policies
must ensure that people are adequately reimbursed for any potential losses that may arise
from needing to self-isolate and facilitate practical considerations, such as shopping for
groceries and medicines during self-isolation.
In terms of capability,(7) it appears that higher knowledge in general was associated with
greater uptake of protective behaviours. It is impossible to disentangle causality here. People
who are better informed may simply be more engaged generally in attempting to understand
and tackle the pandemic, with the latter promoting adherence. Nevertheless, disseminating
clear and easily understood information about the virus and how it spreads is likely to
increase adherence to protective behaviours, especially where understanding is low.
Motivational factors, such as perceiving measures to be effective and being confident about
returning a testing kit, were associated with intending to share details of close contacts and
requesting a test respectively. This is in line with research findings from the H1N1 influenza
pandemic.(14) Making antigen testing as easy as possible, for example by introducing local
testing sites in areas with high infection rates,(38) may increase adherence to testing.
Messaging that highlights the effectiveness of adhering to each stage of the test, trace and
isolate system, and that emphasises that adhering is straightforward and easy to do may
further improve adherence.
With regard to demographic differences, men and younger people were less likely to adhere
to steps along the test, trace and isolate pathway. Similar findings emerged during the H1N1
pandemic.(14) Gender and age differences in adherence may be caused by differences such as
poorer health literacy in men and a greater desire to be active and to have contact with peer
groups amongst younger age groups.(39) Working in a key sector was associated with not
self-isolating. This may be because key workers have a greater financial need or feel a greater
social pressure to attend work and are less likely to be able to work from home.(40) Key
workers and people from minority ethnic backgrounds were less likely to identify common

symptoms of COVID-19. Targeted communications to these groups may help improve
adherence and increase knowledge of common symptoms of COVID-19.
We found no evidence for associations between perceived risk to oneself or to people in the
UK and adherence to test, trace and isolate behaviours. We also found no evidence for an
association between self-isolation and concern about spreading the virus to those at risk of
complications, thinking that your personal behaviour has an impact on the spread of COVID19, or perceived effectiveness of self-isolation. However, these factors were associated with
intention to share details of close contacts. Taken together, these findings suggest either that
concern about the risk of giving COVID-19 to others increases intention to adhere to
protective behaviours but not actual behaviour, or that such concerns are mainly important
where any inconvenience associated with the behaviour is imposed on someone else (as is the
case of quarantine) rather than on you (as is the case in self-isolation).
We found an association between perceiving information from the Government to be more
credible and being less likely to self-isolate and to identify COVID-19 symptoms. It may be
that this association is confounded by, for example, the political orientation of participants.
Strengths of this study include large sample sizes allowing us to investigate infrequent
behaviours. Inclusion of survey items in multiple waves of data collection has enabled us to
track uptake of protective behaviours and knowledge over time. This study also has
limitations. First, we used quota sampling to ensure that participant characteristics were
representative of the UK adult population. While we cannot be sure that survey respondents
are representative of the general population,(41, 42) online quota sampling is a pragmatic
approach when a large, demographically representative sample must be obtained in a very
short time frame during a crisis.(14, 43) Second, data were self-reported, and so could have
been influenced by social desirability and recall gaps and bias. Although self-reported
adherence to protective measures for COVID-19 such as social distancing is associated with
real-world behaviour,(44) it is likely that rates reported here are overestimates of adherence.
Third, data are cross-sectional, therefore we cannot infer causality. Fourth, although we asked
participants if they had left home at all since developing COVID-19 symptoms, technically it
is permissible to leave home under some circumstances, including to attend a medical
appointment, get a test or if you receive a negative test result. Given that only 12% of people
with symptoms reported requesting a test, we do not believe this explanation accounts for
more than a small fraction of the non-adherence that we observed. Fifth, while we had a large
overall sample size, numbers of participants included in analyses investigating requesting an

antigen test and quarantining after being alerted were smaller, and skewed outcome responses
resulted in small cell counts. We have presented these analyses for completeness, but these
results should be treated with caution.
In order for the test, trace and isolate system in the UK to succeed, people must recognise the
key symptoms of COVID-19, self-isolate, request a test, share details of their close contacts
and quarantine if contacted. Our results indicate that approximately half of people know the
symptoms of COVID-19, and that adherence to each stage of the test, trace and isolate
journey is low. Policies which support people financially and practically, and providing and
communicating about a testing system that is both effective and easy to access, will be key to
increasing uptake. Targeted communications especially to men, younger age groups and key
workers are likely to further increase uptake.
