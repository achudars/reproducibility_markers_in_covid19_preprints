Abstract
Background. India has recorded 66,333 deaths over 36 administrative regions placing India
third in the world after the US and Brazil for COVID-19 deaths as of 2 September 2020.
Studies indicate that south-west monsoon season plays a role in the dynamics of contagious
diseases, which tend to peak post-monsoon season. Recent studies show that vitamin D and its
primary source Ultraviolet-B radiation (UVB) may play a protective role in mitigating
COVID-19 deaths. However, the combined roles of the monsoon season and UVB in
COVID-19 in India are still unclear. In this observational study, we empirically study the
respective roles of monsoon season and UVB, whilst further exploring, whether monsoon
season negatively impacts the protective role of UVB in COVID-19 deaths in India.
Methods. We use a log-linear Mundlak model to a panel dataset of 36 administrative regions
in India from 14 March 2020 - 8 August 2020 (n=4005). We use the cumulative COVID-19
deaths as the dependent variable. We isolate the association of monsoon season and UVB as
measured by Ultraviolet Index (UVI) from other confounding time-constant and time-varying
region-specific factors.
Findings. After controlling for various confounding factors, we observe that the monsoon
season and a unit increase in UVI are separately associated with 12.8 percentage points and
2.0 percentage points decline in growth rates of COVID-19 deaths in the long run. These
associations translate into substantial relative changes. For example, the current monsoon
season, that has been going on for two weeks, is associated with a reduction in growth rates of
COVID-19 deaths of 59%, whereas a permanent unit increase of UVI is associated with a
reduction in growth rates of COVID-19 deaths of 37%. However, the current monsoon
season, also reduces the protective role of UVI by 16.3% [0.33 percentage points], plausibly
due to lower UVB exposure.

Interpretation. We find independent protective roles of both the monsoon season and UVI in
mitigating COVID-19 deaths. Furthermore, we find evidence that monsoon season is
associated with a significant reduction in the protective role of UVI. The protective role of
monsoon season is plausibly due to limited outdoor activities of people. Our study outlines
the role of the monsoon season and UVB in COVID-19 in India and supports health-related
policy decision making in India.

1 Introduction
COVID-19 has caused unparalleled economic and health disruptions in India, the second
most populated country with over 1.3 billion people. As of September 2, India has reported
66,333 COVID-19 deaths across 36 administrative regions, placing India third in the world
behind the US and Brazil1.
Recent observational and clinical studies show that vitamin D deficiency might be linked
to incidence2,3, severity4 5and mortality6–8 associated with COVID-19. Recent studies show
that vitamin D and its primary source Ultraviolet-B radiation (UVB) may play a protective
role in mitigating COVID-19 deaths9,10. Studies indicate that south-west monsoon season
(monsoon season) plays a role in the dynamics of contagious diseases, which tend to peak
post-monsoon season 11. The respective roles of the monsoon season and UVB in COVID-19
in India are still unclear. We anticipate a sudden increase in contagious diseases during and
post monsoon season, which will stress India’s healthcare system12,13. Limited hours of
sunlight and dense cloud cover14 limit the intensity of UVB radiation, mitigating its protective
role9 during the monsoon season. Even though limited outdoor activities during the monsoon
season may decrease the likelihood of transmission; we anticipate that it may also lead to a
lower likelihood of UVB exposure, further mitigating its protective role. To the best of our
knowledge, so far, no empirical study has explored the roles of the monsoon season and UVB
in COVID-19 in India, specifically studying the association between monsoon season, the
subsequent reduced exposure likelihood of UVB radiation and COVID-19 deaths in India.
In this observational study, we empirically describe the roles of the monsoon season and
further explore, whether monsoon season result in a reduction in the protective role of UVB in
COVID-19 deaths in India. After controlling for various confounding factors, we observe that
in the long run the monsoon season and a unit increase in UVI are separately associated with
12.8 percentage points [p<0.05] and 2.0 percentage points [p<0.05] decline in COVID-19

deaths growth rate. On the other hand, in the long run the monsoon season reduces the
protective role of UVI by 1.3 percentage points [p<0.05], plausibly due to lower UVB
exposure. Consequently, it is expected that although the monsoon season is helping mitigate
the transmission of Covid-19, it is doing so at the cost of UVB exposure.

2 Impact of Monsoon on Healthcare System, UVB
Radiation & COVID-19 Deaths in India
Studies indicate that the monsoon season and post-monsoon season may be associated
with the peaks of contagious diseases like influenza, i.e., July-September11,15,16. Heavy rainfall
linked to monsoon season may create situations favourable for the outbreaks of infectious
diseases such as diarrheal disease, cholera, dengue, typhoid as well as respiratory diseases17.
Furthermore, the temporal overlap between these contagious diseases and COVID-19 may
give rise to significant health care challenges12. The consequences of possible coinfection
with these infectious diseases and SARS-CoV-2 are largely unknown12,13. Moreover, we
anticipate this sudden increase in contagious diseases during monsoon season to create stress
in the healthcare system, further restricting the hospital capacity required for COVID-19
patients12,13. Heavy precipitation may also cause disruptions in traffic, limiting the
transportation possibilities of COVID-19 patients13. On the other hand, the monsoon season
also plays a protective role due to restricted mobility18 as people are more likely to stay
indoors, reducing the possibility of the transmission of the virus. In general, the impact of the
monsoon season on COVID-19 in India remains largely unknown.
In addition to the above consequences in the healthcare system, another important
consequence of the monsoon season is the higher precipitation and the reduced likelihood of
UVB exposure and subsequently lower vitamin D levels19. Studies indicate that UV radiation
inactivates viruses in fomite transmission20. UVB also plays another protective role via its
role in vitamin D skin synthesis21–25, as dietary intake (natural food, fortified food or

supplements) are usually insufficient26. Even in a country like India with plenty of sunshine,
vitamin D deficiency is common due to reduced skin exposure and specific dietary habits
such as vegetarianism27. UVB Radiation and the likelihood of skin exposure & skin synthesis
vary substantially depending on several factors such as seasons26, time26, latitude26, altitude26,
active lifestyle28,29, dietary habits30,26, food fortification26, age26 and skin colour26. Prior
studies indicate that most of Indians (Location : 8.40N and 37.60N31) belong to skin type
V31and the time required for recommended vitamin D synthesis for skin type V is 10-15
minutes at solar noon at 11.50N throughout the year31. However, this period increases to 1045 minutes with more duration in winter season at 290N.
Early studies show a protective role of UVB and vitamin D in COVID-199,10,2,3,8. 1,25dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25 (OH)2D], an active form of vitamin D, plays a critical role in the
modulation of innate as well as adaptive immune systems32,33, renin-angiotensin system
(RAS)33–35 as well as in the modulation of the inflammatory response, reducing cytokine
storm risk 32,33. It also stimulates antimicrobial peptides such as defensins and human
cathelicidin32,33,36,37 with antiviral properties. Recent studies related to COVID-19 also
indicate that vitamin D deficiency might be a risk factor not only for incidence2,3, but also for
severity4 5and mortality6–8 associated with COVID-19.
In light of this emerging evidence regarding vitamin D and COVID-19, we aim to explore
the role of monsoon season as well as how it potentially decreases the protective role of UVB
in reducing COVID-19 deaths by reducing the likelihood of exposure to UVB radiation.
Specifically, we anticipate that the likelihood of UVB radiation exposure undergoes
substantial variation during monsoon season primarily due to lower sunshine hours, thick
cloud cover and limited outdoor activities. Although monsoon season is likely to reduce the
transmission likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 virus due to reduced mobility & outdoor activities18,
it also reduces exposure likelihood, increasing the potential vitamin D deficiency9,10 among

the population. Lower vitamin D levels due to reduced exposure to UVB radiation during
monsoon season may lead to lower immunity leading to increased mortality rate9,26.
Therefore, we anticipate that even though UVB plays a protective role in COVID-19 in India,
monsoon season reduces this protective role by reducing the likelihood of exposure.
Studies show that other weather factors such as humidity38, temperature39 and
precipitation39,40 play a role in viral transmission (e.g., influenza). Recent studies also indicate
that temperature and humidity may play a role in COVID-19 transmission40,41. Therefore, we
control for most of these confounding weather factors to explore the role of monsoon season
as well as how it potentially decreases the protective role of UVB in reducing COVID-19
deaths.

3 Methods
3.1 Description of Data
In order to identify the relation of monsoon season, UVI and their interaction with
COVID-19 deaths, we constructed the dataset outlined in Table 1. We collected COVID-19
data across 36 administrative regions (28 states and 8 union territories) of India covering 148
days from 14 March 2020 until 8 August 2020. 34 of these administrative regions reported
more than 20 COVID-19 infections on 8 August 2020. We focus on those 34 administrative
regions to ensure that the results are not biased by those administrative regions that are at a
very early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak, which would limit data points concerning
COVID-19 deaths. Furthermore, we drop the first 20 daily observations of every
administrative region after the reporting of the first COVID-19 infection in respective regions.
Thus, we ensure that these observations at the very early stage of the outbreak do not bias the
results.

The corresponding data consist of the cumulative daily number of COVID-19 deaths at an
administrative region level. They also consist of the time of arrival of monsoon season for
each administrative region, the daily ultraviolet index (UVI), an indicator of daily UVB
radiation, as well as a set of daily weather parameters. We use these weather parameters as
control variables, and these parameters include cloud index, ozone level, visibility level,
humidity level, minimum and maximum temperature. We source COVID-19 data from
COVID19India.org and the weather data from darksky.net based on the latitude and longitude
information of countries that are provided by Geocoder, a geocoding library in Python.

We use a Mundlak error correction model to estimate the association of monsoon season,
UVI and their interaction with COVID-19 deaths. We include 56 days moving average of the
monsoon season dummy variables, which indicate whether the monsoon season has been
active in a region on a specific day. We also use 56 days moving averages of the UVI Index

as well as of the interaction of monsoon season dummy variables and UVI Index for a region
on a specific day.
Our model aims to isolate all weather parameters from region-specific time-constant
factors. The Mundlak model combines the robustness of a fixed-effects model and the
efficiency of a random-effects model. Instead of demeaning the structural model to isolate the
weather parameters analytically from such region-specific time-constant factors, it models
those region-specific time-constant factors through the available weather parameters. We
describe our methodology and how to interpret the estimated associations in more detail in
Supplementary Material section 1 and section 2.

4 Results
Table 3 outlines our main results. We find substantial and significant associations of
monsoon season, UVI and their interaction with COVID-19 deaths. Monsoon season is
associated with a drop of 12.8 percentage points [p<0.05] in daily growth rates of COVID-19
deaths in the long run. A permanent unit increase of UVI is associated with a decline of 2
percentage points [p<0.05] in daily growth rates of COVID-19 deaths. However, monsoon
season mitigates the association of UVI by 1.3 percentage points [p<0.05] and thus alleviates
the protective role of UVI.
These associations of monsoon season with COVID-18 deaths translate into substantial
relative changes in growth rates of COVID-19 deaths. Within two weeks of the arrival,
monsoon season is associated with a reduction of COVID-19 growth rates of 59% (=
14

−0.128 ∙ 56 /0.054) relative to the average daily growth rates of COVID-19 deaths. A
permanent unit increase of UVI is associated with a decline in COVID-19 growth rates of
37% (= −0.02/0.054) as relative to the average daily growth rates of COVID-19 deaths.
However, after two weeks monsoon season reduces the protective role of UVI by 16.3% (=

that our estimations are consistent when using more flexible time trends as well as to the
impact of governmental measures on the behaviour of individuals.

Our empirical results outline that monsoon season and UVB are independently associated
with a decline in the daily COVID-19 death growth rate in India, thereby indicating their

respective protective roles. However, monsoon season also significantly decreases the
protective role of UVB radiation. Specifically, we find that monsoon season and a unit
increase in UVI are separately associated with -12.8 percentage points, and -2.0 percentage
points decline in COVID-19 daily deaths growth rate in India in the long run. In the long run,
Indian monsoon season further reduces the protective role of UVI by 1.3 percentage points,
potentially due to lower UVB exposure as a result of decreased outdoor activities. We find
these results to be consistent across different model specifications.
We control for all time-constant and region-specific factors and different time-varying
confounding factors, especially weather9,10. We may not be able to exclude other time-varying
factors, which might bias our results9,10. Further, we may not be able to exclude other
protective roles of UVB – for example via other mediators –nitric oxide9,10, cis-urocanic
acid21,42,43 or via inactivation of viruses in fomite transmission20. Sensible sunlight exposure9
is crucial as disproportionate solar UV exposure leads to health hazards such as aging44,
wrinkles44, sunburn26 and DNA damage44. Specifically, disproportionate UVB exposure is
associated with basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma45.
We also acknowledge that the results of our study cannot serve as health guidance for
India. However, we hope our results prompt further clinical research in India specifically to
establish the role of sensible sunlight exposure or vitamin D in mitigating COVID-19 deaths
during monsoon season. Establishing the effectiveness of sensible solar UVB exposure or
vitamin D supplementation could substantially advance the control of COVID-19 pandemic at
scale in India. The results of these clinical studies can further guide policy decision making in
India, especially during monsoon season. This type of policy intervention would be desirable
for India not only due to its lower risk and costs, but also due to its scalability across India’s
1.3 billion people whose economic means vary significantly.
