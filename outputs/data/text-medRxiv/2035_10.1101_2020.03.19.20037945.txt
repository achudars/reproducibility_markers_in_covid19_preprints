Abstract
Background: To control COVID-19 outbreak in Japan, sports and entertainment events
were canceled in Japan for two weeks from 26 February to 13 March. It has been
designated as voluntary event cancellation (VEC).
Object: This study predicts the effectiveness of VEC enduring and after its
implementation.
Method: We applied a simple susceptible–infected–recovery model to data of patients
with symptoms in Japan during 14 January to VEC introduction and after VEC
introduction to 8 March. We adjusted the reporting delay in the latest few days.
Results: Results suggest that the basic reproduction number, R0, before VEC introduced
as 2.29 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was [2.19, 2.37] and the effective
reproduction number, Rv, after VEC introduced as 1. 99; its 95% CI was [1.71,2.23].
Discussion and Conclusion: No significant effect of VEC was observed.

Introduction

The initial case of COVID-19 in Japan was that of a patient returning from Wuhan,
China who showed symptoms on 3 January, 2020. Subsequently, as of 13 March, 2020,
714 cases were announced, including asymptomatic or those infected at abroad in
countries such as China but excluding or those infected on a large cruise ship, the
Diamond Princess [1].
Sports and entertainment events were canceled in Japan for two weeks from 26
February to 13 March according to a government advisory. At the same time, it was
advised that small business and private meetings be cancelled voluntarily. The policy is
designated as voluntary event cancellation (VEC). Moreover, since 3 March, almost all
schools have been closed to control the spread until early April. Although
schoolchildren are not of pestiferous age, the policy effects remain unknown. These
policies must be evaluated as soon as possible. If the effective reproduction number, Rv
under these measures is less than one, the outbreak can be contained. Alternatively,
even given a low R0 before these measures, if it was greater than one, it might prolong
the outbreak. Nevertheless, one could expect to prevent some fatal cases over time by
easing burdens on medical resources or developing a vaccine. The entire course of the
outbreak might be altered if these measures were able to reduce infectiousness

considerably. Therefore, evaluation of these measures must be thorough when these
measures are commenced, continued, and ceased. The present study was conducted to
evaluate VEC before VEC is cancelled so as to contribute government’s decision
making whether VEC will be continued or ceased.

Method
We applied a simple susceptible–infected–recovery (SIR) model [2] to the data
assuming an incubation period following its empirical distribution in the early stage of
the outbreak in Japan. Experiences of Japanese people living in Wuhan until the
outbreak provide information related to mild cases because complete laboratory
surveillance was administered for them. During January 29 – February 17, 2020, 829
Japanese people returned to Japan from Wuhan. All had received a test to detect
COVID-19; of them, 14 were found to be positive for COVID-19 [3]. Of those 14, 10
Japanese people had exhibited mild symptoms; the other 4 showed no symptom as of
February 25. Moreover, two Japanese residents of Wuhan exhibited severe symptoms:
one was confirmed as COVID-19. The other died, although no fatal case was confirmed
as COVID-19 by testing. In addition, two Japanese residents of Wuhan with mild
symptoms were refused re-entry to Japan even though they had not been confirmed as

infected. If one assumes that the Japanese fatal case in Wuhan and that the two rejected
re-entrants were infected with COVID-19, then 2 severe cases, 12 mild cases, and 4
asymptomatic cases were found to exist among these Japanese residents of Wuhan. We
therefore apply these proportions to the simulation.
Assuming that the power of infectivity among severe patients and mild patients
were equal among the asymptomatic cases, half of the symptomatic cases can be
assumed. This assumption about relative infectiousness among asymptomatic cases
compared with symptomatic cases was also assumed in simulation studies for influenza
[4–8]. We sought R0 to fit the number of patients during 14 January – 28 February and
to minimize the sum of absolute values of discrepancies among the reported numbers
and the fitted values. Its 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated using the 10000
iterations of bootstrapping for empirical distribution.
We used data of the community outbreak of patients with COVID-19 who showed
any symptom in Japan for 14 January – 13 March, 2020. We excluded some patients
who had returned from China, and who were presumed to be infected persons from the
Diamond Princess. They were presumed to be not community-acquired in Japan. During
this period, 544 cases with onset dates occurred.
Published information about COVID-19 patients with symptoms from the Ministry

of Labour, Health and Welfare (MLHW), Japan was usually adversely affected with
some delay caused by uncertainty during onset to visiting a doctor or in the timing of a
physician’s suspicion of COVID-19. Therefore, published data of patients must be
adjust at least a few days. To adjust it, we applied the following regression. We denote
Xt-k|t as the number of patients whose onset date was t-k published on day t. The
dependent variables are the degree of reporting delay, Xt-k-m|t / Xt-k-m|t-m, where k>m
in several m and k. Here, m denotes the difference of the publishing dates between the
two published. Date t represents the publishing date of the latest publishing. The
explanatory variables were 1/k, 1/m, and 1/km. The degree of reporting delay was
estimated as [estimated coefficient of constant term] + [estimated coefficient of 1/k]/k,
when m was sufficiently large and time had passed. Therefore, this estimated degree of
reporting delay multiplied by the latest published data are expected to be predictions of
the number of patients whose onset date was t-k. We used this adjusted number of
patients in the latest few days including those after VEC was adopted. We used the
published data on 2,5,6, and 9-14 March,2020 by MLHW[1].
First, we estimated R0 in Japan to fit the data of community outbreak before VEC
was introduced. Then, using the adjusted data of patients, we estimated Rv after VEC
was adopted. We discussed about Rv/R0 through its distribution. We used 5% as

significant level.

Ethical consideration
All information used in the present study were published and thus there was no
ethical issue.

Results
During 14 January – 13 March in Japan, 640 community-acquired cases were
identified for whom the onset date was published. Figure 1 showed the empirical
distribution of incubation period among 62 cases whose exposed date and onset date
were published by MHLW. Its mode and median were six days and average was 6.74
days.
Figure 2 depicts the epidemic curves published at 3, 5, 6, 9 and 10 March. From
this information, we estimated the degree of reporting delay. Those results are presented
in Table 1. The table shows that 1/k, 1/m and 1/km are all significant. When m is
sufficiently large, the effects of 1/m and 1/km converge to zero. Therefore, the estimated
degree of reporting delay consists of the term of 1/k and a constant term. Based on these
results, we predict the degrees of reporting delay as 19.3 for k=1, 9.64 for k=2, 6.42 for

k=3, and so on.
The value of R0 before VEC introduced was estimated as 2.29 with a 95%CI was
[2.19, 2.37] and Rv, after VEC introduced as 2.03 and its 95% CI was [1.72, 2.32]. The
average and median of Rv/R0 were 0.88 and its 95% CI was [0.79, 1.05].

Discussion
We applied a simple SIR model including asymptomatic cases that had not been
incorporated into the model to date. An earlier study [9] estimated R0 for COVID-19 as
2.24–3.58 in Wuhan. Our R0 obtained before VEC was similar.
Unfortunately, effectiveness of VEC was not observed even though itreduced
infectiousness by 13% in average. .

Conclusion
Results demonstrated that VEC can reduce infectiousness of COVID-19 by 13%,
but not significant. However, we have to note that the obtained results were just a
preliminary evaluation, and thus it is not a conclusive evaluation. VEC had been
extended until March 19 on March 10. We hope that the present study contribute
