ABSTRACT
Underreporting of COVID-19 cases and deaths is a hindrance to correctly modeling and
monitoring the pandemic. This is primarily due to limited testing, lack of reporting infrastructure
and a large number of asymptomatic infections. In addition, diagnostic tests (RT-PCR tests for
detecting current infection) and serological antibody tests for IgG (to assess past infections) are
imperfect. In particular, the diagnostic tests have a high false negative rate. Epidemiologic models
with a latent compartment for unascertained infections like the Susceptible-Exposed-InfectedRemoved (SEIR) models can provide predictions for unreported cases and deaths under certain
assumptions. Typically, the number of unascertained cases is unobserved and thus we cannot
validate these estimates for a real study except for simulation studies. Population-based
seroprevalence studies can provide a rough estimate of the total number of infections and help us
check epidemiologic model projections. In this paper, we develop a method to account for high
false negative rates in RT-PCR in an extension to the classic SEIR model. We apply this method
to Delhi, the national capital region of India, with a population of 19.8 million and a COVID-19
hotspot of the country, obtaining estimates of underreporting factor for cases at 34-53 times and
that for deaths at 8-13 times. Based on a recently released serological survey for Delhi with an
estimated 22.86% seroprevalence, we compute adjusted estimates of the true number of infections
reported by the survey (after accounting for misclassification of the antibody test results) which is
largely consistent with the model outputs, yielding an underreporting factor for cases from 30-42.
Together with the model and the serosurvey, this implies approximately 96-98% cases in Delhi
remained unreported and whereas only 109,140 cases were reported on July 10, the true number
of infections varied somewhere between 4.4-4.6 million across different estimates. While repeated
serological monitoring is resource intensive, model-based adjustments, run with the most up to
date data, can provide a viable option to keep track of the unreported cases and deaths and gauge
the true extent of transmission of this insidious virus.
INTRODUCTION
COVID-19 was first diagnosed in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and was quickly declared a
pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 111. The first case in India was declared on
January 30, and as of July 28, there have been 1,531,783 cases and 34,224 deaths reported2. India
responded quickly, instituting a nationwide lockdown on March 25, when there were only 657
cases and 11 deaths2-3. However, given the high rate of asymptomatic individuals and limited and
imperfect diagnostic testing, it is unclear how many people have actually been infected.
Classical epidemiologic models, like a susceptible – exposed – infected – removed (SEIR)
compartmental model, have been used to predict the growth of the COVID-19 pandemic. For
example, a modification of the standard SEIR model – which accounts for pre-symptomatic
infectiousness, time-varying ascertainment rates, transmission rates and population movements –
applied on data from Wuhan, China, identified that the outbreak had high covertness and high
transmissibility4. They estimated that 87% (with a lower bound of 53%) of the infections in Wuhan
before March 8 were unascertained4. However, traditional models, including the one used in this
paper, do not take into account the underreporting and potential misclassification via imperfect
testing.

In the context of identification of cases, there are two classes of tests that are being discussed in
the literature: diagnostic tests and antibody tests. A diagnostic test (typically an RT-PCR test) is
used to identify the presence of SARS-CoV-2, indicating an active infection5. An antibody test,
i.e., a serology test, looks for the presence of antibodies, the body’s immune response to fight off
SARS-CoV-2, indicating a past infection6. Figure 1 exhibits a timeline in terms of when these tests
are done during the time course of an infection. Due to a large number of asymptomatic cases and
limited number of tests, many infections do not get detected. Population-based seroprevalence
surveys, therefore, give us an idea about the “true number of infections” including reported and
unreported cases, and consequently, the ascertainment rate6. Thus, adjusted estimates of total
number of cases and ascertainment rates based on serological surveys when available provide an
option to validate model-based estimates of unreported cases and underreporting factors, which
would usually be impossible to validate (except for a simulation study) since these numbers are
not observable the real data.
In an attempt to understand the spread of the virus in Delhi, the national capital region of India and
one of the hotspots of COVID-19 in the country, the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC)
in India performed a serological survey in Delhi. While limited on reported details, the Delhi
Serology Study collected 21,387 random samples across 11 districts in Delhi between June 27 and
July 10 and found COVID-19 antibodies present in 22.86% of samples7-9. A simple proportional
estimate would tell us that Delhi, with approximately 19.8 million people, had a total number of
cases standing somewhere around 4.6 Million by July 10. This contrasts sharply both with the
109,140 cumulative cases (3,300 total deaths) reported in Delhi as of July 10, which represents
roughly 0.55% of Delhi’s population, indicates that roughly, only 2.4% of cases are being detected
(underreporting factor of about 42), and also implies that the infection fatality rate (IFR) for Delhi
is of the order of 0.07% or 717 per million. This IFR seems low compared to estimates worldwide10
and as such it may be reasonable to argue that COVID related deaths are also possibly unreported,
or the cause of death misclassified. The doubt regarding death data is further substantiated as a
very small fraction of deaths in India are medically reported11 and the IFR estimates for SARSCoV-2 from other studies in the world10 appear to be higher than influenza (infection fatality rate
of influenza, as of 2018-19, is at 961 per million or around 0.1%)12
Both diagnostic and antibody tests suffer from the issue of false negatives and false positives, and
depending on which test is being talked about, one or the other of these errors are more crucial.
For the RT-PCR test, false negatives are more worrisome since that means allowing an infected
person to go about freely, potentially spreading the virus around. Similarly, we worry about the
false positives of an antibody test more, since it gives the false impression that the person has been
infected in the past, gained immunity, and is unlikely to be infected again. The RT-PCR test is
quoted to have a high false negative rate, ranging from 15-30% (i.e., low sensitivity, 85-70%), and
a low false positive rate around 1-4% (i.e., high specificity, 99-96%)13. The antibody test assays
are more precise - the commercial assays have sensitivity around 97.6% and specificity of 99.3%
(DiaSorin) at about 15 days after infection14. The ELISA assay used in the Delhi serosurvey is a
customized assay, about which no official information was not publicly released, but some
discussions on imperfections of the test are available in public media domain15. In light of these
imperfections and the high rate of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases, we develop an extension of a
standard SEIR model incorporating misclassification due to imperfect diagnostic testing to predict
both the number of unreported cases and deaths and to estimate the rate at which COVID-19 cases

are being underreported. An alternative approach that has been discussed in contemporary
literature is to model test activities in a way such that symptomatic individuals are identified and
successfully isolated with a given average delay from the onset of symptoms16. This approach can
handle both real-time RT-PCR tests and lab-based sero-surveillance.
Because the Delhi Serology Study provides a seroprevalence estimate, this is a unique opportunity
to help validate predictions for latent unreported infections for a SEIR model. We perform
adjustments of the reported case counts (and hence corresponding metrics such as the
underreporting factor, infection-fatality rate and case-fatality rate) under different sensitivity and
specificity assumptions for the diagnostic and antibody tests and potential underreporting of the
death counts, and validate the model-based estimates of the extent of underreporting to those
obtained from the seroprevalence-based calculations. We apply this framework to Delhi, using
reported COVID-19 data from covid19india.org2. This framework can be adapted to and applied
outside of Delhi and in other contexts where imperfect and limited testing exists.
RESULTS
Extended SEIR Model Adjusted for Misclassification
Under low (0.7), medium (0.85) and perfect (1) sensitivity, and perfect (1) specificity assumptions
for the RT-PCR diagnostic test, we preform predictions of total (reported and unreported) cases
and deaths for Delhi using the proposed extended SEIR model. Using data till June 30, this model
estimates 4.8 million cases and 33,165 deaths on July 10 if we assume the RT-PCR test has a
sensitivity of 0.85, and those predicted counts become 4.2 million and 28,499, respectively, if the
sensitivity is assumed to be 1.0. Compare to the observed case and death counts of 109,140 and
3,300 reported in Delhi as of July 10.2 The model predictions under the different scenarios
considered and the performances in terms of fitting the daily observed case and death counts are
summarized in Figures 2-3. Looking at the ratio of predicted total number of cases and the
predicted number of reported cases on July 10, it appears that the underreporting factor for cases
reported by the model is within the range of 34-53 and the same for the deaths is between 8-13
(Table 1 and Figure 4). This implies according to the model 97-98% Delhi’s cases remain
undetected.
Naïve Corrections to Reported Test Results using Known Misclassification Rates for Tests
Since the unreported number of cases and subsequently, the underreporting factor, are not part of
the observed data and therefore cannot directly be validated, we validate these estimates using
adjustments regarding the imperfection of the tests and estimated number of true infections
predicted by the serosurvey data. We also consider the hypothetical scenario considering 10-fold
underreporting of deaths, as suggested by the model outputs. However, we are not able to perform
any validation for the estimated underreporting factor for deaths as we do not have estimate of true
death rates or excess deaths.
Using varying (low to perfect) sensitivities and specificities for the diagnostic and antibody tests,
we estimate that the true case count in Delhi as of July 10 lies between 4.4 and 4.6 million, which
represents 30 to 42 times the number of reported cases (Table 2), these estimates being greatly in

agreement with the model outputs, as reported in the previous subsection. This indicates 96-97%
cases in Delhi were underreported.

fatality rate (#%(-# ./0#,%.*/'). We estimate that the CFR lies between 2.24-3.02%. On the other
hand, the sensitivity and specificity of the antibody test impact our estimates of the IFR. We
estimate that the IFR lies between 0.07-0.08% based on the reported death counts. If we consider
a 10-fold underreporting in death counts, the infection-fatality rate estimate increases to 0.7-0.8%
(Table 2).
DISCUSSION
We developed an extension of the standard SEIR compartmental model to adjust for the
misclassifications due to imperfect diagnostic testing. Applying our model on publicly available
infection and death data for Delhi, we estimated the underreporting factor for cases to be
somewhere between 34 and 53 and that for deaths to be somewhere between 8 and 13 on July 10.
Further, using adjustments under different imperfection scenarios for the diagnostic and
antibody tests, we came up with adjusted estimates of the underreporting factor which agreed
greatly with and validated those estimated from the model. Having an accurate idea about the
underreporting factor and the extent of spread is extremely helpful in terms of tracking the
growth of the pandemic and determining policies. Repeated serological surveys to track the
ever-evolving seroconversion scenario are often not viable options due to being expensive both
in terms of cost, resources and time, the model estimates, updated regularly with new incoming
data, provide an option to keep track of the underreporting factor and unreported cases and deaths.
The Delhi Serology Study is one of several COVID-19 serology studies that have been conducted
across the world (for a summary of such studies, please refer to Table 3)8, 17-28. The seroprevalence
found in the Delhi Serology Study (22.86%) is the highest among these studies but is similar to
that found in New York City (22.70%), another large, densely populated area26. This indicates that
Delhi is definitely on the higher side in terms of seroprevalence, even within worldwide epicenters
and hotspots of COVID-19. Another serosurvey conducted in the city of Mumbai, India found
strikingly different seroprevalences in slum (57.8%) vs non-slum areas (16%), the overall
estimated seroprevalence also being staggeringly high (40.5%) compared to other studies across
the world (Table 3)19.
Extensive and long-drawn discussions have already taken place in relation to potential community
transmission of COVID-19 in India. While even without a serological survey it is possible to
comment on this based on other information available in terms of the number of tests and test
positive rates, our results confirm that at least for Delhi, there is undoubtedly community
transmission with regards to the classical definition of the term29. With more than 500,000 active
cases in India and more than 10,000 active cases in Delhi as of July 28, many of the cases are
potentially not being tracked to an identifiable source of infection. Along these lines, there have
been debates about achieving herd immunity, and estimated range for the herd immunity threshold
lies within 44-73% (based on worldwide estimated basic reproduction number of 1.8-3.8)30-31.

Both for Delhi and more so possibly for other parts of India, herd immunity will potentially take
some time to be attained and is definitely not a panacea we can rely on. Even based on the IFR
obtained without adjusting for potential death underreporting and trusting the reported death
counts (Table 2), if 50% people in India, with a population of 1.38 billion, get infected (a concept
that many proponents of herd immunity have suggested), it would imply an estimated 550,000
deaths, which skyrockets to an estimate of a staggering 5.5 million deaths if we believe the
estimated underreporting factor from death from our proposed model.
There are several factors that we need to take into account about the Delhi Serological Study and
consequently, these factors also shape the potential implications of our results. A large set of
important information isn’t well-known or wasn’t publicly reported in the NCDC serology survey,
such as the response and positivity rates stratified by age, sex, job type, district; sampling design;
sensitivity or specificity of the customized assay – and so on. Releasing a single magic number
without a complete report is definitely not the best practice for science and policy and is
dissatisfying and potentially misleading. Further, we do not know if individuals with antibodies
are protected from re-infection or how long this protection lasts32. We need to know more about
the longevity of the antibody response and the levels of it needed to protect us from re-infections,
and also about the contagiousness and potential clinical severity of a person with the antibody.
Even though the appearance and spread of COVID-19 has taken the entire world by a storm, a
large number of examples from all across the world clearly depict that with extensive testing,
contact tracing, use of masks, hand hygiene and social distancing we can change the narrative and
course of this virus. For example, Delhi has seen tremendous success in turning the corner of the
virus curve with the reproduction number at 0.74 (July 28) and the R staying below unity for about
a month (Figures 5-6). Rapid and significant scientific advancements in both clinical and public
health aspects of the disease have been made over the past few months33, and focused and cautious
tracking of the pandemic with informed policy decisions are going to be as helpful as ever at this
point. In that line, our analytical framework of integrating diagnostic testing imperfections in
context of estimating unreported cases using the extended SEIR model and validating against
seroprevalence estimates will hopefully prove to be useful for other case-studies.
METHODS
Extended SEIR Model Adjusted for Misclassification
We developed an extension of a standard SEIR model. In this model, the susceptible individuals
(S) become exposed (E) when they are infected, but they have not started infecting the other
people. After a latency period, exposed individuals are able to infect other susceptible individuals
and are either untested (U) with probability 1 or tested (T) with probability 1 − 1. Tested
individuals enter either the false negative compartment (F) with probability 4 or the (true) positive
compartment with probability 1 − 4. Individuals who are in the untested and the false negative
compartments are considered unreported COVID-19 cases and enter either the recovered
unreported (RU) or death unreported (DU) compartments. Similarly, those who tested positive
move to either a recovered reported (RR) or death reported (DR) compartment. Figure 7 represents
the SEIR model schematic. The corresponding system of differential equations are presented
below. The parameters and their values used are described in Table 4.

Here, `(A) denotes the number of individuals in the compartment of interest ` at time A. In this
setting, both 9 and 1 are time-varying parameters which are estimated using the MetropolisHastings MCMC method34. To estimate the parameters, we first need to be able to solve the
differential equations, which is difficult to perform in this continuous-time setting. It is also worth
noting that we do not require the values of the variables for each time point, we only need their
values at discrete time steps, i.e., for each day. Thus, we approximate the above set of differential
equations by a set of recurrence relations. For any compartment `, the instantaneous rate of change
6a
with respect to time A (given by 6% ) is approximated by the difference between the counts of that
compartment on the (A + 1)%& day and the A %& day, that is `(A + 1) − `(A). Starting with an initial
value for each of the compartments on the Day 1 and using the discrete-time recurrence relations,
we can then obtain the solutions of our interest. Some examples of these discrete-time recurrence
relations are presented below.

The rest of the differential equations can be similarly approximated by a discrete-time recurrence

employed by the government of India, as described in Table 5. Using these, we performed our
predictions for the dates ranging from June 1 through July 26.
Naïve Corrections to Reported Test Results using Known Misclassification Rates

Let us set up a few notations first. Let N = population size, X = number of true cases in the
population (hence N – X = number of non-cases in the population), T = number of people tested,
S = number of true cases tested (hence T – S = number of non-cases tested, X – S = number of true
cases not tested, N – X – T + S = number of non-cases not tested), P = number of positive tests
(also, therefore, cumulative number of reported cases, hence T – P = number of negative tests).
Note that X and S are the only two unknowns in this setting. Also, let us assume that the sensitivity
of the test of interest is > and the specificity of the same is 9. With that, we can set up the following
equation, because there are two ways a test can be positive, as can be seen in Figure 8.
@ = I × > + (d − I) × (1 − 9) ⟹

@ I

underreporting for deaths), we can update these estimates as vE^ = 7y(xQP)L and wE^ = a . We

A critical question here is the choice of > and 9 for the two tests to ensure our computations reflect
adjustments made based on sensible and realistic scenarios. Based on previously reported
sensitivity and specificity levels for the diagnostic test13, we used the combinations > = 9 =
1 ({|14|}A A|~A), > = 0.85 ÄÅ 9 = 0.99, ÄÅ > = 0.7 ÄÅ 9 = 0.99. The serological assay
used by NCDC is a customized assay, for which we could not find any officially reported numbers.
Hence, we referred to existing literature on standard serological assays14 and publicly available
discussions on the Delhi serosurvey15, and decided to use the combinations of > = 9 =
1 ({|14|}A A|~A), > = 0.976 ÄÅ 9 = 0.993, ÄÅ > = 0.92 ÄÅ 9 = 0.97.

Description
Rate of infectious transmission by infected, tested individuals with false
negative results.
Ratio of rate of spread of infection by tested positive patients to that by false
negatives. "# < 1 represents the scenario where individuals who test
positive are infecting susceptible individuals are a lower rate than infected
individuals with false negative test results.
Scaling factor for the rate of spread of infection by untested individuals. "$
is assumed to be < 1 as U mostly consists of asymptomatic or mildly
symptomatic cases who are known to spread the disease at a much lower
rate than those with higher levels of symptoms.
Incubation period (in days).
Means number of days until recovery for infected individuals.
Mean number of days for the test result to come after a person is tested.
Under the assumption of instantaneous test results, this is taken to be zero.
Death rate attributable to COVID-19 which is equivalent to inverse of the
average number of days for death starting from the onset of disease times
the probability of death of an infected individual.
Natural birth and death rates (assumed to be equal).
Probability of being tested for infectious individuals.
Probability of a false negative RT-PCR diagnostic test result.
Scaling factors for rate of recovery for undetected and false negative
individuals respectively. Both !/ and !1 are assumed to be less than 1. It is
assumed that the recovery rate is slower than the detected ones for the False
Negative ones because they are not getting any hospital treatments. The
condition of Untested individuals is not so severe as they consist of mostly
asymptomatic people. So, they are assumed to recover faster than the
Current Positive Ones.
Scaling factors for death rate for undetected and false negative individuals
respectively. Both 2/ and 21 are assumed to be less than 1. Same as before,
the death rate for False Negative ones are assumed to be higher than the
Current detected Positive as they are not receiving proper treatment. While,
for the Untested ones, the death rate is taken to be lesser because they are
mostly asymptomatic. So, their probability of dying is much less.

terms of true infection status; green and red lines indicate (correct and incorrect, respectively)
decisions based on testing procedure. Here, we have referred to the diagnostic test, and hence, the
active infection status. Similar framework applies to the antibody test and the past infection status.
