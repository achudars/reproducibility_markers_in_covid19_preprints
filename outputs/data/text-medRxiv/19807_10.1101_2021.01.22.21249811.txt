Abstract
Background: The novel human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has affected at least 218
countries worldwide. Some geographical and environmental factors are positively
associated with a better or worse prognosis concerning COVID-19 disease and with lower
or higher SARS-CoV-2 transmission. High altitude exposure has been associated with
lower SARS-CoV-2 attack rates; nevertheless, the role of chronic high-altitude exposure on
the clinical outcome of critically ill COVID-19 patients has not been studied.
Objective: To compare the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with
COVID-19 hospitalized in two intensive care units (ICU) located at low and high altitude.
Exposure and Outcome: To explore the effect of two different elevations (10 m vs 2,850
m above sea level) on COVID-19 clinical outcome and survival.
Methods: A prospective cohort, two-center study in confirmed COVID-19 adult patients
admitted to a low altitude (Sea level) and high altitude (2,850 m) ICU units in Ecuador was
conducted. Two hundred and thirty confirmed COVID-19 patients were enrolled from
March 15th to July 15th, 2020. Sociodemographic, clinical, laboratory and imaging
parameters including supportive therapies, pharmacological treatments and medical
complications were reported and compared between the low and high-altitude groups.
Results: The median age of all the patients was 60 years, 64.8% were men and 35.2% were
women. A total of 105 (45.7%) patients had at least one underlying comorbidity, the most
frequent being chronic diseases, such as hypertension (33.5%), diabetes (16.5%), and
chronic kidney failure (5.7%). The APACHE II scale at 72 hours was especially higher in
the low-altitude group with a median of 18 points (IQR: 9.5-24.0), compared to 9 points
(IQR: 5.0-22.0) obtained in the group of high altitude. There is evidence of a difference in
survival in favor of the high-altitude group (p = 0.006), the median survival being 39 days,
compared to 21 days in the low altitude group.
Conclusion: There has been a substantial improvement in survival amongst people
admitted to the high-altitude critical care unit. High altitude living was associated with
improved survival, especially among patients with no comorbidities. COVID-19 patients

low altitude group.
Keywords: COVID-19; High altitude, ARDS; ICU; Survival Analysis
Introduction
In December 2019, the first cases of pneumonia due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus were
reported in Wuhan, China 1,2. In March 11th 2020, the novel Coronavirus disease (COVID19), a condition with multiple clinical features, which can rapidly evolve into acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other serious complications was declared a
pandemic

2,3

. The disease spread rapidly, affecting regions and areas located in urban

settings but also in rural and geographical distant areas all over the world4,5.
The epidemiological behavior of the pandemic showed an exponential growth throughout
many countries, while others seem to have managed the outbreak better 6. Several studies
have identified differences in morbidity and mortality depending on many factors including
socioeconomic status, the burden of chronic diseases, adequate access to health care, the
strength of the epidemiological surveillance systems and the implementation of control
measures as well as strict mobility restrictions 7. During the first months of the pandemic,
very few ecological studies showed a possible epidemiological and survival implication
exerted by high altitude7,8. It has been proposed that these results are in part answered by
the well-known physiological acclimatization and the long term adaptation to high altitude
exposure, generating a greater tolerance to the hypoxia 7–10. These results are also supported
by the presence of some biological plausibility regarding lower virus’ affinity for the type2 angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2) receptor since highlanders might have lower
expression of ACE-2 receptors8. Consequently, it has been hypothesized that high altitude
populations would have less susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, therefore lower likelihood to
develop severe pathological conditions related to COVID-19

11

. Another hypothesis

surrounding those findings refer to the involvement of the hypoxia-triggered protein that
regulates angiogenesis, the well-known Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1 α) 10,12–16.

The link between chronic exposure due to high altitude living and the clinical features of
COVID-19 patients has been poorly studied17,18. Studies on clinical, ventilatory and
respiratory support parameters’ differences have been studied in locations below 1,500 m
and no evidence about the role of high-altitude exposure on severally ill COVID-19
patients have been published19.
Therefore, it is important to describe the possible role of high-altitude exposure as factor
interfering with the clinical progression and the final outcome of patients with severe
COVID-19.
Methods:
Study design
A prospective cohort study including patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection
confirmed with real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed from March
15th, 2020 to July 15th 2020.
Setting
The study was carried out in two intensive care units (ICU) located at two different
elevations from the Social Security Health System (IESS) in Ecuador. The IESS-Quito Sur
Hospital located in the city of Quito in Ecuador (located at 2,850 m above sea level) and the
IESS-Los Ceibos located in the city of Guayaquil (Located at sea level).
Population and study Size
All the patients included in this study were admitted to the ICU unit in one of the two
hospitals. We used a non-probabilistic sampling technique for both hospitals based on the
inclusion criteria. The present study included a total of 230 patients diagnosed with
COVID-19 using the RT-PCR technique, of which 114 patients were treated in the highaltitude group (IESS-Quito Sur), while 116 patients belonged to the low-altitude group
(IESS-Los Ceibos).
Inclusion criteria

Adult men and women patients admitted to the ICU diagnosed with COVID-19 by means
of RT-PCR who lived at least 1 year in the unit's coverage region and signed the informed
consent for the use of the information were included in this study.
Exclusion criteria
Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 by RT-PCR who did not meet the criteria for admission
to the ICU or who lived less than 1 year in the unit's coverage region or who did not sign
the informed consent for the use of the information were excluded.
Data sources and variables
Demographic information, clinical characteristics (including medical history, history of
symptoms, comorbidities), chest computed tomography (CT) results, laboratory findings,
ventilatory values, and medications used were collected from each patient. The dates of
disease onset, hospital admission, admission to the ICU, and death or discharge date from
the ICU were also recorded, as well as the APACHE II scores and the Charlson index. The
onset date was defined as the day the patient noticed any symptoms. The severity of
COVID-19 was defined according to the diagnosis and treatment guide for SARS-CoV-2
issued by the World Health Organization (WHO) 20. It was designated as critical illness due
to COVID-19 when patients had one of the following criteria: (a) acute respiratory distress
syndrome (any grade); (b) Septicemia; and (c) septic shock. The data were obtained from
the electronic medical record of a common registry system for both units and analyzed by
three independent researchers.
Statistical analysis
Categorical variables were summarized as frequencies and percentages, and continuous
variables were described using median values and interquartile ranges (IQR) or mean and
standard deviation, as appropriate. Analysis included two-tailed Student's t-test and the
Mann-Whitney U test was used. The frequencies of the categorical variables were
compared using the chi-square test and expressed in count and percentage. Also, survival
curves (Kaplan Meier), the log-rank statistic, and the hazard ratio between groups were
obtained.

Bivariate and multivariate analyzes were performed to identify factors associated with
death from COVID-19 in all patients using the Cox risk regression model. To obtain a
reduced set of variables from the broad set of predictors, we carried out a progressive en
bloc procedure assigning the predictor variables into six groups: sociodemographic
characteristics and comorbidities, complications, scales, ventilatory values, medications,
and laboratory and imaging parameters. A multivariate regression analysis was applied
within each block using two criteria to achieve the best set of predictors: relevance to the
clinical situation and bivariate and multivariate statistical significance (p <0.05). Variables
with more than 25% missing values were not considered for the analysis.
All statistical analyzes were performed in SPSS version 25 and graphs were generated
using GraphPad Prism version 7.00 software (GraphPad Software Inc).
Bias
In order to minimize observation bias for systematic differences between the low and highaltitude group, observers were blinded the hypothesis under investigation and a strict
protocol was implemented in both sites.
Results
The present study included a total of n = 230 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, of which
n = 114 patients were treated in the high-altitude group, while 116 patients belonged to the
low-altitude group.
Sociodemographic characteristic
The median age of all the patients was 60 years, with a range of 49 to 69 years, and the
majority (80.9%) of them were over 45 years of age. More than half (64.8%) of the patients
were men. The BMI of all the patients was 27.8 kg/m2, while about half (47.8%) were
overweight, and (32.9%) some degree of obesity. A total of n = 105 (45.7%) patients had at
least one underlying comorbidity, the most frequent being chronic diseases, such as
hypertension (33.5%), diabetes (16.5%), and chronic kidney failure (5.7%). Five patients
with COPD were identified (Table 1). When comparing the samples by altitude, no

differences were evidenced between age, sex, and BMI. On the other hand, the low-altitude
group presented a greater number of patients with comorbidities measured by the Charlson
index, highlighting the cases of hypertensive and diabetic patients. The mean interval from
the onset of symptoms to admission to the ICU for all patients was 8 days (IQR: 6-11).
However, in the high-altitude group, there was a shorter median of 7 days (IQR: 5-10)
(Table 1).

Regarding the scales evaluated, it was evidenced that upon admission to the ICU, the
APACHE II scale in the first 24 hours presented a median of 15 points (IQR: 10.0-20.0) in
the high-altitude group, whilst the low altitude scored 16 points (12.0-20.5) and did not
show a statistical difference for both groups (p = 0.206). However, the same scale at 72
hours was especially higher in the low-altitude group with a median of 18 points (IQR: 9.524.0), compared to 9 points (IQR: 5.0-22.0) obtained in the group of high altitude.
Concerning the most common complications presented during the ICU stay, acute
respiratory distress syndrome in adults was evidenced in n = 219 (95.2%) patients, any type
of shock in n = 166 (72.2%) patients, acute / exacerbated renal failure in n = 101 (43.9%)
and delirium in n = 88 (38.3%). There were no statistical relationships between
complications and altitude (Table 2). Finally, n = 129 deaths (56.1%) were recorded in the
entire sample, of which most (n =77 (66.4%) were recorded in the low-altitude group
compared to n = 52 (45.6%) at high altitude, p = 0.002 (Table 2).

The laboratory results are shown in (Table 3), where lower values of platelets, liver
enzymes (AST and ALT), and lactate were evidenced in the low altitude group compared to
the high-altitude group. Against the leukocyte count was higher in the low altitude group
(Figure 1).

The acid-base profile for both groups show normal ranges; however, there is a greater
alkalotic component (higher median pH and bicarbonate) in the low-altitude group
(p=0.000). While the level of CO2 appears in normal ranges and without difference between

Mechanical ventilation was maintained for a median of 12 days (IQR: 7.0-20.0) for the two
groups. During admission, the FiO2 for both groups did not show differences, however, the
measurements at 72 hours and 7 days show significant differences with higher values in the
low altitude group (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Respiratory differences

Similarly, a higher value was evidenced during the measurements of the partial pressure of
oxygen (PO2) in the patients in the low altitude group, compared to the high-altitude group
and consequently in the Pa-Fi relationship (Figure 2). The need for a tracheostomy reached
17.5% of patients (Table 4).

Medicines
During the hospital stay, 136 (63.6%) patients received corticosteroids, of which up to 60
(39%) in mg/kg doses, for a median time of 4 (IQR: 3-6) days. The most prescribed
corticosteroid was methylprednisolone (n = 97; 42.2%). A total of n = 224 (97.4%) of
patients received heparins, of which 82 (79.1%) patients received isocoagulation doses.
Regarding medications that to date were used for the treatment of COVID, it was evidenced
that 118 (51.3%) and 149 (64.8%) of patients received Hydroxychloroquine and Lopinavir /
Ritonavir, respectively. In the comparison between groups, the low-altitude group received
greater numbers of corticosteroid prescriptions and tocilizumab than the high-altitude
group. However, the patients did not show differences in the administration of heparins,
antimalarials, or lopinavir/ritonavir (Table 5).

There is evidence of a difference in survival in favor of the high-altitude group (p = 0.006),
with the median survival of 39 days, compared to 21 days of the low altitude group (Figure
3).

The hazard ratio found was 0.55 (95%CI = 0.39-0.78). Due to the differences found
concerning comorbidities, the analysis by subgroups was performed according to the
Charlson classification (Figure 4).

It is evident that the patients classified with a low and high index did not present
differences between groups by altitude p = 0.929 and p = 0.920, respectively. However, in
the group with no comorbidities, there was evidence of a difference between altitudes (p =
0.005), with the median survival of 17 days in the low-altitude group and 49 in the highaltitude group. The hazard ratio found was 0.41 (95% CI = 0.23-0.75).
Predictors of death
In the final adjusted analysis, 5 factors associated with the risk of death were found. As a
protection factor, they were high altitude and the presence of a tracheostomy. On the other
hand, as risk factors were the APACHE II score greater than 17 at 72 hours, the relationship
between arterial oxygen pressure and inspiratory oxygen fraction (PaO2 / FiO2) on the
seventh day less than 300, and the presence of coagulopathy during the hospitalization
(Figure 5).

Discussion
The COVID-19 pandemic has severely affected several countries worldwide, so
understanding the factors involved in its prognosis is a priority worldwide. Evidence has
been found of the influence of altitude on the number of infections and mortality, with
lower values in high altitude places 21,22. The pathophysiological reason for this relationship
is not established. On the one hand, high-altitude patients present a chronic conversion of
the hypoxia-inducing factor type 1 to type 2, which favors a greater tolerance to hypoxemia
and decreases the acute tissue damage triggered by patients with severe acute respiratory
conditions. On the other hand, it has been shown that some high-altitude resident
population groups have developed polymorphisms of the ACE2 receptor that favor a better
tolerance to hypoxia

23,24

. The same receptor that is used by SARS-CoV-2 to enter the

target cells and that, when inactivated, promotes a pro-inflammatory state that would
increase the repercussions in the lungs and other organs 11,23,24. Despite the absence of clear
pathophysiology, the present study provides relevant epidemiological and clinical data for
understanding the influence of altitude on the evolution of seriously ill patients with
COVID-19.
The study shows a mainly male hospital population with a median age of 60 years, with
results similar to other studies

3,25–27

. The analysis together showed leukocytosis with

neutrophilia and lymphopenia, besides, increased values of ferritin, LDH, CRP and
procalcitonin were evidenced. This analysis is compatible with studies similar to those
found in patients with severe COVID-19, where abnormal values of leukocytes,
neutrophils, lymphocytes and platelets are evidenced 28,29, while blood biochemistry shows
increased CRP and LDH 30. In the analysis by altitude, the low altitude group had a higher
number of leukocytes, a lower number of platelets and higher levels of CRP, however the
rest of the values were similar in both groups.
The oxygenation parameters expressed in levels of PaO2 / FiO2, PO2 and SaO2 were found
to be compromised in both groups at the time of admission. Findings similar to those found
in other studies, where dyspnea, increased heart rate and decreased PaO2 / FiO2 value are

evidenced in patients with COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care service 31. On the other
hand, the median static compliance of this analysis was in the range reported by other
studies of 27 to 35 ml/cm H2O

32–34

. However, the high-altitude group showed lower

oxygenation values and higher static compliance values, a result similar to the report of the
absence of correlation between PaO2 / FiO2 and static compliance in patients with COVID19 found by Giacomo et al. 32. is a consequence of the fact that the lungs of patients with
COVID-19 have vascular characteristics secondary to endothelial damage that
differentiates it from the isolated pulmonary involvement of other lung diseases (28).
The treatment basis for moderate-severe ARDS secondary to COVID-19 is based on
ventilatory support with low tidal volumes, a prone position, and active management of
intravenous fluids 19,20,35,36. In this way, it is evident that the strategy The ventilator used for
both groups in the present study was protective and up to 79.1% of patients complied with
the prone position. Despite these measures, the complications were not different, and the
high-altitude group was characterized by higher survival with a median of 39 days,
compared to 21 days in the low-altitude group. A difference that remained constant in the
subgroup without comorbidities provides one of the first measurements of the contribution
of altitude as a factor to be considered in this pathology. It is also important to note that
currently the evidence for the use of dexamethasone has been established as a protective
factor for mortality 37; however, the low-altitude group that received a greater amount of
corticosteroids presented higher mortality than the high-altitude group.
In the Cox regression model, 5 factors associated with the risk of death were evidenced.
These findings of increased risk do not differ from what is reported in the literature, for its
part the APACHE II score has been an effective clinical tool to predict hospital mortality in
patients with coronavirus disease 2019 38. Thromboembolic events have also been shown to
pose a significant risk of mortality in critically ill patients

. Besides, as protection,

tracheostomy is a procedure that favors the release of ventilatory support in patients with
prolonged mechanical ventilation, for which it has been classified as a protective factor
against severe complications

. Finally, although altitude has been reported as a possible

intervening factor in the clinical outcome of several patients

7,8

, this is the first study to

elucidate more causal information on this relationship.
Limitations
This study was carried out in two of COVID-19 designed hospitals, part of the social
security health system.

The private for-profit health system also receives COVID-19

patients, nevertheless, this population was not included in our analysis. To strengthen the
findings, there needs to be further study with greater numbers of study sites, greater patient
sample sizes and across countries. To better understand the relationship between severity of
disease and high-altitude, a range of altitudes needs to be studied, as our study only
investigated two altitudes above sea level.
Conclusion
In this series of cases of critically ill patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to the
ICU, there has been a substantial improvement in survival amongst people admitted to the
high-altitude critical care unit. High altitude living was associated with improved survival,
especially among patients with no comorbidities. COVID-19 patients admitted to the highaltitude ICU unit have improved severity-of-disease classification system scores at 72 hours
and reported better respiratory and ventilatory profiles than the low altitude group. Our
analysis suggests this improvement is not due to temporal changes in the age, sex or major
comorbidity burden of admitted patients.
