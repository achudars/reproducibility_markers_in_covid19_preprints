ABSTRACT
We report the emergency development and application of a robust serologic test to
evaluate acute and convalescent antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in Argentina. The
assays, COVIDAR IgG and IgM, which were produced and provided for free to health
authorities, private and public health institutions and nursing homes, use a combination
of a trimer stabilized spike protein and the receptor binding domain (RBD) in a single
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plate. Over half million tests have already
been distributed to detect and quantify antibodies for multiple purposes, including
assessment of immune responses in hospitalized patients and large seroprevalence
studies in neighborhoods, slums and health care workers, which resulted in a powerful
tool for asymptomatic detection and policy making in the country. Analysis of antibody
levels and longitudinal studies of symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections
in over one thousand patient samples provided insightful information about IgM and IgG
seroconversion time and kinetics, and IgM waning profiles. At least 35% of patients
showed seroconversion within 7 days, and 95% within 45 days of symptoms onset, with
simultaneous or close sequential IgM and IgG detection. Longitudinal studies of
asymptomatic cases showed a wide range of antibody responses with median levels
below those observed in symptomatic patients. Regarding convalescent plasma
applications, a protocol was standardized for the assessment of end point IgG antibody
titers with COVIDAR with more than 500 plasma donors. The protocol showed a positive
correlation with neutralizing antibody titers, and was used to assess antibody titers for
clinical trials and therapies across the country. Here, we demonstrate the importance of
providing a robust and specific serologic assay for generating new information about
antibody kinetics in infected individuals and mitigation policies to cope with pandemic
needs.

AUTHOR SUMMARY
The development of robust and specific serologic assays to detect antibodies to SARSCoV-2 is essential to understand the pandemic evolution and to stablish mitigation
strategies. Here, we report the emergency development, production and application of a
versatile ELISA test for detecting antibodies against the whole spike protein and its
receptor binding domain. Over half million tests have been freely distributed in public and
private health institutions of Argentina for evaluating immune responses, convalescent
plasma programs and for large seroprevalence studies in neighborhoods and health care
workers. We are still learning how and when to use serologic testing in different
epidemiological settings. This program allowed us to produce large amount of high quality
data on antibody levels in symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections and
generate relevant information about IgM and IgG seroconversion time and kinetics. We
also present standardized protocols for antibody quantification as guidance for
convalescent donor plasma selection in hospitals throughout the country for
compassionate use and clinical trials. Here, we provide a framework for generating widely
available tools, protocols and information of antibody responses for pandemic
management.

INTRODUCTION
The Americas have been profoundly impacted and have become the epicenter of
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), as in October 13th more than 18 million
infections and more than 550,000 deaths have been reported in the continent.
Surveillance and testing are fundamental in controlling viral spread and understanding
pandemic evolution. Detection of viral RNA by qPCR is the gold standard for diagnosis of
acute infections. Measurement of humoral responses has been used as a complement to
nucleic acid testing, for diagnosis of suspected cases with negative qPCR results, and for
detection of acute or past infections in asymptomatic cases [1]. However, serology
became an essential tool for the management of the pandemic, including seroprevalence
assessment of immunity in the population, measurement of neutralizing antibody titers in
convalescent patients and antibody response upon vaccination [2,3].
Antibody mediated immunity is thought to protect individuals from SARS-CoV-2 infection
by interfering with viral entry and/or viral replication. Antibody responses appear within
the first week of symptoms onset in about 30 to 40 % of infections and, in most cases,
simultaneous or close seroconversion for IgM and IgG were observed [1,4]. Antibodies
have been detected in more than 90% of infections after the third week of symptoms
onset [5]. However, the duration and degree to which recovery from COVID-19 disease,
or asymptomatic infection, confers prolonged immunity from reinfection is still unclear,
even among individuals with high antibody titers [6,7]. We are still learning about the
dynamic nature of antibody response linked to severe, mild, and asymptomatic COVID19 manifestations and, as the pandemic progresses, algorithms and strategies to
implement serologic testing in different epidemiological settings are under evaluation. For
understanding this complex process, it is essential to have highly specific and sensitive
serologic assays [8,9]. Based on the urgent need to attain reliable tests that measure
antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, we redirected resources of a basic molecular virology
laboratory, as part of a national task force for the emergency, for the development and
production of an affordable and robust serologic assay for Argentina and neighboring
countries. COVIDAR serologic test was generated early after the first COVID-19 case in
Argentina, and over half million tests have been already produced and distributed for free
in the country.

An important application of serology measurement is the assessment of humoral
responses to vaccines and identification of plasma from convalescent donors for possible
therapies [10–12]. During the initial stages of the COVID-19 epidemic in China,
convalescent plasma therapy was used compassionately and has since been
implemented in the United States and many other countries [13–17]. Randomized clinical
trials to evaluate the usefulness of convalescent plasma in different stages of the disease
are ongoing (https://clinicaltrials.gov). Success of this intervention likely increases with
the antibody titer of the donor as recently shown [15,16]. Thus, it is important to screen
potential convalescent donors to select plasma with the highest antibody titers. This
screening can be accomplished by measuring the amount of antibodies by titration and
defining the virus-neutralizing activity of the plasma. However, the lack of standardization
and correlation between antibody levels and neutralizing capacity of antibodies
complicates implementation and evaluation of plasma therapy protocols for COVID-19.
Studies using SARS-CoV-2 in plaque reduction assays or pseudotyped particle-based
systems indicate that plasma derived from convalescent patients has potent neutralizing
activity related to IgG molecules recognizing the spike protein, suggesting that IgG
antibodies against spike have high potential to fulfill neutralizing functions in vivo [18–21].
We developed standardized protocols for antibody quantification using COVIDAR IgG
and provided data showing a positive correlation with neutralizing antibody
measurements. This information allowed the implementation of protocols in hospitals

RESULTS
Due to the urgent need for tools to cope with the pandemic, the Argentine Ministry of
Science redirected scientific capacities to generate COVID-19 control means. In this
context, the COVIDAR group developed a quantitative serologic test based on ELISA for
SARS-CoV-2 infection, which gained emergency approval by the National Administration
for Drugs, Food and Medical Devices (ANMAT) by May 4th. The assay uses two viral
proteins, a trimer stabilized spike protein and the receptor binding domain (RBD),
expressed in human cells. Combining these proteins in one assay provided higher

sensitivity and reproducibility than using each protein in independent plates for IgG and
IgM testing [24].
For this study, four different cohorts of patient samples were used. First, a full data set of
535 acute or convalescent COVID-19 qPCR positive serum samples; second a data base
of antibody measurements and specific information of suspected COVID-19 with 3500
entries; third, 1074 serum samples from longitudinal studies of a cohort of 93 patients;
and fourth, 561 COVID-19 convalescent plasma from potential donors.
IgG and IgM responses were initially evaluated in 535 qPCR positive patients (Figure 1A).
Samples were grouped according to days of symptoms onset (SO). In the early phase,
within 7 days of SO, the IgG sensitivity was 35% (Figure 1A). The sensitivity for IgG
detection increased from 72% to 74% between 2 and 3 weeks, and seroconversion
increased up to 90.4% after 3 weeks. In addition, within 100 samples with >45 days of
SO, 5 did not show presence of IgG, indicating that 5% of the patients displayed
undetectable levels of IgG or they were non-responders up to 45 days. Regarding IgM,
within 7 days of SO, sensitivity was 46%. IgM levels were highest between 15 and 21
days, and although IgM positivity increased after 3 weeks, the antibody level observed by
optic density (OD) at 450 nm clearly decreased (Figure 1A).
Assessment of 277 pre-pandemic samples, including acute infections of other pathogens
(dengue, HCV, HIV and seasonal coronavirus), were performed. The cut off for IgG and
IgM were defined to maximize specificity, ensuring no false positives. Thus, the cut off
was defined as the mean of negative control plus 10 or 5 standard deviations for IgG and
IgM, respectively (Figure 1B). High specificity of COVIDAR IgG has been supported by
baseline seroprevalence studies of heath care professionals (HCP). In this regard,
seroprevalence in HCP at region VIII of Buenos Aires Province, performed in June 2020,
showed 0.74% of IgG positivity [25].
A data set of IgG and IgM, including 1379 samples of acute and convalescent infections
with complete medical records, was used to analyze distribution of age, gender and
symptoms. No significant differences concerning gender were observed. The amount of
patients with high IgG levels in the group of severe symptoms was larger than those in
the moderate and mild groups. The distribution of IgG levels for patients with severe

symptoms were significantly different from those with mild symptoms (Wilcoxon rank sum
test p-value<0.0001). The median OD level at 450 nm for IgG was 2, 2.9 and 3.9 for mild,
moderate and severe groups, respectively (scale up to 4). This trend of antibody levels
with symptoms was also evident for IgM, median 0.8, 1.4 and 2.9 for mild, moderate and
severe groups, respectively (Figure 1C). The distribution of IgM levels for patients with
severe vs mild symptoms were significantly different (Wilcoxon rank sum test pvalue<0.0001). Antibody measurements also correlated with age, covering a range from
16 to more than 65 years showing the highest antibody levels associated with older
COVID-19 patients (Figure 1D). Antibody level distribution significantly differed between
patients that were < than 45 versus those that were > than 45 years old (Wilcoxon rank
sum test p-value<0.0001).
Serological courses were also followed in a separate cohort of 93 hospitalized patients,
most of which (90 patients) underwent seroconversion during the follow-up period (Figure
2A). From this, 1074 antibody determinations were performed. We represented the
seroconversion time for IgM and IgG for each patient, as the first moment in which
antibodies were detected. In most cases, synchronous seroconversion of IgG and IgM
was observed (67 patients, 72%). IgM seroconversion was earlier than IgG in 24% of the
patients, while IgG appeared earlier than IgM in 9% of the patients (Figure 2A). This
longitudinal study indicates that in the first week of SO 34% of the patients were IgG
positive and 38% IgM positive, in agreement with data provided in Figure 1, obtained with
a different data set and analysis. In addition, considering patients that were followed for
at least 45 days of SO, the seroconversion rate in this cohort was 96.7%.
For other infectious diseases, information regarding duration of IgM is relevant for
identification of possible active infections. In our cohort of COVID 19 subjects, longitudinal
studies of antibody responses showed a considerable heterogeneity of IgM kinetics
(Figure 2B). Analysis of IgM profiles of the data set shown in Figure 2A indicate that in
60% of the cases IgM levels declined before 30 days of SO, while in 40% of the patients
it remained at high levels after 30 days, highlighting a wide range of IgM responses and
kinetics in different patients (Figure 2B). Specific examples of longitudinal measurements
of patients with severe symptoms indicate that while IgG levels plateau at high levels and
remained, in most cases, at elevated titers between 40 and 60 days of SO, IgM dynamics

were also very diverse (Figure 2C). IgM titrations indicate that, while in some patients the
antibody levels abruptly or slowly dropped before 30 days, in other patients IgM levels
remained high (titers above 1/12,000), even at 60 days of SO (Figure 2C), suggesting
that IgM detection should be used with caution in SARS-CoV-2 infections.
Serology testing has been performed systematically in HCP and nursing homes using
COVIDAR in asymptomatic populations for surveillance. Data indicate that asymptomatic
infections were detected by IgG and IgM testing, though at lower levels compared with
symptomatic patients (Figure 3A). In addition, longitudinal studies of SARS-CoV-2
infections in the absence of symptoms also indicated simultaneous or close
seroconversion of IgM and IgG (Figure 3B).
Whole blood antibody testing by ELISA assay validated for large scale
seroprevalence studies
Well-designed serosurveys are essential to determine how prevalent COVID-19 is in the
general population, in selected subsections of the population (such as health care
workers), or in specific risk groups. Highly specific and sensitive assays are desirable for
accurate seroprevalence studies; however, it is also necessary to have methods that are
suitable for simple and fast sample collection. ELISA assays use venipuncture, and
require refrigerated storage of samples during transportation, making the assay
incompatible with massive testing. To overcome this limitation, we adapted the COVIDAR
IgG and IgM assays to work with whole blood samples obtained by finger prick. A selfcontained Serokit was validated for storage and transportation of whole blood using a
glycerin based preservation system [26]. Similar methods have been extensively used in
serosurvey studies of Chagas disease conducted in rural areas of Argentina [27].
To validate the process, 68 paired serum and whole blood samples from confirmed
SARS-CoV-2 qPCR positive patients were used. All serum specimens were kept at 4°C,
while whole blood samples collected from the same individuals were divided as follows.
Fifty two whole blood samples were kept at ambient temperature and, to evaluate stability,
16 samples were placed at 37°C for 7 days using the Serokit preservation system. IgG
and IgM antibody reactivity from serum samples showed 100% agreement with those

from the same individual’s whole blood samples stored using Serokit, either at room
temperature or at 37°C (Figure 3).
The validation of finger prick capillary whole blood sample application with Serokit storage
widened COVIDAR use to field serosurveys. Until now, seroprevalence studies in nine
slums of Buenos Aires, and surveillance studies among HCP in 30 hospitals have been
conducted [28–30].
Standardized protocols for IgG quantification that correlate with neutralizing
activity
An important limitation to evaluate the quality and quantity of antibodies present in
COVID-19 convalescent plasma is the lack of tests that can be easily performed in each
institution for possible therapies and clinical studies. Previous analysis using serologic
test assessing IgG titers directed to RBD and/or spike have shown a positive correlation
with antibody neutralization [7]. Due to the urgent need for tools, we validated an IgG
titration protocol using COVIDAR and performed correlations with neutralizing antibody
titers. Protocols and COVIDAR kits for IgG titration were freely distributed in private and
public institutions in 20 out of 23 provinces of the country, in which more than 100,000
tests have been already performed.
Five hundred and sixty-one convalescent donor plasma samples were tittered in our
laboratory for standardization. A distribution analysis of the amount of donors and IgG
levels indicate that more than 80% of the samples displayed spike specific end point IgG
titers above 1/400. Hyper-immune plasmas with titers as high as 1/400,000 were
observed (Figure 5A). A significant difference of IgG titers was observed between donors
that experienced mild symptoms and those that experienced moderate or severe
symptoms, median of 1/800 and 1/6400, respectively (p=0.0001) (Figure 5A). Full titration
curves are shown in heat maps to illustrate this distribution (Figure 5B).
The data using the IgG titration protocol was correlated with virus-neutralizing activity
using SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped VSV particles (CoV2pp) [31]. Plasma from 176 potential
donors were used to assess neutralizing activity. Neutralization curves were fit using a 4parameter logistic regression model and used to determine 50 and 80% CoV2pp absolute
infection inhibition concentration (AbsIC50 and AbsIC80, respectively) by measuring

luciferase reporter activity encoded in the CoV2pp. AbsIC50 and AbsIC80 values were
correlated with spike specific end point IgG titers (r=0.717, p<0.0001 and r=0.716,
p<0.0001 respectively, Figure 5C).
Convalescent plasma samples with low IgG titers between 1/50 to 1/200, displayed
detectable neutralizing antibodies, with IC80 from the reciprocal of 16 to 132, highlighting
that all COVID-19 convalescent individuals with positive anti-spike IgG showed
neutralizing antibodies (Figure 5C). A positive correlation between spike binding IgG titers
and CoV2pp infection neutralizing activity was observed with convalescent donor plasma
titers above 1/200 (Figure 5C). Plasmas with high spike IgG titers invariably displayed
high neutralization activity estimated by IC50 or IC80.
We conclude that using end point titrations for total IgG against spike with COVIDAR is
suitable for large scale studies, especially in areas of limited resources, as surrogate of
neutralization potency and guidance for convalescent donor plasma selection.

DISCUSSION
The development and appropriate application of serologic assays to detect antibodies to
SARS-CoV-2 are essential to determine the pandemic evolution and stablish mitigation
policies. Here, we developed and produced a widely available serologic tool to assist
health authorities for pandemic management. Protocols and reagents were distributed to
evaluate immune status of hospitalized patients, surveillance of at risk groups,
seroprevalence studies in different populations and evaluation of plasma from
convalescent donors for possible therapies. The biggest challenge still stands regarding
how to deploy this tool in a strategic manner to bring communities out of the current
suffering.
We provided a robust serologic test for health institutions throughout the country and
generated highly needed information of humoral responses of acute and convalescent
SARS-CoV-2 infections. Specific IgG and IgM responses were found to be highly
heterogeneous among different individuals. We observed early seroconversion within the
first week of SO in at least 34% of the patients (Figure 1 and 2). This raised the question

10

of whether IgM and/or IgG seroconversion time indicates the end of infectiousness or
whether early antibody appearance may overlap with active infection and possible
transmission. Although this is an issue that requires further attention, periodic serology
testing has been useful for guiding focused qPCR testing, asymptomatic case
identification and contact tracing.
The fraction of asymptomatic but infectious cases is a critical epidemiological
characteristic that modulates pandemic potential. Viral load and antibody responses in
asymptomatic individuals are both important to understand transmission and pandemic
extension. It is still unclear how many people carry SARS-CoV-2 infection
asymptomatically. It has been shown that the ratio symptomatic to asymptomatic cases
changes in different settings. Ratios from 2:1 to near 1:8 symptomatic to asymptomatic
cases have been reported [28,32,33]. The factors that influence this large variation are
still unknown. One concern is that the low level of antibodies found in asymptomatic cases
may lead to their underestimation [34]. Our studies show wide individual variations in the
antibody response and kinetics in both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. We found
that asymptomatic individuals displayed lower overall antibody levels than those observed
in COVID-19 symptomatic patients (Figure 3). A positive correlation between disease
severity and levels of IgG and IgM in acute and convalescent stages was also observed
(Fig 1C and 5A), in agreement with previous studies [6,35]. Another important issue is the
duration of IgM antibodies. Our longitudinal study using 93 infected individuals showed
that IgM levels wane in 60% of the cases within 30 days of SO (or first qPCR detection
for asymptomatic cases). However, IgM levels were still detected after 30 or even 60 days
in 40% of the cases, suggesting that IgM detection does not necessarily reflect a recent
infection.
Another important question is whether all infected individuals mount a robust antibody
response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this regard, we found antibodies in 90% of the
qPCR positive cases after 3 weeks of SO and, considering patients that were followed for
at least 45 days, the seroconversion rate reached 95%. Thus, at least 5% of infected
individuals resolved the infection with undetectable levels of antibodies. This observation
could be assigned to low antibody responses, below the detection limit, or to non-

responder individuals. In this regard, previous studies have shown the relevant role of T
cell responses in infection resolution [36,37].
Factors that affect the spread and dynamic of the virus in different geographic,
demographic, and socioeconomic areas are still unclear. Reliable reagents to perform
large and periodic serosurveys are urgently needed. Here, we provided a tool for using
whole blood by finger pricking, followed by IgG and IgM tests, to facilitate large sampling
together with a robust ELISA assay. This approach has been used in different
neighborhoods and defined at-risk populations in Argentina with SARS-CoV-2 prevalence
from less than 1 to more than 50% [28,29], supporting the convenience and utility of the
application.
It is important to stress the relevance of widely available quantitative serologic assays.
Passive antibody transfer is a treatment strategy that has been used for COVID-19,
including plasma and purified immunoglobulins derived from COVID-19 convalescent
donors. Although the efficacy of convalescent plasma treatment remains uncertain, recent
reports indicate a clinical benefit associated with high-titer units administered early in the
course of the infection [16]. In this regard, an important limitation has been to obtain
harmonized antibody titers information used in different clinical trials and therapeutic
applications. By tittering more than 500 convalescent plasma samples, we showed a
diversity of titers, which correlated with donor disease severity (Figure 5A). We provided
a standardized protocol, widely distributed and used in Argentina for quantitative IgG
measurements. A positive correlation between IgG quantitation, using COVIDAR, with
neutralizing activity measured by a pseudotyped virus was shown (Figure 5C). This
protocol has been useful to normalize quantifications at hospitals and heath institutions
using plasma for compassionate therapies and for different clinical trials [22,23]. Although
IgG titers correlated with neutralizing activities, the relevant open question is how they
correlate with protection [38,39].
While the pandemic still progresses, scientists, public health workers, and policy makers
are being challenged to create new strategies based on evidence and experiences in
different parts of the world. A consensus has emerged that serological testing provides
an essential tool in the pandemic response, nevertheless, serology testing strategies

should be dynamic and adaptable to specific needs and resources available in different
regions. Our work provides widely and freely available robust serology reagents,
protocols, and data on humoral responses of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals that
hopefully helps finding better control measures for the current pandemic.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
SARS-CoV-2 protein expression
The ectodomain, soluble version of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (residues 1−1208 of
GenBank: MN908947) including a T4 foldon trimerization domain, a GSAS substituted at
the furin cleavage site (residues 682–685), and an octahistidine tag was cloned into a
pCDNA mammalian expression vector. A SARS-CoV-2 version S-2P with substitutions at
986 and 987 was originally used. However, due to the difficulty of purifying the necessary
amount of spike protein for producing the ELISA plates, substitutions that increased
protein yields and stability were incorporated. In this regard, a variant with four additional
proline substitutions was generated, HexaPro variant, as recently described [40]. The
sequence of the receptor binding domain (RBD, amino acid 319 to 541, RVQP….CVNF)
along with the signal peptide (amino acid 1-14, MFVF….TSGS) plus a hexahistidine tag
was obtained from the Krammer laboratory [41] and subcloned into a pCDNA human
expression vector.
For protein expression, FreeStyle293-F (293-F) cells or adherent HEK293-T (293-T) cells
were maintained at 37ºC with 8% CO2 and 5% CO2, respectively. 293-F cells were grown
and transfected in Expi293TM expression medium and 293-T cells were grown in D-MEM
high glucose supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum and Penicillin/Streptomycin 1%

Protein purification
Culture supernatants were applied using a peristaltic pump to HisTrap excel columns (GE
Healthcare) with a flow rate of 2-3 ml/min, using 1 ml of media for each 100 ml of
supernatant. Columns were washed with 10 volumes of buffer A (NaH2PO4 57,5mM, NaCl
300 mM, pH 7.8) and next with 60 volumes of buffer A with 10 mM imidazol. Then,
columns were connected to an HPLC system (Kanuer) and washed at 2 ml/min with the
last buffer until absorbance at 280 nm reached a value below 0.005. Proteins were eluted
with a 12 minute linear gradient from 10 to 1 M imidazole in buffer A. Fractions of 1 ml
were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Buffer of fractions containing protein was
exchange to PBS with NAP-5 columns (GE Healthcare) and pooled. Typical yields were
around 6 and 45 mg/l for spike and RBD, respectively, with a purity level of at least 98 %.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays development
The ELISA protocol was adapted from previously established protocols used for Chagas
disease by Laboratorio Lemos S.R.L. [42], and for SARS-CoV2 by the Krammer
Laboratory [41]. Ninety-six well high binding plates (Jet Biofil, Guangzhou, China) were
coated overnight at 4°C with 75 ul per well of a solution containing 100 ng of a mixture of
full-length trimeric spike and RBD proteins in carbonate buffer, pH 9.6. The next day the
coating solution was removed by washing three times with phosphate-buffered saline
containing 0.05% Tween (PBS-T), pH 7.4. Serum samples diluted in PBS-T containing
0.8% casein were added to the wells (100 μl of a 1:100 dilution for IgM and 200 μl of a
1:50 dilution for IgG determination), and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. For end point titrations,
samples were serially diluted in IgG SARS-CoV-2 negative serum or fetal bovine serum
(FBS), added to the plates and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. Following a washing step with
PBS-T, 100 μl of diluted horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated with goat anti-human
IgM (Sigma), or with mouse anti-human IgG antibodies (BD pharmingen), was added to
the wells and incubated for 30 min. at 37°C. Subsequently, the plates were washed with
PBS-T, and the peroxidase reaction was visualized by incubating the plates with 100 μl
of TMB solution for 30 min at 37°C. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of 1M
sulfuric acid, and optical densities (OD) were immediately measured at 450 nm. For whole
blood analysis, 50 μl of blood were preserved in collecting tubes containing 90 μl of

buffered glycerin from the Serokit system [26]. Stored samples were then diluted in PBST containing 0.8% casein for quantification of IgG or IgM levels.
Serum and plasma samples
Human plasma and serum samples were obtained from a number of different sources
following the subsequent inclusion criteria: people aged over 16 years, of any sex who
presented a diagnosis of infection or suspected of SARS COVID-19 infection in acute or
convalescent phase. Confirmed or suspected cases met the criteria of The National
Ministry of Health of Argentina (https://www.argentina.gob.ar/salud/coronavirus-COVID19/definicion-de-caso). De-identified samples from the following health institutions were
received: BioBanco de Enfermedades Infecciosas (BBEI), Centro de Educación Médica
e Investigaciones Clínicas “Norberto Quirno” sede Saavedra (CEMIC), Hospital de
Clínicas José de San Martín, Hospital de Infecciosas Fransisco Javier Muñiz, Hospital
General de Agudos Dr. I. Pirovano, Hospital General de Agudos Parmenio Piñero,
Hospital Italiano, Hospital Militar Central Cirujano Mayor Dr. Cosme Argerich, Hospital
Naval Dr. Pedro Mallo, Hospital Universitario Austral, Hospital Sirio Libanes, Sanatorio
de La Trinidad Mitre, Sanatorio Dr. Julio Méndez, Sanatorio Franchin, Sanatorio Güemes
and Swiss Medical.
A pre-pandemic serum panel of samples selected based on the date of collection (July
and September 2019) was provided by the Blood Bank of the Hospital de Clínicas José
de San Martín. Positive and negative controls were donated from the CEMIC blood bank.
Longitudinal studies were performed using samples from de-identified patients from
Sanatorio de La Trinidad Mitre and Hospital de Clínicas José de San Martín (n=118).
Samples were taken every 2 to 4 days until the patient was discharged from the hospital.
Additional samples were collected when patient assisted for controls. Samples were
collected between 1 to 90, or more days, of SO.
Asymptomatic patients identified by contact tracing of COVID-19 positive patients were
obtained from BBEI COVID-19 collection, Hospital de Clínicas José de San Martín,
Sanatorio de La Trinidad Mitre and Swiss Medical. Paired whole blood and serum
samples used for Serokit validation were obtained from the BBEI COVID19 collection.

The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and was
reviewed and approved by the Bioethics Committee of Fundación Instituto Leloir (HHS
IRB # 00007572) (CBFIL Protocol #35). All participants provided written informed consent
prior to the study. As for participants under 18, informed consent was not obtained since
samples were de-identified.
Sample collection and processing were performed from April 2020 to September 2020.
Neutralization assay
Neutralization assays were carried out with SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped particles
(CoV2pp), generated in Benhur Lee’s laboratory [31]. CoV2pp carries vesicular stomatitis
virus as viral backbone, bearing the Renilla luciferase gene in place of its G glycoprotein
(VSV∆G-rLuc), and expresses SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein on its envelope.
ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expressing 293T cells (293T-ACE2+TMPRSS2 clone F8-2), were
used for these assays [31]. Cells were maintained with DMEM high glucose with 10%
FBS and were seeded in a 96-well plate the day before infection.
Patient sera were heat inactivated at 56ºC for 30 minutes and serially diluted in DMEM
high glucose with 10% FBS. Serum neutralizations were performed by first diluting the
inactivated sample 8-folds and continuing with a 2-fold serial dilution. A pre-titrated
amount of pseudotyped particles (diluted to give approximately 5x105 Relative
Luminescent Units) was incubated with a 2-fold serial dilution of patient sera for 30
minutes at room temperature prior to infection. Approximately 20 hours post-infection
cells were processed for detection of luciferase activity. Cells were lysed and transferred
to white, F-bottom 750 Lumitrac plates (Greiner, 655074). Plates were read via the
GloMax® Navigator Microplate Luminometer (Promega, GM200) using the Nano-Glo®
Luciferase Assay System (Promega, 752 E6110).
Absolute inhibitory concentrations (absIC) values were calculated for all patient sera
samples by modeling a 4-parameter logistic (4PL) regression with GraphPad Prism 8.
The 4PL model describes the sigmoid-shaped response pattern. For clarity, it is assumed
that the response can be expressed so that the slope increases as the concentration
increase. Absolute inhibitory concentration (absIC) was calculated as the corresponding

point between the 0% and 100% assay controls. Fifty % and 80% inhibition were defined
by the controls for all the samples on the same plate. For example, the absIC50 or
absIC80 would be the point at which the curve matches inhibition equal to exactly 50%
or 80% of the 100% assay control relative to the assay minimum.
