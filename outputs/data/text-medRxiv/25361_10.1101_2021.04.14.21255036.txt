KEY POINTS

Question. Do test-based programs reduce SARS-CoV-2 risk in K-12 schools?

Findings. Weekly school-based saliva PCR testing at three urban public schools doubled case
detection among staff and students over symptom-based strategies, exceeding county-level case
rates. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in school wastewater samples each week, as well as air and
surface samples related to choir classrooms.

Meaning. Routine SARS-CoV-2 testing removes infected staff and students from school who are
not identified through conventional case detection. With rigorous infection control and
environmental monitoring, this helps mitigate risk during school operations. Furthermore,
screening in K-12 schools may provide insight into disease burdens of undertested communities.

ABSTRACT

Importance. Scalable programs for school-based SARS-CoV-2 testing and surveillance are
needed to guide in-person learning practices and inform risk assessments in K-12 settings.

Objectives. To characterize SARS-CoV-2 infections in staff and students in an urban public
school setting and evaluate test-based strategies to support ongoing risk assessment and
mitigation for K-12 in-person learning.

Design, Setting, and Participants. The pilot program engaged three schools for weekly saliva
PCR testing of staff and students participating in in-person learning over a 5-week period.
Wastewater, air, and surface samples were collected weekly and tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA to
determine surrogacy for case detection and interrogate transmission risk of in-building activities.

Main Outcomes and Measures. SARS-CoV-2 detection in saliva and environmental samples and
risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Results. 2,885 supervised self-collected saliva samples were tested from 773 asymptomatic staff
and students during November and December, 2020. 46 cases (22 students, 24 staff) were
detected, representing a 5.8- and 2.5-fold increase in case detection rates among students and
staff, respectively, compared to conventional reporting mechanisms. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was
detected in wastewater samples from all pilot schools, as well as in air samples collected from
two choir rooms. Sequencing of 21 viral genomes in saliva specimens demonstrated minimal

clustering associated with one school. Geographic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 cases reported
district-wide demonstrated higher community risk in zip codes proximal to the pilot schools.

Conclusions and Relevance. Weekly screening of asymptomatic staff and students by saliva PCR
testing dramatically increased SARS-CoV-2 case detection in an urban public-school setting,
exceeding infection rates reported at the county level. Experiences differed among schools, and
virus sequencing and geographic analyses suggest a dynamic interplay of school-based and
community-derived transmission risk. Environmental testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in air and
surface samples enabled real-time risk assessment of in-school activities and allowed for
interventions in choir classes. Wastewater testing demonstrated the utility of school buildinglevel SARS-CoV-2 surveillance. Collectively, these findings provide insight into the
performance and community value of test-based SARS-CoV-2 screening and surveillance
strategies in the K-12 educational setting.

MAIN TEXT
Introduction
During the fall and winter of 2020 most Northern Hemisphere countries experienced their most
severe COVID-19 epidemic waves to date. While many factors may have contributed to the
acceleration of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the fall, the return of children and young adults to
congregate school settings was temporally associated with the initiation of increased community
transmission. Overall, direct data demonstrating transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among schoolaged children within communities remain limited.1 Many experts and public health authorities
have urged communities to resume full-time in-person learning, citing the absence of schoolassociated case clusters and the lower rate of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis
among school-age children versus adults.2,3,4 Yet, despite lower rates of confirmed infections in
children and adolescents, serological surveys suggest current symptom-based testing
and tracing likely miss a large proportion of disease, especially in children and
adolescents.5 Data through November 2020 from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) COVID-19 serological survey revealed that persons aged 0-17 had the highest
proportion of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies of any age group in 23 of 28 (82%) states providing
data.6 Outbreaks of COVID-19 in schools have been well-documented,7 including a large
outbreak in a school in Israel that resulted in student and staff attack rates of 13% and 17%
respectively.8
To promote safe school-environments, the World Health Organization (WHO), U.S. CDC
and other health policy centers have recommended combining interventions such as physical
distancing, the wearing of face masks, enhanced environmental cleaning, and use of physical
barriers to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.9,10 Many U.S. school systems have

chosen to use virtual or hybrid education models, rather than full-density in-person schooling. In
developing risk mitigation plans, public health professionals and school administrators have been
forced to weigh incomplete data characterizing COVD-19 school risks with harms of suspending
in-person educational services. To make better decisions, school officials require an improved
understanding of COVID-19 burden in the households relevant to schools and greater
characterization of in-school transmission risks. Additionally, regular testing to rapidly identify
students or staff who are a risk for transmitting COVID-19 may significantly reduce the risk of
outbreaks centered in schools, enable more effective learning environments, and ultimately slow
community transmission. As SARS-CoV-2 variants expand in the U.S. and the length of
protective immunity remains uncertain, these needs persist into the 2021-2 school year as well as
future respiratory disease emergencies.

The University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) and Omaha Public Schools (OPS)
partnered to launch the PROactive TEsting for Community Transmission of SARS-COV-2
(OPS PROTECTS) pilot project in November 2020 to demonstrate the feasibility of a schoolbased COVID-19 testing program. The OPS PROTECTS pilot investigated the integration of
individual case detection through saliva testing with school-level wastewater monitoring and inbuilding air and surface sampling for SARS-CoV-2 RNA – approaches that have not yet been
described in the K-12 educational setting. The pilot sought to comprehensively assess SARSCoV-2 infection and transmission risk in three pilot schools to demonstrate the feasibility
of expanding to additional schools during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods
Pilot program setting
The Omaha Public School district is comprised of 82 primary and secondary schools, roughly 20
programs, and more than 53,000 students and 9,200 school-based staff. Two middle schools and
one high school in a medically underserved sector of the Omaha metropolitan area were selected
to participate in the pilot program with the goal of maximizing the benefit of early program
implementation. During the Fall 2020 semester, all schools in the district were operating under a
hybrid instructional model with alternating cohorts for remote and optional in-person learning
with 50-60% of students opting for in-person learning. District-wide policies to mitigate SARSCoV-2 transmission risk include the utilization of in-building face coverings, six-foot social
distancing, and heightened handwashing and cleaning protocols. The five-week pilot program
took place from November 9-December 11, 2020.

Saliva SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing for asymptomatic case detection
Electronic registration and consent for saliva testing was performed with the Nebraska
University Laboratory Information Reporting Tool (NULirt) software platform. Staff
participation was mandated by the school district while student participation was
optional. Supervised self-collections of saliva were performed at mobile collection stations in
each school twice weekly to accommodate alternating cohorts of students present for in-person
learning at either the beginning of the week (i.e., students whose last names began with A
through K) or at the end of the week (i.e., students whose last name began with L though
Z). Trained volunteers supervised collections according to current CDC guidance.11 Staff testing
began during the first week of the pilot and student testing began during the second week. Saliva

was collected using half-length plastic straws (S.P. Richards Co, Atlanta, GA) and 1.5mL
collection tubes (Eppendorf Co, Hamburg, Germany).
Saliva SARS-CoV-2 testing was performed by the CLIA-certified Emerging Pathogens
Laboratory at UNMC using a multiplex, qualitative, real-time, reverse transcription (RT)-PCR
assay adapted from the SalivaDirect™ protocol.12,13 Via NUlirt, test results were securely linked
to the electronic medical record, public health databases, and individual
results were securely emailed to participants. Individuals with a positive test result were isolated
from in-person activities for ten days and contacted by a healthcare provider to offer access to
counseling and clinical services.

School facility wastewater testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA
Wastewater grab samples were collected twice weekly from near-source outflow locations that
conveyed wastewater from each of the three pilot schools. Grabs samples were collected
between (11:00-13:00) from manholes adjacent to the buildings on school grounds. At each
sampling event, 250 mL of raw wastewater was collected in a sterile polypropylene container for
SARS-CoV-2 molecular analysis and 250 mL of raw wastewater was collected in a non-sterile
polypropylene container for conventional wastewater analyses. All samples were held at 4°C
after collection and were transported to UNMC or UNL laboratories within 2 hours of collection,
where they were held at -20°C until RT-PCR analysis for SARS-CoV-2 using the IDT 2019nCoV RUO kit (IDT, 10006713).

Weekly air and surface sampling was performed in each pilot school at five sites per school that
were assessed to be at higher risk for virus aerosol exposure, including band and choir rooms,
cafeterias, language teaching classrooms, high-traffic hallways, restrooms, and school entry
areas. Air samples were collected using AirAnswers (Inspirotec1, Chicago, Il., USA) air
samplers14 which collect particles by electrostatic precipitation. This sampler does not use a
pump or blower to pull air into the sampler, minimizing noise disruption in the school
environment. Electrostatic precipitation has been used in the collection of a variety of airborne
particulate15,16 including viruses.17 Surface samples were collected on doors leading into each of
the air sampling spaces. Extracted samples were analyzed by RT-PCR for the SARS-CoV-2 E
gene as previously described.18

Demographic and statistical analyses
Metadata associated with SARS-CoV-2 test results included collection location and date, school,
status as student or staff, zip code of residence, grade in school for students, main teaching
activity or occupation role for staff, and participation in band and choir. Non-pilot program cases
among students were identified through school-level designated absentee reports. Staff non-pilot
program cases were identified through self-report to the school district. Background community
COVID-19 rates were obtained via the Douglas County Health Department, Nebraska on-line
dashboard.21

Results
Saliva testing program metrics and participant demographics
Registration and consent numbers for staff and students over the five-week program period are
shown in eFigure 1. 2,885 saliva samples were tested from 773 participants [2,163 tests from 455
(96%) school-based staff and 722 tests from 315 (12%) students enrolled for in-person learning].
Both students and staff were ethnically diverse, and >89% of student households were eligible
for financial assistance (Table 1). 340 volunteer shifts were filled over the course of the program
to supervise saliva collection (approximately 60 person-hours per school each week). Almost all
(99.4%) saliva samples met laboratory acceptability criteria and yielded valid test results with an
average turnaround time of less than 5 hours from receipt in the laboratory to reporting results.

SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic case detection by weekly saliva testing
Forty-six total cases (24 staff, 22 students) were detected through weekly saliva PCR testing of
asymptomatic individuals. The pilot program more than doubled cases identified among staff,
and nearly doubled cases identified among students (eFigure 2). Cumulative case rates detected
by saliva testing among pilot program participants substantially exceeded case rates detected by
conventional reporting mechanisms among students and staff registered for in-person school
activities over the same time period at the pilot schools (students: 70/1000 vs 12/1000, staff:
53/1000 vs 21/1000; Figure 1). Weekly case detection rates by saliva PCR across all pilot
schools ranged from 10 to 52 cases per 1000 (1 to 5.2%) students and 8 to 17 cases per 1000 (0.8
to 1.7%) staff (Figure 2). The majority of staff cases were detected within a week interval from
their last negative test, while half of student cases were detected at two to three weeks from their
last negative test indicating less consistent student participation (eFigure 3). Fifteen of seventeen

(88%) PCR positive individuals who participated in re-testing tested negative on their first test
following a 10-day isolation period.

SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in school facility wastewater and in-building environmental
samples
SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected by RT-PCR in wastewater grab samples from School A and
School B facilities during all five weeks of the pilot, and at School C for the first three weeks of
the pilot (Figure 2). Weekly wastewater testing detected SARS-CoV-2 in 12/14 (86%) individual
school-weeks for which SARS-CoV-2 was detected in students or staff by saliva testing.
In-building air and surface samples were collected from five sampling sites in each pilot school
during four weeks of the pilot program (60 total paired samples). A subset of air samples (2/60;
3.3%) and surface samples (1/60; 1.7%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR. The
positive air samples were collected from School A and School B choir rooms, and the positive
surface swab was collected in the School B choir room (Figure 2; eTable 1).

Virus whole-genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2-positive saliva samples
SARS-CoV-2 genomes from positive saliva samples were sequenced to investigate transmission
chains within cases identified by our testing program. We obtained high-coverage viral
genomes from 21 of 46 cases and generated phylogenetic trees using the available
Nebraska SARS-CoV-2 genomes from GISAID (177genomes). Most (17/ 21) SARS-CoV2 genomes did not cluster together but were widely spread across the tree, indicating that these
cases were the result of separate transmission chains (Figure 3). We observed two clustering
events with samples from School A (highlighted in Figure 3), between two staff (CSSCH003 and

CSSCH016, identical genomes) and two students (CSSCH033 and CSSCH042,
one nucleotide difference). Clear epidemiologic links between the clustered genomes beyond
school attendance was not identified; however, the timing of case identification was compatible
with linked transmission events.

School-based risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection
Participation in school activities (choir and band), school attended, school grade, and staff
position were evaluated as risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection as detected by saliva PCR
testing during the pilot program (eTable 1). School attended was a significant determinant for
positive test results in logistic regression models (p = 0.0063). School A (high school) students
and staff were more likely than School B and C (middle schools) to test positive [3.3 (p=0.009)
and 2.2 (p=0.03), respectively). Schools B and C case rates were similar.
Students in choir were 2.8 times as likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 than other
students when adjusting for school attended, though with borderline statistical significance
(p=0.052); unadjusted significance was less (p=0.19). Serial case counts among students
participating in choir were assessed following the positive air samples in choir rooms during
week one of the pilot (eFigure 4). Amplification of case counts in serial weeks was not observed.
Broadly, the category of staff position was not significantly associated with SARS-CoV-2
testing results. However, business teachers in the pilot (n=7) were 28.5 times as likely to test
positive for SARS-CoV-2 than other staff (p<0.0001).
Geographic distribution of district-wide COVID-19 cases reported among staff and students
Weekly case rates detected by saliva testing in the pilot schools exceeded county-level case rates
identified through conventional testing means over the same time period by a log. We sought to

better understand the role of localized community case burden in these findings. In preliminary
bivariate analyses, zip code of residence did not achieve statistical significance as a factor
associated with saliva SARS-CoV-2 test result for either students or staff at the pilot schools. To
contextualize the pilot schools within the district, Figure 4 demonstrates the distribution of cases
by zip code of residence in students and staff across the entire Omaha Public School district,
either through self-report or district-managed occupational screening separate from the pilot
program. Student case counts were highest in a South Omaha zip code with 66 cases during the
pilot period, demonstrating higher case burden in the community sector where the pilot schools
are located.

Discussion
OPS PROTECTS represents a feasible, scalable, and novel approach to integrated, test-based
SARS-CoV-2 screening and environmental monitoring in a K-12 educational setting. Our pilot
schools are located in a traditionally underserved area of Omaha; students at these schools
predominantly identify within racial and ethnic minority groups and qualify for financial
assistance. Students and staff living in zip codes near these schools experienced a heavy burden
of COVID-19 cases as reported in school district-wide case tracking. Weekly saliva PCR
markedly increased case finding and the removal of potential opportunities for viral
transmission. Additionally, when compared to conventional reporting in our setting (passive case
finding), our results suggest that as many as 9 in 10 student COVID-19 cases and 7 in 10 staff
COVID-19 cases may be missed by conventional reporting mechanisms. Together with striking
differences between pilot program and observed community case rates, this kind of programming
can be expected to assist in mitigating school-based transmission risk through informing case

isolation, contact tracing, and management of school activities and serve as a trigger to escalate
community-based surveillance in underserved communities, particularly in school-aged children.

The pilot program demonstrated successful implementation of school-based SARS-CoV-2
testing through supervised self-collection of saliva. While trained volunteers from local health
professions colleges supervised saliva collections during the pilot program, we found that
responsibility for collection processes could be successfully transferred to school staff allowing
for more sustainable and integrated operations during program expansion. Self-collected saliva
samples from students and staff yielded a high rate of valid test results, indicating reliable
specimen quality despite not restricting intake of food or drink prior to collection. The use of
non-specialized collection materials (e.g. common plastic straws rather than saliva collection
aids) and a high-throughput adaptation of the SalivaDirectTM extraction-free RT-PCR method
minimized cost and supply chain challenges while also facilitating same-day reporting.

To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first description of building-level
environmental testing for SARS-CoV-2 in K-12 schools. Wastewater monitoring for SARSCoV-2 RNA by twice-weekly grab sampling was generally consistent with the detection of
SARS-CoV-2 infections by saliva testing, indicating the utility of this approach for school
building-level monitoring of virus shedding. However, two wastewater collections (School C,
weeks 4 and 5) yielded negative results while the schools still had persons with positive saliva
tests. This highlights the need to continue to pursue optimal wastewater collection practices for
population monitoring. Time-distributed composite samples collected with autosampler
installations may increase sensitivity but add cost and infrastructure requirements. Wastewater

monitoring by grab sampling and automated composite sampling will be further explored as
distributable school surveillance tools for identification of SARS-CoV-2 transmission hotspots.
Ultimately, wastewater and other environmental monitoring may allow for more resourceintensive individual screening to be prioritized, a strategy that has been successfully pursued in
university housing22,23 and nursing home24 settings.

Air and surface sampling within school buildings for SARS-CoV-2 RNA provides insight into
virus dispersion associated with school activities. In our pilot program, positive air and surface
samples were detected in the choir rooms of two schools during the first week of the program.
These findings suggest that measures to reduce virus dispersion in the school environment—
including mask wearing, hand hygiene, and cleaning protocols—did not fully mitigate risk
associated with choir. Choir-associated COVID-19 outbreaks have been described25,26 and we
observed a trend toward increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among students participating in
choir in our pilot program. The transmission risk of other specialized school activities warrants
further evaluation. For example, our initial findings suggest a higher risk for infection in teachers
associated with computer labs, and we will pursue focused environmental testing in computer
labs in the next phase of the program.

Although our findings confirm that incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in schools greatly
exceeded what was observed through conventional case finding, our data do not permit firm
conclusions about comparative incidence or transmission events within schools. Genomic
sequencing identified potential transmission links among students and staff in two clusters at
School A, but virus from saliva samples in our pilot mostly demonstrated a mix of multiple

disparate transmission chains compatible with broader community transmission. Our highest
weekly incidence for students (Week 4) was over seven times the reported weekly community
incidence for Douglas County (week of Nov 30th), and the incidence in School A was 14-fold
higher. However, our schools are located in communities that experienced higher incidence and
where limiting testing access may accentuate under-ascertainment of cases. It is also the case that
our schools were operating at one-quarter normal classroom densities so our results may
underestimate the risk of in-school transmission for schools operating at more normal density.
Regardless, our observations emphasize the variable risk landscape between schools and the
importance of school-based testing strategies to identify school settings and activities with higher
transmission risk.

Higher student participation would allow a better understanding of case rates within schools,
demographic risk groups among students and staff, and correlation with wastewater and inbuilding environmental testing strategies. Time intervals for test conversion indicate that
promoting consistent student participation, in addition to raising student consent rates, will
improve timely detection and isolation of new cases. The PROTECTS pilot schools have a
relatively restricted geographic distribution of residence among both students and staff. This may
have attenuated the ability of the pilot to discern residence as an independent risk factor.

Figure 1: Cumulative SARS-CoV-2 case rates detected by weekly saliva PCR compared to
conventional reporting during the pilot program period. For asymptomatic saliva PCR, rates
are among pilot program participants; for conventional reporting, rates are among individuals
participating in in-person school activities.

Figure 2: SARS-CoV-2 detected by saliva testing and environmental surveillance methods.
Cases represent those detected by weekly saliva PCR testing.

Figure 3: Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequences from saliva specimens collected
at pilot schools. Clustered samples are shaded in grey.

Figure 4: Geographic distribution of home residences linked to COVID-19 cases reported
for staff and students across the school district. Circle size denotes relative number of cases
reported by zip code.

eFigure 1. Cumulative registrations and consents over the pilot program period. Consent
for testing as well as consent for treatment and ancillary clinical services was required for
program participation. Student participation was limited by a high number of declinations for
consent to treatment and/or ancillary clinical services.
