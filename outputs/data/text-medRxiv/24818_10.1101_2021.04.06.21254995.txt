ABSTRACT

24

The performance of a laboratory-developed quantitative IgG/IgA flow cytometry-based

25

immunoassay (FCI) using Jurkat T cells stably expressing full-length native S protein

26

was compared against Elecsys® electrochemiluminiscent (ECLIA) Anti-SARS-CoV-2

27

S (Roche Diagnostics, Pleasanton, CA, USA), and LIAISON® SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS

28

IgG chemiluminiscent assay (CLIA) (Diasorin S.p.a, Saluggia, IT) for detection and

29

quantitation of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. A total of 225 serum/plasma

30

specimens from 120 acute or convalescent COVID-19 individuals were included.

31

Overall, IgG/IgA-FCI yielded the highest number of positives (n=179), followed by

32

IgA-FCI (n=177), Roche ECLIA (n=175), IgG-FCI (n=172) and Diasorin CLIA

33

(n=154). Positive percent agreement between FCI and compared immunoassays was

34

highest for Roche ECLIA, ranging from 96.1% (IgG/IgA-FCI) to 97.7% (IgG-FCI),

35

whereas negative percent agreement was higher between FCI and Diasosin CLIA,

36

regardless of antibody isotype. A strong correlation (Rho:0.6-0.8) was found between

37

IgG-FCI or IgA-FCI levels and antibodies quantified by Roche ECLIA and Diasorin

38

CLIA. The trajectory of antibody levels delineated by the different immunoassays in 22

39

of patients with sequential specimens (≥3) was frequently discordant, with the exception

40

of IgG and IgA determined by FCI assay and to a lesser extent antibodies quantified by

41

Roche ECLIA and Diasorin CLIA. The data suggest that FCI may outperform Roche

42

ECLIA and Diasorin CLIA in terms of clinical sensitivity for serological diagnosis of

43

SARS-CoV-2 infection.

INTRODUCTION

47

SARS-CoV-2 serological assays enable us to identify individuals infected either

48

recently or in the past, assess humoral immune responses elicited by SARS-CoV-2

49

vaccines and infer level of susceptibility to reinfection or primary infection in vaccinees

50

(1,2). Among SARS-CoV-2 structural components, Spike protein (S) elicits the most

51

potent neutralizing antibodies, which are crucially involved in protecting against SARS-

52

CoV-2 infection (3,4). The S protein, which is assembled into trimers in the viral

53

membrane, interacts with angiotensin converting enzyme type 2 receptor (ACE2)

54

through the receptor-binding domain (RBD) (5). Binding of RBD to ACE2 promotes

55

cleavage of S into S1 and S2, and exposure of the fusion peptide located within S2,

56

which eventually leads to cellular and viral membrane fusion (5). A large number of

57

immunoassays using recombinant RBD, S1 or S2 subunits or full-length monomeric S

58

protein as the binding antigen and returning either qualitative or semiquantitative results

59

have been developed, evaluated in different studies and found to exhibit variable

60

sensitivity and specificity (see 1,2,6,7 for review). A new generation of recently

61

launched commercially-available SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays detect antibodies

62

binding to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein in its native (trimeric) conformation or RBD and

63

offer quantitative estimates of antibody levels (8-11), and preliminary results show

64

increased sensitivity for detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, as well as reliable

65

estimates of serum neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2. In this context, a

66

quantitative flow cytometry-based immunoassay (FCI) has been developed employing

67

Jurkat T cells stably expressing the full-length native S protein, which is reported to be

68

highly specific and display greater sensitivity than various comparative immunoassays

69

targeting recombinant RBD or S subunit proteins (12). Here, we evaluated the

70

performance of this FCI against two new-generation immunoassays: Elecsys® Anti3

PATIENTS AND METHODS

75

Patients and specimens. The current retrospective study was carried out using

76

cryopreserved (-20ºC) serum or plasma samples collected from the following four

77

groups: (I) Convalescent COVID-19 patients, as clinically (13) and microbiologically

78

documented by RT-PCR (14), who had been admitted to different hospital wards and

79

eventually released. A total of 60 specimens from 35 patients, drawn at a median of 60

80

days (range, 8–141 days) since symptoms onset were included; (II) Acute COVID-19

81

patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). A total of 115 specimens from 40

82

patients, collected at a median of 16 days (range, 2–43 days) after onset of symptoms

83

were included; (III) Acute or convalescent COVID-19 subjects (n=45) who tested

84

negative by rapid lateral flow immunoassay–LFIC– (INNOVITA 2019nCoV Ab Test;

85

Beijing Innovita Biological Technology, China), or CLIA (LIAISON® SARS-CoV-2

in use in our laboratory at the time of sample collection and routine testing. A total 50

89

specimens from this group, collected at a median of 44 days after onset of symptoms

90

(range, 11–91) were included, of which 13 specimens tested negative by LFIC, 34

91

returned negative results by LIAISON assay and 7 by MAGLUMI assay; and (IV) Pre-

92

96

Flow cytometry native SARS-CoV-2 S assay. FCI was carried out at the Hematology

97

Department of Hospital General Universitario, Alicante, Spain, as previously described

98

in detail (12). Briefly, transfected human Jurkat T-cell line (clone E6-1) stably

99

expressing both the full-length native SARS-CoV-2 S protein and a truncated version of

100

the human Epidermal growth factor receptor (huEGFRt) were used as the binding

101

antigens (S-Jurkat). Non-transfected Jurkat cells (0-Jutkat) were used as controls. For

102

each individual assay, a mixture of 50,000 0-Jurkat and 150,000 S-Jurkat cells was

103

made in a single tube. Sera were diluted 1:50 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)

104

containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.02% sodium azide and incubated

105

with the cell mixture for 30 min on ice. The cells were then spun down, washed with

106

PBS-BSA and stained with mouse anti-human IgG-PerCP Jackson ImmunoResearch¸

107

Cambridgeshire, UK), anti-human IgA-Alexa Fluor 647 (Jackson ImmunoResearch)

108

and anti-human EGFR (BV421) (Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA). Samples were then

109

washed and acquired on an Omnicyt flow cytometer (Cytognos S.L, Salamanca, Spain).

110

A minimum of 50,000 viable events, discarding doublets and debris, were considered

111

for the analyses. IgG or IgA antibodies bound to S proteins were identified by

112

comparing the median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the S-Jurkat and the 0-Jurkat

113

cells in each sample. We established the difference between S-Jurkat and 0-Jurkat cells

114

using the normalized MFI-ratio between EGFR and both antibody isotypes (IgG MFI-

115

ratio and IgA MFI-ratio respectively). Data were analyzed using Infinicyt 2.0 software

116

(Cytognos S.L.). Samples were considered positive for IgG or IgA when the normalized

117

difference was ≥ 1.

120

electrochemiluminescence sandwich immunoassay (ECLIA) that quantifies total (IgG

and IgM) antibodies directed against RBD, was run on cobas® e601 modular analyzer

122

(Roche Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). The assay is calibrated with the first WHO

123

International Standard and Reference Panel for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody (15). The

124

limit of detection of the assay is 0.4 U/ml and its quantification range is between 0.8

125

and 250.0 U/mL. Specimens yielding values >250 U/ml were diluted 1/10 and re-

126

assayed. LIAISON® SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS IgG assay (Diasorin S.p.a, Saluggia,

127

Italy), run on a DiaSorin LIAISON platform (DiaSorin, Stillwater, USA), measured IgG

128

antibodies against a trimeric S-protein antigen. Samples yielding <13 AU/ml were

129

considered negative. According to the manufacturer, the upper quantification limit of

130

the assay is 800 AU/mL. Both assays were performed at the Microbiology Service at the

131

Hospital Clínico Universitario, Valencia, Spain, following the instructions of the

132

respective manufacturers.

133

Statistical methods. Positive and negative percent agreement (PPA and NPA,

respectively) between immunoassays were calculated using a diagnostic 2x2 test.

135

Cohen’s Kappa statistics was used to assess the degree of concordance between

136

qualitative results provided by the immunoassays and interpreted as previously

137

recommended (16). The Spearman’s rank test was used to assess the correlation

138

between continuous variables using the entire dataset (i.e. individuals with single and

139

repeated measurements). Two-sided exact P values were reported. A P value <0.05 was

140

considered statistically significant. The analyses were performed using SPSS version

141

20.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).

RESULTS

143

Specificity of the Flow cytometry-based SARS-CoV-2 S immunoassay. In the

144

current study, FCI was multiplexed for quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and

145

IgA isotypes. Previously published data (12) found detection and quantitation of SARS-

146

CoV-2-S-binding IgM to be less consistent and reliable. To evaluate the specificity of

147

FCI, a total of 100 pre-pandemic sera collected from blood donors were assayed. None

148

of these sera gave a positive signal on the FCI assay.

149

Overall agreement between qualitative results provided by the immunoassays.

150

When combining specimens from all three groups of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients,

151

we found that IgG/IgA-FCI yielded the highest number of positives (n=179), closely

152

followed by IgA-FCI (n=177), Roche ECLIA (n=175), and IgG-FCI (n=172) (Table 1).

153

Diasorin CLIA returned a substantially lower number of positive results (n=154) than

154

the former platforms. A subanalysis was next conducted including only sera (n=50) that

155

scored negative by LFIC or CLIA assays routinely used at our laboratory at the time of

156

testing request. As shown in Table 2, FCI (either IgG, IgA or IgG/IgA) yielded a greater

157

number of positive results than Roche ECLIA or Diasorin CLIA.

158

Overall, PPA between FCI and the immunoassay compared was highest for Roche

159

ECLIA, ranging from 96.1% (IgG/IgA-FCI) to 97.7% (IgG-FCI) (Table 3), whereas

160

NPA was overall greater between FCI and Diasosin CLIA, regardless of the antibody

161

isotype detected (91.4% to 97.2%). Inter-rater agreement between FCI (either IgG, IgA

162

or IgG/IgA) and Roche ECLIA was strong (k=>0.8), while it was only moderate with

163

Diasorin CLIA (k=>0.6-<0.8). Inter-rater agreement between results returned by Roche

164

ECLIA and Diasorin CLIA was also moderate (k=0.76).

165

Correlation between antibody levels measured by the immunoassays under

166

comparison. A strong correlation (Rho ranging between 0.6 and 0.8) was found

167

between IgG-FCI, IgA-FCI levels and total antibodies quantified by Roche ECLIA

168

(Figure 1A and 1B, respectively) and IgG measured by Diasorin CLIA (Figure 1C and

169

1D, respectively).

170

Kinetics of antibody levels measured by different immunoassays. A total of 22

171

patients belonging to groups I and II had three or more sequential sera available for

172

kinetic analyses. Trajectories of antibody levels delineated by the different

173

immunoassays were categorized as either ascending, descending, ascending to a peak

174

then descending, or fluctuating. As displayed in Table 4, congruent trajectories were

175

seen more frequently for IgG-FCI and IgA-FCI, followed by IgG-FCI or IgA-FCI and

176

IgG measured by Diasorin CLIA. Concordant trajectories were observed commonly for

177

antibodies quantified by Roche ECLIA and Diasorin CLIA; surprisingly, congruent

178

trajectories were seldom seen for IgG or IgA-FCI and total antibodies measured by

179

Roche ECLIA. Fig. 2 exemplifies concordant (2A-D) or divergent (2E-H) antibody

180

trajectories as delineated by the different immunoassays.

DISCUSSION

182

In this study we compared the performance of an in-house-developed quantitative FCI

183

(12) with the SARS-CoV-2 trimericS-IgG CLIA from Diasorin and Roche RBD-

184

specific IgG/IgM antibody ECLIA for serological diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection

185

in patients with either acute or convalescent COVID-19. All three assays have been

186

reported to measure serum/plasma antibody levels that correlate with those quantified

187

by virus neutralization assays, using either wild type SARS-CoV-2 or lentiviral-S-

188

pseudotyped virions (8-12). Of note, only Roche ECLIA is calibrated to the first WHO

189

International Standard and Reference Panel for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody (15). By

190

using a large number of pre-pandemic sera we found the specificity of FCI to be 100%,

191

in agreement with a previous estimate (12). Nevertheless, it must be stressed that we are

192

not certain that sera from individuals with past seasonal coronavirus infection were

193

represented in the panel. The pre-pandemic sera was not run with Roche ECLIA and

194

Diasorin CLIA, and 100% specificity was assumed for both Roche ECLIA as stated by

195

the manufacturer, and Diasorin CLIA as recently reported (9). The main findings of the

196

current study can be summarized as follows. First, direct comparison between IgG-FCI

197

and Diasorin CLIA is biologically straightforward since both assays employ native

198

SARS-CoV-2 S protein as the binding antigen and target the same antibody isotype.

199

Notwithstanding this, both PPA and NPA were below 92% and inter-rater agreement

200

between immunoassays was only moderate (k=0.69). Moreover, correlation between

201

SARS-CoV-2 S IgG levels quantified by both immunoassays was strong (Rho=0.69),

202

but certainly not as strong as anticipated. The lack of full concordance between the

203

results provided by the two assays may relate to subtle differences in the conformation

204

of the binding S protein: whereas in Diasorin CLIA the S protein bound to solid phase

205

exhibits a stable native trimeric conformation, both trimeric and monomeric versions of

206

the S protein were found to be displayed on the surface of transfected Jurkat T cells

207

(12). Furthermore, since SARS-CoV-2-S IgA responses can be documented in the

208

absence of detectable SARS-CoV-2-S IgGs (17), it was not unexpected to observe that

209

PPA decreased whereas NPA increased when IgA FCI results were considered for the

210

analyses, either individually or in combination with IgG ones. Second, despite the fact

211

that Roche ECLIA measures total antibodies (IgG and IgM) binding to the RBD domain

212

of S1 subunit protein instead of the native full-length S protein, we found excellent PPA

213

between the results returned by this assay and by FCI (IgG, IgA or IgG/IgA), ranging

214

between 96.1% to 97.7%, and strong inter-rater agreement (k value >0.8), reinforcing

215

the idea that humoral immune response against SARS-CoV-2 following natural

216

infection is mainly directed towards RBD (3-5). In turn, the lower NPA between FCI

217

and Roche ECLIA than between FCI and Diasorin CLIA can be explained by the fact

218

that highly immunogenic B-specific epitopes lie outside the RBD (3). Along with

219

isotype-related differences in the humoral response against SARS-CoV-2, this may also

220

partly account for the suboptimal correlation (Rho, 0.69 for IgG-FCI and Rho, 0.67 for

221

IgA-FCI) between antibody levels quantified by the two immunoassays. Third, both IgA

222

and IgG/IgA-FCI returned more positive results overall than Roche ECLIA and

223

Diasorin CLIA. Interestingly, all three assays, most notably FCI, returned a number of

224

positive results in sera that had scored negative by CLIA assays targeting recombinant

225

S1/S2 subunit proteins or RBD, which were in use for routine diagnosis of SARS-CoV-

226

2 infection at the time of testing request (18). Assuming a specificity of 100% for all

227

assays, these data suggest that the immunoassays evaluated herein, most strikingly FCI,

228

may increase clinical sensitivity of previously marketed assays such as LIAISON®

229

SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG CLIA and MAGLUMI 2019-nCoV IgG. Fourth, analyzing the

230

kinetics of serum antibody levels in a number of patients with sequential specimens

231

brought the conclusion that the antibody trajectories quantified by the different

232

immunoassays were seldom congruent, with the exception of IgG and IgA determined

233

by FCI assay and to a lesser extent total antibodies quantified by Roche ECLIA and IgG

234

measured by Diasorin CLIA. This observation raises doubts as to the comparability of

235

studies addressing the impact on clinical outcomes of antibody kinetics (i.e. peak levels

236

or the area under a curve), if they employ different immunoassays.

237

In our view, the main limitations of the current study are the relative small number of

238

specimens included in the evaluation panel and that discrepancies across results

239

returned by the evaluated immunoassays were not resolved by performing antibody

240

neutralization assays, the gold standard for serological diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2

241

infection (6).

242

In summary, herein we have shown that a FCI using Jurkat T cells expressing the

243

SARS-CoV-2 native S protein for detection of IgG and IgA-specific antibodies is highly

244

specific and seemingly provides increased clinical sensitivity for diagnosis of SARS-

245

CoV-2 infection when compared to two new-generation immunoassays targeting either

246

the S protein in its trimeric conformation (Diasorin CLIA) or RBD (Roche ECLIA).

247

The assay is easy to perform and standardize; the need for a flow cytometer should not

248

be viewed as a disadvantage compared to high-throughput CLIA assays, as this platform

249

is widely available at immunology and hematology departments in hospitals of all sizes.

250

Further studies evaluating the performance of FCI for documenting seroconversion in

251

vaccinated people are underway.
