Abstract

27

Background

28

The worldwide pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has claimed millions of lives and has had a profound

29

effect on global life. Understanding the pathogenicity of the virus and the body’s response to infection

30

is crucial in improving patient management, prognosis, and therapeutic strategies. To address this, we

31

performed functional transcriptomic profiling to better understand the generic and specific effects of

32

SARS-CoV-2 infection.

33
34

Methods

35

Whole blood RNA sequencing was used to profile a well characterised cohort of patients hospitalised

36

with COVID-19, during the first wave of the pandemic prior to the availability of approved COVID-19

37

treatments and who went on to survive or die of COVID-19, and patients hospitalised with influenza

38

virus infection between 2017 and 2019. Clinical parameters between patient groups were compared,

39

and several bioinformatic tools were used to assess differences in transcript abundances and cellular

40

composition.

41
42

Results

43

The analyses revealed contrasting innate and adaptive immune programmes, with transcripts and cell

44

subsets associated with the innate immune response elevated in patients with influenza, and those

45

involved in the adaptive immune response elevated in patients with COVID-19. Topological analysis

46

identified additional gene signatures that differentiated patients with COVID-19 from patients with

47

influenza, including insulin resistance, mitochondrial oxidative stress and interferon signalling. An

48

efficient adaptive immune response was furthermore associated with patient survival, while an

49

inflammatory response predicted death in patients with COVID-19. A potential prognostic signature

50

was found based on a selection of transcript abundances, associated with circulating

51

immunoglobulins, nucleosome assembly, cytokine production and T cell activation, in the blood

52

transcriptome of COVID-19 patients, upon admission to hospital, which can be used to stratify patients

53

likely to survive or die.

54
55

Conclusions

56

The results identified distinct immunological signatures between SARS-CoV-2 and influenza,

57

prognostic of disease progression and indicative of different targeted therapies. The altered transcript

58

abundances associated with COVID-19 survivors can be used to predict more severe outcomes in

59

patients with COVID-19.

Introduction

72

The global pandemic caused by novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 emerged at the end of 2019 (1). By May

73

1st, 2021, more than 150 million people had been infected, leading to over 3 million deaths worldwide

74

(2).

75
76

Previous studies investigating the differences between patients with COVID-19 or influenza on

77

admission to hospital have found that both patient groups present with similar levels of systemic

78

inflammation markers like C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell count (WBC), neutrophil count

79

and neutrophil/lymphocyte (N/L) ratio (3). After admission patients hospitalised with COVID-19 were

80

found to have a higher risk of developing respiratory distress, pulmonary embolism, septic shock and

81

haemorrhagic strokes compared to influenza patients (4). In addition, the median length of stay in the

82

intensive care unit was twice as high for COVID-19 patients compared to influenza patients, and

83

COVID-19 patients were more likely to require mechanical ventilation (4). Furthermore, the in-hospital

84

mortality for COVID-19 patients was 16.9% compared to 5.8% for influenza patients indicating a

85

roughly three times higher relative risk of death for COVID-19 (4).

86
87

The viral immune response against influenza is well characterised (5). Briefly, initial defence involves

88

cells of the innate immune system (e.g. macrophages, granulocytes and dendritic cells (DCs)), which

89

release proinflammatory cytokines and type I interferons (IFN) to inhibit viral replication, recruit other

90

immune cells to the site of infection, and stimulate the adaptive immune response. The adaptive

91

immune response consists of a humoral and a cellular mediated immunity, initiated principally by

92

virus-specific antibodies and T cells. Current understanding of the immune response specific to SARS-

93

CoV-2 indicates that COVID-19 severity and duration are largely due to a total or early evasion of an

94

innate immune and type I and type III interferon (IFN) responses (6–9), while patients infected with

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.12.21257086; this version posted May 15, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

95

influenza are able to express type I and type II IFNs at a significantly higher concentration (3) which

96

correlates with quicker recovery and decreased disease severity and mortality (10,11). Consistent with

97

this observation, early administration of inhaled recombinant IFN-beta for COVID-19 patients was

98

associated with a lowered in-hospital mortality and quicker recovery (12,13). Despite the reduced IFN

99

response in patients with COVID-19 the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines occurs for a

100

prolonged time at similar levels with influenza patients (3), and interleukin (IL) -6 and IL-10 (14–16)

101

and CCL3 (3) were associated with increased disease severity for COVID-19. The presence of CD4+ and

102

CD8+ T cells, and antibodies were correlated with a positive patient outcome in the case of COVID-19

103

(17). This puts elderly patients at a higher risk due a smaller naïve T cell pool (18–20) and an absence

104

of a pre-existing adaptive immunity (21) resulting in a potential delayed T cell response to a novel virus

105

like SARS-CoV-2 (22). Delaying an adaptive immune response which, when combined with a high viral

106

load, could lead to a poor outcome (23). As discussed by Sette and Crotty (24) an absent T cell response

107

may cause an increased innate response attempting to control the virus resulting in an excessive lung

108

immunopathology.

109
110

To investigate unique molecular features associated with COVID-19, a cohort of patients was identified

111

from hospitalised individuals that were positive for SARS-CoV-2. As a comparator an equivalent group

112

of patients hospitalised with influenza virus were identified. An extensive record of clinical parameters

113

and peripheral blood, used for RNA-seq to obtain a global blood transcriptome overview, were taken

114

at point of care and could therefore be correlated with any molecular signatures of disease. Through

115

these side-by-side comparisons, we aim to identify distinct patterns of blood transcript abundances

116

and cellular composition related to specific antiviral immune responses. Furthermore, we aim to

117

identify a promising prognostic signature indicative of COVID-19 outcome.

Ethics and consent

122

The study was approved by the South Central - Hampshire A Research Ethics Committee (REC): REC

123

reference 20/SC/0138 (March 16th, 2020) for the COVID-19 point of care (CoV-19POC) trial; and REC

124

reference 17/SC/0368 (September 7th, 2017) for the FluPOC trial. For full inclusion and exclusion

125

criteria details see (25) and (26). Patients gave written informed consent or consultee assent was

126

obtained where patients were unable to give consent. Demographic and clinical data were collected

127

at enrolment and outcome data from case note and electronic systems. ALEA and BC data

128

management platforms were used for data capture and management.

129
130

Study design and participants

131

All participants were recruited within the first 24 hours of admission to two large studies of molecular

132

point-of-care testing (mPOCT) for respiratory viruses (CoV-19POC and FluPOC). Blood samples

133

including whole blood in PAXgene Blood RNA tubes (BRT) (Preanalytix) were collected from SARS-CoV-

134

2 positive patients and influenza positive patients, within 24 hours of enrolment, and stored at -80°C.

135

The studies were prospectively registered with the ISRCTN trial registry: ISRCTN14966673 (COV-

136

19POC) (March 18th, 2020), and ISRCTN17197293 (FluPOC) (November 13th, 2017). The COV-19POC

137

study was a non-randomised interventional trial evaluating the clinical impact of mPOCT for SARS-

138

CoV-2 in adult patients presenting to hospital with suspected COVID-19, using the QIAGEN QIAstat-Dx

139

PCR testing platform with the QIAstat-Dx Respiratory SARS-CoV-2 Panel (27). The trial took place

140

during the first wave of the pandemic, from 20th March to 29th April 2020, and prior to the availability

141

of approved COVID-19 treatments. All patients were recruited from the Acute Medical Unit (AMU),

142

Emergency Department (ED) or other acute areas of Southampton General Hospital. The FluPOC study

143

was a multicentre randomised controlled trial evaluating the clinical impact of mPOCT for influenza in

144

hospitalised adult patients with acute respiratory illness, during influenza season, using the BioFire

145

FilmArray platform with the Respiratory Panel 2.1 (28). The trial took place during influenza seasons

146

over the two winters of 2017/18 and 2018/19. All patients were recruited from the AMU and ED of

147

Southampton General Hospital and Royal Hampshire County Hospital.

149

Extraction of RNA from clinical samples and Illumina sequencing

150

Total RNA was extracted from PAXgene BRT using the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit (PreAnalytix), according

151

to the manufacturer’s protocol at Containment Level 3 in a Tripass Class I hood. Extracted RNA was

152

stored at -80°C until further use. Following the manufacturer’s protocols, total RNA was used as input

153

material into the QIAseq FastSelect–rRNA/Globin Kit (Qiagen) protocol to remove cytoplasmic and

154

mitochondrial rRNA and globin mRNA with a fragmentation time of 7 or 15 minutes. Subsequently the

155

NEBNext® Ultra™ II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina® (New England Biolabs) was used to

156

generate the RNA libraries, followed by 11 or 13 cycles of amplification and purification using AMPure

157

XP beads. Each library was quantified using Qubit and the size distribution assessed using the Agilent

158

2100 Bioanalyser and the final libraries were pooled in equimolar ratios. Libraries were sequenced

159

using 150 bp paired-end reads on by an Illumina® NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina®, San Diego, USA). Raw

160

fastq files were trimmed to remove Illumina adapter sequences using Cutadapt v1.2.1 (29). The option

161

“−O 3” was set, so that the 3’ end of any reads which matched the adapter sequence with greater than

162

3 bp was trimmed off. The reads were further trimmed to remove low quality bases, using Sickle

163

v1.200 (30) with a minimum window quality score of 20. After trimming, reads shorter than 10 bp

164

were removed.

166

Data QC and alignment

167

Quality control (QC) of read data was performed using FastQC (31) (v0.11.9) and compiled and

168

visualised with MultiQC (32) (v1.5). Samples with <20 million total reads were excluded from further

169

analysis. The STAR index was created with STAR’s (33) (v2.7.6a) genomeGenerate function using

170

GRCh38.primary_assembly.genome.fa and gencode.v34.annotation.gtf (34) (both downloaded from

171

GENCODE), with –sjdbOverhang 149 and all other settings as default. Individual fastq files were

Comparisons of baseline clinical characteristics

181

Baseline clinical characteristics of the patient groups were assessed using R (37) (v4.0.2) and RStudio

182

(38) (v1.3.959) for comparisons between COVID-19 versus influenza, and COVID-19 survivors versus

183

non-survivors. Extreme outliers (values < Q1 - 3 interquartile range, or > Q3 + 3 interquartile range)

184

were identified with the R package rstatix (39) (v0.7.0) and removed. Statistical testing was performed

185

including a Shapiro-Wilk test to assess for data normality followed with either an unpaired parametric

186

T-test (Shapiro-Wilk test p-value > 0.05) or an unpaired non-parametric Wilcoxon test (Shapiro-Wilk

187

test p-value < 0.05) for continuous data, or a Chi-square test for categorical data. The R package Table1

188

(40) (v1.3) was used to plot the baseline clinical characteristics.

190

Systems immunology-based analysis of blood transcript modules

191

Blood transcript module (BTM) analysis was performed with molecular signatures derived from 5

192

vaccine trials (41) as a reference dataset, and BTM activity was calculated using the BTM package (41)

193

(v1.015) in Python (42) (v3.7.2) using the normalized counts as input. Module enrichment significance

194

was calculated using CAMERA (43) (v3.46.0). The significance threshold for the linear model was set

195

at false discovery rate (FDR) 0.05 for the comparison between patients with COVID-19 or influenza.

196
197

Unbiased gene clustering analysis

198

Gene co-expression analysis was performed with BioLayout (44) (v3.4) using a correlation value of

199

0.95, other settings were kept at default. Clusters were manually assessed to determine gene

200

expression differences depending on for example patient cohort. Genes were subsequently analysed

201

with ToppGene (45) gene list enrichment analysis using the default settings.

202
203

Differential gene expression analysis between patient groups

204

HTSeq (46) (v0.11.2) count was used to assign counts to RNA-seq reads in the Samtools sorted BAM

205

file using GENCODE v34 annotation. Parameters used for HTSeq were --format=bam, --order=pos, --

206

stranded=reverse, --type=exon and the other options were kept at default. EdgeR (47) (v3.30.3) was

207

used for differential gene expression analysis with R (v4.0.2) in RStudio (v1.3.959). Genes with low

208

counts across all libraries were filtered out using the filterByExpr command. Filtered gene counts were

209

normalised using the trimmed mean of M-values (TMM) method. Differentially expressed genes were

210

identified, after fitting the negative binomial models and obtaining dispersion estimates, using the

211

exact test and using a threshold criteria of FDR p-value < 0.05 and log2 fold change < -1 and > 1. Genes

212

which were within the threshold criteria were used for ToppGene gene list enrichment analysis. A

213

principal component analysis (PCA) graph was constructed based on all differentially expressed genes

214

to assess sample clustering.

215
216

Assessment of difference in adaptive immune response related gene expression

217

A higher abundance of transcripts from 83 immunoglobulin genes, overlapping with the genes in the

218

Gene Ontology (GO) (48,49) biological process term ‘adaptive immune response’ (Additional file 1),

219

was found in patients with COVID-19 compared to influenza. To assess gene transcript abundance

220

differences for these 83 genes in each patient a heatmap was generated and Z-scores were summed

221

to give an overall positive (high) or negative (low) total Z-score. Patient baseline clinical characteristics

222

were explored, as above, for any explanatory factors for the involvement of a high or low total Z-score

223

between patients with COVID-19 or influenza, and those that survived COVID-19 versus those that

224

died within 30 days of hospital admission. Metadata comparison plots were made with the R package

225

ggplot2 (50) (3.3.2) and statistical testing with the R package ggpubr (51) (v0.4.0).

226
227

Topological mapping of global gene patterns

228

TopMD Pathway Analysis (52) was conducted using the differential transcript abundances identified

229

by differential gene expression analysis, generating a map of the differentially activated pathways

230

between all patients with COVID-19 or influenza. The TopMD pathway algorithm measures the

231

geometrical and topological properties of global differential gene expression embedded on a gene

232

interaction network (53). This enables plotting and measurement of the differentially activated

233

pathways through extrapolation of groups of mechanistically related genes, called TopMD pathways.

234

TopMD pathways possess a natural hierarchical structure and can be analysed for enriched GO terms,

235

by chi-square test.

237

Assessment of differential splicing between patient groups

238

Three different tools were used to assess differential gene splicing between patients with COVID-19

239

or influenza, and COVID-19 survivors or non-survivors after 30 days of hospital admission. rMATs (35)

240

(v4.1.0) was run using BAM files with soft clipping suppressed, generated with STAR and GENCODE

241

v34 gene annotation. Additional settings used were -t paired, --readLength 150 and --libType fr-

242

firststrand. Results were filtered for FDR p-value < 0.05. LeafCutter (54) (v0.2.9) was run in stages

243

following the Differential Splicing protocol (55) (bam2junc.sh generated junction files from BAMs,

244

leafcutter_cluster.py grouped junctions into clusters, leafcutter_ds.R tested for differential splicing,

245

all with default settings, except –min_samples_per_intron was set to be approximately 60% of the

246

smaller group size for each comparison (46 for COVID-19 vs influenza, 9 for COVID-19 survivors vs non-

247

survivors), and results were filtered to exclude events with delta PSI <10%, based on

248

recommendations (56). The LeafViz script (57), prepare_results.R was used to generate a data table

249

from which gene names for significant events were extracted, while the map_clusters_to_genes R

250

function was used to assign genes to non-significant tested events. Overlap between LeafCutter

251

differentially spliced and EdgeR differentially expressed genes was tested for significance using

252

Fisher’s Exact Test (fisher.test in R (v3.5.1) using a 2x2 contingency table and two.sided alternative

253

hypothesis). MAJIQ (58) (v2.2) was run in two stages (majiq build and majiq deltapsi) with default

254

settings, and results were filtered (delta PSI >20%, probability >0.95) using Voila (58) (v2.0).

256

In silico immune profiling predicting immune cell levels between patient groups

257

Relative abundance of 22 immune cell types and their statistical significance was deconvoluted from

258

whole blood using the reference gene signature matrix (LM22) using CIBERSORTx (59). CIBERSORTx

259

analysis was conducted on the CIBERSORTx website (60) using 100 permutations. Immune cell

260

distribution between the groups were compared by Mann–Whitney test.

Number of participants

275

In total RNA-seq was done for 80 patients with COVID-19 and 88 patients with influenza. Five patients

276

with influenza failed QC (read count < 20M) leaving 83 patients with influenza for analysis, of which

277

76% were infected with the influenza A virus and 22% with influenza B virus. Two patients with COVID-

278

19 were identified by PCA as outliers, subsequent assessment revealed an elevated white blood cell

279

and lymphocyte count caused by pre-existing underlying chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, and these

280

patients were excluded from further analyses (Supplementary figure 1). This left 78 patients with

281

COVID-19, of whom 62 survived and 16 died within 30 days of hospital admission, and 83 patients with

282

influenza.

Clinical differences

285

The baseline clinical characteristics of the patients used in this study for the comparison between

286

influenza and COVID-19 were assessed and no differences in distribution of sex or age were detected

287

between patient groups, however, more patients with influenza were of White British ethnicity (p-

288

value 1.12x10-05) and more were current smokers (p-value 9.07x10-05). There were also differences in

289

the proportion of cases with underlying comorbidities, with patients with COVID-19 more commonly

290

having hypertension (p-value 1.42x10-02), liver disease (p-value 3.63x10-02) and diabetes mellitus (p-

291

value 6.44x10-03) than those with influenza. However, underlying respiratory disease was more

292

common in patients with influenza (p-value 1.22x10-03). Patients with COVID-19 generally exhibited

293

more severe clinical symptoms. While the National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) was not different

294

between patients with COVID-19 or influenza, patients with COVID-19 had a higher respiratory rate

295

(p-value 2.79x10-02) and a greater proportion of patients with COVID-19 were on supplementary

296

oxygen at hospital admission (p-value 6.81x10-03). Laboratory results indicated higher levels of C-

297

reactive protein (p-value 1.73x10-03) and lymphocytes (p-value 2.76x10-02) in patients with COVID-19.

298

Furthermore, COVID-19 patients had a longer duration of symptoms prior to presentation to hospital

299

(p-value 1.17x10-05) and once admitted a longer length of stay (p-value 5.51x10-10). Longer stay time

300

was associated with increased 30 day mortality after hospital admission and patients with COVID-19

301

were more likely to have died compared to patients with influenza (p-value 4.42x10-05) (Table 1).

302
303

Between patients with COVID-19 who survived and those who died, a fatal outcome occurred in older

304

patients (p-value 2.58x10-09). COVID-19 non-survivors also had a shorter duration of symptoms before

305

being admitted to hospital (p-value 5.38x10-03). COVID-19 non-survivors more commonly had

306

underlying comorbidities including hypertension (p-value 1.93x10-03), cardiovascular disease (p-value

307

3.97x1003), diabetes mellitus (p-value 2.31x10-02) and underlying respiratory disease (p-value 1.06x10-

308

02

). While the NEWS2 scores were not different, COVID-19 survivors had a higher heart rates than

COVID-19 non-survivors (p-value 9.27x10-03). Laboratory results showed an increase of white blood

alanine aminotransferase levels (p-value 2.85x10-02), troponin levels (p-value 2.37x10-04), tumour

2.24x10-02), IL-1β (p-value 3.78x10-02) and IL-10 (p-value 7.51x10-02) in COVID-19 non-survivors. Patient

336

that died. A median of 60.4 million reads in patients with COVID-19, and 58.9 million reads in patients

337

with influenza was obtained (Supplementary figure 2A). In patients who died of COVID-19 a median

338

of 55.7 million reads was obtained and for COVID-19 survivors the median was 62.6 million reads

339

(Supplementary figure 2B). Clustering analysis between patients with COVID-19 or influenza indicated

340

a homogeneity of blood transcriptome profiles suggesting any variation between groups to be subtle

341

(Supplementary figure 3A). A partial separation was found between patients who survived or died of

342

COVID-19 based on patient outcome after 30 days of hospital admission, indicative of a larger variation

343

in the blood transcriptome (Supplementary figure 3B).

345

Contrasting innate and adaptive immune programmes

346

Previous studies have suggested that severe COVID-19 is associated with aberrant immune pathology

347

(63,64), and therefore BTM analysis and gene co-expression analysis were used to investigate the

348

balance between the innate and adaptive response in patients with either COVID-19 or influenza virus

349

and to identify patterns of changes associated with each arm of the immune system. A systems

350

immunology-based analysis of BTMs between patients with COVID-19 or influenza revealed several

351

differences (Figure 1). For the upregulated BTMs in COVID-19, signatures were observed related to

352

the cell cycle and adaptive immune response, primarily CD4+ T cells, B cells, plasma cells and

353

immunoglobulins. In contrast, the downregulated BTMs showed signatures associated with

354

monocytes, inflammatory signalling and an innate antiviral and type I IFN response.

(annotated in red) and COVID-19 (annotated in blue). Increased abundances of gene transcripts in influenza patients are
involved with an innate immune response, while in COVID-19 clusters are involved with an adaptive immune response, blood
coagulation and neutrophil degranulation. B) After TMM normalisation a significant difference in gene clusters between
patients with influenza or COVID-19 was detected. The abundance of gene transcripts involved with an innate immune
response and plasmacytoid dendritic cell were observed to be higher in influenza patients. In contrast, the abundance of gene
transcripts involved with an adaptive immune response and neutrophil degranulation was higher in COVID-19 patients.

and top biological process are given and whether that cluster was enriched in patients with COVID-19 or influenza.

386
387

Interestingly, an increased abundance of gene transcripts in patients with COVID-19 are involved in

388

adaptive immunity, pointing to activation/priming of T cells and B cells, including induction of

389

proliferation (cluster 4, FDR p-value 3.97x10-57), Additionally, an increased abundance of gene

390

transcripts encoding neutrophil degranulation (cluster 9) and blood coagulation (cluster 6) clearly

391

differentiated patients with COVID-19 from patients with influenza (FDR p-value 4.33x10-19 and FDR p-

392

value 2.84x10-12 respectively). In contrast, an decreased abundance of gene transcripts in the blood

393

transcriptome of patients with COVID-19 in comparison to patients with influenza were associated

394

with innate immunity, including biological processes involved with defence response to virus (cluster

1 and 8) (FDR p-value 5.16x10-13 and FDR p-value 4.15x10-04 respectively). Importantly, the largest

398

decrease of transcript abundances in patients with COVID-19 comprised genes expressed in

399

plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) (FDR p-value 4.17x10-22), indicating impaired immune responses to

400

viruses (FDR p-value 1.34x10-37) and impaired IFN signalling (FDR p-value 5.56x10-30). This was

401

suggestive of contrasting innate and adaptive immune programmes between the different infections

402

and these were further investigated.

404

High abundance of immunoglobulin genes associated COVID-19

405

A total of 20,542 abundance measures of gene transcripts were obtained after filtering out transcripts

406

with low counts, of which 4,094 transcripts were found to be significantly different between patients

407

with COVID-19 or influenza (FDR p-value < 0.05) of which, 197 transcripts exceeded a log2 fold change

408

of < -1 or >1, with 126 transcripts showing higher abundance in patients with COVID-19 and 71

409

transcripts showing higher abundance in patients with influenza (Figure 3A and Additional file 2).

410

Complimentary to the findings from gene co-expression analysis, the transcripts with increased

411

abundance in patients with COVID-19 were found to be involved with humoral immune response,

412

complement activation and B cell mediated immunity (Figure 3B).

426

high or low abundance of these 83 immunoglobulin genes. A high abundance was associated with a

427

total positive Z-score (1.46 to 175.46) which was identified in 59 patients with COVID-19 and 21

patients with influenza indicating a higher than average abundance of these 83 adaptive immune

indicating a lower than average abundance of adaptive immune response related immunoglobulin

Topological mapping of global gene patterns

457

Topological analysis allows the measurement of the global profiles of transcript abundances relative

458

to gene pathways without data reduction and this was used to define a global map of differentially

459

activated pathways between COVID-19 and influenza. The first differentially activated TopMD

460

pathway was enriched for ribosomal and insulin related pathways, with peak gene UBA52: named by

461

GO analysis as cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins (adjusted p-value 1.55x10-146). This pathway was also

462

found to be enriched for genes expressed by transcription factor Myc (adjusted p-value 7.07x10-53)

463

against the ChEA 2016 transcription factor database and of dendritic cells in the ARCHS4 transcription

464

factors’ co-expression database (adjusted p-value 1.34x10-36). Activated Myc represses interferon

465

regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) and a significant lower abundance of IRF7 was found in patients with COVID-

466

19 compared to influenza (Supplementary figure 5). The second differentially activated TopMD

467

pathway had peak gene NDUFAB1; named by GO analysis as mitochondrial complex I assembly model

468

OXPHOS system WP4324 (adjusted p-value 2.81x10-66). The third differentially activated TopMD

Cell subsets supporting innate and adaptive immune response differences

Analysis of the blood transcriptome can be used to predict the immune cells present (64). Levels of

484

different predicted cell types were assessed to determine whether there were differences in immune

system associated cells between patients with COVID-19 or influenza (Figure 6). Statistical testing was

486

done on cell type levels identified with CIBERSORTx. M0 macrophages (p-value 3.63x10-06), plasma

cells (p-value 5.05x10-04), cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (p-value 4.58x10-03), regulatory T cells (p-value

Predicted cell type levels between COVID-19 survivors and non-survivors indicated an increase of

498

neutrophils (p-value 2.84x10-04) in patients who died of COVID-19. In contrast, an increase of naïve

CD4+ T cells (p-value 1.92x10-03), M0 macrophages (p-value 1.20x10-02), M2 macrophages (p-value

In patients who died of COVID-19 an enrichment for biological processes involved with an

was detected (Figure 8B). While in COVID-19 survivors biological processes involved with the adaptive

immune system including complement activation, B cell mediated immunity and a humoral immune

533

response mediated by circulating immunoglobulins was found to be enriched (Figure 8C). Additionally,

Immune signatures as predictors of COVID-19 outcome

538

Distinct immune signature genes were selected and assessed for their prediction accuracy in

539

stratifying patients with COVID-19 for disease outcome, fatality or survival. A signature of 47 genes

540

was identified (Figure 9A), representative of the four biggest clusters of genes associated with either

541

patients with COVID-19 who survived or died. The associated GO biological process terms were

542

‘humoral immune response mediated by circulating immunoglobulin’ (FDR p-value 2.23x10-46),

543

‘nucleosome assembly’ (FDR p-value 5.46x10-19), ‘regulation of T-helper 1 cell cytokine production’

544

(FDR p-value 4.24x10-03) and ‘regulation of T cell activation’ (FDR p-value 4.51x10-04) (Supplementary

545

546

93% (Figure 9B and Table 4).

Discussion

564

As previously reported transcriptomic analysis of blood samples provide a relatively non-invasive

565

window on the immune response, as previously shown by differentiating patients with Ebola virus

566

disease at the acute stage (66). In this study we explored the functional blood transcriptomic

567

differences, focussing mainly on the immune response, between patients with COVID-19, admitted to

568

hospital during the first wave of the pandemic, and patients with a well-characterised stereotypical

569

seasonal respiratory virus infection, influenza. Furthermore, we compared the blood transcriptomes

570

of COVID-19 survivors and non-survivors for promising prognostic signatures indicative of COVID-19

571

survival.

572
573

35 variables that can provide prognostic information on COVID-19 associated mortality and 14

574

variables that can provide prognostic information on COVID-19 severity have previously been reported

575

(67). We compared these known COVID-19 prognostic variables (67) between patients with COVID-19

576

or influenza and found more active smokers among influenza patients. High C-reactive protein (CRP),

577

which previously has been reported to be similar upon admission to hospital between patients with

578

COVID-19 or influenza (3), hypertension and diabetes were more common among patients with

579

COVID-19. We also found an increase of liver disease, which has been classified as a low or very low

580

certainty predictor (67), in patients with COVID-19. In our cohort more patients with influenza had an

581

underlying respiratory disease. Similar to what has been previously reported (3) upon admission to

582

hospital both patients with COVID-19 or influenza presented with similar WBC and neutrophil counts,

583

and although we detected a difference in lymphocytes between patients with COVID-19 or influenza,

584

there was no difference the N/L ratio. Similar to Piroth et al. (4) we found that the average length of

585

stay was higher for patients with COVID-19 compared to influenza, and more patients with COVID-19

586

needed supplementary oxygen, and finally while Piroth et al. (4) report a roughly three times higher

587

relative risk of death for COVID-19, in our cohort no influenza patients died whilst admitted to hospital

588

and so this could not be assessed. In addition, we compared COVID-19 survivors and non-survivors,

589

and as reported the high certainty prognostic variables for mortality and/or severity of increased age,

590

hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, underlying respiratory disease (including COPD) and a

591

high WBC (67) were increased in non-survivors. While it has previously been reported that CRP and

592

N/L ratio were elevated in patients with COVID-19 who became critically ill (3), in our study we saw

593

no difference in CRP, neutrophil count and lymphocyte count between COVID-19 survivors and non-

594

survivors. However, we found that urea, creatinine, alanine aminotransferase, troponin and several

595

cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and TNFα, to be higher in patients who died of COVID-19.

596
597

Our initial global analysis of blood transcriptomic differences between patients with COVID-19 or

598

influenza detected contrasting innate and adaptive immune programmes. An impaired immune

599

response to viruses and interferon signalling in patients with COVID-19 was found, as described

600

previously (6–9), compared to patients with influenza, which are known to produce an IFN response

601

(3). Furthermore, in accordance with accumulating evidence of aberrant blood clotting in patients with

602

COVID-19 (68,69), transcripts expressed by megakaryocytes and platelets associated with blood

603

coagulation were in a higher abundance in COVID-19 patients. Gene clusters associated with an innate

604

immune response were found to be associated with influenza. While, in contrast, gene clusters

605

associated with an adaptive immune response and an increase of predicted plasma cells and CD8+ T

606

cells with COVID-19, pointing to T cell and B cell activation / priming.

607
608

Further analysis revealed various immunoglobulin genes had increased transcript abundance in

609

patients with COVID-19 compared to patients with influenza. This significant over representation of a

610

wide range of heavy chain and light chain V genes in patients with COVID-19 has been described before

611

(70) and the implementation of antibody analysis in plasma samples has been used as an additional

612

tool in diagnosing COVID-19 (71). We found that the 86.8% (53/61) of patients who survived COVID-

613

19 had a higher than average transcript abundance of 83 immunoglobulin genes, which overlap with

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.12.21257086; this version posted May 15, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

614

the GO biological term ‘adaptive immune response’, while this was 37.5% among the patients who

615

died of COVID-19. Further analysis revealed that the aforementioned higher than average transcript

616

abundance is associated with a younger age of the patient, a longer symptom duration before

617

admittance into hospital and a positive survival outcome 30 days after hospital admission. A lower

618

than average transcript abundance of 83 immunoglobulin genes was detected in 62.5% (10/16) of

619

patients who died of COVID-19, compared to 14.8% (9/61) of patients who survived COVID-19.

620
621

We subsequently detected an increased transcript abundance from genes associated with T cell and

622

B cell proliferation, an enrichment for gene pathways involved with an adaptive immune response,

623

and an increase in predicted CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and naïve B cells in patients who survived COVID-

624

19, highlighting the importance of an efficient adaptive immune response as previously reported (17).

625

The predicted cell fraction of naïve CD4+ T cell was found to be higher compared to CD8+ T cells

626

indicating a higher CD4+ T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 than a CD8+ T cell response, supporting

627

previous observations (17,72), which has been found to control primary SARS-CoV-2 infection (22).

628

We note that the CD8+ T cells were mostly seen in COVID-19 survivors, compared to COVID-19 non-

629

survivors, which has been associated with a positive COVID-19 outcome (22,73).

630
631

In contrast, we detected in COVID-19 non-survivors an enrichment of pathways involved with the

632

negative regulation of lymphocyte activation and increased neutrophil activation and degranulation,

633

supported by a significant decrease in predicted cell fraction of naïve B cells and naïve CD4+ and CD8+

634

T cells and an increase of the neutrophil cell fraction. This is consistent with previous studies finding

635

elevated levels of neutrophils in blood (74) and lungs (75–78) in severe COVID-19. Furthermore, gene

636

pathways involved with an inflammatory response and cytokine signalling were enriched in COVID-19

637

non-survivors and we detected that a higher transcript abundance of several IL genes (IL1-RAP, IL-10,

638

IL1-R1, IL1-R2, IL18-R1 and IL18-RAP) and laboratory results indicated a increase of TNFα, IL-1β, IL-8,

639

and IL-33 with the largest increase for IL-6 and IL-10. This is consistent with the previously reported

640

positive regulation of genes encoding the activation of innate immune system, viral and IFN response

641

(3), and increase of proinflammatory macrophages (79) and elevated IL-6 and IL-10 in severe COVID-

642

19 cases (14–16).

643
644

When comparing the immune response between patients who either survived or died of COVID-19 it

645

appears that, as Sette and Crotty (24) summarised, that COVID-19 severity is largely due to an early

646

virus-driven evasion of innate immune recognition leading to a subsequent delayed adaptive immune

647

response with a fatal COVID-19 outcome, as shown by Lucas et al. (80), where the innate immune

648

response is ever-expanding due to an absence of a quick T cell response. A delayed adaptive immune

649

response to COVID-19 can occur in the elderly due to their reduced ability to mount a successful

650

adaptive immune response leading to an increased risk of death (22). This reduced ability to mount

651

an adaptive immune response in the elderly is due to a scarcity of naïve T cells caused by aging (18–

652

20) and the association of age and severe or fatal COVID-19 is already known, for example, as of April

653

15th 2021 in the United States 95.4% of COVID-19 deaths have occurred in 50-year-olds and older, and

654

59.3% in 75-year-olds and older (81). Similarly, we found that patients who survived COVID-19 were

655

younger, had a higher predicted naïve CD4+ T cell and naïve B cell fraction, and had an increased heart

656

rate compared to non-survivors. Further research is needed to assess the causality of these factors,

657

for example the relationship between increased age and heart rate in non-survivors.

658
659

Topological analysis was performed to identify the global map of gene pathways differentially

660

activated between COVID-19 and influenza. The first differentially activated pathway was enriched for

661

genes related to ribosomal and insulin pathways indicating differences in effects on translational

662

machinery and supporting the reported roles of insulin resistance linked to COVID-19 severity (82).

663

Although highly speculative, insulin signalling differences may reflect the role of angiotensin

664

converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the binding site for SARS-CoV-2, which degrades angiotensin 2,

665

protecting against oxidative stress and insulin resistance driven by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone

666

system (83). Additionally, ACE2 expression has been found to be increased in rats given a high sucrose

667

diet or insulin sensitisers (84). Furthermore, the first pathway was also found to be enriched for genes

668

transcribed by Myc. Activated Myc represses IRF7 which regulates type I IFN production (85), and

669

correspondingly we found a significant lower IRF7 expression and a lower induction of IFN in patients

670

with COVID-19 compared to influenza. This low IFN induction in COVID-19 may be due to the virus

671

avoiding or delaying an intracellular innate immune response to type I and type III IFNs (6–9). The

672

second most differentially activated pathway, peak gene NDUFAB1, involved with the mitochondrial

673

complex I assembly model OXPHOS system supports reported increased COVID-19 disease severity

674

linked to SARS-CoV-2 being able to highjack mitochondria of immune cells, replicate and disrupt

675

mitochondrial dynamics (86). The third differentially activated pathway was associated with the

676

cellular ubiquitin-proteasome pathways which are known to play important roles in coronavirus

677

infection cycles (87). The protein synthesis and ubiquitination-related pathways might reflect

678

mechanisms of increased viral replication and suppression of host interferon signalling pathways,

679

including increased degradation of IκBα which suppresses the IFN-induced NF-κB activation pathway.

680

Also, in SARS-CoV, accessory protein P6, whose sequence is conserved in SARS-CoV-2 (88), promotes

681

the ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation of N-Myc interactor, thus limiting IFN signalling

682

(89). However, the peak marker of this pathway PSMD14 which prevents interferon regulatory factor

683

3 (IRF3) autophagic degradation and therefore, permits IRF3-mediated type I IFN activation (90);

684

shedding light on the complex mechanistic differences regulating interferon production between

685

COVID-19 and influenza.

687

Conclusions

688

In this study, we have compared side-by-side SARS-CoV-2 and a stereotypical respiratory viral infection

689

(influenza), and COVID-19 survivors and non-survivors. Distinct patterns of transcript abundances and

690

cellular composition were found in whole blood that can differentiate the infection source, furthering

our understanding of the antiviral immune response differences. Additionally, we observed a

692

proinflammatory signature associated with a negative outcome in patients with COVID-19. Finally, a

693

signature of transcript abundances in the blood transcriptome of COVID-19 patients, upon admission

694

to hospital, was identified with prognostic potential to stratify patients into those likely to survive or
