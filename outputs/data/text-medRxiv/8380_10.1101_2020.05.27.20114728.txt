Abstract
Human behavior (movement, social contacts) plays a central role in the spread of pathogens like SARS-

18

CoV-2. The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 was driven by global human movement, and initial lockdown
measures aimed to localize movement and contact in order to slow spread. Thus, movement and contact

20

patterns need to be explicitly considered when making reopening decisions, especially regarding return to
work. Here, as a case study, we consider the initial stages of resuming research at a large research

22

university, using approaches from movement ecology and contact network epidemiology. First, we
develop a dynamical pathogen model describing movement between home and work; we show that

24

limiting social contact, via reduced people or reduced time in the workplace are fairly equivalent
strategies to slow pathogen spread. Second, we develop a model based on spatial contact patterns within a

26

specific office and lab building on campus; we show that restricting on-campus activities to labs (rather
than labs and offices) could dramatically alter (modularize) contact network structure and thus, potentially

28

reduce pathogen spread by providing a workplace mechanism to reduce contact. Here we argue that
explicitly accounting for human movement and contact behavior in the workplace can provide additional

30

strategies to slow pathogen spread that can be used in conjunction with ongoing public health efforts.

Introduction
The cosmopolitan connectivity of modern society facilitated the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2

38

around the globe in early 2020 [1]. The rate at which any pathogen spreads depends critically on host
movement behavior [2]. Indeed, estimates of key epidemiological parameters like the basic reproduction

40

number (R0) are highly variable in part because they are context-specific and are a function of behaviors
like movement and heterogenous contact structure [3,4]. Although most cases of COVID-19 (the disease

42

caused by SARS-CoV-2) seem to be mild or even asymptomatic [5,6], the sheer number of cases to date
means that limited personnel, hospital beds, and ICU equipment can be rapidly overwhelmed, increasing

44

mortality [7,8]. Thus, continuing normal movement patterns, unmitigated, is not a viable containment
strategy. Without a vaccine or widespread immunity to SARS-CoV-2, our best defense to slow pathogen

46

spread has been restricting movement and contacts through physical distancing [9], testing for SARSCoV-2 when available [10] and contact tracing [11]. Lockdown measures have drastically reduced human

48

movement [1,12] and consequently have reduced the effective reproduction number, Re [4,13]. However,
such measures are affecting mental health [14,15] and have had a devastating impact on the economy, so

50

individual regions are considering best practices for the reopening of businesses, schools, and other places
where people gather (e.g.,[16–18]). Decisions regarding next steps can be informed by recognizing that

52

not all movement patterns nor all contact behaviors are equal in terms of pathogen spread.
Concepts from movement ecology and contact network epidemiology can provide helpful

54

frameworks for understanding the nuanced interactions between movement, contacts and infection.
Increased movement does not always mean increased transmission risk [19]; for example, movement that

56

either takes individuals away from infected areas or reduces contact with infected conspecifics can reduce
transmission risk (migratory escape; [20,21]). Increased movement can even increase some aspects of

58

infection risk while decreasing others, simultaneously [22]. Thus, explicitly considering how movement
relates to transmission can help us understand what effect different movement patterns have on infection

dynamics [23,24]. Similarly, from disease ecology and contact network epidemiology, we know that
structured contacts among individuals in a population have different effects on disease spread than

62

random contacts. For example, long-range connections in otherwise locally-connected small world
networks can have dramatic effects on disease spread at a population level [25].

64

Individual movement across multiple scales — from occasional global movements to smallerscale daily patterns — is critical for shaping contact and thus the spread of pathogens. To date, models of

66

SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 spread have focused on comparing patterns of spread across countries, states,
and counties [26,27]. Indeed, a plethora of epidemiological models have proven useful in generating

68

recommendations for reducing the virus spread rate, from understanding the role of contact-tracing and
society-wide physical distancing [11,28], to travel restrictions and lockdowns (e.g., [4,29,30]), to mask-

70

wearing [31]. However, few models offer guidance at scales as fine as individual workplaces, despite the
fact that this local scale is where individual decisions are made and where most transmission occurs.

72

Furthermore, apart from time at home, the most predictable component of many people’s days is time
spent in the workplace. Thus, knowledge of work commute patterns, contact networks of individuals in

74

the workplace, and related workplace-specific factors could help mitigate pathogen spread during the
period that total population immunity remains low. In many cases, commute trajectories are not random

76

but involve regularity in timing, location, and encounters with other individuals along the way (e.g., on
public transport). Here, we consider the implications for mitigating COVID-19 transmission using a case

78

study of the initial stages of resuming research at a large research university.
Implicit in this analysis is that COVID-19 is currently spreading in local communities around the

80

world, and every individual in a workplace is part of a home community. Even under many weeks of
extreme restrictions with only society’s most essential employees present in workplaces (i.e., Stay at

82

Home orders), the number of new cases have continued to rise in most locations. For example, in late
April 2020, even after three weeks of a Stay at Home order and extreme physical distancing in Minnesota,

84

a state with moderate spread and commendable compliance with the order, the number of new cases

confirmed each day had tripled [32]. With community spread of this pathogen, it is unrealistic to expect
86

zero workplace infection or widespread virus containment primarily through workplace practices. Any
return-to-work plan, therefore, must include the explicit expectation that new infections may arise while

88

concurrently prioritizing worker safety and optimizing the work that can be done. Thus, reopening
businesses requires an evidence-based plan to reduce contacts through time to minimize new infections at

90

the workplace, when an infected individual, presumably pre-symptomatic [33], brings the virus to a
workplace.

92

Here we develop a pair of models to understand how movement and contact structure shape
infection spread. As a case study, we consider the context of moving from full-time work at home to part-

94

time resumption of research at a university; however, results from this model are general to many other
settings as well. We take a dual modeling approach by developing a general movement model and a

96

network case study of one academic laboratory and office building. We explore tradeoffs between
limiting contact, people, or time on campus. We find that moving back to work on campus does not

98

necessarily speed up infection spread, and depends particularly on the infection risk associated with
commutes and how well physical distancing can be maintained on campus. Thus our findings allow us to

100

set evidence-based expectations and generate specific behavioral recommendations for a safer return to
work.

102

Materials and Methods
104

We develop two models: a movement model to explore movement between home and work
environments, and a network model to explore contact patterns within the work environment. Both

106

models are SEIR, tracking susceptible (S), exposed (E), infected (I), and removed (recovered and
immune, or deceased; R) individuals. We assume there is no loss of immunity (removed individuals never

108

move back to the susceptible class) over the short time scales we consider, and we assume a closed

110

Methods: movement model
112

Setup
114

Our first model explores infection dynamics as individuals move between home, commuting, and
work environments. Workplaces, including universities, face a number of different decisions about how to

116

slowly ramp up work following easing of lockdown. Here, we simulate three potential strategies for
returning to work: (i) allowing people to return while maintaining physical distancing, (ii) limiting the

118

number of people returning to campus during the work day, and (iii) limiting the time each person spends
on campus. For each strategy combination, we simulate infection dynamics and quantify two output

120

metrics: (1) the ‘final epidemic size’ (cumulative fraction of the population infected, at equilibrium), and
(2) the ‘epidemic peak size’ (maximum fraction of the population infected during the outbreak). The aim

122

of this type of conceptual model is to clarify the connections between assumptions and outcomes, unlike
predictive models which would contain an abundance of empirical data and aim to generate forecasts for a

124

specific system [34].

126

Daily cycle
Our model dynamics have a combination of continuous and discrete time (e.g., [35]), where each

128

day is broken into discrete phases (Th spent at home, Tw spent at work, and Tc spent commuting each way,
with Th + Tw + 2Tc = 1) and infection dynamics occur continuously during each phase (Fig 1, see Tables

130

1-2 for model variables and parameters). All individuals start at home and spend a fraction of their day (of
length Th) there and not working. During this time, the infection dynamics are given by

138

is the total number of individuals in the population (N = S + E + I + R), βh is the rate of transmission while
at home, σ is the rate of moving from exposed to infected (inverse of the latent period) and γ is the rate of

140

recovery from infection.

[Fig 1. Movement model schematic, showing a daily cycle.
All individuals — Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Infected (I) or Removed (R) — spend part of their day

144

(Th) at home. A proportion θ of individuals move to campus, spending Tc time commuting in each
direction, and work from campus during the workday (time Tw), while the other fraction (1 - θ) works

146

from home. A total 24 hour cycle is then represented by: Th + Tw + 2 Tc = 1. Transmission rates can vary
among home (βh; this includes transmission during essential trips e.g., to the grocery store), commute (βc;

148

traveling between home and work), and work (βw; campus-based interactions) environments, while the
rate of moving from exposed to infected (σ) and recovery rate (γ) are the same regardless of where

150

152

individuals are located.]

Here, the rate at which new susceptible individuals (S) become exposed (E) depends on three
components [36]. First is the rate of contact between two individuals in a location. Here we assume this

154

contact rate is constant (does not change with population density) but can differ across environments
(home vs. work vs. commuting). Critically, we assume that βh accounts for transmission not just in an

156

individual’s actual home, but transmission that occurs during other essential activities during lockdown
(e.g., grocery store trips). Second is the probability that the contact for each susceptible individual is with

an infected individual; this is given by the proportion of infected individuals in the local population (I/N).
Third is the probability that contact with an infectious individual results in transmission. In equation 1

160

above (and the other equations below), we have combined the first and third factors into a single term, β,
while the second factor is given by I/N. Overall, this gives us frequency-dependent transmission

162

(transmission rate depends on the frequency — not density — of infected individuals in the population);
an appropriate assumption for spatially structured environments [2,36].

164

After the period of time at home (Th), a fraction, θ, of all individuals commute to work while the
remaining (1- θ) stay to work from home. At this point we subdivide the population based on the number

166

of individuals of each type and fraction commuting. We denote location by subscripts (h for home, c for
commute), so the number of individuals of each type are

given by [eqn. 4] above.

After the work phase (of length Tw), we describe a second commute phase. The population
continues to be subdivided into eight types, where the number of individuals of each type are

220

During this second commute phase (also of length Tc), the infection dynamics for those commuting are
given by [eqn. 3] above, and the infection dynamics for those still at home are given by [eqn. 4] above. At

222

the end of the second commute phase, all individuals are back in the home environment (no longer
subdivided) and the number of individuals of each type are

We used a fixed population size (N) of 3,000 individuals. We did not include births or deaths, or

232

movement in and out of the population. These are reasonable assumptions given the scope of our
simulations: a work population that is not hiring new employees and has few retirements or actual deaths

234

over a few months. Because we assumed frequency-dependent transmission, the relative fraction of the
population infected is the same regardless of population size.

236

Infection parameters were calculated as follows. We used 4.2 days as the latent period [37] and
calculated the rate of moving from exposed to infected (σ) as the inverse of this: σ = 1/4.2 = 0.238 per

238

day. We used 9.5 days as the infectious period (the estimated length of viral shedding for SARS-coV-2;
[38]), and calculated the recovery rate (γ) as the inverse of this: γ = 1/9.5 = 0.105 per day. Transmission

240

rate (β) was calculated based on the basic reproductive number, R0. We assumed a ‘baseline’ R0
(unmitigated; no behavioral changes like physical distancing) of 2.5 based on current estimates for SARS-

242

coV-2 [39], although some estimates put R0 as high as 5.7 [37]. To quantify how behavioral changes to
movement and contact affect transmission we defined effective reproduction numbers (Re) for each of the

244

environments (home, work, commute). We assumed that stay-at-home measures to reduce pathogen
spread in the community halved the rate of contacts at home (e.g., [40]), that is Re-h = 0.5R0. We assumed

246

that infection at work could be anywhere between current infection rates at home (Re-w = 0.5R0) and
unmitigated rates (Re-w = R0). To facilitate interpretation of our results, we also describe infection at work

248

in terms of the fraction increase in transmission compared to home, where 0 indicates transmission is the
same at work and home, 0.5 indicates transmission at work is 50% higher than at home and 1 indicates

250

transmission at work is 100% higher than at home (i.e., double). Finally, we assumed that infection while
commuting spanned a broader range of possible values than either home or work. At one extreme,

252

commuting by private transport effectively has no risk of transmission from others (Re-c = 0). At the other
extreme, commuting by crowded public transport can reduce feasible physical distancing (Re-c = 2R0),

254

both because individuals have a greater number of contacts while commuting and because these contacts
potentially last for longer than normal. Transmission rates (β) were back-calculated from Re values, based

256

on rearranging the expression Re = β/γ to β = γ Re. We assume that R0 and Re values estimated for the

general public apply to our population of University workers. If instead our population had lower
258

transmission rates than the general public under stay-at-home measures, going back to work could lead to
faster pathogen spread than we predict here.

260

Simulations
262

Since our aim was to understand the relative importance of model parameters on infection
dynamics (rather than try to forecast outcomes), we started each simulation with one individual infected

264

(I(t=0)=1), zero exposed (E(t=0)=0), zero removed (R(t=0)=0), and the rest susceptible (S(t=0)=2,999).
Each simulation was run until it reached equilibrium (where the fraction of the population in the R class

266

did not change from one day to the next). We defined a baseline set of values for each parameter (see
Table 2). Then we ran the following simulations that varied some parameters while holding others

268

constant:
(i) Varying transmission while at work (βw) and during the commutes (βc). We considered three

270

scenarios that differed in the degree of risk of a commute to work and back. For low risk, we assumed
low contact both during commutes and on campus (Re-w = 0.5R0 = 1.25, equivalent to at home). For

272

moderate risk, we assumed unmitigated contact during commute (Re-c = R0 = 2.5, shared transport)
and partial physical distancing at work (Re-w = 0.75R0 = 1.875, intermediate between home and

274

unmitigated). For high risk, we assumed elevated contact during commute (Re-c = 2R0 = 5, crowded
shared transport), and unmitigated contact at work (Re-w = R0 = 2.5). These results are presented in Fig

276

2.
(ii) Varying the fraction of the population commuting (θ) and fraction of the day spent on campus

278

(Tw). We considered eleven values of the fraction of the population commuting (θ = 0,0.1,...,0.9,1)
and eleven values of the fraction of an 8-hour workday spent on campus (Tw = x(8/24) where x =

280

0,0.1,...,0.9,1). These results are presented in Fig 3a.

Sensitivity Analysis
312

Finally, we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine how sensitive the two model output
metrics (final epidemic size, epidemic peak size) were to each of the model parameters, using a

314

combination of Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) and Partial Rank Correlation Coefficients (PRCC). The
LHS/PRCC sensitivity analysis is appropriate when the relationship between model output and each

316

model parameter is monotonic and nonlinear [41]. For our model, this relationship was monotonic for all
nine parameters considered (N, Tc, Tw, θ, σ, γ, Re-c, Re-h, and Re-w; S1-S2 Figs). The LHS/PRCC sensitivity

318

analysis has two steps.
First, we used Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS; [42]), a Monte Carlo approach, to generate sets

320

of parameter value combinations from preset ranges of parameter values. LHS has a minimum required
sample size (n) which is given by: n ≥ k+1 or n ≥ k(4/3) where k is the number of parameters included in

322

the LHS [43], nine for our analysis. We chose the number of samples (see below) to meet these criteria.
Each of the nine model parameters considered was sampled from a uniform probability density function

324

based on the ranges given in Table 2. The model was run for each parameter value set, and the final
epidemic size (cumulative fraction of the population infected, in the long-term) and epidemic peak size

326

(maximum fraction of the population infected at any time) were both saved as output metrics.
Second, we measured the sensitivity of the output metrics to each parameter using Spearman

328

Partial Rank Correlation Coefficients (PRCC). To determine how many samples of each parameter was
needed to generate stable PRCC value, we calculated PRCC value for an increasing number of samples

(S3 Fig) and noted that the PRCC values were relatively stable past 1000 samples. Thus, we used 1000
samples of each parameter value for our final PRCC analysis. A positive PRCC value indicates that

332

increasing the value of that parameter increases the output metric while a negative PRCC value indicates
that increasing the value of that parameter decreases the output metric. PRCC values that were not

334

significant at the 0.05 level are marked with ‘ns’ in Fig 4 (not corrected for multiple comparisons).
Finally, we used a z-test to rank significant model parameters in terms of their relative importance, since

336

larger PRCC values do not always indicate more important parameters [41]. For our results (Fig 4), model
output sensitivity was indeed given by the size of PRCC values.

decrease epidemic size as they are increased). Cases where the relationship between the parameter and

Methods: network model
Our second model explores infection dynamics as individuals work on campus either in both

348

office and lab spaces or just in lab spaces. We created a network map of all the individuals housed in the
Ecology building on the St. Paul campus of the University of Minnesota. We created our dataset by

350

merging information on the office and lab room assignments for each individual with an office or lab in
the building. (The methods for collection and analyses of these data were reviewed by the University of

352

Minnesota’s Institutional Review Board and were determined not to be human subjects research.) Work
in the Ecology building is structured by two primary space types, laboratories that can include one to

354

three research groups, each associated with a single faculty member, and offices which can be singleoccupancy or shared. Office space is generally shared by groups of graduate students and postdoctoral

356

scholars, often from different lab groups. Because undergraduates are generally not permitted to work on
campus during the resumption of research, we included faculty, staff, postdocs, and graduate students, but

358

excluded all undergraduates from this visualization.
We considered two types of bipartite networks: shared office space and shared lab space.

360

Individuals sharing an office or a lab all had an edge with that location node. We then consider the onemode projection of each network, creating a weighted unipartite network connecting individuals

362

according to their shared spaces. The binary representation of these networks was used to create static
network visualizations of connections among individuals using the igraph, tidygraph, and ggraph libraries

364

in R [44–46], shown in Fig 5a and b. Animations of disease progression through the networks were
produced using the gganimate library in R (S5-S6 Figs; [47]). For each network, we computed the

366

distribution of (finite) shortest paths between each pair of nodes (Fig 5c) and for each distinct component
of the networks, we noted its size (number of nodes), diameter (longest shortest path), and mean path

368

length (average shortest path length; S7 Fig).

380
For the network simulations, we used an SEIR model framework, starting with a randomly
382

selected index case to serve as the first infected individual in an entirely susceptible population (Fig 6).
Simulations proceeded in discrete time. At each time step, individuals who had been exposed to the virus

384

transitioned into the infectious class (E→I) based on the result of a Bernoulli trial using the disease
progression rate as the probability of success. Likewise, currently infectious individuals were removed

386

(i.e., either recovered and immune or deceased; I→R) based on the result of a Bernoulli trial using the
recovery rate as the probability of success. Finally, one Bernoulli trial using the transmission rate as

388

probability of success was conducted for each edge connecting a susceptible individual to an infectious
one. Susceptible individuals became exposed (S→E) if at least one such trial resulted in success. At the

390

end of each simulation, we took note of the epidemic peak size, the final epidemic size, and the time
needed to read the epidemic peak (Fig 7). We evaluated the sensitivity of these results by comparing them

392

to simulations run on randomized versions of these empirical networks (S8 Supporting Information).
Network analysis and simulations were conducted in R (Version 3.6.3).

Results
410

Movement model
412

Whether returning to work on campus affects the epidemic outcomes (measured as final epidemic
size and epidemic peak size) depends critically on the degree of physical distancing maintained both on

414

campus and during the commute between home and campus (Fig 2). If the current degree of physical
distancing that is achieved while working from home can be maintained while on campus, then working

416

from campus will not speed up infection dynamics compared to working from home (Fig 2a). However, if
physical distancing on campus or during the commute is less successful than current physical distancing

418

at home, then returning to work on campus will both increase the epidemic peak size in the short-term and
increase the final epidemic size in the long term (Fig 2b-c). When physical distancing cannot be

420

maintained on campus or during the commute, then infection dynamics can be kept slower by limiting the
fraction of workers on campus and the amount of time workers are on campus (Fig 3a).

422

Intriguingly the three strategies we considered (limiting contact, people, or time on campus) are
interchangeable with approximately equivalent effects on both the long-term metric, final epidemic size

424

(Fig 3) and the short-term metric, epidemic peak size (S4 Fig). That is, in situations where one of these
strategies cannot be fully implemented, a different strategy can be used in its stead. For example, if

426

individuals need to be on campus for an extended period of time to run an experiment (thus limiting time

18

on campus is not a feasible strategy), this can be compensated for by limiting the number of other
428

individuals on campus at the same time. However, of the three strategies, reducing the fraction of the
population on campus had a bigger impact than reducing either time or contact on campus, due to the

430

effect of commuting to and from campus. Regardless of time or physical distancing on campus, more
people working on campus requires that more people commute. Thus, if commuting substantially

432

increases transmission risk compared to staying at home (i.e., any form of shared transport vs. commuting
alone), reducing the number of people commuting will be a more effective strategy than reducing either

434

time or contact while on campus.
The sensitivity analysis revealed that both model metrics (final epidemic size, epidemic peak

436

size) were most sensitive to transmission at home (Re-h), since most of the day is spent in that
environment, as well as the fraction of the population commuting (θ) to campus (Fig 4). Transmission on

438

campus (Re-w) and transmission during commutes (Re-c) were the next most influential; the first because
most time during the workday is spent on campus and the second because we allowed transmission to

440

vary across a wider range during commuting than on campus. The time spent on campus (Tw) and time
commuting (Tc) were somewhat influential. For each of these parameters, increasing the parameter value

442

increased the final and peak epidemic sizes. Finally, population size (N) did not significantly affect either
metric (but would be critical for the total number of individuals infected). The rate of moving from

444

exposed to infected (σ) and the recovery rate (γ) did not significantly affect final epidemic size, but both
had a minor effect on epidemic peak size: increasing σ (i.e., a shorter latent period) increased epidemic

446

peak size, while increasing γ (i.e., a shorter infectious period) decreased epidemic peak size.

448

Network model
The mixing of researchers from different labs in shared office spaces had a substantial impact on

450

the modularity of the resulting network. In particular, when people do not use shared office spaces (i.e.,

19

work from home if they share an office), but work on campus only in labs, the network is far more
452

modular, with smaller, more densely connected groups and few connections among groups (Fig 5b, S7
Fig). In this case, most individuals are directly connected to all other members of their group (i.e.,

454

“shortest path” of one, Fig 5c); however the absence of connections between groups means that, on
average, an infected individual lacks a path of connections to 95% of the rest of the population. In

456

contrast, when individuals share both lab and office space, the connectedness of the network is relatively
high because students, staff, and postdocs that share offices are often from different labs. For this

458

combined case, most individuals are four or fewer connections from one another (Fig 5c) and the largest
component contains nearly 90% of all individuals in the network (Fig 5a, S7 Fig). Thus, in the case where

460

an infected individual (presumably pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic) came to work, the combined lab
and office network has the potential for greater disease incidence than in the lab-only network, where the

462

infection could be constrained to a single lab (Figs 6-7, S5-S6 Figs). In general, when compared to the
combined network, the lab-only network had outbreaks that were less explosive (i.e., had less variance

464

and a lower mean number of individuals infected at any one time), fewer individuals infected overall, and
a shorter time until the peak number of infectious individuals (Fig 7).

466

Discussion
468

Movement and contact behaviors are key drivers of the spread of pathogens like SARS-CoV-2,
and not all movement and contacts have the same impact on pathogen spread. However, basic

470

compartmental models used to describe SARS-CoV-2 dynamics assume all individuals move and contact
each other at random (i.e., populations are well-mixed). Our models show how explicitly accounting for

472

movement, space use in a building, and contact behaviors can provide a more nuanced understanding of
relative risk. Our movement model, capturing the predictable movement between home and work/campus

474

environments, shows that reducing the number of people, rate of contact, and amount of time spent on

campus are all equivalently effective strategies for slowing pathogen spread. However, if commutes
476

specifically increase transmission risk (i.e., shared transport), reducing the number of people on campus is
the most effective strategy to reduce the infection spread rate. We also considered heterogeneity in

478

contact behavior once at the workplace; our network model captures the regular interactions among
workers in shared workspaces on campus and shows that restricting building use to lab spaces (rather than

480

lab and office space) may reduce pathogen spread. Our results provide a number of tools to distinguish
among different movement and contact patterns at the scale of individuals and workplace communities.

482

A number of future directions could be explored, by changing some of our simplifying
assumptions. First, staying within the broad structure of our model, alternative spatiotemporal strategies

484

could be explored including: structured work weeks (e.g., four days on-campus and ten off; [48]), or
further compartmentalizing time (e.g., sequential work shifts) or space (e.g., different buildings on

486

campus). For instance, if evidence suggests that infection can occur through air circulation within
buildings [49], these models could be altered to account for connections arising from shared ventilation

488

systems. These models also could be modified to account for movement and contact behavior that
explicitly depends on infection status [50]; e.g., splitting infected individuals into infectious but

490

asymptomatic (who still potentially commute to work) and symptomatic individuals (who stay home) or
building dynamic networks where contact behavior can change in response to infectious status (e.g.

492

infectious and symptomatic individuals reducing their interpersonal contacts either through staying home
or altering their behavior at work). Second, one could expand the scale of the model. This could be done

494

foremost by combining the movement model (movement between work, commute, campus) with the
network model (movement while on campus). Further expansions could consider both larger scales

496

(linking in regional patterns) as well as smaller ones (allowing contacts within buildings to vary over
time). For instance, integrating local models such as ours with regional variation in infection rates and

498

degree of community social mixing [11,51,52] could further inform recommendations. Third, as data
accumulate on transmission dynamics and individual susceptibility, we can alter specific players or

500

interactions in the model. For instance, while the virus can survive on surfaces [53], most transmission
appears to be aerosolized, mediated by extended person-to-person interactions in close spaces [54–58], so

502

masking and minimizing temporal and spatial overlap of workers in shared spaces is key [59–61]. In
addition, susceptibility and thus local demographic data can provide additional layers of tailored

504

recommendations [62].
Our findings mesh with concepts in the broader movement and disease ecology literature. Within

506

movement ecology, there has long been a distinction between random/undirected movement like dispersal
versus predictable movements like diel and seasonal migration [63]. Human movement between home

508

and work is often a predictable and daily occurrence and thus is better viewed from the lens of predictable
migratory movements (as we do here) rather than random dispersive ones (as implicit in basic

510

compartmental models). Moving predictably between two environments does not always increase
infection (either for individuals or at the population level) compared to remaining in a single location; the

512

relative transmission in each environment is critical [22]. We find that transmission risk during a
commute is key to infection dynamics when considering the impact of movement between home and

514

work, paralleling recent work calling for the explicit consideration of how transient phases of movement
affect infection dynamics [24] and theory showing that infection dynamics during transit can have a

516

similar impact to dynamics in the second environment [64].
There are important insights that emerge from our movement and contact-network models that

518

can guide policy. For example, basic disease models assume random movement and equal probability of
contact, whereas many hosts, including humans, move in directed ways and in very structured social

520

networks. For this reason, disease mitigation policies will likely be more effective when they consider
disease risk in a more holistic way that integrates risk across the various components of a person's daily

522

movement. For example, in settings where many people commute by mass transit (e.g., New York City),
the efficacy of workplace safety protocols may be overwhelmed by transmission during daily commutes

524

rather than contacts at work. Careful examination of social network patterns could also help guide policy

to provide intermediate scenarios between business as usual and complete lock down. For example, in our
526

case-study contact rates and potential disease spread were significantly reduced when people’s contacts at
the workplace were restricted to single lab groups, as opposed to linking separate lab and office networks.

528

These findings are consistent with emerging calls to reduce COVID-19 spread by creating “learning
pods” and “social bubbles” of interacting children and adults as schools and workplaces re-open [65,66].

530

Even so, the protective effects of heterogeneity in contact structure should not be overemphasized
for decision making. First, although the threshold for herd immunity can be lower in heterogeneous

532

networks [67], making outbreaks less likely, outbreaks that do occur can also be more explosive [25].
Second, because SARS-CoV-2 spread appears to be primarily by aerosolized transmission, the potential

534

contact behaviors needed for transmission are more ubiquitous than for pathogens with more specific
transmission modes (e.g., sexually transmitted diseases like HIV/AIDS). Importantly, the networks

536

presented here consider only the room in which an employee works (their office or lab space), explicitly
omitting broader workplace considerations like air flow, shared surfaces, entry points, etc., these

538

additional points must be addressed in conjunction with thinking about explicit contact behavior when
forming a public health strategy. Lastly, these static networks are a simplification of an inherently

540

dynamic process of movement, contact, and infection. Using a time-ordered or dynamic network
approach could provide better insights to actual duration of exposures and sickness-induced behavioral

542

changes [68].

544

Conclusions
Human movement and contact behaviors are critical for the spread of pathogens like SARS-

546

CoV-2, yet are rarely addressed explicitly in the current conversations about decision-making in the face
of relaxing Stay at Home orders. Here we have drawn on movement and network models to demonstrate

548

the effect of these behaviors. First, we have shown that regular movement between two ‘environments’

(i.e., work and home) does not inherently increase infection spread the way random dispersive
550

movements might. Rather the outcome depends on the relative degree of transmission (e.g., degree of
physical distancing) in each environment. Second, we have shown that different contact patterns (e.g.,

552

space usage) within the work environment could lead to different outcomes in terms of SARS-CoV-2
spread. In sum, we advocate for using an understanding of movement and contact patterns as an

554

adjunctive approach (alongside widespread testing, contact tracing, vaccine development and other tools)
to mitigate the effects of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, particularly when considering return to work

556

environments.
