Abstract
Background:We aimed to identify clinical features of coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) in children and evaluate the role of procalcitonin in early differential
diagnosis.
Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on all suspected pediatric cases.
Results: 39 (50.6%) of 77 suspected cases were comfirmed, 4 (5.2%) of them had
viral coinfection.Compared with non-COVID-19 group (n=33),COVID-19 confirmed
group (n=39) had fewer fever(OR[95% CI]0.467[0.314-0.694];P=.000) and symptoms
of acute respiratory infection (0.533[0.36–0.788];P=.001),more asymptomatic

Introduction
Children are naturally susceptible to various respiratory viruses due to their
imperfect immune systems.Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) began in Wuhan city,Hubei province,China [1,2], more than 2,000
pediatric cases have been reported nationwide in just over two months [3]. Limited by
accuracy of nucleic acid detection [4], relative reagent shortage and non-specificity of
imaging findings, early differential diagnosis of suspected pediatric patients is
difficult to some extent.Obviously,this has a serious impact on timely triage and the
following reasonable treatment.
At present, a growing number of studies have focused on diagnosis and treatment
of confirmed cases, but few data are available on clinical characteristics and early
identification of suspected pediatric patients with COVID-19 as a special
population.As a traditional biomarker,procalcitonin (PCT) have shown superior value
in differentiating bacterial and viral infections as well as bacterial coinfections.
However, the role of PCT in identifying between viruses and viruses or viral
coinfection remain unknown.We aimed to identify the clinical features of COVID-19
in children and evaluate the role of PCT in early differential diagnosis, so as to
provide a basis for the follow-up timely and reasonable treatment and effective
implementation of prevention and control measures.

Children are defined as being less than 18 years old. Referring to the guidelines
on the diagnosis and treatment of 2019 novel coronavirus infected pneumonia (the
sixth edition draft) issued by the National Health Commission of China [5]. Suspected
cases are defined as having a clear epidemiological exposure, with or without clinical
manifestations, and with or without positive computed tomography (CT)
findings.Epidemiological exposure includes close contact with confirmed cases,and or
living or traveling in endemic areas (especially Hubei province), and or presence of
confirmed case in their residential communities. If nasopharyngeal swab or anal swab
specimens tested positive for nucleic acid using real-time reverse transcriptase
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay,suspected case is identified as a confirmed
case. Fever was recognized when body temperature is higher than or equal to
37.3.Symptoms of acute respiratory infection (ARI) includes nasal congestion,
runny nose, sneezing,sore throat, cough, expectoration, chest pain,dyspnea,etc.All
chest CT images were reviewed by two experienced pediatric radiologists. If
unilateral or bilateral lung fields have any of the features as follows:(a) ground glass
opacities;(b) consolidations with surrounding halo sign;(c) nodules;(d) residual fiber
strips.The result is defined as positive CT findings of viral pneumonia [6].Family
cluster infection was defined as the occurrence of any of the following criteria in 2 or
more family members within a period of less than 1 week: (a) fever;(b) symptoms of
ARI;(c) positive CT findings of viral pneumonia.
Data collection
We conducted a retrospective study on all clinical and laboratory data. From Jan

22nd to Mar 1st,all suspected pediatric patients were admitted to the Third People's
Hospital of Shenzhen,and relevant examinations were completed as routine
precedures, and clinical and laboratory data of the first day after admission were
collected. Based on laboratory pathogen identification results including 2019 novel
coronavirus, influenza A,B (INF A,INF B), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV),
mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP), and bacteria,all cases were divided into the
COVID-19 confirmed group and the non-COVID-19 group. COVID-19 confirmed
group was further divided into COVID-19 alone and coinfection group according to
whether they were coinfected, and the differences between the groups were compared.
Inclusion criteria: all suspected pediatric cases.
Exclusion criteria of the non-COVID-19 group:(a) pathogen identified as
bacteria or MP; (b) coinfection; (c) PCT > 0.5 ng/mL [7].
Statistical Analysis
All analyses were conducted by using of IBM Statistical Product and Service
Solutions software Version 24 (SPSS Inc,Chicago,IL).Continuous variables were
summarized as the median with their interquartile ranges (IQRs) or mean with
standard deviations (SDs), median [IQR] or [mean ±SD], depending on whether their
distributions were normal or not.Comparisons of categorical variables were performed
using the Pearson Chisquare test. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) were calculated for statistically significant variables.The parametric tests
(independent sample Student t-test or One-way analysis of variance) or
non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney U test or Kruskal-Wallis test) were used to

analyze variables.The P value was adjusted by the Bonferroni method for comparison
between groups.Variables with P <0.2 in the laboratory data analysis were entered
into a multivariate binary logistic regression model.Model fitness was assessed with
the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test.Analysis of the area under curve (AUC)
of receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was constructed to assess the
differentiating performance. Sensitivity,specificity, positive predictive value (PPV),
negative predictive value (NPV) were also determined.P <.05 was considered as
statistically significant in all tests if applied.
Results
From Jan 22nd to Mar 1st, a total of 77 suspected pediatric patients were
admitted, and 39 (50.6%) were confirmed with COVID-19, including 3 (3.9%) cases
of RSV coinfection, and 1 (1.3%) case with INF B coinfection.5(6.5%) of 38 (49.4%)
cases of non-COVID-19 were excluded by laboratory results and CT scan,consisting
of 3 (3.9%) cases with PCT greater than 0.5 ng/mL,were considered as bacterial
infection,and 2 (2.6%) cases were considered as MP coinfection (Supplement Table
1).The including 33 (42.9%) patients consisted of 3 (3.9%) cases of INF A, 2 (2.6%)
cases of INF B, 9 (11.7%) cases of RSV and 19 (18.2%) cases of unidentified
non-bacterial pathogens.
Compared with non-COVID-19 group (n=33), COVID-19 confirmed group
(n=39) had fewer fever(OR[95%CI]0.467[0.314-0.694]; P=.000) and symptoms of
ARI (0.533[0.36–0.788];P=.001),more asymptomatic (13.568[1.895-96.729];P=.000),
and more family cluster infections (5.077 [2.224-11.591];P=.000),while chest CT had

more positive findings of viral pneumonia (1.822[1.143-2.906];P=.008).Age
(6.9[3.6-10.5] vs 5[2.1-7.6];P=.088) and gender (43.6% vs 57.6%;P=.344) were
statistically insignificant (Table 1).Among all of 4 coinfection cases, 4 had fever and
symptoms of ARI, 3 had positive CT findings and 1 was family cluster infection
(Supplement Table 1).Compared with non-COVID-19 (n=33) and coinfection (n=4)
group,COVID-19 alone (n=35) group had significant statistical differences in PCT
(0.05[0.029-0.076] vs 0.103[0.053-0.21] and 0.144[0.109-2.26];P=.000,P=.010),
percentage of neutrophil (N%) (40.9[30-48.5] vs 54.8[41.4-67.5];P=.003), percentage
of lymphocyte (L%) (45.3[39.2-56.6] vs 33.2[22.7-42.5];P=.003),neutrophil count
(NC)

(2.25[1.43-3.53]

vs

3.33[2.8-5.18];P=.014),lymphocyte

count

(LC)

(2.68[1.99-4.01] vs 2.26 [1.67-2.92];P=.043),high sensitivity C-reactive protein
(hs-CRP) (5.5[1.1-9] vs 9.1[7.4-9.5];P=.007).while white blood cell (WBC) count,
hemoglobin (Hb) and platelet (PLT) were statistically insignificant (Table 2).
We grouped coinfections and non-COVID-19 infections into one category, and
used binary logistic regression analysis to screen independent differential diagnostic
indicators for COVID-19 alone infections.WBC,N%,L%,NC,LC, hs-CRP and PCT
were entered into a backward stepwise multivariate logistic regression model, and the
last step was to obtain two independent indicators of NC (P=0.082) and PCT
(P=0.000) (Table 3).Goodness of fit testing (Hosmer-Lemeshow test) was used to
assess deviations between observed and expected values. A P value of >.05 implies no
significant difference between the observed and expected values.The P value of the
goodness-of-fit testing of our model is 0.803, and therefore it is acceptable (Figure 1).

Analysis of the AUC of the ROC curve was constructed to assess the differentiating
performance.The AUC of overall model is 0.834 ([95%CI][0.741-0.926];P=.000).
PCT as a differential diagnostic indicator of COVID-19 alone, the AUC is 0.809
([0.710-0.909];P=.000) (Figure 1,Table 4).Considering the principle of practicability
and good accuracy, the PCT cut-off value is optimized and adjusted to 0.1ng/mL,the
sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of differentiating are 65.9%, 78.6%, 82.9%, and
59.2% (Table 5).
Discussion
Every winter and spring,a variety of virus infections are prevalent worldwide,
such as parainfluenza,RSV, INF A and B,rhinovirus and cytomegalovirus,etc [8,9]. A
significant number of community acquired pneumonia (CAP) are caused by viruses,
either directly or as part of a coinfection.The clinical picture of these different
pneumonias can be very similar, but viral infection is more common in the pediatric
populations.Despite great advances in virus detection and pneumonia imaging [4],
the identification and

differential diagnosis of viral infections has been facing

enormous challenges because laboratory detections and radiographic images are not
always in agreement with clinical features [10,11]. RT-PCR methods based on spike
gene and N gene were widely used for detecting nucleic acid,and were considered a
gold standard for COVID-19 confirmed [12-14]. However, this method had its
limitations, such as false positive or false negative results,time consuming,false
sampling,inconsistence of sample collections and preparations. Most importantly, the
inaccuracy of RT-PCR method caused problems in timely triage,isolating the source

of infection,the following reasonable treatment, early removal of isolation, and
improvement of psychological stress in children. In addition, CT changes in novel
coronaviral pneumonia are nonspecific and difficult to differentiate from other viral
infections [6,11]. Therefore, it is necessary to start from other clinical features and
laboratory data, independent of nucleic acid detection and chest CT, to provide a basis
for early differential diagnosis.
As a viral infection, it is obvious that children are especially susceptible to
COVID-19.Most of the infected children we observed are asymptomatic or mildly
febrile and or symptoms of ARI [3,15]. However, the changes of chest CT are very
typical of viral pneumonia [11], which is consistent with the results of other relevant
reports. Also,from the COVID-19 cases with coinfection, they all had fever and
symptoms of ARI, chest CT findings of viral pneumonia were also typical. Therefore,
COVID-19 with other viral coinfections may be more common in children [6].
Pediatric patients should be alert to the possibility of coinfection if severe symptoms
appear.Compared with other non-bacterial pathogens, COVID-19 has more family
cluster infections, which indicates that the virus is more infectious and has the ability
of sustained human-to-human transmission. When developing preventive and control
measures for children, disinfecting droplets and household environment and hand
hygiene may be the top priorities [16].
For the last two decades, most of studies have been carried out by using, alone or
in combination, WBC count, and serum hs-CRP and PCT concentration [17,18]. PCT
appears to be most effective in selecting bacterial cases and assessing severity.

However, the precise cut-offs between the separation of bacteria from viruses and the
separation between mild and severe separations have not been established [19]. In
adults,the normal reference value of PCT is less than 0.1 ng/mL. Between 0.1 and
0.25 ng/mL represents a viral infection. Between 0.25 and 0.5 ng/mL, bacterial or
bacterial coinfection is less likely to require antibiotic treatment.Data regarding
children, despite being limited, are consistent with those collected in adults. Li Z et al
found that serum PCT level could provide a useful method of distinguishing bacterial
coinfections from an H1N1 influenza infection alone in children during the early
disease phase[20].Chen ZM et al also suggested using a PCT>0.5 ng/mL to identify
COVID-19 with bacterial coinfections [7].
Our investigation also used the criterion of PCT>0.5 ng/mL to exclude bacterial
infection or coinfection. Three cases in the non-COVID-19 group considered bacterial
infections, and one case in the COVID-19 confirmed group had IFN B coinfection,
but the possibility of combined bacterial coinfection cannot be ruled out. Interestingly,
the PCT of the other three cases with RSV coinfection in the COVID-19 confirmed
group was still significantly higher than that of COVID-19 alone.Limited to
laboratory testing methods and personnel during the epidemic, except for COVID-19,
our hospital can only perform RT-PCR detection of IFN A, B, RSV and
cytomegalovirus.Unidentified nonbacterial infections may be other types of viral
infections. It also does not rule out that some 2019-nCoV infections may have these
other viral coinfection.
There are several limitations in our retrospective cohort study. First, due to the

small sample size of the single-center research hospital,in particular, there were only 4
cases in the coinfection group, which may have certain sampling errors. Second, the
children may be in different stages of disease when they are admitted to the
hospital.Therefore,these results should be carefully interpreted owing to potential
selection bias and residual confounding.Larger cohort studies from other cities in
China and other countries may also be needed to provide further data support.
Conclusions:
Asymptoms or mild symptoms,positive CT findings and family cluster infection
are the main clinical features of COVID-19 in children. With good performance,PCT
can provide an important basis for differentiating COVID-19 alone and other viral
infection or viral coinfection.
