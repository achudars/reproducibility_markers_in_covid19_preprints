Abstract

4

emergency worldwide. The objective of this systematic review was to characterize the clinical,

5

diagnostic, and treatment characteristics of patients presenting with COVID-19.

6

Methods: We conducted a structured search using PubMed/Medline, Embase, Web of Science

7

and the Cochrane Library to collect both case reports and case series on COVID-19 published up

8

to February 30, 2020.

9

Results: Thirty-four articles were included analyzing a total of 99 patients with a mean age of

10

46.2 years. The most common presenting symptom in patients who tested positive for COVID-

11

19 was fever, reported in up to 83% of patients from 76.4% of the analyzed studies. Other

12

symptoms including rhinorrhea, dizziness, and chills were less frequently reported. Additionally,

13

in studies which reported C-reactive protein (CRP) measurements (44%), a large majority of

14

patients displayed an elevated CRP (73%). Progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome

15

(ARDS) was the most common complication of patients testing positive for COVID-19 (33%).

16

CT images displayed ground-glass opacification (GGO) patterns (80%) as well as bilateral lung

17

involvement (71.0%). The most commonly used antiviral treatment modalities included,

18

lopinavir (HIV protease inhibitor), arbidiol hydrochloride (influenza fusion inhibitor), and

19

oseltamivir (neuraminidase inhibitor).

20

Conclusions: Development of ARDS may play a role in estimating disease progression and

21

mortality risk. Early detection of elevations in serum CRP, combined with a clinical COVID-19

22

symptom presentation may be used as a surrogate marker for presence and severity of disease.

23

There is a paucity of data surrounding the efficacy of treatments. There is currently not a well-

24

established gold standard therapy for the treatment of diagnosed COVID-19. Further prospective

25

investigations are necessary.

Introduction

30

Late in December 2019 and early in January 2020, reports of a very progressive pneumonia-like

31

respiratory syndrome, starting in Wuhan, China, induced global health concerns [1]. Soon after

32

the onset of disease, it was found that the pathogen was a new member of the coronaviridae

33

family, named SARS-COV-2 which is now called 2019-n-CoV [2]. The respiratory syndrome

34

caused by 2019-n-CoV is called COVID-19. COVID-19 is characterized by low-grade fever,

35

cough, dyspnea, lymphopenia, and ground-glass opacities on chest CT scan [3, 4]. COVID-19 is

36

a highly contagious disease, probably an aerosol born one, with human to human transmission

37

capacity which has implicated many countries all around the world [5]. In this review article, we

38

systematically surveyed case reports and case series from many countries in the world to give a

39

picture of the epidemiology, clinical presentations, laboratory changes, imaging findings,

40

diagnostic criteria, treatments, outcomes, prognostic factors, and risk factors of COVID-19.

Methods

42

This review conforms to the “Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-

43

Analyses” (PRISMA) statement [6].

44

Search strategy

45

We carried out systematic searches of the literature in the following bibliographical databases:

46

PubMed/Medline, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library. Search criteria included

47

articles published in the period from January 1, 2019, to February 30, 2020, and only included

48

articles published in English. The search terms for our review were: COVID-19, severe acute

49

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, nCoV disease, SARS2,

50

COVID-19, 2019-nCoV, coronavirus disease-19, coronavirus disease 2019, and 2019 novel

51

coronavirus.

52

Study Selection

53

Studies included in the review met the following criteria: prospective or retrospective descriptive

54

case reports and case series of COVID-19 in the hospital setting which included diagnostic

55

methods, clinical manifestations, laboratory features, treatment, and outcomes. Articles

56

describing experimental approaches as well as reviews and publications without peer-review

57

processes were excluded.

58

All potentially relevant articles were screened in two stages for eligibility. In the first stage, the

59

titles and abstracts of potentially relevant articles were screened independently by two reviewers

60

(YF, PJ). In the second stage of assessment, the full text of those abstracts which met the

61

inclusion criteria was retrieved and independently reviewed by the same authors. Disagreements

62

and technical uncertainties were discussed and resolved between review authors (AT, SH, MA,

63

MJN).

64

Data extraction

65

The extracted data included bibliographic data, patient demographics (e.g., age and gender),

66

radiological and laboratory findings, treatment protocols, and medical consequences. Two

67

authors (AT, SH) independently extracted the data from the selected studies. The data was jointly

68

reconciled, and disagreements were discussed and resolved between review authors (YF, PJ,

69

MA, MJN).

71

As illustrated in Figure 1, our systematic search resulted in an initial number of 1102 of

72

potentially relevant articles, of which 346 were excluded by title and abstract evaluation.

73

Applying the inclusion/exclusion criteria to the full-text documents, 34 articles were eligible for

74

inclusion in the systematic review. 23 case reports and 11 case series from 9 countries were

75

identified with a total of 99 unique cases of COVID-19. RT-PCR COVID-19 was present in 32

76

(94%) articles as inclusion criteria. In addition to RT-PCR, CT scan served as a diagnostic tool in

77

14 (41.0%) of papers. Reported comorbidities included hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular

78

disease, and pulmonary disease. Hypertension was investigated the most, studied in 7/34 (20%)

79

of papers. Of the 16 COVID-19 positive patients found in the studies investigating hypertension,

80

8 patients were hypertensive (50%). (Table 2). Lymphopenia was reported in 10 studies which

81

identified 12/21 (57%) of COVID-19 positive patients with lymphopenia. Additionally, in

82

studies which reported C-reactive protein (CRP) measurements (44%), a large majority of

83

patients displayed an elevated CRP (73%). CT imaging was used as a diagnostic and prognostic

84

tool in 8 studies. CT images commonly displayed ground-glass opacification (GGO) patterns

85

(80%) as well as bilateral lung involvement (71.0%). Progression to acute respiratory distress

86

syndrome (ARDS) was the most common complication of patients testing positive for COVID-

87

19. We found 2/34 (5.8%) reports on Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), 2 of 6

88

(33%) investigated cases had ARDS. Morality outcomes were difficult to assess; only two

89

studies showed mortality data in which 2/2 COVID-19 patients died. A wide range of therapeutic

90

modalities were tried across studies, with antiviral treatments being the most used. Common

91

antiviral treatment modalities included lopinavir (HIV protease inhibitor), arbidiol hydrochloride

92

(influenza fusion inhibitor), and oseltamivir (neuraminidase inhibitor). In Table 3 we summarize

93

all of the drugs used.

Discussion:

96

The 2019 novel coronavirus has been declared a public health emergency worldwide. The World

97

Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic affecting 110 countries around the

98

world with continued global spread. The 2019-nCoV is likely to be transmitted by asymptomatic

99

individuals [7]. Asymptomatic transfer leads to lower prevalence estimates and higher

100

transmission rates in the community. Until universal screening and vaccination become

101

available, it is necessary to trace close contacts of those testing positive for COVID-19 and

102

quarantining contacts to prevent asymptomatic transmission.

103

According to the articles we included, 2019-nCoV can only be transferred from person to

104

person[8]. Chen et al suggested that they had no evidence of vertical transmission from mother to

105

child [9]. Any person infected with 2019-nCoV can develop a clinical course of Covid-19.

106

However, it is reported to cause the most severe symptoms such as respiratory failure in older

107

men with comorbidities[10]. Children, teenagers, and younger people mostly showed a mild

108

presentation of the disease [11].

109

Based on our reviewed articles, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and pulmonary

110

disease were the most common morbidities among COVID-19 patients. This point was also

111

mentioned in Alraddadi et al. study about MERS-CoV patients [12]. They showed that

112

individuals with comorbidities like diabetes, smoking, and cardiovascular disease were

113

associated with a more severe clinical course [12]. According to Yang et al., chronic diseases can

114

debilitate the immune system and make proinflammatory conditions, leading to more severe

115

infection and subsequently higher mortality rates [13].

116

According to the included studies, the most common clinical manifestations were fever, cough,

117

dyspnea, and myalgia or fatigue. Less common clinical manifestations included nausea or

118

vomiting, dizziness, rhinorrhea, and chills. Liu et al reported that infants had mild clinical

119

manifestations and a better prognosis. Furthermore, some asymptomatic cases were seen among

120

children.

121

The most common abnormal laboratory changes were lymphopenia, high concentrations of C-

122

reactive protein, and elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase; however, we do not know the

123

exact pathogenesis and the reason for these alterations. Laboratory abnormalities may indicate

124

the severity of disease and developing complications. According to Huang et al., most patients

125

with secondary infection had a procalcitonin level greater than 0.5 ng/Ml and ICU patients had

126

higher levels of prothrombin time and D-dimer [14]. Also, Liu et al.

127

hypoalbuminemia, lymphopenia, high concentrations of CRP, and elevated LDH to predict

128

severity of acute lung injury[3]. Higher levels of angiotensin II are also proposed to be related to

129

acute lung injury [3]. Meanwhile, non-survivors are suggested to have higher D-dimer and FDP

130

levels, longer PT and aPTT, and lower fibrinogen and antithrombin levels [15].

131

CT scan as a diagnostic tool can be used to evaluate severity of pulmonary involvement and

132

monitor clinical progression. CT scan has good sensitivity and can be used to establish COVID-

133

19 diagnosis in patients who are highly suspicious based on epidemiologic history and clinical

134

manifestations, but have negative PCR-based test results [16, 17]. It is important to highlight that

135

the CT scan can be normal during initial days, and a normal CT scan in a suspected case would

136

never definitely rule out the diagnosis of COVID-19 [18]. Moreover, the CT scan is dynamic in

137

patients with COVID-19 and changes rapidly [19-21]. The earliest abnormal finding in the CT

138

scan is the appearance of ground-glass opacities in peripheral and sub-pleural areas [22]. As the

139

disease progresses, the GGO’s will expand and distribute more, most commonly to the right

140

lower lung lobes. Later findings include consolidations, paving patterns, thickening of lobar

141

fissures and adjacent pleura. Pleural effusion, hilar lymphadenopathies, and mediastinal

142

lymphadenopathies are not common findings and have only been reported scarcely [23]. Lung

143

pathology can progress to a “white lung” with low functional capacity or heal with some fibrotic

144

remnants [24]. Dynamic changes in the lungs seen on CT imaging will continue even after the

145

patient’s discharge [22]. In fact, CT scan findings have prognostic value in some patients, as Shi

146

et al. have reported, deterioration on follow-up CT scan, old age, male sex, and underlying

147

comorbidities are associated with poor prognosis.

148

ARDS was the most common complication among the confirmed COVID-19 patients;

149

development of ARDS increased risk of patient morality[25]. Huang et al reported that the

150

median time from onset of symptoms to the development of ARDS was 9 days [14]. Other

151

complications were acute cardiac injury, acute kidney injury, secondary infection, and shock that

152

lead to multiple organ failure [26, 27]. ICU patients in comparison to non-ICU patients were also

153

more likely to have complications [28]. The mortality rate was higher in critically ill patients as

154

well as in older patients with comorbidities and ARDS. Yang et al reported that the median

155

duration from ICU admission to death was 7 days [25]. The window between the presentation to

156

the time of ICU admission and/or development of ARDS is an optimal time for medical

157

intervention.

158

There are many challenges in COVID-19 therapeutic strategies. There is currently no cure for

159

COVID-19. However, pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic symptom management and

160

supportive care measures should be given to all patients with symptomatic COVID-19. Other

161

various therapeutic strategies have been trialed in patients with COVID-19 with the goal of

162

slowing disease progression. There is a paucity of data surrounding the efficacy of treatments. Of

163

the case controls and case series we included, antiviral agents including HIV protease inhibitors

164

(lopinavir and ritonavir) as well as anti-influenza compounds (oseltamivir and arbidol) were used

165

as treatment regimens. Unfortunately, we didn’t have enough information about the efficacy of

166

each regimen; however, according to some studies, anti-HIV based medications could have

167

benefits in more rapid improvement of clinical manifestations and decrease in viral load [19, 20,

168

29].

169

In conclusion, we discussed the clinical symptoms, laboratory abnormalities, common

170

comorbidities, imaging modalities, and potential therapeutic options in COVID-19. We indicated

171

that the most common symptoms were fever, cough, and dyspnea, but some young infected cases

172

had no signs or symptoms. ARDS was the most common reported complication and was

173

associated with poor prognosis. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, countries are

174

scrambling to produce enough RT-PCR diagnostic tests. Diagnostic information from other

175

surrogate markers would be valuable if markers proved to be sensitive and specific. Namely, we

176

learned that laboratory data like CRP may not only be related to the severity of disease, but it

177

may be predictive of disease outcomes. Further studies are needed to relate quantified elevations

178

in CRP to disease severity. Due to the high sensitivity of CT scan, it is considered as a good

179

diagnostic tool. However, it should be kept in mind that a normal CT scan will never rule out the

180

diagnosis of COVID-19 in a highly suspicious case based on history and clinical findings. Lastly,

181

there are different therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 patients, but we don’t have enough data

182

for their efficacy. Additional investigations including randomized controlled trials will be

183

necessary to further our understanding in the treatment of COVID-19.
