ABSTRACT

Rapid detection of pathogenic sequences or variants in DNA and RNA through
a point-of-care diagnostic approach is valuable for accelerated clinical
prognosis as has been witnessed during the recent COVID-19 outbreak.
Traditional methods relying on qPCR or sequencing are difficult to implement
in settings with limited resources necessitating the development of accurate
alternative testing strategies that perform robustly. Here, we present FnCas9
Editor Linked Uniform Detection Assay (FELUDA) that employs a direct Cas9
based enzymatic readout for detecting nucleotide sequences and identifying
nucleobase identity without the requirement of trans-cleavage activity of
reporter molecules. We demonstrate that FELUDA is 100% accurate in
detecting single nucleotide variants (SNVs) including heterozygous carriers of
a mutation and present a simple design strategy in the form of a web-tool,
JATAYU, for its implementation. FELUDA is semi quantitative, can be adapted
to multiple signal detection platforms and can be quickly designed and
deployed for versatile applications such as infectious disease outbreaks like
COVID-19. Using a lateral flow readout within 1h, FELUDA shows 100%
sensitivity and 97% specificity across all range of viral loads in clinical
samples. In combination with RT-RPA and a smartphone application True
Outcome Predicted via Strip Evaluation (TOPSE), we present a prototype for
FELUDA for CoV-2 detection at home.

INTRODUCTION

The rise of CRISPR Cas9 based approaches for biosensing nucleic acids has
opened up a broad diagnostic portfolio for CRISPR products beyond their standard
genome editing abilities1,2. In recent times, CRISPR components have been
successfully used to detect a wide variety of nucleic acid targets such as those
obtained from pathogenic microorganisms or disease-causing mutations from
various biological specimens3-10. At the heart of such a detection procedure lies the
property of CRISPR proteins to accurately bind to target DNA or RNA, undergo
conformational changes leading to cleavage of targets generating a reporter-based
signal outcome11-15. To enable such a detection mechanism to be safe, sensitive and

reproducible across a large variety of targets, the accuracy of DNA interrogation and
subsequent enzyme activity is extremely critical, particularly when clinical decisions
are to be made based on these results1,2.
Current technologies relying on using CRISPR components for nucleic acid detection
can sense the identity of the target either through substrate cleavage mediated by an
active CRISPR ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex or by binding through a catalytically
inactive RNP complex. Cleavage outcomes are then converted to a reporter-based
readout with or without signal amplification1. Among the CRISPR proteins that have
been used so far, Cas12 and Cas13 have obtained Emergency Usage Authorization
(EUA) for diagnostic use during the COVID-19 pandemic16-17. However each of these
approaches has its own strengths and limitations that are related to sensitivity to
mismatches and ease of design for wide variety of targets. For example, to genotype
individuals with high confidence, including careers of a single nucleotide variant
(SNV), Cas12 requires individual sgRNA design and optimization for every target7
which increases the complexity and thus the time taken for design and deployment
of a diagnostic test. Importantly, both Cas12/Cas13 unleash a secondary reporter
activity upon activation, leading to possible loss of information about starting copy
numbers of the target16-17. Taken together, development of a detection pipeline
based on a highly specific Cas protein with a direct binding or cleavage based
readout can significantly increase the sensitivity of detection and reduce the time and
cost of CRISPR based diagnostics (CRISPRDx), This is especially crucial for pointof-care (POC) applications where complex experimentation or setup of reaction
components are not feasible.
We have recently reported a Cas9 ortholog from Francisella novicida (FnCas9)
showing very high mismatch sensitivity both under in vitro and in vivo conditions18-20.
This is based on its negligible binding affinity to substrates that harbor mismatches, a
property that is distinct from engineered Cas proteins showing similar high
specificity21. We reasoned that FnCas9 mediated DNA interrogation and subsequent
cleavage can both be adapted for accurately identifying any single nucleotide
variants (SNVs) provided that the fundamental mechanism of discrimination is
consistent across all sequences. We name this approach FnCas9 Editor Linked
Uniform Detection Assay (FELUDA) and demonstrate its utility in various
pathological conditions including genetic disorders. Notably, due to its ease of design
and implementation for new targets, we were successful in deploying it for a ready3

to-use diagnostic kit during the COVID-19 outbreak that has successfully completed
regulatory validation in India22-24.

RESULTS

FELUDA distinguishes between nucleotide sequences differing by 1 mismatch

To identify a SNV with high accuracy, we first sought to investigate if FnCas9 can be
directed to cleave the wild type (WT) allele at a SNV by placing an additional MM in
the sgRNA sequence specific to the SNV (Supplementary Figure 1A). To test this,
we selected sickle cell anemia (SCA), a global autosomal recessive genetic disorder
caused by a point mutation (GAG>GTG) 25-26. By fixing the position of the SNV and
walking along the entire length of the sgRNA, we discovered that two mismatches at
the PAM proximal 2nd and 6th positions completely abrogated the cleavage of the
SNV target while leaving the WT target intact (Supplementary Figure 1B). We tested
FELUDA on DNA cloned from 6 SCA patients and a healthy control and obtained a
clearly identifiable signature for SNV in every case (Supplementary Figure 1C).
Importantly, the same design principle for searching and discriminating can be
universally applied to other Mendelian SNVs without the need for optimization
(Supplementary Figure 1D). To aid users for quick design and implement FELUDA
for a target SNV, we have developed a web tool JATAYU (Junction for Analysis and
Target Design for Your FELUDA assay) that incorporates the above features and
generates primer sequences for amplicon and sgRNA synthesis (https://
jatayu.igib.res.in, Supplementary Figure 1E).
FELUDA diagnosis is adaptable to direct binding-based outcomes

We next sought to adapt FELUDA for fluorescent detection. Unlike Cas12/Cas13
based CRISPRDx platforms, FnCas9 is not reported to produce collateral activity on
substrates, so FELUDA is not suitable for trans-cleavage signal output. To
circumvent this, we envisioned FELUDA as a direct, non-cleavage, affinity-based
method of detection which works with single nucleotide mismatch sensitivity. We first
investigated if a catalytically inactive dead FnCas9 (dFnCas9) tagged with a
fluorophore (GFP) is adept in sensing a point mutation at DNA using Microscale

Thermophoresis (MST) (Figure 1A). We observed that using FELUDA specific
sgRNAs (having 2 mismatches with WT), the WT substrate exhibited negligible
dFnCas9-GFP binding (Kd = 1037.4 nM ± 93.3 nM) while the SCD substrate showed
moderately strong binding (Kd = 187.2 nM ± 3.4 nM) (Figure 1A and Supplementary
Figure 2A). This is consistent with the in vitro cleavage (IVC) outcomes on the two
substrates (Supplementary Figure 1C). Importantly, both Streptococcus pyogenes
Cas9 (SpCas9) and its engineered High-Fidelity variant (dSpCas9-HF1-GFP)
showed strong binding to WT substrate with sgRNAs containing 2 mismatches
(144.9 ± 11.8 nM and 153.6 ± 19.8 nM respectively) establishing that the inherent
DNA interrogation properties of FnCas9 are responsible for discriminating single
mismatched targets with very high specificity (Figure 1A). We then developed a
pipeline to adapt FELUDA for an affinity-based fluorescent read-out system, where
an amplification step generates biotinylated products that can then be immobilized
on magnetic streptavidin beads (Figure 1B). Upon incubation with dFnCas9-GFP,
enzymatic binding to the substrate leads to loss of fluorescence signal in the
supernatant allowing FELUDA to discriminate between SCA and WT samples
(Figure 1B).
FELUDA accurately genotypes carriers of Mendelian variants

Although sickle cell trait (SCT) individuals are generally non-symptomatic, carrier
screening is vital to prevent the spread of SCA in successive generations and is
widely employed in SCA control programs in various parts of the world26. Since
FELUDA outcomes are reflected by binding to substrate molecules, it resulted in
clearly distinguishable signatures between the SCA, SCT and WT DNA obtained
from patient’s saliva samples (Supplementary Figure 2B). To address the robustness
of detecting the 3 genotype categories, we performed a blinded experiment using
DNA obtained from 49 subjects with all three SCA genotypes from a CSIR-Sickle
Cell Anaemia Mission Laboratory in Chhattisgarh state of India. Remarkably,
FELUDA identified all three genotypes with 100% accuracy and the results perfectly
matched with Sanger sequencing data generated on same samples in a different
laboratory (CSIR-Center for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Genome Research on
Complex Diseases Lab) (Figure 1C).

PAMmer based amplification releases PAM dependency on FELUDA design

We made several improvements to FELUDA for expanding and simplifying its
detection spectrum. To detect non-PAM proximal SNVs we installed an in-built PAM
site in the amplification step of FELUDA (PAMmer) and successfully validated this
approach using 2 SNVs (A2142G and A2143G) present in Helicobacter pylori 23s
rRNA gene which confers variable clarithromycin resistance in patients with gastric
ulcers27-29(Supplementary Figure 2C-D). Next, we tried to reduce PAM dependency
on sgRNA design further by exploring if FELUDA could be performed with a single
mismatch in the sgRNA. In line with previous reports, we found that FnCas9 shows
negligible cleavage with sgRNAs containing mismatches at the PAM distal end and
in particular, mismatch at PAM distal 16th base showed complete absence of
cleavage or binding (Supplementary Figure 3A-B). We confirmed this strategy by
targeting the SNV rs713598 (G>C) in different individuals and successfully identified
their genotypes

30

(Supplementary Figure 3C). We also show that FELUDA based

detection can work robustly across a wide temperature range and up to 3 days post
thawing of reaction components (at room temperature). Thus, field studies using
FELUDA can be conducted in diverse climatic conditions and reaction components
can be successfully used following cold chain transportation (Supplementary Figure
4A-B).

FELUDA on paper strip can accurately predict COVID-19 outcomes

The recent outbreak of Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) due to SARS-CoV-2
virus provided an opportunity to expand the scope of above-mentioned approach of
FELUDA and make a difference in the ongoing public health emergency throughout
the world. In addition to general social distancing, identification of infected individuals
and, screening their contacts for possible quarantine measures is one of the major
steps in reducing community transmission of this virus31-33. Although quantitative
Real-Time (qRT) PCR is considered a gold standard test for detecting active COVID19 cases, such tests are expensive, have long turn-around times and require a
dedicated qRT-PCR machine, hence is of limited utility in handling an emergency of
this scale. We sought to repurpose FELUDA as a lateral flow assay (LFA) for the

detection of SARS-CoV-2 that is low-cost, does not need complex instrumentation,
and is highly accurate in diagnosis. To enable such a diagnosis on commercially
available paper strips we enabled the chemistry of capturing RNP-bound biotinylated
substrate molecules on a distinct test line of the paper strip using FAM labeled
chimeric gRNA (Figure 2A and Supplementary Figure 5A). Using an optimized single
step Reverse Transcription-PCR protocol followed by FELUDA, we developed an
assay that can detect SARS-CoV-2 sequences from RNA samples within an hour
(Figure 2B and Supplementary Figure 5B, Supplementary Note 1). We tested up to
21 targets across the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome and identified two regions (in the
viral N and S genes) which are present at high copy numbers34-35 and reported
negligible number of mutations in publicly available datasets36-37 (63,997, GISAID
submissions till September 7, 2020) (Figure 2C, Supplementary Figure 6A.
Supplementary Table 1). Through extensive optimization of PCR and reaction
components, FELUDA reached a limit of detection (LOD) of ~10 copies of purified
viral sequence (Figure 2D, Supplementary Figure 6B). Upon gradual dilution of
patient RNA, both FELUDA and qRT-PCR was able to detect samples till the same
dilution range (Supplementary Figure 6C). Since visual detection can occasionally
have an operator-bias, particularly when the signal is very faint, we developed a
smartphone app TOPSE (True Outcome Predicted via Strip Evaluation) to assist
detection by returning a predictive score based on background correction (Figure 2E,
Supplementary Note 2, and Supplementary Movie 1).

FELUDA shows high concordance with gold standard qRT-PCR in detecting
nCoV-2 infection

FELUDA detection is semi-quantitative (due to stoichiometric binding of FnCas9
RNP:target) and therefore shows a strong negative correlation between Ct values
and signal intensities (Figure 3A). This makes it uniquely placed among CRISPRDx
platforms to accurately predict the viral load in patient samples with high
reproducibility between assays (Figure 3B)16-17.
We first performed FELUDA using one gene (N), single pass assay on qRT-PCR
confirmed 473 samples and obtained a sensitivity of 85.3% (116/136) and specificity
of 96.7% (326/337) with qRT-PCR (Figure 3C, Supplementary Dataset 1). Among
the samples that showed discordance between FELUDA with qRT-PCR, 8 false

negative FELUDA samples and 10 false positive FELUDA samples were picked up
for a repeat evaluation by FELUDA and qRT-PCR. Surprisingly a repetition of
FELUDA with double the amount of RNA yielded positive signals in 6/8 (75%) of
samples and a repeat qPCR yielded positive signals in 5/10 (50%) of initially
classified negative samples (Supplementary Figure 7A-B). This underscores the
error rates seen in a single run assay and has been reported elsewhere38. To
improve FELUDA accuracy, we combined assays for both N and S genes, doubled
the starting RNA amount and performed FELUDA with 81 qRT-PCR confirmed
samples. Remarkably we obtained a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 97% and
were able to accurately detect samples up to a high Ct value of 37 showing the
robustness of the assay (Figure 3D, Supplementary Figure 7C, Supplementary
Dataset 2). Based on the above results, we have completed the non-exclusive
licensing of FELUDA and the technology has successfully concluded third party
evaluation and regulatory validation in India.
FELUDA can be adapted to a point-of-care or home testing assay

Understanding the need for more testing, especially in the wake of rising numbers
and predictions of a second wave of infection39, we have implemented a PCR
machine free version of FELUDA using Recombinase Polymerase Amplification
(RPA)40,41 that can detect SARS-CoV2 RNA in biological samples within 30 min
(Figure 4A, Supplementary Note 1). Finally, to adapt FELUDA for possible home
testing in the future, we have successfully developed a 15 min benchtop method for
RNA extraction from saliva and an on-body 30 min RPA-FELUDA (tested using
synthetic RNA fragments), thus generating an end-to-end instrumentation free
testing protocol (Figure 4B-C, Supplementary Figure 7D, Supplementary Movie 2,
Supplementary Note 1).
DISCUSSION

In this study, we developed a FnCas9 based test for detecting a wide range of
pathogenic SNVs and nucleotide sequences. We were able to design a scalable
version of the test that is point-of-care, requires minimal equipment and validate the
test on a large number of clinical samples. Our results suggest that FELUDA is

suitable for SARS-CoV2 diagnosis with similar degree of accuracy as the currently
accepted gold standard qRT-PCR test and can replace it in resource limited settings
where qRT-PCR machine is not available or for mass scale community screening.
In this study we report three different modes of FELUDA readout. On the basis of
cleavage, an agarose gel electrophoresis analysis gives the most accurate readouts
at the level of single mismatch distinction, particularly in detecting carriers of SCA
mutation. Although such a test is viable in lab settings and performed with 100%
accuracy in blinded samples, this might not be suitable in places where conducting
electrophoresis experiments is challenging. For such scenarios, a microfluidicsbased fragment analyzer combined with a portable hand-held PCR might be more
suitable42.
Genotyping carrier individuals with heterozygosity though sequencing-free methods
systems is often complicated and requires extensive optimization of assay
conditions43. The overall design of the assay is based on the high specificity of
FnCas9 interaction with DNA substrates. We systematically analyzed mismatches at
different positions of the sgRNA against a target and obtained a robust design
parameter where presence of 2 mismatches (PAM proximal 2nd and 6th) or 1
mismatch (PAM distal 16th) in the sgRNA abrogates the binding and cleavage of the
target using FnCas9. This strategy has worked across all targets tested so far in this
study suggesting that designing FELUDA sgRNAs follows a consistent principle
which is independent of DNA target sequence. This has been implemented in the
JATAYU tool. Designing and validation of complex targets (such as with repeats or
variable GC content) need to be undertaken to establish this further.
There are certain limitations of FELUDA which the COVID-19 pandemic gave an
opportunity to address. The LFA gives a semi-quantitative readout of viral load in a
given sample. However, for accurate and sensitive diagnosis it is imperative that a
large number of primer and sgRNA pairs are tested to account for robust readout,
prevention of off-target amplification and minimizing chances of targeting mutated
viral regions44. Of the 21 regions we targeted, only two (N and S gene) satisfied
these criteria (Supplementary Table 1). Importantly, optimized conditions and highquality PCR reagents are necessary to ensure robust and consistent FELUDA
results (Supplementary Figure 6B).
We uncovered inconsistencies in qRT PCR Ct values between samples that were
measured before and after freezing (Supplementary Figure 7A-B). This is relevant

when comparing validation of new tests with results of qPCR-validated samples from
the freezer, particularly those with high Ct values (Supplementary Figure 8). Indeed,
our single gene FELUDA done on frozen samples and compared with qRT-PCR
done at an earlier time point was less sensitive than double gene FELUDA on
samples where simultaneous qPCR was done (Figure 3C-D).
The on-body RT-RPA FELUDA prototype combined with extraction-free RNA
isolation can potentially bring the benefits of testing to home. Although RT-RPA is
rapid and sensitive, it is also prone to aerosol-based contamination necessitating an
efficient cold-chain transportation of pre-pipetted components to minimize user
handling45. It is imperative to test this prototype on a larger number of clinical
samples to establish its accuracy.
Taken together, FELUDA is an accurate and low-cost CRISPR based diagnostic
assay to detect nucleic acids and variations. A two-gene FELUDA assay for SARSCoV2 costs ~7 USD (Supplementary Table 2). Its single-mismatch sensitivity to
nucleic acids expands its application portfolio to a large number of sectors not limited
to healthcare. Its ease of design and implementation, as exemplified by its urgent
deployment during the COVID-19 health crisis offers immense possibilities for rapid
and wide-spread testing that has so far proven to be successful in spreading the
progression of the disease in multiple countries.

Sequences containing WT, SCT and SCA were amplified using primers with/without
5’ biotinylation from genomic DNA extracted from saliva or blood samples.

Detection via In vitro Cleavage (IVC):
DNA or RNA converted to DNA were PCR amplified to be used as a substrate in in
vitro cleavage assay, optimized in our previous study. ~100ng of purified DNA
amplicon was incubated in reaction buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH7.5, 150mM KCl, 1mM
DTT, 10% glycerol, 10mM MgCl2) along with reconstituted RNP complex (500nM) at

Ԩ for 30 minutes and cleaved products were visualized on agarose gel.

Detection via Fluorescence Detection:
DNA regions from Hbb locus (WT & SCA) were amplified using biotinylated primers.
dFnCas9-GFP: sgRNA (180 nM:540 nM) RNP complex was reconstituted at 25°C for
10 mins in reaction buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH7.5, 150mM KCl, 1mM DTT, 10%
glycerol, 10mM MgCl2). Meanwhile, 6µL of the Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin C1
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) were prepared. Beads were incubated with 1µM of
biotinylated Hbb amplicon (WT & SCA) for 30 minutes in the reaction buffer. Further,
dFnCas9-GFP RNP complex was incubated with the streptavidin bound PCR
amplicon for 30 minutes. Emission spectra of unbound dFnCas9-GFP was measured
using Monolith NT. 115 (NanoTemper Technologies GmbH, Munich, Germany)
under 60% excitation power in blue filter (465-490nm excitation wavelength; 500550nm emission wavelength) with medium MST power.

Detection via Lateral Flow Detection:
Chimeric gRNA (crRNA:TracrRNA) was prepared by mixing crRNA and synthetic 3'FAM labelled TracrRNA in a equimolar ratio within annealing buffer (100mM NaCl,
50mM Tris-HCl pH 8 and 1mM MgCl2), heated at 95C for 2-5 minutes and then
allowed to cool at room temperature for 15-20 min. Chimeric gRNA-dead FnCas9
RNP complex (500nM) was prepared by mixing them in buffer (20mM HEPES,
pH7.5, 150mM KCl, 1mM DTT, 10% glycerol, 10mM MgCl2) and incubated for 10
min at RT. Target (WT & SCA) biotinylated amplicons were then incubated with the
RNP complexes for 15 min at 37°C. Dipstick buffer was added to the reaction mix
along with Milenia HybriDetect 1 lateral flow strip. Allow the solution to migrate into
the strip for 2 minutes at room temperature and observe the result.

FnCas9 cold chain activity (upon storage at RT):
Post thaw FnCas9 for varied time points starting from 0Hrs to 100Hrs, FnCas9sgRNA complex (500nM) was prepared in a buffer (20mM HEPES, pH7.5, 150mM
KCl, 1mM DTT, 10% glycerol, 10mM MgCl2). To monitor cleavage activity on
linearized DNA plasmid, IVC assays were performed for 30 min with/without 10%
sucrose. The reaction was then terminated using 1µl of Proteinase K (Ambion) and
removing residual RNA by RNase A (Purelink), cleaved products were visualized on
agarose gel.
Microscale thermophoresis:
For the binding experiment using Monolith NT. 115 (NanoTemper Technologies
GmbH, Munich, Germany), dFnCas9-GFP protein along with 12% Urea-PAGE
purified IVT sgRNAs were used. RNP complex (Protein:sgRNA molar ratio,1:1) was
prepared at 25C for 10 min in buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 150mM KCl, 1mM
DTT, 10mM MgCl2). Target dsDNA were formed using HPLC purified 30bp ssDNA
oligos (Sigma) by incubating them for 5 min at 95C and then slow cool at 25C.
dsDNA target sequences varying in concentration (ranging from 0.7nM to 25μM)
were incubated with RNP complex at 37C for 60 min in reaction buffer.
NanoTemper standard treated capillaries were used for loading the sample.
Measurements were performed at 25°C using 40% LED power in blue filter (465490nm excitation wavelength; 500-550nm emission wavelength) and 40% MST
power. Data was analysed using NanoTemper analysis software and plotted using
OriginPro 8.5 software.

Sanger Sequencing:
The sequencing reaction was carried out using Big dye Terminator v3.1 cycle
sequencing kit (ABI, 4337454) in 10μl volume (containing 0.5μl purified DNA, 0.8μl
sequencing reaction mix, 2μl 5X dilution buffer and 0.6μl forward/ reverse primer)
with the following cycling conditions - 3 min at 95°C, 40 cycles of (10 sec at 95°C, 10
sec at 55°C, 4 min at 60°C) and 10 min at 4°C. Subsequently, the PCR product was
purified by mixing with 12μl of 125mM EDTA (pH 8.0) and incubating at RT for 5 min.
50μl of absolute ethanol and 2μl of 3M NaOAc (pH 4.8) were then added, incubated
at RT for 10 min and centrifuged at 3800rpm for 30 min, followed by invert spin at
<300rpm to discard the supernatant. The pellet was washed twice with 100μl of 70%
ethanol at 4000rpm for 15 min and supernatant was discarded by invert spin. The
pellet was air dried, dissolved in 12μl of Hi-Di formamide (Thermo fisher, 4311320),
denatured at 95°C for 5 min followed by snapchill, and linked to ABI 3130xl
sequencer. Base calling was carried out using sequencing analysis software (v5.3.1)
(ABI, US) and sequence was analyzed using Chromas v2.6.5 (Technelysium,
Australia).

Disease selection from ClinVar Database:
ClinVar dataset (version: 20180930) was used to find out disease variation spectrum
that can be targeted by FELUDA46. SNVs which are situated 2bp upstream of the
PAM sequence were extracted. Further, SNVs with valid OMIM ID having
Pathogenic effects were filtered. Finally, variations with higher frequency in Indian
Population were selected for the validation using customized python script.

JATAYU, web tool to design sgRNAs and primer for the SNV detection. When
provided valid genomic DNA sequence with position and type of variation. JATAYU
user interface has been created using Bootstrap 4 and jQuery. And works with a
customized python-based Flask framework along with genome analysis tools like
BWA (Burrows-Wheeler aligner) and bedtools47-48. Working script is available at
https://github.com/asgarhussain/JATAYU.
RT-PCR-FELUDA primer and crRNA design:
To design, crRNA specific to SARS-COV 2, genome sequences were downloaded
from GISAID (5). crRNAs were designed by searching any 20 nucleotides followed
by NGG PAM. Further, to remove non-specific crRNA, off-target analysis was done
by mapping them to human host viruses from Influenza Virus Database37 and human
transcriptome (GENCODE GRCh38). Finally, 21 crRNAs with higher conservation
frequency across SARS-COV 2, genome sequences in the GISAID dataset were
selected35. Target PCR Primer sequences flanking these crRNAs are also
investigated for off-targets on human transcriptome (GENCODE GRCh38).

Mutation frequency of the crRNA were routinely checked across GISAID datasets
(63,997 genomes as of 7th Sep. 2020). Custom python script and SeqMap49 were
used to design crRNAs and calling mutations (Supplementary Table 1).

FELUDA Limit of detection (LOD):
Synthetic genomic Target for N gene was serially diluted (1:10, 7 times) from ~4x106
copies/µl to perform FELUDA reaction. Test band intensity was calculated using
TOPSE app (Repeated in three independent experiments).
qRT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 detection:
SARS-CoV-2 positive patient sample was titrated (1:10, 8 times), qRT-PCR was
performed using STANDARD M nCoV Real-Time Detection kit (SD Biosensor) as
per manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, per reaction 3µl of RTase mix and 0.25µl of
Internal Control A was added to 7µl of reaction solution. 5µl of each of the negative
control, positive control, and patient sample nucleic acid extract was added to the
PCR mixture dispensed in each reaction tube. The cycling conditions on instrument
were as follows: Reverse transcription 50

℃ for 15 minute, Initial denaturation 95℃

Extraction free detection of RNA from Saliva samples.
Saliva RNA was extracted from 3 patient samples using RNeasy Kit (Qiagen). For
extraction free detection, lysis buffer was prepared by adding 0.5% Triton X-100 in
50mM Tris Buffer pH 5. 0.2U/μl RNase Inhibitor (EUROGENTEC) was added to this
buffer solution. 200µl of saliva specimen was collected in a 1.5ml eppendorf tube.
100µl of prepared lysis buffer solution was pipetted to the tube and mixed by flicking.
The tube was incubated at 95°C for 5 minutes on a dry bath after and left
undisturbed on bench for 10 min.
One step qRT-PCR was performed by adding 1 µl Reverse Transcriptase (Qiagen)
to reaction mix with LightCycler® 480 SYBR Green I Master (Roche). ACTB specific
primers at a final concentration of 0.2µM. qRT-PCR reactions were performed using
