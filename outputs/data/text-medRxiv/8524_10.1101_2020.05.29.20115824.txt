Summary
Introduction

Determinants of hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death are still unclear
for Covid-19 and only a few studies have adjusted for confounding for different clinical
outcomes including all reported cases in a country. We used routine surveillance data from
Portugal to identify risk factors for COVID-19 outcomes, in order to support risk stratification,
clinical and public health interventions, and scenarios to plan health care resources.
Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study including 20,293 laboratory confirmed cases of
COVID-19 in Portugal extracted in April 28 2020, electronically through the National Epidemic
Surveillance System of the Directorate-General of Health(DGS). We calculated absolute risks,
relative risks (RR) and adjusted relative risks (aRR) to identify demographic and clinical factors
associated with hospitalization, admission to ICU and death using Poisson regressions.
Results

Increasing age after 60 years was the greatest determinant for all outcomes. Assuming 0-50
years as reference, being aged 80-89 years was the strongest determinant of hospital
admission (aRR-5.7), 70-79 years for ICU(aRR-10.4) and >90 years for death(aRR-226.8) with
an aRR of 112.7 in those 70-79 . Among comorbidities, Immunodeficiency, cardiac disease,

kidney disease, and neurologic disease were independent risk factors for hospitalization (aRR
1.83, 1.79, 1.56, 1.82), for ICU these were cardiac, Immunodeficiency, kidney and lung disease
(aRR 4.33, 2.76, 2.43, 2.04), and for death they were kidney, cardiac and chronic neurological
disease (aRR: 2.9, 2.6, 2.0) Male gender was a risk factor for all outcomes. There were small
statistically significant differences for the 3 outcomes between regions.
Discussion and Conclusions

Older age stands out as the strongest risk factor for all outcomes specially for death as
absolute is risk was small for those younger than 50. These findings have implications in terms
of risk stratified public health measures that should prioritize protecting older people although
preventive behavior is needed in all ages. Epidemiologic scenarios and clinical guidelines may
consider these estimated risks, even though under-ascertainment of mild and asymptomatic
cases should be considered.

Introduction

Previous studies of clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in China1, Italy2 3 and the United States of
America 4 have described a number of factors associated with poorer clinical outcomes,
including age, sex and comorbidities not adjust for confounding . Identifying these
determinants and their specific risk can help inform policy on risk stratification,
implementation of public health measures and improve epidemiological scenarios on the
needed healthcare resources.
Based on initial data, the mean case fatality rate for adults aged under 60 is estimated to be
less than 0.2%, compared with 9.3% in those aged over 80. Even if comorbidities significantly
increased mortality risk significantly, risk would remain lower for younger people than for
most older adults.5
Other studies on risk factors for clinical outcomes of COVID-19 included small series of
patients, mostly among those hospitalized or excluding mild disease, 6 7 8 making it difficult to
produce reliable estimates for specific risk factors in the general population.
There is still uncertainty about the contribution of each factor for hospitalization, ICU
admission and death in the general population as only a few studies conducted multivariable
analysis to account for confounding 9 10 11 One study of laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 cases in
New York City found increased risks of hospitalization for those aged ≥75 years and aged 65-74
when compared to those 19 to 44 (OR 66.8, 95% CI, 44.7-102.6 and OR 10.9, 95% CI, 8.3514.34, respectively), BMI>40 (OR 6.2, 95% CI, 4.2-9.3), and heart failure (OR 4.3 95% CI, 1.911.2) 9 A large UK cross-sectional survey describing 16,749 patients already hospitalized with
COVID-19 showed higher risk of death for patients with increased age , cardiac, pulmonary and
kidney disease, as well as malignancy, dementia and obesity 10. The largest cohort study to
date was conducted in the UK, the OpenSAFELY Collaborative study11, including 17 million
adult NHS patients. Using a multivariable analysis, it was found that being in older age groups,
being male, older and living in a more socio-economically deprived community; having
uncontrolled diabetes, severe asthma and various other prior medical conditions were the
most relevant risk factors for death by COVID-19. As in other studies hypertension was not a
risk factor after adjustment 12 13.
High quality data on possible risk factors for poor outcomes of COVID-19 is needed to
inform public health policy and preparedness. Portugal may be well placed to provide such
data and risk estimates as high cases ascertainment for mild cases may improve risk
measures for outcomes in the general population. It is a country with a relatively high case
ascertainment estimates, (from 22% (18% - 39%)14 to 36.6% (29.5% - 45.7%)15 ) and had one
of higher testing rates in mid-May16 despite having lower transmission levels than many
countries17. Adding to this since there is a National Surveillance System18 implemented
since 2015, we believe this study may contribute to further understanding population level
COVID-19 risk factors for three different outcomes: Hospitalization, ICU admission and
death.
We aim to identify risk factors for more severe COVID-19 clinical outcomes in Portugal order
to better support risk stratification, clinical and public health interventions and to plan
health care resources.

Methods
Study design

A retrospective cohort study including all reported cases of COVID-19 in Portugal was
conducted. Outcomes were: Hospitalization, ICU admission and death. We calculated
absolute risk, relative risk and adjusted relative risk for age, gender, comorbidities and
region of residence using a Poisson Regression.
Data sources

We obtained anonymized data from the Directorate-General of Health (DGS), including all
confirmed cases of COVID-19 notified to the National Epidemiological Surveillance System
(SINAVE) extracted in April 28 2020. SINAVEmed is an electronic platform in which clinicians
are obliged by law to notify all suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19, and includes
questions about clinical findings and preexisting conditions. Notifications trigger an
epidemiological investigation by the Local Public Health Services, where a Public Health
Physician ( health authority in the area of residence of the case) validates the case. At a later
stage the Regional Public Health Department and finally DGS conducts a final validation of case
information. Outcome data are completed primarily at the local level, but can updated at the
Regional and National level(DGS).
Case definitions

A confirmed case of Covid-19 is defined as anyone with positive result for SARS-CoV-2 RNA
(by RT-PCR) in nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal specimens.
To March 26, all patients with fever or cough and contact with a symptomatic case or
returning from an active transmission zone (outside Portugal) were considered suspect
cases and had indication to be tested. From March 26, all people with fever or cough
regardless of epidemic link were considered suspect and told by public health officials to
call the NHS Health line and were subsequently sent for testing.
Outcomes

We evaluated three primary outcomes: hospitalization in general ward(not in ICU),
admission to intensive care Unit (ICU) and death. Outcomes were considered according to
data from SINAVE filled as described above according to patients situation and clinical
evolution.
Risk Factors

From SINAVEmed dataset we included the following variables: age, sex, chronic diseases/
comorbidities (Asthma, Cancer, Cardiac Disease, Diabetes, Immunodeficiencies(including
HIV) , Kidney Disease, Liver Disease, Lung Disease(other than Asthma), Hematologic Disease
,Chronic Neurologic Disease(including dementia) and region of occurrence of the case .
Regions were included for adjustment. Norte , Centro Lisboa e Vale do Tejo (LVT), Algarve,
Alentejo, Açores, Madeira.

Statistical analysis

Descriptive statistics were applied to characterize the cohort of confirmed COVID-19 cases
and the distribution by outcomes. We conducted univariable analysis and calculated
absolute risks (proportion were each outcome was observed by stratum), relative risk (RR)
with95% confidence intervals (CI) and p-value (Wald).We then calculated fully adjusted
relative risk (aRR) through multivariate analysis, using Poisson regression models that
included the same co-variables for each outcome.
Age was categorized in 6 categories with reference from 0-50 and then 10 years age groups
until >90
Finally we built forest plots with aRR for the Poisson Regression and CI for the 3 clinical
outcomes analyzed.
To make explicit the assumptions behind variables included in the models we drew a
Directed Acyclic Graph on the relations between variables and potentially biasing
pathways.(Figure 1.)
The regression models were analyzed in STATA 14, All analyses used 95% CI and < 0.05 as
statistically significant.
Ethical Considerations

Data was shared by DGS with the National School of Public Health under a partnership for
COVID-19 research. Ethical Committee of the National School of Public Health approved the
project (Approval: CE/ENSP/CREE/2/2020).

Results

Among 20,293 laboratory confirmed cases of COVID-19 , 2972 (14.6%) were admitted to
hospital(general ward), 261 (1.3%) were admitted to an ICU and 502 (2.5%) died. Among
cases 42% were male, 52% of cases were above 50 years and 17% had at least one comorbidity
recorded. Northern Region had 60% of cases.
Risk Factors for Hospitalization

In the univariable analysis Absolute risk of Hospitalization increases with age and it is the
strongest risk factor. Age groups above 60 presents aRR of hospitalization higher than any
chronic disease alone after adjustment assuming 0-50 reference. For Age 70-79 aRR was 5.737
(CI95%:5.133-6.412)
Different regions had different hospitalization risks and statistically significant differences in RR
that are maintained after full adjustment. Preexisting conditions with higher adjusted RR were
Immunodeficiencies (aRR:1.831 CI95%:1.434-2.346) , Cardiac Disease (aRR:1.79 CI95%:1.4892.152), Kidney Disease (aRR:1.557 CI95%:1.415-1.713), Liver Disease (aRR:1.543 CI95%:1.2471.91) and Neurologic Disease aRR(1.82 CI95%1.69-1.959). (Table 1)

Risk Factors for ICU admission

There was a consistent increase in risk of admission to ICU with increasing age until 70-79
(aRR:10.376 CI95%:6.47-16.641), reducing in the subsequent age groups. These findings are
maintained after adjustment. As for hospitalization, different regions have different ICU risks
and statistically significant differences in RR that are maintained after adjustment. Among
regions with cases in ICU the North Region has a lower risk compared with any other region.
The diseases with higher adjusted RR for admission to ICU were Cardiac Disease (aRR:4.33
CI95%:2.53-7.41), Immunodeficiencies (aRR:2.767 CI95%:1.348-5.683) , Kidney Disease
(aRR:2.439 CI95%:1.61-3.697) , and Lung Disease (aRR:2.035 CI95%:1.421-2.915) . Liver disease
and neurological disease were not associated with ICU admission although they were for
hospitalization. Age groups >60 (aRR:8.805 CI95%:5.594-13.861) had higher aRR than any
chronic disease alone. The adjusted risk of admission to ICU in cases aged 70-79 was more
than 10 times the risk of cases aged 0-50.
Regions maintain statistically significant differences after adjustment.

Risk Factors for Death

Risk of death is disproportionally affected by age. We observed that there is a constant
increase of risk of death with age, unlike what was seen with hospitalization and ICU
admissions. Among cases aged 0-50 the case fatality rate (CFR) was 0.04%, contrasting with a
CFR of 12.85% among those older than 90 years. The aRR increased more significantly from 7079(aRR:112.707 CI95%:41.177-308.495). Ddifferent regions had slightly different CFRs and
statistically significant differences of the aRR for 3 regions . The comorbidities with higher aRR
were Kidney(aRR:2.932 CI95%:2.329-3.691), Cardiac(aRR:2.576 CI95%:1.708-3.884), and
Neurological disease (aRR:2.041 CI95%:1.66-2.51).

In summary, men had significantly higher crude and adjusted RR higher than women for all
outcomes. Age is the strongest risk factor after adjustment for all outcomes, especially for the
outcome death. Risk of ICU and Hospital ward admission increased with age, but was reduced
in most advanced ages groups. Comorbidities all have similar risk for hospitalization but risk
increases for some of them and decreases for other for ICU and death as outcomes. Regions
maintain small but significant differences for all outcomes after adjustment but with weaker
associations for death.

Discussion
This study was a first attempt at identifying demographic and clinical factors associated with
adverse outcomes of COVID-19 in the Portuguese population: hospitalization, admission to ICU
and death. It has the benefits of presenting Relative Risks adjusted for confounding, and uses
good quality data from all cases in the country and not only cases in specific clinical settings
such as hospitals.

We used information extracted from the National Epidemiological Surveillance System
(SINAVE) electronic platform, which is thoroughly validated by the Public Health authorities
network in Portugal. This ensures a good level of data accuracy, data completeness and

representativeness, allowing generalization of findings to the general population . Still we most
consider surveillance system sensitivity could be lower before March 26 as the testing strategy
was less broad. Some regional differences in testing strategies probably remained even though
we accounted for this possible confounding.
In this study we found that increasing age is, as in other multivariable analysis, 9 11 the most
relevant risk factor for Hospitalization, ICU admission and death11 and is disproportionately
high for the outcomes death comparing to comorbidities alone with a fast increase after 70.
The very high values of aRR for older ages in comparison with other risk factors can be
justified by the very low fatality observed in the reference age group 0-50.
Hospitalization and ICU admissions had a relevant increase in risk in 60-69 and 70-79 . The risk
of ICU admission reduces after 70-79. This is not expected to be due to any negative selection
based on age since ICU beds occupation did not go over 60%19 during that period and there are
guidelines with criteria for ICU admission issued by DGS20 that consider only clinical severity
and no age criteria. Other studies found similar situations for influenza 21 22. It is possible that
some older patients may die without meeting criteria for ICU admission or eventually, many
who end up meeting those criteria may die before they can be admitted. However further
research is needed to understand the benefit of intensive care among the very elderly .Debate
has been ongoing on this topic considering the challenges and ethics of admitting the very
elderly to ICU, patient and family wishes and therapeutic futility 23 24 25 26 27.
Older age was by far the most important determinant for Covid-19 associated death.
Most comorbidities we investigated were associated with increased risk for hospitalization,
admission to ICU and death - especially cardiovascular, kidney, respiratory and neurologic
disease - but they vary for different outcomes. All comorbidities increased risk more
homogenously for hospitalization than for ICU and Death. . This could be explained by lower
thresholds for the decision to admit patients to a general ward vs ICU and by Portuguese
guidelines that consider the existence of comorbidities for hospital admission but included
mainly clinical severity criteria for ICU20 . Risks factors for death vary from other outcomes
partially because death does not include a clinical management decision. For ICU admission,
most relevant risk factors besides age were Cardiac disease, Immunodeficiencies , Kidney
Disease, and Lung disease .Liver, Neurologic and Hematologic Disease were not significantly
associated).
Asthma was not a risk factor for any outcome, in line with what was found in other studies9 10.
However he largest cohort investigated to date found a slight increase in adjusted risk of death
for asthma, especially if severe 11.
We found particularly strong associations of older age, cardiac disease and chronic kidney
disease at risk of both ICU admission and death, curiously with slightly less influence from
chronic lung disease as in a similar study 9 even though the largest cohort study for outcome
death found that lung disease had the highest risk among comorbidities 11.
For the outcome death we found similar results to the ISARIC study10 and to the OpenSafely
Project Cohort11 although the differences in risk measures for age are more expressive.
The comorbidities with higher risk vary for different outcomes. Immunodeficiencies, Cardiac,
Kidney, and Lung Disease gain importance for the outcome ICU comparing to their risks for

hospitalization. For death the strongest risk factors were Kidney, Cardiac and Chronic
Neurological Disease.
Regions were included in the models primarily to minimize unobserved confounding and we
found small differences in Region´s association with outcomes after adjustment for age and
comorbidities. Since some heterogeneity naturally exist between Regions epidemic situations,
testing strategies and case-ascertainment , we hypothesized that there could be unobserved
confounding mediated through regions9. Some small regional differences remain after
adjusting for other covariables, and are more relevant for the outcomes Hospitalization and
ICU even if they exist for death. This finding may be due non observed confounding factors. It
is probably primarily related to different regional detection rates among mild and
asymptomatic infection in different epidemic stages. Significant differences in healthcare
services response are not expected as Portugal has a good hospital network, no region
surpassed hospital capacity and guidelines with criteria for admission to general ward and
Intensive Care have been issued by the Directorate-General of Health 20. In the outcome data,
it is possible that differential delay in registry of outcomes in SINAVEmed database from
different regions may also have contributed to small regional differences eventually more
importantly for death, because of the larger delay from initial notification to outcome,
although we believe that eventual bias would be small.
Interestingly, ICU criteria are based on clinical severity indicators while for admission in a
general ward the existence of comorbidities alone is a criteria for admission ( namely StageV
Kidney Disease, Immunodeficiencies, active malignancy, and decompensated Chronic Lung
Disease, Asthma, Heart Failure, Diabetes e Cirrhosis(Liver Disease). This may partly explain why
some of this comorbidities are risk factors for hospital admission in general ward but not for
ICU or death .
Number of tests in asymptomatic patients in specific settings such as nursing homes and
healthcare workers may have varied across regions. Since under-ascertainment can have an
important impact on the proportion of outcomes by strata, and considering regional and age
specific differences in case ascertainment, healthcare services practices and availability in
different epidemic phases, we believe the adjustment for Regions may be relevant for this type
of analysis but differences in regional risk should be interpreted with caution, specially with
small number of cases and small risk differences .
The study has some limitations. The extracted data is related to an early phase of the epidemic
in Portugal and as such, risks associated may still change with increased testing and detection
of mild and asymptomatic infection, changes in Regional epidemic behaviour and further data
validation. There are relevant comorbidities that we could not adjust for that have been
previously found to be of relevance for the COVID-19 severity outcomes, such as obesity9 10 11,
economic deprivation11 and black and minority ethnic groups11 28 . Hypertension is also not
included since it was not available in SINAVEmed dataset, although recent evidence form the
largest cohort to date suggest that controlled Hypertension (HT) alone does not increase the
risk of death of COVID-19 patients11. A study that found increased risk for Hypertension did not
adjust for age, which we know is strongly associated with risk of death and severe disease29. In
our study no data on smoking was available but, as with hypertension, it does not seem to be a
relevant factor for poorer outcomes in the OpenSafely Project Cohort, where some evidence
of increased risks in former smokers was found but no effect for actual smokers .11

Cardiovascular disease small numbers are probably related to the fact that, contrary to other
Comorbidities , Cardiac Disease is not in a specific field in the SINAVEmed notification form. As
such physicians would need to describe that condition on the field “others chronic conditions”.
This may introduce information bias as the field “other chronic conditions” may be more
frequently completed for cases with poorer outcomes, overestimating the risk factor Cardiac
Disease. However, other studies conducting multivariable analysis from cases have found
Cardiac Disease to be one of the most relevant risk factors.9 10 11
Cases were not censored considering time of follow-up and final outcomes. As such it is
possible that some cases in the dataset could still developed one of the analysed outcome.
We believe this would not introduce a systematic error in risk estimates for age and
comorbidities.
We used adjusted relative risks in multivariate analysis using Poisson regressions assuming
constant time of exposure. The use of an adjusted odds ratio to estimate an adjusted relative
risk can be appropriate for studies of rare outcomes(<10%) but may overestimate the risk if
outcomes are more frequent and can be more valid then the odds ratio to represent a risk
ratio especially if we want to estimate the effect of specific exposures and could overestimate
the risk.30 31 32. Overestimating RR could inappropriately affect clinical decision-making ,policy
development, and errors in economic evaluation of potential intervention and prevention
programs or treatments.30 31 Poisson regression is likely to compute confidence intervals that
are conservative with more common outcomes, suggesting less precision than is true.
Age was categorized in 10 years after 0-49 age groups for all the outcomes. Other studies
conducting multivariable analysis have used such age categorization to identify risk factors
for COVID-19 clinical outcomes 10including the largest cohort studied for risk factors for
death from COVID-1911. Age 0-50 was used as reference category as in previous studies very
low risk was found in this group for severe outcomes. 9 10 11
Our findings may help shaping stratified public health policy, modelling risk criteria for clinical
management and aid in definition of epidemic scenarios for the assessment of health needs in
the face of different possible evolutions of the epidemic.
Clinical risk assessment tools may be built to aid clinical decisions related to admission to
hospital or to ICU, since most patients can be safely followed up at home by healthcare
professionals, by phone. Most EU countries took this approach.33
Policy and recommendations in Portugal and other countries consider specific comorbidities
and age cut-offs to consider people at risk. As such it is relevant to understand what is the level
of risk added by each specific characteristic, accounting for differences in case detection in
different age groups and healthcare services heterogeneity to shape policy and define risk
categories for health-care practitioners, organisations, and the general public.
In Portugal patients with Hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory
diseases, oncological diseases and patients with renal failure, may have medically justified
absences from work if they cannot work from home34. We could show that if these patients
become ill with COVID-19 they will be at increased risk of having a poor outcome except for
hypertension, but would probably not be found to be a risk factor after adjustment considering
recent evidence11 13. However no age categories are referred in this legal document, (even
tough age risks are referred in other guidance and recommendations) and higher age groups
pose a higher risk than comorbidities for all outcomes starting from 60 but specially after 70
for all considered outcomes but higher for death.

In terms of risk estimates for absolute risks of specific outcomes among infected, including for
individual risk estimates using generated model parameters but also for model inputs to
estimate healthcare demand scenarios we should consider under-ascertainment of mildly
symptomatic and asymptomatic cases.35 Furthermore, under-ascertainment is probably higher
in younger ages and rises with age as they may have a lower threshold for testing and have a
smaller proportion of mild and asymptomatic infections. This could mean modelled absolute
risk estimates are overestimated in all age groups but specially in the younger population.
It will be relevant to revaluate the same data later in time to see if the findings are maintained
and what changes may happen.
Conclusions

Advancing age was the most relevant risk factor for all outcomes and grows faster after 60 for
the outcome death, as risk is low in those aged 0-50.Control strategies should be based on an
attempt to reduce the number of serious cases and deaths. For this, it will be important to
reinforce measures that prevent infection in people over 60 but mostly over 70 years of age. A
recent study suggest that lockdown policies targeted at sheltering and testing the elderly have
huge gains in lives saved and hospitalizations at low economic cost and large returns to broad
testing policy.36 Good epidemiological surveillance of settings with higher risk population, and
long-term care facilities is part of an efficient way to achieve this goal and has been promoted
in recent months.
Comorbidities also have an impact on clinical outcomes (especially Cardiac, Kidney, Lung
disease,Immunodeficiencies and Neurologic Disease) but they are smaller than age and vary
for different outcomes .
Risk stratified public health measures should consider age primarily although individual
preventive behaviours should be promoted across all age groups to reduce overall spread and
ultimately prevent infection in higher risk population.
