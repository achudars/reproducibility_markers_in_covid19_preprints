Abstract
Background
Vietnam has emerged as one of the world’s leading success stories in responding to COVID-19.
After prolonged zero-low transmission, a summer outbreak of unknown source at Da Nang caused
the country’s first COVID-19 deaths, but was quickly suppressed. Vietnam recently reopened its
borders to international travelers. Understanding the attendant risks and how to minimize them is
crucial as Vietnam moves into this new phase.
Methods
We create an agent-based model of COVID-19 in Vietnam, using regional testing data and a
detailed linelist of the 1,014 COVID-19 cases, including 35 deaths, identified across Vietnam. We
investigate the Da Nang outbreak, and quantify the risk of another outbreak under different
assumptions about behavioral/policy responses and ongoing testing.
Results
The Da Nang outbreak, although rapidly contained once detected, nevertheless caused significant
community transmission before it was detected; higher symptomatic testing could have mitigated
this. If testing levels do not increase, the adoption of past policies in response to newly-detected
cases may reduce the size of potential outbreaks but will not prevent them. Compared to a baseline
symptomatic testing rate of 10%, we estimate half as many infections under a 20% testing rate,
and a quarter as many with 40-50% testing rates, over the four months following border
reopenings.
Conclusions
Vietnam’s success in controlling COVID-19 is largely attributable to its rapid response to detected
outbreaks, but the speed of response could be improved even further with higher levels of
symptomatic testing.

Introduction
With its first confirmed case on January 23, 2020, Vietnam was among the first ten countries
affected by the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic.1 Two weeks later, only 150 cases had been
reported outside of mainland China, but 10 (7%) of these were in Vietnam, placing it in the top
ten most affected countries.2 However, one year later the situation was very different: with just
1300 cumulative cases and 0.4 deaths per million inhabitants, Vietnam ranked among the five
countries with the lowest COVID-19 disease burden, and among the three countries with lowest
overall mortality.3 Understanding how transmission has been kept so low and whether it can be
maintained as such is crucial, especially as Vietnam reopens its borders to international arrivals.
Vietnam has been widely praised for this notable success in suppressing the spread of COVID19.4,5 The initial response to COVID-19 was characterized by a series of measures to prevent
onward transmission following importation (Figure 1). The government closed its border with
China and suspended air travel from China on January 28, 2020. The travel restriction policy
extended to other COVID-19 affected countries in mid-February, and all international travel by
commercial airlines was suspended from March 25 onwards. Additional border control measures
included screening at border gates and quarantine of all travelers entering Vietnam. The country
closed all land border crossings and transportation lines with the three neighboring countries of
China, Laos, and Cambodia, canceled train services with China, and denied permission to dock
cruise ships. Schools and universities closed initially for the 1-week Tet holidays (the Vietnamese
Lunar New Year), and the closure was extended in response to the COVID-19 epidemic. In March,
the government issued a mask-wearing mandate, a ban on public gatherings (including
entertainment, cultural/sporting events and non-essential businesses), and a 2-meter physical
distancing recommendation.
Together with enhancement of communication to the public, surveillance, isolation and
quarantine, testing, and contacting tracing, Vietnam adopted targeted lockdowns early in the
pandemic. After several separate epidemics were detected in different locations over a short period
of time, the government imposed a national lockdown from April 1 to April 15 to curb
transmission of COVID-19 in the community. These measures helped Vietnam to stay free of
community transmission of COVID-19 for 99 days. On July 25, a cluster of domestic cases was
detected at a provincial hospital in Da Nang in Central Vietnam, a popular domestic tourism
destination. The Da Nang region was locked down on July 28, but the outbreak still spread rapidly
around the city, with cases also showing up in 14 other provinces across Vietnam through various
forms of transportation, including airplanes, trains and buses, during the peak tourist season in the
city. By late August the Da Nang outbreak had been suppressed, but not before causing over 500
known cases, more than Vietnam’s entire case count through July 24, as well as the country’s first
recorded COVID-19 deaths. In view of the Da Nang experience and the continued failure of many
countries to curb the pandemic, Vietnam has been reluctant to reopen its borders for international
travelers.

Mathematical modelling has formed a crucial element of the global response to the COVID-19
pandemic since its onset.6 Vietnam’s exemplary COVID-19 response, informed by its previous
experience with SARS, has meant that thus far it has not relied upon modelling as much as
countries suffering higher pandemic burden. However, Vietnam’s relatively unique COVID-19
situation means that the problem of reopening borders with zero local transmission and robust
pandemic response systems has not received much modelling attention. The available literature on
the risks associated with international travel has determined that border closures were an important
part of limiting the spread of the virus,7,8 but only a small number of other studies have examined
the risks associated with reopening borders,9,10 and only one has examined the impact of different
quarantine policies, finding that quarantine periods of 8 or 14 days followed by a negative test
result could reduce the number of infectious arrivals released into the community by a median
94% or 99% respectively compared to a no quarantine, no test scenario.11
To address Vietnam’s needs as it reopens its borders, we have set out to model adaptive behavioral
changes in response to new information about the state of the epidemic. On July 25, Vietnam had
recorded 99 days with no locally transmitted cases. A survey of ~95,000 people conducted the
following day indicated that the proportion of people who reported frequently and sometimes
using a face mask over the preceding 2 weeks were 35% and 29%.12 However, over the following
week in response to reports of the Da Nang outbreak, public behavior changed rapidly: by the
time the next survey was conducted on August 2, the proportions of people who reported
frequently and sometimes using a face mask over the preceding 2 weeks were 90% and 5%
respectively.13 Feedback mechanisms between the number of reported cases and people’s behavior
has rarely been incorporated directly into modelling frameworks, although some studies have
included dynamic interventions based on trigger thresholds.14–16 Including this feature for Vietnam
is essential in order to be able to capture the evolution of the Da Nang outbreak, and to make
reasonable estimates of the probability of future outbreaks in Vietnam and countries with similar
COVID-19 performance (e.g., Taiwan and New Zealand) following the reopening of borders.
In this paper, we use detailed data from the outbreak of COVID-19 in the province of Da Nang
in August of 2020 to calibrate a stochastic agent-based model of COVID-19 transmission for
Vietnam. We use this model in a framework for evaluating the risk of epidemic rebound in Vietnam
following the reopening of international borders.

Methods
Data inputs
Testing and patient data were gathered from the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology,
an organization that supports public health activities in Vietnam, and from the General
Department of Preventive Medicine (GDPM), a Ministry of Health affiliated department,
respectively. The daily and cumulative numbers of tests and diagnosed cases separated by
geographic regions of laboratories, including the North, Central, and South, were collected via a
national reporting system of COVID-19 testing. For each patient diagnosed, information was
recorded on age, gender, nationality, geographical origin, case classification (imported or domestic
cases), date of diagnosis, signs and symptoms they experienced, date of illness onset, date of
isolation, date of hospitalization, the number of patient’s close contacts getting infected with

SARS-CoV-2, any complications developed during hospital administration, and date of death if it
occurred. In total, we obtained a detailed line-list of 1,014 de-duplicated laboratory-confirmed
COVID-19 patients, including 35 deaths, identified across Vietnam from January 23 to August 22.
In addition, data on incoming arrivals to airports in Vietnam’s South over the period from May
31, 2020 to October 24, 2020, were collected from the GDPM and the Pasteur Institute of Ho Chi
Minh City, and analyzed for the purpose of quantifying the proportion of arrivals testing positive
to COVID-19.

Modelling the Da Nang outbreak
We use an open-source agent-based model called Covasim,17 documented in detail elsewhere,18 to
create an agent-based model for Central Vietnam. We began by simulating a population
representative of Central Vietnam by taking data on the age and sex composition of the population
and using it to create a model population of agents with similar characteristics. Next, we used
Covasim’s inbuilt methods to construct four distinct contact networks that assign these agents to
households, schools, workplaces, and communities based on their ages.
Following the release of the initial lockdowns in April, Da Nang (a popular summer holiday
destination) launched a campaign to attract domestic tourists, which led to a sharp increase in
domestic tourist arrivals: ~250,000 in May, 450,000 in June, ~1.4 million in July = approx.
33,000/day over June 15 – July 25, 2020. Despite Vietnam’s aggressive response to the early waves
of COVID-19, tests of 895 blood donors in Ho Chi Minh City in August showed low but nonzero prevalence of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (2/895 ~ 0.2%). We therefore
initialized the model on June 15, 2020, and over the following 40 days until July 25, an average of
1 new infected person per day (or 0.003% of incoming tourists; drawn from a negative binomial
distribution with dispersion of 0.25) was introduced into the population. This low, steady stream
of new cases reflects the influx of domestic tourists to Da Nang over this period, approximating
the sudden concentration of a number of infected people into a single municipality.
To simulate the policy environment, we include parameter changes that capture Vietnam’s testing,
tracing, isolation, quarantine, and lockdown strategies (summarized in Table S1). Over the period
from June 15, 2020 to October 15, 2020, the model was calibrated to data from Central Vietnam
on the number of tests, diagnosed cases, and deaths (as described in the section above). Calibration
was performed by drawing 20 samples from a distribution of values for the per-contact
transmission risk, running N=500 simulations for each to produce 10,000 trial simulations, and
then retaining the 1% of these with the minimum absolute differences between the model
projections and the data. Core parameter values and sources are documented in Table S1.
An important factor in modelling the Da Nang outbreak is the speed with which both official
policy and the community reacted to the detection of new cases. Schools and workplaces in Da
Nang were closed from 28 July (3 days after new cases were detected) until the 14th and 5th of
September respectively, and a stay-at-home recommendation was issued (Table S1). In addition to
survey data indicating that the proportion of people who reported frequently wearing a mask
increased from 35% to 90% following the reported increase in locally transmitted cases, there was

likely also an increase in vigilance with hygiene and distancing protocols. A case-control study on
the use of masks and other personal protective measures in Thailand found that those who wore
masks all the time were more likely to report that (a) their closest contacts were more than 1 meter
away, (b) contact durations were limited to ≤15 minutes, and (c) they washed their hands often.19
Taking all these factors into account, the study found a negative association between the individuallevel risk of COVID-19 transmission and wearing a mask all the time (adjusted odds ratio (aOR)
0.23, 95% CI 0.09–0.60), while wearing masks sometimes was not significantly associated with
lower risk of infection (aOR 0.87, 95% CI 0.41–1.84). Using these estimates, we obtain a prior
estimate for the overall individual-level impact of the reported increase in mask usage,
corresponding to a reduction in the per-contact probability of transmission of 58% (26-73%)
(details provided in Table S1). In the model, we assume that this applies to contacts that take place
in the community, workplace, and school networks, but not in households as people are less likely
to wear masks at home.

Modelling the reopening of international borders
Firstly, to estimate the risk of an imported infection entering Vietnam and escaping quarantine, we
analyze data on incoming arrivals to airports in Vietnam’s South and calculate the distribution of
onward transmissions per infected arrival. These calculations take account of the quarantine
protocols in place in Vietnam as of 20 November, 2020, which require all incoming international
arrivals to Vietnam to: (a) test negative 3-5 days before departing; (b) disclose travel 14 days before
departing; (c) complete a nasopharyngeal swab sample antigen test on arrival; (d) quarantine in a
hotel for 7 days, after which they are tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR or RT-LAMP; (e)
quarantine at their residence for a further 7 days if both test results are negative; (f) continue to
have their health monitored daily by a commune health worker over the remainder of their
quarantine, with another nasopharyngeal swab sample collected at day 14 after arrival.20 This
combined 14-day quarantine period is based on the distribution of the incubation period for
COVID-19,21–23 and is consistent with current WHO recommendations.24 Vietnamese citizens who
repatriated from foreign countries are quarantined for 14 days at government facilities and tested
twice during the 14-day quarantine as the previous testing schedule.
Secondly, to model the risk of escaped cases causing an outbreak in Vietnam, we create a national
model using the parameter values obtained via the calibration process for the Da Nang outbreak.
Beginning from a point with no active cases in the community (which we take to be November
30, 2020, but which could theoretically be any point), we initialize 100 simulations and project
forward by 4 months. On each day, the number of new imported cases on each day is drawn from
a negative binomial distribution, with parameters based on the observed distribution of imported
cases over the period from February 1–August 22, 2020, but scaled such that the mean number of
imported cases is 10 times higher over the projection period when borders are open than when
they were closed; the scale factor is based on the planned reopening schedule of Vietnam’s borders.
For all future projections, we assume that schools and workplaces would be closed if more than 5
cases are detected. We also assume that all identified contacts of confirmed cases are tested
regardless of symptoms; for those with COVID-19-like symptoms but no known history of
contact with a case, we assume 10% will seek a test during periods of low transmission (based on

an analysis of the testing data over February 1–August 22, 2020), but once more than 5 cases are
detected, aggressive testing campaigns increase this to 90%.
The question of how policy and behavior will respond to increases in reported cases is highly
relevant for analyzing the future trajectory of the epidemic in Vietnam. We therefore model three
alternative scenarios:
1. Constant high compliance: for this scenario, we assume that the population will remain
highly compliant with measures to stop transmission. We model this by assuming the
reduction in transmission risk in response to the detection of new locally-transmitted cases
in late July represented a permanent shift in behavior.
2. Increased complacency: for this scenario, we include another behavior change in the
model, whereby the relative per-contact probability of transmission increases back to its
pre-outbreak value after the 14-day average of new locally-transmitted cases falls below 2.
Following the detection of new cases, the probability of someone with symptoms getting
tested is assumed to increase as testing capacity is scaled up would result in policy actions
comparable to those that have been implemented in the past (i.e., localized school and
workplace closures following the detection of more than 5 locally-transmitted cases), but
we assume that mask/NPI compliance would not increase again.
3. Self-regulating behavior: for this scenario, we allow the relative per-contact probability of
transmission to be fully dynamic. We allow it to increase back to its pre-outbreak value
whenever the 14-day average of new locally-transmitted cases falls below 2 (as in the
“increased apathy” scenario above), but to decrease again if the daily number of new
locally-transmitted cases increases above a certain threshold. This scenario is intended to
capture behavior change in response to the information conveyed by case counts.

Results
Characteristics of the Da Nang outbreak
Figure 2 shows the model’s estimates of the characteristics of the outbreak in Central Vietnam, as
well as comparisons to observed data where possible. According to our estimates, the outbreak in
Central Vietnam had very likely begun well before the first cases were detected, with an estimated
1,480 (95% projected interval: 1,170-1,870) infections occurring between June 15 and July 25,
2020. Testing levels over this period were relatively low, averaging around 350 tests/day, but scaled
up rapidly after cases were detected on July 25 to peak at around 17,000 tests/day by August 13,
2020. We estimate that the outbreak itself peaked with approximately 1,060 (95% projected
interval: 890-1280) active infections on August 2, 2020.
Over the entire outbreak, we estimate that around 3,020 (95% projected interval: 2,600-3,460)
people were infected, of which only ~20% were diagnosed. This relatively low case detection rate
can largely be explained by the lower testing rates prior to July 25, 2020. Thereafter, we estimate
that the majority of undiagnosed infections can be accounted for by asymptomatic transmission
chains: almost half (47%, 95% projected interval: 42-51%) of undiagnosed infections that occurred
after July 25 were asymptomatic, and of these, 72% (59-82%) acquired COVID-19 from another
asymptomatic person, thus making tracing difficult. We estimate an overall infection-fatality rate
of 1.2% (1.0-1.3%) over the course of the outbreak, compared to a case-fatality rate of 6.3%.

Figure 2. Fitting a microsimulation model to data on COVID-19 cases and deaths in Central
Vietnam. Solid lines indicate the median model projections over 100 simulations; shaded areas
indicate 95% projected intervals; diamonds indicate data. Until August 22, the daily diagnoses data
includes local transmissions only, but after this point diagnoses could not be disaggregated, so data
points on diagnoses after this date should be interpreted as overestimates of local transmission.

The risk of a case entering Vietnam and escaping quarantine
Available data indicate that the risk of a case entering the country is low but non-zero.
Approximately 0.6% (337/55,079) of all international arrivals to airports in Vietnam tested positive
to COVID-19 over April to November 2020. But data on infected passengers entering Vietnam
over the period from February 1 to August 22, 2020 indicate that these measures are not failsafe.
Even though 96% of infected arrivals had no known onward transmissions (Table 1), this
nevertheless implies a 4% risk of an infection being released into the community despite a 14-day
quarantine period, with this risk encompassing the ~1% probability that an infected person
develops symptoms only after a 14-day period,21–23 in addition to the probability of a failure in
quarantine procedures.

The risk of an escaped case developing into an outbreak
If the population of Vietnam remains highly compliant with mask-wearing and other nonpharmaceutical interventions, our projections indicate that the epidemic would remain under
control even if a small but steady flow of imported infections escaped quarantine into the
community (Figure 3). If, on the other hand, mask usage declines as apathy increases, there is a
chance that the epidemic could rebound again, with the worst-case scenarios projecting a peak of
2,500 active cases within 2 months of borders reopening (Figure 3, middle column). The worst of
these outcomes could be partly mitigated if policy and/or behavior responds dynamically to news
that the daily number of locally-acquired cases has exceeded a threshold, which we here assume to
be 5, but in either case, the delay between when infections begin to increase and when the first
cases are detected mean that significant amounts of transmission occur before policy can respond
(Figure 3, final column).

Figure 3. Projections of active infections and daily diagnoses under different assumptions about
how people react to news of increasing case counts. In the left column, people are assumed to
remain perfectly compliant with masks and other NPIs even after prolonged periods of low
transmission. In the middle column, increasing apathy is assumed to lead to permanently decreased
compliance with mask wearing, although government policies still mandate the closure of schools
and workplaces upon the detection of new cases. In the right column, people’s compliance with
mask wearing and other behavioral interventions decreases and increases as a function of reported
cases.
The degree of control over future outbreaks depends to a large extent on the speed with which
cases were detected, which depends on ongoing testing for those with COVID-19-like symptoms.
In Figure 3, we assumed that during periods when no cases had been reported, demand for
symptomatic testing would be low, with a baseline of 10% of those with symptoms seeking testing.

In Figure 4, we vary the baseline symptomatic testing rate. Across all simulations, lower testing
rates would lead to a more prolonged period of increase in the epidemic before eventually reversing
(Figure 4A). The difference is particularly notable as the testing rate increases from 10% to 20%,
which leads to a halving of the median cumulative number of infections over the following four
months from 2,110 (95% interval: 1,050-3,630) to 1,100 (570-1,670) (Figure 4B).

Discussion
The efficacy of Vietnam’s COVID-19 response – already well-documented in the literature4,5 –
was demonstrated once again in the wake of the July-August outbreak in the province of Da
Nang.25 With schools and workplaces shut down in affected areas within 3 days of cases being
detected, the immediate adoption of masks, widespread testing and quarantine of potentially
exposed persons, and rapid contact tracing, Vietnam was able to flatten the curve within a week
of cases being detected. As remarkable as this is, however, our results suggest that there would be
scope for even further improvements if those with COVID-19-like symptoms could be
encouraged to seek testing even if they haven’t had a history of contact with a known case. We
estimate that by the time the first cases of the Da Nang outbreak were detected, there had already
been 1,480 (1,170-1,870) infections in the province. This was likely a result of a rapid influx of
domestic tourists and extremely low testing rates in Da Nang. Since no quarantine or testing
protocols applied to domestic travelers, these cases went undetected.
Lessons can be drawn from the experience in Da Nang as Vietnam considers reopening its borders
to international travelers. Although reopening the borders will still require incoming arrivals to
follow rigorous testing and quarantine protocols, our examination of incoming arrivals to Vietnam
over a five month period indicated that 13/330 (4%) infected arrivals transmitted to one or more

people despite these protocols. Consequently, permitting more international travelers is not a riskfree decision. Assuming that Vietnam continues to pursue a policy of COVID-19 elimination, our
results indicate that any outbreaks that may result from reopening borders have a high likelihood
of being contained, assuming that features of earlier responses would be repeated. However, if
testing rates are low, then there would still be the potential for significant amounts of community
transmission prior to the detection – and consequent containment – of new cases. We estimate
that if testing rates remain at levels similar to those observed prior to the Da Nang outbreak, there
could be 1,000-4,000 cumulative infections over the four months following the reopening of
borders, but that a doubling of the testing rate from 10% to 20% would halve this total.
Our results on the importance of ongoing symptomatic testing even in zero- or low-transmission
settings are supported by other studies in the literature. Two studies by our group examined the
role of testing in very low-transmission and zero-transmission settings, respectively. The first of
these found that ongoing low transmission could be largely controlled by test-and-trace strategies,
but that the total number of infections over three months would be more than 100 times higher
with a 50% testing rate compared to a 90% testing rate.26 The second estimated the probability of
a single introduced case resulting in >5 cases/day within 60 days, finding a probability of ~50%
with no restrictions in place and a symptomatic testing rate of 25%, compared to 45% with a
symptomatic testing rate of 50%, or 35% with a symptomatic testing rate of 75%.27 Elsewhere in
the literature, a study by Kucharski et al found that mass random testing of 5% of the
population/week combined with self-isolation, household quarantine, and manual contact tracing
of all contacts would lead to a mean transmission reduction of 64%.28 Another study by Hellewell
et al found that with 20 initial cases and 60% of contacts being traced, less than 50% of outbreaks
would be controlled, even assuming that all symptomatic cases are eventually detected.29
Our study has a number of limitations. Firstly, since we use an agent-based model, our results are
based on underlying assumptions about the ways in which these agents interact. We modelled
agent interactions over four networks (households, schools, workplaces, and community), but did
not explicitly model large gatherings that could potentially become super-spreader events. Such
events are known to have potential for sparking outbreaks.30,31 Our estimates of the potential scale
of an outbreak in Vietnam may therefore be conservative, especially given the proximity of the 1week Tet holidays (Vietnamese Lunar New Year) in early February, and the National Congress of
the Communist Party of Vietnam in late January 2021. Superspreading is also partly driven by
overdispersion of viral load among individuals, a factor which is included in the model (e.g. in
Seattle, we estimate that 50% of transmissions are caused by ~10% of infected people32).
Another limitation is that we assume that the population is homogeneous in terms of behavior
and quarantine compliance. In general, not including variability in model inputs means that it is
also not included in the model’s outputs. For example, when models assume that mask-wearing
reduces everyone’s transmission risk by a certain percentage, this population-level summary
actually incorporates a range of individual behavioral changes that may adjust individual-level
transmission risk by varying amounts. The possibility of pockets of variation – e.g., a single
individual who happens to have a high viral load, a high number of contacts, and does not wear a
mask – are significant factors in considering outbreak risk.

We further note that we do not model supply-side constraints on testing or contact tracing, but
with a rapidly-growing epidemic, there is a real possibility of capacity constraints taking effect,
especially for contact tracing programs, which may thus prevent tracing-based containment
beyond a certain point.
Our parameter estimates for factors such as the age-dependent probability of developing
symptoms or dying are based on published values that, although they represent the best
information available at the time of writing,33 are nonetheless derived from studies that are not
specific to Vietnam, and which are subject to revision as new information becomes available.
Vietnam’s success to date in pursuing a zero-COVID-19 policy is remarkable for several reasons.
Compared to other countries aiming for local elimination (such as South Korea, Australia, and
New Zealand), Vietnam not only has a much larger population and lower per-capita income, but
it has the additional challenge of monitoring land borders. To maintain this after reopening borders
to international travelers will require a continued commitment to fast and stringent policy reactions
to new cases, but equally importantly, sufficient levels of symptomatic testing even among people
with no known history of contact with a confirmed case. Rapid containment is only possible given
the availability of real-time data on the state of the epidemic. As countries like Vietnam consider
how to re-introduce international travel, the importance of routine testing as a surveillance measure
will be crucial.

Testing

Testing is modelled in two different ways. Firstly, in the
model of Central Vietnam over June 15 – October 15,
2020, we use available data on the number of tests that
were conducted. We assume that people with symptoms,
and people who have a known history of contact with a
confirmed case, are most likely to receive a test, but we
allow for the possibility of those without symptoms or a
contact history receiving a test. Secondly, to project the
epidemic into the future, we model testing by setting a
probability for testing for those with symptoms, and those
without symptoms but with a known history of contact. In
our core scenarios, over the course of their symptomatic
period, 10% of people with COVID-19-like symptoms are
assumed to seek testing (this is varied in subsequent
scenarios). Furthermore, in line with Vietnam’s policies,
100% of those who are identified as a contact of a
confirmed case are tested.

children

Schools were closed in Central Vietnam from July 28,
2020, to September 14, 2020. Over this period, we assume
that the number of contacts between school-aged children
was 90% lower than its pre-lockdown value.

Impact of workplace
closures: relative number of
daily contacts between working
adults

Workplaces were closed in Central Vietnam from July 28,
2020, to September 5, 2020. Over this period, we assume
that the number of contacts between working adults was
90% lower than its pre-lockdown value.

Mask uptake

30% pre-July 26;
90% post-July 26.
On July 26, the proportion of people who reported
sometimes-frequently using a face mask in the past 2 weeks
were 29%-35% (n=94771). These values increased to 35%90% (n=143277) in the survey conducted on August 2,
2020, after the identification of the new cluster of cases.
To translate this to an effect size in the model, we first
calculate the average relative transmission risk with 35%
mask usage, assuming an aOR of 0.23 for those wearing
masks, as: 65%+35%*23% = 73%. We then calculate the
average relative transmission risk with 90% mask usage,
again assuming an aOR of 0.23, as: 10%+90%*23% = 31%.
This leads to a median estimated reduction in transmission
risk of: 1-31%/73% = 58%. However, since there is
considerable uncertainty around the size of the reduction in
transmission risk associated with mask wearing, we
implement this by sampling the reduction in transmission
risk from a triangular distribution over the interval 26-73%,
where the endpoints of this interval are calculated by
substituting the endpoints of the confidence interval from2
into the calculations above. This gives an interval broadly in
line with other estimates of face mask efficacy once other
behavioral changes are incorporated3.

Tracing: probability of tracing Household contacts: 100% traceable on the same day as test
contacts and time taken to trace results are notified;
School contacts: 95% notified within 1 day;
Workplace contacts: 90% notified within 1 day;
Community contacts: 5% notified within a week of a case
notification
Isolation and quarantine:
reduction
in
transmission
probability for confirmed cases
and contacts compared to
undiagnosed cases

We assume that confirmed cases will isolate with nearperfect effectiveness, meaning that the probability of them
transmitting to school or workplace contacts is zero, and
the probability of them transmitting to their household
contacts is reduced by 80%. Similarly, we assume high
levels of adherence to isolation policies imposed on those
who have been notified that they were in contact with a
confirmed case, with a 90% reduction in their probability
of transmitting to school or workplace contacts.
