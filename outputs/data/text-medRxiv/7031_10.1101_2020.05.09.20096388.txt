Abstract
In the absence of medical treatment and vaccination, individual behaviours are key to
controlling the spread of COVID-19. We developed a rapid response monitoring system
through an online survey (the “COVID-19 Health Behavior Survey”). Participant recruitment takes places continuously via Facebook in eight countries (Belgium, France,
Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom, the United States). The
survey collects key information on people’s health, attitudes, behaviours, and social contacts. In this paper, we present results based on a total of 71,612 completed questionnaires,
collected between March 13-April 19, 2020. We find sex-specific patterns, as women show
higher threat perceptions, lower confidence in the healthcare system, and a higher likelihood of adopting preventive behaviours. Our findings also show higher awareness and
concern among older respondents. Finally, we find spatio-temporal heterogeneity in threat
perception, confidence in organisations, and adoption of preventive behaviours.

The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak started in Wuhan City, China,
in December 2019 and quickly spread globally, soon reaching pandemic proportions [1]. By
mid-April 2020, the virus had already caused over 1.6 million cases and over 100,000 deaths
worldwide [2], placing a substantial burden on national healthcare systems and posing unprecedented challenges for governments and societies. As yet, governmental responses to mitigate
the coronavirus epidemic have varied considerably across countries. Non-pharmaceutical interventions, specifically intended to reduce sustained local transmission by reducing contact rates
in the general population, have so far ranged from moderate containment measures, such as
school closures and cancellations of public gatherings, to drastic measures, such as travel bans
and nationwide lockdowns [3]. In Western democracies, individual behaviours, rather than
governmental actions, are potentially crucial to control the spread of COVID-19 [4]. Human
behaviour is in fact a key factor in shaping the course of epidemics [5]. Individuals may spontaneously modify their behaviours and adopt preventive measures in response to an epidemic
when mortality or the perception of risk is high, and this may in turn change the epidemic
itself by reducing the likelihood of transmission and infection [6, 7, 8].
However, a key problem is a lack of data to assess people’s behaviour and reactions to
epidemics. Decision-making and the evaluation of non-pharmaceutical interventions require
specific, reliable, and timely data not only about infections, but also about human behaviour.
Especially in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, where medical treatment and vaccination are
still only remote options, mitigation and containment mainly rely on massive and rapid adoption
of preventive measures [9]. Understanding how the members of different demographic groups
perceive the risk, and consequently adopt specific behaviours in response to it, is therefore key
to assess the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions, design more realistic epidemic
models, and enable public health agencies to develop optimal control policies to contain the
spread of COVID-19.
We seek to narrow this data gap by monitoring individual behaviours and attitudes in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic in multiple countries. In March 2020, we launched a
cross-national online survey, called the “COVID-19 Health Behavior Survey” (CHBS), to collect
timely data on people’s health status, behaviours, close social contacts, and attitudes related
to COVID-19. We recruit respondents through advertisement campaigns on Facebook, that we
created via the Facebook Ads Manager (FAM). This novel approach to recruiting respondents
allows us to combine the flexibility of online surveys for rapid data collection, with the controlled
environment of targeted advertisement. This makes it possible to recruit a balanced sample
across demographic groups, that is approximately representative of the general population, after
applying appropriate post-stratification weights [10, 11, 12]. Other similar online initiatives
have emerged recently [13, 14, 15, 16], but to the best of our knowledge, this is the first crossnational study addressing multiple key factors, ranging from individual behaviours and attitudes
to health-related indicators to social contact patterns. Moreover, our sampling approach and
continued data collection allow us to compare people’s behaviours across countries that are at
different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to assess changes in behaviours after pivotal
events, such as nationwide lockdowns.
In this paper, we present first results based on survey data collected over the period March
13 to April 19, 2020 in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, the United
Kingdom, and the United States. Over this period, a total of 71,612 participants completed
the questionnaire. Our goal here is to provide insights into the relation between participants’
demographic characteristics and (i) the threat they perceive COVID-19 to pose to various
levels of society, (ii) the confidence they have in the preparedness of different national and
international organisations to handle the current crisis, and (iii) the behavioural measures

(preventive measures and social distancing measures) they have taken to protect themselves
from the coronavirus. From a public health perspective, this information is key to understand
the behaviours and attitudes of specific demographic groups in different countries, and to help
guide the decision-making process to design adequate policies to contain the spread of COVID19.
In the following sections, we describe the main characteristics of our sample and present
results on behaviours and attitudes we observed in our sample in response to the pandemic. We
close with a discussion and an outlook for the next steps in our broader project. The methodological approach as well as the innovative aspects of participant recruitment via Facebook, can

Results
Participant characteristics

A total of 71,612 participants completed the survey in Belgium (N=6,253), France (N=6,691),
Germany (N=12,442), Italy (N=9,741), the Netherlands (N=5,292), Spain (N=7,491), the
United Kingdom (N=8,753), and the United States (N=14,949) in the period between March
13, 2020 (calendar week 11) and April 19, 2020 (calendar week 16). As Table 1 shows, participation by week was high in all countries, with a median number of 2,343 respondents per week
in Belgium, 1,490 in France, 3,058 in Germany, 1,810 in Italy, 1,759 in the Netherlands, 2,014
in Spain, 1,114 in the United Kingdom, and 2,496 in the United States.
Table 1 also shows the demographic characteristics of the participants in each country, based
on the unweighted sample. The sex ratio is somewhat skewed towards females compared to the
overall population, ranging from 62% female in Germany to 70% female in France. In terms of
age, older respondents tend to be over-represented, with a median age of 49 years (IQR 32-62)
in Belgium, 46 years (IQR 29-61) in France, 41 years (IQR 28-56) in Germany, 39 years (IQR
27-56) in Italy, 55 years (IQR 38-64) in the Netherlands, 49 years (IQR 36-60) in Spain, 56 years
(IQR 41-65) in the United Kingdom, and 56 years (IQR 38-65) in the United States. When
it comes to education, there is some variation across countries. More specifically, in Belgium
(47%), France (71%), Spain (60%), the United Kingdom (46%), and the United States (60%)
most respondents attained university-level education, whereas in Germany (61%), Italy (49%),
and the Netherlands (58%) most respondents attained secondary-level education.
After applying post-stratification weights, the bias described above is reduced and the sample approximates the shares reported in nationally representative surveys in terms of sex, age,
and educational attainment, as shown in Figure S3 in the Supplementary Materials. For more
details, see Section 3 of the Supplementary Materials.

The threat perception of COVID-19

Overall, the threat perception of COVID-19 is highest in Italy with a mean value of 0.69,
followed by Spain with 0.68, the United Kingdom with 0.67, France with 0.66, Belgium with
0.65, the Netherlands with 0.62, the United States with 0.61, and lastly Germany with 0.55.
In all countries, there is significant variation in the threat that respondents perceive to
different levels of society, by sex and age groups. Figure 1A shows the relationship between the
threat perceived by male and female respondents for all levels of society and age groups. Here
we observe several patterns. First, the perceived threat is significantly higher among women
than among men, except for the threat to oneself and to the family among people aged 65 and

over. Second, the perception of threat increases sharply from the personal sphere, i.e. oneself
and the family, to more distal contexts, i.e. the local community, the country, and, ultimately,
the world. Considering specifically the perceived threat to oneself and to the world, the latter is
on average 51% greater. Third, younger people perceive lower threat compared to older people,
except for the threat to their family. The latter finding is further supported by Figures 1B
and C, which show the relation between the perceived threat to oneself and the family (Figure
1B), and between the perceived threat to the country and the world (Figure 1C), contingent
on age. The younger age group (i.e. 18-24) perceives a moderately low threat to themselves
with a median value of 0.35 (IQR 0.34-0.38), but significantly higher to their family with a
median value of 0.53 (IQR 0.52-0.55). By contrast, the older age group (i.e. 65+) perceives a
moderately high threat both to themselves and to their family with a median value of 0.57 (IQR
0.53-0.60). On the other hand, the threat posed by COVID-19 at the national and global level
is perceived similarly across all age group, while older individuals (45-64 and 65+) generally
perceived the threat as higher. For the sake of completeness, we report the perceived threat
posed by COVID-19 broken down by country, age, and sex in Figure S5 in the Supplementary
Materials.

Fig. 2. Comparison between the perceived threat posed by influenza and COVID19. Perceived threat posed by influenza (A), and COVID-19 (B) to oneself, the family, the
local community, the country, and the world. The x-axis reports countries, namely Belgium
(BE), France (FR), Germany (DE), Italy (IT), the Netherlands (NL), Spain (ES), the United
Kingdom (UK), and the United States (US).
When comparing the threat perception for seasonal influenza with that for COVID-19, we
observe that the latter is significantly higher, as shown in Figure 2. In more detail, the perceived
threat to oneself is on average 49% higher (ranging from 38% in Germany to 56% in Belgium),
the threat to the family is 46% higher (37% in Germany to 52% in Belgium), the threat to the
local community is 45% higher (38% in Germany to 54% in Belgium), the threat to the country
is 64% higher (50% in Germany to 74% in Spain), and the threat to the world is 54% higher
(44% in Italy to 59% in Belgium). More details about the perceived threat posed by influenza
can be found in Section 5 of the Supplementary Materials.
The temporal trend of threat perception differs across countries and it is particularly interesting in Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Figure 3A shows
the weekly percent change of threat perception compared to the initial value in the first week
of data collection. In particular, the threat perception significantly varies for Germany, the
United Kingdom, and the United States. While in Germany the threat perception slowly decreased over time, in the United Kingdom and in the United States it drastically increased
before decreasing to values closer to the ones of week 11.

1.3

The confidence in organisations

Figure 4A shows the level of confidence that respondents have in the preparedness of organisations to effectively deal with COVID-19. The confidence in the healthcare system is lowest
in the United Kindgom and in the United States, and highest in Spain. In particular, people’s
confidence in the national healthcare system tends to be lower than their confidence in the local
healthcare system, except in Italy and in the United Kingdom, ranging from 2% lower in Spain
to 19% lower in France. On the other hand, the confidence in the local and national governments differs substantially across all countries. Confidence in the local and national government
is lowest in France, while highest in Germany and the Netherlands, respectively. In particular,
people report greater confidence in the national government in Italy, the Netherlands, and the
United Kingdom, respectively 6%, 7%, and 13% higher than the confidence in the local government. In the remaining countries, instead, people trust less the national government, ranging
from 3% lower in Germany to 28% lower in France.
Examining differences between the sexes in Figure 4B, we observe that on average men

tend to be more confident in the local and national health systems, whereas women tend to
trust more the WHO and the local government. No significant variation is observed in the
confidence in the national government, although there is a substantial difference in the United
States, where men have greater confidence in the national government than women. Figure S6
in the Supplementary Materials shows the level of confidence in the organisations, broken down
by country, age group, and sex.
When examining the temporal trend, the pattern of confidence in organisations differs across
countries and significantly varies for Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United
States. Figure 3B shows the weekly percent change in the level of confidence compared to
the initial value in the first week of data collection. In all countries, people lose trust in the
WHO over time. In Germany, the confidence in the preparedness of the healthcare systems and
governments shows a positive trend. In Italy, people’s confidence slowly decreases, and is down
by approximately 16% in week 16 compared to week 11. In the United Kingdom, confidence
in the healthcare systems and governments drastically increased after the government decision
of locking down the country. On the other hand, in the United States, the temporal pattern is
more variable. The level of confidence in the healthcare systems increases from week 15, after
remaining constant for nearly a month. We observed fairly stable levels of confidence in the
local government, whereas people’s confidence in the national government remained below the
initial value.

Preventive behaviours in response to COVID-19

Figure 5A shows the adoption rate of behaviours by country defined as the weighted proportion
of individuals who reported having adopted a given preventive behaviour. The least frequent
behaviour is the stockpiling of food and/or medicine, ranging from about 18% of individuals
in the United Kingdom to about 31% in the United States. Wearing a face mask ranges from
about 7% in the Netherlands to about 60% in Italy. As for hand hygiene, the adoption rate of

more frequent use of hand sanitizer ranges from about 50% in Germany to about 72% in the
United States, whereas the adoption rate of more frequent hand washing ranges from about 87%
in Germany to about 94% in Spain. The most frequently reported behaviours are, respectively,
the reduced use of transportation, which ranges from about 67% in the Netherlands to about
82% in Spain, and increased social distancing, which ranges from about 93% in the United
States to about 98% in Italy.
Figure 5B shows the adoption rate of wearing a protective face mask broken down by sex,
age, and calendar week. Apart from the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, women and
people 45 years or older show the highest adoption rates of face masks. Moreover, the use of
a face mask substantially increased over time, except for in Belgium and in the Netherlands.
Figure S7B of the Supplementary Materials reports the adoption of behaviours broken down
by age, sex, and calendar week. On average, women tend to adopt more protective behaviours
compared to men. Social distancing has increased sharply in the United Kingdom and in the
United States, whereas it has decreased in Germany, reflecting different stages of the epidemic
and different policies.

Discussion

Understanding how different demographic groups perceive the risk of COVID-19, and thus
adopt specific behaviours in response to it, is key to enable public health agencies to develop
optimal intervention strategies to contain the spread of the disease. In this paper, we have presented insights from survey data collected through a cross-national online survey, the COVID-19
Health Behavior Survey (CHBS). The survey is ongoing, and here we presented results based on
data collected during the period March 13–April 19, 2020 in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy,
the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In this closing section,
we summarize the main findings and provide our interpretation in light of the current evidence
on the COVID-19 pandemic.

First, we found that the perception of the threat that COVID-19 poses was on average
highest in Italy, followed by Spain, the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, the
United States, and Germany. Conversely, respondents’ confidence in the preparedness of local
and national organisations to deal with COVID-19 was on average highest in the Netherlands,
followed by Italy, Spain, Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, Belgium, and
France. In particular, Italy was the first most affected country in Europe in terms of numbers
of cases and deaths, as well as the first country in Europe to implement a nationwide lockdown
on March 11, 2020. This may explain the high threat perceived by the population in Italy,
and, together with the high confidence in the different health systems and different levels of
government, the willingness to adopt preventive behaviours and adhere to social distancing
measures.
After Italy, nationwide lockdowns were implemented also in Spain (March 14), France
(March 17), Belgium (March 18), Germany (March 22), the Netherlands (March 24), and
the United Kingdom (March 24) in order to curb the progression of the virus and to prevent
overloading the healthcare system [17]. In the United States, instead, restrictive measures were
implemented at the state level, starting in California on March 19, 2020. Note that the lockdowns had different nuances across countries, not encompassing exactly the same restrictions.
Notably, regarding the United Kingdom and the United States, our data collected before and
after lockdown measures were implemented (considering the United States as a whole) allow to
observe temporal variation in the self-reported behaviours and attitudes: the perceived threat
has increased in the population, along with the adoption of social distancing measures. In
the case of the United Kingdom, after the lockdown was implemented, the level of confidence
in the health systems and different levels of government sharply increased, possibly reflecting
discontent in the population about previously announced strategies.

By contrast, in Germany, a somewhat less restrictive lockdown was implemented on March
22, 2020, allowing outdoor activities for families or people living in the same household.
Nonetheless, we observe that the adoption rate of social distancing measures was high from
the very beginning of our observation period, as well as the confidence in the health systems
and both local and national government, which then has further increased over time, contrary
to the perceived threat of COVID-19 which instead has decreased over time. This might be
interpreted as a case of spontaneous bottom-up behavioural changes emerging from the population, following high trust in decisions and preparedness of the government. Also, of the
European countries considered in this study, Germany had the third highest number of cases
(about 140,000), but placed only sixth in terms of deaths (about 4,000) as of April 19, 2020
[18], which might explain the lower perceived risk perception in the population.
Second, we observe a clear pattern in threat perceptions regarding different levels of society,
sharply increasing from moderate threat for the personal sphere (threat to oneself and the
family) to very high threat for more distal contexts (i.e. the local community, the country,
and the world). Yet, even though the perception of threat to oneself among our respondents
was comparatively low, we found that a high share of them had increased their hand hygiene.
This insight renders it uncertain as to what extent behaviour can be straightforwardly linked
to perceptions of personal threat. Furthermore, we found that the perceived threat posed by
COVID-19 is significantly higher than the perceived threat posed by seasonal influenza. One
likely explanation for this is that although seasonal influenza causes regular annual epidemics
worldwide [19], the novelty and uncertainty that surround COVID-19 leads risk perception to
be substantially higher.
Third, apart from variation at the country level, we found age-specific differences. Looking
at the age component, our findings suggest that younger people perceive the threat to themselves
lower than older people. This is in line with the evidence that older adults are at highest risk
of severe complications following infection from COVID-19 [20]. By contrast, the age structure
in the perceived threat to the family is less pronounced, which suggests that respondents were
concerned about their family members, regardless of their own age and the perceived threat to
themselves.
Fourth, we also found sex-specific patterns in the data. Specifically, female respondents
perceived the threat that COVID-19 poses substantially higher, reported a lower confidence
in the health system, and were more willing to adopt protective behaviours. Since the case
fatality rate for COVID-19 is substantially higher for men [21], we might expect that men are
more concerned about it. Our results demonstrate that this is not necessarily true, and that
may have to be considered in the design of future communication campaigns.
We gained these insights by using a novel approach for collecting health behaviour data in
times of a pandemic. We employed Facebook advertising campaigns to continuously recruit a
large number of participants for our survey over a long period of time. This approach allows
us to target specific demographic groups in a comparative, cross-national approach, and to
collect balanced samples to which post-stratification methods can be applied. To the best of
our knowledge, our survey provides the most comprehensive and rigorous cross-country and
comparative data on health status, attitudes and behaviors during the peak months of the
COVID-19 epidemic in Spring 2020 in Europe and in the United States.
These advantages notwithstanding, our approach also has some limitations. First, online
surveys potentially suffer from bias due to self-selection and non-representativeness of the sample. In the case of Facebook, there is increasing evidence that samples obtained from this
social media network are not significantly different in central demographic and psychometric
characteristics from samples obtained by more traditional recruitment and sampling techniques

[12]. Furthermore, by applying post-stratification weighting, which is a standard procedure in
survey research, we can correct for non-representativeness in observable characteristics (but not
necessarily for self-selection based on unobservable characteristics), at least at the level of the
entire sample. Ideally, in our cross-temporal comparisons, we would apply this approach at the
level of the week, to warrant complete comparability of observations over time, but issues of
data sparsity complicate this approach. We do not expect this to strongly affect our results,
but it should be kept in mind that our weekly results might suffer from somewhat larger bias
than our aggregate results.
Second, our data collection started at different time points across countries, and also pertains
to different points in the trajectory of the pandemic across countries. This also encompasses
differences in the implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions ordered by local and
national governments, and needs to be kept in mind when comparing and interpreting our
results across countries.
Third, the data presented here have the form of repeated cross sections, which enables us
to assess changes in the population samples over time, but does not allow us to assess changes
within individuals.
We are planning to address some of the limitations in the future in the following way.
First, we aim to expand our post-stratification weighting scheme, by applying multilevel poststratification, which will enable us to achieve greater consistency among differently sized strata
and greater precision in the estimates for population subsets, such as the weekly estimates
presented here. Second, we aim to carry out a follow-up survey among participants who agreed
to provide their email address for this. This panel perspective offers a unique possibility to
understand how the COVID-19 pandemic affects the population in the long run and to assess
the impact of loosening the lockdown measures on social contact patterns and health behaviours
in a cross-national perspective.
To conclude, our work reduces the gap in human behavioural data, by providing timely
and accurate data on individual behaviours and attitudes across countries. Our work also
illustrates how social media networks, like Facebook, together with appropriate survey designs
and statistical methods, offer an innovative and powerful tool for rapid and continuous data
collection to monitor trends in behaviours relevant for mitigation strategies of COVID-19.
Taken together, the insights gained from our survey data are particularly relevant for policy
makers and help design appropriate public health strategies and communication campaigns,
and to design realistic epidemic models, which can account not only for the spatio-temporal
spread of the infection, but also for accurate data on individual human behaviours.

Methods
Study design and data collection

The CHBS is designed to collect information on respondents’ health behaviours and attitudes
related to COVID-19. Participation in the survey is anonymous and voluntary. Respondents
can stop participating at any time and can skip questions they feel uncomfortable answering.
The questionnaire consists of four topical sections: (i) socio-demographic indicators (age,
sex, country of birth, country of residence, level of education, household size and composition);
(ii) health indicators (underlying medical conditions, flu vaccination status, pregnancy, symptoms experienced in the previous seven days); (iii) opinions and behaviours (perceived threat
from COVID-19, level of trust in institutions, level of confidence in sources of information, preventive measures taken, disruptions to daily routine); (iv) social contact data, i.e. the number

of interactions that respondents had the day before participating in the survey in different settings (at home, at school, at work, or in other locations). To facilitate validation and warrant
comparability with existing surveys, we included standard questions from several sources, such
as the European Social Survey (ESS) [22] regarding socio-demographic characteristics, Ipsos
[23] regarding opinions on the coronavirus outbreak, and the Polymod project [24] regarding
social contacts. Note that we ask respondents about their behaviour and attitudes related to
the coronavirus outbreak only if they indicated that they were aware of it. In more detail, we
asked respondents how much, if at all, they had seen, read or heard about the coronavirus outbreak, with the answer options “A great deal”, “A fair amount”, “Not very much”, “Nothing
at all”, and “Prefer not to answer”. Respondents who indicated that they knew nothing at
all, or that they preferred not to answer, were not asked any further questions related to the
outbreak.
We created the questionnaire first in English, and then translated it into the different
official languages of the countries in our study, with support from professional translators. We
considered country-level differences when adjusting the questionnaire for different countries,
where applicable (e.g. differences in the educational system). In the online implementation,
the questionnaire is available in both English and the national language(s) of the respective
country in which respondents are located. The questionnaire was implemented in the online
survey tool LimeSurvey (version 3.22.8+20030) and hosted by the Society for Scientific Data
Processing (GWDG). The full English questionnaire (as used in the United States) is reported
in the Appendix.
The link to the questionnaire is distributed through advertisement campaigns that we created via the FAM. Facebook is currently the largest social media platform, with 2.45 billion
monthly active users worldwide as of September 2019 [25]. In the United States, about 69% of
adults used Facebook in 2019 [26], with similar penetration rates in Europe, ranging from 56%
in Germany to 92% in Denmark [27]. The FAM enables advertisers to create advertising campaigns that can be targeted at specific user groups, as defined by their demographic characteristics (e.g. sex and age) and a set of characteristics that Facebook infers from their behaviour on
the network (e.g. interests). An increasing number of studies explore the use of Facebook in demographic and health research to recruit participants for online surveys [28, 29, 30]. Two main
advantages of this approach are rooted in Facebook’s wide reach and the possibility to directly
target members of different demographic groups. Two concerns that are often raised are that
in online samples self-selection might lead to bias in results, and that online sub-populations
may not be representative of the general population. However, there is increasing evidence
that samples obtained from Facebook do not significantly differ from samples obtained from
more traditional recruitment and sampling techniques in central demographic and psychometric
characteristics, especially if post-stratification weights are applied adequately [10, 12, 31, 32].
We created one advertising campaign per country and stratified each campaign by sex (male
and female), age group (18-24, 25-44, 45-64, and 65+ years), and region of residence (largely
following the NUTS classification in Europe and the census regions in US; see Table S4 in
the Supplementary Materials), resulting in 24 to 56 strata per country, further stratified using
six different ad images. Figure S1 in Section 1 of the Supplementary Materials illustrates the
structure of our Facebook advertising campaigns in the United States. Note that we aggregated
the different regions of residence into larger macro-regions, to keep the number of strata in
Facebook manageable (see Table S4 for the exact mapping). We launched the campaigns on
March 13, 2020, in Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United States. We added Germany and
France on March 17, Spain on March 19, the Netherlands on April 1, and Belgium on April 4,
2020. In the period 21-26 March, we were unable to recruit a significant number of participants

due to technical issues with the FAM which prevented the delivery of our advertisements.

3.2

Data pre-processing

We select participants for our analysis in three steps. First, we include only participants who
reported that they lived in the country that the respective advertising campaign and countryspecific questionnaire targeted, and who reported their sex, age, and region of residence (the
central variables in our post-stratification weighting approach, see details below). Second, when
analysing responses to a given question, we exclude respondents who chose the options “Don’t
know” or “Prefer not to answer”. In the analysis reported here, this particularly affects the
question about awareness of the coronavirus outbreak (see Section 3.1); however, as Table S2
in the Supplementary Materials shows, the share of respondents to whom this applies is less
than 1% across countries. Third, given that in calendar week 12 we were only able to collect
a small number of completed questionnaires in Spain (less than 100), we excluded these data
from our analysis as the sample size would render our analysis unreliable for this period. Note
that all period references consider local time zones across countries and regions.
After participant selection, we apply post-stratification weights to the final data set in order
to correct for potential issues with non-representativeness in our sample. We use a standard
procedure in survey research, in which appropriate weights are computed based on population
information from more traditional data sources (e.g. census data). Here we use population data
from Eurostat (2019) [33] and the US census (2018) [34]. Specifically, for each stratum i (given
by each combination of sex, age, and macro-region) in each country, we compute the fraction
pi and p̂i of, respectively, the true population counts Ni and the sample counts N̂i , compared
P
P
to the total population i Ni and the total sample size i N̂i . The weights wi are then defined
as wi = pi /p̂i , thus giving less weight to groups which are over-represented (wi < 1) and more
weight to groups which are under-represented (wi > 1) in the sample. We provide more details
about our approach to post-stratification in Section 3 of the Supplementary Materials.

3.3

Data Analysis

In our analysis, we focus on (i) perceptions of threat from COVID-19, (ii) confidence in the
preparedness of different national and international organisations to respond to this threat, and
(iii) behavioural measures taken to protect oneself from the virus. All our analyses are based
on the weighted sample, whereas the reported sample sizes refer to the unweighted sample.
We asked respondents to rate the threat they perceived COVID-19 to pose for different
levels of society (i.e. to themselves, their family, their local community, their country, and the
world) on a 5-point Likert-type scale (1 = very low threat, 5 = very high threat), including the
options “Don’t know” and “Prefer not to answer”, which are treated as missing values (Table
S3 in the Supplementary Materials reports the corresponding sample size for each item). For
comparison, we asked respondents to answer the same questions also for the seasonal flu. We
normalized respondents’ answers to each item to the range 0-1, meaning that values around 0.5
correspond to moderate perceived threat, whereas 0 and 1 correspond to low and high perceived
threat, respectively.
In a similar way, we asked respondents to rate the confidence they had in the preparedness
and ability of different organisations to effectively deal with the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e.
doctors and healthcare professionals in their community, hospitals in their local area, health
care services in their country, the World Health Organization, their local government, and
their national government) on a 4-point Likert-type scale (1 = not confident at all, 4 = very

confident), also including the options “Don’t know” and “Prefer not to answer”, which are
treated as missing values (see Table S3 in the Supplementary Materials). We normalized
answers to the range 0-1, and aggregated responses related to the local health system (doctors
and healthcare professionals in respondents’ community and hospitals in their local area) by
averaging them across items within respondents.
Finally, we asked respondents which measures, if any, they had taken to protect themselves
from the coronavirus. For this, we showed a list of actions, from which they could choose all
that apply. This list includes preventive measures (e.g. washing hand more often), measures
of social distancing (e.g. avoided social events), measures of reduced mobility (e.g. avoided
public transportation), panic buying (e.g. stockpiling of food), and potential discriminatory
actions (e.g. avoided eating in Asian restaurants). See the questionnaire in the Appendix for
the full list of actions. In the analysis, we consider the shares of participants who reported
having adopted specific behaviours in response to COVID-19, including: (i) the stockpiling of
food and/or medicine; (ii) the use of a face mask; (iii) the increased use of hand sanitizer; (iv)
the increased washing of hands; (v) social distancing (if participants selected at least one of
the following: avoided shaking hands, avoided social activities, and avoided crowded places);
and (vi) the reduced use of transportation (if participants selected at least one of the following:
avoided travelling by public transportation, and avoided travelling by taxi).
In our analyses, we used non-parametric tests for median comparisons (Wilcoxon test to
compare two groups and Kruskall–Wallis test to compare three or more groups) and considered
p-values of less than 0.05 to be significant. Data analysis was performed with the programming
language Python (version 3.7).
