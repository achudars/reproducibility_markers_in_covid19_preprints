Abstract
Introduction
Traditional approaches to case-finding, case isolation, and contact tracing methods have so far
proved insufficient on their own to prevent the development of local epidemics of COVID-19 in
many high-income countries despite relatively advanced public health systems. As a result,
many governments have resorted to widespread social distancing measures and mass
quarantines (‘lock-downs’) to reduce transmission and to prevent healthcare systems from being
overwhelmed. However, such measures impose heavy human and societal costs. Automated or
semi-automated digital contact tracing, in conjunction with scaled-up community testing, has
been proposed as a key part of exit strategies from lockdowns. However, the effectiveness of
these approaches to contact tracing is unclear, and to be effective, trusted, and widely adopted
such technology must overcome several challenges.
Methods and analysis
We will perform a rapid systematic review to assess the effectiveness of automated and semiautomated digital tools for contact tracing, and identify key considerations for successful
implementation, to inform the control of COVID-19. We will search PubMed, EMBASE, EBSCO
Medical COVID information portal, OVID Global Health, Cochrane Library, medRxiv, BioRxiv,
and arXiv for peer-reviewed and pre-print papers on automated or semi-automated digital tools
for contact tracing of COVID-19, another respiratory disease with pandemic potential (limited to
SARS, MERS, or pandemic influenza), or Ebola, in human populations. Studies will be eligible if
published in English between 1 January 2000 and 14 April 2020. We will synthesise study
findings narratively and will consider meta-analysis if ≥3 suitable studies with comparable
interventions and outcomes are available.
Ethics and dissemination
Ethical approval is not required for this review. We plan to disseminate findings via pre-print,
journal publication, through social media and web-based platforms and through direct
stakeholder engagement.

Introduction
COVID-19 is a highly infectious novel coronavirus whose spread has rapidly led to a global
pandemic since the first cases were identified in China in late 2019 (Huang et al. 2020). In the
absence of effective treatment or a vaccine, control of an emergent pathogen typically relies on
effective case-finding (supported by testing), case isolation, and contact tracing, which is
traditionally carried out manually using information provided by cases (Ferretti et al., 2020).
Despite relatively advanced public health systems in many high-income countries, these
methods have so far proved insufficient on their own to prevent the establishment of local
epidemics, particularly without automation of contact tracing processes and where testing
capacity is limited. To mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on health systems and reduce the
number of deaths from the disease, many governments have resorted to measures including
widespread social distancing, school and business closures, and mass quarantines (or ‘lockdowns’). However, these interventions impose heavy societal costs, including impacts on mental
health, education, domestic violence and job losses; these are increased the longer lock-downs
continue. Proposed exit strategies have emphasised the role of contact tracing in conjunction
with substantially increased testing capacity (Ferretti et al., 2020).

Contact tracing is the process of finding individuals who are at increased risk of developing an
infectious disease due to their exposure to a known case. This process is not conventionally
automated, is time and resource intensive, and relies on cases’ accurate recall of information
about their recent movements and interactions. Moreover, for it to have an impact case
identification, diagnosis and contact tracing must all occur during the incubation period before a
contact becomes infectious themselves. Because of this, contact tracing is rarely done for
rapidly infectious respiratory infections, such as influenza. COVID-19 presents particular
challenges for contact tracing (Hellewell et al. 2020): it is moderately transmissible, with the
basic reproduction number (R0) estimated at 2-3 (Liu et al. 2020), its symptoms can be difficult
to distinguish from other respiratory tract infections, it has a relatively short incubation period of
approximately 5 days (Lauer et al. 2020), and a substantial proportion of individuals have
asymptomatic clinical courses or mild symptoms that go relatively unnoticed (Bai et al. 2020).
Moreover, a large majority of individuals are currently susceptible, such that large outbreaks of
COVID-19 can develop rapidly.

To address challenges including imperfect recall by cases and the time delays often introduced
by manual contact tracing (potentially enabling more complete, accurate and timely contact

identification and notification), as well as to enable rapid scaling and reduce their resourceintensiveness, a number of novel automated or semi-automated approaches to contact tracing
have been developed in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g. Wang et al. 2020;
TraceTogether; Private Automated Contact Tracing [PACT]). However, there are a number of
potential pitfalls to such approaches, including concerns regarding privacy, security and other
ethical considerations, and the fact that high levels of uptake by populations may be required for
effectiveness (Ferretti et al. 2020; Hellewell et al. 2020). A review of the evidence regarding the
effectiveness and implications of attempts to automate contact tracing to date may offer
valuable learning to inform potential exit strategies from mass quarantines and technology
development efforts, so that risks are addressed pre-emptively within any proposed strategy.

Objective
To assess the effectiveness of automated and semi-automated digital tools for contact tracing,
and identify key considerations for successful implementation, to inform the control of COVID19.

Methods and analysis
We will search PubMed, EMBASE, EBSCO Medical COVID information portal, OVID Global
Health, Cochrane Library, medRxiv, BioRxiv, and arXiv, for pre-print and peer-reviewed articles
from any geographical setting published from 1 January 2000 to 13 April 2020. Due to the short
timelines for this review, our search is restricted to studies with a full text available in English.
The search terms to be used for these databases are provided in Box 1. We will supplement this
with a grey literature search using Google Advanced (with a sub-selection of these search terms
due to Google Advanced’s restriction of searches to 32 search terms).
Box 1: Search terms
Studies in which title, abstract or keywords (using MeSH terms where applicable) contain
terms related to ("digital*" OR “automat*” OR "technology" OR "tech" OR “electronic*” OR "app" OR
“application” OR "smartphone*" OR “smart-phone*” OR "mobile*" OR “phone*” OR “online*”

Eligibility criteria
We will include the following study designs: interventional (randomised and non-randomised
controlled studies), observational (cohort, case-control, cross-sectional, before-and-after
studies, and time series analysis), modelling studies and case studies. Studies adopting solely
qualitative study designs will not be included.
Articles must refer to automated or semi-automated digital tools for contact tracing in human
populations of COVID-19, another respiratory disease with pandemic potential (limited to SARS,
MERS, or influenza), or Ebola. We will restrict interventions to these disease groups to ensure
that the results are applicable to COVID-19. Although Ebola is not a respiratory illness, novel
methods for contact tracing in challenging circumstances were developed to contain this
disease in conjunction with similar measures - for example, quarantines - to those applied in the
current COVID-19 pandemic, such that findings may be applicable. The following digital tools
will be eligible for inclusion: web-based (e.g. where a case inputs their contacts), stand-alone
applications used on either a smartphone and/or computer, tools developed as an add-on to an
existing application (e.g. adding a COVID-19 tracker to an existing health, mapping or
messaging application), mobile signal traffic from telecommunications operators. We will include
articles that provide a comparison either with no contact tracing, contact tracing without
automated or semi-automated digital tools, other non-pharmaceutical disease control
interventions, as well as articles without a comparator.
Outcomes
Our primary outcomes of interest are the number or proportion of contacts identified and the
number or proportion of contacts who go on to become cases who are identified. Secondary

outcomes include: impact on R0 (or other indicators of outbreak control), uptake of the contact
tracing tool or app, resource requirements or cost-effectiveness, data security and privacy, other
ethical issues, public perception of the tool, lessons learnt from implementation of the
intervention. Studies will be included in the review irrespective of whether primary or secondary
outcomes of interest (or both) are reported. Studies written in languages other than English
which appear relevant based on their abstracts will be reported in an appendix of possibly
relevant articles.
Study screening
Screening will be performed by two researchers with experience of public health and systematic
review methods [IB and TC] using Covidence software. The initial (level one) screen of titles and
abstracts will be carried out by one reviewer, with a second reviewer checking 10% of excluded
records. Full-text (level two) screening of full manuscripts for eligibility will be undertaken by two
reviewers, with one reviewer making initial inclusion decisions and a second reviewer checking
all excluded records. A provisional screening form (available in the Appendix) has been
prepared based on the eligibility criteria outlined above and has been pilot-tested by the review
team using 10 citations for level one screening and 10 full-text articles for level two screening.
We will resolve any discrepancies by consensus between the two reviewers; a third reviewer
[MB] will be involved in any cases where consensus cannot be reached through discussion. All
decisions to exclude studies taken during both stages of study screening will be documented
and outlined in the final report with a list of excluded studies.
Data abstraction
Items for data abstraction will include:

Primary outcomes (a - number or proportion of contacts (irrespective of subsequent case
status) identified; b - number or proportion of contacts who go on to become cases who
are identified);
Details of any of the seven secondary outcomes of interest (see inclusion criteria) for
which data is presented.

A standardized data abstraction form has been developed and pilot-tested to capture data on
the above listed items.
Data management
We will use the Covidence software platform for data management, and will report inclusion and
exclusion of studies using a PRISMA flowchart. If there is a conflict between data reported
across multiple sources for a single study (e.g. between a published article and a registry
record), we will use data from the published article preferentially, taking into account any
corrections or errata published subsequently.
Quality assessment
For analytical studies including interventional and observational study designs, we will use the
Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) tool (evaluated by Armijo-Olivo et al. 2012)
and linked guidance to guide a rapid quality appraisal of studies eligible for inclusion. For
economic evaluation and modelling studies we will use an adapted version of the CHEERS
checklist (Husereau et al. 2013), excluding any questions not relevant to the study design.
Quality assessment will be undertaken by one reviewer for all included studies. Studies will not
be excluded from narrative synthesis on the basis of the quality score assigned.
Synthesis of findings
In addition to a summary table containing key details about each study, we will use narrative
synthesis to bring together study findings. Meta-analysis will be considered if three or more
papers investigating a comparable intervention within a similar disease context and which report
a comparable quantitative primary outcome measure are identified.
