Summary

27

The immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 proteome is largely unknown, especially for non-

28

structural proteins and accessory proteins. Here we collected 2,360 COVID-19 sera and 601

29

control sera. We analyzed these sera on a protein microarray with 20 proteins of SARS-CoV-

30

2, built an antibody response landscape for IgG and IgM. We found that non-structural proteins

31

and accessory proteins NSP1, NSP7, NSP8, RdRp, ORF3b and ORF9b elicit prevalent IgG

32

responses. The IgG patterns and dynamic of non-structural/ accessory proteins are different

33

from that of S and N protein. The IgG responses against these 6 proteins are associated with

34

disease severity and clinical outcome and declined sharply about 20 days after symptom onset.

35

In non-survivors, sharp decrease of IgG antibodies against S1 and N protein before death was

36

observed. The global antibody responses to non-structural/ accessory proteins revealed here

37

may facilitate deeper understanding of SARS-CoV-2 immunology.

Introduction

55

COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2 1,2, has become one of the most threatening crisis to global

56

public health. By November 4, 2020, 47,328,401 cases were diagnosed and 1,212,070 lives

57

were claimed (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html)3. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the

58

betacoronavirus genus and its genome encodes four major structural proteins, i. e., spike (S),

59

envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N), and 15 non-structural proteins (Nsp1-10

60

and Nsp12-16) and 9 accessory proteins4. Among them, the S protein, consists of N-terminal

61

S1 fragment and C-terminal S2 fragment, plays an essential role in viral attachment, fusion,

62

and entry into the target cells that express the viral receptor, i. e., angiotensin-converting

63

enzyme 2 (ACE2)5–9. While the function, including immunogenicity of most of the non-

64

structural proteins and accessory proteins are still elusive.

65

One of the major features of COVID-19 patients is the extreme variability of clinical severity

66

from asymptom to death10. However, the factors that cause this variability are still largely

67

unknown. Humoral immune responses elicited by SARS-CoV-2 play essential roles, especially

68

in diagnosis, neutralizing antibody production and vaccine development11–13. Among all the

69

SARS-CoV-2 proteins, S protein and N protein exhibit high immunogenicity. Antibodies

70

against S protein and N protein are elicited in most patients, and with higher titers in severe

71

patients, demonstrating the association between severity and humoral immune responses 12,14.

72

It was reported that the antibodies against peptides derived from non-structural and accessory

73

proteins were also detectable in patients 10,15,16. However, the prevalence, clinical relevance and

74

the dynamic of non-structural proteins and accessory proteins in patients are still largely

75

unknown.

76

Recently, we constructed a SARS-CoV-2 proteome microarray, containing S protein, N

77

protein and most of the NSPs and accessory proteins14. The microarray is a powerful tool to

78

systematically study the humoral immune response, especially the IgG and IgM responses

79

against the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. Based on this platform, we have successfully characterized

80

the humoral immune in convalescent patients14, asymptomatic patients17.

81

Here, we adopted an updated SARS-CoV-2 proteome microarray that contains 20 proteins,

82

profiled 2,360 sera from 783 COVID-19 patients and 601 control sera. We identified that NSP1,

83

NSP7, NSP8, RdRp, ORF3b and ORF9b which can strongly elicit antibodies in COVID-19

84

patients. Further analysis revealed that the patterns of humoral immunity of these non-

85

structural/accessory proteins were distinct from that of S and N protein. The global antibody

86

responses to non-structural proteins and accessory proteins revealed in this study will facilitate

87

the comprehensive understanding of SARS-CoV-2 humoral immunity, and may provide

88

potential biomarkers for precise monitoring of COVID-19 progression.

Results

91

COVID-19 severity and clinical outcome are associated with a set of clinical parameters

92

To systematically analyze the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we first

93

analyzed the correlations between severity and each of the available laboratory parameters of

94

783 COVID-19 patients monitored when admission (Table S1). According to the severity and

95

clinical outcome, the patients were divided into three groups, i. e., Non-severe patients, all of

96

whom were recovered, severe but survived patients and non-survivors. Statistical comparison

97

among these three groups enables us to investigate the features either related to the severity for

98

survivors or to the outcome under similar severity (Table 1). Since for some patients some

99

laboratory examinations were missing, for each clinical parameter only the effective patient

100

numbers were given. Expectedly, gender, age, comorbidities of hypertension and diabetes are

101

associated factors of severity, however, only age are significantly associated with clinical

102

outcome for severe patients. In addition, in consistent with many previous studies18–20, we

103

identified a set of clinical and laboratory parameters which are highly related to severity or

104

outcome , such as lymphopenia, increased CRP (C reaction protein) and factors associated with

105

blood coagulation, cardiac injury, liver injury and kidney injury. Most of these factors are

106

associated both with severity and outcome, while some are likely associated either with severity

107

or outcome. For instance, thrombocytopenia and some kidney injury related factors are more

108

common in non-survivors as compared to the other two groups, while most liver injury related

109

factors are only associated with severity but not outcome.

110
111

Several non-structural and accessory proteins elicit highly prevalent antibody responses

112

Previously, we have constructed a SARS-CoV-2 proteome microarray (Figure S1a, b) and

113

screened a small cohort of convalescent patients 14. Here, we aimed to systematically analyze

114

the immune responses and its dynamic change against SARS-CoV-2 proteins with a much

115

larger cohort of samples. In total, we collected 2,360 sera from 783 laboratory confirmed

116

COVID-19 patients as well as 601 control sera (Table S1). All of these sera were analyzed on

117

the SARS-CoV-2 protein microarray. To acquire high-quality data for the microarray

118

experiments, we prepared a positive control by mixing 50 randomly selected COVID-19 sera.

119

This control was then probed on each microarray to assess and normalize the data. It turned out

120

that high reproducibility was achieved in our assa (Figure S1c, d). To simplify the analysis and

121

assure the comparability among different SARS-CoV-2 proteins, we defined “initial serum” as

122

the first serum collected 14 days after symptom onset for each patient. The results of the initial

123

sera were used to construct the antibody response landscape (Figure 1). Immune response

124

frequency was calculated for each protein with the cutoff value set by mean + 2 x SD of the

125

control group. Except for S1 and N, which are known of highly antigenic, we found that several

126

non-structural and accessory proteins elicited prevalent antibody responses, especially for IgG,

127

including NSP1, NSP7, NSP8, RdRp, ORF3b and ORF9b, for which the positive rates are 38%,

128

48.4%, 27.9%, 30.3%, 52.1% and 28%, respectively. Although the IgM responses were high in

129

some cases, the overall responses are much lower than that of IgG. We then decided to focus

130

on IgG for in-depth analysis.

131
132

The IgG pattern of Non-structural and accessory proteins is distinct from that of S1 and

133

N protein

134

We next asked whether the IgG responses to these proteins are associated with each other. We

135

chose NSP7 as an example. The samples were divided into two groups depending on positive

136

or negative of NSP7 IgG. Positive rates of the rest proteins were calculated for the two groups.

137

Unexpectedly, for all the non-structural and accessory proteins, except for ORF3a, ORF6 and

138

ORF7a which barely elicit antibodies, the positive rates in NSP7-IgG positive group was

139

significantly higher than that in NSP7-IgG negative group, demonstrating high correlations

140

(Figure 2a). Interestingly, there is no obvious difference for the IgG responses of S1 and N.

141

To further confirm our observation, we reversely compared the positive rates of IgG to non-

142

structural/accessory proteins between the groups of S1-IgG positive and negative (Figure 2b).

143

The positive rates of IgG response of N protein are significantly different between these two

144

groups, while no obvious difference was shown for the non-structural/accessory proteins. These

145

observations demonstrate that the structural proteins elicit antibodies with distinct pattern to

146

that of the non-structural and accessory proteins, suggesting that the underlying mechanisms

147

by which the antibodies are triggered are different for these two groups of proteins. To further

148

study the correlations of IgG signal intensity among the proteins, Pearson correlation

149

coefficients between any two of these proteins were calculated and then clustered. The proteins

150

with less than 10% response frequency were not included duo to statistical limit. (Figure 2c).

151

Consistently, the S and N proteins have lower correlations with the non-structural/accessory

152

proteins, while the non-structural/accessory proteins were clustered together. In addition,

153

several sub-clusters were shown among the non-structural/accessory proteins. Interestingly,

154

NSP8 and RdRp have a high correlation (Figure 2d). It is known that RdRp, NSP8 and NSP7

155

could form a tight complex21,22, which might contribute to the high correlation. However, the

156

correlation between NSP8 and NSP7 is less significant (Figure 2c, e). The structure of the

157

complex shows NSP7 physically connect to RdRp and NSP8, but with most of the protein

158

surface blocked (Figure 2f), while NSP8 and RdRp are more accessible. However, NSP7 elicit

159

antibody in a higher frequency (Figure 1a), suggesting NSP7 might mainly exist in other forms

160

rather than complex with NSP8 and RdRp, thus has other yet to be discovered biological

161

function(s). In addition, the IgG responses of NSP2 and NSP16 also have a high correlation

162

(Figure 2c, d-g). It was reported that PPI (protein-protein interaction) was detected between

163

NSP2 and NSP1623. However, we did not detect any direct binding signals between NSP2 and

164

NSP16 in vitro (data not shown), suggesting NSP2 and NSP16 might form a complex through

165

the bridging of other proteins. In addition, differences of the response frequencies among the

166

proteins are not associated with the in vivo protein expression level

167

(Figure S2).

It is known that IgG responses against S and N proteins are associated with disease severity

174

non-survivors. Two statistical methods were applied to assess the correlations. One is to analyze

175

the positive rate of IgG against each protein, and the other is to compare the signal intensity

176

distribution among groups (Figure 3). For both S1 and N, the overall signals for severe groups

177

were slightly higher than that of non-severe group, but there was no significant difference

178

between the survivors and non-survivors. In contrast, the non-structural/accessory proteins, that

179

with high positive rates/ signal intensities, are more significantly correlated with severity. It is

180

worth noting that for the 6 non-structural and accessory proteins, both the positive rates and

181

signal intensities are significantly higher as the disease exacerbates to more severe stages

182

(Figure 3). These results indicate that the IgG responses against non-structural/accessory

183

proteins are of higher correlations with the disease severity, and may could serve as a better

184

predictor of COVID-19 severity than that of S1 and N proteins.

185

We next analyzed the correlation between antibody response and clinical parameter. The

186

clinical parameters, which have statistical correlations with IgG against S1, N, NSP7, NSP8,

187

RdRp, ORF3b and ORF9b, were determined (Table S3, Figure S3). All of these parameters

188

are related with severity, suggesting severity is a major factor and confounder that contribute

189

to the correlations. Interestingly, thrombocytopenia, is related with clinical outcome but not

190

severity (Table 1), is significantly correlated with NSP7 and ORF3b but not S1 and N, further

191

confirming the higher correlations among antibodies of non-structural/accessory proteins and

192

clinical outcome.

193
194

IgG responses of S1 and N proteins decrease several days before death in non-survivors

195

The preserve of high tiers of neutralizing antibodies is essential for protecting the patients from

196

re-infection and vaccine development. One critical question is that how long the antibodies

197

against SARS-CoV-2 can last. A recent study found that antibody titers did not decline within

198

4 months after diagnosis 25, while another studies observed rapid decay of antibodies in mild

199

patients 26,27. So we analyzed the antibody dynamics with our sample set in which the sera were

200

collected from 0 to about 60 days after initial symptom onset. The seroprevalence or positive

201

rates for both S1 and N reached plateau at about 20 days after symptom onset and maintained

202

afterwards for at least two months for all the three groups (Figure 4a, b). However, with regard

203

to signal intensity, a dramatic decrease was observed for the non-survivor group, while not for

204

other two groups, though a slight decline was observed for severe-survivor group (Figure 4c,

205

d). The sharp decline in non-survivors might be related to death. To confirm this possibility,

206

we analyzed 35 patients with serum available 0-2 days before death, and 108 survivors with

207

serum available 0-2 day before discharge as control. For each patient, we defined the relative

208

signal for each sample to the sample immediately before death or discharge. Overall, the

209

relative signals declined gradually during the disease progression from about 10 days before

210

death (Figure 4e) for non-survivors though the trend differed among individuals. In contrast,

211

there is no significant change for the survivors (Figure 4f). These observations might imply a

213

further study are needed to confirm this.

214
215

IgG against the 6 non-structural/accessory proteins decline rapidly during COVID-19

216

progression

217

We next analyzed the dynamic of IgG responses for the 6 non-structural/accessory proteins.

218

Surprisingly, the IgG responses, i.e., the signal intensities and positive rates, against the 6

219

proteins reached plateau in all the three groups at about 20 days after the symptom onset, and

220

then decreased rapidly for all the three groups (Figure 5a, 5b), this is largely different from S1

221

and N protein (Figure 4). We next selected NSP7 IgG as an example for further analysis and

222

depicted the change for each patient (Figure 5c-e). Continuous and dramatic decline of IgG

223

against NSP7 for most patients were observed (Figure 5d, 5e). These results imply the B cells

224

that producing IgG antibodies against non-structural/accessory proteins might be short-lived,

225

and/ or the underlying mechanism of generating IgG antibodies against non-

226

structural/accessory proteins may differ from that of S1 and N proteins.

227
228

Discussion

229

In this study, we profiled 2,360 sera from 783 COVID-19 patients and 601 control sera using a

230

SARS-CoV-2 proteome microarray. We found that 6 non-structural/accessory proteins elicit

231

strong antibody responses in COVID-19 patients, including NSP1, NSP7, NSP8, RdRp, ORF3b

232

and ORF9b.

233

It is broadly reported that a batch of clinical laboratory parameters are associated with disease

234

severity of COVID-19 patients, such as lymphopenia, neutrophilia, increased value of CRP,

235

LDH and D-dimer18–20. What we observed are mostly consistent with these reports. We also

236

found some parameters that were more related with clinical outcome. For example, there is no

237

obvious difference of the levels of thrombocytopenia between non-severe and severe survivors,

238

but significant decline in non-survivors, suggesting the issue of blood coagulation in COVID-

239

19 patients should be carefully monitored during therapy and fully evaluation for the

240

contribution to death.

241

NSP1 is a major virulence factor that binds with the small subunit of host ribosome to

242

suppress host gene expression28. NSP7, NSP8 and RdRp (NSP12) form a complex, which is

243

involved in the replication and transcription of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, playing an essential

244

role for virus replication. RdRp is the target of a promising drug Remedesivir22. ORF3b is

245

reported to be a potent IFN antagonist29 and was identified to elicit antibodies in COVID-19

246

patients30. ORF9b can suppress type I IFN production by targeting host protein TOM70

247

Previous studies have found the presence of antibodies against SARS ORF9b32,33, and ORF9b

248

IgG antibody identified in convalescent sera, though from a small cohort of sera14. However,

249

to our knowledge, all of these findings are based on small cohorts of samples. Here, by

250

analyzing a large cohort of samples, we actually constructed an antibody response landscape of

251

SARS-CoV-2 proteome. This landscape extent our knowledge of the interaction between

252

SARS-CoV-2 and the immune system. However, due to the difficulty of protein preparation,

253

there are still some proteins that are missing on the SARS-CoV-2 proteome microarray, such

254

as ORF8, which has recently been reported to be able to elicit strong antibody response30. Some

255

of these missing proteins will be added when we update the microarray.

256

Comparison of the IgG responses among the antigenic proteins revealed the possibility that

257

the generation of antibodies against the non-structural/accessory proteins are not independent

258

with each other, which means for one patient that positive for one protein tend to has a

259

significant chance to be positive for other proteins. This is expected since these proteins may

260

be simultaneously exposed to or not to the immune system. Interestingly, high correlations were

261

shown between some particular proteins, likely revealing the high associations of these proteins

262

during infection and disease progression. For instance, it is known that RdRp, NSP7 and NSP8

263

form a complex for replication and translation of the viral genome. Correspondingly, high

264

correlations of their elicited antibody responses, particular for NSP8 and RdRp, were observed.

265

We also observed high correlations between NSP2 and NSP16, suggesting the two proteins

266

might associate in vivo.

267

The function of the antibodies to non-structural/accessory proteins are still largely unknown,

268

our results reveal that the antibody levels are more associated with disease severity, particularly

269

with the final outcome. These findings imply that the antibodies against non-

270

structural/accessory proteins may play more important roles, thus worth further and in-depth

271

investigation. One concern about the antibody against S protein is the possible ADE (antibody

272

dependent enhancement)34 which causes uncontrolled release of proinflammatory cytokines,

273

such as IL-1, IL-6, IFN-γ, and TNF-α35,36. Meanwhile, the severity of COVID-19 is highly

274

associated with cytokine release syndrome or cytokine storm36,37. One possible role of these

275

antibodies against the non-structural/accessory proteins might be to trigger production of more

276

cytokines when they bind the released antigens from the infected cells.

277

It is still controversial about the duration of the protective antibodies in patients25,26. Our data

278

reveal that there is no significant decline of IgG antibodies against S or N protein for mild and

279

severe survivors within 60 days after symptom onset. While the IgG antibodies against non-

280

structural/accessory proteins rapidly decline when they reach the plateau about 20 days after

281

symptom onset. This may could be explained by the gradual decline of virus load which is

282

usually detectable around about 20 days after symptom onset38,39. A recently published study

283

identified ORF3b can elicit antibodies and the antibodies can last for two to three months30. In

284

fact, for most of the patients, an obvious trend of decline is observed. The duration of antibody

285

is largely dependent on the type of the corresponding B cells or antibody secreting plasma cells,

286

either long-lived or short lived40,41. The obvious short life time of the antibodies against non8

structural/accessory proteins might due to the suppressed production of long-lived B cells or

288

tend to generate short-lived B cells with unknown mechanism40. It seems that there are two

289

distinct mechanisms through which the proteins of SARS-CoV-2 elicit host humoral immune

290

responses: 1) Viral particle is involved as antigen resource, specifically S and N proteins, which

291

elicit potent antibody responses and tend to generate long-lived B cells. These antibodies

292

mainly play a protective role. 2) The infected cell is involved as antigen resource with non-

293

structural/accessory proteins, which elicit weaker antibody responses and tend to be suppressed

294

to generate long-lived B cells. These antibodies might be stronger to induce cytokines to

295

contribute severer outcomes. However, this hypothesis should be confirmed by further studies.

296

In contrast to the antibody levels of S and N protein are stable for survivors, we observed the

297

overall antibody levels start to decline in non-survivors at about ten days before death. This

298

observation implies the possible protective function of these antibodies in patients, and a

299

collapse of humoral immune might occur for most patients immediately before death. Further

300

studies are needed to confirm this observation with more samples.

301

Taken together, we revealed a comprehensive antibody landscape against SARS-CoV-2

302

proteome. The results were assured by a large cohort of 2,360 COVID-19 sera. Distinct

303

characteristics of the antibodies against non-structural/accessory proteins and structural

304

proteins were shown for the first time, with regard to patterns of antibody responses,

305

associations with severity/outcome, and the dynamic. We strongly believe that the antibody

306

landscape revealed in this study will facilitate a deeper understanding the immunity of SARS-

307

CoV-2, predict the final outcome, may provide potential biomarkers for precise monitoring of

308

COVID-19 progression, and may guide the development of effective vaccines.

Protein microarray fabrication

361

The SARS-CoV-2 proteome microarray used this study is a updated version of the original

362

one14. Three more proteins, i. e., ORF3a, ORF3b and ORF7b, were expressed by ourself and

363

added. The 4th protein, RdRp was provided by H. Eric Xu22. The protein microarray was

364

fabricated as previously described14. Briefly, the proteins with indicated concentrations, along

365

with the negative (GST, Biotin-control and eGFP) and positive controls (Human IgG, Human

366

IgM and ACE2-Fc), were printed in quadruplicate on PATH substrate slide (Grace Bio-Labs,

367

Oregon, USA) to generate identical arrays in a 2× 7 subarray format using Super Marathon

368

printer (Arrayjet, UK). The microarrays were used for serum profiling as described previously

369

with minor modifications19. Protein microarrays were stored at -80°C until use.

371
372

The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College,

373

informed consent was obtained from all participants enrolled in this study. All COVID-19

374

patients were laboratory confirmed and hospitalized during the period from 25 January 2020

375

and 28 April 2020. Sera of the control group from healthy donors, lung cancer patients, patients

376

with autoimmune diseases were collected from Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai, China or Tongren

377

Hospital, Shanghai, China. The negative reference samples were from National Institutes for

378

Food and Drug Control. All the samples were stored at -80°C until use.

379

Microarray-based serum analysis

380

A 14-chamber rubber gasket was mounted onto each slide to create individual chambers for the

381

14 identical subarrays. The microarray was used for serum profiling as described by Li, et al.39

382

with minor modifications. Briefly, the arrays stored at -80°C were warmed to room temperature

383

and then incubated in blocking buffer (3% BSA in 1×PBS buffer with 0.1% Tween 20) for 3 h.

384

Serum samples were diluted 1: 200 in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, added with 0.5 mg/mL-

385

1

386

subarray overnight at 4°C. The arrays were washed with 1 × PBST and the signals were readout

387

by incubating with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-human IgG and Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated

388

donkey anti-human IgM (Jackson ImmunoResearch, PA, USA). These two fluorescent

389

conjugated antibodies were diluted 1: 1,000 in 1 × PBST and incubated at room temperature

390

for 1 h. The microarrays were then washed with 1 × PBST, dried by centrifugation at room

391

temperature, scanned by LuxScan 10K-A (CapitalBio Corporation, Beijing, China) with the

Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China (ITJ-C20200128). Written

parameters set as 95% laser power/ PMT 550 and 95% laser power/ PMT 480 for IgM and IgG,

393

respectively. The fluorescent intensity data was extracted by GenePix Pro 6.0 software

394

(Molecular Devices, CA, USA). A pool of 50 randomly selected patient sera was used as a

395

standard positive control. Block #14 of each slide was incubated with the positive control. Data

396

normalization among slides was performed by a linear method with the data from the positive

397

control. Specifically, a normalization factor for each slide was calculated by a liner regression

398

function of the signals of the positive control of the given slide with the averaged signals of all

399

slides, and then the signals of all the proteins from the slide were divided by the factor.

400

Statistics

401

Signal Intensity was defined as the median of the foreground subtracted by the median of

402

background for each spot and then the quadruplicate spots were averaged for each protein. IgG

403

and IgM data were analyzed separately. Pearson correlation coefficient between two proteins

404

or indicators and the corresponding p-value was calculated by SPSS software under the default

405

parameters. Cluster analysis was performed by pheatmap package of R 42. To calculate the

406

positive rate of antibody response for each protein, mean + 2 x standard deviation (SD) of the

407

control sera were used to set the threshold.

severe (survivors) and severe (non-survivors) patients for S1 (a), N protein (b),
NSP1 (c), NSP7 (d), NSP8 (e), RdRp (f) ORF3b (g) and ORF9b (h). For positive
rate analysis, error bar was given as the 95% confidential interval. P-value was
calculated by two-sided χ2 test. *, P < 0.05, **, P < 0.01, ***, P < 0.001, ****, P <
0.0001, n. s., not significant. For signal intensity analysis, the middle line was
median value; the upper and lower hinges were the values of 75% and 25%
percentile. P- value was calculated by two-sided t test.

The trends of median signal intensities of IgG at different time points for S1 (a) and N
(b), among three sample groups, i. e., non-severe, severe (survivors) and severe (nonsurvivors). Samples were grouped per day and the time points with sample number less
than 4 were excluded due to lack of statistical significance. c-d. Relative S1-IgG signal
levels were calculated for each patient, by dividing the signal intensity of the samples
collected at other time points vs. samples collected at 0-2 days before the death of nonsurvivors (c, n = 35) or the discharge of survivors (d, n = 108). The samples were
grouped per three days. For each patient, the signals were averaged if there were more
than one sample during each three-day. P- value was calculated by two-sided t test
between the indicated group and the first group (0 - 2 days). *, P < 0.05, **, P < 0.01,
