Abstract
Objectives: To assess the causal impact of a spontaneous relaxation of social distancing on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States (U.S.), while controlling for
social mobility and state-imposed social distancing restrictions.
Design: Event study.
Setting: Quasi-experimental setting created by the U.S. nationwide protests precipitated by George Floyd’s tragic death on May 25, 2020.
Population: Individuals in 3,142 U.S. counties from all 50 states and the District of
Columbia.
Main Outcome Measures: The number of daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in all
U.S. counties between the period of January 22, 2020, and June 20, 2020, and the cumulative change in COVID-19 cases in protest counties relative to non-protest counties
following the onset of the protests.
Results: We document a country-wide increase of over 3·06 cases per day, per 100,000
population, following the onset of the protests (95%CI: 2·47–3·65), and a further increase of 1·73 cases per day, per 100,000 population, in the counties in which the protests
took place (95%CI: 0·59–2·87). Relative to the week preceding the onset of the protests,
this represents a 61·2% country-wide increase in COVID-19 cases, and a further 34·6%
increase in the protest counties.
Conclusions: Our study documents a significant increase in COVID-19 case counts in
counties that experienced a protest, and we conclude that social distancing practices
causally impact the spread of SARS-CoV-2. The observed effect cannot be explained
by changes in social distancing restrictions and social mobility, and placebo tests rule
out the possibility that this finding is attributable to chance. Our research informs
policy makers and provides insights regarding the usefulness of social distancing as an
intervention to minimize the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction

The highly contagious novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARSCoV-2), responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan
city, Hubei province, China. 1 The initial COVID-19 outbreak quickly evolved into a pandemic, 2
and as of June 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has reached over 180 countries and regions, with the total
number of confirmed cases surpassing 10 million globally. 3 COVID-19 has spread throughout the
United States (U.S.) at an unparalleled rate, infecting over 2·5 million individuals and claiming over
125,000 lives. 4 Global public health measures aimed at reducing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 have
been designed in consideration of the virus’s specific transmission properties. 5 SARS-CoV-2 can be
transmitted through various modes, including person-to-person contact and the spread of respiratory
droplets, which can travel across a minimum distance of 6 feet (2 meters). 6,7 Numerous countries
have introduced social distancing, defined as the maintenance of at least a 6 foot interpersonal
physical separation, to minimize direct transmission from infected individuals. 8
In the U.S., individual states have been granted the authority to design their own COVIDmitigation strategy, therefore, the extent and type of social distancing policies adopted differs across
states. 9 Research examining state-imposed restrictions has found a reduction in the doubling rate
of SARS-CoV-2 among U.S. states, 10 as well as the daily growth rate of COVID-19 cases across
U.S counties after the imposition of social distancing measures. 11,12 Other research has suggested
that rather than reducing the daily growth rate of COVID-19, social distancing merely stabilizes
the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the U.S. 10 Additionally, when examining the effectiveness of social
distancing, studies have used social mobility as a measure of social distancing. 11,13–15 However,
mobility represents an imperfect proxy for social distancing because individuals can be mobile while
still maintaining the required minimum 6 foot separation from others to prevent viral transmission.
Furthermore, although evidence suggests there is an association between social distancing and the
spread of SARS-CoV-2, the causal impact of social distancing on the spread of SARS-Cov-2 is still
unknown.
In this study, we examine the the causal impact of a spontaneous relaxation of social distancing
measures on the spread of SARS-CoV-2. The nationwide mass protests precipitated by George
Floyd’s tragic death on May 25, 2020 prompted an abrupt relaxation of social distancing practices
across the U.S. The unpredictable nature of the protests created a natural experimental setting
to assess for causality. In this study, instead of using mobility as a proxy for social distancing,

we control for the increase in mobility during the protest period in order to hone in on the direct
effect of social distancing. We also explicitly control for the concurrent relaxation of state-imposed
restrictions to account for variations in social distancing restrictions across states.

Methods

2.1

Data and Sample Description

We source our U.S. COVID-19 data from the John Hopkins GitHub repository. This data consists
of confirmed cases in each county at the end of every day since the start of the outbreak in late
January 2020. We calculate the number of new cases for each county and each day by subtracting
the cumulative number of confirmed cases at the end of the day from the number of cumulative
cases from the previous day. This sampling procedure yields a panel data-set consisting of a total
of 474,422 county-days representing 3,142 counties from all fifty states, as well as the District of
Columbia (DC), for the period starting on January 22, 2020, and ending on June 20, 2020. We
describe our sample in Table I, and in Figure 1 we show the counties in which protests took place
according to media reports, along with the size of the first protest taking place within each county.
We obtain our county-level population data and our county-level demographic data from the U.S.
Census Bureau. We extract our county-level Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data from the U.S.
Bureau of Economic Analysis’ (BEA) Regional Economic Accounts database (Table CAGDP1). We
retrieve county-level data on the prevalence of obesity, diabetes, smoking, and hypertension from the
University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME). The hypertension
and obesity data are for the years 2009 and 2011, respectively, and the diabetes and smoking
prevalence data are for 2012. The IHME reports hypertension and obesity data for females and
males separately, so we construct a population-weighted average measure for these two covariates
based on the proportion of females and males in each county, as reported by the U.S. Census Bureau.
The social distancing restrictions data is from the University of Washington’s State-Level Social
Distancing Policies in Response to the 2019 Novel Coronavirus in the U.S. repository. The social
distancing restrictions include: 1) restrictions on public gatherings exceeding 5, 10, 25, 50, 100,
250, 500, or 1,000 people, 2) limits on restaurant operations, 3) closure of specific businesses, e.g.
fitness centres, gyms, casinos, etc., 4) closure of non-essential businesses, 5) stay-at-home orders
for non-essential activities, 6) state curfews on non-essential activities, 7) mandated quarantines for

people entering the state, 8) travel restrictions prohibiting residents from leaving the state, nonresidents from entering the state, or residents from travelling across counties within the state, 9)
self-isolation requirement for individuals with confirmed COVID-19 infection, and 10) mandatory
wearing of masks or other mouth and nose coverings in public places. We construct our social
distancing restrictions index by adding the number of restrictions that are in place in a state on
any given day, based on the date at which each restriction is enacted, relaxed, or expired. Figure 2
shows the evolution of our index for randomly selected states.
We obtain our mobility data from the Descartes Labs. This data consists of mobility indexes
calculated at the end of every day and aggregated at the county level. The indexes, which we will
refer to as the social mobility index, are based on geolocation reports from smartphones and other
mobile devices, and track the movements of individual mobile phone subscribers. The methodology
employed to construct these indexes is described in Warren et al., 2020. 16 The mobility index data
is available at a daily frequency from March 1, 2020, until the end of our sample period. Thus,
we lose a total of 122,538 county-day observations from the start of our sample period up until
February 29, 2020, in all our regression analyses featuring this data. Figure 3 shows the mobility
index for a randomly selected small and large county in the states of New York and Texas.
Finally, we construct a comprehensive list of protests that took place across the U.S. Our starting
point is the List of George Floyd protests in the United States assembled by Wikipedia. At the time
of writing, the main Wikipedia page cited 134 news articles from national, regional, and local media
outlets, and the secondary pages cited hundreds more. From these media citations, we extracted the
location and the date at which the protests reportedly took place, as well as the estimated number
of individuals involved in each protest. We complement this process with a search on the Dow Jones
Factiva database.

2.2

Regression Specification

We examine the impact of the abrupt relaxation of social distancing practices, which occurred during
the U.S. nationwide protests, on the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate with an Ordinary Least Squares
(OLS) differences-in-differences (DID) panel regression equation, which is specified as follows:
CIi,j,t = β1 P rotesti + β2 P ostGF i,j,t + β3 × P rotesti × P ostGF i,j,t
0
+X0i,j,t δC1 + Yj,t
δC2 + γi + i,j,t ,

where CIi,j,t corresponds to new confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections in county i from state j on day
t, per 100,000 population. P rotesti is an indicator variable which is set equal to one if a protest
took place in county i, and to zero otherwise. P ostGF i,j,t is an indicator variable set equal to zero
from the first day of our sample period up until May 25, 2020, the day of George Floyd’s tragic
death, and to one on every subsequent date. P rotest × P ostGF is an indicator variable which
captures the interaction between P rotesti and P ostGF i,j,t . Xi,j,t and Yj,t are vectors of county and
state characteristics which we use as control variables, and (γi ) represents state-level fixed effects
to control for time-invariant differences across states in our regressions.
In equation (1), β1 captures any differences that may exist between the SARS-CoV-2 infection
rate in protest and non-protest counties, and that are unrelated to the protests. We expect this
coefficient to be statistically indistinguishable from zero. β2 captures the impact of the relaxation
of social distancing practices on the infection rate across all U.S. counties, following the onset of
the protests. β3 captures the incremental impact of the relaxation of social distancing practices
on the infection rate, specifically in counties where protests took place. Under the null hypothesis
that the relaxation of social distancing practices has no causal impact on the SARS-CoV-2 infection
rate, both β2 and β3 coefficients should be statistically indistinguishable from zero. In all our
regressions, we cluster the standard errors at the county level to account for any potential crosssectional dependence in the error terms, i,j,t . 17 We perform our statistical analysis with STATA 16
and use Sergio Correia’s REGHDFE command to estimate equation (1). 18

2.3

Research Setting

Two key requirements for the identification of the causal link between social distancing and the
spread of SARS-CoV-2 are satisfied in our research setting, namely: 1) the existence of a strong
theoretical basis supporting the relationship in question and, 2) exogenous variation in the variable of
interest, i.e social distancing. 19 The latter is key to establish causality, because it mitigates concerns
that omitted variables correlated with both the protests and the spread of SARS-CoV-2 might be
driving our findings. This experimental setting also enables us to circumvent common concerns
about endogeneity and self-selection which besets most non-randomized-trial experiments. 20

2.4

Covariates

In our differences-in-differences regressions, we include control variables which may influence the
transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2. These control variables account for demographic, health, geographic, and income level variations across counties. For demographic indicators, we include male
sex and age (60 years+) since these factors are associated with both an increased risk of testing
positive for SARS-CoV-2 and greater illness severity. 21 We also include ethnicity as a demographic
variable to account for the increased risk of a positive SARS-COV-2 test observed among Blacks and
Hispanics. Obesity, diabetes, and hypertension are clinical risk factors included as health covariates
in the regressions, as they are associated with an increased risk of severe illness, and a greater risk
of mortality from COVID-19. 22 We also include smoking as a clinical risk factor, as some evidence
suggests that smoking may be associated with an increased severity of COVID-19. 23 We include
population density among our control variables, as higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 infections are observed in more densely populated, urban areas. 22,24 Consistent with previous research showing that
residents from more economically deprived areas are more likely to test positive for SARS-COV-2,
we use real GDP per capita to control for income in our regressions. 22

Results
Impact of Protests on SARS-CoV-2 Infections

We report results from regression equation (1) in Table III. In Model (1), the coefficients associated
with P rotest is equal to 1·22 (95%CI: 0·79–1·65) and is highly significant. This implies that, over the
entire sample period, the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate is 1·22 cases per day, per 100,000 population
higher in the counties where protests took place, relative to the counties where no protests took
place. The coefficient associated with P ostGF is positive and highly significant, implying that the
SARS-CoV-2 infection rate increases by 3·39 cases per day, per 100,000 across the U.S. following
the onset of the protests. Finally, the coefficient associated with the P rotest × P ostGF interaction
indicates that the infection rate is even greater in the counties in which protests actually took place,
following the onset of the protests (4·01; 95%CI: 3·24–4·78). To put this number into perspective,
recall that the average number of new cases across all counties is equal to 5 per day, per 100,000
population, in the week preceding the onset of the protests (see Column (2) of Table I). Using this
number as a reference point, COVID-19 cases increase by a further 80·2%, on average, in protest-

counties, relative to non-protest counties, and by 3·39 + 4·01 = 7·40 cases per day, per 100,000
population, or 148% overall. Models (2)-(6) of Table III provide evidence that is consistent with
Model (1). The coefficient associated with P rotest loses its statistical significance in Models (2)
and (6), suggesting that the higher overall infection rate of protest-counties is attributable to crosscounty differences in demography. We note that the coefficient associated with P ostGF is very
stable across the six models, ranging between 3·33 and 3·39. Likewise, the coefficient associated
with our P rotest × P ostGF interaction is quite stable across the six models, ranging between 2·80
in Model (6) and 4·01 in Model (1). Although there is no telling which one of these six models
provides a better description of the causal impact of relaxing social distancing practices on the
spread of SARS-CoV-2, out of conservatism, we will employ our omnibus regression Model (6) from
this point on, referring to this specification as our baseline regression model.
Based on the evidence reported in Table III, we can safely reject the null hypothesis that
relaxing social distancing practices has no impact on the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, as
our placebo tests (Sub-section 3.3) indicate, we can rule out the possibility that this important
finding is attributable to chance with a high degree of confidence.

3.2

Social Distancing Restriction and Mobility

In the period preceding the onset of the protests, the number of new COVID-19 cases began to drop
steadily across the country. 3 Accordingly, several states began to unwind their social distancing
restrictions in a carefully staged manner. Figure (2) illustrates this trend in Alabama, California,
Florida, and New York, for instance. Starting in mid-March, we observe a steady rise in our social
distancing restrictions index in these four states and we observe the start of a slow unwind by
mid-April. Notably, while social distancing restrictions were being relaxed across the nation, social
mobility was on the rise (see Figure 3). Consequently, it may very well be that the concurrent
relaxation of social distancing restrictions and the increase in social mobility during the event
period has prompted individuals to relax their social distancing practices, and that the effect that
we document in Table III is partly contaminated by these contemporaneous changes. We address
this issue in Table IV, where we include our social distancing restrictions and social mobility indexes
in our baseline DID regression equation (1) as additional control variables.
Table IV includes four models. Model (1) corresponds to Model (6) from Table III, Model (2)
includes the additional control for social distancing restrictions, Model (3) includes the additional

control for social mobility, and Model (4) includes both controls. In Model (2), we see a drop
from 3·33 to 3·01 in the coefficient associated with P ostGF , relative to Model (1), but the coefficient
remains highly significant. We observe a similar drop in the coefficient associated with the P rotest×
P ostGF interaction, from 2·80 to 2·29, with no drop in its statistical significance.
In Model (3), controlling for social mobility has a slightly larger impact on the coefficients
associated with P ostGF and P rotest × P ostGF . The first coefficient drops from 3·33 to 2·97,
while the P rotest × P ostGF drops from 2·80 to 1·81. Evidently, social distancing restrictions and
social mobility are correlated with one another. For instance, we should expect social mobility
to rise when travel restrictions are lifted. When we control for both factors in Model (4), the
coefficient associated with P ostGF is equal to 3·06 (95%CI: 2·47–3·65), which is highly significant,
and the coefficient associated with P rotest×P ostGF is equal to 1·73 (95%CI: 0·59–2·87), also highly
significant.
In summary, after controlling for the reduction in social distancing restrictions and the increase
in social mobility that occurred following the onset of the protests, we still observe a significant
increase in the number of daily COVID-19 cases across all counties (61·2% relative to the week
preceding the event), and a further increase of 1·73 cases (34·6%) in the counties where protests
took place. We attribute the latter to the relaxation of social distancing practices during the
protests. This interpretation is supported by the abundance of video footage demonstrating that
the mass protests brought people into close physical proximity to one another, in contravention to
social distancing restrictions that were in place at the time.

3.3

Placebo Test

In Table V, we report the results of a placebo test assessing whether the causal impact of the
protests on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 that we document in Tables III and IV can be attributed to
chance. For this purpose, we implement a Monte Carlo simulation exercise centered on our baseline
DID panel regression specification (1), i.e. Model (4) of Table IV. In this simulation, we pick a
random date between February 6, 2020, and June 1, 2020, to represent the onset of the protests and
we assign counties to the protest group randomly, in proportion to the actual fraction of counties
that took part in the protests (18%). We carry out this exercise 10,000 times, and each time, we
estimate our model with the simulated protest onset date and protest county pair, and collect the
key parameter estimates from the regression, i.e. P rotest, P ostGF , and P rotest × P ostGF , along

with their county-cluster robust t-statistics.
In this simulation, the impact of the random date on the randomly assigned protest counties
on the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate is negligible, on average. Only 25% of the coefficients from
the simulation are positive, and at most 1% of them are statistically significant. Furthermore,
the coefficients associated with P ostGF and P rotest × P ostGF from the actual regressions (Panel
B), i.e. 3·06 and 1·73, are well above the 95% confidence thresholds inferred from the simulated
distribution, i.e. 1·35 and 1·37, respectively. Indeed, our baseline regression coefficients fall at the
very top end of the simulated distribution. This implies that we can safely reject the null hypothesis
that the causal impact of protests on the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate that we document is due to
pure chance, with at least 99% confidence.

Discussion

In this paper, we employ the natural experimental setting created by the U.S. protests precipitated
by George Floyd’s tragic death to document the causal impact of social distancing measures on
the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Using a DID analysis, in which the treatment effect corresponds to
the onset of the protests and the treatment group corresponds to the counties in which protests
reportedly took place, we document a country-wide increase of more than 3·06 cases per day, per
100,000 population, following the onset of the protests, and a further increase of 1·73 cases per day,
per 100,000 population, in the counties in which the protests took place. Relative to the average
number of new COVID-19 cases per day during the week preceding the onset of the protests, this
represents a 61·2% country-wide increase in COVID-19 cases, and further 34·6% increase in the
protest counties.

Strengths and Weaknesses
Early predictive models assessing the effectiveness of social distancing have suggested that a greater
spread of SARS-CoV-2 would occur in the absence of social distancing measures. 25–27 Similarly, our
study demonstrates that when social distancing is reduced, i.e by individuals protesting in close
proximity, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 increases. Our study differs from its predecessors because instead of examining the effectiveness of social distancing measures following their imposition, 11,12,14
we examine the impact of social distancing on the spread of COVID-19 when social distancing
practices are abruptly relaxed. Additionally, unlike previous studies, we do not use mobility as

a measure of social distancing, instead we control for social mobility as a variable in our analyses. By explicitly controlling for the concurrent increase in social mobility and the relaxation of
state-imposed social distancing restrictions during the period surrounding the protests, our study
demonstrates that social distancing directly impacts the spread of SARS-CoV-2. We also control
for a host of covariates known to influence the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and implement placebo
tests to rule out the possibility that our results are attributable to chance. Therefore, we can be
confident that the increase in SARS-CoV-2 infections that we observe following the onset of the
protests can be attributed to the relaxation of social distancing practices.
Our study is not without limitations. In particular, over 70 testing centers across the U.S. were
closed following the onset of the protests. Therefore, the increase in the SARS-CoV-2 infections
that we document likely underestimates the true increase. We are also unable to assess protest
participants’ vulnerability (e.g. age, underlying health conditions, personal protective wear, etc.),
and variability along these dimensions may influence the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Additionally,
we cannot control for the actual degree of physical proximity between participants, which would
impact the transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 during the protests. Moreover, we rely on the accuracy
of media reports to identify the counties in which protests took place. Finally, we do not account
for the magnitude of the protests in each county, however, expressing the case counts in rates rather
than in levels should minimize any potential scale-related effects.

Future Research and Implications
Future research using this experimental setting could use machine learning tools to analyze protest
videos and determine the relative contribution of participant demographics, the degree of physical
distancing, and the extent and type of personal protective wear on the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
Taken together, this study demonstrates that, when controlling for social mobility and restrictions,
social distancing practices causally impact the spread of SARS-CoV-2. As states are in the midst
of relaxing the social distancing restrictions initially imposed in March 2020, establishing the effectiveness of social distancing practices in a statistically reliable way has important public health
implications. Our research informs policy makers and provides insights regarding the usefulness of
social distancing as an intervention to minimize the spread of SARS-CoV-2, and reduce the risk of
a second, and possibly, third wave of COVID-19.

- The effectiveness of social distancing is generally examined using mobility as a proxy for social
distancing
What this study adds
- The causal link between social distancing practices and the spread of SARS-Cov-2 is established
by exploiting a purely exogenous shock, i.e the protests, in a framework that explicitly controls for
social mobility and social distancing restrictions
- Placebo tests rule out the possibility that the causal link documented herein is due to chance

Table III : Impact of Protests on SARS-CoV-2 Infections
This table reports results from our differences-in-differences regression equation (1). In these regressions, the dependent variable
corresponds to the county-level number of new confirmed COVID-19 cases, per day, per 100,000 population. P rotest is an indicator
variable set equal to one in counties where protests reportedly took place, and to zero in counties where no protests took place.
P ostGF is an indicator variable set equal to zero up until George Floyd’s tragic death, and to one on every subsequent date. The
95% confidence intervals reported under the regression coefficients are based on standard errors that are clustered at the county
level. 17

Table IV : Social Distancing Restrictions and Social Mobility
This table evaluates the impact of the concurrent relaxation of state-imposed social distancing restrictions and social mobility on
the causal link between social distancing practices and SARS-CoV-2 infection rate documented in Table III. Model (1) corresponds
to our baseline regression Model (6) from Table III. Model (2) includes our social distancing restrictions index as a supplementary
control variable, Model (3) includes our social mobility index as a supplementary control variable, and Model (4) includes both
supplementary variables. The 95% confidence intervals reported under the regression coefficients are based on standard errors that
are clustered at the county level. 17

Table V : Placebo Tests
This table reports results from a Monte Carlo simulation of the impact of the protests on the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate across
the U.S. This analysis is centered on our baseline differences-in-differences panel regression specification, i.e. Model (4), presented
in Table IV. In this simulation, we estimate our baseline regression model 10,000 times. In each regression, we assign a random
date for the start of the protests, ranging between February 6, 2020, and June 1, 2020, and we assign the counties to the group
of protest participants randomly, in proportion to the actual fraction of counties that took part in the protests (18%). In Panel
A, we report the simulated distribution of the regression model’s key parameter estimates, i.e. P rotest, P ostGF , and P rotest x
P ostGF , along with the distribution of the t-statistics for these coefficients. In Panel B, we report the actual value of the parameter
estimates from Model (6) of Table III to facilitate comparisons. The t-statistics are based on standard errors that are robust to
country-level clusters. 17
