Abstract
Effective therapies for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are urgently needed, and preclinical data
suggest alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonists (⍺1-AR antagonists) may be effective in reducing
mortality related to hyperinflammation independent of etiology. Using a retrospective cohort design
with patients in the Department of Veterans Affairs healthcare system, we use doubly robust regression
and matching to estimate the association between baseline use of ⍺1-AR antagonists and likelihood of
death due to COVID-19 during hospitalization. Having an active prescription for any ⍺1-AR antagonist
(tamsulosin, silodosin, prazosin, terazosin, doxazosin, or alfuzosin) at the time of admission had a
significant negative association with in-hospital mortality (relative risk reduction 18%; odds ratio 0.73;
95% CI 0.63 to 0.85; p ≤ 0.001) and death within 28 days of admission (relative risk reduction 17%;
odds ratio 0.74; 95% CI 0.65 to 0.84; p ≤ 0.001). In a subset of patients on doxazosin specifically, an
inhibitor of all three alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, we observed a relative risk reduction for death of
74% (odds ratio 0.23; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.94; p = 0.028) compared to matched controls not on any ⍺1AR antagonist at the time of admission. These findings suggest that use of ⍺1-AR antagonists may
reduce mortality in COVID-19, supporting the need for randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials
in patients with early symptomatic infection.

Introduction

The viral replication phase in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can be followed by a
hyperinflammatory host immune response, hereafter referred to as COVID-19-associated
hyperinflammation, which can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiorgan
dysfunction, and death despite maximal supportive care (1–4). While dexamethasone and other
immunosuppressive strategies have shown some promise in improving outcomes in patients with
severe COVID-19, they have not shown benefit (and may be detrimental) when given to patients with
less advanced disease (5–7). To date, immunomodulatory therapeutic strategies that prevent the
development of hyperinflammation and thereby halt progression to severe COVID-19 do not exist.
Catecholamines (adrenaline, noradrenaline, and dopamine) are monoamine hormones that signal
through adrenergic receptors (ARs) expressed on tissues including cells of the immune system (8–10).
Cells of the innate and adaptive immune system (phagocytes, lymphocytes) are capable of producing
catecholamines de novo and signal in an autocrine/paracrine self-regulatory fashion (9,11). Beyond
their well-established role in neurotransmission and physiological fight-or-flight responses,
catecholamines have been shown to amplify immune responses and enhance acute inflammatory injury
in vitro and in vivo by increasing cytokine production in immune cells (e.g., IL-6, TNF-⍺, MIP-2)
(8,10–12). In animal models of hyperinflammation, prophylactic treatment with an alpha-1 adrenergic
receptor (⍺1-AR) antagonist that inhibits all three receptor subtypes (⍺1A-, ⍺1D-, and ⍺1B-AR) can
prevent cytokine storm and death by blocking deleterious catecholamine signaling and immune
responses (11). In a retrospective analysis of patients hospitalized with acute respiratory distress,
patients incidentally taking any ⍺1-AR antagonist had a 34% relative risk reduction of being
mechanically ventilated and dying (n=16,801, odds ratio 0.70) compared to non-users (13). Similarly,
the risk of progression to mechanical ventilation and death was significantly reduced in a retrospective
analysis of >300,000 patients hospitalized with pneumonia who were prescribed ⍺1-AR antagonists
prior to their index admission, suggesting that baseline inhibition of catecholamine signaling may
improve clinical outcomes in acute lower respiratory tract infection or inflammation (13). We therefore
hypothesized that early treatment with ⍺1-AR antagonists can improve mortality and ameliorate disease
in patients with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection (14), but data demonstrating the efficacy of ⍺1AR antagonists in COVID-19 specifically is lacking.
The objective of this study was to examine the association of use of ⍺1-AR antagonists with inhospital mortality in patients with COVID-19. Here, we analyzed a large cohort of patients hospitalized
at Veterans Health Administration (VA) hospitals, in whom ⍺1-AR antagonists are commonly used to
treat unrelated diseases such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), post-traumatic stress disorder
(PTSD), or arterial hypertension (15). We hypothesized that patients with COVID-19 taking ⍺1-AR
antagonists at the time of hospital admission would be less likely to die during their hospitalization.

Methods

2.1

Study Population & Variables

We included all patients admitted to a VA hospital between February 20, 2020, and October 7,
2020 with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis (Figure 1). Diagnosis codes for COVID-19 were
identified from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) coding guidelines for COVID19 (16,17). The VA COVID-19 Shared Data Resource was used to identify VA patients with a SARSCoV-2 laboratory test result (18). This data resource combines VA-specific lab results with non-VA
lab results using text extraction from patient medical records. Because over 90% of ⍺1-AR antagonist
users in the analysis were older men, we excluded women to reduce unmeasured confounding unrelated

to COVID-19, specifically with respect to respiratory conditions. We also excluded patients under age
45 and patients over age 85 given the strong relationship between the severity of COVID-19 and age.
An expanded sample included all patients with laboratory-confirmed, “suspected positive”, or
“possible positive” COVID-19 according to National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) criteria
(19). This Suspected COVID-19 sample excluded patients who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. To
the extent we can measure COVID-19 severity at time of admission, we find that this cohort was not
operationally different from the main cohort based on vital signs at time of admission (Supplementary
Figure 1).
The primary outcomes were death during the index hospitalization and death within 28 days of
admission. The primary exposure variable was the use of ⍺1-AR antagonists at the time of admission
for the index hospitalization. Active prescriptions of ⍺1-AR antagonists (tamsulosin, silodosin,
prazosin, doxazosin, alfuzosin, and terazosin) were identified and defined by the patient having
medication on hand on the day of the index admission, regardless of dosage. Secondary analyses
examined the effect of tamsulosin (the most commonly prescribed ⍺1-AR antagonist with selective
antagonism on ⍺1A- and ⍺1D-, but not ⍺1B-ARs) and doxazosin (a nonselective antagonist acting on all
three ⍺1-ARs) individually. Finally, with in-hospital therapies evolving during the pandemic, we
repeated the analysis by week and VA hospital to ensure results were not driven by any particular time
or location.
We obtained data on patient demographics, vital signs, and prescription drugs from the VA’s
corporate data warehouse (CDW). Patient comorbidities were captured based on the International
Classification of Diseases, Version 10 codes from VA care in the year prior to index admission. Other
physiologic variables, including oxygen saturation and temperature, were defined at time of inpatient
admission.
2.2

Analysis

Analyses followed the methodology of a companion paper examining patients with acute
respiratory distress and pneumonia (13). Unadjusted analysis compared patients with ⍺1-AR antagonist
prescriptions to all other patients with COVID-19 using Fisher’s exact test. We then estimated
propensity scores and trimmed the sample to ensure overlap in the propensity score distributions of the
exposed and unexposed groups. On this reduced sample, the adjusted analysis used inverse propensityweighted logistic regression adjusting for patient age at admission (input as a demeaned cubic
polynomial to allow a nonlinear relationship), calendar week, location of hospitalization, and
comorbidities diagnosed any time in the two years prior to the index inpatient stay. This approach is
“doubly robust” in that it uses the observed confounders in both the calculation of the propensity score
and the odds ratios. Comorbidities included in the matching procedure were diabetes mellitus, arterial
hypertension, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, acute myocardial infarction, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and PTSD. We also included an indicator
variable for oxygen saturation under 94 percent on the day of admission.
All of the control variables reflect information on patients prior to admission with COVID-19.
As noted above, we controlled for secular changes in COVID-19 care using calendar week, starting
with February 20, 2020. We chose not to examine endpoints during the hospital stay, such as use of a
ventilator or admission to the ICU, given this is based on physician coding or data structures that we
cannot assure were handled uniformly, especially during surges. We also chose not to control for
processes of care during the stay given this could introduce bias in the analysis.

We then conducted a 5:1 matched analysis using the same covariates as the adjusted model (10).
This approach assigns each exposed patient to a set of five unexposed patients most similar on observed
characteristics and does not make assumptions about the functional form of the potential relationship
between confounders and the outcome. Matches were selected using a greedy, nearest-neighbor
approach based on Mahalanobis distance (11). The matched analysis used the Cochran-MantelHaenszel test to obtain odds ratios, confidence intervals, and p-values. We also present relative risk
reductions (RRR) for the matched cohorts, and the pre- and post-matching balance of covariates is
shown in Figure 3.

Results

3.1

Sample Characteristics

The sample contained 25,130 patients with COVID-19, with 5,600 patients taking any ⍺1-AR
antagonist at time of admission. Of those taking ⍺1-AR antagonists, 73% of patients were on tamsulosin
(n=4,078), 12% on terazosin (n=679), 10% on prazosin (n=581), 4% on doxazosin (n=215), 3% on
alfuzosin (n=186), and less than 1% were on silodosin (n=5) (Figure 1). 177 patients had active
prescriptions for more than one ⍺1-AR antagonist at the time of admission. Demographic
characteristics, medical comorbidities, and Charlson Comorbidity Index for patient groups prior to
matching is shown in Table 1. The differences in sample characteristics after matching are summarized
in Figure 3.
3.2

Risk of In-Hospital and 28-Day Mortality

For all patients admitted to VA hospitals between February 20, 2020, and October 7, 2020, the
overall in-hospital mortality rate was 2.5%. Among hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19
(8.9% of all admissions), in-hospital mortality was 6% overall and 5.5% in our sample. Patients with
confirmed COVID-19 taking any ⍺1-AR antagonist, compared to non-users, had an 18% relative risk
reduction for death during their hospitalization (243/5,309=4.6% in matched treatment group vs.
984/17,538=5.6% in matched control group, p ≤ 0.001, Figure 2) and a 17% relative risk reduction for
death within 28 days from the date of admission (331/5,309=6.2% in matched treatment group vs.
1,318/17,538=7.5% in matched control group, p ≤ 0.001, Figure 2).
The top panel of Figure 2 shows the unadjusted, propensity score adjusted, and matched odds
ratios among patients diagnosed with COVID-19 (n=25,130). The bottom panel expands the
denominator to also include patients with suspected COVID-19 (n=32,016). The dark green odds ratios
in Figure 2 represent all ⍺1-AR antagonists, while the lighter green represent doxazosin. Results were
similar for the suspected COVID-19 sample. Patients taking any ⍺1-AR antagonists, compared to nonusers, had an 20% relative risk reduction for death (p ≤ 0.001) in this cohort (Figure 2).
The use of doxazosin, a nonselective ⍺1-AR antagonist targeting all three ⍺1-AR subtypes,
resulted in a 74% relative risk reduction for death in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 during the
index admission (2/155=1.3% in matched treatment group vs. 39/775=5.0% in matched control group,
odds ratio for death 0.23; p=0.028, Figure 2). Use of tamsulosin, the most commonly prescribed ⍺1AR antagonist in this cohort with selectivity for ⍺1A- and ⍺1D-ARs, was associated with a 18% relative
risk reduction for death during the inpatient stay (odds ratio for death 0.77; p=0.002, Supplementary
Figure 2). Even though COVID-19 has affected different parts of the United States at different times,
we found no evidence that these results were driven by any particular time period or location
(Supplementary Figures 3 and 4).

Discussion

In this retrospective analysis of patients with COVID-19, we found a significant negative
association between the use of ⍺1-AR antagonists and in-hospital or 28-day mortality. These results
are consistent with findings from a recent retrospective study of >300,000 patients hospitalized with
pneumonia or ARDS unrelated to SARS-CoV-2 infection that identified a significant risk reduction
for the progression to mechanical ventilation and death in individuals who were receiving any ⍺1-AR
antagonists as compared to non-users (5), suggesting that the benefits of ⍺1-AR inhibition for mortality
may be independent of etiology in patients with lower respiratory tract infection or inflammation.
Interestingly, we found much larger effect sizes in reducing mortality for patients treated with
doxazosin, an antagonist on all three ⍺1-AR subtypes (⍺1A-, ⍺1D-, and ⍺1B-AR), than for a pooled
population of patients treated with any ⍺1-AR antagonist in whom tamsulosin was the most common
drug (72%). This was similarly true for patients treated exclusively with tamsulosin, a “uroselective”
⍺1-AR antagonist on ⍺1A- and ⍺1D-ARs without clinically relevant inhibition of ⍺1B-ARs expressed by
immune cells and the peripheral vasculature (20). In patients with test-confirmed COVID-19, baseline
use of doxazosin was associated with significantly reduced in-hospital and 28-day mortality compared
to controls (odds ratio for death during admission 0.19 in adjusted cohort; odds ratio and relative risk
reduction for death 0.23 and 74% in matched cohort, respectively). Baseline use of tamsulosin in
patients with confirmed COVID-19, by comparison, was associated with significant, but less
pronounced reductions in mortality. A similar trend was previously observed in patients with
pneumonia in whom use of doxazosin was associated with lower risk of mechanical ventilation and
death than tamsulosin (13). These observed differences in effect size are biologically plausible and
may reflect the distinct pharmacological selectivity of doxazosin and tamsulosin for ⍺1-AR subtypes.
Immune cells can induce expression of all three ⍺1-AR subtypes (i.e., ⍺1A-, ⍺1D-, and ⍺1B-ARs
(21), and catecholamine signaling through these individual receptors may be highly redundant (12).
As such, ⍺1-AR antagonists acting on all three receptor subtypes (i.e., doxazosin, prazosin, alfuzosin,
terazosin) may be required to effectively interrupt autocrine and paracrine catecholamine signaling in
monocytes and other immune cells that enhance inflammatory injury (14,20). Indeed, preclinical data
suggests that nonselective ⍺1-AR antagonists are effective in preventing hyperinflammation and death
in animal models of cytokine storm syndrome (11). The markedly improved survival in patients on
doxazosin as compared to tamsulosin or any ⍺1-AR antagonist (a cohort highly enriched in tamsulosin
use) may therefore be consistent with a redundancy in catecholamine signaling pathways which are
globally inhibited by doxazosin, whereas tamsulosin allows for continued signaling through the ⍺1BAR. These findings have practical implications for the selection of ⍺1-AR antagonists for the
prevention of inflammatory injury and suggest that the immunomodulatory benefits may not be
uncoupled from inhibition of ⍺1B-ARs expressed on the peripheral vasculature.
Additional studies have explored the efficacy of ⍺1-AR blockade in the prevention of
inflammatory and autoimmune injury. In a model of encephalitis, early ⍺1-AR inhibition reversed
neutrophil infiltration in lungs and prevented hemorrhagic pulmonary edema (22). The non-selective
⍺1-AR antagonist prazosin has been shown to ameliorate experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis
(23). In a preclinical model of ischemia-reperfusion injury, prazosin administration resulted in
decreased expression of IL-6, TNF-α, IL-10, and IL-1, and prevented mortality (24). Finally, ⍺1-AR
antagonism has been shown to block cytokine production in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells
from patients with juvenile polyarticular arthritis, and treatment with doxazosin abrogated
catecholamine-augmented secretion of IL-6 (25). These studies suggest a role of catecholamine-

associated augmentation of injurious cytokine responses beyond cytokine release syndrome and acute
lung infection and highlights the potential of ⍺1-AR antagonists across various inflammatory diseases.
One concern with observational analysis is confounding by indication, especially if medications
given during a hospital stay are correlated with disease severity. To avoid confounding by indication,
this analysis examined the use of ⍺1-AR antagonists prior to index hospitalization. This class of
medications is primarily used to manage chronic diseases such as arterial hypertension, PTSD, or BPH.
As such, prescribing practices would not be biased by the severity of COVID-19. In addition, our
results were not driven by a specific location or time period.
This study has important strengths and weaknesses. We have focused on mortality as a definitive
clinical outcome, thereby avoiding process measures, such as use of mechanical ventilators or
admission to an ICU, that are subject to local and individual practice patterns and would be biased if
clinicians or hospitals changed their practices in unobserved ways. Another strength is our use of
information prior to the COVID-19 admission for risk adjustment. One limitation in this study was the
exclusion of women which was required due to limitations in samples size since ⍺1-AR antagonists are
most commonly used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia and 90% of patients in the VA system are
men (26). A second limitation, best addressed in prospective clinical trials, was our inability to examine
dose effects given our sample size.
Our results suggest that inhibition of catecholamine signaling with doxazosin (and other ⍺1-AR
antagonists) may reduce in-hospital and 28-day mortality in patients with COVID-19 and highlight the
need for randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials to examine the efficacy of ⍺1-AR antagonists for
improving survival and preventing adverse outcomes from COVID-19. Importantly, ⍺1-AR antagonists
are inexpensive, administered orally, do not require refrigeration, and have a well-established safety
profile. Thus, if trials confirm these results, ⍺1-AR antagonists could be widely deployed to reduce
mortality from inflammatory injury. Importantly, ⍺1-AR antagonists are immunomodulatory, but not
immunosuppressive drugs. Long-term use of doxazosin does not appear to be associated with the
development of opportunistic infection in human studies (27). Indeed, some studies suggest an overall
decreased risk of urinary tract infection compared to placebo as may be expected based on its effect on
dynamic prostate and bladder function (28). The absence of serious infectious complications may be
explained by the unique mechanism of action of ⍺1-AR antagonists compared to immunosuppressive
drugs currently employed in the treatment of severe COVID-19 (e.g., dexamethasone, baricitinib,
tocilizumab) which confer an increased risk of opportunistic infection.
In summary, patients hospitalized with COVID-19 had lower odds of in-hospital and 28-day
death if they had an active prescription for any ⍺1-AR antagonist (tamsulosin, silodosin, prazosin,
terazosin, doxazosin, or alfuzosin) at the time of admission. Among different ⍺1-AR antagonists,
doxazosin was associated with a 74% relative risk reduction for death, while tamsulosin had a more
modest 18% relative risk reduction for death. A clinical trial testing the efficacy and safety of ⍺1-AR
antagonists such as doxazosin to prevent hyperinflammation and reduce mortality in COVID-19 would
appear warranted.

Figure 2: The Association Between Alpha-1 Adrenergic Receptor Antagonists and In-Hospital
and 28-Day Mortality from COVID-19

Data are shown for hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 (top panel) and with confirmed
plus suspected COVID-19 (e.g., no confirmatory testing available, bottom panel). Forest plots show
the odds ratios (OR) for in-hospital mortality based on prior use of any ⍺1-AR antagonists (i.e.,
tamsulosin, silodosin, prazosin, terazosin, doxazosin, or alfuzosin; dark green) or only doxazosin (light
green) in each panel. Unadjusted (square), adjusted model (triangle), and matched model (circle)
analyses are shown for each sample group. Filled symbols reflect the odds of death within 28 days
from index hospital admission (including deaths after discharge), whereas empty symbols reflect odds
of death during the index admission. Relative risk reduction (RRR), odds ratios (ORs) for death, 95%
confidence intervals (CI), p-values, and sample size (n) for each analysis are shown on the right.
