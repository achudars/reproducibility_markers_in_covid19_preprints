Abstract
The newly identified coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),
causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and has affected over 25 million people worldwide as
of 31 August 2020. To aid in the development of diagnostic kits for rapid and sensitive detection of
the virus, we evaluated a combination of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and isothermal nucleic
acid amplification techniques. Here, we compared conventional PCR and loop-mediated isothermal
amplification (LAMP) methods with hybrid techniques such as polymerase chain displacement
reaction (PCDR) and a newly developed PCR-LAMP method. We found that the hybrid methods
demonstrated higher sensitivity and assay reaction rates than those of the classic LAMP and PCR

modern hybrid amplification techniques markedly improve virus detection and, therefore, can be
extremely useful in the development of new diagnostic kits.

Introduction
The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic started in late December 2019, in Wuhan, China (Jiang and Shi, 2020;
Wu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). By August 31, 2020, over 25 million cases of SARS-CoV-2
infection have been confirmed worldwide, with a death toll over 0.8 million. One key aspect of a safe
transition from lockdown is the ability to continuously test the population for the presence of SARSCoV-2 and hence, COVID-19 infected individuals. Nucleic acid testing is the primary method for
COVID-19 diagnosis. The SARS-CoV-2 virion contains a single-stranded positive-sense RNA
genome, 30,000 nucleotides in length (Zhou et al., 2020). Thus, testing involves the reverse
transcription (RT) of SARS-CoV-2 RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA), followed by
amplification of targeted regions of the cDNA. Currently, standard molecular techniques for the
detection of the virus are quantitative RT polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) (Bruce et al., 2020;
Chu et al., 2020; Corman et al., 2020; Garafutdinov et al., 2020; Gray et al., 2020; Yip et al., 2020;
Zhu et al., 2020) and RT loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) (Ben-Assa et al., 2020;
Butler et al., 2020; Garafutdinov et al., 2020; Gray et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020).
RT-LAMP and RT-qPCR can be performed in either a one-step or two-step assay. In the one-step
assay, RT and cDNA amplification processes are consolidated into one reaction. This assay format
can provide rapid and reproducible results for high-throughput analysis. The challenge of the
combined reaction process is the difficulty in optimizing the RT and amplification steps as they occur
simultaneously, thereby leading to lower target amplicon generation. In the two-step assay, the
reaction is carried out sequentially in separate tubes. This assay format is more sensitive than the onestep assay, but it is more time- and labor-consuming and requires optimization of additional
parameters. Since the release of the SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence, many RT-qPCR and RTLAMP assays have been developed and used for the confirmation of many cases of SARS-CoV-2
infection during the course of the pandemic (Garafutdinov et al., 2020; Udugama et al., 2020).
RT-qPCR is the “gold standard” for molecular diagnostic assays and the method predominantly
employed for diagnosing COVID-19 using respiratory tract samples (Garafutdinov et al., 2020;

Udugama et al., 2020). It is a robust technique that reliably detects 30 – 50 copies of SARS-CoV-2
RNA molecules (Bruce et al., 2020; Gray et al., 2020) or less (Corman et al., 2020). However, RTqPCR is a relatively time-consuming technique, requiring approximately 1.5–2 h.
RT-LAMP is an isothermal technique that provides a good alternative to PCR-based amplification
assays. LAMP was first described in 2000 (Notomi et al., 2000). It uses a strand-displacing DNA
polymerase, four or six primers, and provides a very fast and specific amplification of target DNA or
cDNA at a constant temperature. One of the key advantages of using LAMP-based tests to detect
infectious agents is the short duration of the assay (about 30–45 min for the DNA amplification
stage). During the COVID-19 pandemic, rapid diagnostic assays such as RT-LAMP have become
extremely important for high-throughput screening of patients. However, in several studies
describing experiments on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA molecules, RT-LAMP assays
demonstrated less sensitivity than corresponding RT-qPCR tests, consistently detecting only 400 500 copies of RNA, with sporadic detection of as little as 120 copies (Gray et al., 2020; Zhang et al.,
2020). Furthermore, RT-LAMP can generate false negative results up to 20% for patients with low
viral loads testing positive by RT-qPCR (Ben-Assa et al., 2020; Butler et al., 2020).
Polymerase chain displacement reaction (PCDR) (Harris et al., 2013; Ignatov et al., 2014) and the
newly developed PCR-LAMP technique (described below) are hybrid methods combining PCRbased thermocycling nucleic acid amplification with isothermal amplification. PCDR is a hybrid
technique of PCR with strand displacement amplification (SDA). PCR-LAMP combines a PCR-like
thermocycling mode at the initial stage of amplification with an isothermal LAMP mode during the
following stage. The hybrid methods combine both the high sensitivity of PCR and the fast assay rate
of isothermal amplification. In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of applying the hybrid
techniques of PCR thermocycling with SDA and LAMP isothermal amplification in the detection of
SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA.

Results

2.1

RT-qPCDR vs. RT-qPCR

The sensitivity of the RT-qPCDR and RT-qPCR techniques in detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA was
evaluated using the two-step assay in which the RT and cDNA amplification steps were performed in
two separate reactions. SD DNA polymerase used to amplify the cDNA is a thermostable Taq DNA
polymerase mutant that has strong 5'–3' strand displacement and 5'–3' polymerase activities. This
polymerase is suitable for PCR, PCDR, and isothermal DNA amplifications (Wang et al., 2018;
Shchit et al., 2017; Ignatov et al., 2014; Smith, 2017; Alyethodi et al., 2018; Lou et al., 2018). The
mixes for performing either qPCR or qPCDR were identical, except for two extra outer primers
added in case of qPCDR. RT-qPCDR yielded better Cq values (‒∆Cq approximately 5–7 cycles) and
at least a ten-fold improvement in sensitivity than that of RT-qPCR (Figure 1 and Table 1). Under the
experimental conditions, the qPCDR-based test detected as few as 5 copies of SARS-CoV-2 cDNA
in less than 40 cycles. In contrast, the qPCR-based test provided consistent detection only at 50
copies of viral cDNA per reaction in 38–40 cycles.
2.2

RT-q(PCR-LAMP) vs. RT-qLAMP

The standard RT-qLAMP and hybrid RT-q(PCR-LAMP) reactions were performed in a one-step
assay, where RT and cDNA amplification were carried out in the reaction mixture containing both

Reverase reverse-transcriptase and SD DNA polymerase. The standard RT-qLAMP assay was able to
detect only 500 copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA per reaction (Fig. 2 and Table 2). In contrast, the RTq(PCR-LAMP) test provided consistent detection at levels as low as 5 copies per reaction (lower
titers were not tested). Increasing the number of PCR cycles up to six before LAMP improved the
assay results, but additional cycles beyond six did not provide any additional benefit (data not
shown).

Discussion
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the availability of rapid diagnostic assays is extremely important
for high-throughput screening of individuals. For the fast and sensitive detection of a target nucleic
acid, we offer a new approach for DNA amplification, combining PCR and isothermal amplification
techniques in one assay.
PCDR is the first method of DNA amplification, which combines PCR and isothermal amplification
technique, was described in 2013. It is a hybrid of PCR and isothermal SDA. The technique requires
heat denaturation of dsDNA, as in conventional PCR, as well as the strand displacement activity of
DNA polymerase, as in SDA. In PCDR, at least four primers are employed and amplification is
initiated simultaneously from the outer primers and the inner primers. By using a DNA polymerase
with the strand displacement activity, the inner DNA strands are displaced during DNA synthesis
from the outer primers and can be used as additional template strands for DNA amplification. As a
result, PCDR enhances DNA amplification more than two-times per cycle as compared with the
standard two-primer PCR. The mechanism and kinetics of PCDR amplification have been described
previously (Ignatov et al., 2014).We used RT-qPCDR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. The use of
qPCDR allowed us to detect as few as 5 copies of SARS-CoV-2 cDNA in the reaction in less than 40
cycles, which took about 45–50 min. Under similar conditions, conventional qPCR was able to detect
only 50 copies of cDNA. Thus, in agreement with earlier described findings (Wang et al., 2018;
Harris et al., 2013; Ignatov et al., 2014; Lou et al., 2018), the PCDR-based assay demonstrated higher
efficiency and at least a ten-fold increased sensitivity than that of the PCR-based assay (Fig.1 and
Table 1).
LAMP is a fast and specific isothermal method for DNA amplification. Unfortunately, the use of
LAMP for SARS-CoV-2 detection provides robust detection of the virus only if a few hundred (or

more) copies of viral RNA are present in the reaction assay (Gray et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020).
Lower amounts of viral RNA generate a large proportion of false negative results (Ben-Assa et al.,
2020); thus, the improvement of assay sensitivity is very important. In an attempt to improve
sensitivity, we combined LAMP and PCR and added several PCR cycles before the isothermal
amplification. Our hypothesis was that in the case of a low amount of cDNA, the additional PCR
cycles would provide amplification of the starting material to the level of DNA copies, which would
be sufficient to ensure the start of LAMP. For example, 6 PCR cycles can amplify 5 copies of a target
DNA up to 320 copies, which is sufficient for the fast and specific initiation of LAMP.
The results of the RT-qLAMP and RT-q(PCR-LAMP) assays (Figure 2 and Table 2) demonstrated
that RT-q(PCR-LAMP) was approximately 100-fold more sensitive than conventional RT-qLAMP.
The use of RT-q(PCR-LAMP) allowed us to detect as few as 5 copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA per
reaction and required only 35 min for the amplification step, including 6 cycles of PCR.
In conclusion, the hybrid methods of DNA amplification combined with PCR and isothermal
amplification, such as PCDR and PCR-LAMP, allowed us to markedly improve the results of SARSCoV-2 detection in comparison with conventional PCR and LAMP assays. The hybrid methods
reduced the testing time and/or increased the sensitivity against standard amplification methods. The
described RT-qPCDR and RT-q(PCR-LAMP) methods are fast and very sensitive and can be used
for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection.

Figures

Figure 1. Comparison of two-step RT-qPCR and RT-qPCDR assays.
After reverse transcription (RT) of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, the generated cDNA was detected by qPCR
(A) or qPCDR (B). The quantitative real-time reaction assays contained 5000, 500, 50, or 5 copies of
cDNA per reaction, or a no template control (NTC). RT-qPCDR provided better sensitivity in the
assay than RT-qPCR. All curves reflect the mean relative fluorescence units (RFU) of three replicate
reactions.

Figure 2. Comparison of one-step RT-qLAMP and RT-q(PCR-LAMP) assays.
The reaction assays contained 5000, 500, 50, or 5 copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA molecules, or a no
template control (NTC). Negative control reactions contained 50 ng of human total RNA. The
detection of viral RNA was performed by RT-qLAMP (A) and RT-q(PCR-LAMP) (B–E) assays. The
RT-q(PCR-LAMP) assays were carried out with one (B), two (C), four (D), and six (E) PCR cycles
before the LAMP isothermal amplification step, and provided better sensitivity than the RT-qLAMP
assay. The figure shows the amplification reaction time. Time “zero” on the x-axis is the start of the
isothermal (LAMP) amplification step. The time required for PCR cycling is highlighted by the gray
color at the start of the timeline. All curves are the mean relative fluorescence units RFU of three
replicate reactions.
