Abstract
Although cancer has been associated with COVID-19 risk and mortality in

hospital-based studies, few population-based studies have been reported. Utilizing

data from the UK Biobank (UKB), a population-based prospective cohort, we

formally tested the association of over 44 different types of cancer with COVID-19

infection and mortality among 7,661 subjects who were tested by June 17, 2020.

Compared to non-cancer subjects, cancer subjects (N=1,521) had significantly lower

overall risk for COVID-19 infection [odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval

(CI): 0.79 (0.68-0.92),

P=2.60E-03]. However, a trend of higher risk for COVID-19

mortality was found among 256 COVID-19 positive cancer patients, especially for

hematologic cancers such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma [3.82 (1.17-12.01),

P=0.02]. In

cancer patients, while few demographic, lifestyle, genetic and comorbidity factors

predicted risk for COVID-19 infection, older age, male sex, heart disease and

hypertension significantly predicted COVID-19 mortality. The lower risk for COVID-

19 infection is likely due to extra caution in COVID-19 prevention and more testing

among cancer patients, an encouraging finding that demonstrates the feasibility of

intervention. These results, if confirmed in future releases of UKB data and other

independent populations, may provide guidance for COVID-19 prevention and

treatment among cancer patients.

Introduction
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a global pandemic. Based on

the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center on July 7, 2020, 11,662,574

confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide were reported.[1] In the United Kingdom

(UK), 287,291 cases and 44,321 deaths from COVID-19 were documented.

A number of risk factors and pre-existing comorbid conditions such as

cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, hypertension and

cancer have been associated with risk for COVID-19 infection and severity.[2-4]

Specifically, several studies on the characteristics of COVID-19 among cancer

patients were reported. In a prospective observational study from 55 cancer centers

in the UK, COVID-19 mortality in cancer patients was associated with age, gender,

and comorbidities.[5] A study based on the COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium

(CCC19) from the United States, Canada and Spain reported a high mortality rate

among patients with both cancer and COVID-19, with mortality being associated

with general and cancer-specific risk factors.[6] A higher percentage of severe

COVID-19 patients, including those hospitalized, who required mechanical

ventilation and died within 30 days, was reported in a study at Memorial Sloan

Kettering Cancer Center.[7] However, to date, these reported studies on cancer and

COVID-19 are all hospital-based. As such, it is yet unknown whether cancer patients

in the general population have higher risk and mortality for COVID-19 compared to

individuals without cancer.

The goal of this study was to compare COVID-19 risk and mortality between

subjects with and without a cancer diagnosis in the UK Biobank (UKB), a large

population-based cohort in the UK. Furthermore, leveraging the comprehensive

data on demographics, genetics, lifestyle, and disease phenotypes in the UKB, we

performed additional analyses to compare the impact of candidate risk factors and

comorbid conditions on COVID-19 positivity and mortality in subjects with and

without cancer.

Methods
The UKB is a population-based study biorepository for approximately

500,000 individuals aged 40-69 at recruitment in 2006-2010 from across the UK.[8]

Extensive phenotypic and health-related information is available for each

participant, including questionnaire, biological measurements, lifestyle indicators,

and biomarkers in blood and urine. Follow-up information is provided by linking

health and medical records. Cancer status, related comorbidities (chronic

respiratory diseases, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, stroke), and risk factors can be

obtained through the International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10) codes,

cancer registry, death registry, and self-report. More than 44 types of cancer were

recorded in UKB.

COVID-19 test results for the UKB participants are provided by Public Health

England (for participants resident in England). This information is updated weekly.

Additional COVID-19 data is also collected through a) general practitioner (primary

care) data, b) hospital inpatient data, c) death data, and d) critical care data (for

COVID-19 positive patients), which are updated monthly.

UK Biobank Axiom SNP array data is available for all subjects. Blood type

(ABO) were inferred from the genotypes of rs8176746 and rs8176719, and

APOE

alleles were inferred from the genotype of rs7412 and rs429358 (ε2=T/T, ε3=C/T

and ε4=C/C).[9]

Association tests were performed using univariate and multivariable

(adjusting for age and gender) logistic regression. Differences in variables between

groups were tested using t-test (for continuous variables) and Chi-square test (for

categorical variables) or the Fisher’s exact test when the numbers are small

(expected frequencies <5). Statistical analyses were performed by R v3.5.2, and two-

tailed

P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

By June 17, 2020, COVID-19 test results were available for 7,661 subjects,

approximately 1.5% of UKB subjects. Among these subjects, 1,521 had a diagnosis

for one or more of 44 different types of cancer. Subjects with cancer had

significantly older mean age (61.58) than non-cancer subjects (56.99),

P<0.0001.

Cancer patients also had a significantly higher proportion of males (54.11%) than

non-cancer subjects (47.92%),

P<0.0001.

Among all subjects, 1,562 (20.39%) tested positive for COVID-19, of which,

Table 1

206 (13.19%) died (

). The COVID-19 positive rate was lower among cancer

patients (16.83%) than non-cancer subjects (21.27%). Compared to non-cancer

subjects, cancer patients were significantly associated with lower positive rates for

COVID-19 in both univariate analysis [OR= 0.75 (0.65-0.87),

P=1.24E-04] and

multivariable analysis adjusting for age and gender [OR=0.79 (0.68-0.92),

P=2.60E-

03]. For mortality among subjects positive for COVID-19, however, the rate was

higher in cancer patients (17.97%) than non-cancer subjects (12.25%). Compared

to non-cancer subjects, cancer patients were significantly associated with higher

COVID-19 mortality in the univariate analysis [OR=1.57 (1.09-2.23),

P=0.01], but the

association diminished after adjusting for age and gender [OR=1.04 (0.71-1.51),

P=0.83].
When examining specific types of cancer, a lower COVID-19 positive rate was

found for the vast majority of cancers in various organ systems including digestive,

skin, breast, female genital, male genital, urinary track, brain/central nervous

system, and hematological tissues. However, higher COVID-19 positive rates were

found among those with cancer in the respiratory/intrathoracic organs,

bone/articular cartilage, and thyroid and other endocrine glands, although the

differences were not statistically significant.

Among COVID-19 positive patients, significantly higher COVID-19 mortality

was found for patients with many types of cancer in the univariate analyses. Most of

Table 1

these associations attenuated in multivariable analysis (

). However,

significantly higher COVID-19 mortality was found for several types of hematologic

cancers in multivariable analyses adjusting for age and gender. For example, for

non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (ICD-10 codes C82, C83, C85) patients, the odds for

COVID-19 mortality was significantly higher [OR=3.82 (1.17-12.01),

P=0.02] than

non-cancer patients.

Finally, we tested the association between candidate predictors

(demographic, lifestyle, genetic and comorbidity) with COVID-19 positivity and

Table 2

mortality separately in cancer and non-cancer patients (

). Several

observations were noted. First, among cancer patients, few predictors except for

minority race were significantly associated with a higher positivity rate. In contrast,

among the cancer patients who were positive for COVID-19, multiple predictors

including older age, male sex, and comorbidities such as heart diseases and

hypertension were significantly associated with COVID-19 death. Higher mortality

risk was also associated with two other comorbidities (obesity and diabetes),

although not statistically significant. Second, candidate genetic predictors (ABO

blood type and

APOE) were not significantly associated with COVID-19 positivity

and mortality, although a modest association between the homozygous

APOE ε4

allele and COVID-19 positivity/mortality was found. Third, the above two

observations were not unique to cancer patients and were also found in non-cancer

patients, although there were more statistically significant associations due to larger

sample size. For example, multiple comorbidities were associated with COVID-19

mortality but not positivity.

Discussion
Several important findings were obtained in this first population-based and

observational study that formally assessed the association of cancer with COVID-19

infection and mortality. The first finding that cancer patients had an overall

significantly lower infection rate of COVID-19 than non-cancer subjects is novel. It

appears contrary to the hypothesis of systemic immunosuppressive state in cancer

patients caused by the malignancy and anticancer treatments.[10] However, the

finding is not unexpected for this type of observational study due to a combination

of several factors: 1) most non-cancer subjects who underwent testing likely had

COVID-19 symptoms early in the pandemic when testing was limited; 2) on the

other hand, more cancer patients who opted for testing due to extra caution were

asymptomatic; and 3) cancer patients practiced stronger personal protection

against COVID-19. Nevertheless, this finding is encouraging because it empirically

demonstrated that the risk for COVID-19 among cancer patients, even though they

may be more susceptible to the disease biologically, can be practically mitigated.

A trend of increased COVID-19 positive rates in patients of several specific

types of cancer in three organ systems (respiratory/intrathoracic organs, bone

articular cartilage, and thyroid/other endocrine glands) is another novel finding.

These results are intriguing considering the overall lower infection rate among

cancer patients observed in this cohort. It is noted that these associations did not

reach statistical significance. Confirmation in additional studies is needed.

The third major finding that cancer patients have a trend of increased COVID-

19 mortality is consistent with previously published studies.[2-7] The confirmation

from this population-based prospective study that included a broad range of over 44

cancer types further strengthens the available evidence and makes it more

generalizable to cancer patients in the general population. Among specific types of

cancer, the higher COVID-19 mortality in patients of several hematologic cancers,

especially Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, is noticeable. A similar finding was also

reported in the cancer cohort from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.[7] The

exact mechanism is unknown, but low lymphocyte counts in these patients is

suspected. A previous study suggests that COVID-19 patients with more severe

symptoms have lower lymphocyte counts caused by the functional exhaustion and

apoptosis of cytotoxic T lymphocytes.[11] Another study associated lymphopenia

with poorer overall survival for individuals with Non-Hodgkin lymphoma.[12]

The last finding was that multiple demographic and comorbid conditions

predicted COVID-19 mortality, but not COVID-19 positivity. The lack of association

with COVID-19 positivity is unlikely explained by sample size, because many more

subjects were available for testing positivity than mortality. Furthermore, it is

interesting to note that pre-existing cardiovascular disease and hypertension had a

stronger effect on COVID-19 mortality than respiratory disease and obesity. While

the differences could be due in part to fewer UKB subjects having comorbid COPD,

obesity and diabetes, the observation is consistent with published papers. In a meta-

analysis of seven studies including 1,576 COVID-19 positive patients, the most

prevalent comorbidities were hypertension and diabetes, followed by

cardiovascular disease and respiratory disease.[13] The findings for the association

of older age and male sex with COVID-19 mortality are consistent with previously

published studies.[4,5,13] Different from previous studies,[14,15] we did not find

the association of the two genetic markers (ABO blood type and

APOE) with COVID-

19 positivity and mortality.

Several limitations of this study are noted. One is the relatively small sample

size of tested subjects for COVID-19, which limited statistical power. A related

limitation is that none of the reported P-values were corrected for multiple testing.

Therefore, both positive and negative results of the study should be interpreted

with caution. Additional released COVID-19 data from the UKB will be helpful to

address both limitations. Another major limitation is the small number of minority

subjects in the UKB. Finally, the lack of detailed clinical information on COVID-19

symptoms/treatment and cancer treatment limited our ability to perform a more

comprehensive analysis.

In conclusion, in this first association study of cancer with COVID-19 risk and

mortality from a population-based cohort, we showed that cancer patients in

general have lower observed risk for COVID-19 infection but higher risk for COVID-

19 death after infection, especially for hematologic cancers. The lower risk for

COVID-19 infection, most likely due to extra caution in COVID-19 prevention and

more testing among cancer patients, is encouraging and demonstrates the feasibility

of intervention. We also showed that a subset of cancer patients is more likely to die

of COVID-19 after the infection. These results, if confirmed, may provide guidance

for COVID-19 prevention and treatment among cancer patients. Stronger personal

protection should be made for cancer patients, and more intensive surveillance
