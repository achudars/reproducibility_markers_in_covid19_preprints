Introduction
Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) has the potential to transform healthcare delivery in the era of
COVID-19 with its diagnostic and therapeutic expediency.1 It can be performed by clinicians
already at the bedside, which permits an immediate and augmented assessment of a patient.2
POCUS devices, particularly handheld devices, are often cheaper than traditional radiological
equipment such as X-ray or computerized tomography (CT) machines, which makes POCUS
ideal for surge scenarios and other resource-limited settings. Since providers using POCUS are
concomitantly at the bedside assessing patients, POCUS may reduce personal protective
equipment usage by radiological technicians or the need to decontaminate larger radiological
equipment.
Although lung ultrasound can be used to accurately diagnose a variety of disease states such as
pneumothorax, pleural effusions, pneumonia and interstitial lung disease2, there are limited
reports on the sonographic manifestations of COVID-19. There is an urgent need to identify
alternative diagnostic modalities that can be immediately employed at the bedside of COVID-19
patients. In this report, we characterize lung ultrasound findings of patients admitted to our
hospitals with COVID-19 and stratify these findings by time, location, and illness severity.
Methods:
This study was conducted at two medical centers in the United States from 3/21/2020-6/01/2020.
Any adult who was hospitalized with COVID-19 (based on symptomatology3 and a confirmatory
RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2) and received a pulmonary POCUS examination was included.
Patients who did not meet these criteria were excluded. Our Institutional Review Board approved
this study.
Provider discretion determined whether to perform an initial or follow-up POCUS examination
for each patient. Providers were instructed to use a 12-zone scanning protocol for pulmonary
views (Figure 1) and save 6 second clips of each lung zone.4 This study utilized several POCUS
devices, including Butterfly IQTM, VaveTM, LumifyTM, and SonositeTM. The collected images
were interpreted by the study researchers based on a consensus document developed by the study
authors and previously accepted definitions of lung POCUS findings.4-7
Results:
A total of 22 eligible patients who received 36 lung scans were included in our study (Table 1).
Eleven (50%) patients experienced clinical deterioration (defined as either ICU admission,
invasive mechanical ventilation, or death within 28 days from the initial symptom onset).
Among the 36 lung scans collected, only 3 (8%) were classified as normal (Table 1). The
remaining scans had the following abnormalities: presence of B-lines (n=32, 89%),
consolidations (n=20, 56%), pleural thickening (n=17, 47%), and pleural effusion (n=4, 11%).

Out of 20 scans with consolidations, 14 (70%) were subpleural and 5 (25%) were translobar. Alines were present in 26 (72%) of patients, although they were only observed in the majority of
the collected lung zones in 5 (14%) of patients. Table 1 also displays the above findings by
location.
Scans from patients who experienced clinical deterioration demonstrated higher percentages of
B-lines (100% vs. 80%), consolidations (69% vs. 45%), pleural thickening (69% vs. 30%) and
effusions (25% vs. 0%). Additionally, scans from patients with clinical deterioration had higher
percentages of bilateral B-lines (63% vs. 45%) and bilateral consolidation (50% vs. 15%).
Ultrasound findings were stratified by time from symptom onset to the scan based on the
following time periods: early (0-6 days), middle (7-13 days), and late (14-28 days). B-lines
appeared early after symptom onset and persisted well into the late disease course (Figure 2). In
contrast, pleural thickening increased in frequency over time (early: 25%, middle: 47%, late:
67%). Subpleural consolidations also appeared in higher frequency later in the disease course
(early: 13%, middle 42%, late: 56%). A-lines were observed throughout the time course (early:
63%, middle 74%, late 78%; Figure 2), although A-lines often occurred in a patchy distribution.
Discussion
In this report, we characterize lung ultrasound findings for patients admitted to the hospital with
COVID-19, and further stratify these findings by patients who experienced clinical deterioration.
Common findings included B-lines, consolidation (including subpleural consolidations), and
pleural thickening. Effusions were rare, which is consistent with CT studies from COVID-19
patients.5 Notably, B-lines were common for both patients who did and did not experience
clinical deterioration. They frequently appeared in all lung zones, and they persisted throughout
the 28 day scanning period. In contrast, subpleural consolidation and pleural thickening appeared
later in the disease course, and they were more common in patients who experienced clinical
deterioration. Importantly, bilateral involvement of several findings (B-lines or consolidation)
was more commonly encountered in the patients who experienced clinical deterioration. Certain
patient conditions, such as intubation or patient mobility, affected the provider from acquiring all
12 zones, particularly the posterior zones.
In conclusion, certain lung ultrasound findings may be common in Covid-19, while others may
appear later in the disease course or only occur in patients who experience clinical deterioration.
Future efforts should investigate the predictive utility of consolidations, pleural thickening and
B-lines for clinical deterioration and compare them to traditional radiological studies such as Xrays or CTs.

Consolidation: There are two types
of consolidation observed:
subpleural and translobar. A
subpleural consolidation (left) is
characterized by a broken/highly
irregular pleural line and associated
increased echogenicity below the
pleural line. An effusion may be
rarely present, as shown in the
image. A translobar consolidation
(right) is characterized by a dense
(sometimes called “hepaticized”)
lung that appears more solid. A
large effusion may be present (not
shown).

B-Lines: Vertically oriented lines that fulfill
the following criteria: (1) extend from the
pleural surface to the maximum depth of the
image (at least 13-16cm) and (2) move in
conjunction with lung sliding, and (3) erasure
of A-lines as they move over them.

Figure 1. Scanning Protocol and Lung Ultrasound Findings in COVID-19 Patients. This study utilized a
12-zone protocol.4 On each hemithorax, there are 6 zones. The exam begins on the patient’s right side.
Zones 1-2 (anterior zones) are between the parasternal margin (PSM) and the anterior axillary line (AAL)

and are best obtained in the mid-clavicular line. Zones 3-4 (lateral zones) are between the anterior axillary
line (AAL) and posterior axillary line (PAL) and are best obtained in the mid-axillary line. The nipple line
serves as a bisecting area between these zones. Zones 5-6 (posterior zones) are medial to the scapular line
(SL) and are bisected by the inferior scapular margin (ISM). The zone areas are repeated on the
contralateral hemithorax (starting with zone 7). This figure contains an overview of the observed
ultrasound findings based on previously described terminology.4,6,7
