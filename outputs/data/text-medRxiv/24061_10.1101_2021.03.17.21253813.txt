A simple model for how the risk of pandemics
from different virus families depends
on viral and human traits

Abstract
Different virus families, like influenza or corona viruses, exhibit characteristic
traits such as typical modes of transmission and replication as well as specific
animal reservoirs in which each family of viruses circulate. These traits of genetically related groups of viruses influence how easily an animal virus can adapt
to infect humans, how well novel human variants can spread in the population,
and the risk of causing a global pandemic. Relating the traits of virus families to
their risk of causing future pandemics, and identification of the key time scales
within which public health interventions can control the spread of a new virus
that could cause a pandemic, are obviously significant. We address these issues
using a minimal model whose parameters are related to characteristic traits of
different virus families. A key trait of viruses that ‚Äúspillover‚Äù from animal reservoirs to infect humans is their ability to propagate infection through the human
population (fitness). We find that the risk of pandemics emerging from virus
families characterized by a wide distribution of the fitness of spillover strains
is much higher than if such strains were characterized by narrow fitness distributions around the same mean. The dependences of the risk of a pandemic on
various model parameters exhibit inflection points. We find that these inflection points define informative thresholds. For example, the inflection point in
variation of pandemic risk with time after the spillover represents a threshold
time beyond which global interventions would likely be too late to prevent a
pandemic.

1. Introduction
Infectious disease pandemics and epidemics caused by newly emergent pathogens
can lead to major health and economic crises and have been on the rise in recent decades [1, 2, 3]. We, the inhabitants of the twenty-first century, have been
cruelly reminded of the negative impacts of a global pandemic by the ongoing
COVID-19 crisis [4, 5].
Major infectious disease epidemics and pandemics are often the result of
pathogens that usually circulate in animals becoming capable of infecting humans [2]. Such jumps of pathogens from animals to humans are called zoonotic
shifts. For viruses, especially those with RNA genome, such events happen when
an animal virus adapts to human hosts, sometimes via an intermediate animal.
Such adaptation can occur via mutation and/or re-assortment or recombination
[6, 7]. RNA viruses mutate continuously, and recombination or re-assortment
processes can happen when two or more viral strains infect the same cell in an
animal or a human. If a virus strain that emerges in this fashion can infect
humans, is reasonably contagious and reasonably lethal, frightening pandemics
can occur. This is because few, if any, humans have immunity for this new
pathogen, which can lead to a rapid spread of the disease [8], especially in our
modern densely populated and connected world. If a not insignificant fraction of
infected people require hospitalization, the medical system can be overwhelmed,
and deaths and lockdowns exact an enormous human and economic toll.
For effective prevention and control of pandemics it would be helpful if one
could anticipate future disease outbreaks. Various methods for prediction of
the severity of disease outbreaks have been used [9, 10], but they usually focus on viruses that already circulate in humans, and therefore, the predictions tend to be rather specific and often short-term. Predicting the emergence of zoonotic strains more generally, however, presents major difficulties
[11]. These novel strains are created from complex and often random interactions between humans, animals and their respective pathogens, via many
mutations and recombinations/re-assortments and this makes the specific evolutionary and transmission paths leading to successful human strains hard to
predict [6, 7, 12, 13]. Additionally there is a lack of data on the spectrum of
circulating animal viruses as well as on their potential to cause human disease
[12, 14]. Finally, most newly emerging viruses do not cause major outbreaks
in humans. Pandemics are thus rare events, making their prediction from data
especially difficult [15].
Even if precise predictions cannot be made regarding the viruses that are
most likely to cause pandemics, and under what circumstances, it is important
to obtain some mechanistic understanding of the phenomena that underlie answers to these questions. Specifically, can we obtain mechanistic insights into
the relative risk of pandemics emerging due to viruses from different families
that have different traits? Genetically related virus families evolve subject to a
similar fitness landscape whose topology is determined by core viral traits such
as genome length, typical mode of infection, replication and transmission. The
traits of the animal host species in which the virus family circulates and their

similarity and contact with humans are also important [16]. If we can describe
a virus family with common traits and trait distributions as a unit, we can
learn about their relative risk of causing pandemics, and the mechanism underlying these risk factors without making assumptions about specific evolutionary
processes.
Here, we develop a pandemic risk model and employ it to calculate the
probability and frequency for a pandemic to emerge from virus families with
different characteristics. These characteristics include: the fitness distribution
and zoonotic shift frequency of distinct viral types that circulate in animal hosts;
the characteristics of the human host population in relation to the virus, which
influence the growth and transmission of the disease from a local outbreak to
the global human population. Human traits/behavior in particular influence the
nature of the temporal variation of disease growth rate after initial emergence.

Figure 1: Schematic depiction of the model framework: A viral type, here shown as a group
of viruses of different colors on the left, produces human variants by zoonotic shift (a bat is
an example animal origin). Human functional variants, with initial fitness F0 drawn from a
2 that characterizes their type, emerge at
fitness distribution with mean Fm and variance œÉF
rate ¬µshift and initially infect N0 people in the infection center (left circle with humans, colored
white if susceptible, red if infected). The disease spreads in the infection center with effective
rate F (t), which may change with time. Transmission to the rest of the world (right circle
with many humans) that triggers a pandemic, happens at rate , until a time œÑmax . This is the
time before which the emergence and spread of a new disease is not noticed internationally,
and so no restrictions to travel are put in place until then.

A sketch of the key features of our model is shown in Fig. 1. New functional human variants from a specific viral type are assumed to emerge at a
zoonotic shift rate ¬µshift . Functional here means that these viruses are able to
infect and reproduce in humans and have a positive human-to-human transmission rate. But the rate of replication and transmission can be very small for
poorly adapted variants and the effective disease growth rate, given infection

and recovery rates, can even be negative. Each such novel human strain is created by a complex interaction between animal and human hosts and between
their respective, related viruses. This can also include intermediate hosts that
form a link between the reservoir host and humans. In general, the process
can involve various jumps between different host species and multiple mutation
and recombination/re-assortment events. The zoonotic shift rate ¬µshift therefore
depends on various viral and host factors [16, 17]. The genetic similarity between animal reservoir hosts and humans determines how much an animal virus
typically needs to change to adapt to the human host environment [15]. Thus
we expect that animal hosts that are more similar to humans produce more
frequent adaptations leading to a higher ¬µshift than less similar animals. Physical proximity, including the extent and nature of interactions between reservoir
and intermediate animal hosts and humans is another important factor influencing the zoonotic shift rate, since it determines the frequency, at which viral
exchanges between the species occur [15]. Wild birds, for example, form a reservoir for many subtypes of influenza A virus, and most spillovers to humans have
happened via the infection of humans by livestock hosts such as poultry and
pigs, which are in close contact with humans [18].
Each new human variant, being created at rate ¬µshift , is then represented
with a fitness F0 , which is the initial effective growth rate of the disease in the
human population. The fitness parameter F0 is non-dimensional and represents
infection rate minus recovery rate, times the typical infection period. This relates to the (basic) reproduction number R = F0 +1, a standard parameter used
in epidemiological models [10], which describes the mean number of secondary
infections caused by one infected person.
In our model, fitness is drawn from a normal distribution fF (F0 |Fm , œÉF )
with mean Fm and variance œÉF2 , which represent the traits of a specific viral
type evolving on a complex fitness landscape to become capable of infecting
and potentially thriving in a human population. We scale all times and rates in
our model with the typical infection period, which is equal to the time it takes
for a person to recover from infection. The recovery rate in non-dimensional
form is thus equal to 1.
The fitness depends on both the infectivity of the virus and on host characteristics such as population density and social interaction networks. We regard
Fm as a typical initial fitness of novel functional variants of a particular type
spreading in a human population without human intervention. Fm can also depend on the genetic similarity of humans and the reservoir hosts because viruses
that are well adapted to a very distant reservoir host will require many changes
to be well adapted to humans. Since such dramatic changes are unlikely, Fm
would be small. The variance œÉF2 expresses variations of viral traits that lead
to different rates of spread for different functional variants of the same type.
In the population where the disease first emerges, which we call the infection
center, we assume that a small number N0 of initial human hosts are directly
infected by animal contact. On average the outbreak, i.e. the mean number N

Fitness (starting from F (t = 0) = F0 ) generally varies with time, for example
due to human interventions, environmental fluctuations, or reduction of the
number of susceptible individuals with increasing population immunity.
During the spread of the disease in the infection center, individuals can
travel away from the original center and transmit the disease to the rest of the
world. We assume that each infected person in the infection center can seed a
global outbreak at a rate , and that a pandemic is caused when one such seed
has emerged, which can then quickly spread globally. The ‚Äúworld transmission
rate‚Äù  includes a measure of connectedness of the infection center with the rest
of the world and transmissibility of the virus. The parameter œÑmax depends on
the rapidity with which the emergence of a new virus is understood. œÑmax is
large for a virus that causes a disease like COVID-19 with many asymptomatic
yet infectious cases and a relatively low death rate, and smaller for the opposite
disease characteristics. For example, the Ebola, Zika, and MERS epidemics
were characterized by a smaller œÑmax compared to COVID-19. This is because
people infected with Zika, Ebola, or MERS quickly became very ill and a large
fraction died [19], thus alerting the world to a deadly virus before it had time
to spread widely. Diseases in this category are comparatively easily detected
and subsequently controlled at the location of the outbreak, before significant
international transmissions.
Since each infected person can seed a pandemic with rate , the total rate of
pandemic seeding at time t is given as  N . Thus the probability pnot (t + dt),
that no pandemic has been initiated by time t + dt with dt being a small time
step, can be expressed as
pnot (t + dt) = pnot (t) (1 ‚àí N ) dt,

(2)

i.e., as the probability that no pandemic seeding event happened until time t
times the probability that also no seeding event happened between t and t + dt.
Therefore, the probability pnot decreases with time as

We obtain the probability that at least one such event has occurred (i.e. that a

curve in the infection center. For our pandemic risk measure we calculate the
probability that a pandemic is caused by a variant within the specified global
response time œÑmax after its initial emergence.
The average pandemic risk ppan of a viral type is finally determined by
averaging the pandemic probability p across viruses from that type, with the
initial variant fitness drawn from the characteristic distribution fF (F0 |Fm , œÉF ).
We calculate this average pandemic risk as
Z ‚àû

ppan (Fm , œÉF , N0 , , œÑmax , F (t ‚â§ œÑmax )) =
dF0 fF (F0 |Fm , œÉF ) p(F0 , N0 , , œÑmax , F (t0 ‚â§ œÑmax )).

(5)
The integration starts at F0 = 0 (equivalent to R = 1), since with an initially
negative fitness and small infection number N0 , the virus will go extinct quickly
due to the discrete nature of the underlying system, which we do not treat
explicitly in our equations.
The single-variant risk p(F0 = Fm ) from Eq. (4), which describes the pandemic risk of a viral type with a single variant and therefore with no variance,
œÉF2 = 0, can be analytically expressed for the scenarios 1 and 2 considered
below. The mean ppan (Fm , œÉF , N0 , , œÑmax , F (t0 ‚â§ œÑmax )) (Eq. (5)) can be calculated numerically for those scenarios with deterministic fitness variation. We
calculate this mean pandemic risk for various parameter combinations and we
investigate and interpret its dependence on the different model parameters.
With the zoonotic shift rate we can, from ppan , calculate the expected frequency, at which pandemic variants of a certain type occur, as ¬µshift ppan .
In the following, we first consider the pandemic risk directly for two different scenarios of the time-variation of fitness during the initial outbreak in the
infection center: with time-invariant fitness and with linearly decreasing fitness.
For each case we study the mean pandemic risk ppan and analyze its dependence
on the model parameters. We further consider a third scenario, with randomly
varying fitness around a constant mean. For this last scenario we cannot directly
obtain the average pandemic risk with an analytical formula, but in all cases
we can determine a characteristic inflection time, beyond which international
interventions will on average only have marginal effects.
3. Results
In order to determine pandemic risk under different outbreak conditions,
we consider different temporal variations of fitness in the infection center. We
assume the changes of disease fitness during the initial outbreak to mainly be
caused by changes within the host population and the environment, and not
due to mutation of the virus. For that we assume that the mutation rate of
the virus is sufficiently small that it does not evolve much during the initial
disease outbreak, which we focus on here. This situation includes SARS-CoV-2,
where mutants only started playing an important role several months after the
initial outbreak, but it does not include very highly mutable viruses like HIV

that evolves significantly even within individual hosts. If the disease causes
mild symptoms and only few hospitalizations, it likely stays unnoticed for an
extended period and the disease growth rate can stay constant in a large infection center, where the supply of susceptible individuals stays high and no
non-pharmaceutical interventions are put in place within œÑmax . This is the first
scenario that we analyze; i.e., a constant fitness with time.
For the second scenario we assume that, due to hospitalizations, prevalent
symptomatic infection or due to regular monitoring of zoonotic shifts, the disease is detected and early human interventions are put in place within the infection center. These can include the wearing of personal protective equipment,
social distancing, reduced gatherings, or a combination of the above. Such interventions reduce the contact rate between infected and susceptible people and
therefore the fitness. Fitness can also decrease due to the reduction of susceptible people in the infection center. As a simple example of a gradual fitness
reduction we consider a linear decrease in fitness with time.
The third scenario is random variation of fitness, e.g. through fluctuating
human behavior and non-sustained interventions. Such random variations of
disease growth rates are represented by a Gaussian noise around a mean fitness.
Real disease outbreaks show a wide range of temporal variations, many of
which can be characterized by combinations of the three scenarios we consider.
For example, Thompson et al. [20] found that for different outbreaks of Ebola,
pandemic flu, and MERS, the reproduction number varied in different fashions,
being either roughly constant, decreasing or fluctuating.
Scenario 1: Constant fitness
We first consider the scenario in which the fitness stays constant within the
time scale œÑmax . In this case the number of infected people in a large infection
center grows on average exponentially, following Eq. (1), as
N (t) = N0 exp (F0 t)

The pandemic risk for one variant with fitness F0 is then calculated using

We numerically calculate the mean pandemic risk of the corresponding viral
type with mean fitness Fm and fitness variance œÉF2 using Eq. (5) for a range of
parameter values (Figs. 2 and 3). We compare this numerical result with the
analytical zero-variance risk from Eq. (7) with F0 = Fm .
For this single-variant risk (Eq. (7)) we expect that the pandemic risk first
increases almost exponentially with fitness, before asymptotically approaching
1. This can be seen in Fig. 2a, which shows a nearly linear increase of the
logarithm of pandemic risk with mean fitness for most of the observed fitness
range before the asymptotic approach to 1. The single-variant risk agrees with
the mean pandemic risk only for very low variance, while the mean risk can be

up to several orders of magnitude higher than the single-variant result in the
case of wide fitness distributions, as long as Fm > 0 and if F0 is not too large. In
this case, the pandemic risk initially increases with the variance œÉF2 in a roughly
exponential fashion, before tapering and asymptotically approaching 1 (Fig. 2b).
This risk-enhancing effect of fitness variance in a symmetric distribution, which
might seem surprising, mainly happens due to the averaging of a convex function
as long as the pandemic risk is low. In this case p(F0 ) is convex and therefore
hp(F0 )i > p(hF0 i).

(8)

So, even if two strains are equally higher or lower in fitness than the mean, and
so their average fitness equals Fm , the contribution to the average of p from the
higher-fitness strain more than makes up for that from the low-fitness strain.
A virus family, which is adapted to a reservoir host that is genetically very
distantly related to us, but sometimes comes in physical proximity to humans
or animals that humans interact with, can lead to many unsuccessful spillovers
with on average very low fitness. But with a wide fitness distribution it can
by chance sometimes produce fit variants and such rare events can result in
pandemics. For example, a virus type with mean fitness Fm = 0.5 (equivalent
to reproduction number R = 1.5) and with variance œÉF2 = 2, as well as N0 = 1,
 = 10‚àí5 , œÑmax = 4 has a mean pandemic risk of around 4%, which is a hundred
times higher risk compared to the case of a zero-variance fitness distribution.
When the variant fitness F0 is high, the single-variant risk (Eq. (7)) passes
an inflection point F0‚àó , at which p00 (F0‚àó ) = 0. Thus, the convexity condition
(Eq. 8), which holds for types with lower fitness where curvature is positive

(p00 (F0 ) > 0) reverses for higher fitness values and we see in Fig. 2a that above
the inflection point (here when Fm > F0‚àó ‚âà 3), i.e. when p00 (F0 ) < 0, wide
distributions with high variance have a reduced mean pandemic risk compared
to the zero-variance case. At high mean fitness, those fitness variants, which
have even higher fitness than the mean, cause a diminishing return in terms of
pandemic risk since the pandemic probability is restricted by the upper limit of
1, while the co-occurring low-fitness variants cause the mean risk to decrease.
Virus types with negative mean fitness Fm < 0 and small variance have
very low pandemic risk, since most variants produced by such a type will have
negative growth rates. The pandemic risk reduces rapidly due to the diminishing
portion of the fitness distribution that is above the extinction threshold F0 = 0,

As function of response time (Fig. 3), the mean pandemic risk again initially

strains (Eq. (9)). For the parameter values we consider, if the global response
is delayed by only few disease generations, the pandemic risk can increase over
several orders of magnitude. For example, if the infection period is around 1
week, the pandemic risk of a viral type with Fm = 1, œÉF2 = 1, N0 = 1 and
 = 10‚àí5 can increase from around 1/500 of a percent after the first week to
more than 30% after a two-months delay (after 8 disease generations).

With finite fitness variance the increase with œÑmax is initially larger than
for zero-variance (Eq. (7)), due to the convex nonlinearity as function of F0
at short times. However, when global response time is slow, at long œÑmax , the
risk starts levelling off towards its upper limit after passing the inflection point,
where p00 (F0 ) changes sign. At long times, again, a large variance œÉF2 becomes
disadvantageous for the virus due to the diminishing returns noted above. This
means that the mean pandemic risk at long times is larger if the fitness of the
newly emerging strains in a virus family exhibit no variance from a single value.
This zero-variance risk approaches its upper limit in the long-time limit
rapidly with a double exponential function 1‚àíp(œÑmax ) ‚àº 1/ exp(Œª exp(Fm œÑmax ))
of time (Eq. (7)). The pandemic risk for finite variance, on the other hand, approaches its asymptotic limit much slower with 1 ‚àí ppan (œÑmax ) ‚àº 1/ exp(ŒªœÑmax ))
with a single exponential. The increase of mean pandemic risk at long times
is dominated by the lowest-fitness variants at the extinction threshold, with
F0 ‚Üí 0, which have not had the chance yet to seed a pandemic, and which get
there only at a low rate.
The effect of fitness variance leading to reduced risk at long times or at high
mean fitness can only decrease risk down to a certain point, and not by orders
of magnitude as opposed to the contrasting risk-enhancing effect of wide distributions, which applies before the inflection point of p(F0 ). We can understand
this with the following intuitive argument. The pandemic risk of a variant can
be expressed as p(F0 ) = 1 ‚àí exp(‚àíf (F0 )), where f (F0 ) = [N (F0 ) ‚àí N0 ]/F0
is a convex function of F0 (see Eq. (7)). As long as F0 and œÑmax are small
such that f < 1, the pandemic risk can be approximated with the convex function p(F0 ) ‚âà f (F0 ) (using a first order Taylor approximation around f = 0).
This means that the inflection point (separating convex from concave curvature) is around the point, where f (F0‚àó ) ‚âà 1, and at this point the pandemic risk
p(F0‚àó ) ‚âà 1 ‚àí exp(‚àí1) ‚âà 0.63 is already quite high. From this we conclude that
the risk-reducing effect of wide distributions beyond the inflection point is only
marginal because it only takes effect when the risk is already high. So, virus
families characterized by a wide variance in the fitness of emergent variants that
can infect humans generally pose a larger pandemic risk.
With increasing response time œÑmax , the pandemic risk not only passes an inflection point with respect to F0 , but also an inflection time t‚àó , where p00 (t‚àó ) = 0,
i.e. p00 (œÑmax ) changes sign from positive to negative. This is again around the
point, where the pandemic risk p(œÑmax ) = 1 ‚àí exp(‚àíg(œÑmax )) ‚âà 1 ‚àí exp(‚àí1) ‚âà
0.63 approaches its upper limit, i.e., when pandemic risk is no longer approximated by the convex (exponential) function g(œÑmax ) = [N (F0 ) ‚àí N0 ]/F0 . This
means that changes in global response time matter significantly, due to exponentially increasing risk with time, before the inflection time, when œÑmax < t‚àó .
At longer times, œÑmax > t‚àó , however, due to a diminishing return, varying the
response time has an only marginal effect on pandemic risk, which then is already high and close to its upper limit. As illustrated above, global intervention
can at this late point only prevent pandemic seeding of the least fit strains of
the respective type. These findings indicate that overall a virus family is likely
to be most dangerous, if it can seed an outbreak by causing a disease that is

For an example virus with an infection period of one week, and with F0 = 1,
 = 10‚àí5 , N0 = 1, the dimensional inflection time would be around 3 months
(12 infection periods), after which a global response could be classified as too
late.
Scenario 2: Decreasing fitness
As an alternative scenario we consider a disease which is such that the fitness
of the emergent viral strain decreases with time. This could happen either
because it is quickly detected in the infection center and early control measures
and behavioral changes are put in place, or because the fraction of susceptible
people in the infection center decreases notably. Here we consider a simple case
of a linearly decreasing fitness F (t) = F0 (1 ‚àí t/œÑF ) declining from an initial
fitness F0 ‚àº fF (F0 |Fm , œÉF ). Here œÑF is an additional parameter representing
the typical time scale, within which the local interventions or other mechanisms
that lead to the fitness decrease fully take effect. The mean number of infected
individuals in this case is calculated using Eq. (1) as

The above formula is valid for œÑmax ‚â§ 2œÑF . For longer response times the risk
will stay at p(œÑmax > 2œÑF ) = p(œÑmax = 2œÑF ) ‚âà N0 œÑF , since in that case the
disease in the infection center will have reached an extinction threshold when the
time equals 2œÑF . By then the infection number will on average have decreased
to the initial number N0 > 0, and assuming a small N0 plus the now negative
and further decreasing fitness the disease will stochastically reach extinction
soon after. From the single-variant risk we again obtain the mean pandemic
risk numerically using Eq. (5), where we average over F0 ‚àº fF (F0 |Fm , œÉF ).
With such a linearly decreasing fitness the cumulative number of infections
is given by:

Both the zero-variance risk (Eq. 15) and the averaged pandemic risk increase
with œÑF at first before œÑF  œÑmax , after which they asymptotically approach the
pandemic risk for constant F (t) = F0 (Fig. 4a). This shows that local responses,
which often are more direct and faster in implementation than a global response
(with œÑF < œÑmax ) can reduce pandemic risk by several orders of magnitude via
early suppression of disease spread in the infection center.
The inflection time for the case of decreasing fitness is again calculated with
Eq. (12) and is determined by

since then the inflection point is determined by the turning point (maximum)

œÑF ‚Üí ‚àû the inflection time decreases again and approaches the inflection time
t‚àó0 for constant fitness F0 (Eq. (13)). The decrease of the inflection time at long

If the inflection time marks the same high pandemic risk in all cases, it would always be better to have a long inflection time, for pandemic risk control. For long
intervention times œÑF , where the upper limit of pandemic risk is roughly constant, this is the case and long inflection times then indicate a human advantage.
However, for short local intervention times œÑF the upper limit of pandemic risk
decreases with decreasing œÑF , which is due to the effective control and extinction of the local outbreak. This shows the different effects of local interventions:
more rapid interventions either decrease the upper limit of pandemic risk (at
short œÑF ) or delay the time at which a high pandemic risk is reached (at long
œÑF ) thereby giving more time for global interventions.
Scenario 3: Randomly varying fitness
In addition to systematic changes of fitness, there can be random variations
due to uncoordinated, non-sustained interventions or other human behavioral
fluctuations. Here, as example of a random fitness variation in time, we consider
fitness that fluctuates around a deterministic mean F0 as F (t) = F0 + Fr Œæ(t)
with a Gaussian random variable Œæ(t) and the characteristic amplitude Fr of
the fluctuations. In this case we calculate the mean number of infections in the

Although there is no simple formula in this case for the pandemic risk, averaged
over random trajectories, we can calculate the average inflection time ht‚àó i as a
function of the fitness parameters F0 and Fr using Eqs (12), (21) and the mean
fitness hF i(t) = F0 across different disease outbreaks of the same variant. We

The inflection time again marks the time point, after which a global response
can on average only lead to a marginal reduction of risk. Such a late response
would in most individual outbreak situations be too late to prevent a global
outbreak.
The inflection time decreases with increasing fitness components F0 and Fr
(Fig. 5). For a virus type, whose different strains have baseline fitness F0 ‚àº

large fluctuation amplitude Fr = 2, and  = 10‚àí5 , this characteristic inflection
time is ht‚àó i(Fm , Fr ) = 4 infection periods, while without random fluctuations
in time, Fr = 0, it would be three times longer with t‚àó (Fm , Fr ) = 12 infection
periods, thus on average giving more time to react in the case of low fitness
fluctuations.
4. Discussion
With a minimal pandemic risk model we have investigated how pandemics
emerge from characteristically different viral types. We analyzed how pandemic
risk and frequency are influenced by key viral and human population traits:
mean and variance of the disease growth rate or fitness, zoonotic shift frequency,
world transmission rate, local and global response times and variations in fitness
with time.
We show that wide fitness distributions can drastically increase pandemic
risk compared to narrow distributions around the same mean fitness, because
the functional dependence of pandemic risk on viral fitness is initially convex.
We further identify an inflection point in pandemic risk variation with respect
to fitness, beyond which the convexity condition is not valid and narrow fitness
distributions become more dangerous compared to wide distributions in terms
of pandemic risk.
It is well known that swift collaborative action is important to control the
global spread of novel pathogens [22]. But how rapid do these interventions
need to be, i.e. what is the relevant time scale? We identify this time scale to
be the pandemic inflection time, after which human responses are likely too late
to stop the world-wide spread of the disease. Previous studies have discussed
an epidemic inflection time [23, 24], which corresponds to the time point at
which the number of infected people in a population reaches its maximum (i.e.
its turning point). This time scale relies on the leveling off of the cumulative
Rt
number 0 dt0 N (t0 ) of infections within a relatively short time compared to the
global disease transmission time scale. It therefore represents a special case of
our pandemic inflection time. The epidemic inflection time coincides with our
measure only in scenario 2, in the case of rapid and complete control (with small
œÑF ) of the local outbreak. The pandemic inflection time, however, describes the
time point, at which the pandemic risk starts levelling off in general. This can
be due to a local turning point as discussed in the context of scenario 2, but
it can also simply occur due to the approach of the upper limit of pandemic
probability (100%), at which point most outbreaks would have already caused a
pandemic and only few strains, at the low-fitness end of the distribution, would
not yet have reached their final (pandemic) outcome.
Local interventions, which gradually reduce the disease growth rate (scenario 2), can by themselves prevent pandemics only if they are able to rapidly
extinguish the outbreak. This is what happened during the Ebola outbreaks,
and to some extent for MERS. Both these diseases were caused by highly lethal
viruses, and thus were quickly noticed and controlled locally. If, however, local

interventions reduce the spread in the infection center slowly and incompletely,
this merely postpones the inflection time point. In the latter case global interventions are needed, but are given more time to be put into action. Linear
fitness decrease in the infection center due to such interventions leads to an error
function-type increase of cumulative cases. This characteristic time-dependent
behavior of cumulative case numbers has recently been observed in several countries, where different social-distancing measures against COVID-19 were put in
place [21]. With the model of linearly decreasing fitness we thus provide one
mechanistic explanation for such trends.
As long as the disease is not completely eradicated and immunization measures are not yet developed, it is important that control measures are consistently applied to systematically decrease fitness in the infection center instead of
relying on intermittent interventions and natural behavioral adaptations, which
might lead to large fitness fluctuations in time. Such random fluctuations are
demonstrated to on average shorten the inflection time and therefore give global
interventions less time to effectively prevent a global outbreak (scenario 3).
The richness and diversity of infectious disease outbreaks have increased
since 1980 [3], which is likely due to human factors such as the continuous
increases in population size, density and connectedness as well as human occupation of new locales [25, 26]. Several of our model parameters can be influenced
by human population trends in ways that can explain a rising pandemic risk.
The zoonotic shift rate and fitness variance across strains have increased from
an increased frequency of animal-human contact due to increases in livestock
and wildlife trade and human encroachment in new areas (via deforestation and
agricultural expansion) [15, 6]. The mean fitness of human variants could have
increased due to increased human population density, especially in urban environments, which increases the contact rate between humans and therefore the
disease growth rate. Finally, the world transmission rate is undoubtedly higher
due to increased global connectedness and travel.
On the other hand, a decrease in disease fitness and world transmission
rate, as well as increased speeds of response (local ‚àº 1/œÑF or global ‚àº 1/œÑmax )
are achieved through technological and scientific advances leading to improved
surveillance as well as through informed and swiftly implemented policies. Such
concerted efforts decrease pandemic risk; here it appears that global mobilization
issues present a greater source of delayed response than surveillance capacity
[22].
In the face of sparse data on newly emerging infectious diseases [14] and to
make predictions for diverse viral pathogens, the simplicity and generality of our
model are a strength. Representing viral types with simple fitness distributions
of new variants, without resolving specific evolutionary paths and fitness landscape topologies, makes our model analytically tractable while still capturing
important stochastic effects, and could potentially provide mechanistic underpinnings to empirical observations or more detailed descriptions. In particular,
we hope that the importance of the inflection points revealed by our analyses
will help guide data-driven public policy.

with a time-independent component F0 , and Gaussian fluctuations of the fitness
around F0 with typical amplitude Fr . The random variable Œæ(t) is a Gaussian
white noise characterized by a unit variance, hŒæ(t)Œæ(t0 )i = Œ¥(t ‚àí t0 ), and zero
mean, hŒæ(t)i = 0.
Accordingly, the infected population size for a certain variant spreading in
