Abstract
Background. Studies reporting estimates of the seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies have rapidly emerged. We aimed to
synthesize seroprevalence data to better estimate the burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection, identify
high-risk groups, and inform public health decision making.

Methods. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched publication databases,
preprint servers, and grey literature sources for seroepidemiological study reports, from January
1, 2020 to August 28, 2020. We included studies that reported a sample size, study date, location,
and seroprevalence estimate. Estimates were corrected for imperfect test accuracy with Bayesian
measurement error models. We conducted meta-analysis to identify demographic differences in
the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and meta-regression to identify study-level factors
associated with seroprevalence. We compared region-specific seroprevalence data to confirmed
cumulative incidence. PROSPERO: CRD42020183634.

Findings. We identified 338 seroprevalence studies including 2.3 million participants in 50
countries. Seroprevalence was low in the general population (median 3.2%, IQR 1.0-6.4%) and
slightly higher in at-risk populations (median 5.4%, IQR 1.5-18.4%). Median seroprevalence
varied by WHO Global Burden of Disease region (p < 0.01), from 1.0% in Southeast Asia, East
Asia and Oceania to 18.8% in South Asia. National studies had lower seroprevalence estimates
than local (p = 0.02) studies. Compared to White persons, Black persons (prevalence ratio [RR]
2.34, 95% CI 1.60-3.43) and Asian persons (RR 1.56, 95% CI 1.22-2.01) were more likely to be
seropositive. Seroprevalence was higher among people ages 18-64 compared to 65 and over (RR
1.26, 95% CI 1.04-1.52). Health care workers had a 1.74x (95% CI: 1.18-2.58) higher risk
compared to the general population. There was no difference in seroprevalence between sexes.
There were 123 studies (36%) at low or moderate risk of bias. Seroprevalence estimates from
national studies were median 11.9 (IQR 8.0 - 16.6) times higher than the corresponding SARSCoV-2 cumulative incidence.

Interpretation. Most of the population remains susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Public
health measures must be improved to protect disproportionately affected groups, including non-

1. Introduction
As of Nov 17, 2020, there were over 54 million confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection and
1.3 million deaths worldwide.1 However, these case counts inevitably underestimate the true
cumulative incidence of infection2 because of limited diagnostic test availability3, barriers to
testing accessibility4, and asymptomatic infections.5 The global burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection
remains unknown.

Serological assays identify SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, indicating previous infection in
unvaccinated persons.6 Population-based serological testing provides better estimates of the
cumulative incidence of infection, complementing diagnostic testing and helping to shape the
public health response to COVID-19.

SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence estimates are reported in published articles and preprints, but also
in government and health institute reports, and media.7 Consequently, few studies have
comprehensively synthesized seroprevalence findings. As the world prepares to enter this
pandemic’s vaccine era, synthesizing seroepidemiology findings is increasingly important to
measure the baseline prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies worldwide, identify
disproportionately affected groups, and inform the optimal distribution of COVID-19 vaccines.

To fill this gap, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of SARS-CoV-2
seroprevalence studies globally. We aimed to: (i) describe serosurveys globally and their
findings; (ii) identify geographic and study design factors associated with elevated
seroprevalence; (iii) identify groups at high risk of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection; and (iv)
evaluate how much confirmed infections underestimate the true burden of this pandemic.

2. Methods
2.1 Search strategy and selection criteria
This systematic review and meta-analysis was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020183634),
reported per PRISMA8 guidelines (Supplementary File 1), and will be regularly updated on an
open-access platform (SeroTracker.com).9
We searched Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Europe PMC, using a search strategy
developed in consultation with a health sciences librarian. Given that many serosurveys are not
reported in these databases we also searched public health agency websites and the Google News
aggregation platform, invited submissions to our SeroTracker website, and consulted with
international experts. We included records published from January 1, 2020 to August 28, 2020.
No limits on language were applied. Articles not in English or French were included if they
could be extracted in full using machine translation.10 Full search details are in Supplementary
File 2.
We included all SARS-CoV-2 serosurveys in humans. We defined a serosurvey as the
serological testing of a defined population over a specified period to estimate the prevalence of
SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.11,12 Included studies had to report a sample size, sampling date and
region, and prevalence estimate.
We excluded studies conducted only in people with SARS-CoV-2 infection; dashboards that
were not associated with a defined serology study; and case reports, case-control studies, and
reviews.
2.2 Screening and extraction
Two authors independently screened articles. Data were extracted by one reviewer and verified
by a second. We extracted characteristics of the study, sample, antibody test, and seroprevalence.
We extracted sub-group data when they were stratified by one variable (e.g., seniors) but not two
variables (e.g., female seniors). We contacted study authors to request any missing sub-group
seroprevalence data.

2.3 Evaluation of seroprevalence studies and estimates
The intended geographic scope of each estimate was classified as (A) national; (B) regional (e.g.,
province-level); (C) local (e.g., county-level, city-level); or (D) sublocal (e.g., one hospital
department). Countries were classified according to GBD region, and country income status
classified by distinguishing the high-income GBD region from other regions.13,14

We defined studies of the general population as samples from households, the community, blood
donors, or residual sera with the explicit purpose of providing estimates for the population at
large and for which the defining features shared by participants were location or age. Special
population studies were those sampling from and aiming to provide estimates for populations
with additional defining features (e.g., physicians).

We prioritized estimates that tested for IgG antibodies and that used traditional ELISAs, as nonIgG and anti-nucleocapsid antibodies appear to decline over time, while anti-spike IgG
antibodies appear to persist for several months after infection.15–20

A modified Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist for Prevalence Studies was
used to assess study risk of bias.21 Studies were classified by overall risk of bias: low, moderate,
high, or unclear (detailed criteria in Supplementary File 3).

2.4 Data Analysis
Data processing and descriptive statistics were conducted in Python. p-values less than 0.05 were
considered statistically significant.

2.4.1 Correcting seroprevalence estimates
To account for imperfect test sensitivity and specificity, seroprevalence estimates were corrected
using Bayesian measurement error models, with binomial sensitivity and specificity
distributions.22 We used sensitivity and specificity values from independent evaluations
wherever possible23; if unavailable, manufacturer-derived values were used (Supplementary File
4).

We presented corrected and uncorrected estimates for all studies. Subsequent analyses were done
using corrected seroprevalence estimates. Estimates that could not be corrected by these methods
excluded. To assess the impact of correction, we calculated the absolute difference between
seroprevalence estimates before and after correction. We also conducted a sensitivity analysis for
each analysis with uncorrected data.

2.4.2 Global seroprevalence and associated factors
To examine study-level factors affecting general population seroprevalence estimates, we
constructed a multivariable linear meta-regression model, using the meta package in R.24 The
outcome variable was the natural logarithm of corrected seroprevalence. Independent predictors
were defined a priori. Categorical covariates were encoded as indicator variables, and included:
study risk of bias (reference: low risk of bias), GBD region (reference: high-income); geographic
scope (reference: national); and population sampled (reference: household and community
samples). The sole continuous covariate was days since the 100th confirmed case in the country
of the study. A quantile-quantile plot and a funnel plot were generated to visually check
normality and homoscedasticity.

2.4.3 Population differences in seroprevalence
To quantify population differences in SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence, we identified subgroup
estimates within general population studies that stratified by sex/gender, race/ethnicity, exposure
level, occupation, and age groups. We calculated prevalence ratios for each study (e.g.,
prevalence in males vs. females) and aggregated the ratios across studies using inverse varianceweighted random-effects meta-analysis (Supplementary File 4). Heterogeneity was quantified
using the I² statistic.25

2.4.4 Comparisons of seroprevalence and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections
To measure how much confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections underestimate seroprevalence, we
calculated the ratio between seroprevalence estimates of the general population and the
cumulative incidence of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections. We obtained data on total
confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections26,27 and population size28 that geographically matched the

We conducted sensitivity analyses using case data from zero and fourteen days before study end

3. Results
3.1 Distribution and characteristics of serosurveys
We screened 16,899 titles and abstracts and 1,556 full text articles (Figure 1). We identified 338
unique seroprevalence studies in 281 articles. These studies included 2,305,376 participants and
3,443 seroprevalence estimates.
Of the included studies, 184 (54%) targeted the general population and 154 (46%) targeted
special populations (Table 1). Characteristics of individual studies are reported in Supplementary
Tables 1 and 2. References are listed at the end of the Supplementary materials.
Fifty countries across all GBD regions were represented among identified serosurveys (Figure 2;
Supplementary Figure 1). A minority of studies were conducted in low- and middle-income
countries (n = 86, 25%).
Many studies were at high risk of bias (n = 184, 54%), often for not statistically correcting for
demographics or for test sensitivity and specificity, using non-probability sampling methods, and
using non-representative sample frames (Figure 3, Supplementary Table 3).
3.2 SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence globally
In studies targeting the general population, median corrected seroprevalence was 3.2% [IQR 1.06.4%] (Table 2). These studies included household and community samples (n = 83), residual
sera (n = 39), and blood donors (n = 33), with median corrected seroprevalence of 3.5% [IQR
1.2-8.5%], 2.7% [IQR 1.0-4.3%], and 2.8% [IQR 0.9-6.8%], respectively (Supplementary Table
4). The median corrected seroprevalence in studies targeting specific populations was 5.4%,
[IQR 1.5-18.4%] (Table 3). Notably, the median corrected seroprevalence was 6.3% [IQR 2.118.8%, n = 72 studies] in healthcare workers and caregivers and 6.3% [IQR 2.8-17.8%, n = 21
studies] in specific patient groups (e.g., cancer patients). Essential non-healthcare workers (e.g.,
first responders) had a median seroprevalence of 10.0% [IQR 1.8-26.3%, n=7 studies]
(Supplementary Table 4).
Among high-income countries, the median corrected seroprevalence was 3.4% [IQR 1.3-6.3%].
In the low- and middle-income GBD regions, median corrected seroprevalence ranged from

3.3 Differences in seroprevalence by demographic characteristics
There were significant within-study differences in seroprevalence based on age, race/ethnicity,
status as healthcare worker, and contact exposure (Table 4). There was no difference in the risk
of infection based on sex/gender. Results for uncorrected prevalence estimates are reported in

3.4 Impact of serology assay sensitivity and specificity on seroprevalence findings
Tests that have been independently evaluated were used in 145 studies (42.9%; Supplementary
Table 6). Test sensitivity and specificity were reported in 185 studies (54.7%), with sensitivity
ranging from 37-100% and specificity from 85-100%. Only 69 studies (20.4%) corrected
seroprevalence estimates for test sensitivity and specificity.
We corrected seroprevalence estimates from 254 studies (75.1%) for imperfect sensitivity and
specificity, and used author-corrected estimates in 30 (8.9%) studies where uncorrected estimates
were unavailable. Data were insufficient to correct estimates from 48 studies (14.2%). The

median absolute difference between corrected and uncorrected seroprevalence estimates was
1.2% [IQR 0.4-3.1%].
3.5 Factors affecting seroprevalence
On multivariable meta-regression, studies at low risk of bias reported lower corrected
seroprevalence estimates relative to moderate risk of bias studies (prevalence ratio 0.38x, 95%
CI 0.19-0.73) and high risk of bias studies (0.44x, 95% CI 0.21-0.89) times estimates from
studies at moderate and high risk of bias, respectively (Supplementary Table 7). Blood donors
and residual sera groups, both used as proxies for the general population, reported significantly
lower corrected seroprevalence estimates compared to household and community samples (blood
donors: 0.64x, 95% CI 0.42-0.98; residual sera: 0.63x, 95% CI 0.41-0.96). National studies
reported similar seroprevalence estimates to regional studies (0.98x, 95% CI 0.66-1.46), but
lower estimates than local (0.59x, 95% CI 0.38-0.91) and sublocal studies (0.45x, 95% CI 0.151.33). Finally, compared to high-income countries, countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (2.92x, 95%
CI 1.00-8.50) reported higher seroprevalence estimates, while countries in Southeast Asia, East
Asia, and Oceania (0.49x, 95% CI 0.11-0.39) and Latin America and Caribbean (0.50x, 95% CI
0.30-0.81) reported lower seroprevalence estimates. Visual checks confirmed that model
assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity were met.
3.6 Seroprevalence to cumulative incidence ratio
The median ratio between corrected seroprevalence estimates and the corresponding cumulative
incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 14.5 (IQR 8.2 - 39.7, n = 125 studies; Figure 4). This
ratio was higher for estimates from local studies (median 24.0, IQR 8.4 - 47.9, n=44 studies) than
national studies (median 11.9, IQR 8.0 - 16.6, n=40 studies) and regional studies (median 15.7,
7.9-55.5, n=41 studies). Using the cumulative incidence on the same day as the serosurvey end
date (11.9 [IQR 6.0 – 24.2]) and 14 days (16.9 IQR 9.2 – 56.7] prior yielded similar results
(Supplementary Figures 2, 3).

4. Discussion
This systematic review and meta-analysis provides an overview of global SARS-CoV-2
seroprevalence based on data from 2,305,376 participants in 338 serosurveys from 281 reports.
Seroprevalence remains low in the general population (median 3.2%, IQR 1.0-6.4%), with
slightly higher seroprevalence in at-risk populations (e.g., health care workers, specific patient
groups, and essential non-healthcare workers; median 5.4%, IQR 1.5-18.4%).

Seroprevalence varied considerably between GBD regions after correcting for study
characteristics and test sensitivity and specificity. Given the limited evidence for altitude or
climate effects on SARS-CoV-2 transmission32, variations likely reflect differences in
community transmission and public health responses. Stakeholders should carefully review the
infection control measures implemented in Southeast Asia, East Asia, and Oceania, as well as
Latin America and the Caribbean, as they appear to have been effective at limiting SARS-CoV-2
transmission.

Our results suggest clear population differences in SARS-CoV-2 burden, with marginalized and
high-risk groups disproportionately affected. Differences in infection risk based on race might be
attributed to crowding, higher-risk occupation roles (e.g., front-line service jobs) and other
systemic inequities. Our review further found that health care workers and individuals who had
close contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases had a higher risk of seropositivity, consistent with
previous reports.33 Some of these groups (Black, Asian, and minority ethnic) are also known to
have higher infection fatality rates.34,35 Such differences may inform enrolment in vaccine
clinical trials and policy on vaccine distribution.

Disproportionately few studies (25%) have been conducted in low- and middle-income countries.
Results from the ongoing WHO Unity studies will help to bridge this knowledge gap and inform
an equitable plan for global vaccine distribution. Similarly, even in high income countries, only a
handful of studies have targeted people experiencing homelessness or continuing care facility
residents and staff, despite their heightened risk for SARS-CoV-2 transmission and poor health
outcomes.36,37

Nearly half (n = 77; 42%) of studies examining SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in the general
population used blood from donors and residual sera as a proxy. Our results showed that these
studies report seroprevalence estimates that are 40% lower than studies of household and
community-based samples. It has previously been shown that these groups contain
disproportionate numbers of people that are young, White, college graduates, employed,
physically active, and never-smokers.38,39 Investigators using these proxy sampling frames
should ensure robust correction for demographic differences or consider incorporating a
correction factor (1.67x) to yield more representative estimates.

Systematic reviews of SARS-CoV-2 serological test accuracy have found that many tests have
poor sensitivity and specificity.15,16 Of the studies included here, only 69 (20.4%) corrected for
test sensitivity and specificity - fewer than the 84 (24.9%) serosurveys which failed altogether to
report identifying information for test used. Our study corrected seroprevalence estimates for test
sensitivity and specificity. The median absolute difference between corrected and uncorrected
estimates was 1.2% — a substantial change, given that the median corrected seroprevalence
reported in general population studies was 3.2%. This difference emphasizes the importance of
conducting such corrections to minimize bias in serosurvey data.
Seroprevalence estimates were 14.5 times higher than the corresponding cumulative incidence of
COVID-19 infections. Within countries, there are substantial differences in seroprevalence
between national studies and local studies. This study reports the new finding that there is more
pronounced under-ascertainment when data from local seroprevalence studies are used (24.0
local vs. 11.9 national vs. 15.7 regional). This may be because many local studies have been
conducted in hot-spot regions, where transmission overwhelmed diagnostic testing capacity. This
level of under-ascertainment suggests that confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections are an especially
poor indicator of the true extent of infection burden in these hot-spot areas, and emphasizes the
importance of interpreting seroprevalence findings in context and accounting for geographic
scope.
Seroprevalence to cumulative case ratios provide a roadmap for public health authorities by
identifying regions, countries, and locales that may be receiving potentially insufficient levels of
testing. These ratios are also valuable for estimating true infection rates from test-confirmed

infection counts in intervals between seroprevalence studies. Applying the 11.9x ratio for
national studies to the number of confirmed infections suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may have
already infected 643 million people globally, rather than the 54 million reported as of November
17, 2020 — and that the recent global surge may involve 7.1 million new infections each day, as
opposed to the 600,000 test-confirmed infections being reported.1

Our study has limitations. Firstly, some asymptomatic individuals may not seroconvert and some
individuals may have been tested prior to seroconversion, so the data in this study may
underestimate the true number of SARS-CoV-2 infections.40 To ameliorate this, we prioritized
estimates that tested for IgG antibodies, which show better persistence in serum compared to
non-IgG and anti-nucleocapsid antibodies.15–20 Secondly, to account for measurement error in
seroprevalence estimates resulting from poorly performing tests, it was necessary to use
sensitivity and specificity information from multiple sources of varying quality. While we
prioritized independent evaluations, these were not available for all tests. Thirdly, the residual
heterogeneity in our meta-regression indicates that not all relevant explanatory variables have
been accounted for. There may be other factors that confound the associations we identified in
our analysis. However, a key driving factor may simply be true differences in spread of infection
and impact of the pandemic. Finally, we were only able to incorporate cumulative case incidence
published on national, regional, or local government dashboards. This may have systematically
excluded areas too under-resourced to conduct or report mass diagnostic testing.

Our systematic review is the largest synthesis of SARS-CoV-2 serosurveillance data to date. Our
search was rigorous and comprehensive: we included non-English articles, government reports
and unpublished data, and serosurveillance reports obtained via expert recommendations and our
SeroTracker website. This comprehensive search is important because many serosurveys —
especially in LMICs — have not been published or released as preprints. This is the first
systematic review and meta-analysis to correct prevalence estimates for test sensitivity and
specificity, revealing that imperfect sensitivity and specificity have major effects on
seroprevalence findings. Furthermore, our synthesis accounts for study scope, enabling us to
identify gaps between case incidence and serologic testing at different geographic levels and
suggesting a need to increase testing capacity in many jurisdictions. To our knowledge, this is

the first study to systematically compare seroprevalence estimates from blood donors, residual
sera, and household and community-based general population samples. Finally, this study is part
of a regularly-updated systematic review, and summary results will continue to be disseminated
throughout the pandemic on a publicly available website (SeroTracker.com).9

Serosurveillance efforts so far have mostly taken the form of formal studies led by academic
institutions. This approach makes sense for the current role that serosurveys play - to monitor the
true burden of infection and identify high-risk groups. However, as vaccines are deployed, the
value of serosurveys will likely shift towards measuring population antibody titres as a correlate
of protection, and evaluating vaccine effectiveness in the real world. Going forward,
serosurveillance efforts may better serve end-users if they take the form of real-time monitoring
programs housed in public health units. Leaders who can pair vaccine distribution data with live
serosurveys will be well-equipped to track the outcomes of vaccination efforts in their
communities in real time.

Our review shows that SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence remains low in the general population,
indicating that many people remain susceptible to infection and suggesting that naturally-derived
herd immunity is not achievable without substantial morbidity, mortality, and strain on health
services. These findings also highlight the importance of remaining vigilant until effective vaccines
are broadly available. There are clear population differences in SARS-CoV-2 burden, with certain

marginalized (Black and Asian persons) and at-risk populations (health care workers, essential
non-health care workers, specific patient groups, close contacts) disproportionately affected.
Policy and decision makers need to better protect these groups to reduce inequity in the
distribution and impact of COVID-19. Such differences may inform policy on vaccine
distribution.
As the COVID-19 pandemic progresses and serology data accumulate, ongoing evidence
synthesis is needed to inform public health policy. We will continue to update our systematic
review and seroprevalence dashboard to help address this need.
