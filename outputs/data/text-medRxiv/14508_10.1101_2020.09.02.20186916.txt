Abstract

16

Background: Test-trace-isolate programs are an essential part of COVID-19 control that
o↵er a more targeted approach than many other non-pharmaceutical interventions. E↵ective
use of such programs requires methods to estimate their current and anticipated impact.

Methods and Findings: We present a mathematical modeling framework to evaluate the
expected reductions in the reproductive number, R, from test-trace-isolate programs. This
framework is implemented in a publicly available R package and an online application. We
evaluated the e↵ects of case detection, speed of isolation, contact tracing completeness and
speed of quarantine using parameters consistent with COVID-19 transmission (R0 = 2.5,
generation time 6.5 days). We show that R is most sensitive to changes to the proportion of
infections detected in almost all scenarios, and other metrics have a reduced impact when
case detection levels are low (< 30%). Although test-trace-isolate programs can contribute
substantially to reducing R, exceptional performance across all metrics is needed to bring R
below one through test-trace-isolate alone, highlighting the need for comprehensive control
strategies. Formally framing the dynamical process also indicates that metrics used to
evaluate performance of test-trace-isolate, such as the proportion of identified infections
among traced contacts, may be misleading. While estimates of program performance are
sensitive to assumptions about COVID-19 natural history, our qualitative findings are robust
across numerous sensitivity analyses.

test-trace-isolate programs are an important tool for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic,
and can alleviate the need for more restrictive social distancing measures.

38

Introduction

39

In the absence of a vaccine or a widely-available prophylactic drug, non-pharmaceutical inter-

40

ventions are the only tools available to curb the spread of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

41

During the initial phases of the pandemic, broad-reaching interventions like stay-at-home orders

42

and non-essential business closures were applied throughout the world, a↵ecting large swathes

43

of the population and causing severe social and economic disruption [1–6].

44

Because of the high costs of broad scale social distancing measures, there has been an

45

increasing focus on alternative approaches with fewer ancillary costs. One such approach is a

46

test-trace-isolate program, in which extensive testing is used to identify cases in the community;

47

public health agencies then trace the contacts of these cases in order to identify people who may

48

have been infected; and the initial cases are asked to isolate and their contacts are asked to

49

quarantine for the period of time that they could be, or become, infectious [7]. If e↵ective, test-

50

trace-isolate programs can reduce the need for more restrictive, widespread control measures.

51

Already they have played a critical role in controlling SARS-CoV-2 transmission in places

52

ranging from Utah to South Korea, where these programs have been credited with enabling

53

successful control while avoiding the most restrictive social distancing measures (e.g., stay-at-

54

home orders) [8–11].

55

Not all test-trace-isolate programs are created equal, and the success of test-trace-isolate

56

programs is ultimately measured in their ability to reduce transmission. The proportion of

57

infections identified through testing and contact tracing dictate the proportion of transmission

58

chains we can potentially disrupt, while the speed of isolation and quarantine dictates how

59

many potentially infectious contacts are prevented [12]. The resulting reductions in disease

60

transmission can be quantified and compared by estimating the reproductive number, R, the

61

average number of new infections caused by a single infected individual.

62

Translating test-trace-isolate program metrics into reductions in the reproductive number is

63

not a direct calculation due to feedback loops between control measures and disease transmission

64

dynamics. As a test-trace-isolate program interrupts chains of transmission, it changes the

65

propagation of disease in future generations. Any approach aiming to translate quantitative

66

program metrics into meaningful measures of the e↵ectiveness of disease control must account

67

for these dynamic processes.

68

Here, we propose a mathematical framework for modeling the impact of test-trace-isolate

69

strategies on onward transmission, as measured by expected reductions in the reproductive

70

number. Using this approach, we explore the factors which most influence the success of a

71

test-trace-isolate program, their interactions, and how these results may be used in developing

72

strategies for improvement. To enable broad adoption of our approach, the methods presented

73

here are implemented in an R package, tti [13], and the web-based Contact Tracing Evaluation

74

and Strategic Support Application (ConTESSA) [14], both of which are freely available online.

Methods

76

Mathematical Framework

77

To estimate the e↵ectiveness of a test-trace-isolate program, we frame our analysis in terms

78

of the e↵ective reproductive number, R, defined as the number of onward transmissions an

79

infected individual is expected to make given the current immune status of the population

80

and implemented control measures. We first define the population of infected individuals to

81

be spread across three compartments; infections Detected through testing and subsequently

82

isolated (D), infections among Quarantined contacts of identified cases (Q) and undetected

83

infections in the Community (C) (Figure 1). Though there will be uninfected individuals both

84

in quarantine and in the community, these do not play a role in our calculations and are ignored.

85

We consider the proportion of the population in each compartment at any given time t to be

86

defined by a 1 ⇥ 3 matrix, denoted DQCt . To calculate the proportion of infected individuals in

87

each compartment at time t + 1, we apply the rates at which individuals in each compartment

88

cause new infections, and then the rates at which these secondary infections are detected and

89

isolated through the following equation:
DQCt+1 =

90
91

(DQCt )(IN F ECT )(DET ECT )
P
,
[(DQCt )(IN F ECT )]

(1)

where IN F ECT is a 3 ⇥ 3 diagonal matrix describing the number of infections caused in the

next generation by members of each detection compartment, and DET ECT is a 3 ⇥ 3 matrix

92

describing the probability that infections in the next generation are detected and isolated,

93

quarantined, or undetected in the community.
The diagonal elements of the IN F ECT matrix, [RD , RQ , RC ], represent the reproductive
number for members of each compartment. Hence, given the normalized version of the DQC
matrix specified above, we can calculate the overall reproductive number at time t as:
Rt = (DQCt )(IN F ECT )

94
95

The DET ECT matrix then assigns these new infections to the appropriate detection classes
of the DQC matrix in the next generation. Specifically:

103

The other aspect that determines the e↵ectiveness of a test-trace-isolate program is the

104

reduction in R that we see among those who are isolated or quarantined (Figure 2). We define

105

the relative transmissibility of individuals in these compartments by

The main mechanism by which isolation and quarantine reduce transmission is the (at least

where f (x) is the distribution of relative infectiousness indexed from day of symptom onset;

109

g(x) is the expected distribution of relative infectiousness of secondary cases indexed from their

110

infector’s time of symptom onset; and ⌧D and ⌧Q represent the average time to isolation and

111

quarantine, respectively, from time of case symptom onset.

112

Translating Observed Metrics to Model Inputs

113

Health departments collect data on their test-trace-isolate programs, but these observed metrics

114

need to be translated into model inputs. To estimate isolation completeness (⇢), we can divide

115

the average number of infections that were isolated by the estimated number of total infections

116

in the community. The latter value may be difficult to obtain, but can be approximated in

117

a number of ways, including serosurveys and extrapolation from the number of deaths and

118

approximate infection fatality ratio. Quarantine completeness (!) can be estimated by dividing

119

the number of quarantined individuals by the total number of contacts.

120

For the purposes of our model, time to isolation (⌧D ) is the average number of days from

121

case symptom onset to case isolation, while time to quarantine (⌧Q ) is the average number of

122

days from case symptom onset to contact quarantine. Often these timings are the composite of

123

several constituent processes, including time from symptom onset to testing, time from testing to

124

notification and isolation, and the time from obtaining a test result to tracing and quarantining

125

contacts.

126

Adding real-world complexity to the model

127

Above we describe the basic model framework, but to take into account the complexities of the

128

real world, we can expand the number of compartments in the DQC matrix and the correspond-

129

ing IN F ECT and DET ECT transitions. In the implementation used to generate the results

130

described below, we create compartments to di↵erentiate symptomatic and asymptomatic in-

131

fections as well as household and community contacts to address the fact that these groups

132

may di↵er in their probability and speed of detection, ability to be traced and quarantined,

infectiousness, and risk of being infected.
This expanded model has nine DQC compartments and is described in full in the Supple-

135

mentary Methods.

136

Disease simulation

137

To obtain expected reductions in R, we first initiate the model with a DQC matrix that has

138

only undetected community infections (C = 1). Then we simulate the infection and detection

139

processes across multiple disease generations until equilibrium is achieved in the DQC matrix

140

(this usually occurs in less than ten generations). This equilibrium provides an estimate of

141

what would be achieved by a specified test-trace-isolate strategy if it maintained its current

142

characteristics for the foreseeable future.

143

The model may also be run as a stochastic simulation, to explore the impact of overdisper-

144

sion and stochasticity in the epidemic process in general. In stochastic simulations we normalize

145

the DQC matrix to a standard population size, then simulate the number of infections each

146

individual causes for each notional IN F ECT compartment as a random draw from a negative

147

binomial distribution based on the values in the IN F ECT matrix. These infections are then

148

assigned to the compartments DQC matrix based on draws from a multinomial distribution pa-

149

rameterized by the rows of the DET ECT matrix. Since there is no equilibrium state, stochastic

150

simulations are run for a fixed number of generations.

151

The simulations presented in this paper assume that R0 = 2.5 without interventions, a

152

generation time of 6.5 days (unless otherwise stated, Table S3), and initially, that whether

153

individuals develop symptoms or not has no meaningful impact on transmission or detection

154

probability in surveillance, and that household and community contacts are equally likely to

155

be infected and quarantined. In later analyses, we relax these latter assumptions and add

156

stochasticity to illustrate how our results are influenced by overdispersion in transmission, the

157

presence of asymptomatic transmission, and di↵erential risk of infection and tracing speed in

158

household contacts.

159

Data and model availability

160

The expanded model is implemented in the tti R package [13]. We also developed the Contact

161

Tracing Evaluation and Strategic Support Application (ConTESSA), an R Shiny web applica-

162

tion, around a simplified version of our modeling framework. The purpose of this application is

163

to provide a user-friendly interface where managers of test-trace-isolate activities, equipped with

164

their observed metrics, can examine how well their program reduces onward transmission and

165

explore how their results might change with improvements to completeness and timing metrics

166

as well as di↵erent underlying assumptions. The ConTESSA application is complemented by

167

a free Coursera course that describes key contact tracing program metrics and provides more

168

detailed instruction on how to use the application [15].

Results

170

Case isolation and contact quarantine completeness and timing

171

Application of our framework shows that the reproductive number can be reduced by improving

172

performance across all dimensions of a test-trace-isolate program: detection and isolation com-

173

pleteness, the speed of case isolation, the proportion of contacts followed up and quarantined,

174

and the speed at which quarantine occurs (Figure 3). However, the e↵ect of improvements in

175

one dimension are not independent of performance in the other dimensions, and as such, the

176

aspect where improvements will yield the greatest dividends, the ”next best move”, depends on

177

the current status of the program.

178

Consider a situation where you only detect and isolate 10% of cases through your community

179

testing program, and it takes an average of seven days from symptom onset to do so (squares

180

in Figure 3). Whether you have highly e↵ective contact tracing (70% of contacts quarantined

181

on average 4 days after case symptom onset, hollow shapes in Figure 3) or less e↵ective contact

182

tracing (30% quarantined on average 8 days after case symptom onset, solid shapes in Figure

183

3), little will be gained by improving the speed of case isolation, and the greatest reductions in

184

transmission will be achieved by improving the proportion of infections detected and isolated

185

(direction 1 in 3A). Increasing the proportion of infections detected and isolated, regardless of

186

other metrics, is critical because it is these detected cases that “seed” all other test-trace-isolate

187

activities. If an infection is not detected, it cannot be isolated, and their contacts cannot be

188

traced and quarantined.

189

Reducing the time to case isolation (direction 2 in Figure 3A) may be nearly as e↵ective as

190

improving case isolation completeness in certain contexts, in particular, if contact tracing is less

191

e↵ective and isolation completeness is reasonably high (over 30%). Because the vast majority of

192

transmission occurs in the days immediately before and after symptom onset, improvements in

193

the speed of case isolation that bring it to four days or fewer will yield the greatest reductions

194

in transmission. Beyond this, there is limited opportunity to reduce onward transmission of

195

the isolated case and thus little di↵erence between delays of 6, 8, or 10 days. Increasing the

196

speed of case isolation is particularly important when contact tracing is ine↵ective (Figure 3B),

197

hence the program must rely predominantly on reductions in transmission from isolated cases

198

themselves.

199

The benefits of increasing the speed and completeness of contact tracing and quarantine are

200

greatest in the context of already highly e↵ective testing and isolation (e.g., 50% of infections

201

isolated on average 4 days after symptom onset, circles in Figure 3D). In such situations,

202

increasing quarantine completeness yields the largest reductions in transmission (direction 3 in

203

Figure 3D), particularly when the speed of contact quarantine is less than 8 days from case

204

symptom onset.

205

Improvements in the speed of contact quarantine (direction 4 in Figure 3D) are most e↵ective

206

during the 4-8 day window after case symptom onset for similar reasons; this period corresponds

207

to the greatest expected infectiousness of infected contacts. The impact of improvements in the

208

speed or completeness of contact tracing is less if testing and isolation fail to reach a high

209

percentage of infections (Figure 3E). As noted above, this is because without adequate detected

210

cases to seed contact tracing activities, the ability of tracing and quarantine to have an impact

211

is substantially reduced.

212

The completeness and timing of test-trace-isolate activities determine whether we can achieve

213

goals in disease control using these approaches. A common goal is to bring R below one so that

214

the epidemic will start to recede in the population. We explored the range of program charac-

215

teristics that could achieve this goal, under the assumption that contacts were quarantined on

216

the same day as case isolation, and quarantine completeness ranged from 50-100% (Figure 4).

217

At R = 2.5 (our baseline when no other interventions are in place) with perfect contact

218

quarantine, at least 60% of cases must be isolated to achieve R < 1; this minimum percentage

219

decreases to 50% when starting at R = 2, 34% at R = 1.5, and 20% at R = 1.25 (corresponding

220

to 20%, 40%, and 50% reductions in baseline R due to other interventions) (Figure 4). It is not

221

possible to achieve R < 1 if case isolation occurs more than 8.0 days after symptom onset, on

222

average, and this threshold increases to 9, 11, and 13 days for R starting at 2, 1.5, and 1.25.

223

Quarantine need not be perfect to achieve R < 1 (colors in Figure 4), but the tolerance for

224

imperfect quarantine changes with isolation speed. For example, case isolation completeness

225

needs to only increase from 60% to 63% to o↵set a decrease in contact quarantine completeness

226

from 100% to 50% when cases are isolated on the same day as symptom onset. However, this

227

tolerance for incomplete quarantine rapidly degrades as the time to isolation increases, and, in

228

the absence of other interventions (i.e., R = 2.5), no isolation program will achieve R < 1 with

229

50% quarantine completeness if the average time to case isolation exceeds 2.6 days.

230

Infections arising in traced contacts

231

A metric often recommended for evaluating test-trace-isolate programs is the proportion of iden-

232

tified infections that were already under quarantine [7]. Programs are thought to be successful

233

if this metric is high because it may indicate that a substantial fraction of transmission chains

234

were interrupted through isolation of case contacts early in (or prior to) their infectious period.

235

In practice, a program might approximate this by calculating the proportion of all newly de-

236

tected infections among traced contacts, who may or may not be in quarantine when they are

237

confirmed to be infected. This proportion is equivalent to

Q
Q+D

in our model.

238

An increasing proportion of new infections detected among traced contacts only represents

239

an improvement in the program e↵ectiveness if the timing of case isolation remains constant or

240

becomes quicker. As delays in isolation increase, a greater number of secondary infections will

241

occur among traced contacts. Hence, we can see both an increase in the proportion of newly

242

detected infections among traced contacts and an increase in the e↵ective reproductive number

243

(direction ‘2‘ in Figure 5).

244

Adding real-world complexity to transmissibility and risk

245

In the sections above, we assume that all infected individuals are equally likely to transmit and

246

be detected. Yet, there is evidence that asymptomatic individuals (those who never develop

247

symptoms) are less infectious than those who do develop symptoms [16, 17]. If the relative

248

contribution of asymptomatic individuals to onward transmission is low, limited detection of

249

asymptomatic cases will have little e↵ect on the reproductive number (Figure S1).

Figure 5: Relationship between R and the proportion of detected infections among traced
contacts. Each position along a line shows a single test-trace-isolate strategy, with a fixed
delay from case symptom onset to isolation (shown in the numbers at the top) and 90% of
contacts quarantined on the same day as case isolation. Points are colored by the proportion
of infections detected and isolated through testing. When isolation timing remains constant,
higher case isolation completeness corresponds with increases in the proportion of detected
infections among traced contacts and reductions in R (Arrow 1). However, increases in the
proportion of detected infections among traced contacts could indicate an increase in R, if the
delay to case isolation is also increasing, thus leading to more secondary cases among traced
contacts (Arrow 2).

250

Similarly, previous scenarios assume that all contacts are equally at risk of being infected,

251

but contact tracing studies suggest that the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection for household contacts

252

could be six (or more) times higher compared to other close contacts [11, 16]. Quarantining

253

household contacts therefore is expected to have a larger impact in reducing the reproductive

254

number than quarantining non-household contacts (Figure S2).

255

There is growing evidence that the distribution of onward transmission for SARS-CoV-2 is

256

overdispersed, meaning that most individuals contribute little to onward transmission, while

257

super-spreading events result in the bulk of secondary infections [18, 19]. Overdispersion has

258

little e↵ect on the mean estimates of the reproductive number (Figure S3). However, when there

259

are few total infections in a community, the random occurrence or detection of any one super-

260

spreading event can drastically alter program impact, including ending an outbreak altogether,

261

thereby increasing uncertainty in R.

262

Sensitivity Analyses

263

The above results are sensitive to assumptions about the infectious period and generation time

264

of SARS-CoV-2. While the qualitative trends and relationships hold regardless, assumptions

265

of a shorter generation time substantially increase the necessary speed at which activities must

266

occur to have a meaningful impact (Figures S4 - S8).

267

Discussion

268

Test-trace-isolate programs have the potential to play an important role in COVID-19 control,

269

but the extent of that role depends on each program’s ability to limit transmission of the

270

virus. Here, we have presented a modeling framework with which to evaluate the performance

271

of test-trace-isolate programs, and shown how four key metrics of performance interact. The

272

results show that a program’s ability to detect cases through community testing is one of the

273

greatest drivers of program e↵ectiveness, as it is these cases that seed all other activities. Rapid

274

case isolation, complete contact tracing, and timely quarantine will compound the impact that

275

identifying a new seed will have on the trajectory of the epidemic. Nevertheless, exceptional

276

performance may be needed across all of these dimensions if transmission is to be controlled by

277

test-trace-isolate alone, raising the importance of complementary control activities.

278

Previous work has emphasized the importance of decreasing delays to case isolation and

279

contact quarantine to reduce disease transmission [20, 21]. However, these models assumed

280

high testing and isolation coverage (

281

of an outbreak, but far exceeding estimated infection detection rates in many locations with

282

established epidemics [22–25]. Here, we explore a broader range of case detection and isolation

283

proportions, including values that may be more feasibly attained in areas with substantial

284

incidence. In doing so, we show the critical importance of the proportion of cases detected.

60%), levels perhaps attainable in the early or late stages

285

Once adequate levels of detection are reached, the speed of case isolation and contact quar-

286

antine will begin to matter more. In practice, these delays are linked, as many of the same

287

activities must be completed before isolation or quarantine can occur (e.g., sample collection,

288

laboratory testing, contact of infected or exposed individuals). Hence, practical improvements

289

in important aspects of a test-trace-isolate program, such as speed of laboratory testing, may

290

have an outsized impact on the performance of the program overall.

291

These results have implications for the design and implementation of test-trace-isolate pro-

292

grams. The ability to identify and interrupt a high proportion of transmission chains will require

293

investment in widespread testing. Population screening, in addition to symptom-based or at-will

294

testing, could meaningfully improve a program’s impact on transmission. Inexpensive, easy to

295

administer, and widely available tests could facilitate expanded detection e↵orts [26, 27]. Even

296

if such tests have lower sensitivity, the higher coverage attainable could result in detection of a

297

higher percentage of infections [28]. Importantly, these improvements to testing capacity and

298

access must be available to those populations most impacted by COVID-19 and not exacerbate

299

existing testing disparities. If we increase testing coverage, but fail to reach those who are at

300

highest risk for infection, there will be little impact on transmission.

301

Any increases in case detection will be ine↵ective if isolation and quarantine fail to interrupt

302

transmission. To some extent, this can be counteracted by improvements to other aspects of a

303

program (e.g., proportion of cases detected), but measures to facilitate e↵ective isolation and

304

quarantine may be needed to reach transmission control goals. Given the high risk of household

305

transmission, measures that can intervene in these settings may be highly important. Facilities

306

for isolation outside of the household were associated with substantial reductions in R in China

307

[29]. Use of facial coverings has also been proven e↵ective at reducing household transmission

308

for SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses [30–32]. Social and economic support for isola-

309

tion and quarantine, particularly if outside the home, may be necessary for test-trace-isolate

310

programs to be e↵ective in many communities [7]. Technology, such as use of mobile phone data

311

to identify contacts, may improve the speed and completeness of contact tracing, but compli-

312

ance may be undermined if contact definitions are too broad, and substantial resources would

313

still be required to initiate and support quarantine of identified contacts [33, 34].

314

The case isolation and contact quarantine completeness metrics used in our model may be

315

better conceptualized as the proportion of onward transmission that would have been otherwise

316

caused by those isolated or quarantined. Thus, programs will see greater reductions in trans-

317

mission from isolation or quarantine of those who are more likely to transmit. In the expanded

318

version of our model, we already address di↵erences between symptomatic and asymptomatic

319

transmission and household versus community contacts. There may be programmatic reasons

320

to specifically target other groups, and our basic framework could be extended to accommodate

321

such strategies.

322

Our framework is not without limitations. This model describes a general strategy of tracing

323

and quarantining the immediate contacts of identified cases in a community. It may not be

324

easily extensible to settings such as schools or workplaces. Alternative strategies also exist,

325

including tracing of contacts-of-contacts [35], and so-called backwards tracing [36]. The latter

326

approach is part of a fundamentally di↵erent way of using contact tracing in disease control

327

that has been used in COVID-19 response in some countries (e.g., Japan [37]), which focuses

328

on identifying settings that have the potential to facilitate super-spreading events or otherwise

329

amplify transmission. Our estimates of program e↵ectiveness are sensitive to assumptions of

330

disease natural history, though we have explored the impact of some of these assumptions

331

(Figures S4 - S8), and further exploration are possible. The model relies on a simplified version

332

of transmission that does not account for many risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection or the

333

contact structure in the population [35, 38], which could lead to persistent transmission even

334

when the population reproductive number is low. While the reproductive number is a useful

335

representation of transmission control at the population level, it does not capture di↵erential

336

health burden of infections, and a program could have a higher R but better limit mortality if

337

it e↵ectively protects at-risk populations.

338

Test-trace-isolate programs should not alone be used to control COVID-19. It is exceedingly

339

difficult to achieve a reproductive number less than one without additional reductions in trans-

340

mission from other interventions, which may include masking or broad scale social distancing.

341

Likewise, our model is based on proportions, but resource needs are determined by the absolute

342

number of identified cases and traced contacts. When incidence is high, resources needed to

343

test and trace the desired proportion of infections may be excessive, but if incidence is brought

344

down through other control measures, the same targets may be logistically feasible. Still, test-

345

trace-isolate programs need not themselves bring R below one to be valuable, and incremental

346

reductions in transmission can alleviate the need for the most severe social distancing measures.

347

Hence, test-trace-isolate isolate programs have a valuable role to play in the COVID-19 re-

348

sponse, even if such programs themselves are not the whole solution. Understanding the impact

349

that a program is having, or that would result from investing in better program performance, is

350

critical to the e↵ective use of these programs within a broader control strategy. We hope that

351

the model presented here, which is implemented in publicly available tools, will help facilitate

352

the e↵ective use of these programs in the COVID-19 response.
