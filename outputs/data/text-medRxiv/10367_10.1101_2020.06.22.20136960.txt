Abstract

26

The number of new daily infections is one of the main parameters to understand the

27

dynamics of an epidemic. During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, however, such

28

information has been underestimated. Here, we propose a retrospective methodology to

29

estimate daily infections from daily deaths, because those are usually more accurately

30

documented. This methodology is applied to Spain and its 19 administrative regions.

31

Our results showed that probable infections during the first wave were between 35 and

32

42 times more than those officially documented on 14 March, when the national

33

government decreed a national lockdown and 9 times more than those documented by

34

the updated version of the official data. The national lockdown had a strong effect on

35

the growth rate of virus transmission, which began to decrease immediately. Finally, the

36

first inferred infection in Spain is about 43 days before it was officially reported during

37

the first wave. The current official data show delays of 15-30 days in the first infection

38

relative to the inferred infections in 63% of the regions. In summary, we propose a

39

methodology that allows reinterpretation of official daily infections, improving data

40

accuracy in infection magnitude and dates because it assimilates valuable information

41

from the National Seroprevalence Studies.

1. Introduction

55
56

The key parameter to understand and model the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic

57

is the number of daily infections. Despite its importance, however, it is difficult to

58

estimate reliable data due to the bias in official figures1. For symptomatic patients, there

59

are delays of 5.79 days from infection to symptom onset and 5.82 days from symptom

60

onset to diagnosis2. In addition, the presence of asymptomatic people and those with

61

mild symptoms hinder their detection. For example, 86% of infections were undetected

62

in Wuhan, China, prior to 23 January 2020, when travel restrictions were imposed3.

63

Additionally, not all patients with COVID-19 compatible symptoms are tested,

64

especially at the beginning of the pandemic. So, it is widely assumed that the reported

65

infections are just a fraction of the actual ones. In Spain, a National Seroprevalence

66

Study based on ~55,000 random participants estimated that only 10.7% (CI 95%:

67

10.1%-11.3%) of the actual infections had been detected during the first wave (before

68

22 June 2020) in Spain4, 5.

69
70

Another problem is the inconsistency of daily infection time series and the variability of

71

the case definitions. For example, on 13 January 2020, China changed the parameters to

72

confirm new cases and ~15,000 new infections were counted in a single day, while

73

daily infections during the previous week were less than 3,5006. In Spain, the method of

74

counting official numbers of infections has been modified several times since the
3

75

pandemic was decreed. On 22 April 2020, a total of 213,024 cases were reported from

76

positive PCR and antibody tests7; however, total cases decreased to 202,990 the next

77

day and thereafter, because only positive PCRs were included in the total cases8.

78

Accumulated cases on a given day are obtained by adding the new cases that day to the

79

accumulated cases of the previous day. That has not always been the method, however,

80

because some Spanish regions reviewed and modified the cases in previous days9,10.

81

This inconsistency of time series hampers any kind of accurate analysis. Additionally,

82

data are continuously being updated. In Spain, official daily infection data available

83

during the first wave reported 1,832 new infected on 14 March 2020, but current official

84

data (as downloaded in February 2021) reported 7,478 new cases for the same date.

85
86

High fidelity time series of each parameter of an epidemic are crucial to run reliable

87

epidemiological models. The number of new infections per unit time is one of the

88

essential parameters. The official data do not reflect the actual day of infection nor the

89

real number of infections. To overcome this limitation, we propose a retrospective

90

methodology to infer daily infections from daily deaths, believing the number of deaths

91

to be a more reliable parameter than the official number of daily infections1. These

92

estimated infections are closer to the date of infection, avoiding delays from the

93

incubation period and symptom onset to diagnosis. Then, the time series of daily

94

infections would help to better understand the pandemic dynamics and to quantify the

95

effectiveness of the different control strategies, avoiding the bias of the official data. In

96

addition, those numbers can be used to feed epidemiological models with more realistic

97

data. Finally, we will apply this methodology in Spain as a whole and each of its 19

98

administrative regions (17 autonomous communities and 2 autonomous cities).

2. Methods

102
103

2.1 REMEDID

104
105

We named this methodology REMEDID, REtrospective Methodology to Estimate

106

Daily Infections from Deaths and it is described as follows. Date of infection (DI) of an

107

individual may be estimated from the death date (DD) by subtracting the incubation

108

period (IP) and illness onset to death (IOD) periods, hence

109
110

DI + IP + IOD = DD.

111
112

Therefore, DI can be estimated from DD as far as IP and DD are known; however,

113

neither IP nor IOD are fixed values. On the contrary, they are random variables that can

114

be approximated by probability distributions. From dozens of cases in Wuhan, Linton et

115

al.11 approximated IP for COVID-19 with a lognormal distribution, XIP, with a mean of

116

5.6 days and median of 5 days, and IOD with a lognormal distribution, XIOD, with a

117

mean of 14.5 days and median of 13.2 days. Therefore, the infection to death period is a

118

random variable, XIP+IOD, that follows the distribution XIP + XIOD.

119
120

Although the addition of two lognormal distributions does not follow any commonly

121

used probability distribution, its probability density function (PDF) can be estimated

122

convolving the PDF of the two variables12. If g(t) and h(t) are the PDF of IP and IOD,

123

respectively, then their convolution defines the PDF of XIP+IOD,

where t0 is a positive real number representing days from infection. Then, f(t) is the PDF

126

of the time from infection to death, with a mean of 20.1 days and a median of 18.8 days.

127

Figure 1 shows g(t), h(t), and f(t), as well as a lognormal PDF with the same mean and

128

median as f(t) for comparison. Note that the probability that XIP+IOD is less than or equal

129

to 33 days is 0.95.

130
131

[Figure 1]

132
133

Given a time series of deaths produced by the illness, x(t), we estimate the infection

134

time series that produced such deaths, y(t). If we assume a case fatality ratio (CFR) of

135

100%, y(t) would represent all daily infections. To calculate y(t), we use the following

136

likelihood-based estimation procedure.

137
138

Because the relative likelihood that a given infection will produce a death t days later is

139

f(t), the infections at a given time t0 can be estimated as

In practice, x(t) is a discrete time series and could be written as x(n), where n is an

Ministry of Health, Social Services and Equality. Time series for the 19 regions of

166

Spain can be downloaded from the national organization that compiles and publishes

167

the data from all regions, the Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII;

168

https://covid19.isciii.es/). For consistency, time series for Spain were estimated by

169

adding the time series of the 19 regions. The final access to infections from official data

170

was on 16 February 2021 (hereafter referred as IO21). Those data have been greatly

171

improved with respect to the daily situation reports published by CCAES during the

172

first wave in the first semester of 2020 (hereafter referred as IO20;

173

https://www.mscbs.gob.es/profesionales/saludPublica/ccayes/alertasActual/nCov-

174

China/situacionActual.htm). For example, IO20 cases were given the date of diagnosis,

175

whereas IO21 cases were given the date at symptoms onset. When the latter was not

176

available, it was estimated as follows: infections prior to 10 May 2020 were given the

177

diagnosis date minus 6 days, whereas since 11 May 2020 only 3 days were subtracted

178

from the date of diagnosis. Asymptomatic cases were given the diagnosis date. These

179

corrections brought reported cases closer to the real infection dates, although they were

180

still delayed by the length of the incubation period. In addition, re-evaluation of the

181

suspicious case of the first infectee on 20 February 2020 in IO20 gave it the date of 1

182

January 2020 in IO21. The first official death was reported on 13 February 2020.

183

However, no deaths were reported until 3 March 2020 and afterwards deaths were

184

continuously reported. Then, time spans we considered for IO21 is from 1 January 2020

185

to 29 November 2020 and for official daily deaths from 3 March 2020 to 1 January

186

2021, specifically with 33 extra days as required to apply the REMEDID methodology.

187
188

When applying REMEDID the use of a reliable CFR is essential. Thus, to determine a

189

realistic CFR in Spain, we used the total infections data from the longitudinal

190

seroprevalence study conducted by ISCIII in 4 phases. The first three phases were

191

completed from 27 April to 22 June and the results were published on 6 July 20204, 5. In

192

this longitudinal cohort study, ~68,000 people were randomly selected and ~55,000 of

193

them agreed to be interviewed and tested in the three phases. The study found that 5.2%

194

(CI 95%: 4.9%-5.5%) of the participants presented SARS-Cov2 IgG antibodies.

195

Extrapolation of this result to the ~47 million of the population in Spain yielded 2.45

196

million infections until 22 June, which, with 29,674 accumulated COVID-19 deaths on

197

22 June, would give a CFR of 1.21% (CI 95%: 1.15%-1.29%). We assumed this value

198

in our analysis for Spain until 22 June. The fourth phase of the study was completed

199

from 16 to 29 November 2020 and the results published on 15 December 202014. In that

200

study, ~51,000 people agreed to participate. The study found that 9.9% (CI 95%: 9.4%-

201

10.4%) of the participants presented SARS-Cov2 IgG antibodies at any of the four

202

phases. Then, there were 4.75 millions of accumulated infections in Spain, meaning

203

2.30 million new infections from 23 June to 29 November. Because there were 47,113

204

accumulated COVID-19 deaths on 29 November (17,439 new deaths from 23 June), it

205

would give a CFR of 0.76% (CI 95%: 0.71%-0.81%). Thus, we assumed different CFRs

206

for the different periods, in order to smooth the discontinuity effects, we propose a CFR

207

time series segmentation as follows: i) a constant value of 1.21% from 1 January to 22

208

June 2020, ii) a constant value of 0.76% from 30 June to 29 November 2020, and iii) a

209

linear function from 23 June to 28 June that would correspond to the interpolation of the

210

CFR values for 22 June and 29 June. The CFRs of each region were estimated

211

analogously (summarized in Tables 1 and 2). Prior to 22 June, Asturias, Castilla – La

212

Mancha, Castilla y León, Extremadura, País Vasco, and La Rioja had CFRs greater than

213

1.5%. In contrast, Andalucía, Canarias, Melilla, and Murcia had CFRs less than 0.7%.

214

After 22 June, the CFR for Spain diminished in 0.45%, probably due to improved

215

medical treatments and experience gained during the first wave. In this period, the

216

number of regions with a CFR below 0.7% increased to 10 and those with a CFR

217

greater than 1.5% decreased to 3. Most of the regions revealed certain improvement,

218

particularly remarkable was La Rioja, with a CFR decrease from 3.13% to 1.12%.

221

2.2.b. Excess of expected deaths from MoMo

222
223

Expected deaths from any cause, with an error band representing a 99% confidence

224

interval, are modelled by the Mortality Monitoring (MoMo) surveillance system for 22

225

countries in Europe (www.euromomo.eu). In Spain, MoMo depends on the ISCIII15 and

226

data are available at

227

https://momo.isciii.es/public/momo/dashboard/momo_dashboard.html#nacional. MoMo

228

also collects daily deaths from any cause from the Spanish Instituto Nacional de

229

Estadística (INE) and the notaries and civil registries. Daily deaths within the error

230

estimates of the expected deaths are considered usual. Any deviation allows

231

identification of unusual mortality patterns, as for the COVID-19 pandemic. The useful

232

variable here is the excess deaths (ED), estimated as the difference between actual and

233

expected deaths. The error band for ED can be estimated from the error band of the

234

expected deaths by subtracting the latter from the actual deaths. Note that ED can show

235

negative values (Figure 2). By cautiously assuming that all significant ED is caused by

236

COVID-19, ED can be used to estimate non-reported COVID-19 deaths. In this case,

237

negative values for ED make no sense and are set to zero. The MoMo time series was

238

downloaded on 16 February 2021 and we considered the period from 3 March 2020

239

(first non-isolated official COVID-19 death) to 1 January 2021.

Given that MoMo ED in Spain was 45,119 (CI 99%: 37,593-55,098) deaths from 3

242

March to 22 June, and 23,612 (CI 99%: 11,356-39,690) from 23 June to 29 November,

243

the CFR for the country estimated similarly as in Section 2.1 was 1.85% (CI 95%:

1.74%-1.96%) prior to 22 June, and 1.02% (CI 95%: 0.97%-1.09%) after 23 June. For

245

each region, the CFRs were estimated similarly and are provided in Tables 1 and 2. In

all cases, we used a piece wise CFR time series segmented as described in Section 2.2a.

3.1. COVID-19 vs. MoMo

251
252

The COVID-19 official deaths and MoMo ED time series overlaped for the period from

253

3 March 2020 to 1 January 2021 for Spain and its 19 regions (Figure 2). In general,

254

there was good agreement between both datasets, meaning that most of MoMo ED were

255

related to COVID-19 deaths. During the first wave, the most important differences were

256

observed in Spain, Madrid, Cataluña, Castilla-La Mancha, and Castilla y León. Before

257

22 June in Spain, MoMo ED showed 15,445 accumulated deaths more than the official

258

COVID-19 deaths, which is beyond the error band. That difference comes basically

259

from the four regions with the largest numbers of deaths (Madrid, Cataluña, Castilla-La

260

Mancha, and Castilla y León). Table 1 shows the accumulated values before 22 June,

261

which were used to estimate the CFR for Spain and its 19 regions according to the third

262

phase of the National Seroprevalence Study4,5. For all regions, the CFR estimated from

263

MoMo ED was larger than the CFR estimated from COVID-19 deaths. In particular,

264

Asturias, Canarias, and Murcia were twice as large. Ceuta and Melilla dramatically

265

increased their CFR from MoMo ED, although that may be biased due to their small

266

populations and numbers of deaths.

267

Similarly, the same variables for the period from 23 June to 29 November 2020 are

268

reported in Table 2. In Spain, MoMo ED showed 6,173 accumulated deaths more than

269

the official COVID-19 deaths. This difference is a third of the difference observed prior

270

to 22 June; because this is within the error band, there was a significant improvement in

271

the detection of COVID-19 deaths in this period. Figure 2 also shows a general

272

agreement between MoMo ED and official COVID-19 deaths time series after the first

273

wave, with the exception of late July and early August. These differences were due to

274

two heat waves that were responsible for at least 25% of the MoMo ED16.

3.2. Infections estimated from COVID-19 deaths

281

To illustrate the delay between official daily infections data and REMEDID estimated

282

daily infections, we applied REMEDID from COVID-19 deaths assuming CFR= 100%.

283

Figure 3 shows the current IO21 and the infections associated with COVID-19 deaths

284

for the first wave. The latter in Spain reached a maximum on 13 March 2020 (Table 3),

285

the day before the national government decreed a state of emergency and national

286

lockdown. Thus, the adopted measures had an immediate effect, which was observed in

287

the official data IO21 7 days later (20 March). This delay is similar to the incubation

288

period (mean 5.78 days2), which could be explained because official infections were

289

earlier version IO20 (not shown), which highlights the usefulness of the methodology to

291

reinterpret official data from very early stages of the pandemic. On the other hand, the

292

maximum number of deaths was reached on 1 April, which was 19 days after the

293

inferred infection maximum, bringing this delay close to the 20 days expected between

294

infection and death (Figures 1 and 3).

295
296

298

We applied REMEDID to the official COVID-19 death with the corresponding

299

estimated CFRs (see section 2.2) to obtain the time series of estimated daily infections,

300

hereafter referred to as IRO. Figure 4 shows IRO and the accumulated infections for

301

Spain and its 19 regions. Note that in Spain, IRO are amplified versions of inferred

302

infections in Figure 3. In Spain, the first infection, according to IRO, is on 8 January

303

2020 (Table 3), 43 days before the first infection was officially reported on 20 February

304

2020 according to IO20. By contrast, IO21 places the first infection on 1 January 2020.

305

Spain reached the maximum number of IRO on 13 March, a day before the state of

306

emergency and lockdown were enforced (Table 4). On 14 March, IO20 = 1,832, and IO21

307

= 7,478; however, IRO = 63,727 (CI 95%: 60,050-67,403), 35 and 9 times IO20 and IO21,

308

respectively (Table 5). This implies that on that day, IO20 and IO21 only reported 2.9%

309

(CI 95%: 2.7%-3.1%) and 11.7% (CI 95%: 11.1%-12.5%) of new infections,

310

respectively. Although detection of infections clearly improved from IO20 to IO21,

311

almost 90% of the infections are still not documented in the peak of the first wave. The

312

situation is similar for the accumulated infections before 22 June 2020, as reported by

313

the National Seroprevalence Study4,5.

315

In almost all regions, IO20 showed a delay of 1 month or more between the first

316

infection and IRO (Table 3). No delay in IO21 occurred in Islas Baleares, Castilla-León,

317

and Galicia, while in three regions (Cataluña, Madrid, and La Rioja), the first case

318

occurred earlier than the first case of IRO. However, 6 regions had delays of 15 days and

319

other 6 regions had delays of 1 month. According to IRO, all regions except Ceuta and

320

Melilla had some infections in January, but in IO21 only 6 regions had infections in that

321

month. In all scenarios, the first infections were in Madrid and Cataluña.

322
323

During the first wave, according to IRO most of the regions had maximum daily

324

infections around 14 March. In Madrid, the maximum was reached on 11 March,

325

coinciding with the educational centres closing and an official warning by the regional

326

government (Table 4). Asturias was the last region to reach peak infections (25-26

327

March). The maximum percentage of documented cases (12.6%,CI 95%: 9.2%-18.4%)

328

occurred in Asturias on 14 March, but in the other regions, only between 1.2 to 8 % of

329

the infections were documented (Table 5).

330

Figure 4 shows how the IO21 and IRO curves of Spain and the 19 different regions

331

fluctuated following the same pattern until the middle of June 2020, but thereafter, they

332

showed different patterns. This reflects the fact that the Spanish government had

333

decreed the control measures for the whole nation until June, but thereafter, each

334

regional government implemented its own control measures. For example, some regions

335

(e.g., Aragón, Islas Baleares, Cantabria, Comunidad Valenciana, Extremadura, Galicia,

336

Murcia, País Vasco, and La Rioja) had two peaks, but others had only one. An apparent

337

maximum on 22 June in Islas Baleares is an artifact produced by the interpolation for

338

transition from the two CFRs. Although beyond the scope of this work, it would be very

339

interesting to investigate the effects of the different control measures implemented on

340

the corresponding IRO for the 19 regions.

341
342

The Spanish COVID-19 second wave reached a maximum of daily infections on 22

343

October from IRO and on 26 October from IO21. The delay of 4 days is similar to the

344

mean incubation period (5.78 days2). The estimated number of new infections is still

345

larger than the documented cases, but the shapes of the two curves are more similar in

346

the second wave than in the first wave (Figure 1a). The same is true for the 19 regions,

347

most of which had the largest peak around 22-26 October, with the exceptions of

348

Canarias and Madrid, which reached maxima in late August and early September,

349

respectively.

3.3. Infections from MoMo Excess Deaths

359
360

Assuming that MoMo ED accounts for both recorded and non-recorded COVID-19

361

deaths, negative deaths are meaningless, and they were set to zero. Then, the associated

362

daily infections can be estimated, as in Section 3.2, with a CFR of 100% from MoMo

363

ED for Spain (Figure 5). Note two main differences between this time series and that

15

364

estimated from official COVID-19 deaths: (1) MoMo data present an error band that

365

was inherited by the estimated infections; (2) MoMo ED estimated infections reached a

366

maximum of 1,443 (CI 99%: 1,329-1,547), doubling the 776 inferred daily infections

367

from official COVID-19 deaths in Figure 3. This is because maximum MoMo ED was

368

1,584 (CI 99%: 1,468-1,686%) and maximum COVID-19 official deaths was 828, both

369

estimated from the 14-day running mean time series. The maximum of inferred

370

infections was reached on 13 March, just one day prior to the state of emergency and

371

lockdown. The expected and observed delays with respect to official infections and

372

MoMo ED were similar to those observed for estimated infections from official

373

COVID-19 deaths. Error bounds of the estimated infections in Figure 5 were computed

374

from the MoMo ED error bounds. However, it should be highlighted that the

375

combination of the error bounds from MoMo ED and the estimated CFRs might lead to

376

unrealistic error estimates. To avoid this, the error estimates in Figure 6 were estimated

377

from the MoMo ED time series (no error bounds) and the error bounds of the estimated

378

CFRs.

379
380

[Figure 5]

381
382

The REMEDID was applied to the MoMo ED with the corresponding CFRs (see

383

section 2.2) to obtain the estimated daily infections, which will be referred hereafter as

384

IRM. The IRM were calculated for Spain and its 19 regions and are depicted in Figure 6,

385

as well as the accumulated IRM. In Spain, the first infection shown by IRM happened on

386

9 January, with an error estimate from 9 to 10 January, 41 to 42 days before the first

387

documented infection of IO20 on 20 February 2020 (Table 3). The maximum IRM was

388

77,855 (CI 95%: 73,364 - 82,347) reached on 13 March. On 14 March, IRM showed

389

14,128 infections more than IRO (Table 5). Notice that the CFR used with MoMo ED

390

data was larger than the one used with official COVID-19 deaths data, which makes this

391

difference even more remarkable, because the larger the CFR the lower the estimated

392

infections. Therefore, if the true CFRs, which are unknown, were used in both cases,

393

IRM would double IRO on 14 March, as happened when a CFR of 100% was used

394

(Figures 3 and 5). Notice that with the CFRs used, the IRM and IRO resulted in the same

395

accumulated infections on 22 June and 29 November, matching the results of the

396

seroprevalence study. Nevertheless, IRM showed 42 times more cases than IO20 and 10

397

times more than IO21 on 14 March, detection of official cases of only 2.4% (2.2%-2.5%)

398

and 9.6% (9.1%-10.2%), respectively.

399
400

Table 3 shows the estimated date of first infection for Spain and by region. Note that the

401

first cases of IRM in Spain were on 9 January and in Aragón, Canarias, and Navarra on 8

402

January, which is possible because significant excess deaths in a region may not

403

become significant for the whole country. In general, the maxima of daily infections

404

were closer to those on 14 March in IRM than in IRO. During the first wave, all regions

405

showed a single maximum, except for Ceuta, Melilla, and Murcia, which showed two

406

maxima (Figure 6). In general, the IRM time series in all regions were similar during that

407

period. The official data clearly under-detected infections during the first wave. On 14

408

March, IRM were comparable to IRO, overlapping CI in all regions, but not in Spain as a

409

whole (Table 5). During the second wave, there was improved detection of cases with

410

differences among regions.

4. Discussion

416

Infection dynamics is key to understand and model the COVID-19 pandemic.

417

Nevertheless, documented infections in Spain (and nearly worldwide) are of limited

418

quality qualitatively and quantitatively. Specifically, reported infections were

419

underestimated and delayed 16 days compared to the estimated date of infection during

420

the first months of the pandemic (according to IO20) and 6 days in the current version of

421

the data (IO21). According to the National Seroprevalence Study, only 10.7% of

422

infections were documented in Spain prior to 22 June 20204,5 and 64.3% from 23 June

423

to 29 November 202014. The huge underreporting during the first wave is mainly due to:

424

(1) the lack of testing for asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic people3, which could

425

have been detected with a “test, track and trace” strategy, as done in South Korea,

426

China, and Singapore17; (2) deaths outside of the hospitals, with many cases from

427

nursing homes for the elderly, where 6,664 deaths with COVID-19 and 7,082 with

428

similar symptoms, but not officially diagnosed with COVID-19, occurred from January

429

to May 202018. This poor quality of data hinders any options to study the infection

430

dynamics based on official data.

431
432

To overcome these difficulties, we propose the REMEDID algorithm, which allows

433

calculation of time series for daily infections from daily death time series, a more

434

reliable source, which can be applied in early stages of any pandemic with only 33 days

435

delay. The REMEDID algorithm needs only three inputs:

436

(1) PDF of the period from date of infection to date of death. In this study, that was

437

calculated by combining the PDF of the Incubation Period and the Illness Onset to

438

Death period, as estimated by Linton et al.11 for cases in Wuhan, China. The incubation

439

period can be assumed to be similar in China and elsewhere, because it is a

440

characteristic of the virus, but the illness onset to death period could be affected by the

441

type of health care and, thus, by each national health system2 or even ethnicity19. No

442

such information is available for Spain to date, but it would be desirable to use a local

443

distribution of Illness Onset to Death when available for Spain. The calculations could

444

be redone easily by applying the MATLAB code available in the Supplementary

445

Material.

446
447

(2) Time series of daily deaths. We used two sources, the official COVID-19 deaths and

448

the MoMo ED, because official COVID-19 deaths have been underestimated, especially

449

during the first wave in the regions of Castilla–La Mancha, Castilla y León, Cataluña,

450

and Madrid, because non-hospital deaths and cases during the early pandemic were

451

somewhat undertested (Table 1 and Figure 2). We expect that undocumented COVID-

452

19 deaths appeared in the excess of expected deaths from any cause calculated from

453

MoMo15. Interpretation of those results must be made carefully because ED is a

454

statistical variable calculated from what happened in previous years and some expected

455

deaths, such as those produced by traffic and work accidents, may have been reduced

456

due to the national lockdown that began on 14 March 2020 and gradually has been

457

eased. Nonetheless, expected fatalities were very low (traffic and work accidents less

458

than 5 deaths daily) compared to the daily death toll from COVID-19 (300 deaths per

459

day average from March to May). Some non-COVID-19 deaths may have been

460

influenced by other pandemic-related factors22, such as breakdown in medical follow-up

461

(especially chronic conditions and among older patients), delays in attending to the

462

healthcare appointments and/or being attended due to the collapse of the Health System,

463

transplant delay and reduction in donors’ numbers from 7.2 to 1.2 per day23, and the

464

decrease of the interventional cardiology activity between 40% and 81%24. Thus,

465

MoMo ED do not exactly correspond to COVID-19 deaths and must be regarded with

466

caution. A detailed study of the changes in other sources of mortality is recommended.

467

Nevertheless, MoMo ED is a valuable source of data that must be explored considering

468

the enormous bias in official data of daily infections.

469
470

(3) CFR estimate. CFR was defined as the ratio of deaths among total infections. Thus,

471

the lower the documented infections, the larger the CFR and under-detection of

472

infections leads to overestimation of the CFR. For example, in Spain on 22 June,

473

official data showed 261,111 accumulated infections and 29,676 deaths, a CFR of

474

11.37%, which was clearly overestimated because the number of infections was

475

underestimated. The National Seroprevalence Study in Spain with random testing

476

showed that 5.2% of the population (~47 million) had already been infected4,5. Because

477

CFR also depends on death records, we calculated a CFR of 1.21% (CI 95%: 1.15%-

478

1.29%) from official COVID-19 deaths and a CFR of 1.85% (CI 95%: 1.74%-1.96%)

479

from MoMo ED. However, the CFR is not constant in time nor in space. Different

480

regions showed different CFRs and the fourth phase of the seroprevalence study showed

481

a general decrease in the CFRs for the period 23 June – 29 November. In Spain, the

482

CFR decreased from 1.21% to 0.76% (CI 95%: 0.71%-0.81%) from official COVID-19

483

deaths and from 1.85% to 1.02% (CI 95%: 0.97%-1.09%) from MoMo ED. This decline

484

is probably due to the improvement of COVID-19 treatments and experience gained

485

since the beginning of the pandemic25. Similar seroprevalence studies are desirable in

486

other countries, because CFRs from official data are so variable. For example, on 22

487

June 2020, CFRs of 0.6, 5.2, and 14.5% were reported for Iceland, the world, and Italy,

488

respectively26. In addition, we assumed a constant CFR prior to 22 June and from 23

20

489

June to 29 November 2020, although introducing time dependence on the CFR would

490

enhance the infected estimates. A constant CFR does not consider who is affected by

491

saturation of the health systems due to limited human and material resources. However,

492

to estimate a time-variable CFR requires accurate infection records among other

493

variables, which are not currently available. Moreover, CFRs among severe cases

494

(mostly detected) are much greater than those among asymptomatic and mild cases

495

(mostly undetected). Consequently, the CFR calculation has a high degree of

496

uncertainty. Nevertheless, because information on the CFRs is expected to improve,

497

calculations in this study can be updated easily using the MATLAB code for

498

REMEDID algorithm provided as Supplementary Material.

499
500

We ran the REMEDID algorithm to provide the estimated time series of infections for

501

Spain and for its 19 regions for the period from 8 January to 29 November 2020. These

502

time series provided valuable information to understand the time evolution of the

503

pandemic. Our main findings for Spain are:

504

(1) On 14 March, when the national government decreed the state of emergency and

505

national lockdown, estimated infections were between 35 and 42 times larger than

506

officially documented ones at that time, and 9-10 times more than current official data.

507

(2) The national lockdown had a strong effect on the transmission of the virus, as shown

508

by a rapid slope decrease around day 13 March.

509

(3) The first infection was better determined from inferred infections than from official

510

records during the first months of the pandemic.

511
512

The REMEDID algorithm has strengths and limitations. First, it uses the number of

513

deaths, which are more accurately recorded than infections. Second, it allows

21

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.22.20136960; this version posted March 23, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

514

elucidation of the date of the infections estimated during the seroprevalence studies,

515

which only determines the total number of infections. Thus, the REMEDID algorithm

516

complements the seroprevalence studies. Third, the estimated daily infections place the

517

probable date of infection more accurately than the official numbers. Note that official

518

infections are delayed by the incubation period (from infection to illness onset).

519

Therefore, although the maxima of infections theoretically should have coincided with

520

the state of emergency and the national lockdown on 14 March, official infections in

521

Spain were maximum 6 days later. Infections estimated from death data do not show

522

such delay, however. Determination of the actual day of infection is very important for

523

evaluation of the immediate effect of the implemented countermeasures. In Madrid the

524

estimated infections reached their maximum on 11 March when regional government

525

warned the population to stay at home and schools and universities were closed, forcing

526

1.2 million students to stay at home. Moreover, overall recommendations on disease

527

control and social distancing were given by the Ministry of Health to the general public

528

since de beginning of March (see

529

https://www.mscbs.gob.es/en/profesionales/saludPublica/ccayes/alertasActual/nCov-

530

China/ciudadania.htm ).

531
532

Four, the REMEDID algorithm can be applied to any region, regardless of population

533

size, but being cautious with small populations. For example, in this study we applied

534

REMEDID methodology to a small city (Ceuta with 84,777 inhabitants), a medium size

535

region (Madrid with more than 6.6 million inhabitants), and a country (Spain with 47

536

million inhabitants). This versatility allows study of different epidemic dynamics as

537

reflected in the variety of shapes and slopes in the curves depicting death and infection

538

records, that show the heterogeneity of the epidemic at each region with different

22

539

population size and density, social behaviour and transmission pattern, especially during

540

the second wave, showing unique dynamics that must be addressed individually.

541

Knowledge of the real epidemic dynamics of different population nodes is key to

542

succeed in modelling attempts, because we could calculate the sole effect of group

543

size27. This spatially-explicit information, in combination with population size per node

544

and mobility would allow us to use a metapopulation approach in future models 28-30.

545
546

Among the methodology limitations, the most important is that it can only be

547

implemented retrospectively. Thus, these estimates cannot be used to control the

548

pandemic in real time. But considering that different regions or countries are at different

549

stages at the same time, results of this methodology for the first communities could be

550

applied elsewhere. Furthermore, it is useful to enhance models and improve our

551

knowledge of the pandemic dynamics, including the effectiveness of the different

552

measures adopted to flatten the curve and design safe post-lockdown measures. In

553

addition, more realistic and accurate models could be obtained by use of the more

554

realistic daily number of infections provided by REMEDID, which, in turn, would

555

improve the models outcome and enhance comparisons of different lockdown and post-

556

lockdown measures31.

557
558

We believe that REMEDID methodology applied to daily COVID-19 deaths (if

559

accurately reported) or to MoMo ED could be useful to analyse the dynamics of the

560

pandemic retrospectively and more accurately quantify the real daily infections with

561

respect to the official numbers. We only need the CFR and, for greater precision, the

562

PDF of Infections to Death or, alternatively, the PDF of Incubation Period and Illness

563

Onset to Death. This approach could be implemented anywhere, improving our

Appendix A. Validation test

569

In order to validate REMEDID, it would be desirable to have an accurate time series of

570

daily infections and deaths. Then, the REMEDID infections inferred from deaths could

571

be compared to the recorded infections. However, such datasets are not available

572

because many infections in any disease or plague are usually undetected. On the other

573

hand, REMEDID-estimated infections cannot be compared to those of dynamical

574

models, which also need accurate data to be tuned. In fact, the main motivation for

575

developing REMEDID has been to provide (more) reliable data to feed dynamical

576

models.

577
578

As an alternative of validation, we propose the following experiment as a proof of

579

concept. In the official COVID-19 time series, IO21, infections are given the date of

580

symptoms onset. Then, REMEDID applied to official deaths with the PDF of illness

581

onset to death, h(t), instead of the PDF of infection to death, f(t), should produce a time

582

series comparable to IO21. Official accumulated cases and deaths on 22 June 2020 were

583

261,111 and 29,676, respectively, which gives a CFR of 11.37%. This CFR is

584

overestimated due to an under detection of cases in that period. On the other hand,

585

official accumulated cases and deaths from 23 June to 29 November 2020 were

586

1,482,293 and 17,439, which gives a CFR of 1.18%. Although closer to reality, this

587

value is still overestimated. In any case, if we use these CFR values to construct the

588

segmented timeseries of CFRs, as in Section 2.2, when applying REMEDID the

589

resulting estimated daily infections should be comparable to IO21. The results are shown

590

in Figure A.1 where the REMEDID estimated daily infections is in very good

591

agreement with the smoothed IO21 (14-day running mean), with a correlation between

592

the two series of 0.98 % (p-value<0.001). Because smoothed time series present a high

593

degree of serial correlation, the correlation and the significance level was estimated

594

according to a specific Monte Carlo analysis based on the randomization of phases in

595

the frequency domain32. Notice that (i) application of the 14-day running mean to the

596

IO21 series removes the weekly variability due to the weekend infections misreport; (ii)

597

the agreement of the two series would improve with an improved estimate of the CFR

598

time series. Thus, the good match between the estimated and the original daily

599

infections timeseries proves the theoretical concept that supports REMEDID.

600
601

Note the differences with the results presented in section 3.2, where the PDF includes

602

the incubation period and a more realistic CFR, as estimated from the National

603

Seroprevalence Study data.

Figure 1. Probability density functions (PDF) of incubation period (IP, blue line) and

801

illness onset to death period (IOD, red line) from Linton et al. (2020). Green line, f(t), is

802

the convolution of both and represents the PDF of infection to death. Black dotted line

803

is a lognormal PDF with the same mean and median as f(t).

Figure 3. Official COVID-19 infections and deaths, and estimated infections with case

823

fatality ratio (CFR) of 100% in Spain during the first wave. Left y-axis: COVID-19

824

daily infections IO21 (blue curve). Right y-axis: COVID-19 deaths (orange curve) and

825

its REMEDID-estimated infections with CFR=100% (red curve). All curves are for

826

Spain. Thin blue and orange curves are daily data, and thick curves are smoothed by 14-

827

day running mean. Arrows show delays between the maximum of inferred infections

828

and maxima from COVID-19 deaths (orange arrows) and COVID-19 infections (blue

829

arrows). Solid arrows are expected delays, dotted while arrows are observed delays.
