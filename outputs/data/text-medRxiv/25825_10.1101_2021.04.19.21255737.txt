Abstract: As vaccination efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic are ramping up worldwide,

13

there are rising concerns that individuals will begin to eschew nonpharmaceutical interventions

14

for preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and attempt to return to pre-pandemic normalcy

15

before vaccine coverage levels effectively mitigate transmission risk. In the U.S.A., some

16

governing bodies have already weakened or repealed guidelines for nonpharmaceutical

17

intervention use, despite a recent spike in national COVID-19 cases and majority population of

18

unvaccinated individuals. Recent modeling suggests that repealing nonpharmaceutical

19

intervention guidelines too early into vaccine rollouts will lead to localized increases in COVID-

20

19 cases, but the magnitude of nonpharmaceutical intervention effects on individual-level SARS-

21

CoV-2 infection risk in fully- and partially-vaccinated populations is unclear. We use a

22

previously-published agent-based model to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission in indoor

23

gatherings of varying durations, population densities, and vaccination coverage levels. By

24

simulating nonpharmaceutical interventions in some gatherings but not others, we were able to

25

quantify the difference in SARS-CoV-2 infection risk when nonpharmaceutical interventions

were used, relative to scenarios with no nonpharmaceutical interventions. We found that

27

nonpharmaceutical interventions will often reduce secondary attack rates, especially during brief

28

interactions, and therefore there is no definitive vaccination coverage level that makes

29

nonpharmaceutical interventions completely redundant. However, the reduction effect on

30

absolute SARS-CoV-2 infection risk conferred by nonpharmaceutical interventions is likely

31

proportional to COVID-19 prevalence. Therefore, if COVID-19 prevalence decreases in the

32

future, nonpharmaceutical interventions will likely still confer protective effects but potential

33

benefits may be small enough to remain within “effectively negligible” risk thresholds.

Introduction
Global vaccine rollout to combat the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is

39

well underway, with at least different seven vaccines approved for distribution by different

40

countries (WHO 2021). In the U.S.A., where three vaccines have been approved for distribution

41

(CDC 2021a), 24.8% of the population has been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 as of April

42

17th 2021 (CDC 2021b). Despite ongoing vaccine rollouts, as of April 17th 2021, there is an

43

indication that COVID-19 cases are surging in some U.S. states (NY Times 2021). In spite of

44

rising case numbers, several U.S. states have recently rescinded, or allowed to expire, policies

45

mandating use of nonpharmaceutical intervention in public spaces, with seemingly no intention

46

of reinstating them in the near future (State of Iowa 2021; State of Mississippi 2021; State of

47

Texas 2021). Population-level epidemiological models of vaccine rollout effects on COVID-19

48

transmission suggest that discontinuing nonpharmaceutical intervention use early into the

49

vaccination effort leads to a subsequent surge in COVID-19 cases and related hospitalizations

50

and deaths (Gozzi et al. 2021; Moore et al. 2021).

51

The magnitude of nonpharmaceutical intervention effects on individual-level SARS-

52

CoV-2 infection risk in fully- and partially-vaccinated populations is unclear. This information is

53

crucial for identifying vaccination levels at which it would be appropriate to scale-back

54

guidelines for nonpharmaceutical interventions, as it would allow governing bodies to base

55

policies on concrete risk estimates. The United States Centers for Disease Control and

56

Prevention (CDC) has updated guidelines on safe gathering protocols, recommending that groups

57

of fully-vaccinated people can now safely interact amongst themselves, or with small groups of

58

unvaccinated people at low risk for developing severe COVID-19, without utilizing any

59

nonpharmaceutical Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)

60

transmission interventions (e.g., face coverings, 2-m social distancing, etc.) (CDC 2021c).

61

However, the guidelines also recommend to continue avoiding medium to large gatherings, and

62

the use of nonpharmaceutical interventions in public and when gathering with unvaccinated

63

individuals. This caution stems from the incomplete knowledge of vaccine effectiveness across

64

different populations, their effects on transmission, and the potential change on vaccine

65

effectiveness caused by the emergence of new SARS-Cov-2 variants.

66

The problem with citing vaccination efforts as a justification for discontinuing

67

nonpharmaceutical interventions is twofold. First and foremost, the majority of the U.S.

68

population is not yet fully vaccinated (CDC 2021b), and therefore presumably has little-to-no

69

immunity from SARS-CoV-2 infections. Secondly, while there is growing evidence that these

70

vaccines reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection risk in addition to COVID-19 incidence, vaccines may

71

not confer complete immunity or block transmission (Hall et al. 2021; Lipsitch & Kahn 2021;

72

Yellen et al. 2021). Data suggest that the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine (i.e., the vaccine developed

73

by Pfizer-BioNtech) may be ≈ 72% effective at preventing laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2

74

infections after a single dose, and ≈ 86-92% two weeks following the second dose (Hall et al.

75

2021; Yellen et al. 2021). Furthermore, this vaccine may reduce viral loads, a potential proxy for

76

infectiousness, in infected individuals by 3-4 times (Levine-Tiefenbrun et al. 2021). Less

77

information is available on the ability of the other two vaccines approved for U.S. distribution to

78

reduce SARS-CoV-2 infections, but Lipsitch & Kahn (2021) do estimate that mRNA-1273 (i.e.,

79

the vaccine developed by Moderna and NIAID) can reduce individual-level infection risk by at

80

least 61% following the first dose. Despite potentially-high infection-reduction efficacies,

81

without vaccines that confer complete immunity from infection or prevent transmission from

82

infectious individuals, it will be difficult to halt SARS-CoV-2 circulation in the population

83

through vaccination efforts alone (Gozzi et al. 2021; Moore et al. 2021). Considering that most

84

people also have yet to be fully vaccinated, guidelines that advocate phasing out

85

nonpharmaceutical interventions during interpersonal interactions may be premature at this time.

86

In Farthing & Lanzas (2021), we described an agent-based model (ABM) for simulating

87

indoor respiratory pathogen transmission. We previously used this model to quantify effects of

88

nonpharmaceutical interventions on reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk during an indoor

89

superspreading event (Farthing & Lanzas 2021). Here, we use it to simulate SARS-CoV-2

90

transmission in indoor gatherings of varying durations, population densities, and proportional

91

vaccination coverage. By simulating nonpharmaceutical interventions in some gatherings but not

92

others, we were able to quantify the difference in SARS-CoV-2 infection risk when

93

nonpharmaceutical interventions were used in conjunction with vaccination efforts, relative to

94

scenarios with no nonpharmaceutical interventions. Using these data, we demonstrate how

95

interested parties can easily estimate the potential reduction in SARS-CoV-2 infection risk

96

attributable to nonpharmaceutical interventions, and try to answer the question: “at what point

97

during vaccine rollout are gatherings without non-pharmaceutical measures safe?”

Methods
We used the ABM we first described in Farthing & Lanzas (2021) to simulate the effect

101

of increasing vaccination coverage and nonpharmaceutical interventions on SARS-CoV-2

102

transmission risk during indoor gatherings. The simulation input levels and parameter values we

103

used are given in Table 1. We made the assumptions that any infectious individuals at gatherings

104

would be asymptomatic because symptomatic people would consciously decide to stay away,

105

and that no one with partial immunity exists within the group of attendees. Vaccinated people

106

had a fixed probability of becoming completely immune to SARS-CoV-2 infection (Table 1),

107

and those that did not become immune remained susceptible to infection (i.e, ‘all-or-nothing’

108

vaccine). Finally, we only simulated use of cloth face coverings, rather than notably more-

109

effective masks like N95s, because we make the assumption that the majority of Americans have

110

ready access to, and are more-likely to use cloth masks.

111

All simulations were carried out within the open-source modeling software, NetLogo

112

(Ver. 6. 1. 1 – Wilensky 1999). We executed a factorial simulation run in the NetLogo

113

BehaviorSpace using our specified input levels, and ran 200 simulations replicates of each

114

parameter set combination when the nonpharmaceutical interventions were included and when

115

they were not. We ran these factorial combination sets separately in order to save computation

116

time as there were two inputs (i.e., mask efficacy, attempted social distance) that only changed

117

when nonpharmaceutical interventions were simulated. We ultimately produced 1,612,800

118

simulations without nonpharmaceutical interventions, and 9,676,800 including them (i.e.,

119

11,289,600 total simulations). We recorded the number of susceptible individuals infected in

120

each simulation, and aggregated this information into a single data set prior to analysis.

121

We reported the mean probability of observing ≥ 1 successful infection event(s) and

122

mean secondary attack rates in indoor gatherings when an asymptomatic person was also in

123

attendance across factorial combinations of “between-group comparison” variables (Table 1).

124

Secondary attack rates here were calculated by dividing the number of people that were infected

125

at the gathering by the number of “healthy” people at the start of the gathering, and can also be

126

considered to be the individual-level probability of a previously healthy attendee being infected

127

at the gathering. To assess the difference between protection conferred by the simultaneous

deployment of pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical interventions, versus use of only

where “Intervention level” is a categorical variable containing the following mutually-exclusive

137

levels: “cloth face masks & vaccination,” “cloth face masks & 2-m social distancing &

138

vaccination,” and “vaccination only.” Additionally, “Vaccine efficacy” here refers to the ability

139

of vaccines to induce complete immunity to infection. “Vaccine coverage” and “Vaccine

140

efficacy” are given in terms of decimal percent, not percentage points (e.g., 0.1, not 10%).

141

Because beta regression models assume all dependent variable values fall between 0 and 1, we

142

used the data transformation procedure described by (Cribari-Neto & Zeiles, 2010) to reconstruct

143

our proportion data without these extremities prior to model fitting. We used the pseudo-R2

calculation procedure given by Ferrari & Cribari-Neto (2004) to assess the goodness of fit for

our regression model.

After fitting our data, we used the regression model to predict the mean secondary attack

rates during a 60-minute gathering with a single asymptomatic person in attendance across the

148

complete factorial combination of covariate inputs described in Table 2. We report the difference

between predicted values when all interventions (i.e., cloth face masks & 2-m social distancing

Results & Discussion
We found that the probability of ≥ 1 successful transmission event generally increased

158

with population density (Fig. 1). This is unsurprising, as SARS-CoV-2 transmission in this ABM

159

is highly sensitive to within-room population density (Farthing & Lanzas 2021). We observed

160

that at low population densities and/or short-duration gatherings, the use of nonpharmaceutical

161

interventions can significantly reduce the probability of successful transmission. Furthermore, it

162

is clear that at low population densities, 2-m social distancing confers additional protective

163

effects when used in conjunction with cloth face coverings, even during relatively-long duration

164

gatherings. This is consistent with what we observed when we used the same ABM to directly

165

compare the effectiveness of varied nonpharmaceutical interventions to prevent SARS-CoV-2

166

transmission during a superspreading event (Farthing & Lanzas 2021). We found that cloth face

167

masks alone conferred few protective effects in long-duration gatherings.

168

The probability of transmission events occurring was unlikely to reach ≈ 0% outside of

169

scenarios with low population density and multiple nonpharmaceutical interventions, or ≥ 95%

170

vaccine coverage and vaccines that were 100% effective at preventing infections. Given that 1)

171

current estimates place SARS-CoV-2 vaccine efficacies against infection between 60-90% (Hall

172

et al. 2021; Lipsitch & Kahn 2021; Yellen et al. 2021), 2) historical precedence suggesting adult

173

populations will fall well short of these high vaccination levels (Applewhite et al. 2020; CDC

174

2020), and 3) the difficulty government institutions have had enforcing nonpharmaceutical

175

intervention policies (Jacobs & Ohinmaa 2020; Pedersen & Favero 2020), it is unlikely that these

176

scenarios will be representative of average real-world gatherings. Moreover, in 60-min gathering

177

scenarios, the probability of ≥ 1 successful transmission event occurring is relatively high even

178

when gathering attendees utilize nonpharmaceutical interventions and most are vaccinated.

179
180

The probability that ≥1 SARS-CoV-2-positive individual is in attendance at a gathering
can be calculated as

181

1 − (1 − 𝑝)! ,

182

where 𝑝 is the local COVID-19 prevalence, and 𝑛 is the number of people at the gathering

183

(Chande et al. 2020). The prevalence of infectious cases (p) can be highly uncertain because of

184

the variable testing effort across time and space, but it can be estimated by assuming that any

185

SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals are infectious at time of testing and will remain infectious for

186

a given period of time. Additionally, ascertainment bias can be factored in. The probability that a

187

given individual will be infected at a gathering is then

188

(1 − (1 − 𝑝)! )𝑞" ,

(2)

(3)

189

where 𝑞" is the probability that individual 𝑖 will be infected given exposure to an asymptomatic

190

individual at the gathering. Effectively, what we report in Fig. 2 are estimates of 𝑞" under

191

different circumstances. Our findings suggest that cloth-based mask use, with or without 2-m

192

social distancing, often does not confer significant protective effects during long-duration

193

gatherings (Fig. 2), we have also shown that implementing these nonpharmaceutical

194

interventions can reduce overall transmission probability (Fig. 1) and secondary attack rates (Fig.

195

2, Table 3) during brief interactions or gatherings with relatively-few people (e.g., fewer than 10

196

people, the limit for indoor and/or outdoor social gatherings enforced by some U.S. states

197

(MultiState 2021)). This effectively means that strict guidelines for continued nonpharmaceutical

198

intervention use will likely help to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 spread, and therefore COVID-19

199

incidence, for as long as these policies are in effect.

200

As vaccine coverage increases, the question now becomes “how much elevated risk is

201

acceptable in the absence of nonpharmaceutical interventions?" If we let 𝑞"# denote the

202

probability that individual 𝑖 will be infected given exposure to an asymptomatic individual at a

203

gathering where no nonpharmaceutical interventions were in place, and 𝑞"∗ denote the probability

204

that individual 𝑖 will be infected given exposure to an asymptomatic individual at a gathering

205

where some level of nonpharmaceutical interventions were in place, then the relative effect of

206

nonpharmaceutical interventions on reducing infection risk is equal to

By quantifying covariate effects in our beta-regression model, we provide interested

209

parties with a formula that can be used to quickly determine generalized 𝑞"# or 𝑞"∗ values, without

210

the need for running a large number of simulations. Due to the logit link function we used, the

(Ferrari & Cribari-Neto 2004). Our regression model had a pseudo-R2 of 0.37. Given the number

216

of stochastic processes in our ABM and the variability purposely introduced into simulations

217

(Table 1), we believe the explanatory power of the model is acceptable for our purposes here.

Assuming mean population-level vaccine efficacies of 60% and 80%, which we believe are

219

conservative estimates for U.S.-approved vaccine efficacies, our regression model consistently

220

predicts that secondary attack rates decrease by 55-58% when attendees utilize cloth masks and

221

2-m social distancing, regardless of gathering duration (Fig. 3). However, it is important to

222

reiterate that here we estimate the probability or infection given contact with an infectious

223

individual at a gathering (𝑞" ) and comment on the relative risk difference attributable to

224

intervention use. This should not be confused with the absolute risk of becoming infected at a

225

gathering (see Equation 3). We demonstrate the difference in Figure 4, which is a simplistic

226

example intended to show that even at relatively high COVID-19 prevalence levels, 20 people

227

gathering indoors for 60 minutes have a substantially-lower individual-level risk of SARS-CoV-

228

2 infections than is suggested by 𝑞" alone. Though predicting intervention effects on community-

229

level COVID-19 prevalence and infection-related events (e.g., symptom-onset, mortality, or

230

hospitalization) is outside the scope of our model, our simulations do suggest that secondary

231

attack rates are negatively correlated with vaccine coverage. Given that we expect local COVID-

232

19 prevalence to eventually follow similar trends (Gozzi et al. 2021), the relative impact of

233

nonpharmaceutical interventions on infection risk reduction will likely decrease over time as

234

vaccine rollouts continue.

235

In addition to being unable to comment on community-level infection metrics, there are a

236

few other limitations associated with our results that we must acknowledge. Aside from the

237

ABM design limitations outlined in Farthing et al. (2021), we make a number of assumptions in

238

our simulations. Most of these assumptions are directly tied to our parameter space detailed in

239

Table 1, and include such things as: in simulated gatherings only one asymptomatic individual

240

was in attendance, no individuals wear masks with exposure-reduction efficacies > 50% and

241

therefore we are not simulating the use of N95 or similar masks, and there is no simulated

242

forced-air ventilation or infectious individuals that produce superspreader-level of contaminated

243

aerosols (e.g., 970 quanta (Miller et al. 2020)). Additionally, we do not simulate activity-specific

244

behaviors and individuals in our simulations were unmoving. Finally, we based the

245

infectiousness of asymptomatic individuals on the estimate given by Buonanno et al. (2020) (i.e.,

246

142 quanta/hr), and to relate this estimate to ABM parameters we used the linear model

247

described in Farthing et al. (2021). However, this parameterization procedure may have over-

248

inflated virion transmissibility in certain scenarios because quanta-estimates are room-size

249

specific, and the Farthing et al. (2021) linear model was based on simulations of gatherings

250

within a relatively large room. In short, our results must be viewed through the lens of simulated

251

world parameters and behaviors, and likely will not wholly reflect all variability that may exist in

252

real-world transmission events. This is very common for ABM-based studies however, and we

253

feel that our model is sufficiently accurate to highlight general trends in indoor SARS-CoV-2

254

transmission and infection risk.

Conclusions
We found that nonpharmaceutical interventions will often reduce secondary attack rates,

especially during brief interactions, and therefore there is no definitive vaccination coverage

259

level that makes nonpharmaceutical interventions completely redundant. However, the beneficial

260

effect on absolute SARS-CoV-2 infection risk reduction conferred by nonpharmaceutical

261

interventions used during indoor gatherings is likely proportional to COVID-19 prevalence.

262

Therefore, if U.S. COVID-19 prevalence decreases in the future, nonpharmaceutical

263

interventions will likely still confer protective effects, but any potential benefits may be small

264

enough to remain within “effectively negligible” risk thresholds.

input was included as it relates to analyses. Specifically, “Fixed value” indicates that values are

401

unchanged across all simulations, and are thus irrelevant for analyses. “Between-group

402

comparison” indicates that levels were used in factorial combinations for data aggregation and

403

reporting. “Within-group variation” indicates that different levels were included to increase the

404

variation in simulation results, and by doing so increase model realism. †Based on linear

405

modeling described in Appendix S2 of Farthing & Lanzas (2021), this value equates to 142

406

quanta/hr, the average quanta emission rate for asymptomatic people calculated by Buonanno et

407

al. (2020). ‡Standard deviation is given in parentheses. §Das et al. (2020) estimated the average

408

travel distance of a 100-micrometer droplet expelled from a height of 1.7 m at a velocity of 0.5

409

m/s to be 0.55 m. They also found that the majority of 100-μm droplets will fall 0.55-2.35 m

410

away from the expelling individual, depending on initial velocity, but droplets may settle up to

411

3.2 m away very rarely. A random draw of 10,000,000 samples from a log-normal distribution

412

parameterized using 1.7-m and 0.2095-m droplet spread distance mean and standard deviation

413

values, respectively, generated a distribution in line with this finding. The standard deviation we

414

use in simulations for non-coughing expectoration is proportionate to the one used in this random

415

draw. **Instead of specifying a fixed number of individuals in simulations, we scaled the

416

simulated population with world size.

All simulated worlds were square-shaped. ¶The Purpose column describes why the parameter or

Figure 3. Predicted secondary attack rates suggest that the combination of cloth face masks and

434

2-m social distancing during indoor gatherings of varying durations consistently reduces

435

secondary attack rates by 55-58%. This effect was only modeled for vaccine efficacies of 60%

436

and 80%.
