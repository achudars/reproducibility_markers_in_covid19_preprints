Abstract
(1) Background : Chile has become one of the countries most affected by Covid-19, a pandemic that has generated a large number
of cases worldwide, which if not detected and treated in time can
cause multi-organic failure and even death. The social determinants
of health such as education, work, social security, housing, environment, support networks and social cohesion are important aspects to
consider for the control and intervention of this pathology. Therefore,
it is essential to have information about the progress of the infections
at the national level and thus apply effective public health interventions. In this paper, we compare different time series methodologies
to predict the number of confirmed cases and deaths from Covid-19

Chile by using ARIMA models, exponential smoothing techniques,
Poisson models for time-dependent counting data. In addition, we
evaluated the accuracy of the predictions by using a training set and
test set; (3) Results: The database used in this paper allows us to

to a well-known Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)
time-series model, whereas for deaths from Covid-19 in Chile the best
model resulted in damped trend method; (4) Conclusion: ARIMA
models are an alternative to model the behavior of the spread of Covid19, however, and depending on the characteristics of the data set, other

Introduction

SARS-CoV-2 or also called Covid-19 is an infectious-contagious disease that
has originated a pandemic of high impact on the health of the international
population, causing death if not detected and treated in time.
Concerning its origin, Cruz et al. (2020) pointed out that it is still being
investigated and that the virus was initially declared of zoonotic origin due
to its similarity to bat coronaviruses. However, other studies Zhou et al.
(2020) and De Wit et al. (2016) reveal the probable mutation of SARSCoV (transmitted to humans through consumption of exotic animals) and
MERS-CoV (transmitted from camels to humans) as the etiological source
of Covid-19. The most frequent symptoms cases of confirmed Covid-19 according to the World Health Organization (WHO, 2020) (https://www.
who.int/es/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) are fever,
cough, fatigue and respiratory distress; although cases have also been reported with symtomatology atypical digestive, neurological, cardiovascular
diseases, muscular diseases, ophthalmological, etc. and asymptomatic cases
as indicated by Chen et al. (2020), Chang et al. (2020), Huang et al. (2020),
among others.
There is no specific antiviral for the treatment of Covid-19, and several

expert groups have developed guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of
SARS-CoV-2 (Jin et al., 2020). In situations where cases evolve unfavourably,
some studies have pointed to the use of algorithms to address severe clinical
cases (Liao et al. (2020) and Bassetti et al. (2020)). Therefore, stopping and
limiting the number of infections and deaths from Covid-19 is a priority for
public policy. Valdés (1995), Fernández et al. (2015) and Rebolledo et al.
(2014) mentioned that poorly designed and coordinated policies can generate great biopsychosocial suffering. Therefore, health interventions must be
correlated with economic and social policies to mitigate the negative impact
of the pandemic in these contexts.

1.1

Chile and the Covid-19

The government of Chile has designed different strategies to prevent the
spread of Covid-19. Among the most important measures for complying with
the chilean’s health policy objectives are the border closures, cancellation of
air flights, suspension of classes, suspension of non-essential supplies, social
distancing, strict hygiene and personal protection measures, mandatory use
of masks when interacting with other people, request for legal permits to
transit or move in quarantined cities (confinement in-home or health residence), avoid touching or approaching people with respiratory infections,
etc.
In the field of Chilean health, the Ministry of Health (MINSAL); establishes within its objectives to monitor the traceability of confirmed cases of
Covid-19 and the real supervision of quarantines, through human resources
technology. To this end, it works together with the Regional Health Services
(SEREMI), which has been given the authority to supervise the traceability
and isolation of cases confirmed with Covid-19. Specifically, this activity is
carried out by the primary care health teams, which are made up of:
• A physician, who evaluates the clinical status of the person likely to be
infected, orders the PCR test and performs an educational role for the
person and his or her close contacts.
• Nursing and kinesiology professional; who has shared functions in carrying out the sample taking procedure and following up the person with
probable infection using telemedicine until the PCR result is known.

If the result of the test is negative, the person is discharged; otherwise,
quarantine is indicated for 14 days. After this period, the infected
person is evaluated again and it is determined if he or she needs to
continue in quarantine due to the persistence of the symptoms or if he
or she is discharged.
The Covid-19 has exposed the social inequalities that exist in Latin America.
Specifically, in Chile, according to the National Socio-Economic Characterization Survey (Encuesta CASEN, 2017, http://observatorio.ministeriodesarrollosocial.
gob.cl/casen-multidimensional/casen/casen_2017.php), it is known that
there is a national average of 7.3% of occupied private homes with overcrowding (5 or more people per room), which leads to greater difficulty in
managing public policies. Another important social factor is the incidence
of poverty (measured by family income). In Chile, according to the CASEN,
2017, this index reaches 7.4% in urban areas and 16.5% in rural areas. The
Metropolitan Region has the highest percentage of households in poverty,
with 26.7%, which correlates precisely with the highest number of confirmed
cases of COVID 19 reported daily in the country. It is important to have a
multivariate report on poverty and in this regard the Social Development Report of Social Development and Family MINDES/MDSF (MINDES/MDSF)
has shown that this variable is multidimensional where it was detected in
the Chilean population, through certain indicators that there are deficiencies
of 22.5% in education, health, work and social security, housing and environment, as well as limitations of 10% in the networks and social cohesion,
which impacts negatively and favours the increase in poverty.

1.2

Review of statistical models in Covid-19

Since the beginning of the pandemic, there has been a great interest in researchers and research centres for trend analysis and prediction of the rate of
infections and deaths in different cities of the world. This context generates
great challenges and that is why our study aims to study time series models
that can describe the evolution of infections and deaths by Covid-19. The
literature points out different techniques to provide accurate inferences and
to establish asymptotic properties in trend estimators and time dependence
of the data. One of the most popular tools for analyzing and sequentially
predicting data are time series models that allow us to capture trends, breaks

in structure, cycles and dependence over time. For illustrative purposes, just
a few representative contributions are cited below.
In Nigeria, models of the Box-Jenkins type have been used to model
and predict the propagation of Covid-19, proposed by Ibrahim and Oladipo
(2020). In particular, the authors propose a model of the type Auto-Regressive
Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) of order (1,1,0) (ARIMA(1,1,0)) which
provided a forecasts for ten consecutive days of the virus. Maleki et al. (2020)
considered Autoregressive time series models based on two-piece scale mixture normal distributions, called TPSMNAR models for the modelling and
prediction of confirmed and recovered cases of Covid-19 in the world. In the
same context, Benvenuto et al. (2020) developed an ARIMA model to predict
the epidemiological trend of the prevalence and incidence of Covid-19 on the
Johns Hopkins epidemiological data. Liu et al. (2020) proposed a machine
learning and mathematical model-based analysis by using SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered) and neural network models (NNs) were
built to model disease trends in Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou.
Combined with public transportation data, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model was used to estimate the accumulated demands
for nonlocal hospitalization during the epidemic period in Beijing, Shanghai
and Guangzhou. Other models are included in the references of the following
authors Perone (2020), Sarkar (2020), Tran et al. (2020) and references cited
therein.
Papastefanopoulos et al. (2020) conducted a comparative study of 6-time
series methods to estimate the percentage of active cases concerning the total population for ten countries with the highest number of confirmed cases
from May 4, 2020. Among the methodologies proposed by these authors
are the ARIMA model, HoltWinters Additive Model (HWAAS), Exponential Smoothing with Additive Trend and Additive Seasonality, Trigonometric seasonal formulation Box–Cox transformation ARMA errors and trend
component (TBAT), Prophet (Automatic Forecasting Procedure), DeepAR
(Probabilistic Forecasting with Auto-Regressive Recurrent Networks) and NBeats (Neural Basis Expansion Analysis for Interpretable Time Series Forecasting). These authors use the root mean square error (RMSE) to assess
the performance of each time series model, concludes that traditional statistical methods such as ARIMA and TBAT, in general, prevail over their
deep learning counterparts such as DeepAR and N-BEATS and argue that
the result is not a surprise given the lack of large amounts of data.
In the same line, Yonar et al. (2020) proposed a study to predict and

model the number of Covid-19 cases using two methodologies: ARIMA and
exponential smoothing methods. In this paper, the authors mention that
for different countries under study there is no single model to describe the
behaviour of the number of cases, but according to the characteristics of the
data, both methods are effective in describing the virus propagation curves.
Other methods have been studied, for example, in Agosto and Giudici (2020)
a regression Poisson autoregressive model is proposed to understand Covid-19
contagion dynamics, Mizumoto and Chowell (2020) fitted the reported serial
interval (mean and standard deviation SD) with a gamma distribution and
applied the "earlyR" package in R (Team (2017)) to estimate R0 in the early
stage of the Covid-19 outbreak. Finally, Roda et al. (2020) written a paper
that emphasizes the difficulty of modeling the characteristics of the Covid19 cases. These authors used SIR and SEIR models for model predictions
and applied model-selection analysis. Following the investigations of authors
above mentioned, we will analyze other methodologies to contribute to the
discussion of the current topic. In particular, in this paper, a comparative
analysis between the ARIMA models, exponential smoothing, space state
models, Bayesian approach and GLARMA model are proposed. The last
three methods are used through a Poisson distribution for counting data
with local linear trend model.
The article is organized as follows. In Section 2, a brief description of
the data set and the time series models used in this paper are described in
detail. In Section 3, the behavior of the differents models is examined by
means of a statistical analysis which includes estimations of the parameters
and goodness of fit of the residuals of each model. The main conclusions are
summarized in Section 4.

Model development

Time series models are a very effective tool for modelling data recorded sequentially over time. The objective of this methodology is to capture the
time dependence between observations through a mathematical model that
allows the description of the main characteristics of the data. In general,
these records present trends and seasonal components which can be modelled by different statistical techniques. In what follows, a description of
the most used models in time series will be made; such as ARIMA(p, d, q)
processes, a random walk with trend for count data, among others.
• ARIMA Model
(1 − B)d φ(B) Xt = µ + θ(B) + εt , con {εt } ∼ RB(0, σ 2 ),
where d is the positive integer parameter of integration, φ(z) = 1 −

model to predict the propagation of Covid-19 in Nigeria, for more details of this model the reader is referred to the time series book written
by Brockwell and Davis (1991).
• Poisson Model
Another model for working with time-series count data is the Poisson
process with a local linear trend model defined by
Xt
∼ P o(eWt ),
Wt = µt + εt , with {εt } ∼ N (0, σε2 ),
µt+1 = µt + νt + ξt with {ξt } ∼ N (0, σξ2 ),
νt+1 = νt + ζt , with {ζt } ∼ N (0, σζ2 ),
where µt is a random walk with a drift component given by νt and
{εt } is a white noise process which captures the extra variations of
the time series. The Model 2 estimates and predictions will be made
through two methodologies that are widely discussed in the literature
(Durbin and Koopman (2012), Robert and Casella (2013) among other
authors), namely
a) Space-state models
b) Bayesian analysis.
For Model 2b) we consider a random walk of order 1, i.e.,
W t = α + µt
µt − µt−1
∼ N (0, σξ2 ),
where σξ2 is estimated as precision 1/σξ2 in Bayesian framework.
• GLARMA(p, q) Model
On the other hand, Dunsmuir (2015) provided other methology for account data with serial dependence in regression modeling of time series
called generalized linear autoregressive moving average (GLARMA(p, q))
models defined by

• Holt’s local trend and Damped trend method
Finally, Holt (1957) and Winters (1960) proposed a methodology known
as Holt-Winters method. This method is a more general class than the
exponential smoothing method which explains the level and trend as
follows

Level:
Trend:

bt+h|t = µt + hTt

µt = αXt + (1 − α)(µt−1 + Tt−1 )
Tt = β(µt − µt−1 ) + (1 − β)Tt−1 ,

where 0 ≤ α ≤ 1 is the smoothing parameter, 0 ≤ β ≤ 1 is the smoothbt+h|t are
ing parameter for the trend. The h-step ahead forecasts X
calculated using the smoothing equations for the level µt and the trend
Tt . Gardner Jr and McKenzie (1985) have developed an exponential
smoothing model designed to damp erratic trends defined as follows
bt+h|t = µt + (φ1 + φ21 + . . . + φh−1

µt = αXt + (1 − α)(µt−1 + φ1 Tt−1 )

where 0 < φ1 < 1 is damping parameter. Its dampens the trend to be
more conservative for longer forecast horizons.

by Covid-19 in Chile from March 2, 2020 to July 14. For the estimations,
we used the R free software (Team (2017)). Table 1 shows the parameter
estimates and the estimated SD (in parentheses) of the Model 1-4 for both
time series (confirmed and deaths cases). For Model 1, an ARIMA(0, 1, 2)
model with a drift to confirmed cases and an ARIMA(0, 2, 3) model without drift to death cases is proposed. Arima command from the forecast
package, whereas KFAS package (Helske (2016)) is used for Model 2a) and
integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) provided by the package
INLA (Lindgren et al. (2015)) for the estimation of Model 2b). The estimates
of Model 3 are based in GLARMA package (Dunsmuir et al., 2015). For the
confirmed cases data we propose a GLARMA(2, 0) whereas for death data a
GLARMA(1, 0) is propose, both models with νt = 1. Additionally, we use
the holt command from the forecast package to estimate the parameters
of Model 4a and 4b by adding the argument damped=TRUE. Figures 2-3 displays the fitted values for each Model, the dashed lines represents the actual
data, while continuous line represents the fitted values which are shown in
coloured curves for Models 1-4. From these figures, we can conclude that
the best model that captures the trend and time dependence characteristics are Models 2. Figure 4-5 presents the sample autocorrelation function
(ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF) of the residuals of the
estimated models for both data set. From these Figures, it seems that there
in no significant autocorrelations in the residuals, except for the Model 3. In
what follows, we will evaluate the predictive power of the proposed models.

from July 07 to July 14 (validation period) which will be used to m-stepbN +1 , . . . , X

In the case of confirmed cases all indicators in favor of the ARIMA model,
i.e., Model 1 with a MAPE of the 17.5% and for the deaths Covid-19 cases
the statistics favor to damped trend method, i.e., Model 4b with MAPE
equal to 0.37% which is reasonably low values demonstrating the suitability
of the proposed model for prediction. The above is supported by the Figures
6-7.

Conclusions

In this paper we have proposed a comparative analysis of the most used time
series models in sequential data modeling. In particular, an ARIMA model,
space-state model, a Bayessian model for counting data, and exponential
smoothing techniques were proposed. The main motivation of this paper
is to contribute to the discussion on the mathematics models to provide
predictions of confirmeds and deaths cases related to the Covid-19 and thus
have relevant information for a timely decision taken by the Government of
Chile.
The database used in this paper allows us to say that for the confirmed

Confirmed cases

Deaths cases

Covid-19 cases the best model corresponds to a well-known Autoregressive
Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) time-series model, whereas for deaths
from Covid-19 in Chile the best model resulted in damped trend method. In
line with other authors, we can affirm that the proposal of this paper does
not imply its global use in the prediction of confirmed cases and deaths from
Covid-19, since the performance of this model is subject to the biopsychosocial determinants of each country. It would be interesting, in a future work, to
develop Machine Learning techniques to model the behavior of these curves,
subject to the availability of large volumes of data and carry out a statistical
study to correlational the spread of the virus to the Chileans biopsychosocial
determinants.
