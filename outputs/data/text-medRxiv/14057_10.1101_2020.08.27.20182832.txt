ABSTRACT

27

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, is posing a serious

28

threat to global public health. Reverse transcriptase real-time quantitative polymerase

29

chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is widely used as the gold standard for clinical detection of

30

SARS-CoV-2. Due to technical limitations, the reported positive rates of qRT-PCR

31

assay of throat swab samples vary from 30%–60%. Therefore, the evaluation of

32

alternative strategies to overcome the limitations of qRT-PCR is required. A previous

33

study reported that one-step nested (OSN)-qRT-PCR revealed better suitability for

34

detecting SARS-CoV-2. However, information on the analytical performance of

35

OSN-qRT-PCR is insufficient. In this study, we aimed to analyze OSN-qRT-PCR by

36

comparing it with droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) and qRT-PCR by using a dilution

37

series of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviral RNA and a quality assessment panel. The clinical

38

performance of OSN-qRT-PCR was also validated and compared with ddPCR and

39

qRT-PCR using specimens from COVID-19 patients. The LoD (copies/ml) of

40

qRT-PCR, ddPCR, and OSN-qRT-PCR were 520.1 (95% CI): 363.23–1145.69) for

41

ORF1ab and 528.1 (95% CI: 347.7–1248.7) for N, 401.8 (95% CI: 284.8–938.3) for

42

ORF1ab and 336.8 (95% CI: 244.6–792.5) for N, and 194.74 (95% CI: 139.7–430.9)

43

for ORF1ab and 189.1 (95% CI: 130.9–433.9) for N, respectively. Of the 34 clinical

44

samples from COVID-19 patients, the positive rates of OSN-qRT-PCR, ddPCR, and

45

qRT-PCR were 82.35% (28/34), 67.65% (23/34), and 58.82% (20/34), respectively. In

46

conclusion, the highly sensitive and specific OSN-qRT-PCR assay is superior to

47

ddPCR and qRT-PCR assays, showing great potential as a technique for detection of

48

SARS-CoV-2 in patients with low viral loads.

53

The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by infection of

54

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is posing an

55

enormous burden on social, economic, and healthcare systems worldwide[1]. As there

56

is currently no specific treatment option, early detection of SARS-CoV-2-infected

57

patients has facilitated effective isolation and treatment to prevent disease spread.

58

Currently, clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 is mainly confirmed by detecting

59

SARS-CoV-2 RNA using reverse transcriptase real-time quantitative polymerase

60

chain reaction (qRT-PCR)[2–5]. However, the sensitivity and reliability of qRT-PCR

61

has been questioned due to cases of negative results in some patients who were highly

62

suspected of having the disease based on clinical presentation and exposure history

63

[6,7]

64

Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) is a third generation PCR based on the principles of

65

limited dilution and Poisson statistics[8,9], which works by separating a sample into

66

thousands to millions of droplets and then partitioning them to be read as either

67

positive or negative depending on fluorescence amplitude[10–13]. These vast and highly

68

consistent oil droplets substantially improve the detection dynamic range and

69

accuracy of ddPCR[14]. In recent years, ddPCR has found many applications, such as

70

analysis of viral load from clinical samples, detection of rare mutations, analysis of

71

copy number variation (CNV), and precise miRNA quantification [15–17].

72

Given the high sensitivity of ddPCR, Zhao JK et al. utilized this technique to evaluate

73

the viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 from upper respiratory tract specimens for the first

74

time, showing that ddPCR can accurately reflect the viral loads of such specimens,

75

especially nasopharyngeal swabs[18]. Subsequently, Renfei Lu et al. used serial

76

dilutions of the same clinical samples to demonstrate that the LoD of ddPCR is at

77

least 10 times better than that of qRT-PCR[19]. However, the limitation of the ddPCR

78

assay is that it often needs unique supporting reagents, instruments, and professional

79

operators, causing high running costs with moderate throughput. More convenient and

80

sensitive methods are urgently needed as alternative diagnostic approaches for

81

detecting SARS-CoV-2.

82

Nested PCR typically utilizes two sequential amplification reactions, each of which

83

uses a different pair of primers, resulting in an increase in sensitivity and specificity.

84

The product of the first amplification reaction is used as the template for the second,

85

which is primed by oligonucleotides that are placed internal to the first primer pair.

86

The use of two pairs of oligonucleotides allows for a higher number of cycles to be

87

performed, thereby increasing the sensitivity of the PCR. Feng ZS et al. previously

88

developed a novel locked nucleic acid (LNA)-based one-step single-tube nested

89

(OSN)-qRT-PCR strategy to detect viral and bacterial pathogens with higher

90

sensitivity and specificity than qRT-PCR and without the need of lid opening[20]. To

91

improve the diagnostic accuracy of nucleic acid detection of SARS-CoV-2 in low

92

viral load samples, they developed and evaluated the sensitivity and accuracy of

93

OSN-qRT-PCR in detecting SARS-CoV-2[21]. However, the analytical performance of

94

OSN-qRT-PCR in the published study is insufficient, lacking information such as

95

specificity, reportable range, and the limit of detection (LoD). In addition, no studies

96

have been conducted comparing the clinical application value of OSN-qRT-PCR and

97

ddPCR for detecting SARS-CoV-2.

98

Here we provide a comparison of OSN-qRT-PCR and ddPCR with qRT-PCR using a

99

dilution series of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviral RNA and clinical samples. The detectable

100

range and sensitivity of each assay were determined and clinical samples (n = 34)

101

were used to validate clinical sensitivity and specificity. Compared with qRT-PCR and

102

ddPCR, OSN-qRT-PCR showed higher sensitivity and greater practicality, making it

103

better suited for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in low viral load samples.

110

Specimen collection. We retrospectively identified 24 hospitalized patients clinically

111

diagnosed with COVID-19 between January 30, 2020, and February 17, 2020, in The

112

Second People’s Hospital of Fuyang. Throat (n = 18) and anal (n = 4) swabs, sputum

113

(n = 10), and blood (n = 2) samples were collected from the enrolled patients. All

114

aspects of the study were performed according to national ethics regulations and

115

approved by the Institutional Review Boards of China Center for Disease Control and

116

Prevention (CDC). Written consent was obtained from patients or children’s parents.

117

SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus preparation. The SARS-CoV-2 reference sequence was

118

synthesized and cloned into a lentiviral vector and pseudovirus was prepared in 293T

119

cells. The obtained pseudovirus contained RNA sequences of the ORF1ab and N

120

genes in the lentiviral genome. The SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus used in qRT-PCR and

121

OSN-qRT-PCR was synthesized and processed by BDS company (DA’an, Guangzhou,

122

China) at a RNA concentration of 2.0 × 104 copies/ml. The SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus

123

used in ddPCR was synthesized and processed by BioPerfectus Technologies Co.

124

(Taizhou, China) at a RNA concentration of 1.5 × 105 copies/ml. The SARS-CoV-2

125

pseudoviral RNA was diluted with pseudovirus diluent (dilution ratio and method is

126

shown in table 1), and SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviral RNA of the diluted samples S1, S2,

127

S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, and S8 were extracted by using membrane adsorption kits (Di’an,

128

Hangzhou, China).

129

RNA extraction. Total RNA from throat and anal swabs, sputum, and blood samples

130

from each patient was extracted from supernatants using Reagent of Nucleic Acid

131

Extraction or Purification (Di’an, Hangzhou, China) following the manufacturer’s

132

instructions. SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection was mainly targeted at the

133

two-segment conserved gene sequence of its genome, located at ORF1ab and N.

134

ddPCR workflow. Reaction components of the ddPCR assay kit (BioPerfectus)

135

included 5 µl of Supermix, 2 µl of reverse transcriptase, 1 µl of 300 mM DTT, 5 µl of

136

SARS-CoV-2 reaction solution, and 7 µl template. All procedures followed the

137

manufacturer’s instructions for the QX200 Droplet Digital PCR System using

138

Supermix for the probe (no dUTP) (Bio-Rad, Hercules, USA). 20 µl of each reaction

139

mix was converted to droplets with the QX200 droplet generator. Droplet-partitioned

140

samples were then transferred to a 96-well plate, sealed, and cycled in a C1000 Touch

141

Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad) under the following cycling protocol: 50°C for 60 min and

142

95°C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 30 s and 56°C for 1 min, then

143

98°C for 10 min and 4°C hold. FAM (ORF1ab) and HEX (N) channels were selected

144

to detect SARS-CoV-2. The cycled plate was then transferred and FAM and HEX

145

channels read using the QX200 reader. Each run contained positive and negative

146

controls. Samples were only considered positive when both FAM and HEX channels

147

had signals.

148

OSN-qRT-PCR workflow. Reaction components of the OSN-qRT-PCR assay kit

149

(Sansure, Changsha, China) included 20 µl of template, 26 µl of reaction buffer, and 4

150

µl of the enzyme mixture. After vortexing and centrifugation, the reaction tube was

151

transferred to the LightCycler 480 II Real-Time PCR System (Roche, Basel,

152

Switzerland). The OSN-qRT-PCR amplification reaction contained the following

153

steps: 50°C for 30 min, 95°C for 1 min, 20 cycles at 95°C for 30 s, 70°C for 40 s, and

154

72°C for 40s, followed by 40 cycles at 95°C for 15 s, 60°C for 30 s, and 25°C for 10 s

155

of instrument cooling. FAM (ORF1ab) and ROX (N) channels were selected to detect

156

SARS-CoV-2, and the VIC channel was chosen to detect the reference gene (human

157

ABL1). Each run contained positive and negative controls. FAM, HEX, and VIC

158

channels all showed typical S-shaped amplification curves. The result was considered

159

valid when the cycle threshold (Ct) value of the reference gene was ≤37. The result

160

was considered positive when the Ct values of both target genes were ≤35 and

161

negative when they were both >35. If only one of the target genes had a Ct value ≤35

162

and the other was >35, it was interpreted as a single-gene positive.

163

qRT-PCR workflow. The qRT-PCR kit (DaAn Gene; Guangzhou, China) included 17

164

µl of SARS-CoV-2 NC reaction solution A, 3 µl of NC reaction solution B, and 5 µl

165

of template. After vortexing and centrifugation, the reaction tube was transferred to

166

the LightCycler 480 II Real-Time PCR System (Roche). The qRT-PCR amplification

167

reaction contained the following steps: 50°C for 15 min, 95°C for 15 min, 45 cycles at

168

94°C for 15 s, and 55°C for 45 s. FAM (N) and VIC (ORF1ab) channels were selected

169

to detect SARS-CoV-2, and the CY5 channel was chosen to detect the reference gene

170

(human ABL1). The result was considered valid when the Ct value of the reference

171

gene was ≤37. The result was considered positive when the Ct values of both target

172

genes (ORF1ab and N) were ≤37 and were considered negative when they were

173

both >40. If only one of the target genes had a Ct value fall in the gray zone (37–40),

174

it was retested. If the repeated result was positive for only one of two targets genes, it

175

was interpreted as positive.

176

Dynamic range and LoD of OSN-qRT-PCR, ddPCR, and qRT-PCR. To evaluate

177

the dynamic range and consistency of OSN-qRT-PCR, ddPCR, and qRT-PCR, we first

178

ran a serial dilution of the linear RNA standard for each assay. To determine the LoD,

179

the lower concentration RNA standards (including S3–S8) were analyzed 14 times.

180

The LoD was calculated by Probit regression analysis with a 95% repeatable

181

probability.

182

Data statistical analysis. Analysis of the ddPCR data was performed with Quanta

183

Soft Analysis Software v1.7.4 to calculate the concentration of the target. Plots of

184

linear regression were conducted with GraphPad Prism 7.0, and Probit analysis for

185

LoD was conducted with MedCalc software v19.2.1. Bland-Altman analysis of

186

qRT-PCR, OSN-qRT-PCR, and ddPCR results for patient samples was evaluated by

187

SPSS 23.0 statistical software.

RESULTS

190

Comparison of the reportable range of each assay. To compare the reportable range

191

of qRT-PCR, OSN-qRT-PCR, and ddPCR, the SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviral RNA

192

standard was serially diluted from 2 × 104 to 20 copies/ml for qRT-PCR and

193

OSN-qRT-PCR, and from 1 × 105 to 150 copies/ml for ddPCR. As shown in figure 1,

194

the detectable range of qRT-PCR was 500 to 2 × 104 copies/ml for ORF1ab and N,

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.27.20182832; this version posted September 1, 2020. The copyright holder for this

195

with R2 = 0.9985 and 0.9967, respectively (Fig. 1a,b). The detectable range of

196

OSN-qRT-PCR was 100 to 2 × 104 copies/ml for ORF1ab and 50 to 2 × 104 copies/ml

197

for N, with R2 = 0.9874 and 0.9936, respectively (Fig. 1c,d). Likewise, the detectable

198

range of ddPCR was 250 to 1.5 × 105 copies/ml for ORF1ab and N, with R2 = 0.9983

199

and 0.9984, respectively (Fig. 1e,f). These results show that the minimum detection

200

range of OSN-qRT-PCR is significantly lower than those of qRT-PCR and ddPCR.

201

Moreover, both OSN-qRT-PCR and ddPCR results displayed good linearity,

202

suggesting that both assays can reliably detect SARS-CoV-2.

203

In addition, we compared the correlation between OSN-qRT-PCR and ddPCR with

204

qRT-PCR and, as shown in figure 2, found that the Pearson correlation coefficients

205

between qRT-PCR and OSN-qRT-PCR were 0.887 for ORF1ab and 0.742 for N (Fig.

206

2a,b), and -0.924 for ORF1ab and -0.844 for N between qRT-PCR and ddPCR (Fig.

207

2c,d). The good correlation between qRT-PCR with the other two assays further

208

confirms that OSN-qRT-PCR and ddPCR are suitable methods for detecting

209

SARS-CoV-2.

210

Comparison of the LoD for each assay. A variety of procedures are available for

211

establishing the LoD for laboratory assays. The LoD is generally determined in one of

212

two ways: either (i) statistically, by calculating the point at which a signal can be

213

distinguished from background, or (ii) empirically, by testing serial dilutions of

214

samples with a known concentration of the target substance in the analytical range of

215

the expected detection limit. For medical applications of molecular assays, it is

216

generally more meaningful to use the empirical method to estimate the detection limit.

217

The LoD was calculated by Probit regression analysis with a 95% repeatable

218

probability, which is a commonly used method when empirically determining the

219

limit of analyte that can be reliably detected. A series of linear SARS-CoV-2

220

pseudoviral RNA concentrations (including S3–S8) were prepared by diluting a

221

high-concentration standard, with each concentration tested with 14 replicates. As

222

shown in figure 3 and table 2, the LoD of qRT-PCR was 520.1 (95% confidence

223

interval (CI): 363.23–1145.69) and 528.1 (95% CI: 347.7–1248.7) copies/ml for

224

ORF1ab and N, respectively (Fig. 3a,b). The qRT-PCR kit claims a detection

225

sensitivity of 500 copies/ml and was officially approved by the National Medical

226

Products Administration (NMPA) and used for the detection of COVID-19 nationwide.

227

Our LoD result was consistent with this claimed detection limit.

228

In contrast, the LoD of OSN-qRT-PCR was 194.74 (95% CI: 139.7–430.9) and 189.1

229

(95% CI: 130.9–433.9) copies/ml for ORF1ab and N, respectively (Fig. 3c,d), while

230

the LoD of ddPCR was 401.8 (95% CI: 284.8–938.3) and 336.8 (95% CI: 244.6–

231

792.5) copies/ml for ORF1ab and N, respectively (Fig. 3e,f). Taken together, these

232

results show that the sensitivity of OSN-qRT-PCR is higher than both ddPCR and

233

qRT-PCR, with ddPCR being more sensitive than qRT-PCR.

234

Comparison

235

inter-laboratory quality assessment panels. A series of linear SARS-CoV-2

236

pseudoviral RNA concentrations (including S0–S6) were tested in triplicates within

237

the same run. As shown in table 3, the coefficient of variation (CV) values of

238

intra-assays

239

OSN-qRT-PCR, and 2.04%–11.18% for ddPCR. Overall, these results show that

240

qRT-PCR and OSN-qRT-PCR assays demonstrate good repeatability. The cause of the

241

unstable ddPCR results may be a consequence of differences in the number of

242

microspheres due to poor machine operation by the experimenter.

243

The inter-laboratory quality assessment panel provided by the National Center for

244

Clinical Laboratories (NCCL) is used for evaluation of a laboratory's ability to detect

245

nucleic acids of SARS-CoV-2. This panel includes a total of 10 samples named as

246

202001–202010. As shown in table 4, the test results of each assay using this panel

247

indicate that both OSN-qRT-PCR and ddPCR assays showed 100% specificity for

248

detecting SARS-CoV-2 and were negative for other human coronaviruses.

patients diagnosed in the acute phase of infection were analyzed by each assay. The

greater than the LoD of ORF1ab and N primers/probe sets. The results of qRT-PCR,

while 28 tested positive by OSN-qRT-PCR (positive rate = 82.35%). In addition, 23

257

tested positive by ddPCR (positive rate = 67.65%), indicating a higher sensitivity than

258

qRT-PCR but lower than OSN-qRT-PCR. These results were further analyzed by the

259

Bland–Altman method, which reveals the agreement between two independent

260

methods. As shown in figure 4, OSN-qRT-PCR and ddPCR results were in good

261

agreement with qRT-PCR. Therefore, both OSN-qRT-PCR and ddPCR assays proved

262

capable of detecting SARS-CoV-2 in patient specimens.

263

Comparison of the positive rates of different specimen types from COVID-19

264

patients. A previous study revealed that SARS-CoV-2 exists in both the upper and

265

lower respiratory tract[22]. We collected simultaneous sputum and throat swabs from a

266

total of 10 COVID-19-confirmed patients diagnosed in the acute phase of infection

267

and the three methods were used to detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. As shown in

268

table 7, the positive rates in sputum samples for all three methods were significantly

269

higher than those of throat swabs. In addition, we also collected blood specimens (n =

270

2) and anal swab specimens (n = 4) from COVID-19-confirmed patients to analyze

271

the detection ability of the assays for other specimen types. As shown in table 4, for

272

blood specimens (29# and 30#), qRT-PCR and ddPCR results were both negative,

273

while the OSN-qRT-PCR result was positive. For anal swab specimens (31#–34#),

274

only one case was positive by ddPCR and qRT-PCR assay, while all four were

275

positive by OSN-qRT-PCR. It is evident from these results that among the three

276

methods, OSN-qRT-PCR has the greatest sensitivity for detecting SARS-CoV-2 from

277

different specimen types.

DISCUSSION

280

The clinical detection sensitivity of qRT-PCR is affected by various factors, such as

281

the nucleic acid extraction method, the one-step qRT-PCR reagent used, and the

282

primer/probe sets[23]. It has been reported that seven commercial qRT-PCR detection

283

kits revealed significant differences in the detection ability for weakly positive

284

samples[24]. ddPCR has exhibited higher sensitivity and precision than classical

285

qRT-PCR[25,26]. Recent studies have confirmed that both ddPCR and OSN-qRT-PCR

286

are strongly recommended in clinical practice for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and for

287

follow-up of positive patients until complete remission[21,27]. However, ddPCR is

288

limited to special equipment, which hinders its clinical application. Compared with

289

ddPCR, the advantage of OSN-qRT-PCR is greater practicality because of easier

290

adaptation for laboratories already equipped with traditional real-time PCR machines.

291

Here, for the first time, we provide a head-to-head comparison of OSN-qRT-PCR and

292

ddPCR with qRT-PCR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 using a pseudoviral RNA

293

standard, inter-laboratory quality assessment panel, and clinical samples of different

294

types. The detectable range, consistency, specificity, and LoD of each method were

295

comparably analyzed. Our results demonstrate that OSN-qRT-PCR and ddPCR are

296

reliable for quantitatively detecting SARS-CoV-2. In addition, Bland–Altman analysis

297

showed that ddPCR and OSN-qRT-PCR had good correlation with qRT-PCR in

298

testing clinical specimens. In particular, the detection performance of both

299

OSN-qRT-PCR and ddPCR assays were better than qRT-PCR, and the OSN-qRT-PCR

300

assay had the lowest LoD, suggesting that OSN-qRT-PCR and ddPCR assays are

301

valuable additions for detecting SARS-COV-2 in samples with low viral loads.

302

Although the sensitivity of OSN-qRT-PCR was reported to be 10-fold higher than

303

qRT-PCR using plasmids[21], our results revealed that the sensitivity of

304

OSN-qRT-PCR was only 2–3-fold higher than qRT-PCR when using pseudoviral

305

RNA.

306

A previous study revealed that SARS-CoV-2 exists in both the upper and lower

307

respiratory tract and that the viral load in sputum is higher than that of throat swabs

308

[28]

309

respiratory tract, lower respiratory tract samples better reflect the viral replication

310

level in infected patients. Although OSN-qRT-PCR and ddPCR both exhibited higher

311

sensitivity than qRT-PCR, there were still false negative results (six missed by

312

OSN-qRT-PCR, 11 missed by ddPCR) when analyzing clinical specimens. This may

313

have been due to the quality of sample collection or viral loads falling below detection

314

limits resulting from missing the optimum sample collection time. For specimen 20#,

315

the results of OSN-qRT-PCR and qRT-PCR were negative, while ddPCR was positive.

316

This discordant result may have been due to the specimen type (sputum) or the various

317

influencing factors in the nucleic acid extraction process, leading to poor stability of

318

test results.

319

This study had several limitations. First, the SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviral RNA

320

concentration used in the study for exploring detectable ranges did not include high

321

concentrations. Second, the clinical specimens were only from COVID-19-confirmed

322

patients in the acute phase of infection; clinical specimens from patients in the

323

recovery phase or suspected patients were not included. Finally, our study was limited

324

by a small sample size and thus conclusions should be interpreted with caution and

325

confirmed by further studies.

. Our findings also confirmed that although SARS-CoV-2 can colonize the upper

326
327

CONCLUSION

328

We validated the implementation of OSN-qRT-PCR and ddPCR systems as new

329

alternatives to qRT-PCR for the sensitive and accurate quantification of SARS-CoV-2,

330

especially in samples with low viral loads. Considering its sensitivity and practicality,

331

OSN-qRT-PCR is a highly valuable and feasible method that offers the potential to

332

facilitate clinical diagnoses and decision-making for patients with COVID-19.
