Summary
Background: Isolation, contact tracing and restrictions on social movement are being globally
implemented to prevent and control onward spread of SARS-CoV-2, even though the infection
risk modelled on RNA detection by RT-qPCR remains biased as viral shedding and infectivity are
not discerned. Thus, we aimed to develop a rapid viability RT-qPCR procedure to infer SARS-CoV2 infectivity in clinical specimens and environmental samples. Methods: We screened
monoazide dyes and platinum compounds as viability molecular markers on five SARS-CoV-2
RNA targets. A platinum chloride-based viability RT-qPCR was then optimized using genomic
RNA, and inactivated SARS-CoV-2 particles inoculated in buffer, stool, and urine. Our results
were finally validated in nasopharyngeal swabs from persons who tested positive for COVID-19
and in wastewater samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Findings: We established a rapid
viability RT-qPCR that selectively detects potentially infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles in complex
matrices. In particular, the confirmed positivity of nasopharyngeal swabs following the viability
procedure suggests their potential infectivity, while the complete prevention of amplification in
wastewater indicated either non-infectious particles or free RNA. Interpretation: The viability
RT-qPCR approach provides a more accurate ascertainment of the infectious viruses detection
and it may complement analyses to foster risk-based investigations for the prevention and
control of new or re-occurring outbreaks with a broad application spectrum. Fundings: This work
was supported by Spanish Scientific Research Council (CSIC), Generalitat Valenciana, and
MICINN co-founded by AEI/FEDER, UE.

Introduction
The rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to
an unprecedented global health and economic crisis. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Coronaviridae
family, which includes enveloped RNA viruses causing respiratory, enteric, and systemic
infections in a wide range of hosts, including humans and animals. Human coronaviruses have
been traditionally considered responsible for endemic infections causing common cold
symptoms, as in the cases of HKU1, 229E, OC43, and NL63 viruses, while more recently Middle
East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV produced more severe
epidemics in the Arabian Peninsula and in Asia. COVID-19 symptoms range from mild to severe,
in which severe pneumonia and respiratory distress syndrome can lead to death. However, a
significant number of infected people are asymptomatic, making the epidemiological control
even more challenging.
SARS-CoV-2 is an airborne human pathogen primarily transmitted through droplets and
aerosols, even though its detection in urine and faecal specimens raised the hypothesis of the
possible fecal-oral transmission further sustained by the successful viral replication in cell
culture.(1,2) To control SARS-CoV-2 spread, extreme containment measures have been enforced
worldwide along with several epidemiological surveillance strategies, which include tracing
confirmed and suspected cases by clinical testing (e.g., SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid or antigen tests
on nasal or oral swabs or saliva samples), and monitoring community transmission by
wastewater analysis (known as Wastewater Based Epidemiology, WBE).(3)
In this context, several molecular assays based on real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase
chain reaction (RT-qPCR) have been developed to detect and quantify SARS-CoV-2 RNA in clinical
and environmental samples. For instance, a test-based strategy (at least two consecutive
negative RT-qPCR tests) has been widely adopted as a general public health guidance for release
from (self-) isolation, reincorporation into the workplace, and patient transferral. However,
COVID-19 patients can continue to shed viral RNA well beyond clinical recovery and persistent
positive RT-qPCR does not necessarily indicate infectiousness.(4) Besides being a rapid, easy-touse, and cost-effective technique, RT-qPCR informs on the presence of viral RNA that does not
correlate with infectivity, yet such testing is still being used as a surrogate marker of infectivity.(5–
8)
On the contrary, viral replication in permissive cell line(s) represents the conclusive evidence
to assess viral infectivity, and it has been readily available for SARS-CoV-2. Conversely, the facility
requirements needed to handle SARS-CoV-2 infectious materials (biosafety level 3 laboratory,
BSL-3), in addition to the low sensitivity and long turnaround time for results, typically from
three to ten days, limited its extensive implementation for both clinical diagnosis and
environmental risk assessment.(9)
Recently, novel molecular techniques, referred to as capsid integrity or viability qPCR assays
incorporating viability markers such as monoazide dyes and metal compounds into qPCR-based
methods, have been demonstrated to selectively remove false-positive qPCR signals deriving
from free nucleic acids and virions with damaged capsids, finally allowing an estimation on viral
infectivity.(10) However, the application of such techniques for enveloped viruses has not fully
elucidated as it has failed for avian influenza virus (IAV) and infectious laryngotracheitis virus
(ILTV) while it has recently been optimized for porcine epidemic diarrhea coronavirus.(11–13)
Nonetheless, the implementation of this technique has not been explored for SARS-CoV-2.
Methods
Viral materials, viability markers and optimization of viability treatment
SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA (VR-1986D™, ATCC, VA, US), gamma-irradiated (5 × 106 RADs)
(NRC-52287, BEI Resources, VA, US) and heat inactivated (65°C for 30 min) (NR-52286, BEI
Resources, VA, US) viral particles preparations all obtained from isolate USA-WA1/2020 were
used for initial screening of viability markers. Specifically, monoazide photoactivatable dyes and
platinum compounds were initially screened as viability marker candidates using SARS-CoV-2
genomic RNA, gamma-inactivated, and heat inactivated SARS-CoV-2 suspensions. Viability
marker stock solutions were prepared as follows and stored at −20 °C for later use: ethidium

monoazide (EMA™, Geniul, Spain) was diluted in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to 2·0 mM, PEMAX™
(Geniul, Spain) and propidium monoazide (PMAxx™, Biotium, CA, US) were diluted in nucleasefree water to 4·0 mM, platinum (IV) chloride (PtCl4; Acros Organics, NJ, US) and cisdiamineplatinum (II) dichloride (CDDP; Sigma-Aldrich, MO, US) salts were dissolved in DMSO to
1·0 M and further diluted in nuclease-free water to 50 mM. Viability assays were carried out by
treating 300 µL of either genomic SARS-CoV-2 RNA (approx. 103 gc/mL), gamma-inactivated
(approx. 105 gc/mL), and heat inactivated SARS-CoV-2 (approx. 105 gc/mL) suspensions with final
concentrations of 50-100 µM photoactivatable dyes (PMAxx™, PEMAX™, or EMA™) or 0·1-2·0
mM platinum compounds (CDDP or PtCl4) in DNA LoBind tubes (Eppendorf, Germany).
Photoactivation of monoazide dyes was achieved by 10 min of dark-incubation in an orbital
shaker (150 rpm) at room temperature (RT) followed by 15 min blue LED light exposure in a
photo-activation system (Led-Active Blue, GenIUL). Alternatively, 30 min incubation at RT in an
orbital shaker (150 rpm) were used for viability treatments with platinum compounds. A control
consisting of genomic RNA or virus suspension without viability marker was included in each
assay. Following the viability treatment, the viral RNA was immediately purified as described
hereafter.
Assessment of PtCl4 viability RT-qPCR in artificially inoculated and validation in naturally
contaminated samples
Platinum (IV) chloride was selected as the most reliable viability marker and tested at final
concentrations of 0·5 to 5·0 mM for viability RT-qPCR optimization in stool, urine,
nasopharyngeal swabs and wastewater samples.
For the initial optimization, stool and urine specimens that had tested negative for SARS-CoV-2
were retrieved from IATA biobank. Faecal material was resuspended 1% w/v in phosphatebuffered saline (PBS), and supernatant recovered by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 5 min. Direct
and ten-fold diluted urine, and ten-fold diluted faecal suspension (final 1% w/v faecal dilution)
were spiked with either gamma- and/or heat inactivated SARS-CoV-2 to approximately 105 gc/L
final concentration.
Then, nasopharyngeal swabs from positive COVID-19 patients and naturally contaminated
wastewater samples were used to validate the viability PtCl4 RT-qPCR. Nasopharyngeal swabs
(n=9) from COVID-19 positive patients were originally collected at Hospital Clínico Universitario
de Valencia (Valencia, Spain) and included in this study once de-identified. To test whether the
detection of viral RNA was exclusive for infectious particles, nasopharyngeal swab subsamples
were inactivated at 95 °C for 10 min, included in the experiments along with naïve specimen and
both assayed by RT-qPCR and viability PtCl4 RT-qPCR.
SARS-CoV-2 positive wastewater grabbed samples (n=6) were collected in June-October, 2020
from different wastewater treatments plants involved in a WBE monitoring programme. The
samples were originally concentrated by an aluminium precipitation procedure and tested
positive for at least two RT-qPCR targets (N1, IP4 or E gene).(14) To exclude additional viral
inactivation due to the concentration procedure, wastewater were freshly concentrated by
Centricon-Plus 70 centrifugal ultrafilters units with a cut-off of 100 kDa (Merk-Millipore, MA,
US).(15) Samples were all diluted in PBS as specified. Viability treatment, RNA extraction and
SARS-CoV-2 detection were carried out as hereafter detailed.
Viral RNA purification and SARS-CoV-2 detection
Viral RNA was extracted using Maxwell® RSC 16 instrument and Maxwell RSC Pure Food GMO
and authentication kit (Promega, Spain) and detected by RT-qPCR targeting N1, N2, E gene, IP2
and IP4 regions.(16) Viral RNA from nasopharingeal samples was extracted using a KingFisher™
Flex (Thermo Fisher Scientific) instead. Given the superior sensitivity of N1 RT-qPCR resulting
from the initial screening, this target was used for subsequent determinations. Each RT-qPCR
assay was performed in duplicate and included nuclease-free water as negative control, and
SARS-CoV-2 complete genomic RNA (VR-1986D™, ATCC, VA, US), E gene plasmid (10006896,
2019-nCoV_E Positive Control from Charité/Berlin, IDT, Belgium) or N1/N2 plasmid (10006625,
2019-nCoV_N_Positive Control from CDC, IDT, Belgium) as positive controls. Ten-fold RNA

dilutions were consistently tested to check RT-qPCR inhibition due to viability marker residues
or inhibitory substances in the sample.
Statistical analysis
All data were compiled from three independent experiments with at least two technical
replicates for each variable. Data are presented as median ± SD. Significant differences in median
cycle threshold (Ct) were determined by using either one- or two way(s) ANOVA followed by
Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test on GraphPad Prism version 8·02 (GraphPad Software, US).
Differences in means were considered significant when the p was <0·05.
Results
Initial assessment of viability markers and RT-qPCR assays
With regard to the viability markers tested, platinum compounds were better at preventing PCR
amplification of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA suspension than monoazide dyes, regardless of the
RT-qPCR target (Figure 1). Compared to untreated RNA, significant differences were detected
for PtCl4 and CDDP treated samples in all the five RT-qPCR targets tested. While PtCl4 completely
prevented the RNA amplification for all replicates, it occurred in 5 out of 20 CDDP treated
replicates targeting N1, N2 and IP4. Among photoactivatable dyes, 50 µM PMAxx offered the
best performance as it removed the signal in 8 replicates showing statistically significant
differences for E gene, IP2 and IP4. An additional assay tested 100 µM PMAxx on SARS-CoV-2
genomic RNA without any improvement of the results with respect to 50 µM PMAxx
concentration (data not shown). EMA and PEMAx completely removed RT-qPCR signals in 2 out
of 20 replicates. Given these preliminary results, we further assessed PMAxx and PtCl4 effect on
SARS-CoV-2 gamma- (ca. 8·50 x 105 gc/mL corresponding to 140 TCID50/mL) and heat inactivated
(ca. 1·88 x 105 gc/mL corresponding to 80 TCID50/mL) viral particles by using N1 as the most
sensitive RT-qPCR assay among all the compared targets. PMAxx at 50 µM minimally reduced
the PCR signals by 2·82 and 3·17 Cts with respect to the gamma- and heat inactivated controls,
while the superior ability of PtCl4 was confirmed for both gamma- and heat inactivated SARSCoV-2 viral particles (Figure 2). A final concentration of 1·0 mM PtCl4 was needed to consistently
prevent the amplification of inactivated viruses by viability RT-qPCR. Thus, we further applied
the PtCl4 viability RT-qPCR to high concentrated gamma-inactivated viral suspensions (ca. 8·50 x
106 gc/mL). Results showed that 0·5 and 1·0 mM PtCl4 reduced by 3·4 and 6·8 Cts compared to
the control. Although significant statistical differences were detected for all treatments
regardless of the concentration of the metal compound, only 2·0 mM PtCl4 showed to
consistently prevent signal amplification (only one positive out of 8 replicates, Ct=39·11).
Effect of sample complexity on viability RT-qPCR
To determine the effect of sample matrix on viability RT-qPCR, we spiked 10-fold diluted stool
suspensions (1% w/v final dilution) and urine specimen (10% v/v final dilution) with
approximately 105 gc/mL gamma-inactivated SARS-CoV-2, and applied up to 5·0 mM PtCl4 as
viability marker. Compared to the untreated control, significant differences were observed for
1·0 mM PtCl4 in urine samples or 1·25 mM PtCl4 in stool suspensions (Figure 3). However, a
concentration of 5·0 mM was needed to completely remove the PCR signals in urine, while 2·5
mM PtCl4 prevented the amplification of 1 out of 8 replicates in stool. Although the complete
inhibition of amplification signals was achieved to a limited extent, a sharp difference above one
logarithm of genomic copies (ΔCts≈3·3) was observed in stool and urine samples processed with
1·25 and 3·75 mM PtCl4, respectively.
Viability RT-qPCR validation on positive clinical samples and naturally contaminated
wastewater
Additional experiments were set up to validate viability PtCl4 RT-qPCR on nasopharyngeal swabs
from COVID-19 positive patients and on naturally contaminated wastewater samples. Initial
experiments using undiluted samples achieved unsuccessful results (data not showed), thus
both clinical and wastewater samples were ten-fold diluted in PBS buffer. Nine 10-fold diluted
nasopharyngeal swabs and the corresponding heat-inactivated (95 °C for 10 min) subsamples
were processed by RT-qPCR alone and viability RT-qPCR with either 1·0 or 2·5 mM PtCl4 (Figure

4). Applying 1·0 mM PtCl4 viability RT-qPCR, consistent amplification signals were observed in
both naïve and heat-treated samples with minimal Ct differences compared to RT-qPCR alone.
Increased concentration to 2·5 mM led to a sharper discrimination of PCR signals (ΔCt=9·24 ±
3·59). Similarly, the complete prevention of RT-qPCR signals occurred in one out of four samples
at 1·0 mM PtCl4, and in three out of five samples at 2·5 mM (Figure 4). Regardless of the viability
marker concentration applied, the complete prevention of amplification was observed in
samples with initial low viral titer (Ct values ≥ 30). Moreover, the 2·5 mM PtCl4 viability RT-qPCR
was further validated on six wastewater samples naturally contaminated with SARS-CoV-2. The
results showed that 2·5 mM PtCl4 completely prevented the amplification in all samples (Figure
5).
Discussion
Currently, research projects aiming to assess the risk of transmission and exposure to infectious
virus either in clinical and environmental settings have been limited by the biosafety level-3 (BSL3) conditions needed to handle infectious SARS-CoV-2. The research effort of this investigation
intended to provide a rapid and sensitive analytical method that selectively detects potentially
infectious SARS-CoV-2 in a significantly shorter time than the traditional cell-culture based
method and that can be used in a wide range of applications, including clinical and
environmental COVID-19 monitoring programs as epidemiological response to the pandemic
that is causing such a public health emergency.
This study evaluated photoactivatable monoazide dyes and metal compounds as viability
markers applied prior to nucleic acid extraction to prevent amplification of RNA from non-viable
viral particles, thus enabling amplification only of viable/infectious viruses in downstream RTqPCR assay. Selecting platinum chloride as the best performing viability marker, we
demonstrated that viability RT-qPCR efficiently discriminated free RNAs and inactivated SARSCoV-2 inoculated in buffer, stool and urine suspensions. Then, we further proved that the
method inferred SARS-CoV-2 infectivity better than RT-qPCR alone in both nasopharyngeal
swabs from positive COVID-19 patients and in naturally contaminated wastewater samples. In
the case of complex matrices, increased PtCl4 concentration of 2·5 mM and ten-fold sample
dilution are recommended because of the presence of suspended solids and inhibitors that
hinder the efficacy of the viability treatment.
Our investigation initially included five well-established molecular assays since the length of the
amplicon and/or the richness of secondary structures of targeted RNA may affect the efficiency
of viability treatments.(17,18) We show that metal compounds performed better than monoazide
dyes, irrespective of RT-qPCR assays. However, RT-qPCR targeting N1 region is recommended
because of its superior sensitiveness. This aspect is of importance because complex matrices
needed to be diluted to achieve a more efficient inference of viral infectivity, as demonstrated
in spiked stool and urine, in positive swabs and in contaminated wastewater. Similarly, sample
dilution was needed to implement a viability RT-qPCR targeting norovirus in sewage.(19)
Moreover, N1 assay better fits the testing on samples with expected low viral concentrations
(e.g., environmental samples) and/or PCR inhibitors (e.g., concentrated wastewater, stool). As
N1 assay has been validated in many laboratories worldwide, this viability method could also be
easily and widely implemented.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on a rapid molecular assay independent
from viral replication in cell culture developed to test SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. A recent
investigation by our group demonstrated the suitability of viability RT-qPCRs to infer the
infectivity of porcine epidemic diarrhea coronavirus, member of the genus Alphacoronavirus
within Coronaviridae family.(13) Interestingly, we were able to demonstrate that PMAxx viability
RT-qPCR matched the thermal inactivation pattern obtained by cell culture better than other
viability markers, including PtCl4, and RT-qPCR alone.
Alternative rapid methods to assess the viability of enveloped viruses have been explored with
unsuccessful results. These included propidium monoazide and immunomagnetic separation
tested on laryngotracheitis virus and ethidium monoazide on avian influenza virus.(11,12) It is

worth to report that we also tested on inactivated SARS-CoV-2 suspensions a porcine gastric
mucine in situ capture RT-qPCR, a method that was originally implemented in our laboratory for
human enteric viruses.(20) Although proper SARS-CoV-2 infectious controls could not be included,
those experiments resulted in inconclusive outcomes (data not shown).
Our viability RT-qPCR results of nasopharyngeal swabs from positive COVID-19 patients indicate
the potential infectivity of the samples, while naturally contaminated wastewater are unlikely
to contain infectious viral particles. These later findings reflect the viral replication in cell culture
from RNA positive stool and respiratory samples as well as the unsuccessful attempts to isolate
and cultivate SARS-CoV-2 from wastewater samples.(21–23)
Our findings are clinically relevant as RT-qPCR has become the primary method to diagnose
COVID-19. However, as it detects RNA, its ability to determine the infectivity of patients is
limited.(5–8) In addition, the immune system can neutralise SARS-CoV-2 preventing subsequent
infection but not eliminating nucleic acid, which degrades slowly over time. This has been
confirmed in cohort studies that concluded that seroconversion does not necessarily lead to the
elimination of viral RNA, with cases being RT-PCR positive up to > 63 days after symptom onset
despite having neutralizing antibodies.(24–26) Furthermore, some reports correlated the
infectiousness of upper respiratory tract samples with RT-qPCR Ct values in COVID-19 cases.
Analysing a large dataset (n=324), Singanayagam and colleagues demonstrated that the
probability of viral recovery from samples with 27.5 < Ct < 30 was ≈66%, decreasing to ≈ 28% for
30 < Ct < 35, and to 8·3% for Ct > 35.(23) Similarly, Bullard observed SARS-CoV-2 cell infectivity
only for respiratory specimens sampled < 8 days symptom onset with Ct < 24.(27) However, viral
replication was also obtained from samples with elevated Ct values of 36-39.(7,28)
Notwithstanding, the correlation between RNA and virus isolation remains unclear.
Unfortunately, we had no access to clinical samples with higher Ct values which are likely to
contain non-infectious particles to contrast such hypothesis by the proposed viability RT-qPCR.
In addition, the ratio between viral shedding and infectivity has been reported to vary along the
course of the infection.(4,6,22) This information regarding epidemiological characteristics,
symptom history and relevant sampling details included in medical records could have explained
at least in part the different performances of viability RT-qPCR among clinical samples, however
it could not be retrieved as de-identified specimens were analysed in this study.
Despite the viability treatment, we detected residual signals in heat inactivated nasopharyngeal
swabs. This could be attributed to the viral envelop and nucleoproteins that limit the access
and/or the binding of viability markers to SARS-CoV-2 RNA, as hypothesised for avian influenza
virus and bacteriophage T4. (12,29) The enveloped structure of coronaviruses may also explain the
increased concentration of viability markers needed for SARS-CoV-2 and PEDV compared to
human enteric viruses.(13,19,30) This cumbersome finding obtained by the proposed viability
procedure suggests that the overestimation of the infectivity of a given sample may occur which,
although warranting a careful interpretation, represents a conservative prediction. With regards
to wastewater samples that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, they most probably contained
detergents and chemicals that are detrimental to viral infectivity further supporting the efficacy
of the viability RT-qPCR in discriminating potentially infectious and inactivated viral particles.(31)
The ultimate confirmation on the infectivity of the samples by cell culture, although
recommendable, could not be provided. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 by either culture and viability
RT-qPCR is valuable as a proxy for infectiousness; however, as the human infectious dose
remains unknown, the significance of low titres of infectious virus for human-to-human
transmission remains uncertain. Above all, as some individuals reportedly remain PCR positive
weeks after SARS-CoV-2 infection recovery, knowing whether viral RNA in these persistent
carriers is contagious provides key insights for quarantine policy, to safely discontinue selfisolation and contact tracing as essential public health measures to definitively prevent
transmission.(6,26,32) Besides some limitations, the proposed viability RT-qPCR effectively reduced
the amplification signals of non-infectious and free RNA of SARS-CoV-2 in complex matrices
finally providing a better estimation of the infectiousness of samples. Thus, mathematical

models derived from laboratory scale experiments comparing viability RT-qPCR and viral
replication could correlate viral load and infectivity, finally providing relevant tools of interest
based on rapid molecular assay for prevention strategies and risk assessment.
Conclusions
In conclusion, the use of pre-treatments to prevent RT-qPCR amplification of RNA from noninfectious SARS-CoV-2 using platinum chloride as a viability marker of infectivity was
implemented in stool and urine samples and successfully validated in naturally contaminated
wastewater samples, supporting the idea that SARS-CoV-2 present in sewage is not infectious.
Residual amplification signals in nasopharyngeal swabs exposed to heat-inactivation
overestimated the amount of viable virus, still providing a conservative interpretation of the
infectiousness of the sample. Our study proposes a rapid analytical tool based on viability RTqPCR to infer SARS-CoV-2 infectivity with potential application in risk assessment, and
prevention and control in public health programmes.

Research in context
Evidence before this study
Previous works have established RT-qPCR methods for the efficient detection of severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in stool, urine and respiratory samples, with the latter being
the most commonly used specimens in tracing COVID-19 cases. Similarly, wastewater-based
epidemiology has been globally implemented to monitor the community spread of the virus.
However, SARS-CoV-2 RNA load in clinical and environmental samples is not indicative of
infectiousness. The distinction between viral shedding and infectivity is important for the
development of prevention policy and quarantine guidelines as well as for the assessment of
the risk of contamination in environmental settings. Some reports correlated RT-PCR Ct value
and culture positivity and there is scientific evidence that persistent PCR positive individuals are
not transmitting at the post-symptomatic stage of infection. However, testing viral replication is
not feasible for large scale clinical screening or for environmental surveillance. In addition, the
biosafety level 3 laboratory requirements needed to handle SARS-CoV-2 infectious materials and
the turnaround time for culture results has also limited investigation on related topics. Previous
works have established rapid viability assays based on RT-qPCR pre-treatments to infer the
potential infectivity of enteric viruses, including norovirus, hepatitis A and E viruses in
environmental and food samples. Unsuccessful attempts were reported for influenza virus and
infectious laryngotracheitis virus, while a viability RT-qPCR for the selective detection of
infectious and heat-inactivated porcine epidemic diarrhea coronavirus, as an enveloped viral
model, was recently proposed. However, the sensitivity and reliability of this method remains
to be shown for SARS-CoV-2.
Added value of this study
We show that SARS-CoV-2 RNA amplification of non-infectious samples can be reproducibly
prevented by processing clinical and wastewater samples by a platinum chloride viability RTqPCR technique. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report on this subject that also
provides the following distinguishing features: (i) the procedure was optimized using standard
materials which include SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA, gamma- and heat inactivated viral particles;
(ii) the preliminary findings were validated in nasopharyngeal swabs from COVID-19 positive
patients and in wastewater samples naturally contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
Overall, this study allows to selectively detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA belonging to potentially
infectious viral particles in complex matrices of interest for epidemiological surveillance and
pandemic control.
Implications of all the available evidence
Extensive lockdown measures are currently allowing to partially mitigate the spread of SARSCoV-2. As such, it is of extreme importance to set up feasible and reliable epidemiological
surveillance strategies that include clinical and environmental monitoring programs.
Information on the infectivity of such samples is the keystone to better define the transmission
route(s) and the risk of exposure. Further developments of predictive models based on such a
viability approach may have a broad range of applications: including risk assessment, food safety
and public health policy.
