ABSTRACT
On March 17, 2020, French authorities implemented a nationwide lockdown to respond
to COVID-19 epidemic and curb the surge of patients requiring critical care, similarly to
other countries. Evaluating the impact of lockdown on population mobility is essential to
quantify achievable reductions and identify the factors driving the changes in social
dynamics that affected viral diffusion. We used temporally resolved travel flows among
1,436 administrative areas of mainland France reconstructed from mobile phone
trajectories. We measured mobility changes before and during lockdown at both local
and country scales. Lockdown caused a 65% reduction in countrywide number of
displacements, and was particularly effective in reducing work-related short-range
mobility, especially during rush hours, and recreational trips. Geographical
heterogeneities showed anomalous increases in long-range movements even before
lockdown announcement that were tightly localized in space. During lockdown, mobility
drops were unevenly distributed across regions. They were strongly associated with
active population, workers employed in sectors highly impacted by lockdown, and
number of hospitalizations per region, and moderately associated with socio-economic
level of the region. Major cities largely shrank their pattern of connectivity, reducing it
mainly to short-range commuting. Lockdown was effective in reducing population
mobility across scales. Caution should be taken in the timing of policy announcements
and implementation, as anomalous mobility followed policy announcements that may
act as seeding events. On the other hand, risk aversion may be beneficial in further
decreasing mobility in largely affected regions. Socio-economic and demographic
constraints to the efficacy of restrictions were also identified. The unveiled links between
geography, demography, and timing of the response to mobility restrictions may help
design interventions that minimize invasiveness while contributing to the current
epidemic response.

INTRODUCTION
French authorities responded to the rapid growth of COVID-19 cases by imposing
heavy restrictions on mobility, as many other countries in Europe and beyond1.
Lockdown was enforced on March 17, 2020, and helped slow down infection rates and
limit the strain on the healthcare system2. As these restrictions are gradually being
phased out, it is essential measure changes in human mobility to (i) quantitatively
determine how imposed measures and recommendations (e.g. regarding telework
where possible, ban of leisure trips) translated into reduced mobility at specific scales
and times, (ii) inform models estimating the effectiveness of the ongoing lockdown in
reducing the epidemic spread2,3, (iii) identify the driving factors associated to
documented reductions to help devising social distancing measures needed for the
post-lockdown phase. Accessing human mobility data is now possible at several spatial
and time scales, and often in nearly real-time. These data have been proven useful in
many epidemiological contexts4 – including for example the West Africa Ebola
epidemic5 – and are being used now for COVID-19 pandemic in many countries6 –
namely, Belgium7, Germany8, India9, Italy10, Poland11, Spain12, UK13, USA14,15.
Mobile phone records are one of the main sources of mobility data. They describe travel
flows among the different locations of a country. These flows can be analyzed over time
to study population patterns, with no information on individual users, safeguarding
privacy6. In this study, we used data provided by Orange Business Service Flux Vision,
and studied how mobility in France changed before and during lockdown. We broke
down our results by trip distance, user age and residency, time of day, and analyzed
regional data and spatial heterogeneities. We investigated behavioral responses to
announcements of interventions, and to the epidemic burden, as well as associations of
mobility reduction with demographic and socioeconomic indicators. Considering the
network of travel connections among French locations, we also identified the most
vulnerable and most resilient connections to the mobility shock induced by lockdown,
with a specific focus on main French cities.

METHODS
Timeline of COVID-19 epidemic in France. Three phases have marked the French
response to COVID-19 epidemic (Figure 1). Phase 1 started on January 10, 2020. Its
aim was to detect imported cases and identify local transmissions through case-contact
investigations. Phase 2 started upon appearance of localized clusters, and added
targeted social distancing interventions around reported clusters (e.g. school closure,
gatherings and public transport bans). Phase 3 was declared on March 14, 2020 when
the virus was recognized to actively circulate in the territory.
Data. Mobility data were provided by the Orange Business Service Flux Vision in the
form of displacement matrices. They comprised origin-destination travel flows among
1436 geographic areas of mainland France. For each pair of locations and any given
day, data were provided stratified by age class (less than 18 years old, 18-64, 65 and
more). Each area belongs to one of 13 regions, which are the subnational administrative
divisions of mainland France. Details on data format and extraction in Appendix S1.

Regional hospitalization data were obtained from Santé publique France16.
We used population data and regional socioeconomic indicators from the French
National Statistical Institute (INSEE)17: i) Fraction of population in the age range 24-59,
which includes most of the population in working age17. ii) Standard of living – 9th decile,
defined as the 9th decile of the household's gross disposable income divided by the
number of consumption units (which measure household size: one unit for the first adult,
0.5 units for each additional person over 14 years of age and 0.3 for each child under
14 years of age).
Employment data were obtained from INSEE, and the French Ministry of Labor18. As
indicator, we used the fraction of employed workers in the sectors mostly affected by
lockdown. These are the sectors in which at least 50% of employees stopped working
(hotels, hospitality, food services, and construction), or had been working remotely
(finance, insurances, IT)18.
Ethics. Mobile phone data were previously anonymized in compliance to strict privacy
requirements, presented to and audited by the French data protection authority (CNIL).
Timeline fit and prediction. To fit and forecast time series we used the forecasting
procedure Prophet by Facebook Open Source19. Prophet decomposes a time series into
non-periodic and periodic components which then are fitted using MCMC (Appendix
S2). We fitted Prophet on traffic flow data from January 6, 2020, to March 9, 2020
(training set of the model), and extrapolated traffic flow after March 9, assuming no
perturbation due to COVID-19 or associated interventions. We then measured the
deviation of observed traffic from the predicted temporal evolution of unperturbed traffic
over time.
Trip analysis. Our analyses were performed on all trips and on trips whose geodesic
distance between location centroids is longer than 100 km (long trips). This cutoff
effectively discards commuting, as ~95% of daily work-related trips are shorter than 100
km17. We distinguished between residents, i.e., users with French SIM cards, and
foreigners. We broke down data in the three age classes. We classified trips by their
time of day: daytime (7am-7pm), nighttime (7pm-7am), and distinguished between
weekdays and weekends. During weekdays we also considered rush hours (7am-9am,
5pm-7pm).
Mobility reduction during lockdown. Computed in a case-crossover framework by
comparing the week starting Monday April 6, 2020 (3 weeks into lockdown), to the week
starting Monday February 3 (control week). The latter was chosen as being before
school holidays, and after strikes of public transport.
Statistical analysis. All statistical analyses were performed in R, version 3.6.1. Twosided significance of Pearson coefficients was determined at a level of 0.05. The
coefficient of variation is defined as the sample standard deviation divided by the
sample mean, expressed in percentage points.
Network analysis. Nodes in the networks represent the geographic locations in which
we divided mainland France, and links represent trips between locations. Links are
directed (trips have origins and destinations), weighted (by the number of trips linking
two locations), and evolve in time. We used standard Python libraries, among which
NetworkX. Link persistence probability at a given week was defined as the probability
that a connection present in the network during week February 3-9 (benchmark week)
was still present in the week under consideration.

Maps. To smooth spatial data, we used a gaussian kernel (Appendix S3). The radius
containing 95% of outgoing traffic from a city was computed by considering all mobility
links that start from that city, each with its geodesic distance. They were included
incrementally from the shortest to the longest, until the cumulative sum of the weights of
the included links reached 95% of the total outgoing traffic.

RESULTS
Behavioral response during the transition period up to lockdown implementation.
While no observable change in mobility occurred during Phase 1 and 2 of the epidemic,
the start of Phase 3 on March 14 had a substantial impact on mobility in France (Fig.
1a). This transition occurred prior to the announcement (March 16) and implementation
(March 17) of lockdown measures, and saw nationwide mobility go from ~60M trips per
day down to ~20M trips after lockdown entered into effect. The shock in mobility spread
out over a transition period lasting almost a week.
Starting March 14, 2020, total flow was significantly below the predicted unperturbed
traffic (outside 95% credible interval), as a likely consequence of the start of Phase 3.
Mobility further decreased on Sunday, March 15, when local elections took place.
Instead, a rise in traffic took place on the day before lockdown enforcement. Traffic
volume on that day was markedly higher than the surrounding days, but still lower than
the predicted baseline, and possibly compatible with the typical Sunday-to-Monday
pattern. Long trips (>100 km) were also significantly – albeit slightly - below the
predicted baseline during the weekend (March 14, 15). They however went back to
seemingly normal values on March 16 – i.e., in agreement with the unperturbed
prediction -, and near-to-normal values on lockdown day. However, this country-level
behavior hid anomalous deviations from the predicted mobility behavior in specific
locations, as Fig. 1b shows. Spikes in outgoing traffic are distinctively visible in Île-deFrance (the region of Paris) and, at the same time, in incoming traffic in Normandy and
Bretagne. They measure the pre-lockdown exodus out of Paris occurring before
lockdown took effect20. Analyses at finer scales within Île-de-France revealed that
anomalous outgoing traffic concentrated in the Paris area, and western Île-de-France.
Similar spikes of outgoing and incoming traffic were also visible in the South East, close
to the Alps, as reported previously20.
Mobility during lockdown. Mobility patterns quickly entered a new equilibrium after
lockdown enforcement, marking the end of the transition period. Using a case-crossover
framework (see Methods), we found that lockdown decreased the overall number of
trips by 65% (20M over 57M trips per day) (Figure 2a). Reduction was stronger for trips
made by foreigners (~85%, 0.25M over 1.62M). Their number of trips was however very
small even before lockdown compared to French residents (3%), therefore we excluded
them from the rest of the analysis. Long-range traffic (>100 km) was disrupted more
severely than average (85% reduction, 0.24M over 1.7M, Fig. 2a). This was likely
associated with a disruption of long-range transportation (trains, flights), and the ban of

leisure-related trips, also confirmed by the almost disappearance of long trips during the
weekend (see below).
Mobility reduction in total trips was homogeneously distributed across age classes (Fig.
2b). When considering only long trips, reduction instead increased with age, as seniors
reduced their trips above 100 km by ~ 90% (30k over 250k).
Drops in mobility were uneven across the time of the day (Fig. 2c). Movements during
rush hours were the most disrupted, the combined effect of school closure and telework
leading to a ~75% reduction (1.2M over 4.6M trips per hour). Daytime movements
during weekends also exhibited a higher-than-average decrease, hinting at a successful
reduction of recreational activities. Nighttime movements during weekdays instead
recorded the lowest reduction, well below average. They might be related to
unavoidable work-related mobility, whose impact is however likely to be limited, as
these movements make up for only ¼ of the total. Long-range mobility almost
completely stopped during weekends (around 95% decrease, 0.17M over 3M trips per
day).
Regional heterogeneities in mobility reduction during lockdown. Traffic reductions
were not homogeneous across the 13 regions of mainland France. Reduction of internal
traffic was above average in 4 regions (Île-de-France, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, Grand
Est, Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur), whereas markedly below average in BourgogneFranche-Comté, Centre-Val de Loire, and Normandy (Figure 3). Similar fluctuations
were visible in outgoing traffic (coefficient of variation equal to 8.4% compared to 8.0%
for internal traffic). Île-de-France, Hauts-de-France and Grand Est all experienced
above-average reductions in outgoing mobility, as high as 80% (117k over 585k) for Îlede-France. Corse also exhibited a reduction comparable to Île-de-France, showing a
clear disruption of the long-range connections linking the island to mainland France.
Similar reductions were obtained with incoming fluxes in the regions (not shown).
The impact of nationwide lockdown in the reduction of outgoing mobility per region was
strongly associated with the fraction of the population in the most active age range (2459 years old)17 (Pearson r = 0.91, p < 0.01) and the fraction of workers employed in
sectors that substantially modified their organization during lockdown, due to telework,
partial or full closure of activities (Pearson r = 0.80, p < 0.01) (Table S1 and Figure 4).
It was moderately associated with regional economic disparities, in terms of a positive
correlation with the 9th decile of the standard of living of the region (Pearson r = 0.63, p
= 0.02).
Regional drops in mobility in a given week (April 6-12, 2020) were strongly associated
with COVID-19 hospitalization rates registered and communicated in the week before
(April 5) (Pearson r = 0.73, p < 0.01; Figure 4). Analogously, they were strongly
correlated to COVID-19-related deaths (Pearson r = 0.63, p = 0.02). Also,
hospitalizations and deaths were highly correlated between each other (Pearson r =
0.97, p < 0.01).
Similar results were obtained for drops in mobility within the region, except for the
association with the hospitalization rate per region, which however showed a similar,
though non-significant, tendency (Table S1 and Fig. S1 in Appendix S4). Taking out
the data point of Île-de-France as the region mostly affected by a departure of
inhabitants for relocation in other regions led to similar results (Table S2 in Appendix
S4). Appendix S4 also reports a multivariate analysis that includes the behavioral,
demographic and socioeconomic factors considered.

Disruption of mobility connections. We found that some connections completely
disappeared, as individuals stopped going from one location to another (Figure 5).
Connection persistence probability (Fig. 5b) decreased steadily during the transition
period (67%, 397k over 596k, of connections surviving in the week of school closure
and non-essential activity closure announcements, March 9 to 15; 50% in the week of
announcement and implementation of lockdown, March 16 to 22). It then stabilized in
the first full week of lockdown (34%, 205k over 596k, of connections surviving, March
23) and beyond. Long connections were less resilient than average, as only 1/4 (129k
over 497k) of them survived lockdown.
After lockdown effects stabilized, connections characterized by small traffic prior to
restrictions (weak connections) were the most likely to disappear, with 70% of them
(417k connections) corresponding to 100 trips per week (Fig. 5c). The traffic lost on
these connections however barely contributed to total traffic reduction (3% contribution,
or 7.2M weekly trips). Restricting the analysis to long mobility connections, the fraction
of the weak connections disappearing slightly increased (from 70% to 89%, 442k
connections), however with a reduction of 47% (5.7M weekly trips) of the traffic.
The disruption in connections occurred with a certain delay compared to reductions in
traffic. For example, on Monday March 16 – the day before lockdown – traffic was
reduced by 30% with respect to the previous Monday (51M to 36M trips), but the
number of connections went down by 4% only (219k to 210k). One week after, traffic
drop was 64% (18M trips) and the drop in the number of connections was 55% (94k).
Mobility connections of 10 most populated French cities.
Restrictions on mobility during lockdown had an uneven impact on the 10 most
populated French cities. The circle containing 95% of outgoing traffic from each city
decreased after lockdown took effect for all cities, indicating that long-range mobility
was disrupted more than short-range one (Figure 6). But reductions varied from more
than 80% (Paris, from 201km to 29km) to 60% (Strasbourg, from 95km to 37km, and
Lille, from 78km to 31km), mainly due to different patterns of commuting and
connectivity characterizing the mobility of each city.
Connections among main cities disappeared too. During lockdown, we no longer
detected mobility from Bordeaux, Montpellier, and Nantes to Lyon, or from Montpellier
to Strasbourg (Figure 6).

DISCUSSION
Using travel flow data extracted from mobile phone trajectories, we documented a large
drop in both short-range and long-range population mobility following lockdown
enforcement in France. Overall, trips were reduced by 65%, similarly to reductions
found in Belgium7, Spain12, and Italy10 during lockdown, albeit different data sources,
spatial resolutions, and definitions of mobility proxies prevent direct numerical
comparisons.
The transition signaling the drop in mobility lasted almost a week, anticipating the
enforcement of lockdown and creating opposite mobility behaviors. Individuals started
spontaneously reducing their mobility on Saturday following the announcement of
school closure (March 14), likely because of fear of the growing epidemic and
heightened risk aversion21,22 generated by the first governmental decision on nationwide
interventions. At the same time, fear of an imminent change in policy imposing stricter
restrictions – as already implemented in Italy, Spain, Austria - pushed individuals to
relocate themselves even to farther away regions where to spend the period of
lockdown, if put in place. The exodus, largely covered by the press 20, started before the
announcement of lockdown and led to anomalous increases in mobility flows out of
certain regions (e.g. Île-de-France) and incoming in others (e.g. Normandy). Such
behavior was similarly reported in China (out of Wuhan), in Italy (North-to-South), and in
India9. It demonstrates that the timing at which a policy is announced might disrupt
social dynamics as much as the direct effect of the policy, at least in the short term.
Increased caution should therefore be considered in the period from announcements to
enforcement to avoid unwanted seeding events. These events were not observed in the
receiving regions, as lockdown strongly suppressed epidemic activity everywhere.
Notwithstanding, they may become important when phasing out restrictions, as less
strict social distancing measures may prevent such suppression. Region-specific
interventions may increase this risk by inducing similar behavioral responses. New York
State reported for instance increased mobility in counties with no imposed lockdown15
.In this perspective, nationwide interventions and restrictions limiting displacements
were adopted by several countries to prevent compensation effects and reduce the
possible geographical spread of the epidemic.
Once lockdown entered into effect, population mobility reductions were heterogeneous
across regions. Larger reductions were measured in regions more severely hit by the
epidemic, with an estimated 1% decrease in regional mobility every 10 additional
hospitalizations (per 100,000 inhabitants). A similar association, but with confirmed
cases, was observed in Germany 8.This suggests that individuals witnessing a larger
COVID-19 burden on the hospital system in their region may have further limited
displacements compared to those living in less affected regions. Media largely
communicated on the epidemic, also providing early on region-specific information on
hospitalizations and mounting pressure on the healthcare system. Exposure to this
information likely triggered a behavioral response to reduced exposure to the perceived
risk, thus increasing compliance to movement restrictions22. A similar, though stronger,
behavior was observed during a 3-day national lockdown enforced nationwide in Sierra
Leone in March 2015 in an effort to control Ebola epidemic5. The correlation remains
significant even taking out the region of Île-de-France, which experienced a reduction in
population due to relocation of individuals. Adjusting for the effect of demography and
socioeconomic factors did not qualitatively change the associations found. We also
tested COVID-19-related deaths as a proxy for perceived disease severity, and found a

similar behavior, explained by the extremely high correlation between hospitalizations
and deaths.
Clearly, other factors may have come into play to differentiate drops in regional mobility.
Lockdown restrictions had a severe impact on jobs and the organization of work.
Regions with the higher proportion of activity sectors mostly impacted by the lockdown
(due to telework, but also to complete or partial closure of sectors, such as tourism,
entertainment, food services, and construction) also experienced larger drops on
mobility. A smaller fraction of active individuals continued to go to work, while the others
limited their displacements respecting lockdown mobility restrictions. Indeed, regions
with larger portions of the population in the most active age range (24-59y) were also
the ones where lockdown had the largest effects. Adjusting for behavioral effects did not
change the results.
Uneven mobility drops were also associated with socioeconomic disparities, similarly to
what found in Italy23. Increasing evidence points at different socioeconomic strata
getting uneven shares of the COVID-19 burden24. Higher income jobs can often be
performed remotely, in confinement, whereas lower income jobs cannot. A survey in
France reported that 39% of low income workers were still going to their workplace
during lockdown, against only 17% of high income workers25. Also, wealthier population
strata weather short-term financial losses better, making them more prone to stop
working and stay at home if they are afraid or sick24. Adjusting for disease perception
and demography reversed this association. This is likely due to complex interactions
between behavioral response, demography, and economic development. The limited
available dataset however does not allow disentangling these effects and infer causal
relationships (see Appendix S4).
A strong response was documented in the older age class: as seniors are at highest risk
of developing severe forms of COVID-19 if infected, they might also have exhibited
increased risk aversion. Specifically, they almost stopped taking trips longer than 100
km, likely to avoid leisure activities and family trips, as recommended by authorities.
The most effective reduction in overall mobility occurred during rush hours, associated
with a disruption of commuting patterns. This reduction alone likely boosted the role of
mobility restrictions in suppressing viral diffusion, as mounting evidence shows that
public transportation is a main risk factor for transmission26.
Lockdown caused larger disruptions on long-range mobility, as also reported in
Belgium7 and Italy10. Short-range and long-range mobility flows play different roles in the
spread of an infectious disease epidemic. Short-range connections are mainly
responsible for local diffusion in the community within and around a metropolitan area,
whereas long-range connections drive the spatial spread of the epidemic, acting as
seeding events to otherwise unaffected or weakly affected areas27. Mobility flows out of
the city of Wuhan were shown to have seeded other prefectures in China in the early
phase of the epidemic before travel restrictions and substantial control measures were
implemented28 . Long-range mobility restrictions therefore contribute to geographically
containing the epidemic, especially when epidemic activity shows the patchy
geographical pattern observed in many affected countries, including France. Banning
trips above 100 km thus helps breaking the spreading pathways, as observed during the
lockdown. Nonetheless, we documented that some long-range connections, survived
even during lockdown. These movements should be carefully accompanied by strict
preventive measures to avoid re-seeding events.

The largest reduction of mobility across distance was reported for Paris. Before
lockdown, 95% of outgoing traffic reached destinations within 200 km from the city
center, approximately the distance between Paris and Lille, close to the Belgian border.
After lockdown, this radius reduced to 29 km, the distance from the city center to
Disneyland Paris. Mobility focused around metropolitan areas, serving the needs of
individuals in essential professional categories, who continued their work-related
displacements. A similar geographical fragmentation was observed in Italy29 .
Our analysis offered plausible interpretations on how the labor market, demographic
and socio-economic indicators, and awareness of increased epidemic risk might have
shaped the reduction in mobility, confirming evidence observed in previous5 and
current25,30 outbreaks. Our findings might extend to countries in Europe that qualitatively
shared France’s epidemic wave and interventions8–13.
Our study has limitations. Despite the widespread use of mobile phone data to quantify
mobility4, potential sources of inaccuracy traditionally exist: population
representativeness, geographic coverage, and heterogeneity in user activity. We used
passively-collected signaling data, that improve temporal accuracy and do not depend
on activity behavior, compared to traditional call details records. Data owner preprocessed the data to be representative of the general population. Large population
displacements may also bias regional activity measures. However, the associations we
found were robust after removing Île-de-France, the region mostly affected by the prelockdown exodus. Our study is observational, therefore caution is needed in drawing
causal relations between the covariates and changes in mobility. Also, the available
sample was too small to statistically measure confounding effects rigorously.
Mobility restrictions had the goal of relieving the strain on the healthcare system caused
by rapidly increasing hospitalization rates. The effectiveness of these top-down
measures was unknown beforehand. Our study showed that different effects were
observed across scales, with larger disruptions on long-range connections leading to a
localization of the mobility. By associating heterogeneous performances of travel
restrictions to both a priori population features (socioeconomic, demographic), and
behavioral adaptations to the epidemic and to restrictions themselves, our findings
contribute to informing the ongoing epidemic response. Quantitatively characterizing
how lockdown reshaped mobility might help design future restrictions that are less
pervasive, more targeted.

FIGURES

Figure 1. The phases of the COVID-19 epidemic in France, and its impact on
mobility patterns.
a) Colored areas correspond to the different phases of the
epidemic response. Red lines mark main government interventions. Red horizontal thick
lines indicate school holidays (students staying home from school) in the four
government-defined geographic areas of France (Paris is in zone C). Dashed vertical
lines indicate announcements made by French authorities. March 12: announcement of
school closure to be implemented starting March 16; March 14: announcement of
closure of nonessential businesses with immediate effect; March 16: announcement of
lockdown to be implemented the day after at noon. The black solid vertical line on
March 17, 2020 indicates the beginning of lockdown. The black dots track the temporal
change of the total number of daily trips measured from mobile phone data in France
from January 6 to April 12. The top timeline considers all trips, the bottom timeline only
long trips (>100 km). Each timeline is fitted (orange – all trips, green – long trips), with
the training set going from January 6 to March 9, and extrapolation up to April 12. A
solid horizontal black line above the plots indicates the span of the training set. Shaded

areas represent 95% confidence intervals. b) Maps show the variation in traffic
compared with the unperturbed baseline predicted by the fit. Top row: outgoing traffic;
bottom row: incoming traffic. The chosen dates are March 13, March 16 (day before
lockdown), March 18 (day after lockdown enforcement). Ile-de-France is highlighted in
the zoomed panel (the region is indicated by its contour in the map of France).

Figure 2. Mobility reduction during lockdown across user type, age and time of
day. Reduction is computed as the average over the week starting Monday April 6, with
respect to the average over the first week of February (starting Monday February 3). a),
b) and c) show the relative reduction broken down by residents/foreigners, age classes,
and times of the day. They also show statistics for all trips (orange) and long trips
(green), defined as trips with geodesic distance longer than 100 km. Horizontal orange
and green lines indicate relative reduction on all residents (all, long, respectively).

Figure 4. Reduction in outgoing mobility for the week April 6-12, 2020 vs.
epidemic, socio-economic, and demographic indicators. Correlation is evaluated
between variations in the outgoing traffic and the four considered indicators: a) the
population in active age (24-59 years old), b) the fraction of employees in the sectors
mostly affected by lockdown. c) the 90th percentile of the regional standard of living17, d)
the cumulated number of COVID-19 hospitalizations per 100,000 inhabitants on April
05, 2020. Pearson correlation coefficients and their p-values are reported.

Figure 5. Network analysis. a) Number of mobility connections between French
locations over time. b) Link persistence probability: probability that a connection present
during week February 3-9 is still present in one of the four selected weeks: before
lockdown (March 9-15), during enforcement (March 16-22), during lockdown (March 2329, March 30 – April 5). c) Persistence probability and traffic reduction in relation with
traffic. For a given x-axis value (traffic on link), solid lines measure the fraction of broken
links which used to have at most that weight in the baseline week. Dashed lines report
the fraction of missing traffic that was lost on connections which used to have at most a
certain weight in the baseline week. For all panels: orange: all links, green long links
(longer than 100 km).
