Predicting the Peak and COVID-19 trend in six high incidence
countries: A study based on Modified SEIRD model

Abstract
The novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) has claimed the lives of almost a million people across
the globe and this trend continues to rise rapidly day by day. The fear of getting infected by
Corona virus is affecting the people emotionally, psychologically and mentally. They are not
able to work to their full capacity and are also worried about the well beings of their near and
dear ones. The National governments have taken up several measures like lockdowns, closing
of educational institutions, and work from home for employees of companies wherever
feasible. Governments are also advising people to take precautions like not to go out if not
necessary, use of mask and keep a distance of appx. 6 ft. if you need to go out as the virus
spreads from human to human in close proximity. These measures have helped to limit the
spread of this virus in the past few months. However, due to rapid increase in the daily
confirmed cases, it is becoming tougher for the governments to provide facilities like testing
kits, hospitalization facilities, oxygen cylinders etc. to the infected persons. Thus, there is an
urgent need to accurately estimate the number of cases in coming future that can help
governments in acquiring the required resources. Further, to handle the economic distress
caused by this virus, long-term planning is equally important. Focusing on these two aspects,
this paper proposes to use the Modified SEIRD (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-RecoveredDeceased) model to predict the peak and spread trend of COVID-19 in six countries namely
USA, India, Brazil, Russia, Peru and Colombia having the highest number of confirmed
cases. As in COVID-19, even infected asymptomatic persons can spread the infection, the
chosen model is well suited as exposed compartment of SEIRD model includes asymptomatic
exposed individuals which are infectious. Epidemiological data till 9th September 2020 has
been utilised to perform short-term predictions till 31st December 2020. Long-term
predictions have been computed till 31st December 2023, to estimate the end of the virus in
the above-mentioned six nations. Small values of MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)
have been obtained for the models fitted to reported data for all the countries. Student t-test
has been used for accepting the predictions of the Modified SEIRD model based on the
reported data.

1. Introduction
In the second last month of year 2019, a novel coronavirus appeared in the Wuhan city of
China (Ma, 2020). From there, it has spread to almost the entire world in a short span of time.
It started as a deadly disease, then turned into an epidemic, and later it was declared as a
pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11th March 2020 (World Health
Organization, 2020). The novel coronavirus, also known as Corona Virus Disease 2019
(COVID-19), has affected 215 countries with more than 28 million cases and 0.91 million
deaths worldwide as on 9th September 2020. The exponential spread of the virus has

uniformly affected the healthcare system of different countries. This can be verified by the
fact that the list of worst-affected countries by COVID-19 includes both developed and
developing nations.
COVID-19 infection is a respiratory disease that mainly affects the lungs of a patient.
Although this infection impacts everyone equally, patients with existing respiratory diseases
become easy targets of this infection. Moreover, people with comorbidities also remain at
high risk due to their weak immunity. Towards the beginning of this pandemic, it was
thought that only elderly population is vulnerable to this virus. However, as time passed,
many new cases were reported among children and adults as well. As on 9th September 2020,
USA, India, Brazil, Russia and Peru are the six nations that have seen the maximum number
of cases. USA, India, Brazil and Russia have more than 6.5, 4.5, 4.2 and 1 million cases
respectively, while the count for Peru remains less than a million. Though India ranks second
in the number of cases, it has the least number of total cases per million (3391 cases/million),
out of the six worst-affected countries. On the other hand, Peru has the maximum number of
total cases per million (21677 cases/million). A similar trend is observed for total number of
deaths per million with Peru having the highest value (922 deaths per million), while India
accounting for only 56 deaths per million among the above-mentioned six nations. However,
India’s statistics can be a result of the minimum number of tests per million (39915
tests/million) that are being performed in the country.
The COVID-19 infection spreads by directly coming in contact with infected water droplets
from an infected individual when he/she coughs or sneezes. Another source of infection is
touching any surface that contains infection. To minimize the spread of infection from an
infected person, national governments across the world have urged their citizens to maintain
social distancing, wear face masks and wash their hands regularly with soap or use alcoholbased sanitizers. Furthermore, some countries also implemented restrictions in the form of
lockdowns where people were confined to their homes for several days. During this time,
companies allowed its employees to work from home, educational institutions provided
online classes, transportation was limited and people were instructed to follow personal
hygiene norms in their daily activities.
Apart from necessary precautions, planning for future is another means of efficiently
handling the situation. This requires accurate predictions for the growth trend of the infection
in near future. These predictions can help policy makers to take timely decisions and plan in
advance to lower the increasing burden on the economy and healthcare sector. In recent
times, a large number of research articles have been published that focus on the ongoing
pandemic. These publications cover a diverse range of topics including the development of
COVID-19 vaccine, impact of COVID-19 on patients with comorbidities, the role of a
person’s demographics in his susceptibility to the deadly disease and predicting the trend of
the pandemic. This paper focuses on the last category and performs short-term and long-term
predictions for six worst affected countries namely USA India, Brazil, Russia, Peru and
Colombia.
This paper performs predictions for the spread of COVID-19 in six worst-affected countries
of the world using Modified SEIRD model. Short-term predictions depict the progress of the
virus till 31st December 2020 and can be utilized by the national governments to take
immediate measure for handling the pandemic. Whereas, long-term predictions show the
pandemic trend for a longer period (in this paper, taken till the end of year 2023) to help the

policy-makers for long-term planning. The epidemiological reported data from 22nd January
2020 till 9th September 2020 has been used for modelling and predictions in this paper.
The remaining paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the literature review; Section
3 explains the Modified SEIRD model that has been used to perform predictions; Section 4
explains the experimental setup, followed by Section 5 which presents the results of the
experimentation. Section 6 concludes the paper.

2. Literature Review
In 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic appeared in China and since then, it has spread to the
whole world (Rahmandad, Lim, & Sterman, 2020). Every community has contributed to fight
this difficult time. Doctors, nurses, cleanliness workers and police department are now
referred to as corona warriors due to their devotion to the needs of the society in these trying
times. The community of researchers has also played an important role. There are two ways
in which researchers have played their part in the fight against COVID-19. First, by
predicting the future trend of the pandemic to help in policy making and second, by working
towards the development of a vaccine for the novel coronavirus. From the beginning of the
pandemic, various researchers have used different modelling techniques to predict the trend
of COVID-19 in different regions of world (Giordano, et al., 2020), (Zhao, et al., 2020),
(Bhatnagar, 2020) and (Sturniolo, Waites, Colbourn, Manheim, & Panovska-Griffiths, 2020).
Some of these works have been discussed in this section.
Anand et al (Anand, Sabarinath, Geetha, & Somanath, 2020) augmented the standard SIR
model by incorporating Quarantine and Testing for the prediction of COVID-19 spread in
India. In their paper, pre-lockdown and post lockdown conditions were accessed. The
parameters of differential equations were calculated for the time period before lockdown and
after lockdown. Optimization method, particularly differential evolution optimizer, were used
to calculate the parameters of SIR model with Quarantine and Testing. Bhatnagar (Bhatnagar,
2020) proposed a simple mathematical model in which the spread of COVID-19 infection
was modelled. The authors observed that as the infection spreads from one person to another,
it effectively creates a Geometric Progression by which the total infected individuals can be
estimated. Some constraints were introduced in the model including recovery rate of 14 days
which further improved their model and gave better results.
Zhou et al (Zhou, et al., 2020) compared three models for short-term prediction as well as
peak prediction for eight most affected countries by COVID-19. The three models namely
Logistic, SEIR, and adjusted SEIR were used by the authors. Logistic model mathematically
shows the dynamic evolution of infected people which is controlled by the growth rate and
population capacity. The difference between SEIR and adjusted SEIR is that first one is
implemented considering no intervention whereas the second one includes control measures
and intervention. For fitting, 10 days of data was used and 7 days prediction was performed.
Taboe et al (Taboe, Salako, Tison, Ngonghala, & Kakaï, 2020) proposed a mathematical
model to predict the course of COVID-19 in West Africa. The paper focused on the control
measures for the containment of infection spread due to COVID-19. To analyse the effect of
control measures such as social distancing, face mask, contact tracing and mass testing, SEIR
model was used. Based on the West-Africa data project, baseline parameters for the
mathematical model were calculated. The worst-case scenario was depicted when there were

no control measures taken by the government. Whereas following the current health
measures, it was deduced that the reduction of 67% in daily cases will be seen at the time of
peak in West Africa. And with improved control measures it will further reduce the daily
cases 76% to 87%.
Chakraborty et al (Chakraborty & Ghosh, 2020) utilised Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving
Average (ARIMA) model and Wavelet model to propose a hybrid model. The authors used
their proposed model to predict the trend of COVID-19 for five countries namely Canada,
France, India, South Korea and United Kingdom. The hybrid model was used to compute
short-term predictions for ten days into future. Similarly, Ceylan (Ceylan, 2020) also made
use of the ARIMA models for projecting the spread of the pandemic in Europe’s worstaffected countries. Different ARIMA models were constructed by the author based on
different parameter values. Using the best model, predictions were performed for France,
Italy and Spain.
Roosa et al (Roosa, et al., 2020) performed short-term predictions of COVID-19 for two
Chinese provinces namely Guangdong and Zhejiang. In their paper, the authors computed the
total confirmed cases using three models viz. Logistic growth model, Richards growth model
and a Sub-epidemic wave model. They adopted a bootstrap approach to calculate the
uncertainty bounds for the projection of cumulative number of cases. Ahmed (Ahmed, 2020)
studied the effect of patient age, gender and geographical location on the pandemic spread. In
his work, the Indian population was divided into six groups to study the regional effect of
COVID-19 on a patient. Clustering was used by the author to find the similarity between
different groups, while Multiple Linear Regression was used to predict the infection source.
For each group, different age distributions were studied and their recovery rates were
calculated.
Patrikar et al (Patrikar, Poojary, Basannar, & Kunte, 2020) modified the SEIR model in their
work to predict the trend of COVID-19 for India. In their model, the authors analysed the
effect of social distancing on the pandemic and obtained different graphs for the same.
According to the model given by Poonia et al (Poonia & Azad, 2020), it was concluded that
social distancing has been effective in controlling the virus spread in India. In their paper,
authors performed short-term predictions of COVID-19 for different states of India in worst
case scenario. Pandey et al (Pandey, Chaudhary, Gupta, & Pal, 2020) also studied the trend of
this disease in India during the initial days of the outbreak. Short-term predictions for twoweeks were performed by the authors using the SEIR model. In their paper, the effect of
interventions was also studied on the progress of the infection within the country. Moreover,
the authors used the Regression model to predict the number of confirmed and deceased cases
in India.
This paper utilises a compartmental epidemiological model, named Modified SEIRD
(Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered-Deceased) model for projecting the spread of
COVID-19 in six countries having the highest number of total cases. Short-term predictions
till 31st December 2020 have been computed using the Modified SEIRD model. Further,
long-term predictions have also been performed for the six countries having the highest
number of total infected cases as on 9th September 2020. The next section presents the
Modified SEIRD model that has been used for predictions.

3. The Modified SEIRD model used for prediction
The SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered) model is a compartmental model that
divides the population into four mutually exclusive compartments. These compartments are
named as Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Infected (I), and Recovered (R). The SEIR model
captures the dynamic nature of a pandemic. As the infection progresses, parts of population
shift from one compartment to the other (Brauer, Driessche, & Wu, 2008). In the SEIR
model, S(t) represents the individuals who have not been infected by the disease on day t, but
they are vulnerable to the infection. E(t) represents the individuals who have been exposed to
the disease on day t, by coming in contact with an infected person. However, these people are
considered asymptomatic as they have not shown any signs of the disease yet. I(t) represents
the individuals who have been infected by the disease on day t. Such people act as carriers of
infection and can transmit it further. R(t) represents the individuals who have recovered from
the infection or succumbed to it on day t. Some authors refer this compartment as the
Removed compartment.
In the SEIR model, the transmission rate β regulates the spread of the infection. It signifies
the rate at which susceptible people become infected by the disease. 𝛼 is the onset rate with
1/𝛼 represents the average latent period of the infection; while 1/𝛾 represents the average
infectious period. The SEIR model considers few assumptions. It is assumed that apart from
the deceased patients, there is no entry or departure from the population. Moreover, recovered
individuals are assumed to gain immunity and hence, they cannot spread the infection further.
It is also assumed that the number of new infection cases are directly proportional to the
infected and exposed population.
The SEIR model consists of a single compartment for both recovered and deceased
individuals. This model was enhanced to include a separate compartment for the casualties
caused by the disease. The resulting model is known as the SEIRD model where D(t) denotes
the individuals who have been deceased due to the pandemic on day t. Infected people
become Deceased with a rate 𝜇.
The SEIRD model assumes that exposed population is non-infectious, whereas it has been
seen in COVID-19 cases that asymptomatic individuals are tested positive and are also
responsible for spreading the disease. Therefore, the SEIRD model was modified by
incorporating asymptomatic individuals in the exposed compartment. This paper utilises the
Modified SEIRD model to include asymptomatic cases in exposed population and the same
has been shown in Figure 1 below:

Figure 1: Modified SEIRD model
The Modified SEIRD model has been derived from the SEIRD model. It uses parameter ‘ε’
which represents the Exposed population that is asymptomatic but infectious, and hence

infecting others. The μ parameter denotes the rate at which infected people become deceased.

To analyse the pandemic spread, this work utilises the basic reproduction number, Ʀ0. Ʀ0 is
the average number of secondary infections generated by an infected person and is defined by
equation (6):
β

β

Ʀ0 = ((γ+μ)) + ɛ ∗ (α)

(6)

Based on Ʀ0, another parameter named Effective Reproduction number, Ʀe, is defined. Ʀe is
the average number of new infections generated by an infectious individual on day, t, and is
calculated by equation (7):
Ʀe=Ʀ0*

S(t)

N(t)
β

Equations (6) and equation (7) clearly depict the increase by a factor ɛ ∗ (α) in the value of
Ʀ0 and the corresponding increase in Ʀe by the exposed population. Hence the parameter ɛ,
representing the proportion of infectious exposed population, contributes to the growth of
COVID-19. High value of this parameter indicates that there are more infectious exposed
individuals and contact tracing should be done, so that these individuals can be isolated to
reduce the spread of the disease.

4. Experimental Setup
In this paper, experiments were performed in Python using Jupyter Notebook. The time-series
data of COVID-19 provided by John Hopkins University, was used for experimentation in
this paper (Dong, Du, & Gardner, 2020). For the six worst-affected countries, the data of
Total Confirmed cases, Total Recovered cases and Total Deceased cases was available since
22nd January 2020. The values of Daily Confirmed cases, Daily Recovered cases and Daily
Deceased cases were calculated by subtracting the data values of two consecutive days.
Active Infected cases were calculated by subtracting both Total Recovered cases and Total
Deceased cases from Total Confirmed cases. The data was pre-processed to remove negative
values. Also, the data for each day was replaced with the average of the current data and the
data of last four days. This was done to handle untimely reporting of data.

The Modified SEIRD model was used for experimentation, as described in Section 3. The
model parameters β, ε, α, γ and μ were optimized by fitting the curve to the reported data.
The curve fiiting was performed using the functions provided by Python’s lmfit library. For
optimization of the above-mentioned parameters, minimize function was used with the least
square method. The initial value of Active Infected, I0, was taken as 1 assuming the spread
started from a single person. The initial values for exposed E0, recovered R0, and deceased
D0 were taken as 0. Further, the initial value for Suscpectible S0 was computed using
equation (8):
S0 = N-E0-I0-R0-D0

(8)

where, N is total population of the place in consideration.
Fitting of data with single set of paramters (β, ε, α, γ and μ) is not appropriate for performing
predictions as the reported data is dynamic in nature. Therefore, the curve was fitted to data
by computing the optimized parameters (β, ε, α, γ and μ) on a weekly basis which were used
for further predictions. To obtain the optimized parameters, the initial values and the bounds
for the parameters were given as inputs to the minimize function of lmfit library. For
parameter β, initial value was taken as 0.5 with bounds [0.001,1]. For ε, 0.1 was used as the
initial value with [0.0001,1] as bounds; 1/5 was the initial value for α and [1/6,1] were the
bounds. For parameter γ, the initial value was 1/10 with bounds were chosen to be [1/150, 1];
and for μ, 0.01 and [0.0001,1] was the initial value and its bounds respectively. The results
obtained from the Modified SEIRD model have been presented in the next section.

5. Results
This section presents the predictions obtained using Modified SEIRD model. The results for
both short-term and long-term predictions are discussed in the next subsections.

5.1. Results for Short-Term Predictions
The short-term predictions for the six worst-affected nations, were performed till 31st
December 2020. This includes the predictions for seven time-series data namely, Daily
Confirmed cases, Daily Recovered cases, Daily Deceased cases, Total Confirmed cases,
Total Recovered cases, Total Deceased cases and Active Infected cases. To analyse the
results obtained by the model, Case Fatality Rate (CFR), Recovery Rate (RR) and Mean
Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) values have been calculated using equations (9), (10) and
(11) respectively.

It can be observed from Table 1 that the predicted values of CFR and RR are significantly
similar to the corresponding values for reported data on 9th September 2020. It was found that
USA has the lowest RR of 37.53 on 9th September 2020, with CFR value as 3.0003.
However, by the end of year 2020, it is predicted that this value will increase to 48.64 and its
CFR value will decrease to 2.61 as shown in Table 2. On the other hand, Peru has the highest
CFR of 4.33, while its RR stands at 77.13. According to the Modified SEIRD model, Peru
will achieve the second highest RR of 92.84 by the end of year 2020, among the six countries
in consideration. At the same time, Russia will witness a 5% increase in RR and a 0.13%
decrease in the value of CFR. Next, Figure 2 (a-f) depict the short-term predictions of Daily
Confirmed cases for USA, India, Brazil, Russia, Peru and Colombia respectively.

Figure 2 (a-f): Reported and Predicted Daily Confirmed cases for six worst-affected countries

As shown in Figure 2 (a), USA will have 65,648 Daily Confirmed cases by the end of year
2020. In India, this number will rise to 5,60,016 at the same time. Though India currently
ranks second in the worst-affected nations by COVID-19, but the number of Daily cases in
this country are much higher than USA which is the worst-affected nation of the world. In
case of Brazil, Peru and Columbia, the number of Daily Confirmed cases will be 15,434;
2,729 and 922 respectively on 31st December 2020. The predicted values of Daily Confirmed
cases fit closely with the reported data as shown in Figure 2 (a-f). This is also verified using
the MAPE values calculated between the reported data and the predicted data. The MAPE
values computed for Daily Confirmed cases of USA, India, Brazil, Russia, Peru and
Colombia are 0.19, 0.22, 0.30, 0.13, 0.26 and 0.17 respectively. Figure 3 (a-f) presents the
reported and predicted values for Daily Recovered cases of USA, India, Brazil, Russia, Peru
and Colombia respectively.

Figure 3 (a-f): Reported and Predicted Daily Recovered cases for six worst-affected countries

The Modified SEIRD model predicts that by the end of year 2020, USA will have 40,014
Daily Recovered cases, whereas India, Brazil, Russia, Peru and Colombia will have 4,66,363;
16,679; 4,796; 3,152 and 1,179 Daily Recovered cases repectively. Among all the six
countries in consideration, India has the highest number of Daily Recovered cases. The
MAPE values obtained for Daily Recovered cases in case of USA, India, Brazil, Russia, Peru
and Colombia are as follows: 1.22, 0.28, 0.44, 0.30, 0.81 and 2.71. For four out of six worstaffected nations, the MAPE values lie below 1, which indicates that the predictions are in
close correspondence with the reported data. Figure 4 (a-f) shows the Daily Deceased cases
for the six countries that have been worst affected by COVID-19.

Figure 4 (a-f): Reported and Predicted Daily Deceased cases for six worst-affected countries

The severity of any pandemic can be judged by the number of deaths caused by it. The
COVID-19 pandemic has shown different CFR values in different countries. The predictions
obtained from the Modified SEIRD model depict that USA will witness 1,456 deaths daily by
the end of year 2020. Though the CFR value for India is very low, but the number of Daily
Deceased cases in India will be 7,077 on 31st December 2020. This can be attributed to the
high rate of infection spread in this country. In contrast, Brazil, Russia, Peru and Colombia
will have comparatively few Daily deaths caused by the infection. MAPE values calculated
for Daily Deceased cases were found to be below 0.4 in all the cases. Figure 5 (a-f) show the
Total Confirmed cases for worst affected six countries.

Figure 5 (a-f): Reported and Predicted Total Confirmed cases for six worst-affected countries

The Modified SEIRD model predicts 1,23,37,873 Total Confirmed cases in USA as on 31st
December 2020. For India and Brazil, this number is expected to be 3,39,94,949 and
69,47,629 respectively. On the other hand, Russia will have 15,76,715 Total Confirmed cases
while Peru will have 12,37,160 cases around the same time. In Colombia, the estimated
number of Total Confirmed cases are 10,17,620. From these values, it can be concluded that
by the end of 2020, India will have the highest number of Total Confirmed cases and will
replace USA as the worst affected nation by COVID-19 pandemic. The MAPE values
corresponding to Total Confirmed data, for all the six countries in consideration are 0.12,
0.16, 0.09, 0.24, 0.09 and 0.09 respectively. Next, Figure 6 (a-f) present the graphs of Total
Recovered Cases for USA, India, Brazil, Russia, Peru and Colombia.

Figure 6 (a-f): Reported and Predicted Total Recovered cases for six worst-affected countries

The Total Recovered cases for USA, India, Brazil, Russia, Peru and Colombia at the year
end, will be 60,00,719; 2,78,23,877; 65,56,224; 13,84,586; 11,48,564 and 9,67,426. The
MAPE values for Total Recovered cases in USA, India, Brazil, Russia, Peru and Colombia
are 0.18, 0.14, 0.62, 0.15, 0.23 and 0.10 respectively. The low MAPE values indicate that the
prediction made by the Modified SEIRD model closely correspond with the reported data
with low error values for all the six nations in consideration. Figure 7 (a-f) represents the
graphs for six worst-affected countries with Total Deceased time-series.

Figure 7 (a-f): Reported and Predicted Total Deceased cases for six worst-affected countries

According to the Modified SEIRD model, USA and India will face 3,22,451 and 4,44,568
Total Deceased cases. Brazil, Russia, Peru and Colombia will have 1,87,855; 25,246; 39,650
and 34,522 Total Deceased cases at end of year 2020. The MAPE values corresponding to the
same are: 0.09, 0.09, 0.08, 0.07, 0.07 and 0.07. Since the MAPE values for all the six worstaffected nations lie below 0.1, it can be safely concluded that the predictions made by the
Modified SEIRD model are significantly similar to the reported data for Total Deceased

2,03,550; 1,66,882; 48,946 and 15,672 Active Infected cases repectively. The MAPE values
of Active Infected cases for USA, India, Brazil, Russia, Peru and Colombia are as follows:

0.11, 0.11, 0.12, 0.12, 0.08 and 0.09. For all the six worst-affected nations, the MAPE values
lie below 0.2, which indicates that the predictions are in close correspondence with the
reported data.
Further, statistical hypothesis testing using Student t-test was used for accepting the shortterm predictions performed by the Modified SEIRD model. The reported and predicted
values of Total Confirmed cases, Total Recovered cases, Total Deceased cases and Active
Infected cases for USA, India, Brazil, Russia, Peru and Columbia have been used for
performing t-test. The t-test was not performed for Daily cases due to fluctuations in daily
data as the cases may not be reported timely. The t-test is used to perform a hypothesis test of
the null hypothesis that the actual and predicted data are similar for short-term predictions. In
this paper, paired t-test using two samples for means assuming unequal variance has been
used. The null hypothesis and the alternate hypothesis are defined as follows:
𝐻0 : 𝜇1 − 𝜇2 ≠ 0

(19)

𝐻1 : 𝜇1 − 𝜇2 = 0

(20)

where, 𝜇1 is the mean of the reported data and 𝜇2 is the mean our model in consideration.
T-test is used to estimate whether the observed data belongs to the null hypothesis or not. If
the observed test statistic differs significantly from the hypothesized values, then null
hypothesis is rejected and we claim the desired performance of the proposed algorithm by
accepting the alternate hypothesis. For the experimentation, significance level as 0.01 was
selected. In statistical hypothesis testing using t-test, probability p is calculated. If the value
of p is less than 0.01, then the null hypothesis is rejected and alternate hypothesis is accepted
with 99% confidence. Otherwise, null hypothesis is rejected and alternate hypothesis is
accepted.
For Total Confirmed cases, the p-values obtained for six worst affected countries of world
including USA, India, Brazil, Russia, Peru and Colombia were less than 0.01. In case of Total
Recovered predictions, all the p-values were below 0.01 significance level. Similarly, the pvalue of Total Deceased and Active Infected cases are also less than 0.01. Therefore, in all
these cases, the null hypothesis is rejected and the alternate hypothesis is accepted with 99%
confidence. The above-mentioned results show that the predictions of the Modified SEIRD
model closely correspond with the reported data. Hence, the Modified SEIRD model is
further used to perform long-term predictions of COVID-19 in six countries in consideration.
The results for the same are presented in the next section.

5.2. Results for Long Term Prediction
The long-term predictions were performed till the end of year 2023 for the six worst-affected
nations being considered in this paper. The predictions for different time-series data obtained
from the Modified SEIRD model have been discussed below. The Effective Reproduction
Number, Re, has also been calculated and analysed. For calculating Re, the starting date has
been selected as 1st April 2020 as by this time, the number of reported cases in all the six
countries in consideration surpassed 1000 infected cases (Linka, Peirlinck, & Kuhl, 2020).
This has been shown in Figure 9 (a-c) - Figure 14 (a-c).

United States of America (USA): In USA, first case of COVID-19 was encountered in
January and as on 9th September 2020, this number increased to 6,361,265 (Worldometer,
2020). In the initial phase, the US government downplayed the severity of virus and did not
take necessary precautions to control the spread. Therefore, the value of β which represents
the transmission rate per capita, reached 0.37 at the beginning of March and by mid-March, it
reached 0.49. At the same time, the value of ε was 0.99, which reflects that the infectious
exposed portion of population is very high in USA. Therefore, a national emergency was
declared in USA in March itself (Liptak, 2020). The authorities started purchasing medical
equipments in bulk, stay at home orders were released and schools were closed. In April, the
guidelines were updated and a new division named as Coronavirus Commission for Safety
and Quality in Nursing Homes was setup (Whitehouse.gov, 2020). In the same month, USA
achieved the highest CFR by crossing Italy, as the value of mu increased from 0.0053 to
0.0059. In June, a second wave of infection was seen when the relaxations were given in
some states and again the value of β increased from 0.01 to 0.03. On 1st April 2020, the Re
value of USA was estimated to be 8.18 which has reduced to 1.61 as on 9th September 2020.
According to the Modified SEIRD model, USA will see its peak in July 2022. The Daily
Confirmed cases at the time of peak will be 2,29,457 and Total Confirmed cases will be
10,25,02,451. The Total Deceased cases will be 26,74,542 whereas the Total Recovered cases
will be 7,06,24,200. At the same time, the number of Active Infected cases in USA will be
60,14,704. These values can be observed from Figure 9 (a-c).

India: India is a diverse nation with a huge population and high population density. In the
beginning of March, the value of β was found to be very high which was 0.77. The
government of India responded promptly by locking the whole country in the early stages of
the pandemic. This lockdown continued in four stages, starting from 25th March 2020 to 31st
May 2020. After lockdown 1.0, there was a decrease in transmission rate (β) from 0.34 to
0.17. During lockdown 4.0 which happened in May, the value of ε decreased to 0.0001,
therefore the lockdown was lifted by giving relaxations and it was named as Unlock 1.0.
There was an increasing trend observed in the value of ε in Unlock 1.0 period. In India, the
Recovery Rate is very high as compared to other countries and a constant increase is
observed in the value of 𝛾. Also, the low CFR contributes to decreasing mu value in India.
On 1st April 2020, the Re value of India was estimated to be 8.79 which has reduced to 1.24
as on 9th September 2020. The peak of India is expected to be in May 2021 with 21,26,406
cases coming daily. The Total Confirmed cases at peak will be 24,82,39,581 in which 89%
population will be recovered and 0.01% will lose their fight against the infection. At this
time, the number of Active Infected cases in India will be 57,26,504. These values can be
observed from Figure 10 (a-c).

Brazil: Brazil has the third-highest number of Total Confirmed cases. Brazil had its first case
of COVID-19 at the end of February and by the end of March, the infection had spread to
most of the states in Brazil. In the month of March, the value of β increased to 0.888 from
0.001. The government of Brazil restricted air travel to control the spread of the pandemic.
But in mid-April, the value of ε increased to 0.999. The reason for the same may be attributed
to the relaxations in the social distancing norms given by the newly appointed Health
minister, Nelson Luiz Sperle Teiz (G1, 2020). At the end of April, it was observed that the
CFR increased in Brazil, therefore, the value of μ also increased from 0.006 to 0.013.
According to the predictions obtained from the Modified SEIRD model, Brazil has already
witnessed peak number of infected cases on 23rd July 2020. The number of Active Infected
cases at the time of peak were 2,03,550. On 1st April 2020, the Re value of Brazil was found
to be 9.92 which has reduced to 0.89 as on 9th September 2020. Re value below 1 denotes a
decreasing trend of the pandemic in the country. The end of pandemic is expected by the end
of year 2023. The long-term predictions for Brazil have been shown in Figure 11(a-c).

Russia: The largest country in the world in terms of area, is ranked fourth place with
10,37,526 Total Confirmed cases as on 9th September 2020. In Russia, the first case was
found in February after the evacuation of Russian passengers from a cruise named Diamond
Princess. This cruse was considered to be second largest hotbed of COVID-19 outside China
(TASS, 2020). The value of ε from March to May was consistently high, showing that the
infection has spread to a large section of the population. Recently, the value of 𝛾 has shown a
decreasing trend from 0.36 to 0.28, whereas, the value of mu on 9th September 2020 was
found to be 0.0004. A low value of mu indicates a decline in the number of fatalities caused
by the infection, which is the prime aim of the government in case of any pandemic. On 1st
April 2020, the Re value of Russia was estimated to be 10.29 which has reduced to 1 as on 9th
September 2020. This shows that the pandemic is on the decline in this country. However,
Russia witnessed its infection peak on 7th May 2020 but recently, a second wave of infection
has been observed and the same has been confirmed by an increase in the value of Re. The
pandemic in Russia is expected to be for a large period. The end of pandemic is expected
even after the year 2023. The long-term predictions obtained by the Modified SEIRD model
for Russia have been shown in Figure 12 (a-c).

Peru: On 6th March 2020, the first case of COVD-19 was detected in Peru (Aquin &
Garrison, 2020). After this, the government of Peru had put up several restrictions including
lockdown, quarantine, and use of face masks in public areas. But people did not abide by
these regulations, therefore, the infection spread at a high rate which is also reflected by the
high value of ε. At the same time, Peru had the highest CFR, as shown by the high value of
mu. On 1st April 2020, the Re value of Peru was estimated to be 2.64 which has reduced to
0.84 as on 9th September 2020. The peak of Peru was witnessed on 20th August 2020 and the
number of Active Infected cases at this time will be 48,946. The end of pandemic in Peru will
be towards end of 2023. The long-term predictions for Peru has been shown in Figure 13 (ac).

Colombia: Colombia is the sixth nation that has been most-affected by COVID-19 pandemic.
This country witnessed its peak on 13th August 2020 with 13,907 Daily cases and 15,672
Active Infected cases. On 1st April 2020, the Re value of Colombia was estimated to be 13.83
which has reduced to 0.77 as on 9th September 2020. The value of ε was found to be
consistently high. The reason for the same can be attributed to the relaxations given by the
government with high number of exposed asymptomatic individuals. Colombia observes a
mix of infection transmission rate in the value of beta. The country has a relatively high CFR
which is also shown by the value of mu. The long-term predictions for Colombia has been
shown in Figure 14 (a-c).

Figure 14 (c): Re values for Colombia
The values of parameters (β, ε, α, γ and μ) optimized by the Modified SEIRD model have been

presented in Table 3-7. The optimized values for the β parameter corresponding to the six
nations in consideration, have been shown in Figure 14. For any pandemic, the β parameter
reflects the rate at which susceptible people get infected. High β values correspond to high
transmission rate per capita, indicating a fast spread of the infection. As can be seen from the
table, India shows a high β value as compared to all other countries. In such cases, contact
tracing must be increased and measures like social-distancing and isolation must be
implemented strictly. For Brazil, high β values were obtained by the model till June, but later,
a decline in values was observed. This corresponds to the actual scenario of COVID-19 in
Brazil, as the peak for the infection was achieved around June. On the other hand, Russia
showed high β values in the beginning and few spikes later on, but a downward trend was
observed in the second half of the year 2020. Lastly, Peru and Columbia both show
comparatively slow transmission rates of the COVID-19 infection as compared to their
counterparts.

The ε value of USA is high which shows that the asymptomatic cases who are infectious are
also high. The values of ε for six worst-affected countries is shown in Table 4. As the
infection started late in India, the value is low till February but after that, it increased
gradually. At the same time, the exposed value shows a high variation because of various
restrictions imposed by the government in India. High ε values requires more testing and
quarantining of individuals. The value of espilon in all the countries shows a mix trend due to
the restrictions and relaxations offered by the governments from time-to-time. For different
countries, the 𝛼 values have been shown in Table 5. 𝛼 denotes the onset rate of infection.
This value is constantly high in USA as well as in India. This indicates that the exposed
population develops infection symptoms very rapidly in both the countries. In Brazil, Russia,
Peru and Colombia, this value shows a mixed trend, depicting a variation in the onset rate.
Therefore, the onset period of the appearance of symptoms is almost the same in case of these
four nations. The 𝛾 value represents the Recovery Rate which is high in India and Brazil as
shown in Table 6. However, in USA, the 𝛾 value is lowest, thus indicating a low Recovery
Rate and high number of Active Infected cases as compared to other nations. Russia had a
high 𝛾 value in the initial phase of the pandemic. However, this values started decreasing
over time. Mu indicates the rate at which infected individuals succumb to the infection. The
values of mu for different countries are shown in Table 7. Mu is highest in USA, indicating a
large number of fatalities in the country. The fatality rate in India is very low and the same
has been depicted by Table 7. Similarly, Russia also shows a very low mu value, and hence a
low fatality rate.

6. Conclusion
With the rise of COVID-19 cases worldwide, countries need to equip themselves to tackle
this pandemic. This can be achieved through accurate predictions of infections in order to
help the national governments to prepare policies to control the spread of the infection. These
predictions also help in planning both short-term and long-term guidelines to handle the
pandemic situation. In this paper, a Modified SEIRD (Susceptible-Exposed-InfectedRecovered-Deceased) model was used to perform COVID-19 predictions for six countries
having the highest number of total cases. These include USA, India, Brazil, Russia, Peru and
Colombia. This model was chosen as it includes a component which handles infectious
asymptomatic individuals and in COVID-19, infections are spread even by asymptomatic
persons who are not even aware that they are infected. To predict the trend of the pandemic,
epidemiological data up to 9th September 2020 was utilised for experimentation. Short-term
predictions were obtained till 31st December 2020, while long-term predictions were
performed till the end of year 2023. For short-term predictions, the results were statistically
analysed by using t-test with 99% confidence. As per predictions by Modified SEIRD model,
it was found that the peak of COVID-19 in USA is expected around July 2022 with 2,29,457
daily confirmed cases, while in India, it is expected around May 2021 with 21,26,406 cases
coming daily. It was also observed that Russia and Brazil witnessed the peak of infection in
May 2020 and July 2020 respectively, whereas for Peru and Colombia the peak of COVID19 infection was witnessed in August 2020.
