Summary
Background
Many countries have banned groups and gatherings as part of their response to the pandemic
caused by the coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. Although there are outbreak reports involving mass
gatherings, the contribution to overall transmission is unknown.
Methods
We used data from a survey of social contact behaviour that specifically asked about contact
with groups to estimate the Population Attributable Fraction (PAF) due to groups as the relative
change in the Basic Reproduction Number when groups are prevented.
Findings
Groups of 50+ individuals accounted for 0.5% of reported contact events, and we estimate that
the PAF due to groups of 50+ people is 5.4% (95%CI 1.4%, 11.5%). The PAF due to groups of 20+
people is 18.9% (12.7%, 25.7%) and the PAF due to groups of 10+ is 25.2% (19.4%, 31.4%)
Interpretation
Large groups of individuals have a relatively small epidemiological impact; small and medium
sized groups between 10 and 50 people have a larger impact on an epidemic.
INTRODUCTION
Preventing social contacts has been used worldwide in 2020 to reduce transmission of the
novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. Early restrictions introduced sought to limit the number of
people that could meet at one time. In the UK, Scotland banned all large gatherings over 500
people in March 2020 and gatherings were to be banned in England but then the national stayat-home order was introduced on 23 March 2020. As the first lockdown was eased, gatherings
or more than 30 were banned, which was then reduced to “the rule of six” in September 2020
to prevent groups of more than six individuals meeting simultaneously.

Given knowledge of transmission mechanisms, bringing together groups of people into the
same space should prove conducive for the spread of close-contact infectious diseases. Indeed,
gatherings have been associated with outbreaks of communicable diseases such as measles[1],
influenza[2] and meningitis[3]. Public health agencies, including the World Health Organization
(WHO), have specific guidance for preventing disease outbreaks at mass gatherings[4]. Factors
such as age of participant[1], zoonotic transmission and presence of animals[5], crowding[6,7],
lack of sanitation[7], location and event duration[6] are associated with the reporting of mass
gathering-related outbreaks.
Despite the evidence of the importance of gatherings for disease transmission from intuition
and individual outbreaks, the population-level impact of different mass gathering policies has
not been established. While systematic reviews have identified outbreak reports involving mass
gatherings[5,6], the overall impact of mass gatherings could not be quantitatively assessed. A
detailed modelling study of disease transmission in the state of Georgia, USA, found that in
extreme scenarios when 25% of the population participated in a 2-day long gathering shortly
before the epidemic peak, peak prevalence could increase by up to 10%. More realistic
scenarios resulted in minimal population-level changes[8].
The Population Attributable Fraction (PAF) is a measure of the importance of a risk factor to
disease burden or death in a population, borrowed from non-communicable disease
epidemiology[9]. The PAF of a risk factor is the percentage of disease burden or mortality that
can be attributed to the presence of that increased risk; an example is the PAF of lung cancer
cases that are due to smoking. In previous work, we demonstrated that for infectious diseases,
the PAF can be estimated as the percentage change in the Basic Reproduction Number (average
number of secondary cases per infectious case in an otherwise susceptible population[10]) in
the counterfactual situation where the risk factor is removed from the population[11]. Here, we
use representative data on individuals’ daily social contacts, including group contacts, to
estimate the Population Attributable Fraction (PAF) due to groups and gatherings.
METHODS
Social contact data
The Social Contact Survey (SCS) [12,13] collected data on social contacts from 5,388 participants
between 2009 and 2010 in the UK. Participants were asked to enumerate other people with
whom they had had contact over the course of a single day. Contacts were defined as those
with whom participants had a face-to-face conversation within 3 metres and/or physically
touched skin-on-skin. Participants were able report individual contacts and up to five groups of
contacts, for instance church groups, weddings, large work functions or multiple contacts at
work. The ‘groups’ question was designed to aid participants in reporting multiple similar
contacts. Group contacts were defined in the same way as individual contacts, i.e. if a person
attended a concert with 1,000 people, but only spoke to 5 people, the number of recorded
group contacts would be 5. Participants were asked whether members of the group knew each
other.

As well as the number of contacts, participants were asked to estimate the length of time spent
with each contact or group of contacts as either: less than 10 minutes, 11-30 minutes, 31-60
minutes or over 60 minutes, the distance from home, the frequency with which the contact
took place and whether it involved physical contact.
The SCS data are available to download at http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/54273/.
Reproduction Numbers and Population Attributable Fraction
We calculate the Basic Reproduction Number with and without groups of various sizes. For each
participant 𝑗, we use their 𝑗! contact reports to calculate their individual Reproduction
%
%
Number,𝑅"#$ . We assumed that 𝑅"#$ . is proportional to the number of individuals reported in
the contact, 𝑛" , (𝑛" = 1 for single contacts, 𝑛" > 1 for groups) multiplied by the duration of
each contact, 𝑑" :
%!

%

𝑅"#$ ∝ +

"&'

𝑛" 𝑑"

The duration of each contact is taken as the mid-point of each time interval, i.e. 5 minutes, 20
minutes, 45 minutes and 6 hours, as recorded by the participant. The interpretation of contact
duration is different for individual versus group contacts, as there is a limit to the number of
face-to-face contacts that one person can make in a finite time. We observe a saturation of
contact duration for individuals with large numbers of contacts (figure 1B). The saturation
occurs between 20 and 30 contacts per individual. We adjust for this by dividing the duration of
group contacts by the number of individuals in the group, when the number of group contacts
is greater than a random number between 20 and 30.
The population-level reproduction number is the average number of secondary cases caused by
%
an average infectious person. Individuals with higher 𝑅"#$ with contribute more to the
population-level 𝑅( because they are more likely to get infected than individuals with lower
%
𝑅"#$ . Therefore, we estimate 𝑅( as a bootstrap resample (random sample with replacement) of
the individual reproduction numbers weighted by the individual reproduction numbers:
%

*

𝑅( ∗ = 𝐵𝑜𝑜𝑡 /0𝑅"#$ 1 2

𝑗 = 1…𝑁

(2)

where 𝑁 is the number of participants in the SCS. The mean and 95% Confidence Intervals were
calculated from the bootstrapped sample.
We calculated the PAF for groups of size 𝐺 or greater as the percentage change in the Basic
Reproduction Number:
𝑃𝐴𝐹+ = 1 − 𝑅, (𝑤𝑖𝑡ℎ𝑜𝑢𝑡 𝑔𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑝𝑠 ≥ 𝐺)⁄𝑅, (𝑤𝑖𝑡ℎ 𝑔𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑝𝑠).
We investigate the PAF for groups of greater than 10, and up to groups greater than 100, in
increments of 10. We investigated differences between groups that knew each other and
groups that did not know each other.

48,001 unique contacts were reported by 5,388 participants. Of those, 42,945 (89%) were
individual contacts and 5,056 groups were reported (accounting for 11% of reported contacts).
The median and mean number of contacts per person was 11.5 and 27.0, range 1 to 3,011
(figure 1A).
2,427 (45%) of participants reported group contacts. The majority of groups reported (3,860;
76%) were groups of people who knew each other. 2,979 (59%) groups had 10 or fewer
members; the median and mean reported group size was 9 and 20.3 individuals respectively.
Restricting contacts to groups of size 50 or less, reduces the median and mean number of
individual contacts per person to 11.0 and 18.8; restricting contacts to groups of size 20 or less,
reduces the median and mean number of contacts per person to 10.0 and 14.1; restricting
contacts to groups of size 10 or less, reduces the median and mean number of contacts per
person to 9 and 11.0. Figure 1 shows the degree distribution (number of contacts) per person
with and without contacts associated with groups of size greater than 10.
Compared to individual contacts, group contacts were more likely to be more than 2 miles from
the participants home (64% versus 51%), less likely to involve physical contact (25% versus 44%)
and more likely to involve new individuals (21% versus 15%).
Population Attributable Fraction (PAF)
The PAF due to groups decreased with increasing group size. For the largest groups with more
than 100 individuals the PAF100 is estimated at 0.6% (95% CI: 0.4%, 0.8%). The PAF50 is
estimated at 5.5% (95% CI: 1.4%, 11.4%); the PAF20 is 18.9% (95% CI: 12.7%, 25.7%); the PAF10 is
25.2% (95% CI: 19.4%, 31.4%) (figure 2).
The pattern of decreasing PAF with increasing group size is seen for both groups of individuals
who are known to each other and groups of individuals who are unknown to each other. The
PAF due to groups of 10+ known to each other is estimated at 20.6% (95% CI: 15.4%, 26.3%)
and due to groups of 50+ known to each other is estimated at 2.9% (95% CI: 0.8%, 6.9%). The
remaining contribution to Rt is due to contact with individuals.
The estimated impact of large groups on 𝑅( is due to the relative frequency with which they are
reported in the Social Contact Survey. These results highlight the relative importance of
medium-size groups of between 10 and 20 individuals.
DISCUSSION
In this paper, we analysed social contact data in the context of infectious disease transmission
and gatherings. Our findings suggest that large groups of individuals have a relatively small
impact on an epidemic. This is due to the relative rarity of large-scale gatherings and the sublinear scaling between number of contacts and infectivity.
The Social Contact Survey (SCS) is one of a number of social contact surveys that have been
conducted to quantify the impact of social mixing on disease transmission[14–18]. The SCS

specifically asked about groups of similar contacts. These groups are not necessarily public or
mass gatherings, and represented groups that both knew each other and those that did not.
The group sizes reported in the SCS were not necessarily the same size of an event where
contacts may have taken place. Therefore, this analysis should be considered in terms of
contacts per person, rather than to guide the acceptable size of organised events. The SCS
asked about contacts on a single day and did not capture multi-day events; simulation studies
have shown that prolonged mass gatherings were necessary to alter the course of an
epidemic[8]. Our analysis was based on social contact data collected between 2009 and 2010;
contact patterns may have altered in the past decade. We also did not account for individuals
changing their behaviour if group activities were cancelled.
In the context of COVID-19 mitigation, this analysis considered one aspect of gatherings: the
impact on an epidemic. However, there may be other valid reasons for preventing mass events,
such as policing and managing resources. Our analysis implicitly assumes that infection is
already present in the population as is the case for COVID-19; for other diseases, gatherings can
be associated with increased global travel which can bring new strains into an area or result in
out-of-season outbreaks, which were also not captured here.
Our findings illustrate the difficult choices that are necessary to limit COVID-19 spread.
Meetings of large groups of more than 100 individuals are relatively infrequent, and their
prohibition may have a limited impact on the epidemic. More epidemiologically relevant are
groups of 10 to 20 people, as they occur more frequently and could potentially have a larger
impact on transmission; they may also involve inter-generational family groups. This analysis
was designed to aid decision-making in the context of social distancing measures to control
COVID-19. and should be considered against alternative control strategies so that the most
effective measures can be implemented in the long term.
