Abstract:

The pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has proven challenging clinically, and at the
population level, due to heterogeneity in both transmissibility and severity. Recent
case incidence in Ontario, Canada (autumn 2020) has outstripped incidence in seen
during the first (spring) pandemic wave; but has been associated with a lower
incidence of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and deaths. We hypothesized that
differential ICU burden might be explained by increased testing volumes, as well as
the shift in mean case age from older to younger. We constructed a negative binomial
regression model using only three covariates, at a 2-week lag: log10(weekly cases);
log10(weekly deaths); and mean weekly case age. This model reproduced observed ICU
admission volumes, and demonstrated good preliminary predictive validity.
Furthermore, when admissions were used in combination with ICU length of stay, our
modeled estimates demonstrated excellent convergent validity with ICU occupancy
data reported by the Canadian Institute for Health Information. Our approach needs
external validation in other settings and at larger and smaller geographic scales, but
appears to be a useful short-term forecasting tool for ICU resource demand; we also
demonstrate that the virulence of SARS-CoV-2 infection has not meaningfully changed
in Ontario between the first and second waves, but the demographics of those
infected, and the fraction of cases identified, have.

Background:

The pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has proven challenging clinically, and at the
population level, due to heterogeneity in both transmissibility and severity. Critical
care resources have been recognized from early in the pandemic as an important
societal chokepoint, and saturation of critical care capacity can result in catastrophic
care outcomes (1). Subsequent to the spring 2020 wave of COVID-19, the Canadian
province of Ontario saw a decline in daily cases and deaths, and reduced ICU
occupancy. Since September 2020, exponential growth in cases has occurred again,
with daily case counts exceeding those seen in spring, with (to date) fewer fatalities,
and fewer individuals requiring intensive care (2). We noted that the age distribution
of COVID-19 cases in Ontario had changed markedly since the spring wave, and also
that the province was performing far more testing, suggesting that the apparent
decrease in virulence might simply reflect younger age distribution of more recent
cases, combined with inflated case counts due to increased case identification.

Objectives

We sought to determine whether average age of cases, in combination with case
counts and test volumes, can explain the apparent decline in COVID-19 virulence in
Ontario, Canada; and whether simple regression models based on these covariates
might provide a parsimonious and accurate means of near-term forecasting of ICU
demand in the province.

This study was approved by the Research Ethics Board of the University of Toronto.
We obtained COVID-related ICU admissions, newly reported case counts, average
weekly case age, and testing volumes for the province of Ontario to October 30, 2020,
using the Integrated Public Health Information System (iPHIS), and Ontario Laboratory
Information System (OLIS), as described elsewhere (3). Lags in case and ICU
admission reporting were corrected by dividing the counts in the last 14 days of the
time series by fractional reporting, derived using Kaplan-Meier methods. We
constructed negative binomial regression models that predicted weekly ICU
admissions based on average case age, log10(weekly test volumes) and log10(weekly
case counts) at 2-week lags based on an average lag between symptom onset and ICU
admission of 9.5 days (IQR 5 to 11 days). Resultant model fit was excellent (Figure
1a, Table 1).

We performed a preliminary evaluation of predictive validity using iPHIS and OLIS
datasets from November 11, 2020. Running the model forward we saw good
agreement between observations and expectations of ICU admissions. We assessed
convergent validity of validated our ICU admission estimates by transforming them to
ICU occupancy estimates by adding predicted admissions each week and removing
current ICU occupants at a rate of 1/L, where L is expected average mean length of
stay for individuals admitted to ICU in a given week. We compared these estimates to
independent reports of COVID-19-related ICU occupancy in Ontario from the
Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI); model-based estimates and CIHI
reports for each week were well-correlated (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.98, 95%
CI 0.97 to 0.99). (Figure 1b).

Our model covariates can be converted to a simple score: S = 49.1(log10(weekly cases))
+ (mean age) – 14.6(log10(weekly tests)) – 39.5. Weekly predicted ICU admissions are
then calculated e(0.046S), where 0.046 is the smallest covariate from the negative
binomial model. Predictions generated using such an approach, which can be used for
planning purposes are presented in Figure 1c.

Discussion

The marked variability in severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection by age makes surveillance
of the pandemic using only case counts problematic. We show here that future ICU
burden can be accurately forecast if case counts are used in conjunction with
estimates of test frequency and mean case age. Others have previously noted that
correction for test frequency is necessary for accurate forecasting and estimation of
infection fatality (4, 5), and we have also noted previously that variability in population
age structure is a key determinant of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic severity (6). Here we show
that these elements considered in conjunction can provide a simple, apparently valid
approach to near term forecasting of ICU utilization. A similar approach might be
applied to mortality forecasting or hospitalization.

Limitations of this work include lack of prospective assessment of predictive validity,
which is now ongoing, and also uncertainty around generalizability of this approach to
other jurisdictions, and to larger and smaller geographic scales. Nonetheless, the
apparent ability to accurately forecast ICU demand on a two-week time horizon may
prove particularly useful to those charged with management of healthcare resource

during the pandemic. Conceptually, our finding that case counts need to be presented
in context of who (demographically) is infected and how many individuals were tested
to arrive at a given case count, allows for more nuanced and meaningful risk
communication during the current pandemic.
