ABSTRACT
Objective To investigate the humoral and cellular immune response to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines
in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) on immunomodulatory treatment.
Methods Established patients at NYU Langone Health with IMID (n=51) receiving the BNT162b2
mRNA vaccination were assessed at baseline and after second immunization. Healthy subjects served
as controls (n=26). IgG antibody responses to the spike protein were analyzed for humoral response.
Cellular immune response to SARS-CoV-2 was further analyzed using high-parameter spectral flow
cytometry. A second independent, validation cohort of controls (n=182) and patients with IMID
(n=31) from Erlangen, Germany were also analyzed for humoral immune response.
Results Although healthy subjects (n=208) and IMID patients on biologic treatments (mostly on TNF
blockers, n=37) demonstrate robust antibody responses (over 90%), those patients with IMID on
background methotrexate (n=45) achieve an adequate response in only 62.2% of cases. Similarly,
IMID patients do not demonstrate an increase in CD8+ T cell activation after vaccination.
Conclusions In two independent cohorts of IMID patients, methotrexate, a widely used
immunomodulator for the treatment of several IMIDs, adversely affected humoral and cellular
immune response to COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. Although precise cut offs for immunogenicity that
correlate with vaccine efficacy are yet to be established, our findings suggest that different strategies
may need to be explored in patients with IMID taking methotrexate to increase the chances of
immunization efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 as has been demonstrated for augmenting
immunogenicity to other viral vaccines.

KEY MESSAGES:
What is already known about this subject?
• The impact of COVID-19 has been felt across the globe and new hope has arisen with the
approval of mRNA vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown immunogenicity
and efficacy rates of over 90% in the immunocompetent adult population. However, there is a
lack of knowledge surrounding the response of patients with immune-mediated inflammatory
diseases (IMIDs) who may also be on immunomodulatory medications.
• Patients with IMID have been shown to have attenuated immune responses to seasonal
influenza vaccination.
What does this study add?
• This study looks at the humoral and cellular immune response to two doses of BNT162b2
mRNA COVID-19 Vaccine in participants with IMID (on immunomodulators) compared with
healthy controls.
• Individuals with IMID on methotrexate demonstrate up to a 62% reduced rate of adequate
immunogenicity to the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination. Those on anti-cytokine or nonmethotrexate oral medications demonstrate similar levels of immunogenicity as healthy
controls (greater than 90%).
• Similarly, vaccination did not induce an activated CD8+ T cell response in participants on
background methotrexate, unlike healthy controls and patients with IMID not receiving
methotrexate.
How might this impact of clinical practice or future developments?
• These results suggest that patients on methotrexate may need alternate vaccination strategies
such as additional doses of vaccine, dose modification of methotrexate, or even a temporary
discontinuation of this drug. Further studies will be required to explore the effect of these
approaches on mRNA vaccine immunogenicity.

INTRODUCTION
Patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs), have an inherently heightened
susceptibility to infection and may thus be considered high risk for developing coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19). Importantly, however, the strength of response to viral vaccines (i.e., influenza
and hepatitis B) and their long-lasting protective effects in IMID patients taking conventionaldisease modifying anti-rheumatic (cDMARDs), such as methotrexate, or biologic (bDMARDs),
such as tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFis), may not be as robust as it is in the general
population following immunization.(1-5) Data regarding mRNA COVID-19 vaccines’ safety,
immunogenicity and efficacy are rapidly emerging for the immunocompetent adult population,(6)
where more than 90% subjects achieve a satisfactory humoral response. However, the ability of
IMID patients to adequately respond to these vaccines and the differences in humoral and cellular
immune response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination are not known, leaving a significant gap in
knowledge that prevents optimal management of this patient population.
Given the experience with seasonal influenza vaccine immunogenicity,(2, 7) we hypothesized that
IMID patients treated chronically with certain csDMARDs (i.e., methotrexate) would have an
attenuated response to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines compared to IMID patients receiving anticytokine treatment or to non-IMID participants. To achieve this, we obtained pre- and postimmunization peripheral blood monocyte cells (PBMCs) and sera from IMID participants (n=82)
in two independent cohorts (SAGA (Serologic Testing And Genomic Analysis of Autoimmune,
Immune-Mediated, and Rheumatic Patients with COVID-19) cohort in New York City, USA and
Erlangen cohort, Germany) and analyzed SARS-CoV-2-spike-specific antibody titers as compared
to non-IMID controls (n=208). Cellular immune responses were further investigated using highdimensional spectral flow cytometry in the New York City cohort.
METHODS
Participants
Established patients with IMID (n=51) receiving methotrexate, anti-cytokine biologics, or both
participating in the SAGA study at New York University Langone Health in New York City,(8)
who were receiving BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination were assessed at baseline and after the
second dose during the period from December 23, 2020 through March 31, 2021. Healthy
subjects served as controls (n= 26). IgG antibody responses to the S protein were analyzed for
humoral immune response. A second independent validation cohort of controls (n=182) and
patients with IMID (n=31) on either TNFi or methotrexate monotherapy from Erlangen,
Germany was also analyzed for humoral response. Cellular immune responses to the vaccine
were also studied for the New York SAGA participants using high-parameter spectral flow
cytometry.
Humoral and cellular immune response to BNT162b2 mRNA Vaccine
Humoral immune response was assessed by testing IgG antibodies against the spike protein of
SAR-CoV-2.(9) In the New York Cohort, direct ELISA was used to quantify antibody titers on
serum as previously described.(10) Titer of 5,000 units or greater was used as the cut off to
determine an adequate response to vaccination. IgG antibodies against the S1 domain of the
spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 were tested in the Erlangen participants using the commercial
enzyme–linked immunosorbent assay from Euroimmun (Lübeck, Germany) on the

EUROIMMUN Analyzer I platform and according to the manufacturers protocol.(11) Adequate
response was defined as greater than 5.7 nm OD. Immune cell phenotyping pre- and postimmunization in New York participants was performed by 35-color spectral flow cytometry on
PBMCs. Further details on methodology and analysis can be found in the Supplementary
Appendix.
Statistical Analysis
Patient characteristics were summarized using means, medians, standard deviations, ranges, and
percentages as appropriate. Chi squared tests of independence and Fischer’s exact tests were
used for categorical data. Mann Whitney U and Kruskal Wallis tests were used for unpaired
continuous data and Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests were used for paired continuous data. A p value
of less than .05 was considered significant. All analyses were done using R v3.6.0 software (R
Foundation for Statistical Computing) and GraphPad Prism v9 (GraphPad Software).
Patient and Public Involvement
This study was designed in response to frequent questions asked by patients with IMID but did
not contain any direct public involvement.
RESULTS
The New York cohort was comprised of 26 healthy individuals, 25 individuals with IMID
receiving methotrexate monotherapy or in combination with other immunomodulatory
medications, and 26 individuals with IMID on anti-cytokine therapy and/or other oral
immunomodulators (Table 1). Healthy individuals and those with IMID not on methotrexate
were similar in age (49.2 +/- 11.9 and 49.1 +/- 14.9 years respectively), while those IMID
patients receiving methotrexate were generally older (63.2 +/- 11.9). IMID diagnoses were
predominantly psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. The Erlangen cohort
consisted of 182 healthy subjects, 11 subjects with IMID receiving TNFi monotherapy, and 20
subjects with IMID on methotrexate monotherapy (Supplementary Table 1). Individuals on
methotrexate monotherapy were on average older than healthy individuals and those with IMID
not on methotrexate (54.5 +/- 19.2 vs. 40.8+/- 12 .0 and 45.0 +/- 15.5 respectively).
Decreased antibody response to mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in IMID patients on
methotrexate
Immunogenicity was characterized by testing IgG antibodies against the spike protein of SARSCoV-2. In the New York cohort, of the healthy participants, 25 of 26 (96.1%) demonstrated
adequate humoral immune response. Patients with IMID not on methotrexate achieved a similar
rate of high antibody titers (24/26, 92.3%), while those on methotrexate had a lower rate of
adequate humoral response (18/25, 72.0%) (Figure 1A, Table 1). This remains true even after
the exclusion of patients who had evidence of previous COVID-19 infection (P= .045). Median
titers were 104,354 (range 141-601,185), 113,608 (25-737,310), and 46,901 (25-694,528) for
participants who were healthy, IMID not on methotrexate, and IMID on methotrexate,
respectively. Similarly, in the Erlangen validation cohort, 179 of 182 (98.3%) of healthy
controls, 10 of 11 (90.9%) of patients with IMID receiving no methotrexate, and 10 of 20
(50.0%) receiving methotrexate achieved adequate immunogenicity (Figure 1B). Median ODs
for this cohort were 9.4 (range 1.2-14), 7.8 (2.3-11.3), and 5.9 (0.95-13.5) for participants who

were healthy, IMID not on methotrexate, and IMID on methotrexate, respectively. Furthermore,
when looking at the two cohorts in conjunction (n = 290), 204 of 208 (98.1%) of healthy
controls, 34 of 37 (91.9%) of patients with IMID receiving no methotrexate, and 28 of 45
(62.2%) receiving methotrexate achieved adequate immunogenicity (P= < 0.001) (Figure S1).
Because of the imbalance in age between groups, we further analyzed immunogenicity based on
a cut off age of 55. In both age groups, the response rate for those on methotrexate remained
significantly lower (P=< 0.001) (Figure S2). As an added sensitivity analysis, we used a stricter
definition of inadequate antibody response (i.e., less than 1000 units for New York cohort and
less than 5 OD for the Erlagen cohort). With the use of these more conservative cut off levels,
patients with IMID on background methotrexate continued to show significantly decreased
antibody response (P< .001) (Figure S3).
Lack of CD8+ T-cell activation in IMID patients on methotrexate following mRNA
COVID-19 vaccine
In the New York Cohort, 20 healthy controls, 24 patients with IMID not receiving methotrexate,
and 18 patients with IMID who were receiving methotrexate underwent immune cell
phenotyping before and after vaccination. The proportions of spike-specific B cells, circulating
T follicular helper (cTfh; CD4+ICOS+CD38+ subset) cells, activated CD4+ T cells, and HLADR+ CD8+ T cells increased significantly in all groups after immunization (Figures 2A-D).
Activated CD8+ T cells, defined as CD8+ T cells expressing Ki67 and CD38, and the granzyme
B-producing (GZMB) subset of these activated CD8+ T cells, were induced in healthy adults and
participants with IMID not on methotrexate, but not induced in patients receiving methotrexate
(Figures 2E-F).
DISCUSSION
In two geographically independent cohorts of IMID patients, we found that methotrexate, a widely
used immunomodulator for the treatment of several IMIDs, adversely affected humoral and
cellular immunogenicity to COVID-19 mRNA vaccines.
For humoral immunity, the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccines did not induce adequately elevated
SARS-CoV-2-spike-specific-IgG antibody titers in up to a third of the patients on methotrexate,
as compared to IMID patients on other DMARDs, whom demonstrated a response as robust as
that of healthy controls. This finding was analogous to the previously described effects of
methotrexate on influenza vaccine immunogenicity.(5, 12-14) While a recent report has shown
no differences in immunogenicity for patients with IMID, none of the included participants were
on methotrexate.(15) A second study in patients with self-reported rheumatic and
musculoskeletal diseases recruited via social media showed that 10 out of 13 participants on
background methotrexate had detectable antibody levels after only one dose of SARS-CoV-2
mRNA vaccine,(16) although this was both underpowered and using a semi-quantitative ELISA
measuring antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain. Therefore, the findings
from our work looking at antibody responses in IMID patients after full vaccination regimen are
of potentially high clinical relevance, since it was recently shown that a temporary
discontinuation of methotrexate for two weeks significantly improved influenza vaccine
immunogenicity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.(2)

Importantly, the use of high-dimensional spectral flow cytometry allowed for the interrogation of
specific cellular immune responses before and after immunization. Spike-specific B cells,
activated CD4+ T cells and cTfh cells were induced similarly in all groups after mRNA
vaccination. In contrast, activated CD8+ T cell responses were notably attenuated in the
methotrexate cohort. Moreover, the poor induction of activated CD8+ T cells expressing
granzyme B may indicate reduced cytotoxic functionality of these cells. Indeed, CD8+ T cell
responses were identified to be a correlate of protection in non-human primate studies of SARSCoV-2 infection.(17) Thus, reduced induction of cytotoxic CD8+ T cell responses, combined
with inconsistent induction of antibody responses, may further impair effectiveness of COVID19 vaccines and render IMID patients on methotrexate more at risk of inadequate vaccine
response. However, this finding requires a cautious interpretation as it is quite possible that the
use of methotrexate may delay (rather than prevent) adequate cellular mediated immunity against
SARS-CoV-2. While spike-specific T-cell immunity has been detected as early as 10 days
following one dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in healthy individuals,(18) mRNA-1273specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses were most robustly elicited two weeks after the
second dose.(19) Therefore, more detailed and comprehensive studies that include longer term
characterization of the dynamics of cellular responses to these vaccines will be required to
understand the clinical implications of these findings.
Although our analysis was limited in sample size, followed participants with biosampling for a
relatively short period of time without standardized disease activity status metrics, and was
restricted to one type of mRNA immunization, our findings were validated in an independent
cohort and revealed that methotrexate, which is widely used for many indications, adversely
affected the humoral and cellular immunogenicity to COVID-19 mRNA vaccination.
Furthermore, because of the inclusion of patients with prior COVID-19 infection, it is possible
that results could be biased in favor of those not on methotrexate. However, when excluding all
patients with prior infection, the results remained similar. We also acknowledge that there may
have been participants with asymptomatic COVID-19 infection that we have not captured.
While immunosenescence may reduce the level of antibody responses to immunizations,(20)
recent studies on COVID-19 mRNA vaccines have not shown differences in clinical outcomes for
the older population.(6) In our study, IMID patients on methotrexate were generally older which
may potentially explain some differences in immunogenicity. However, even when looking at
participants younger than 55, decreased rates of humoral response were still significant. Further
validation in even larger cohorts that address efficacy will be required to understand the interaction
between age and methotrexate in the context of COVID-19 vaccination.
Importantly, it is not yet clear what level of immunogenicity is representative of vaccine efficacy
(and this includes the arbitrary cut offs chosen for our measurements). We recognize that the
definition of adequate cellular and humoral immune response may need to be refined in the future
when correlation with efficacy becomes available. However, even after applying more
conservative cut offs, the hampering effects of methotrexate on immunogenicity are still evident.
Taken together, our results suggest that the optimal protection of patients with IMID against
COVID-19 will require further studies to determine whether additional doses of vaccine, dose

Figure 1. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels in cohorts from New York City (A) and Erlangen (B) in
healthy participants without immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID; blue), IMID
patients not receiving methotrexate (MTX; green), and IMID patients treated with MTX
(yellow). Solid lines represent mean titer of each group. For the New York City cohort (A),
adequate response is defined as greater than 5000 units and for the Erlangen cohort (B), adequate
response is defined as greater than 5.7 (OD450nm), two standard deviations of the mean of
controls. Percentages and group comparisons using chi squared test of independence reflect
proportion of those achieving an adequate response within each group.
* indicates p value less than .05.
**indicated p value less than .001.
