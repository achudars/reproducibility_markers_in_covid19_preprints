Abstract
Background: Serology tests can identify previous infections and facilitate estimation of the
number of total infections. However, immunoglobulins targeting severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been reported to wane below the detectable level
of serological assays. We estimate the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection from
serology studies, accounting for expected levels of antibody acquisition (seroconversion) and
waning (seroreversion), and apply this framework using data from New York City (NYC) and
Connecticut.
Methods: We estimated time from seroconversion to seroreversion and infection fatality ratio
(IFR) using mortality data from March-October 2020 and population-level cross-sectional
seroprevalence data from April-August 2020 in NYC and Connecticut. We then estimated the
daily seroprevalence and cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Findings: The estimated average time from seroconversion to seroreversion was 3-4 months.
The estimated IFR was 1.1% (95% credible interval: 1.0-1.2%) in NYC and 1.4% (1.1-1.7%) in
Connecticut. The estimated daily seroprevalence declined after a peak in the spring. The
estimated cumulative incidence reached 26.8% (24.2-29.7%) and 8.8% (7.1-11.3%) at the end
of September in NYC and Connecticut, higher than maximum seroprevalence measures (22.1%
and 6.1%), respectively.
Interpretation: The cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection is underestimated using
cross-sectional serology data without adjustment for waning antibodies. Our approach can help
quantify the magnitude of underestimation and adjust estimates for waning antibodies.
Funding: This study was supported by the US National Science Foundation and the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), rapidly spread across the world in 2020.1 Globally,
there have been 36 million documented cases and more than one million COVID-19 associated
fatalities as of October 15, 2020, with case counts continuing to increase. 2 Reliable
measurement of infection history in a population is a critical epidemiologic outcome, and is
needed to derive several key epidemiologic indices such as the infection fatality ratio (IFR).
However, the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections reported through public health surveillance
mechanisms is underestimated because of the limited capacity of testing and surveillance
systems, an overwhelmed healthcare system, low healthcare-seeking behavior among those
with mild disease, imperfect sensitivity of diagnostic tests (especially rapid antigen tests) and a
large fraction of infections that are asymtomatic.3 Assays that detect viral antigen or genomic
material cannot identify individuals who were previously infected once viral material is no longer
present. In contrast, serology tests measuring the level of immunoglobulins have the potential to
identify those previously infected. Serology results can be used to generate an estimate of the
cumulative incidence, but this requires the relatively strong assumption that antibodies persist
permanently after infection. Because antibody levels for SARS-CoV-2 wane over time and can
become undetectable, some previously infected individuals could have already returned to a
seronegative status at the time of testing (i.e. seroreversion). Hence, new methods are needed
to account for waning antibodies when using cross-sectional serology data to estimate
cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The adjusted cumulative incidence can then be
used to obtain more accurate estimates of critical epidemiologic measures, such as the IFR and
the case ascertainment ratio.
Population-level serosurveys for SARS-CoV-2 have been conducted across the world,
with variation in geographic scale, sample demographics, sampling mechanisms, and testing
methods.4,5 Although the reported incidence of COVID-19 varies widely by location, a consistent

finding in all settings is that total estimated infections vastly outnumber confirmed cases. For
example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and commercial laboratories
conducted large-scale geographic longitudinal serosurveys in 10 sites in the United States in the
spring and summer of 2020.6 Seroprevalence ranged from 1% to 6.9% across sites. That study
estimated that the number of total infections was 6-24 times higher than that of documented
cases, while acknowledging that these ratios varied widely depending on the timing of sampling
or the stage of the epidemic in each location. These early population-level serosurveys provided
critical insights on the true burden of COVID-19; however, as we enter the 10th month of the US
epidemic, the ability to estimate the cumulative incidence directly from serosurveys is
increasingly limited because antibody levels continue to wane and the corresponding serologic
‘record’ of historical infection is lost. Indeed, Ibarrondo et al. estimated that the half-life of antiSARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain IgG was 36 days.7 Patel et al. reported that over
half (11/19) of health care personnel who tested seropositive in early April became seronegative
at a second visit in June (approximately 60 days after the baseline).8 Taken together, these
findings suggest that serosurveys have likely failed to recognize previous infection in those
whose antibody levels have already waned below the detectable limit at the time of sampling.
An adjustment for waning antibody kinetics must account for the interacting timescales of
antibody kinetics, case incidence and the period over which a serosurvey is conducted.
Here, we describe a framework for estimating the cumulative incidence and IFR of
SARS-CoV-2 from population-level cross-sectional serology data and mortality data, by
adjusting for the timeline of seroconversion (acquisition of the detectable level of antibodies)
and seroreversion (loss of detectable antibodies). We apply this framework to data from New
York City and Connecticut, because these two sites observed a large wave of COVID-19 cases
that lasted for a relatively short period in the spring 2020, followed by low case counts in the
summer and early fall (Figure S1). We note that it is critical to distinguish the ability to detect
antibodies from immunity to reinfection, which may persist longer than antibodies are

detectable.9 We make no claim that the time from seroconversion to seroreversion estimated
from this framework reflects the duration of immunity protection against reinfection.

Methods
Population-level cross-sectional seroprevalence data
Details of the serosurvey conducted by the CDC and commercial laboratories can be
found elsewhere.6,10 Briefly, the survey collected blood samples in 10 US sites (Connecticut,
Louisiana, Minneapolis-St Paul-St Cloud metro area, Missouri, New York City metro area,
Philadelphia metro area, San Francisco Bay area, South Florida, Utah, and Western
Washington State) from March to July 2020, and expanded the serosurvey to all 50 states in
August. Blood specimens were originally collected for reasons unrelated to COVID-19, such as
for routine medical care or sick visits. Multiple rounds of surveys have been conducted at each
site, approximately every 3-4 weeks (Table S1). Each round tested approximately 1,800
samples from each site.11 Samples were tested by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that detects the total immunoglobulin response
(IgA, IgM, and IgG) with sensitivity 96% (95% confidence interval (CI): 98.3-99.9%) and
specificity 99.3% (95% CI: 98.3-99.9%).6 Publicly available seroprevalence data adjusted for
age and sex distributions were downloaded on October 8, 2020.12 We focused our analysis on
New York City and Connecticut because the single, short wave of infection in the spring allowed
us to evaluate how the antibodies acquired over a short period subsequently waned during a
time when minimal new infections were occurring in these locations (Figure S1). More details
can be found in the supplementary methods.

Mortality data and case data
Mortality data are less subject to changes in testing capacity and guidelines over time
than case data, so we used mortality data to estimate parameters. We analyzed daily time

series data on COVID-19 associated deaths from March to September 2020 in New York City
and Connecticut. New York City data and Connecticut data were downloaded from their
government websites on October 2 and 6, 2020, respectively. 13,14 We used the total (i.e.,
probable and confirmed) deaths for our mortality time series (supplementary methods). To
account for a delay distribution between symptom onset and death, we used data on the date of
symptom onset and date of death for 6,999 COVID-19 associated deaths in Georgia, USA from
February to October 2020.
To estimate case ascertainment ratios (see the “Model” section for detail), we also
utilized daily time series data for the number of documented cases in New York City and
Connecticut from their government websites (supplementary methods).13,14

Model
We estimated the IFR and time from seroconversion to seroreversion using the reported
number of deaths and CDC serosurvey data (Figure 1). Using a Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) analysis, we estimated the number of seropositive individuals on day t (𝑆𝑡 ) as follows:
𝑡

𝑆𝑡 = ∑𝑡−1
𝑘=1 𝐼𝑡−𝑘 ∫𝑦=𝑡−𝑘 𝑔𝑦 × (1 − 𝑍𝑡−𝑦 ) , 1 ≤ 𝑡 ≤ 𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥, 1 ≤ 𝑘 ≤ 𝑡 − 1

(Equation 1)

where 𝐼𝑡 is the total number of SARS-CoV-2 infections on day t, which is the number of reported
deaths divided by the estimated IFR, after accounting for the delay between symptom onset and
death (supplementary methods). We estimated the IFR, assuming that the IFR was constant
over time in the main analysis and relaxed this assumption in a sensitivity analysis (see the
“sensitivity analysis” section for details). Additional parameters include tmax, the total number of
days in the daily time series data for COVID-19 deaths, and 𝑔, the probability density function of
the Weibull distribution for time from symptom onset to seroconversion with the mean 11.5 days
and standard deviation 5.7 days,15 which is consistent with other reports.16–19 For asymptomatic
cases, 𝑔 represents the time from onset of infectiousness to seroconversion (supplementary

methods). 𝑍 is the cumulative density function of the Weibull distribution for time from
𝑡

seroconversion to seroreversion. Therefore, ∫𝑦=𝑡−𝑘 𝑔𝑦 × (1 − 𝑍𝑡−𝑦 ) in Equation 1 represents the
probability that an individual seroconverted before day t and seroreverted after day t, which in
other words means the probability that an individual remains seropositive on day t. We
estimated the mean of the Weibull distribution for time from seroconversion to seroreversion,
while fixing standard deviation at 50 days (supplementary method). The daily seroprevalence
(𝑃𝑡 ) was calculated by dividing 𝑆𝑡 by the population (8.3 million for New York City and 3.7 million
for Connecticut). We compared the estimated 𝑃𝑡 with the reported seroprevalence in each round
of the CDC commercial laboratory serosurvey, and calculated the log-likelihood assuming the
binomial distribution, which was then used in the MCMC analysis for parameter estimation
(supplementary methods).
Given an estimated model from above, the number of individuals who seroconverted on
day t (𝐶𝑡 ) may be calculated as follows:
𝐶𝑡 = ∑𝑡−1
𝑘=1 𝐼𝑘 × 𝐺𝑡−𝑘 (Equation 2)
where 𝐺 is the cumulative density function of the aforementioned Weibull distribution for time
from symptom onset to seroconversion. 𝐺𝑡−𝑘 represents the probability that infected individuals
on day k (𝐼𝑘 ) had seroconverted by day t. We calculated the cumulative incidence on day t by
dividing the cumulative sum of 𝐶𝑡 by the population. We also calculated a cumulative case
ascertainment ratio (𝐴𝑡 ) as follows:
∑𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑇

𝑡
𝑡=1
𝐴𝑡 = ∑𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥
(Equation 3)
𝐶
𝑡=1

where 𝑇𝑡 is the number of documented cases on day t (supplementary methods). The

ascertainment bias was calculated as 𝐴 .

The median of the posterior samples was reported as a point estimate, and 2.5th and
97.5th percentiles were reported as 95% credible intervals (CrIs). All analyses were performed

Sensitivity analysis
We performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate how sensitive our results were to different
assumptions. We changed the fixed value of the standard deviation for time from
seroconversion to seroreversion from 50 days to 20 and 70 days. We selected these values
based on previous findings.20 We also relaxed the assumption of the constant IFR. It has been
reported that the IFR and case fatality ratio for COVID-19 declined over time in New York City21
and in other countries.20 Therefore, we assumed that the IFR decreased by 5% per week from
mid-March to the end of July 2020, reflecting findings reported by the previous studies, 21 and
the model estimated the IFR in mid-March (before the decline started). Lastly, we used data
from Wuhan, China to inform delay between symptom onset and death, 22 instead of the Georgia
data to evaluate the impact of variation in this distribution on parameter inference. 23

Ethical considerations
Seroprevalence data, mortality data, and case data in New York City and Connecticut
were publicly available, deidentified, and aggregated. The Georgia Department of Public Health
Institutional Review Board (IRB) has determined that the project is exempt from the requirement
for IRB review and approval.

Results
Estimated timeline of seroreversion, IFR, and case ascertainment ratio
The average time from seroconversion to seroreversion was estimated to be 4.0 months
(95% CrI: 3.6-4.6 months) using the New York City data and 3.0 months (95% CrI: 2.3-4.1
months) using the Connecticut data with the standard deviation fixed at 50 days (Figure 2).

More than 85% of the infected individuals were estimated to become seronegative due to
waning antibodies within six months after seroconversion (Table 1).
The IFR was estimated to be 1.1% (95% CrI: 1.0-1.2%) for New York City and 1.4%
(95% CrI: 1.1-1.7%) for Connecticut. The estimated case ascertainment ratio increased rapidly
in the early phase of the pandemic and continued to gradually increase from May to October in
both sites (Figure 3). The ascertainment ratio was estimated to reach 13% (95% CrI: 12-14%) in
New York City and 18% (95% CrI: 14-23%) in Connecticut at the end of September 2020,
suggesting that the number of estimated infections was 7.7 and 5.6 times greater than the
number of documented cases in New York City and Connecticut, respectively.

Estimated daily seroprevalence and cumulative incidence
In both New York City and Connecticut, the estimated daily seroprevalence decreased
over time after the first wave of COVID-19, diverging from the estimated cumulative incidence
adjusted for waning antibodies (Figure 4). The cumulative incidence was estimated to reach
26.8% (95% CrI: 24.2-29.7%) in New York City and 8.8% (95% CrI: 7.1-11.3%) in Connecticut
at the end of September 2020. In contrast, the estimated daily seroprevalence peaked at 22.1%
(95% CrI: 20.5-23.6%) in mid-May and declined to 4.9% (95% CrI: 3.9-6.9%) by the end of
September in New York City. In Connecticut, the estimated daily seroprevalence peaked at
6.1% (95% CrI: 5.3-7.1%) at the end of May and early June and declined to1.3% (95% CrI: 0.92.0%) by the end of September.

Sensitivity analysis
We ran the analysis with different values of the standard deviation for time from
seroconversion to seroreversion (20, 50, and 70 days). The estimated IFR and average time
from seroconversion to seroreversion were robust to this variation for Connecticut, but the
estimated mean time increased as the standard deviation increased for the New York City data

(Table S2). Although changes in the standard deviation had small effects on the estimated
cumulative incidence, the speed of decline in the daily seroprevalence after the peak varied by
standard deviation (Figure S2). When the standard deviation was 20 days, the daily
seroprevalence declined rapidly after the peak and became 1.2% (95% CrI: 0.9-2.1%) at the
end of September, while it declined more slowly with the standard deviation 70 days (7.4%
(95% CrI: 6.1-8.7%) at the end of September).
Under the assumption of the decreasing IFR (Figure S3), the average time from
seroconversion to seroreversion was estimated to be 4.0 months (95% CrI: 3.5-4.8 months) with
the standard deviation 50 days in New York City, which was consistent with the result using the
constant IFR (Table S2). The estimated IFR in mid-March was 2.9% (95% CrI: 2.6-3.3%), which
automatically decreased by 5% per week and reached 1.1% (95% CrI: 0.9-1.2%) at the end of
July (Figure S3). The average IFR from March to September was 1.4% (95% CrI: 1.2-1.6%).
The daily seroprevalence and cumulative incidence did not appreciably change between the
models using the constant IFR vs. decreasing IFR (Table S2). We also used data from Wuhan,
China to account for variation in the delay between symptom onset and death (Figure S4), and
found that results were robust to this change (Table S2).

Discussion
A reliable estimate of the cumulative number of people who have been infected with
SARS-CoV-2 is critical for understanding and, ultimately, controlling the COVID-19 pandemic.
Measuring severity (in the form of the IFR), monitoring progress towards a herd immunity
threshold, and predicting the impact of vaccination all depend on a robust estimate of
cumulative incidence of infection. Given evidence that anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies wane below
the detection limit among a substantial portion of the population, we developed an analytical
framework to estimate cumulative incidence of infection from cross-sectional serological
surveys. First, our model was able to capture the observed declines in seroprevalence after the

first wave of COVID-19 in the spring of 2020 in New York City and Connecticut. Second, we
were able to estimate that the cumulative incidence was 26.8% (95% CrI: 24.2-29.7%) in New
York City and 8.8% (95% CrI: 7.1-11.3%) in Connecticut by the end of September 2020, which
was greater than the peak daily seroprevalence of 22.1% (95% CrI: 20.5-23.6%) in mid-May in
New York City and 6.1% (95% CrI: 5.3-7.1%) at the end of May in Connecticut. Cumulative
incidence could be underestimated by cross-sectional serosurveys only a few months after the
first cases of SARS-CoV-2 in a population, because individuals no longer have a detectable
level of antibodies 3-4 months after seroconversion on average. Taken together, our findings
suggest that cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 should not be estimated directly from crosssectional serology data, especially at later stages of an outbreak. Rather, cumulative incidence
should be adjusted given impacts of waning of detectable antibodies in serological assays.
The timeline of seroconversion and seroreversion should ideally be determined by
individual-level longitudinal studies that follow up each infected individual multiple times, as
frequently as possible, for a long enough period to observe seroreversion. The timeline for
seroreversion after SARS-CoV-2 infection reported by the longitudinal studies published to date
varies. Some studies have reported rapid waning of IgG, with substantial attrition of the
seropositive population in as little as 60 days, 7,24 while others reported that antibodies remained
above the detectable threshold for at least 82 days after symptom onset 25 or 120 days after
qPCR diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2.26 These differences are likely due to limitations or
heterogeneity of the studies reported to date, including short follow-up times, small sample
sizes, and different serology testing methods and analytic sensitivities. 27 Most of the longitudinal
studies published to date have followed participants for 14-150 days after symptom onset or
baseline visits, which is not long enough to understand the complete timeline of seroreversion
for all participants, particularly for IgG.7,8,19,20,24,25 The variation in clinical and demographic
characteristics and severity of infection of participants in each study has also likely influenced
these different findings.16,17,20,24,28 Infected individuals with mild or no symptoms who may exhibit

lower titer and shorter time to seroreversion are often not included in these longitudinal studies.
Therefore, assessing the timeline using population-level data, such as cross-sectional serology
data and mortality data, is a viable alternative approach. Using our framework, infected
individuals were estimated to remain seropositive for about 3-4 months on average. The
average duration estimated by the New York City data and Connecticut data were mostly in
agreement, with overlapping credible intervals . Differences in these average durations could be
attributable to differences in demographic and clinical characteristics of infected individuals and
differences in the testing and reporting practices. It is also important to note that the timeline of
seroconversion and seroreversion is dependent on serological assays and targeted
immunoglobulins that may have different thresholds to define seropositivity.
We estimated that the IFR was 1.1% (95% CrI: 1.0-1.2%) in New York City, which was
consistent with estimates from the routine care group at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York
City.29 Yang et al. estimated the time-varying IFR for New York City (1.39%; 95% CrI: 1.041.77),21 matching with our estimate under the assumption of decreasing IFR (1.4% (95% CI:
1.2-1.6%) on average between March and September 2020). Although the sensitivity analyses
did not change our central conclusions, we note that different values of the standard deviation
for time from seroconversion to seroreversion changed the estimated seroprevalence in the
later phase of the study period (August and September 2020; Figure 4 and Figure S2). We ran
the model with standard deviation 20, 50, and 70 days, because the estimated standard
deviation for time from seroconversion to seroreversion for IgA and IgM was approximately 50
and 25 days, respectively.20 Our standard deviation could be larger than those estimated for
small study populations, as we used population-level data that likely have greater variation in
demographic and clinical characteristics. Analyzing seroprevalence data in August and after
could provide critical information on how population-level seroprevalence declines over time and
would enable better estimates of the timeline of antibody waning.

The data used in this study have certain limitations. The samples collected for the CDC
seroprevalence data may not be representative of the general population, as Havers et al.
discussed.6 The data on the date of symptom onset among cases who died in Georgia may be
incorrectly recorded and subject to recall bias as they are largely self-reported. Changes in
testing and reporting practice over time likely affected the number of reported deaths, although
mortality data are less sensitive to these changes compared to case data. We conducted the
sensitivity analysis with a different source of data on time from onset to death and considered
time-varying IFR instead of constant IFR, and found that results were robust to these changes
(Table S2).
Detection of antibodies by serological assays may not correlate to protection from
reinfection or disease, and thus, time from seroconversion to seroreversion estimated in our
study is not necessarily equivalent to the duration of protective immunity. Several studies have
noted strong correlation between results from assays based on antibody binding (such as
ELISA) and neutralization testing,16,20,25 which may allow protective immunity to be inferred from
simpler serologic tests once more comprehensive longitudinal data sets are available.
Moreover, T cell immunity may make an important contribution to protective immunity but is not
assessed by serologic methods.30 Therefore, additional studies are needed to define
immunologic determinants of SARS-CoV-2 protection against reinfection and severe disease.
Our findings suggest that the cumulative incidence estimated from serology data needs
to be adjusted for seroreversion. We intend to apply this framework to other seroprevalence
studies31 and we suggest others conducting serological surveys consider doing so as well. Our
framework could readily be applied to other data to estimate the duration of seroreversion, IFR,
ascertainment ratios, daily seroprevalence, and cumulative incidence.

More details on the population-level cross-sectional seroprevalence data
For New York City, the catchment area covered Manhattan, Bronx, Queens, Kings, and
Nassau Counties in the first round (catchment population: 9.26 million), with Suffolk,
Westchester, and Richmond Counties added in the second, third, and fourth round (total
catchment population: 12.2 million). Because the county-specific serology data were not
available, we assumed that the seroprevalence was similar across the different catchment areas
in the New York City metro area. For Connecticut, the catchment area included all counties in
the state.

More details on the mortality data and case data
The mortality data for New York City covered Bronx, Kings, Manhattan. Queens,
Richmond Counties. The mortality data covered all counties in the state. For Connecticut, we
calculated a 7-day rolling average, because there were no data (i.e., zero deaths reported) on
weekends. For New York City, we used the reported daily counts.
For the number of documented cases (𝑇𝑡 in Equation 3), we used the number of
individuals with positive PCR and/or antigen tests in New York City. In Connecticut, 𝑇𝑡 denotes
the number of total cases (sum of confirmed and probable cases), because confirmed cases
and probable cases were not reported separately before May 31, 2020.

Total number of SARS-CoV-2 infections
To estimate the total number of SARS-CoV-2 infections (𝐼𝑡 ) and the IFR, we first
estimated the date of symptom onset for fatal cases, by fitting gamma, Weibull, and lognormal
distributions to the observed data on time from symptom onset to death for 6,999 COVID-19

associated deaths in Georgia. The best fitted distribution was selected based on goodness-of-fit
tests (Cramer-von Mises, Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Anderson-Darling statistics), using the
fitdistrplus R package.32 Among those who died on day t (𝑑𝑡 ), we calculated the number of
individuals who developed symptoms on day t-k (𝑜𝑡−𝑘 ) as follows:
𝑑𝑡 = ∑∞
𝑘=1 𝑜𝑡−𝑘 × (𝐹𝑘 − 𝐹𝑘−1 ) , 1 ≤ 𝑘 < ∞
where 𝐹 is the cumulative density function of the best fitted distribution for time from onset to
death, conditional upon fatality. We then calculated the total number of infections on day t (𝐼𝑡 )
as follows:
1

𝐼𝑡 = 𝐼𝐹𝑅 × 𝑜𝑡
This framework assumes that the duration of incubation period is approximately equal to the
duration of latent period, and therefore, day t represents the onset of infectiousness for
asymptomatic individuals.

Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis
In the MCMC analysis, we obtained at least 50,000 posterior samples after a burn-in
period of 20,000 iterations. Model convergence was assessed based on trace plots of posterior
samples and the Geweke diagnostic test. We fixed the standard deviation for the Weibull
distribution for time from seroconversion to seroreversion in the analysis, as parameters were
not identifiable otherwise.
