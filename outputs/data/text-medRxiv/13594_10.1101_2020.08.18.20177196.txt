Abstract
Background: To determine how serologic antibody testing outcome links with virus
neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 to ascertain immune protection status, we evaluated a
unique set of individuals for SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection and viral neutralization.
Methods: Herein, we compare several analytic platforms with 15 positive and 30
negative SARS-CoV-2 infected controls followed by viral neutralization assessment. We
then applied these platforms in a clinically relevant population: 114 individuals with
unknown histories of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: In control populations, the best
performing antibody detection assays were SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain
(RBD) IgG (specificity 87%, sensitivity 100%, PPV 100%, NPV 93%), spike IgG3
(specificity 93%, sensitivity 97%, PPV 93%, NPV 97%), and nucleocapsid (NP) protein
IgG (specificity 93%, sensitivity 97%, PPV 93%, NPV 97%). Neutralization of positive
and negative control sera showed 100% agreement. 20 unknown individuals had
detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with 16 demonstrating virus neutralization. The
antibody assays that best predicted virus neutralization were RBD IgG (misidentified 2),
spike IgG3 (misidentified 1), and NP IgG (misidentified 2). Conclusion: These data
suggest that meaningful evaluation of antibody assay performance requires testing in an
unknown population. Further, these results indicate coupling of virus neutralization
analysis to a positive antibody test is required to categorize patients based on SARSCoV-2 immune protection status following virus exposure or vaccine administration.
One of the antibody detection platforms identified in this study followed by the
pseudoneutralization or focus reduction assay would provide a practical testing strategy
to assess for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with optimal prediction of correlates to

Introduction
SARS-CoV-2 has infected millions of people globally but an accurate measure of the
number of individuals with detectable neutralizing antibody titers within local and
national populations remains unclear. Several clinically available serological assays to
detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies have been developed but their utility is hindered by
limited sensitivity and specificity, which is worsened by the low prevalence of individuals
within the population with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies(12, 13). Further, it is not clear how
long neutralizing antibody titers are detectable after acute infection(16, 21). Therefore,
interpretation of antibody results in the clinical setting is difficult such that individuals
with waning antibodies, those without antibodies despite infection, and those with
detectable antibodies but no neutralization activity cannot be identified using single tier
serologic testing. Funding:
For most viral infections, threshold antibody titers have been established that
correlate with protective immunity from symptomatic infection(3, 8, 9). Varicella zoster
virus (VZV) vaccination studies have demonstrated the relationship between
neutralizing antibodies and protection from symptomatic, acute VZV infection or
reinfection(3, 8, 9, 17). Similar knowledge of how humoral immune responses to SARSCoV-2 infection relate to immune protection is developing rapidly, yet many questions
remain. Recent studies of known SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals have demonstrated
that detectable antibody levels are not always associated with viral neutralizing
activity(12, 15, 24). However, there is emerging evidence that mildly symptomatic or

asymptomatic individuals may have no or waning antibody titers over time(16, 21).
However, reinfection with SARS-COV-2 following recovery from initial infection appears
to be a rare event, as the few cases suggesting reinfection appear to be linked with the
presence of residual viral RNA after recovery rather than a second infection with SARSCoV-2(14). Currently the best correlate of immunity is the presence of antibodies to the
receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that track with functional viral
neutralization activity(11). The two-tiered testing approach to determine the presence of
antibodies reactive to SARS-CoV-2 and subsequently, their ability to neutralize the
virus, will provide much needed critical information to parse subjects into practical
categories for future study and clinical interpretation. More importantly, coupling
neutralization to clinical serologic testing will identify those individuals most likely to
have virus neutralizing antibody titers suggesting immunity to SARS-CoV-2.
Additionally, high-throughput interpretable serologic testing is critical for vaccine efficacy
trials that are rapidly advancing and required to prevent future morbidity and mortality
from SARS-CoV-2 infections.
The clinical testing market has been flooded with antibody detection platforms,
displaying variable sensitivity and specificity(12, 13). The rapidity of production and
testing of these platforms has been incredibly impressive but has exposed the high
variability in performance of the different platforms(1, 12, 13, 18, 25). Further, the
majority of testing to date has been completed on known positive and negative control
subjects making interpretation of how each test will perform in random populations
almost impossible. Given the relatively low prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in most
populations and less than ideal specificity of testing platforms, false positives are a

significant problem(2). Platforms also differ in the viral antigens utilized for serologic
testing. The most widely used viral antigens are the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding
domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein, the ectodomain of the spike protein, and
nucleocapsid protein (NP). In conjunction, SARS-CoV-2 serologic tests generally
assess the level of total IgG and/or IgM for antibody determination in an attempt to
capture the time-dependent nature of antibody isotype reactivity; IgM is the first isotype
produced, with IgG detectable at later time points post-infection and also serving as a
marker of immune memory(10, 20). SARS-CoV-2 studies on antibody isotype time to
detection have also been variable including IgG, IgM, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgA in
positive control samples(1, 18, 23-25). While some studies have compared viral
antigens and their reactivity with human antibody subtypes, it is not clear which
combinations offer the most sensitive and specific serologic detection assay and most
importantly, which combination best predicts viral neutralization in real world unknown
subjects(15, 23, 24, 29).
In this study, our goal was to determine a serologic testing strategy least likely to
identify false positives and most predictive of SARS-CoV-2 humoral immunity
regardless of the time from acute infection. Therefore, we took a comprehensive
approach comparing four viral antigens and five human antibody isotype ELISA platform
combinations to determine which approach best predicts neutralizing antibody activity
against SARS-CoV-2. We first assessed ELISA performance in positive and negative
control SARS-CoV-2 infected groups. Subsequently, we tested the platforms
performance in real-world unknown subjects. Lastly, we interpreted the serologic
platforms’ performance in the context of detectable viral neutralization activity.

Results
To evaluate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies and their
neutralization capability, subjects were enrolled from the greater Seattle area for plasma
collection and antibody testing. Positive controls consisted of 15 symptomatic RT-PCR
SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals who were enrolled at least 21 days after the positive
PCR test result. All of the positive controls had mild symptoms and none of the subjects
were hospitalized, Supplemental data file S1. Thirty negative controls were obtained
from a local blood bank as deidentified serum collected prior to December 1, 2019.
Unknown samples consisted of two cohorts: Group A and Group B. Group A includes
14 subjects with known exposure to confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected, symptomatic
individuals; the Group A subjects were never tested by PCR assay for determination of
acute COVID-19 infection. Group B subjects were randomly recruited without
knowledge of previous exposures to confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals.
Subjects were recruited with posted flyers and websites, Supplemental data file S1.
Serum samples were collected from March 26 to April 15, 2020.
Subjects were consented following protocols approved by the UW Institutional
Review Board. Once enrolled in the study, information was collected from each subject
including symptoms, zip code, sex, age, and results of any SARS-CoV-2 testing. Blood
was collected, serum separated, heat inactivated, and stored at -80C.
ELISAs of serum from positive and negative controls were completed using 3
SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens: RBD, spike(26), and full SARS-CoV-2 UV-inactivated viral
particles, Figure 1A. Serial dilutions of each sample generated area under the curve
(AUC) values plotted with associated subject cohorts. Assessment of total IgG antibody

levels for all 3 viral antigens displayed significant, distinct grouping of positive and
negative controls. Antibody assessment by RBD and spike viral antigen ELISAs
demonstrated the best separation between positive and negative controls.
Contrastingly, ELISAs based on inactivated virus displayed the most overlap of
reactivity by both positive and negative control cohorts. Given the comparatively
improved identification of positive control samples by RBD and spike ELISA, unknowns
were tested using these parameters with no further testing with UV-inactivated virus
ELISA. Calculations for sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative
predictive value (NPV), and associated 95% confidence intervals were determined
based on the negative and positive control samples for ELISA platforms, Table 1. RBD
IgG outperformed spike IgG in all measured parameters including specificity, sensitivity,
PPV, and NPV. To assess the unknown samples (Group A and B)(23), a cut-off to
identify samples as antibody-positive was calculated based on the mean plus 3
standard deviations of the negative control samples, designated as a dotted line on
each graph. Unknowns assessed for IgG reactivity against RBD and spike identified 16
and 20 positive samples, respectively. Fifteen of the positive samples were identified by
both platforms.
We next investigated the isotype diversity of the antibody response against
SARS-CoV-2. For the positive and negative control samples collected in this study, IgM
reactivity was decreased compared to IgG for both RBD and spike, Figure 2A.
Comparison of assay performance measures between IgG and IgM assays for RBD and
spike yielded relatively decreased sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV for the IgM
assays, Table 1. Analyses of the unknowns (Group A and B) with the IgM assays

identified fewer positive samples compared to their IgG counterpart. However, all of the
positives that were identified on the IgM assays were also identified on the IgG RBD
and spike assays with one exception. There was one unknown sample identified as
positive on the RBD IgM platform that was not identified on any other ELISA platform.
To further investigate antibody isotype reactivity, all positive controls, negative controls,
and unknowns identified as positive for IgG antibody titers against RBD or spike were
additionally assessed for IgG1, IgG3, and IgA spike specific antibodies, Figure 2B. Of
the antibody isotypes, IgG3 demonstrated the highest specificity and NPV while IgG1
and IgA had superior sensitivity and PPV. Spike IgG3 demonstrated a significantly
better separation for the control samples: p = 0.0007 for IgG3 versus p = 0.02 and p =
0.002 for IgG1 and IgA, respectively. The spike IgG3 platform detected positive
reactivity in 15 of the 20 unknown samples identified as positive by the IgG RBD and
spike platforms.
We also tested our samples using an FDA emergency use authorized ELISA
based on SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (NP) platform (Abbot) to identify NP-specific IgG
responses. The NP IgG platform resulted in similar significant separation of antibodypositive and negative subjects across our cohorts compared to serologic assessment
against RBD IgG, spike IgG, and spike IgG3, p = 0.0001, Figure 2C. The NP IgG
platform demonstrated similar sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV compared to spike
IgG3 and improved specificity compared to both RBD and spike IgG, Table 1. The NP
IgG platform identified 14 unknowns as positive all of which were also identified across
all of the following platforms: RBD IgG, spike IgG, and spike IgG3, Table 1.

Plaque reduction neutralization titer (PRNT) analysis against SARS-CoV2/ WA-1
isolate was used as to assess antibody function via virus neutralization activity, Figure
3. PRNT was performed on the following samples: all positive controls, 10 negative
control samples (including five negatives identified as ‘positive’ on any platform), all
RBD, spike, and NP IgG ‘positive’ unknowns, and 10 unknown samples near the cut-off
but technically ‘negative’ for IgG RBD and spike. This selection of samples ensured
neutralization would be assessed across the breadth of responses from each ELISA
platform. For positive control subjects, we compared PRNT 80% reciprocal dilutions to
ELISA AUC values for the platforms demonstrating the most significant separation of
negative and positive control subjects, Figure 3A. RBD-specific IgG ELISA results
show the highest correlation of the magnitude of ELISA antibody signal to the strength
of neutralization followed by > spike IgG > NP > spike IgG3. We established a cutoff for
identification of samples for positive neutralization: samples had to have detectable
neutralization at both 50% (PRNT50) and 80% (PRNT80) with respective end point
dilution set as 3SD greater than the mean value for negative control samples. Figure
3B demonstrates PRNT80 values in the left panel, with samples meeting the positive
neutralization criteria in the right panel. All of the positive controls, 12 of the 14 Group A
subjects, and 4 of the Group B subjects showed detectable neutralization above the cutoff criteria. Notably, none of the negative controls demonstrated neutralization.
SARS-CoV-2 PRNT results provide key context to interpret ELISA results and
provide functional evidence of viral neutralization. Table 1 summarizes and compares
measures of performance of the tested ELISA platforms on the control and unknown
cohorts with correlation to the PRNT SARS-CoV-2 results. The first 9 rows show

specific evaluations of the testing platforms assessed in this study. Sensitivity,
specificity, PPV, NPV, and R2 measurements are based on the positive and negative
control subjects’ antibody reactivity to each of the ELISA platform assays. Specificity
and NPV are superior for spike IgG3 and NP IgG; therefore, these two platforms will
identify fewer false positive samples compared to RBD and spike IgG. Sensitivity and
PPV are best for RBD IgG, spike IgG1, and spike IgA platforms resulting in less false
negative identifications. However, spike IgG1 and IgA suffer from much lower specificity
and PPV compared to RBD IgG. Linking ELISA and the PRNT data, the R2 correlation
between the magnitude of specific ELISA platform antibody detection and neutralization
strength is highest for RBD and spike IgG. PRNT percent agreement was calculated for
each platform as the number of subjects positive by specific ELISA platforms that were
also positive for neutralization for controls samples and unknowns; RBD IgG and spike
IgG3 had the highest percent agreement with PRNTs across all cohorts. Subject
misidentifications were defined by discordant results between specific ELISA platforms
and neutralization results that were not entirely accounted for by the PRNT percent
agreement calculations. The spike IgG3 platform had the least number of
misidentifications followed by NP IgG and RBD IgG. Sequential ELISA assay testing
platforms have been proposed to increase sensitivity and specificity of SARS-CoV-2
antibody testing(23). Table 2 compares sequential ELISA assays in terms of sensitivity,
specificity, PRNT agreement and PRNT misidentifications. No two sequential ELISA
assays outperformed RBD IgG, spike IgG3, or NP IgG. These results show that
assessment of spike IgG3 antibodies provides the highest accuracy for revealing

serologically positive individuals with neutralizing antibody with NP IgG and RBD IgG
slightly inferior in their ability to predict neutralization in our sample set.
Using neutralization as the key designation of a positive unknown sample, we
estimated the prevalence of individuals in the Seattle area with neutralizing antibodies
against SARS-CoV-2 as of March-April 2020, Figure 4. Panel A is a map of the greater
Seattle area with subjects designated by zip code. The majority of subjects were from
within the city of Seattle. Panel B shows the number of positives identified from group A
and B as well as the positives experiencing symptoms since the time of first
documented human SARS-CoV-2 viral detection: January 21, 2020. Prevalence of
neutralizing antibodies was estimated using a weighted logistic regression model
adjusting for age and sex distributions according to King County census data, Panel C.
The prevalence of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at the time of this study is
estimated at 3.5% with a 95% confidence interval range of 1.3 – 7.3%. Comparison of
exposed and unexposed cohorts shows a highly significant difference in frequency of
detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and reveals that if one has close interactions with
a known infected individual in the absence of any measures to reduce transmission they
are much more likely to develop detectable neutralizing antibodies.
Discussion
Our study shows that a two-tiered testing strategy of ELISA followed by PRNT of
positive ELISA samples is the most accurate and efficient way to assess humoral
immunity to SARS-CoV-2. We completed comprehensive analyses of multiple ELISA
SARS-CoV-2 platforms coupled with the gold standard of viral neutralization testing to
determine a testing strategy that was least likely to identify false positives and most

predictive of SARS-CoV-2 neutralization regardless of the time from acute infection.
Relying on results from a single analysis of testing performance (i.e. a single row in
Table 1) does not provide a comprehensive assessment of the accuracy of the ELISA
platforms. Furthermore, we found that having paired neutralization studies was key to
interpreting results of the ELISAs, particularly when assessing an unknown population.
Three ELISA platforms rise to the top of our list based on our desire for high
specificity and NPV, high PRNT agreement, and low misidentification of subjects with
incongruent ELISA and neutralization results: RBD IgG, spike IgG3, and NP IgG. Spike
IgG3 surpasses RBD IgG because of its superior specificity and therefore a lower
likelihood of false positives as well as its superior prediction of neutralization due to the
lower number of misidentifications compared to RBD IgG. Of note, the R2 for RBD IgG
was relatively higher compared to the lower correlation for spike IgG3. However, this is
challenging to interpret given the finding in other studies with little correlation with RBD
IgG to neutralization (R2 ranging from 0.5 – 0.7) when assessed in larger positive
control groups(24, 28). Our positive controls were all collected around the same time
from infection onset and may explain our observed high correlation. Based on our
results, we conclude that R2 calculations alone are not very informative to assess ELISA
performance for SARS-CoV-2. In assessing unknown populations with our platforms,
we found that despite the higher correlation with PRNT, RBD IgG performed somewhat
less well at predicting neutralization on a patient-by-patient basis as compared to spike
IgG3, which had a comparatively low R2. With the variable reported values of R2 for
RBD and spike platforms, this does not appear to be a dependable measurement of
performance for SARS-CoV-2 ELISA platforms to predict neutralization.

Across the ELISA platforms we investigated, our data supports the use of spikereactive IgG3 as the best initial screening test to predict neutralization but with the
important caveat of our limited sample size. Many of the parameters of test performance
were similar for RBD IgG, spike IgG3, and NP IgG. However, spike IgG3 edged out both
NP and RBD IgG with the ability to predict neutralization (% PRNT agreement and
misidentification columns in Table 1). Expanded studies comparing these three
platforms with larger sample sizes would very beneficial to assess if spike IgG3
continues to outperform the other two platforms. RBD and NP IgG platforms already
have FDA emergency approval, with the NP IgG platform having the highest specificity
and most comprehensive validation(4). Spike IgG3 platforms have not been developed
but represent a highly promising platform for development given the knowledge that
IgG3 isotypes are known as the most effective at viral neutralization compared to other
IgG subtypes(10, 20). The NP IgG assay is likely to be limited in its ability to predict
neutralization due to its localization within the virion: the NP protein is hidden beneath
the viral envelope and it is therefore unlikely to be an effective target for neutralizing
antibodies, unlike the spike proteins(27). However coupling the existing NP IgG Abott
ELISA detection assay with neutralization would be a rapid and practical way to address
this possible issue.
Classic PRNTs are expensive and time-consuming mostly due to laboratory
biosafety requirements. However, PRNTs are currently the most accurate in vitro assay
to functionally assess for the ability of human antibodies to neutralize live virus. Recent
work has demonstrated high correlation between SARS-CoV-2 PRNT assay and focus
reduction (FRNT) assay or neutralization utilizing a fluorescent SARS-CoV-2, which

allows for a high-throughput sample analysis of neutralizing antibodies(19, 24). In
addition, the application of pseudovirus neutralization assays can reduce the barrier to
testing that requires access to biosafety level three facilities(6). In this study, we show
how neutralizing assays serve as a check on the accuracy of antibody screening tests
prone to false positives and negatives. Rapid, significant contributions by scientists
worldwide have produced serologic SARS-CoV-2 data that has been consistent in one
very important way: variability. Our study confirms high variability in serologic assay
platform performance and provides further data that no single serologic assay provides
perfect prediction for viral neutralizing ability. Two-tiered testing would allow parsing of
subjects into groups important for further study (1) those with positive ELISA antibody
detection and confirmed neutralization and (2) those with positive ELISA antibody
detection but no evidence of neutralization. Group 1 would allow tracking of subjects
with known neutralization titers for evidence of reinfection vs. protective immunity.
Group 2 would allow study for increased identification of true false positives vs.
individuals that do not develop functional and/or lasting neutralizing antibodies.
Therefore, a two-tiered testing strategy in which high-throughput neutralization studies
are coupled to serologic assays will provide fully interpretable data to identify subjects
that have truly been infected with SARS-CoV-2, those with protective immunity, and to
assess vaccine efficacy.
Lastly, we wanted to estimate the prevalence of individuals with detectable
SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in the Seattle area. Our samples were drawn in
late March to early April. Our estimate of 3.5% prevalence in the Seattle area is similar
to other published studies on the West Coast(22). Our sample size is quite small and

therefore, unavoidably biased. The CDC reported a prevalence of 1.13% in samples
obtained from the same time frame but their study also suffers from sampling bias(5).
While samples were collected from a much larger catchment area compared to our
study, blood bank donation samples were used rather than random enrollment(5). We
propose that the 95% confidence interval range found in this study is perhaps a better
representative of the true prevalence in our community (1.3 – 7.3%) rather than one
specific value.
To our knowledge this is the first study to comprehensively assess serologic
assay performance in an unknown cohort in addition to negative and positive controls in
order to determine a practical and accurate method to determine the presence of
SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. By coupling ELISA with virus neutralization
assessment, we were able to determine the accuracy of testing based on the key
functional outcome of viral neutralization. Pseudoneutralization or FRNT assays provide
a comparable test of neutralization to PRNTs and could be rapidly developed with a
new spike IgG3 or existing NP IgG ELISA platform for two-tiered testing(6, 19, 24). Our
study provides compelling evidence that a two-tiered neutralization-dependent testing
scheme is required to correctly identify and categorize individuals with and without
detectable neutralization to study the range of antibody responses to infection, the
correlate to protective immunity, and vaccine efficacy.

specific viral antigen and antibody combinations. UV-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 did not
demonstrate binding. Following a 2hr incubation and washes, the following anti-human
secondary antibodies conjugated to HRP were diluted 1:3000 and added to plates: IgG
(Thermofisher 31410), IgG1 (Southern Biotech 9054), IgG3 (Southern Biotech 9210),
IgM (Sigma A6907), IgA (Sigma A0295). Following a 1hr incubation and washes,
SigmaFast OPD was added to plates. Ten minutes later, 2M H2SO4 was added to all
wells to stop the reaction and plates were immediately read at an absorbance of 490nm
(BioTek Epoch). OD values for each sample dilution were plotted and the area under
the curve (AUC) was calculated using Prism.
PRNT Assay. PRNT assays were performed as previously described (7). Briefly, fourfold serial dilutions of heat inactivated plasma was mixed 1:1 with 600 PFU/ml SARSCoV-2 WA-1 (BEI resources) in DPBS (Fisher Scientific) + 0.3% cold water fish skin
gelatin (Sigma G7041) and incubated for 30 min at 37 degrees. The virus plasma
mixture was then added in duplicate, along with virus only and mock controls, to Vero
cells (ATCC) in a 12-well plate and incubated for 1hr at 37 degrees. Following
adsorption, plates were washed once with DPBS and overlayed with a 1:1 mixture of
2.4% Avicel RC-591 (FMC) + 2 x MEM (ThermoFisher) supplemented with 4% heatinactivated FBS and Penicillin/Streptomycin (Fisher Scientific). Plates were then
incubated for 2 days at 37 degrees. Following incubation, overlay was removed and
plates were washed once with DPBS and fixed in 10% formaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) in
DPBS for 30 minutes at room temp. Plates were washed again with DPBS and stained
with 1% crystal violet (Sigma-Aldrich) in 20% EtOH (Fisher Scientific). Plaques were
enumerated and percent neutralization was calculated as 100 minus the number of
plaques in serum + virus dilution wells divided by the number of plaques in virus only
control wells times 100. PRNT50 and PRNT80 values are shown as inverse serum
dilution and were determined by calculating the 50% and 80% sigmoidal interpolation of
the percent neutralization of the samples in Prism. R2 values were determined using a
nonlinear regression fit in Prism.
University of Washington NP Assay. Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG Testing Serum samples
were run on the Abbott Architect instrument using the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay
after FDA notification following manufacturer’s instructions. The assay is a
chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay for qualitative detection of IgG in human
serum or plasma against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein. The Architect requires a
minimum of 100µL of serum or plasma. Qualitative results and index values reported by
the instrument were used in analysis. Values >/= 1.4 is considered a positive result.

Statistics. Prevalence Estimate: We first compare the age and sex distributions of the
100 unexposed unknown subjects and the age and sex distributions of the greater
Seattle area from the U.S. Census estimates from 2014-2018. By using the Pearson’s
chi-square test for sex and Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test for age, we found significant
differences for sex and age distribution between the unexposed subjects and the
greater Seattle area. Looking at the histogram, there are more old people and less
young people in the subjects comparing to people in Seattle area.
Therefore, we adjust this oversampling and under-sampling by constructing weights for
age brackets and sex designations. We construct weights by taking the ratio of the
proportion of the Seattle area versus the sample proportion. A logistic regression using
the weight adjustments for sex and age was then conducted to calculate a prevalence
estimate and the associated 95% confidence interval. As a result, the model gives a
point estimate for the prevalence of 3.5% with a 95% confidence interval from 1.3% to
7.3%.
Comparison testing of Group A and Group B: We use the Fisher’s exact test to compare
the rate of positive neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 between the exposed
and unexposed groups. The p-value of the Fisher exact test is less than 10-5, which is
statistically significant. The estimated difference of the rate between two groups is -0.89
with a 95% confidence interval of (-0.97, -0.66), while it should be noted that the rates
are between 0 and 1. Therefore, we can see that the rates between the two exposure
groups are very different. Further specifics are included in supplemental data file 2, S2.
Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and associated confidence intervals: The values for
sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV for the ELISA platforms and PRNT were
calculated using the positive and negative controls as reference samples. Prism
software contingency tables were used to calculate the specific values and 95%
confidence intervals. Fisher’s exact test computed p-values and significance. The 95%
confidence intervals were calculated using the hybrid Wilson/Brown method.
Human participants. The institutional review board at the University of Washington
reviewed and approved our human subjects study prior to enrollment of any subjects.
Subjects were provided with information about the study, risks associated, and how
their privacy would be protected. To enroll in the study each subject was required to
provide verbal understanding and written consent. The IRB approved all recruitment
and consent forms prior to the beginning of the study.
