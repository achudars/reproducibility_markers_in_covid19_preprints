Abstract
Background: The COVID-19 pandemic and governmental lockdown measures disproportionally
impacts older adults. This study presents the results from a psychiatric helpline for older adults in
Mannheim, Germany, during the lockdown, set up to provide information and psychosocial
support measures. We aim to elucidate the needs of older adults, their reported changes and the
psychological impact during the initial stages of the health crisis.
Methods: 55 older adults called the psychiatric helpline between April and June 2020.
Information on demographics, previous diagnosis of psychiatric and somatic diseases as well as
changes in daily life due to the pandemic was collected anonymously. Current mental health
status was assessed using the depression HAMD-7 and the anxiety HAM-A scales.
Results: Most callers were women, older adults (M = 74.69 years), single and retired. 69% of
callers reported new or an increase in psychiatric symptoms, with anxiety and depressive
symptoms being the most common ones. Age was significantly negatively correlated to higher
levels of anxiety and depression symptoms. Individuals with a previous diagnosis of a psychiatric
disease reported significantly higher levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms than those
without a diagnosis.
Conclusion: In older adults, the perceived psychological impact of the COVID-19 crisis appears
to ameliorate with age. Individuals with a history of psychiatric disease are most vulnerable to
negative mental health outcomes. Rapid response in the form of a geriatric helpline are useful
initiatives to support the needs and the psychological well-being of older adults during a health
crisis.
Key words: hotline, quarantine, psychological impact, anxiety, depression

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an unpreceded disruption of daily life around the
world. Older adults over the age of 65 are considered being at higher risk of severe complications
and mortality from COVID-19, and thus are disproportionally impacted (Grasselli et al., 2020;
Jordan et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). Worldwide governmental viruscontainment-efforts include a variety of measures from social distancing to stay-at-home orders.
The disruption of daily life through new imposed measures that increase isolation may have a
stronger impact in older adults, which could in turn have deleterious effects on their mental
health and well-being. Research focusing on the implications and effects of the COVID-19
pandemic and efforts that address the needs of older adults remain very limited.
Evidence is rising that mental health effects of the political measures for social distancing
and isolation in older adults should not be neglected (Xiang et al., 2020). Previous literature
shows that social isolation in older adults has been associated with increased depression and
suicidality as well as psychoendocrine, metabolic and decreased immunological response (Steven
W. Cole et al., 2015; Steve W. Cole et al., 2007; Santini et al., 2020). Several recent studies from
different countries investigated the psychological impact of COVID-10 on mental health,
(Rodriguez-Rey et al, Benke et al, 2020, (Luo et al., 2020) with a few focusing specifically in
older adults ((Davies, 2020), (Meng et al., 2020). Their findings suggest that older adults
experienced depression and anxiety, with older women experiencing more symptoms than older
men (Meng et al., 2020). Social impact and attitudes also differ among older adults. A majority of
older adults were worried about the future, feeling stress and anxiety. Younger older adults in
their 60s were least optimistic the outcome and the duration of the pandemic than those aged 70
and older (Davies, 2020). Conversely, a meta-analysis using data from 27 countries found that

older adults are not more willing to stricter adhere to new rules of social distancing and selfprotection than other age groups (Daoust, 2020).
As daily infections increased globally in March, Germany started to implemented public
health regulations. From March 22 until April 19, 2020 German states implemented “lock-down”
restriction measures (e.g. stay-at home orders, closure of non-essential shops, minimum distance
of 1.5 m to others, restriction to visits clinics and nursing homes and decreased social contact).
During this initial wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany we initiated a geriatric helpline
to address and ameliorate the negative impact of the health crisis among older adults. The aim
was to 1) provide information about COVID-19 and protective measurements, 2) issue practical
help in case of problems with daily living and 3) provide medical expertise and psychological
support for psychiatric symptoms. Furthermore, we established the helpline to assess the mental
health impact in the aging population in real time, in order to minimize and ameliorate the
adverse impact. In this ongoing project, we have analyzed a first cohort of participants from this
helpline, to better understand the effect of the pandemic and of local lockdown measures on
mental health-related issues in older adults. We provide demographic data, the impact of daily
living and social interactions, as well as associations between sociodemographic variables and
mental health status
Methods
Establishment of a Covid-19 hotline
3 weeks after the first enforced shut-down measurements in Germany, the geriatric helpline went
live on April 13th, we established a COVID-19 helpline for older adults (>65 years old) at the
Central Institute of Mental Health, Mannheim (CIMH), University of Heidelberg. The CIMH is
the only psychiatric institution in the city of Mannheim, and provides full sectorized care for

older adults (20% of 300,000 inhabitants). The goal of the hotline was to provide (1) information
about the Covid-19 virus and education of meaningful rules of conduct, (2) psychiatric and
psychological counseling, (3) acute psychotherapeutic interventions, (4) psychosocial support for
a better daily structure of during the quarantine, (5) information of local care providers for
assistance with daily living activities. Before the establishment of the helpline, information on
local care providers for older adults (e.g. support on groceries shopping and other errands) from
different organizations (governmental and non-governmental) was collected. Three psychiatrists
and three psychologists from the gerontopsychiatry department and the memory clinic (with
specialization in diagnosis and treatment of geriatric depression, anxiety and dementia) hosted the
hotline. The hotline was announced in several local newspapers, radio stations as well advertised
on the homepage of the city of Mannheim.
Callers could anonymously tell their needs and received advice, and calls were not recorded.
However, callers were initially told that the information provided would be documented
anonymously and further analyzed in a scientific manner. Verbal consent was acquired. We
received 53 calls within a radius of 50-70km around Mannheim and two calls a longer way off
(>100km).
A paper-based survey was developed to assess demographic information, previous diagnosis of
psychiatric diseases, current psychiatric treatment or psychotherapy experience, somatic diseases,
number of medications taken, new or increase of psychiatric symptoms, number of daily social
interactions before the pandemic and during the pandemic, living and financial situation and
requirements of daily support by others. The Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) was used to
assess the age- comorbidity of somatic disease (Charlson et al., 1994). Mental health status was
systematically assessed using the Hamilton depression and Hamilton anxiety scores.

Mental Health Status
Depression
The 7-Item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-7) (McIntyre et al., 2002) is commonly
used in clinical and research setting to evaluate the presence and severity of depression
symptoms. Seven items are assessed in a semi-structure interview to asses: depressed mood,
guilt, anhedonia, psychic anxiety, loss of energy (fatigue), somatic anxiety and suicidal ideation.
The cutoffs for the different levels of depressive symptoms were set according to McIntyre:
Scoring below 4 indicated no depressive symptoms (level I). A score of 4-11 was considered as
mild (level II), a score of 12-20 as moderate (level III) and a score >20 as severe depression
(level IV).

Anxiety
The Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) 14-Item version was used to asses and quantify
the presence and severity of anxiety symptoms (Hamilton, 1959). The commonly used 14-Items
version, as a clinician-rated semi-structured interview was used. Higher scores indicated greater
anxiety symptoms severity (Katherine Shear et al., 2001). According to (Hamilton, 1959) a score
of <17 indicates none to mild levels of anxiety (level I), a score of 18-24 moderate (level II), a
score of 25-30 moderate to severe (level III) and a score >30 severe levels (level IV) of anxiety.

Data analysis
Data was entered into electronic records for further analysis. Statistical analysis was performed
with SPSS Version 24. The descriptive statistics of the sample were computed for the
sociodemographics characteristics, consisting of frequencies and percentages for categorical
values and mean and standard deviations (SD) for scale variables. For the mental health variables

(anxiety and depression), skewness and kurtosis values were obtained and the Shaprio-Wilk Test
was performed to assess normal distribution (unimodal, skewness<1; Supplementary table 1).
Bivariate associations between mental health variables and age (continuous variable) were
assessed via Pearson’s correlation coefficient r. Significant differences in mean level of mental
health variables between categories of dichotomous sociodemographic variables were assessed
via t-test. The associations between mental health variables and sociodemographic variables were
assessed in the following groups: by living status (alone vs not), previous psychiatric diagnosis
(yes no), current intake of psychopharmacological drugs, high risk for COVID-due to
comorbidities, and high frequency of social contact (>6 social contacts per week vs less than 6).

Ethics approval and consent to participate
Informed consent was obtained from the subjects when calling our hotline to use data collected
during the call for scientific purposes according to the statues of the ethics commission of the
Faculty of Behavioral and Cultural studies at the University of Heidelberg. Written consent could
not be received as this was an anonymous hotline. We have presented the study design and data
acquisition to members of the ethics committee II at the medical faculty Mannheim, University of
Heidelberg. Ethical approval was waived due to the anonymous design of the hotline.
Results
A total of 55 older adults called the COVID-19 Psychiatric hotline for older adults during the
initial stage of the pandemic (April 13- June 15). We received a higher frequency of numbers of
calls during the initial peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany in April 2020 compared to
end of May and June, 2020 (Fig 1A). The reasons for calling the hotline varied, with most
reported reasons being: general information about corona (60.7%), requesting health and

psychological problems (32.1%), psychiatric consultation (26.8%), loneliness (21.4%) or
requesting help with problems of daily function (7.1 %) (Fig 1B). The average duration of each
call was 39.56 mins (SD = 22.93, range 9-120 mins).

I Demographics
53 respondents completed the full survey. Sociodemographic characteristics are presented in
Fig.1C. Most callers were women (85.5%), older adults (Age M = 74.69 SD = 8.32; range 59-98),
single (50.0%) living in a city (76.9%) and retired (90.0%). Almost half or the callers were living
alone (49.0%), with the rest either living with their spouse or partner (40.8 %) or with their
children (12.2%) and one caller was living in a care home.

Medical History
46 (88%) callers reported known co-morbidities, with cardiovascular, (N=24, 35%) chronic lung
disease, (N=14, 20%) Diabetes, (N=8, 12%) current of previously diagnosis of cancer (N=12
18%) and neurological diseases (N=10, 15%) among the most common comorbidities (Table 1).
The average Charlson Comborbidity Index (CCI) score was 4.02 (SD = 1.52; range 0-11). 45% of
respondents (N =23) were considered at high risk for COVID-19 based on their comorbidities of
either COPD, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. In terms of medication intake, 37% were
prescribed with antihypertensive or heart drugs versus 12% of diabetes or COPD 20%
medication. Most callers (72%) took more than one medication daily (Table 1).

Psychiatric and psychotherapy experience
38.5% of the callers were pre-diagnosed with a psychiatric disease, out of which, depression
(32%) and anxiety disorders (7.7%) were the most common diagnosis. Out of 52 respondents,
21% were currently seeing a psychiatric for treatment and 31% of callers received psychotropic
drugs (Table 1). The majority of callers had no previous psychotherapy experience (67.3%) and
11.5% of callers had had continuous psychotherapy over years (Table 1).

II Changes in daily life and social interaction
As expected, 52.8% of callers reported a decrease in their social contact since the COVID-19
crisis started, with 56.6 % having less conversations with contacts and 79.2% reported less visits
from others, while only 5.7% of the callers reported an unclear support of daily living due to the
COVID-19 crisis (Figure 2A).

Significant Changes in daily life
When asked about their significant changes in daily life, 25% reported social isolation as a
current problem in their daily life, while 9.6% reported problems accessing or shopping for
groceries. Only one or two callers announced issues with personal hygiene or mobility (Figure
2A). New financial difficulties due to the Covid-19 crisis did not arise for most of the callers
(89.8 %, Figure 2A).

Numbers and kind of social interactions change
Although interactions with the spouse and partners did not change because of social restriction in
the initial peak of the Covid-19 pandemic, callers reported to have less direct, personal contact

with all other relatives such as children, grandchildren, parents or siblings (Figure 2B). Before the
Corona crisis 42% of callers had over 10 social interactions per week, which during the lockdown
decreased to 1.8%. During the lockdown, the most common of number interactions per week was
reduced to 2-5 per week (42.6%) and 0-1 (31%) (Figure 2C).

III New Psychiatric Symptoms due to COVID-19
Over 69% of callers reported new or an increase in psychiatric symptoms during this time (Figure
3A) with anxiety (47.2%), depressed mood (56.%), sleep disturbances (30.2%), anhedonia
(32.1%), restlessness/agitation (22.6%), changes in cognition (concentration difficulties) (15.4%)
and suicidal thoughts (15.1%) among the most common reported symptoms.
Loss of therapeutic resources
Around 5 % of callers reported loss access to therapeutic resources (ambulatory psychotherapy,
self-help group and church meetings), while 13.2% of callers reported a loss of weekly activities
through sports clubs or cultural associations (Figure 3A).

Mental Health Status
Depression
Symptomatic of depression, as assessed by the HAM-D7 score showed a mean score of 7.23 (SD
= 5.77 ; range 0-20, Figure 3B, Supplementary Table 1). Regarding the subscales, the most
reported symptoms were restlessness (M= 1.7), depressed mood (M =1.45) and anhedonia or loss
of interest (M=1.14, Figure 3B). A total of 19 (42.2 %) were considered to have mild levels of
depressive symptoms (Score 4-11); 11 (24.4%) showed moderate levels (score 12-20) while we
did not find participants with severe depressive symptoms (score >20 according to (McIntyre et

al., 2002), Figure 3D). A third of participants did not report depressive symptoms (score <4,
Figure 3D).

Anxiety
A total of 35 participants completed the anxiety scale measured by the HAM-A and showed a
mean score of 14.03 (SD =8.45; range 0-29, Figure 3C, Supplementary Table 1). The most
reported symptoms were tension, depressed mood, anxious mood, fear, insomnia, and somatic
muscular symptoms. Assessing the different anxiety levels as described (Hamilton, 1959), 60.0%
of callers were considered to have mild levels of anxiety, (score <17, Figure 3D); 28.6% (N=10,
score= 18-24) showed moderate and 11.4% (N=4, score= 25-30) moderate to severe levels of
anxiety. No participants revealed severe anxiety symptoms (score>30, Figure 3D).

III Associations between demographics variables, social changes and mental health status
during the pandemic
Age was significantly negatively correlated to higher levels of anxiety (r = -.340 p =.045) and
depression symptoms (r = -.293 p =.054, Table 2), showing that older individuals report less
symptoms. Individuals pre-diagnosed with a psychiatric disease reported significantly higher
levels of depressive (t(42) = 3.33, p = .001) and anxiety symptoms (t(33) = 4.00, p > 0.001) than
those without a diagnosis. Likewise, those individuals who were currently taking
psychopharmaceutical medication also reported significantly higher depressive (t(39) = 3.33, p =
.002) and anxiety symptoms (t(31) = 2.97, p = .006). Individuals that lived alone reported
significantly lower levels of symptoms of anxiety (t(33) = -.2.57, p = .015), with no differences
reported for depression symptoms ( p = .017, Table 2). There were no significant differences in

depression or anxiety symptoms for individuals who were either considered at high risk for
COVID-19 due to high co-morbidities, nor those engaging in frequent social contact.

Help Provided
For almost two third of the callers (58.8%) we provided information of Covid-19 and
recommended measurements to protect one-self (Supplementary Table 1). In 7 cases (13.7%) we
were also asked for our professional estimation of a somatic comorbidity and referred to a doctor
with the suitable specialization. For 29.4% (N=15) we recommended psychiatric counseling.
Most callers (56.9%) required on open ear for the current situation and sorrows and reported of
feeling significant relieved because of our psychological support. In rare cases we also provided
practical help for daily living, social contacts and contact to welfare work (Supplementary Table
2).
In three quarters (74.5%) of all calls no subsequent treatment was required. However, for three
participants (5.9%) we provided further psychiatric counseling in form of further psychiatric
diagnostics and treatment. 7 callers (13.7%) received repetitive psychotherapeutic support with
up to 6 subsequent telephone appointments. In one case (1.9%) we also called in our social
worker (Supplementary Table 2).
Discussion
As governments grapple with combatting the COVID-19 pandemic by implementing renewed
restriction measures, our study elucidates the needs of older adults and the psychological impact
during the initial stages of the health crisis. The long-lasting psychological consequences from
this pandemic are largely unknown. However, our results from the geriatric helpline, help fill the

gap by providing insight in to the timely efforts which mental health institutions can implement
to cater specifically to older adults.
Our results showed that most callers where in need of general information about COVID
measures, however a significant portion required help with psychosocial problems such as
loneliness, daily functioning, and new psychiatric symptoms namely anxiety and depressed
mood. The length of the calls implies the resources and level of involvement needed per caller.
The frequency of the calls at the beginning, and after changes in the restriction measures,
highlight the unclarity of the restriction measures and the need for further clarification from the
authorities.
Our helpline was able to rapidly respond to the specialized psychosocial needs during the crisis.
Our specified support, in particular psychiatric counseling and therapeutic talks, highlight the
urgency to ameliorate the mental health impact of the COVID-19 in real time among older adults.
One third of callers were recommend psychiatric counseling, while 13% of callers were in need
and given continuous psychotherapeutic support. In a time where most mental health centers
were closed and ambulatory therapy reduced their activity due to the lockdown measures, our
results corroborates the need for the quick adaptation of mental health services and institutions.
Ensuring continuity of psychiatric support and easy access to geriatric mental health care in the
absence of standard practices are essential to mitigating negative mental health outcomes.
Older age is considered an important risk factor for COVID-19, where older adults are
disproportionately negatively impacted. However, our results reveal that the psychological
impact appears to ameliorate with age, with older adults reporting less symptoms of anxiety and
depression. This is consistent with recent results and previous literature which identifies older age
as a protective factor in dealing with disasters or crisis (Klaiber et al., 2020; Rodríguez-Rey et al.,
2020). In the context of COVID, older adults showed better emotional well-being and were less

reactive to COVID stressors than younger adults (Klaiber et al., 2020). Similarly, an initial study
in China revealed that young individuals were at higher risk of suffering from anxiety than older
adults during the outbreak (Huang & Zhao, 2020). In line with disaster crisis literature, older
victims previously show lower anxiety, stress, and depression symptoms than younger
individuals(Ngo, 2001) with researchers attributing this to their greater life experience, crisis
exposure or by having to face fewer life responsibilities and life experience (Luchetti et al.,
2020). Further studies should explore longitudinally this protective effect of age and its
consequences in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The majority of our callers reported either new or an increase of psychiatric symptoms. This
highlights the psychological impact of COVID-19 among older adults population and supports
the need for targeted psychological intervention strategies for seniors. Our results show that those
individuals pre-diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder and those taking psychotrophic medication,
reported higher anxiety and depressive symptoms than those without. Our findings add to the
growing body of emerging literature which indicates that individuals with current and or past
psychiatric disorders may be particularly vulnerable to the negative psychological sequalae of the
pandemic(Benke et al., 2020; Guessoum et al., 2020; Meng et al., 2020). In contrast, individuals
that were considered at higher risk for COVID-19 due to their somatic comorbidities did not
report significantly higher levels of anxiety or depressive symptoms. This finding suggests that
unlike psychiatric comorbidities, somatic comorbidities may not play a significant role on mental
health outcomes in older adults. However, this should be further studied in larger samples.
In accordance to other studies across Europe, most callers have experienced changes in their daily
life, with social isolation being considered a problem in a quarter of callers (Benke et al., 2020;
Rodríguez-Rey et al., 2020). Interestingly, our results show that living alone proved to be a
protective factor against anxiety symptoms, as individuals cohabitating with others reported

higher levels of anxiety. This is in contrast with previous findings from general population
surveys, which find cohabitation to be a protective factor against psychological suffering and
negative mental health outcomes (Benke et al., 2020; Rodríguez-Rey et al., 2020). Contrary to
expectations, our data reveals that older individuals living alone were less anxious and thus coped
better. Older individuals living alone were perhaps better able to cope with the social distancing
rules or “stay-at home” orders since they were more used to living alone for longer. Given the
scarce and mixed evidence to this date, this possible psychosocial resilience factor merits further
attention, specifically in older adults.
The limitations of this study should be considered when interpreting the findings. First, this data
was collected during the initial stages of the pandemic. Concerns, daily experiences and mental
health outcome may change and evolve as the outbreak evolves. Second, our sample was limited,
as advertised, to cater to older adults over the age of 65, therefore age-related associations and
differences must be treated with caution. Finally, our sample may not generalize to other
populations as it is entirely subject to individual’s motivation to call the helpline.

Conclusion
The present study elucidated the specific needs of older individuals through the implementation
of a geriatric helpline. The rapid adaptation of mental health institution’s resources through such
initiatives are necessary to support psychosocial needs and psychological well-being of older
adults during a health crisis. Considering the pandemic will most likely have lasting effect,
ongoing help initiatives and follow-up studies are warranted to mitigate negative health outcomes
in the vulnerable population.

Tables and Figure legends
Table 1. Demographic and clinical characteristics assessing medical history, previous psychiatric
and psychotherapy treatment and experience. Total N represents the number of callers which
answered the question. N represents the number of callers which affirmed the features asked. The
percentage was calculated as (N/total N)*100.

Table 2. Associations between sociodemographic variables and mental health status . Differences
in mean levels between categories were assessed via t-test. Individuals living alone reported
higher anxiety symptoms than those living with others. Individuals with a pre-diagnosed
psychiatric disorder reported more anxiety and depressive symptoms than callers without. Callers
currently taking psychotrophic drugs reported significantly more depressive and anxiety
symptoms. There were no difference among those at higher risk for COVID-19 or those engaging
in frequent social interactions. Age was negatively correlated with higher levels of depressive and
anxiety symptoms.

COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown measures. (B) While the social interaction to the partner
remained stable, callers reported less social interactions with all other relatives (including
children, grandchildren, parents and siblings) during the crisis. (C) The number of social
interactions also decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic, while most participants had >10
social interactions in person per week before COVID-19, most callers reported a decrease of all
personal social interactions of 2-5/week during the lockdown measures.

(33.3%) showed no depressive symptoms (I), versus 42.2% with mild levels (II), versus 24.4%

versus 28.6% with moderate (II) and 11.4% with moderate to severe (III) levels of anxiety. We
neither found severe (level IV) depressive nor anxious symptoms among the participants.
