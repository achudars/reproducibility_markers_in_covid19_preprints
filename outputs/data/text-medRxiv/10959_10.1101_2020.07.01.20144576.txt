ABSTRACT
Emergency Use Authorization for remdesivir months after discovery of COVID-19 is
unprecedented. Typically, decades of research and public-sector funding are required to
establish the mature body of foundational research requisite for efficient, targeted drug
discovery and development. This work quantifies the body of research related to remdesivir’s
biological target, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), or parent chemical structure,
nucleoside analogs (NcAn), through 2019, as well as NIH funding for this research 2000–2019.
There were 6,567 RdRp-related publications in PubMed, including 1,263 with NIH support, and
11,073 NcAn-related publications, including 2,319 with NIH support. NIH support for RdRp
research comprised 2,203 Project Years with Costs of $1,875 million. NIH support for NcAn
research comprised 4,607 Project Years with Costs of $4,612 million. Research Project grants
accounted for 63% and 48% of Project Years for RdRp and NcAn respectively, but only 19% and
12% of Project Costs. Analytical modeling of research maturation estimates that RdRp and NcAn

research passed an established maturity threshold in 2008 and 1994 respectively. Of 97
investigational compounds targeting RdRp since 1989, the three authorized for use entered
clinical trials after both thresholds. This work demonstrates the scale of foundational research
on the biological target and parent chemical structure of remdesivir that supported its
discovery and development for COVID-19. This work identifies $6.5 billion in NIH funding for
research leading to remdesivir, underscoring the role of public sector investments in basic
research and research infrastructure that underlie new drugs and the response to emergent
disease.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT

Emergency Use Authorization of remdesivir for treating COVID-19 four months after discovery
of this virus was enabled by decades of research on the drug’s biological target as well as other
medicines with related chemical structures. The NIH contributed 6,800 years of grant funding to
this research, totaling $6.5 billion (2000–2019), including funding for both investigator-initiated
research and research infrastructure. Of this, $46.5 million was for research directly related to
remdesivir. This analysis demonstrates the importance of a robust body of foundational
research in responding rapidly to emergent diseases, and the substantial NIH contribution to
this research. It also underscores the scale and significance of the public-sector investments
that enable new drug discovery and development.

The Emergency Use Authorization of remdesivir for treating SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19)(1)
four months after the discovery of this pathogen is unprecedented. Typically, decades are
required to translate research evidence into clinical practice or approved products.(2) For
example, a study characterizing the research and development timelines of 113 first-in-class
drugs approved from 1999–2013 described a median 20-year lag between the initial
identification of a drug target, pathway, or chemotype, and first drug approval.(3) Similarly,
studies with an analytical model of research maturation estimated the time from initiation of
research related to a novel drug target to first approval of a drug against that target was more
than 30 years.(4, 5) While efforts to reduce this translational lag commonly focus on the length
of time required for clinical trials and regulatory review,(6) evidence suggests the longer, ratelimiting step is the time required for the basic research required to establish the requisite
scientific foundation for successful development.(3-5, 7, 8)
Basic research is funded primarily by the public sector.(9) Previous studies have shown
that NIH funding contributed to published research underlying every new drug approved from
2010–2016, with >90% of this funding representing basic research on the biological target,
rather than applied research on the drugs themselves.(10, 11) These studies also show that this
research often involves substantial spillover effects, in which research performed in various
therapeutic areas contributes to the scientific foundation for products in another area.(12)
Research on strategic product development in different fields of technology has
identified predictable patterns in the advance of science or technology. These studies also
demonstrate the enabling role for a mature foundation of research and technology readiness in
successful product development.(13, 14) The same pattern is evident in biomedical research

and targeted drug development. Analytical modeling demonstrates that few targeted
therapeutics are successfully developed until foundational research on both the biological
target and the nature of the molecular entity passes a defined established point.(4, 5, 8, 15)
This work examines the body of research on remdesivir’s biological target, RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and its parent chemical structure, nucleoside analogs
(NcAn). Specifically, we quantify the number of research publications in these two areas, model
the advance of this research and thresholds of maturation, describe the number of
investigational products targeted to RdRp and timelines of development for the three RdRp
inhibitors currently in clinical use, and detail the NIH investments made in this research.
Collectively, these data describe the foundational research, and NIH investment in this
research, that enabled rapid development of remdesivir in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
These results are considered in the context of intense societal debate over the potential
pricing of remdesivir by its manufacturer, Gilead Sciences.(16-18) One aspect of this debate
concerns investments made by the public sector in the early development of this drug and its
subsequent application to COVID-19.(19, 20) This work provides an estimate of the NIH
contribution to remdesivir through the end of 2019 by considering the foundational research
that enabled the discovery and development of this product as well as the NIH contribution to
this work.

RESULTS

Publications on Remdesivir’s Target and Chemical Type. PubMed searches using optimized
search terms (Supplemental Table 1) identified 6,567 PubMed Identifiers (PMID) related to
RdRp and 11,073 PMID related to NcAn (Table 1). Research on RdRp originated in the 1950s,
grew exponentially from the 1980s, and has been level from 2011 to the present (Figure 1A).
Research on NcAn also dates from the 1950s, increased exponentially beginning in the 1980s in
conjunction with the emergence of HIV, and has been decreasing slightly from the late 1990s to
the present (Figure 1B).
NIH Funding for Published Research. NIH funding was associated with 1,263 (19%) of
publications on RdRp and 2,319 (21%) of publications on NcAn (Table 1). For both RdRp and
NcAn, the fraction of publications with NIH support decreased steadily from >30% prior to 1990
to 13–16% after 2015 (Figure 1A, 1B).
NIH support for RdRp research comprised 2,203 Project Years of funding totaling $1,875
million (Table 1, Figure 1C). While Research Projects represented the largest fraction of Project
Years since 2000 (63%) and had Costs of $351.7 million, Research Projects represented only
19% of total Costs, less than the $478 million in Research Program Projects (26%) or $553.9
million in Cooperative Agreements (30%) (Table 1). NIH support for RdRp research increased
steadily from the 1980s, and decreased from 2012–2019 (Figure 1D).
NIH support for NcAn research comprised 4,607 Project Years of funding totaling $4.6
billion (Table 1). While Research Projects represented the largest fraction of Project Years (48%)
and had Costs of $537 million, Research Projects represented only 12% of total Costs, less than

the $1.56 billion for Research Program Projects and Centers (34%) or $1.9 billion in Cooperative
Agreements (40%) (Table 1). NIH support for NcAn research increased up to 2000 and remained
stable through 2019 (Figure 1D).
Topic Focus of NIH-Funded RdRp and NcAn Research. The large majority of NIH-funded
publications on RdRp (89%) mentioned the term virus or viral, with the majority accounted for
by research related to Hepatitis, influenza, Coronavirus, Zika, and Ebola virus (Figure 2A), while
19% contained the wild card term “immun*” and 1.3% mentioned cancer. The timeline of
research involving various RNA viruses can be viewed through an interactive graphic online.
(Note to Editor: hyperlink to: https://bit.ly/RdRpRemdesivir)
Of the NIH-funded publications related to NcAn, only 49% mentioned the term virus or
viral (Figure 2B), 28% contained the wild card term “immun*” and 15% were related to cancer.
The most commonly mentioned viruses were HIV, Hepatitis, Coronavirus, influenza, and Zika
virus, respectively. Funding for influenza and Coronavirus was sporadic. Funding for Zika
research rose following the 2015-16 outbreak.
Maturation of RdRp and NcAn Research and Timing of Drug Approvals. The Technology
Innovation Maturation Evaluation (TIME) model quantifies the growth of a corpus of published
literature as well as inflection points related to research maturation. The calculated initiation
point, or point of maximum acceleration of publication activity, corresponds to the time of early
discoveries that lead to exponential growth in research activity. The calculated established
point, or point of maximum slowing of publication activity, corresponds to a time before which
targeted therapeutics are successfully developed.(4, 8) Plotted on a log scale with cumulative

publications, this function exhibits the logistic “S-curve” characteristic of technology maturation
models in other fields.(13)
Figure 3A and Figure 3B show annual publications and TIME model curve fit for RdRp
and NcAn respectively. Figures 3C and 3D show cumulative publications and the TIME model
curve plotted on log scale. In this projection, it is evident that RdRp research progressed
through two successive S curves. The first has a calculated initiation point (Ti) of 1962 and
exhibited exponential growth through the late 1960s. The second exhibited exponential growth
through the 1990s and early 2000s, reaching a calculated established point (Te) of 2008. This
pattern of successive S-curves is consistent with evidence from other fields that technological
progress classically proceeds through a series of novel innovations, each of which introduces a
new period of exponential advance leading to a limit.(13, 14)
PharmaProjects lists 97 investigational drugs targeted against RdRp since 1989. Figure
3C shows the clinical development timelines for the two approved products, sofosbuvir and
dasabuvir, as well as remdesivir. Also shown is the distribution of first reported development
for 94 drugs that have been discontinued or remain in clinical development. These data show
that each of the products now in clinical use entered clinical trials only after RdRp technology
reached the established point and were approved 5, 8, and 12 years after this point (Figure 3C).
Of the 97 investigational drugs targeted against RdRp, 47 are NcAn. This includes two in
clinical use, sofosbuvir and remdesivir, 40 discontinued, and five in development at the end of
2019. Of the 50 that are not NcAn, one is approved, dasabuvir, and three remain in
development, including silibinin sodium hemisuccinate (approved in the EU) as well as CC-

31244 and cephaeline, which are reported as being in development at the end of 2019 by
PharmaProjects.
Research on NcAn followed a single S-curve with calculated initiation points of 1961 and
a calculated established point of 1994 (Figure 3D). More than 60 NcAn drugs and combinations
are approved by the FDA for cancer or various viral diseases including HIV, hepatitis-C (HCV), or
herpes simplex virus.(21-24) Both sofosbuvir and remdesivir entered clinical trials long after the
established point of NcAn research and entered clinical practice 19 and 26 years after this point
(Figure 3D).
Research and Development of Remdesivir Through 2019. A PubMed search for remdesivir (GS5734) identified 23 published before the end of 2019, of which six had NIH support indicated in
RePORTER. There were an additional 106 PMID from January through May 12, 2020, but
RePORTER data on NIH involvement in this research is not yet available.
The six papers published through 2019 were supported by 18 Project Years of NIH
funding totaling $46.52 million in Project Costs from 2000-2019 (Supplemental Table 2). This
result is similar to the total described in a recent KEI Briefing Note detailing the role of the
federal government in the development of remdesivir (20). The KEI Briefing Note tracked
specific events in product development from 2014 through May 2020, identifying seven NIH
Projects mentioned in the acknowledgements and having Project Costs in RePORTER
(Supplemental Table 2). The methods used in the KEI Briefing note and the present work differ
substantially. The KEI Briefing Note included total Project Costs of each NIH Project
acknowledged in these publications, but explicitly excluded the Costs of Program Projects and

Centers or Projects related to training. The present work considers only the Project Year
corresponding to the specific publication date, and does include Costs of Program Projects,
Centers, and Training Projects.
Supplemental Table 3 details non-NIH sources of funding acknowledged in the 23
publications on remdesivir published through 2019 as well as co-authorship from these
institutions. Of the 15 publications acknowledging sources of support, the majority reported
involvement by Gilead Sciences. Other sources of funding most commonly cited were the
Center for Disease Control and agencies within the Department of Defense. Project Costs for
non-NIH sources of funding are not publicly available.

DISCUSSION

This study examined the body of foundational research underlying remdesivir in the
context of studies suggesting that efficient development of targeted therapeutics is critically
dependent on a mature body of basic and applied research.(4, 5, 25, 26) Quantitative analysis
demonstrates that decades of research on RdRp and NcAn generated established bodies of
research on both the drug target and parent chemical structure of remdesivir at least ten years
before the emergence of COVID-19 and the subsequent Emergency Use Authorization of
remdesivir. This analysis also demonstrates that the NIH contributed over $6 billion to this body
of research.
The quantitative picture of research on RdRp and NcAn described here closely
parallels the history of these fields. The calculated initiation point for research on RdRp
corresponds to the recognition of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity in viruses such as
poliovirus, mengovirus, and Newcastle disease virus in the 1960s.(27-29) This research
introduced a period of exponential advance and generation of an extensive body of literature
on the structure and function of homologous RdRp enzymes from various positive and negative
stranded RNA viruses.(30) Text analysis demonstrates that a large fraction of this research has
involved endemic viruses (e.g., HCV) or emerging epidemic viruses including Ebola and
Coronavirus.
The first NcAn drugs arose from the discovery of naturally occurring products
comprising nucleobases with anticancer activity(31). Early studies on NcAn compounds

demonstrated that these compounds had poor pharmaceutical properties, and decades of
research focused on developing strategies to increase the lipophilicity and bioavailability of the
molecules and facilitate metabolism of the prodrug to the active triphosphate.(32, 33) Today,
NcAn drugs are commonly inactive prodrugs with suitable pharmaceutical properties, which
must be metabolized to the biologically active compound once absorbed into the body.
The development of remdesivir benefited directly from both bodies of
research.(34) Remdesivir had its chemical origins in research on Tubercidin, a cytotoxic
nucleoside produced by Streptomyces tubercidicus known to inhibit RNA polymerases.
Foundational studies of the effects of 1’ modifications in the ribose of the C-nucleoside analog
of Tubercidin demonstrated that nitrile substitution at this position produced a compound with
low micro-molar activity against multiple viral strains including Parainfluenza 3 and SARSCoV.(35) This compound, however, had unsuitable pharmaceutical properties, and required
further modifications using established prodrug technologies.(32) One of the resulting
compounds, GS-5734 (remdesivir), was shown to inhibit RdRp from HCV and had activity
against Ebola virus.(36-38) Remdesivir was tested previously in clinical trials for Ebola, and
while it was shown to be relatively safe, it proved to be inferior to other therapies.(39)
With the discovery and sequencing of COVID-19 in late 2019 and early 2020, it was
recognized that the structure of the COVID-19 RdRp protein preserved essential features of the
homologous nucleotide binding site of RdRp from SARS and MERS, suggesting that it could also
be an inhibitor of COVID-19 RdRp.(40) In vitro studies confirmed that remdesivir was active
against COVID-19,(41) and the first clinical trials began in February 2020. These trials provided

sufficient evidence that remdesivir shortened the clinical course of the disease for Emergency
Use Authorization at the end of April 2020.(42)
The quantitative analysis of research advance and maturation used in this study
does not identify discrete milestones in the discovery or development of remdesivir. Rather,
this approach posits that the broad corpus of published research—including research
representing new discoveries, research refining details of biological structures or functions,
research relating failed experiments, and research replicating previous findings—all contribute
to the foundation of knowledge necessary for successful drug development. In the case of
remdesivir, successful development required extensive prior knowledge of the structureactivity relationship of RdRp from different viral species as well as established strategies for
circumventing the limitations of NcAn compounds as pharmaceutical products.
The relationship between the accumulation of research on RdRp and the
emergence of effective RdRp inhibitors is consistent with previous studies demonstrating that
few targeted therapeutics are approved before research on the biological target passes an
established maturity point.(4, 5, 8) Specifically, while 97 products targeted to RdRp entered
development since 1989, the first clinical successes were achieved only after research on both
the drug target and parent drug structure passed the established point. The first approved
nucleoside drugs (e.g., cytarabinine approved in 1969) were natural products discovered
through phenotypic methods, which are commonly approved before there is a mature body of
basic research on the drug target.(5, 8) Nevertheless, the current generation of nucleoside
analogues designed to inhibit RdRp are also products of a mature body of research on
nucleoside chemistry and pharmacology.

This analysis also demonstrates the substantial cost of establishing this mature
body of foundational research. NIH-funding contributed to 20% of RdRp publications, totaling
$1,875 million (2000–2019). Of this amount, $547 million was contributed before the
established point in 2008. NIH funding also contributed to 21% of all NcAn publications, totaling
$4,612 million (2000–2019). For both, the fraction of NIH-funded publications was lower than
reported previously for other drug targets.(10, 11) This is consistent with the long-term decline
in U.S. funding for university research,(43) but also associated with a sharp drop-off in the
number of NIH-funded PMID related to RdRp observed after 2012.
The present results present a distinctly different picture of the public sector
investment underlying remdesivir than a recent KEI Briefing Note.(20) That report focused
exclusively on identifying NIH funding acknowledged in publications describing the
development of remdesivir, as opposed to the basic research that made the design and
discovery of this entity possible. The substantially higher estimate of the NIH contribution to
remdesivir detailed in the present study is consistent with the observation that >90% of NIH
funding contributing to drugs approved from 2010-2019 represented basic research on drug
targets, rather than the drugs themselves (10,11), and the fact that the biopharmaceutical
industry is primarily responsible for funding drug development.(6, 44-46) While case studies
show that drug development programs in industry often benefit from public sector input,(45,
46), <10% of new drugs are first patented by academic institutions(47) and only half of drug
patents cite prior art from public institutions.(48) It is worth noting that since COVID-19 was
declared a public health emergency in January 2020, the federal government has assumed a
more aggressive role in funding development of remdesivir and other therapies for COVID-19.

It is notable that while the large majority of the NIH-funded Projects Years related
to RdRp and NcAn were investigator-initiated Research Projects (primarily R01), these grants
represent only a small fraction of total Project Costs, less than the Costs associated with either
Research Program Projects and Centers or Cooperative Agreements. This diversity of funding
mechanisms reflects the broad contribution of NIH funding to investigator-initiated initiatives,
research infrastructure, and mission-driven health initiatives as environed by the NIH
Roadmap.(49)
There are several limitations to the present analysis. First, PubMed searches may
fail to identify relevant publications describing enabling technologies or research performed
before widely-recognized vocabularies emerge. Second, it is not possible to associate costs with
every NIH-funded publication due to differences between the publication dates and Project
Years. The method used here corrects for the estimated 3-year lag between publication dates
and associated funding in RePORTER(50) by assigning costs for the final Project Year of each
project to publications 1–4 years after the Project ended.(10) With this correction, the method
associates costs with 90–91% of NIH-funded PMID and 79–80% of Project Years for RdRp and
NcAn respectively. Third, this method does not include funding for research not reported
through NIH RePORTER, such as funding from Department of Defense, philanthropies, and
international sources. Thus, the total public sector funding for research underlying remdesivir is
likely substantially greater than the amount described here. Finally, this analysis does not
account for investments in applied research and development by industry, which are estimated
to be as much as $1.5 billion in out-of-pocket costs for each new drug approval.(6)

These results demonstrate the critical role played by an existing foundation of
basic research in the ability to rapidly develop remdesivir in response to the COVID-19
pandemic. In doing so, it argues for a federal commitment to sustained funding for a broad
base of basic research, even when no imminent threat exists. This work also demonstrates the
scale of the government and public sector investment in the research that enabled
development of remdesivir and other RdRp inhibitors that are likely to be developed for
treating COVID-19. This investment, along with that of industry, needs to be counted in
developing policies to ensure the availability and affordability of the drugs that result from this
research. As stated in an April 30, 2020 letter from Representatives Lloyd Doggett and Rosa
DeLauro to HHS secretary Alex Azar “The substantial taxpayer investments in COVID-19
pharmaceutical research must be recognized.”(51)

2020) and search terms for remdesivir, RdRp, and NcAn described in Supplemental Table 1.
Search terms were optimized by examining publication titles, abstracts, and descriptions of
search results for randomly selected result pages and eliminating query terms that introduced
irrelevant results. Publications were identified by PubMed Identifier (PMID) and publication
year.
Methods for quantifying the contribution of NIH funding to publications identified in
PubMed using NIH RePORTER (https://exporter.nih.gov/ExPORTER_Catalog.aspx; accessed May
5, 2020), have been described previously.(10) Briefly, PMID were associated with fiscal years of
program funding (Program Years) from 1980–2019 using the “Link Table,” and annual Project
Costs from 2000–2019 identified using the “Projects Table.” Publications occurring before the
first year of the grant award or more than four years after the last year of the grant were
excluded. Publications 1–4 years after the last year of the grant were associated with the
Project Costs of the last year. PMID related to remdesivir are included with data for the target
RdRp. Grant categories were derived from NIH Types of Grant Programs 2020
(https://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/funding_program.htm; accessed May 2020). Costs are
given in constant dollars inflation adjusted to 2018 using the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics All
Urban Consumer Prices (Current Series) (https://www.bls.gov/data/; accessed May, 2020).

Text analysis was performed on abstracts, titles, MeSH descriptors, and MeSH qualifiers
to quantify mentions of specific positive-strand ssRNA or negative-strand ssRNA viruses
targeted in drug discovery programs(21) as well as terms related to oncology and immunology.
All analyses were performed in PostgreSQL, Excel and Tableau.
Technology Maturation Model. The bibliographic Technology Innovation Maturation
Evaluation (TIME) model fits the cumulative number of publications resulting from a PubMed
search to an exponentiated logistic function as described previously.(4) The equation has the
form:
log 𝐿𝐿

𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 = 1+𝑒𝑒 −𝑟𝑟(𝑡𝑡−𝑡𝑡0 )

Where N is the number of publications, L is the presumed upper limit of publications, r is the
growth rate, t is time, and t0 is midpoint of the exponential growth. This asymmetric sigmoidal
function, exhibits the common logistic sigmoid function over log scales. The parameters were fit
to time series publication data using a non-linear least squares implementation of the
Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (LMFIT, version 1.0.1).
The initiation and established points, representing the beginning and end of the exponential
growth phase are defined as the points of maximum and minimum acceleration respectively, or
logN’’(t)max,min. These points are analytically determined by:
𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸ℎ𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒, 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼 = 𝑡𝑡0 ±
