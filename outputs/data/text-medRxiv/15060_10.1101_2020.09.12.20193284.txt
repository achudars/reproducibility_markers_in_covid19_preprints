We estimate the basic reproductive number and case counts for 15
distinct SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, distributed across 10 countries and
one cruise ship, based solely on phylodynamic analyses of genomic
data. Our results indicate that, prior to significant public health interventions, the reproductive numbers for a majority (10) of these
outbreaks are similar, with median posterior estimates ranging between 1.4 and 2.8. These estimates provide a view which is complementary to that provided by those based on traditional line listing
data. The genomic-based view is arguably less susceptible to biases resulting from differences in testing protocols, testing intensity,
and import of cases into the community of interest. In the analyses
reported here, the genomic data primarily provides information regarding which samples belong to a particular outbreak. We observe
that once these outbreaks are identified, the sampling dates carry
the majority of the information regarding the reproductive number.
Finally, we provide genome-based estimates of the cumulative case
counts for each outbreak, which allow us to speculate on the amount
of unreported infections within the populations housing each outbreak. These results indicate that for the majority (7) of the populations studied, the number of recorded cases is much bigger than
the estimated cumulative case counts, suggesting the presence of
unsequenced pathogen diversity in these populations.

T

he novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and the corresponding
disease COVID-19 continue to spread at an alarming rate.
As of the 27th of August 2020, close to 9 months after its initial
identification, over 24 million confirmed cases and nearly seven
hundred thousand deaths have been reported globally. (1).
In order to understand the global threat this pandemic
poses, it is necessary to accurately quantify the underlying
transmission dynamics of the virus and, in particular, its basic
reproductive number (2). This information is used to determine the likely future trajectories of individual outbreaks, and
to retrospectively assess the impact of containment measures.
Inference of the transmission dynamics is traditionally achieved
using line list data (3) comprised of case confirmation times,
locations and patient details, and this approach is being widely
applied (4–7) by various groups around the world seeking to
understand the current pandemic.
In particular, the EpiForecasts platform (8) is reporting
frequently-updated results based on these methods as new
line list data becomes available. While details vary between
countries, these analyses indicate that the median estimates
for the basic reproductive number for the populations studied
in this report lie between 1.5 and 3. Our own monitoring
of the reproductive number is updated daily using the latest
confirmation, hospitalization, death, and excess death data
with a focus on European countries (9) leading to similar
results.

Despite the wide-spread application of such methods, the
estimates produced by line list data alone are inherently susceptible to several biases and limitations (10–12). Firstly, the
presence of pools of undiagnosed infected individuals, together
with changes in testing methods and the extent to which testing is happening at all, can lead to misleading characterizations
of the epidemic. Secondly, it is often impossible to discriminate
between import cases and those attributable to local transmission based on line list data. This has the potential to produce
overestimates of local transmission rates. Estimating rates
and directions of transmission between geographic regions is
similarly impeded. Thirdly, on their own, these data do not
provide information about the state of outbreaks before the
first recorded case.
Characterizing transmission dynamics is critical to the successful design of public health interventions. Thus, finding
ways around potential biases and limitations when quantifying
transmission dynamics is crucial. Fortunately, early testing
efforts have been paralleled by significant efforts to sequence
SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the initial outbreak and subsequent pandemic in “real time”. Many of the groups responsible
for sequencing SARS-CoV-2 genomes have generously chosen
to make them available immediately to the public research
community via the GISAID platform (13). These data have
been successfully used for the development of testing assays
(14) and for learning about the molecular structure of the
virus (15, 16). Importantly, the continued and widespread
sequencing efforts has also enabled — in combination with
phylodynamic methods (17, 18), independent, and potentially

Significance Statement
Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in late 2019,
researchers around the globe have sought to estimate the rate
at which the disease spread through populations prior to public
health intervention, as quantified by the parameter R0 . This is
often estimated based on case count data and may be biased
due to the presence of import cases. To overcome this, we
estimate R0 by applying Bayesian phylodynamic methods to
SARS-CoV-2 genomes which have been made available by
laboratories worldwide. We provide R0 and absolute infection
count estimates for 15 distinct outbreaks. These estimates
contribute to our understanding of the baseline transmission
dynamics of the disease, which will be critical in guiding future
public health responses to the pandemic.

more robust, estimates of very early transmission dynamics.
Phylodynamic methods couple epidemiological models with
models of sequence evolution, allowing us to estimate transmission dynamics based on the relationships between SARSCoV-2 genome sequences. Several studies have already made
use of SARS-CoV-2 sequence data in a phylodynamic context.
For example, Lai et al. (19) inferred early dynamics of the
global effective reproductive number, using all available sequences at the date of publishing, obtaining an R0 estimate
of 2.6, with a 95% credible interval [2.1, 5.1]. In contrast, Volz
et al. (20) focused on a specific Wuhan-associated outbreak
cluster and used a compartment model to also infer a basic
reproductive number of 2.6, but with a 95% credible interval [1.5, 5]. Genomes have also been coupled with extremely
detailed agent-based models to infer the probable sources of
infection for specific COVID-19 cases within the Australian
population (21).
In this paper we go further and infer the basic reproductive
number (R0 ) for each of 15 distinct outbreaks distributed
among 10 countries and the Diamond Princess cruise ship using
phylodynamic methods. We use Bayesian model averaging
to quantify the evidence for distinct R0 values as opposed to
groups of outbreaks sharing R0 values. Finally, we provide
Bayesian estimates of cumulative case counts over time for
each of the outbreaks as ensembles of possible trajectories.

Results
We used the NextStrain (22) platform to identify outbreak
clusters for which sequence data exist, and selected only those
sequences sampled prior to or just after the introduction of
strong public health interventions in the associated locations
(see Methods). (The Diamond Princess outbreak is an exception to this protocol, as the interventions were put in place
immediately on the date corresponding to the first sequenced
sample.)
We then applied a Bayesian phylodynamic framework (17),
to co-infer R0 along with the probability of a infected person
being included in our dataset, and the underlying phylogenetic
trees for these clusters. This inference was done under the
assumption of constant transmission rates (i.e. a constant rate
birth-death process) for each cluster, with the sole exception of
the Diamond Princess, where we allowed for the transmission
rate to shift at the time of the onboard quarantine.
Figure 1 illustrates the posterior distributions for R0 associated with each of the outbreaks, together with the prior
distribution for comparison. Interestingly, rather than a continuum of values, our analysis seems to isolate several distinct
modes. The median posteriors for the majority of outbreaks lie
between 1.4 and 2.9. However, the R0 values inferred for the
two outbreaks associated with Iceland, the Welsh outbreak, a
Washington State (USA) outbreak and the Diamond Princess
outbreak have posterior median values ranging between 4 and
7. We used a Bayesian model averaging scheme to quantify
the number of significantly distinct R0 values among all outbreaks, and found support for four distinct values (see figure
S1 for the posterior distribution). The corresponding posterior
distributions for the outbreak-specific R0 values generated by
this model are shown in figure S2. A comparison of the preand post-quarantine effective reproductive number estimates
for the Diamond Princess outbreak is shown in figure S3, and
shows a significant drop in transmission rate following the im2

plementation of isolation measures. The proportion of infected
individuals sampled for sequencing in each outbreak was also
inferred as part of this analysis and these results are shown in
figure S4.

this study. Solid horizontal lines represent median values; the dashed horizontal line
represents the threshold between exponential growth and decline of outbreak.

Birth-death phylodynamic results are dependent not only
on the genomic data, but also on the distribution of sample
collection dates. In fact, we find that in this instance, the
sample collection dates carry most of the information regarding
R0 . We demonstrated this by running an additional set of
phylodynamic analyses in which the genomic sequences were
treated as unknown. Additionally, we applied both a simplistic
linear regression approach (see Methods) and an established
traditional approach (12) to the cumulative sequence counts.
The results of these alternative analyses are summarized in
figure S5 and—in many cases—show relatively close agreement,
albeit with slightly less certainty in the estimates than those
shown in figure 1.
Given this dominating effect of the sampling times, it is
natural to consider how sensitive our results are to the assumption that the sampling rate and reproductive number
are fixed over the time period of each outbreak. We thus
performed a separate set of analyses in which these quantities
were allowed to change at a point at the center of the sampling
window of each outbreak (excluding the Diamond Princess
outbreak). The resulting R0 estimates, presented in figure S8,
show no major change in the results compared with those in
figure 1, with the exception of the Netherland (1) and WA
States (1) outbreaks which suggest higher R0 values. In order
to investigate how much our results are impacted by the prior,
we repeated the fixed-rate analyses with a broader prior on
R0 . This broad prior did not qualitatively change the results
compared to our main analysis (figure S9).
Inferred cumulative case count trajectories for the Washington State and Diamond Princess outbreaks are shown in
figure 2 alongside the daily number of confirmed cases as reported by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at
Johns Hopkins University (23), to which we have applied a 10
day offset in order to account for the estimated delay between
infection and case confirmation (9). In the cases where two
outbreaks are associated with the same location, the inferred
case counts are combined. Similar case count trajectories for

Discussion. Our central result is that prior to strong public

health interventions, the majority (10) of the outbreaks studied
seem to have grown at rates with median R0 values ranging
between 1.4 (Spain) and 2.8 (China).
The specific case of the Diamond Princess is interesting, as
the details of this outbreak are well known and, at least for
the time period affecting our analysis, the population involved
was strictly isolated (i.e. we can say with a high degree of
certainty that no immigration or emigration occurred). In this
case, we believe the high pre-intervention R0 estimate reflects
a real elevated infection rate caused by unchecked transmission
within the relatively confined on-board environment.
The remaining outbreaks to which higher R0 values are
attributed are limited to those with the shortest sampling
windows (see figure S7). Given the strong role played by
sample times in these inferences, it is therefore possible that
these values are the result of bias due to sampling model
misspecification, and that this problem is exacerbated by the
Vaughan et al.

short sampling windows involved. The sampling model used
for these outbreaks assumes that samples accumulate at a rate
proportional to the number of infectious cases for the duration
over which samples are available. We showed that allowing
for a single shift in sampling rate and R0 during the outbreak
did not result in much lower R0 values for these remaining
outbreaks.
Another potential source of upward bias on R0 is the process
of outbreak selection. We necessarily restrict our attention to
outbreaks for which sufficient data exist to provide statistical
signal. This restriction may have the effect of selecting for
steeper outbreak trajectories. Since the birth-death models
under which we perform the inference do not account for this
conditioning, these steeper trajectories will be interpreted as
evidence for larger R0 , even when the increased gradient is
simply the result of demographic noise in the growth of the
epidemic. Including appropriate conditioning in phylodynamic
inference to guard against this kind of bias will be the focus
of future research.
Given that most of information content in the genome
sequence data analyzed seems to come from sampling times, it
is natural to wonder whether the phylodynamic approach offers
additional insights on these outbreaks. The obvious answer
to this challenge is that, genomic data allowed us to identify
outbreaks in the absence of contact tracing data, which is
often not available for study. Furthermore, even though the
impact of the phylogeny within each identified outbreak on the
inferred epidemic parameters was negligible, the application
of phylodynamic methods yield information about the total
number of cases through time, including those which have
gone undetected.
We emphasize, however, that extreme care must be taken
when interpreting both these inferred and clinically confirmed
case counts as representative of the true underlying case load.
Firstly, our inferences correspond to the number of cases
associated only with the specific outbreaks from which the
genomic data originate. It is entirely possible that additional
outbreaks, from which we do not have genetic data, occurred
within a given population during the time periods considered.

These cryptic outbreaks could contribute to the confirmed
case counts but would be absent from our phylodynamic inference. Secondly, the confirmed case numbers themselves can
only provide a lower bound on the true number of cases in
a population. Taken together, these points imply that the
larger of the phylodynamically-inferred case counts and the
corresponding confirmed case counts provide a lower bound
on the true number of cases within each population.
We highlight in this paper the importance of SARS-CoV-2
genomes for quantifying transmission dynamics. In particular,
we provide estimates for the basic reproductive number which
are complementary to classic epidemiological studies. Our
phylodynamic analyses of SARS-CoV-2 genomes confirm the
R0 estimates for Wuhan (5) and provide estimates for 15
outbreaks around the world for which classic epidemiological
methods are problematic due to the difficulty of disentangling
introductions from local transmissions. Going forward, we
are convinced that SARS-CoV-2 genomes will become useful
for quantifying changes in transmission rates (for instance,
using the BDSKY model of Stadler et al. (17)) and become
essential for evaluating the importance of local transmission
versus imports (for instance, using the multi-type birth-death
model of Kühnert et al. (24)). The latter is in particular
important after the end of lock-down measures which we
currently experience in many European countries. Indeed, for
patients whose infection is not traceable, it is the genomes
which contain valuable information for linking them into the
transmission chain and thus quantify transmission dynamics.

els we employ assume that genome samples are taken uniformly at
random from the infectious population during the early, exponential
growth phase of each outbreak. Since our analysis is necessarily
retrospective rather than prospective, we devised two strategies
to approximate such a sampling scheme using publicly-available
samples from GISAID (13). For sparsely-sampled, un-sampled, or
clearly non-uniformly sampled outbreaks (Italy, Iran, and China before the quarantine of Wuhan, respectively), we included sequences
from cases that were exposed in the region of interest and subsequently traveled abroad, where they were then diagnosed and
sampled. (The sequences attributed to the Iranian outbreak, for
example, are all travel cases isolated and sequenced in Australia
(25).) For more densely-sampled outbreaks (France, Iceland, the
Netherlands, Spain, Wales, and Washington State, USA), we analyzed samples that were exposed and sampled within the region
of interest. For these outbreaks, we considered only samples that
clustered together with other samples from the same region in a
phylogenetic tree of the global pandemic (22). This was done in
order to sample primarily within-region transmission events.

able on GISAID (13) on April 1st , 2020. After quality-filtering this
sequence set, we aligned the sequences, built a phylogenetic tree,
and identified regional outbreak clusters within the tree. Sequence
quality-control, alignment, and tree building were all performed
using the Nextstrain pipeline adapted to SARS-CoV-2 (26).
We first filtered the available sequences to exclude sequences
shorter than 25,000 base pairs, sequences with imprecise sampling
dates, known re-samples of the same case, low-quality sequences (as
determined by Nextstrain), and all but one sequence from known
epidemiologically-linked cases. We note that our knowledge of which
samples come from epidemiologically-linked cases (as identified by
Nextstrain and gleaned from media reports) is far from exhaustive. Whenever we were able to access this information we used
it to exclude non-randomly sampled sequences, but in many cases
4

the relevant information was either not collected or not readily
accessible.

281

Alignment and outbreak detection. After these filtering steps, we
aligned the remaining sequences to a reference genome generated
from an early COVID-19 patient in Wuhan (GenBank accession
number MN908947) (27). SNPs in the first 130 sites, last 50 sites,
and at sites 18529, 29849, 29851, and 29853 were masked from the
alignment because they are likely sequencing artifacts (26).
We built a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree using this
alignment. We then picked clades from this tree where sufficient
(≥ 9) samples from the same region clustered together. We assume
that these clusters represent primarily within-country transmission
events rather than introductions from abroad.
Exceptionally for the Itay, Iran, and China outbreaks we additionally identified samples from cases that were presumably exposed
to the virus in these regions but were sampled abroad (travel cases).
The data set for Italy included sequences from both non-travel and
travel cases, while those for China and Iran were composed exclusively of sequences from travel cases. This exposure information
comes from metadata available on GISAID and Nexstrain, as well as
information provided by sequencing centers and in media accounts.

283

Sample set truncation. To limit sampling to the early, exponential
growth phase of each regional outbreak, we truncated sampling
based on the dates of major public health interventions (Table S1).
We retained only samples collected before or on the date of theses
public health interventions, with the exception of the Iran, Iceland,
and Spain outbreaks. For these outbreaks, we extended the time
cutoff so that the sample size was not prohibitively small. (The
extension for Iran was 11 days, for Iceland it was 2 days, and the
cutoff for Spain was extended by 1 day, as shown in Table S1.) Since
the transmission events leading to sampled cases likely happened at
least a few days before sampling, these cutoffs should, for the most
part, be conservative.

Phylodynamic analyses.

314

Main analyses. Sequence alignments were analyzed jointly as part of
a single Bayesian phylodynamic analysis using the BDSKY package
(17) of BEAST 2 (28), using a single HKY+Γ substitution model
with a strict clock rate fixed to 8 × 10−4 substitutions/site/year
(following Nextstrain (22)). The tree T (c) corresponding to each
outbreak cluster c was assumed to be produced by a birth-death pro(c)
cess with reproductive number R0 , sampling proportion s(c) and
become uninfectious rate δ. In each case, the sampling proportion
for the outbreak was assumed to be zero before the first included
sample for that outbreak. In the special case of the Diamond
Princess outbreak, a second (effective) R0 value was associated with
the days following the on-board intervention. All R0 values were
assumed to be independent and given a LogNormal(0.8, 0.5) prior.
The time between the start of the birth-death process associated
with each outbreak and the time of the most recent sample for the
same outbreak was given a LogNormal(−2, 0.8) prior. The value of
the become uninfectious rate δ was fixed to 36.5, equivalent to an
expected time until becoming uninfectious for each individual of 10
days. (This is in line with the estimates of the latent and infectious
periods provided by Li et al. (4), and follows the assumptions used
by Sciré et al. (9).)
A second analysis was run with an identical model configuration
to the first analysis, aside from its use of Bayesian model averaging
(c)
to quantify the number of distinct R0 values needed to describe
the outbreaks. This was done by applying a Dirichlet process prior
~ 0 = [R(c1 ) , R(c2 ) , . . . , R(c15 ) ]. Following the
(DPP) to the vector R
0
0
0
prescription of Dorazio (29), a Gamma hyperprior was applied to
the intensity parameter of the DPP such that the implied prior
~ 0 was as close to
distribution for the number of unique elements of R
uniform as possible. The base distribution of the DPP was chosen
to be LogNormal(0.8, 0.5). The prior for each the sampling proportion was chosen to be Beta(1, 4), which prioritizes low sampling
probabilities without completely excluding higher probabilities.

315

Sensitivity analyses. We ran two additional analyses to determine
the sensitivity of our conclusions to the model assumptions. Firstly,
to test the robustness with respect to changes in the R0 priors,

parameter. Secondly, we ran an analysis in which both
and
s(c) were allowed to change once during each outbreak, at a time
midway between the first and last sample assigned to that outbreak.

355

Sample-date only analyses. In order to assess the relative impact of

the sequence data on these R0 estimates, another joint phylodynamic analysis was performed using the same setup as the first, but
without any sequence data.
(c)
Additionally, a simple regression inference of the R0 was conducted by assuming that the number of active infections associated
with each outbreak grew according to the deterministic function
(c)
N (c) (t) = exp[δ(R0 − 1)t]. This implies that the logarithm of the

cumulative number of samples grows linearly at the rate δ(R0 − 1),
which we then fit to the empirical cumulative sample numbers from
each outbreak.
In order to test the robustness of the phylodynamic estimates
(c)
of the outbreak-specific R0 values, we applied EpiEstim (12) to
the same sample time distributions used for the regression analysis.
(c)
In these analyses, R0 was assumed to be constant through time
in each outbreak. A serial interval of mean 4.8 days and standard
deviation 2.3 days was used (30).

Case count trajectory inference. Inference of cumulative case count

trajectories was achieved by applying the particle filter algorithm implemented in EpiInf (31) to the outbreak-specific tree and parameter
posteriors produced by the corresponding BDSKY analyses.
