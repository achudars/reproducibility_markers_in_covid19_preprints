Abstract
Background
Public health recommendations and governmental measures during the COVID-19 pandemic have
enforced numerous restrictions on daily living including social distancing, isolation and home
confinement. While these measures are imperative to abate the spreading of COVID-19, the impact
of these restrictions on health behaviours and lifestyle at home is undefined. Therefore, an
international online survey was launched in April 2020 in seven languages to elucidate the
behavioral and lifestyle consequences of COVID-19 restrictions. This report presents the
preliminary results from the first thousand responders on physical activity (PA) and nutrition
behaviours.
Methods
Thirty-five research organisations from Europe, North-Africa, Western Asia and the Americas
promoted the survey through their networks to the general society, in English, German, French,
Arabic, Spanish, Portugese, and Slovenian languages. Questions were presented in a differential
format with questions related to responses “before” and “during” confinement conditions.
Results
1047 replies (54% women) from Asia (36%), Africa (40%), Europe (21%) and other (3%) were
included into a general analysis. The COVID-19 home confinement had a negative effect on all
intensities of PA (vigorous, moderate, walking and overall). Conversely, daily sitting time
increased from 5 to 8 hours per day. Additionally, food consumption and meal patterns (the type
of food, eating out of control, snacks between meals, number of meals) were more unhealthy during
confinement with only alcohol binge drink decreasing significantly.

Conclusion
While isolation is a necessary measure to protect public health, our results indicate that it alters
physical activity and eating behaviours in a direction that would compromise health. A more
detailed analysis of survey data will allow for a segregation of these responses in different age
groups, countries and other subgroups which will help develop bespoke interventions to mitigate
the negative lifestyle behaviors manifest during the COVID-19 confinement.

Background
In the face of the present COVID-19 pandemic, public health recommendations and governmental
measures have enforced lock-downs and restrictions. While these restrictions help to abate the rate
of infection, such limitations result in negative effects by limiting participation in normal daily
activities, physical activity (PA), travel and access to many forms of exercise (e.g., closed gyms,
no groups gatherings, increased social distancing).1 Several countries are enforcing curfews, which
limit the time to participate in outdoor activities, or are excluding outdoor activities entirely. Such
restrictions impose a burden on the health in the population by potentially compromising physical
fitness, which is positively associated with the ability to cope with an infection, and the
immunologic and cardiopulmonary complications of more severe outcomes.2,3
Physical inactivity and poor mental health are among the most important risk factors for major
disease morbidity, both in Western societies and globally.4 This holds true not only for the general
population, but also for older adults and chronically ill patient populations who are at heightened
risk of COVID-19-inducd ill health and mortality. For children and youth, physical activity is
closely coupled to school-related activities, active transport and sport participation.5 Since schools
have been closed during the COVID-19 pandemic this will also compromise physical activity in
this population and might also risk longer-term sedentary behaviours.
In addition to the challenged to engage in PA, the closure of food suppliers has placed a burden on
normal food-related behaviour.6 This is noteworthy since good nutrition is important for health and
well-being, particularly when the immune system is challenged7 and limited access to fresh food
could negatively affect overall physical and mental health.8 Anxiety and boredom evoked by
quarantine are considered risk factors for consuming more food and food of a poorer quality

compared to standard living conditions.9 Combined with the potential for lower levels of PA,
consuming a high volume of poorer quality food would lead to a more positive energy balance.10
Currently, there is limited evidence to evaluate the effect of confinement on PA and diet
behaviours. It is important to investigate how PA and eating behaviour can be affected by lengthy
restrictions to establish a fundamental knowledge basis from which to inform appropriate
recommendations, including lifestyle modifications during this time. Thus, the main research
questions are:
(1) To what extent is physical activity and eating behaviours changed during lengthy restrictions?
(2) Are there changes in mental state, mood and sleep during lengthy restrictions?
(3) Which demographic, cultural and lifestyle factors should be considered as moderators of these
effects?
The present paper presents preliminary data on physical activity and nutrition responses before
and during home confinement, collected by an international online survey (ECLB-COVID19, link).
Other parts of the survey evaluate socialisation, sleep, mental and mood status, and general lifestyle
and these findings will be published elsewhere. There is a common method description in all
papers.
Methods
We report findings on the first 1047 replies to an international online-survey on mental health and
multi-dimension lifestyle behaviors during home confinement (ECLB-COVID19). ECLBCOVID19 was opened on April 1, 2020, tested by the project’s steering group for a period of 1
week, before starting to spread it worldwide on April 6, 2020. Thirty-five research organizations
from Europe, North-Africa, Western Asia and the Americas promoted dissemination and
administration of the survey. ECLB-COVID19 was administered in English, German, French,

Arabic, Spanish, Portuguese, and Slovenian languages (is currently provided also in Dutch, Persian
and Italian). The survey included sixty-four questions on health, mental wellbeing, mood, life
satisfaction and multidimension lifestyle behaviors (physical activity, diet, social participation,
sleep, technology-use, need of psychosocial support). All questions were presented in a differential
format, to be answered directly in sequence regarding “before” and “during” confinement
conditions. The study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol and
the consent form were fully approved (identification code: 62/20) by the Otto von Guericke
University Ethics Committee.
Survey development and promotion
The ECLB-COVID19 electronic survey was designed by a steering group of multidisciplinary
scientists and academics (i.e., human science, sport science, neuropsychology and computer
science) at the University of Magdeburg (principal investigator), the University of Sfax, the
University of Münster and the University of Paris-Nanterre, following a structured review of the
literature. The survey was then reviewed and edited by Over 50 colleagues and experts worldwide.
The survey was uploaded and shared on the Google online survey platform. A link to the electronic
survey was distributed worldwide by consortium colleagues via a range of methods: invitation via
e-mails, shared in consortium’s faculties official pages, ResearchGate™, LinkedIn™ and other
social media platforms such as Facebook™, WhatsApp™ and Twitter™. Public were also
involved in the dissemination plans of our research through the promotion of the ECLB-COVID19
survey in their networks. The survey included an introductory page describing the background and
the aims of the survey, the consortium, ethics information for participants and the option to choose
one of seven available languages (English, German, French, Arabic, Spanish, Portuguese, and
Slovenian). The present study focusses on the first thousand responses (i.e., 1047 participants),

which were reached on April 11, 2020, approximately one-week after the survey began. This
survey was open for all people worldwide aged 18 years or older. People with cognitive decline
are excluded. Since the data were captured using Google Forms, participants were also required to

survey, they were consenting to participate anonymously in the study.
Survey questionnaires
The ECLB-COVID19 is a multi-country electronic survey designed to assess change in multiple
lifestyle behaviors during the COVID-19 outbreak. Therefore, a collection of validated and/or
crisis-oriented briefs questionnaires were included. These questionnaires assess mental wellbeing
(Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (SWEMWBS)),11 mood and feeling (Short
Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (SMFQ)),12 life satisfaction (Short Life Satisfaction
Questionnaire for Lockdowns (SLSQL), social participation (Short Social Participation
Questionnaire for Lockdowns (SSPQL)), physical activity (International Physical Activity
Questionnaire Short Form (IPAQ-SF)),13,14 diet behaviors (Short Diet Behaviors Questionnaire for
Lockdowns (SDBQL)), sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI))15 and some key
questions assessing the technology-use behaviors (Short Technology-use Behaviors Questionnaire
for Lockdowns (STBQL)), demographic information and the need of psychosocial support.
Reliability of the shortened and/or newly adopted questionnaires was tested by the project steering
group through piloting, prior to survey administration. These brief crisis-oriented questionnaires
showed good to excellent test-retest reliability coefficients (r = 0.84-0.96). A multi-language
validated version already existed for the majority of these questionnaires and/or questions.
However, for questionnaires that did not already exist in multi-language versions, we followed the

procedure of translation and backtranslation, with an additional review for all language versions
from the international scientists of our consortium. As a result, a total number of sixty-for items
were included in the ECLB-COVID19 online survey in a differential format; that is, each item or
question requested two answers, one regarding the period before and the other regarding the period
during confinement. Thus, the participants were guided to compare the situations. Given the large
number of questions included, the present paper focuses on the IPAQ-SF and the newly developed
SDBQL as brief crisis-oriented tools.
International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form (IPAQ-SF)
According to the official IPAQ-SF guidelines, data from the IPAQ-SF are summed within each
item (i.e., vigorous intensity, moderate intensity, and walking) to estimate the total amount of time
spent engaged in PA per week.13,14 Total weekly PA (MET-min·week-1) was estimated by adding
the products of reported time for each item by a MET value that was specific to each category of
PA. We assigned 2 different sets of MET values. The first set was the original values (original
IPAQ) based on the official IPAQ guidelines: vigorous PA = 8.0 METs, moderate PA = 4.0 METs,
and walking = 3.3 METs. The other set used modified values (modified IPAQ), which we had
devised for use with elderly adults, as reported by Stewart et al.16 and Yasunaga et al.17: vigorous
PA = 5.3 METs, moderate PA = 3.0 METs, and walking = 2.5 METs. Additionally, we added the
total PA (sum of performed vigorous, moderate and walking activity) as a 4th item and sitting time
as 5th item in the present work.
Short Diet Behavior Questionnaire for Lockdowns
The SDBQ-L is a newly developed crisis-oriented short questionnaire to assess dietary behavior
before and during the lockdown period. The SDBQ-L has 5 questions related to “unhealthy food”,
“eating out of control”, “snacks between meals”, “alcohol binge drinking”, and “number of
meals/day” in parts referring to the Nutricalc questionnaire, Swiss society of nutrition

(doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0143293.s003). The response choices and their designated scores were
as follows: "Never" = 0; "Sometimes" = 1; "Most of the time" = 2; "Always" = 3. These choices
and points were applied for the first four questionnaires. The choices and the designated scores for
the fifth questionnaire were as follows: “1-2” = 1; “3” = 0; “4” = 1; “5” = 2; “>5” = 3. Total score
of this questionnaire, corresponded to the sum of the scores in the 5 questions. The total score for
the SDBQ-L is from “0” to “15”, where “0” designates no healthy dietary behaviors and “15”
designates severe unhealthy dietary behaviours.
Data Analysis
Descriptive statistics were used to define the proportion of responses for each question and
the total distribution in the total score of each questionnaire. All statistical analyses were performed
using the commercial statistical software STATISTICA (StatSoft, Paris, France, version 10.0) and
Microsoft Excel 2010. Normality of the data distribution was confirmed using the Shapiro-WilksW-test. Values were computed and reported as mean ± SD (standard deviation). To assess for
significant differences in responses “before” and “during” the confinement period, paired samples
t-tests were used. Effect size (Cohen’s d) was calculated to determine the magnitude of the change
of the score and was interpreted using the following criteria: 0.2 (small), 0.5 (moderate), and 0.8
(large).18 Statistical significance was accepted as p<0.05.
Results
Sample description
The present study focused on the first thousand responses (i.e., 1047 participants), which was
reached on April, 11, 2020. Overall 54% of the participants were female women and the
participants were from Asian (36%, mostly from Western Asia), African (40%, mostly from North
Africa), European (21%) and other (3%) countries. Age, health status, employment status, level of
education and marital status are presented in Table 1.

lower during home confinement (t=9.14, p<0.001, d=0.283).
Sitting
Statistical analysis reported that the number of hours/day of sitting increased by 28.6% during
home confinement (t=-25.61, p<0.001, d=1.130).
Dietary behaviors before and during the confinement period
Recorded scores in responses to the diet behavior questionnaire before and during home
confinement are presented in Figure 1 (question 1 to 4) and Figure 2 (question 5).
Total score of diet
Statistical analysis reported that the total score of diet was 4.4% higher during, compared to before,
home confinement (t=-10.66, p<0.001, d=0.50).
Question 1 (Q1): Unhealthy food
The score of Q1 (consuming unhealthy food; Figure 1) was significantly higher during home
confinement (t=-3.46, p<0.001, d=0.14). The percentage of responses that indicated consuming
unhealthy food either most of the time or always was higher during home confinement (23.3% vs.
18.4% for most of the time and 10.9% vs. 6.2% for always).
Question 2 (Q2): Eating out of control
The score of Q2 (eating out of control; Figure 1) was significantly higher during home confinement
(t=-9.44, p<0.001, d=0.22). The percentage of responses that indicated eating out of control either
most of the time or always was higher during home confinement (20.4% vs. 9.7% for most of the
time and 9.6% vs. 2.3% for always).
Question 3 (Q3): Snacking between meals

The number of snacks between meals or late-night snacking estimated by the Q3 (Figure 1)
increased significantly during home confinement (t=-6.89, p<0.001, d=0.30). The percentage of
responses that indicated having a snack between meals or late-night snack either most of the time
or always was higher during home confinement (24.4% vs. 13.9% for most of the time and 15.4%
vs. 6.4% for always).
Question 4 (Q4): Alcohol binge drinking
The score of Q4 (binge alcohol drink; Figure 1) decreased significantly during home confinement
(t=-12.16, p<0.001, d=0.58). In fact, the percentage of responses that indicated alcohol binge
drinking either sometimes, most of the time or always was lower during home confinement (5.4%
vs. 10.1% for sometimes, 1.2% vs. 1.8% for most of the time and 0.2% vs. 0.4% for always).
Question 5 (Q5): Number of main meals/day
The number of main meals estimated by the Q5 (Figure 2) was significantly higher during home
confinement (t=-5.83, p<0.001, d=0.22). The percentage of responses that indicated 4, 5 and more
than 5 main meals were higher during home confinement (14.5% vs. 6.6% for 4 main meals, 6.3%
vs. 2.4% for 5 main meals and 2.8% vs. 0.8% for more than 5 main meals)
Discussion
This report presents the preliminary data from an online survey collected in eight languages,
comparing physical activity (PA) and dietary behaviours before and during home confinement
enforced as a result of COVID-19. There were 1047 replies (54% women) from Western Asia
(36%), North Africa (40%), Europe (21%) and other countries (3%) which revealed that the
COVID-19 home confinement has had a negative effect on all levels of PA (vigorous, moderate,
walking and overall) and an increase in daily sitting time by more than 28%. Additionally, a more

unhealthy pattern of food consumption (the type of food, eating out of control, snacks between
meals and number of meals) was exhibited. Only alcohol binge drinking decreased significantly.
Despite the recommendation that home confinement should not hinder people from being
physically active,19 our results show that there is a decline in all PA levels during the home
confinement enforced during the COVID-19 pandemic. While the effect size is small to medium
for most parameters, the 35% reduction in numbers of days per week walking is medium to large.
In fact, 2.45 days is a serious change, independent from the number of walking days before
confinement. However, the most prominent change was in sitting behaviour, which increased more
than a full standard deviation (very large effect size: d=1.13), most likely due to the increased time
that people were required to stay within the home in the quarantine. Indeed, 29% of the sample
report to sit for 6-8 hours a day during confinement (vs. 24% before), a threshold area for which
Patterson et al.20 assign increased disease and mortality risks. Far more serious was the proportion
of individuals who sat for more than 8 hours a day, which increased from 16% before to 40%
during confinement. Preliminary data indicate that 41% of the sample increased their sitting
behaviour by only 1 hour or less, but this increased by five hours and more for 27% of the sample.
The results of this survey concur with recent studies demonstrating that the current COVID-19
home confinement could dramatically impact lifestyle activities globally, including participation
in sports and PA engagement.21 The restrictions have reduced overall PA (number of days and
number of hours) and access to exercise. In spite of an increased offering of PA guidance and
classes available on social media, our results indicate that it has not been possible for individuals
to adequately maintain their normal PA patterns with home activities. The decline in PA was
accompanied by increased sedentary (sitting) behavior. However, the extent to which PA
participation is impacted by the current COVID-19 pandemic will be linked to the stringency of

the local government confinement policy. It is already been shown in China that different regional
policies and socio-economic factors were associated with differences in PA.1 These factors need to
be considered when design and promoting PA interventions for the COVID-19 pandemic.
The results of this survey also found that, in contrast to the guidance, people changed their eating
behaviors, with increased consumption of unhealthy food, eating out of control, more snacking
between meals and an overall higher number of main meals.22 Regarding dietary behaviours, there
seems to be no single behavioural problem. While a medium effect size (d=0.5) was recorded for
the total score, a small effect sizes was registered for the type of food, number of meals and easting
out of control. The effect size for snacks between meals was medium. Binge drinking alcohol
showed the largest effect size (d=0.58), but, fortunately into the healthy direction, possibly because
of social isolation. In particular, younger individuals are less likely to be surrounded by other
drinking peers.23
The negative changes in the majority of eating behaviours could be attributed to eating out of
anxiety or boredom,9 a dip in motivation to participate in PA or maintain healthy eating24 or an
increase in anxiety or mood driven eating.9 Alternative support for motivation during home
confinement may be sourced from assistive technologies such as apps, streaming services and
social media. To counteract poor dietary behaviours, meal planning and opting for healthy
alternatives is the best approach to combating unhealthy eating habits while in confinement.9
The results reported in this report should be utilised for further research and development in public
health promotion during the COVID-19 pandemic. Motivating people to stand up can be a first step
of health promotion against sedentary behaviour and its risks. In this regard, experiences from
occupational “white collar” health may be translated into the isolation situation at home. Further
research should address (1) insight into sub-populations, for the development of bespoke

interventions to address their needs; (2) interference of diet and PA behaviours, for improving
interventions, and (3) identification of conditions for successfully maintaining a healthy lifestyle
before as well as during isolation.
Although many ideas and recommendations already exist,21,25,26 individuals seem to need more
support to effectively use the services offered and to understand the consequences of inaction.
Technology and social media allow for innovative health behaviour support via fitness applications
and video streaming, motivation and gamification support, and also adding the beneficial social
aspect which is very important to encourage maintenance of physical activity behaviour.
Strengths and limitations
The strengths of this research project include a survey provided in multiple languages, and which
has been widely distributed in several continents. Scientists from different disciplines and many
countries cooperated to make this possible. On the other hand, it should be acknowledged that there
were also limitations of the low-threshold strategy in that it did not allow for narrow target groups
with defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Thus, a collection from a representative sample
cannot be expected. Only during post-hoc studies, can criteria-based sub-samples can be analysed.
The validity of answers is a general problem of online surveys, but we tried to face this by the
differential approach described in the methods section.
Conclusion
The preliminary results of the survey indicate a negative effect of home confinement on PA and a
significant increase in sitting time with a large effect size which is indicative of a more sedentary
lifestyle. These observations have potential important implications that could help PA and
nutritional recommendations to maintain health during the COVID-19 pandemic.
