ABSTRACT
Background: South Africa implemented rapid and strict physical distancing regulations to
minimize SARS-CoV-2 epidemic spread. Evidence on the impact of such measures on
interpersonal contact in rural and lower-income settings is limited.

Methods: We compared population-representative social contact surveys conducted in the
same rural KwaZulu-Natal location once in 2019 and twice in mid-2020. Respondents
reported characteristics of physical and conversational (‘close interaction’) contacts over
24 hours. We built age-mixing matrices and estimated the proportional change in the SARSCoV-2 reproduction number (R0). Respondents also reported counts of others present at
locations visited and transport used, from which we evaluated change in potential
exposure to airborne infection due to shared indoor space (‘shared air’).

Results: Respondents in March-December 2019 (n=1704) reported a mean of 7.4 close
interaction contacts and 196 shared air person-hours beyond their homes. Respondents in
June-July 2020 (n=216), as the epidemic peaked locally, reported 4.1 close interaction
contacts and 21 shared air person-hours outside their home, with significant declines in
others’ homes and public spaces. Adults aged over 50 had fewer close contacts with others
over 50, but little change in contact with 15-29 year olds, reflecting ongoing contact within
multigenerational households. We estimate potential R0 fell by 42% (95% plausible range
14-59%) between 2019 and June-July 2020.

Discussion: Extra-household social contact fell substantially following imposition of Covid19 distancing regulations in rural South Africa. Ongoing contact within intergenerational

INTRODUCTION
The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 in 2020 has harmed populations both directly through
Covid-19 morbidity and mortality, and indirectly via both less support for other health
conditions 1,2 and economic impacts arising from government-imposed and self-directed
reductions in social interaction.3,4 Local physical distancing regulations including
mandatory ‘stay at home’ orders, restrictions on public gatherings, and banning of interhousehold contact have been common during the pandemic.5 Such non-pharmaceutical
interventions (NPI) were variably implemented and enforced in lower-income settings,
notably in sub-Saharan Africa.6 Understanding the impact of both NPIs and personal
decisions is vital to determining trade-offs between epidemic control and non-Covid
wellbeing.
The impact of NPIs is likely to vary substantially across countries, reflecting differences in
both demographic composition and social dynamics. There is particular concern that
official movement limitations may have limited impact in settings where informal work is
common and economic safety nets are limited.7,8 These concerns will be particularly
important if the global pandemic follows the example of past infectious diseases and has its
greatest impact on marginalized and previously disadvantaged populations.9,10
Quantitative data on relevant interpersonal interaction are central to such assessments,
both directly for planning locally relevant evidence-based responses and for
parameterisation of mathematical models of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and control policies.
Movement data from sources linked to smartphones can indicate likely changes in contact
patterns, they do not account for the detailed, non-random social interaction that often

typifies human behaviour,11 and in settings with low smartphone penetration, reliance on
such data can lead to biased results.
Detailed quantitative social contact surveys have been conducted during the Covid-19
pandemic, primarily in higher-income settings. These include online surveys using de novo
convenience recruitment in Europe,12,13 and existing online panels in Europe 14,15 and the
United States.16 Telephonic surveys have been conducted using random digit dialling in
China,17 and existing cohorts in Kenya.18
Maximizing the benefit of these Covid-19 social contact studies requires careful study
design. First, a clear sampling frame rather than a convenience sample allows stronger
inference to a source population. Second, having comparable pre-pandemic data allows a
clear measure of change to be assessed – there is danger of recall bias if questions are
asked retrospectively about pre-pandemic days, and of secular change prior to Covid-19 if
using previously collected data from too long ago. Third, longitudinal data within the
epidemic’s progress allows judgement of the effects of changing policy and compliance
willingness. Fourth, given evidence for aerosolized SARS-CoV-2 transmission,19 adding
information on contact-time occurring in indoor congregate settings and transport can
broaden our understanding of risk.
South Africa implemented an early, stringent national lockdown in March 2020, which may
have initially delayed the national epidemic;20 however regulations were relaxed from May
onwards and case numbers increased rapidly, peaking in July before falling back. In this
paper, we compare data from two studies conducted using comparable study instruments
in 2019 and 2020, both using samples drawn from the same census sampling frame in rural

South Africa. The 2020 data include two rounds of data collection, covering the first wave
of Covid-19 in the local area. We use these data to estimate the reduction in potential
reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 between surveys, and to determine where contact
beyond the home continued during lockdown periods.

METHODS
We used data from two surveys conducted in the southern section of the Africa Health
Research Institute (AHRI) demographic surveillance area in 2019 and 2020. AHRI
maintains an active thrice-yearly census of all households ~21,000 households in this area
of ~850km2 in rural uMkhanyakude district, KwaZulu-Natal province, including one small
town.21 uMkhanyakude ranks among the most deprived districts nationally in terms of
health and socioeconomic status.
The 2019 data were collected as part of Umoya omuhle (UO), a programme exploring novel
approaches to prevention of drug-resistant Mtb transmission in health facilities.22 UO
sampled 3093 census adults (aged 18 and above) residing within the census surveillance
area and the catchment area of two primary care centres (one in town, one rural). Sampling
was random, stratified by residential area (~350 households per area) and with
probability proportional to the number of eligible people in each area, based on the most
recent census conducted prior to area entry. Data collection was conducted March to
December 2019 at respondents’ homes.
The 2020 data were collected as part of a longitudinal Covid-19 surveillance project.23 The
Covid Social Contact (CSC) sub-study used an age/sex stratified sample of one person aged

15 and above from each of 400 census households. Inclusion criteria included participation
in Vuk’uzazi, a recent population-wide chronic health screening study,24 allowing
intentional oversampling of individuals with locally prevalent health conditions
(tuberculosis, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, COPD or asthma). Contact was made
telephonically based on previously provided numbers. We analysed two rounds of data
collected between 3 June and 16 July (2020 R1), and 16 July and 17 August (2020 R2), as
Covid-19 peaked in KwaZulu-Natal (Figure 1).
Both studies used structured electronic REDCap interviews (Supplementary Material 1).
After confirming socio-demographic characteristics, respondents were asked to report on
three forms of in-person social interaction. First, they were asked to list all indoor locations
visited over a 24-hour period. UO asked about a randomly selected day in the past week;
CSC asked about the day prior to interview, limiting data largely to Sunday to Thursday.
Follow up questions covered the type of location, length of time spent there and the
number of people present. Second, respondents were asked who they had directly
interacted with over the 24-hour period – involving either physical contact or a minimumthree-word conversation. Respondents were then for each ‘close interaction contact’ asked
to report their ages and sexes and the duration of time spent together; UO asked these
follow-up questions about a random 10 contacts, or all contacts if 10 or fewer were
reported while CSC asked about all contacts. Third, respondents were asked about any
transport used over the past day, and then how long any trips took and many people
shared the transport with them. CSC only asked buildings and transport questions to a
random half of sampled individuals per round.

Statistical analyses
We grouped respondents and their close interaction contacts by age into four categories
(15-29, 30-49, 50-64 and 65+) and described respondent characteristics for each survey
round. All subsequent analyses weighted the data for sampling and non-response to match
the census population and to make methods comparable across surveys (further details in
Supplementary Material 2). We first calculated the mean number of close interaction
contacts per person per day by respondent characteristics (sex, age, household size) and by
whether the contact was a household member. We then built social contact age mixing
matrices for each round, adjusting our raw results to ensure that the matrices were
symmetric using the census population age structure. From these values we calculated the
change between 2019 and each 2020 round.
In the absence of a robust estimate of the basic reproduction number (R0) for SARS-CoV-2
in rural South Africa without social distancing (i.e., with 2019 social contact patterns), we
estimated the relative reduction in R0 between rounds, assuming the per-contact
transmission probability remained constant. (Actual reductions will have been greater to
the extent that face coverage increased in 2020 but we cannot precisely estimate either the
degree to which this occurred, especially within households, or the degree of protection
conferred.) For our estimated reduction we used the next generation matrix of the agecontact matrix, defining R0 as the dominant eigenvalue. To assess uncertainty, we
generated mean and 95% plausible intervals using 10,000 independent bootstrapped
samples of each survey, and calculated the relative reduction in each pair of samples. The
bootstrapped samples were generated by re-sampling respondents with replacement

within age categories, and re-sampling contacts with replacement from the set of all
contacts of the respondent.25
Finally, we calculated the change in potential exposure to airborne infection using location
and transport data by calculating for each respondent per day: the proportion who visited
any location/transport type; mean hours spent in the location if visited; mean people
present per visit; mean ‘shared air person-hours’ if visited; and finally mean shared air
person-hours across all respondents. For this analysis we merged the two CSC rounds since
each respondent provided one datapoint. We tested for significant differences in each
measure using logistic or linear bivariate regression including indicator variables for study
round.
We conducted several sensitivity analyses: i) including only data on Sundays to Thursdays,
giving each day equal weight, to compare only same-day data across the two surveys; ii)
excluding respondents with any missing close interaction contact age data; iii) excluding
close interaction contacts of less than 15 minutes duration, as the probability of
transmission is lower for shorter contact durations; iv) incorporating children into our
analysis, using UO and CSC data on adult-reported contact with children, and past South
African data about child-child contacts; (v) including only individuals aged ≥18, to make the
two datasets comparable on age range; (vi) limiting UO data to the period June-August
2019 to ensure seasonal comparability; (vii) weighted the 2019 data to the full census
population based on urbanicity (further details in Supplementary Material 2).

Tropical Medicine (14640); ethical approval for CSC was granted by UKZN BREC
(BE290/16) and University College London REC (15231/013). Informed consent for
participation was recorded in writing for UO and telephonically for CSC.

RESULTS
Of the 3093 people sampled for UO, 1723 (56%) were successfully contacted, 299 (10%)
were dead or reported to have out-migrated, and 1071 (35%) could not be contacted. Of
those successfully contacted, 1704 (99%) completed an interview. Of the 400 individuals
sampled for CSC, 27 (7%) were dead or had out-migrated, and 102 (26%) could not be
contacted. Of those successfully contacted, 216 (80%) completed an interview. At R2
follow-up, 202 of the 216 (94%) completed a second interview and eight previously
uncontactable individuals were reached for a first interview. The raw age-sex structures of
UO and CSC differed from one-another by design (Table 1).
The mean number of close interaction contacts varied little by respondent age, sex or
household size within rounds, although numbers were lower in the highest age group, and
were positively associated with household size (Table 2). Respondents reported a mean of
7.4 close interaction contacts in 2019 (95%CI: 7.1-7.7), 4.1 (95%CI: 3.5-4.6) in 2020 R1 and
4.3 (95%CI: 3.8-4.8) in 2020 R2. Contact reductions were larger for non-household than
household member contacts in both absolute and relative terms. Non-household contacts
fell from 2.8 (95%CI 2.6-3.1) in 2019 to 0.7 (95%CI 0.4-1.1) in 2020 R1 and 0.5 (95% CI
0.3-0.7) in 2020 R2. Household contacts fell from 4.6 (95% CI 4.5-4.8) in 2019 to 3.4 (95%
CI 2.9-3.8) in 2020 R1 and 3.8 (95% CI 3.3-4.3) in 2020 R2.

In 2019 weighted age-mixing matrices, older individuals had fewer close interaction
contacts than younger ones, and contact rates for each age group under 65 were highest
within the same age group. By June/July 2020 (2020 R1), contact rates were lower for all
age combinations, in most cases statistically significantly. The drop was greatest for contact
between those aged 65+, and smallest for contact between those aged 15-29 and 50-64.
The drops in contacts adults reported having with children were lower than for between
adults, and in most adult age groups the data were consistent with no change in contact
rates between adults and children (Supplementary Material 3, panel 4). Contact patterns by
age changed little between 2020 R1 and R2. The estimated reduction in R0 between 2019
and 2020 R1 was 45% (95% plausible range 14-59%), and between 2019 and 2020 R2 was
45% (95% plausible range 24-61%) (Figure 2a-c).
Sharing of indoor space more generally also fell between 2019 and mid-2020: mean shared
air person-time beyond respondents’ own homes (including transport) fell from 196 to 21
hours (Table 3). Mean time spent at one’s own home rose by almost three hours per day,
from an average of 19 to 22 hours, although there was no significant change in personcontact hours. All other location types except public transport saw substantially reduced
overall person-contact hours, largely due to fewer people present in the location, rather
than changes in the time spent per visit. The proportion of people reporting clinic visits
almost doubled, from 2.3% to 4.3%, although the change was not significant (p=0.20). The
proportion of respondents who reported visiting other people’s households and ‘other’
locations fell, from 27% to 6%, and 32% to 24%, respectively.

Our sensitivity analyses did not substantively change our conclusions (Supplementary
Material 3). Estimated reductions in R0 between 2019 and 2020 R1 and 2020 R2 ranged
from 40-50% and 38-48% respectively in the sensitivity analyses, compared to 42% and
45% respectively in the primary analysis. Excluding Fridays/Saturdays, contacts under 15
minutes, respondents with any missing contact age data or those aged 15-17 had no
qualitative effect on age-mixing patterns. Adding children to the analysis highlighted the
large number of contacts adults had with children pre-Covid, but did not affect the
estimated reduction in R0 between 2019 and 2020. However, it was notable that adults’
close personal contact with children fell by less than almost any other age combination,
looking similar to the pattern between 15-29 and 50-64 year olds.

DISCUSSION
We compared rates of close interaction contact and time spent with others indoors or on
transport from surveys conducted in the same rural South African setting, both pre-Covid19 in 2019 and during the first wave of cases in mid-2020. We found substantial declines in
close contact numbers and in time spent at most indoor locations other than respondents’
own homes by 2020, suggesting that the combination of government NPIs and the ongoing
epidemic substantially affected behaviour. Under the assumptions that close interaction
contacts are the most important for infection transmission, and qualitatively the same in
both years, we estimate a 42-45% reduction in the likely basic reproduction number
between the two surveys. Given the substantial level of use of face coverings outside the
home required and observed in South Africa,26 this reduction is likely to be an
underestimate.

While it is difficult to disentangle the effects of NPIs and the state of the local epidemic, the
fact that much of the decline between 2019 and 2020 was present by the first interview
round – the majority of which occurred prior to the local mass arrival of Covid-19 –
suggests that respondents in this area were complying with government mobility NPIs. By
June and July these had been relaxed somewhat from the initial strict stay-at-home
requirements, but entertainment and alcohol availability remained highly limited. The
continuation of limited close interaction contact, even as NPIs were relaxed into August
and beyond, highlights that the changes made in response to NPIs were maintained
subsequently; it is hard to tell whether this was due to increased concern due to
widespread local transmission or slow adjustment to changing policies.
Declines in close interaction contact were not homogenous. The age group with the
greatest decreases in contact were those aged over 65, particularly for contact with others
aged 50 and older, with declines of around three-quarters compared to pre-Covid. In
contrast, the lowest declines were seen between those aged 15-29 and older adults –
particularly those aged 30-49 years, i.e. one generation older. This pattern reflects the
notably larger decline in non-household member contacts compared to household
members in combination with the common presence of multiple adult generations within
each household. This finding is similar that seen in other contact studies of rural Africans
27,

and highlights the likely difficulty of protecting those most vulnerable to Covid-19 in

settings such as this. A fuller understanding of the implications of these ongoing withinhousehold intergenerational contacts will require focused qualitative work to determine
whether young adults living in multigenerational households are able to maintain some
social distance within houses, and how to potentially target messages to this population.

To consider the implications of behaviour change for an infection with aerosol
transmission potential, we also measured time spent in indoor locations, and numbers of
people present. Unsurprisingly, we found that time spent at home rose, while shared
person-time spent in other homes dropped by 89% and at ‘other locations’ (largely school,
work and shops) by 94%. This reduced potential for exposure in both public and private
suggests that people are following rules both when they can and cannot be seen; these data
are also consistent with other evidence from this area of reduced mobility in July and
August compared even to earlier in 2020 26. Our respondents reported similar time spent
attending health clinics in the two years, but reported that fewer others were present when
they attended in 2020, perhaps reflecting improved social distancing policies within clinics.
Overall, our indoor location data suggested nuanced decision-making by respondents
during Covid-19, reducing less vital trips but maintaining necessary ones.
Even prior to Covid-19, the numbers of close interaction contacts reported in this area was
substantially lower than that seen elsewhere in Africa.18,27-30 Low numbers of contacts may
reflect the very large proportion of our respondents’ days spent at home – a mean of 19
hours in 2019 and almost 22 hours in 2020. This lack of mobility reflects very high local
unemployment – under 25% of resident working-aged adults reported employment during
the late-2019 demographic census. As a result, while household contact numbers are
comparable to other African studies, contacts beyond the household appear to be
substantially lower. In the context of a South African first wave of the Covid-19 epidemic
that saw much smaller outbreaks in rural than urban areas, this lower baseline suggests a
low rural R0 even before individuals increased their social distance.

Strengths and limitations
There are limitations to this study. As with any observational study of human behaviour,
care must be taken in generalising to other populations. While the pre-Covid-19 contact
patterns we show here are consistent with those elsewhere in rural Africa,27 as are the
changes seen with the arrival of Covid-19,18 it is important to consider whether close
contact patterns in rural lower-income settings may have different implications for disease
prevention than patterns seen elsewhere.
In contrast to social contact surveys that used prospective diaries to capture information,
we relied on recent recall – this may have led to some misreporting, but the delay was in all
cases less than one week, limiting this concern. Our data were also self-reported rather
than, for example, based on proximity detectors or mobility tracking. Self-report can lead to
misreporting, although this effect is unlikely to have affected measures of change since we
used the same approach for both years. Self-report also has the benefit of providing richer
data on the nature of each interaction. Conversely, we kept our questionnaires brief to
minimize respondent fatigue, and as a result we do not have certain details about each
contact, including whether a facemask was used during each interaction.
There are substantial strengths to this work. We were able to compare two studies with
respondents drawn from the same well-defined sampling frame asking very similar
questions about behaviour both shortly before and after the arrival of Covid-19 in the study
area. The availability of longitudinal response data during the Covid-19 outbreak allowed
us to observe behaviour changed as government NPIs and epidemic situations changed;

although while patterns of behaviour over time can suggest effects, we cannot prove
causality, something important if using our findings to design preventative interventions.

Conclusion
In comparable surveys about social contacts conducted in the same rural South African
location in 2019 and mid-2020, we find substantial declines in close physical and
conversational contacts, and also in beyond-household sharing of indoor space. These
findings suggest that the strict government NPIs implemented to mitigate the Covid-19
epidemic, in combination with the arrival of the epidemic itself in the local area, led to
highly protective behaviours. It will be important to triangulate these findings with other
information on the wider impact of such behaviour.

Social contacts 2020

We will now ask you to remember who you have been in contact with yesterday,
between 5am yesterday and 5am today. We are only interested in direct
contacts, which are people who you met in person and with whom you
exchanged at least a few words, or with whom you had physical contact (e.g. a
handshake, embracing, kissing, contact sports). Note that if you only spoke to
someone over the phone or internet, they should not be included.

Please write the nickname of each other person in your household. Note that this
nickname is only needed to make it easier for you to complete the survey, so
please pick a nickname that will help you identify each household member later
in the questionnaire. Nicknames are not visible to anyone outside of this survey.

And what other people did you have direct contact with in person, between 5am
yesterday and 5am today? Please think about anyone else you had direct contact
with. This could include friends, family, work colleagues, or people you spoke to
in shops and so on. The order in which you give these names does not matter.
However, it is easiest to give them in chronological order, e.g. when I woke up, I
saw Busi and Thabo at breakfast. I then drove to my work, where I met with
Thandiwe and Sfiso. On my way back home, I stopped at a petrol station, where I
had a brief chat with the shop assistant. Etc.
Please write the nickname of each person you had direct contact with. Note that
this nickname is only needed to make it easier for you to complete the survey, so
please pick a nickname that will help you identify each contact later in the

Weighting
To ensure both comparability across surveys and meaningfulness of results we weighted
all our observed data to match the demographic surveillance area census population from
which respondents were drawn. Additionally, for the UO data, when using contact
characteristics, for respondents naming more than 10 contacts, we resampled from the 10
random contacts upon which more detailed information was provided, up to the total
number of reported contacts. For the 2020 CSC data, we weighted respondents to account
for stratified sampling and non-response by age, sex, comorbidity status, to match the
Vuk’uzazi respondent sample. We then further weighted by age and sex to account for
Vuk’uzazi non-response, to reach the census distribution. The UO data was weighted to the
same age and sex distribution. As no respondents aged 15-17 were interviewed in the UO
survey, respondents aged 18-29 were assumed to be representative of 15-29 year olds in
the main analysis. Finally, we weighted responses by day of week, so that weekdays
accounted for 5/7 of all observations, and weekends the remainder.
Age-mixing matrices were made symmetrical by setting the estimated rate of contact
between each person in age group i and age group j equal to mean of the rates reported by
respondents in each age group, using the age distribution of the census population to
calculate the rates.

Management of incomplete data
Some respondents reported not knowing some or all of their contacts’ ages. We excluded
from all the age-mixing matrices and R0 estimates any respondent who gave this response
for all their close contacts in a round (n=2 in UO, n=10 in CSC R1, n=6 in CSC R2). People
with missing data for all of their close contacts had a slightly lower mean number of close
contacts (mean of 1.5 vs 7.3 in UO,mean of 3.5 vs 4.0 in CSC R1, mean of 3.2 vs 4.0 in CSC
R2; all unweighted); this may reflect them being less engaged with the survey or a
genuinely lower number of contacts. For respondents giving only some ages, we
upweighted the known-aged contacts for the respondents to replace missing-age ones in
the ‘best estimate’ age-mixing matrices, and excluded missing-age contacts from the
resampling process when estimating confidence intervals for the age mixing matrices and
when estimating the relative R0 reduction (while keeping the total number of contacts to
sample for each respondent equal to the total number of contacts reported).
For the transport and location analysis, we excluded respondents reporting no location in
the past 24-hours (including their own home) as implausible (n=1 in UO; n=1 R1, n=6 R2 in
CSC). We used the same weights as for the close contact analyses.

Sensitivity analyses
For the analysis incorporating children: Since we ignored contacts aged under 15 in our
primary analysis, because they were not eligible for either survey, we incorporated
children into our analysis using the data on contacts with children reported by adults to
calculate contact rates between children and adults. As we had no data on contact rates
between children, we used data from a previous social contact study in South Africa to

estimate these, making the assumption that the ratio of contact rates between 0-14 year
old and contact rates between 15-29 year olds was the same (Johnstone-Robertson, Mark
et al. 2011). In estimating R0, we also assumed that the probability of infection per contact
was 44% lower for children than for adults (Viner, Mytton et al. 2020).
For the analysis excluding 15-17 year olds: As exact contact ages were not collected in CSC,
we assumed that the proportion of all contacts aged 15-19 who were aged 18-19 was
proportional to the proportion of the census population aged 15-19 who were aged 18-19.
