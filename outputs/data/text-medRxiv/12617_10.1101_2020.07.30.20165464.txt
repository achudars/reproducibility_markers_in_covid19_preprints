Abstract

Objectives

To develop and validate a pragmatic risk score to predict mortality for patients admitted to

hospital with covid-19.

Design

Prospective observational cohort study: ISARIC WHO CCP-UK study (ISARIC Coronavirus Clinical

Characterisation Consortium [4C]). Model training was performed on a cohort of patients recruited
between 6 February and 20 May 2020, with validation conducted on a second cohort of patients
recruited between 21 May and 29 June 2020.

Setting

260 hospitals across England, Scotland, and Wales.

Participants

Adult patients (≥18 years) admitted to hospital with covid-19 admitted at least four weeks

before final data extraction.

Main outcome measures
Results

In-hospital mortality.

There were 34 692 patients included in the derivation dataset (mortality rate 31.7%) and 22 454

in the validation dataset (mortality 31.5%). The final 4C Mortality Score included eight variables readily
available at initial hospital assessment: age, sex, number of comorbidities, respiratory rate, peripheral
oxygen saturation, level of consciousness, urea, and C-reactive protein (score range 0-21 points). The 4C
risk stratification score demonstrated high discrimination for mortality (derivation cohort: AUROC 0.79;
95% CI 0.78 - 0.79; validation cohort 0.78, 0.77-0.79) with excellent calibration (slope = 1.0). Patients
with a score ≥15 (n = 2310, 17.4%) had a 67% mortality (i.e., positive predictive value 67%) compared
with 1.0% mortality for those with a score

≤3 (n = 918, 7%; negative predictive value 99%).

Discriminatory performance was higher than 15 pre-existing risk stratification scores (AUROC range
0.60-0.76), with scores developed in other covid-19 cohorts often performing poorly (range 0.63-0.73).

Conclusions

We have developed and validated an easy-to-use risk stratification score based on

commonly available parameters at hospital presentation. This outperformed existing scores,
demonstrated utility to directly inform clinical decision making, and can be used to stratify inpatients
with covid-19 into different management groups. The 4C Mortality Score may help clinicians identify
patients with covid-19 at high risk of dying during current and subsequent waves of the pandemic.

Introduction
Disease resulting from infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),
has a high mortality rate with deaths predominantly due to respiratory failure.

1

th

As of 30

there are over 17 million confirmed cases worldwide and at least 660 000 deaths.

2,3

July 2020,

As hospitals around

the world are faced with an influx of patients with covid-19, there is an urgent need for a pragmatic risk
stratification tool that will allow the early identification of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 who are at
the highest risk of death, to guide management and optimise resource allocation.

Prognostic scores attempt to transform complex clinical pictures into tangible numerical values.
Prognostication is more difficult when dealing with a severe pandemic illness such as covid-19, as strain
on healthcare resources and rapidly evolving treatments alter the risk of death over time. Early
information has suggested that the clinical course of a patient with covid-19 is different from that of
pneumonia, seasonal influenza or sepsis.

4

The majority of patients with severe covid-19 have developed

a clinical picture characterised by pneumonitis, profound hypoxia, and systemic inflammation affecting
multiple organs.

1

A recent review identified many prognostic scores used for covid-19,

5

which varied in their setting,

predicted outcome measure, and the clinical parameters included. The large number of risk
stratification tools reflects difficulties in their application, with most scores demonstrating moderate
performance at best and no benefit to clinical decision-making.

6,7

It has been found that many novel

covid-19 prognostic scores have a high risk of bias, which may reflect development in small cohorts, and
many have been published without clear details of model derivation and testing.

5

To our knowledge, a

risk stratification tool is yet to be developed and validated within a large national cohort of hospitalised
patients with covid-19.

Our aim was to develop and validate a pragmatic, clinically relevant risk stratification score using
routinely available clinical information at hospital presentation to predict in-hospital mortality in
hospitalised covid-19 patients and then compare this with existing prognostic models.

Methods

Study design and setting
The International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infections Consortium (ISARIC) WHO Clinical
Characterisation Protocol UK (CCP-UK) study is an ongoing prospective cohort study in 260 acute care
hospitals across England, Scotland, and Wales (National Institute for Health Research Clinical Research
Network Central Portfolio Management System ID: 14152) performed by the ISARIC Covid-19 Clinical
Characterisation Consortium (ISARIC-4C). The protocol and further study details are available online.

8

Model development and reporting followed the Transparent Reporting of a multivariate prediction
mode for Individual Prediction or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) guidelines.

9

The study was performed according to

a pre-defined protocol (Appendix 1).

Participants
Patients aged ≥18 years old with a completed index admission to one of 260 hospitals in England,
Scotland, or Wales were included.

8

Reverse transcriptase-PCR was the only mode of testing available

during the period of study. The decision to test was at the discretion of the clinician attending the
patient, and not defined by protocol. The enrolment criterion “high likelihood of infection” reflected
that a preparedness protocol cannot assume a diagnostic test will be available for an emergent
pathogen. In this activation, site training emphasised importance of only recruiting proven cases.

Data collection
Demographic, clinical and outcomes data were collected using a pre-specified case report form.
Comorbidities were defined according to a modified Charlson Comorbidity Index

10

; those collected were:

chronic cardiac disease; chronic respiratory disease (excluding asthma); chronic renal disease (estimated
glomerular filtration rate ≤30); mild-to-severe liver disease; dementia; chronic neurological conditions;
connective tissue disease; diabetes mellitus (diet, tablet or insulin-controlled); HIV/AIDS, and
malignancy. These were selected a priori by a global consortium to provide rapid, coordinated clinical
investigation of patients presenting with any severe or potentially severe acute infection of public
interest and enabled standardisation.

Clinician-defined obesity was also included as a comorbidity due its likely association with adverse
outcomes in patients with covid-19.

11,12

Patients with missing data on all comorbidities were assumed to

have no comorbidities. The clinical information used to calculate prognostic scores was taken from the
day of admission to hospital.

13

No generally accepted approaches exist to estimate sample size

requirements for derivation and validation studies of risk prediction models. We used all available data
to maximise the power and generalisability of our results. Model reliability was enhanced by our use of a
validation cohort and sensitivity analyses

Outcomes
The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. This outcome was selected due to the importance of the
early identification of patients likely to develop severe illness from SARS-CoV-2 infection (a ‘rule in’ test).
We chose a priori to restrict analysis of outcomes to patients who were admitted more than four weeks
before final data extraction (29

th

June 2020) to enable most patients to complete their hospital

admission.

Independent predictor variables
A reduced set of potential predictor variables was selected a priori including patient demographic
information, common clinical investigations, and parameters consistently identified as clinically
important in covid-19 cohorts following methodology described by Wynants et al.
variables were selected based on three common criteria:

14

5

Candidate predictor

(1) patient and clinical variables known to

influence outcome in pneumonia and flu-like illness; (2) clinical biomarkers previously identified within
the literature as potential predictors in covid-19 patients; and (3) values were available for at least twothirds of patients within the derivation cohort.

With the overall aim to develop an easy-to-use risk stratification score, an a priori decision was made to
include an overall comorbidity count for each patient within model development giving each
comorbidity equal weight, rather than individual comorbidities. Recent evidence suggests an additive
effect of comorbidity in covid-19 patients, with increasing number of comorbidities associated with
poorer outcomes.

15

Model development
Models were trained using all available data up to 20

th

May 2020. The primary intention was to create a

pragmatic model for bedside use not requiring complex equations, online calculators, or mobile
applications. An a priori decision was therefore made to categorise continuous variables in the final
prognostic score.

A three-stage model building process was used (Figure 1). Firstly, generalised additive models (GAMs)
were built incorporating continuous smoothed predictors (thin-plate splines) in combination with
categorical predictors as linear components. A criterion-based approach to variable selection was taken
based on the deviance explained, the unbiased risk estimator, and the area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve (AUROC) (see Appendix 2).

Secondly, plots of component smoothed continuous predictors were visually inspected for linearity and

16

optimal cut-points were selected using the methods of Barrio et al.

Lastly, final models using categorised variables were specified using least absolute shrinkage and
selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression. L1-penalised coefficients were derived using 10-fold
cross-validation to select the value of lambda (minimised cross-validated sum of squared residuals).
Shrunk coefficients were converted to a prognostic index with appropriate scaling to create the
pragmatic “4C” Mortality Score (where 4C stands for Coronavirus Clinical Characterisation Consortium).

Machine learning approaches were used in parallel for comparison of predictive performance. Given
issues with interpretability, this was intended to provide a “best-in-class” comparison of predictive
performance when accounting for any complex underlying interactions. Extreme gradient boosting trees
were used (XGBoost). All candidate predictor variables identified were included within the model, with
the exception of those with high missing values (>33%). Individual major comorbidity variables, defined
as chronic cardiac disease; chronic respiratory disease (excluding asthma); chronic renal disease

2

(estimated glomerular filtration rate ≤30 mL/min/1.73m ); moderate-to-severe liver failure (presence of
portal hypertension); diabetes mellitus (diet, tablet or insulin-controlled) and solid malignancy, together
with obesity, were retained within the model to determine whether their inclusion enhanced predictive
performance. An 80%/20% random split of the derivation dataset was used to define train/test sets. The
validation datasets were held back and not used in the training process. A mortality label and design
matrix of centred/standardised continuous and categorical variables including all candidate variables
was used to train gradient boosted trees minimising the binary classification error rate (defined as
number wrong cases / number all cases). Hyperparameters were tuned including the learning rate and
maximum tree depth to maximise the AUROC in the test set.

Discrimination was assessed for all above models (4C and XGBoost model) using the AUROC in the
derivation cohort, with 95% confidence intervals (CI) calculated using bootstrapping resampling (2000
samples). An AUROC value of 0.5 indicates no predictive ability, 0.8 is considered good, and 1.0 is
perfect.

17

Overall goodness-of-fit was assessed with the Brier score,

18

a measure to quantify how close

predictions are to the truth ranging between 0 and 1, where smaller values indicate superior model
performance. We plotted model calibration curves to examine agreement between predicted and
observed risk across deciles of mortality risk to ascertain the presence of over- or under-prediction. Risk
cut-off values were defined by the total point score for an individual which represented a low (<2%
mortality rate), intermediate (2-14.9%) or high-risk (≥15%) groups, similar to commonly used pneumonia
risk stratification scores.

19,20

Sensitivity analyses of missing values in potential candidate variables were performed using multiple
imputation by chained equations, under the missing at random assumption. Ten sets, each with 10
iterations, were imputed using available explanatory variables for both cohorts (derivation and
validation). The outcome variable was included as a predictor in the derivation but not validation
dataset. Model derivation was explored in imputed datasets. All models developed in the complete case
derivation dataset were tested in the imputed validation dataset, with Rubin’s rules

21

used to combine

model parameter estimates.

Model validation
Patients entered subsequently into the ISARIC WHO CCP-UK study after 20

th

May 2020 were included in

a separate validation cohort (Figure 1). We determined discrimination, calibration, and performance
across a range of clinically relevant metrics. To avoid bias in the assessment of outcomes, patients who
admitted within four weeks prior to data extraction on 29

th

June 2020 were excluded.

A sensitivity analysis was also performed, with stratification of the validation cohort by geographical
location. This geographical categorisation was selected based on well-described economic and health
inequalities between the north and south of the UK.

22,23

Recent analysis has demonstrated the impact of

deprivation on risk of dying with covid-19.

24

As a result, population differences between regions may

change the discriminatory performance of risk stratification scores. Two geographical cohorts were
created, based on north-south geographical locations across the United Kingdom as defined by Hacking

22

et al.

A further sensitivity analysis was performed to determine model performance in ethnic minority

groups, given reported differences in covid-19 outcomes.

25

All tests were two-tailed and p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. We used R (version
3.6.3) with the finalfit, glmnet, pROC, recipes, xgboost, rmda, and tidyverse packages for all statistical
analysis.

Comparison with existing risk stratification scores
All derived models in the derivation dataset were compared within the validation cohort with existing
scores. Model performance was assessed using the AUROC statistic, sensitivity, specificity, positive
predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). Existing risk stratification scores were
identified through a systematic literature search of EMBASE, WHO Medicus, and Google Scholar
databases. We used the search terms “pneumonia”, “sepsis”, “influenza”, “COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV-2”,
“coronavirus” combined with “score”’ and “prognosis”. We applied no language or date restrictions. The
last search was performed on 1

st

July 2020. Risk stratification tools were included whose variables were

available within the database and had accessible methodology for calculation.

Performance characteristics were calculated according to original publications, and score cut-offs for
adverse outcomes were selected based on the most commonly used criteria identified during the
literature search. Cut-offs were the score value for which the patient was considered at low- or high-risk
of adverse outcome, as defined by study authors. Patients with one or more missing input variables
were omitted for that particular score.

A decision curve analysis (DCA) was also performed.

26

Briefly, assessment of the adequacy clinical

prediction models can be extended by determining clinical utility. Using DCA, a clinical judgment of the
relative value of benefits (treating a true positive) and harms (treating a false positive) associated with a
clinical prediction tool can be made. The standardised net benefit was plotted against the threshold
probability for considering a patient “high risk” for age alone and the best discriminating models
applicable to >50% of patients in the validation cohort.

Patient and public involvement
This was an urgent public health research study in response to a Public Health Emergency of
International Concern. Patients or the public were not involved in the design, conduct, or reporting of
this rapid response research.

Results
In the derivation cohort, we collected data from 34 692 patients between 6

th

February 2020 and 20

th

May 2020. The overall mortality was 31.7% (10 998 patients). The median age of patients in the cohort
was 74 (interquartile range (IQR) 59-83) years. 58.3% (20 184) were male and 75.3% (26 135) patients
had at least one comorbidity. Demographic and clinical characteristics for the derivation and validation
datasets are shown in Table 1.

Model development
In total, 41 candidate predictor variables measured at hospital admission were identified for model
creation (Figure 1; Appendix 2). Following the creation of a composite variable containing all seven
individual comorbidities and the exclusion of 13 variables due to high levels of missing values (Appendix
3), 21 variables remained.

Generalised additive modelling (GAM) identified eight important predictors of mortality; age, sex,
number of comorbidities, respiratory rate, peripheral oxygen saturation, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS),
urea, and C-reactive protein (CRP) (for variable selection process, see Appendix 4). Given the a priori
need for a pragmatic score for use at the bedside, continuous variables were converted to factors with
cut-points chosen using component smoothed functions (on linear predictor scale) from GAM model
(Appendix 5).

On entering variables into a penalised logistic regression model (LASSO), all variables were retained
within the final model (Appendix 6). Penalised regression coefficients were converted into a prognostic
index using appropriate scaling (4C Mortality Score range 0-21 points; Table 2).

The 4C Mortality Score demonstrated good discrimination for in-patient death within the derivation
cohort (Table 3) with performance that approached that of the XGBoost model. The 4C Mortality Score
showed good calibration (Calibration slope = 1; Figure 2) across the range of risk and no adjustment to
the model was required.

Model validation
The validation cohort included data from 22 454 patients collected between 21

st

May 2020 and 29

th

June

2020 who had at least four weeks follow-up. The overall mortality was 28.6% (10 998 patients). The
median age of patients in the cohort was 76 (interquartile range (IQR) 60-85) years. 12 202 (54.4%) were
male and 16 930 patients (75.4%) had at least one comorbidity (Table 1). Missing data for predictor
variables within the validation cohort are summarised in Appendix 7.

Discrimination of the 4C Mortality Score in the validation cohort was similar to that of the XGBoost
model. Calibration was also found to be excellent in the validation cohort (Calibration slope = 1;
Appendix 8), with a similar Brier score to the derivation cohort (0.174). The 4C Mortality Score
demonstrated good performance in clinically relevant metrics, across a range of cut-offs (Table 4).

Four risk groups were defined with corresponding mortality rates determined (Table 5): low risk (0-3
score; mortality rate 1.0%), intermediate risk (4-8 score; 9.8%), high risk (9-14 score; 35.2%), and very
high risk (≥15 score; 66.8%). Performance metrics demonstrated a high sensitivity (99.8%) and negative
predictive value (NPV; 99.0%) for the low-risk group, covering 6.9% of the cohort and a corresponding
mortality rate of 1.0%. Patients in the intermediate risk group (score 4-8; n = 3007, 22.7%) had a
mortality rate of 9.8% (NPV 90.2%). High-risk patients (score 9-14; n = 7009, 52.9%) had a 35.2%
mortality (NPV 64.8), while patients scoring ≥15 (n = 2310, 17.4%) had a 66.8% mortality (positive
predictive value 66.8%).

Comparison with existing tools
A total of 15 risk stratification scores were identified through a systematic literature search

6,20,27–39

The

4C Mortality Score compared well against existing risk stratification scores in predicting inpatient
mortality (Table 6). Risk stratification scores originally validated in patients with community-acquired
pneumonia (n = 9) generally had higher discrimination for inpatient mortality in the validation cohort
(e.g., A-DROP [AUROC 0.74; 95%CI 0.73-0.75], E-CURB65 [0.76; 0.74-0.79]) (Figure 3A) than those
developed within covid-19 cohorts (n = 4: Surgisphere [0.63; 0.62-0.64], DL score [0.67; 0.66-0.68],
COVID-GRAM [0.71; 0.68-0.74] and Xie score [0.73; 0.71-0.76]). Performance metrics for the 4C
Mortality Score compared well against existing risk stratification scores at specified cut-offs (Appendix
10).

The number of patients in whom risk stratification scores could be applied differed due to certain
variables not being available, either due to missingness or because they were not tested for/recorded in
clinical practice. Seven scores could be applied to fewer than 2000 patients (<10%) in the validation
cohort, due to the requirement for biomarkers or physiological parameters that were not routinely
captured (e.g. lactate dehydrogenase [LDH]).

Decision curve analysis demonstrated that the 4C Mortality Score had better clinical utility across the
range of threshold risks compared with the best performing existing scores applicable to >50% of the
validation cohort (A-DROP and CURB65).

Sensitivity analysis
Multiple imputation was performed in both the derivation and validation cohorts (predictor variables n
= 41). Prognostic models derived using from the multiply imputed derivation cohort had poorer
performance than models derived using complete case data. This was true whether performance was
assessed in the complete case or multiply imputed validation datasets. As a sensitivity analysis, the final
model was assessed in the multiply imputed datasets. Discriminatory performance demonstrated a

≤

small reduction ( 0.02 change in AUROC) (Appendix 11) across both derivation and validation cohorts.

After stratification of the validation cohort into two geographical cohorts (validation north and south;
Appendix 12), discrimination remained similar for the 4C Mortality Score in both the North (AUROC 0.78,
95%CI 0.77-0.79) and South (0.77, 0.76-0.79) subsets (Appendix 13).

Discussion

Principal findings
We have developed and validated the eight-variable 4C Mortality Score for in-patient death in a UK
prospective cohort of 57 146 patients hospitalised with covid-19. The 4C Mortality Score uses patient
demographics, clinical observations, and blood parameters that are commonly available at the time of
hospital admission and can accurately predict patients at a high risk of in-hospital death. It compared
favourably to other models, including ‘best-in-class’ machine learning techniques and demonstrated
consistent performance across the validation cohorts including good clinical utility in a decision curve
analysis.

Model performance compared well against other generated models, with minimal loss in discrimination
despite its pragmatic nature. A machine learning approach demonstrated a marginal improvement in
discrimination, but at the cost of interpretability, the requirement for many more input variables, and
the requirement for an app/website calculator limiting use at the bedside. The 4C Mortality Score
demonstrated good applicability within the validation cohort (around 60% population) and consistency
across all performance measures.

Comparison with other studies
The 4C Mortality Score contains parameters reflecting patient demographics, comorbidity, physiology,
and inflammation on hospital admission. It shares characteristics with existing prognostic scores for
sepsis and community-acquired pneumonia, as well as for scores developed in covid-19 patients. Altered
consciousness and high respiratory rate are included in most risk stratification scores for sepsis and
community-acquired pneumonia,

19,20,27,28,31,32,35

while elevated urea is also a common component.

19,20,27

Increasing age is a strong predictor of inpatient mortality within our hospitalised covid-19 cohort and is
commonly included in other existing covid-19 scores,
CRP.

36,40,41

together with comorbidity

36,40,41

and elevated

39,42

Discriminatory performance of existing covid-19 scores applied to our cohort was lower than reported in
derivation cohorts (DL score 0.74; COVID-GRAM 0.88; Xie score 0.98).

36,37,39

The use of small inpatient

cohorts from Wuhan, China for model development may have resulted in over-fitting, limiting
generalisability in other cohorts.

37,39

The Xie score demonstrated the highest discriminatory power

(0.73), including age, lymphocyte count, LDH and peripheral oxygen saturations. However, we were only
able to calculate this score for <10% of the validation cohort, as LDH is not routinely captured on
admission in the UK.

Due to challenges of clinical data collection during an epidemic, missing data is common, with choice of
predictors influenced by data availability.

39

Complete case analysis often leads to exclusion of a

substantial proportion of the original sample, subsequently leading to a loss of precision and power.

43

However, the assessment of missing data on model performance in novel covid-19 risk stratification
scores has been limited

36

or unexplored

37,39

, potentially introducing bias and further limiting

generalisability to other cohorts. We found discriminatory performance in both derivation and
validation cohorts remained similar after the imputation of a wide range of variables (41), further
supporting the validity of our findings.

The presence of comorbidities is handled differently in covid-19 prognostic scores, either included
individually,

39,41

given equal weight,

36

or found to have no predictive effect.

37

Recent evidence suggests

an additive effect of comorbidity in covid-19 patients, with increasing number of comorbidities
associated with poorer outcomes.

15

In our cohort, the inclusion of individual comorbidities within the

machine learning model conferred minimal additional discriminatory performance, supporting the
inclusion of an overall comorbidity count.

Strengths and limitations of this study
The ISARIC WHO CCP-UK study represents the largest prospectively collected covid-19 hospitalised
patient cohort in the world and reflects the clinical data available in most economically developed
healthcare settings. We developed a clinically applicable score with clear methodology and tested it
against existing risk stratification scores in a large hospitalised patient cohort. It compared favourably to

i

other prognostic tools, w th good to excellent discrimination, calibration and performance
characteristics.

The 4C Mortality Score has several methodological advantages over current covid-19 prognostic scores.
The use of penalised regression methods, an event-to-variable ratio greater than 100 reducing the risk
of model over-fitting,

44,45

and the use of clinical parameters at first assessment increases the clinical

applicability of the score and limits use of highly selective predictors prevalent in other risk stratification
scores.

4,46

In addition, the sensitivity analyses demonstrated that score performance was robust.

Our study has limitations. First, we were unable to evaluate the predictive performance of a number of
existing scores that comprise a large number of parameters (for example APACHE II

47

), as well as several

other covid-19 prognostic scores that include computed tomography findings or uncommonly measured
biomarkers.

5

In addition, several potentially relevant comorbidities, such as hypertension, previous

myocardial infarction and stroke

15

were not included in data collection. Their inclusion might have

impacted upon or improved 4C Mortality Score performance and generalisability.

Second, a proportion of recruited patients had incomplete episodes and were thus excluded from the
analysis. Selection bias is possible if patients with incomplete episodes, such as those with prolonged
hospital admission, had a differential mortality risk to those with completed episodes. Nevertheless, the
size of our patient cohort compares favourably to other datasets for model creation. Furthermore, the
patient cohort on which the 4C Mortality Score was derived comprised hospitalised patients who were
seriously ill (mortality rate of 30.5%) and were of advanced age (median age 74 years). Further external
validation is required to determine whether the 4C Mortality Score is generalisable among younger
patients and in settings outside the UK.

Conclusions and policy implications
We have derived and validated an easy-to-use eight-variable risk stratification score that enables
accurate stratification of hospitalised covid-19 patients by mortality risk at hospital presentation.
Application within the validation cohorts demonstrated this tool may guide clinician decisions, including
treatment escalation.

The key aim of clinical risk stratification scores is to support clinical management decisions. Three risk
classes were identified and demonstrated similar adverse outcome rates across the validation cohort.
Patients with a 4C Mortality Score falling within the low-risk groups (mortality rate 1%) might be suitable
for management in the community, while those within the intermediate-risk group were at lower risk of
mortality (mortality rate 10%; 23% of the cohort) and may be suitable for ward-level monitoring. Similar
mortality rates have been identified as an appropriate cut-off in pneumonia risk stratification scores
(CURB-65 and PSI).

19,20

Meanwhile patients with a score ≥9 were at high risk of death (43%), which may

prompt aggressive treatment, including the commencement of steroids,

48

and early escalation to critical

care if appropriate.

End matter

What is already known on this topic
•

There is a lack of robust, validated clinical prediction tools to identify patients with covid-19 who
are at the highest risk of mortality

•

Given uncertainty about how to stratify covid-19 patients, there is considerable interest in risk
stratification scores to support frontline clinical decision making

•

Available risk stratification tools however suffer from a high risk of bias, small sample size
resulting in uncertainty, poor reporting and lack of formal validation

What this study adds
•

The majority of existing covid-19 risk stratification tools performed poorly in our cohort –
caution should be applied when using novel tools based on small patient populations to inhospital cohorts with covid-19

•

In contrast, our 4C (Coronavirus Clinical Characterisation Consortium) score is an easy-to-use
and valid prediction tool for inpatient mortality, accurately categorising patients as being at low,
intermediate, high, or very high-risk of death

•

This pragmatic and clinically applicable score outperformed other risk stratification tools and
had similar performance to more complex models
