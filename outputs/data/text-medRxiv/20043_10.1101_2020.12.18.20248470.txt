Abstract

The COVID-19 disease, caused by the SARS-Cov-2, presents a heterogeneous clinical
spectrum. The risk factors do not fully explain the wide spectrum of disease manifestations,
so it is possible that genetic factors could account for novel insights into its pathogenesis.
In our previous study, we hypothesized that common variants on chromosome 21, near
TMPRSS2 and MX1 genes, may be genetic risk factors associated to the different clinical
manifestations of COVID-19. Here, we performed an in-depth genetic analysis of
chromosome 21 exploiting the genome-wide association study data including 6,406
individuals hospitalized for COVID-19 and 902,088 controls with European genetic ancestry
from COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative. We found that five single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) within TMPRSS2 and near MX1 gene show suggestive associations
(P≤1x10-5) with severe COVID-19. All five SNPs replicated the association in two
independent cohorts of Asian subjects while two and one out of the 5 SNPs replicated in
African and Italian populations, respectively (P≤0.05). The minor alleles of these five SNPs
correlated with a reduced risk of developing severe COVID-19 and increased level of MX1
expression in blood.
Our findings provide further evidence that host genetic factors can contribute to determine
the different clinical presentations of COVID-19 and that MX1, an antiviral effector of type I
and III interferon pathway, may be a potential therapeutic target.

Introduction

The recent SARS-Cov-2 pandemic has caused so far more than one million of deaths
(https://covid19.who.int/). The COVID-19, caused by the SARS-Cov-2, has several clinical
conditions ranging from no or mild symptoms to rapid progression to respiratory failure (1,
2). Advanced age is a major risk factor, as well as male sex and some co-morbidities such as
hypertension and diabetes (3). Since clinical risk factors do not fully explain the wide
spectrum of disease manifestations, it is conceivable that dissecting the genetics of the
disease may provide novel insights into its pathogenesis.

A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified two susceptibility loci of severe
COVID-19: the first locus on chromosome 3 harbors multiple genes (SLC6A20, LZFTL1,
CCR9, CXCR6, XCR1, FYCO1) that could be functionally implicated in COVID-19
pathology; the second on chromosome 9 that defines the ABO blood groups (4). Another
study showed that inactivating rare mutations in genes belonging to type I interferon pathway
predispose to life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia (5). Other very recent papers reported
the results from the analysis of two large independent GWASs that validated the two
previous risk loci and found novel variants at chromosome 19p13.3, 12q24.13 and 21q22.1
associated with severe COVID-19 (6, 7).

In our previous opinion article, based on allele frequencies across different populations and
expression quantitative loci (eQTLs) data, we hypothesized that common variants on
chromosome 21 near TMPRSS2 and MX1 genes may be genetic risk factors associated to the
COVID-19 different clinical manifestations (8). In this study, to further support our
hypothesis, we exploited GWAS data from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative (9) and
performed an in-depth mapping of chromosome 21 using summary statistics where common
variants at this chromosome were associated with severe COVID-19 at genome-wide
significance level (P ≤ 5×10-8). Using the cohort of 908,494 subjects with European origins,
we found 5 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the TMPRSS2/MX1 locus showing
suggestive association with the disease. All 5 SNPs replicated the association in two
independent cohorts of Asian subjects whereas two SNPs confirmed the association in
African and one SNP in Italian cohort. Significant eQTLs signals were found for MX1 in
blood.

Methods

GWAS
The summary statistics of chromosome 21 were obtained from the GWAS dataset
“B2_ALL_eur_leave_23andme” deposited in the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative website
(9). It includes 6,406 laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalized for
COVID-19 cases and 902,088 controls from general population with European genetic
ancestry.

Replication
The summary statistics of the SNPs used for the replication study were retrieved from the
GenOMICC study (6). Three independent cohorts of cases and controls with different
ethnicity were available throughout GenOMMIC GWAS study (REF 6): 182 individuals
from African ancestry (AFR), 149 from East Asian ancestry (EAS), 237 from South Asian
ancestry (SAS). Moreover, 157 hospitalized COVID-19 cases and 1388 controls with Italian
origins were typed fort the rs12329760 variant by TaqMan® SNP Genotyping (Applied
Biosystems by Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Definition of independent genome-wide associated loci
Using the 74 significant SNPs with P≤1x10-5 of chromosome 21, we defined three
independent associated loci by the following computational process. The SNPs were first
sorted according to their association P value. Then, the lead SNP, considered as the most
significant SNP in a given genomic locus, was removed from this list and assigned to an
independent locus together with all other SNPs which have a r2 value less than or equal to
0.01 with this SNP. This procedure was recursively applied to the remaining SNPs in the list,
so that each SNP could be assigned to a locus and no SNPs were left in the original list.

Results

TMPRSS2/MX1 locus is associated with severe COVID-19
To prove that common variants at TMPRSS2/MX1 (21q22.3) locus may affect the
susceptibility to severe COVID-19 onset, we analyzed the summary statistics of a large
available GWAS dataset released from COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative. The database
includes 6,406 hospitalized cases and 902,088 controls with European ancestry. The region
on chromosome 21 appears to be significantly associated with severe COVID-19 at the
genome-wide level (https://www.covid19hg.org/results/) (6). To investigate whether more
than one association signal may exist at chromosome 21, we selected 74 SNPs showing a
P≤1×10-5 and among these we identified 3 independent loci (Supplementary Table 1). The
most significant signal was represented by rs13050728 (P=2.76×10-12, OR=0.83, Figure 1a)
that maps within the INFRA2 gene. The other two signals showed a suggestive significance
level (P≤1×10−5) and were tagged by rs111783124 (P=2.39×10-6, OR=1.17, Figure 1b) and
rs3787946 (P=2.73×10-6, OR=0.87, Figure 1c), respectively. The rs3787946 maps in an
intronic region of TMPRSS2 and the first closest gene was MX1 (Figure 1c); herein we
named this locus as “TMPRSS2/MX1”. An in-depth inspection of TMPRSS2/MX1 locus
showed that 13 SNPs were in LD with the lead rs3787946 (r2>0.8, Table 1) and that the 5
most significant SNPs (P-values ranged from 2.7×10-6 to 5.8×10-6, Table 1) were in strong
LD with each other (r2>=0.90, Supplementary Figure 1). The other 9 SNPs showed an LD
with the lead SNP rs3787946 ranging from 0.8 to 0.9 and P-values ranging from 6×10-4 to
0.04 (Table 1). We then sought to replicate the associations of the 14 SNPs in three
independent cohorts of cases and controls of GenOMMIC GWAS (6) with non-European
ancestry. All the 11 available SNPs replicated in the EAS population; the top 5 SNPs
replicated in SAS population whereas two out five SNPs in the AFR one (Table 1). By using
TaqMan assay, we typed the rs12329760 variant in 157 hospitalized COVID-19 and 1388
controls with Italian origins (Supplementary Table 2) collected in our Institute and
confirmed the minor allele as protective factor against the aggressive form of disease (Table
1, OR=0.72, P=0.05).

SNPs at TMPRSS2/MX1 locus are enriched in regulatory regions active in thymus
We tested if the 14 SNPs (Table 1) and their proxy SNPs (r2>0.8) were significantly overrepresented in active enhancers and promoters in multiple cell types and tissues by using
HaploReg v4.1. These SNPs were enriched in the regulatory regions of several tissues

(Supplementary Table 3), but the best enrichment was found in induced pluripotent stem
cell and thymus (Figure 2a).

Functional role of the most significant SNPs at TMPRSS2/MX1 locus
We then investigated the predicted functional role of the 14 SNPs by GWAVA and CADD
tools. We found that 2 (rs12329760 and rs9983330) out of 5 of the most significant SNPs
showed the second and third most significant score (Table 1). The rs12329760 was classified
as coding variant (p.Val197Met) localized in the exon 6 of TMPRSS2 gene and was predicted
to be pathogenic (PolyPhen=probably damaging and SIFT=deleterious).

The most significant disease associated SNPs are eQTLs for MX1 in blood
We verified if the top 5 SNPs (Table 1) might cause gene expression alterations interrogating
the GTEx portal. We found that all the top 5 SNPs had eQTL signals for MX1 exclusively in
blood tissue. Particularly, the minor alleles of these SNPs correlated with higher expression
of MX1 compared to the major alleles (Figure 2b, Supplementary Figure 2a). Of note, all
the 9 other SNPs, except for rs2298660, did not have eQTL signals for MX1 in blood
(Supplementary Table 4). The two SNPs, rs12329760 and rs2298660, were confirmed as
eQTLs for MX1 in blood (P=1.79×10-6 and 2.8×10-6, minor alleles correlated with a higher
expression compared to the major alleles) by interrogation of another independent publicly
available dataset (13). TMPRSS2 is highly expressed in lung (8), so we investigated if the top
5 SNPs were eQTL for TMPRSS2 in lung tissues at nominally statistically significant level
(P≤0.05). We found that the minor alleles of 4 out 5 SNPs correlated with lower expression
of TMPRSS2 compared to the major alleles (Figure 2c and Supplementary Figure 2b).
Notably, rs12329760 is also an eQTL for TMPRSS2 in osteoblasts treated with
dexamethasone (14).

Discussion
Despite the substantial advances made in the recent months in the field of the SARS-CoV-2
infection, the major question remains about the identification of the factors that modulate the
variable clinical spectrum of COVID-19.

Host genetic risk factors are emerging as a potential explanation for clinical heterogeneity of
COVID-19 and are also crucial to find new druggable therapeutic targets (15). The main host
cell entry factors of SARS-CoV-2 are ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (16, 17). The transmembrane
spike (S) glycoprotein of virus binds to the ACE2 making it essential for the invasion of the
virus into the host cell, followed by attachment of the virus to the target cells. S- protein
priming by TMPRSS2 allows the binding of viral and cellular membranes, resulting in virus
entry and replication in the host cells (18).

In our previous study, we hypothesized that common variants at chromosome 21, driving
TMPRSS2 and MX1 expression, might have a mild-to-moderate effect in the susceptibility to
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Particularly, genetic variants associated with reduced TMPRSS2 and
elevated MX1 expression might confer less individual susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2
infection and favor a better outcome (8). Here, to further support our hypothesis, we
exploited GWAS data of a cohort of 908,494 subjects with European origins from the
COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative (9) and performed an in-depth genetic analysis of
chromosome 21. We identified five common variants (rs3787946, rs9983330, rs12329760,
rs2298661 and rs9985159) at locus 21q22.3 within TMPRSS2 and near MX1 gene that
showed suggestive associations (P≤1x10-5) with severe COVID-19. In particular, we found
that the alleles with minor frequency were less recurrent among the hospitalized patients
when compared to the control individuals, suggesting their protective role against the
progression of disease. Interestingly, all the five SNPs replicated in two cohorts of Asian
origin, whereas two SNPs replicated in a case series of African ancestry. Additionally, we
replicated the association of the rs12329760 SNP in an independent case-control cohort of
Italian origins. These results strongly indicate 21q22.3 as novel susceptibility locus to
unfavorable outcome of COVID-19 and suggest that molecular mechanisms underlying this
genetic predisposition may be common among individuals with different ethnicity.

Of note, the SNPs at this locus were enriched in the regulatory regions of induced pluripotent
stem cell and thymus. Thymus plays a significant role in the regulation of adaptive immune
responses. The effect of aging on the thymus and immune senescence is well established, and
the resulting inflammaging is found to be implicated in the development of many chronic
diseases. Both aging and diseases of inflammaging are associated with severe COVID-19,
and a dysfunctional thymus may be implicated in the unfavorable outcome of disease (19,
20). Thus, our finding suggests that the identified SNPs could be severe COVID-19 risk
factors also for their implications in the thymus function.

The five SNPs, here identified, had eQTL signals for MX1 exclusively in blood tissue.
Particularly, the minor allele of these SNPs correlated with higher expression of MX1 and
associated with a minor risk of developing severe COVID-19. These results support the
evidence that MX1 can play a relevant role in determining less severe forms of disease and
are in line with a recent study that suggests MX1 as antiviral effector against SARS-CoV-2
(21). Indeed, the expression of MX1 was found to be higher in SARS-CoV-2 positive
subjects, negatively correlated with age and independently associated with increased viral
load (21). MX1 is part of the antiviral response induced by type I and III interferons (IFN)
(22). Inactivating mutations in genes belonging to type I IFN pathway and the consequent
decreased levels of proteins have been shown to recur in patients with severe COVID-19 (5).
Therefore, our results further support the evidence that the use of drugs, activating IFN
signaling, could be an effective treatment to prevent the adverse outcome of disease. There
are already several ongoing clinical trials for COVID-19 prevention and/or treatment using
type I or III IFNs (NCT04343976 [Phase II], NCT04385095 [Phase II], NCT04354259
[Phase II], NCT04293887 [Early Phase I], NCT04344600 [Phase II], NCT04320238 [Phase
III], NCT04388709 [Phase II]). On the contrary, it is important to note that IFN
administration could enhance a ‘‘cytokine-storm’’ causing a hyper-inflammatory response
and contributing to multiple organ failure (21). Therefore, it is highly relevant to spawn new
drugs that have the capacity to boost the host immune response while controlling tissue
damage as a consequence of these infections.

We also report that the minor allele of 4 of the top 5 SNPs might reduce the expression of
TMPRSS2 in lung tissues and that the rs12329760 coding variant (p.Val197Met) correlate
with lower expression of TMPRSS2 in osteoblast treated with dexamethasone (14), a drug
currently used to inhibit an excessive inflammation response (23). Of note, the rs12329760

coding variant was recently found to be less frequent among Chinese patients with critical
COVID-19 disease (24). This variant is predicted to decrease the TMPRSS2 protein stability
and ACE2 binding, thus decreasing the virus entry into the cells (25). Together, these data
suggest that even the functions of TMPRSS2 may be affected by risk variants of severe
COVID-19. However, caution should be paid in considering these results as the eQTL signals
in lung resulted to be not significant when corrected for multiple tests. Additional studies are
needed to further verify the role of genetic variants TMPRSS2/MX1 at locus in modulating
the expression of TMPRSS2.

In conclusions, our results provide evidence that common variants, regulating the expression
of MX1, can predispose to the risk of developing severe COVID-19. Unraveling the role of
regulatory variants at the TMPRSS2/MX1 locus could represent an important starting point
for the treatment of COVID-19.

Figure legend

Figure 1. Regional association plots of the SNPs at three independent association signals
of chromosome 21. Plots were generated using LocusZoom. Yaxes represent the
significance of association (−log10 transformed P values) and the recombination rate. SNPs
are colorcoded based on pairwise linkage disequilibrium (r2) with indicated lead SNPs:
rs13050728 (panel a), rs111783124 (panel b) and rs3787946 (panel c).

Figure 2. Enrichment of SNPs in regulatory regions and eQTL analyses. The statistically
significant fold enrichments (P<0.05 after Bonferroni correction) of SNPs in regulatory DNA
regions active in different tissues are shown (a). eQTL violin plots between genotypes of
rs3787946 (b) and rs3787946 (c) with MX1 and TMPRSS2 expression from the from the
Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx).
