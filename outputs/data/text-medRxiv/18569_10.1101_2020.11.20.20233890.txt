Abstract
The second wave of COVID-19 in Malaysia is largely attributed to a mass gathering held in Sri Petaling between February 27, 2020 and March 1, 2020, which
contributed to an exponential rise of COVID-19 cases in the country. Starting
March 18, 2020, the Malaysian government introduced four consecutive phases of
a Movement Control Order (MCO) to stem the spread of COVID-19. The MCO
was implemented through various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). The reported number of cases reached its peak by the first week of April and then started
to reduce, hence proving the effectiveness of the MCO. To gain a quantitative understanding of the effect of MCO on the dynamics of COVID-19, this paper develops
a class of mathematical models to capture the disease spread before and after MCO
implementation in Malaysia. A heterogeneous variant of the Susceptible-ExposedInfected-Recovered (SEIR) model is developed with additional compartments for
asymptomatic transmission. Further, a change-point is incorporated to model the
before and after disease dynamics, and is inferred based on data. Related statistical
analyses for inference are developed in a Bayesian framework and are able to provide
quantitative assessments of (1) the impact of the Sri Petaling gathering, and (2) the
extent of decreasing transmission during the MCO period. The analysis here also
quantitatively demonstrates how quickly transmission rates fall under effective NPI
implemention within a short time period.

Introduction

Imported cases from China contributed to the first COVID-19 wave in Malaysia from
January 25, 2020 to February 26, 2020 [1]. This first wave had a total of 22 cases out of
which 20 were directly linked to foreign travel while the remaining two cases were local
transmissions [2, 3]. The second wave of COVID-19 in Malaysia was largely attributed
to a mass gathering held in Sri Petaling between February 27, 2020 and March 1, 2020,
which contributed to an exponential rise of COVID-19 cases in the country. This gathering
involved over 16, 000 participants including a large number of foreigners from countries
that later registered COVID-19 cases [4]. On March 18, 2020, the Malaysian government
introduced a nationwide lockdown which was the Phase I Movement Control Order (MCO)
throughout the country to stem the spread of COVID-19. Phase 1 MCO was enforced for a
2-week period starting from March 18, 2020 to March 31, 2020. During this phase, various
non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were strictly enforced by means of movement
restrictions, wearing of face masks, social distancing and hand hygiene practices to reduce
disease transmission. The Phase I MCO was then evaluated after 2 weeks based on
case trends and model forecasts by the Ministry of Health (MOH) Malaysia. As local
transmission persisted, the MCO was extended a total of four times until May 12, 2020.
Phase 2, 3 and 4 of the MCO covered periods starting from April 1, 2020 until May
12, 2020 (Phase 2 - April 1, 2020 to April 14, 2020, Phase 3 - April 15th to April 30,
2020, and Phase 4 - May 1, 2020 to May 12, 2020). Subsequently, from May 4, 2020, the
MCO was eased into the Conditional MCO (CMCO) until June 9, 2020. However, during
CMCO, there were still several identified hot-spots of COVID-19 which were placed under
Enhanced MCO (EMCO) with the aforementioned strict movement control restrictions.
The implementation of MCO proved to be effective - the reported COVID-19 cases
reached its peak around the first week of April and subsequently started to reduce. However, concerns remained whether a rebound in transmission would occur when the MCO
was lifted and if compliance to NPIs were not followed strictly at that time. In order to gain a quantitative understanding of the effect of MCO, we developed a class of
mathematical models to capture the dynamics of COVID-19 spread before and after the
MCO implementation. A variant of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR)
model is proposed and developed in this paper which incorporates heterogeneity in the
transmission dynamics, additional compartments for asymptomatic transmission and a
change-point, chosen adaptively based on data, to reflect the shift in spread dynamics
after the MCO implementation. The models developed in this paper are able provide a
quantitative assessment of the extent of COVID-19 spread during the pre-MCO (large

gathering) and MCO periods by means of a measure of infectivity developed from them.
This measure is similar to the basic reproduction number, commonly denoted by R0 , but
can be calculated for more complex epidemic models such as the ones proposed here.
Deterministic compartmental models, such as the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR)
or the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) models, provide a good theoretical framework to study infectious disease spread, and have been widely used and reported
in the literature. However, more complex versions of these models, and their stochastic counterparts require data-rich inputs to model all aspects of the disease dynamics.
Data-rich inputs, if lacking, can be compensated using reliable and informative prior elicitation. Considering the acute nature and scale of the pandemic as well as the urgent
need for a multisectorial response, comprehensive data availability of the pandemic was
limited in Malaysia. For example, the open source website outbreak.my initially reported
a transmission network for all cases; however, it was unable to cope with the scale of the
pandemic when it intensified. Factoring in this data limitation, we choose to develop
models that are deterministic, rather than stochastic, while ensuring that they are able
to capture salient transmission dynamics satisfactorily. As mentioned earlier, we enhance
the deterministic models by incorporating compartments for asymptomatic transmission
and a change-point to reflect the shift in disease dynamics. We also take into account
heterogeneity in the disease spread such as varying contacts among susceptibles within
the closed population. The starting point of our proposed models are the class of epidemic
models with power transmission dynamics which are shown to incorporate heterogeneity
(see [5, 6]).
Several studies in the literature [7, 8, 9, 10, 11] have analyzed the effects of NPIs in
reducing the number of COVID-19 cases. In [7], the effects of different types of NPIs
on COVID-19 cases are modeled using a negative-binomial distribution whose underlying
parameters incorporate country information, type of NPI implemented and change-point
effects. The associated Bayesian analysis is carried out using Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) algorithms to arrive at posterior parameter estimates and credible intervals.
No epidemic models are considered in this work. A generalization of the SEIR epidemic
model is considered in [9] to understand the dynamics of transmission in New York, USA,
under various NPI settings. However, the model is complex and requires data-rich inputs
for the estimation of all unknown parameters. As a result, the authors derive baseline
epidemiological parameters from published literature and not from actual observed cases
in New York, and in the end conduct a simulation study based on the assumed parameter
values. The study in [8] extends the work of [12] and computes a time-varying basic
reproduction number as a way of gauging the effect of NPIs over time. Both these works

assume that serial intervals (i.e., the time between onset of symptoms for the infector and
the infectee) can be computed for each case, which is another situation requiring data-rich
input.
Studies that use compartmental epidemic models as a way of gauging the time-varying
effects of NPIs have emerged over the course of the pandemic [13, 14, 15]. Compartmental
epidemic models naturally model disease spread via contact rates which directly quantify
the extent of NPIs (since, as mentioned earlier, NPIs are designed to reduce person-toperson transmission). Thus, epidemic models provide a natural approach for considering
time-varying effects of the MCO period. Further, in this paper, the estimation of SEIR
parameters is carried out based on local considerations and local data; they are not
obtained from published literature based on studies conducted elsewhere where their local
dynamics can be vastly different.
We seek to address one important aspect of Malaysia’s multifaceted response to the
COVID-19 pandemic, that is, to inform the health officials at MOH and aid them in their
decision-making. Thus, our model was developed under local considerations using local
data. Our model and related analyses are able to provide a quantitative assessment of (1)
the impact of the Sri Petaling gathering, and (2) the extent of decreasing transmission
during the MCO period by incorporating a time-varying contact rate parameter, which
is estimated using locally available data. In essence, the proposed models here are being
used as a lens to interpret the observed data in terms of when, and to what extent, a
reduction in COVID-19 transmission occurred as result of the implementation of MCO.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the material and
methods used in this paper: Section 2.1 gives the various data sources used in this study,
Section 2.2 describes the epidemic models that we propose in this paper and Section 2.5
outlines the related Bayesian inference methodology developments. Section 3 gives the
results of our analyses, and Section 4 provides general discussion and insights derived
from these results. Finally, several conclusions and potential future work are outlined in
Section 5.

and cumulative cases, recovered cases and deaths, as well as cases requiring ICU care
and ventilator support. Cases by states are also available for the 13 states and 3 federal
territories. In this study, we studied characteristics of the second COVID-19 wave in
Malaysia starting from March 1, 2020 (corresponding to the final day of the Sri Petaling
gathering). Data used for the current study are confirmed daily cases for Malaysia, and
for two states: Selangor and Sarawak. These states were chosen to illustrate the aggressive transmission propagated by the Sri Petaling gathering. Selangor is the state where
Sri Petaling is located and from where a majority of the participants originated, whereas
Sarawak represents a state which was essentially not affected by this gathering. The time
period of study is between March 1, 2020 (end of Sri Petaling gathering) and April 28,
2020, covering the period immediately after the Sri Petaling gathering and the first three
phases of the MCO. Our study duration is further divided into two periods. The first
period ranges from March 1, 2020 until March 18, 2020, which covers the subsequent 17
days after the gathering. The second period is taken from March 18, 2020 until April
28, 2020, covering the three successive Phases 1, 2 and 3 of the MCO. Figure 1 gives the
trajectories of reported daily COVID-19 cases between March 1, 2020 and April 28, 2020
for Malaysia, and the states of Selangor and Sarawak.
All COVID-19 cases reported by MOH were confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR) tests. A positive case was reported when
the person in question was found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 via a real-time RT-PCR
test. Upon confirmation, the individual was isolated at COVID-19 designated hospitals
and healthcare facilities. Active cases are defined as infected persons who were currently

undergoing treatment, and hence, isolated and removed; the individual is assumed to be
unable to infect other susceptibles in the population, and hence “removed” from further
modelling steps. This study did not consider transmission from positive isolated COVID19 patients to health personnel as there was no evidence of this type of transmission
occurring in the COVID-19 designated hospitals in Malaysia.

The SEIR model

The typical and well-known SEIR compartmental model consists of four compartments
(Susceptible, Exposed, Infected and Recovered) representing different stages of evolution
of an infectious disease, such as COVID-19, in a population. Susceptible individuals come
in contact with one or more infected individuals in the population, and subsequently,
become exposed to the virus. The virus then incubates within these individuals for some
time. At the end of the incubation period, the exposed person becomes infectious and
transmits the disease to other susceptibles in the population who come in close contact
to him/her. The infected person is assumed to be infectious for a certain period (called
the infectious period) after which the person recovers, dies or becomes immune. The
deterministic SEIR model is given by a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations
(ODEs):
Ṡ(t) = −h(S, I)

Ė(t) = h(S, I) − δ E(t)

I(t)
= δ E(t) − γ I(t), and

where S(t), E(t), I(t) and R(t) represents, respectively, the susceptible, exposed, infected
and recovered compartments representing the total number of individuals in each compartment at time t (here, ẋ(t) denotes the derivative of x(t) with respect to time t for

new infections (or, the number of new cases in the population). The parameters that
govern the trajectory of the SEIR model are θ ≡ (β, δ, γ, i0 , e0 ) which are, respectively,
the transmission rate (i.e., number of individuals in the population an infected person
comes in contact with and successfully transmits the disease per unit time), the rate of
incubation of the disease, the rate of infectiousness, the initial number of infectives and the

S(t) + E(t) + I(t) + R(t) = N for all t. Reparametrizing S(t) = S(t)/N , E(t) = E(t)/N ,
I(t) = I(t)/N and R(t) = R(t)/N , the renormalized versions of S, E, I and R represent

the proportion, rather than the total number of individuals, in each compartment. In the
renormalized SEIR model, S(t) + E(t) + I(t) + R(t) = 1 and the rate of new infections

, and R(0) = 0
Based on initial values of S(0) ≡ s0 = 1 − N
at time T0 = 0, the SEIR ODE system can be solved numerically to yield the values
of S(t), E(t), I(t) and R(t) for every t ∈ [T0 , T1 ] where T1 denotes the final time-point.
In (1)-(4), the incubation period, 1/δ, is inversely proportional to the incubation rate δ,
and similarly, the infectious period 1/γ is inversely proportional to the infectious rate γ.
The correspondence between rates and exponential sojourn times is only approximately so
since it is not so straightforward to establish this correspondence with an individual-based
stochastic model given the non-linear nature of the process.
Modifications to typical SEIR formulation (1)-(4) are made to adapt it to the local
Malaysian context. Here, the last compartment of the SEIR model is not “Recovered”
but “Removed”, representing all infectious individuals who are effectively isolated following a positive test result. In Malaysia, such patients are isolated in hospital wards to avoid
further contacts with susceptibles. For COVID-19 in particular, the onset of symptoms
does not necessarily indicate the start of infectiousness; in fact, the onset of infectiousness
may be somewhat earlier. Thus, the infectious period 1/γ represents the period of effective infectiousness, that is, the period from the start of infectiousness (asymptomatic or
symptomatic) until the individual is isolated and then can no longer infect others. Based
on this understanding, 1/δ represents the incubation period, which is the period starting
from getting infected until the onset of infectiousness. The connection between the SEIR
modelling formulation and actual evolution stages of COVID-19 in patients is shown in
Figure 2. Recent studies on COVID-19 have clearly reported growing evidence of asymptomatic infections [16, 17, 18] which the current SEIR model does not incorporate. We
address the issue of asymptomatic transmission in our subsequent model development in
Section 2.3.
Observed data in Malaysia consists of the total number of confirmed daily cases as
reported by outbreak.my and CPRC (i.e., the number of cases that were tested positive,
and hence, effectively isolated). Hence, only the R compartment of the SEIR model
can be related to observed data while other compartments of the SEIR model remain
unobserved. In the subsequent model development in Section 2.3, the R compartment is
further split into two: observed and cryptic sub-compartments corresponding to reported
and asymptomatic infections; see Section 2.3 for more details. An additional assumption
made is that individuals from the R compartment do not return to the S compartment -

at least on the timescales over which the epidemic is observed; see, for example, [19, 20]
In order to provide a quantitative assessment of the impact of the MCO, we modify
(1)-(4) to incorporate an instantaneous time-varying transmission rate, β ≡ β(t) (see [21],
for example) which is able to quantify the extent of disease transmission at time t. The
MCO can be deemed effective if the function β(t) shows a decay reflecting an increasing
effectiveness in reducing transmission among individuals over time due to implementation
of the NPIs.

The modified SEIR model

The aforementioned SEIR model does not account for heterogeneity, asymptomatic transmission and change points. To this end, we propose models with power transmission dynamics that incorporate heterogeneity in the disease parameters; see, for example, [5, 6].
Further, the infectious compartment in (3) of the SEIR model is now split into two, Io
and Ic , for symptomatic (or, observed) and asymptomatic (or, cryptic) individuals, who,
respectively, exhibit and do not (or, mildly) exhibit symptoms but are nevertheless infectious. Correspondingly, the R compartment is also split into two, as mentioned earlier, to
accomodate quarantined and un-quarantined cases. It is assumed that the proportion of
individuals transiting from E to Io is p. The remaining exposed individuals (a proportion
of 1 − p) transition into the Ic compartment and remain undetected throughout their
disease experience.
From now on, we consider only renormalized state values which represent proportions,
and not actual numbers, of the population. The modified SEIR model with cryptic and

as opposed to β S(t) I(t) in (5) for the SEIR model. A key difference of the model
formulation in (6) - (12) is the power transmission dynamics used to model heterogeneity
in the population; see [5, 6]. In [6], a gamma distribution is elicited on the varying
disease transmission parameters within the population which gives rise to the powers ws ,
wi,o and wi,c on S(t), Io (t) and Ic (t), respectively, with ws ≥ 1, wi,o ≥ 1 and wi,c ≥ 1.
The lower bounds on ws , wi,o and wi,c recover the original SEIR model dynamics with
no heterogeneity. The remaining parameters have the following interpretation: (1) α
represents a small yet significant force of infection that starts the local infection process
but is eventually overwhelmed by it. In our context, α represents the initial force of
infection arising from, say, foreign infectious individuals attending the large gathering
at Sri Petaling starting February 27th. (2) The parameters γo and γc have the same
interpretation as γ in (3), that is, they are rates of infectiousness but for the observed and
cryptic compartments, respectively. (3) The parameter δ is the same as before, namely, it
is the rate of incubation associated with the exposed compartment. (4) The parameters
βo and βc are transmission rates for the observed and cryptic compartments, respectively,
in the modified SEIR model with βc = µ β0 and µ ∈ [0, 1]. In other words, we assume that
the transmission rate for asymptomatic individuals is smaller than that of symptomatic
individuals; this is a plausible assumption to make as asymptomatic individuals generally
possess a lower viral load which leads to lower chances of a successful transmission. On
the other hand, a longer asymptomatic infectious period may compensate for the lower
transmission rates for an asymptomatic individual, and this possibility is captured by the
model via the parameter γc .
A change-point is incorporated into the modified SEIR model to capture the shift in
disease dynamics before and after the start of the MCO. For this, an unknown threshold,

T ∗ , is chosen so that observed daily cases fall either to the left or right of T ∗ . We denote
the observation window to the left of T ∗ by WL which consists of dates from March 1st up
to and including T ∗ . The window to the right of T ∗ is denoted by WR which consists of
dates after T ∗ up to and including April 28th, 2020. The change-point date T ∗ is inferred
from data; it is not taken as March 18th, 2020, the date of the start of MCO. Choosing
T ∗ in this data-driven way is justified as the impact of MCO on observed cases may not
be realized immediately. The modified SEIR model with change-point T ∗ is governed by
the ODE system (6)-(12) for all time points t ∈ WL . For t ∈ WR , the same ODE system
(6)-(12) is considered but now with a different set of parameter values in WR compared
to WL , and with a new βo expressed as a function of t,

to model possible changes in disease transmission over time. The functional form of βo (t)
in (13) has an initial value of γo ea0 at t = T ∗ after which it decreases (provided a1 < 0)
to the asymptotic value of cγo as t → ∞. Thus, cγo represents the residual disease
transmission that may be present even during the MCO period, for example, due to close
contact between family members in the same household. The general functional form of
βo (t) subsumes the constant disease transmission rate model as a special case by taking
a1 = c = 0 in (13). The constant rate submodel has the advantage of not explicitly
assuming any functional form for the change in disease transmission over time. On the
other hand, it can only ascertain if there is an overall change (increase or decrease) in
transmission after the change point T ∗ . Similar to the relationship βc = µβo in WL , we
assume βc (t) = µ βo (t) for the window WR based on a different µ value. In Section 3, the
submodel is used first followed by the full model to fit to observed data.
In the model formulation of (6)-(11), only the Ro compartment is modelled directly
using a likelihood function based on daily observed cases. The other compartments of the
modified SEIR model remain latent and do not have any direct observation processes for
modelling based on likelihoods; see Section 2.5 for further details.

Quantitative assessment of disease spread

The basic reproduction number, R0 , is defined as the number of secondary infections
caused by one primary individual during his/her infectious period. It is the most important quantitative indicator reported to assess whether the disease is in control or not. It
is well-known that the threshold value of 1 for R0 distinguishes between the situations

where a major epidemic occurs versus the disease dying out eventually in the population.
In fact, several studies in the literature report a gradual decrease in R0 after lockdown
[22, 23, 24]. For the SEIR model in (1) - (4), R0 is given by the well-known formula
R0 = β/γ. Time-varying measures of secondary infections per primary infected, Rt , are
also available in the literature. However, for the modified SEIR model presented in Section
2.3, R0 and Rt cannot be computed. Therefore, we resort to an alternative quantitative
assessement of disease spread - the total number of infections (i.e., generational) caused
by the introduction of one additional infectious individual into the infection process at
time point t. This procedure is illustrated using the Io compartment. Based on (6)-(12),
new values for the ODE system are calculated from time point t onwards with current
state values serving as initializations of the ODE system for all except one compartment:
For the Io -compartment, the current value Io (t) is replaced by Io (t) + 1/N as the initial
value. The new rate of incidence is given by h(S ∗ , Io∗ , Ic∗ ) over the infectious period of the
individual when the ODE system is propagated using (6)-(12) in [t, t+1/γo ]. The increase
in the rate of incidence by the introduction of this individual in the Io compartment is
given by

Similarly, the increase in the rate of incidence by the introduction of one infectious individual into the Ic compartment at time point t can be calculated. This is denoted by
∆t (Ic ). The final increase in the incidence is the mixture
∆t = p ∆t (Io ) + (1 − p)∆t (Ic )

Gamma function s=0 su−1 e−s ds evaluated for u > 0. Thus, r need not be integer-valued

recovered when τ = 1; see, for example, [25, 26]. The observed data on daily cases in
Malaysia exhibited significant overdispersion in the order of the mean. As a result, the
Poisson likelihood did not fit well and we resorted to the negative binomial likelihood
instead. More discussion on this aspect is presented later.

Let θ(j) ≡ (βo , µ(j) , γo , γc , δ (j) , p(j) , wi,o , wi,c , ws , α(j) ) for j = {L, R} be the parameters of the ODE system (6)-(12) for t ∈ WL and t ∈ WR , respectively. The collection
of all parameters is denoted by Θ = θ(L) ∪ θ(R) ∪ (τ, T ∗ ) where τ is the overdispersion
parameter of the negative binomial likelihood and T ∗ is the change-point. The uncertainty in θ is elicited via prior distributions in the Bayesian inferential framework. In
what follows, we describe the priors used on the generic parameter θ after which the
discussion on prior elicitation can be extended to θ(L) and θ(R) in a straightforward manner. It is important to note that the priors on θ depend on hyperparameters. Here,
we only elicit the forms of the priors; the discussion on the exact choice of the corresponding hyperparameters is relegated to the next few paragraphs. Independent uniform
priors U (aξ1 , bξ1 ) are chosen for each ξ1 ∈ {µ, p, wi,o , wi,c , ws , α} with corresponding hyperparameters aξ1 and bξ1 . The prior on (γo , δ) is chosen independently in the following
way: For ξ2 ∈ {γo , δ}, 1/ξ2 ∼ U (aξ2 , bξ2 ). The reciprocal transformation is used for prior
elicitation since these parameters have a rate interpretation, and hence, their reciprocals
represent the corresponding duration (either incubation or infectious periods) with benchmark values reported in the literature [16, 17, 18, 27]. The cryptic infectious period 1/γc
is generally longer than the observed infectious period 1/γo (since the former remains
undetected). Hence, it follows that 1/γo < 1/γc . This restriction can be incorporated into
the prior elicitation for 1/γo and 1/γc by first generating 1/γo ∼ U (aγo , bγo ) as above and
then setting 1/γc = 1/γo + ξ3 where ξ3 ∼ U (aξ3 ≡ 0, bξ3 > 0). The prior on the change
point T ∗ is taken to be uniform on dates from March 18th 2020 to March 31st 2020 both
inclusive. Since we define T ∗ as the number of days after March 1st 2020, T ∗ ∼ U (17, 30).
The prior on τ is taken to be U (aτ , bτ ) for the entire observation window WL ∪ WR .
The prior on βo is elicited indirectly via a reparametrization: For WL , we take βo =

ea0 γo and consider a uniform prior on a0 , independent of γo . Our prior elicitation adopts
this reparametrization for the following reason: For βo = ea0 γo , the basic reproduction
number R0 ≡ ea0 is the more fundamental quantity for simpler models, such as the SIR
and SEIR models, compared to βo . Thus, R0 for these models can be benchmarked based
on similar flu-like epidemics in the past which, in turn, provide a suggested range of
values for the prior elicitation of a0 in WL ; see [28]. Note that βo which represents the
contact rate of the target population cannot be determined by direct observation. Hence,
putting a prior directly on βo is difficult. Similarly, since 1/γo is the observed infectious
period, benchmark values can be obtained from the literature for its prior elicitation. To
summarize, we put direct priors on parameters that have an epidemiological interpretation
and which can be benchmarked from reported literature for eliciting the appropriate prior.
For WR , βo (t) has the form in (13) for coefficients a0 , a1 and c. For a0 , we consider two
cases: When using the submodel to determine whether an overall reduction in transmission
occurs or not, we take a0 ∼ U (La0 , Ua0 ) with La0 < 0 and Ua0 > 0. If the full model of (13)
is considered, a0 is chosen deterministically to ensure continuity of the infection process
before and after the change-point. More specifically, a0 in WR is chosen so that the rate
of incidence h(S(t), Io (t), Ic (t)) in WL and WR coincide at t = T ∗ . For the full model, a1
is given a uniform prior with support on [La1 , Ua1 ]. We take La1 < 0 and Ua1 = 0 if such
a reduction in disease transmission is established by the submodel.
Prior elicitation on parameters in WR is based on convenience and ease of interpretation. It is easier to elicit priors on the components of βo (t) in (13) compared to the entire
function itself. Further, the component parameters of βo (t) satisfy restrictions that are
easy to understand; for example, c ≤ ea0 since c and ea0 are the lower and upper bounds of

as well as for Selangor and Sarawak are used for model fitting and parameter estimation.
Note that all states in Malaysia implemented MCO Phases 1-3 using the same guidelines
and protocols. Thus, one can gauge the impact of the Sri Petaling gathering on COVID19 spread in Malaysia based on a comparison between states and the national experience.
Here, Selangor and Sarawak are chosen as two such representative states with high and
low population densities, respectively.
First, we investigate if the MCO implementation had an overall effect of reducing
COVID-19 transmission rates. For this purpose, the constant rate submodel of (13) is
used and the prior on a0 in WR is chosen to be uniform with support on both positive
and negative values. The Bayesian inference methodology of Section 2.5 is carried out
with M ∗ = 50, 000 to obtain Θ̂M AP and samples Θ∗i from the posterior of Θ in (19). The
curves of γo Io (t) and ∆Ro (t) ≡ Ro (t) − Ro (t − 1) for each day t are obtained based on
Θ̂M AP and are displayed in Figure 3. This submodel captures broad features (increasing
and decreasing trends) of the reported cases trajectories in all three panels for Malaysia,
Selangor and Sarawak. To quantify the overall change in transmission before and after
MCO implmentation, ∆t (see (15)) is obtained for t in WL and WR . The plots of ∆t
versus t are shown in Figure 4. A consistent feature of the plots in all three panels is

that they first increase for time points t ≤ T ∗ followed by a significant drop for t > T ∗ .
Hence, we conclude that an exponential rise in cases occurred right after the completion
of the Sri Petaling gathering on March 1st 2020, and the implementation of the MCO
successfully stemmed the exponential rise at the national level, Selangor and Sarawak.
With reduced disease transmission established in WR , we next proceed to utilize the
functional form (13) of βo (t) as a quantitative model for transmission decay in WR .
The Bayesian inference methodology of Section 2.5 is applied to the full model with
M ∗ = 50, 000 to obtain Θ̂M AP and samples Θ∗i from the posterior of Θ in (19). The
curves of γo Io (t) and ∆Ro (t) ≡ Ro (t) − Ro (t − 1) for each day t are obtained based
on Θ̂M AP and are displayed in Figure 5. Daily cumulative cases and the curve of Ro (t)
are displayed in Figure 6. We note from these figures that the proposed model captures
broad features of the observed data and is an improvement over the constant rate submodel. Uncertainty estimates are obtained for all unknown parameters in Θ based on the
∗
ensemble {Θ∗i }M
i=1 . Variabilility estimates can be obtained for all parameters and their
functions. As an illustration, we demonstrate the extent of variability inherent in the
posterior visually for the expected Ro (t) curve given by γo Io (t) (see (16)) for t ∈ [T0 , T1 ].
This is displayed in Figure 7 which shows that most of the reported case numbers are
well within the limits of variability of the posterior. Hence, the proposed model together
with the negative binomial likelihood are able to explain the variability in the reported
case numbers. However, there are a few exceptions, the most notable being the reported
case number on Day 14 for Malaysia in Figure 7(a). We present an explanation for this
outlying case later in the Discussion section.
Further results from the Bayesian analyses are summarized in Tables 1, 2 and 3. These
tables give the MAP estimates of parameters and their corresponding 95% credible intervals for Malaysia, Selangor and Sarawak, respectively. We provide a summary of the
salient findings here. The symptomatic and asymptomatic infectious periods as well as the
incubation periods are found to be around 6-8 days for Malaysia, Selangor and Sarawak.
These findings are similar to values reported in the literature for other countries; see,
for example, [16, 17, 18, 27]. Change-points T ∗ are estimated not too far away from the
date of MCO implementation, March 18th 2020. For Malaysia, T ∗ = 18 is the MAP estimate which corresponds to March 19th, 2020, and the associated 95% credible interval
is (17, 21). For Selangor, the MAP estimate of T ∗ is T ∗ = 22 with (17.5, 25) being the
95% credible interval. For Sarawak, the transition date is less precise. The MAP estimate
is T ∗ = 25 (March 26th 2020) but the 95% credible interval (18, 32.5) is much larger
indicating higher uncertainty in T ∗ . This can be attributed to the fact that the trajectory
of reported case numbers for Sarawak shows a slower and more gradual increase, then

decrease, compared to Malaysia and Selangor (see Figure 5).
The plots of ∆t versus t for Malaysia, Selangor and Sarawak are provided in Figure
8. We note that all three panels in Figure 8 indicate a decay in the transmission rates
after T ∗ . The measure ∆t is calculated to be approximately 3.55 , 2.79 and 2.65 for
Malaysia, Selangor and Sarawak, respectively, at the start of WL , that is, when t = T0 .
Hence, Selangor achieved a rate of increase that is closer to the national level compared
to Sarawak. Sarawak’s cases increased but at a much slower rate compared to Selangor
and Malaysia. Starting from t = T0 , ∆t showed an increase in WL , reaching values of
5.58, 3.35 and 2.96 at t = T ∗ , respectively, for Malaysia, Selangor and Sarawak. After T ∗ ,
∆t for Malaysia, Selangor and Sarawak registered a decay demonstrating the effectiveness
of the MCO. ∆t declined sharply to a value around 0.55, 0.01 and 0.37, respectively, for
Malaysia, Selangor and Sarawak at t = T ∗ + 10, and after that, it declined more gradually
to its corresponding asymptote. Based on ∆t , it is seen that the initial transmission rates
tend to be higher for areas with a higher population density (comparing Selangor and
Sarawak). On the other hand, based on the MAP estimates of a1 in WR of −2.38 and
−0.35 for Selangor and Sarawak, respectively (see Tables 2 and 3), higher population
density areas also experience a faster decline in the transmission rates under an effective
implementation of the MCO. Although the MAP estimate of a1 for Malaysia (a1 = −1.18
from Table 1) is not as negative as it should be, we will show in the next section that a
redistribution of cases further improves this estimate of a1 and brings it closer to that of
Selangor (see Section 4 for the details).

Discussion on Reporting Delays, Case Redistribution and Overdispersed Likelihoods

Figure 7 indicates the presence of outliers that fall outside the limits of variability of the
posterior. The most notable outlier is the total number of new cases reported on Day 14 for
Malaysia. Generally speaking, such outliers highlight a mismatch between the proposed
model and the observed data, and point towards model inadequacy. However, we wish
to emphasize that this is not the case here. One key consideration is the effect of delay,
that is, whether or not the reported case numbers coincide with the day of testing. It is
highly likely that a lag occurred in the reporting of cases since the COVID-19 experience
was new to Malaysia. Based on the report [29], it is reasonable to assume that delays in
testing and reporting were expected during the initial days of the COVID-19 outbreak in
Malaysia. The peak on Day 14 seem to suggest a significant backlog of reporting of cases.

The effects of reporting delays on observed case trajectories and parameter inference
are illustrated here based on a simulation study. A delay-in-reporting model based
on the multinomial distribution is assumed: Let X ∼ M ult(Dt ; p1 , p2 , · · · , pK ), where
X = (X1 , X2 , · · · , XK ) with K = 5 and Xk is the number of cases (out of the total reported cases on day t, Dt ) that is to be redistributed to day t − k + 1 for k = 1, 2, · · · , K.
The probabilities pk , k = 1, 2, · · · , K are chosen according to a truncated geometric distribution taking values in k − 1 for k = 1, 2, · · · , K with success probability 0.4. The
cases redistribution model is applied to new cases reported from Day 10 until Day 15.
The redistributed reported case trajectory, the best fit curves and associated variabilities
are shown in Figure 9. Comparing Figures 7(a) and 9(b), one can immediately notice that
the reported case numbers in Figure 9(b) are better explained by the variabilities of the
underlying model and the negative binomial likelihood. Parameter estimates and credible
intervals for the redistributed case numbers are given in Table 4. We present the salient
findings here. Comparing Tables 1 and 4, we find that estimates of the infectious (both
symptomatic and asymptomatic) periods have now become shorter. This is expected and
reasonable since the model and likelihood do not have to account for the sudden steep
rise in cases on Day 14 by preferring a larger infectious period. Nevertheless, the new
infectious periods are still within the 6-8 day range and are consistent with previously
reported literature. The redistribution of case numbers have also reduced the uncertainty
around the MAP value of T ∗ = 18: The credible interval for T ∗ in Table 4 is narrower
compared to that in Table 1. The MAP estimate of a1 is now −2.075, which is closer to
that of Selangor compared to Sarawak.
A final point to be discussed is our preference for the negative binomial likelihood
compared to the more traditional Poisson likelihood for modelling COVID-19 case numbers. Our initial investigation used the Poisson likelihood for reported case numbers but
we found that the underlying model together with the Poisson likelihood was not able to
capture inherent variabilities in the observed data. Hence, we opted for the overdispersed
negative binomial likelihood which was able to satisfactorily represent the observed data
via its overdispersion parameter τ . This is evidenced by the variability bands presented
in Figures 7 and 9(b) which successfully enclose most of the reported case numbers. This
coverage is further improved in Figure 9(b) by a redistribution of delayed cases. We also
provide the loglikelihood values corresponding to the Poisson and negative binomial observation models in Table 5 for Malaysia (with original case numbers), Malaysia (with
redistributed case numbers), Selangor and Sarawak. Note that the negative binomial loglikelihood values are consistently larger than the Poisson counterparts indicating a better
model fit to observed data.

Conclusion

Quantitative models and assessment of the impacts of the Sri Petaling gathering and implementation of MCO on COVID-19 spread in Malaysia are developed in this paper. The
MCO implementation is found to be highly effective in containing (an exponential rise
of) the COVID-19 outbreak in Malaysia. The analysis here quantitatively demonstrates
how quickly transmission rates fall under effective NPI implemention within a short time
period. Higher disease transmission is found in Selangor (a state with higher population
density) compared to Sarawak. We also found that under MCO, the decline in transmission was faster in Selangor compared to Sarawak. The rise and fall of disease transmission
in Selangor mirrored the national level whereas Sarawak showed a more gradual increase
and decrease in COVID-19 transmission. The change points were mostly found to be
close to the date of MCO implementation (18th March 2020) although Sarawak exhibited a larger uncertainty around that date due to its gradual and slower increasing and
decreasing trends of reported case numbers. Our study developed a new model to represent COVID-19 spread in Malaysia that accounts for heterogeneity and asymptomatic
transmissions. We found that reported case numbers in Malaysia exhibited large variabilities which can possibly be attributed to a delay in reporting, particularly during the
early stages of the pandemic as the experience with handling COVID-19 was new to the
country. Nevertheless, the model developed here together with the overdispersed negative
binomial likelihood are able to capture salient features of COVID-19 spread in Malaysia
and provide reliable quantitative assessments even under the challenges of limited and
delayed data.

We describe the prior elicitation for the initial number of infectious and exposed individuals, i0 and e0 , respectively, relevant only for WL . Conditional on δ and γo , i0 (corresponding to observed, not cryptic) is given the prior elicitation π(i0 | γo , δ) = U (mi0 −
∆i0 , mi0 + ∆i0 ) for some mi0 and ∆i0 . This prior, π(i0 | γo , δ), on i0 is motivated from
(9) based on the differential equation for the Ro compartment. Note that Ṙo (t) = γo Io (t)
from (9), and hence, i0 = Ṙo (0)/γo . To obtain an estimate of Ṙo (0), a second order
polynomial is fitted using least squares to the trajectory of cumulative cases in a window
of m ≥ 3 days starting from T0 ≡ 0. Ṙo (0) is then estimated by Ṗ (0) where Ṗ (t) is the
first derivative of the fitted polynomial, P (t). The mean of the uniform distribution on i0
is taken to be mi0 = Ṗ (0)/γo . The initial number of exposed individuals, e0 , is given the
prior elicitation π(e0 | γo , δ, p) = U (me0 − ∆e0 , me0 + ∆e0 ) for some me0 and ∆e0 . To find
an expression for me0 , we rewrite (8) and note that e0 = (I˙o (0) + γo Io (0))/(p δ). Next,
substituting Ṗ (0)/γo for Io (0), the mean of the uniform distribution on e0 is taken as
me0 = (P̈ (0) + γo Ṗ (0))/(γo p δ) where P̈ (t) is the second derivative of P (t) with respect
to t. The half-widths for both priors on i0 and e0 are taken as ∆i0 = ∆e0 = 5. Thus, the
initial prior distributions on i0 and e0 are based on the number of infectives and exposed
in the original population; so they are un-normalized. This is because their estimates
are calculated from reported case data. But these estimates are later normalized by the
population size for input into the SIER and modified SEIR models.
The hyperparameters aξ and bξ for ξ ∈ {µ, γo , γc , δ, p, wi,o , wi,c , ws , α} are chosen based
on values reported in previous studies where available. For example, the incubation
period, defined as the period from being infected by COVID-19 to the onset of symptoms,
is typically reported to be between 6 and 8 days on average [30]. Hence, we take aδ = 6
and bδ = 8 for the prior elicitation of 1/δ. For the infectious period, we consider aγo = 6
and bγo = 8 to encompass corresponding values available from the literature; see, for
example, [16, 17, 18, 27]. The values of parameters reported in the literature are only
