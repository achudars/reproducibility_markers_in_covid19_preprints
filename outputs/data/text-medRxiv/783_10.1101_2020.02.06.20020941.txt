Abstract
Background: On January 23, 2020, a quarantine was imposed on travel in and out of Wuhan,
where the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak originated from. Previous analyses
estimated the basic epidemiological parameters using symptom onset dates of the confirmed
cases in Wuhan and outside China.
Methods: We obtained information on the 46 coronavirus cases who traveled from Wuhan
before January 23 and have been subsequently confirmed in Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Macau,
Singapore, and Taiwan as of February 5, 2020. Most cases have detailed travel history and
disease progress. Compared to previous analyses, an important distinction is that we used this
data to informatively simulate the infection time of each case using the symptom onset time,
previously reported incubation interval, and travel history. We then fitted a simple exponential
growth model with adjustment for the January 23 travel ban to the distribution of the simulated
infection time. We used a Bayesian analysis with diffuse priors to quantify the uncertainty of the
estimated epidemiological parameters. We performed sensitivity analysis to different choices of
incubation interval and the hyperparameters in the prior specification.
Results: We found that our model provides good fit to the distribution of the infection time.
Assuming the travel rate to the selected countries and regions is constant over the study period,
we found that the epidemic was doubling in size every 2.9 days (95% credible interval [CrI], 2
days—4.1 days). Using previously reported serial interval for 2019-nCoV, the estimated basic
reproduction number is 5.7 (95% CrI, 3.4—9.2). The estimates did not change substantially if we
assumed the travel rate doubled in the last 3 days before January 23, when we used previously
reported incubation interval for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), or when we changed
the hyperparameters in our prior specification.
Conclusions: Our estimated epidemiological parameters are higher than an earlier report using
confirmed cases in Wuhan. This indicates the 2019-nCoV could have been spreading faster than
previous estimates.

Main text
On December 31, 2019, the Health Commission in Wuhan, China, announced 27 cases of viral
pneumonia. On January 8, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention
announced that a novel coronavirus was the causative pathogen and was subsequently designated
as 2019-nCoV. Anxiety quickly grew in the general public after a preeminent Chinese
epidemiologist, Dr Zhong Nanshan, confirmed human-to-human transmission in a televised
interview in the evening of January 20, and three days later the entire city of Wuhan was put into
quarantine: all public transportation was suspended, and outbound trains and flights were halted.
As of February 6, 2020, more than 28,000 cases of 2019-nCoV have been confirmed globally.
Using the first 425 confirmed patients of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan, a previous report estimated that
the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days. With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days, the basic
reproduction number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4 – 3.9) (Li et al.,
2020). Using internationally exported cases from Wuhan (known days of symptom onset from
December 25, 2019 to January 19, 2020) and flight travel data, another report estimated that the
basic reproduction number is 2.7 (95% CrI, 2.5 – 2.9) (Wu et al., 2020). Other analyses using the
series of new confirmed cases have reported larger estimates of the basic reproduction number
(Read et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2020).

Methods
Dataset preparation and visualization
Using information published by governments and news media, we constructed a dataset of 2019nCoV patients that are confirmed outside mainland China as of February 4, 2020. We only kept
cases who resided in Wuhan or had recent travel history to Wuhan. We excluded patients who
arrived in these countries and regions after January 23 or were reported to have exposure to
2019-nCoV outside Wuhan. For each cluster of cases (two cases are considered to belong to the
same cluster if they had close contact outside Wuhan), we kept the first confirmed case and
discarded the other cases as they were likely infected during their travel outside Wuhan. We only
considered cases confirmed in Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Macau, Singapore, and Taiwan as
these governments provided detailed information on the confirmed cases. After applying this
selection criterion, we obtained a sample of 46 coronavirus cases who were most certainly
exported from Wuhan.
Based on the trajectories of these cases, we simulated the dates they were infected as follows.
Among the 46 cases, one (18th case in Singapore) has missing symptom onset dates. We used the
mice software package (van Buuren & Groothuis-Oudshoorn, 2011) to obtain 100 imputations of
the missing symptom onset date. For each imputation of symptom onset, we simulated the
infection time based on Gamma-distributed incubation period that are have the same mean (5.2
days) and 95th percentile (12.5 days) as previous estimates (Li et al., 2020). We repeated the
simulation until the infection time is consistent with the case’s trajectory and known exposure to
other confirmed cases. In particular, because infection must be prior to the patient’s arrival if we
assume all the cases were infected in Wuhan, this allows us to greatly narrow down the infection

time. We repeated the simulation of infection time for 100 times and obtained a distribution of
infection time for the 46 cases (Figure 1).

Statistical model
We modeled, 𝑊𝐼# , the number of new infections in Wuhan on day 𝑡 since December 1, 2019 and
assume it was growing exponentially up till January 23:
𝑊𝐼# = 𝑊𝐼' × 𝑒 +# , 1 ≤ 𝑡 ≤ 𝑁,
where 𝑟 is the growth exponent and 𝑁 = 31 + 23 = 54 is the length of the series considered.
We assumed, 𝑂𝐼# , the number of new infections in Wuhan on day 𝑡 who subsequently traveled to
one of the selected Asian countries and regions, follows a Poisson distribution:
@

𝑂𝐼# ~ 𝑃𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑜𝑛 <𝑊𝐼# × = 𝑂𝑅? B , 1 ≤ 𝑡 ≤ 𝑁,
?A#

where 𝑂𝑅? is the rate of travel on day 𝑠. The sum is from 𝑡 to 𝑁 because each person infected on
day 𝑡 can only travel out of Wuhan from day 𝑡 to day 𝑁 (corresponding to January 23, 2020
when all outbound trains and flights were halted). Since we collected this dataset 13 days after
the outbound travel e ban, which is more than the estimated 95th percentile of the incubation
period (Li et al., 2020), we assume that all 2019-nCoV cases traveled from Wuhan to the
selected countries and regions have already been confirmed.
We expected that the international travel from Wuhan was relatively stable during this period.
This motivated our working model for 𝑂𝑅? :
1. 𝑂𝑅? = 𝑂𝑅 for the entire study period;
We considered another two choices of the travel rate as sensitivity analysis:
2. 𝑂𝑅? = 𝑂𝑅 before January 21 and 𝑂𝑅? = 2 × 𝑂𝑅 on and after January 21;
3. 𝑂𝑅? = 0 before January 23 and 𝑂𝑅? = 𝑁 × 𝑂𝑅 on January 23.
The second choice is intended to model the possible panic effect after human-to-human
transmission was publicly confirmed. The third choice is impossibly extreme. We only included
it to compare our results with assuming a simple exponential model for 𝑂𝐼# with no offset,
thereby ignoring the effect of the January 23 travel ban.

Model fitting and statistical inference
We computed, 𝐸[𝑂𝐼# ], the mean of 𝑂𝐼# using the simulated distribution of infection dates. Using
data from January 1 to January 15, we fitted the following linear regression for log (𝐸 [𝑂𝐼# ]) with
offset log(𝑁 − 𝑡 + 1) that is derived from the statistical model above assuming constant travel
rate:
log( 𝐸 [𝑂𝐼# ]) − log(𝑁 − 𝑡 + 1) = log(𝑂𝑅 × 𝑊𝐼' ) + 𝑟𝑡.
We compared the fit of this model with the other two choices of the travel rate.
To quantify the uncertainty of the estimated growth exponent, we performed a Bayesian analysis
for this statistical model with diffuse priors. The prior we used for 𝑟 is an exponential
distribution with mean log(2) /7.4, matching the previously reported doubling time using cases
in Wuhan. The prior we used for 𝑊𝐼' is such that the number of new infections on January 1,
2020 has prior mean 50 and standard deviation 100. We used an exponential prior for 𝑂𝑅 whose
mean is computed from dividing the estimated number of travels from Wuhan to the selected

regions by the population of Wuhan. We expected that the posterior of the number of new
infections 𝑊𝐼# would be very sensitive to the choice of the prior mean of 𝑂𝑅, but the posterior of
the growth exponent would be insensitive to the choice of prior.
We fitted the models for 100 realizations of the infection counts from January 1 to January 20,
expecting the public confirmation of human-to-human transmission on January 20 might have
lowered the epidemic growth in the next few days. We did not use infections before January 1
because the simulation could be unreliable for early infections. We also fitted the models using
all infections as a sensitivity analysis. The Bayesian models were fitted using the rstan software
package in R (Carpenter et al., 2017). We computed the posterior means and credible intervals by
pooling posterior samples for different realizations of the infection counts.

Results
Simulated infection time
We obtained the distribution of the mean counts of new infections among the cases and found
that it was growing exponentially till January 18 but was dropping from January 19 to 23 (Figure
2, Panel A). This qualitative behavior contradicts an exponential growth model for 𝑂𝐼# (third
choice for 𝑂𝑅? ). However, the correction factor 𝑁 − 𝑡 + 1 is our working model predicts the
mean counts to be decreasing when
𝑑 +#
𝑒 (𝑁 − 𝑡 + 1) = 𝑒 +# (𝑟(𝑁 − 𝑡 + 1) − 1) < 0.
𝑑𝑡
This equation shows that the stationary point is 1/𝑟 days before January 24. The empirical
stationary point between January 19 and 20 puts 𝑟 between 0.2 and 0.25. Error bars in Panel A
also show that the uncertainty of the estimated mean infection counts due to using Monte-Carlo
simulations is small.
In fitted linear regressions for logarithm of mean infection counts versus, Modeling the effect of
the travel ban on January 23 (Panels B and C, Figure 2) visually improves the fit to the data
when compared to ignoring the travel ban (Panel D, Figure 2). The fitted growth exponent using
our working model was 𝑟 = 0.25 (Panel B). This is consistent with our prediction of 𝑟 in the last
paragraph based on the decreasing infections after January 19. On the contrary, if we assumed
the travel rate doubled in the last three days, a similar calculation shows that the stationary point
in Panel A should be around January 16. These qualitative assessments show that our working
model provide superior fit to the data.
To aide comparison, we included lines in panels B, C, and D, in Figure 2 corresponding to a
growth rate of 𝑟 = 0.11 or a doubling time of 6.4 days reported by a previous analysis (Wu et
al., 2020). This estimate did not fit the average infection counts well.

Epidemic growth
In our Bayesian model fitted using infections before January 21 and assuming constant travel
rate, the posterior mean of the growth exponent 𝑟 was 0.25 (95% CrI, 0.17 – 0.34). This
corresponds to a doubling time of 2.9 days (95% CrI, 2.0 days – 4.1 days) and basic reproduction

number of 5.7 (95% CrI, 3.4 – 9.2). The basic reproduction number is computed using the serial
interval previously reported for 2019-nCoV (Li et al., 2020).
We further performed a thorough sensitivity analysis of our results (Table 1 and Online
Supplement) using a different estimation period, the other two travel rates, and the incubation
period and serial interval reported for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Donnelly
et al., 2003; Lipsitch et al., 2003). We found that our estimated epidemiological parameters are
relatively insensitive to these choices unless we ignore the outbound travel ban on January 23.
We also performed a sensitivity analysis to the prior chosen for the rate of travel. Not
surprisingly, we found that the estimated growth exponent is not sensitive to the choice, but the
total number of infections are very sensitive to the choice (Online Supplement).

Discussion
Our analysis reported a much higher growth rate of the early 2019-nCoV outbreak in Wuhan. A
direct comparison can be drawn with a previous analysis that also used internationally confirmed
cases to infer the epidemic size and growth in Wuhan (Wu et al., 2020). However, their
estimated doubling time is 6.4 days (95% CrI, 5.8 days – 7.1 days). Another report (Li et al.,
2020) using the cases in Wuhan estimated the doubling time to be 7.4 days (4.2 days – 14 days).
These estimates did not fit our simulated distribution of infections well, even with our
impossibly extreme assumption of the travel rate (Figure 2, Panel D). This shows that the
epidemic may have been spreading much faster in Wuhan than these earlier estimates.
There are several possible explanations for the large difference in epidemiological estimates.
One possible reason is the different study sample. The previous reports used internationally
confirmed cases as of January 28 and the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan. In comparison, we
used confirmed cases in 6 selected countries and regions with detailed case reports as of
February 4. Our selected countries and regions also have good public health surveillance systems
and could more easily identified suspected cases in border control. Another key distinction is that
our analysis used the simulated infection time instead of the noisier symptom onset as in the
previous analyses. By using the cases’ travel history (in particular, international arrival date), we
can narrow down when the cases were infected. This reduces the noise in our estimates.
A third distinction with the analysis by (Wu et al., 2020) is that our model takes into account the
restricted outbound travel from Wuhan since January 23, 2020 --- a milestone event in this
epidemic. The analysis by (Wu et al., 2020) used a more complicated susceptible-exposedinfectious-recovered (SEIR) model and only accounted for the quarantine of Wuhan in their
forecast but not in their estimation. Ignoring the travel ban since January 23 could also produce
much smaller growth rate in our model. However, we have convincingly demonstrated that this
leads to very poor fit of the distribution of infection time.
Our analysis should be viewed in terms of its limitations. The international cases are only
“shadows” of the epidemic in Wuhan and we relied on the assumption that they form a
representative sample. We used a simple exponential growth model for the new infections and
did not account for the dynamics of the epidemics like a SEIR model. We assumed a constant

rate of travel in the study period which might not approximate the travel pattern in Wuhan---a
transportation hub in central China---very well. In particular, millions of people (substantial
proportion of the Wuhan population) traveled back home from Wuhan before the Lunar New
Year, which we did not consider in our model. Finally, our estimates are relatively but not
entirely insensitive to the incubation period which are crucial in simulating the infection time.
Despite these potential limitations, we convincingly demonstrated that a simple theoretical model
--- exponential growth with correction for the travel ban on January 23 --- provides very good fit
to the internationally confirmed cases with detailed case trajectories. Our results suggest that the
early outbreak of 2019-nCoV could have been spreading much faster in Wuhan than previous
estimates. This has important implications in designing prevention measures to control the
outbreak in other cities in China and around the world. On the more positive side, our simulated
infection rates in January 21 to 23 showed visually significant departure from the previous
growth pattern (Panel B, Figure 2). This gives some evidence that the prevention measures
following the public confirmation of human-to-human transmission in the evening of January 20
were effective.

infection dates simulated from symptom onset dates and assumed incubation period that are consistent with the patients’
exposure history to Wuhan. Red and blue error bars are the one standard error of the mean counts due to Monte-Carlo
simulations. Grey dots are 10 realizations of the simulated infection counts. Panel B,C&D: Fitted linear regression for logarithm
of the mean counts versus time with different offsets (B: assume constant travel rate; C: assume travel rate doubled from
