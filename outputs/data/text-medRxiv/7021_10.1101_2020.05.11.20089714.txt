Article abstract
Background and Purpose—
There is increasing recognition of a relatively high burden of pre-existing cardiovascular disease in
Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infected patients. We determined the burden of pre-existing
cardiovascular disease in persons residing in United States (US) who are at risk for severe COVID-19
infection.

Methods—
Age (≥60 years), presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, mellitus,
hypertension, and/or malignancy were used to identify persons at risk for admission to intensive
care unit, or invasive ventilation, or death with COVID-19 infection. Persons were classified as low
risk (no risk factors), moderate risk (1 risk factor), and high risk (two or more risk factors present)
using nationally representative sample of US adults from National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey 2017-2018 survey.
Results—
Among a total of 5856 participants, 2386 (40.7%) were considered low risk, 1325 (22.6%) moderate
risk, and 2145 persons (36.6%) as high risk for severe COVID-19 infection. The proportion of patients
who had pre-existing stroke increased from 0.6% to 10.5% in low risk patients to high risk patients
(odds ratio [OR]19.9, 95% confidence interval [CI]11.6-34.3). The proportion of who had pre-existing
myocardial infection (MI) increased from 0.4% to 10.4% in low risk patients to high risk patients (OR
30.6, 95% CI 15.7-59.8).

Conclusions—
A large proportion of persons in US who are at risk for developing severe COVID-19 infection are
expected to have pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Further studies need to identify whether
targeted strategies towards cardiovascular diseases can reduce the mortality in COVID-19 infected
patients.

Pre-existing cardiovascular disease has been identified in 8-15% of patients with Corona
Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection who were hospitalized in China1, 2 and increased ICU
admission and in hospital mortality. 2 The existing data from China but may not be applicable to
United States (US) due to lower proportion of hypertension and dyslipidemia and higher proportion
of cigarette smoking in Chinese population.3 Knowledge of burden of pre-existing cardiovascular
disease in persons at risk for severe COVID-19 infection may be important to determine the
cardiovascular needs due to rapid increase in COVID-19 infected patients in US. We performed this
analysis to examine the prevalence of pre-existing cardiovascular disease in patients at high risk
of severe COVID-19 infection defined by admission to intensive care unit, or invasive ventilation, or
death in a nationally representative sample of the US population.
METHODS
Defining persons at high risk for severe COVID-19 infection
We dichotomized age as <60 and ≥60 years for identifying patients at risk for severe COVID19 infection (ICU admission and mortality) based on a previous study.2 Guan et al.4 identified
presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, mellitus, hypertension, or malignancy
as predictors for composite endpoint of admission to intensive care unit, or invasive ventilation, or
death among 1590 COVID-19 infected patients who were hospitalized in one of the 575 hospitals
within China. The risk was higher if 2 or more risk factors were present in the same individual.
US nationally representative data
We used the most recent nationally representative sample of US adults from population
screened in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2017-2018 survey
cycle. 5 The NHANES represents the noninstitutionalized civilian resident population of US. Persons

are derived from a stratified multistage probability sample. Data was collected by directly
interviewing survey participants and by conducting clinical tests and physical examinations.
Identification of high risk for severe COVID-19 infection
We included persons aged ≥18 years in the analysis. Presence of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and malignancy was ascertained by reviewing
answers to query during interview if a doctor or other health professional had told them if they had
the abovementioned diseases. Presence of hypertension was also identified if the mean of 4
properly measured BP readings was equal or greater than 140/90 mm Hg. Diabetes mellitus was
also identified if HbA1c, glycated hemoglobin was greater than 6.4%. Persons were classified as low
risk (no risk factors), moderate risk (1 risk factor), and high risk (two or more risk factors present).
Identification of pre-existing cardiovascular disease
Persons were considered as having had a stroke or myocardial infarction (MI) if they
reported that they had been told by a physician that they had suffered a stroke or heart attack.
Statistical analysis
The analysis was descriptive and proportion (percentage with or without 95% confidence
interval [CI]) of persons with pre-existing stroke and MI were presented. The crude odd ratio (OR)
with 95% CI was calculated when relevant.
RESULTS
Among a total of 5856 participants, 2386 (40.7%) were considered low risk, 1325 (22.6%)
moderate risk, and 2145 persons (36.6%) as high risk for severe COVID-19 infection. The proportion
of patients who had pre-existing stroke increased from 0.6% to 10.5% in low risk patients to high
risk patients (OR 19.9, 95% CI 11.6-34.3, Table 1). The proportion of who had pre-existing MI increased

from 0.4% to 10.4% in low risk patients to high risk patients (OR 30.6, 95% CI 15.7-59.8). The
distribution of persons with pre-existing stroke or MI in various strata (gender and race/ethnicity)
is presented in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. The highest burden of preexisting stroke was seen in
non-Hispanic black persons and non-Hispanic white persons with lowest prevalence seen in
Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic Asian in high risk strata. The highest burden of preexisting MI
was seen in non-Hispanic white persons. There was a higher proportion of men (compared with
women) with preexisting MI in high risk strata.
DISCUSSION
The relatively high prevalence (approximately 10%) of either pre-existing stroke or MI in
persons in US at risk for severe COVID-19 infection needs to be recognized. The odds of either preexisting stroke or MI was 19 to 30 folds higher in high risk persons compared with low risk persons.
The United States demographic data suggest that there are 209,128,094 adults (aged ≥18 years)
residing in United States 6. Assuming 36.6% (76,540,882 persons) of the US adult population is high
risk, and 10.5% of those who would either have pre-existing stroke or MI, 8,036,793 persons in US
may acquire severe COVID-19 infection with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. The reason for
concurrent existence is probably related to common risk factors such as old age, hypertension,
diabetes mellitus, and malignancy.7 The burden of pre-existing MI was higher in high risk men than
women but no difference was noted in burden of pre-existing stroke in high risk men than women.
The burden was disproportionate between various race/ethnic groups with highest prevalence in
non-Hispanic white persons.
The definitions of MI and stroke were based on self-reported physician diagnoses. Selfreport for history of stroke has a sensitivity and specificity of 95% and 96%, respectively. 8 Self-

report of prevalent MI has a high sensitivity (74% to 100%) and specificity (94% to 99%). 9, 10 Previous
studies have suggested that self-reported diagnoses in the NHANES surveys is reasonably
accurate.11 A study12 found interview reports using the same question for MI as that used in NHANES
2017-2018 had a true positive rate of 83% when compared with hospitalization records in 10,523
participants from NHANES I. The study also noted high specificity observed for self-reported
hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia.
A large proportion of persons in US who are at risk for developing severe COVID-19 infection
are expected to have pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Pre-existing cardiovascular disease
increased the risk higher risk of myocardial injury13 and new stroke14 and in hospital mortality13, 14 in
COVID-19 infected patients. Further studies need to identify whether targeted strategies towards
cardiovascular diseases in such patients can reduce the mortality in COVID-19 infected patients.
Disclosures: None.
