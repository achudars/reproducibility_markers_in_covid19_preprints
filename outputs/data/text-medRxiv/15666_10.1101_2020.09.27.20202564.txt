Abstract
The IFR (Infection Fatality Risk) is one of the most important parameters of
an infectious disease. If properly estimated, the observed number of deaths
divided by the IFR can be used to estimate the current number of infections
and, if immunity is permanent, we can estimate the fraction of susceptible which
can be used to plan reopening of activities and vaccine deployment, when these
become available. Here we suggest how to use the observed deaths by COVID19 in an arbitrary population as a surrogate for the progression of the epidemic
with the purpose of decision making. We compare several estimates of IFR
for SARS-CoV-2 with our estimate that uses the number of additional deaths
in households in a database population of 159,150 laboratory-confirmed (RTqPCR) COVID-19 by SARS-COV-2 in Mexico. The main result is that if the
number of deaths in a region is close to 2 per thousand individuals, the fraction
of remaining susceptible may be too small for the vaccine to make a difference
in the total number of infected.

1. Introduction
COVID-19 pandemic has shown to have a low lethality, nevertheless, the
burden of the disease so far is huge. Economical activities are suspended or
reduced and there is pressure for reopening of schools which requires more in5

formation, not only available to policymakers but also to the general public, to
ameliorate civic unrest. The competition for developing a vaccine is keen, with
about 321 vaccine candidates with 32 in clinical trials in progress (Le et al.,
2020), raising safety concerns (Harrison and Wu, 2020; Peeples, 2020), and the
additional economic cost for the purchase and deployment of vaccines has not

10

been yet added to the burden of the disease.
At the moment, without vaccines or effective pharmaceutical treatments
available, the decision on whether reopening activities or not depends mostly on
the number of additional infections/deaths that will be caused because of some
policy, say, opening schools, allowing public gatherings, opening touristic places,

15

increasing the current density allowed in some places as cinemas, restaurants,
buses, and planes, etc. For a highly infectious virus as SARS-CoV-2, the decision
must be rooted in the amount of remaining susceptible in the region affected
for some change in policy.
Using the number of individuals that access private of public hospitals as a

20

surrogate of the current number of infections, or even the number of confirmed
cases, is not accurate, because those quantities strongly depend on the availability of medical services that are not always accessible to the bulk of a population
in many countries, or simply because of lack of resources for test deployment or
because of policies that disregard testing. The number of deaths is less dubious.

25

if we manage to calculate the average number of infections that will result in
the death of the average individual, then, we can use this number to estimate
the number of infections that were required to observe the current number of
deaths, and from here, the share of susceptible available in a well-defined population. Even although deaths were not reported as COVID-19 related, records

30

may exist that shed light on the likelihood that death was or not caused by

SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is part of the policy adopted by some countries
like Belgium, which is, without doubt, one of the reasons why this country keeps
one of the highest number of deaths per capita in Europe.
Before proceeding, we need to deploy two facts. The first one attempts to
35

establish that, with few exceptions, it is almost impossible to stop the pandemic
by mitigation and control measures, and the most we can do is reducing the infection rate (at a huge economic and social cost) which is known as flattening the
curve. The second establishes that we are in the condition now to have reliable
lower bound estimates for IFR, the Infection Fatality Risk of SARS-CoV-2. It

40

is the confluence of these two facts that allow us to establish a surrogate for the
progression of the epidemic in a region and thus, for the calculation of the share
of susceptible available, which is the basis to decide on reopening activities and
vaccine deployment.

Fact 1: SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and will infect most of the
45

population
Several studies have shown that the basic reproductive number R0 is high
(Sanche et al., 2020; D’Arienzo and Coniglio, 2020; Najafimehr et al., 2020; Liu
et al., 2020; Alimohamadi et al., 2020), and it has been calculated as high as
5.7. It is important to remember that R0 is the potential of disease transmission

50

in the absence of any control or mitigation measures, and it is the potential
that comes into play as soon as control or mitigation measures are suspended.
We calculated the R0 for 40 countries using only the first two weeks of data,
analyzing the progression in the number of deaths. These 40 countries were
the first countries affected by pandemics except for China. The R0 calculated

55

is shown in Figure 1. The estimation of the true potential of the disease is
more evident for those countries that were affected first (e.g. Italy and Spain),
where our estimate of R0 is about the same as the reported by Sanche et al.
(2020). The learning curve is evident in the reduction of R0 when the pandemic
advances. Estimates of R0 in countries where the pandemic arrived at later

Days from the beginning of the pandemic

Figure 1: Age of the pandemic vs. R0 . For each country, the baseline was taken as the date
when the accumulated number of deaths was at least 5. Day zero is 02/24/2020. See Table 1
for expanded data.

Table (1) in Appendix contains the main statistics derived from the analysis
of λ and R0 for the countries analyzed. From the estimated λ’s, we can see
that the first countries to be affected had an R0 larger than 5 whereas this was
65

decreasing to achieve values just above 2.5, this implies that at the beginning
λ was as high as one effective contact every three days to one effective contact
every 5 days, on average.
There are some facts we need to consider when a virus spreads with that
strength: first, forecasting the size of the epidemics (total number of infected)

70

is simpler, since social contact structures are bypassed and become irrelevant,
and thus the contact network resembles more a random mixing pattern. For
this random mixing, the estimated fraction of infected f , can be approximated

(Kermack and McKendrick, 1927) with:
f = 1 − e−R0 f

(for a probabilistic derivation, see Hernandez-Suarez and Mendoza-Cano, 2009).
75

For instance, if R0 = 5.7 the fraction of infected is f = 0.99. However, if we
manage to reduce R0 by half, f = 0.93, which is not a big difference in the size
of the epidemic. Nevertheless, reducing R0 by half is an incredible task that
involves mainly lockdowns and face-masks, and the former has a huge economic
cost that can not hold for long except for rich countries or countries whose

80

political or cultural organization allows its implementation. Nevertheless, even
if a country manages to implement actions to reduce R0 to a value smaller to one,
and can support citizens economically to maintain the lockdown for long periods,
a handful of infected individuals that enter the country from abroad can restart
the infection process, if lockdowns are lifted. From here, the observed waves

85

(see Figure 2 for examples in Japan, Cuba, S. Korea and New Zealand). This
is particularly true for a disease where the number of asymptomatic individuals
is by far, larger than that of symptomatic and thus, difficult to control. As a
consequence, equation (1) can be seen as a quota that must be fulfilled, as long
as the fraction of remaining susceptible is larger than f .

Fact 2: the overall IFR of SARS-CoV-2 is somewhere between 0.2
and 0.3 %
All calculations in this section are done with the data on deaths reported to
10/29/2020 (Dong et al., 2020). Also, in this section we use IFR to indicate the
true overall Infection Fatality Risk of SARS-CoV-2, that is, it is the fraction of

95

individuals that die if infected with SARS-CoV-2, whereas IFR∗ indicates some
estimate of IFR for a region of interest. Many attempts have been made to estimate this important parameter that would be a remarkable surrogate to measure
the progress of the epidemics in an arbitrarily defined region or population, but
the main inconvenient is that while the number of deaths from SARS-CoV-2

Figure 2: The appearance of a second wave. Cumulated deaths per day. The use of
deaths instead of confirmed cases delays the detection of a wave but is more efficient in the
sense that does not depend on testing policies, availability or panic. The current IFR∗ (per
million inhabitants) is Japan: 14; Cuba: 11; S. Korea: 9; New Zealand: 5. Data updated to

can be approximated, the denominator, the total number of infected from the
disease is elusive, especially considering that a large fraction of individuals that
are infected are asymptomatic. Besides, the efficacy of immunity tests to detect
who has been infected and recovered has been challenged with the findings that
the ability to detect antibodies is reduced in a few days, especially in those with

105

mild or no symptoms (Long et al., 2020; Ibarrondo et al.). Recently, Eyre et al.
(2020) reported that a high fraction of individuals with none or mild symptoms
may be undiagnosed mainly due to the calibration strategies of some standardized tests and concluded that samples from individuals with mild/asymptomatic
infection should be included in SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay evaluations.

110

Some studies to estimate the IFR have been recently released for Iceland
(Gudbjartsson et al.), India (Mukhopadhyay and Chakraborty, 2020), Germany
(Streeck et al., 2020) and Denmark (Erikstrup et al., 2020) among others. In a
review of 23 studies where the IFR was estimated Ioannidis (2020) a median of

0.25% is reported, which is about 2.5 deaths for each 1000 individuals. The study
115

in Iceland, (Gudbjartsson et al.), the most comprehensive to date, proposes an
IFR of 0.3% (95% CI, 0.2 to 0.6). Special care must be taken with this later
estimate, since Iceland has a population of 321,641, with only 29 deaths so far.
In other studies that used transmission models fed with serological data, the IFR
estimates where as high as 2.5-5 (Thorne, 2020) and 3-8 (Roques et al., 2020)

120

per thousand infections. Wilson (2020) estimated the IFR using serological
data from New York City and arrived to an IFR estimate of 8.6. We believe
this particular estimate is too high, and will support our claim analyzing the
behavior of the epidemic in some regions. The reason of such a high estimate
may be the sampling scheme, which was not random at all, and would explain

125

the high discrepancy between the observed differences in the number of infected
between males and females (15.9 and 12 percent respectively) which the authors
acknowledge they can’t explain.
Estimation of the IFR using an alternative method
Hernandez-Suarez et al. (2020) proposed an alternative method to estimate

130

the IFR based on the assumption that all those living with an infected individual
will be infected. We use the same data set that has grown from 3,193 households
to 131,240 households. The essence of the method is as follows: let nj be the
number of individuals living in a house where an infected was confirmed infected
with SARS-CoV-2, whose symptoms started on day dj . Let xj the number of

135

deaths among the remaining nj − 1 individuals whose symptoms started after
day dj , then, an estimate of the IFR is:

IFR = P

In this example we build an approximation to (2) using a database from
Mexico’s IMSS (Instituto Mexicano de Seguro Social), the Mexican Institute
for Social Insurance. The database has 212,935 (laboratory-confirmed (quanti140

consider only households with final outcomes we excluded cases with symptoms
onset in the last 6 weeks before the final case recorded, that is, we considered
only cases with symptom onset from April 1 to August 6, 2020. The final data

set has 135,855 cases. The mean age of this final set was 47.9 years with a
standard deviation of 16.5 years and median 47 years. From these, there were
54 % males and 46 % females. Tables 2 and 3 contain summary statistics from
the final data set.
Every individual has an associated NSS (Social Security Number) that is

150

shared among all members of a family. As an approximation, we assumed all
individuals sharing the same NSS live in the same household, and then grouped
the cases in households. If there were more than one case in a household, we only
considered the household if all cases were already solved a deaths or recoveries.
In every household with more than one case we consider the index case as the

155

individual with the earliest symptom onset and counted the number of deaths
among the remaining members of the house. From the final set of 131,240
households, there were 130,248 with no deaths among the remaining members
of the household and 992 houses with at least one additional death (see Table
1).

From Table 1 we have

an estimate with the number of households times the average household size,
that is, 131, 240 × µ where µ = 3.7 (Encuesta Intercensal, 2015). Using (2) we
have our estimate of IFR is

IFR* =

131, 240(µ − 1)

(3)

that is, 3.1 cases per thousand infected, which is close to 2.5, the median of 23
165

studies reported in Ioannidis (2020) and very similar to the 3.0 recently derived
from the study in Iceland (Gudbjartsson et al.) Special care must be taken
with our estimate (3) since we are building a rough approximation to the total
number of additional individuals living in each household.
If the disease will affect most of the population, as suggested previously,

170

then, the most effective way to estimate the overall IFR is by measuring the
fraction of deaths in a population in which the epidemic has evolved for a long
time and it is over or near the end. It is evident that we need to focus in regions
with: a) high observed IFR∗ and b) lack of new waves. Such is the case of
regions as New Jersey and New York states (see figure 3). The current IFR∗

175

calculated for these states is 1.854 and 1.729 respectively.
The lack of new waves in these two states indicates that the virus has infected
and killed a fraction of individuals close to the IFR, and thus the epidemic
rampaged those states and it stopped due to what is commonly called herd
immunity, that actually conveys no immunity at all, but a lack of a significative

180

mass of susceptible for the R0 to be effective. Thus, the progression of the
epidemic in a region can be estimated with IFR ∗ /IFR.

2. Consequences from the previous facts for vaccines and the return
to normality
As a consequence of the two previous facts, we can conclude that it is pos185

sible to monitor the development of the epidemic in a region by following the

3. Discussion
195

Because of the aforementioned facts, it is very important to monitor the
COVID-19 related deaths and every effort has to be made to improve current
estimates of the IFR. Hernandez-Suarez et al. (2020) suggested that in light
of the high contagiousness of SARS-CoV-2, the secondary cases resulting in
fatalities in a household with at least one confirmed infected, may be useful

200

to estimate the IFR, which would provide a large amount of data and minimal testing requirements. Antibody testing in New York shows to date (Data
updated to 10/29/2020) that out of 2,608,997 tests, 642,977 were positive for
antibodies (NYC-Health) which implies 24% of the population may be immune,
contradicting our findings that for an IFR as high as 2.5 per thousand the per-

205

centage of infected should be close to 70% already (see Figure 4). Nevertheless,
the fraction of people with antibodies is not a good surrogate of the fraction
of infected with SARS-CoV-2 because it underestimates the number of infected

for two reasons: first, antibody testing is voluntary and it is natural to expect
that individuals with no symptoms are less compelled to be tested than those
210

symptomatic, so, a large fraction of infected is not tested, and second, we already mentioned some failures in testing reported, apparently due to calibration
procedures that tend to fail in individuals with none or mild symptoms (Eyre
et al., 2020).
The idea that the share of susceptible in New Jersey is relatively small, is sup-

215

ported on the fact that the number of active cases reported to date (10/29/2020)
is close to 42,000 and unless they are fully quarantined the infectious pressure
from these individuals and those unreported must be huge, nevertheless, no new
significant peak is observed. The same happens in New York, although the share
of susceptible is higher.

220

Everything leads to the following question: what will be the purpose of a
vaccine in a region where the IFR∗ is already large enough to suggest there is
only a small fraction of susceptible with limited chance of infection? This question is especially valid from the comprehensive study in Iceland that strongly
suggests the existence of immunity due to infection (Gudbjartsson et al.). Un-

225

less it is proven that immunity wanes beyond a protective level after some time,
everything seems to indicate that those regions where the share of estimated
susceptible is already low, should have less priority in the distribution of vaccines. If facts 1 and 2 are not taken into account, a vaccination campaign in a
region where the proportion of deaths among the population is close to the IFR,

230

will just give the impression of being effective but will not play a role, regardless
of the efficacy of the vaccine.
