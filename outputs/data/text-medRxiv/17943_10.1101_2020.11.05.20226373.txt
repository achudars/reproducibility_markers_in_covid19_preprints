Abstract
Background: Remdesivir is the current recommended anti-viral treatment in moderate-tosevere COVID-19. However, data on several aspects of its use such as impact of timing of
therapy, efficacy, and safety in this severity category are limited. The current study aimed to
evaluate the impact of timing of remdesivir initiation (symptom-onset to remdesivir treatment
[SORT] interval) on in-hospital all-cause mortality in patients with moderate-to-severe COVID19.
Methods: This retrospective study was conducted between June 25, 2020 and October 3,
2020, at a tertiary care dedicated COVID center in India. Consecutive patients with moderate-tosevere COVID-19 (moderate: SpO2 <94%; severe: SpO2 <90%) were included. Data were
collected from the health records of the hospital. Remdesivir was administered along with other
standard medications as per protocol. The main outcome was the impact of SORT interval on
in-hospital all-cause mortality. Subgroups were formed based on SORT interval. Other
measures analyzed included overall in-hospital mortality, length of hospital stay, and safety.
Results: Of 350 patients treated with remdesivir, 346 were included for the final analysis
(males: 270 [78.0%]; median [range] age: 60 [24-94] years). Overall, 243 (70.2%) patients had
≥1 comorbidity; 109 (31.5%) patients had moderate disease, 237 (68.5%) had severe disease,
and 50 (14.5%) patients required mechanical ventilation. Of the 346 patients, 76 (22.0%)
patients died (moderate: 3 [2.8%], severe: 73 [30.8%]). In the subset of mechanically ventilated
patients, 43 (86.0%) died. All-cause mortality was significantly lower in patients with SORT
interval ≤9 days (n = 260) compared with those with SORT interval >9 days (n = 86; 18.1% vs
33.7%; P = .004). The odds of death were significantly lower in patients with SORT interval ≤9
days vs >9 days (odds ratio = 0.44; 95% CI, 0.25-0.76; P = .004). Adverse events (transaminitis
≥5 times upper limit of normal or estimated glomerular filtration rate <30ml/min) leading to drug
discontinuation were seen in 4 (1.1%) patients.
Conclusion: In this large series of moderate-to-severe COVID-19, initiation of remdesivir ≤9
days from symptom-onset was associated with a significant mortality benefit. These findings
indicate a treatment window and reinforce the need for earlier remdesivir initiation in moderateto-severe COVID-19 infection.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),1 has resulted in more than 1.18 million deaths worldwide as of
October 31, 2020.2
Remdesivir, a nucleotide analog prodrug with broad antiviral activity, has demonstrated
in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 and in vivo activity in a primate model of SARS-CoV-2
infection.3,4 Remdesivir received FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) on May 1, 2020 for
treatment of moderate-to-severe COVID-19.5 On October 22, 2020, the FDA approved
remdesivir as the first COVID-19 anti-viral agent in adult and pediatric patients (aged ≥12 years
and weighing at least 40 kg) requiring hospitalization.6
The efficacy and safety of remdesivir in COVID-19 have been studied in a few clinical
trials.

7–10

In a randomized double-blind trial, hospitalized COVID-19 patients treated with

remdesivir had a shorter time to recovery and a trend towards lower mortality at 15 and 29 days
compared with placebo.10 Research indicates the potential benefits of early initiation of
remdesivir in patients with COVID-19. Remdesivir therapy was associated with earlier clinical
improvement (18 vs 23 days) and trend towards a lower 28-day mortality (11% vs 15%) in adult
patients hospitalized for severe COVID-19 treated within 10 days of symptoms compared with
placebo.7 However, the recent WHO sponsored Solidarity trial results raised several questions
on the efficacy of remdesivir in COVID-19.11
Inconsistent data about the efficacy of remdesivir are attributable to various factors
including the heterogenous nature of COVID-19 treatment in the pandemic as treatment options
evolved, lack of clarity of the optimal timing of initiation of the drug, treatment efficacy assessed
from either ‘symptom-onset’ or ‘diagnosis-onset,’ and the difference in ‘standard of care’ across
the globe. Specifically, the relationship between timing of remdesivir initiation (from symptom
onset) and outcomes has not been clearly elucidated. There is a need to evaluate the effect of
optimal remdesivir initiation timing that would improve outcomes in COVID-19, especially in the
sicker subsets of moderate-to-severe disease. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of
symptom-onset to remdesivir treatment (SORT) interval on clinical outcomes in the subsets of
moderate-to-severe COVID-19.

in Bangalore, India. Data on patient demographics, clinical characteristics, and outcomes were
collected from health records of the hospital. Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional
Review Board of the participating site. De-identified patient data were used for analysis.
Study Population
Inclusion criteria were hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection as confirmed by reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction assay, radiologic evidence of pneumonia, and
peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) of <94% (while breathing room air).
Moderate disease was defined as presence of hypoxia (SpO2 <94%, range: 90%-94%)
while breathing room air and respiratory rate ≥24 breaths per minute.12,13 Severe disease was
defined as presence of clinical signs of pneumonia and one of the following criteria: SpO2 <90%
while breathing room air, respiratory rate >30 breaths per minute, heart rate >120 beats per
minute, presence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis or septic shock.12,13
Treatment
Patients received intravenous remdesivir 200 mg on day 1 as loading dose, followed by a
maintenance dose of 100 mg daily for a total of 5 to 10 days, manufactured by three different
pharmaceutical companies. Patients also received other drugs as per protocol, including
corticosteroids, anticoagulants, and other supportive therapy. Few patients also received other
experimental therapies, including convalescent plasma, tocilizumab, and thrombolytics.
Outcome Measures
Data on clinical and laboratory findings, including mortality, length of hospital stay (LOHS), and
safety outcomes (adverse events [AEs], serious adverse events [SAEs], and suspected drugrelated hypersensitivity reactions) were extracted from the medical records.
Demographic parameters analyzed included age, sex, and comorbidities (diabetes
mellitus, hypertension, CKD, chronic heart disease [CHD], and chronic respiratory diseases
among others). The main outcome measure analyzed was the impact of SORT interval on inhospital all-cause mortality. Other outcomes analyzed included in-hospital all-cause mortality,
AEs, SAEs, treatment-emergent AEs, and overall LOHS.

Statistical Analysis
Results were summarized descriptively as numbers and percentages, means and standard
deviations, or medians and inter-quartile ranges. The difference between means of continuous

variables was assessed using t-test/Mann Whitney-U test and difference between proportions of
categorical variables, using Fisher’s exact test/Chi-square test.
Kaplan-Meier plots were used to determine the impact of SORT interval (≤6 vs >6, ≤7 vs
>7, ≤8 vs >8, ≤9 vs >9, and ≤10 vs >10 days) on survival probability (all-cause mortality) and the
differences in the sub-groups were determined using log-rank test. Multivariate regression
analysis was carried out to compare mortality outcomes of the cohorts with a specific SORT
interval based on information derived from the Kaplan-Meier plots, and odds ratios (ORs) and
95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated.
Differences in outcomes between the study groups were considered significant if P
<0.05 (two-sided). All statistical calculations were performed using R software (R 4.0.2).
Results
A total of 350 patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 infection received remdesivir, of
which 346 were included for the final analysis (4 patients were excluded due to SAEs leading to
drug discontinuation). The median (range) age was 60 (24-94) years, with the majority being
male (n = 270; 78.0%; Table 1). Among the hospitalized patients, one-third had moderate
disease (n = 109; 31.5%), and 237 (68.5%) had severe disease. Fifty patients (14.5%) required
mechanical ventilation. Most of the patients had ≥1 comorbidity (n = 243; 70.2%), including
diabetes mellitus (n = 173; 50.0%), hypertension (n = 163; 47.1%), CHD (n = 54; 15.6%), CKD
(n = 18; 5.2%), and chronic respiratory disease (asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
[COPD]; n = 12; 3.5%).
In addition to remdesivir, all patients received corticosteroids, 131 (37.9%) received
convalescent plasma, and 37 (10.7%) received tocilizumab.
Of the 346 admitted patients, 270 (78.0%) were discharged, and 76 (22.0%) died (Table
2). In the moderate group, 106 (97.2%) patients were discharged, and 3 (2.8%) died. In the
severe group, 164 (69.2%) patients were discharged, and 73 (30.8%) died. In the mechanically
ventilated patients, 7 (14.0%) patients were discharged, and 43 (86.0%) died.
The median (interquartile range [IQR]) LOHS was 11 (7-16) days in the overall group, 9
(6-12) days in the moderate group, and 13 (8-18) days in the severe group. In mechanically
ventilated patients, the overall LOHS was 10 (6-17) days and in those who survived, it was 25
(17-30) days.
Kaplan-Meier plots demonstrated significant difference in the probability of survival for
SORT interval ≤9 vs >9 days (P = .03; eFigure 1) but not for the other intervals. Based on this,

the two subgroups of SORT interval ≤9 vs >9 days were further analyzed to evaluate the impact
of the timing of remdesivir initiation on outcomes.
Table 3 shows characteristics and outcomes of patients with SORT interval ≤9 vs >9
days. The demographic (age and gender) and clinical characteristics (comorbidities and severity
distribution) were comparable between the two groups. Overall, 260 (75.1%) patients had a
SORT interval of ≤9 days, while 86 (24.9%) had a SORT interval of >9 days (Table 3). All-cause
mortality was significantly lower in the former group compared with the latter group (18.1% vs
33.7%; P = .004). Although not statistically significant, the median LOHS was numerically lower
in patients with SORT interval ≤9 days compared with >9 days (10 v 12 days; P = .34).
In multivariate analysis, the odds of death were significantly lower in patients with SORT
interval ≤9 days compared with SORT >9 days (OR = 0.44; 95% CI, 0.25-0.76; P = .004). When
analysis was performed based on disease severity, the odds of death were significantly lower in
severe COVID-19 patients with SORT interval ≤9 days compared with >9 days (OR = 0.40; 95%
CI, 0.22-0.72; P = .003) (Figure 1).
AE of transaminitis was observed in 44 (12.7%) patients and acute kidney injury (AKI) in
23 (6.6%) patients. Among the 350 patients, SAEs leading to drug discontinuation were
observed in 4 (1.1%) patients. Of these, 1 (0.3%) patient (moderate COVID-19) had
transaminitis >5 times upper limit of normal (after 3 doses) and was discharged uneventfully; 3
(0.9%) patients had AKI (estimated glomerular filtration rate <30 mL/min after 3 doses in 2
patients and after 2 doses in 1 patient), of which 2 patients survived (moderate COVID-19, n =
1; severe COVID-19, n = 1) whereas 1 patient (severe COVID-19) died. No hypersensitivity
reactions were noted.

Discussion
This study primarily evaluated the association between SORT interval and clinical
outcomes in moderate-to-severe COVID-19 and other relevant clinical endpoints, such as
overall all-cause mortality, LOHS, and safety in remdesivir-treated patients. The majority of
patients in this cohort had severe disease (68.5%) and reported ≥1 comorbidity (70.2%).
Patients with SORT interval ≤9 days showed favorable outcomes with lower mortality (18.1% vs
33.7%) compared with SORT interval >9 days, with the difference driven largely by the severe
subset. The overall all-cause mortality in this cohort was 22.0%, with higher mortality in severe
disease (30.8%), particularly in mechanically ventilated patients (86.0%). Median LOHS for all
patients was 11 days, slightly longer in severe disease (13 days).

Most global studies have evaluated the effects of remdesivir in COVID-19 by comparing
with placebo or different durations of treatment (Table 4). These studies have focused primarily
on clinical recovery, with no categorical reports correlating SORT interval (early vs late initiation)
and mortality. Clinical benefits of early treatment have been demonstrated in rhesus macaques
(a primate model) infected with SARS-CoV-2.4 The current hypothesis is that an anti-viral is
maximally effective when administered in the earlier stage of the disease when there is active
viral replication, and it is important to define that window period. Additionally, considering that
the first clinical indicator of viral replication, namely symptom onset after initial exposure is an
average of 5 days, minimizing the interval between symptom-onset and treatment initiation
assumes greater importance. Our subgroup analysis showed a significant benefit on all-cause
mortality (18.1% vs 33.7%; P = .004) in patients with SORT interval ≤9 days vs >9 days.
Further, in those with severe disease, the odds of death were significantly lower with SORT
interval ≤9 days vs >9 days (OR = 0.40; 95% CI, 0.22-0.72; P = .003), suggesting a beneficial
effect of earlier remdesivir treatment on survival predominantly in severe disease. Reviewing
prior literature, in the Adaptive Covid-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT-1) final report, median duration
between symptom onset and treatment was 9 days. Patients who received remdesivir within 10
days of symptom onset had a rate ratio for clinical recovery of 1.37 (95% CI, 1.14-1.64),
compared to 1.20 (95% CI, 0.94-1.52) in those who received remdesivir after 10 days; however,
there was no mortality benefit mentioned.10 Similarly, in the study of 237 patients by Wang et al,
patients treated within 10 days of symptom onset had a lower 28-day mortality vs placebo (11%
vs 15%; difference -3.6% [95% CI, -16.2 to 8.9]).7 However, no comparison was made between
early vs late treatment among remdesivir-treated patients. In the study by Goldman et al, in
patients not requiring mechanical ventilation, a higher proportion who had symptoms for <10
days were discharged from the hospital than patients who had symptoms for ≥10 days before
receiving the first dose of remdesivir (62% vs 49%).9 However, mortality with respect to SORT
interval was not reported.
The more recent WHO Solidarity trial (under review) included a large number of patients
on remdesivir (n = 2743), but did not analyze outcomes based on SORT interval.11 The lack of
benefit on mortality and other outcomes in the preliminary Solidarity trial results may be due to a
‘lumper’ phenomenon with many medications studied, and details of the relationship between
SORT interval and mortality outcomes were not reported. Our study demonstrates the mortality
advantage of SORT interval up to 9 days in moderate-to-severe COVID-19 indicating the
window for optimal impact of the medication in this severity class. Thus, the cardinal difference
between our study and other robust trials is the mortality benefit observed with earlier initiation

of the drug, thereby defining the ‘SORT window.’ Though previous studies have considered 811 days as the median time from symptom-onset to treatment for analyzing various
outcomes,7,9,10 our study provides an objective cut-off of 9 days for mortality benefit, and also
reiterates the need to consider ‘symptom-onset’ and not ‘date of diagnosis’ as the target for
intervention.
The mortality and recovery time/discharge rates reported in the published studies vary
widely based on factors such as patient selection, disease severity (defined differently in various
studies), treatment duration, and the stage of the pandemic reflecting change in therapeutic
regimens. In our study, 76 (22.0%) patients died, a higher mortality rate compared with patients
treated with remdesivir in the pivotal ACTT-1 trial (overall mortality: 6.7% at day 15; 11.4% at
day 29),10 study by Wang et al (overall mortality: 14% at day 28),7 study by Goldman et al
(overall mortality at day 14: 8% in 5-day and 11% in 10-day remdesivir treatment group
respectively),9 and the Solidarity trial (overall mortality at day 28: 12.5%).11 The higher mortality
rate in our cohort could be due to greater severity of illness, as we included moderate-to-severe
cohort. While 13.9% of patients on remdesivir in the ACTT-1 and 24.1% in the Solidarity trial did
not receive supplemental oxygen,10,11 all patients in our study required oxygen.
Our study as compared to ACTT-1,10 had a higher percentage of males (78.0% vs
65.1%). Patients with hypertension (47.1%) in our study were comparable to the remdesivir
group in the ACTT-1 (50.6%)10 and the study by Wang et al (46%).7 However, patients with
diabetes mellitus in the current study (50.0%) were higher than the ACCT-1 trial (30.8%) and
the study by Wang et al (25%). Of note, COVID-19 mortality is higher in patients with these
comorbidities14,15 and the role of remdesivir assumes greater importance. The higher
percentage of males, those with diabetes mellitus, and all patients requiring oxygen are all
factors which may explain the overall higher mortality in our cohort.
In the present study, the overall median (IQR) LOHS was 11 (7-16) days (moderate
disease: 9 [6-12] days; severe disease: 13 [8-18] days). The median LOHS in the severe group
in our study was substantially lower than in Wang et al (median [IQR]: 25.0 [16.0-38.0] days).7
However, comparison between the two studies is limited because of the differences in study
design (retrospective vs randomized control trial [RCT]), geographical location, and local
country protocols for discharge at that time in the pandemic, which may have impacted duration
of hospitalization.
In our study, AKI was observed in 6.6% of patients (n = 23), lower than that reported by
Antinori et al (22.8%).16 AE of transaminitis was observed in 44 (12.7%) patients, lower than that
reported by Spinner et al (alanine aminotransferase increase: 32%-34%; aspartate

aminotransferase increase: 32%).8 SAEs leading to drug discontinuation were observed in 4 out
of 350 patients (3 [0.9%] due to AKI and one [0.3%] due to transaminitis). Our low
discontinuation rates reiterate the importance of liver and renal function monitoring while on
remdesivir and the adequate hydration followed in this cohort.
It is noteworthy to mention the recent studies and events that have preceded our study.
Studies on several aspects of COVID-19 therapeutics, due to rapidly evolving data, have been
confounded by a temporal bias of heterogeneity of treatment that can have a substantial impact
on the conclusions. For example, steroids in moderate doses are being uniformly used only
after July 2020, when results of the Randomized Evaluation of Covid-19 Therapy (RECOVERY)
trial were released.17 Trials without steroids or a mixed population with/without steroids, would
likely report a different outcome compared to studies with uniform steroid use. In addition, the
inpatient pandemic-readiness from the point-of-view of infrastructure-personnel (e.g., intensive
care unit [ICU], ventilators, high flow nasal cannula, non-invasive ventilation) is better in the
latter half of the pandemic (post-June 2020) compared to earlier (March to June 2020) that may
also influence outcomes. In the earlier part of the pandemic, data collection and reporting were
also challenging as healthcare systems scrambled to manage the unprecedented burden, which
is reflected in the minimalistic requirements of information in the Solidarity trial. Our study
reflects real-world practice in the latter part of the pandemic, and includes a uniform steroid use,
a well-prepared healthcare system and ICU infrastructure, and adequate access and uniform
use of remdesivir. The importance of early remdesivir initiation (SORT interval ≤9 days) in our
study with a clear outcome benefit indicates an impact of the medication even with steroids and
ancillary therapies in moderate-to-severe COVID-19.
Our study has some limitations, such as the retrospective nature of the study and the
lack of a control group. However, the main outcome measure here is the impact of SORT
interval ≤9 days and >9 days, when all patients received remdesivir. On a real-world practice
front, with an EUA from the FDA for remdesivir for moderate-to-severe COVID-19 at the time of
the study, it was not ethically possible to do a RCT with a placebo group in this subset of sick
patients. Further, our study did not evaluate the optimal duration of remdesivir treatment (5 vs
10 days), and cannot comment on the specific subset of mechanically ventilated patients, where
role of the drug is controversial. Additionally, it is difficult to delineate the impact of remdesivir
from other COVID-19-validated medications such as steroids, as this is one of the first studies to
report uniform use of both these agents. However, the observation that mortality increased after
9 days, when steroids are known to be maximally useful, strongly suggests that the mortality
benefit of SORT interval ≤9 days can be attributed to remdesivir. Additionally, we used

remdesivir preparations from three different companies as the demand increased exponentially
and the pharmaceutical industry geared up to handle the need.
Conclusions
In summary, our study is one of the first to show that in the subset of hospitalized moderate-tosevere COVID-19 patients, SORT interval ≤9 days is associated with a mortality benefit. Our
findings reinforce the need to consider earlier remdesivir initiation from symptom onset in
moderate-to-severe COVID-19 infection.
