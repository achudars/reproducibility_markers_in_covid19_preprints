Abstract

27

Background: The SARS-CoV-2 virus emerged in December 2019 and caused a

28

pandemic associated with a spectrum of COVID-19 disease ranging from

29

asymptomatic to lethal infection. Serology testing is important for diagnosis of

30

infection, determining infection attack rates and immunity in the population. It also

31

informs vaccine development. Although several serology tests are in use, improving

32

their specificity and sensitivity for early diagnosis on the one hand and for detecting

33

past infection for population-based studies, are priorities.

34

Methods: We evaluated the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody profiles to 15 SARS-CoV-2

35

antigens by cloning and expressing 15 open reading frames (ORFs) in mammalian

36

cells and screened antibody responses to them in COVID-19 patients using the

37

Luciferase Immunoprecipitation System (LIPS).

38

Results: The LIPS technique allowed us to detect antibody responses in COVID-19

39

patients to 11 of the 15 SARS-CoV-2 antigens tested, identifying novel immunogenic

40

targets. This technique shows that antigens ORF3b and ORF8 allow detection of

41

antibody early in infection in a specific manner and reveals the immuno-dominance of

42

the N antigen in COVID-19 patients.

43

Conclusion: Our report provides an unbiased characterization of antibody responses

44

to a range of SARS-CoV-2 antigens. The combination of 3 SARS-CoV-2 antibody

45

LIPS assays, i.e. N, ORF3b, and ORF8, is sufficient to identify all COVID-19 patients

46

of our cohort even at early time-points of illness, whilst Spike alone fails to do so.

47

Furthermore, our study highlights the importance of investigating new immunogens

48

NSP1, ORF3b, ORF7a and ORF8 which may mediate immune functions other than

49

neutralization which may be beneficial or harmful to the patient.

Introduction

51

The acute pandemic respiratory disease COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus

52

that belongs to the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus

53

(SARS-CoV-2) (1, 2). There are at least 70 vaccine candidates against COVID-19 in

54

various stages of testing, development and human clinical trials (5). Urgency in

55

vaccine development and deployment to mitigate the pandemic has left some

56

fundamental immunological research questions outstanding, especially regarding the

57

range of virus immunogens that elicit antibody responses, their kinetics, specificity,

58

breadth, longevity and impact for long-term protection or immune-pathology.

59

Endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV) OC43, 229E, HKU1 and NL63 usually

60

cause a mild ‘common cold’- like upper respiratory disease. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to

61

the β-coronavirus genus which includes SARS-CoV which emerged in 2002, and

62

Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) which emerged in

63

2012, which are severe human diseases of zoonotic origin (4). As of 20th of April

64

2020, the World Health Organization has reported a total of 2,241,778 cases of

65

COVID-19 worldwide and 152,551 deaths (5). Ongoing research has reported the full

66

genome sequence (1), transcriptome (6) and the immune response to infection (7).

67

SARS-CoV-2 has 12 putative functional open reading frames (ORF) and

68

shares 82% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV (8). There are at least four

69

structural proteins in SARS-CoV-2: Spike (S), Envelope (E), Membrane (M),

70

Nucleocapsid (N). The trimer S protein is cleaved into S1, containing the receptor

71

binding domain, and S2 subunits (8, 9), and S2 is further cleaved into S2’ to form the

72

viral fusion peptide (6). The S protein is critical for viral entry and is a neutralising

73

target, as it is with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and is a key target for diagnostic tests

74

and vaccine development (10). The S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 shares about 70%

75

identity with the SARS-CoV, whereas the identity of the S2 subunit is up to 99% with

76

some evidence of cross-reactivity between the viruses (11). Apart from these

77

structural proteins, the SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes for around 20 putative non-

78

structural proteins (8). ORF1a/b encodes for a large polyprotein that is proteolytically

79

cleaved into 16 non-structural proteins (NSP1-16). Extra ORFs, such as ORF3a, 3b,

80

6, 7a, 7b, 8 and 10 may encode for proteins but their functions are unknown.

81

Encouragingly, reports have shown that SARS-CoV-2 patients develop

82

neutralising and high titer S1-specific antibody responses (11), and robust T and B

83

cellular responses (12). However, the magnitude of the antibody responses appears

84

related to the clinical severity of COVID-19 disease. In one recent report 10 of 175

85

confirmed patients did not develop a neutralising SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody

86

response (by pseudo particle assay), but binding antibodies were still detected (by

87

ELISA) (13). In patients with MERS (14) it has been shown that viral load and severe

88

disease correlates with the magnitude of the antibody response, however mild

89

diseases (in 4 of 6 mild subjects) may not lead to detectable antibody responses.

90

Furthermore, MERS-CoV seropositive dromedary camels can still be re-infected in

91

the presence of high antibody titers (15). Similarly, there are reports of waning of S1-

92

specific and neutralising antibodies in SARS-CoV infection (16). These instances of

93

low or no antibody responses by traditional serological approaches may lead to an

94

underestimation of asymptomatic and mild infection, and threaten the success of a

95

potential vaccine that targets the S1 alone. Therefore, a broader landscape of

96

antibody responses to a range of viral proteins needs to be assessed to better detect

97

the immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 infection to improve the understanding of

98

pathogenesis and immunity.

The Luciferase Immunoprecipitation system (LIPS) assay allows for a comprehensive

100

understanding of the antibody immune response against infectious agents (17) by the

101

expression of any protein or antigen as a recombinant Renilla luciferase (Ruc)-

102

antigen fusion. The LIPS technique has previously been used to distinguish infected

103

versus vaccinated cases for influenza due to the presence of antibodies against non-

104

structural proteins (18), and to characterize human infections by zoonotic spill over

105

from bat viruses (19). In this study, we used LIPS to assess the acute and

106

convalescent antibody responses to a panel of 15 potential SARS-CoV-2 antigens:

107

the 4 structural proteins (S, N, M and E), 3 S subunits (S1, S2, S2’), the 7 available

108

ORFs (ORF3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8 and 10) and 1 relevant NSP within ORF1a/b (NSP1)

109

(20). Our data reports the most extensive landscape of antibody responses of

110

COVID-19 patients reported to date.

RESULTS

112

We made a panel of fifteen SARS-CoV-2 ORFs as Renilla luciferase–antigen fusion

113

proteins to assess the humoral immune responses in 15 COVID-19 infected patients

114

from Hong Kong compared with a panel of healthy negative controls using LIPS. The

115

four SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins show high amino-acid sequence homology with

116

SARS-CoV but not with other human coronaviruses responsible for common colds

117

(Supplementary Table 1). We detected significantly higher antibody responses to the

118

full Spike protein (S), the Nucleoprotein (N) and the Membrane protein (M) in COVID-

119

19 patients compared to healthy negative controls (p <0.0001, p=0.023, and

120

p=0.0116 respectively, Figure 1bcd). COVID-19 patients did not show any increased

121

production of Envelope (E) antibodies (Figure 1e) compared to healthy negative

122

controls (p=0.0591, Figure 1d).

123

We confirmed our results by traditional IgG ELISA, which correlated well with LIPS

124

LU responses (R2=0.5289) for full-S (Supplementary figure 1ab). N-specific IgG by

125

ELISA is also elevated in COVID-19 patients (Supplementary figure 1c) but does not

126

correlate strongly with LIPS results (Supplementary figure 1d).

127

The S1 subunit, a key virus immunogen, detected significantly higher

128

antibodies in COVID-19 patients than negative controls (5191+/-1469 LU versus

129

4003+/-1062 LU, p=0.0288, Figure 2a). Interestingly, there was no difference in the

130

antibodies to S2 in the LIPS assay between COVID-19 patients and negative controls

131

(p=0.5683). Antibodies to the S2’ cleaved subunit were significantly higher in COVID-

132

19 patients (p=0.0391 for S2’, Figure 2) but the overall in antibody levels between the

133

groups was considerable. Patients with higher SARS-CoV-2 micro neutralization

134

(MN) titers (>160 reciprocal serum dilution) also had higher responses towards full-S

135

by LIPS, whilst there was no difference observed in LIPS responses to subunits S1,

136

S2 and S2’ in high or low MN COVID-19 patients (Figure 2c, p=0.0049).

137

We

138

uncharacterized ORFS to the SARS-CoV-2. As we could not produce the full

139

ORF1ab due to its extended length (>21,000 bp, (1)), we cloned and expressed a

140

representative antigen, non-structural protein 1 (NSP1). Bioinformatic predictions

141

have revealed a putative role for NSP1 in suppressing the antiviral host response (8).

142

We used LIPS to detect antibodies specific to NSP1, ORF3a, ORF3b, ORF6,

143

ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8 and ORF10 (Figure 3). COVID-19 patients had significantly

144

higher NSP1-antibody levels compared to negative controls (mean of 5301+/-854.7

145

LU versus 3683+/-726.4 LU, p<0.0001, Figure 3a). Furthermore, significantly higher

146

antibody levels in COVID-19 patients were detected towards ORF3a, ORF3b,

147

ORF7a, ORF7b and ORF8 (p=0.0302, p<0.0001, p<0.0001, p=0.0019, p<0.0001,

148

Figure 3b, c, e, f, g). The largest difference between COVID-19 and negative controls

149

in mean antibody signals among the ORFs was observed for ORF3b (7712+/-2947

150

LU versus 3599+/-1029 LU) and ORF8 (16933+/-7489 LU versus 5440+/-1096 LU)

151

(Figure 3c and g). Meanwhile there was no significant difference between COVID-19

152

patients and negative controls for ORF6 and ORF10 antigens (Figure 3d and h).

153

Globally, among the antibody responses tested in our LIPS assay, we detected

154

significant levels of antibodies specific to 11 antigens: N, M, S, S1, S2’, NSP1,

155

ORF3a, ORF3b, ORF7a, ORF7b and ORF6 in the COVID-19 population (Table 1) at

156

all time-points of infection from day 4 to day 22 (see below in Figure 4 for early time-

157

point detection). We did not detect a significant production of antibodies to 4 of the

158

SARS-CoV-2 antigens tested: E, S2, ORF6 and ORF10 proteins.

159

Comparison of the global SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses from 15 COVID-19

160

patients reveals that anti-N antibodies dominate the humoral response detected by

161

LIPS (Figure 3i), whilst other antigens make lower and similar contributions to the

162

magnitude anti-SARS-Cov-2 antibody responses (Figure 5a).

163
164

Absence of sex- and age- effect in our cohort

165

Epidemiological data from many countries suggest that men develop more severe

166

COVID-19 related symptoms than women (21). We therefore evaluated the effect of

167

gender in our cohort of COVID-19 patients for antibody responses and found no

168

difference across all antigenic targets tested (p=0.6289, Supplementary Figure 2a).

169

Similarly, the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response was comparable between patients

170

aged below and above 60 years old (p=0.9363, Supplementary Figure 2b).

171
172

Combined antigen test panels as a potential diagnostic tool for COVID-19

173

We found significantly higher levels of 11 of the 15 antigens tested in the COVID-19

174

populations. Next, their ability to correctly identify COVID-19 patients was

175

determined. Therefore, a cut-off value of LIPS antibody signals, based on the mean

176

plus three standard deviations of the healthy negative control group (22-24), was

177

calculated for each of these 11 antigens, along with the sensitivity and specificity of

178

each test (Table 3, and Figure 4). The cut-off value of all 11 tests showed a high

179

specificity of the SARS-CoV-2 LIPS assays with no samples from the negative

180

control group being above the cut-off. On the other hand, 8 antigens showed a low

181

sensitivity (below 75% for M, S, S1, S2’, NSP1, ORF3a, ORF7a, ORF7b, Figure 4b),

182

hence being insufficient to correctly identify all the COVID-19 patients with high rates

183

of false negatives (Table 3), limiting their use for LIPS diagnostics. On the other

184

hand, the N, ORF3b and ORF8 antigens showed good sensitivity levels of 93.3%,

185

86.6% and 100% respectively (Table 3). Of note, ORF8 is the only of the 11 tests to

186

correctly identify all COVID-19 patients including at day 4 after onset of illness

187

(Figure 4a).

188

As many LIPS tests showed low sensitivity, we then used an approach based on the

189

combination of LIPS antibody LU signals for the 11 separate SARS-CoV-2 antigen

190

tests to efficiently detect SARS-CoV-2 exposure in this population (22-24). This

191

approach of combining the LU values from the 11 LIPS tests increased the sensitivity

192

to 100% for the diagnosis of COVID-19 infections during acute infection (Figure 5a,

193

blue dots for <14 days). Furthermore, combination of only 3 LIPS tests, those for

194

anti-N, ORF3b and ORF8 antibodies, also has a 100% sensitivity and specificity

195

(Figure 5b and Table 3). As ORF3b and ORF8 show the lowest homology to previous

196

SARS-CoV among all the viral proteins (8), we also looked separately at the

197

combination of responses towards ORF3b and ORF8 (Figure 5c). We observed the

198

same trend as above with all COVID-19 patients having a combined score above the

199

cut-off and all negative controls having a combined score below, and all early time-

200

points being correctly detected (Figure 4c). By combining only the 3 relevant Spike

201

protein LIPS tests (S, S1, S2’), the sensitivity of the LIPS test drastically decreased to

202

26.6% as only 4 of the 15 COVID-19 patients had a total combined LU above the cut-

203

off (Figure 5d). Interestingly all samples from early time-points (day 4 to day 13) had

204

LU signals under the cut-off value for S+S1+S2’ (blue dots, Figure 5d). The

205

magnitude of the 11 relevant antigens, N+ORF3b+ORF8, as well as ORF3b+ORF8

206

responses significantly increase the detection of patients with early time-points

207

samples (Figure 5e, f). Therefore, the combinational use of ORF3b and ORF8 tests

208

alone could be sufficient to detect COVID-19 exposed subjects at any time-point of

209

infection.

210

Because endemic HCoVs are ubiquitous, the negative control plasma samples are

211

likely to have antibodies to a range of HCoVs. Sequence homology with other HCoV

212

could result in the detection of cross-reactive antibodies by LIPS and reduce

213

specificity of serological assays. Structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 with other HCoV

214

structural proteins only share 18 to 40% homology (Supplementary table 1), making

215

potential cross-reactivity of existing antibodies unlikely and undetermined. Whilst

216

SARS-Cov-2 and SARS-CoV, N and S share 94% and 76% conservation

217

(Supplementary table 1), previous reports showed the lowest homology for ORF3b

218

and ORF8 at 32% and 40% amino acid homology respectively (8), making them the

219

most unique genes to SARS-CoV2.

220

To investigate specificity of the antibody responses to the panel of antigens, we

221

subtracted the mean LU levels of healthy negative controls from the mean LU of

222

COVID-19 infected patients and compared this difference across each antigen

223

(Figure 5b). We found that this difference was significantly higher for the N-specific

224

antibody response compared to all the other relevant antibody responses (M, S, S1,

225

S2’, NSP1, ORF3a, ORF3b, ORF7a, ORF7b, and ORF8) (p<0.0001, Figure 5b),

226

highlighting a possible dominance and specificity of N across the SARS-CoV-2

227

humoral immune responses. Besides N, the ORF8 and ORF3b also appear to be

228

important antigenic targets (Figure 5h, i). Statistical analysis (ANOVA) revealed that

229

ORF8 was significantly increased compared to all other antigens (p<0.0001 versus

230

10 remaining antigens: M, S, S1, S2’, NSP1, ORF3a, 3b, 7a, and 7b, Figure 5bc).

231

Whilst results for ORF3b were significant against the remaining 8 antigens (M, S, S1,

232

S2’, NSP1, ORF3a, 3b, and 7b), excluding ORF7a (Figure 5c). Therefore, ORF3b

233

and ORF8 are newly identified as specific and unique antigenic targets.

234
235

DISCUSSION

236

SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing is an important component of the options for diagnosis

237

of recent and past COVID-19 infection. Antibody tests are crucial for determining

238

infection attack rates in the population, population immunity and inform vaccine

239

development. We report, for the first time, the detection of antibody responses

240

directed against an extensive spectrum of the SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Several

241

approaches have been developed to measure SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies,

242

including micro neutralization assays (virus or pseudo virus-based (25)), ELISA

243

assays

244

immunochromatographic assays (27), and peptide/protein microarray (28) (29).

245

Using LIPS technology with crude lysates from transfected cells, we have screened

246

all the structural proteins along with all the ORFs of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (NSP1

247

only for ORF1ab) to identify new and unique antigenic targets of the humoral immune

248

response of COVID-19 patients.

249

Among the 15 proteins tested for antibody specificity, 11 antigens showed

250

significantly higher responses in the COVID-19 patients compared to healthy pre-

251

pandemic negative controls. For the Spike subunits, only antibodies to S1 and S2’

252

were elevated in COVID-19 patients by our LIPS test, and S2 responses were not

253

significantly different from the control group. The trimer S conformation and

254

maturation of viral particles by the cleavage of S2 during virus endocytosis to form

255

the S2’ fusion peptide may result in a difference in their antigenicity. Patients with

256

higher MN titer had correspondingly higher levels of full-Spike LIPS and ELISA

We next cloned all the available ORFs of the virus ORF1ab (as NSP1 only), ORF3a,

261

ORF3b, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8 and ORF10, to acquire more extensive

262

information of the immunogenic targets of the virus. We found that 6 of these 8 ORFs

263

induced a humoral immune response in the patients (NSP1 (ORF1ab), ORF3a,

264

ORF3b, ORF7a, ORF7b and ORF8). Furthermore, by calculating a cut-off value

265

based on the mean of the negative population + 3 standard deviations, we could

266

ascertain that only 3 out of these 11 antigens were useful in diagnostic tests with high

267

performance: N, ORF3b, and ORF8. By using the combined results of several

268

antibody signals and calculating a cut-off value for these responses, we found that

269

the sum of the 11 relevant antibody tests was highly sensitive and specific. Moreover,

270

combining only the 3 of the most informative and sensitive antigens, N, ORF3b and

271

ORF8, we achieved a sensitivity and specificity of 100%, correctly identifying all the

272

COVID-19 patients versus negative controls. A larger data set from COVID-19

273

patients and negative controls is needed to further refine and confirm the

274

performance of our test (30).

275

The Spike protein is responsible for virus entry into host cells and is the main antigen

276

that elicits neutralizing antibodies (10). Whilst we detected significant differences in

277

the magnitude of responses by LIPS between patients and controls for S, S1 and

278

S2’, these antigens did not show high sensitivity levels, especially for sera collected

279

early post disease onset. The Spike protein is a trimer on the surface of virions, and

280

the conformation of our Ruc-S antigen should be assessed by conformation

281

dependent monoclonal antibodies to confirm whether the conformation of S protein in

282

our assay is well retained for antibody binding and affinity (31). Further LIPS tests

283

using the S RBD antigen alone are underway to assess the proportion of RBD-

284

specific antibodies as an important target of neutralizing antibodies (31). The S

285

protein also elicits non-neutralizing antibodies targeted to conserved epitopes (11),

286

and among our cohort an absence of in vitro neutralization has been observed for

287

some patients, especially at early time-points.

288

The combination of multiple antigens by LIPS beyond the Spike could be the basis

289

for supplementary serological tests useful to determine SARS-CoV-2 exposure to

290

overcome false negative results. We found that the single test detection of N, S or

291

ORF3b antibodies at early time-points (day 4 to day 14) results in a high proportion of

292

false negative results, whilst the minimal combination of N+ORF3b+ORF8 LIPS tests

293

is highly sensitive and specific.

294

Importantly, ORF3b and ORF8 are the least identical proteins to SARS-CoV (8), and

295

they do not exist in other strains of human coronaviruses. However very little is

296

known about their function and expression. Previous reports found the ORF3b of

297

SARS-CoV plays an important role in the interaction with the innate immune system

298

through inhibition of type 1 Interferon synthesis (33). In SARS-CoV, ORF8 has been

299

shown to accumulate in the Endoplasmic Reticulum and mediate cell death by

300

autophagy (32). In SARS-CoV-2, the functions of these ORFs have yet to be

301

determined. Importantly, ORF8 can only be found in human and bat SARS-like CoV

302

(35), and in our results we observed very low background detection in negative

303

control plasma resulting in highly specific results. However, there are recent reports

304

of the deletion of ORF8 in a few Singaporean COVID-19 patients (34) but this is not

305

reported elsewhere. Whilst ORF8-deletion SARS-CoV-2 viruses had reduced

306

replicative fitness, this issue may undermine the utility of ORF8 alone in serological

13

307

testing. In addition, NSP1 and ORF7a LIPS tests showed high significance for

308

COVID-19 patients. Though little is known about their function, bioinformatic

309

predictions reveal that both NSP1 and ORF7a could be involved in suppressing the

310

antiviral host response (6, 8). Therefore, the combined use of multiple antigens that

311

are sensitive and specific is needed for diagnostic serology.

312

Most commercially available or published serological tests use only the S antigen,

313

with a few using both the S and N antigens (11, 36, 37). Using extensive testing of

314

the virus antigens, we have shown that additional targets are important for early

315

detection of antibody responses and identification of COVID-19 patients. Potential

316

cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with other coronaviruses antibodies

317

cannot be excluded, but several recent data report that this cross-reactivity is minimal

318

(26). Therefore, the approach of combining several relevant antigens that are unique

319

to SARS-CoV-2, and immunogenic boosting specific antibodies would overcome

320

issues of cross-reactivity and increase the sensitivity of serological assays.

321

Screening of additional negative pre-pandemic samples with our LIPS approach is

322

needed to refine issues of cross-reactivity with other HCoV. The high orders of

323

magnitude and range of antibody quantity measured by our SARS-CoV-2 LIPS assay

324

is an advantage compared to ELISA Optical Density measurements. These

325

advantages may help with the rapid screening of recovered COVID-19 patients for

326

elevated antibodies to donate serum for the treatment of other patients by passive

327

transfer (38).

328

Our study does not report on antibody functions and data on Fc mediated functions

329

of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are also still lacking (39). Therefore, Fc mediated

330

functions of antibodies directed against internal proteins from ORF3b and ORF8 will

331

be the focus of future studies. Furthermore, only IgG is bound to the protein A/G

14

332

used in the LIPS assays, therefore the use of protein L that binds the light chain of all

333

immunoglobulins could be of interest to detect IgM early responses in future

334

investigations. The E, S2, ORF6 and ORF10 antibodies did not show elevated levels

335

in COVID-19 patients in our assay, consistent with the findings of Wang H. et al. by

336

microarray (29). Further confirmation is needed using additional experimental

337

approaches before excluding their utility.

338

Our study is limited by small sample size and by the small number of sera collected

339

in the first few days after onset of symptoms. The absence of paired samples from

340

multiple time-points for the same patients is also a limitation. Longitudinal studies are

341

needed to further assess kinetics of antibody responses, especially to identify early

342

antibody responses for rapid diagnostic tests. The inclusion of additional time points,

343

greater sample size and asymptomatic cases are necessary to test the cut-off

344

sensitivity scores; and to confirm the diagnostic value of our LIPS assays and the

345

relevancy of ORF3b and ORF8 antibodies. Late-convalescent sera are needed to

346

assess antibody waning. We also need to investigate antibody profiles with disease

347

severity.

348

In conclusion, we found that COVID-19 patients not only produce antibodies to the

349

Spike protein, but also to other structural and non-structural proteins. The

350

nucleoprotein, and then ORF8, and ORF3 show an immunodominant and specific

351

humoral response compared with other SARS-CoV-2 antigenic targets tested. The

352

combined use of N+ORF3b+ORF8 provides a sensitive and specific method for the

353

detection of all COVID-19 patients in our cohort even at early time-points, whilst the

354

Spike protein does not. Our results provide insights into the overall spectrum of

355

antibody responses associated with COVID-19. We still need to investigate whether

356

antigens other than the virus spike confer protection. Such information will help

Methods

361

Patients and samples collection

362

Our study enrolled a total of 26 patients with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 infection

363

(Table 1). Fifteen patients were enrolled in Hong Kong (China, SAR) and all of them

364

provided informed consent. The study was approved by the institutional review board

365

of the Hong Kong West Cluster of the Hospital Authority of Hong Kong (approval

366

number: UW20-169). Plasma samples were collected from heparinized blood, and

367

heat-inactivated at 56oC, 30 mins. Gender- and age-matched plasma samples from

368

healthy subjects collected before the COVID-19 pandemic were used as negative

369

controls.

370
371

SARS-CoV-2 gene cloning

372

Based on previous studies describing the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 genome (1,

373

8), an extensive panel of 12 proteins (S, E, M, N, NSP1, ORF3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8, 10)

374

was chosen for antibody testing by LIPS. Primers for the amplification of SARS-CoV-

375

2 proteins were designed (See protein ID in Table 1, and primers sequences in

376

Supplementary table 2). A RT-PCR was performed using extracted SARS-CoV-2

377

vRNA to amplify target genes corresponding to Structural and Non-structural proteins

378

of the virus (Table 1, (6)) using Platinum SuperScriptIII One Step RT-PCR system.

379

The bands were then extracted using Qiagen gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Germany)

380

and digested with BamHI and NotI or KpnI-HF and XhoI (New England Biolabs,

381

USA). Extracted products were ligated using T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs)

382

into the pREN2 plasmid (from Peter Burbelo NDICR, NIH). Plasmids were

383

transformed using DH10B competent cells and purified using PureYield Plasmid

384

midi-prep system (Promega).

SARS-CoV-2 (Ruc)-antigen expression

387

Constructs with pREN2-Renilla luciferase plasmid containing the SARS-CoV-2

388

antigen of interest were transfected into Cos1 cells using Fugene 6 (Promega) as per

389

manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were harvested 48 hours later, lysed and

390

sonicated, and (Ruc)-antigen yields were measured using a Luminometer plate

391

reader (PerkinElmer) according to the protocol of Burbelo et al. (20).

392
393

Measurement of antibody responses using Luciferase Immunoprecipitation

394

System (LIPS)

395

The LIPS assays were performed following the protocol of Burbelo et al., with the

396

following modifications (20). Briefly, (Ruc)-antigen (1e7 per well) and plasma (heat

397

inactivated and diluted 1:100) were incubated for 2 hours with shaking at 800rpm.

398

Ultralink protein A/G beads were added to the (Ruc)-antigen and serum mixture in a

399

96-deep-well polypropylene microtiter plate and incubated for 2 hours with shaking at

400

800rpm. The entire volume was then transferred into HTS plates and washed as

401

previously described. The plate was read using QUANTI-Luc Gold substrate

402

(Invivogen, rep-qlcg5) as per manufacturer’s instructions and a MicroBeta JET

403

luminometer (PerkinElmer). Experimental controls include blank wells with antigens

404

and negative control serum from age matched non-infected patient plasma collected

405

prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.

409

ELISA assays were performed with the available SARS-CoV-2 proteins Spike

410

(S1+S2) and Nucleoprotein (N) proteins. Briefly, recombinant S and N proteins

411

(Sinobiological) were coated on 96‐well flat‐bottom immunosorbent plates (Nunc

412

Immuno MaxiSorp, Roskilde, Denmark) at a concentration of 100 ng/ml, in 100/μl

413

coating buffer (PBS with 53% Na2CO3 and 42% NaHCO3, pH 9.6) at 4°C overnight.

414

An additional plate coated with a non‐specific protein (blocking buffer, PBS with 5%

415

FBS) was used to measure the background binding of each sample. Following FBS

416

blocking and thorough washing, diluted plasma samples (1:100) were bound for

417

2 hours, further washed and then detected by an anti‐human Ig secondary antibody

418

labelled with HRP specific for IgG (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).

419
420

Microneutralization assay

421

Plasma samples were diluted in serial two-fold dilutions commencing with a dilution

422

of 1:10, and mixed with equal volumes of SARS-CoV-2 at a dose of 200 tissue

423

culture infective doses 50% (TCID50) determined by Vero E6 cells respectively. After

424

1 hour of incubation at 37°C, 35µl of the virus-serum mixture was added in

425

quadruplicate to Vero or Vero E6 cell monolayers in 96-well microtiter plates. After 1

426

hour of adsorption, the virus-serum mixture was removed and replaced with 150µl of

427

virus growth medium in each well. The plates were incubated for 3 days at 37°C in

428

5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. Cytopathic effect was observed at day 3 post-

429

inoculation. The highest plasma dilution protecting 50% of the replicate wells was

430

denoted as the neutralizing antibody titer. A virus back-titration of the input virus was

431

included in each batch of tests.

Figure 5. Combining LIPS tests as a diagnostic tool for COVID-19. Cumulative antibody LIPS
levels to the SARS-CoV-2 antigens in COVID-19 patients and negative controls, for (a) 11 relevant
antigens (N, M, S, S1, S2’, NSP1, ORF3a, ORF3b, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF10) (b) three most
sensitive antigens (N, ORF3b, and ORF8), (c) selective antigens (ORF3b, and ORF8), and (d) 3 S
relevant antigens (S, S1, S2’). (e-f) Detection of early time-points patients only with the sum of (e)
11 relevant Antigens and (f) three most sensitive antigens (N+ORF3b+ORF8). Data represents the
mean +/- stdev, and individual responses (n=15). The cut-off value of the sums is shown by the
dotted line and was based on the mean + three stdev of the negative control group. Blue dots
represents COVID-19 patients data points prior to day 14. (h-i) Differences of the antibody
response means between COVID-19 and negative control populations as (h) scatter plot including
the 11 relevant antigens, and as (i) pie chart excluding N. Each symbol represents the mean +/stdev of the differences between COVID-19 and negative groups, for the 11 relevant antibody
levels in light units (LU). *** p<0.001, **** p<0.0001 versus all other antigens, otherwise indicated.
