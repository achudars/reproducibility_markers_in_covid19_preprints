Abstract:
Background: In December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 caused a global pandemic with a viral
infection called COVID-19. The disease usually causes respiratory symptoms but in a small
proportion of patients can lead to a pneumonitis, Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome and
death. Invasive Mechanical Ventilation (IMV) is considered a life-saving treatment for
COVID-19 patients and a huge demand for IMV devices was reported globally. This review
aims to provide insight on the initial IMV practices for COVID-19 patients in the initial
phase of the pandemic.
Methods: Electronic databases (Embase and MEDLINE) were searched for applicable
articles using relevant keywords. The references of included articles were hand searched.
Articles that reported the use of IMV in adult COVID-19 patients were included in the
review. The NIH quality assessment tool for cohort and cross-sectional studies was used to
appraise studies.
Results: 106 abstracts were identified from the databases search, of which 16 were included.
4 studies were included in the meta-analysis. In total, 9988 patients were included across all
studies. The overall cases of COVID-19 requiring IMV ranged from 2-75%. Increased age
and pre-existing comorbidities increased the likelihood of IMV requirement. The reported
mortality rate in patients receiving IMV ranged between 50-100%. On average, IMV was
required and initiated between 10-10.5 days from symptoms onset. When invasively
ventilated, COVID-19 patients required IMV for a median of 10-17 days across studies. Little
information was provided on ventilatory protocols or management strategies and were
inconclusive.
Conclusion: In these initial reporting studies for the first month of the pandemic, patients
receiving IMV were older and had more pre-existing co-morbidities than those who did not
require IMV. The mortality rate was high in COVID-19 patients who received IMV. Studies
are needed to evaluate protocols and modalities of IMV to improve outcomes and identify the
populations most likely to benefit from IMV.

Background:
In December 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause first emerged in
Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly in many regions of that country. Several laboratories
identified the causative agent as novel coronavirus (1-3), named as severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) with the disease termed coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) (4). Due to the highly contagious nature of the disease and the increasing
number of countries impacted, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health
Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020 (4).
SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the family of single-stranded RNA viruses which includes
Middle East Respiratory Syndrome virus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV, which were found
to be accountable for previous respiratory syndrome outbreaks (3, 5). Clinical presentation
and symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to MERS and SARS; however, the rate of spread is
far greater in COVID-19 (6). Furthermore, COVID-19 is the first pandemic disease caused by
the coronavirus family (6). As of 22nd of May 2020, the total number of confirmed cases of
COVID-19 was 5,263,710 with 337,852 deaths worldwide, and the number is expected to rise
(4).
While most people with COVID-19 develop mild or uncomplicated disease, some
develop severe illness requiring hospitalisation, with a smaller proportion experiencing
respiratory failure requiring Intensive Care Unit (ICU) support (1). In these severe cases,
COVID-19 has been causally associated with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)
requiring ventilatory support including invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), sepsis, and
multiorgan failure, making patient management extremely challenging.
ARDS is characterised by pulmonary infiltrates on imaging such as chest
radiographs, a reduction of lung compliance and hypoxemia that is associated with high
mortality rates (7). The use of IMV is a crucial intervention for patients developing ARDS
(8) but different strategies have been used to mechanically ventilate ARDS patients. To

provide an evidence base and unify practice, The ARDS Network (ARDSnet) (a research
network that includes the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes
of Health (NIH, USA)) was formed to conduct multicentre clinical trials for ARDS treatment
(9). The ARDSnet protocol has two approaches in managing ARDS patients requiring
mechanical ventilation including either low Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) and
high Fractional inhaled Oxygen (FiO2) or high PEEP and low FiO2 (8). Currently, there are
no guidelines to support ventilatory strategies which are specific to ARDS in COVID-19
patients and recommendations are based on general intensive care management (10) with comorbidity and age effecting mortality rate (11). However, there have been reports of different
possible phenotypes in COVID-19 related ARDS that may require IMV strategies that do not
follow traditional ARDS IMV protocols(12).
Due to the global outbreak, many health care systems were trying to meet the
substantial demand for mechanical ventilators causing a shortage of supplies around the
world. The criteria for selection for IMV and protocols used to deliver IMV appear to differ
between centres. This systematic review was conducted to describe the utilisation of IMV in
patients with COVID-19 at the early stages of this pandemic, specifically to determine if
there were patient-driven clinical features or/and IMV technical approaches associated with
better outcomes.
Methods:
This review was prepared in accordance to the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (13) and the review protocol
is registered in the international registry of systematic reviews (PROSPERO) (Registration
number CRD42020178262).
Search queries were carried out on the 23rd of April, 2020, using the search strategy
shown in (additional file 1) on the following electronic databases: Embase, MEDLINE.

Clinicaltrails.gov and EudraCT were searched for active trials or published data. Both
through scoping searches and discussion with experts, the following search terms were used
“COVID-19 OR SARS-COV-2 AND Mechanical ventilation”. The time frame for the search
was limited from December 2019 to 23rd of April 2020. Only English language articles were
included in the review, but no other limitation was used in the search queries. Search results
were imported into EndNote 9.1 (Clarivate Analytics) where duplicates were removed and
data was uploaded to Rayyan software(14), a webapp tool used for screening titles and
abstracts.
Eligibility Criteria:
Studies were considered for inclusion if they used IMV as part of the treatment of
COVID-19 patients. Only patients with confirmed COVID-19 (defined as positive results on
real-time reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasopharyngeal
swabs) were included in the review. Studies were considered for exclusion if they were
reviews, qualitative studies, and correspondence letters. Studies on individuals under 18 years
or who were not treated with IMV were also considered for exclusion.
Study selection and data extraction:
Abstracts were screened blindly and independently by MA and EA using the
predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Disagreements were resolved by discussion
otherwise by MAA. Full-text articles were acquired and imported into EndNote 9.1 by MA
and similar abstract screening methodology was used in screening full texts for eligibility.
Figure 1 shows studies selection criteria based on PRISMA guidelines.
Data was extracted by NYA and checked by EA for consistency and accuracy using a
custom piloted data extraction form developed by MMA and NYA. For each included study,
data was extracted on study design, patient characteristics, Intervention and outcomes.
Corresponding author were contacted if data were ambiguous or missing.

Quality Assessment:
Quality of included studies was assessed using NIH Quality assessment tool for
observational cohort and cross-sectional studies with the quality classified as good, fair and
poor. Two independent reviewers assessed quality of included studies (MA and EA).
Disagreement was resolved through discussion.
Data synthesis:
Studies were grouped based on disease severity and comorbidities if possible. A
narrative synthesis was carried out to assess the proportion of COVID-19 patients requiring
invasive mechanical ventilation, when IMV was initiated after symptom onset, and for how
long patients received IMV until either clinical improvement or death. Results from studies
that provided data on proportion of patients needing IMV were quantitatively synthesized via
effects size with random effect meta-analyses using Metaporp (15). Statistical heterogeneity
of the included articles was assessed by I2 value. Quantitative data was graphed on bar charts
and scatterplots to provide graphical representations of the studies.
Results:
Study selection:
Initial searches identified 106 abstracts, of which 7 were duplicates. After abstract
screening for eligibility criteria, 18 were included for full text screening. During full text
screening, 7 articles were identified that met inclusion criteria and through hand searching of
articles references, 9 further articles were identified, making a total of 16 articles to be
included in the review. Figure 1 shows the PRISMA flow diagram. Clinicaltrials.gov and
EudraCT was searched for data and active trials on mechanical ventilation use in COVID-19
patients. There were 902 trials found in clincaltrials.gov and 120 trials in EudraCT databases
Only one study that was registered on clinicaltrials.gov in the Netherlands to retrospectively
evaluate IMV modalities and its outcomes on COVID-19 patients (16).

Study Characteristics:
Characteristics of the 16 included studies are summarised in table 1. In total, 9988
confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in the selected studies. The sample size of the
included studies ranged from 17 to 5700 patients (median 146.5 patients (Interquartile Range
(IQR) 49.25 to 254.75)). Of the included studies, all were retrospective apart from one
prospective study (17) and most of the studies (12/16) were conducted in China. Of the
sixteen included studies, five included only severe cases (defined as patients admitted to ICU
or using a stated severity score)(18-22) and eleven included patients consecutively regardless

of severity levels (11, 17, 23-31). Although three studies reported the severity of COVID-19
patients, different definitions of severity were used. All studies reported co-morbidities, with
hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular diseases the most common, described in
table 1. All studies reported the percentage of COVID-19 patients required IMV. However,
the baseline characteristics of ventilated versus non-ventilated patients (describing their age,
or co-morbidities) were not reported in most of the studies. Furthermore, the criteria for ICU
admission was only reported in one study (17) while the criteria for placing patients on IMV
was not reported in any study. Definitions of ARDS were reported by nine studies; four used
the WHO definition (17, 22, 31, 32) and five used the Berlin definition of ARDS (11, 19, 21,
29). None of the included studies reported whether patients with advanced directives (such
as Do Not Resuscitate [DNR]) were included, except one(19).

Quality assessment:
As the studies were cohort studies and case-series, all included articles were assessed
using the pre-specified quality assessment tool, the NIH quality assessment tool for
cohort/cross-sectional studies. Domains 5, 9, 10, 12 and 13 of the NIH quality assessment
tool were not assessed as they relate to power calculation, exposure measure overtime,
blinding of outcome assessment, and loss to follow-up over time, and these were not
applicable to the included studies. The summary graph of the included studies can be found
in additional file 2. Only 3/16 studies were of a fair quality (18, 26, 27), otherwise all studies
13/16 were of good quality based on the quality assessment tool.
Result of individual studies:
Proportion of COVID-19 patients receiving IMV
The proportion of COVID-19 patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation are
reported based on their inclusion criteria, with studies that included only severely unwell
patients grouped together and studies that included patients consecutively regardless of
severity status reviewed in a separate grouping.
Severe or Critical cases:
Five studies assessed the characteristics and outcomes of severe or critically ill
patients with COVID-19 and reported the proportion of patients requiring IMV. Grasselli et
al. reported that 72.3% (1150/1591) of the patients admitted to ICU required IMV. These
authors also grouped the patients by age range with 73.8% (315/427) of patients aged 51-60
years requiring IMV; 75.1% (449/598) of patients aged 61-70 years and 72.1% (246/341) of
patients aged 71-80 years requiring IMV(20). Criteria used to assess the need for IMV were
not reported. Bhatraju et al. reported that IMV was initiated in 79.2% (19/24) of critically ill
COVID-19 patients with no description of the criteria used to assess the need for IMV(19).
Arentz et al. included only critically ill patients in their study (defined as requiring ICU

support) and here 71% (15/21) of COVID-19 patients received IMV(18). These authors also
stated that ARDS was observed in all patients requiring IMV but gave no further details of
the decision process for IMV use.
Yang et al. also included critically ill patients and reported that IMV was initiated in 42%
(22/52) of patients(33). When the patients were grouped into survivors and non-survivors,
15% (3/20) of the survivors required IMV, while 59% (19/32) of those who had died required
IMV but they did not explicitly relate this to disease severity. Wang et al. assessed the use of
High Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC) in severe COVID-19 patients and reported that 41.1%
(7/17) failed HFNC and were placed on NIV as rescue therapy(21). Of the seven patients on
NIV, two failed and required IMV. Therefore, in this small study, 11.7% of the patients
placed initially on HFNC (2/17) required IMV. Figure 2 shows the percentages of severe or
critical patients that required IMV and the weighted mean across all studies.

Consecutive sampling
The proportion of COVID-19 patients required IMV was also reported in eleven
studies where patients were sampled consecutively, and severity of the disease was not
specified at recruitment. Six of these studies aimed to assess the clinical characteristics of
patients with COVID-19. Liu et al. included 56 patients and reported the percentage of
patients required IMV in two groups, separated by age(26). In the elderly (defined as >60

years old), 22.2% (4/18) required IMV while in young to middle-aged patients (aged <60
years old), 7.9% (3/38) required IMV.

Mo et al. included 155 patients with different

severities of COVID-19 and reported that 20.6% (35/155) of the patients required IMV(27).
Furthermore, this study divided patients into two general groups at day 10 of hospitalization
(defined into “responders” which included those with symptoms resolution, improvements in
radiological abnormalities, hospital stay <10 days, and the maintenance of body temperature
with the use of antipyretics and “refractory” where these parameters had not been met). In
refractory COVID-19 patients, 41.2% (35/85) required IMV while in the responding patients,
IMV was not required.
A retrospective cohort study by Guan et al. also evaluated the clinical characteristics
of COVID-19 in 1099 patients, and they reported that 2.3% (25/1099) required IMV. (24)
When patients were grouped into severe and non-severe based on the ATS Community
Acquired Pneumonia guidelines, all those who required IMV were from the severe patients’
group. Among the severe patients, 14.5% (25/173) required IMV but the study did not report
their demographics separately. Huang et al. conducted a prospective cohort study to assess
the clinical feature of COVID-19 patients and reported that out of the 41 patients included, 13
required admission to the ICU (29). Of these, NIV was used in 61.5% (8/13), one (7.7%)
patient required oxygen provided by nasal cannula and IMV was initiated in 30.8% (4/13). Of
those receiving IMV, two had refractory hypoxemia and received Extracorporeal Membrane
Oxygenation (ECMO). Wang et al. included 138 COVID-19 patients in their retrospective
study and reported that 36 of the patients required ICU care (30). They also reported that
among these ICU patients, 47.2% (17/36) required IMV, 41.7% (15/36) required NIV and
11.1% (4/36) required oxygen inhalation. Chen et al. did not specify the severity of the
included COVID-19 patients but reported that 4.0% (4/99) required IMV(25). A large case

series by Richardson S. et al., which described the clinical features and outcomes of
hospitalised patients with COVID-19, reported that 20.2% (1151/5700) required IMV(28).
A retrospective study by Zhou et al. aimed to assess the clinical course and risk
factors for mortality of adult COVID-19 patients and reported that 17% (32/191) of the
patients required IMV(11). When patients were grouped into survivors and non-survivors,
57% (31/54) of the non-survivor patients required IMV. Wu C. et al. aimed to assess the risk
factors associated with ARDS and death in COVID-19 patients(31). The authors reported
that 84/201 patients developed ARDS and of those, 7.2% (6/84) required IMV and of those,
one patient (2.3%) received ECMO. The authors also reported that NIV and regular nasal
cannula were used in 72.6% (61/84) and 20.2% (17/84) of patients with ARDS, respectively
with ARDS defined using the WHO interim definitions(34).
Two retrospective studies assessing the association of cardiac injury with death in
patients with COVID-19 also reported the percentage of patients required IMV. Guo et al.
included 187 COVID-19 patients and grouped them into two groups by their serum levels of
troponin T (TnT) to determine their risk of cardiac injury (normal and elevated (defined by
above the 99th percentile upper reference limit))(25). In total, 25% (45/187) required IMV,
and in patients with elevated TnT, 60% (31/52) required IMV while in patients with normal
TnT, only 10% (14/135) required IMV. In a cohort study by Shi et al, 416 patients with
COVID-19 were grouped into those with cardiac injury and without cardiac injury (defined
as blood levels of cardiac biomarkers (hs-TN1) above the 99th percentile upper reference
limit)(29). 7.7% (32/416) of the total cohort required IMV. In patients with cardiac injury,
22% (18/82) required IMV but in those without cardiac injury, 4.2% (14/334) required IMV.
The percentage of COVID-19 patients required IMV of studies included patients
consecutively regardless of severity status are shown in figure 3.

and weighted mean.
Mortality rate in patients who received IMV
Five studies reported the mortality rate of patients receiving IMV rather than overall
mortality. Wu C. et al. reported a 100% mortality rate (n=6) for mechanically ventilated
patients with ARDS in all the IMV patients(31). Zhou et al. reported a high mortality rate of
97% for the 32 IMV patients, with only 1 patient who survived(11). Yang et al. reported a
mortality rate of 86% of 22 IMV patients(22). Richardson et al. reported a mortality rate of
88% of the (320/1151) ventilated patients with a reported outcome in the study(28). Bhatraju
et al. reported a mortality of 50% of 18 IMV patients, but 5 patients were still on IMV at end
of the study period and only 4/18 (22%) survived to discharge. Figure 4 illustrates mortality
rate and survival rate of patient on IMV(19). Overall disease severity and mortality were
associated with the presence of comorbidities, with hypertension, diabetes, and
cardiovascular diseases the most commonly reported.

Ventilator utilization:
Duration of IMV
Only 2 studies reported the duration of IMV for COVID-19 patients (see additional
file 3). Bhatraju et al. reported a median duration for IMV 10 days (IQR 7-12) (19). In a subanalysis, they found that surviving patients had a slightly higher duration of IMV than the
overall sample with a median of 11 days (IQR 7-12). Chen et al. reported a median duration
of 17 days (IQR 12-19) for IMV, but they had a smaller IMV population of 4 patients(23).
Initiation of IMV in the course of the illness
Only 2 studies reported when IMV was instigated compared to onset of symptoms.
Huang. C. et al. reported that in the 4 patients that required MV, the onset of MV was at a
median of 10.5 days (IQR 7.0-14.0) from the onset of symptoms(17). Zhou et al. reported a
similar median of MV onset of 10.0 days (IQR 5.0–12.5) in a larger population of 32
patients(11). See figure 5.

Ventilator setting
None of the included studies were designed to assess the effectiveness of IMV
modalities in COVID-19 patients, but 3 studies reported some IMV settings. Grasselli et al.
reported IMV settings for specific age groups(20). The overall median PEEP setting was
14cm H2O (IQR 12-16) and this was used for most age groups apart from the oldest (81 –
90years) where a median PEEP of 12cmH2O (IQR 8-15) was reported. Bhatraju et al.
reported FiO2, but did not discuss other ventilatory settings other than IMV readings of
plateau pressure, driving pressure, and compliance over the first three days of MV(19). On
the first day of IMV, the median FiO2 was set at 0.9 and readings included a median plateau
pressure of 25 cmH2O (IQR 20–28) and median compliance 29 mL/cmH2O (IQR 25–36). On
the second day, there was a titration of FiO2 (0.7) as lung mechanics were improving. More
improvement was reported on the third day of MV allowing more titrations of FiO2 to 0.6.
Chen et al. reported general settings used on the 4 ventilated patients as using P-SIMV with a
PEEP of 6-12 cmH2O and FiO2 between 35-100%(23).
Data synthesis:
The overall published studies included in this systematic review suggested that only a
small proportion of COVID-19 patients required IMV. But in severe cases the overall effect

Discussion:
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review that assesses the
utilization of IMV in COVID-19 patients. IMV practices are likely to change as our
experience of this condition increases (including not only who receives IMV but also the
protocols used). Objectively summarising the studies published within the first month of the
pandemic provides an important benchmark, by which to compare changing practices and
outcomes for patients.
The use of IMV is critical in treating ARDS and many studies and protocols have been
developed in order to manage it appropriately (8). Current guidelines and studies regarding
the use of IMV for COVID-19 patients suggest clinicians are managing patients with
COVID-19 related ARDS using similar ventilatory strategies to those adopted for other forms

of ARDS (35). While that may be an appropriate approach to manage ARDS, it may not be
the optimal management strategy in COVID-19. Unfortunately, no reported studies have
compared different ventilatory strategies in COVID-19. Only 1 trial is currently registered in
clinicaltrials.gov and none in EudraCT are studying the modalities of IMV in COVID-19
patients. The trial (PRoVENT-COVID) is a multicentre clinical trial that is designed to
compare different ventilatory management strategies to determine how ventilator settings
effect the duration of IMV support in COVID-19 (16).
In general, most of the included studies in this review (12/16) are from China, (3/16) the
United States (US) and one (1/16) was from Italy. Based on the quality assessment tool used
in this review, the methodological quality of included studies was good except for three
studies, which were of fair quality.
In studies which only included patients on critical care, the proportion of COVID-19
patients who received IMV ranged between 11-88%. One study suggested that non-invasive
respiratory support devices such as HFNC was associated with lower IMV usage(21), but the
study was small. In studies which included consecutive COVID-19 patients (with patients on
general wards and critical care units), the proportion of IMV use was between 2-20%, with a
weighted total of 16%. Mortality in those receiving IMV was high. However, the
characteristics of patients that received IMV were not reported in all studies and the protocols
for assessing when IMV use was required and ventilatory strategies or settings were not
discussed.
There were differences in the prevalence of IMV use across studies and between
countries. For example, IMV use was lower in China in severely unwell patients admitted to
ICU, especially in younger patients(11, 22) ranging from (14-41%)(17, 32, 36) compared to
studies in Italy and the US, where 71-75% of patients received IMV(18-20). The reasons for
this are unclear, but could reflect differences in the course of the illness (potentially patients

in Italy and USA may have experienced a more aggressive form of COVID-19), or patient
factors including the influence of age, ethnicity, co-morbidity and frailty) or differences in
care escalation decisions.
In COVID-19 patients on critical care units, an evidence-based protocol IMV would be
beneficial, especially while there are no available, specific treatments for the virus. It is still
unclear who would benefit most from IMV, and there is a need to characterise this,
considering demographics, co-morbidities and the onset of symptoms. Strategies to delay or
minimise IMV use should be considered and the use of HFNC has been found helpful in a
small sample of severe patients and warrants further study(21).

Other non-invasive

ventilatory support methods also appear to be helpful(37), but there are concerns of
nosocomial transmission of infection to health care workers(38). This also requires further
study. In ARDS patients, nursing patients in the prone position has been found helpful in
improving gas exchange and in lowering mortality (39). The use of prone position in
COVID-19 patients is being studied to determine whether this improves outcomes or reduces
the duration of IMV(40-42).
In these early studies of COVID-19 patients, IMV was associated with low survival rate
(0-22%). Nevertheless, overall mortality was linked to demographic factors such as male sex
and age as well as co-morbidities including hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular disease
(CVD). In keeping with this, studies assessing cardiac impairment in COVID-19 have
reported higher mortality and use of IMV(25, 29).
Only two studies reported the duration of IMV in COVID-19, with Bhatraju et al.
reporting IMV duration of 10 days (IQR 7-12)(19) and Chen et al. reporting a median
duration of IMV of 17 days (IQR 12-19)) (23). This variation may reflect the size of the
studies and the population included. Bhatraju et al. only included patients on critical care
while in Chen et al. included both patients on general care and critical care. Furthermore,

Chen et al. had only 4 patients required IMV while in Bhatraju et al. IMV was received by 18
patients. Data from two studies reporting the initiation of IMV in the course of the illness
showed that IMV was usually required approximately 10 days after the onset of symptoms.
This systematic review was limited by the small number of studies included, and they
were mostly conducted in China and thus may not represent the wider COVID-19 experience.
The evidence-base is continually expanding, but by summarising the initial experience of the
clinical community, this review serves two main purposes. First to highlight gaps in our
knowledge. The lack of detail about ventilatory protocols and patient demographics limits
our understanding on which patients may have better outcomes with IMV and how they
should be treated, and further clarification is required. Second, it provides a benchmark from
which subsequent reviews can compare changes in practice and their impact on outcome.
Conclusion:
Invasive mechanical ventilation is a life-saving treatment in COVID-19 patients, yet
the mortality rate remains very high. Modalities of IMV need to be studied in order to
develop appropriate protocols and manage patients effectively. The use of non-invasive
ventilatory support may reduce IMV usage, but further studies are needed to evaluate the risk
and benefit of using such modalities. Where IMV is a limited resource, patient factors such as
co-morbidities, may help identify those who are most likely to benefit from IMV, but further
studies are required.
