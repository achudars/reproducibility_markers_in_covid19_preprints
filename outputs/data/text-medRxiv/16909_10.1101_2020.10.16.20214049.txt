interventions. This number known as R0 is defined as the
mean number of secondary cases arising from a primary case
in the absence of immunity, and is estimated on the basis
of a particular epidemiological model. Mathematical models
for the population dynamics of COVID-19 incorporate different features such as asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic
transmission, super-spreading, or heterogeneity in susceptibility. A considerable range of R0 estimates has been reported,
ranging from at least 1.5(4) to 5.7(5) in Wuhan. A much
narrower range between 2 and 3 is frequently cited in the
popular press, or assumed when simulating models(6)or fitting
these to data(7, 8). This assumption may be based on the
dynamics of COVID-19 in regions that implemented interventions early(9–13). A more precise estimate of R0 from a
city where substantial transmission was occurring prior to
intervention, such as New York City, would provide a relevant
baseline. Furthermore, if "super-spreading" by a small fraction of symptomatic infections fuels COVID-19 transmission,
a precise estimate of the mean number of secondary cases
arising from such an individual, may be just as valuable. A
model that precisely estimates the fraction of symptomatic
cases may help epidemiologists discern if either the overall or
symptomatic reproductive numbers are higher than assumed.
The probability that a COVID-19 infection is symptomatic
is difficult to estimate(14) and a wide range of values have been

The contributions of asymptomatic infections to herd immunity and
community transmission are key to the resurgence and control of
COVID-19, but are difficult to estimate using current models that ignore changes in testing capacity. Using a model that incorporates
daily testing information fit to the case and serology data from New
York City, we show that the proportion of symptomatic cases is low,
ranging from 13% to 18%, and that the reproductive number may be
larger than often assumed. Asymptomatic infections contribute substantially to herd immunity, and to community transmission together
with pre-symptomatic ones. If asymptomatic infections transmit at
similar rates than symptomatic ones, the overall reproductive number across all classes is larger than often assumed, with estimates
ranging from 3.2 to 4.4. If they transmit poorly, then symptomatic
cases have a larger reproductive number ranging from 3.9 to 8.1.
Even in this regime, pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic cases together comprise at least 50% of the force of infection at the outbreak
peak. We find no regimes in which all infection sub-populations have
reproductive numbers lower than 3. These findings elucidate the uncertainty that current case and serology data cannot resolve, despite
consideration of different model structures. They also emphasize
how temporal data on testing can reduce and better define this uncertainty, as we move forward through longer surveillance and second
epidemic waves. Complementary information is required to determine the transmissibility of asymptomatic cases, which we discuss.
Regardless, current assumptions about the basic reproductive number of SARS-Cov-2 should be reconsidered.

As health officials face another wave of COVID-19, they require estimates of the proportion of infected cases that develop
symptoms, and the extent to which symptomatic and asymptomatic cases contribute to community transmission. Recent
asymptomatic testing guidelines are ambiguous. Using an epidemiological model that includes testing capacity, we show that
most infections are asymptomatic but contribute substantially
to community transmission in the aggregate. Their individual transmissibility remains uncertain. If they transmit as well
as symptomatic infections, the epidemic may spread at faster
rates than current models often assume. If they do not, then
each symptomatic case generates on average a higher number
of secondary infections than typically assumed. Regardless,
controlling transmission requires community-wide interventions
informed by extensive, well-documented asymptomatic testing.

S

ince the emergence of the novel coronavirus in December
2019(1), the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in over 16
million cases and 600,000 deaths worldwide(2). Schools and
universities in the United States are gradually re-opening amid
concerns that a second wave of the epidemic may re-emerge
in the fall and winter of 2020.
As they craft testing policies and intervention strategies to
mitigate a second wave, public health officials need to better
understand the role that symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals play in the community transmission of COVID-19
and in the development of herd immunity to the disease. However, fundamental epidemiological questions remain poorly
understood, including what fraction of cases are symptomatic
and how well asymptomatic cases can transmit relative to
symptomatic ones. These questions are especially urgent given
ambiguity in recent CDC guidelines regarding the testing of
asymptomatic individuals(3).
Answering these questions can also provide further insight
on the basic reproductive number of SARS-CoV-2, and how
the virus would spread in a population in the absence of

These challenges can be improved upon by explicitly incorporating changes in testing capacity into an epidemiological
process model. While some early models of the COVID-19
outbreak in Wuhan attempted to take into account changes
in testing capacity(21) or differences in reporting rate during
periods of the epidemic(9), the limited information on these
trends in Wuhan meant that they had to be estimated on
a coarse temporal scale (2-3 week intervals) and had to be
inferred along with other parameters in the model. In the
United States, many states and municipalities such as New
York City(22, 23) have published daily estimates of the number of total COVID-19 tests conducted, together with the
number of positive COVID-19 tests. While these data are
often used by public health officials to gauge the spread of
the COVID-19 outbreak, they have yet to be incorporated
explicitly into epidemiological models.

Results

104

We present a stochastic epidemiological model (Fig. 1) that explicitly incorporates daily changes in testing capacity and the
lag between sampling and testing (see Methods). The underlying model, referred to hereafter as the SEPIAR model (Fig.
1A) has a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered structure
with compartments for both severe (hospitalized) and nonsevere symptomatic infections as well as pre-symptomatic (P)
and asymptomatic (A) infections. We also consider two nested
simplified versions: one with no pre-symptomatic transmission
(the SEIAR model, Fig. 1B); and one with no asymptomatic
transmission (the SEPIR model, Fig. 1C). By varying specific
parameters weighting the transmission rate of P and A relative to that of symptomatic individuals, we can continuously
move across these two extreme structures. Daily reports of
the number of tests conducted in New York City are fed in
as a co-variate in the testing sub-model (see SI Appendix).
The model takes into account CDC priorities in sampling
and testing: all hospitalized cases are sampled and eventually
tested, while non-severe symptomatic individuals are sampled
and tested only if excess capacity is available at the time of
sampling. We also incorporate the re-testing of hospitalized
individuals as they leave the hospital. This model is fit to
observed cases in New York City from March 1,2020 to June 1,
2020 and serological estimates of herd immunity in New York
City from March 8,2020 to April 19,2020 (see Methods and SI
Appendix). We compare the full model with the two nested
simplified versions. Although all three model structures are
supported by the case data, the model with no asymptomatic
transmission is not supported when these data are considered
in conjunction with serology information (SI Appendix, Table
S2).
To evaluate the strength of transmission in asymptomatic
cases relative to symptomatic cases, we construct a Monte
Carlo profile using the full SEPIAR model (SI Appendix, Fig.
S6). We isolate parameter combinations from the profile that
are supported by the case and serology data, and examine
the values of those combinations. Particular parameters of
interest that we focus on include the proportion of cases that
are symptomatic, pS , the ratio of the transmission rate of
asymptomatic individuals to that of symptomatic individuals,
ba , and the reproductive numbers. We use R0 to denote the
symptomatic reproductive number (i.e. the mean number of
secondary cases arising from each primary symptomatic case),
and R0NGM to denote the overall reproductive number for the
model (i.e. the mean number of cases arising from a primary
infection, where the average considers all types of infections).
The proportion of COVID-19 cases that are symptomatic is
well identified, with a confidence interval ranging from 12.9%
to 17.4% (Figure 2). Although a wide range of parameter
combinations for the proportion of symptomatic infection are
supported by the case data on its own, a much narrower
estimate is obtained when the case and serology data are
considered together (Fig. 2A, B). Within this range, estimates
of herd immunity are consistent with the dynamics of observed
serology (Fig. 2C), in particular the rapid rise in seroprevalence
over March and April 2020.
The overall reproductive number or symptomatic reproductive number may be larger than is often assumed. From our
profile of the relative asymptomatic transmission rate ba , we
identify two main regimes of transmission that are supported

suggested (14–16). Estimates from cruise ship outbreaks(17),
Wuhan evacuees(18), long term care facilities(19), and contact tracing of index cases(15) may not be representative of
the general population. Increases in the testing capacity for
COVID-19 over time(9, 20, 21) make population-level estimation of this probability difficult due to confounding with
other parameters such as the reporting, hospitalization, and
fatality rates. When the testing capacity is limited in the
early stages of an outbreak, severe cases are more likely to
be tested, which can bias estimates of the probability that an
infection is symptomatic and the fatality rate. Changes in
testing capacity over time also confound the definition itself of
asymptomatic individuals in transmission models, when these
are not differentiated from unreported cases. These changes
can also bias the reported deaths attributed to COVID-19.

RA

47

We present an epidemiological model that incorporates RTPCR testing as an integral process informed by empirical levels.
The explicit consideration of testing allows us to clearly define
asymptomatic individuals as those that will never transition to
displaying symptoms, and to differentiate them from those who
have been unreported because they were not tested. We fit the
model to PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases in New York City,
using publicly available data provided by the New York State
Department of Public Health(23). The resulting model can
clearly delineate symptomatic and asymptomatic infections
independently from the reporting rate. We subsequently fit the
model to estimates of herd immunity obtained from a recent
serological study in New York City(24) to further constrain
inference results.

D

46

Our model obtains a precise estimate for the symptomatic
proportion of COVID-19 cases. We show that most COVID-19
infections are asymptomatic, and that these asymptomatic
infections together with pre-symptomatic ones substantially
drive community transmission, contributing 50% or more of
the total force of infection. Furthermore, depending on the
transmissibility of individual asymptomatic cases relative to
symptomatic ones, either the overall reproductive number or
the symptomatic reproductive number may be higher than
typically assumed. Our results highlight the importance of
testing and contact tracing of asymptomatic individuals, and of
making these data publicly available as health officials prepare
for and manage a second wave.

by both the case and serology data (Fig. 3), in which either
R0 orR0NGM is higher than the 2-3 range often assumed for
COVID-19. Notably, we find no parameter combinations in
which both reproductive numbers are below 3 and fall within
this range.
In the first regime, asymptomatic individuals transmit at
almost the same rate as symptomatic individuals. That is, ba
is large, even close to 1 in some parameter combinations. The
overall reproductive number takes on values between 3.2 and
4.4, and asymptomatic cases substantially contribute to the
overall force of infection (Fig. 4).
In the second regime, asymptomatic individuals transmit
at very low rates relative to symptomatic individuals, with
estimates of ba close to zero or in some parameter combinations even equal to zero. Concomitantly, the symptomatic
reproductive number is much higher than frequently assumed,
taking on values between 3.9 and 8.1. Nevertheless, even in
this regime pre-sympomatic and asymptomatic infections together contribute at least 50% of the overall force of infection
at the peak of the outbreak.
In both regimes, pre-symptomatic individuals transmit at
almost the same rate as symptomatic individuals, with estimates of bp close to 1, also making a substantial contribution
to the overall force of infection (Fig. 4).
We also observe a third regime in which both reproductive
numbers are higher than assumed, but in this regime presymptomatic individuals transmit at a very low rate, with bp
close to 0. Several combinations in this regime can be observed
in the top right corner of Fig. 3 (C,D) and in Fig. S8. This
is also the regime obtained in Fig. S7 if one uses the SEIAR
model, which assumes that pre-symptomatic individuals do
not transmit (i.e. bp is fixed at 0). Given previous evidence
of pre-symptomatic transmission of COVID-19(25, 26), we
focus on the two regimes which incorporate substantial presymptomatic transmission.
In line with previous studies(27), we estimate a large value
for the initial number of infected and incubating individuals
with COVID-19 in New York City at the start of the simulation
on March 1st. Parameter combinations that were supported
by the case and serology data ranged from 9,000-18,000 initial
infected individuals and 44,000-72,000 exposed individuals. A

formulation that considers both pre-symptomatic transmission (from compartment P ) and asymptomatic transmission (from compartment A). B) When the strength
of pre-symptomatic transmission bp is set to 0, the

exposed compartment. C) When the strength of asymptomatic transmission ba is set to 0, the SEPIAR model
reduces to the SEPIR model. Individuals in the asymptomatic infectious compartment (A) make no contribution
to the force of infection, so asymptomatic individuals essentially recover after leaving the pre-symptomatic period

contribute to the force of infection, while rectangular compartments do not. The green ellipse denotes the point

If asymptomatic individuals transmit at a high rate, then
the overall reproductive number pre-intervention in New York
City is larger than the 2-3 range often assumed in models(6–8)
and media reports (11, 37–39) based on early estimates from
Wuhan (4, 40, 41). Furthermore, we find no supported parameter combinations in which both the overall and symptomatic
reproductive numbers fall within this range. Early Wuhan
models may under-estimate R0 by ignoring pre-symptomatic
transmission and making restrictive assumptions, including
that COVID-19 has the same incubation period and serial
interval as SARS-CoV (4, 40, 41), or that most cases are
symptomatic(42). Early Wuhan case data may be insufficient
to precisely estimate R0 without making these assumptions
(43–45). Thus, models and intervention strategies should consider that the overall R0 may be higher than 3 in certain
locations (5, 46).
If asymptomatic individuals are unlikely to transmit and
do so with low probability, then the small fraction of cases
that are symptomatic are transmitting at a high rate, in
line with recently reported “super-spreading” events(47, 48).
Super-spreading events are instances in which a single infected
individual infects a large number of people. These events
can be hard to measure on a population level in the absence
of detailed transmission data. In classic super-spreading dynamics, most primary cases do not result in many secondary
cases, while a subset of primary cases result in a large number of secondary cases(8, 49, 50). This heterogeneity in the
reproductive number is indeed what we observe when asymptomatic individuals transmit poorly. Our model is admittedly
a coarse description of this heterogeneity, since it incorporates only two different classes of infections, symptomatic or
asymptomatic. Future models can build upon this framework
with additional classes for age, socio-economic status, location
or susceptibility(51) using fine-scale case data. However, our
results also indicate that even when the symptomatic reproductive number is large, pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic
infections contribute together to at least 50% of the overall
force of infection.

With a transmission model that incorporates daily changes
in testing capacity, we estimate that the probability that an
exposed individual develops symptoms is low. Since asymptomatic infections represent a large fraction of the infected
population, they contribute substantially to community transmission in the aggregate together with pre-symptomatic cases,
even when they individually transmit at a low per-capita rate.
They also contribute substantially to building herd immunity.
We use testing information to estimate the probability
that a new case will become symptomatic without the biases present in cruise-ship(17) and traveler studies(18), or the
parameter confounding present in city-wide models. Early
cruise-ship and evacuee studies found that most COVID-19
cases were symptomatic. However, given the small number of
total infections(18, 28) , evacuee studies may over-estimate
the fraction of symptomatic cases if infections in observed
severe cases(29) last longer(30) than in asymptomatic ones.
Cruise-ship studies may likewise over-estimate this parameter
if asymptomatic cases, which were tested later than symptomatic cases(17), recover prior to testing. City-wide models,
which avoid these biases, indicate that most COVID-19 cases
are undetected (9). They confound however the fraction of
symptomatic cases with the reporting or hospitalization rate,
as they neglect daily testing changes, and cannot distinguish
between asymptomatic and undetected cases. The alternative
approach of fitting the models to death data is not necessarily
exempt from biases in parameter estimates, due to changes
in hospital capacity over time(31, 32), co-morbidities in host
populations(33, 34), and the long delay between the onset of
infection and death(35). Furthermore, the under-reporting of
cases can also bias the assumed case fatality rate(32). Our
approach resolves these issues by incorporating daily testing
capacity as part of the model when estimating parameters from
serology and case data. Models without explicit consideration
of this capacity have difficulty estimating the proportion of
cases that are symptomatic from these data (36), suggesting
that including testing is crucial.

this magnitude of undetected infections is whether it is consistent with no signal of an anomalous number of hospitalizations.
In other words, would this large rise in early infections result
in a corresponding rise in COVID-hospitalizations that may
not have been detected as COVID-related? We examine this
question by comparing simulated daily hospitalizations from
our fitted model with observed COVID-19 daily hospitalizations in New York City, as well as with syndrome surveillance
reports of respiratory illness from emergency departments in
New York City hospitals (SI Appendix, Fig. S5), which we
can use as an indicator for a rise in undetected hospitalizations. We show that a scenario with a large number of initial
infections on March 1st is indeed consistent with the time at
which observed COVID-19 hospitalizations peak, providing
further support for this contention. We also find that the
imposition of social distancing on March 17th and the stay at
home order on March 22nd in New York City resulted in a
substantial decrease in the initial transmission rate. Parameter
estimates for the ratio of the post-intervention transmission
rate to the pre-intervention transmission rate (bq ) ranged from
0.134 to 0.240, corresponding to a 75.98%-86.62% reduction
in the strength of transmission after the intervention.

Subramanian et al.

It follows that community-wide interventions that account
for non-symptomatic cases should be crucial for mitigating
outbreaks. If asymptomatic cases transmit poorly, then concurrent additional interventions targeting super-spreading symptomatic infections may help reduce community transmission.
Resolving the non-identifiability of the efficacy of asymptomatic transmission (ba ), would require extensive community
testing and contact tracing of asymptomatic cases. Community testing on its own can provide an estimate of the total
proportion of cases that are asymptomatic, but it may not
provide insight on whether those asymptomatic individuals
can transmit and how well they can transmit. Symptomatic
and asymptomatic individuals have similar viral loads(52), but
a high viral load does not necessarily imply high transmissibility. One limitation of early contact tracing studies is that
estimates of transmissibility may over-sample symptomatic
index cases and contacts, particularly during the early phase
of an epidemic(15, 53). In certain studies, only symptomatic
contacts are further investigated. Ideally, one would use frequent systematic community testing for studies identifying
both symptomatic and asymptomatic potential index cases
for further contact tracing and testing of all contacts regardless of symptoms. Furthermore, fixing the probability that an

While it cannot capture all testing intricacies, our framework illustrates how transmission models can incorporate daily
changes in testing capacity and identify parameters that were
previously difficult to estimate such as the probability that an
infection will become symptomatic. While we do not explicitly denote differences between labs, hospitals, or diagnostic
tests, we account for this variation by including additional
measurement noise after simulating the RT-PCR testing process. We also consider how sampling individuals without
COVID-19 may deplete the daily testing capacity. In particular, hospitalized individuals with non-COVID-19 related severe
respiratory disease may have a higher priority for testing than
non-severe COVID-19 cases. Our model uses syndrome surveillance reports(54–57) of respiratory illness from New York City
hospitals in previous years, along with weekly influenza cases,
to estimate the number of non-COVID-19 severe respiratory
cases that were tested. This framework could be used in conjunction with other epidemiological models, and extended to
other municipalities or countries with location-specific testing
priorities, re-testing procedures, or diagnostic tests. It could
also be used to examine how altering testing strategies such as
switching from symptom-based testing to community testing
may improve transmission parameter inference and efficacy of
control efforts. This may be an important consideration for
countries that have limited testing capacity but are still in the
midst of the first pandemic wave, such as India.

Our finding that many individuals were already infected by
March 1st is consistent with earlier estimates that community
transmission began in February in NYC(27, 55, 58). Previous
studies could not explain however why no substantial increase
in COVID-19-like illness was observed prior to February 28th
in syndrome surveillance data(55). Our simulations show that
the lag between infection onset and hospitalization can explain
this discrepancy. Even when initialized with many infected
cases on March 1st , simulated hospitalizations do not rise
until several weeks later concurrent with observed COVID19 hospitalizations (SI Appendix Fig. S5). Most likely, the
estimated initial conditions suggest multiple parallel foci of
initiation of the epidemic with multiple importations of infections. Another suggested possibility is a dosage-dependence
effect, wherein the severity of an individual’s infection depends
on the size of the virus population that the person becomes
infected with during one or more transmission events, and
hence on the overall viral load of COVID-19 in the community.
In this scenario, early COVID-19 cases in February and early
March would be less severe. This would be consistent with the
syndrome surveillance data, where we see a rise in early March
of respiratory infection reports in the emergency departments
of hospitals, but do not yet see a rise in COVID-19 hospitalizations. This phenomenon might also explain why our model
slightly under-estimates the peak in daily hospitalizations,
even though it correctly identifies the time and shape of that
peak.
In conclusion, explicit consideration of changes in testing capacity allows us to infer with certainty from case and serology
data that most new COVID-19 cases do not become symptomatic. We also inferred that the overall or symptomatic
reproductive number may be larger than often assumed depending on how well asymptomatic cases can transmit. Despite
this uncertainty, the strong consistent contribution to community transmission from cases without symptoms observed
across scenarios supported by the data, should be considered
when formulating public health intervention strategies. Making available detailed information on testing policy and data
on testing capacity over time will strengthen the ability of
epidemiological models to learn from the past and inform us
about the future.

infection becomes symptomatic based on the results of serologyinformed models such as ours, could increase the precision
with which contact tracing studies can estimate the strength
of asymptomatic transmission. Colleges that are currently reopening may be ideal test locations for this kind of combined
approach, which may also help detect super-spreading events.

Future studies can investigate the impact of including a
testing sub-model on parameter estimation and the level of
detail required in such a sub-model. For example, one could
compare the results of parameter estimation from fitting a
given epidemiological model with a queue-based testing model
to those that assume a fixed reporting rate and a delay in the
reporting of cases. We expect the former to exhibit more uncertainty when informed by surveillance data from the beginning
of the pandemic when little testing capacity is available, but
to reduce this uncertainty as the time series is extended and
this capacity changes. Models that assume a fixed reporting
rate may under-estimate the range in uncertainty of epidemiological parameters that are heavily informed by the early part
of the time series, and may even under-estimate the values of
the parameters themselves. Models with a queue-based testing
sub-model may obtain more precise estimates of parameters
that impact the end of the outbreak, such as those related
to the depletion of susceptible individuals, acquisition of immunity, or in our model, the impact of social distancing and
stay-at-home orders on overall transmission. Even if including
some form of testing model that takes into account changes in
capacity is key to obtaining more precise parameter estimates,
simpler versions of our implementation may be sufficient. For
example, the more generalizable components such as the testing of hospitalized individuals may be more important than
taking into account their re-sampling as they leave the hospital. Simplifying the testing model based on model selection
analyses can facilitate wider adaption of the testing framework
to other cities, countries, or time periods.

We examine three different model structures that have been used
to characterize COVID-19 dynamics in previous studies (Fig 1). All
models are modified versions of the traditional susceptible-exposedinfected-recovered (SEIR) model (59). The first model, the SEPIR
model(17, 60), is the most standard extension in which transitions
are between a linear chain of compartments. Its formulation adds
a compartment P for pre-symptomatic transmission. The second
one, the SEIAR model (7, 9), differs conceptually in that it includes
asymptomatic individuals rather than pre-symptomatic ones, and
defines them as distinct, in the sense that they will never transition
to exhibiting symptoms. This definition implicitly recognizes that
there are essentially two classes of individuals in terms of susceptibility to disease and symptoms. The third structure for the SEPIAR
model(6, 26) is a combination of the first two and includes them as
nested, particular, cases.
All three models include a chain of m exposed classes to incorporate the total time between the onset of infection and the onset of
symptoms as gamma distributed (with mean 5.5. days and standard
deviation 2.25 days) (61). Symptomatic individuals are subdivided
into two sequential classes IS1 and IS2 for practical purposes, to
follow their numbers before and after some of them transition to
hospitalization. Individuals spend an average of φ1 days in IS1 and

The parameter R0 represents the reproductive number experienced by symptomatic individuals. We define a baseline preintervention transmission rate in symptomatic individuals β0 by
dividing R0 by the average total time that non-severe cases transmit
with symptoms. We also define a post-intervention transmission
rate β1 , which is equal to the pre-intervention transmission rate
β0 multiplied by a scaling factor bq . Low values of bq represent a
substantial reduction in the transmission rate due to interventions.
Social distancing guidelines were issued by New York City starting
on March 17(62, 63), and a stay-at home order was issued which
took effect on the evening of March 22(64). Thus,prior to the imposition of social distancing, the transmission rate of symptomatic
individuals in our models, β(t), is equal to β0 . From March 18th
thru March 22nd, β(t) decreases linearly from β0 to β1 . From March
23rd onwards, β(t) is equal to β1 .
In all models, a fraction pS of exposed individuals Em becomes
symptomatic. After an average of 5 days of transmission, symptomatic cases are hospitalized with probability pH . Symptomatic
cases that are not severe enough to require hospitalization recover
1
at rate γ. Hospitalized individuals recover at rate hv = 13
(30) and
do not transmit while hospitalized. We assume a fixed population
size for New York City of 8 million individuals (65).
Assumptions about which infected classes are infectious and how
they contribute to the transmission rate allow us to reduce the
SEPIAR model to the SEPIR or SEIAR models. Pre-symptomatic
individuals transmit for an average of about a day (0.92 days(25))
at a transmission rate equal to the baseline transmission rate β(t)
multiplied by a scaling factor b=bp . Asymptomatic infections
transmit for an average of 5 days, equal to the average duration
between the onset of symptoms and hospitalization in severe cases,
at a transmission rate equal to the baseline rate β(t) multiplied by
scaling factor ba .
The models are implemented numerically via an Euler approximation of the deterministic equations to which demographic stochasticity is added. Specifically, the number of individuals making state
transitions from compartments with more than one exit is drawn
from an Euler-multinomial distribution(66). The number of individuals making state transitions from compartments with only one
exit is drawn from a binomial distribution.
Description of Testing Model: The model takes into account
daily changes in the testing capacity using estimates of daily tests
conducted in New York City from the New York State Department
of Health(23), as well as the re-testing of severe and non-severe
symptomatic cases prior to leaving the hospital or quarantine. We
assume that there are two categories of cases-severe (hospitalized)
cases and non-severe cases subject to different testing priorities(67):
the initial testing of new hospitalized COVID-19 cases (highest
priority), the re-testing of those individuals when they leave the
hospital, the testing of new non-severe symptomatic COVID-19
cases, and finally the re-testing of those symptomatic cases (lowest
priority). All severe COVID-19 cases after March 1st are sampled
when they enter the hospital and eventually tested once enough
capacity is available. We assume that symptomatic non-severe cases
are sampled at the same time in the course of their infection as
severe cases. However, we assume that they are not tested if they
recover before enough testing capacity is available. During the early
stages of the epidemic, the CDC recommended test-based strategies
to determine when to conclude home isolation or hospitalization(68).
Accordingly, we assume that hospitalized cases are re-tested twice
(over a 24 hour period) after the average length of time in the
hospital (13 days), while non-severe cases are likewise re-tested
twice after the end of a 14-day quarantine period.
We also take into account the potential for non-COVID-19 severe
respiratory cases to be sampled in hospitals and tested (with the
same priority as hospitalized COVID-19 cases). We use confirmed
influenza cases(69) and syndrome surveillance reports of respiratory
disease from emergency departments in New York City hospitals in
previous years(70) to estimate the number of non-COVID-19 severe
respiratory cases that may have been sampled (see SI Appendix).
We assume that the RT-PCR testing has a sensitivity of 90%(71),
that testing takes 48 hours(72), and that there is an additional
negative-binomial distributed dispersion after the RT-PCR testing
with standard deviation σM . This dispersion takes into account

variation in sampling and testing protocols across laboratories and
hospitals, as well as variation in the sensitivity and time required
for different PCR assays.
Overview of the model fitting and inference strategy.
Unless otherwise mentioned, we fit the following parameters: the
recovery rate for non-severe symptomatic infections (γ), the scaling
factors for asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, and post-intervention
transmission (ba , bp , and bq ), the symptomatic probability (pS )
and the hospitalization probability (pH ), the reproductive number
for symptomatic cases (R0 ), the dispersion parameter for RT-PCR
testing (σM ), and the initial number of infected (I0 ) and exposed
(E0 ) individuals at the start of the simulation on March 1, 2020. We
use the iterated filtering algorithm MIF(73) within the R-package
POMP (for partially observed Markov process models) to fit parameter combinations by likelihood maximization. We apply the Sequential Monte Carlo algorithm pfilter(74) to evaluate the likelihood
of the final parameter combinations. In particular, for the analysis
of the full SEPIAR model, we generate a Monte Carlo profile(75)
for the relative strength of asymptomatic transmission (ba ). For all
resulting parameter combinations within 2 log–likelihood units of
the MLE, we then calculate the likelihood with respect to serology
using seroprevalence data from (24). We assume that each serology
measurement is drawn from a binomial distribution with sample
size N and proportion p equal to the observed seroprevalence. We
isolate all combinations supported by the serology data that have
log-likelihoods within 2 units of the MLE.
For each combination, we examine the proportion of cases that
are symptomatic pS , the reproductive number in symptomatic
individuals R0 , and the overall reproductive number for the model
R0NGM . We derive the following expression for R0NGM using the
Next Generation Matrix(76) :
