ABSTRACT
Background: Little is known regarding long-term outcomes of patients hospitalized with
COVID-19.
Methods: We conducted a prospective study of 6-month outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19
patients. Patients with new neurological complications during hospitalization who survived were
propensity score-matched to COVID-19 survivors without neurological complications
hospitalized during the same period. The primary 6-month outcome was multivariable ordinal
analysis of the modified Rankin Scale(mRS) comparing patients with or without neurological
complications. Secondary outcomes included: activities of daily living (ADLs;Barthel Index),
telephone Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Neuro-QoL batteries for anxiety, depression,
fatigue and sleep.
Results: Of 606 COVID-19 patients with neurological complications, 395 survived
hospitalization and were matched to 395 controls; N=196 neurological patients and N=186
controls completed follow-up. Overall, 346/382 (91%) patients had at least one abnormal
outcome: 56% had limited ADLs, 50% impaired cognition, 47% could not return to work and
62% scored worse than average on ≥1 Neuro-QoL scale (worse anxiety 46%, sleep 38%, fatigue
36%, and depression 25%). In multivariable analysis, patients with neurological complications
had worse 6-month mRS (median 4 vs. 3 among controls, adjusted OR 2.03, 95%CI 1.22-3.40,
P=0.01), worse ADLs (aOR 0.38, 95%CI 0.29-0.74, P=0.01) and were less likely to return to
work than controls (41% versus 64%, P=0.04). Cognitive and Neuro-QOL metrics were similar
between groups.
Conclusions: Abnormalities in functional outcomes, ADLs, anxiety, depression and sleep
occurred in over 90% of patients 6-months after hospitalization for COVID-19. In multivariable

analysis, patients with neurological complications during index hospitalization had significantly
worse 6-month functional outcomes than those without.

INTRODUCTION:
Acute neurological complications of hospitalized COVID-19 patients have been
described in several cohorts worldwide1-9, however, limited data exists regarding long-term
cognitive and functional outcomes. Reports of prolonged memory disorders, fatigue, and
persistent respiratory symptoms have been grouped together in the rubric of “long COVID” or
“long-hauler” syndrome, yet little is known regarding the prevalence, risk factors or
pathophysiology behind this group of symptoms.
Recently, we reported on a prospective cohort of 4,491 COVID-19 patients hospitalized
during the spring 2020 surge in New York City and identified 606 (14%) with new neurological
disorders during hospitalization10. In this study, we followed this initial cohort longitudinally
for 6-months to evaluate longer-term outcomes. Our primary aim was to compare global
functional outcomes between COVID-19 hospital survivors with and without neurological
complications using an ordinal analysis of the modified Rankins Scale (mRS). Secondary
outcomes included assessments of activities of daily living, return to work, cognitive function,
anxiety, depression, fatigue and sleep abnormalities. We hypothesized that long-term functional
outcomes would be worse among patients with neurological complications compared to age,
gender and severity of illness-matched COVID-19 controls without neurological complications.

We conducted a prospective, observational study of consecutive COVID-19 patients
hospitalized at four New York City area hospitals within the same hospital system between
March 10, 2020 and May 20, 2020. Inclusion criteria were: age ≥18 years, hospital admission,
reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) positive SARS-CoV-2 infection from
nasopharyngeal sampling, survival to discharge and consent to participate in a follow-up
interview. Exclusion criteria were: negative or missing SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test, or
evaluation in an outpatient or emergency department setting only. Only index admissions were
included; readmissions were excluded to avoid double counting. Patients were prospectively
screened following hospital admission according to previously published criteria10. Briefly,
initial screening for inclusion was performed by the emergency department or admitting team,
wherein a neurology consult would be triggered according to routine protocol for patients with
new or worsened neurological disorders. Next, all inpatients evaluated by an in-hospital
neurologist were screened twice daily for study inclusion and data abstraction was performed by
neurology attendings, residents and fellows. COVID-19 patients who were prospectively
excluded due to “no new neurological disorder” after evaluation by a neurologist were eligible
for inclusion in the control group.
Neurological Diagnoses and Severity of Illness ScalesNeurological diagnoses --including toxic-metabolic encephalopathy, hypoxic-ischemic
encephalopathy, stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic), seizure, neuropathy, myopathy, movement
disorder, encephalitis/meningitis, myelopathy, myelitis—followed established criteria 11-20 and
were coded for COVID-19 patients found to have a new neurological complication (excluding
recrudescence or worsening of old neurological deficits) as diagnosed by in-hospital neurology
teams. A second review of neurological diagnoses was performed by relevant subspecialty co-

authors (e.g. stroke, neurocritical care, epilepsy sub-specialists). Patients could be coded for
more than one neurological complication. A control group consisted of a matched cohort of
COVID-19 patients without new neurological complications admitted during the same time
frame (March 10, 2020 and May 20, 2020) and to the same hospitals. Controls were propensity
score matched 1:1 to cases by age, gender and intubation status (as a marker of illness severity
during index hospitalization) using a matching ratio of 0.01, random order drawing of matches,
without replacement and with priority given to exact matches.
Demographic data, past medical history, clinical course and hospital outcomes (mortality
rates discharge disposition, ventilator days and hospital length of stay) were collected in both
groups. Severity of illness during hospitalization was assessed using both the maximum
recorded Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, and the lung severity scale21 for
hospitalized patients (0=no oxygen requirement, 1=supplemental oxygen required, 2=high-flow
nasal cannula or non-invasive ventilation, 3=invasive mechanical ventilation). Past medical
history data was gathered through review of the medical record. A past history of dementia was
coded for patients with pre-existing diagnoses of mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer’s type
dementia, vascular dementia, Lewy body/Parkinson’s related dementia, progressive supranuclear
palsy, multiple system atrophy, corticobasal degeneration, frontal-temporal dementia, normal
pressure hydrocephalus or Creutzfeld-Jakob disease. Pre-morbid baseline mRS were collected
based on patient/surrogate report.
Study OutcomesLongitudinal 6-month follow-up assessments were conducted by telephone interview
among case and control hospital survivors or their surrogates who consented to participate.
Contact was attempted at 6-months (

1 month

from the onset of neurological symptoms

among cases, or from the onset of COVID-19 symptoms among controls. Based on prior data,
the median time from general COVID-19 symptom onset to neurological complication was 2
days10. Three attempts at contact were required before patients/surrogates were coded as
“unreachable”.
We selected outcome measures that could be assessed via telephone interview, were
validated for completion by surrogates, and could be completed in approximately 30 minutes to
avoid participant fatigue. The primary outcome was the modified Rankin Scale [mRS; 0=no
symptoms, 6=dead]22, analyzed using an ordinal proportional odds model. Secondary outcomes
included: the Barthel Index23 for activities of daily living (0=completely dependent,
100=independent for all activities), the Telephone Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA;
22=perfect score; ≤18=abnormal cognition)24, and Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders25
(Neuro-QoL) short form self-reported health measures of anxiety, depression, fatigue and sleep.
Patients with fewer than 13 years of education received an additional point when scoring the
telephone MOCA26. The outcomes of occurrence of return to work among those employed premorbidly and hospital readmission were self-reported by the patient or their surrogate. All of the
above batteries have been validated for surrogate completion with the exception of the telephone
MoCA, which was only scored if the patient was able to complete the assessment. Incomplete or
partial responses to a given metric were excluded from analysis.
Standard Protocol Approvals and Patient ConsentsThis study was approved by the NYU Grossman School of Medicine Institutional Review
Board. All patients or their surrogates provided consent for participation.

Demographic variables, past medical history, clinical course and in-hospital outcomes
were compared between COVID-19 patients with and without a new neurological event using
the Mann-Whitney U test for non-normally distributed continuous variables and Chi-square test
for categorical values, as appropriate. Neuro-QoL raw scores were converted into T-scores with
a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10 in a reference population (U.S. general population or
clinical sample)27. Higher T-scores indicate worse self-reported health for the anxiety,
depression, fatigue and sleep metrics. Secondary outcomes were dichotomized based on
clinically relevant or published thresholds. For patients who died, a mRS score of 6 was
assigned, but no other outcome variables were scored.
Ordinal logistic regression models predicting 6-month mRS were constructed to
determine the effect of neurological complications during COVID-19 hospitalization. Secondary
outcomes were compared between those with or without neurological disorders using MannWhitney U (Wilcoxon rank-sum) or Chi-squared tests as appropriate. Variables (demographics,
past medical history, clinical course) predictive of mRS scores with a P value ≤0.100 were
entered into multivariable ordinal logistic regression analysis to estimate the adjusted odds ratios
(aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the primary outcome of mRS score. Clinically
relevant interactions were tested. Additionally, multivariable, backward step-wise, binary
logistic regression models were constructed predicting dichotomized secondary outcomes of
Barthel Index (fully independent versus any abnormal ADLs), MoCA (abnormal score≤18 versus
>1824), Neuro-QoL T-scores worse than average (>50) and return to work, including univariate
predictors with a P-value ≤0.100. Correlations between different outcome measures were
assessed using Spearman correlation coefficients. All analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS
Statistics for Mac version 26 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY).

RESULTS:
Of 606 hospitalized COVID-19 patients prospectively identified with new neurological
complications, 395 (65%) survived to hospital discharge10. Among the 3,885 COVID-19 control
patients without neurological complications hospitalized during the same time frame, 3,134
(81%) survived and 395 were propensity-score matched by age, gender and ventilator status to
the surviving neurological patients (Supplemental Table 1). Seven-hundred-ninety follow-up
calls were attempted at 6-months, and 382 (N=196 neurological cases and N=186 controls) were
completed (Figure 1). The median time from first COVID-19 symptom (e.g. fever, cough,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) to neurologic complication onset was 2 days (interquartile range
[IQR] 0-13). The median time from neurological symptom onset (or COVID-19 symptom onset
for controls) to follow-up interview was 6.7 (IQR 6.5-6.8) months. Between discharge and 6months, 40/196 (20%) neurological patients and 35/186 (19%) controls died (P=0.715) in a
median of 0.8 (IQR 0.4-2.1) months from symptom onset. Among those able to participate in
outcome assessments, direct responses were obtained from 121/156 (78%) neurological patients
and 131/151 (87%) controls, while surrogate responses were utilized in 35/156 (22%)
neurological patients and 20/151 (13%) controls (P=0.026).
Among the neurological cohort, the most common diagnoses were toxic-metabolic
encephalopathy (52%), hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (21%), stroke (11%), and seizure
(11%, Table 1). Compared to control patients, neurological patients had lower body mass
indices, more past history of dementia, stroke and seizure, worse SOFA scores during
hospitalization and higher rates of acute renal failure (all P<0.05, Table 1). Patients with newly

diagnosed neurological events were more often discharged to a nursing home and less often
discharged home than control patients.
In the entire cohort, 346/382 (91%) patients had at least one abnormal outcome at 6months: 170/304 (56%) had limited activities of daily living (Barthel<100), 106/215 (50%) had
impaired cognition (telephone MOCA<18), the median mRS was 3 (IQR 1-5), 47% (81/154) of
those working pre-morbidly were unable to return to work at 6-months. Of those able to
complete the Neuro-QoL batteries, 174/280 (62%) demonstrated worse than average scores
compared to reference populations (T-score >50) on at least one metric: 128/280 (46%) scored
worse than average on anxiety; 105/278 (38%) on sleep; 98/272 (36%) on fatigue, and 71/279
(25%) on depression.
Six-month mRS scores were significantly worse in patients with neurological
complications (median 4, IQR 2-5) compared to controls (median 3, IQR 1-4, unadjusted ordinal
logistic regression analysis OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.10-2.24, Wald X2(1)=6.096, P=0.014; Figure 2).
Patients with neurological complications were more likely to have impaired activities of daily
living (53% versus 35% of controls, Chi-squared test P=0.002) and were less likely to return to
work (41% versus 64% of controls, Chi-squared test P=0.004; Table 2). Though neurological
patients scored worse on the telephone MoCA (median 17 versus 18, Wilcoxon rank-sum test
P=0.036), after excluding patients with baseline dementia, there was no difference between
groups. Neuro-QoL T-scores for anxiety, depression, fatigue and sleep were also similar
between both groups. Hospital readmission occurred in 14% of patients in both groups (Table
2). Overall, persistent dyspnea severe enough to limit normal activity occurred in 35% of
patients and did not differ between groups.

While most of the outcome metrics (mRS, Barthel, anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep,
hospital readmission, return to work and persistent dyspnea), with the exception of the telephone
MOCA, were significantly correlated with one another, correlation coefficients were generally
modest, ranging from Rho=0.155 for readmission and fatigue T-scores, to Rho=0.497 for fatigue
and sleep T-scores. However, Barthel and mRS scores were strongly correlated (Rho= -0.788,
P<0.001, Supplemental Table 3).
Predictors of 6-month outcomes, including demographics, past medical history, hospital
course, specific neurological diagnoses, and COVID-19 specific medications were evaluated in
logistic regression analysis (Supplemental Table 2). Results of multivariable ordinal logistic
regression analysis for the primary mRS outcome are shown in Table 3 (with all univariate
variables in supplemental table 2 with P≤0.100 tested in the model). The occurrence of new
neurological complications during COVID-19 hospitalization remained a significant independent
predictor of worse 6-month mRS scores (adjusted OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.22-3.40, P=0.01). Other
significant predictors were older age, worse baseline functional status (as measured by baseline
mRS), and longer hospital length of stay (Table 3). Similarly, neurological complications
during hospitalization remained an independent predictor of limited activities of daily living
(aOR 0.38, 95% CI 0.20-0.74) and was inversely associated with return to work (aOR 0.31, 95%
CI 0.10-0.95; Table 4). Older age, and worse baseline functional status were consistent
independent predictors of worse outcome across a spectrum of other outcome measures. Acute
respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation was associated with limited ADLs
and worse than average sleep, while the interaction of hypotension requiring vasopressors and
intubation was associated with worse than average fatigue at 6-months, suggesting a synergistic
effect of both hypotension and hypoxia (Table 4).

DISCUSSION:
In this prospective study, we found that patients diagnosed with new neurological
complications during hospitalization for COVID-19 had a 2-fold increased odds of worse 6month functional outcome compared to hospitalized COVID-19 patients without neurological
complications. Furthermore, over half of these neurologically affected patients could not
independently perform some of their basic activities of daily living and 59% of those employed
prior to COVID-19 infection were unable to return to work by 6-months. While return to work
metrics may be impacted by pandemic-related economic conditions, patients with neurological
complications were still significantly less likely to return to work than patients living in the same
metropolitan area without neurological complications. While patients with new neurological
events had higher baseline levels of dementia, stroke, and seizure, increased odds of worse 6month functional outcomes persisted after adjusting for these baseline differences, as well as for
baseline premorbid modified Rankin scores.
Though we hypothesized that patients with neurological disorders would generally have
worse long-term outcomes, we found that both groups of patients had high rates of cognitive
impairment approaching or exceeding 50% at 6-months. While we did not compare our patients
to non-COVID controls, the estimated prevalence of mild cognitive impairment in the general
community among patients aged 65-69 years (the median age of our population) is only 8.4%28
and the prevalence of dementia is <1%29. Notably, we did not find a correlation between
depression and cognition scores, suggesting that depression alone is not the cause of cognitive
deficits. Neuropsychiatric symptom burden was also substantial, with nearly two-thirds of all
patients reporting worse than average anxiety, depression, fatigue or sleep disorders. Because

we used T-scores for Neuro-QoL metrics, these findings represent abnormalities compared to
reference populations. Though we identified significant relationships between most outcome
measures and self-reported persistent dyspnea, the association was weak and it does not seem
that dyspnea alone can fully account for the levels of disability or cognitive impairment that we
measured.
Strengths of our study include its prospective ascertainment of data beginning at the time
of index hospitalization, initial neurological diagnoses by board-certified neurologists10, a
propensity-score matched control group and a multi-domain outcome battery. This is the first
study, to our knowledge to prospectively assess long-term neurological function and cognitive
outcomes among COVID-19 hospital survivors in a standardized fashion. Other studies have
presented short-term outcomes between 2 weeks and 2 months from COVID-19 symptom onset,
but neither used formal assessments of fatigue, mood, cognition or functional status30,31. In one
study of outpatients diagnosed with COVID-19, reports of protracted symptoms during the
subacute phase (14-21 days) included persistent fatigue in 35%, persistent loss of taste/smell in
20% and confusion in 20%31. Another study in a hospitalized COVID-19 cohort found that 87%
of patients had at least one lingering COVID-19 symptom in a mean of 60 days after initial
COVID-19 symptom onset, with the most common long-term symptoms being fatigue (53%)
and dyspnea (43%)30. In a large, 6-month study of a COVID-19 cohort from Wuhan, China21,
fatigue or muscle weakness was reported in 63%, and sleep difficulties in 23%, however, these
metrics were not assessed using a standardized battery and it is unclear how these rates compare
to a reference population. This study also identified anxiety or depression in 23% based on the
EuroQol five-dimension five-level questionnaire, but this metric does not differentiate anxiety
and depression. This study also excluded some of the sickest patients such as those with

underlying dementia, psychiatric illness, hospital readmission, nursing home or facility patients
and those physically unable to return for an in-person follow-up. This may explain the higher
rates of anxiety (46% of patients), and depression (25%) that we observed.
We identified neurological complications during index COVID-19 hospitalization, age,
and worse premorbid baseline functional status as independent predictors of poor outcomes,
however, these risk factors are not readily modifiable. Invasive mechanical ventilation and
hypotension requiring vasopressors were associated with worse activities of daily living, fatigue
and sleep. These variables may be potentially modifiable by medications and therapeutics that
were not available early in the pandemic. While we anticipated an association between the
severity of lung injury, hypoxia and worse cognitive outcomes based on prior ARDS studies32
and neuropathological findings of hypoxic brain injury in COVD-19 autopsy specimens33-37, we
did not find a significant relationship. One possibility is that the telephone MOCA may not be
sensitive enough to detect certain types of cognitive impairment. We used this tool because it is
validated for phone interview and would allow us to gather data on patients that would not
otherwise be able to complete follow-up in person due to pandemic related restrictions. Another
possibility is that we were unable to fully capture the duration and severity of hypoxemia burden
using stochastic measures of the lowest oxygen saturation or the lung injury severity scale21.
Furthermore, there is likely an interaction between hypoxemia and hypotension that compounds
the risk of cognitive deficits, however, we only identified a significant effect of the interaction of
intubation and hypotension requiring vasopressors on the outcome of fatigue. The degree and
duration of hypoxemia and/or hypotension required to cause permanent brain injury may vary
from patient to patient depending on the presence of flow-limiting extra- or intracranial vessel
stenosis, carbon dioxide levels, the integrity of cerebral autoregulation, prior ischemic damage,

and the degree of brain metabolic activity and blood flow coupling. Big data studies evaluating
oxygen and blood pressure levels are needed to evaluate these associations further.
We also documented a high rate of readmission (14%) in both the neurological patients
and controls compared to other studies, which reported rates as low as 1% at 6-months21 and
3.6% at 14-days post discharge38. However, the first study excluded patients for whom followup would be difficult (including those readmitted to a hospital for underlying diseases)21 and the
other looked at short-term readmissions within its own hospital system, not accounting for
readmissions that could occur outside of its network38. Because our readmission data came
directly from patients or their surrogates, we were able to capture readmissions across different
hospital systems. It is likely that limited access to outpatient follow-up during the New York
COVID-19 surge may have contributed to this high readmission rate. Systematic video and
phone follow-up early after discharge may help mitigate readmission risk.
There are limitations to our work. First, though all patients completed the mRS
evaluation, the sickest patients were unable to complete other metrics due to limited function.
Thus, secondary outcomes may actually be worse than what we were able to measure.
Additionally, family members of patients who did poorly may be less motivated to participate in
research. Second, certain outcomes may be confounded by unmeasured factors. For example,
return to work may be impacted by the current economic environment. Anxiety, depression,
fatigue and sleep may be similarly impacted by unmeasured societal, economic and
environmental pandemic-associated factors. Comparing COVID-19 patients to similar
community members without COVID-19 would help quantify the impact of some of these
unmeasured factors. Third, though we identified high rates of disability among both
neurological COVID-19 patients and controls, this study was not designed to determine whether

the deficits measured by these metrics are static or represent ongoing injury as suggested by
some “long-hauler” and post-COVID literature39. Since cognitive impairment and mood
abnormalities occur in over 50% of ARDS survivors40, it is possible that the level of disability
we are documenting is not specific to SARS-CoV-2, but rather a result of factors related to
critical viral illness. Additional one-year follow-up in this cohort may help clarify the trajectory
of recovery. Fourth, the telephone MOCA is meant to screen for cognitive impairment, but more
extensive neuropsychological testing is needed to identify specific domains of cognitive
abnormality. While we did adjust for years of education when scoring the telephone MOCA,
other societal factors may impact scores26. Finally, while we did find a small, yet significant
relationship between ongoing severe dyspnea and other outcome metrics, we did not use a
standardized measure of dyspnea because we felt that a longer survey would lead to participant
fatigue and incomplete responses. Further investigation of the impact of long-term pulmonary
sequelae on neurological outcomes is warranted.

CONCLUSIONS:
Over 90% of COVID-19 patients who survived hospitalization had at least one abnormal
outcome metric at 6-months: 56% of patients had limited activities of daily living, 50% had
abnormal cognition, 62% had worse than average anxiety, depression, fatigue or sleep and 47%
of those working pre-morbidly were unable to return to work. Patients with neurological
complications during their index COVID-19 admission had significantly worse functional
outcomes as measured by the mRS and Barthel scales, and were less likely to return to work,
even after accounting for other premorbid factors. The frequency and severity of functional,
cognitive and mood abnormalities among COVID-19 hospital survivors-- with or without

Univariate variables with P<0.100 (see Table S2) were evaluated in multivariable logistic regression analysis for
each outcome. Additional variables tested in each model are as below (all P>0.05):
^ Barthel Index: married versus not, male sex history of dementia, history of seizure, history of psychiatric illness,
history of stroke, history of chronic kidney disease, history of coronary artery disease, worst SOFA score during
hospitalization, hypotension requiring vasopressors during hospitalization, lowest mean arterial pressure during
hospitalization, toxic metabolic encephalopathy during hospitalization, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy during
hospitalization, corticosteroid use during hospitalization, the interaction term for hypotension requiring vasopressors
and intubation
