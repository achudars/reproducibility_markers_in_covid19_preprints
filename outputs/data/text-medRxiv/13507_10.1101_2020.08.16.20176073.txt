Background: This study aims to identify the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on surgical resident
training and education at Danbury Hospital.

Methods: We conducted an observational study at a Western Connecticut hospital heavily affected by
the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic to assess its effects on surgical residents, focusing on surgical
education, clinical experience, and operative skills development. Objective data was available through
recorded work hours, case logs, and formal didactics. In addition, we created an anonymous survey to
assess resident perception of their residency experience during the pandemic.

Results: There are 22 surgical residents at our institution; all were included in the study. Resident
weekly duty hours decreased by 23.9 hours with the majority of clinical time redirected to caring for
COVID-19 patients. Independent studying increased by 1.6 hours (26.2%) while weekly didactics
decreased by 2.1 hours (35.6%). The operative volume per resident decreased by 65.7% from 35.0 to
12.0 cases for the period of interest, with a disproportionately high effect on junior residents, who
experienced a 76.2% decrease. Unsurprisingly, 70% of residents reported a negative effect of the
pandemic on their surgical skills.

Conclusions: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, surgical residents’ usual workflows
changed dramatically, as much of their time was dedicated to the critical care of patients with COVID19. However, the consequent opportunity cost was to surgery-specific training; there was a significant
decrease in operative cases and time spent in surgical didactics, along with elevated concern about
overall preparedness for their intended career.

Key words: General Surgery, Resident education, COVID-19, training.

Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a multitude of unprecedented effects on healthcare
systems across the United States. Danbury Hospital is located in Western Connecticut, an area
considered to be one of the epicenters of the first wave of the pandemic from March-May of 2020.
Within the healthcare system, alterations to usual operations and changes in the allocation of human and
material resources dramatically changed everyday workflow in hospitals.1,2,3 Examples of this include
the cancellation of non-emergent operations, the transition of various sectors to Telehealth medicine,
and the redistribution of surgical residents to non-surgical services. Other effects on surgical residents
have involved modification of duty hour limitations and adjustments to resident education. Around the
world, institutions have transitioned to virtual platforms for academic sessions. Many local and national
research conferences have been postponed or cancelled, and requirements for standardized exams have
changed.4 The effects of these revisions in the long term are challenging to predict, particularly because
the response to these singular events has varied significantly across states, healthcare systems, and
hospitals.5 We aim to utilize both quantitative and qualitative data to analyze these effects in the short
term, and postulate how this may evolve over time. Specifically, we hypothesize that surgical residents
are working fewer hours and logging fewer operative cases, and that along with changes in education
and academic opportunities, this has led to rising concern regarding preparedness for future surgical
careers.

Methods: Within the Nuvance Health Network, major changes to usual operations due to the COVID19 pandemic were instituted between March 3rd and May 25th, 2020. We therefore chose this as the
period of interest. We focused on three components of surgical education: clinical experience, didactic
conferences, and operative volume.

For clinical experience, we compared the number of duty hours logged by residents during the
period of interest with the same time in 2019, and calculated a gross difference and percent change. To
evaluate didactic conferences, we calculated the average weekly hours of scheduled didactic lectures
during the same period in 2019 and 2020. Additionally, we developed a survey to assess resident
perception of changes in didactic structure during this time. We examined total major surgeries logged
by residents through the ACGME portal during the period of interest, compared to 2019, and calculated
a gross difference as well as percent change in order to assess operative opportunities.
The survey was administered anonymously through SurveyMonkey® to all surgical residents at
Danbury Hospital between June 9th and June 26th, 2020. For questions regarding hours, we calculated
the perceived difference in hours for each individual response. Mean and standard deviation for the
change were calculated for each question. The survey also contained five-point Likert questions, for
which the percentage of residents who responded positively with “agree” or “strongly agree” was
calculated.
Our Institutional Review Board deemed this study exempt (IRB# 2012208337) and waived the
need for participant consent.

Results: There were 18 surgical residents in 2019 and 22 in 2020, respectively.
Clinical experience: Clinical experience was assessed in two ways: first, we examined the duty
hours logged for clinical work and number of outpatient clinics attended, and second, through several
anonymous survey questions, completed by 91% of surgical residents. Surgical residents worked an
average of 64.7 hours/week before the COVID-19 pandemic, and 40.8 hours/week during the pandemic,
a 37.0% decrease (Table 1). A significant portion of the clinical experience for surgical residents was

redirected to caring for COVID-19 patients during the pandemic. In the survey, residents reported
working between 28-38 (SD=26.7) hours/week caring for COVID-19 patients (Table 1). In regards to
outpatient clinics, in 2019 for the period of interest residents averaged 4.7 clinics, while in 2020 this
decreased by 70.2% to 1.4 clinics per resident.
Educational experience: An average of 5.9 hours/week were spent on organized didactics before
COVID-19 (Table 2). This included 3 hours of protected time for resident education based on the
SCORE curriculum, morbidity and mortality conference, grand rounds, specialty attending conferences,
and trauma review conference. During the pandemic, all conferences were done remotely through
teleconferencing, and the average time spent on organized didactics was 3.8 hours/week - a reduction of
35.6% (Table 2). Residents were split on whether the quality of didactics improved, with 35% reporting
an improvement, and 35% perceiving a decrease in quality. Despite a significant drop in clinical work of
22.1 hours per week, residents reported an increase in independent studying of only 1.6 hours per week:
from 6.1 to 7.7 hours per week (Table 2).
Operative Experience: From March 3rd to May 25th, 2019, residents at Danbury Hospital logged
600 operative cases. For the same period during the COVID-19 pandemic, residents logged 240 cases, a
60% decrease (Table 3). Since the number of residents in each post-graduate year (PGY) position varied
from 2019 to 2020 we calculated number of cases per resident. On average there were 35 cases per
resident before the pandemic, which decreased by 65.7% to 12.0 cases per resident during the pandemic
(Table 3). Junior residents in PGY1, 2, and 3 positions were disproportionally affected during the
pandemic, with a 76.2% decrease from 25.2 to 6.0 cases per resident for the study period. Senior
residents in PGY4 and PGY5 positions saw a 49.7% decreased in operative cases, from 59.6 to 30.0
cases per resident. Overall, 70% of residents felt their surgical skills have been negatively affected by
the pandemic.

Discussion:
During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, Danbury Hospital was among the first
institutions on the East Coast outside of New York City to be significantly impacted. Its surgical training
program trains 22 residents. From March 3rd through May 25th, the hospital was put on emergency status
and restructured to maximize the number of COVID-19 patients that could be hospitalized. During this
time, ICU capacity to manage ventilated patients was increased from 20 beds to 90, with subsequent
redistribution of space within the hospital, education and deployment of nursing staff to critical care
units, and changes to all residency programs within the hospital. One of the new 20-bed ICU pods was
placed under the care of surgical residents under the supervision of critical care surgeons and
anesthesiologists. Additionally, all elective operations were canceled with the exception of urgent cancer
surgeries. 6 This restructuring affected surgical clinical experience, weekly protected time for didactics,
and operative opportunities for surgical residents.

Clinical experience:
This restructuring of the program is similar to that reported by institutions in other highly
affected areas.7 Unlike this study, prior literature did not address the effect of this restructuring on
resident training, but discussed their experience and offered recommendations on how to safely and
effectively prepare hospitals and programs.8,9 In this study, we demonstrate that surgical residents had a
significant contribution to the overall COVID-19 response at Danbury Hospital, with an average resident
spending 28-38 hours per week caring for critical COVID-19 patients (Table 1). This contribution
resulted in a decrease in clinical duty hours by 35.1%, from 64.7 to 40.8 hours per week, in addition to
fewer outpatient clinics attended, and less operative experience. However, surgical residents spent more

time in a critical care setting, which the American Board of Surgery (ABS) identifies as a primary
component of general surgery training.10 Similarly, Meyer et al. argued that surgical critical care is
crucial for practicing surgeons to be able to holistically manage ill patients with life-threatening
conditions. ABS has no specific requirement for duration of ICU rotations; instead, it requires a log of
25 critically ill patients. Prior studies describe a wide variability in surgical critical care training and
fund of knowledge of graduating residents.11,12 Therefore, this sudden increase in critical care training is
one of beneficial effects on surgical training.10
One of the ways to enhance resident clinical experience to supplement the drop in clinical duties
and outpatient clinic attendance through resident involvement in telehealth clinics.13 At our institution
there were several barriers to this proposal, including a lack of infrastructure to transition to telehealth
and the uncertainty of the timing of elective surgeries resumption. Both of these factors resulted in low
volume of appointments initially; however, as telehealth became more common incorporation of
residents became more feasible. More widespread incorporation of resident involvement in telehealth
clinics can potentially be an invaluable supplementation to clinical experience.

Educational Experience:
The COVID-19 pandemic changed surgical resident didactics, resulting in a decrease in
protected time for academics. This was a surprising finding, given the implementation of video
conferencing and noted reduced clinical responsibilities of residents. All conferences at our institution
transitioned to video platforms, allowing presenters to share screens from remote locations and
facilitating assembly of large groups of peers in a safe manner. Other advantages of video platforms
include the ability to record lectures for viewing outside of scheduled time, and increased ease in

inviting leading experts and educators from prestigious academic institutions to present and discuss
topics within their specialty.
Another surprising finding in our study was that despite a decrease in clinical duties by 17 hours
per week, independent studying only increased by only 1.6 hours/ week. Given this significant decrease
in clinical hours, we expected a larger increase in time spent studying independently. Several factors
may play a role here. Given the timing of the national surgical in-training exam (ABSITE), residents
may have felt less pressure to increase their time in independent study. Residents who formerly utilized
independent study time to prepare for elective cases naturally would decrease time spent on this
endeavor.

Operative Experience:
Perhaps most obviously, the COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the operative
component of surgical training (Table 3). The cancelation of all elective cases resulted in a 60%
reduction in total major cases logged by residents. This disproportionally affected junior residents, who
went from 25.2 to 6.0 cases per resident, a 76.2% decrease during the periods of interest. Meanwhile,
senior resident cases decreased by 49.7%, from 59.6 to 30.0 cases per resident. The American Board of
Surgery (ABS) decreased the number of required operative cases for graduating seniors as a direct
consequence of the pandemic.14 However, such a dramatic decrease in surgical volume will likely affect
residents at all levels moving forward. In the survey, 70% of residents reported that the pandemic has
negatively affected their surgical skills and 35% reported concern about preparedness to become an
attending.
The long-term impacts of the pandemic remain to be seen, yet surgery residents still have a
limited five years to acquire the clinical knowledge and operative experience to become surgeons. ABS

deems the requirement to qualify for board certification is 54 weeks of surgical clinical experience and
750 logged procedures in defined categories.11 Therefore, the significant drop in operative volume is
concerning, as physical skill is fundamental to surgical education. One solution to supplement the
growing deficit of operative experience is simulation-based training (SBT). Prior studies demonstrated
that surgical residents value the ability of SBT to expose them to new procedures, but conclusions were
divided on the best ways to implement SBT within curricula.15 Through SBT, residents can improve
dexterity and speed in operative maneuvers and enhance their technical skill.16 Resident performance
can even be assessed by attendings or colleagues observing remotely through videoconferencing. This
provides a unique opportunity to progress physical skills while maintaining social distancing, and
additionally provides another outlet for independent study while clinical hours are reduced.
High quality surgical videos can also help compensate for diminished operative volume.
Although not a tactile exercise, when viewed in a group setting with discussion driven by faculty, these
sessions can supplement resident operative education.13 Videos can also play a role in flipped classroom
models in which pre-recorded lectures are watched prior to conferences, which enhances knowledge
acquisition and enriches discussion.
The main limitation of this study was that it was limited to a single surgical residency program.
Therefore, the results may not be generalizable to residents in other programs in the United States.
However, as one of the earliest areas affected by COVID-19, we are able to analyze its effects in a
timely fashion that may benefit other geographic areas affected similarly in the future. While residents in
states with lower incidence of COVID-19 may not be as significantly impacted as residents at our
institution, continued evolution of the COVID pandemic and the rise of new epicenters of disease may
make these results more generalizable over time. Despite the limitations, these results are integral in
critically thinking about the future of surgical education. The COVID-19 pandemic will continue to

affect residency programs across the country with changes to clinical work, didactics, and operative
experience of surgical residents.
As physicians, our highest mandate is patient care. We have an ethical and moral responsibility
to take care of COVID-19 patients, and there is a great deal to be learned from such experiences.
Nonetheless, the cultivation of surgical knowledge and physical skills is integral to the development of
future surgeons, and the short duration of residency education is an incomparably formative time. It is
important to keep in mind that the role COVID-19 as a disease will have in the future of medical care is
impossible to divine, and that regardless of the role it plays, medicine will still need the specific
capabilities for which surgeons are trained.

Conclusion:
During the first wave of the pandemic, surgical residents had a significant contribution to care of
patients with COVID-19. The impacts of the pandemic on surgeon training continue to evolve, and
undoubtedly will have complex long-term effects, both positive and negative. It is important to
continually assess how resident training is affected, and to consider innovative approaches to maintain
clinical, operative, and educational experiences.
