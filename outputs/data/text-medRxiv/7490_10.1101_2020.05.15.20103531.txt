ABSTRACT
Background: Anti-inflammatory therapies such as IL-6 inhibition have been proposed for
COVID-19 in a vacuum of evidence-based treatment. However, abrogating the inflammatory
response in infectious diseases may impair a desired host response and predispose to secondary
infections.
Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical record of critically ill COVID-19 patients
during an 8-week span and compared the prevalence of secondary infection and outcomes in
patients who did and did not receive tocilizumab. Additionally, we included representative
histopathologic post-mortem findings from several COVID-19 cases that underwent autopsy at
our institution.
Results: 111 patients were identified, of which 54 had received tocilizumab while 57 had not.
Receiving tocilizumab was associated with a higher risk of secondary bacterial (48.1% vs.
28.1%, p=0.029 and fungal (5.6% vs. 0%, p=0.112) infections. Consistent with higher number of
infections, patients who received tocilizumab had higher mortality (35.2% vs. 19.3%, p=0.020).
Seven cases underwent autopsy. In 3 cases who received tocilizumab, there was evidence of
pneumonia on pathology. Of the 4 cases that had not been given tocilizumab, 2 showed evidence
of aspiration pneumonia and 2 exhibited diffuse alveolar damage.
Conclusions: Experimental therapies are currently being applied to COVID-19 outside of
clinical trials. Anti-inflammatory therapies such as anti-IL-6 therapy have the potential to impair
viral clearance, predispose to secondary infection, and cause harm. We seek to raise physician
awareness of these issues and highlight the need to better understand the immune response in
COVID-19.

While there has been a dramatic increase in the number of clinical trials, there remains a shortage
of effective therapies for COVID-19, particularly for patients who develop critical illness. The
management of such patients remains largely supportive. Early reports from China suggested
that an exaggerated immune response may play a role in the development of respiratory failure,
shock, and multiorgan dysfunction in critically ill patients with COVID-19 (1). Similarities
between the exaggerated immune response associated with COVID-19 and the cytokine release
syndrome (CRS) reported in patients with CAR T-cell therapy led to the use of tocilizumab, an
anti-IL-6 therapy to attenuate hyperimmune responses associated with COVID-19 (2). However,
inhibition of IL-6 may also have adverse consequences. Mice lacking IL-6 response have
impaired immunity against viral, bacterial and fungal pathogens (3). Humans treated with
tocilizumab had higher risk of serious bacterial, skin and soft tissue infections (4-7). Lastly, IL-6
appears to play a complicated role viral clearance(8). To date, several reports detail institutional
experiences with treating COVID-19 with tocilizumab.(9-13) As expected, inflammatory
markers (cytokines, temperature) generally demonstrated a profound response to tocilizumab
administration. However, as most reports lack a comparison group, it is difficult to ascertain
whether patients clinically benefitted from inhibition of the inflammatory response. Similarly,
available reports often restrict secondary infections to documented blood stream infections,
which may significantly underestimate the infectious complications of anti-IL-6 therapy in the
critically ill. We sought to determine the incidence of secondary infections and outcomes of
patients who received tocilizumab for COVID-19 compared to those who did not in the COVID19 intensive care unit (ICU) at our institution.

2.1 Patients
We retrospectively analyzed all patients who were admitted to the COVID-19 ICU between the
dates of March 1, 2020 and April 27, 2020. The study was approved by the University of
Chicago Institutional Review Board. Additionally, 7 patients underwent autopsy, the
histopathology of which was reviewed with our colleagues from pathology.

Tocilizumab was included in our internal institutional protocol for the treatment of COVID-19,
specifically for use in patients with progressive clinical deterioration and elevated inflammatory
markers at the discretion of the treating team and infectious diseases consultation service. Our
protocol recommended a standard dose of 400 mg of tocilizumab administered intravenously
with the potential for redosing based on clinical response (e.g. oxygenation status, hemodynamic
stability, inflammatory marker response). Tocilizumab was generally not considered in patients
with liver function test (LFT) abnormalities, significant cytopenias, or documented ongoing
infection. Similarly, patients enrolled in clinical trials (e.g. remdesivir) were not eligible to
receive tocilizumab.

2.3 Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was conducted with SPSS version 26 (IBM, Armonk, NY) and R version 4
(Package Logistf). APACHE II score and Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) were not normally
distributed and thus were analyzed with Mann-Whitney U-test. Count variables were analyzed
with Chi-square and continuous variables were analyzed with t-tests.

Multivariate regression analysis was completed in R with the outcome variable being the
development of bacterial infection. The predictors (i.e., independent variables) were selected
using Chi-square statistics. Variables that are statistically different between those were given
tocilizumab and those who were not, were sex with the predominance of males in the
tocilizumab group, history of transplant and use of immunosuppressive agents, and APACHE II
scores were trending higher in the tocilizumab group (p=0.078, Mann-Whitney U test) (see table
1). There was high correlation between history of transplantation and immunosuppressive use as
expected. Thus, we only included immunosuppressive use in the multivariate model. There was a
trend towards a higher proportion of patients with diabetes mellitus with organ damage in those
with bacterial infection and past medical history of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary
embolism (PE) .No other clinical variables were statistically different by tocilizumab use or the
development of bacterial infections. Although steroid use was not statistically significantly
different between those were given tocilizumab and those who were not, steroids were included
in the model as they have been shown to affect COVID19 disease course and can predispose to
bacterial infections. Therefore, the final model included age, sex, tocilizumab use, steroid use,
diabetes with organ damage, DVT/PE, CCI, APACHE II score and immunosuppressive use. Of
these, age, sex, diabetes with organ damage, CCI, and immunosuppressive use were not
independently associated with the development of bacterial infections (all p>0.05). The reported
odds ratios (ORs) reflect exponents of β from a Firth penalized regression model in R. Firth
regression was chosen to avoid separation in the model (14).

Bacterial infections are increased in critically ill patients who received tocilizumab. We
identified 111 patients admitted to the COVID-19 ICU during that period. Among 54 patients
who received tocilizumab, the majority (44 patients, 81%) received the standard dose of 400 mg.
However, protocol deviations occurred with respect to dosing in some patients. Six patients
received a total of 800 mg, one patient received 560 mg, two patients received 200 mg and one
patient received 160 mg. We compared bacterial and fungal infections in those that received the
drug to those that did not. Except for the male sex preponderance in tocilizumab group, there
were no differences in patient baseline characteristics including CCI between the two groups
(Table 1). Secondary infections were defined by positive culture data or high clinical suspicion
of infection requiring the initiation of antimicrobials and documentation in the progress note. In
the tocilizumab group, only infections occurring after the tocilizumab dose were counted.

Receiving tocilizumab was associated with a higher incidence of secondary bacterial infections
including hospital acquired pneumonia and ventilator associated pneumonia (26 (48.1%) vs. 16
(28.1%). p=0.021). Additionally, there were three patients with fungal infections with one patient
having the fungal infection in two different locations in the tocilizumab group compared with
none in the non-tocilizumab group with statistical analysis showing a trend towards significance
(p=0.112). Diagnosis of infection was made approximately 5 days after the administration of
tocilizumab (4.9±3.0 days, median=4 days, 95% CI 3.67-6.17 days).

Tocilizumab is independently associated with increased bacterial infections. In multivariate
logistic regression model to predict bacterial infections, the following independent variables
were included: age, sex, APACHE II score, CCI, immunosuppression, presence of DVT/PE,
diabetes with any organ damage and use of tocilizumab and steroids. Tocilizumab use was
independently positively associated with the development of bacterial infections with an odds

ratio of 2.76 (95% CI 1.11-7.20) p=0.0295. APACHE II score was also independently positively
associated with bacterial infections (OR: 1.08, 95% CI: 1.01-1.16, p=0.016). While steroid
administration did not reach statistical significance, there was a trend towards steroids being
positively associated with bacterial infections (OR: 2.76, 95% CI: 0.91-9.02, p=0.074). History
of DVT/PE was negatively associated with bacterial infections (OR: 0.09, 95% CI: 0.00070.824). The remaining variables including age, sex, CCI, immunosuppression, and presence of
diabetes with any organ damage were not independently associated with bacterial infections.

Due to well-known limitations with bacterial cultures in hospitalized and critically ill patients,
we included both culture-proven and suspected bacterial infections in our analysis. While the
tocilizumab group had 10 culture proven bacterial infections, non-tocilizumab group had 9
culture proven bacterial infections. This was not statistically significant. Seven patients in the
non-tocilizumab and 16 patients in the tocilizumab group were treated for a bacterial infection
although the cultures were negative or non-diagnostic. There was no statistical difference
between the two groups in terms of culture negative bacterial infections (p=0.261).

We also compared laboratory data between two groups. In addition to the laboratory data
included in the APACHE II score, we analyzed white blood cell count (WBC), percent and
absolute lymphocyte count, D-dimer, C-reactive protein and ferritin, which were evaluated to
determine the level of systemic inflammation as part of laboratory work up for COVID-19.
There was no difference in WBC, percent lymphocyte, D-dimer, C-reactive protein and ferritin
levels between the tocilizumab and non-tocilizumab groups (Figure 1). However, mean absolute
lymphocyte count was statistically lower in tocilizumab group compared to non-tocilizumab
group (mean difference =0.33, p=0.02). However, there was no correlation between bacterial
infections and the absolute lymphocyte count (Spearman’s rho= -0.005, p=0.959). Inclusion of
the absolute lymphocyte count in the multivariate Firth regression did not change the significant
variables in the model (data not shown).

Our study did not follow outpatient status of patients treated in the ICU and not all patients had a
definite outcome at the time of the study. In this preliminary analysis, compared to patients who
did not receive tocilizumab, those who were prescribed tocilizumab had higher mortality (19/54
(35.2%) vs. 11/57 (19.3%, p=0.020) and a lesser number of patients were discharged home in the
tocilizumab group (33.3% vs. 59.6%, tocilizumab and non-tocilizumab group, respectively)
(Table 2).

All 5 transplant patients in the study received tocilizumab. Out of these 5 patients, two were
treated for a bacterial infection (one culture proven, and the other presumed based on high
clinical suspicion of infection). Only one of the patients in the transplant group died. Overall
transplant status did not affect outcomes. We also reviewed the administration of steroids and
other immunosuppressive agents. More patients in the tocilizumab group received steroids
compared to non-tocilizumab group (8 (14%) vs. 13 (24.1%), p=0.227). Administration of
immunosuppressive agents, steroids alone or in combination with tocilizumab did not affect the
outcomes (Table 2). After exclusion of immunosuppressed individuals from the dataset, a higher
proportion of patients with bacterial infections were still observed in the tocilizumab group
(16/57 vs. 24/49, p=0.034).

Their post-mortem evaluation showed evidence of aspiration pneumonia. The other two patients
who did not receive tocilizumab were hospitalized for 4 and 12 days. Their lungs demonstrated
only pathological changes consistent with diffuse alveolar damage without any evidence of
pneumonia (Figure 2). These findings raise concerns about the use of tocilizumab to attenuate
possible CRS. In particular, the occurrence of secondary bacterial infections may prolong ICU
stays, and the occurrence of secondary fungal infections stands out as unusual in critical care
patients without traditional risk factors (e.g. neutropenia).

4 DISCUSSION
Receiving tocilizumab was associated with a significantly higher rate of secondary infections and
mortality at our institution. Furthermore, review of the available autopsy findings suggest that
bacterial pneumonia is not uncommon in patients who die from COVID-19, particularly if they
have received tocilizumab previously. These findings raise concerns about the use of anti-IL-6
therapy to attenuate a cytokine-release-like syndrome in COVID-19.

Host response to the pathogen during sepsis is a double-edged sword. Infection is generally met
by a desired host inflammatory response, which can at times be vigorous. For decades,
physicians have speculated whether this host response is to blame, at least in part, for the multiorgan dysfunction associated with infection, as can be seen in sepsis. In fact, the most recent
definition of sepsis includes the term “dysregulated host response to infection”. According to
current thought, there is orchestration of temporally distinct phases of the immune response,
consisting of both initial prompt upregulation and subsequent curtailment. Dysfunctional
responses may lead to overwhelming infection or persistent inflammation. Cytokines must be
viewed through this lens: IL-6 may contribute to organ injury and death, but it is also central to
innate immunity and microbial clearance.

At this time, it remains difficult to characterize the stage of the inflammatory response on an
individual basis in real time. Similarly, many characteristics seen in severe inflammation,
including, within autoregulatory limits, hypotension, may in fact represent an adaptive response.
A dramatic elevation in inflammatory cytokines or other markers such as ferritin may indicate a
particularly brisk host response against a more severe infection. Without proper discriminatory
values that reliably identify patients in whom hyper-inflammation is the key driver of
pathogenesis, treatment with anti-inflammatory therapies may be detrimental. While there may
be a subset of patients who may potentially benefit from the use of tocilizumab, current evidence
does not support the routine use of tocilizumab or other drugs that regulate host immune
response (i.e. anti-IL1, anti-TNFα) in COVID-19 or non-COVID-19 sepsis. Evidence of efficacy
for IL-6 blockade currently exists in rheumatological diseases and to manage complications of T
cell engaging therapies, which are driven by a primary immune response. To date, there is no
convincing evidence that immune blockade is clinically beneficial when microbial infections
drive the host response. Indeed, a previous anti-cytokine strategy targeting TNFα increased
mortality in septic patients (15) and was linked to increased risk of infections(16).

There are several important limitations to our study. The most important limitation is the
retrospective nature and lack of randomization. Naturally, this does not allow for the
establishment of causality. Because our study was retrospective, while the majority of baseline
characteristics were similar, there were some that were slightly different. These include the
history of transplant and use of immunosuppressive agents. Despite these limitations, patients in

both groups were relatively closely matched with regards to severity of illness (APACHE II
score, laboratory parameters). Patients who received tocilizumab may have developed more
severe disease during the course of their ICU stay, however, our institutional policies regarding
tocilizumab included important exclusion criteria, including LFT abnormalities, suspected
ongoing infection, and enrollment in a clinical trial (e.g. remdesivir). In light of these limitations,
it appears unlikely that the group receiving tocilizumab was excessively enriched with the sickest
patients and gives credence to the descriptive power of the severity of illness captured by
APACHE II scoring. While the non-tocilizumab group did not have any patients with
transplantation and all patients with history of transplantation were in the tocilizumab group,
history of transplantation did not affect the outcomes. Furthermore, it should be noted that the
mortality data herein should be considered preliminary, because some patients were still
hospitalized at the time of this analysis and all outcomes were not known.

We did not restrict our definition to rely solely on microbiologic data but defined infection as:
documented infection in the medical record and antibiotic therapy initiated and continued for >2
days. This definition reflects real-world circumstances, as microbiologic identification of the
causative organism is frequently not achieved in infections in the ICU, in particular for hospitalacquired and ventilator-acquired pneumonias (HAP, VAP). Furthermore, the IDSA/ATS
guideline definitions of HAP and VAP do not rely on microbiologic data. Nonetheless, it is
possible that our definition is too broad and may capture some patients who were treated for
clinical deterioration due to COVID-19 rather than a secondary infection. However, our
definition is similar to other studies where diagnoses are based on coding. Restriction to only
microbiologically proven cases would likely miss a number of infections and may capture
contaminants. While the numbers are small, the autopsy findings support the notion that bacterial
pneumonia may be present even in absence of positive culture data.

Severe COVID-19 often elicits a strong inflammatory response with elevation in several
cytokines, such as IL-6. This inflammatory phenotype shares clinical features with CAR-T cellinduced CRS and has led to the off-label use of tocilizumab for COVID-19. However, clinical
similarity does not necessarily mean that changes seen in COVID-19 and CAR-T CRS are
causally related and due to an overactive immune system. At least in part, the forceful immune
response in COVID-19 may be adaptive and required for the anti-viral response. In our group of
critically-ill COVID-19 patients, the use of tocilizumab was associated with an increase in
infections. Our findings should raise physician awareness about the potential side effects of
tocilizumab on pathogen clearance and development of secondary infections and additional risk
vs. benefit discussions with patients and their families. It also calls for the urgent need to study
all drugs including any immunosuppressive agents in randomized controlled trials to better
understand their role in any hyperimmune response and on clearance of SARS-CoV-2 and other
hospital-acquired pathogens, before their routine use is widely implemented.

Figure 2. Postmortem histopathology of lungs from COVID-19 patients. Low (100x) and
high power (200x) images of lungs from patients who died due to COVID-19. A. Organizing
hyaline membranes are seen in the lung which has pre-existing emphysema (100x). Higher
power shows fibrin, fibroblasts and mononuclear cells incorporated into the alveolar walls
(200x). B. There is diffuse alveolar damage with hyaline membranes lining alveoli (100x).
Higher power shows minimal inflammation with only a few mononuclear cells (200x). C. There
is extensive intra-alveolar inflammation (neutrophils) in an otherwise normal lung (100x). On
higher power, there is minimal alveolar wall thickening by inflammatory cells (also mainly
neutrophils on myeloperoxidase staining and only rare lymphocytes) (200x). D. Majority of the
sections from this case show organizing intra-alveolar fibrin (100x). Several foci of acute
