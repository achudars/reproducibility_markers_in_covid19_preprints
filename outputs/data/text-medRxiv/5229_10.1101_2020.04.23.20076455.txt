Abstract

8

After the initial outbreak in China, the diffusion in Italy of SARS-CoV-2 is exhibiting a clear

9

regional trend with Northern areas being the most affected in terms of both frequency and

10

severity of cases. Among multiple factors possibly involved in such geographical differences, a role

11

has been hypothesized for atmospheric pollution. We provide additional evidence on the possible

12

influence of air quality, particularly in terms of chronicity of exposure on the spread viral infection

13

in Italian regions. Actual data on COVID-19 outbreak in Italian provinces and corresponding long-

14

term air quality evaluations, were obtained from Italian and European agencies, elaborated and

15

tested for possible interactions. Our elaborations reveal that, beside concentrations, the chronicity

16

of exposure may influence the anomalous variability of SARS-CoV-2 in Italy. Data on distribution of

17

atmospheric pollutants (NO2, O3, PM2.5 and PM10) in Italian regions during the last 4 years, days

18

exceeding regulatory limits, and years of the last decade (2010-2019) in which the limits have been

19

exceeded for at least 35 days, confirmed that Northern Italy has been constantly exposed to

20

chronic air pollution. Long-term air-quality data significantly correlated with cases of Covid-19 in

21

up to 71 Italian provinces (updated 27 April 2020) providing further evidence that chronic

22

exposure to atmospheric contamination may represent a favourable context for the spread of the

23

virus. Pro-inflammatory responses and high incidence of respiratory and cardiac affections are well

24

known, while the capability of this coronavirus to bind particulate matters remains to be

25

established. Atmospheric and environmental pollution should be considered as part of an

26

integrated approach for sustainable development, human health protection and prevention of

27

epidemic spreads but in a long-term and chronic perspective, since adoption of mitigation actions

28

during a viral outbreak could be of limited utility.

29

30

Capsule. Chronic exposure to air pollutants might have a role in the spread of COVID-19 in Italian

31

regions. Diffusion of Covid-19 in 71 Italian provinces correlated with long-term air-quality data.

Main text

35

In December 2019, several pneumonia cases were suddenly observed in the metropolitan

36

city of Wuhan (China), as the result of infection to a novel coronavirus (Li et al., 2020; Wu et al.,

37

2020; Xu et al., 2020). This virus was termed SARS-CoV-2 for its similarity with that responsible of

38

the global epidemic Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) occurred between 2002 and 2003

39

(Xu et al., 2020). Patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection often experienced serious

40

complications, including organ failure, septic shock, pulmonary oedema, severe pneumonia and

41

acute respiratory stress syndrome which in several cases were fatal (Chen et al., 2020; Sohrabi et

42

al., 2020). The most severe symptoms, requiring intensive care recovery, were generally observed

43

in older individuals with previous comorbidities, such as cardiovascular, endocrine, digestive and

44

respiratory diseases (Sohrabi et al., 2020; Wang D. et al., 2020). The World Health Organization

45

(WHO) has defined this new syndrome with the acronym COVID-19 for Corona Virus Disease 2019

46

(Sohrabi et al., 2020; WHO, 2020a).

47

The drastic containment measures adopted by Chinese government did not prevent the

48

diffusion of SARS-CoV-2, which in a few weeks has spread globally. Italy was the first country in

49

Europe to be affected by the epidemic COVID-19, with an outbreak even larger than that originally

50

observed in China (Fanelli and Piazza, 2020; Remuzzi and Remuzzi, 2020). Other European

51

countries and United States rapidly registered an exponential growth of clinical cases, leading to

52

restrictions and a global lockdown with evident social and economic repercussions (Cohen and

53

Kupferschmidt, 2020; ECDC, 2020). The WHO has recently declared the pandemic state of COVID-

54

19 with over 2.8 million of cases reported and over 201.000 victims worldwide (Cucinotta and

55

Vanelli, 2020; WHO, 2020b; ECDC, 2020, accessed on 27 April 2020).

56

The ongoing epidemic trend in Italy immediately showed strong regional differences in the

57

spread of infections, with most cases concentrated in the north of the country (Remuzzi and

58

Remuzzi, 2020). The distribution of positive cases reported from February 24th to April 27th is

59

summarized in Figure 1A: some areas of Lombardy and Piedmont clearly exceeded 10.000 cases,

60

e.g. 18.371 at Milan, 12.564 at Brescia, 11.113 at Bergamo, 12199 at Turin (data re-elaborated

61

from the official daily reports of the Department of Civil Protection, ICPD, 2020, accessed on 27

62

April 2020). Also, the relative percentage distribution of the positive test rate (Figure 1B) exhibit

63

higher values in Northern Italy despite a certain uncertainty of data due to the different numbers

64

and frequency of oropharyngeal swabs performed in various regions to test coronavirus positivity;

65

mortality rate ranged from 18% in the most affected, northern regions to less than 5% in the

66

others (Figure 1C). Overall these trends are confirmed from the rates of reported COVID-19 cases

67

and of fatal events, expressed as percentage values normalized to the number of inhabitants for

68

regional populations (Figures 1D and 1E), further corroborating significantly greater effects in

69

Northern Italy, both in terms of number of infections and the severity of cases (mortality).

70

To explain such geographical trend, it was initially assumed that restrictions decided by

71

government authorities after the first outbreak in Lombardy, had contained the effects of the

72

infection, preventing its rapid spread to the rest of the country. Some authors, however, from the

73

clinical course of a large cohort of patients, have concluded that the epidemic coronavirus had

74

been circulating in Italy for several weeks before the first recognized outbreak and the relative

75

adopted containment measures (Cerada et al., 2020). In this respect, the differentiated occurrence

76

of infection cannot be fully explained by the social confinement actions. Our elaboration we did

77

not include the analysis of other possible determinants of incidence and mortality, such as age

78

structure, capacity of the healthcare system, duration of the confinement since some of these

79

data are currently not immediately available. Future studies will be necessary to fill such gap of

80

knowledge addressing at which extent all these factors may have mutually contributed to the

81

diffusion of COVID-19 in Italy. However, the current profile of the viral outbreak in Northern Italy

82

suggests that other factors could be involved in the diffusion of infection and mortality rates.

83

Since the presence of comorbidities appeared determinant for the aetiology and severity of

84

the COVID-19 symptoms (Chen et al., 2020; Wang T. et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020), the role of

85

atmospheric pollution in contributing to the high levels of SARS-CoV-2 lethality in Northern Italy

86

has been hypothesized (Conticini et al., 2020). Association between short-term exposure to air

87

pollution and COVID-19 infection has been described also for the recent outbreak in China (Zhu et

88

al., 2020). The adverse effects of air pollutants on human health are widely recognized in scientific

89

literature, depending on various susceptibility factors such as age, nutritional status and

90

predisposing conditions (Kampa and Castanas, 2008). Chronic exposure to the atmospheric

91

pollution contributes to increased hospitalizations and mortality, primarily affecting cardiovascular

92

and respiratory systems, causing various diseases and pathologies including cancer (Brunekreef

93

and Holgate, 2002; Kampa and Castanas, 2008). Among air pollutants, the current focus is mainly

94

given on nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) and ozone (O3), frequently

95

occurring at elevated concentrations in large areas of the planet.

96

The percentage of European population exposed to levels higher than the regulatory limits

97

is about 7-8% for NO2, 6-8% for PM2.5, 13-19% for PM10 and 12-29% for O3 (EEA, 2019). Premature

98

deaths due to acute respiratory diseases from such pollutants are estimated to be over to two

99

million per year worldwide and 45.000 for Italy (Brunekreef and Holgate, 2002; Huang et al., 2016;

100

EAA, 2019; Watts et al., 2019).

101

Here, we are providing additional evidence on the possible influence of air quality on the

102

spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Italian regions. Since the effects of air pollutants on human health not

103

only depend on their concentrations but also, if not especially, on chronicity of exposure, we have

104

elaborated the last four years (from 2016 to 2019, EEA, 2020) of regional distribution of NO2, PM2.5

105

and PM10 is presented in Figure 2. The highest atmospheric concentrations were clearly

106

distributed in the Northern areas (Piedmont, Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia-Romagna), in addition

107

to urbanized cities, such as Rome and Naples.

108

The long-term condition of population exposure is also revealed by the number of days per

109

year in which the regulatory limits of O3 and PM10 are exceeded (Figure 3A-B): the critical situation

110

of Northern Italy is reflected by values of up to 80 days of exceedance per year (average of the last

111

three years, EAA, 2019). Worthy to remind, ozone is one of the main precursors for the formation

112

of NO2, and chronic exposure to this contaminant for almost a quarter of a year is undoubtedly of

113

primary importance. The chronic air pollution in Northern Italy is further represented by the

114

number of years during the last decade (2010-2019) in which the limit value for PM10 (50 µg/m3

115

per day) has been exceeded for at least 35 days (Figure 3C). Once again, these data confirm that

116

the whole Northern area below the Alpine arc has been constantly affected by significantly higher

117

levels of these contaminants.

118

The hypothesis that atmospheric pollution may influence the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Italy

119

was also tested from the relationships between the confirmed cases of Covid-19 in up to 71 Italian

120

provinces (updated 27 April 2020) with the corresponding air quality data. The latter were

121

expressed as average concentrations in the last 4 years of NO2, PM2.5 and PM10 (Figure 4A-C) and

122

the number of days exceeding the regulatory limits (averages of the last 3 years) for O3 and PM10

123

(Figure 4D-E). The always significant correlations provided further evidence on the role that

124

chronic exposure to atmospheric contamination may have as a favourable context for the spread

125

and virulence of the SARS-CoV-2 within a population subjected to a higher incidence of respiratory

126

and cardiac affections.

127

It is well known that exposure to atmospheric contaminants modulate the host's

128

inflammatory response leading to an overexpression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines

129

(Gouda et al., 2018). Clear effects of Milan winter PM2.5 were observed on elevated production of

130

interleukin IL-6 and IL-8 in human bronchial cells (Longhin et al., 2018), and also NO2 was shown to

131

correlate with IL-6 levels on inflammatory status (Perret eta al., 2017). The impairment of

132

respiratory system and chronic disease by air pollution can thus facilitate viral infection in lower

133

tracts (Shinya et al., 2006; van Riel et al., 2006).

134

In addition, various studies have reported a direct relationship between the spread and

135

contagion capacity of some viruses with the atmospheric levels and mobility of air pollutants

136

(Ciencewicki and Jaspers, 2007; Sedlmaier et al., 2009). The avian influenza virus (H5N1) could be

137

transported across long distances by fine dust during Asian storms (Chen et al., 2010), and

138

atmospheric levels of PM2.5, PM10, carbon monoxide, NO2 and sulphur dioxide were shown to

139

influence the diffusion of the human respiratory syncytial virus in children (Ye et al., 2016), and the

140

daily spread of the measles virus in China (Chen et al., 2017; Peng et al., 2020).

141

These evidences and presented elaborations would confirm that the anomalous variability

142

of the diffusion and virulence of SARS-CoV-2 in Italy could partly depend on the levels of

143

atmospheric contamination. Although the capability of this coronavirus to bind particulate matters

144

remains to be established, chronic exposure to atmospheric contamination and related diseases

145

may represent a risk factor in determining the severity of COVID-19 syndrome and the high

146

incidence of fatal events (Chen et al., 2020; Conticini et al., 2020; Dutheil et al., 2020; Wang D. et

147

al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020).

148

In conclusion, the actual pandemic event is demonstrating that infectious diseases

149

represent one of the key challenges for human society. Since periodic emergence of viral agents

150

show an increasing correlation with socio-economic, environmental and ecological factors

151

(Morens et al., 2004; Jones et al., 2008), also air quality should be considered as part of an

152

integrated approach toward sustainable development, human health protection and prevention of

153

epidemic spreads. However, the role of atmospheric pollution should be considered in a long-

154

term, chronic perspective, and adoption of mitigation actions only during a viral outbreak could be

155

of limited utility.

Legend of the Figures:
Figure 1

- Regional distribution of COVID-19 outbreak in Italy (from 24 February to 27 April 2020. A)

abundance of COVID-19 cases (absolute number); B) percentage of positive subjects referred to the
number of performed tests (oropharyngeal swabs); C) mortality rate on the number of positive cases; D)
percentage of COVID-19 cases normalized to the number of inhabitants; E) percentage of deaths
normalized to the number of inhabitants. Data obtained and re-elaborated from the official daily reports of
Italian Civil Protection Department (ICPD, 2020).

Figure 2 - Regional data on air quality levels: A) nitrogen dioxide (NO2); B) particulate matter of 2.5 µm or
less (PM2.5); C) particulate matter of 2.5-10 µm (PM10). Data are referred to the means of values of last

3

four years (2016-2019), expressed as µg/m

(obtained and elaborated from the European Environmental

Agency, accessed on 6 April, EEA, 2020).

Figure 3

- Number of days per year exceeding the regulatory limits relating to A) ozone (O3) and to B)

particulate matter (PM10), as average means of the last 3 years (2017-2019); C) number of years in which
the PM10 limit was exceeded for at least 35 days per year, from 2010 to 2019. Data are obtained and
elaborated from annual reports (Legambiente, 2018; 2019; 2020) and referred to the official statistics of
the European Environmental Agency (EEA, 2019).

Figure 4

- Statistical correlation between the regional distribution of COVID-19 cases and the air quality

parameters in Italy: incidence of COVID-19 cases vs levels of A) NO2, B) PM2.5 and C) PM10 (four years
means); incidence of COVID-19 cases vs number of days exceeding regulatory limits of D) O3 and E) PM10
(three years means). Data obtained and elaborated from EEA (2019; 2020), ICPD (2020), and Legambiente
(2018; 2019; 2020).
