ABSTRACT
Background: To estimate seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the US, the country with the
world’s largest absolute numbers of COVID19 cases and deaths, we conducted a cross-sectional
assessment from a sample of patients receiving dialysis in January 2021.
Methods: We tested remainder plasma of 21,424 patients receiving dialysis through the third-largest US
dialysis organization, with facilities located nationwide. We used the Siemens spike protein receptor
binding domain total antibody assay to estimate crude SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence, and then estimated
seroprevalence for the US dialysis and adult population by standardizing by age, sex and region. We also
compared January 2021 seroprevalence and case-detection rates to that from a similar subsample of
patients receiving dialysis who had been tested in July 2020.
Results: Patients in the sample were disproportionately from older age and minority race/ethnic groups.
Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 18.9% (95% CI: 18.3-19.5%) in the sample, 18.7% (18.1-19.2%)
standardized to the US dialysis population, and 21.3% (20.3-22.3%) standardized to the US adult
population (range 15.3-20.8% in the Northeast and South respectively). Younger age groups (18-44
years), and persons self-identifying as Hispanic or living in Hispanic neighborhoods, and persons living
in the poorest neighborhoods were among the subgroups with the highest seroprevalence (25.9% (24.127.8%), 25.1% (23.6-26.4%), 24.8% (23.2-26.5%) respectively). Compared to data from July 2020, we
observed diminished variability in seroprevalence by geographic region and urban-rural status. Estimated
case detection rate increased from 14% to 23% in July 2020 to January 2021.
Conclusions: A year after the first case of SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected in the US, fewer than one
in four adults have evidence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Vaccine roll out to majority minority
neighborhoods and poorer neighborhoods will be critical to disrupting the spread of infection.

Funding: Ascend Clinical Laboratories funded remainder-plasma testing.

Introduction
In the year-long period since SARS-CoV-2 case was reported in the US, COVID-19 cases, deaths, and
hospitalizations overwhelmed health systems in the country. To date, more than 25 million cases and
500,000 deaths have been attributed to SARS-CoV-2 infection1,2. While in Spring 2020, the most intense
burden of disease was experienced in and around the state of New York, nearly all regions in the US
including rural areas have recently faced threats to their hospital capacity, with the largest numbers
accruing between November and December 20202.
Data continue to support that symptomatic cases represent a fraction of persons infected with SARS-CoV23. The vast majority of persons with infection, however, whether asymptomatic or symptomatic, do
mount a specific antibody response4-6, with the latest data indicating SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding
domain (RBD) IgG antibodies persist for at least four to six months after infection4,7,8. Thus,
seroprevalence estimates remain an essential measure of the extent of SARS-CoV-2 community spread.
Following our proposed strategy of performing repeated seroprevalence surveys among patients on
dialysis, a population broadly representative of groups susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and among
whom routine requirements for monthly laboratories facilitates surveillance9, we implemented a crosssectional seroprevalence analysis in a sample of 21,424 patients on dialysis in the US in January 2021.
Our goal was to assess SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence prior to widespread roll out of COVID19
vaccination. We also tested the persistence of previously observed differences in seroprevalence by
region, age, sex, race/ethnicity, and other community-level strata of interest including population density
and neighborhood poverty. Finally, to assess for improvements in diagnosis and treatment since our July
survey, we compared case detection attributed to COVID19 to our seroprevalence estimates at the July
2020 and January 2021 timepoints.

Methods
We replicated methods presented previously9, including the use of a highly sensitive and specific total
RBD total antibody assay on remnant plasma from routine monthly laboratory draws. The primary
difference was in the sample population. Previously, samples were obtained from multiple dialysis
networks and from patients residing in 46 states. The current sample derived from a single national
dialysis network, US Renal Care, the third largest dialysis center in the US with 518 facilities and from
patients residing in 43 states. We tested all patients (n=21424) within this single dialysis network in
preparation for a longitudinal study being conducted in this network to ascertain response to COVID19
vaccination.
The study received Institutional Review Board Approval from Stanford University.
Assay characteristics
In partnership with a commercial laboratory receiving routine monthly laboratories of patients on dialysis,
we tested the remnant plasma of all patients receiving dialysis through US Renal Care. We used the
Siemens RBD total antibody (Ig) chemiluminescence assay, which has 100% sensitivity (≥14 days post
+PCR test) and 99.8% specificity10.
Statistical analyses
We determined seroprevalence estimates and 95% confidence intervals for the crude (unweighted) sample
from January 2021. We then standardized seroprevalence estimates accounting for age, sex, and region,
using the distribution of the US dialysis population as available through the United States Renal Data
System11 and for the US adult population as available through the 2018 American Community Survey 1year estimates12. Next we examined differences in seroprevalence by the following strata: age, sex,
region, self-reported race/ethnicity, neighborhood race/ethnicity composition, neighborhood poverty, and
urban/rural status9.

We also compared data on differences in seroprevalence by patient and neighborhood characteristics and
region of residence strata to the observed differences in July 2020. To ensure accurate comparisons, we
limited the July 2020 sample to those obtained within US Renal Care (n=11,746 (41%) of 28,503 tested in
July,supplemental Table 1).
Finally, we compared case detection and infection fatality rates in July 2020 versus January 2021. We
computed case detection rates as the proportion of detected cases per 100,0002 from a denominator
totaling seroprevalence estimates per 100,000 (standardized to the US adult population) and deaths per
100,000 in January 1 2020-June 31 2020, and July 1 2020-December 31 2020 for the July 2020 and
January 2021 estimates respectively. We adjusted the numerator of detected cases to reflect adults only
using Centers for Disease Control data on proportion of overall cases occurring in adults (~92% in June
202013 and ~89% in December 202014). We computed the infection fatality rate as the proportion of
deaths per 100,000 from a denominator of seroprevalent persons per 100,000 in the corresponding time
periods.
Results
Of the 21,424 persons tested in the first week of January 2021, a majority were men and were older than
65 years of age, similar to the overall US dialysis population (Table 1). Although patients resided in a
total of 43 states, 33 states contributed >30 patients to the sample. Persons from the South and West
regions were modestly overrepresented. Neighborhood race/ethnicity composition closely matched the
US dialysis population. Compared to the US adult population, sampled patients were older, more likely
male, and more likely to be of non-white race and Hispanic ethnicity.
In January 2021, SARS-CoV-2 RBD seroprevalence estimates were 18.9% (95% CI 18.3, 19.5%) in the
sample, 18.7% (18.1, 19.2%) standardized to US dialysis, and 21.3% (20.3, 22.3%) standardized to US
adult population respectively (Table 2). Younger age groups (18-44 years), and persons self-identifying

as Hispanic or living in Hispanic neighborhoods, and persons living in the poorest neighborhoods were
among the subgroups with the highest seroprevalence.
We compared these values to observations from patients within the US Renal Care network tested in July
2020. In this subset in July, the sample, dialysis adjusted and US population adjusted seroprevalence rates
were 4.4 (4.0, 4.8), 4.7 (4.3, 5.2), and 5.4 (4.6, 6.2), respectively (supplemental Table 2). Relative to
July, January 2021 seroprevalences were 2-fold, 4-fold, and 5-fold higher in the Northeast, Midwest, and
South and West respectively (Figure 1). Regional and rural vs. urban seroprevalences varied less than
previously (supplemental Figure 1), but striking differences remained by race/ethnicity and poverty.
Seroprevalence was 1·7-fold (95% CI 1·6, 1·9) higher among persons living in majority-Hispanic
compared to majority-white neighborhoods, and 2·0-fold (95% CI 1·8, 2·3) higher among persons living
in neighborhoods with ≥ 30% versus <10% of residents living in poverty (Figure 2).
Discussion
In a January, 2021 nationwide surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among patients on dialysis,
we found that, despite national surges in cases and almost half a million deaths, fewer than one in four US
adults had evidence of SARS-CoV-2 antibody. Compared to July 2020, spread of SARS-CoV-2
throughout the US became more uniform across geographic regions, and urban and rural areas. The
largest differences in seroprevalences occurred between younger and older age groups, residents of
majority Hispanic versus majority white neighborhoods, and residents of poorer versus more affluent
neighborhoods. Case detection improved but close to three in four cases remained undiagnosed. Our data
emphasize the critical need for prompt, wide-spread vaccination, and ongoing mitigation efforts since on
the basis of this seroprevalence evaluation, much of the population still remains vulnerable to SARSCoV-2 infection.
Few up-to-date data exist on SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence from countries with high numbers of cases and
deaths from COVID19. In the US, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) implemented a large and

geographically diverse longitudinal sero-surveillance using repeated commercial laboratory testing. Our
July seroprevalence estimates were in line with those reported using the CDC strategy.15 The latest
available data from the CDC, however, are from November 2020, prior to the largest surge of cases in the
US. Outside of the US, India performed over 15000 home visits in 700 communities testing 29,000
people with plasma nucleocapsid IgG testing between August and September 2020 and estimated
seroprevalence of 7% among adults, at a time when the country had recorded roughly six million cases 16.
In the UK, the Real-time assessment of Community Transmission (REACT) study mailed lateral flow
immunoassays to randomly selected UK residents17,18. This ongoing study has a wide reach (over 350,000
participants reached by fall 2020), amenable to repeat serosurveillance. In the last iteration prior to
vaccine roll out, the authors observed a decline in seroprevalence over time possibly due to rapid decay in
the qualitative measure of anti-Spike antibody, limiting the study’s ability to estimate overall infection
rates in the UK17. Brazilian investigators using blood donor samples in Manaus, Brazil, created a
seroprevalence model that incorporated a parameter for antibody decay. Using this strategy, they
concluded that 75% in Manaus had been infected by October 2020.19 A later surge of infections in
Manaus, however, has raised questions about model assumptions20.
Ease of replication, unbiased sampling, and high-quality immunoassays—all features of national dialysis
sampling-are crucial to rapid and informative seroprevalence. Nonetheless, our strategy may also have
modestly underestimated SARS-CoV-2 cumulative infections for two reasons. First, SARS-CoV-2
antibodies may wane over time. Several large studies, however, including our own performed in this
population, indicate that the RBD domain antibody typically persists for at least 4-6 months4,5, longer than
the nucleocapsid assays used in other seroprevalence studies16,19. Second, our current sample
underrepresents New York City, a high-risk area, perhaps contributing to a lower seroprevalence than
might be otherwise expected in the Northeast region.
Our data reliably assess differences in seroprevalence by patient and community-level characteristics over
time. We note the rapid spread of the infection throughout the breadth of the US. Whereas in July 2020

seroprevalence rates varied from <1 to 34%, in January 2021, nearly all sampled states had
seroprevalence estimates exceeding 10% and among the four regions, the range of seroprevalence was
narrow (15-21%). These trends fit with other descriptions of the pandemic, for example in Brazil, where
international travel first brought the pandemic to major cities with rapid spread in densely populated
areas, but eventual spread occurred throughout the country21.
Our estimates for case detection and infection fatality—with infection fatality exceeding 1% in the
Northeast after the first wave in the Spring—match modeled estimates by Yang et al.22 The improvement
in both parameters since then indicate better detection and treatment, and are generally uniformly spread
throughout the US.
Strengths of our study include its unbiased sampling of hard-to-reach populations, reflective of persons
most vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, and the use of a highly specific and sensitive assay for an antibody for
which data indicate a prolonged persistence in a majority of infected persons4,5,23. This pragmatic
approach enables rapid and repeated evaluations. The limitations include lack of data on SARS-CoV-2
rtPCR testing or COVID19 symptoms, and relative under-sampling from the Northeast region.
In summary, using unbiased data from a sentinel population, we estimate that fewer than one in four
persons in the US had evidence of SARS-CoV-2 antibody in January 2021, well below the level needed
to confer herd immunity. Residents of majority minority and poorer neighborhoods, and younger age
groups have substantially higher prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Since these sub-populations
overlap with persons expressing high levels of vaccine hesitancy in the US24,25, vaccination campaigns
will need to engage these high-risk groups in order to achieve sufficient penetration to reach communitylevel protection against SARS-CoV-2.

Figure Legends:
Figure 1: SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence by US region in January 2021, with comparison to sampled
states between July 2020
Overall seroprevalence was between 15-21% across all regions, with the highest seroprevalence in the
US South. Compared to July data from patients dialyzing in the same dialysis facilities,
seroprevalence was 1.8-fold (95% CI 1.5, 2.3) higher in the Northeast, 4.1-fold (95% CI 3.0, 5.7)
higher in the Midwest and 4.6-fold (95% CI 3.9, 5.5) higher in the West. The largest increase in
seroprevalence was observed in the South (5.1-fold (95% CI 4.5, 5.8)). All 43 states in which patients
resided are listed in the figure but data are presented only for states with at least 30 persons in the
January sample (n=33).
Figure 2: Case detection and infection fatality rates in January 2021, with comparison to July 2020
The detected cases per 100,000 between June-December 2020 were 23% of estimated seroprevalent
persons and deaths attributed to COVID19 in January 2021 (range by region 17-30% in the Northeast
and Midwest respectively). This proportion was an increase from detected cases being 14% of
estimated seroprevalent persons and deaths attributed to COVID19 in July 2020 (range by region
13% to 16% in the West and Midwest respectively). The infection fatality rate in January 2021 was
0.3% (range 0.3-0.4%), compared with 0.7% in July 2020 (range 0.4-1.3%).
