The ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute

22

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been a public health emergency of international

that other routes of infection may exist. Monitoring SARS-CoV-2 genomes in wastewaters has been

26

proposed as a complementary approach for tracing the dynamics of virus transmission within human

27

population connected to wastewater network. The understanding on SARS-CoV-2 transmission

28

through wastewater surveillance, the development of epidemic modeling and the evaluation of SARS-

29

CoV-2 transmission from contaminated wastewater are largely limited by our knowledge on viral RNA

30

genome persistence and virus infectivity preservation in such an environment. Using an integrity based

31

RT-qPCR assay this study led to the discovery that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can persist under several forms in

32

wastewaters, which provides important information on the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in raw

33

wastewaters and associated risk assessment.

Introduction

39

Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to coronaviridae, a large family of enveloped single-stranded positive

40

RNA viruses. CoVs are usually considered as moderate pathogens for humans. Four of them (229E,

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.19.20248508; this version posted December 22, 2020. The copyright holder for this

41

NL63, OC43, HKU1) are responsible for seasonnal common cold or mild respiratory infections.

42

However, three novel and highly pathogenic CoVs recently emerged in human population causing

43

severe zoonotic diseases i.e. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)(Peiris et al., 2003), Middle

44

East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)(Zaki et al., 2012) and more recently COronaVIrus Disease-19

45

(COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19(Huang et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020; Zhu

46

et al., 2020), is responsible for a pandemia that caused at least 67 million cases and more than 1.5

47

million deaths so far (John Hopkins university data by december 7th, 2020). Although SARS-CoV-2

48

transmission mainly occurs by direct transmission through inhalation of contaminated respiratory

49

droplets or through contaminated aerosols or surfaces(WHO, n.d.), the potential for alternative

50

transmission pathway should not be underestimated. Indeed, large amounts of viral RNA have been

51

identified in human stools from infected patients presenting with severe COVID-19 symptoms which

52

occasionaly led to the isolation of infectious virus from feces(Chen et al., 2020; Holshue et al., 2020;

53

Huang et al., 2020; Lescure et al., 2020; Pan et al., 2020a; Tang et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Wölfel

54

et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020; Xiao et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). SARS-CoV-2 can also be detected in

55

stools from asymptomatic carriers with a largely unknown prevalence(Tang et al., 2020). This likely

56

reflects SARS-CoV-2 replication in the gut(Luz et al., 2020). Accordingly high level of viral RNA have

57

been detected in wastewaters in different countries and potential cases of transmission via

58

wastewater have been reported(Yeo et al., 2020a; Yuan et al., 2020). In addition to the risk of exposure

59

for sewage workers, wastewaters containing potentially infectious SARS-CoV-2 may enter the aquatic

60

environment via wastewater discharge thus potentially resulting in pollution of surface waters (Kumar

61

et al., 2020; Naddeo and Liu, 2020; Rimoldi et al., 2020; Wurtzer et al., 2020a)and to a lesser extent

62

groundwaters. Such a pollution could locally affect the quality of water ressources used for the

63

production of water intended to human consumption. Moreover, the persistence of infectious virus in

64

treated effluents of wastewater treatment plant could cause problems for agricultural activities

65

through the reuse of treated wastewater or the spreading of sludge(Balboa et al., 2020). Consequently,

66

the contamination of wastewater by SARS-CoV-2 raises the same concerns as human seasonal enteric

67

viruses(Okoh et al., 2010).

68

The monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in raw wastewater was successfully used for estimating the

69

dynamics of viral pandemic in population linked to a wastewater network(Medema et al., 2020;

70

Nemudryi, n.d.; Randazzo et al., 2020; Wurtzer et al., 2020b). However many questions remain to be

71

answered to better assess the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through wastewaters(Elsamadony et

72

al., 2021; Lodder and de Roda Husman, 2020). Indeed RT-qPCR protocoles that are currently used can

73

not distinguish between partial or full-length, virion associated or free viral genomes(Prevost et al.,

74

2016). It is commonly admitted that enveloped viruses are less persistent in hydric matrices and less

75

resistant to inactivation treatments than naked viruses(WHO, n.d.). Gundy and collaborators showed

76

that human seasonal coronavirus survival in tap water and wastewater was strongly reduced

77

compared to poliovirus. The survival ranged from days to weeks depending on the surrogate virus,

78

type of water and temperature(Casanova et al., 2009; Casanova and Weaver, 2015; Gundy et al., 2009).

79

An experimental study showed that SARS-CoV-1 stability under an infectious form was only 2 days at

80

20 °C, but 14 days at 4 °C(Wang et al., 2005). So far only a few studies investigated SARS-CoV-2 stability

81

on solid surfaces(Chin et al., 2020; van Doremalen et al., 2020) or in water matrix(Bivins et al., 2020).

82

If the decay of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity appears to be different according to the nature of matrix, these

83

few studies agreed on the sensitivity to heat. Moreover they suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could be more

84

persistent than other coronaviruses (seasonal and epidemic CoV) and more resistant to harsh

85

condition(Aboubakr et al., 2020; van Doremalen et al., 2020). Conversely risk assessment for SARS-

86

CoV-2 was mainly based on results obtained for other coronaviruses or for SARS-CoV-2 surrogates

87

(enteric viruses or bacteriophage indicators)(Rosa et al., 2020; Silverman and Boehm, 2020; Ye et al.,

88

2016). So far, despite the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in raw wastewaters, no infectious virus was

89

isolated from the same samples, suggesting that the detection of viral RNA overestimated the risk of

90

infection(Rimoldi et al., 2020).

91

The present work intended to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 stability both under an infectious form or by

92

quantifying viral RNA in wastewaters. We first demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be quantified

93

without significant loss in wastewaters samples for up to 7 days at 4°C or 20°C, suggesting that viral

94

RNA is largely protected from environnemental degradation. This led us to combine cell culture

95

isolation and integrity based RT-qPCR assay to investigate the status of viral RNA in wastewater

96

samples(Prevost et al., 2016). We propose that SARS-CoV-2 genomes can exist under three different

97

states at least: genomic RNA protected within an infectious particle, genomic RNA protected in a non-

98

infectious structure, free total or partial genomic RNA. SARS-CoV-2 persistence and integrity were

99

compared to an enteric virus – Coxsackievirus B5 – that is commonly found in feces and wastewater.

100

The analysis of 87 raw wastewater samples collected from April to July 2020 in Paris area confirmed

101

that total viral RNA can be detected under both a protected and an unprotected form.

Material and methods

104

Virus stock preparation

105

Coxsackievirus B5 (CV-B5) was cultivated on confluent monolayer cultures of Buffalo Green Monkey

106

kidney (BGMK) cells at 37°C with 5% CO2. Cells were grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium

107

(DMEM) high glucose (Dutscher) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum (PanBiotech), non-

108

essential amino acids (Dutscher), penicillin (100 U/ml) and streptomycin (100 µg/ml) (PanBiotech). The

109

supernatant was clarified by centrifugation at 2,000 x g for 15 min, then ultracentrifuged at 150,000 x

110

g at 4 °C for 2 hours through a 40 % sucrose cushion. The pellet was resuspended in 1x phosphate-

111

buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.4. Further purification was performed by ultracentrifugation on cesium

112

chloride gradient at 100,000 x g for 18 hours. The fraction containing the viruses was desalted with

113

Vivaspin 20 (Sartorius) concentrators according the manufacturer’s recommandations. Viruses were

114

stored at - 80 °C before using.

Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in raw wastewater

124

Raw wastewater samples were homogenized, then 11 ml were centrifugated at 200 000 x g for 1 hour

125

at +4°C using a XPN80 Coulter Beckman ultracentrifuge equipped with a swing rotor (SW41Ti). Viral

126

pellets were resuspended in 200 μL of PBS 1X buffer as previsouly described by Wurtzer & al.

Spiking assays

129

Five raw wastewater samples were collected in july 2020 in different WWTP and scored negative for

130

SARS-CoV-2 and enterovirus genome. These <24h old samples were centrifugated at 4,000 xg for 15

131

min for removing the largest particles and supernatants were filtred on membrane with 0,45µm

132

porosity. The filtrates were stored at +4°C and used within the following 24h.

133

CV-B5 or SARS-CoV-2 were spiked in the filtrated samples. Virus titration was immediately done after

134

spiking or after incubation at 4°C or 20°C for the indicated period of time. As a control, spiking

135

experiments were done in DMEM. Virus infectivity, virus integrity and viral RNA detection were

136

assessed after incubation by endpoint dilution assay, PMAxx-RT-qPCR and RT-qPCR respectively.

Virus quantification by endpoint dilution assay

139

Infectious viruses (CV-B5 and SARS-CoV-2) were titrated by standard 10-fold dilutions in 96-well plates

140

on VERO E6 cells (ATCC® CRL-1586™) (105 cells per well), with twelve replicates per dilution. After a 6-

141

day incubation, cytopathic effects were observed and positive wells were counted. Viral titer was

142

estimated using the Spearman-Kärber method. The results are expressed as 50% tissue culture

143

infective dose (TCID50) per ml.

144
145

Virus integrity Assay

146

Each sample was mixed with Propidium monoazide (PMAxx), an intercalating dyes that binds only to

147

free accessible sites within nucleic acids and after photoactivation, making them unable to be amplified

148

by RT-qPCR. Briefly PMAxx was added at 100 µM final concentration. The samples were incubated on

149

ice in the dark for 30 min and then photoactivated at using PhastBlue system (GenIUL, Spain) for 15

150

min. Samples were extracted as follow.

Extracted nucleic acids were filtered through OneStep PCR inhibitor removal kit (Zymoresearch)

162

according the manufacturer’s instructions for handling larger volumes.

164

Viral RNA titration

165

The RT-qPCR primers and PCR conditions used herein have been previously described(Corman et al.,

166

2020). The amplification was done using Fast virus 1-step Master mix 4x (Lifetechnologies). Detection

167

and quantification were carried on the gene E by RT-qPCR. Positive results were confirmed by

168

amplification of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and nucleoprotein genes. An internal

169

positive control (IPC) was added to evaluate the presence of residual inhibitors. The IPC consists in a

170

plasmid containing beta-acting gene flanked by enterovirus-specific primers(Wurtzer et al., 2014). The

171

detection limit was estimated to be around 10 genome units per amplification reaction.

172

The quantification was performed using a standard curve based on full-length amplicon cloned into

173

pCR2.1 plasmid (Invitrogen, #452640). Amplification reaction and fluorescence detection were

174

performed on Viia7 Real Time PCR system (Lifetechnologies).

175
176

Statistical analysis and plots

177

All statistical analysis and plots were done using GraphPad Prism 9.0 software. For comparison based

178

on spiked samples (figure 2), the quantifications were compared between the different conditions

179

using one-way ANOVA and Tukey's multiple comparisons test. Comparisons between total vRNA and

180

protected RNA (figure 4A) were performed using Wilcoxson matched-pair test and comparisons of

181

ratio pRNA/vRNA (figure 4B) were tested using Kruskal-Wallis test and Dunn's multiple comparisons

182

test.

185

Stability of total viral RNA (vRNA) in wastewater samples

186

The quantification of SARS-CoV-2 genome in wastewater has been proposed as an alternative strategy

187

to monitor the dynamics of pandemic SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, this approach is highly dependent

188

on the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewaters. In addition, it is of upmost importance to

189

provide convenient tools to distinguish free viral RNA and virion-associated RNA as a first approach to

190

evaluate the concentration of infectious virus particle in matrix from which SARS-CoV-2 is technically

191

difficult to isolate, such as stools or wastewaters. Since viral genomes are protected by viral proteins

192

and surrounded by a cell-derived enveloped in infectious particles, we assumed that we could

193

distinguish between free and protected viral genomes using an integrity RT-qPCR based assay.

194

Briefly, two 1L-raw wastewater samples were collected by the 3rd (sample S1) and the 7th (sample S2)

195

of april 2020 in Greater Paris area, a period when SARS-CoV-2 genomes were easily detected(Wurtzer

196

et al., 2020b). Samples were analyzed less than 24h after the time of the sampling (day 0). The rest of

197

each sample was split into 2 parts and stored at +4°C or +20°C for 10 days and 12 days respectively.

198

Total SARS-Cov-2 viral RNA (vRNA) and protected viral RNA (pRNA) were quantified by RT-qPCR. As

199

shown on figure 1, less than 10 % of the total viral RNA was under a protected form. SARS-CoV-2 vRNA

200

and pRNA concentrations were relatively stable for 7 (S1) and 12 (S2) days respectively at +4°C while

201

they were slighly less stable when stored at +20°C.

202
203

Comparing coxsackievirus B5 and SARS-CoV-2 persistence in raw wastewater

204

Infectious enteric virus such as coxsackievirus B5 are commonly found in wastewaters, but the ability

205

of enveloped virus, like SARS-CoV-2, to persist under an infectious form is still debated. To address this

206

question the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in raw wastewater was compared to that of coxsackievirus B5

207

(CV-B5) using three different indicators namely the quantification of total RNA (vRNA), protected viral

208

RNA (pRNA) and infectious particles (TCID50). Five raw wastewater samples, that were negative for

209

SARS-CoV-2 and enterovirus genome by RT-qPCR (data not shown) were used. The detection of

210

infectious virus, vRNA and pRNA was performed after spiking each sample with infectious SARS-CoV-2

211

or CV-B5.

212

CV-B5 vRNA and pRNA were quantified at similar concentrations in raw wastewaters (WW) or in cell

213

culture medium (DMEM) when analysis was done immediately after spiking (control) or after 24h-

214

incubation à +4°C or +20°C (figure 2A, 2B). This result was expected since CV-B5 particles were purified

215

to homogeneity on sucrose gradient, which efficiently separates encapsidated RNA from free RNA.

216

Infectivity of CV-B5 was not significantly altered after 24h-incubation at +4°C, while it only sightly

217

decreased (<1-log) after a 24-incubation at +20°C (figure 2C). One WW samples dramatically affected

218

the virus infectivity (>2-log). Strikingly, pRNA was only 10% of total vRNA for SARS-CoV-2 suggesting

219

that unpurified SARS-CoV-2 preparation contains only a minor part of intact particles. This result was

220

further confirmed by the relatively low level of infectivity of the viral stock (figure 2C). As before pRNA

221

was highly stable whereas total SARS-CoV-2 total vRNA partly decreased over time in all conditions

222

(figure 2D and 2E). As importantly SARS-CoV-2 infectivity was strongly (>3-log) or moderately reduced

223

in 3 out of 5 WW samples and 2 over 5 samples respectively. The decrease in TCID50 was about 1-log

224

in all samples after a 24h-incubation at +4°C. Since no similar observation was made on samples

225

containing DMEM, this suggested that SARS-CoV-2 infectivity is strongly reduced in wastewaters likely

226

depending of their chemical and/or microbial composition (figure 2F).

227
228

Temperature-based inactivation unrevealed different status for viral RNA

229

Temperature is known to affect viruses in the environment albeit to very different extent(Bertrand et

230

al., 2012). Heat inactivation is commonly used for studying virus survival in water. In low temperature

231

range (<50°C), the inactivation of naked viruses mainly comes from the denaturation of capsids

232

(Waldman et al., 2020, 2017). However little is known concerning enveloped viruses. Therefore, we

233

intended to evaluate more precisely the effect of temperature on SARS-CoV-2 using CV-B5 as a control.

234

For this purpose, we first exposed samples spiked with infectious SARS-CoV-2 and CV-B5 to increasing

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.19.20248508; this version posted December 22, 2020. The copyright holder for this

235

temperature for 10 minutes. Then we evaluated the effect of the treatment on infectious particles or

236

total RNA stability (vRNA). Viral genome protection was evaluated as before by an integrity RT-qPCR

237

based assay (pRNA).

238

CV-B5 infectiosity was preserved up to 42°C and then dramatically decreased up to 70°C, as previously

239

described by Waldman and co-authors(Waldman et al., 2017). pRNA and vRNA were stable up to 50

240

and 70°C respectively in culture medium, although RNA integrity significantly decreased at a lower

241

temperature in wastewater (figure 3 A).

242

In the same conditions, SARS-CoV-2 viability was not significantly affected until 42°C. A marked

243

reduction in infectiosity was observed both in wastewaters and culture medium that was not related

244

with a decrease in vRNA nor pRNA (figure 3 B). In both culture medium and wastewater samples,

245

reduction of vRNA paralleled pRNA reduction although reduction in vRNA and pRNA was stronger in

246

wastewater sample.

247

Altogether, these experiments indicated that SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes could exist under three

248

different forms at least: protected within infectious particles, protected within non-infectious particles

249

or in a ribonucleoprotein complex and as free/unprotected viral RNA.

250
251

Estimating the relative proportion of protected vs unprotected SARS-CoV-2 genomes in raw

252

wastewater

253

Total and protected viral RNA were quantified in 87 raw wastewater samples that were collected from

254

April to July 2020 in Greater Paris area. vRNA and pRNA concentrations ranged from 1.4x103 to 5.2x106

Discussion

264

Wastewater-based epidemiology has been widely used over the world for monitoring the spreading of

265

SARS-CoV-2(Medema et al., 2020; Randazzo et al., 2020; Wurtzer et al., 2020b) in human populations

266

as well as other waterborn viruses such as poliovirus (WHO, 2003) and other enteric viruses(Prevost

267

et al., 2015). A large panel of methods has been developed with various performances. SARS-CoV-2 is

268

detected in feces of about 50% of infected people, mainly with no or moderate symptoms(Lescure et

269

al., 2020; Pan et al., 2020b; Tang et al., 2020). It has been proposed that the presence of SARS-CoV-2

270

genomes in raw wastewater could reflect the virus excreted by infected people, whether they are

271

symptomatic or not. It is of upmost importance to confirm this assumption in order to propose

272

mathematical models that could correlate viral load in wastewaters with other individual

273

epidemiological parameters. Modeling viral dynamics greatly depends on the quality of the analysis,

274

but also on the half-life of total viral RNA in raw wastewater. In this study, we showed that total viral

275

RNA (vRNA) concentration in raw wastewater was stable for at least 7 days provided that the samples

276

were stored at +4°C until analysis, which is in agreement with previous work(Bivins et al., 2020).

277

Importantly, freezing water samples had a negative impact on the relevance of the measurment (data

278

not shown), at least in our protocol. Such a delay is important to be taken into consideration to

279

organize campains from the sampling to the analysis, including transportation to specialized

280

laboratories. Although our study was performed on a limited number of samples, the results suggested

281

that vRNA concentration was not dramatically affected by the composition of wastewater samples

282

over 24h-incubation time, a period of time that is compatible with the travel of the viral genomes from

283

emission of human faeces to raw wastewater sampling at the inlet of WWTP. As importantly SARS-

284

CoV-2 vRNA detection was unaffected in a range of temperature comprised between +4°C and at least

285

40°C. Altogether these results suggested that the measurement of SARS-CoV-2 vRNA concentration in

286

wastewater is a relevant indicator of the effective level of the viral genomes excreted by infected

287

people that is only moedartely affected by temperature and travel time.

288

The detection of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in stools and subsequently in wastewaters raises several other

289

important concerns concerning the risk of transmission. RT-qPCR assays have been designed to detect

290

specific regions of the viral genomes whatever the quantified RNA is extracted from infectious particle

291

or not. Therefore, these approaches provide an obvious overestimate of the effective concentration

292

of infectious viral particles within stools and wastewaters. Even though sewage is an unsanitary

293

environment for many reasons, sewers and operators of wastewater treatment plant worried about

294

the occupational risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2. As recently underlined by WHO(WHO, n.d.), SARS-

295

CoV-2 is a respiratory virus whose main routes of transmission are respiratory (inhalation of

296

contaminated dropplets) and contact (with contaminated surfaces). However, if SARS-CoV-2 infection

297

via contaminated wastewater was not unambiguously demonstrated, this possibility cannot be ruled

298

out(Yeo et al., 2020b). To that respect, let us note that genetic evidences and case clustering led Yuan

299

and coworkers to suggest that sewage may be a possible transmission vehicle for SARS-CoV-2(Gormley,

300

2020; Kang et al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2020). Enveloped viruses were commonly thought to be less

301

resistant than naked virus. Due to the possible presence of detergent and other chemical agents that

302

may degrade viral envelop, raw wastewater might be highly detrimental to the persistence of

303

infectious SARS-Cov2 particles. Trials have been done unsuccessfully in order to isolate and cultivate

304

SARS-CoV-2 from fresh wastewater samples(Rimoldi et al., 2020), meaning that SARS-CoV-2 might be

305

simply non-infectious, or that cell culture system was not adapted for such highly chemically or

306

microbiologically contaminated samples(Cashdollar and Wymer, 2013). Efforts for concentrating and

307

isolating infectious viruses from hydric environment are usually successful for naked virus that are less

308

sensitive to chemicals. In this study, infectious SARS-CoV-2 was spiked in negative wastewater samples

309

and viable viruses were quantified up to 24 hours, without pretreatment of sample before cultivation.

310

Whereas such an exposure only midly affected coxsackievirus B5 viability, SARS-CoV-2 infectivity was

311

clearly affected at 20°C depending on the nature of the sample. These results are in agreement with

312

previous work(Bivins et al., 2020). We brought here additional evidences that sample temperature had

313

a strong impact on virus viability since the SARS-CoV-2 infectivity was not significantly modified at +4°C

314

for 24h whereas it is slightly affected at 20°C. Both viruses infectivity was fully preserved up to 42°C

315

for shorter incubation times (10 min). In all conditions, infectious virus persisted up to 24 hours at least

316

in wastewater samples. Previous studies reported that infectious SARS-CoV-2 could persist for up to

317

28 days on various supports (glass, plastic or stainless steel for example) (Riddell et al., 2020; van

318

Doremalen et al., 2020). An effect of temperature on viral infectivity was already reported when virus

319

was adsorbed on solid surfaces(Riddell et al., 2020) or in transportation medium(Chin et al., 2020).

320

More recently Bivins and collaborators brought first elements to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 viability in

321

wastewaters and provided evidences that SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA persisted for longer period of time

322

than infectious particles(Bivins et al., 2020).

323

The present study confirmed that evaluating total vRNA widely overestimated the number of

324

infectious particles within wastewaters. Nevertheless, the relatively long persistence of SARS-CoV-2

325

genomes was surprising with regards to its supposed fragility compared to surrogates. Whether the

326

regions that are amplified by RT-qPCR came from total or partial genomes cannot be assessed by such

327

assays. A tool for assessing the integrity of naked virus particles already showed that genome of naked

328

RNA viruses can be protected from degradation by the capsid, a structure that remains non-permeable

329

to intercalating dye. Our comparative study on SARS-CoV-2 and CV-B5 demonstrated that viral

330

genomes can be found in multiple states i.e. infectious protected, non-infectious protected and

331

unprotected forms. Unpublished data showed that such dyes (Ethidium monoazide or propidium

332

monoazide) targeted secondary structures within single stranded RNA (hairpins or IRES for

333

picornaviruses)(Wurtzer et al., 2018). In addition previous study showed that capsid integrity is lost at

334

42°C for CV-B5, with a maximum access of SyBR green II to viral RNA at 50°C(Waldman et al., 2017). In

335

the case of coronaviruses, a lipid layer protects the RNA genome that is closely associated to

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.19.20248508; this version posted December 22, 2020. The copyright holder for this

336

nucleoproteins. The lipid layer is probably very labile in wastewater, which may contain detergent

337

residues for example, and unstable at high temperature. Nonetheless integrity measurments showed

338

that vRNA remained protected from intercalating dye up to 70°C-incubation. These results suggested

339

other structures such as viral nucleoproteins may limit access of the dye to SARS-CoV-2 RNA, in

340

addition to the viral envelop. It is to note that SARS-CoV-2 and CV-B5 shared a similar profil of

341

sensitivity to temperature, although SARS-CoV-2 genome appeared to be better protected than CV-B5

342

genomes. This assay was used on a large panel of samples, confirming that less than 30% of the viral

343

genomes on the average were under a protected form in wastewater samples. Considering that

344

infectious particles correspond only to a subfraction of protected genomes, as illustrated by spiking

345

experiments, it can be considered that risk assement for viral infection through wastewaters should

346

be better evaluated using an integrity based assay if systematic cell culture isolation cannot be done.

347

Such a technique could also be used to evaluate the relative fraction of protected genomes in other

348

matrix such as in sputums or stools of infected patients or for other enveloped viruses, such as

349

influenza virus(Chan et al., 2009; Hirose, 2016).
