Abstract
Background: The economic and reproductive medicine response to the COVID-19 pandemic
in the United States has reduced the affordability and accessibility of fertility care. We sought
to determine the impact of the 2008 financial recession and the COVID-19 recession on fertility
treatments and cumulative live-births.
Methods: We examined annual US natality, CDC IVF cycle activity and live birth data from
1999 to 2018 encompassing 3,286,349 treatment cycles, to estimate the age-stratified reduction
in IVF cycles undertaken after the 2008 financial recession, with forward quantitative
modelling of IVF cycle activity and cumulative live-births for 2020 to 2023.
Results: The financial recession of 2008 caused a four-year plateau in fertility treatments
with a predicted 53,026 (95% CI 49,581 to 56,471) fewer IVF cycles and 16,872
(95% CI 16,713 to 17,031) fewer live births. A similar scale of economic recession would
cause 67,386 (95% CI: 61,686 to 73,086) fewer IVF cycles between 2020 and 2023, with
women younger than 35 years overall undertaking 22,504 (95% CI 14,320 to 30,690) fewer
cycles, as compared to 4,445 (95% CI 3,144 to 5749) fewer cycles in women over the age of
40 years. This equates to overall 25,143 (95% CI: 22,408 to 27,877) fewer predicted livebirths from IVF, of which only 490 (95% CI 381 to 601) are anticipated to occur in women
over the age of 40 years.
Conclusions: The COVID-19 recession could have a profound impact on US IVF live-birth
rates in young women, further aggravating pre-existing declines in total fertility rates.

Introduction
Affordability and availability of treatment are two of the most important factors affecting a
couple’s decision to pursue in vitro fertilization (IVF). The emergence of COVID-19 as a risk
to public health, and the resulting economic impact, affects both the affordability and
availability of treatment. On March 17, 2020, the American Society for Reproductive
Medicine (ASRM) recommended suspension of initiation of IVF treatments1. At least 85% of
IVF clinics followed the recommendations and shut down provision of routine care. On April
24, the ASRM Task Force recommended “gradually and judiciously resuming the delivery of
reproductive care”, with sequential updates reiterating this position given the dynamic
situation.

Prior to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, the US unemployment rate was at a historic low of
3.7% (5.7 million), and the economy at a peak2. With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic,
there was a dramatic rise in temporary unemployment peaking at 23.1 million in April 2020.
However, despite a gradual decline to 17.8 million by June 2020, this has been accompanied
by a rise in the number of permanent job losses to 2.9 million (Bureau of Labour Statistics
July 2, 2020)3. In the developed world there is a pro-cyclical relationship between economic
growth and fertility, and in times of economic recession the birth rate drops4. This was most
recently observed after the 2008 financial crisis, where US birth rates declined and an
estimated 2.3 million fewer births occurred between 2008 and 20135. Clearly, economic
hardship affects the affordability of having children and the decision to postpone is a
potentially viable option for young women who have a longer fertility horizon4. For couples
considering IVF, postponement incurs the penalty of an age-related declines in success6,
while economic hardship additionally affects the affordability of treatment.

Reassuringly the COVID-19 related temporary closure of IVF units and accompanying
treatment delays is anticipated to have limited impact on live-birth rates7. However, the
impact of COVID-19 economic recession on IVF live births is unknown. Indeed, we are not
aware of any prior publications regarding the impact of economic recessions on the use of
IVF. COVID-19 additionally carries a direct health effect, fear of transmission, and fear of
the unknown regarding pregnancy during a pandemic. The aim of this study is to examine the
effect of the 2008 recession on IVF cycles and predict what impact the COVID-19 related
economic recession and additional impact of clinic closures will have on the number of IVF
cycles and live-births in the US.

Methods
Data sources
The Fertility Clinic Success Rate and Certification Act of 1992 requires that all assisted
reproductive technology (ART) cycles performed in the United States are reported to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Fertility clinics submit data to the CDC
through the National ART Surveillance System (NASS) reporting system or an approved
alternative compliant with federal reporting requirements. The CDC conducts data validation
through yearly audits and site visits. The CDC has published Assisted Reproductive
Technology Fertility Clinic Success Rates Reports detailing activity levels at an individual
clinic level annually since 1997.

The Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology (SART), an organization of ART
providers affiliated with the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM), has been
collecting data and publishing annual reports of pregnancy success rates for fertility clinics in

the United States and Canada since 1989. In 2017, of all the ART clinics reporting data to
CDC, 82% were SART members.

Population comparison data was obtained from the 1999 to 2018 U.S. Natality files (Birth
Cohort dataset) compiled annually by the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics
(NCHS). The NCHS provides information on 99% of all registered births each year in the
United States.

Definitions
We defined ART procedures as per the CDC, as all treatments or procedures that include the
handling of human eggs or embryos to help a woman become pregnant. We defined a cycle
of IVF as commencement of ovarian stimulation, or monitoring, with the intent of having an
oocyte retrieval. This definition has been used by SART since 2014 and the CDC since 2017.
This definition incorporates ovarian stimulation cycles which are cancelled, pre-implantation
genetic testing is undertaken, or all embryos are frozen. For SART data before 2014 and
CDC data from 1999 to 2016 a cycle was defined as “Fresh Embryos from Nondonor Eggs”
(Table S1). Due to the different cycle definition used by the CDC for 2014 to 2016 (Table
S2), an age-stratified multiplication value was derived using the aligned 2017 and 2018
SART and CDC records (Table S3), and applied to the CDC data for 2014 to 2016. The
results from data transformation using the multiplication factor are presented in Table S4.

We defined a live-birth as delivery of one or more infants with any signs of life. The
cumulative live-birth rate was defined as the probability of a live-birth from an ovarian
stimulation encompassing all subsequent fresh and frozen embryo transfers from that

stimulation. The total number of infants born allowing for multiples was determined from the
annual Natality files and CDC ART reports (Table S5).

Age is the most important predictor of live birth following IVF treatment. We therefore
stratified our analyses by age, using age categories consistent with the CDC and SART: less
than 35 years, 35-37 years, 38-40 years, 41-42 years, more than 42 years.

Quantitative modelling on cycle activity
A quantitative prediction model was built using CDC data from 1999 to 2008, with four years
onward prediction for 2009 to 2012. The predicted clinical activity was compared to the
observed clinical activity after the 2008 financial recession and the percentage reduction in
activity for each age category calculated (Table S7, S8).

A similar quantitative model was built to predict age-stratified cycle starts for 2020 to 2023,
using baseline data from 2014 to 2018. We then applied the same percentage reduction in
activity observed after 2008 to the period 2020 to 2023, for each age category (Table S9).
This assumes that the impact of COVID -19 on cycle activity equates to a reduction like that
observed after the 2008 financial recession. As sensitivity analyses, we modelled a less
severe economic decline for the impact of COVID-19, by reducing the percentage reduction
in activity by a factor of 0.5, and a more severe decline by increasing it by a factor of 0.5.

Impact of reduction in activity on live births
For the period 2009 to 2012 we multiplied the predicted cycle activity by the age-stratified
cumulative live-birth rates as reported by the CDC in each of the respective annual ART

Success Rates Reports. This predicted number of live-births for 2009 to 2012 was then
compared to the observed live-births in the CDC ART annual reports.

For the period 2020 to 2023 we multiplied the different levels of predicted cycle activity (no
recession, recession equivalent to 2008, less and more severe recession) by the age-stratified
cumulative live birth rates reported in the most recent annual CDC 2018 report3. This details
the cumulative live-birth rates from 135,673 stimulation cycles undertaken by the 448 clinics
in the USA that were commenced between January 1, 2017 and December 31, 2017, with
inclusion of all embryo transfers that occurred within 12 months, and live-birth follow-up to
October 20188.

In addition to our main analyses (modelling the predicted impact of the economic recession
due to COVID-19), we modelled the predicted impact of the two months closure of ART
clinics. We previously showed that a shutdown of IVF treatment centers would result in a
reduction in live-birth rate, and this reduction would differ with age9. In the current study, we
calculated the reduction caused by a two-month shutdown and applied this to the live-birth
rate for each age strata in 2020 only, assuming that a shutdown would only occur in 2020.

Statistical analysis
The R 4.0.0 software environment was used for data analysis. “Forecast” package was used
to perform auto regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) prediction10.

Results
Figure 1 demonstrates the increase in IVF treatment provision over the last two decades, the
increasing number of ART infants and their increasing contribution to all US births. The

financial recession of 2008 was associated with the beginning of a decline in all US births,
which has continued to present day and is predicted to continue (Figure 1, Table S6). In
contrast, for ART there was evidence of a four-year plateau before recommencing an increase
(Figure 1). During this plateau an estimated 53,026 (95% CI, 49,581 to 56,471) fewer IVF
cycles were undertaken, increasing from 5,625 (95% CI, 5,467 to 5,788) fewer cycles in 2009
to 21,321 (95% CI, 19,589 to 23,053) by 2012, assuming similar underlying rates of growth
prior to 2008 would have continued (Table S7).

There was strong evidence of an age-specific reduction over the ensuing four years; women
aged less than 35 years undertook 5.2% (95% CI, 1.1 to 8.9) fewer IVF cycles in 2009 with a
further reduction to 15.8% (95% CI, 1.0 to 27.8) fewer cycles in 2012, as compared to
women aged more than 40 years where the reduction was 2.9% (95% CI, 0.9 to 6.3) in 2009
and 6.5% (95% CI -9.0% to 18.1%) in 2012 (Figure 2, Table S7). This estimated reduction in
cycle activity between 2009 and 2012 equates to 16,872 (95% CI, 16,713 to 17,031)
predicted fewer live births, with these predominantly being derived from younger women due
to their higher success rates (Table S9).

Given the underlying growth of IVF treatment cycles we estimate that 137,760 (95% CI,
13,486 to 149,034) IVF treatment cycles would have been initiated in 2020, increasing to
151,690 (95% CI, 123,321 to 180,059) in 2023 (Table 1). Estimation of the effect of
COVID-19 economic recession on IVF activity would predict that 67,386 (95% CI, 61,686 to
73,086) fewer IVF cycles will occur over this time frame, mostly from women younger than
35 years (Figure 3, Table 1).

With the closure of the IVF units for 2 months, the minor increase in maternal age will be
associated with a small reduction (-0.7% (95% CI, -1.0 to -0.3%)) on the overall cumulative
live-birth rates for treatments initiated over the whole population in 2020 (Table S10 and
S11). This delay combined with the reduction in clinical activity due to COVID-19, is
predicted to result in 3,414 (95% CI, 3,193 to 3,636) fewer live-births in 2020 (Table 2).
With the overall (combining the impact of the economic recession and clinic closures)
estimated reduction in IVF activity for 2020 to 2023, we predict 25,143 (95% CI, 22,408 to
27,877) fewer live births (Table 2). Sensitivity analyses estimating the impact of less and
more severe economic recession following COVID-19 on IVF cycles and live births are
shown in Tables S12 to S15.

Discussion
We demonstrate that the enduring growth of US fertility treatments temporarily halted after
the 2008 financial crisis until 2012 and then resumed. Despite widespread economic
adversity at this time, women over 40 years largely continued to pursue treatment as
compared to younger women. With economic indicators suggesting an equivalent or even
greater recession anticipated secondary to COVID-19, we estimate that the pandemic will
result in 67,386 fewer IVF cycles being undertaken and 25,143 fewer live-births in the US
over the next four years, equating to 12.7% fewer women having a baby from IVF, with the
greatest reduction observed in women less than 40 years old. This reduction will be primarily
driven by the anticipated economic recession, with clinic closures making only a small
contribution. We acknowledge that these predicted decreases in IVF conceived live-births
following the 2008 recession contribute <2% of the reduction in all live-births in the US at
that time, and despite recent growth ART still constitutes <3% of US births. Thus, reductions
in fertility treatments following the current COVID-19 related recession are not anticipated to

have a major impact on population levels in the US or any other country. Nonetheless the
now accepted right of couples to control their fertility, including through access to treatments,
is likely to be importantly impacted.

For assisted conception which is predominantly self-funded by patients or insurers, the loss of
employment or financial security may have been responsible for the plateau in the aftermath
of the 2008 financial recession. That women older than 40 aged exhibited the lowest
percentage reduction in clinical activity potentially reflects their greater appreciation of the
age-related decline in both spontaneous fecundity17 and IVF success rates6,18. Furthermore, a
decision to not pursue fertility treatments would have the greatest impact on older women as
assisted reproductive technology births equate to 11.8% of all births in women over the age
of 40, as compared to 4.4% in women aged 35-39 years, and 0.9% in women under 35
years19. Older women are also likely to be more financially secure than younger women.

The disruptive economic repercussions of COVID-19 continue to be elucidated with the use
of high-frequency indicators of economic fluctuations, such as unemployment insurance
claims, which breached 30 million in the first six weeks of the pandemic, implying a dramatic
reduction in future employment and labor force participation3,20. At present the longer-term
projections exceed the 2008 crisis, and if the recovery is muted it could take more than 5
years for the most affected sectors to return to 2019-level contributions to GDP. This
backdrop of financial uncertainty is likely to translate into a relative reduction in fertility
related treatment. We anticipate that like 2008, the greatest reduction in clinical activity will
be in younger women, who will perceive that they may be able to wait and conceive naturally
and / or are unable to afford treatment. Reductions in IVF in this age-group will however
have the largest overall impact on birth rates due to the volume of activity and relative high

success rates. Given the relatively small contribution of ART births to all US births the
greatest threat to the population is from younger women deciding to postpone natural
conception or decide against further children due to economic uncertainty (Figure 1 or Table
S5). That this would occur at a time when US fertility rates are already substantially below
replacement levels will have further profound impacts on population age structures21.

Contracting economies may also affect health by impeding adherence to preventive measures
or adoption of unhealthy lifestyle characteristics. Economic downturns have been associated
with increases rates of obesity23, reduce attempts at smoking cessation24, increased incidence
of sexually transmitted infections25 all of which would further impede spontaneous and
assisted conception. Perinatal outcomes may also be compromised as economic adversity has
been associated with an increased risk of miscarriage26 and stillbirths27.

Our results show that economic recession erodes the accepted rights of couples to have their
desired family. Amid an absence of public funding, and patchwork of state mandates for
insurance provision, an economic recession will exacerbate unequal access to health care,
especially for minorities. Lack of an infertility insurance mandate has previously been
associated with an increased risk of triplets and high order multiples, preterm birth and low
birth weight29, as patients may seek more affordable treatments and take higher risks to
address involuntary childlessness. In countries where health-care provision is equally
accessible irrespective of employment or insurance status, access to fertility treatment will be
less problematic and declining birth rates may be less exacerbated by COVID-19.

We note several limitations of our study. We evaluated population health outcomes and
economic trends and did not account for variations at regional or subnational levels, which

may mask variations particularly as the percentage of children born via assisted conception
varies from high levels in some states such as Massachusetts (4.8%) to low in Puerto Rico
(0.2%)30. For reasons of data availability and definitions we utilised total treatment cycles to
develop our growth estimates, thereby allowing for variations in clinical practice and
contextualisation of the 2008 financial crisis over two decades. We are unaware of any other
reasons for the observed plateau, with the resumption of growth in 2012 aligning with other
improvements in macroeconomic indicators. We have assumed an equivalent economic
challenge due to COVID-19 as observed in 2008, however, we have performed sensitivity
analyses for both a less or more severe impact and the true estimate on cycles and live births
is likely to lie between these two extremes. Our prediction methods assume that past activity
is a reliable indicator of future activity; we discuss these assumptions and show our
predictions are not sensitive to them in Supplementary Material. Lastly, our estimates of livebirth reflect current reported success rates for all treatments performed within 12 months of
the initiated stimulation cycle as per CDC and SART, we acknowledge that additional frozen
embryo transfers may occur beyond this time-frame resulting in some additional live-births
that are unaccounted for. It is also possible that improvements in treatment, which we cannot
predict, will cause a relative increase in future live-birth rates for some age groups.

We demonstrate the detrimental impact of the 2008 economic crisis on the uptake of fertility
treatment, and that older women largely persisted in seeking assistance. We estimate that the
COVID-19 related economic recession will be associated with about 25,143 fewer live births
over the next four years, with the greatest reduction observed in women who are 35-40 year
olds where ART related births constitute 4.4% of all US births.
