Abstract
A new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has recently emerged to cause a human pandemic.
Whereas molecular diagnostic tests were rapidly developed, serologic assays are still lacking, yet
urgently needed. Validated serologic assays are important for contact tracing, identifying the
viral reservoir and epidemiological studies. Here, we developed serological assays for the
detection of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing, spike- and nucleocapsid-specific antibodies. Using
serum samples from patients with PCR-confirmed infections of SARS-CoV-2, other
coronaviruses, or other respiratory pathogenic infections, we validated and tested various
antigens in different in-house and commercial ELISAs. We demonstrate that most PCRconfirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals seroconverted, as revealed by sensitive and specific
in-house ELISAs. We found that commercial S1 IgG or IgA ELISAs were of lower specificity
while sensitivity varied between the two, with IgA showing higher sensitivity. Overall, the
validated assays described here can be instrumental for the detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific
antibodies for diagnostic, seroepidemiological and vaccine evaluation studies.

Introduction
In December 2019, a new coronavirus (CoV) emerged in China to cause an acute
respiratory disease known as coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) (1). The virus was identified to
be a betacoronavirus related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and
thus, was named SARS-CoV-2 (2). In less than two decades, this virus is the third known
coronavirus to cross the species barrier and cause severe respiratory infections in humans
following SARS-CoV in 2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome in 2012, yet with
unprecedented spread compared to the earlier two. Due to the rapid rise in number of cases and
uncontrolled and vast worldwide spread, the WHO has declared SARS-CoV-2 a pandemic. As of
March 14th 2020, the virus has infected over 130,000 individuals in 122 countries, 3.7% of
which had a fatal outcome (3). The rapid identification of the etiology and the sharing of the
genetic sequence of the virus, followed by international collaborative efforts initiated due to the
emergence of SARS-CoV-2 have led to the rapid availability of real-time PCR diagnostic assays
that support the case ascertainment and tracking of the outbreak (4). The availability of these has
helped in patient detection and efforts to contain the virus. However, specific and validated
serologic assays are still lacking at the moment and are urgently needed to understand the
epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2.
Validated serologic assays are crucial for patient contact tracing, identifying the viral
reservoir hosts and for epidemiological studies. Epidemiological studies are urgently needed to
help uncover the burden of disease, in particular, the rate of asymptomatic infections, and to get
better estimates on morbidity and mortality. Additionally, these epidemiological studies can help
reveal the extent of virus spread in households, communities and specific settings; which could
help guide control measures Serological assays are also needed for evaluation of the results of
vaccine trials and development of therapeutic antibodies. Among the four coronavirus structural
proteins, the spike (S) and the nucleocapsid (N) are the main immunogens (5). Here, we describe
development of serological assays for the detection of virus neutralizing antibodies and
antibodies to the nucleocapsid (N) protein and various spike (S) domains including the S1
subunit, and receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 in ELISA format. Using a wellcharacterized cohort of serum samples from PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and patients PCR2

confirmed to be infected with seasonal coronaviruses and other respiratory pathogens, we
validated and tested various antigens in different platforms developed in-house as well as a
commercial platform.
Materials and methods
Serum Samples
EMC samples
Serum samples were collected from PCR-confirmed mild and severe COVID-19 patients (Table
1) from France in accordance with the local ethical approvals. Samples used for assay validation
were from persons PCR-diagnosed infections with of human coronaviruses (HCoV-229E, NL63
or OC43), SARS, MERS, or with a range of other respiratory viruses (Table 1) as published
previously (6). Samples from patients with recent CMV, EBV or mycoplasma pneumoniae
infection were included as these have a higher likelihood of causing false positive results. We
used serum samples from 45 healthy blood donors (Cohort A) as negative controls; Sanquin
Blood Bank (Rotterdam, the Netherlands) obtained written informed consent for research use.
All samples were stored at -20°C until use. The use of serum samples from the Netherlands was
approved by the local medical ethical committee (MEC approval: 2014–414). Serum samples
from SARS patients (7) were kindly provided by professor Malik Peiris, Hong Kong University.
Berlin samples
All serum samples from COVID-19 PCR-confirmed cases ( n = 9) were previously
analyzed by recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein-based immunofluorescence test and plaque
reduction neutralization (Wölfel et al submitted manuscript,
doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.05.20030502). Sera were tested as part of an extended
diagnostic regimen upon informed written consent of patients. All non-SARS-CoV-2 sera (n=31)
stemmed from the serum collection of the national consiliary laboratory for coronavirus
detection at Charité, Berlin, Germany and were provided for diagnostic proposes upon informed
written consent. The collection contained follow-up sera from PCR-confirmed human cases: n=4
HCoV-229E, n=3 HCoV-HKU1, n=7 HCoV-OC43, n=3 MERS-CoV, n=6 HCoV-NL63, n=3
SARS-CoV and n=6 common cold CoV antibody positive sera.

Protein expression
The spike ectodomains of SARS-CoV-2 (residues 1–1,213; strain Wuhan-Hu-1; GenBank:
QHD43416.1), SARS-CoV (residues 1–1,182; strain CUHK-W1; GenBank: AAP13567.1) and
MERS-CoV (residues 1-1262; strain EMC; GenBank: YP_009047204.1) were expressed in HEK293T cells with a C-terminal trimerization motif and Strep-tag using the pCAGGS expression
plasmid. Likewise, the SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit or its subdomains (S;S1, residues 1-682; S1A,
residues 1-294; RBD, residues 329-538; GenBank: QHD43416.1) were expressed in 293T cells as

1–750), –OC43 (residues 1–760), NL63 (residues 1–717), 229E (residues 1–537), SARS-CoV
(residues 1–676), and MERS-CoV were expressed as described earlier (6, 8). All the recombinant
proteins were affinity purified from the culture supernatant by protein-A sepharose beads (Cat.no:
17-0780-01, GE Healthcare) or streptactin beads (Cat.no: 2-1201-010, IBA) purification. Purity
and integrity of all purified recombinant proteins was checked by coomassie stained SDS-PAGE.
PRNT
PRNT was used as a reference for this study, because neutralization assays are the
standard for CoV serology. We tested serum samples for their neutralization capacity against
SARS-CoV-2 (German isolate; GISAID ID EPI_ISL 406862; European Virus Archive Global #
026V-03883) by plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT) as previously described for with
some modifications (9). Heat-inactivated samples were 2-fold serially diluted in DMEM medium
supplemented with NaHCO3, HEPES buffer, penicillin, streptomycin, and 1% fetal bovine
serum, starting at a dilution of 1:10 in 50 μL. Fifty μL of the virus suspension (400 spot forming
units) was added to each well and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. Following incubation, the mixtures
were added on Vero-E6 cells and incubated at 37°C for 1 more hour. The cells were then washed
and further incubated in medium for 8 h. After the incubation, the cells were fixed and stained
with polyclonal rabbit anti-SARS-CoV antibody (Sino Biological). The cells were then fixed and
stained using a rabbit anti-SARS-CoV serum and a secondary peroxidase-labelled goat antirabbit IgG (Dako). The signal was developed using a precipitate forming TMB substrate (True
Blue, KPL) and the number of infected cells per well were counted using the ImmunoSpot®

Image analyzer (CTL Europe GmbH). The serum neutralization titer is the reciprocal of the
highest dilution resulting in an infection reduction of >50% (PRNT50). A titer of >20 was
considered to be positive.
The PRNT for the German sera was done as described previously using Vero E6 cells
(Wölfel et al submitted manuscript, doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.05.20030502) (10). Prior
to PRNT patient sera were heat-inactivated at 56°C for 30 minutes. For each dilution step
(duplicate), patient sera were diluted in 200 ul OptiPro and mixed 1:1 with 200 ul virus solution
containing 100 plaque forming units. The 400 ul serum-virus solution was vortexed gently and
incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. Each 24-well was incubated with 200 ul serum-virus solution.
After 1 hour at 37°C the supernatants were discarded, the cells were washed once with PBS and
supplemented with 1.2% Avicel solution in DMEM. After 3 days at plates were fixed and
inactivated using a 6% formaldehyde/PBS solution and stained with crystal violet.
ELISA
We performed Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA ELISA using beta-versions of two commercial
kits (EUROIMMUN Medizinische Labordiagnostika AG, https://www.euroimmun.com) and
performed the assay according to manufacturer’s protocol. Reagent wells of both assays are
coated with recombinant structural protein (S1 domain) of SARS-CoV-2. The optical density
(OD) was detected at 450 nm, and a ratio of the reading of each sample to the reading of the
calibrator, included in the kit, was calculated for each sample (OD ratio). As the beta-version of
the kit awaits CE validation, we determined an in-house cut-off value based on the mean
background reactivity of all SARS-CoV-2-negative sera in the study multiplied by 3. In case of
IgA this was OD ratio = 0.9 and for IgG OD ratio = 0.3.
We performed the inhouse ELISAs by coating 96-well microtiter ELISA plates with in-house
produced spike antigens (S or S1 of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV; or SARS-CoV-2
S1A, or RBD proteins) or SARS-N (Sinobiological) in PBS overnight at 4°C. Following
blocking, diluted serum (1:100 or 2-fold serially diluted for titers) was added and incubated at
37°C for 1h. Antigen-specific antibodies were detected using peroxidase-labeled rabbit anti–
human IgG (Dako, https://www.agilent.com) and TMB as a substrate. The absorbance of each

sample was measured at 450 nm. We set cutoffs at 6 standard deviations above the mean value of
the negative cohort.
S1 Protein Microarray
Serum samples were previously tested for antibodies against the S1 of different coronaviruses as
described earlier (6).
Statistical Analysis
The correlations between antibody responses detected by different ELISAs were and those
detected by PRNT, as the gold standard for CoV serology, were analyzed using GraphPad Prism
version 8 (https://www.graphpad.com).
Results
We evaluated SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody responses in severe and mild cases using
serum samples collected at different times post-disease onset from three French PCR-confirmed
CoVID-19 patients. We tested sera for SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies using different ELISAs.
Following infections, all three patients seroconverted between days 13 and 21 post onset of
disease (Figure 1), and antibodies were elicited against the SARS-CoV-2 S and S1 subunit
including the N-terminal (S1A) domain and the receptor binding domain (RBD). Since the N
protein of SARS-CoV-2 is 90% similar to that of SARS-CoV (Table 2), we used SARS-CoV N
as an antigen to test for SARS-CoV-2 N-directed antibodies in an ELISA format. We found that,
following infection, antibodies were elicited against the N protein and when tested in a PRNT
assay these sera were able to neutralize SARS-CoV-2. We observed cross-reactivity with the
SARS-CoV S and S1 proteins, and to a lower extent with MERS-CoV S protein, but not with the
MERS-CoV S1 protein (Figure 1 G-H). This was evident from analyzing the degree of
similarity of the different CoV S protein domains to their corresponding SARS-CoV-2 proteins
(Table 2), where SARS-CoV showed high similarities in all different S domains. The analysis
showed that the spike S2 subunit is more conserved among CoVs and thus plays a role in the
cross-reactivity seen when the whole S was used as an antigen. Thus, S1 is a more specific than
S as an antigen for SARS-CoV-2 serological diagnosis.

We further assessed the specificity of the S1 assay using cohorts A-E (Table 1)
comprising of sera from healthy blood donors (A), PCR-confirmed acute respiratory non-CoV
infections (B), acute to convalescent PCR-confirmed alpha- and beta-HCoV infections (C), and
PCR-confirmed MERS-CoV (D) and SARS-CoV (E) infections. None of the sera from
specificity cohorts A-D were reactive in our in-house S1 ELISA at the set cut-off indicating
100% specificity, whereas sera from SARS-CoV patients cross-reacted (Figure 2A).
Additionally, the specificity of S1 as an antigen for SARS-CoV-2 serology was further supported
by the fact that 87-100 % of the cohort A-C sera included in this study were seropositive for the
endemic HCoVs (HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and -229E) as determined by the
S1 protein microarray (Figure 2B). Nonetheless, all were seronegative for SARS-CoV and
MERS-CoV. Using the same cohort, we also validated the specificity of the anti-nucleocapsid
and anti-RBD IgG ELISAs for detecting SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies. At the set cut-off,
except of SARS-CoV patient sera, none of the control sera tested positive for anti-RBD nor antinucleocapsid antibodies (Figure 2 C,D), whereas we detected seroconversion among the three
COVID-19 patients. These validated ELISAs for different antigens can be useful for
epidemiological studies as well as for evaluation of vaccine-induced immune responses.
Next, we validated the sensitivity and specificity of 2 commercial ELISA kits for
detecting S1-specific IgG and IgA antibodies using the same cohort (Table1, Figure 3). All
three COVID-19 patients had reactive antibodies by both the IgG (6/10 serum samples) and IgA
(7/10 serum samples) ELISAs (Figure 3). While SARS-CoV patient’s sera were reactive as
noted earlier, we also detected reactivity of serum samples from the validation cohorts A-D;
10/203 for IgA and 7/203 for IgG ELISAs. Two HCoV-OC43 (a β-CoV) patients’ sera were
reactive in both IgG and IgA ELISA kits. We confirmed the cross-reactivity of the two sera by
testing twelve serum samples from both patients collected at different time points, pre- and postOC43 infection. While all pre-infection sera were negative, all post-infection sera were reactive
in both IgG and IgA based ELISAs. We have earlier reported cross-reactivity of these sera in a
MERS-CoV S1 IgG ELISA kit (6). Further validation was also done in a different laboratory
using 31 serum samples collected from 9 COVID-19 German patients (Wölfel et al submitted
manuscript) at different time points (3-23 days post disease onset) as well as a specificity cohort
comprising of 18 serum samples from HCoV (4x HCoV-229E, 3x HCoV-HKU1, 4x HCoV7

NL63, 7x HCoV-OC43) as well as MERS-CoV (n=3) and SARS-CoV (n=3) infected persons
collected 4-56 days post disease onset (Figure 4). All 9 COVID-19 patients were previously
confirmed to seroconvert at days 6-15 post onset of disease using recombinant
immunofluorescence test and PRNT. 8/9 seroconverted patients showed reactivity above the
implemented cut-off values in the IgG and IgA ELISA. One patient (Figure 4, black line)
maintained slightly below the cut-off which might be explained by an overall reduced antibody
response of this patient (PRNT90=10). Overall, the IgA-based ELISA kit was more sensitive but
less specific than the IgG based ELISA kit.
Finally, we compared the performance of the different ELISAs for the detection of
antibodies among PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients to that of PRNT, as the gold standard for
CoV serology (Table 3). PRNT50 correlated strongly with the different ELISAs, with the
commercial IgA showing the strongest correlation followed by the S and N ELISAs indicating
their capacity to detect SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies. However, a larger patient cohort is
needed to assess the sensitivity of these platforms.
Discussion
Validated SARS-CoV-2 serological assays are currently lacking, yet urgently needed for
contact tracing, epidemiological and vaccine evaluation studies. Since the N and the S proteins
are the main immunogenic CoV proteins, we developed ELISA-based assays, which were able to
detect antibodies to these two proteins along with the two spike domains, S1A and RBD. Those
correlated strongly with virus neutralizing antibodies detected by a PRNT50 assay. Since the
majority of the human population has antibodies against the four endemic human coronaviruses,
it was crucial to verify the specificity of these assays to avoid false positive results. Additionally,
the two zoonotic coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, are also beta-coronaviruses,
raising potential for cross-reactivity. Among the spike protein antigens tested, the S1 was more
specific than S in detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, as MERS-CoV-S cross-reactive antibodies
were detected in the serum of one of the COVID-19 patients which was not seen when MERSCoV S1 was used for testing. This could be explained by the high degree of conservation in the
CoV S2 subunit relative to the S1 (Table 2). Therefore, consistent with our earlier findings for
MERS-CoV serology (6), S1 is a specific antigen for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics.

When testing the specificity S1 or its RBD for detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, none
of the sera form the validation cohorts (A-E) showed any reactivity; except for SARS-CoV
patients sera. This - not-unexpected - cross-reactivity resulted from the high degree of similarity
between the S1 and RBD of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Table 2). However, SARS-CoV
has not circulated in the human population since 2003, i.e. 17 years ago, and an earlier study
reported waning of SARS-CoV-specific antibodies which made them undetectable in serum
samples of 91% (21/23) of samples tested 6 years following infection (11). It is therefore
unlikely that antibodies to this virus are present in the population and thus there could hardly be
a chance that false positives result from SARS-CoV-antibodies reactivity. Meanwhile, we made
use of the high degree of similarity between the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 proteins for the
development of our inhouse N ELISA, where we used SARS-CoV N (90% similar to SARSCoV-2) as an antigen. The N-ELISA could detect SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies with high
specificity and sensitivity. Using the three different validated ELISAs, we found that antibody
levels were higher following the severe infection compared to the mild ones; similar findings has
been reported earlier for MERS-CoV (12, 13). However, this needs to be confirmed with a larger
cohort of patients with varying degrees of severity, while it still highlights the potential need of a
sensitive assay to avoid missing those with milder infections in epidemiological studies. Among
the 3 inhouse ELISAs tested, the RBD and N ELISAs were more sensitive than S1 ELISA in
detecting antibodies in mildly infected patients and showed stronger correlation with PRNT50
titers. Therefore, detecting antibodies against two different antigens might be needed to confirm
the findings and avoid false negatives in surveillance studies. However, the sensitivities of the
assays need to be further validated with a larger cohort.
We further validated beta-versions of an IgA and an IgG S1 commercial ELISA in two
different labs. While the IgA-based ELISA showed higher sensitivity than the IgG-based ELISA,
the opposite was true for the specificity where the IgG ELISA was more specific than the IgA
ELISA. Yet, we noted some cross reactivity in both ELISAs with serum samples from the same
two HCoV-OC43 patients that cross reacted in a MERS-CoV S1 IgG ELISA (6) despite the
different antigen coated. This indicates a response to another protein which could be in the
blocking or coating matrix, apart from the specific antigen coated, resulting in this consistent
false positive result.

Overall, the assays developed and validated in this study could be instrumental for patient
contact tracing, serosurveillance studies, as well as vaccine evaluation studies. However, since
various studies will be carried out in different labs, it is crucial to calibrate and standardize
assays developed by different labs using well defined standard references as a part of diagnostic
assay validation. This is not only needed to reduce interassay variability, but to also harmonize
the results obtained from different labs using various assays (14). This is crucial for better
comparison and interpertaion of results from different studies as well as evaluation of vaccine
trials, allowing for uniform assessment of immunogenicity, efficacy and better understanding of
correlates of immune protection (15). Thus, setting up reference panels is a vital element in our
preparedness approaches to emerging viruses.
