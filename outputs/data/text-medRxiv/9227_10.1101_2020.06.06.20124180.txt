Abstract
Background: COVID-19 is an emerging infectious disease which has been declared a Pandemic by the
World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11 2020. This pandemic has spread over the world in more
than 200 countries. India is also adversely affected by this pandemic, and there are no signs of slowing
down of the virus in coming time. The absence of a vaccine for COVID-19 is making the situation worse
for the already overstretched Indian public health care system. As economic burden makes it increasingly
difficult for our country to continue imposing control measures, it is vital for states like West Bengal to
make predictions using time series forecasting for the upcoming cases , test kits , health care and
estimated the requirement of Quarantine centers, isolation beds, ICU beds and ventilators for COVID-19
patients .
Objective: This study is forecasting the confirmed and active cases for COVID-19 until August, using
time series ARIMA model & Public Health in West Bengal, India.
Methods: We used ARIMA model, and Auto ARIMA model for forecasting confirmed and active cases
till the end of August month using time series data of COVID-19 cases in West Bengal, India from
March 1, 2020, to June 4, 2020.
Results: We are expecting that West Bengal will have around 62279 ± 5000 Cases by the end of August
based on our forecasts. Meanwhile Maharashtra, Punjab, Gujarat and Delhi (UT) will be the most
affected states, having the highest number of active and confirmed cases at the end of August.
Discussion and Conclusion: This forecasts show a very crucial situation for West Bengal in coming
days and, the actual numbers can go higher than our estimates of confirmed case as Lockdown 5.0 &
Unlock 1.0 will be implemented from 1st June 2020 in India, West Bengal will be observing a partial lift
of the lockdown and in that case, there will be a surge in the number of daily confirmed and active cases.
The requirement of Health care sector needs to be further improved isolation beds, ICUs and ventilators
will also be needed to increase in that scenario. Inter State & Intra State Movement restrictions are lifted.
Hence, Migrants returning to their homes due to loss of livelihood and income in the lockdown period
may lead to a rise in the number of cases, which could not be accounted for in our projections. We
suggest more of Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model in the health sector to accommodate COVID-19
patients adequately and reduce the burden of the already overstretched Indian public health care system,
which will directly or indirectly affect the States in the time of crisis.
Keywords: COVID 19, India, Forecast, ARIMA, Health Infrastructure, State-level analysis.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is one of the greatest challenges the world has encountered in recent
times. Since the initial reports of outbreak in late December, 2019, It is caused by severe acute respiratory
syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The origin of the virus is yet to be confirmed, but the first
person tested positive is from Wuhan, China. It is spreading very quickly throughout the world & the
numbers have been consistently rising with the disease affecting 6.54 million people in 181 countries
worldwide as of 6th June, 2020. In India, the first positive case of COVID-19 was detected on January
30th 2020, in Kerala. The frailty of a multitude of health care systems across the globe has been exposed
by COVID-19. With the surfacing negative socioeconomic consequences of community mitigation
strategies like lockdown affecting the vulnerable, especially in developing countries like India,
Governments are eyeing at easing the restrictions that have long been in place by recent Lockdown 5.0. It
is imperative to understand that lifting the control measures for economic salvage, without thoroughly
preparing for the possible consequences, may only result in further economic decline and health crisis.
WHO in its strategic advice for countries looking to life the control measures illustrated six criteria in a
sequential manner to be considered: control of transmission; preparation of health systems for active
contact tracing and optimum care provision; careful management of health facilities to prevent outbreaks;
adherence to preventive measures as the essential services resume; management of importation risks;
indoctrination of the ‘new norm’ among communities by active engagement. According to the report of
World Population prospects (2019), India has a population of more than 1.36 billion and most of the
population of urban areas and cities are under the risk of contracting the virus. So, it is important to
forecast numbers of confirmed and active cases. In this scenario, it is vital for every state to make
predictions using time series forecasting, the study aims to draw comparative account of the progression
of COVID-19 in near future in the state of West Bengal.

Data & Methodology
Data:
For our study, the required data of daily total confirmed cases and total active cases of COVID-19
infection collected for India as well as its state West Bengal from the (https://www.covid19india.org/),
and excel of the patient database is used to build a time-series database for confirmed and active cases
Using the Data Science Software called R . In this study, forecasting is done based on the data from
March 1, 2020, to June 4 2020. This data is being used to build Forecast which includes all the Statistics
and Graphs for mentioned model.
Methodology:
In the past few months, an increasing number of research related to forecasting the trend of pandemic
COVID-19 cases are being published using different approaches in various part of the world. (Gupta and
Pal 2020; Fanelli and Piazza 2020; Giordano et al. 2020; Tandon et al., 2020; Kumar et al. 2020;
Benvenuto et al. 2020; Batista, 2020). The ARIMA model is one of them and nowadays used for
forecasting case count for the prediction of epidemic diseases based on the time series modeling (Rios et
al. 2000; Li et al. 2012; Zhang et al. 2014; Benvenuto et al., 2020).
In this study, the well-known Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) time-series model
used for the further forecasting purpose. ARIMA model is one of the generalized forms of an
autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model among the time series forecasting. We fit both models to
understand the data better or to predict future points in the series (Forecasting). ARIMA model depends
or always represented with the help of some parameters, and the model has expressed as ARIMA (p, d,
q): p, d and q are non-negative integers.

The parameters have their usual meaning, here, p stands for the order of auto-regression, d represents the
degree of trend difference (the number of times the data have had past values subtracted) for the
stationary of the trend and q signifies the order of moving average. This model combines auto regression
lags under the stationary trend and moving average and predict better future values based on past and
recent data. For this model, the degree of parameters p, d and q determine based on the partial Autocorrelation function (PACF) graph, The Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test to test the stationary of the time
series observations and Complete Auto-Correlation Function (ACF) graph respectively (Forecasting
COVID-19 cases in India)
We have applied the ARIMA model and Auto ARIMA model using R, to our considered time series data
of COVID-19 cases in West Bengal for the forecasting the total confirmed and active cases for West
Bengal and its majorly affected Districts. We selected Districts based on the criterion that chosen
Districts should have at least 2 confirmed cases till June 2nd 2020. By using this selection criterion, West
Bengal and its 24 Districts Alipurduar, Bankura, Birbhum, Cooch Behar,
Dakshin Dinajpur (South Dinajpur), Darjeeling, Hooghly, Howrah, Jalpaiguri, Jhargram, Kalimpong,
Kolkata ,Malda, Murshidabad, Nadia, North 24 Parganas, Paschim Medinipur (West Medinipur),
Paschim (West) Burdwan (Bardhaman), Purba Burdwan (Bardhaman),
Purba Medinipur (East Medinipur), Purulia, South 24 Parganas, Uttar Dinajpur (North Dinajpur),
The cases are forecasted under the assumption that people will be maintaining condition similar to the
partial lockdown situation and maintain physical distancing with self quarantine. After fitting the model,
the built model is used to forecast confirmed and active cases COVID-19 cases for the next 80 days, i.e.
from June 6rd, 2020, to August 3rd 2020.
The model for forecasting future confirmed and active cases of COVID-19 cases is represented as,
𝐴𝑅𝐼𝑀A (𝑝, d, q): 𝑋𝑡=𝛼1 𝑋𝑡 −1+𝛼2 𝑋𝑡 −2+𝛽1𝑍𝑡−1+𝛽2 𝑍𝑡 −2+ 𝑍t
Where, 𝑍𝑡 =𝑋𝑡−𝑋𝑡−1

(i)
(ii)

Here, Xt is the predicted number of confirmed and active COVID-19 cases at tth day; α1, α2, β1 and β2
are parameters whereas Zt is the residual term for tth day.
The trend of forthcoming incidences can be estimated from the previous cases, and a time series analysis
is performed for this purpose
(Tandon et. al., 2020).
In our study, the forecasted cases are mainly used for preparing the government of West Bengal for the
health infrastructure such as the number of isolation beds, ICU beds and ventilators, Quarantine centers
etc. across the State. In further analysis, based on predicted active cases, we estimated the hike in number
of cases by COVID-19 patients in the coming days. Based on this theory we can maximize the
requirement of Quarantine centers, Alcohol based Sanitizers, Public sanitizing materials, ICUs and
ventilators as the infection hit its peak, which the state may get in the month of July-August according to
the forecast.
Our health infrastructure requirement is estimated based on the active cases as our projections are made
on the basis on data till June 2nd when our country was observing the complete lockdown and starting of
Lookdown 5.0. However, India is observing partial lockdown in Containment Zones currently and has
removed lockdown in the Red, Yellow & Green Zones, so for being prudent, we will estimate the amount
of active cases which are to be increased and also look into the Public Health Infrastructure of West
Bengal.

Allegations against West Bengal Government: A Case Study
Chief Minister of West Bengal Mamata Banerjee and her government was widely criticized of the
handling of the coronavirus pandemic and was accused of concealing facts by the opposition and
critics. The opposition accused Mamata of playing “appeasement politics” amid the COVID-19 crisis.
On 1 April, Banerjee claimed that the West Bengal Government have already traced 54 people who
attended the Tablighi Jamaat religious gathering during the COVID-19 Outbreak, and 44 of them are
foreigners. Although according to a report by central security agencies, 232 people had attended the
Delhi's Tablighi Jamaat event from West Bengal.
Of this, 123 are Indian nationals and 109 are foreigners.
Sooner she clarified that her government has acted swiftly after the Nizamuddin area was declared as a
hotspot where nearly 2,300 people were staying despite the lockdown.
She further added that the government has quarantined 177 people, including 108 foreigners, who
attended the Tablighi Jamaat congregation at the Nizamuddin Markaz.

The West Bengal Government has been also criticized for not sending enough samples to the National
Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases(NICED) for testing.
West Bengal test numbers saw some rise after talks between government and NICED.
According to them, this will be scaled up further in coming days.
The West Bengal Government has also been recommended to ensure transparency, genuine and verifiable
data of COVID-19 by the West Bengal Doctors Forum (WBDF), as doctors cannot afford to send wrong
signals to the world.
The doctors also hit out at the idea of the bureaucratic system to identify the death of COVID-19 patients.
Their spokesperson claimed that every doctor is qualified enough and does not need a committee for such
certification. On April 25, 2020,
The WB Govt admitted that 57 COVID-19 patients died but also said that 39 from comorbidities, after
Inter Ministerial Central Team (IMCT) seek report.
The IMCT also pointed out flaws of the Govt in their letter to the Chief Secretary Rajiva Sinha, in which
the letter read:
There were a large number of patients in the isolation wards of Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute
(CNCI) as well as MR Bangur hospitals awaiting COVID test results for five days or longer.
Specifically at CNCI, there were four patients awaiting test result since April 16, 2020, two patients
awaiting test result since April 17, 2020, and three since April 18, 2020.
Some of the patients have tested negative. It is not clear why the test results should take such a long time
and there is a danger of COVID-19 negative patient acquiring the infection in the hospital while awaiting
test result

Discussion& Conclusion:
The world is going through a pandemic, and almost every country is affected by it. A country as well as
the States needs to know how much burden of active and confirmed cases it will have to bear in the
coming time. It will help the states in taking pre-active measures to prepare adequate health infrastructure
for the coming time based on future needs. We used ARIMA model and Auto ARIMA model on the time
series data of COVID-19 cases in West Bengal for forecasting the total confirmed and active cases till
August end.
Based on the forecasts, confirmed cases for West Bengal at the end of June are expected to be 1783818724 (95% CI: 128806, 227968). West Bengal will be having 27147-30616 confirmed cases (95% CI:
173917, 415800) in the mid of July from the estimates, Even West Bengal will be having 50588-55617
confirmed cases (95% CI: 198917, 525800) in the mid of August from the estimates & we expect that
India will be having
Estimated Cases – 62279 ± 5000 at the end of August.
These results also show that daily confirmed cases are increasing at a faster pace even at the end of June
with around 400-500 daily confirmed cases, so it is likely that peak will be attained afterwards.
According to our forecasts, it is a very alarming situation for India & West Bengal in coming days.
However, the actual numbers can go higher than our estimates of confirmed cases, active cases & trends
we made based on the data till June 3rd in this forecast, when West Bengal observed complete lockdown.
Currently,
West Bengal has a partial lockdown or Following Unlock 1.0 with restrictions varying for three zones
(red, orange and green zone) based on the current assessment of the situation in there.
Lockdown is getting lifted, and in this case, there will be a surge in the number of daily confirmed and
active cases.

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.06.20124180; this version posted June 8, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

It is made available under a CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license .

The requirement of isolation beds, ICUs and ventilators will also be increased in that scenario. The
migrants are returning to their homes due to loss of livelihood and income in the lockdown period, which
may lead to a rise in the number of cases, and could not be accounted for, in our projections.
So, India and its majorly affected states like Maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Delhi & West Bengal
need to be well prepared for the pandemic challenge in coming time and focus on increasing their
healthcare infrastructure, and other states should also remain alert till the pandemic completely recedes.
We suggest a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model in the health sector to accommodate COVID-19
patients adequately and reduce the burden of the already overstretched Indian public health care system.
Limitations or Errors that may occur:
The forecasting of COVID-19 cases is done based on the data under the lockdown duration and few in
Unlock 1.0. So, the forecasted cases in future will be showing the same trend as India would have
observed, had it been observing complete lockdown.
Since May 4, India is observing Unlock 1.0, and for that actual cases will/can/may be more than the
forecasted cases. For our state it is showing hike in COVID-19 infection and increased trend in future,
but the situation may not occur in future because of the nature of the previous trend-pattern is different
from now.
Forecasted cases based on ARIMA model in our study for some states having lower bound for the 95%
CI comes negative values which we have considered zero cases in that situation. In our study, the
seasonality factor was considered but it may vary now due to Unlock 1.0, and it may affect our Forecast,
Therefore the is a Plus – Minus in the forecasted cases to avoid any Big Error, & make the Data more
Reliable.
