Abstract
The outbreak of coronavirus infectious disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic
has rapidly spread throughout over 200 countries, posing a global threat to
human health. Till 15th May 2020, there are over 4.5 million confirmed cases,
with roughly 300,000 death1. To date, most studies focus on severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in indoor environment
owing to its main transmission routes via human respiratory droplets and direct
contact2,3. It remains unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 can spill over and impose
transmission risks to outdoor environments despite potential threats to people
and communities. Here, we investigated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 by
measuring viral RNA in 73 samples from outdoor environment of three
hospitals in Wuhan. We detected SARS-CoV-2 in soils (205-550 copies/g),
aerosols (285-1,130 copies/m3) and wastewaters (255 to 18,744 copies/L) in
locations close to hospital departments receiving COVID-19 patients or in
wastewater treatment sectors. These findings reveal significant viral spillover
in hospital outdoor environments that was possibly caused by respiratory
droplets from patients or aerosolized particles from wastewater containing
SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in other areas or on
surfaces with regular disinfection implemented. Soils may behave as viral
warehouse through deposition and serve as a secondary source spreading
SARS-CoV-2 for a prolonged time. For the first time, our findings demonstrate
that there are high-risk areas in hospital outdoor environments to spread
SARS-CoV-2, calling for sealing of wastewater treatment unit and complete
sanitation to prevent COVID-19 transmission risks.

SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, positively-stranded RNA virus belonging to
the beta coronavirus genus that causes COVID-194-6. It can transmit among
people 5,7-9 via direct contact and respiratory droplet routes6,10,11, while aerosol
or faecal transmission route is also possible12-14. Many studies have analyzed
SARS-CoV-2 in hospital indoor environment to assess its transmission
dynamics and develop strategies to protect medical staffs or drop-in visitors3,15.
In contrast, there is no knowledge about viral presence in outdoor environment.
As a result, it is intractable to evaluate the potential spill-over into open space
and distribution in outdoor environmental matrices of SARS-CoV-2, that
potentially survives for a prolonged time and threatens public health.
We collected 73 outdoor environmental samples of water (28), aerosol (16),
soil (15) and road- or wall-surface (14) from 13 sites in three specialized
hospitals in Wuhan dedicated for COVID-19 treatments, i.e., Jinyintan Hospital,
Huoshenshan Hospital and Wuchang Fangcang Hospital, during their
operation receiving COVID-19 patients in March and April (Figure 1 and Table
S1, see Methods for details). Three out of 15 soil samples (20%) exhibited
positive results for SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA, which were collected near
wastewater treatment sectors and outside patient departments (Table 1).
Among them, the soil sample with 2-m distance to the adjusting tank in
wastewater treatment sector of Jinyintan Hospital contained 253 copies/g of
SARS-CoV-2 (Table S1), whereas the other sample 2-m away from the
disinfection tank was negative in SARS-CoV-2. In other areas, there was 205
copies/g of SARS-CoV-2 in soil with 5 m distance to the outpatient department.
In Huoshenshan Hospital, only soil with 2 m distance to the first adjusting tank
contained SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA at a level of 550 copies/g, while soils in other

wastewater treatment units or medical staff living area exhibited negative
signals. None of soils in Wuchang Fang Hospital surrounding the septic tanks
and in background areas was positive for virus. To our knowledge, this is the
first report showing the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in soils. Since soils
are environmental matrices rich in organic matters that can protect and shield
viruses, SARS-CoV-2 might not be sanitized by disinfectants or ultraviolet light
as evidenced by previous studies on other viruses16,17, and possibly survive for
a prolonged time in hospital outdoor environment.
All road- and wall-surfaces in outdoor environment of the three studied
hospitals were negative in viral signals (Table 1). Surface contamination of
SARS-CoV-218, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus19,20
and norovirus21 has been observed in hospital indoor environment. Our results
documented that frequent disinfection of three times a day in hospital outdoor
environment effectively removed the virus of SARS-CoV-2.
To trace the source of SARS-CoV-2 in soils, we collected the surrounding
aerosol samples. Inside the adjusting tank of Jinyintan Hospital and
Huoshenshan Hospital, SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols was found at a level of 285
copies/m3 and 603 copies/m3, respectively (Table 1 and Table S1). They were
of comparable levels to SARS-CoV-2 detected in intensive care units (ICU)3,22
and exhibited high transmission potential via aerosol deposition. On the
contrary, aerosol SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in downstream wastewater
treatment units of the second adjusting tank and the moving-bed biofilm
reactor (MBBR). Outside patient departments of Jinyintan Hospital,
SARS-CoV-2 in the aerosols collected 5 m away from outpatient building were
1130 copies/m3, whereas undetected in aerosols collected 5 m away from

inpatient building. Since aerosols are highly dynamic, SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols
depends on the sources of respiratory droplets or airborne viruses in a short
period, which is largely attributed to the aerosolized droplets from the tidal
breathing of COVID-19 patients2. In contrast, no SARS-CoV-2 was detected in
aerosols above soils exhibiting negative results, e.g., background area of
Jinyintan Hospital, medical staff living area of Huoshenshan Hospital, and the
entrance and outdoor toilet of Wuchang Fangcang Hospital. Our results imply
that hospitals receiving COVID-19 patients have high-risk outdoor areas
(patient departments and wastewater treatment sector). SARS-CoV-2
contamination on ground surface was only previously reported in indoor
studies, explained by deposition of airflow-displaced virus-laden droplets in
COVID-19 patient living room18. The co-existence of SARS-CoV-2 in both soils
and aerosols in the high-risk areas hints viral spillover, deposition and
accumulation in soils from airborne SARS-CoV-2.
To further examine whether the aerosol and soil SARS-CoV-2 was derived
from wastewater treatment sector, we analyzed SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in
waters from different treatment tanks. SARS-CoV-2 in Jinyintan Hospital was
only detected in water from the adjusting tank (255 copies/L, Table S1), but
undetected in other tanks and effluents. Raw medical wastewater in the
adjusting tank of Huoshenshan Hospital contained 633 copies/L of
SARS-CoV-2, which was only occasionally found in MBBR (505 copies/L) and
sedimentation tank (2,208 copies/L) (Table S1). No SARS-CoV-2 was detected
in effluents after disinfection. All water samples collected in the preliminary
disinfection tanks of Wuchang Fangcang Hospital had no SARS-CoV-2 signal.
SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in wastewater from the septic tanks

disinfected by 800 mg/L of sodium hypochlorite, ranging from 557 to 18,744
copies/L, and it declined to non-detected after the dosage of sodium
hypochlorite increased to 6,700 mg/L since 5th March23. Our results suggest
apparent presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in raw water from wards,
signifying the need for complete disinfection. As it decayed rapidly in medical
wastewater treatment process and a complete disinfection was applied for all
effluents before discharge, there was negligible risk of SARS-CoV-2 spread
through pipe network receiving treated wastewater from hospitals.
It is worthy of noting that SARS-CoV-2 was observed in all waters, aerosols
and surrounding soils at the adjusting tank of wastewater treatment sector in
Jinyintan Hospital and Huoshenshan Hospital (Table 1). As these areas are
barely visited by COVID-19 patients and medical staffs, it is likely that
SARS-CoV-2 arose from viral RNA-containing medical wastewater via
aerosolization in the uplifting process, forming airborne virus-containing
aerosols, and eventually depositing on soils. The wastewater treatment sector
in Wuchang Fangcang Hospital is a temporary enclosed system effectively
preventing the spillover of airborne SARS-CoV-2 from wastewater, resulting in
negative viral signals in surrounding aerosols and soils. This implies
appropriate sealing of the adjusting tank and other treatment units might block
the potential viral transport from wastewater into aerosols and deposition on
soils.
For the first time, we demonstrate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA
in hospital outdoor environments of three specialized hospitals dedicated for
COVID-19 treatments. SARS-CoV-2 existed in all environmental matrices at
hospital departments receiving confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients

(aerosols and soils) and wastewater treatment sector (waters, aerosols and
soils), revealing high-risk areas for potential SARS-CoV-2 transmission as
illustrated by Figure 2. High-risk areas located outside patient departments are
exposed to respiratory droplets containing SARS-CoV-2 by receiving
confirmed or asymptomatic COVID-19 patients. Alternatively, undisinfected
medical wastewater in the adjusting tank of wastewater treatment sector might
spill airborne viruses through uplifting or aeration and then deposit
SARS-CoV-2 on surrounding soils and solid-surfaces. Traditional outdoor
disinfection strategies mainly focus on walls, roads or facilities and can
deactivate viruses on solid-surfaces with high efficiency24,25, explaining the
negative results on all road- and wall-surfaces in this work. Viral presence and
survival in soils are seldom examined and there is limited work addressing the
potential risks of soil viruses26. Soils can receive the viruses from aerosols and
waters, and potentially become a new source for SARS-CoV-2 transmission in
outdoor environment. Non-point outdoor spillover of SARS-CoV-2 from
individual houses of confirmed or asymptomatic COVID-19 patients and
environmental viral residue in crowded areas need attentions and further
investigations.
Although we do not address SARS-CoV-2 infectivity by viral culture and
only collected limited numbers of samples owing to the strict control during the
COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China, our study unravels the distributions of
SARS-CoV-2 in soils, aerosols, waters, and surfaces, covering the major
outdoor environments of hospitals. Although viruses might decay rapidly from
these high-risk areas and regular disinfection can effectively eliminate
SARS-CoV-2, the overall risks of hospital outdoor environments are significant,

Materials and methods
Hospitals
Jinyintan Hospital is the first hospital in Wuhan receiving COVID-19 patients,
and in outpatient and inpatient departments. Its medical wastewater treatment
sector is comprised of an adjusting tank, an aeration tank for biodegradation, a
secondary sedimentation tank and a disinfection tank (Figure S1A).
Huoshenshan hospital is a newly-constructed hospital designated for
COVID-19 patients and confirmed patents were transferred directly into wards.
There is no inpatient or outpatient department, and the wastewater treatment
sector consists of a process integrated storage sector with two adjusting tanks
and one septic tank, a MBBR, a sedimentation tank and a disinfection tank
(Figure S1B). Medical staff area is located south-east to ward area. Wuchang
Fangcang Hospital is a temporary shielding hospital open from 5th February to
10th March 2020, receiving 1124 COVID-19 patients. Wastewater from eight
outdoor toilets were pumped in 4 preliminary disinfection tanks, transferred
into three septic tanks outside, followed a final disinfection. After 24-hour, the
effluent was pumped and discharged into pipe network and wastewater
treatment plants. Chlorine-based disinfectants are supplemented in wards and
the disinfection tank only.

Sample collection
Sampling sites are located in outdoor environment of Jinyintan, Huoshenshan
and Wuchang Fangcang Hospitals, including different in wastewater treatment
sectors, inpatient departments, outpatient departments, outdoor toilets and
temperate septic tanks (Figure 1 and Table S1). Around 2.0 L of water was
directly collected in a plexiglass sampler. Aerosol samples were collected

using bioaerosol samplers (WA-15, Beijing Dinglan Tech. Ltd., China) at a flow
rate of 14.0 L/min for 30 min. About 20 grams of soils were sampled at the
ground surface (< 5 cm), and surface samples were collected using swabs
wetted with phosphate buffer saline (pH=7.4) from road or wall (20×20 cm). All
samples were immediately placed in 4 °C ice-boxes and transferred into
laboratory for RNA extraction on the same day.

RNA extraction and RT-qPCR
RNA extraction from all environmental specimens followed our previously
reported protocol 23. Briefly, water (400 mL) and aerosol (2-3 mL) samples
were centrifuged at 3,000 rpm, and the supernatant was subsequently
supplemented with NaCl (0.3 mol/L) and PEG-6000 (10%), settled overnight at
4 °C, and centrifuged at 10,000 g for 30 minutes. Soil (3-5 g) and viral pellets
after PEG-6000 sedimentation was extracted using the RNeasy® PowerSoil®
Total RNA Kit (MOBIO, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was quantified by RT-qPCR using
AgPath-ID™ One-Step RT-PCR Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) on
a LightCycler 480 Real-time PCR platform (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA) in
duplicates. Two target genes simultaneously amplified were open reading

5'-FAM-TTGCTGCTGCTTGACAGATT-TAMRA-3'). RT-qPCR amplification for
CCDC-ORF1 and CCDC-N was performed in 25 μL reaction mixtures
containing 12.5 μL of 2×RT-PCR Buffer, 1 μL of 25×RT-PCR Enzyme Mix, 4 μL
mixtures of forward primer (400 nM), reverse primer (400 nM) and probe (120
nM), and 5 μL of template RNA. Reverse transcription was conducted at
45 °C for 10 min (1 cycle), followed by initial denaturation at 90 °C for 10 min
(1 cycle) and 40 thermal cycles of 60 °C for 45 second and 90 °C for 15
seconds. Quantitative fluorescent signal for each sample was normalized by
ROX™ passive reference dye provided in 2×RT-PCR buffer. For each
RT-qPCR run, both positive and negative controls were included. The copy
numbers of SARS-CoV-2 was obtained from a standard calibration curve by a
10-fold serial dilution of genes encoding nucleocapsid protein with an
amplification efficiency of 102.6%, calculated as copies=10[-(Cq-39.086)/3.262]
(R2=0.991). For quality control, a reagent blank and extraction blank were
included for RNA extraction procedure and no contamination was observed.
