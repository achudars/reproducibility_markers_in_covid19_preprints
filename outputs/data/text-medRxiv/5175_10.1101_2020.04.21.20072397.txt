Abstract
Background:

A growing number of epidemiological cases are proving the possibility

of airborne transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Ensuring adequate
ventilation rate is essential to reduce the risk of infection in confined spaces.
Methods:

We obtained the quantum generation rate by a COVID-19 infector with a

reproductive number based fitting approach, and then estimated the association
between infected probability and ventilation rate with the Wells-Riley equation.
Results:

The estimated quantum generation rate of COVID-19 is 14-48 /h. To ensure

infected probabolity less than 1%, ventilation rate lareger than common values
(100-350 m3/h and 1200-4000 m3/h for 15 minutes and 3 hours exposure,
respectively) is required. If both the infector and susceptibles wear masks, the
ventilation rate ensuring less than 1% infected probability is reduced to 50-180 m3/h
and 600-2000 m3/h correspondingly, which is easier to be achieved by normal
ventilation mode applied in some typical scenarios, including offices, classrooms,
buses and aircraft cabins.
Interpretation:

The risk of potential airborne transmission in confined spaces cannot

be ignored. Strict preventive measures that have been widely adopted should be
effective in reducing the risk of airborne transmitted infection.

Introduction

The once-in-a-century coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic shows that
the risk of infection in public confined spaces cannot be ignored. Although the
transmission of COVID-19 occurs mainly via droplets during close contact or
contaminated surfaces, a recent study showed that severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains viable in aerosols for multiple hours
[1], and a latest report issued by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering,
and Medicine suggested that currently available research supports the possibility
that SARS-CoV-2 could be spread via bioaerosols generated directly by patients’
exhalation based on collected evidences [2]. A latest field sampling study further
indicates that SARS-CoV-2 was widely distributed in the air and the transmission
distance in the air might be up to 4 m [3]. There have been many studies suggest that
insufficient ventilation increases disease transmission [4]. Therefore, ensuring the
safety of the ventilation and air conditioning system for offices, classrooms and
public transport is essential to reduce the risk of infection in these confined spaces,
which is extremely important for our daily life.
In this study, we employed the Wells–Riley equation [5] to estimate the association
between infected probability and ventilation rate. We firstly obtained the quantum
generation rate by a COVID-19 infector with a fitted correlation between
reproductive number and quantum generation rate, and then estimated association
between infected probability and ventilation rate for some typical scenarios,
including offices, classrooms, buses and aircraft cabins.

Method

2.1 Wells-Riley Equation

The Wells–Riley equation is as follows [5]:

   1    ⁄

(1)

Where P is the probability of infection (risk). C is the number of cases to develop
infection, S is the number of susceptibles. I is the number of source patients

(infector). In this study, we focused on normal scenarios (not health care settings for
COVID-19 patients), thus we assumed I=1. p is the pulmonary ventilation rate of each
susceptible per hour (m3/h), p=0.3 m3/h when people sitting or doing light activity
indoor [6]; Q is the room ventilation rate (m3/h); q is the quantum generation rate
produced by one infector (quantum/h); and t is the exposure time (h).
The Wells-Riley equation has the key assumptions: (1) Droplet nuclei are evenly
distributed in space, which means the infection risk predicted by this equation is
uniform within the space; (2) The equation neglects viability and infectivity of the
pathogen quanta.
As for the effect of wearing mask, we consider wearing mask is equivalent to
increasing the room ventilation rate due to the filtration effect of the mask, resulting
a diluted concentration that susceptibles inhale. The filtration efficiency of ordinary
medical surgical mask on virus-laden aerosols is assumed to be 60% [7]. Considering
the influence of air leakage, the filtration efficiency can be considered as 50% [8],
which is equivalent to double the ventilation rate. If both the infectors and
susceptibles wear masks, the ventilation rate is increased to 4 times equivalently.
The key input parameter when applying the Wells–Riley equation is quantum
generation rate, q, which is determined by the infectious disease we concern.
2.2 Quantum generation rate with a reproductive number based fitting approach

So far, there have been no available literatures reported the quantum generation rate
(q) of COVID-19. To obtain a reasonable quantum generation rate of COVID-19 for
applying the Wells–Riley equation, we collected the known quantum generation rate
(q) and basic reproductive number (R0) for other airborne transmitted infectious
diseases in previous studies, and fitted the association between q and R0. Then we
estimated q with R0 of the COVID-19 based on the fitted equation. The basic
reproductive number is the key epidemiological determinant that characterizes the
transmission potential of a certain infectious disease, which is defined as the average
number of infectious individuals created by a single infectious person in a completely

susceptible population [9]. As basic reproductive number essentially determines the
rate of spread of an epidemic, thus we think it may be logical and reasonable to
obtain quantum generation rate based on its association with basic reproductive
number. Table 1 lists the values of q and R0 for several typical infectious diseases
collected from references. With the values listed in this table as inputs, we fitted the
association between q and R0 with a least square method implemented in Origin

3.2 Association between infected probability and ventilation rate

Infection probability

Figure 2 shows the estimated association between infected probability and
ventilation rate. For the case there is one infector inside the confined space, 100-350
m3/h of ventilation rate is required to ensure susceptibles exposed for 15 minutes
with less than 1% infected probabolity; and 1200-4000 m3/h of ventilation rate is
required to ensure infected probabolity less than 1% for 3 hours-exposured
susceptibles.
The role of wearing mask

The estimated association between infected probability and ventilation rate for the
wearing mask cases is shown in Figure 3. It indicates wearing mask play an important
role in reducing the probability of infection. For the scenario where there is one
infector in the space, if both the infector and susceptibles wear masks, the required
ventilation rate to ensure infected probability less than 1% is reduced to 50-180 m3/h
for 15 min-exposured susceptibles, and 600-2000 m3/h for 3h-exposured
susceptibles, respectively.
Some typical scenarios

Figure 4 shows the estimated infected probability association with ventilation rate for

some typical scenarios. Table 2 lists the corresponding air change rates (ACH). The air
change rate is a measurement of how much fresh/clean air replaces indoor air in one
hour [20], which is easy to applied to judge if the actual ventilation and air
conditioning system could provide enough ventilation rate to ensure low infected
probability .
If people wearing mask, natural ventilation or normal mechanical ventilation can
provide enough ventilation rate ensureing infected probability less than 1% for most
scenarios (except for office, as shown table 2). However, without wearing mask may
result a relative higher infection risk for most cases, especially if q reachs the
maximum.

Discussion
The estimation indicates that, once an infector (especially an asymptomatic infector
has not been identified as confirmed COVID-19 patient) enters a public confined
space, the risk of infection is relative high, with approximately 2% of infected
probability at the common ventilation rate (500-2500 m3/h as shown in Figure 2).
Such findings may partly explain the early large-scal epidemics in China and the other
European and American countries.
Wearing a ordinary medical surgical mask is effective, thus it is important to educate
people wearing mask when they enter or stay in confined spaces.
Furthermore, the above finding imply that preventing the infectors (especially
asymptomatic infectors has not been confirmed as patient) from entering those
public spaces is critical to suppressing the spread of the virus via airborne
transmission. Current measures, strict screening of asymptomatic infectors with
more widely nucleic acid test and home isolation have already ensured that infectors
are unlikely to enter public spaces, also ensured a relatively safe environment of
confined spaces.
We acknowledge that direct evidences of airborne transmission of COVID-19 are still
lack. However, the risk of potential or opportunistic airborne transmission cannot be
ignored, and the value of q warrants further study. Also, there is no need to panic. As
govements and public have realized the emergency of the pandemic, strict
preventive measures have been widely adopted, which are effective in reducing the
risk of airborne transmitted infection.
