A Data-Informed Approach for Analysis, Validation,
and Identification of COVID-19 Models

Abstract— The COVID-19 pandemic has generated an enormous amount of data, providing a unique opportunity for modeling and analysis. In this paper, we present a data-informed
approach for building stochastic compartmental models that
is grounded in the Markovian processes underlying these
models. Our initial data analyses reveal that the SIRD model
– susceptiple (S), infected (I), recovered (R), and death (D) – is
not consistent with the data. In particular, the transition times
expressed in the dataset do not obey exponential distributions,
implying that there exist unmodeled (hidden) states. We make
use of the available epidemiological data to inform the location
of these hidden states, allowing us to develop an augmented
compartmental model which includes states for hospitalization
(H) and end of infectious viral shedding (V). Using the proposed
model, we characterize delay distributions analytically and
match model parameters to empirical quantities in the data
to obtain a good model fit. Insights from an epidemiological
perspective are presented, as well as their implications for
mitigation and control strategies.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The COVID-19 pandemic has infected individuals in
nearly every country on earth. The pervasive spread of the
underlying virus, SARS-CoV-2, combined with modern day
data collection practices, has resulted in vast amounts of
epidemiological data. This has provided researchers with a
unique opportunity to not only model, analyze, and mitigate
COVID-19, but also to develop best practices to quickly
respond to future pandemics.
From a modeling perspective, compartmental models are
the predominant approach for describing the progression
of diseases. These models describe an aggregated view of
disease dynamics by partitioning a given population into
groups, termed compartments, and studying how the size of
the groups evolve in time, typically via ordinary differential
equations (ODEs). In the case of modeling COVID-19, some
simple models, such as the SIR model with three compartments (states) – susceptible (S), infected (I), and recovered
(R) – have been studied [1]–[3]. Such models have generated

many insights, proving to be useful in the estimation of
model parameters (e.g., estimation of the basic reproduction
number R0 ), prediction of the future evolution of the disease
(e.g., the predicted number of infected agents), and the
analysis and design of mitigation and control strategies (e.g.,
the effects of lockdown or mask wearing, tradeoffs between
epidemiological and optimal costs).
Since the beginning of the pandemic, several extensions
of the basic SIR model have been considered to include
additional states such as exposed (E), asymptomatic (A),
quarantined (Q), hospitalized (H), and death (D) [1]–[10].
For example, the SIDARTHE model also considers a patient’s health and testing status [10]. Although ODE models
remain the most popular, stochastic extensions of these
models have also been considered to better capture the effect
of un-modeled noise [11]–[15]. Other types of modeling
options include neural networks and artificial intelligence
[16], autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)
[17], and agent-based approaches [18], [19].
Although the SIR ODE model (and its many deterministic and stochastic generalizations) is useful, these models
represent (mean-field) approximations of the underlying dynamics. The epidemiological states are more fundamentally
described for a single agent who is first susceptible and
then becomes infected and eventually recovers. The main
assumption underlying the mean-field approximation leading
to an ODE model is that the transitions between the epidemiological states are Markovian. In the case of COVID-19, a
state transition diagram (see Fig. 1) is useful to visualize the
evolution of the disease for a single agent. For the S → E
transition, one typically assumes that the rate parameter
scales proportionally with the number of infected agents
in the population. In the language of interacting particle
systems, the S → E transition depends upon the interaction
amongst agents. In contrast, the transition when a susceptible

agent is first exposed to (or infected by) the virus depends
upon the population. The remaining transitions, however, are
not affected by the population, depending instead solely upon
the intrinsic characteristics of the agent (e.g. age, gender,
pre-existing conditions).1
We have two goals in this paper. The first goal is to
examine the Markovian assumption underlying the agentdependent transitons (e.g., I → R, I → D). This is done through
collecting and analyzing data related to observed transition
time delay distributions for a large number of infected agents.
The second goal is to develop and apply a data-informed
methodology to construct Markov models with hidden states
that better fit the delay distribution and fatality rate data. The
approach is demonstrated for real data collected as part of
the first goal.
The proposed data-informed approach allows for an incremental construction of compartments such that the model
sufficiently explains the data, while being based on epidemiological evidence for SARS-CoV-2. In contrast with
the current body of research, this work serves to highlight
the importance of data to disease modeling for COVID-19,
where models are built from the insights provided by the
data. This model building process is demonstrated through
the progression from a model of low to high complexity
based on transition distribution fitting.
The outline of the remainder of this paper is as follows.
In Sec. II, the epidemiological data used in this study is
briefly summarized. The main aspects of analysis and model
construction appear in Sec. III. A discussion of the resulting
epidemiological insights and its implications for control
appear in Sec. IV.
II. E PIDEMIOLOGICAL DATA
Much of the publicly-available COVID-19 data is aggregate data, such as the number of cumulative and daily new
infections, death count, testing data, etc. These data are not
directly useful for the type of epidemiological modeling
considered here. For our purposes, the so called anonymized
line-list data2 which charts the progression of disease in
anonymized agents are needed. Such data require prior IRB
approval, which is currently pending for our project. In the
interim, we have gathered all the publicly-available data on
delay distributions between various transitions of interest.
The nomenclature for the epidemiological states appears in
Table I. A summary of data appears in Table II. It is noted
that no data was found that dealt with the transition from
susceptible state (S). The data for exposure (E) were highly
uncertain. Consequently, the remainder of this paper focuses
on remaining transitions {I,H,R,D}.
Summary of data: The preliminary epidemiological data
upon which our analysis is based consist of a collection
of 10 de-identified, open-source datasets acquired online
1 Although this is a useful approximation, the transitions I → R and I → D
may also be affected by the population, e.g., if the health care system is
strained as a result of a large number of infected agents.
2 Anonymized line-list data consist of information on start and end date
of certain epidemiological stages at an individual level.

[20]–[28]. The countries of origin for these data are United
States, China, and South Korea, as well as one dataset of
international travelers, which encompasses individuals from
27 nations. All datasets contain key demographic information
regarding patient age and sex, and some include additional
information about comorbidities and symptoms. In order
to examine the impacts of age on COVID-19 infection
outcomes, which have been seen in clinical settings [29]–
[31], we have stratified the data by ages 0-19, 20-59, and
60+ when possible.
We summarize next the data on delay distributions relevant to the following transitions important to COVID-19
modeling:
(i) Delay distribution for I → H transition: The NIH data,
as listed in line 2 of Table II, contain data for 814 individuals. However the individuals with non-positive delays
are removed from the dataset. This reduces the number
to 371. Fig. 2a depict the histogram of the ages in the
dataset. Fig. 3b and 3c depict the time delay distributions
for adults and elderly together with the maximum likelihood
exponential and gamma distribution fits. In contrast to I → R
and I → D datasets, the delay distribution for I → H transition
is reasonably approximated by the exponential distribution
for both adults and elderly.
(ii) Delay distribution for I → R transition: Compared to
I → H and I → D transitions, there is much less publicly
available data for the I → R transition. For this transition,
data from three different datasets were consolidated: data
from China with 56 datapoints, data from Korea with 21
datapoints, and a data from international passengers with 29
datapoints. On account of the small number of datapoints,
three datasets are combined to carry out the analysis. Fig. 2b
depicts the histogram of ages in the combined dataset. Fig. 3e
and 3f depict the time delay distributions for the different age
groups together with the maximum likelihood exponential
and gamma distribution fits. As also observed for the I →
D transition, these distributions are not exponential and
moreover distributions for adults and elderly are somewhat
similar (although the latter point is difficult to conclude based
on the small number of data points in these datasets).
(iii) Delay distribution for I → D transition: CDC data,
as listed in line 1 of Table II, are the most comprehensive
source for delay distribution of the I → D transition. The CDC
dataset contains data for 36,176 individuals including age
and sex; 35,816 of which have positive delay values. Fig. 2c
depicts the histogram of ages in the CDC dataset. Fig. 3g3i depict the time delay distributions for three different age

categories – children, adults, and elderly – along with the
maximum likelihood exponential and gamma distribution
fits. The data and the fits allow us to make the following
observations:
(i) The delay distributions are clearly not exponential
for adults and the elderly.
(ii) The distributions for adults and the elderly (two
age categories that dominate the dataset) are remarkably close to each other. This is despite significant
differences in case fatality rates.
In the following section, our aim is to fit compartment
models based on using these delay distributions.
III. DATA A NALYSES
This section introduces a process of fitting a continuous
time Markov chain model to the data. This is achieved by
augmenting the chain one state at a time with the goal of
matching empirical quantities of the data to their theoretical
values expressed in terms of rate parameters. As will be
shown, we obtain a model that describes the data well.
A. Notation and a Basic Model
We begin by introducing the notation used throughout our
analyses as well as some useful results. For the Markov chain
depicted in Fig. 4a, the observed quantities that appear in the
data correspond to the following set of random variables:
⎧
⎧
(0)
(0)
(0)

⎪T

TI→D = ⎨ 1
⎪
⎪

The distributions for these random variables are stated in
the following elementary proposition.
Proposition 1. Consider the Markov chain depicted in
Fig. 4a. Then, conditioned on the respective events {TI→R <
∞} for TI→R and {TI→D < ∞} for TI→D ,

where = denotes equivalence in distribution.
The above proposition is useful in examining the model’s
validity. In fact, the model is not valid due to the following:
(i) The observed distributions for TI→R and TI→D are
not exponential; and
(ii) The observed distributions for TI→R and TI→D are
not identical.
The goal of the remainder of this section is to consider
enhancements of the basic model, via the addition of hidden
states, to better fit the data.
B. One Hidden State
The simplest possible enhancement of the basic model
is to introduce one hidden state. The states under this
augmented model are {I,H,R,D}, where I, R, D are defined
as before and H is a new (intermediate) hidden state. For the
analysis provided here, the state H is selected to be hospital
admission. This choice was carried out based on consultation
with the epidemiologists on the team. It is noted that the
observed transition from infected to hospitalized is well
described by an exponential distribution (see Figs. 3b,3c).

The above expectations and probabilities are readily approximated using their empirical estimates obtained from
the available data (see Table II). In principle, one can then
solve the five equations for five rates. If no non-negative
solution exists, then the model is invalidated. Alternatively,
one can derive certain necessary conditions in the form of
inequalities. Prop. 3 provides one such inequality.

in Fig. 4b. Let

empirical value are also indicated.

The two inequalities are readily visualized in the (P(D ∣
I),P(H ∣ I)) diagram depicted in Fig. 5: the yellow region is
where the inequalities are violated. By plotting the observed
empirical values in the diagram, it can be seen that the model
with a single hidden state is invalidated. Given that Fig. 4b
represents the most general Markov chain, this also serves
to show that no model with a single hidden state can fit
the available data. Next, a model with two hidden states is
considered.

In Fig. 6, a Markov chain model with two hidden states is
depicted. The states are denoted by {I,H,V,R,D}, where H
is interpreted as before and V is an additional intermediate
hidden state. In epidemiological terms, the state V has the
meaning of the end of infectious viral shedding. The model

depicted in Fig. 6 is not the most general type of model with
two hidden states. For example, here it is assumed that direct
I → D transition is not present. However, as is shown next,
this model, apart from being epidemiologically meaningful,
provides a reasonable fit to the observed data.

Using these formulae, the identified rates for the three age
groups are tabulated in Table V. The model is also used to
obtain the distributions for the three random variables. Its
comparison with the empirical distributions is depicted in
Fig. 7. The expectation E(TI→R ) is fitted with 5% tolerance,
all other data are fitted with > 0.999% accuracy. It can
be seen that the distributions for I → H and I → D are
well approximated. However, the distribution fit for I → R
is not as good. One explanation for the relatively poor fit
for I → R could be underparametrization. Specifically, one

IV. E PIDEMIOLOGICAL I NSIGHTS AND I MPLICATIONS
FOR C ONTROL
The analyses of Sec. III generated several interesting
epidemiological insights. The analysis of the two hidden
state Markov chain model, consisting of hospitalization (H)
and end of infectious viral shedding (V ), shows that these
additional states are important to the disease progression.
Seeking medical care has a dramatic effect on outcomes,
and is also an indication of disease severity, with those
experiencing more severe symptoms being more likely to go
to the hospital. Hospitalization also is a form of quarantine,
which plays a role in the chain of transmission. The end
of infectious viral shedding is another key parameter in

transmission and is a biologically significant event in the
course of a patient’s illness. Inclusion of these two parameters suggests that these models can be successfully informed
by epidemiology, and paves the way for future analyses.
Other epidemiological insights involve the differences in
outcome distributions between age categories. An interesting
observation gained from examining Figs. 3h and 3i is that
in fatal infections, the time to death is similar among
adults and the elderly since the distributions for both age
categories are almost identical. This suggests that another
factor, possibly comorbidity, is the driving factor behind time
to death for individuals over 20 years old. In the future,
it may be beneficial to stratify the data by the presence or
absence of a comorbidity and build this factor into the model.
Another conclusion from the I → D graph in Figs. 3g is that
when children die, they die quickly. This could be due to
the children having comorbidities, incorrect estimations of
the time of symptom onset, or some characteristic of the
pathogen that affects children differently. However, there is
very limited data on children and COVID-19 in general, and
thus interpretations of the data should be made cautiously.
An additional observation from Figs. 3e and 3f is that adults
take longer to recover than the elderly. It is important to
note that the dataset for I → R is much more sparse than
I → D, so inferences must be made with hesitation. This could
point to different pathophysiology of the disease in different
age groups, but no definitive conclusions can be drawn from
these data.
While the analytical procedure outlined in this paper has
provided some useful insights into the nature of COVID19, the general approach is not confined to analysis of the
current pandemic. The insights obtained from our analyses
are useful for general epidemic processes, especially in the
design of mitigation and control strategies. For instance,
understanding the delay distributions between states is important for defining allowable response times for mitigation
to be effective. This is particularly important when allocating limited resources (such as testing kits or vaccinations)
among multiple regions. Looking forward, as more data are
generated and collected, information regarding heterogeneity
in the delay distributions will further guide response among

multiple regions (especially when coupled with the growing
amount of mobility data becoming available).
As a whole, this work contributes toward development
of a novel strategy for building stochastic compartmental
models based on Markovian principles and epidemiological
data. Future data acquisition will further strengthen this
methodology and allow for more insights into the disease
dynamics of COVID-19.
