Abstract
The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, etiological agent of recently named Coronavirus infected
disease (COVID-19) by WHO, has caused more than 2, 000 deaths worldwide since its emergency
in Wuhan City, Hubei province, China, in December, 2019. The symptoms of COVID-19 varied
from modest, mild to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and the latter of which is
generally associated with deregulated immune cytokine production; however, we currently know
little as to the interplay between the extent of clinical symptoms and the compositions of lung
immune microenvironment. Here, we comprehensively characterized the lung immune
microenvironment with the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from 3 severe and 3 mild
COVID-19 patients and 8 previously reported healthy lung controls through single-cell RNA
sequence (scRNA-seq) combined with TCR-seq. Our data shows that monocyte-derived FCN1+
macrophages, whereas notFABP4+ alveolar macrophages that represent a predominant
macrophage subset in BALF from patients with mild diseases, overwhelm in the severely
damaged lungs from patients with ARDS. These cells are highly inflammatory and enormous
chemokine producers implicated in cytokine storm. Furthermore, the formation of tissue resident,
highly expanded clonal CD8+ T cells in the lung microenvironment of mild symptom patients
suggests a robust adaptive immune response connected to a better control of COVID-19. This
study first reported the cellular atlas of lung bronchoalveolar immune microenvironment in
COVID-19 patients at the single-cell resolution, and unveiled the potential immune mechanisms
underlying disease progression and protection in COVID-19.

Introduction
Since December, 2019, a disease outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus (now given the name
SARS-CoV-2) started in Wuhan, and has quickly spread in China and subsequently inmany other
countries [1]. The WHO has declared the new coronavirus (CoV) infection as a global public
health emergency and named the coronavirus infected disease-19 (COVID-19). The genome
analysis showed that the SARS-CoV-2 is a SARS-CoV like β-lineage coronavirus [2] and likely
originates from bats [3]. SARS-CoV-2 uses human ACE2 protein as their receptors [4], which
explains its similarly high transmissibility. The clinical data indicated that the COVID-19 varied
from asymptomatic to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), similar as SARS-CoV infection
[5-7]. Although researchers are racing against time to develop vaccines and test anti-viral drugs in
clinical trials [8], there is no effective prophylactic and clinical treatment for COVID-19 yet.
Generally, the COVID-19 is less severe and less fatal than the SARS, however, some patients,
especially aged populations with co-morbidities are prone to develop more severe symptoms and
require emergent medical interventions [9]. It is not completely understood why some patients
develop severe but others have mild or even asymptomatic diseases by the same SARS-CoV-2
infections. The immunopathogenesis of hCoVs-induced respiratory distress syndrome may
involve deranged interferon production, hyper-inflammatory response and cytokine storms,
inefficient or delayed induction of neutralizing antibody and specific T cell responses [10, 11].
However, due to biosafety and ethics issues and technical limitations, most of the current
knowledge was generated from animal model studies, and not directly from human subjects.
More investigations using patient samples are needed to explore the relevant protective or
pathogenic mechanisms in clinical settings.
Here, we applied the emerging single-cell RNA sequence (scRNA-seq) and single-cell TCR-seq to
comprehensively characterize the lung bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cells from 6 of
COVID-19 patients, including 3 severe and 3 mild cases. Our study depicts a high-resolution
transcriptome atlas of lung resident immune subsets in response to SARS-CoV-2 infections. It
reveals that compared to the lung immune microenvironment of mild symptom patients,
monocyte-derived FCN1+ macrophages replacing the FABP4+ alveolar macrophages predominate
macrophage lineage compostions in the severely damaged lung, which are highly inflammatory
and potent chemokine producers. Furthermore, the lung resident highly expanded clonal CD8+ T

cells formed in the mildly infected patients support the notion that a rapid and robust adaptive
immune response is potentially critical for controlling COVID-19.

Results
A glimpse of lung immune microenvironment in the COVID-19 patients
To characterize the immune microenvironment of the SARS-CoV-2-infected lung, we performed
scRNA-seq analysis of single cells in the lung BALF (37, 820 cells) using the 10X Genomics
platform, from 3 of recovered mild cases and 3 of severe cases (Figure 1A, Table 1). We also
collected public available scRNA-seq data (43, 627 cells) of 8 normal lungs as control [12]. This
dataset passed stringent high-quality filtering (Figure S1), yielding a mean of 188K reads/cell with
median gene and unique molecular identifier (UMI) counts of 2, 070 and 6, 852, respectively
(Table S1).
The clustering analysis showed 36 distinct cell clusters (C) composed of major cell subtypes
including macrophages, NK & T, B and plasma cells, epithelial and endothelial cells (Figure 1B),
identified by unique signature genes CD68 (macrophages), CD3D and KLRF1 (T & NK cells),
MS4A1 (B and plasma cell), AGER, SFTPC, SCGB3A2, TPP3 and KRT5 (epithelial cell), VWF
(endothelial cell) and DCN (fibroblasts), respectively (Figure 1C and S2A). We confirmed that the
data integration removed batch effects and enabled excellent reproducibility across different
donors. Major cell populations and most clusters included cells from each sample (Figure 1D and
S2B). We were also able to detect low levels of SARS-CoV-2 transcripts in various cell populations
from severe COVID-19 patients but not mild cases and controls (Figure S2C). We assumed that
these viral transcripts were likely ambient contaminations of viral loads in the BALF.
We then compared the distribution of different cellular compartments among control, mild and
severe group. There were higher proportions of T and NK cells in the COVID-19 patients than
those in controls, while epithelial cells in patients are fewer. As compared to mild cases, severe
patients contained more macrophages but less proportion of T and NK cells (Figure 1E-1F).
Together, our data showed an increased recruitment of immune cells to the lung in response to
SARS-CoV-2 infection, and that the lung immune cell compartments differed between mild and
severe COVID-19 patients.

Dysregulated BALF macrophage compartments in COVID-19 patients with severe diseases
The increased lung macrophage population was present in severe COVID-19 patients. To further
understand the macrophage heterogeneity, we re-clustered the macrophages and showed 22
clusters (Figure 2A). Recent studies have identified three distinct human lung macrophage
subsets by FCN1 (monocyte derived), SPP1 (pro-fibrotic) and FABP4 (alveolar macrophage, AM)
marker expression [13]. Referring to the classification criteria and other macrophage markers
(Figure S3A), we found that most macrophage clusters (except for C15 as a dendritic cell subset)
in our study could also be grouped by FCN1, SPP1 and FABP4 expression patterns. Group 1
includes C9 and C10 (FCN1hi only), Group 2 includes C0, C6, C12, C16 and C19 (FCN1loSPP1+),
Group 3 includes C7, C8 and C18 (FCN1-SPP1+), Group 4 contains C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C11, C13, C14,
C17, C20, C21, C22 (FABP4+) (Figure 2B).
We found that the composition of the macrophage groups differed significantly among controls,
mild versus severe COVID-19 patients (Figure 2C). This transformation was also reflected by
differential expression of FCN1, SPP1 and FABP4 genes in the controls and patients (Figure 2D).
We further confirmed that FCN1 was preferentially expressed by individual controls and mild
COVID-19 patients, while SPP1 and FABP4 were highly expressed by severe COVID-19 patients
(Figure 2E). Together, these data showed a dysregulated balance of lung macrophage populations
during the progression of severe COVID-19, manifested by substantially increased group 1
monocyte-derived macrophages (FCN1+), group 2 & 3 macrophages (SPP1+), and almost a
complete loss of lung AMs (FABP4+).
To further understand the difference of the aforementioned 4 groups of macrophages, we
conducted gene expression (GEX) analysis (Figure 2F). Group 1 expressed S100A8, S100A9, VCAN,
FCN1, CD14, SELL associated with inflammatory monocytes. Group 2 expressed chemokines CCL2,
CCL3, CCL4, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11 and ISGs APOBEC3A, ISG15, ISG20, GBP1, ITITM3, MX1, etc.
Group 3 expressed immune regulatory genes A2M, GPR183, CCL13 etc. and pro-fibrotic genes
TREM2, TGFB1, SPP1. Group 4 expressed typical AM genes, such as FABP4, FABP5, INHBA,
MACRO, TFRC, MRC1, etc. GSEA and GO analysis further revealed that group 1, 2 and 3 were
more activated and inflammatory, while group 4 was featured with lipid metabolic functions
(Figure 2G and S3B). Using SCENIC, we deduced the transcription factors (TFs) activity in
macrophage groups (Figure 2H). Consistent with their inflammatory phenotype and functions, we

found enhanced STAT1, STAT2 and multiple IFN regulatory factors (IRFs) activity among group 1, 2
and 3 macrophages. We also identified M2-like TFs, MAF and CREB1, specifically in group 3
macrophages, and AM-TFs, PPARG and BHLHE41, specifically in group 4 macrophages. Finally, we
analyzed the differentiation trajectory of macrophage populations, and found a linear path
starting from group 1, then 2 & 3, eventually to group 4 (Figure 2I).
Collectively, consistent with early report [13], we identified the group 1 as the monocyte-like
population, group 3 as the recently reported pro-fibrotic SPP1+ population and group 4 as the
lung AM. Moreover, we identified a novel intermediate macrophage population (group 2), only
from the severe COVID-19 patients. Our data indicated that the monocytes are recruited from
circulation (FCN1+) to the lung to fuel the inflammation during severe diseases, and some
monocytes may further go through the differentiation process into the SPP1+ populations and
eventually the FABP4+ AMs.

Characterization of T and NK cell responses in BALF from the lungs of COVID-19 patients
NK and T lymphocytes are immune effectors against viral infection. Previous studies showed that
robust and early T cell response played crucial roles in viral clearance during acute respiratory
infections [14]. After exclusion of contaminated clusters, our clustering analysis of T and NK
lymphocytes identified 5 major subsets (Figure 3A) based on the typical T and NK cell markers
(Figure 3B). NK cells highly expressed KLRF1, KLRC1 and KLRD1. CD8+ T cells expressed CD8A and
CD8B. The CCR7+ cells expressing CD4 and IL7R were likely CD4+ T cells, Treg cells were
CTLA4+FOXP3+IL2RA+, and proliferating cells were TYMS+MKI67+.
Comparing few numbers of NK and T lymphocytes in controls, the proportions of NK and T
lymphocytes in the lung was largely increased in COVID-19 patients (Figure 1F and 3C). Among
different subsets, we observed lower proportion of CD8+ T cells, and increased proportion of
proliferating cells in severe patients than the mild patients (Figure 3C and 3D). GEX analysis
showed that CD8+ T cells expressed high levels of effector molecules, including GZMA, GZMK,
FASLG, CCL5, etc., and resident T cell markers ITGA1, CXCR6, JAML, etc., likely played crucial roles
in immune defense (Figure S4).
The higher number of lung CD8+ T cells in mild patients may indicate a role of CD8+ T cells in the
clearance of the virus. In contrast, the higher level of T cell proliferation in severe disease group is

intriguing. We assumed that it might be related to bystander activation induced by hyper
inflammation, or a delayed response to the infection in severe COVID-19. To further understand
the relevant functional status of each NK and T cell subsets between mild and severe patients, we
conducted GEX analysis. We found T cell activation, migration, calcium ion signaling molecules
were upregulated in CD8+ T cells from mild cases, but the virus responses, metabolites and
energy generation, and translation initiation molecules was upregulated in CD8+ T cells from
severe cases (Figure 3E and 3F). Thus, these data confirm our assumption that more effective
CD8+ T cells in mild patients help to clear the viruses, while CD8+ T cells in severe patients are in
preparation to proliferate.

Characterization of single-cell TCR repertories in BALF from COVID-19 patients
When encountering antigens, specific B and T lymphocytes respond through clonal expansion to
generate effector and memory cells with the same specificity to deal with the invaded pathogens.
Expanded anti-viral T cell clones may exert protective or pathogenic functions during viral
infections dependent on different situations. Here, we took advantages of single-cell TCR-seq to
assess the status of clonal expansions in the BALF of patients. As expected, CCR7+ T cells as naive
or central memory cells, showed little clonal expansion, while CD8+ effector T cells showed the
highest expansion levels among different T cell subsets (Figure 4A and S5). Proliferating T cells
and Treg cells also showed some expansion, but were less pervasive. Next, we examined the
proportions of expanded clones between COVID-19 patients with mild and severe diseases. We
found that the expansion levels in both total T and CD8+ T cells were significantly higher in mild
disease group than the severe patients (Figure 4B and 4C, S5). In average, more than 50% CD8+ T
cells in mild group were expanded clones, which likely represented the SARS-CoV-2-specific T
cells. They also showed higher amplification index than those from severe patients (Figure 4C). At
the individual levels, we also found the higher T cell clonality was consistently remained in the 3
mild patients as compared to the 3 severe patients (Figure 4D), supporting that highly expanded
CD8+ T cell participated in resolving the SARS-CoV-2 infection. To confirm the functional status of
expanded T cell clones, we performed GEX analysis between expanded CD8+ T cells versus
non-expanded cells. We found increased expression of signaling and tissue resident genes
including XCL1, XCL2, ZNF683, HOPX, CXCR6 and ITGAE, etc., which further supports a superior

effector functions of those expanded CD8+ T cells (Figure 4E).
Discussion
The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 varied from asymptomatic to ARDS, which has been similarly
observed in SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and influenza infections [7]. Host immune responses on some
extent determine both protection and pathogenesis to the respiratory viral infections [11, 14]. A
well co-ordinated innate and adaptive immune response may rapidly control of the virus, while a
failed immune response leads to viral spreading, cytokine storm, and high mortality [15].
However, the immune players and the detailed molecular mechanisms related to these different
processes are incompletely understood yet, in SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Previous studies have shown the significantly higher levels of inflammatory cytokines,
chemokines and interferon stimulated genes associated with disease severity in SARS, MERS and
COVID-19 patients [10, 16]. The increased infiltrating macrophages into the lung are identified in
the autopsy and animal models, and are thought to be responsible for fueling the inflammation
[17-19]. Macrophages are well known to contain heterogeneous subsets, including tissue
resident and monocyte derived populations, covering a broad spectrum from M1 to M2 like
phenotype [20]. However, little is known regarding the macrophage subsets and their molecular
features in SARS-CoV-2-infected human lungs. Here, we identified 4 groups of lung macrophages
which can be classified by FCN1, SPP1 and FABP4 markers according to recent reports [13]. Group
1 & 2 macrophages are FCN1+ and highly inflammatory. They express higher levels of interferon
stimulated genes and multiple chemokines, CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, IL-8, CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11,
thus identifying the FCN1+ macrophages as the culprit for the deranged hyper-inflammation. We
identified the group 3, SPP1+ macrophages likely represented a repaired but also a pro-fibrotic
subset [12]. They may counteract the FCN1+ macrophages to dampen the inflammation. Their
roles and associations with patient outcomes should be further investigated. The group 4
macrophages are FABP4+ AMs showing higher PPARγ activity which play important physiological
roles in metabolizing lipid surfactant [20]. Here, we found that AMs consisted the principle lung
macrophages in both controls and mildly infected patients, but was almost completely lost in
severely infected lungs. The loss of AMs likely contributed to the failed lung functions. Together,
these data improved our understanding of tissue macrophage heterogeneity in the
immunopathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Adaptive immune system is specific and memorizes the pathogens, including two arms, the
antibody and T cell responses. Inducing adaptive immunity is also the aim of vaccination. SARS
studies showed that binding and neutralizing antibodies are elicited in SARS-CoV infections, but
their association with clinical outcomes is unclear [21]. Robust antibody responses were
developed in severely infected SARS patients [22]. However, it is debated whether
antibody-dependent enhancement played roles in disease exacerbation [23, 24]. Memory T cell
responses are induced and maintained in SARS-CoV infected subjects [25]. T cell immunity was
also confirmed to be necessary for resolving the viral infection in mouse models [26, 27].
However, the roles of T cells, especially resident T cells, in controlling the disease severity of
SARS-CoV infected patients are not proved yet. Here, we applied both scRNA-seq and TCR-seq to
characterize the lung resident T cell populations. Our data not only revealed the presence of a
larger population of CD8+ T effectors in mild group, but also showed that these CD8+ T cells
contain highly expanded clones, indicating their SARS-CoV-2 specificity. Thus, we presented the
fresh evidence that CD8+ T cell response likely holds the key for successful viral control in
COVID-19 patients. This data will guide the future development of vaccine and potential T-cell
immunotherapy for the severe viral respiratory infections.

The shortcomings of our study is that only 6 samples are able to be investigated and our endpoint
study may not determine the triggering factors leading to different clinical outcomes. We
propose that characterizing the earlier immune events and longitudinal analysis of immune
dynamics of the infected patients may help gain more insights. These emerging high dimensional
techniques, like scRNA-seq, mass cytometry and multiplex imaging tools [28, 29], will greatly
improve human immunology studies using minimal precious tissue samples.

Materials and Methods
Patients
Ethics statement: This study was conducted according to the principles expressed in the
Declaration of Helsinki. Ethical approval was obtained from the Research Ethics Committee of
Shenzhen Third People’s Hospital. All participants provided written informed consent for sample
collection and subsequent analyses.
Subjects and clinical sample collection: The six patients used in this study were recruited from the
Shenzhen Third People’s Hospital in January, 2020. The demographic characteristics of these
study populations are provided in Table 1. The patients included 3 mild cases and 3 severe cases,
the median age is 49.5 years old, 5 male and 1 female. All patients had Wuhan exposure history
and had cough and (or) fever as the first symptom. Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 was based on clinical
symptoms, exposure history，chest radiography, and sputum, nasal swab and/or bronchoalveolar
lavage fluid (BALF) viral PCR assays. Influenza A and B virus infection were excluded at the time of
enrollment. The patient C142 has clinical symptoms, CT findings although SARS-CoV-2 PCR
negative. She is a family member and close contact with C143.

Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
The throat swab, sputum, nasal swab and BALF were collected from the respiratory tract of the
patients at various time-points after hospitalization. Viral RNAs were extracted by Viral RNA was
extracted from samples using the QIAamp RNA Viral Kit (Qiagen, Heiden, Germany). Then
quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed using the
primers and probes targeting ORF1ab and N genes of SARS-CoV-2 recommended by China CDC,
and a commercial kit specific for SARS-CoV-2 detection (GeneoDX Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China). The
specimens were considered tentatively positive if qRT-PCR Ct value lower than 37 is detected at
any time-points during the hospitalization. Then the assay is repeated to confirm the positivity if
the Ct value was similar or between 37~40. If the repeat Ct was above 40, then the specimen was
considered negative.

Isolation of BALF cells
About 20 ml of BALF was obtained and placed on ice. BALF was processed within 2 hours and all

operations were performed in BSL-3 laboratory. By passing BALF through a 100 µm nylon cell
strainer to filter out lumps and then the supernatant was centrifuged and the cells were
re-suspended in the cooled RPMI 1640 complete medium. Then the cells were counted in 0.4%
trypan blued, centrifuged and re-suspended at the concentration of 2×106 /ml for further use.

Capturing, library construction and sequencing
Total 11 µl of single cell suspension and 40 µl barcoded Gel Beads were loaded to Chromium Chip
A to generate single-cell gel bead-in-emulsion (GEM). The poly-adenylated transcripts were
reverse-transcribed later. The single-cell capturing and downstream library constructions were
performed using the Chromium Single Cell 5’ library preparation kit according to the
manufacturer’s protocol (10x Genomics). Full-length cDNA along with cell-barcode identifiers
were PCR-amplified and sequencing libraries were prepared and normalized to 3 nM. The
constructed library was sequenced on BGI MGISEQ-2000 platform.

Healthy Control Data
The lung scRNA-seq data from the healthy controls was acquired from the Gene Expression
Omnibus (GEO) database under the series number GSE122960 [12], which contains data of lung
tissue from eight lung transplant donors generated using 3' V2 chemistry kit on Chromium Single
cell controller (10xGenomics). Filtered feature-barcode matrix was used in the following analysis.

ScRNA-seq data alignment and sample aggregating
The Cell Ranger Software Suite (Version 3.1.0) was used to perform sample de-multiplexing,
barcode processing and single-cell 5’ UMI counting with human GRCh38 as the reference genome.
Specifically, splicing-aware aligner STAR [30] was used in FASTQs alignment. Cell barcodes were
then determined based on distribution of UMI count automatically. Finally, gene-barcode matrix
of all 6 donors and 8 healthy control was integrated with Seurat v3 [31] to remove batch effect
across different donors. Following criteria were then applied to each cell, i.e., gene number
between 200 and 6000, UMI count above 1000 and mitochondrial gene percentage below 0.1.
After filtering, a total of 81447 cells (5436/3858/5235/5191/5341/4300/7516/6750 cells for
healthy control; 3542/3411/363 cells for mild patients; 17340/11872/1292 cells for severe

patients) were left for following analysis.

Dimensionality reduction and clustering
The filtered gene-barcode matrix was normalized with LogNormalize methods in Seurat and
analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA) using the top 2, 000 most variable genes. Then
Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) was performed on the top 50 principal
components for visualizing the cells. Meanwhile, graph-based clustering was performed on the
PCA-reduced data for clustering analysis with Seurat v3.

Differential analysis for clusters
MAST [32] in Seurat v3 was used to perform differential analysis. For each cluster,
differentially-expressed genes (DEGs) were generated relative to all of the other cells.

Single cell trajectory analysis
Slingshot [33] was used to perform pseudotime inference for the four myeloid cell groups.

Regulatory network inference
Single cell regulatory network for 4 myeloid groups was constructed with SCENIC [34]. Specifically,
GRNBoost2 (https://github.com/tmoerman/arboreto) in pySCENIC was applied to infer gene
regulatory networks from expression data. The regulators-group heatmap was generated with R
package AUCell.

[35] were performed with clusterProfiler [36], which supports statistical analysis and visualization
of functional profiles for genes and gene clusters. In GSEA analysis, 50 hallmark gene sets in
MSigDB [37] were used for annotation.

TCR V(D)J sequencing and analysis
Full-length TCR V(D)J segments were enriched from amplified cDNA from 5’ libraries via PCR

amplification using a Chromium Single-Cell V(D)J Enrichment kit according to the manufacturer’s
protocol (10x Genomics). The TCR sequences for each single T cell were assembled by Cell Ranger
vdj pipeline (v3.1.0), leading to the identification of CDR3 sequence and the rearranged TCR gene.
Cells with both TCR alpha and beta chains were kept and cells with only one TCR chain were
discarded. The quality of TCR-seq was listed in Table S2. Then the clonality of the different T cells
defined by scRNA-seq data was explored.
