Abstract
This paper develops an agent-level stochastic simulation model, termed RAW-ALPS, for
simulating the spread of an epidemic in a confined community. The mechanism of transmission is agent-to-agent contact, using parameters reported for COVID-19 pandemic. When
unconstrained, the agents follow independent random walks and catch infections via physical proximity with infected agents. The main goal of the RAW-ALPS simulation is to help
quantify effects of preventive measures – timing and durations of lockdowns – on infections,
fatalities and recoveries. Three types of lockdown measures are considered: (1) whole population (except essential workers), (2) only the infected agents, and (3) only the symptomatic
agents. An infected agent under quarantine can only infect a co-inhabitant, thus causing
a decline in infections during lockdowns. The model provides quantifications of changes
in infection rates and casualties by imposition and maintenance of restrictive measures in
place. The results show that the most effective use of lockdown measures is when all infected
agents, including both symptomatic and asymptomatic, are quarantined, while allowing for
free movements of all uninfected agents. This calls for regular and extensive testing of the
population to isolate and restrict all infected agents.

INTRODUCTION

There is a great interest in stochastic modeling and analysis of medical, economical and epidemiological data resulting from current the COVID-19 pandemic [2]. From an epidemiological
perspective, until a large amount of infection, containment, and recovery data from this pandemic becomes available, the community will rely primarily on simulation models to help assess
situations and to evaluate countermeasures ([1]). Naturally, simulation systems that follow precise mathematical and statistical models are playing an important role in understanding this
dynamic and complex situation ([8]). There have been a large number of models proposed in the
past literature, relating to the the spread of epidemics through human contacts or otherwise.
They can be broadly categorized in two main classes (a more detailed taxonomy can be found
in [15]):
1. Population-Level Coarse Deterministic Modeling: A large number of epidemiological models have focused on coarse, population-level summaries - counts of infected (I),
susceptible (S), removed or recovered (R), etc. The most popular model of this type is the
Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model [17] proposed by Kermack and McKendrick in
1927. This model uses ordinary differential equations to model constrained growth of the

counts in these three categories. There are several other variations of this model including
the SIRD model [20] given by:

and mortality. The zero-sum condition dS
dt + dt + dt + dt = 0 ensures constancy of the
community size: S(t)+I(t)+R(t)+D(t) = N . A large number of other papers have studied
variants of this basic model and have adapted them for different epidemics, such as ebola
and SARS [12]. While there are spatial versions of SIR models, they are not focused on
detailed modeling of spatial dynamics. They typically use a uniform static grid to represent
the spread of infections, from a location to its neighbors, over time. In general, these
models do not explicitly model agent dynamics as residents move around in a community
or across communities. Additionally, these models provide deterministic outcomes, with
no mechanism to incorporate randomness in the model. Several recent simulation models,
focusing directly on COVID-19 illness, also rely on such coarser community level models
[22].
2. Agent-Level Modeling: While population-level dynamical evolutions of population variables are simple and effective for overall assessment, they do not take into account any
social dynamics, human behavior, societal restrictions, and complexities of human interactions explicitly. The models that study these human-level factors and variables, while
tracking disease at an individual level, are called agent-level models [13]. Here one models the mobility, health status, and interactions of individual subjects (agents) in order
to construct an overall population-level picture in a bottom-up way. The advantages of
agent-based models are that they are more detailed and one can vary the parameters of
restriction measures, such as social distancing, at a granular level to infer overall outcomes.
Furthermore, these models have built-in stochastic components for agent motions, interactions, infections, and recoveries, thus enabling a more realistic simulation environment.
Agent-based models have been discussed in several papers, including [11, 21, 16, 15] and
so on. The importance of simulations-based analysis of epidemic spread is emphasized in
[19] but with a focus on infection models within host. Some aspect of spreading of diseases
using network contact is also discussed. Hunter et al. [16] construct a detailed agent-based
model for spread of infectious diseases, taking into account population demographics and
other social conditions, but they do not consider countermeasures such as lockdowns in
their simulations. A broad organization of different agent-based simulation methods have
been presented in [15]. Although there are numerous other papers on the topic of agentbased simulations for simulating spread of infections, we have only listed the most relevant
ones.
In this paper we develop a mathematical simulation model, named RAW-ALPS, to replicate
the spread of an infectious disease, such as COVID-19, in a confined community and to study
the influence of some external interventions on final outcomes. Since RAW-ALPS is purely a
simulation model, the underlying assumptions and choices of statistical distributions for random
quantities become critical in its success. On one hand it is important to capture the intricacies
the observed phenomena as closely as possible, using sophisticated modeling tools. On the other
hand, it is important to keep the model efficient and tractable (for individual laptops) by using

simplifying assumptions. One can, of course, relax these assumptions and obtain more and more
realistic models as desired, albeit with increased computational complexity.
Simulation Setup: We assume a closed community with infection initiated by a single infected
agent at the beginning. The infections are transmitted through physical exposure (proximity) of
mobile susceptible agents to mobile infected agents, as shown in the middle panel of Fig.1. When
unconstrained, the agents follow a smooth random-walk model independent of other agents (see
left panel of Fig.1). When instructed to lockdown, an agent moves towards his/her household
unit and stays put until the restrictions are imposed. The households are arranged, equally
spaced at the grid points of a square-domain (Fig.1 right)
An agent’s health situation follows the chart shown in the left side of Fig. 2. Susceptible
agents become infected by exposure to infected agents with certain probability. The infected
agents go through a period of sickness, with two eventual outcomes – full recovery for most and
death for a small fraction. That is, one starts as non-infected or susceptible, potentially gets
infected with a certain probability, and later recovers or dies according to their event probabilities. Those with non-fatal infections are further labeled as symptomatic or asymptomatic
agents. Naturally, agents with fatal outcomes are also labeled as symptomatic. This labeling
allows for selective imposition of lockdown measures on either full population or just a subset.
Once recovered, we assume that the agents can no longer be infected, as suggested by CDC
FAQ [4]. The social dynamical model used here is based on a fixed domicile, i.e. each agent
has a fixed housing unit. Under unrestricted conditions, or no lockdown, the agents are free to
move over the full domain using a simple motion model. These motions are independent across
agents and encourage smooth paths. Under lockdown conditions, the required agents head directly to their housing units and generally stay there during that period. The remaining agents,
including a small fraction of agents termed essential workers, are allowed to move freely under
the restrictions. The infected agents under quarantine can only infect susceptible agents living
in the same household and not the general public, as shown in the right side of Fig. 2. Similarly,
mobile infected agents can only infect other mobile agents but not those under quarantine.
The main highlights and contributions of this paper are as follows: (1) Agent-level transmission of infections and thus more granular analysis than (population level) deterministic dynamical models; (2) Random-walk motions of agents when unconstrained and constrained to
households under lockdowns; (3) Different classifications of infections – fatal and non-fatal with
the latter being either symptomatic or asymptomatic; (4) Selective lockdowns for different strata

of RAW-ALPS in understanding influences of countermeasures is presented in Section 4. The

Random-Walk, Agent-Level Pandemic Simulation (RAW-ALPS)

In this section we develop our simulation model for agent-level interactions and spread of the
infections across a population in a well-defined geographical domain. In terms of the model
design, there are competing requirements for such a simulation to be useful. On one hand, we
want to capture detailed properties of agents and their pertinent environments so as to render
a realistic model of pandemic evolution with or without countermeasures. On the other hand,
we want to keep model complexity reasonably low, in order to utilize it for analyzing variable
conditions and countermeasures. Also, to obtain statistical summaries of pandemic conditions
under different scenarios, we want to run a large number of simulations and compute averages.
This also requires keeping the overall model simple, from a computational perspective, to allow
for multiple runs of RAW-ALPS.

2.1

Simplifying Assumptions

The overall setting of the simulation model is as follows. We assume that the community
is located in a square geographical region D with h household units arranged centrally on a
uniformly-spaced square grid in D. We assume that there is a fixed number N of total agents in
the community (including all classifications – uninfected, infected, dead, etc) and their health
status updates every unit interval (one hour) indexed by variable t. The agents freely traverse all
parts of D when unconstrained but are largely restricted to their home units under restrictions.
Next, we specify some simplifying assumptions:
• Independent Agents: Each agent (person) has independent motion and independent
infection status. The actual infection event is of course dependent on being in a close

4

proximity of an infected carrier (within a certain distance, say ≈ 6 feet) for a certain
exposure time. But the probability of an agent being infected is independent of such
events for other persons.
• Full Mobility In Absence of Restrictive Measures: We assume that each agent is
fully mobile and moves across the domain freely when no restrictive measures are imposed.
In other words, there is no effect of an agent’s age, gender, or health on his/her mobility.
Also, we do not impose any day/night schedules on the motions. Some papers, including [10], provide a two- or three-state models where the agents transition between some
stable states (home, workplace, shopping, etc) in a predetermined manner. To implement
such detailed models requires careful considerations about the daily movement patterns of
agents, and that increases model complexity.
• Homestay During Restrictive Measures: We assume that most agents stay at home
at all times during the restrictive conditions. Only a small percentage (set as a parameter
ρ0 ) of population, representing essential workers, are allowed to move freely but the large
majority stays at home.
• Sealed Region Boundaries: In order to avoid complications resulting from a transportation model in the system, we assume that there is no transfer of agents into and out
of the region D. The region is modeled to have reflecting boundaries to ensure that all the
citizens stay with in the region. The only way the population of D is changed is through
death.
• Fixed Domicile: The whole community is divided into a certain number of living units
(households/buildings). These units are placed in square blocks with uniform spacing.
Each agent has a fixed domicile at one of the units. During a lockdown period, the agents
proceed to and stay at home with a certain fidelity. We assume that all agents within a
unit are exposed to each other, i.e. they are in close proximity, and can potentially infect
others.
• No Re-Infection: We assume that once a person has recovered from the diseased then
he/she can not be infected again for the remaining observation period. While this is an
important unresolved issue for the current COVID-19 infections, it has been a valid assumption for the past Corona virus infections and it remains the current CDC guideline [4].
• Single Patient Ground Zero: The infection is introduced in the population using
a single carrier, termed patient ground zero at time t = 0. This patient is selected
randomly from the population and the time t is measured relative to this introduction
event.
• Constant Immunity Level: The probability of infection of agents, under the exposure
conditions, remains same over time. We do not assume any increase or decrease in agent
immunity over time. Also, we do not assign any age or ethnicity to the agents and all
agents are assumed to have equal immunity levels.

2.2

Model Specifications

There are several parts of the model that require individual specifications. These parts include a
model on dynamics of individual agents (with or without restrictions in place), the mechanisms
of transmitting infections from agent to agents, and the process of recovery and fatality for

infected agents. A full listing of the model parameters and some typical values are given in
Table 2 in the appendix.
• Motion Model: The movement of an agent follows a simple model where the instantaneous velocity vi (t) is a weighted sum of three components: (1) velocity at the previous
time, i.e. vi (t − 1), (2) a directed component guiding them to their home, (hi − xi (t − 1)),
where xi (t) is the agent location at time t, and (3) an independent Gaussian increment
σwi (t), wi (t) ∼ N (0, 1). Note that the motions of different agents are kept independent of
each other. The location hi ∈ D denotes the home unit (or stable state) of the ith person.
Using mathematical notation, the model for instantaneous position xi (t) and velocity vi (t)
of the ith agent are given by:
vi (t) = µ vi (t − 1) + α (1 − µ) (ht − xi (t − 1)) + σwi (t), 0 ≤ µ ≤ 1 ,
xi (t) = xi (t − 1) + δvi (t) .

(2)

Here α ∈ R+ determines how fast one moves towards their home, and µ quantifies the
degree to which one follows the directive to stay home. If µ = 0, then the person reaches
home and stays there, except for the random component wi . However, if µ = 0.5, then
a significant fraction of motion represents continuity in velocity, irrespective of the home
location. The value µ = 1 implies that either there is no lockdown or the person does not
follow the directive.
Reflecting Boundaries: When a subject reaches boundary of the domain D, the motion
is reflected and the motion continues in the opposite direction.

tions follow the prescribed motion model (Eqn. 2) with µ = 1 .
• Exposure-Infection Model: Infection of an agent depends on the level of exposure to
another infected person. Recall that mobile infected agents can only infect other mobile
agents while quarantined agents can only infect agents in the same household. Furthermore, this process is controlled by the following parameters:
– The separation between the subject and the infected person is less than r0 .
– The amount of exposure in terms of the number of time units is at least τ0 . We
use the cumulative time exposure over the whole history, rather than just the recent
history.
– Under these conditions, the probability of being infected at each time t is an independent Bernoulli random variable with probability pI .
• Recovery-Death Model: Once a subject is infected, we randomly assign a label immediately. Either an infected agent is going to recover (non-fatal type, or NFT) or the person
is eventually going to die (fatal type, or FT). The probability of having a fatal infection
given that a person is infection is pF . An agent with NFT label is further classified as
either Symptomatic (S) or Asymptomatic (AS) with a certain probability pS . All agents
with FT label are classified as symptomatic.
– Recovery: A subject with a non-fatal type (NFT) is sick at least for a period of
TR days. After this period, the person can recover at any time according a Bernoulli
random variable with probability pR .
– Fatality: A subject with a fatal type (FT) is sick for a period of TD days. After this
period, the person can die at any time independently according a Bernoulli random
variable with probability pD .

2.3

Chosen Parameter Values

A complete listing of the ALPS model parameters is provided in the Appendix in Table 2. In
this section, we motivate the values chosen for those parameters in these simulations. These
values are motivated by the current reports of COVID-19 pandemic. As argued in [14], a realistic
choice of parameters is very important in establishing validity of simulation models.
• Population Density: We have used a square domain of dimensions 2 miles × 2 miles
for a community with population of N agents. The value of N changes in different experiments. For N = 900, the model represents a population density of 225 people/mile2 . The
community contains h living units (buildings) with a domicile of N/h people per unit. In
case N/h is high (≈ 100), a unit represents a tall building in metropolitan areas, but when
N/h is small (≈ 5), a unit represents a single family home in a suburban area.
The time unit for updating configurations is one hour and occurrence of major events is
specified in days. For example, the lockdown can start on Day 1 and end on Day 30.

• Agent Speeds: The standard deviation for accelerations in agent mobility are approximately 1-5 feet/hour (fph). Through integration over time, this results in agent speeds
up to 1000 fph. We assume that ρ0 = 0.9 − 0.98, i.e. 90-98% of the people follow the
restriction directives.
• Infection Rates: The physical distance between agents to catch infection should at most
r0 ≈ 6f t and the exposure time should be at least τ0 = 5 time units (hours). The
probability pI of getting infected, under the right exposure conditions, is set at 5% at each
time unit (hour) independently. There is no current reference literature on selecting this
value, since it is difficult to measure precise exposure events for people who have tested
positive for COVID-19. While contact tracing [5] is being developed to ascertain infection
rates, there is no public data currently to measure this infection rate. This value leads to
overall infection rates that are similar to national and international infection rates [9].
• Fatality Rate: Once infected, the probability of having a fatal outcome is set at 5-10%,
according to the mortality rate listed by CDC [6]. The time period of recovery for agents
with non-fatal outcomes starts at 7 days. The probability of reaching full recovery for
those agents is pR = 0.001 at each subsequence time unit (hour). Similarly, for the agents
with fatal outcomes, the period of being infected is set to be 7 days and after that the
probability of death at each time unit (hour) is set to be pD = 0.1.
• Asymptomatic Infected Agents: The percentage of infected agents who remain asymptomatic is set to be in the range 15 − 40% [3, 18].

Model Validation

Although RAW-ALPS is perhaps too simple model to capture intricate dynamics of an actual
active society, it does provide an efficient tool for analyzing effects of countermeasures during
the spread of a pandemic. Before it can be used in practice, there is an important need to
validate it in some way.
As described in [15], there are several ways to validate a simulation model. One is to use real
data (an observed census of infections over time) in a community to estimate model parameters,
followed by a statistical model testing. While such data may emerge for COVID-19 for public use
in the future (especially with the advent of tracking apps being deployed in many countries),
there is currently no such agent-level data available for COVID-19. The other approach for
validation is to consider coarse population-level variables and their dynamics, and compare
them against established models such as SIR and its variations. We will perform validation of
RAW-ALPS in two ways.

Figure 4: The evolution of population-level infection measurements under a typical SIR model
(left), source: wikipedia) and the RAW-ALPS model (right). Visually, RAW-ALPS model is
able to generate infection curves with shapes similar to that of SIR model.

2.4.1

Qualitative Comparisons with SIR Model

As the first comparison, we study shapes of infection curves resulting from the RAW-ALPS model
and compare them qualitatively to the shapes resulting from SIR model. Fig. 4 shows plots
of the evolutions of global infection counts (susceptible, infection, recovered) in a community
under the well-known SIR model (on the left) and the proposed ALPS model (on the right).
In the ALPS model the counts for recovered and fatalities are kept separate, while in SIR
model these two categories are combined. One can see a remarkable similarity in the shapes of
corresponding curves and this provides a certain validation to the RAW-ALPS model. In fact,
given the dynamical models of agent-level mobility and infections, one can derive parameters of
the population-level differential equations used in the SIRD model. We pursue this topic in the
next section.

2.4.2

Estimation of SIRD Parameters

In this section we use data simulated from RAW-ALPS to fit the SIRD model given in Eqn. 1
and use estimated SIRD model parameters to provide interpretations. Re-arranging equations
in SIRD model (Eqn. 1), we get:

Since in our simulations, we have a small population size (N ), the number of dead agents
becomes a constant soon after any changes are complete, making D0 (t) = 0 for most of the
study. In order to focus on mortality rate in the active period, we modify the estimator of µ to
0 (t)
be: µ̂ = mean( DI(t)

Figure 6: SIRD parameter estimation from data simulated by RAW-ALPS for the case when
the restrictions are imposed on Day 5.

Fig. 5 shows an example of this estimation using data simulated from RAW-ALPS for an
unrestricted situation. The left plot shows the evolution of S/I/R/D functions under the chosen
simulation parameters. The infection reaches its peak around Day 26 and there are no uninfected
agents left after that. For this data, the estimated values of parameters are β̂ = 0.036281,
γ̂ = 0.000860, and µ̂ = 0.001005 (at hourly unit time). We clarify that the simulation is
updated at an hour unit but the final estimates of these rates are converted into daily time unit
to compare with published values. The basic reproduction number for this simulation comes out
to be R0 = β̂γ̂ = 42.1703.

example we see that the infection rate comes down significantly – from β̂ = 0.036281 to β̂ =
0.002860 when the restrictions are imposed. Similarly, the reproduction number comes down
from 42.1703 to 2.8458.

Exemplar Outcomes & Computational Cost

We illustrate the use of RAW-ALPS model by presenting outcomes under some typical scenarios.
Further, we discuss the computational cost of running RAW-ALPS on a laptop.

3.1

Examples from RAW-ALPS

We start by showing sample outputs of RAW-ALPS under some interesting settings. In these
examples, we use a relatively small number of agents (N = 1500) and household units (h = 289),
with T = 50 days, in order to improve visibility of displays.
1. Example 1 – No Restrictive Measures:
Fig. 7 shows a sequence of temporal snapshots representing the community at different
times over the observation period. In this example, the population is fully mobile over
the observation period and no social distancing restrictions are imposed. The snapshots
show the situations at 8, 17, 33, and 42 days. The corresponding time evolution of global
count measures is shown in the bottom right panel. The infection starts to spread rapidly
around the Day 5 and reaches a peak infection level of 78% around Day 17. Then the
recovery starts and continues until very few infected people are left. In this simulation,
the number of fatalities is found to be 6%.
2. Example 2 – Early Restrictions:
In the second example, a lockdown of infected agents is introduced on Day 5 and these
measures stay in place after that. The results are shown in Fig. 8. Once again we show
snapshots for situations at 8, 17, 33, and 42 days. The corresponding time evolution of
global count measures is shown in the bottom right panel. As the summary shows, an
early restriction of lockdown is very effective in controlling the spread of infection and the
peak infection rate is miniscule at 3%.
3. Example 3 – Early Restrictions but Removed Later:
In the next example, a full lockdown is introduced on Day 5 but removed on Day 30. The
results are shown in Fig. 9. In early snapshots, the population is under a lockdown and
the spread is minimal. By Day 33, the lockdown is released and the population is fully
mobile. Consequently, the infection begins to spread and by Day 42 the infection reaches
its peak value.
4. Example 4 – Later Restrictions :
In the last example, with results shown in Fig. 10, a full lockdown is introduced very late
(on Day 10). In this simulation run, the infection rate reaches a peak value of 80% despite
a lockdown. This is because the infection had already spread extensively in the population
by the time the lockdown starts.

3.2

Computational Complexity

The main computational cost in the simulation comes from the need to update the following
variables at each time t:
• Locations of each model according to their independent motion model;
• Pairwise distance matrix between Susceptible agents and Infected agents; and,
• Infection status of each agent according to the infection dynamics.
In general we obtain some efficiency by performing matrix operations, rather than using for
loops for these updates across agents. Additionally, we increase speed by maintaining a neighborhood for each agent and checking interactions only between the neighbors at each t.
Since computational efficiency of the simulator is of vital importance, we study the computational cost of running ALPS for different variable sizes. In these experiments, we note the
time taken by ALPS code on a McBook Pro laptop with Intel 2.8 GHz Core i7 processor and
16GB memory. In Fig. 11 we plot average run times (using five runs in a setting) of the code for
different values of N , h, and T . Recall that h is the number of households units, N is the number
of agents and T is the period length. From these results we are see that the computational cost
is linear in T , which makes sense. Keeping other variables fixed, the computational cost is super
linear in N . This is because an increase in N represents a higher density and increased infection
rates, thus requiring additional computations for tracking diseased agents. Interestingly, for the
range of parameter values studies here, the computational cost does not grow with an increase
in h. As an aside, we note that for N = 5000 and h = 1521, the run time for T = 100 days is
approximately 330s and for T = 150 days is approx. 484s.

Analyzing Effects of Lockdown Measures

There are several ways to utilize this model for prediction, planning and decision making. We
illustrate some of these ideas using examples.

4.1

Timing of Imposition of Full Lockdown

First, we study the effect of time of the full lockdown on the epidemic infections. In the following
simulations, we have used N = 1000 agents with h = 361 households in the scene domain [0, 2]2
miles. For the infection parameters, we use a contact radius r0 = 0.02 miles, contact period
τ0 = 5 hours and pI = 0.1. The motion parameters are: σ = 0.0002mph, µ = 0.02, and α = 0.1.
In each setting, we run the code 30 times and collection the simulation outputs.
Fig. 12 shows examples of RAW-ALPS outputs when a full lockdown is imposed on the
community but at different times. From top to bottom, the plots show lockdowns starting on
Day 2, Day 10, and Day 30, respectively, with the last row showing results for no lockdown.
Once the restrictions are imposed, they are not removed in these examples. As expected, the
best results are obtained for the earliest imposition of restrictions. In the case of no lockdown,
the peak infection rate in the population ranges from 60-80% which is a very high number for
a community. The fraction of fatalities ranges from 6-8% and the fraction of community that
is never infected is zero in all runs. In case the restrictions are imposed on Day 2, with all
other parameters held same, there is a remarkable improvement in situation. The peak infection
goes down to 2-3%, the fatalities decrease to 0.1-0.2% and the fraction of uninfected goes up to
98-99%. Thus, an early imposition of full lockdown measures helps significantly reduce infection
in the community.

4.2

Timing of Removal of Restrictions

In the next set of simulations, we study the effects of lifting restrictions and thus re-allowing
full mobility in the community. Some sample results are shown in Fig. 13. Each plot shows the
evolution for a different end time T1 , while the start time is kept fixed at T0 = 5. As these plots
indicate, the gains made by early imposition of restrictions are nullified when the restrictions
are lifted. In the case of early lifting of restrictions, the full population gets infected eventually.
Since we do no assume any change in the immunity levels of the agents over time, the results
from early lifting of restrictions are similar to not imposing any restrictions in the first place.
The results appear to be same except for being shifted in time.

4.3

Statistical Summaries

In the next set of experiments, we compute average values of some variables of interest using 30
runs of RAW-ALPS. In the first result, we study three variables – number of deaths, number of
people remaining uninfected, and the peak infection rate – using N = 1000 agents living in a
community of h = 361 households, observed over [0, 100] days. We vary the start time T0 (start
day of restrictions) from 2 to 30 and then to 100 and study the resulting outcomes. (The value
of T0 = 100 implies that the restrictions are never imposed in that setting.) Fig. 14 shows box
plots of the three varying with T0 with each row representing different type of lockdown.
The first column shows the median percentage fatalities in the population for different lockdown types. The second column shows the fraction of uninfected population and the last column
shows the peak infection rates. It can be seen that the results are very similar for a full lockdown
and a lockdown of infected agents, but the lockdown of only the symptomatic agents is quite

different. This last type of lockdown is found to be ineffective in containing the spread of the
infection, except for when T0 = 2. These results suggest that a lockdown on infected agents can
be an effective strategy in controlling the epidemic. Of course, given the asymptomatic nature
of the disease, it is not possible to ascertain the infection status precisely. One can only estimate
this status for a large population using accurate and extensive testing schemes.
In Fig. 15 we study the effect of changing T1 while T0 = 1 is kept fixed (and other experimental conditions being same as in the last experiment). The three panels show the fractions
of deaths (left), the number of uninfected (middle), and the peak infection rates (right). Each
curve in the panel corresponds to a different lockdown type: full LD or LD 1, infection LD or
LD 2, and symptomatic LD or LD 3. The results show that for LD1 and LD2, a delay in lifting
of the restrictions help control the epidemic quite effectively, while imposition of LD 3 is not as
effective in the process. Interestingly, these results show that LD2 is more effective than LD 1.
This maybe because in full lockdown the chances of susceptible agents co-inhabiting with the
infected agents increase and this in turn increases the infection rates.

Discussion & Conclusion

This paper develops an agent-based simulation model, called RAW-ALPS, for modeling spread of
an infectious disease in a closed community. A number of simplifying and reasonable assumptions
makes the RAW-ALPS efficient and effective for statistical analysis. The model is validated at
a population level by comparing with the popular SIR model in epidemiology.
It concludes that a lockdown of only the infected agents is the most effective kind. However, this includes both symptomatic and asymptomatic agents with the later ones not easily
detectable. This calls for regular and extensive testing of the population to isolate and restrict
all infected agents, while allowing for free movements of all uninfected agents. Further, these
results indicate that: (1) Early imposition of lockdown measures (right after the first infection)
significantly reduce infection rates and fatalities; (2) Lifting of lockdown measures recommences
the spread of the disease and the infections eventually reach the same level as the unrestricted
community; (3) In absence of any extraneous solutions (a medical treatment/cure, a weakening
mutation of the virus, or a natural development of agent immunity), the only viable option for
preventing large infections is the judicious use of lockdown measures.

Figure 13: Results from RAW-ALPS runs for a full lockdown starting at different times. From
top to bottom, the lockdowns are imposed later and later.

The strengths and limitations of RAW-ALPS model are the following. It provides an efficient
yet comprehensive modeling of the spread of infections in a self-contained community, using
simple model assumptions. The model can prove very useful in evaluating costs and effects of
imposing different types of social lockdown measures in a society. In the current version, the
initial placement of agents is set to be normally distributed with means given by their home
units and fixed variance. This variance is kept large to allow for near arbitrary placements of
agents in the community. In practice, however, agents typically follow semi-rigid daily schedules
of being at work, performing chores, or being at home. Thus, at the time of imposition of a
lockdown, the agents can be better placed in the scenes according to their regular schedules
rather than being placed arbitrarily.
In terms of future directions, there are many ways to develop this simulation model to capture
more realistic scenarios: (1) It is possible to model multiple, interactive communities instead
of a single isolated community. (2) One can include typical daily schedules for agents in the
simulations. A typical agent may leave home in the morning, spent time in the office during the
day, and return to home in the evening. (3) It is possible to provide an age demographics to
the community and assign immunity to agents according to their demographic labels [7]. (4) As
more data becomes available in the future, one can change immunity levels of agents over time
according to the spread and seasons. (5) In practice, when an agent is infected, he/she goes
through different stages of the disease, associated with varying degrees of mobility [21]. One
can introduce an additional variable to track these stages of infections in the model and change
agent mobility accordingly.
