COVID-19, City Lockdowns, and Air Pollution:
Evidence from China
GUOJUN HE, YUHANG PAN, AND TAKANAO TANAKA1
(APR 2020)
The rapid spread of COVID-19 is a global public health challenge. To prevent
the escalation of its transmission, China locked down one-third of its cities
and strictly restricted personal mobility and economic activities. Using timely
and comprehensive air quality data in China, we show that these counterCOVID-19 measures led to a remarkable improvement in air quality. Within
weeks, the Air Quality Index and PM2.5 concentrations were brought down by
25%. The effects are larger in colder, richer, and more industrialized cities. We
estimate that such improvement would avert 24,000 to 36,000 premature
deaths from air pollution on a monthly basis.

1. Introduction
The exponential spread of the COVID-19 pandemic is a global public health crisis. In
December 2019, an unknown disease, later named COVID-19, was identified in Wuhan,
China (Lu et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). Within three months, the disease had affected more
than 100 countries (WHO, 2020). The explosion of COVID-19 cases around the world has
made it a global pandemic and brought about devastating consequences (Wang et al., 2020).
To contain the virus, many countries have adopted dramatic measures to reduce human
interaction, including enforcing strict quarantines, prohibiting large-scale private and public
gatherings, restricting private and public transportation, encouraging social distancing,
imposing a curfew, and even locking down entire cities.
While the costs of enforcing these preventive measures are undoubtedly enormous, these
measures could unintentionally bring about substantial social benefits. Among them, locking
down cities could significantly improve environmental quality, which would partially offset
the costs of these counter-COVID-19 measures. For example, satellite images caught a sharp
drop in air pollution in several countries that have taken aggressive measures on the
transmission of the virus.2
In this study, we carry out a rigorous investigation into this issue and estimate how
locking down cities affected air quality at a national scale in China. We focus on China for
two reasons. First, China was hit hard by the COVID-19 outbreak, and the Chinese

For example, the satellite images show dramatic declines in NO2 in the U.S., China, and Europe:

government launched draconian countermeasures to prevent the escalation of infections
(Chen et al., 2020; Kucharski et al., 2020). Nearly one-third of Chinese cities were locked
down in a top-down manner, and various types of economic activities were strictly prohibited.
In these cities, individuals were required to stay at home; unnecessary commercial operations
and private and public gatherings were suspended; all forms of transportation were largely
banned (both within a city and across cities); and mandatory temperature checking could be
found in most public facilities. Second, China also suffers greatly from severe air pollution,
with some estimates suggesting that air pollution is associated with an annual loss of nearly
25 million healthy life years (Kassebaum et al., 2014). If locking down cities significantly
improved the air quality in China, the implied health benefits would be an order of magnitude
larger than in countries with lower initial pollution levels.
Our empirical analysis uses comprehensive data at a week-by-city level from January 1st
to March 1st in 2020. We first collect air quality data from 1,600 monitoring stations covering
all the prefectural cities in China and aggregate the station level data to the city level data. We
then collect the local government’s lockdown policies city by city from news media and
government announcements (Appendix Table A1). Because the disease prevalence varied
greatly across different regions, the terms and requirements of the lockdown also differed
across provinces and cities. Thus, we define a city as locked down when all three of the
following preventive measures were enforced: 1) prohibition of unnecessary commercial
activities in people’s daily lives, 2) prohibition of any types of gathering by residents, 3)
restrictions on private (vehicle) and public transportation. Following our definition, 95 out
of 324 cities were locked down, as described in Figure 1 (Summary Statistics is described in
Appendix Table A2).
We employ two sets of difference-in-differences (DiD) models to quantify the impact of

a city’s lockdown on air pollution in different groups of cities. The DiD model is a wellestablished econometric technique and has been widely applied in understanding the impacts
of government policies (Angrist and Pischke, 2008). In our DiD specification, the city-level
air pollution is as a function of the city-specific lock-down policy, city-specific fixed effects
that capture city-level time-invariant determinants of air pollution (e.g., geographical
conditions, baseline income), month by week fixed effects that capture shocks common to
all cities in a given week (e.g., nationwide holiday policy, macroeconomic conditions) and
weather conditions (see Appendix Methods). Adopting this method, we can estimate the
difference in air pollution levels between the treatment group (locked-down cities) and the
control group (non-locked-down cities) before and after city lockdowns in 2020. In addition,
because cities without formal lockdown policies might also have been affected by the disease
preventive measures (e.g., all cities extended the Spring Festival holiday, required social
distancing, and urged people to stay at home), we also apply the DiD model to compare air
pollution levels in the control (no-lockdown) cities before and after China’s Spring Festival
relative to the previous year.3 Combining these two sets of DiD results, we can evaluate the
total effects of city lockdown on air quality.
The underlying assumption for these DiD estimators is that treated and control cities
had parallel trends in the outcome before the event. Intuitively, even if the results show that
air quality improves in the locked-down city after its enforcement, the results may not be
driven by the lockdown but systematic differences in treatment and control cities (e.g.,
treatment cities have an improving trend in air quality). Thus, we adopt the event study
approach that allows for displacing the actual timing of lockdown to rule out these
possibilities (Jacobson et al. 1993).

The explosion of the COVID-19 cases coincided with the Festival, as illustrated in Appendix Figure A1.

We further examine whether the effects of lockdowns vary across different types of cities.
Because the lockdown restricts unnecessary industrial activities for people’s daily life,
industrialized cities could be more substantially influenced by such treatments. Similarly,
colder cities with higher demand for coal winter heating, richer cities with higher electricity
consumption, or cities with more traffic volumes might have a more substantial impact when
the lockdown is implemented.
Finally, a large strand of literature has investigated how air pollution affects population
health. Based on these findings, we provide some back-of-the-envelope calculations on the
potential benefits caused by air quality improvement during this period. To achieve this, we
borrow estimates from recent studies that adopt a quasi-experimental approach in China and
calculate the averted number of premature deaths. We focus on quasi-experimental studies
because they are generally recognized as being more credible than those based on
associational models (e.g., Graff Zivin and Neidell, 2013; Dominici et al., 2014). We then
discuss the magnitude of the effect and the implications.

2. Results
2-1. The Trends in Air Quality
We start by presenting the patterns in the raw air quality data. In Panel A of Figure 2, we
plot the AQI between the treatment and control cities over the study time in 2020. This
figure shows the first margin: to what extent city lockdown affected air pollution between
the treated and control cities. The figure shows the treatment group had worse air pollution
levels (higher AQI) than the control group before the Chinese Spring Festival. However, the
difference significantly decreased after more cities were locked down, suggesting that the
lockdown improved air quality.

In Panel B of Figure 2, we look at the second margin: to what extent the control cities
were also affected by the counter-virus measures. We see the AQI levels were almost
equivalent before the Spring Festival in 2019 and 2020, implying the parallel trend assumption
is likely to hold. In 2020, shortly after the festival, we observe that the air pollution levels
became slightly lower, relative to the 2019 post-festival season. This result suggests that air
quality in the control cities marginally improved, although they were not formally locked
down.
2-2. Impacts of City Lockdown on Air Pollution
Table 1 summarizes the regression results. Here, we estimate the relative change in air
pollution levels in the treatment group (locked-down cities) relative to the control group
(non-locked-down cities) by fitting the DiD model described in the equation (A1). We find
that a lockdown indeed improved the air quality: compared to cities without formal lockdown
policies, the weekly Air Quality Index (AQI) and PM2.5 declined respectively by 19.4 points
(18%) and 13.9 µg/m3 (17%) when including weather controls and a set of fixed effects (in
columns (2) and (4)).4 These estimates are remarkably robust to the inclusion of weather
variables, indicating that the changes in air pollution caused by city lockdown are not
correlated with weather conditions. We also provide the results for other air pollutants
(Appendix Table A3)
In Columns (5) to (8), we estimate the changes in air pollution levels in the control (nolockdown) cities before and after the Spring Festival relative to the previous year by fitting
the second DiD model described in the equation (A3). We find that air quality in 2020
improved relative to the previous year's air quality after the Festival. The results show that

The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a comprehensive measure of air pollution in China and also widely used
around the world. The index is constructed by PM2.5, PM10, SO2, CO, O3, and NO2 concentrations. A lower
AQI means better air quality.

AQI decreases by 8.8 points (7%) and PM2.5 by 8.4 (8%) after controlling for weather
variables (in column ((6) and (8)), suggesting that the disease preventive measures matter for
cities even without formal lockdown.
Combining these two sets of results, we estimate the total effects of city lockdown on
air quality relative to the identical season in the previous year. We find that lockdown
improved air quality substantially: it reduced AQI and PM2.5 by around 25% in the lockeddown cities and 7~8% in the control cities.
2-3. Tests for Pre-Treatment Prarallel Trends and Robustness Checks
We adopt the event study approach to test whether the parallel trend assumption holds,
which is an assumption for DiD estimators to be valid. (Refer to Appendix Method). Figure
3 reports the regression results. (The corresponding regression results are reported in
Appendix Table A4.) In Panel A, we estimate Equation (A2) and plot the estimated
coefficients and their 95% confidence intervals. We find that there is no systematic difference
in the trends between treatment and control groups before the city lockdown. The figure
shows that the estimated coefficients for the lead terms ( ! ≤ −2 ) are all statistically
insignificant. We also see that the trends break after the city lockdown, i.e., the lag terms (! ≥
0) became negative and statistically significant. The AQI dropped by 20~30 points within
two weeks after lockdown, and this result remains statistically significant in subsequent
periods.
In Panel B, we test the parallel trend assumption for cities in the control group using data
in 2019 and 2020. (The corresponding regression results are reported in Appendix Table
A5.) The results suggest the air quality in 2019 could be a reasonable counterfactual for air
quality in 2020 in the controlled cities; we find that their trends in air quality before the
Chinese Spring Festival were also similar. The estimated coefficients after the festival show a

meaningful reduction in air pollution, with the AQI being reduced by 5 to 10 points.
Appendix Figure A2 repeats the same exercise using log AQI, PM2.5, and log PM2.5 as the
outcomes, and we observe very similar patterns.
Finally, we provide additional evidence that our baseline findings are not driven by
specific choices we made in the empirical analyses. First, in Panel A in Appendix Table A6,
we exclude cities in Hubei province, where the COVID-19 was first identified in China, and
re-estimate Table 1. All the findings remain similar, suggesting that our results are not driven
by a few cities that were most affected by the virus. In Panel B, we repeat this exercise using
daily-level data and again reach a similar conclusion.
2-4. Heterogeneity
In Figure 4, we show that the effect of lockdown varies significantly across different
types of cities. The impact of city lockdown on air quality was greater in colder, larger, richer,
and more industrialized cities.
Panel A reveals that the impact is much more significant in colder cities or northern cities.
The estimated reduction in the AQI is around 20~30 points for those cities and is 0~10
points in warmer or southern cities. The difference could be driven by the fact that colder
cities consume more coal for heating, and lockdown reduces such consumption in offices,
plants, and schools, which led to a greater improvement in air quality. In Panel B, we see the
effect is greater in cities with larger GDP, population, and higher income (measured by per
capita GDP). This is consistent with the fact that energy consumption is higher in more
agglomerated economies, where a lot of economic activities take place. Finally, Panels C and
D show that, in the cities that rely more on industrial activities (measured by the
manufacturing output, the volume of traffic, the number of firms, and the emissions of
different types of pollutants), the effect is more substantial.

This finding implies that coal consumption, industrial activities, and transportation all
contribute substantially to air pollution in China. We repeat our heterogeneity analysis for
PM2.5 and similarly illustrate the results in Appendix Figure A3. Appendix Table A7 presents
the full set of results on AQI and PM2.5.
2-5. Potential Benefits from Improved Air Quality
A large strand of literature has investigated how air pollution affects population health.
Here, we provide some back-of-the-envelope calculations on the potential benefits of the air
quality improvement caused by China’s efforts to contain the virus.
The results are summarized in Table 2. Recall that the counter-COVID-19 measures
reduced PM2.5 in the control cities by 8.40 µg/m3, and the city lockdown further decreased
PM2.5 in the treated cities by 13.9 µg/m3(total 22.3 µg/m3). Two recent quasi-experimental
studies in China show that a 10 µg/m3 increase in PM2.5 would lead to a 2.2%~3.25% increase
in weekly/monthly mortality (He et al., 2020; Fan et al., 2020). 5 That implies, the total
number of averted premature deaths caused by the improvement in air quality would be
around 24,000 to 36,000 on a monthly basis. These numbers are significantly larger than the
total number of deaths caused by COVID-19 in China (less than 3,300 as of March 28, 2020)
(WHO, 2020) and illustrate the enormous social costs associated with air pollution.

3. Conclusion
Using a timely and comprehensive dataset, we investigate the effect of city lockdown on
air quality in China, which could bring about massive social benefits and partially offset the
costs of the COVID-19 epidemic. We find that such drastic preventive measures have a
significant impact on air quality. We estimated that air quality improved by around 25% (a

28.2 point decline for AQI, and 22.3µg/m3 for PM2.5) relative to the same season in 2019.
We also showed that, even in the control cities, where lockdown was not fully implemented,
air quality improved (AQI decreased by 8.8 points (7%) and PM2.5 by 8.4 µg/m3 (8%)). These
effects are much larger in more industrialized, richer, and colder cities.
The remarkable improvement in air quality could lead to substantial health benefits.
Based on the previous estimates on the relationship between air pollution and mortality, we
show that averted premature deaths per month could be around 24,000 to 36,000, which is
an order of magnitude larger than the number of deaths caused directly by COVID-19 in
China (WHO, 2020). Because air pollution also has significant impacts on morbidity,
productivity, and defensive (preventive) expenditures, our estimates should be interpreted as
the lower bound of the benefits that can be derived from air quality improvement.6
Our findings have important policy implications for China to mitigate air pollution. We
find that shutting down the unnecessary commercial activities reduces air pollution by around
25%, and the effects are even greater in cities with a larger economy, greater industrial
activities and traffic, and higher demand for coal heating. These results suggest that such
activities are indeed important sources of air pollution and provide a benchmark for future
environmental regulation and highlight the necessity to control emissions from these sources
when the business goes back to normal.
Meanwhile, although the air quality improvement during this period was unprecedented,
the air pollution levels during the lockdown remained high. For example, the PM2.5
concentration in locked down cities was still more than four times higher than WHO
considers safe (10 µg/m3 for the annual mean) (WHO, 2005), even though almost all non-

For example, the morbidity cost of air pollution is found to be around two-thirds of mortality costs in China
(Barwick et al., 2018).

essential production and business activities were suspended. This finding suggests that other
sources of air pollution continue to contribute significantly; in particular, the coal-fired
winter heating system could be the primary polluting source during our study period (Chen
et al., 2013; Ebenstein et al., 2017). Our research highlights that, without further reducing its
reliance on coal, it will be a real challenge for China to win its “war against pollution”
(Greenstone and Schwartz, 2018; Greenstone et al., 2020).
We conclude by pointing out two caveats of this study. First, we only consider the shortterm effects of city lockdown. As cities resume normal activities, the health benefits of air
quality improvement could be offset in the longer term. Second, our calculation of the
averted number of deaths is not based on actual mortality data, which are not yet available.
If COVID-19 or city lockdown affects mortality through other channels, the overall
mortality costs could be higher or lower, depending on how different channels are affected.
For example, medical resources in many cities ran short immediately after the disease
outbreak, thus patients could die because they were unable to receive timely and proper
treatment (Xie et al., 2020). The counter-virus measures also negatively affected the economy
and employment, which are detrimental to population health. In such cases, excess deaths
could be caused by economic consequences than were saved by reduced pollution. In
contrast, as the pandemic also signficantly increased individuals’ awareness of their health
conditions and made people practice good hygiene, the counter-virus measures might reduce
deaths from other diseases, particularly influenza.7 While estimating the overall mortality
impact of COVID-19 and city lockdown is beyond the scope of our paper, future research
For example, in Hong Kong, the number of deaths caused by influenza and the number of cases of
influenza-like illness were reduced by more than 50%, as compared to previous years:
https://www.ft.com/content/ad7ae6b4-5eab-11ea-b0ab-339c2307bcd4; in Japan, the influenza-like illness
cases in the first week of February were only about 30% compared to the same week a year ago:

Notes: The X-axis shows the estimated coefficients and their 95% confidence intervals.
Each row corresponds to a separate regression using a corresponding subsample. We use
the mean values to separate the “high” group from the “low” group for each pair of
heterogeneity analyses. For example, if a city's GDP is higher than the mean GDP, it falls
into a “high” GDP group. For temperature (colder or warmer group), we use data
measured in the first week of our study period. North and South are divided along the
Huai River. Other socio-economic data for the classification are measured in 2017. Each
regression implements the equation and controls for weather, city fixed effects, and monthby-week fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered at the city level.

change in PM2.5 concentration affects the mortality rate. Column (2) summarizes estimated changes in
PM2.5 in different types of cities based on Table 1. In Column (4), we obtain China’s annual death rate
from World Development Indicators and divide it by 12 to obtain the monthly death rate. As we do not
have city-level mortality rate, in this calculation, we assume that the baseline mortality rate is the same
across cities.

COVID-19, City Lockdowns, and Air Pollution: Evidence from China
GUOJUN HE, YUHANG PAN, AND TAKANAO TANAKA
Online Appendix
Appendix 1: Materials and Method
1-1.

Data Appendix

Air Quality Data: The air quality data is a high-frequency dataset covering seven major sets
of air pollutants. We obtain these data from the Ministry of Ecology and Environment.
The original dataset includes hourly readings on Air Quality Index (AQI), PM2.5, PM10,
SO2, O3, NO2, and CO from 1605 air quality monitoring stations covering all the
prefectural cities in China. Based on weights of the inverse of squared distance from the
station and city population center, we collapse the dataset to 324 cities at a weekly level.
Weather Data: Weather data includes temperature, precipitation, and snow. These data are
obtained from the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) from the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). We collapse data to a weekly citylevel dataset using the same methods as the air quality data.
Lockdown: We collect local governments’ lockdown information city by city from news media
and government announcements. Most of the cities’ lockdown policies were directly
issued by the city-level governments, while a few were promulgated by the provincial
governments. To improve policy compliance, civil servants and volunteers were assigned
to communities, firms, business centers, and traffic checkpoints. The local government
also penalized offenders if the rules were violated. There are some variations in rules and
degrees of the lockdown. For example, in some cities, individuals were not allowed to go
out (food and daily necessities were delivered to them), while in other cities, they could

go out if they did not have a fever. In this paper, we define lockdown when the following
three measures are all enforced: 1) prohibition of unnecessary commercial activities for
people’s daily lives, 2) prohibition of any type of gathering by residents, 3) restrictions
on private (vehicles) and public transportation. The primary dataset for lockdown is at a
daily level. Thus, we aggregate this to a weekly level. Here, we define treatment = 1 if
more than half of the days in the week were locked down. The timings of the cities’
lockdowns are presented in Appendix Table A1.
Socio-Economic Status: To explore the heterogeneity, we assemble the cities’ socio-economic
status from the 2017 China City Statistical Yearbook. It contains city-level statistics such
as GDP, population, industrial output, number of firms, amount of traffic, and pollutant
emissions.
Summary Statistics: We report the summary statistics of air pollution and weather variables
during this period in Appendix Table A2. The average AQI is 74, with a standard
deviation of 42. The PM2.5 concentration is 52 µg/m3, five times higher than the WHO
standard (10 µg/m3 for annual mean, and 25 µg/m3 for a daily mean). Cities that were
locked down were, on average, more polluted than the control cities before the
lockdowns. This is likely because Wuhan and its neighboring cities are generally more
polluted than cities that are far away. We also see a sharp decline in AQI after the
lockdown.

Method
Difference-in-Differences Model and Event Study
We use two sets of Difference-in-Differences (DiD) models to identify the impact of

counter-COVID-19 on air pollution. First, in our baseline regression, we estimate the relative
change in air pollution levels between the treated and control cities using the following

(A1)

where !"# represents the level of air pollution in city ( in month-by-week ) .
1['()* ,-'./-01]"# denotes whether a lockdown is enforced in city ( in month-by-week
), and takes the value one if the city is locked down and zero otherwise. 6"# are the control
variables, including temperature, temperature squared, precipitation, and snow depth. 8"
indicate city-fixed effects and 9# indicate month-by-week fixed effects.
The city fixed effects, 8" , which are a set of city-specific dummy variables, can control
for time-invariant confounders specific to each city. For example, the city’s geographical
conditions, short-term industrial and economic structure, income, and natural endowment
can be controlled by introducing the city fixed effects. The month-by-week fixed effects, 9# ,
are a set of dummy variables that account for shocks that are common to all cities in a given
week, such as the nationwide holiday policies, macroeconomic conditions, and the national
air pollution time trend.
As both location and time fixed effects are included in the regression, the coefficient 4
estimates the difference in air pollution between the treated (locked down) cities and the
control cities before and after the enforcement of the lockdown policy. We expect the
coefficient 4 to be negative, as the industrial and business activities were restricted in the
locked-down cities, and thus their air pollution levels should significantly decrease.
The underlying assumption for the DiD estimator is that treated and control cities had
parallel trends in the outcome before the lockdowns. To test this assumption, we conduct a
parallel trend test following Jacobson et al. (1993):

where 1['()* ,-'./-01]",#@ are a set of dummy variables indicating the treatment status
at different periods. The dummy for H = −1 is omitted in Equation (A2) so that the postlockdown effects are relative to the period immediately before the launch of the policy. The
parameter of interest 4 @ estimates the effect of city lockdown H weeks after the
implementation. We include leads of the treatment dummy in the equation, testing whether
the treatment affects the air pollution levels before the launch of the policy. Intuitively, the
coefficient 4 @ measures the difference in air quality between cities under lockdown and
otherwise in period . relative to the difference one year before the lockdown. We expect
lockdown would improve air quality with 4 @ being negative when . ≥ 0. If the parallel
trend assumption holds, 4 @ would be close to zero when . ≤ −2.
Even in a city that did not have a formal lockdown policy, people’s daily lives could still
be affected by the counter-virus measures. In fact, in all Chinese cities, the Spring Festival
holiday was extended, and people were advised to stay at home when possible, enforce social
distancing, and keep good hygiene. We examine this possibility by comparing the air pollution
changes between 2019 and 2020 for the same period (January 1st to March 1st) within the
control group. As the explosion of the COVID-19 cases coincided with China’s Spring
Festival (SF), we investigate whether the trend of air quality in 2020 differs from the trend
in 2019 after the festival, by fitting the following model:
!"#M = 1[NO ∗ 1(*PQR ≥ 2020)]"#M ∗ 4 + 6"#M ∗ 7 + 8" + 9# + :"#M

where ( denotes city, ) is month-by-week, and T represents year. 1[NU ∗ 1(*PQR ≥

Spring Festival in the year 2020, and zero otherwise. The estimated coefficient 4 would be
zero if the coronavirus and countermeasures do not affect control cities. As in Model (1),

fixed effects.
The identifying assumption for Model (3) is similar to Model (1). We require the trends
in air quality before the Spring Festival in 2019 to be similar to the trends in air quality in the
corresponding period in 2020 (i.e., the parallel trend assumption). We can test this
assumption analogously using Model (2). In all the regressions, we cluster the standard errors
at the city level.

Back-of-The-Envelope Calculations on Potential Health Benefits
We predict the reduced mortality from the improvement in air quality by calculating the
following equation:
Z "# ∗ [,Q\)('()* ∗ ]Q\P V^"# ∗ U-_`,Q)(-1"#
V-R)Q,()*"# = ∆XY

(A4)

Z "#
where V-R)Q,()*"# represents estimated saved deaths in city ( in month ), and ∆XY
indicates an estimated change in air quality from Equations (A1) and (A3) in city ( in month
), where we assume the effect of lockdown on air quality is identical within the treatment
group and within the control group. We borrow the [,Q\)('()* estimates from existing
studies that measure the effect of air quality on mortality; this represents the change in
number of deaths in response to a one-unit change in air quality. ]Q\P V^"# represents the
base mortality rate, and U-_`,Q)(-1"# denotes the population in city ( in week ). The
computations are summarized in Table 2 in the main text.
For [,Q\)('()* estimates, we focus on studies that meet the following two criteria. First,
we rely on quasi-experimental studies that investigate how exogenous changes in air quality
affect health outcomes. Because the air pollution variation could be confounded by factors
that also affect population health, the estimates from quasi-experimental studies are generally
recognized as being more credible than those based on associational models (e.g., Graff Zivin

and Neidell, 2013; Dominici et al., 2014). Second, we focus on the most recent research in
China. Because the effects of air pollution on mortality could depend on the baseline
pollution levels, income, and institutional quality, studies using data from earlier years may
be less relevant to our research context (Arceo et al., 2014; Cheung et al., 2020).
We search for the literature and identify two studies that meet both criteria: He et al.
(2020) use seasonal agricultural straw burning as the instrumental variable for PM2.5, and
estimate how PM2.5 affects mortality; and Fan et al. (2020) examine how turning on the coalfired winter heating system affects weekly mortality.8 These studies estimate that a 10 µg/m3
increase in PM2.5 would lead to a 2.2%~3.25% increase in mortality, which is largely
consistent with a recent quasi-experimental study in the U.S. (Deryugina et al., 2020).9

A few other studies also use quasi-experimental approaches to estimate the impacts of air pollution on
mortality in China, including Chen et al. (2013), He et al. (2016), and Ebenstein et al. (2017). However, these
studies are less relevant to our research context because they use data from at least a decade ago and focus on
coarse measures of air pollution, such as total suspended particles (TSP), or on PM10.
9 We summarize the related studies in Appendix Table A8. We see that quasi-experimental studies find larger
effects on mortality than associational studies.

A 10-µg/m3 increase in PM2.5 concentrations is associated with a 0.38%
increase in total mortality.
A 10-µg/m3 increase in two-day average PM2.5 concentrations is associated
with a 0.6-0.9% increase in all-cause mortality in rural China.
A 1.21% increase in all-cause mortality is associated with a 10-µg/m3 increase
in the previous day's PM2.5 concentrations.
For every 10-µg/m3 increase in PM2.5 exposure, PM-related mortality
increases by 2.8%.
A 10-µg/m3 increment in PM2.5 is associated with a 1.04% increase in the risk
of death. The substantial regional variation is observed around the globe.
