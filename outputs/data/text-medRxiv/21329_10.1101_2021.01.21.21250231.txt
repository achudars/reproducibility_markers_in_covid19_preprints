Abstract

33

The COVID-19 disease, caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2

34

(SARS-CoV-2), is a very contagious disease that has killed many people around the world.

35

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) data, the spread of the disease appears to be

36

slower in Africa. Although a number of studies have been published on the relationship between

37

meteorological parameters and COVID-19 transmission, the effects of climate conditions on

38

COVID-19 remain largely unexplored and without consensus following the main research finding

39

over Africa (often based on a single country or city). Here, using available epidemiological data

40

over 275 days (i.e., from March 1 to November 30, 2020) taken from the European Center for

41

Disease Prevention and Control of the European Union database and daily data of surface air

42

temperature and humidity from the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), this

43

paper investigates the potential contributions of climate conditions on COVID-19 transmission over

44

16 countries selected from three bioclimatic regions of Africa (i.e., Sahel, Maghreb and Gulf of

45

Guinea). On average, our main findings highlight statistically significant inverse correlations

46

between COVID-19 cases and temperature over the Maghreb and the Gulf of Guinea regions,

47

whereas positive correlations are found in the Sahel, especially over the central part including Niger

48

and Mali. Correlations with specific humidity and water vapor parameters display significant and

49

positive values over the Sahelian and the Gulf of Guinean countries and negative values over the

50

Maghreb countries. In other word, results imply that the COVID-19 pandemic transmission is

51

influenced differently across the three bioclimatic regions: i) cold and dry environmental conditions

52

over the Maghreb; ii) warm and humid conditions over the Sahel iii) cold and humid conditions

53

over the Gulf of Guinea. These findings could be useful for decision-makers who plan public health

54

and control measures in affected African countries and would have substantial implications for

55

directing respiratory disease surveillance activities.

Introduction

67

The coronaviruses constitute a family of various viruses affecting both humans and animals.

68

In late December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) was informed about an epidemic of

69

"pneumonia of unknown cause" detected in the city of Wuhan (Hubei Province, China), the

70

seventh-largest city in China, with 11 million inhabitants [1,2]. The first reported infected

71

individuals were associated to the Wuhan seafood market in southern China. The virus causing the

72

epidemic was quickly determined to be a novel coronavirus linked to the Middle Eastern

73

Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome

74

Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [3]. Infected travelers, mainly by aircraft, are known to be

75

responsible for the introduction of the virus outside Wuhan [4]. The novel coronavirus so-called

76

2019-nCoV in the early parts of the epidemic has spread rapidly to multiple countries and has been

77

declared on March 11, 2020, as a pandemic by the WHO. The 2019-nCoV terminology changed

78

later and become Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

79

Researchers who have been working on this epidemic believe that this coronavirus probably

80

originates from bats [5,6]. This hypothesis is based on the SARS epidemic in 2003 that emerged in

81

southern China after being transmitted from the bat, its "natural reservoir", to humans [7]. Indeed,

82

the COVID-19 disease shares 80% of genetic similarity [7]. The infection caused a wide range of

83

symptoms and showed different degrees of severity with different fatality rates that are country

84

dependent. Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus [8]. People with these

85

symptoms or combinations of symptoms may have cough and shortness of breath or difficulty

86

breathing. Transmission can take place by air, in contact with secretions or contaminated objects.

87

The mortality rate is found to be relatively lower compared to SARS-Cov which was estimated

88

around 15% [8]. The most sensitive people are the elderly, those suffering from respiratory and

89

immunosuppressed pathologies.

90
91

One of the central questions facing the scientific community is how climate conditions

92

contribute to COVID-19 transmission. Chan et al.,[9] investigations on the past SARS coronavirus

93

outbreaks have put in evidence that the viability of the virus was lost at high temperatures (e.g.,

94

38°C) and high humidity (e.g., > 95%) and this explains the lower number of cases in Asian

95

countries including Malaysia due to higher temperature and humidity. The first studies from China

96

have shown that the contagiousness of the COVID-19 is higher in the cities in the north with a

97

lower humidity value and lower temperatures than those over the south-eastern coasts with warm

98

and humid conditions [10,11]. Meteorological variables such as air temperature, humidity, and other

99

parameters including solar radiation have been also found to act differently concerning coronavirus

100

survival [12]. Although several studies have supported the hypothesis that climate conditions may

101

affect the COVID-19 pandemic transmission as happens with other viruses such as influenza

102

[13,14], respiratory syncytial virus [15,16], considerable disagreement is evident among the

103

different investigations (often based on different country or city); most of them have concluded that

104

the COVID-19 transmission prefers cold and dry weather conditions - i.e. temperature and humidity

105

related variables are negatively correlated to the virus transmission [12,17–22] and [23] (for a

106

review) -, while others studies have reported contradictory results showing that temperature and/or

107

humidity variables may positively associated, or not be associated with the COVID-19 expansion

108

[24–28]. The majority of the above-mentioned papers were focused on Asian and European

109

countries (i.e., mid-latitude regions). Few studies have investigated the effects of weather conditions

110

on the incidence of COVID-19 pandemic transmission over Africa and the results have even less

111

consensus (often based on a single country or city) [29–31].

112

In addition, it is worth pointing out that since the first cases of coronavirus appeared in Africa

113

(early March 2020), the spread of the disease seems to be progressing more slowly there than else-

114

where. The five most affected countries at this time are South Africa, Algeria, Morocco, Egypt, and

115

Cameroon, with a very slow infection rate compared to the mid-latitudes or south America countries

116

(see, Fig 1). Nevertheless, it is still not fully understood how climate conditions contribute to

117

COVID-19 transmission in Africa.

118

The outlined scenario shows that further studies and reviews are needed to extend the analysis

119

available in literature and to quantify the possible relationship between climate conditions and

120

coronavirus transmission in Africa. To address these issues, here, using available epidemiological

121

data over 275 days (1 March - November 30, 2020) extracted from the European Center for Disease

122

Prevention and Control of the European Union (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-

123

data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide) and daily data of

124

surface air temperature and humidity from the National Center for Environmental Prediction

125

(NCEP), the present study aimed to investigate the potential contributions of climate conditions on

126

COVID-19 pandemic transmission in 16 highly populated West and North African countries divided

127

into three bioclimatic regions (i.e., Maghreb, Sahel and Gulf of Guinea) [32].

128

The present work is organized as follows: Section 2 outlines the data used and the statistical

129

methods applied. Section 3 investigates the spatial distribution of COVID-19 confirmed cases

130

throughout countries in North and West Africa and their potential relationship with climate condi-

131

tions. Finally, a summary and discussion of the main findings are provided in Section 4.

133

Surveillance COVID-19 data

134

The clinical data corresponds to the number of COVID-19 cases over 16 West and North

135

African countries recorded by the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control of the

136

European Union, and all age-groups were screened (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-

137

data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide). The countries were

138

selected based on their high population density and the regularity of the reported daily positive

139

cases. The selected countries include the Maghreb countries (Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco and

140

Tunisia), the Sahelian countries (Burkina-Faso, Mali, Niger and Senegal) and Gulf of Guinea

141

countries (Ivory Coast, Ghana, Guinea Conakry, Liberia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Togo). Note, the

142

number of observed COVID-19 cases is available for the selected countries from March 1 to

143

November 30, 2020 and datasets are obtained at country level. These cases are clinically confirmed

144

by the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tests, as recommended by the WHO.

145

Climate dataset

146

Due to the lack of recent continuous observed weather station datasets over the selected

147

countries, reanalysis climate datasets are used. Reanalysis is a systematic approach to produce

148

datasets for climate monitoring and research [33]. We use daily data of surface air temperature,

149

relative humidity, and specific humidity from NCEP datasets provided by the NOAA [33] with

150

2.5°× 2.5° horizontal resolution over the North and West Africa. Besides those variables, the Water

151

Vapor variable (WV; g/kg) is estimated following [11,14,34–40] methodology (see equation 1),

152

where RH represents the relative humidity, T the air temperature, and P the atmospheric pressure.

153

Note the climate variables for the period from February 15 to November 30, 2020 (i.e., 15 days

154

before the first reported COVID-19 cases) are selected in the analysis to take into consideration the

155

virus incubation period not considered in many investigations over Africa [29,30,41]. In other term,

156

because of 97.5% of the infected people develop symptoms after 11 days of incubation [42], climate

157

variables are 15-days back time-shifted. This imply that the daily number of positive COVID-19

158

cases from 1 March 2020 to 30 November 2020 are the result of infections that happened from 15

159

February 2020 to 15 November 2020. This approach is inspired to [43].

Africa through the northern part is mainly characterized by different types of climates [44], as

164

we mentioned above, the selected countries were divided into three contrasted bio-climate zones

165

based on a classification that closely fits with Köppen-Geiger bio-climatic zones [32,45]:

166

i)

the Maghreb (North Africa) countries are mainly characterized by winter rains and

167

summer drought [46]. The rainfall regime is variable but predominantly bimodal in north

168

part, with fall and spring peaks. The rainy seasons correspond with the short days–cool

169

temperature period (from November to April). This category includes hyper-humid to

170

hyper-arid bioclimates, with mean annual rainfalls of 2,330 mm over the North East of

171

Algeria, and 1,530 mm over the North West of Tunisia [32] decreasing to virtually zero

172

in the central–eastern Sahara. Mean annual temperature may vary from less than 10°C in

173

the highlands of Algeria and Morocco to 25 °C in the north and central Sahara [32];

174

ii)

the Sahel region represents a transition zone between the Saharan desert and the wet

175

climate of tropical Africa. The Sahelian countries have a tropical semi-arid climate

176

which is typically hot, sunny, dry and somewhat windy. The bio-climate is characterized

177

by a monomodal (unimodal) type of rainfall distribution pattern, i.e., there is only one

178

annual peak in the rainy season, lagged with the summer solstice by a 1–2-month time

179

lag [32,45];

180

iii)

the Gulf of Guinea with equatorial bio-climate, always humid, are characterized by a

181

bimodal rainfall distribution pattern (i.e., there are two peaks in the rainy season

182

following the seasonal position Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ)), although some

183

particular climatic characteristics can be found in countries like Nigeria with hot-dry,

184

hot-humid, temperate-dry, temperate-humid, and temperate-dry with a cool climate [47].

185
186

Statistical Analysis

187

Two non-linear robust and non-parametric rank correlation tests were implemented to analyze the

188

potential effects of the climate conditions on the COVID-19 pandemic transmission and to discuss

189

their statistical significance:

190

(i) the Kendall rank correlation non-parametric test

191

represents the number of concordant pairs, while discor represents the discordant pairs, and n is the

192

number of pairs [48].

197

Note more descriptions of the statistical methods used can be found in [42,47]. Nevertheless, it is

198

worth pointing out that values of τ and rs equal to +1 and -1 implying a perfect positive and negative

199

association/correlation, respectively. The main reason for using the non-parametric Kendall and

200

Spearman statistical test is that it tends to be more powerful and better suited for non-normally

201

distributed variables compared with parametric statistical tests such as the Pearson test [48]. As the

202

distribution of COVID-19 cases data and climate variables are not necessarily Gaussian, the non-

203

parametric Kendall and Spearman statistical tests might be more appropriate for testing the null

204

hypothesis of the association/correlation between the two given variables [49,50].

205

In addition, the correlation coefficients are often computed between two time series (e.g., two time

206

series representing, respectively, the number of daily COVID-19 cases and daily average

207

temperatures or humidity) [29–31], without taking into account for the possible presence of cycles

208

or temporal trends in the data, which can strongly affect the estimated correlation values and yield

209

artefactual associations. In the present paper, the daily cases of COVID-19 are fitted with the robust

210

and non-parametric Median-Based Linear Model (MBLM) defined in [49]. As it can be easily

211

observed (see section next section) that the COVID-19 cases data does not follow a Gaussian

212

distribution, however as discussed above, the non-parametric MBLM model might be more

213

powerful and better suited compared with parametric linear models [49].

214

Results and Discussion

215

Spatio-temporal variability of COVID-19 cases

216

Fig 2 shows the patterns of the total number of COVID-19 confirmed cases between March 1,

217

to November 30, 2020 over all the considered countries. It becomes obvious that the COVID-19

218

pandemic transmission varies in di erent regions during the study time period. The highest

219

outbreak ranging up to more than ~300000 cases is located in the Maghreb countries mainly

220

including Morocco and Egypt. The number of COVID-19 cases ranges between 5000 to 10000

221

cases in the Sahelian countries and 50000 to 200000 cases in the Gulf of Guinea countries. The

222

lowest number of cases is observed over in the central of the Sahel.

223
224

Fig 3 further shows that more occurrences of COVID-19 cases are observed over the northern

225

part of Africa in Maghreb countries compared to the Sahel and the Gulf of Guinea. Fig 3A, with y-

226

axis is capped at ~400000 COVID-19 cases for Morocco and 80000 for the other northern

227

countries, shows a rapid spread of COVID-19 cases in the Maghreb with the largest trend for

228

Morocco and Egypt. Until the end of July, the evolution of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Tunisia,

229

and Libya was very slow, but a rapid increase is also noted since August. For the Maghreb, it is only

230

in Libya that very few COVID-19 cases are recorded, Tunisia does not exceed 1000 cases in three

231

months and a half, while the maximum number of cases are developed in the Maghreb countries

232

like Egypt, Algeria, and Morocco. In Fig 3B related to the Sahel; the largest number of COVID-19

233

cases are observed in Senegal with a rapid expansion since the pandemic start. A stationary situation

234

was observed since mid-September. A more homogeneous distribution is found between the rest of

235

Sahelian countries (Fig 3B) where the y-axis could be capped at 3000 COVID-19 cases instead of

236

15000 cases like in Senegal. In the Gulf of Guinea (Fig 3C) with COVID-19 approaching 50000 in

237

Ghana and 70000 cases in Nigeria after night months of the pandemic. Some small West African

238

countries such as Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Togo have cumulated COVID-19 cases less than 1000

239

cases, while some countries such as Ivory Coast and Guinea Conakry exhibit an intermediate

240

situation. For the 3 subzones, the first two months of the time period are marked by overall flat

241

curves of the cumulated COVID-19 cases.

242

In Fig 4, we compare the fitted COVID-19 cases with MBLM model to the daily observed

243

cases for each of the three bio-climatic regions. The residuals with respect to the reported data (i.e.,

244

the differences between the MBLM fitted curve and the observed curve) are considered.

245

Considering the residuals, makes the analysis independent on the period of lockdown or restriction,

246

being the correlation analysis strongly dependent on the considered time period. The MBLM model

247

accounts for the natural trend of viral epidemies and the effect of the lockdown on it. This approach

248

is also followed in [43]. Thus, the residual analysis should preserve from spurious correlations

249

between the above-mentioned effects and the parameters under analysis. The Spearman and Kendall

250

rank correlations have been then computed between the residuals of COVID-19 cases with respect

251

to the MBLM model, extrapolated from the data trend, and the detrended anomaly of the

252

meteorological parameters with 15 days back time-shifted to take into account the virus incubation

253

period as discussed above.

254
255

Although a number of studies have considered the relationship between meteorological

256

parameters and positive COVID-19 cases, it worth pointing out that the daily new positives variable

257

is highly correlated to the number of performed test, i.e., the more the test performed, the more

258

positives COVID-19 cases are found. In addition, delays in processing tests and false

259

positives/negatives, being not uncommon and frequently reported, are factors that might introduce a

260

bias in the analysis. For this reason, daily spikes in cases, without considering the incubation period,

261

can be totally uncorrelated with the climate variables as discussed in [40].

262

Spatio-temporal variability of climate parameters

263

Fig 5 shows the seasonal patterns of climate parameters including temperature, specific humidity

264

and water vapor variables through the North and West Africa. A strong seasonal temperature regime

265

(with high-temperature values during JJA and lower temperature values during September-

266

November) associated with a slight seasonal humidity regime is observed. Comparing the seasonal

267

patterns of climate parameters across the three seasons (i.e., during MAM, JJA, and SON), the

268

highest values of temperature are located over the North part of the Sahel during summer (Fig 5A),

269

while the lowest values are found over the Gulf of Guinea countries (Fig 5B). The low values of

270

humidity and water vapor are found in the Northern area up to the central part of the Sahel (Figs

271

5D, E and F). In the Gulf of Guinea part, the temperature decreased from March to August, while

272

the specific humidity and water vapor increased (Figs 5B-5H) mainly due to the fact that the Gulf of

273

Guinea area usually received substantial rains sustaining associated with high humidity and lower

274

temperatures. Whilst over Sahelian countries, low values of humidity are observed compared to the

275

Gulf of Guinea part, with a wetter period in summer associated with the northward shift of the main

276

tropical rainfall band. Over the Maghreb countries, a well-marked cool period is observed during

277

the spring and is associated with a slight decreasing of humidity and water vapor content. These

278

seasonal climate conditions may differently contribute to enhancing/reducing COVID-19 pandemic

279

transmission across the different considered regions.

280

In Fig 6, the daily COVID-19 cases anomaly (residuals) with respect to the climate parameters

281

over the three bio-climatic zones are shown. In the Maghreb, the positive anomalies of the daily

282

COVID-19 cases are clearly observed when the climatic parameters (i.e., temperature, humidity and

283

water vapor) have simultaneously a downward trend as at the beginning and towards the end of the

284

time period (Figs 6A and B). However, for the Sahel (Figs 6C and D) and the Gulf of Guinea (Figs

285

6E and F), the positive anomalies of COVID-19 cases are found during the summer, when these

286

regions experience a high value of humidity and water vapor.

287

In S1 Table, the daily variation of the meteorological parameters is also shown, together with a

288

statistical analysis. It can be noticed that the mean temperature in Maghreb countries was

289

25.86±6.24°C (mean± Standard deviation) with low humidity of around 7.51±1.60 (g/kg) and water

290

vapor around 13.18±3.40 (g/kg). Over the Sahel, the mean temperature was estimated 29.96 2.76

291

°C with high amount humidity (12.65±5.23; g/kg) and water vapor (20.72±8.37 g/kg) two times

292

larger compared to the Maghreb countries. In the Gulf of Guinea, the mean temperature was also

293

estimated 27.39±2.16 °C with high amount of humidity (17.67±2.89; g/kg) and water vapor

294

(27.50±4.21; g/kg) during the considered period (i.e., from March 1, to November 30, 2020).

295

Relationship between COVID-19 and climate parameters

296

The contribution of the meteorological variables (temperature, humidity and water vapor) on the

297

COVID-19 pandemic transmission in Africa were investigated and correlation coefficient values are

298

estimated using the robust and non-parametric Kendall (τ) (Fig 7) and Spearman (S1 Fig in

299

supplementary material) rank tests. In Fig 7 (and in S1 Fig), the statistically significant correlations

300

with 99% confidence intervals, that is, correlations that passed the Kendall/ Spearman rank tests at

301

0.01 level (i.e., p < 0.01; 99% C.I), are reported in green dots and those that passed the

302

Kendall/Spearman rank tests at 0.05 level (i.e., p < 0.05; 95% C.I), are reported in black dots. As

303

described above, the correlation is investigated against the residual of COVID19 cases with a time-

304

shift of 15 days, i.e., meteorological data from 15 February 2020 to 15 November 2020 and daily

305

number of positive COVID-19 cases from 1 March 2020 to 30 November 2020 to take into

306

consideration the incubation period. Note, we have chosen to show the correlation values calculated

307

with Kendall test in Fig 7, because it is more insensitive to error and discrepancies in data, with p-

308

values more accurate than Spearman’s rho test [48].

309

Fig 7 (top panel) highlights that statistically significant inverse correlations (i.e. with p < 0.01;

310

99% C.I ) are clearly found between COVID-19 cases and surface air temperatures over most of the

311

Maghreb countries (Tunisia, Morocco and Libya) and in all of the Gulf of Guinea countries except

312

Togo, while significant positive correlations (i.e. with p < 0.01; 99% C.I ) between COVID-19 cases

313

and surface air temperature are found in the Sahel, especially over the central part including Niger

314

and Mali. Despite positive correlations between COVID-19 cases and surface air temperature were

315

found in some specific Maghreb countries such as Egypt and Algeria mainly due to the dry hot

316

weather associated with higher temperatures exceeding 38°C in Egypt and Algeria’s southern

317

regions located in the north and central Sahara as shown in Figs 5A and 5C. Nevertheless, on

318

average, statistically significant inverse correlations between COVID-19 cases and temperature are

319

highlight over the Maghreb and the Gulf of Guinea, whereas positive correlations are found in the

320

Sahel.

321

Considering the correlations with humidity and water vapor parameters, the Fig 7 (middle and

322

bottom panels) display significant and negative values over all the Maghreb countries and positive

323

values is most countries over the Gulf of Guinea. Over the Sahel, the significant and high positive

324

correlations (τ=0.6, p < 0.01; 99% C.I) are observed over Senegal where the highest transmission of

325

the COVID-19 pandemic are reported (Fig 3B), while negative and non-significant correlations can

326

be observed in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger. Comparing S1 Fig (i.e., correlation values calculated

327

with Spearman rank test) and results shown in Fig 7 (i.e., Kendall rank test versus Spearman rank

328

test), our results are even more robust because all correlations have the same sign. The magnitude of

329

correlations is however lower in the Kendall test mainly because of its high insensitivity to error

330

and discrepancies in datasets compared to Spearman rank test.

331
332

On the other hand, given the average, our results highlight that the COVID-19 pandemic

333

transmission is differently affected across the three bioclimatic regions:

334

i) cold and dry environmental conditions over the Maghreb; these results imply that over the

335

Maghreb countries, the COVID-19 transmission is strongly influenced by a decrease of

336

temperature that connects to a decrease of humidity and water vapor content. These results

337

confirm previous findings [11,12,12,17,18,20–22,38,51,52], that virus transmission is

338

enhanced by cold and dry climates conditions and may partly explain the high number of

339

COVID-19 pandemic transmission observed in autumn over the Maghreb countries (Fig 4A,

340

Fig 6B and S2A Fig).

341

ii) warm and humid conditions over the Sahel; these results highlight that over the Sahel, the

342

COVID-19 pandemic transmission prefers warm and humid environmental conditions. In

343

other words, COVID-19 is strongly influenced by an increase in temperature associated with

344

an increase in humidity and water vapor. Such findings contrast with the results found over

345

the Maghreb countries and other studies suggesting that summer weather could reduce

346

COVID-19 transmission [53] but confirm some previous findings (e.g. [54]), and may partly

347

explain the high number of COVID-19 pandemic transmission (i.e. the peak) experienced in

348

most countries during the period May-August (Figs 4B and S2B Fig).

349

iii) relatively cold and humid conditions over the Gulf of Guinea; these results highlight that

350

the COVID-19 transmission over the Gulf of Guinea countries is enhanced by a decrease of

351

temperature associated with an increase of humidity and water vapor. In other words,

352

COVID-19 transmission is strongly enhanced by cooler and humid climates conditions.

353

Such findings also confirm the previous findings (e.g.,[25,26]) and may explain the

354

observed peak of the COVID-19 cases experienced in the Gulf of Guinea countries during

355

the period May-August (Fig 4C and Fig 6E and S2C Fig).

356

Conclusions

357

An extension of the analysis available in literature for the quantification of the relationship between

358

climatic variables and COVID-19 pandemic transmission in North and West Africa is presented in

359

this paper. The contributions of climate conditions on the COVID-19 transmission have been

360

studied in 16 most highly populated West and North African countries divided into three bioclimatic

361

regions (i.e., the Maghreb, the Sahel and the Gulf of Guinea) based on Köppen bioclimatic

362

classification [32]. The correlation between the basic meteorological variables and virus

363

transmission over 275 days was investigated from March 1, 2020 to November 30, 2020 at each of

364

the considered country and at regional level. To assess the correlation, differently from other studies

365

[29–31], here, we considered as a reliable variable the residuals of the daily new positive cases with

366

respect to the robust and non-parametric Median-Based Linear Model (MBLM) defined in [49].

367

Further, when working on the residuals, makes our analysis independent on the analyzed time

368

period. Also, we have taken into consideration the incubation period, i.e., the correlations were

369

investigated against the residual of COVID-19 cases with a time-shift of 15 days, - i.e.,

370

meteorological data from 15 February 2020 to 15 November 2020 was used in the analysis. The

371

strongest finding of this paper is that the COVID-19 pandemic transmission is differently affected

372

across the three bioclimatic regions. First of all, over the Maghreb countries, our results highlight

373

that the COVID-19 transmission is strongly enhanced by a decrease of temperature associated with

374

a decrease of humidity and water vapor, i.e., cold and dry environmental conditions. Such findings

375

are consistent with previous studies available in the literature [11,12,17,18,20–22,30,38,52,55]

376

supporting the hypothesis that COVID-19 transmission prefers cold and dry weather conditions,

377

while more robust because they are often limited on a single country or city and/or considering a

378

short period of COVID-19 reported data. Over the Sahel, our results show that the COVID-19

379

pandemic transmission prefers warm and humid climate conditions. In other words, the virus

380

transmission is strongly influenced by an increase in temperature associated with an increase in

381

humidity and water vapor. Such findings contrast with the studies suggesting that summer weather

382

could reduce COVID-19 transmission (e.g.[53]) but are consistent with some previous studies

383

available in the literature (e.g. [54]) and [23] (for a review), and may partly explain the high number

384

of COVID-19 cases experienced in most of Sahelian countries during the period May-August (Fig

385

4B and S2B Fig). Finally, over the Gulf of Guinea, cold and humid conditions are found to enhance

386

the COVID-19 transmission. In other words, COVID-19 transmission is strongly enhanced by a

387

decrease of temperature associated with an increase of humidity and water vapor. Such findings also

388

confirm the previous findings available in the literature (e.g. [25,26]) and may related to the

389

observed peak of number cases experienced in most of the Gulf of Guinea countries during the

390

period May-August (Fig 4C and Fig 6E and S2C Fig).

391
392

Another important aspect of this paper is that this is, to our knowledge, the first work based in three

393

bioclimatic regions (i.e., the Maghreb, the Sahel and the Gulf of Guinea) using COVID-19 datasets

394

reported over 275 days (i.e., 09 months) and investigating the correlation against the residual of

395

COVID-19 cases with a time-shift of 15 days, i.e., taking into consideration the incubation period.

396

The results from this analysis suggest that further studies are needed to investigate why in three

397

considered bioclimatic regions, the virus transmission is differently affected by the climate

398

conditions. These results can promote further studies in other bioclimatic regions testing also the

399

effects of air-pollution related variables, such as the concentration of the Particulate Matter with an

400

aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 micron (PM2.5), the Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) and Carbon

401

Monoxide. Therefore, this work contributes to increasing attention and encourages further studies to

402

improve our understanding of the underlying factors that control the relationship between climate

403

conditions and COVID-19.

Fig 3. Growth curve of the cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases over A) the Maghreb
countries, B) over the Sahel countries and C) the Gulf of Guinea countries (between March
1 to November 30, 2020). Due to the large difference in the amplitudes between the three different
African bio-climatic zones, the y-axis is capped at 400000 cases for Maghreb, 18000 cases for
Sahel and 70000 cases for Gulf of Guinea.

Fig 4. COVID-19 confirmed cases fitted by a MBLM model [49], extrapolated from the
observed COVID-19 data over the A) Maghreb, B) Sahel, and C) Gulf of Guinea regions. The
residuals (i.e., the differences between the MBLM fitted curve and the observed curve) (Figs. 6A,
6C and 6E) are used to investigate the correlation with the detrended anomaly of the
meteorological variables.

Fig 7. Kendall non-linear rank correlation (τ) test between the detrended anomaly of the
meteorological variables and the residuals of COVID-19 cases over the selected Northern
and Western African countries, as well as area averages over the three bioclimatic regions:
the Maghreb, the Sahel and Gulf of Guinea. Significant correlations with 99% confidence
intervals, that is, correlation that passed the Kendall rank tests at 0.01 level (i.e., p < 0.01; 99%
C.I), are reported in green dots, while correlations that passed the Kendall rank tests at 0.05 level
(i.e., p < 0.05; 95% C.I), are reported in black dots. The correlations are investigated against the
residual of COVID-19 cases with a time-shift of 15 days (i.e., with a time-lag of -14 days) to take
into consideration the incubation period.
