Abstract
The next big step in combating the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic will be gaining
widespread acceptance of a vaccination campaign for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2), but achieving high uptake need proper understandings. Many health professionals,
researchers, statisticians, and programmers to track the viruses spread in different parts of the world
have used various methods. However, the proliferation of vaccines produced by talented scientists
around the world has sparked a strong desire to extract meaningful insights from available data. Until
now, several vaccines against coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have been approved and are being
distributed worldwide in various regions. This study aims to report the detailed data analysis and
result-oriented storytelling of the COVID-19 vaccination program of different countries across the
globe. To analyze the vaccination trend globally this research utilized two different open datasets
provided by ourworldindata.org and worldometers.info. An exploratory data analysis (EDA) with
interactive data visualization using various python libraries was conducted, and the results are
presented in this article to better understand the impact of ongoing vaccination programs around the
world. Apart from the valuable insights gained from the data of various countries, this investigation
also included a comparison of the number of confirmed and death cases before and after vaccination
to determine the efficacy of each vaccine in each country. The results show that a large number of
people are still undecided about whether or not to get a COVID-19 vaccine, despite the virus's
continued devastating effects on communities. Overall, our findings contribute to ongoing research
aimed at informing policy on how to persuade the unvaccinated to be vaccinated.

1. Introduction
Over the history of humankind, vaccine played a crucial role to overcome epidemic situations.
Starting with deliberate variolation back in the 10th century to our modern third-generation (RNA
vaccines and DNA vaccines) [1] [2] vaccination helped us to fight back against deadly viruses and
sustain the human race. Since SARS-CoV-2 is a highly contagious virus that affects populations all
over the world, vaccines are the most important public health measure and the most effective strategy
for protecting the population from COVID-19. Beginning in a fish market in Wuhan, Hubei Province,
China, in December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) spread around the world, causing
COVID-19 disease in millions of people [3]. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared
COVID-19 on March 11, 2020, for the sixth time in history, due to its high human-to-human
transmission rate [4]. According to the statistics of worldometer.info, more than 120 million people
had been infected as of March 15, 2021, with 2.66 million deaths and 20.79 million active cases. The
race to develop COVID19 vaccines to combat the disease's spread and disastrous consequences is still

on, and new, more effective vaccines are likely to emerge as the pandemic progresses [5] [6]. Several
vaccines to prevent COVID-19 infection were approved in December 2020, and more than 50
COVID-19 vaccine candidates were being produced [7] [8]. The WHO has identified 48 vaccine
candidates that are currently being tested in clinical trials [9]. The first step in developing a vaccine
for any virus is to determine its genetic sequence. However, previously, on December 31, 2019, the
World Health Organization issued a warning about a new coronavirus strain that is affecting people in
China [10]. Later, officials from the China confirmed the identification of a new type of coronavirus
infecting human bodies and the first genetic sequence for SARS-CoV-2 was released on January 11,
2020. Non-pharmaceutical interventions are used to minimize transmission and the burden of
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the absence of safe and highly efficient vaccines and
treatment options, but most of these interventions have high economic costs [11]. To reduce the
substantial burden of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, effective COVID-19 vaccines are
desperately needed. Vaccine development is a lengthy process that necessitates numerous testing
phases to ensure adequate safety and immunogenicity in a variety of people (i.e., different ages,
medical conditions, severity of attack, geographic location etc.). According to the National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI), a vaccine must go through four stages of clinical trials before
receiving a license to produce it, which can take up to a decade. However, due to the urgent pandemic
situation around the world, the COVID-19 vaccine development process was shortened to 12-18
months while retaining safety and effectiveness standards. A number of factors, including a
monumental breakthrough in biotechnology and molecular biology, as well as a collaboration between
government and private research institutes, enables the extreme compression of the COVID-19
vaccine development process. The pandemic's humanitarian and economic consequences are guiding
the growth of next-generation vaccine technology platforms around the world. As a result of the
COVID-19 vaccine's production being accelerated, the first candidate entered human clinical trials
with unparalleled speed on March 16, 2020 [12]. As of March 23, 2021, there are 349 COVID-19
treatment (drug medicine) methods in trials, and 267 vaccines are in progress, with 83 in various
stages of clinical testing [9] [13]. Until 25 March 2021 150 countries from a different region of the
world using vaccine from 11 different manufacturers (4 authorized and 7 with emergency use
permission) to vaccinate their citizens. Table 1 summarizes the various stages of vaccine
development process.

To the best of our knowledge, no previously published work has focused on the progress on COVID19 vaccination worldwide with the support of interactive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and
visualizations. The present study aim to evaluate the global participation of citizens by analyzing and
highlighting different characteristics towards successful vaccination. The primary objectives of this
exploration is to answers different query regarding the progress of vaccination to understand the
ongoing safe vaccination program around the globe. People's experience, attitudes, and perceptions
about COVID-19 vaccinations are critical for Government and policymakers to address all obstacles
to vaccine distribution in this scenario. Furthermore, it will inspire and give courage to those people
around the world who oppose taking the vaccine for themselves.

2. Materials and Methods
This section will discuss about the different materials that we employed to build our methods. In this
research, we have used the COVID-19 World Vaccination Progress dataset [15] available at Kaggle
that tracks the Daily and Total Vaccination for COVID-19 in the World. However, COVID-19 World
Vaccination Progress datasets is collected, merged, and updated regularly from Our World in Data
GitHub repository (https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data). Following Table 2 highlights the contents
(data type, column name, and data description) of COVID-19 World Vaccination Progress Dataset.
The dataset contain 15 different column (9 decimal, 3 string, 1 country and 2 other types of data) to
track the progress of global vaccination of COVID-19 around the world. This exploration also utilized
another dataset (Population by Country - 2020), available at Kaggle inherited from the Worldometer
[16]. This dataset contains the information of 235 countries along with their population and there are
11 columns each representing different features of countries.

2.1 Data Preparation and Cleaning
One of the important property of EDA before finding the insight form the data is to clean and prepare
the data according to the requirements. Therefore, data cleaning is the most important step towards an
effective data analysis. In our case, the dataset contains few “NaN” (not a number) values, some
empty rows (having value 0), along with some redundant columns. By using and configuring the

function of df.drop from pandas library, we changed “NaN” values to 0 and removed the entire row as
per our requirements.

2.2 Data Visualization and Analysis
We analyzed our datasets with different Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) [17] methods and visualize
those outcome to provide analysis of different ongoing vaccination programs around the globe. For
data ingestion, visualization and analysis purpose we initialized different python packages including
NumPy (https://numpy.org/), Pandas (https://pandas.pydata.org/), Matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/),
Seaborn (https://seaborn.pydata.org/), and Plotly (https://plotly.com/). Mostly, we have used Seaborn
for data visualization.

3. Results
This study analyzed the COVID-19 World Vaccination Progress dataset to convey the analysis of
different ongoing vaccination programs around the globe. In this section the data analysis results and
visualization will be described to find the answers to different query of this research including a)
Finding out those countries who started vaccinating their citizens fastest, b) Those countries who have
vaccinated the highest people, c) Different categories of offered vaccines, d) Name of the vaccines
used by various countries, e) Finding daily vaccination trend of most vaccine used countries, and f)
Vaccine impact analysis on new confirmed and death cases. To achieve the objectives of this research
we have followed variety of data analysis and visualizations approach to highlight the results.
Following Figure 1, represent the top 25 countries in the world who have started fastest vaccination
in their country. Based on the bar chart, Israel leading the trend with more than 85 vaccine per
hundred peoples and after that UAE ensured almost 70 vaccine for their peoples in per hundred. On
other hand, England and UK almost ensure the same number of vaccine for their peoples.

Figure 1: With more than 85 doses given for every 100 people, Israel clearly leads the world in terms of number
of doses per head of population, as seen in the graph as of 17 March 2021.

Until 17 march, 2021 different scenario of worldwide vaccination progress worldwide has visualized
in the Figure 2. Individual countrywide total vaccination, number of people who took vaccination for
at least once, people who completed their double dose of vaccination and based on the population
percentage of countrywide vaccination highlighted here. However, we have highlighted only top 25
countries for the better understandings of the entire scenario for each case.

Figure 2: The bar plot visualization depicts different scenario of vaccination progress. 2(A) indicates that USA
ensured110M vaccinations for their peoples and China after that with 65M until 17 March 2021. Those
countries were individuals who have taken the vaccine for at least once is clearly depicted in 2(B). Surprisingly
peoples of south Asian country like India already taken 31M vaccine and placing them in the second position
after the USA. Successful countries those have managed to provide a complete dose (2 dose for each) for their
people illustrates in 2(C). With 40M complete doses of vaccine, USA covers almost 12% of its total populations
under fully vaccinated countries. Again, based on total population, 2(D) confirms that Gibraltar, Israel, and
Seychelles vaccinated 58.11%, 50.78% and 27.87% of their peoples until 17 March 2021.

One hundred and thirty seven (137) countries utilizing 25 different vaccine based on various region all
over the globe. A Seaborn bar plot representation highlights all the available vaccine used in per 10
million until 17 March 2021 worldwide. Pfizer tops the list of most-used COVID-19 vaccines in the
world, followed by Mordema, and Oxford–AstraZeneca. China mostly uses Sinovac vaccine and India
uses Covaxin, Covishield for vaccinating its citizens.

To highlight the most and least vaccinated countries and vaccine used we further visualize that data in
Figure 5. Graphics library of Plotly offers Sunburst plots (px.sunburst) that visualize the hierarchical
data spanning outwards radially from root to leaves. Based on the ED analysis and visualization it
confirms that United States mostly uses Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine
with a rate of 32.62% (total vaccination= 109081860.0) in terms of total vaccinations until 17 March
2021. However, China and India are in next position respectively in the category of most vaccinated
countries with a total vaccination of 64980000 (4.51%) and 32947432 (2.39%).

Figure 5: Sunburst plot representation of most and least vaccine used countries and their used vaccine. 5(A)
shows the highest number of vaccine utilized countries along with the group of vaccine and 5(B) visualize the
least vaccine used countries with their vaccine group utilizations.

However, for the countries that less vaccinated so far, Saint Helena only use the 107.0 vaccine of
Oxford/AstraZeneca with total vaccination rate of 1.76%. Trinidad and Tobago and Montserrat
remain in next position with a total vaccination of 440.0 (0.03%) and 652.0 (13.04%).

Daily

vaccinations is another important factor to assess the perception of people’s attitude towards
successful vaccination. As a result, using data from the most vaccinated countries, we compiled a list
of five (5) of the most vaccinated countries' regular patterns from the start of vaccinations to the
present (Figure 6). United States, United Kingdom, China, India and England ensured highest number
of vaccination in their country.

Figure 6: US, UK, China, India and England have vaccinated most people until now. Here, we have highlighted
the daily vaccination trend for those countries. United States (US) leading the trend by vaccinating with almost
2.44 million peoples whereas England shows a downward curve by vaccinating 323.44K peoples exactly.

4. Discussion
This section will discuss on the findings of this exploration in more border way. Table 4 contains
details about vaccine categories and their current development stage. As of March 14, 2021, there are
251 vaccine in 10 different categories are in the process of development around the world whereas 11
vaccines including four (4) authorized and seven (7) from clinical phase-III are being used around the
world (Table 5).

Based on the results analysis and visualization many countries around the globe started applying
vaccine to their citizens by the end of 2020. The rate of applying vaccines to the patients is highest in
Isreal. It is because of its small size (in terms of both area and population), a relatively young
population, relatively warm weather in December 2020, a centralized national system of government,
and well-developed infrastructure for implementing prompt responses to large-scale national
emergencies. Until 17 March 2021, The United States has the most vaccinated people of around 110M
of its total population followed by China and India. As these are developed countries and they
produce vaccine in their own lab; therefore, the accessibility of the vaccine is easier to its public. The
impact of using vaccine on specific countries to reduce the spread of COVID-19, we further
investigate the confirmed and death cases for the USA, China, UK, India and Brazil after their
vaccination campaign starts. Figure 7 presents the status of confirmed and death cases of five (5)
most populated countries around the globe. Based on the findings, it is evident that the confirmed
trend of USA was rising until January 20, 2021 and then gradually it decrease in passage of time.
However, other countries have maintained a linear status in their confirmed cases but Brazil and India
suddenly finds increasing number of COVID-19 cases after March 15, 2021. On the other hand,
except Brazil all other countries maintained a descending trend in their death cases. Brazil started its
vaccination on January 17, 2021 and still the country is fighting to minimize the death cases; on 18
march, 2021 it experienced a total death of almost 2,800 peoples. Overall, different vaccines have
been proved effective against COVID-19 around the world and with the maintain of proper health
regulation it may possible to reduce both the confirmed and death cases.

the confirmed cases of each countries until 18 March whereas 5(B) highlighting the death cases to analyze the
impact of vaccination program.

Based on the vaccination data available along with the support of Open Street Map and Map box
countrywide map visualization is shown in Figure 8. The map is designed to provide insights of how
different region and countries are ensuring vaccine for their populations. However, this map only
highlights those regions that are currently offering vaccine. Surprisingly, few countries from the
region of central Africa are still unable to ensure safe vaccine for their citizens. Until March 20, 2021,
the United States and China accounted for about half of all vaccines used worldwide.

Figure 8: Worldwide vaccination map visualization based on highest number of doses offered by the country.

Until 21 March 2021, globally 150 countries are adopted 25 different vaccines for its population.
Among them, some of the countries are using multiple vaccine for different categories of population
according to their requirements. This research have unfolded the insights of vaccination program all
over the world with data analysis and visualization. In addition, it tries to answers few questions
regarding current status of different vaccine used in different region of the world. According to data
analysis, Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca, Sinovac, Covaxin, and Covishield are the
most popular vaccine used worldwide for mass vaccination, since all the vaccine has almost negligible
side effects (known until 21 March 2021). This is quite pleasing that people from all the parts of the
world are educating themselves and willingly taking the vaccines. In addition, scientist, public health
experts, WHO, medical experts have claimed that these vaccines are effective against COVID-19 and
that have already proven (21 March 2021). Apart from analyzing the findings, this study motivates a
large number of people all over the world to take the vaccine and unite under one umbrella. If the
vaccination rate continues to rise, all countries will be able to vaccinate their citizens by the end of the
year.

5. Conclusion
The COVID-19 pandemic is still wreaking havoc on human lives around the world, but the COVID19 vaccine offers a ray of hope for the future. The global response to the COVID-19 pandemic is
likely to rely heavily on vaccine deployment. The present study revealed that globally there is a
significant turnaround in people’s perception towards vaccination and thus different countries are
ensuring mass vaccination for their citizens. The findings also suggests that, rate of vaccination
among global population is increasing day by day and as such, unvaccinated peoples around the globe
gets more motivated and encouraged to take vaccine in upcoming days. Although vaccines are still
unavailable in some parts of the world for various reasons, we believe policymakers should take steps
to ensure sufficient knowledge, positive attitudes, and perceptions of COVID-19 vaccinations in order
to decrease vaccine hesitancy.
