Abstract
Understanding the relationships between pre-existing conditions and complications of
COVID-19 infection is critical to identifying which patients will develop severe disease.
Here, we leverage 1.1 million clinical notes from 1,903 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and
deep neural network models to characterize associations between 21 pre-existing
conditions and the development of 20 complications (e.g. respiratory, cardiovascular,
renal, and hematologic) of COVID-19 infection throughout the course of infection (i.e. 0-30
days, 31-60 days, and 61-90 days). Pleural effusion was the most frequent complication of
early COVID-19 infection (23% of 383 complications) followed by cardiac arrhythmia (12%
of 383 complications). Notably, hypertension was the most significant risk factor
associated with 10 different complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome,
cardiac arrhythmia and anemia. Furthermore, novel associations between cancer (risk
ratio: 3, p=0.02) or immunosuppression (risk ratio: 4.3, p=0.04) with early-onset heart
failure have also been identified. Onset of new complications after 30 days is rare and most
commonly involves pleural effusion (31-60 days: 24% of 45 patients, 61-90 days: 25% of 36
patients). Overall, the associations between pre-COVID conditions and COVID-associated
complications presented here may form the basis for the development of risk assessment
scores to guide clinical care pathways.

Introduction
The COVID pandemic remains an ongoing public health crisis1, and it is critically important to
understand the full spectrum of complications that arise throughout the course of COVID infection.
There are already several emerging reports of risk factors of severe disease as well as lingering
long-term effects such as fatigue, myalgia and kidney related complications2. However, there is
an incomplete understanding of the relationship between pre-existing comorbidities and postCOVID complications.
Longitudinal multi-center patient data in EHRs of over 20,000 COVID-19 patients (1,903
hospitalized) from the Mayo Clinic (Rochester, Arizona, Florida) and associated health systems,

provides a unique opportunity to understand the relationship between comorbidities and COVID
complications3. While the structured EHR fields such as ICD codes are modestly informative, the
true context of comorbidities and complications are buried in the 1.1 million+ unstructured patient
notes of the 1,903 COVID-19 patients. In this study, we have leveraged ‘augmented curation’ of
EHR notes in COVID patients3 to map the relationships between complications, comorbidities,
and outcomes in the hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

Study design
In this study, we consider all hospitalized COVID-19 positive patients (positive PCR for SARSCoV2) in the Mayo Clinic electronic health record (EHR) database from March 12, 2020 to
September 15, 2020 (1,903 patients total). An overview of the clinical characteristics of this study
population is provided in Table 1.
In order to capture the complications and comorbidities recorded in the clinical notes with positive
sentiment, we ran the 1.1 million patient notes through a neural network based software that
captures the sentiments of phenotypes from clinical notes.
For comorbidities, we considered 21 risk factors for COVID-19 severe illness reported by the
CDC4, including: (1) anemia, (2) asthma, (3) BMI between 25-30 (overweight), (4) BMI between
30-40 (obese), (5) BMI >= 40 (severe obesity), (6) cancer, (7) cardiomyopathy, (8) chronic kidney
disease (CKD), (9) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), (10) coronary artery disease
(CAD), (11) heart failure (HF), (12) hyperglycemia, (13) hypertension, (14) immunosuppressant
medication usage, (15) liver disease, (16) neurologic conditions, (17) obstructive sleep apnea
(OSA), (18) smoker (former or current), (19) steroid medication usage, (20) type 1 diabetes
mellitus (T1D), (21) type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). We also note that bone marrow transplant,
HIV/AIDS, pediatric conditions, pregnancy, sickle cell disease, solid organ transplant, and
thalassemia were also considered, but were not included in the analysis because fewer than 20
patients had each of these comorbidities.
For complications, we considered 20 COVID-associated complications: (1) acute respiratory
distress syndrome / acute lung injury (ARDS / ALI), (2) acute kidney injury (AKI), (3) anemia, (4)
cardiac arrest, (5) cardiac arrhythmias, (6) chronic fatigue syndrome, (7) disseminated

intravascular coagulation (DIC), (8) heart failure, (9) hyperglycemia, (10) hypertension, (11)
myocardial infarction (MI), (12) pleural effusion, (13) pulmonary embolism (PE), (14) respiratory
failure, (15) sepsis, (16) septic shock, (17) stroke / cerebrovascular incident, (18) venous
thromboembolism / deep vein thrombosis (VTE / DVT), (19) delirium/encephelopathy, and (20)
numbness.
A patient was determined to have a clinical phenotype (the comorbidity or complication, in
question) if the clinical phenotype or synonyms were mentioned (with positive sentiment) within
that patients’ electronic health records. For comorbidities, the mention must have occurred within
a note at any point in the patient history prior to the patient’s first positive COVID-19 PCR test.
Patients were only considered if they had at least one note within Mayo Clinic EHR system dated
before days -31 relative to their first positive PCR test.
For the patients included in this study, we stratified the rates of new onset complications by
comorbidities (Table 2). For each comorbidity, e.g. chronic kidney disease, we compare the rates
of “new onset” complications in cohorts of COVID-19 patients with and without chronic kidney
disease. To calculate the rate of a new-onset complication, e.g. acute kidney injury (AKI), the
numerator is the number of patients with AKI recorded in the clinical notes (with positive
sentiment) during but not prior to the time period. The denominator is the number of patients
without AKI recorded in the clinical notes with positive sentiment prior to the time period.
Augmented curation to identify comorbidities and complications in clinical notes
An augmented curation approach was used to classify the sentiment of phenotypes mentioned in
the clinical notes. In order to determine if a patient is indicative of a comorbidity or complication,
we used a system consisting of:
● A high performance text retrieval and search engine that given a patient cohort consisting
of one or more patients, pipes all the sentences, paragraphs and documents pertaining to
those patients to a Named Entity Recognition (NER) system
● An NER system consisting of both a knowledge graph based entity recognition subsystem
as well as a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) based5
entity recognition system that, given any sentence or paragraph is able to identity whether
it contains one or more phenotypes (comorbidities or complications etc.) so that all such
sentences and paragraphs then are piped to a further downstream phenotype sentiment
classification system.
● A BERT-based phenotype sentiment model3 that given a sentence or paragraph
containing a phenotype/disease token provides accurately the sentiment as to whether or
not the sentence indicates if the patient has the disease or not.
● A system that aggregates, patient-wise, all the sentence/paragraph sentiments, grouped
by disease, and uses practical heuristics to determine if the patient may be confidently
deemed to have the disease, based on the sentence level sentiments. As part of
immediate future work, we are developing formal Bayesian models to aggregate the
sentence level BERT sentiment information into a sound patient level sentiment inference.

Presently we use heuristics based on the number of positive sentiment sentences found
in a patient’s notes to deem whether or not the patient has a disease.
Validation of the augmented curation model
In order to validate the augmented curation model for a set of phenotypes of
complications/comorbidities, we manually labelled a set of 2,404 randomly selected sentences
from the clinical notes containing the phenotypes. The true positive, true negative, false positive,
and false negative rates are reported in Supplementary Table S1. Overall, the out-of-sample
precision, recall, and accuracy values were 0.980, 0.982, and 0.966, respectively.

Results
Patient characteristics
1,903 patients were hospitalized with a diagnosis of COVID-19 between March 12, 2020 and
October 15, 2020. Using the date of the first positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test, we analyzed the
clinical notes of each patient in their pre-COVID vs the post-COVID19 phase (Figure 1A). Using
deep language models (Figure 1B) we extracted the 20 risk factors for COVID-19 severe illness
reported by the CDC (Figure 1C) and the 18 COVID-associated complications (Figure 1D) in
order to analyze their association in our cohort (Figure 2-4).
In Table 1, we present the general characteristics of the study population. All age groups are
included, and, as expected from the severity of the disease in different age groups, more than
50% of the patients were over 50 year-old with only 2.6% of pediatric patients. Female, male and
different ethnic origins of the US population are adequately represented. The most frequent
comorbidities were hypertension (42.8%), diabetes/hyperglycemia (38%), obesity (25.2%) and
cancer (21.1%), reflecting the most common causes of chronic diseases in the US.
The most common COVID complications recorded were respiratory (ARDS, respiratory failure,
pulmonary embolism), followed by cardiovascular (hypertension, myocardial infarction,
arrhythmia,
stroke),
acute
kidney
injury,
anemia,
sepsis
and
diabetic
decompensation/hyperglycemia (Figure 1D).
Frequency of COVID-19 complications and association with underlying comorbidities
The main objective of our analysis was to identify the association between comorbidities and
short-term (up to 30 days post-infection) and long-term (31-90 days post-infection) complications
of COVID-19 infection. Here, we observe the majority of complications occur within the first month
post-infection (Figure 1D).
We identify multiple comorbidities that are associated with significantly higher rates of any
complications in the early onset time period (Days 0-30 post-PCR diagnosis). From this analysis,
we validate that many of the CDC-reported risk factors for COVID-19 severe illness are
associated with increased rates of early onset COVID complications across multiple organ

systems (Table 2). Among these we identify hypertension (RR: 9.4, p-value: 2.9e-64) as the most
significant risk factor followed by other cardiovascular chronic disease (heart failure, coronary
artery disease, cardiomyopathy), anemia (RR: 3.2, p-value: 9.8e-14) and chronic kidney disease
(RR: 4.4, p-value: 1.5e-22), as the most significant predictors of clinical complication in early
COVID-19 infection.
Respiratory complications
Pleural effusions are the most common early onset complications: 23% within the first months
and 7% for ARDS/ALI, the second most frequent complication (Figure 1D). The primary risk factor
for pleural effusion was hypertension (RR 9.2, p = 2.4e-22) (Figure 2, Table 3). While the risk of
new onset of pleural effusion is reduced after a month, our data reveal persistent risk of pleural
effusion beyond 30 days post-infection, particularly among patients with type 1 diabetes (~5%)
(Figures 3,4).
Acute respiratory distress syndrome / acute lung injury is the second most frequent and is
the most dreaded complication of severe COVID-19 infection (7%) (Figure 1D). In the early
stages of COVID infection (i.e. 0-30 days post-infection), ARDS/ALI was most significantly
associated with hypertension (p-value: 4.2e-8). The other most significantly associated baseline
comorbidities include anemia (p-value: 2.9e-4) and chronic kidney disease (2.7e-3) (Figure 2).
In later stages of infection, we observe additional instances of ARDS/ALI, but at lower rates.
Further, in later stages of infection, we fail to observe significant associations between baseline
comorbidities and increased risk of new onset of ARDS/ALI (Figures 3,4, Table 3).
Cardiovascular complications
Cardiac arrhythmia was the most common cardiovascular complication following COVID
infection (12%) (Figure 1D). Hypertension is by far the most important risk factor (RR= 21, p =
2.7e-19) (Table 3). Up to 7% of hypertensive patients present with this complication within the
first 30 days (Figure 2). But the risk declines to less than 1% for new onset after one month postinfection (Figures 3,4).
Early onset COVID heart failure is the second most common cardiovascular complication (9%)
(Figure 1D). It is primarily associated with coronary heart disease (RR=7.3, p=2.9e-3) and other
cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, anemia, type 2 diabetes, smoking) (Table 3). But
interestingly, cancer and immunosuppression are also uncovered as significant risk factors
(RR=5.1 and 4.5, P = 4.0e-4 and 0.04, respectively). The cardiovascular complications examined
in this study occur most frequently in days 0-30 post-infection (Figure 2). Beyond 30 days, the
risk of new-onset arrhythmia, hypertension, MI, PE/DVT dropped to less than 1% for all
comorbidities (Figures 3,4).
Renal complications.
Acute kidney injury is among the most common early-onset post-COVID complications (7%),
(Figure 1D) and is associated in our cohort mostly with hypertension (RR=11, p=1.2e-7), and
chronic kidney disease (RR 8.9, p=4.1e-6) (Table 3) (Figure 2). Specifically, we observe acute
kidney injury in 7% of hospitalized COVID patients in aggregate in early infection. The risk of

acute kidney injury is highest in the early stages of infection (i.e. 0-30 days post-infection), while
there is a reduction in the new onset of acute kidney injury beyond 30 days (either 31-60 days or
61-90 days) (Figures 3,4).
Neurologic Complications
Encephalopathy and delirium are a commonly observed complication of COVID (c), which is
most associated in our cohort with heart failure (RR = 11, p = 3.9e-5), hypertension (RR = 7.2, p
= 3.3e-4), and coronary artery disease (RR = 9.2, p = 7.5e-4) (Table 3). Further, the risk of
encephalopathy and delirium was observed to be highest in early COVID infection (Figures 3,4).
Predictors of long-term complications of COVID-19 infection
While we observe a substantial reduction in the frequency of new onset of complications beyond
30 days post-infection, the risk of some complications is non-zero. In the case of pleural effusion,
the risk decreases from 10-15% for all patients to less than 1% (Figures 2,3,4) with increased
risk in patients with cardiomyopathy, chronic kidney disease, coronary artery disease, heart failure
and hypertension. Patients with liver disease, stroke and type 1 diabetes also appear more
susceptible to late-onset complications (days 31-90) (Figure 3,4).

Discussion
In the present study we have set out to understand the relationship between baseline
comorbidities and clinical complications over the course of COVID-19 infection. Here, we leverage
natural language processing of unstructured patient notes from 1,903 patients hospitalized with
COVID-19 in the Mayo Clinic health system. While it stands to reason that individuals with poorer
health status and multiple underlying comorbidities will experience worse outcomes during
COVID-19 infection, our study reveals that not all risk factors are created equal and are associated
with different complications. Previous studies have begun to uncover numerous factors
associated with increased risk of more severe COVID-19 infection6–10 including hypertension,
chronic kidney disease, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and malignancy. In general,
these studies have examined risk of severe COVID-19 infection, but have not examined the
relationship between baseline comorbidities and risk of specific complications.
In our analysis, we observe that hypertension is the single most significant risk factor for all
examined complications with exception of deep vein thrombosis. Notably, this is consistent with
previous studies,, where patients with baseline hypertension have been reported to have higher
risk of more severe COVID-19 disease7,8. Specifically, our data suggest that a recent history of
hypertension is the strongest predictor of ARDS, the most significant and life-threatening
complication of COVID-19, among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, similar to previous
observations10. We further observed anemia, chronic kidney disease, immunosuppression,
coronary artery disease and hyperglycemia to be associated with increased rates of ARDS. Our
analysis further uncovered unexpected associations like between a history of cancer and
immunosuppression with heart failure following COVID-19 infection.
Our data also highlight the temporal relationship between baseline health status and
complications throughout COVID-19 infection. For example, cancer, obesity, and obstructive

sleep apnea are associated with higher rates of short-term complications (days 0-30 post-PCR
test), but not with late-onset complications. While many comorbidities are chronic (e.g. cancer,
obesity, coronary artery disease and chronic kidney disease), others are amenable to short-term
intervention, suggesting that tight control of modifiable risk factors might limit the risk of
complication due to COVID-19 infection. For example, controlling hypertension, smoking
cessation, treating anemia, and having tight glycemic control might reduce the rate of
cardiovascular complications in the early stages of COVID-19.
Many of the comorbidities examined likely influence the development of complications, even in
the absence of COVID-19 infection. For example, we do not observe new-onset pleural effusion
among patients with pre-existing liver disease. It is possible that this is related to previous
incidence of pleural effusion among patients with liver disease11. In the present analysis of the
relationship between baseline co-morbidities and the likelihood of developing severe
complications, we are not using a reference population of COVID-19 negative individuals. Instead,
to understand these relationships, we have limited our inquiry to hospitalized COVID-19 patients
and examined differences in the rates of clinical complications and various comorbidities. In future
analyses, we will explore the rate of clinical complications in a control population of hospitalized
COVID-negative patients to establish baseline complication rates within a hospitalized population.
At present, our analysis does not account for the co-dependent relationships between
comorbidities or between complications. In many cases, individual patients likely have multiple
complications, which can obscure the interpretation of data, particularly at later time points where
we observe fewer events. Additionally, it is possible that many of the late-stage complications
arise directly from baseline comorbidities rather than a direct result of COVID19 infection. This
study can be leveraged for the development of controlled trials to identify appropriate prophylactic
or therapeutic interventions for high-risk COVID-19 patients. Future analyses will focus on
creation of a multivariate model to enable risk prediction of post-COVID complications12.

we compare the rates of “early onset” complications in cohorts of COVID-19 patients with and
without comorbidities, during the time period (Days 0-30) relative to the PCR diagnosis date. To
calculate the rates of new onset complications, the numerator is the number of patients with any
complication recorded in the clinical notes with positive sentiment during but not prior to the time
period (see Methods for full list of complications). The denominator is the number of patients
without the complication recorded in the clinical notes with positive sentiment prior to Day 0. The
rows with statistically significant differences are highlighted in green. The columns are: (1)
Comorbidity: Comorbidity that defines the cohorts, including chronic conditions which are risk
factors for severe COVID-19 disease, (2) Overall rate of new onset complications in cohort
with the comorbidity: Overall rate of new onset complications from Days 0-30 in the cohort of
patients with the comorbidity. (3) Overall rate of new onset complications in cohort without
the comorbidity: Overall rate of new onset complications from Days 0-30 in the cohort of patients
without the comorbidity, (4) Relative risk [95% C.I.]: (Rate of complication in cohort with
comorbidity) / (Rate of complication in cohort without comorbidity), along with the associated 95%
confidence interval, (5) BH-adjusted p-value: Benjamin-Hochberg corrected p-value for the
Fisher exact statistical significance test comparing the rates of overall complications in the cohorts
of patients with and without the specified comorbidity.

Table 3: Rates of early onset complications stratified by comorbidity. In each row, we
compare the rates of “early onset” complications in cohorts of COVID-19 patients with and without
comorbidities, during the time period (Days 0-30) relative to the PCR diagnosis date`. To calculate
the rates of new onset complications, the numerator is the number of patients with the
complication recorded in the clinical notes with positive sentiment during but not prior to the time
period. The denominator is the number of patients without the complication recorded in the clinical
notes with positive sentiment prior to the time period. Rows with cardiovascular complications
are highlighted in light red, and rows with respiratory complications are highlighted in light blue.
Rows are sorted first by complication, and second by statistical significance. The columns are:
(1) Complication: Complication phenotype that is used to define the rates, including phenotypes
associated with severe COVID-19 disease, (2) Comorbidity: Comorbidity that defines the
cohorts, including chronic conditions which are risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease, (3)
Rate of new onset complication in cohort with the comorbidity: Rate of complication from
Days 0-30 in the cohort of patients with the comorbidity. (4) Rate of new onset complication in
cohort without the comorbidity: Rate of complication from Days 0-30 in the cohort of patients
without the comorbidity, (5) Relative risk [95% C.I.]: (Rate of complication in cohort with
comorbidity) / (Rate of complication in cohort without comorbidity), along with the associated 95%
confidence interval, (6) BH-adjusted p-value: Benjamin-Hochberg corrected p-value for the
Fisher exact statistical significance test comparing the rates of the specified complications in the
cohorts of patients with and without the specified comorbidity.

Supplementary Material
Supplementary Table S1: Sentence-level validation of BERT model to classify phenotype
sentiment. The columns are (1) Phenotype: disease token identified in the sentence, (2) TP
(true positives): count of sentences in which the BERT model correctly identified the sentiment
as ‘Yes’, (3) TN (true negatives): count of sentences in which the BERT model correctly identified
the sentiment as not ‘Yes’, (4) FP (false positives): count of sentences in which the BERT model
incorrectly identified the sentiment as ‘Yes’, (5) FN: (false negatives): count of sentences in
which the BERT model incorrectly identified the sentiment as not ‘Yes’, (6) Precision: precision
of the BERT model, equal to TP/(TP+FP), (7) Recall: recall of the BERT model, equal to
TP/(TP+FN), (8) Accuracy: accuracy of the BERT model, equal to (TP+TN)/(TP+TN+FP+FN).
