Abstract
How COVID-19 vaccine is distributed within low- and middle-income countries has received little attention outside of equity or logistical concerns but
may ultimately affect campaign impact in terms of infections, severe cases,
or deaths averted. In this study we examined whether subnational (urbanrural) prioritization may affect the cumulative two-year impact on disease
transmission and burden of a vaccination campaign using an agent-based
model of COVID-19 in a representative Sub-Saharan Africa country setting.
We simulated a range of vaccination strategies that differed by urban-rural
prioritization, age group prioritization, timing of introduction, and final coverage level. Urban prioritization averted more infections in only a narrow
set of scenarios, when internal migration rates were low and vaccination was
started by day 30 of an outbreak. Rural prioritization was the optimal strategy for all other scenarios, e.g., with higher internal migration rates or later
start dates, due to the presence of a large immunological naive rural popula-

tion. Among other factors, timing of the vaccination campaign was important
to determining maximum impact, and delays as short as 30 days prevented
larger campaigns from having the same impact as smaller campaigns that
began earlier. The optimal age group for prioritization depended on choice
of metric, as prioritizing older adults consistently averted more deaths across
all of the scenarios. While guidelines exist for these latter factors, urbanrural allocation is an orthogonal factor that we predict to affect impact and
warrants consideration as countries plan the scale-up of their vaccination
campaigns.

Introduction

2

COVID-19 has presented every country with a challenge to formulate

3

a strategy to protect its population, initially with non-pharmaceutical in-

4

terventions (NPI)/public health and safety measures (PHSM) and more re-

5

cently vaccination. As of June 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO)

6

has granted Emergency Use Listing to five vaccines [1], though supplies are

7

expected to be limited, particularly in low- and middle-income countries

8

(LMIC). The COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) Advance Market

9

Commitment (AMC) is expected to be the primary mechanism by which

10

most of 92 eligible LMICs procure COVID-19 vaccines, beginning with 3%

11

population coverage for health care workers (HCW) and increasing to 20%

12

population coverage for the elderly and adults with comorbidities [2]. Previ-

13

ous modeling studies have indicated that prioritizing elderly adults for vac2

cination would yield the largest reductions in mortality [3, 4] given the steep

15

gradient of mortality observed with age in China, Europe, and other coun-

16

tries [5, 6]. Meanwhile, HCW have been prioritized to preserve health system

17

capacity [2].

18

How countries should allocate vaccines subnationally has received little

19

attention outside of equity or logistical considerations. While the WHO re-

20

quires countries to submit national deployment and vaccination plans (ND-

21

VPs) [7] prior to receiving vaccines from COVAX [8], WHO guidance on

22

developing NDVPs mentions geography only in the context of ensuring equi-

23

table access. In particular the guidance encourages countries to give special

24

consideration to “those living in informal settlements or urban slums... pop-

25

ulations in conflict settings or those affected by humanitarian emergencies,

26

and other hard-to-reach population groups” but does not explore the epi-

27

demiological impact of such policy decisions [7]. Likewise, WHO guidance

28

on logistics mentions “remote areas” but only with respect to the ultra-low

29

temperatures required to store certain vaccines and the need for special de-

30

vices such as thermal shippers with dry ice [9]. These documents highlight

31

the challenges that rural areas (and some urban areas) are expected to face

32

during COVID-19 vaccination campaigns and suggest that the default may

33

be to overlook these areas or distribute vaccine to these areas at a slower

34

pace.

35

In this study we ask whether urban or rural prioritization of COVID-19

36

vaccines may also affect the impact of the vaccination campaign on disease

37

burden. Using an agent-based model set in a representative Sub-Saharan

38

African (SSA) setting, we examine the possible impact on transmission and

Results

44

Ongoing migration generates multiple peaks in COVID-19 incidence at the

45

country level

46

To explore possible COVID-19 trajectories in SSA, we created an agent-

47

based model of the spread of COVID-19 in a SSA-like country setting where

48

the population was split between urban and rural areas. The population

49

was assumed to be immunologically naive, and NPI/PHSM policies were

50

simulated as dynamic changes in transmission. Infections were seeded in the

51

urban node and allowed to spread to rural nodes through internal urban-rural

52

migration (Figure 1).

53

In the baseline scenario, moderate transmission and ongoing migration

54

(R0 = 2.4, migration = 20 000 daily trips per million individuals, dtpmi)

55

resulted in separate incidence peaks in urban and rural areas which aggre-

56

gated to give two peaks at the country level (Figure 1, middle column, middle

57

row). Cases rose quickly in urban areas and more gradually in rural areas

58

with urban and rural peaks separated by approximately four months. After

59

two years, a majority of the overall population (58% ± 2%) had been infected

60

at some point (Figure 2). A larger fraction of the urban population was ever

61

infected (81% cumulative urban infections vs. 48% cumulative rural infec-

62

tions), but rural infections outnumbered urban infections due to the larger

68

from 287 to 92 days when migration = 20 000 dtpmi, Figure 1). This also

69

resulted in a proportional increase in cumulative incidence as expected (Fig-

70

ure 2; however, other qualitative features such as the number of peaks at the

71

country level remained unchanged (Figure 1).

72

By comparison, increasing the internal migration rate while holding trans-

73

mission constant resulted in qualitative changes to the incidence curve includ-

74

ing the number of peaks at the country level (Figure 1). At medium rates of

75

migration (migration = 20 000 dtpmi), separate urban and rural peaks were

76

apparent at the country level with any level of transmission (Figure 1). In

77

this scenario, approximately equal numbers of cases came from urban and

78

rural areas (Figure 2). At low rates of migration (migration = 2000 dtpmi),

79

the outbreak was predominantly urban, with urban areas contributing the

80

majority of cases (Figure 2). Rural incidence failed to increase appreciably

81

but instead contributed to a long tail of declining incidence at the country

82

level (Figure 1). Conversely, at high rates of migration (migration = 200 000

83

dtpmi), a predominantly rural outbreak was observed, with rural areas con-

84

tributing the majority of cases (Figure 2). Incidence increased in both urban

85

and rural areas but continued increasing in rural areas even after starting to

86

decline in urban areas (Figure 1). Therefore, both low and high migration

87

rates tended to produce single-peak outbreaks, while intermediate migration

88

rates resulted in multiple peaks, marking the transition between between

89

predominantly urban and rural outbreaks.

90

At extreme values of transmission and migration, the model demonstrated

91

two contrasting outbreak scenarios. A more contained, primarily urban out-

92

break was generated when transmission and migration rates were low (R0 =

93

2.0 and migration = 2000 dtpmi); cumulative incidence was 62% and 5% in

94

urban and rural areas, respectively, and 22% ± 2% at the country level (Fig-

95

ure 2). A less contained, widespread outbreak was generated when transmis-

96

sion and migration rates were high (R0 = 2.8 and migration = 200 000 dtpmi);

97

cumulative incidence was 78% and 63% in urban and rural areas, respectively,

98

and 68% ± 2% at the country level (Figure 2). This range of cumulative in-

99

cidence was consistent with seroprevalence rates in SSA [10, 11, 12, 13, 14].

100

Increasing coverage has a limited capacity to compensate for delays in COVID-

101

19 vaccine introduction

102

To examine the effect of COVID-19 vaccination policies on population-

103

level impact, we simulated roll-out strategies that differed in several respects:

104

age prioritization (i.e., older or younger adults first), timing (start day) of vac-

105

cine introduction, final vaccine coverage level, and spatial prioritization (i.e.,

106

urban or rural areas first). Vaccines were assumed to be either acquisition-

107

blocking (preventing most infection after exposure) or disease-blocking (al-

108

lowing infection and limited transmission but preventing most disease). Im-

109

pact was evaluated on the basis of cumulative infections, severe cases, and

110

deaths averted after two years compared to a counterfactual baseline scenario

111

of moderate transmission and ongoing migration (R0 = 2.4, migration = 20

112

000 dtpmi).

113

We first asked what effect age prioritization and timing of introduction

114

might have on vaccination impact (Figure 3). To simplify the analysis, we

115

fixed vaccine coverage at 50% and distributed vaccine to both urban and

116

rural areas with equal priority. We found that the optimal age prioritiza-

117

tion strategy depended on the choice of impact metric. Prioritizing younger

118

adults to receive an acquisition-blocking vaccine averted more infections than

119

prioritizing older adults or random distribution by age (e.g., 15%±3% versus

120

13%±2% and 7%±2%, respectively, when introduced at day 60, Figure 3,

121

left column, top row), consistent with the large proportion of younger adults

122

in SSA populations ([15]) and degree of contact that occurs within this age

123

group ([16]). With a disease-blocking vaccine, prioritizing younger adults

124

continued to be more effective in averting infections than prioritizing older

125

adults, but the relative differences were reduced (Figure 3, left column, bot-

126

tom row).

Figure 3: Vaccination impact by age prioritization and timing of vaccine introduction.
Age groups for prioritization were as follows: “old first” = beginning with adults age 70
years or older; “young first” = beginning with adults age 15–49 years; “random” = without
prioritization (i.e., all ages have equal priority).

By comparison, prioritizing older adults was consistently more effective

128

at averting severe cases or deaths than prioritizing younger adults or random

130

adults averted approximately twice as many deaths as prioritizing younger

131

adults, regardless of date of introduction (Figure 3, right column, top row).

132

These differences were greater in magnitude for a disease-blocking vaccine

133

(Figure 3, right column, bottom row). Regardless of impact metrics, delays

134

in vaccine introduction reduced but did not negate the absolute differences

135

in impact between age prioritization strategies (Figure 3).

136

We then asked whether higher coverage levels could compensate for a

137

later date of introduction. In this case, we assumed priority would go to

138

older adults based on the deaths averted as a metric (Figure 4) and WHO

139

fair allocation guidelines [2]. Final coverage levels were varied between 20%

140

and 80% representing COVAX targets [2] and an optimistic scenario with ad-

141

ditional vaccine procurement, respectively. Regardless of metric (infections,

142

severe cases, or deaths averted) or start day of vaccination (30-180 days after

143

first case), increasing vaccination coverage also increased the impact (Fig-

144

ure 4).

145

The maximum possible impact for any given coverage level diminished

146

rapidly with delays in the start of vaccination (Figure 4). An optimistic

147

campaign with 80% coverage of an acquisition-blocking vaccine averted 16%

148

of infections when introduced on day 30 but only 2% of infections when

149

introduced on day 180. The impact of vaccination at other coverage levels was

150

similarly diminished by delays in introduction (Figure 4). As a result, higher

151

coverage levels were necessary for a campaign started later to have the same

152

impact as a campaign started earlier with lower coverage levels. In certain

153

cases, the gain from starting vaccination earlier could not be matched by

154

delayed vaccination, even with very high final coverage levels. For example,

155

to avert the same number of deaths (32% of baseline deaths) as a campaign

156

started on day 30 with 30% coverage, a campaign started on day 90 would

157

need to attain 80% coverage (Figure 4, right column, top row). However,

158

campaigns started on day 30 with ≥60% coverage resulted in levels of impact

159

(≥44% of baseline deaths averted) that could not be achieved by campaigns

160

started later, regardless of coverage level (examined up to 80% coverage)

161

(Figure 4, right column, top row).

Trends with respect to age prioritization, timing of introduction, and final

coverage levels were robust to choice of baseline scenarios, including changing

164

the level of transmission or ongoing migration (Supplementary Information).

165

Rural prioritization optimizes vaccination in the presence of ongoing migra-

166

tion

167

Finally we asked to what extent spatial (urban or rural) prioritization

168

could affect the impact of a COVID-19 vaccination campaign in an archety-

169

pal SSA setting. We again assumed that priority would be given to older

170

adults but that within each age tier, those in the prioritized spatial setting

171

would be vaccinated first. For example, for rural prioritization, we assumed

172

vaccine would go to rural individuals 70+ years, then urban 70+ years, ru-

173

ral 60-69 years, and so on. We also varied final coverage levels (20%, 50%,

174

or 80%), start dates of introduction (30, 90, or 180 days), and type of vac-

175

cine (acquisition- or disease-blocking). For our counterfactual, we assumed

176

a baseline of moderate transmission and ongoing migration (R0 = 2.4, mi-

177

gration = 20 000 dtpmi) or the extremes of a more confined or less confined

178

outbreak (R0 = 2.0, migration = 2000 dtpmi or R0 = 2.8, migration = 200

179

000 trips dtpmi, respectively) (cf. Figures 1, 2).

180

For the majority of vaccination scenarios, we found that rural priori-

181

tization would avert more infections, severe cases, and deaths than urban

182

prioritization (Figure 5). Urban prioritization achieved greater impact for

183

a small set of conditions: when the outbreak was largely confined to urban

184

areas (with low transmission and low migration) and vaccination was started

185

early in the outbreak (by day 30) (Figure 5, left column). For all other sce-

186

narios, including those with higher transmission or migration, or campaigns

187

started at later dates, rural prioritization resulted in greater impact (Fig-

188

ure 5, center and right columns). These differences were most pronounced

189

when impact was measured by infections averted. For other metrics such as

190

severe cases (Figure 5, rows 2 and 5), the differences between urban and ru-

191

ral prioritization tended to be modest but still significant, e.g., with medium

192

transmission and migration (R0 = 2.4, migration = 20 000 dtpmi, medium

193

migration). This was attributable to the prolonged spread of the epidemic in

194

such scenarios (Figure 1) as well as our assumption that age groups would be

195

given priority over spatial distribution such that in all scenarios in Figure 5,

196

older age groups were vaccinated first.

197

The acquisition-blocking vaccine had a higher impact on transmission

198

than the disease-blocking vaccine, particularly when impact was measured

199

by infections averted. However, differences in impact between the two vac-

200

cine types were strongly dependent on transmission trajectories over time,

201

coverage, and the start time of vaccine roll-out. In the low migration and low

202

transmission scenario (R0 = 2.0, migration = 2000 dtpmi), the two vaccines

203

were largely similar. For example, for campaigns prioritizing urban areas

204

started on day 30, both vaccines had negligible effects on infections averted

205

with 20% final coverage. These differences increased to 7% of infections (10%

206

and 3% with acquisition- and disease-blocking, respectively) with 80% final

207

coverage (Figure 5, left column) and decreased with delays in the start date

208

of vaccine roll-out. When transmission and migration were both higher (R0

209

= 2.4, migration = 20 000 dtpmi, medium migration), the epidemic per-

210

sisted longer (Figure 1), and larger magnitude differences between vaccine

211

types were observed. For campaigns prioritizing rural areas started on day

212

30, the difference between vaccine types was 3% of infections with 20% final

213

coverage and 15% of infections with 80% final coverage (Figure 5, middle

214

column). These modest absolute differences in impact were attributable to

the slow roll-out of vaccine over a 12-month period, particularly during the

216

first 9 months when <50% of the vaccine will have been distributed [17].

217

The differences between acquisition-blocking and disease-blocking vac-

218

cines were reduced when impact was measured by severe cases and deaths

219

(Figure 5). The acquisition-blocking vaccine resulted in 2-4% more severe

220

cases averted than the disease-blocking vaccine across transmission scenarios

221

due to the reduction in transmission (Figure 5, rows 2 and 5). However, the

222

difference between vaccine types was negligible for deaths averted (Figure 5,

223

rows 3 and 6). This was attributable to our assumption that both vaccines

224

provide protection against severe disease and deaths and that age groups

225

would be given priority over spatial distribution.

226

In all three transmission scenarios in Figure 5 as well as the remaining sce-

narios (Supplemental Information), increased NPI/PHSM that also reduced

migration maximized the impact of vaccination campaigns.

Discussion

230

By applying an agent-based model with discrete individuals, we found

231

that ongoing urban-rural migration has the potential to extend COVID-19

232

outbreaks in a SSA-like setting. With either low or high internal migration

233

rates, our model predicted that a single incidence peak at the country level

234

would follow introduction, predominated by cases in urban and rural areas,

235

respectively. However, with intermediate migration rates, our model pre-

236

dicted that an initial predominantly urban outbreak would be followed by a

237

second rural outbreak, resulting in two peaks and extending the duration of

238

the outbreak.

239

Each of these migration scenarios was in turn associated with a different

240

optimal vaccination strategy. When migration rates were low (whether due

241

to geography, NPI/PHSM, or other causes) and if the vaccine could be rolled

242

out quickly, the optimal strategy was to target urban areas, preventing the

243

predominantly urban outbreak. However, with higher rates of urban-rural

244

migration, targeting rural areas resulted in greater impact and was the opti-

245

mal strategy, consistent with the largely rural population in SSA. Delays in

246

vaccination also resulted in rural prioritization becoming the optimal strat-

247

egy, as urban areas experienced outbreaks faster than rural areas and a larger

248

proportion of the population resided in rural areas.

249

The differences in impact between urban and rural prioritization strate-

250

gies warrant consideration as countries begin vaccinating their populations in

251

larger numbers. We are not aware of any NDVPs (such as made available on

252

the WHO COVID-19 Partners Platform [18]) that distinguish between urban

253

and rural areas, though a few countries such as Mexico are reportedly prior-

254

itizing rural areas [19]. While WHO guidance on subnational allocation has

255

been limited to equity or logistical considerations, possible effects on impact

256

were not explored [7, 9, 8]. If resources are not intentionally directed to rural

257

areas, urban allocation is likely to be the default strategy throughout SSA

258

and other LMIC. For example, Ameyaw et al. examined Demographic and

259

Health Survey data from 2010-2018 and found that children in urban areas

260

were fully vaccinated at higher rates than their rural counterparts (by 53%

261

to 41%, respectively) [20]. While we do not consider other mitigating factors

262

such as the ease of distribution in urban areas, the question of whether to

263

vaccinate a larger, immunologically naive rural population or a smaller, pre-

264

viously exposed urban population encapsulates what we expect is a dilemma

265

that countries may be facing in the near future. In this study we found that

266

vaccinating rural areas may have benefits beyond equity.

267

Spatial prioritization complemented other strategies such as prioritizing

268

older adults, as recommended by official WHO guidance [2]. Prioritizing

269

younger adults with a vaccine effective against acquisition reduced the over-

270

all number of infections, but prioritizing older adults more greatly reduced

271

severe cases and deaths. The inability of prioritizing younger age groups to

272

prevent as many severe cases and deaths as prioritizing older age groups was

273

ultimately due to the anticipated slow roll-out of vaccine. This in turn reflects

274

current projections which foresee a 12-month roll-out to reach 20% coverage

275

that is back-loaded; approximately 50% of the available doses is expected to

276

come in the last three months [17]. This pace, even assuming coverage rates

277

>20%, make it difficult to achieve herd immunity fast enough to prevent

278

infections, severe cases, and deaths in older adults without direct targeting.

279

These results are consistent with other recent models on COVID-19 vaccine

280

impact [21, 4, 3].

281

Our model also supports the position that countries should begin their

282

vaccination campaigns as soon as possible. Campaigns that started later had

283

a limited capacity to make up for the delay in vaccination, even when higher

284

coverage levels were assumed. In many scenarios, larger campaigns that

285

started later resulted in more deaths than smaller campaigns that started

286

earlier. This supports the urgency to direct vaccine to SSA as quickly as

287

possible, a position espoused by COVAX [22], the African Union [23], and

288

civil society [24].

289

One question that we did not address directly is which scenario currently

290

best fits each country in SSA: which have high or low ongoing internal mi-

291

gration, or high or low transmission? Because both of these parameters are

292

abstracted in the model, we propose that a careful epidemiological assess-

293

ment would be needed for each country to measure the outcome of ongoing

294

migration if present: a high cumulative incidence in rural areas compared to

295

urban areas. For example, this might be accomplished through serosurveys

296

as in Niger State in Nigeria [12] or through genomic surveillance to track

297

variants as in South Africa [25], Nigeria [26], and Kenya [27]. Both studies

298

showed that infections spread from urban centers to rural areas and that ru-

299

ral areas were slower to see increases in incidence, consistent with a degree of

300

restricted migration. Both countries and others in SSA may still have large

301

immunologically naive populations in rural areas.

302

Our model was informed by a mix of historical data but plausibly rep-

303

resents a future scenario. For example, while almost all SSA countries saw

304

initial outbreaks during the year 2020, the example of Manaus, Brazil demon-

305

strates how new variants may evade even high levels of existing immunity

306

[28]. In such situations, future outbreaks may continue to resemble new

307

outbreaks, leading to successive almost-memoryless incidence peaks. In ad-

308

dition, the vaccine roll-out in SSA has been limited thus far, making our

309

assumption reasonable that future vaccinations will essentially be starting

310

anew. As of June 2021, the Africa CDC reported that less than 2% of mem-

311

ber country populations received at least one dose of any vaccine and less

312

than 0.5% have been fully vaccinated [29]. Therefore, variants and low ex-

313

isting vaccine-induced immunity suggest our model and other outbreak-type

314

models will continue to have relevance.

315

Our study had several limitations. As an abstraction of a SSA country

316

setting, our model represents an average in many respects: demographics

317

(ages, contact patterns, urban-rural localization), COVID-19 response (as

318

tracked by Oxford CGRT [30]), and a generic urban-seeded outbreak. This

319

abstraction represents a trade-off that allowed us to focus on outbreak scenar-

320

ios that may be applicable to many countries, though not precisely calibrated

321

to any particular country. Our model also had several parameters that were

322

abstractions of physical processes and not precisely matched to data. For ex-

323

ample, internal migration did not correspond to a particular indicator such as

324

mobile phone-based movement but represents an aggregate of this and other

325

factors contributing to net migration [31]. We also made several simplifying

326

assumptions on COVID-19 immunity and vaccines such as previous infection

327

leading to perfect immunity and optimistic vaccine characteristics such as

328

those based on mRNA vaccines [32, 33], as well as no opportunity for rein-

329

fection. We also did not explicitly account for any particular SARS-CoV-2

330

variants. However, by spanning a range of transmission rates, we accounted

331

for increased infectiousness expected of new variants. In this case, our se-

332

lected vaccine efficacy rates may represent best-case scenarios, with variants

333

further reducing the impact on infections, severe cases, and deaths.

334

In sum, our model supports the position that countries should consider

335

spatial prioritization among other factors when planning how to distribute

336

COVID-19 vaccine, particularly those in SSA where vaccine supplies are ex-

337

pected to be limited. These countries have an ongoing opportunity to adapt

338

their strategy and if necessary set up an infrastructure that allows vaccine

Methods

341

Model structure and demographics

342

COVID-19 transmission dynamics were simulated using EMOD, a soft-

343

ware platform for agent/individual-based epidemiological modeling of infec-

344

tious diseases [34]. EMOD was used to represent an archetypal country

345

in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) [35] through demographics (age pyramid and

346

urban-rural population distribution), contact structure, and mobility pat-

347

terns. Demographics were represented by taking the mean of each five year

348

age bin from the population pyramids in the SSA region [36]. The urban-rural

349

distribution of the population was obtained from published UN estimates,

350

and the mean was taken for all countries in SSA [15] (Figure 10). Contact

351

structures for the same set of age bins and countries in urban and rural set-

352

tings were obtained from Prem et al. [16]. These matrices were available for

353

home, school, workplace, and community settings, and a simple mean was

354

taken across SSA countries. To obtain the total contact matrices, we multi-

355

plied the NPI policy effect from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response

356

Tracker described below and then summed all four settings together. Mobil-

357

ity patterns represented the within-country movement of people as described

358

below. Baseline parameter values are provided in Table 1 except for contact

359

matrices which are provided in Supplemental Methods.

360

Individuals were created at model initialization and assigned (a) an age to

361

match the desired age distribution and (b) a node representing either urban

362

or rural settings to match the desired urban-rural population distribution.

363

In total the model contained 200 nodes with node1 representing an urban

364

setting and node2..200 representing rural settings with the same population

365

sizes at initialization (Figure 6). The urban node accounted for 40% of

366

the total population, while the rural nodes accounted for the remaining 60%.

367

This node structure was chosen to represent an SSA country having a capital

368

city serving as the main hub of international traffic and rural areas whose

369

residents travel to the capital city and other rural towns. Migration between

370

urban and rural nodes and between rural nodes was represented as a change

371

in the node assignment of individuals. The probability of a change in node

372

was calculated as the product of a base rate and the population sizes of

373

each pair of nodes, i.e., using a gravity-based model (Figure 6). The base

374

migration rate was not known a priori, so a range of values were evaluated

375

spanning several orders of magnitude (Table 1). This rate and other rates

376

in the model were implemented as exponentially distributed waiting times

377

between random events. Other demographic processes such as births, non-

378

disease deaths, and migration to other countries were assumed negligible on

379

the timescale of the model. The model was run for a simulated 2-year (730

380

day) duration.

381

COVID-19 epidemiology in the model

382

We represented COVID-19 outbreaks where an infected case was intro-

383

duced into a population that did not have pre-existing immunity (as hap-

384

pened in year 2020) or where a new SARS-CoV-2 variant might be intro-

385

duced that completely evades existing immunity. Individuals (agents) were

386

assumed to be in one of the following states: susceptible, infected, or re-

387

moved (recovered or dead). Infected individuals were seeded in the urban

395

ci,j was obtained from the age- and location-dependent contact rates from

396

Prem et al. [16] across settings and countries in SSA. Infected individuals

397

transitioned to the removed state with the sum rate of recovery and death,

398

i.e., the inverse of the total infectious duration. Removed individuals did

399

not return to the susceptible state which was equivalent to (a) births and

400

deaths being negligible on the timescale of the model and (b) recovered in-

401

dividuals having perfect immunity that did not wane on the timescale of the

402

model. Individual-level behaviors were also simulated to a limited extent:

403

10% of infected individuals were assumed to self-isolate which reduced their

404

contributions to transmission in their respective node by 80%.

405

Country-level events and policies in the model

406

To represent typical country-level policies to outbreaks, we included a

407

quantification of NPI/PHSM policy strengths implemented in SSA since early

408

2020. We obtained data from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response

409

Tracker (OxCGRT) Containment and Health Index which is the average of

410

14 sub-indexed indicators ranging between 0 and 100 where each sub-index

411

rates a specific type of policy on each day [30]. Dates in OxCGRT were

412

re-scaled to the date since first case reported to the WHO ([38], Table 2).

413

To derive a mean value for SSA, we used the mean N P It across countries

414

in SSA for each date since respective first case 7. (1 − N P It /100) was used

settings was assumed to be closed (i.e., with N P It = 100) for 135 days

417

after first reported case then reopened with the same contact rate multiplier

418

as work and community settings. The home setting was assumed to have

419

increased contact rates by 25% (i.e., with N P It = −25)). After the last day

420

of available N P It data, work, school, and community settings were assumed

421

to be opened to 75% of pre-COVID levels (i.e., with N P It = 25) to simulate

near-complete reopening in most SSA countries. We used the same multiplier

(1 − N P It /100) on migration between all spatial nodes in the simulation to

Vaccination in the model
COVID-19 vaccines in the model were represented as protecting individuals by one of the following mechanisms:

428

1. Acquisition-blocking: preventing susceptible individuals from becoming

429

infected (called efficacy against susceptibility, V ES in the biostatistical

430

literature [39])

431

432

2. Transmission-blocking: preventing shedding of infectious particles after
infection (efficacy against infectiousness, V EI , in the literature [39])

3. Disease-blocking: preventing individuals from developing symptomatic

434

disease (efficacy against symptomatic illness, V EP , in the literature

[39])

436

We assumed that vaccines would be highly efficacious and comparable to

437

the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna mRNA vaccines with >90% clinical trial

438

efficacy and effectiveness [32, 33]. We also made the simplifying assumption

439

that observed efficacy V Eobs was entirely attributable to either V ES or V EI

440

(see 1). That is, for an acquisition-blocking vaccine, we assumed V ES =

441

V Eobs and V EP = 1 resulting in all of the vaccinated individuals being

442

protected from disease progression despite infection. For a disease-blocking

443

vaccine, we assumed V EI = V Eobs , V EP = 1, again resulting in all of

444

the vaccinated individuals being protected from disease progression, even

445

if infected. Thus all vaccines, regardless of type, were assumed to prevent

446

severe disease and mortality. In the case of vaccines with lower efficacy, the

447

preventive effect on severe disease and deaths is also assumed to decrease

448

linearly. Finally, as our focus was on factors under the control of country

449

policymakers, we did not explicitly model SARS-CoV-2 variants or their

450

impact on vaccine efficacy. However, we expect that variants would have the

451

net effect of reducing impact similar to reduced coverage levels.

452

Vaccine availability followed the COVAX projections of vaccine supply

453

available from GAVI [17]. Briefly these projections assume vaccine will be-

454

come increasingly available over a period of 12 months until reaching a final

455

vaccination population coverage of Pvac = 20% or greater (Table 1).

456

Different age prioritization schemes were assumed to be available: oldest

457

first (in order: 70+ years, 60-69, 50-59, and 15-49), youngest first (in order:

458

15-49 years, 50-59, 60-69, and 70+), or random (all ages at the same time)

459

(Figure 9). Likewise, different spatial allocation schemes were assumed vi-

460

able: urban first, rural first, or random (equal priority to urban and rural ar-

461

eas) (Figure 9). Under random spatial prioritization, vaccine was distributed

462

to urban and rural nodes at a rate proportional to population size, e.g., at 1%

463

coverage, both 1% of the urban population and 1% of the rural population

464

would be covered. In the case of both age and spatial prioritization, age was

465

assumed to take precedence before spatial (urban, rural) setting.

466

At the individual (agent) level, if an individual was selected to receive a

467

vaccine, each dose was assumed to confer an increasing level of protection

468

until the level of protection specified by V ES , V EI , or V EP was attained

469

(Figure 8). This profile was chosen to reflect the Moderna scheduling of

470

28 days between first and second doses [33]. Individual efficacy (regardless

471

of type) was assumed to begin at 0% on day 0 and increase linearly until

472

reaching 80% of final efficacy on day 10. This was maintained until day

473

28 when a second dose was assumed administered, then efficacy increased

474

linearly until final efficacy was reached on day 35. We assumed that all

475

individuals selected for vaccination would receive both vaccine doses and

476

that individual protection would not wane on the timescale of the model.

477

Vaccination scenarios in the model used the same random number draws as

478

baseline scenarios so that the individual- and population-level characteristics

479

were the same until the vaccination campaign began. Each scenario was

480

run with 40 realizations to derive mean and standard deviation of summary

481

statistics.

under unmitigated (no NPI/PHSM) conditions to a high migration scenario

488

where 200 000 trips are completed each day.

489

With respect to vaccine distribution, we evaluated different final coverage

490

levels and vaccine distribution start times in addition to different age and

491

spatial prioritization strategies in urban and rural areas. Coverage levels were

492

varied from 20%-80% of the total population, while start times were varied

493

between 30-180 days after the first case. While the same start times were used

494

across different transmission scenarios, the number of infected individuals

495

varied depending on transmission intensity preceding the start of vaccine

496

distribution. Vaccine distribution start times could thus be considered a

497

proxy for different levels of population immunity at the start of a vaccination

498

campaign.

Contact structure, age pyramid, and government response tracker data

were available for 37 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, and all 37 countries

501

(shown in Figure 10) were used to develop a representative SSA country. A

502

full list of countries is available upon request.
