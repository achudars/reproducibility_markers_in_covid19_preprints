Abstract
Background
High prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in many northern hemisphere populations is causing
extreme pressure on healthcare services and leading to high numbers of fatalities. Even
though safe and effective vaccines are being deployed in many populations, the majority of
those most at-risk of severe COVID-19 will not be protected until late spring, even in
countries already at a more advanced stage of vaccine deployment.
Methods
The REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission study-1 (REACT-1) obtains throat
and nose swabs from between 120,000 and 180,000 people in the community in England at
approximately monthly intervals. Round 8a of REACT-1 mainly covers a period from 6th
January 2021 to 15th January 2021. Swabs are tested for SARS-CoV-2 virus and patterns of
swab-positivity are described over time, space and with respect to individual characteristics.
We compare swab-positivity prevalence from REACT-1 with mobility data based on the GPS
locations of individuals using the Facebook mobile phone app. We also compare results
from round 8a with those from round 7 in which swabs were collected from 13th November
to 24th November (round 7a) and 25th November to 3rd December 2020 (round 7b).
Results
In round 8a, we found 1,962 positives from 142,909 swabs giving a weighted prevalence of
1.58% (95% CI, 1.49%, 1.68%). Using a constant growth model, we found no strong
evidence for either growth or decay averaged across the period; rather, based on data from
a limited number of days, prevalence may have started to rise at the end of round 8a.
Facebook mobility data showed a marked decrease in activity at the end of December 2020,
followed by a rise at the start of the working year in January 2021. Between round 7b and
round 8a, prevalence increased in all adult age groups, more than doubling to 0.94%
(0.83%, 1.07%) in those aged 65 and over. Large household size, living in a deprived
neighbourhood, and Black and Asian ethnicity were all associated with increased
prevalence. Both healthcare and care home workers, and other key workers, had increased
odds of swab-positivity compared to other workers.
Conclusion
During the initial 10 days of the third COVID-19 lockdown in England in January 2021,
prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was very high with no evidence of decline. Until prevalence in
the community is reduced substantially, health services will remain under extreme pressure
and the cumulative number of lives lost during this pandemic will continue to increase
rapidly.

Introduction
As the COVID-19 pandemic enters 2021, northern hemisphere populations that have not
achieved ongoing containment ​[1]​ face substantial challenges. Although effective vaccines
are available ​[2,3]​, it will be many weeks until a substantial proportion of those most at-risk of
severe disease are protected, even in countries such as England where large-scale vaccine
roll-out for the most vulnerable groups has been implemented ​[4]​. Prevalence of infection at
the beginning of 2021 is at the highest levels ​[5]​ since the peak of the first wave in March
and April 2020 ​[6]​. There has been a sharp increase in infections since the beginning of the
second wave in autumn 2020, and, notwithstanding some fluctuations in prevalence
coinciding e.g. with school half-term holidays and the second lockdown in England,
prevalence has been high for many weeks ​[7]​. This has inevitably led to extreme demand for
health services and daily numbers of deaths as high or higher than the first wave of the
pandemic ​[8]​. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 is evolving epidemiologically into distinct lineages,
with potentially increased transmissibility ​[9]​ and significant antigenic changes ​[10]​.
England responded to the current situation with its third national lockdown, starting on 6th
January 2021 ​[11]​. People are asked to: stay at home whenever possible (including working
from home), only to do essential shopping and to meet outside only with one other person
from other households.
Here, we present results from the latest round (8a) of the REACT-1 study which commenced
self-administered swab-collection from large numbers of people on 6th January 2021
(though a small number of tests were obtained from the 30th December). We report results
from swabs collected up to and including 15th January (with a small number from
subsequent days) and compare the results with those from round 7 in which swabs were
collected from 13th November to 24th November (round 7a) and 25th November to 3rd
December 2020 (round 7b).
Results
In round 8a, we found 1,962 positives from 142,909 swabs giving a weighted prevalence of
1.58% (95% confidence interval, ​1.49%, 1.68%)​ (Table 1). This is the highest prevalence
recorded by REACT-1 since it started in May 2020 and represents a greater than 50%
increase from 0.91% (0.81%, 1.03%) observed during round 7b (when prevalence was
increasing). Since there was a gap of over one month from the end of round 7b on 3rd
December 2020 to beginning of round 8a on 6th January 2021 we may have missed a peak
in prevalence during the intervening period.

Using a constant growth model, we found no strong evidence for either growth or decay
averaged across the period of round 8a (Table 2, Figure 1), with estimated reproduction
number (R) at 1.04 (0.94, 1.15). However, we found evidence for non-constant growth within
round 8a; a logistic regression model with a smooth term gave ΔAIC > 6 compared with one
using only a constant term. Fitting a p-spline to the data across all rounds suggested
prevalence may have been declining at start of round 8a, from an unobserved earlier peak.
Based on data from a limited number of days, prevalence may have started to rise at the
end of round 8a (Figure 2). Using regional p-splines, sub-national prevalence was consistent
with the national pattern of a recent plateau or increase, other than in the South West, where
prevalence was decreasing (Table 3, Figure 3).
Mobility data from the Facebook app suggested that there was a marked decrease in activity
nationally at the end of December 2020, followed by a rise at the start of the working year in
January 2021 (Figure 4). These mobility patterns may help explain changes in prevalence
observed during January 2021.
We observed changes in weighted prevalence at the regional scale (Table 4, Figure 5)
between rounds 7b and 8a. Prevalence in round 8a was highest in London at 2.80% (2.47%,
3.17%), more than a doubling from 1.21% (0.91%, 1.59%) in round 7b. Prevalence also
more than doubled in: South East from 0.75% (0.59%, 0.95%) to 1.68% (1.51%, 1.87%);
East of England from 0.59% (0.43%, 0.81%) to 1.74% (1.52%, 1.99%); and West Midlands
from 0.71% (0.43%, 1.16%) to 1.76% (1.37%, 2.26%). In addition, prevalence increased in
the South West from 0.53% (0.36%, 0.78%) to 0.94% (0.75%, 1.19%) and there was an
apparent increase in North West. For the other regions, there was an apparent decrease in
prevalence in Yorkshire and The Humber while prevalence was broadly similar (comparing
rounds 7b and 8a) in East Midlands and North East.
We also investigated patterns by age and showed that between rounds 7b and 8a, weighted
prevalence increased in all adult age groups (Table 4, Figure 6). It was highest in 18 to 24
year olds with a weighted prevalence of 2.51% (1.95%, 3.22%), while prevalence in those
aged 65 and over more than doubled to 0.94% (0.83%, 1.07%) in round 8a from 0.41%
(0.30%, 0.56%) in round 7b.
Despite some uncertainty, age-prevalence patterns varied substantially by region (Figure 7).
From rounds 7b to 8a, we observed large increases at older ages in London, South East,
and East of England. In round 8a, London had the highest weighted prevalence nationally at
greater than 2% in those aged 55 to 64 and in those 65 years and over. In contrast, patterns
in Yorkshire and The Humber, North East and East Midlands did not show increases

between rounds 7b and 8a in older adult ages. In addition, we observed weighted
prevalence of over 4% in London among those aged 18-24 years in round 8a.
We found that large household size, living in a deprived neighbourhood, and Black and
Asian ethnicity were all associated with increased prevalence (Table 4). We observed a
monotonic increase in prevalence from the smallest to the largest households rising from
1.20% (1.02%, 1.42%) in single-person households to 3.46% (2.24%, 5.29%) in households
of seven or more people. People living in neighbourhoods in the two most deprived quintiles
had prevalence of 1.88% (1.58%, 2.24%) and 1.92% (1.69%, 2.16%) compared with 1.26%
(1.13%, 1.41%) for those in the least deprived neighbourhoods. We found increased
prevalence among participants of Black and Asian ethnicity at 3.42% (2.41%, 4.83%) and
2.61% (2.10%, 3.24%) respectively compared with 1.45% (1.36%, 1.55%) among white
participants. Patterns of prevalence for household size, neighbourhood deprivation and
ethnicity were reflected in elevated odds ratios for these variables in a jointly adjusted
logistic regression model (Table 5, Figure 8).
We also found increased odds of swab-positivity among healthcare and care home workers,
and other key workers, compared to other workers at 1.66 (1.38, 2.00) and 1.35 (1.20, 1.53)
respectively (Table 5, Figure 8).
We observed apparent heterogeneity in prevalence across England at lower-tier local
authority (LTLA) level using a nearest-neighbours statistic to generate smoothed prevalence
maps (Figure 9) and maps of differences in prevalence between sequential rounds (Figure
10). In round 7b (25th November to 3rd December 2020) we found areas of higher
prevalence in North East, southern parts of Yorkshire and The Humber, eastern and western
parts of East Midlands, east London and surrounding areas in East of England and South
East (parts of Essex and Kent). We saw a different pattern in round 8a (6th to 15th January
2021), where highest prevalence was in London and a contiguous area radiating out into
East of England and South East. We also saw pockets of high prevalence in other regions.
In addition, we observed high prevalence of swab-positivity across north, north-west and
south-east London (Figure 11).
Discussion
In the initial period of the third national lockdown in England, we did not observe a continued
decline in the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2, as was seen in the routine surveillance data for a
similar period ​[8]​. Rather, we observed a slight initial decline followed by a plateau or
possible increase, but with a weighted average prevalence substantially lower than that
reported for end December and beginning of January by the Office for National Statistics

Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey ​[5]​. It is therefore possible that prevalence may
have dropped substantially just prior to the start of REACT-1 round 8a.
The Facebook data presented here indicate a sharp drop in mobility in the last two weeks of
2020 followed by a return to intermediate levels during the first week of 2021. A relationship
between mobility data and transmissibility was documented during spring 2020 ​[12,13]​, and
we might expect the two still to be correlated: higher transmission from increased activity
starting on Monday 5th January 2021 may only just be feeding into routine surveillance data.
We therefore might expect to see a plateau or slight increase in routine surveillance data in
subsequent days.
A key limitation in our analysis is that the trends showing a plateau or upturn in prevalence
are based on data for a small number of days. However, regional prevalence trends also
support there being a plateau and possible upturn (Figure 3): seven of the nine regions
exhibited this pattern, while in one region (South West) there was a sharp decline. Also, the
trend we report could be biased by short-term changes in testing behaviour among
symptomatic individuals as they return to work. However, we obtain similar results for the
constant growth model when fitting only to swab-positivity among non-symptomatic
individuals (Table 2).
In the period prior to the widespread acquisition of vaccine-acquired immunity, high constant
or increasing prevalence -- with high rates in at-risk age groups -- has clear downstream
implications for healthcare utilization and deaths. A daily average of 950 deaths were
reported in England for the seven days prior to 8th January 2021 in people who had tested
positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the previous 28 days ​[8]​. Also on 8th of January, there were
29,346 COVID-19 inpatients in English hospitals, 55% more than the maximum during the
first wave ​[8]​. If the prevalence of infections in the community does not drop substantially in
the immediate future, these levels of hospitalization will lead to very high numbers of
additional deaths and potentially long-term negative impact on healthcare delivery in
England.
Methods
We have published the methods of the REACT programme ​[14]​. Briefly, between 120,000
and 180,000 people in the community in England have been taking part in the REACT-1
study at approximately monthly intervals. We invite a random sample of the population of
England from the list of National Health Service patients at LTLA level (n=315). We then
send a swab kit to individuals registering for the study and request they provide a
self-administered throat and nose swab or parent/guardian obtain such a swab for children

aged 5 to 12 years. We ask participants to refrigerate the sample for same or next day
pick-up by courier for RT-PCR in a single commercial laboratory, and to complete an online
or telephone administered questionnaire with information on symptoms, health and lifestyle.
We estimate time trends and reproduction number (R) using exponential growth models at
both national and regional levels, as well as smoothed estimates using a p-spline function
[15]​. We obtain estimates of prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection nationally and regionally,
both unweighted and weighted to be representative of the population, and by age, area
deprivation, occupation, household size and other characteristics. We also describe
geographic variation in prevalence by LTLA using neighbourhood-based spatial smoothing
as previously described ​[16]​. We estimate odds of swab-positivity using multivariable logistic
regression for a range of variables including employment, deprivation, ethnicity and
household size. Statistical analyses are carried out in R ​[17]​.
We obtained research ethics approval from the South Central-Berkshire B Research Ethics
Committee (IRAS ID: 283787).

Figure 8. ​Estimated odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for mutually-adjusted logistic
regression model of swab-positivity for​ rounds 7a, 7b and 8a.​ Models were adjusted for
gender, age group, region, key worker status, ethnicity, household size, and deprivation
index. The deprivation index is based on the Index of Multiple Deprivation (2019) at lower
super output area. Here we group scores into quintiles, where 1 = most deprived and 5 =
least deprived. HCW/CHW = healthcare or care home workers; Not FT, PT, SE = Not
full-time, part-time, or self-employed. *Yorkshire and The Humber.
