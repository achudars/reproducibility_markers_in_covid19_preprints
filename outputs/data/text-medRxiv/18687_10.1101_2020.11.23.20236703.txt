early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in order to recommend change on how evidence is
incorporated in the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR).
Design We used an abbreviated preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-

analysis protocol (PRISMA-P) and a search strategy aimed to identify studies that investigated
the effectiveness of travel-related measures (advice, entry and exit screening, medical
examination or vaccination requirements, isolation or quarantine, the refusal of entry, and
entry restrictions), pre-printed or published by June 1, 2020.
Results We identified 29 studies, of which 26 were modelled (vs. observational). Thirteen

studies investigated international measures while 17 investigated domestic measures (one
investigated both), including suspended transportation (24 studies), border restrictions (21),
and screening (5). There was a high level of agreement that the adoption of travel measures
led to important changes in the dynamics of the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic.
However, most of the identified studies investigated the initial export of cases out of Wuhan,
which was found to be highly effective, but few studies investigated the effectiveness of
measures implemented in other contexts. Early implementation was identified as a
determinant of effectiveness. Most studies of international travel measures failed to account

for domestic travel measures, and thus likely led to biased estimates. Poor data and other
factors contributed to the low quality of the studies identified.
Conclusion Travel measures, especially those implemented in Wuhan, played a key role in

shaping the early transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, the effectiveness
of these measures was short-lived. There is an urgent need to address important evidence gaps,
but also a need to review the way in which evidence is incorporated in the IHR in the early
phases of a novel infectious disease outbreak.
What is already known on this subject?
• Previous reviews of the evidence from outbreaks of influenza and other infectious disease have
generally found that there is limited evidence that travel-measures are effective at containing
outbreaks.
• However, it is unclear if the lessons from other infectious disease outbreaks would be relevant
in the context of COVID-19.
• Based on evidence at the time, WHO did not recommend any travel restrictions when it
declared COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.

What does this study add?
• This study rapidly reviews the evidence on the effectiveness of travel measures implemented in
the early phase of the pandemic on epidemiological countries.
• The study investigated both international and domestic travel measures and a wide range of
travel measures.
• The study finds that the domestic travel measures implemented in Wuhan were effective at
reducing the importation of cases internationally and within China. The study also finds that
travel measures are more effective when implemented earlier in the outbreak.
• The findings generate recommendations on how to incorporate evidence into the International
Health Regulations and highlights important research gaps that remain.

How might this affect future outbreaks?
• The findings of this study suggest the need to decouple recommendations of travel measures
from the declaration of a public health emergency of international concern.
• Highlights the need to evaluate the potential effectiveness of travel measures for each outbreak,
and not just assume effectiveness based on past outbreak scnearios.

Introduction

2

On January 31, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak of SARS-

3

CoV-2 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Based on information

4

available at the time, the International Health Regulations 2005 (IHR) Emergency Committee

5

explicitly did not recommend “any travel or trade restriction”.1 The IHR state that State Parties

6

should avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic in the adoption of measures

7

and that the measures should not be “more restrictive of international traffic and not more

8

invasive or intrusive to persons than reasonably available alternatives that would achieve the

9

appropriate level of health protection” (Article 43). Moreover, measures adopted should be

10

based on “scientific principles,” evidence and/or WHO guidance.

11
12

As early as December 31, 2019, the same day that China Centre for Disease Control first notified

13

WHO of a cluster of atypical pneumonia cases in Wuhan, some authorities (including Taiwan,

14

Russia, and Macau) began to impose targeted travel-related measures, mainly airport screening

15

of travellers from Wuhan.2 Within weeks, additional locations also restricted flights to or

16

suspended entry from Wuhan, including Mongolia, Australia, and North Korea. On January 23, a

17

cordon sanitaire

18

domestic travel in and out of the city.3 A day later, the measures were extended to all of Hubei

19

province. By March 2020, despite WHO’s recommendations, virtually all IHR (2005) States

20

Parties had implemented some form of cross-border travel-related measure in response to the

21

COVID-19 pandemic.4 This is, by far, the largest number of countries adopting such measures

22

during a PHEIC: only about a quarter of countries had imposed such measures during the 2009

was drawn around Wuhan, effectively suspending all international and

H1N1 pandemic and the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa.5–7 It is estimated that there was a

2

65% drop in international travel in the first half of 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.8

3
4

The near universal adoption of travel-related measures, especially in light of the potentially

5

large economic and social consequences, raises questions as to whether such measures can be,

6

and have been, effective at reducing international transmission of the virus during the

7

pandemic. Previous studies have suggested that certain travel-related measures have only

8

limited, or at best modest, effectiveness in containing outbreaks of influenza. A systematic

9

review of the effectiveness of international travel measures (screening, travel restrictions, and

10

border closures) to control pandemic influenza identified only 15 studies and found that

11

measures implemented early could delay local transmission by a few days or weeks, slow

12

international spread, and delay the epidemic peak in isolated locations by reducing the number

13

of seeding events.9 The review did not identify any evidence that screening methods were

14

effective but it did find that border closures had been effective in preventing virus introduction

15

to small island states during the 1918 influenza pandemic. However, the authors also concluded

16

that the overall evidence base on which they drew their conclusions was small and of low

17

quality.

18
19

A related but larger review of a broader range of measures, including travel advice, screening,

20

internal travel restrictions, and border closures, for both epidemic and pandemic influenza, also

21

found that travel restrictions could delay the arrival and spread of epidemics and that select

22

isolated locations may benefit from border closures. Once again, however, the overall size of

1

the effects was relatively small and the quality of evidence was found to be very low.10 Another

2

review of both international and domestic travel restrictions concluded that such measures

3

could delay, but not contain, dissemination of both pandemic and seasonal influenza after it

4

emerged.11 Based on the 23 studies identified, the review concluded that internal and

5

international border restrictions could delay the spread of an outbreak by one week and two

6

months, respectively, and that such restrictions could delay the spread and peak of epidemics

7

from between a few days to up to four months. However, the timing of the introduction of such

8

measures was key – the extent of the delay of spread was greatly reduced when restrictions

9

were imposed more than six weeks after the onset of an epidemic.

10
11

Beyond influenza, evidence from other infectious disease outbreaks is more limited. A

12

modelling study of travel restrictions implemented during the West African Ebola outbreak

13

estimated that they may have delayed further international transmission by a few weeks for

14

some countries.12 Given the low proportion of all international travellers originating in Ebola-

15

affected countries at that time, another study suggested that exit screening measures in

16

affected countries were likely to be more effective at reducing onward international

17

transmission than travel restrictions,13 a finding that was supported by another similar study.14

18

The travel advisories issued by WHO during the 2003 SARS outbreak, which led to substantial

19

declines in international travel to Hong Kong and Mainland China, were estimated to have

20

delayed the export of cases by only a few days.15 Importantly, other studies have suggested

21

that travel measures during outbreaks can be counter-productive by preventing countries from

22

launching effective epidemic responses,16 undermining the detection of cases, and causing

1

widespread economic effects on the travel industry itself.17 Since the onset of the pandemic, it

2

has become clear that the clinical features of COVID-19 make it more challenging than previous

3

infectious diseases to detect and contain,18 raising questions about whether evidence of

4

effectiveness from previous studies is even relevant for COVID-19.19

5
6

The goal of this paper is to review evidence of the effectiveness of travel-related measures

7

implemented during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, a time of many unknowns

8

regarding the clinical and epidemiological features of the novel coronavirus.

9

emergence of COVID-19, dozens of studies have been published or made available that

10

evaluate the effectiveness of travel-related measures in the context of the pandemic. A recent

11

Cochrane review of the literature on the effectiveness of international travel-related measures

12

to contain COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Middle-East respiratory

13

syndrome (MERS) identified 36 unique studies, of which only 25 were specific to COVID-19. The

14

review concluded that cross-border travel measures may limit the spread of disease across

15

national borders, specifically in terms of reducing the number of imported cases and delaying

16

or reducing epidemic development, although it found that the certainty of the reviewed

17

evidence was low to very low. Importantly, it did not consider travel-related measures adopted

18

within China at the outset of the pandemic or studies that evaluate interventions implemented

19

in combination. Given the widespread adoption of travel restrictions, and the likely enormous

20

economic and social consequences resulting from them, a fuller understanding of the

21

effectiveness of all of the measures adopted during the early phase of the outbreak is

warranted. While the question of whether the adoption of these measures is compliant with

2

the IHR has received attention in the literature,20,21 it is beyond the scope of this paper.

3

Methods

5

To conduct this review, we adopted an abbreviated version of the preferred reporting items for

6

systematic reviews and meta-analysis protocol (PRISMA-P) using the 17-point checklist.22 The

7

rationale for the study was the widespread adoption of travel-measures despite consensus view

8

at the time that such measures were largely ineffective, and in order to strengthen the

9

application of the IHR during this and future pandemics. The objectives were to rapidly review

10

evidence of the effectiveness of the full range of travel-measures adopted during the early

11

stage of the COVID-19 pandemic form both published and unpublished studies. We further

12

elaborate on other methods of the study below.

13
14

2.1 Search Strategy

15

Our search strategy was designed to be as inclusive as possible of all studies (as of June 1, 2020)

16

that provide new evidence of the effectiveness of any travel-related measure adopted during

17

the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the IHR, travel-related measures

18

include travel advice, entry and exit screening of travellers, medical examination or vaccination

19

requirements for travellers, isolation or quarantine of suspected or affected persons, the

20

refusal of entry of travellers, and restrictions on travellers from affected areas.1 While only

21

those measures that are applied by State Parties at the level of an international border are

22

covered by the IHR, many of these measures have also been applied to domestic travellers (e.g.

7

1

at the level of inter-provincial or inter-state borders). Private companies, such as airlines and

2

cruise ships, have also implemented travel measures, which, while also not subject to the IHR,

3

further restricted travel during this pandemic. We did not restrict the search to specific

4

outcomes (e.g. epidemiological or otherwise), or any specific methodological approach, or any

5

specific geography. We only identified one study that looked at non-epidemiological

6

outcomes,23 so while we include it in our description of the search and screening strategies, we

7

exclude it from our main analysis below.

8
9

Given the rapidly evolving nature of the outbreak, as well as the rapidly expanding published

10

literature on COVID-19, our search strategy targeted both pre-print and published articles, with

11

the strategies to identify each differing slightly. Keywords were identified based on both

12

inductive iterative testing of potential keywords, as well as deductively through papers

13

identified through other channels. Search terms were then refined to minimize overlap and to

14

maximize the number of studies that could be identified. While we did not impose a language

15

restriction, we did not specifically search in non-English sources.

16
17

For pre-print papers, we searched the BioRxiv and MedRxiv servers, which offer limited search

18

functionality, using the following keywords in the title field: travel*, flight*, airline*, border*,

19

airport*, passenger or air traffic. We restricted the sample to papers that also included at least

20

one COVID-19 keyword, either related to the virus itself (e.g. coronavirus, corona virus,

21

coronavirinae, coronaviridae, betacoronavirus, covid19, covid 19, covid-19, nCoV, CoV 2, CoV2,

22

sarscov2, 2019nCoV, novel CoV, OR Wuhan virus), the location of the early outbreak (e.g.

1

Wuhan, Hubei or Hunan) or less specific but widely used terms (severe acute respiratory OR

2

pneumonia AND outbreak). We used the same travel-related keywords to search the WHO’s

3

COVID-19 global research database but did not impose a COVID-19 search term as theoretically

4

all articles in this database were on this topic.b

5
6

For published papers, we searched PubMed with the following search strategy: studies must

7

include at least one COVID-19 keyword mentioned above or one of the location-specific terms

8

mentioned above combined with either (“severe acute respiratory” OR pneumonia AND

9

outbreak) or one of the following MESH terms (Coronavirus, Coronavirus Infections, or

10

Betacoronavirus) or the Supplementary Concept (COVID-19 or severe acute respiratory

11

syndrome coronavirus 2). All studies must in addition include at least one travel-related

12

measure term in the title or abstract (e.g. screening, travel advice, travel advisory, cordon

13

sanitaire, ban, restrict*, prohib*, or clos*) as well as one travel-related term in the title or

14

abstract (travel*, cruis*, ship*, terrest*, airplane, flight, plane, migrant, passenger, return,

15

outflow, outbound, inbound, inflow, traffic, arrival, train, trains, bus, buses, transit, port*,

16

airport*, tourist*, international importation, international exportation, case importation,

17

imported cases, exported cases, or border).

2.2. Screening strategy

20

As of June 1, 2020, we identified a total of 312 articles, and during the review process, we

21

identified another 8 articles through other sources (see Figure 1). From all identified studies

1

(n=320), we removed duplicates, which left 300 articles to be screened. We uploaded the

2

abstracts into Covidencec, software developed for systematic reviews, to perform a title and

3

abstract screen. Our inclusion criteria were that studies must investigate the COVID-19

4

pandemic and at least one travel-related measure (applied either at an international or

5

domestic border), must be empirical (i.e. modelled or observational), and must evaluate a

6

specific outcome (epidemiological or other). Measures could have been undertaken by either a

7

public (i.e. a government) or a private actor (e.g. an airline). We excluded articles that were

8

news reports, review articles, commentaries or editorials, or conjecture (i.e. did not provide

9

new data or evidence) about the effectiveness of travel measures. Each article was screened by

10

2 independent reviewers (TLH, LZH). Where there was disagreement among the reviewers, a

11

third reviewer (KAG) resolved any disagreement.

12
13

After screening, we were left with 79 articles. The full texts of each were obtained and again

14

uploaded into Covidence. Two reviewers again screened each article to determine if the article

15

still met the inclusion criteria. Any disagreements by the two reviewers were again by a third

16

reviewer (KAG) who was not otherwise involved in the screening process. After the full-text

17

screening, we were left with 30 studies that met all of our selection criteria. Of these, one study

18

investigated socio-economic outcomes, which we exclude from this analysis given the lack of

19

overlap in outcomes.

We continued to search the relevant databases for any newly published papers or to identify

2

papers that had originally been identified as pre-prints but were subsequently published, until 1

3

June 2020. We retained the subsequently published versions of such papers.

2.4 Data extraction

6

For the remaining 29 studies, we extracted the title, authors, article source, publication date,

7

whether it was a pre-print or published (or had previously been a pre-print) article, country

8

context in which the study was conducted (or global), country(ies) implementing the measure,

9

the country(ies) affected by the travel measure, specific measure(s) adopted, the timing of the

10

measures, the duration of the measures, whether the study was modeled or based on

11

observational data, the type of model used, epidemiological assumptions made in the models,

12

the specific outcomes observed, the overall findings, the way in which cases/deaths were

13

recorded, whether there was any description of diagnostic methods used to identify

14

cases/deaths, whether the study made assumptions about asymptomatic cases, whether the

15

study also accounted for secondary transmission, the extent to which the model also accounted

16

for other measures imposed around the same time, the data sources used in the study, and the

17

stated limitations of each study. For modelled studies, we also collected the name of the model

18

used if an existing model was used, whether the model used was a dynamic or static model,

19

whether the model used was a stochastic or deterministic model, and whether it was an

20

individual vs. population-based model. A full list of the papers is presented in Appendix Table 2.

1

We characterized the investigated travel-related measures into four groups: suspended

2

transportation, border restrictions, entry or exit screening, and entry quarantine, which are

3

summarized in Table 1. Papers may have investigated more than one measure and thus may

4

contribute more than once to the table. In our analysis, we grouped studies according to

5

whether the measure affected international (Table 2) or domestic travellers (Table 3). One

6

study fit both criteria and thus is listed twice in the analysis. We used a narrative approach to

7

synthesize the evidence of effectiveness. Two studies,24,25 despite study design and state

8

objectives to investigate the impact of travel related measures, did not present their findings in

9

such away that allowed us to extract the evidence generated in the study.

10

These are

summarized in appendix table 2 but not in tables 2 or 3.

11
12

2.6. Analysis of outcome measures

13

Outcomes included the number of observed cases, date of the epidemic peak, risk of

14

transmission, case growth rate, doubling time, time of arrival in a new country, the

15

reproductive number (R0 or Rt), and projected cumulative cases. Details are listed in Table 2 and

16

Table 3, which summarize papers that investigate international and domestic travel measures

17

respectively. One article that evaluated the effectiveness of both types of measures,26 appears

18

in both tables.

Individual articles were assessed for bias using a proprietary scoring system consisting of three

22

tiers: low, moderate, and high risk of bias. Low scores were given when the author had

regards to their ability to form a clear and precise definition of the research question, travel

restriction measures included in the analysis, comprehensiveness of outcome, suitable

mathematical modelling, model assumptions described, confounding factors, model validation,

and uncertainty assessment.27 A detailed summary of our bias assessment is presented in

Results

10

Of the 29 identified studies in this rapid review, 24 had been published by September 1, 2020,

11

while the rest were pre-print studies (see Table 1). Almost all of the studies (26) were modelled

12

studies with few observational studies (3). Given the timing of the studies, almost all of the

13

studies focused on the initial exportation of cases from Wuhan either domestically within China

14

or internationally. Among the travel-related measures adopted, the most commonly

15

investigated were suspended transportation (24), border restrictions (21), and screening (5).

16

Only four studies investigated entry quarantine.

Effectiveness of travel-related measures on the international spread of COVID-19

19

In Table 2, we present the summary of evidence generated from the papers that investigated

20

the impact of international travel measures. All but one28 were modelled studies. Four studies

modelled estimates without the ban, studies consistently found that these measures were

2

highly effective at reducing exportation of cases. Anzai et al. estimated a 70% reduction in

3

exported cases globally in the week following the introduction of the ban,29 Chinazzi et al.

4

estimated that the ban led to a 77% reduction in imported cases,26 while Wells et al. estimated

5

that it reduced the risk of exportation by about 80% through mid-February.30 Kucharski

6

estimated that transmission rates outside of China were reduced by about half in the two

7

weeks following the introduction of the ban.31 However, Anzai et al., which focused on the

8

impact of the ban on the outbreak in Japan, estimated that the absolute risk of a major

9

outbreak was only modestly delayed due to the Wuhan travel ban and that the median time

10

delay in a major outbreak was only 1-2 days.29

11
12

Beyond the direct effect of the Wuhan travel ban, Chinazzi et al. estimated that the application

13

of additional travel-related restrictions, on travellers to and from Mainland China by receiving

14

countries, led to additional reductions in imported cases globally, though the extent of

15

reduction varied by country.26 Adiga et al. investigated the impact of government or airline-

16

imposed travel-related measures and estimated that these led to a delay in the importation of

17

the virus by about 4-5 days on average and up to 10 days in select countries.32 This study,

18

however, did not directly control for the impact of the Wuhan lockdown, which happened

19

around the same time as many of the measures investigated.

20
21

In terms of specific country case studies, Adekunle et al. found that Australia’s ban on air travel

22

to and from China may have prevented 82% of imported cases through February 2.33 Similarly,

Costantino et al. estimated that it may have led to a 79% reduction in imported cases through

2

March 2.34 Linka et al. estimated that the travel restrictions implemented both at the external

3

and internal borders of the European Union significantly decreased the speed of virus spread

4

across member states, especially in Central European countries.35 These last two studies, both

5

of which focused on an earlier period in the pandemic, failed to account for the impact of the

6

Wuhan lockdown in addition to the restrictions evaluated.

7
8

Studies that investigated the effectiveness of screening found that only very highly effective

9

screening could reduce [or decrease] the risk of importation or exportation. Clifford et al. found

10

that when the number of cases was low in the exporting country, screening may delay the

11

onset of the epidemic in the importing country by up to a week36 while Mandal et al. found that

12

if screening could detect 90% of asymptomatic individuals, it could delay the average time of

13

the epidemic by up to 20 days in select countries.37Assuming that self-identification of cases

14

was effective, another study suggested that such measures could identify a large proportion of

15

infected travellers. However, this assumes that screening is effective but does not study this

16

directly.30

17
18

A single observational study identified in this review investigated the impact of border

19

restrictions, in combination with mandatory quarantine and screening, for incoming travellers

20

to Hong Kong. Cowling et al. concluded that the application of quarantine measures of

21

incoming travellers into the region was an important element of their successful public health

measures including travel-related measures.28

Effectiveness of travel-related measures on the domestic spread of COVID-19 within China

5

In Table 3, we present the findings from the studies that investigated the impact of the Wuhan

6

travel restrictions, on the domestic export of cases to other parts of China. By comparing actual

7

observed cases to counterfactual scenarios where such measures had not been imposed,

8

Chinazzi et al. predicted that the travel ban led to a 10% reduction of exported cases within the

9

first 7 days,38 Fang et al. estimated a 39.3% reduction over one month,38 Shi et al. similarly

10

identified a 39% reduction in cases over one month,39 while Tian et al. estimated a 73%

11

reduction through mid-February.40 Tang et al. found that the Wuhan travel ban led to a 91.1%

12

reduction in imported cases in Beijing over 7 days.41 Similarly, Kraemer et al. also found that

13

these travel measures dramatically reduced the transmission of the outbreak across the

14

country, with areas which had greater pre-lockdown connectivity with Wuhan experiencing a

15

greater decline.42 Aleta et al. estimated that the measures were effective in reducing the

16

exportation of cases, but only in the short term.43 Yuan also found the lockdown to be effective

17

at reducing the number of cases outside of Wuhan but notes that the timing also coincided with

18

a nationwide stay at home campaign imposed by the central Chinese government.44

19
20

Studies also investigated the impact of the travel ban on the domestic timing of the outbreak.

21

Tian at el. estimated the ban delayed outbreaks within China by 2.91 days,40 while Chinazzi et al.

22

estimated a delay of 3 to 5 days.26 Studies also investigated the impact of the travel ban on the

16

effective reproductive rate, the doubling time, and other measures. Hou et al. found that the

2

ban quickly reduced the reproductive rate of the virus outside of Wuhan,45 similarly Li et al.

3

found that the reproductive number dropped by more than half within 2 weeks of the

4

introduction of the ban,46

5

the virus increased from 2 days to 4 days after the travel ban was imposed.47 Another study

6

found substantial declines in transmission routes between Chinese provinces within weeks of

7

the introduction of the Hubei travel bans.

Using observational data, Lau et al found that the doubling time of

8
9

The timing of travel-related measures, again, appears to be important in predicting

10

effectiveness. Both Lai et al. and Liu et al., the former a modelled study and the latter an

11

observational study, estimated that the Wuhan travel ban would have been substantially more

12

effective if implemented 1-3 weeks earlier.48,49 This is supported by Wu et al. who found that

13

the travel ban had a relatively minor effect on the overall speed of transmission of the outbreak

14

in areas of China outside of Wuhan, largely because a large number of cases had already been

15

exported before the travel ban, limiting its effectiveness.50

16
17

Finally, a few studies evaluated domestic travel bans in combination with other travel-related

18

measures. For example, one modelled study estimated that if major cities within China had

19

imposed additional measures, they could have further reduced their epidemic risk.51

1

Our review of the risk of bias in the included studies (Appendix Table 1) suggests that, apart

2

from a few exceptions, while most of the studies had clear research questions, descriptions of

3

the travel-related measure(s) evaluated, and discussions of the outcomes, few of the studies

4

made efforts to adequately control for the presence of other public health or travel-related

5

measures implemented at the same time, or for other contextual factors that could influence

6

the impact of travel-related measures. One important challenge common to all of the studies

7

was the quality of data on detected cases early on in the pandemic and only a small number of

8

the studies allowed for their estimates to vary based on potential ranges of the number of true

9

cases that were actually detected early in the outbreak (e.g. Chinazzi et al. estimated 24.4% of

10

all cases were undetected,26 Fang et al. estimated 42.0- 80.0% were undetected,38 Kucharski et

11

al. predicted that there were at least ten times as many cases as were confirmed in Wuhan in

12

early February31). The studies also varied markedly in their efforts to validate their models or

13

provide uncertainty analysis around their estimates. Also, with the exception of a few studies,

14

most studies did not discuss the potential measurement error associated with case data

15

collected during the early phases of the pandemic which likely did not capture most

16

asymptomatic cases. The overall quality of the studies to evaluate effectiveness was thus

17

relatively low.

Discussion

20

Despite WHO’s recommendations against travel restrictions, and given limited evidence of the

21

effectiveness of such measures at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an

22

unprecedented adoption of such measures, both domestically and internationally, which has

18

1

led to dramatic declines in international travel. This paper reviews the emergent evidence on

2

the effectiveness of travel-measures adopted during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.

3
4

A number of key findings emerge from this rapid review of the effectiveness of measured

5

adopted in the early phase of the pandemic. First, there was a high level of agreement among

6

the studies that the adoption of travel measures played an important role in shaping the early

7

transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, almost all the studies in this

8

review focused on either domestic or international travel bans imposed on Wuhan, and to a

9

lesser extent the rest of China, during the early period of the pandemic. This review does not

10

identify substantial new evidence of the effectiveness of travel-related measures aimed at

11

controlling spread to and from other parts of the world.

12
13

Second, the evidence suggests that the Wuhan travel measures were likely effective at reducing

14

the initial exportation of the virus within China and abroad. At the international level, studies

15

consistently estimated that these measures led to a 70-80% reduction in cases exported in the

16

first few weeks, and likely had a smaller effect within Mainland China, where estimates of

17

effectiveness ranged from 10-70%. Also, the Wuhan travel ban likely led to delays of up to a

18

few weeks in the importation of cases to other countries. However, most of the studies also

19

concurred that the effects were short-lived. This suggests travel-related measures alone are

20

unlikely to significantly change the trajectory of the outbreak unless commensurate domestic

21

measures are also implemented. This is supported by evidence that once four or more

19

1

infections are introduced into a new location, there is an over 50% chance that a major

2

outbreak will occur.31

3
4

Third, the studies reviewed suggest a key factor influencing the effectiveness of travel-related

5

measures was timing. Within China, had the same policies been implemented a few weeks

6

earlier, it is likely there may have been substantially less seeding of new outbreaks across the

7

country and internationally. While the measures aimed at Wuhan significantly reduced the

8

exportation of cases from the province, over time other provinces became the source of most

9

of the internationally exported cases. Where authorities are not able or willing to adopt such

10

measures at a sufficiently early stage of an outbreak, once again, this suggests the need to give

11

commensurate attention to strengthening the role of other domestic measures such as testing,

12

contact tracing, and physical distancing.

13
14

Fourth, many of the studies focused on international travel failed to account for the

15

implementation of the domestic Wuhan travel ban. Although this was a domestic policy, and

16

thus outside the remit of the IHR, evidence suggests restricting travel to and from Wuhan

17

dramatically changed the outflow of cases from the region at a crucial time period. Studies that

18

did not account for the Wuhan travel ban in their estimates, or reviews that excluded domestic

19

travel measures, thus likely overestimated the effectiveness of international travel measures.

20

The notable exception was Chinazzi et al. who conclude that the additional measures provided

21

a benefit above and beyond the effect of the Wuhan measures, at least in the short run.26

1

Fifth, during the early phase of the pandemic there were likely large numbers of undetected

2

cases globally, and although some studies allowed for their estimates to vary based on assumed

3

proportions of undetected cases, the validity of the estimated effects in all of these studies is

4

likely affected by data quality issues. Also, given that symptomatic individuals may be more

5

likely to curb their travel than asymptomatic travellers, especially internationally and after the

6

introduction of travel-related measures aimed at detecting symptomatic cases, modelled

7

effectiveness studies may also be biased if they do not account for this difference. In addition,

8

it is also possible that some of the travel-related measures adopted (e.g. screening) could have

9

actually led to increased detection of cases,46 which could further complicate the ability of

10

studies to evaluate effectiveness as the measurement of the outcome is influenced by the

11

intervention itself and few studies acknowledged this limitation.

12
13

Finally, while this study identified a relatively large number of studies, we assess the quality of

14

these studies overall to be low. Almost all of the studies identified in this review were

15

modelled studies, and therefore the results depend upon important parameter assumptions,

16

which varied considerably. Given the rapidly evolving and dynamic nature of the pandemic, it is

17

unclear how close to reality these assumptions were. Comparability across the studies is also

18

undermined by a lack of standardized terminology. Furthermore, few studies attempted to

19

isolate the potential effect of international travel-related measures from a range of domestic

20

measures implemented concurrently, as well as from other social, political, or economic

21

characteristics of the implementing or target locations or populations.

1

This systematic review also has several important limitations of its own. First, while we aimed

2

to be systematic in our search strategy as well as inclusion criteria, the rapidly expanding

3

literature on COVID-19 pandemic almost certainly means that we likely overlooked some

4

relevant studies. Second, although we aimed to focus on the early phase of the outbreak, it is

5

unclear when the appropriate time was to end our review. Newer studies that have been

6

published since we ended searching the literature may present a different picture on the

7

effectiveness of travel measures and thus the evidence from this study must be evaluated in

8

this context. Third, assessments of bias in studies is challenging and is inherently subjective in

9

nature.

10
11

In recent months, a process has commenced to review and strengthen the IHR. The universal

12

use of travel-related measures by States Parties during the COVID-19 pandemic will be a major

13

focus of discussion on the limitations of the current treaty. Based on this review, we make the

14

following recommendations. First, the findings of this review suggest that it is difficult to know

15

in the early phases of an infectious disease outbreak how effective travel measures are likely to

16

be, based on evidence from previous studies. Overall, the findings of the review suggest that

17

while it is likely that travel measures can affect the early dynamics of an infectious disease

18

outbreak, their effectiveness in delaying or reducing international spread is likely to be limited

19

on their own and short-lived. But the review also finds that the way in which these measures

20

are adopted likely influences their effectiveness. This highlights the need to from blanket

21

assessments of the effectiveness of travel-related measures (“travel measures don’t work”), to

22

1

context-specific assessments of effectiveness based on scenarios of transmission risk (“when

2

might such measures be effective”?).

3
4

Second, it is also clear that the effectiveness of travel-measures cannot be estimated using a

5

single fixed parameter. The effectiveness of measures will vary based on the setting, which

6

other measures are also implemented, the extent to which they are implemented, and the

7

speed at which they are implemented. All of these factors, weighed against potential harms,

8

need to be taken into consideration in discussions about the potential effectiveness of

9

international travel measures.

10
11

Third, this study finds that measures implemented early were likely more effective than those

12

implemented late. In this pandemic, the WHO did not make any recommendations on travel

13

restrictions until it had issued the PHEIC, weeks after when many countries had already

14

implemented such measures, and when it did, it had recommended against such measures

15

based on the limited evidence available at the time. In addition, the IHR require State Parties to

16

provide evidence for any additional health measures that they implement. In the context of an

17

outbreak of a novel infectious disease agent, it is unclear what justifies evidence in the early

18

phases of the outbreak. The role of evidence in the IHR in such settings therefore needs to be

19

reconsidered.

20
21

This review also highlights areas where more research is urgently needed to understand the

22

appropriate role of travel measures during PHEICs.

First, a greater understanding of

23

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.23.20236703; this version posted November 24, 2020. The copyright holder for this

1

effectiveness of travel measures adopted globally, and at stages beyond the early phases of the

2

pandemic are urgently needed. Second, there is also a need to better understand the broad

3

range of measures affecting travel and trade beyond those covered in the reviewed studies,

4

including the role of testing, which was not widely available during the early phase of the

5

pandemic. Third, lack of data on true case numbers remains an underlying challenge across all

6

of the study reviewed, and thus needs to be taken more seriously in future studies. Fourth,

7

models need to better account for the way in which travel measures work in tandem with other

8

measures implemented concurrently, including domestic travel measures and other public

9

health measures. Fifth, studies need to better account for the possibility that some locations

10

see grater benefit from travel measures than others based on geographic and socioeconomic

11

factors. Finally, one of the rationales against the use of travel measures is their economic and

12

social impacts, yet few studies in the early phases evaluated their non-epidemiological

13

outcomes.

14
15

At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a widely held belief that travel measures

16

were unlikely to play much of a role in curbing international spread of the virus. However, the

17

widespread adoption, and persistent use of such measures, globally, as well as some of the

18

evidence identified in this review, challenge this belief. While this review emphasizes that the

19

quality of evidence remains low and highlights a number of methodological shortcomings in the

20

reviewed studies, this review also identified new evidence of the impact of such measures

21

during the early phase of the pandemic. These findings suggest such measures did play an

22

important role in shaping early dynamics of the pandemic, even if they were unable to contain

Further reduce the number of cases to between

Transmission rates in four
metropolitan areas of China

Different contract rates were assumed to
result from reduced population flow.

Travel restrictions contributed to a reduction in
the contact rate and reduced the time to peak and
the number of cases.

Even a 50% reduction in inter-city mobility
would have a negligible effect on the epidemic
dynamics.

A mean values of 129 cases exported per 10,000
people who left Wuhan
Travel measures implmented 2 days earlier An estimated 1420 (95% CI: 1059, 1833) cases
would have been prevented.
Travel measures implmented 2 days later An estimated 1462 (95% CI: 1059, 1833)
additional cases would have happened.

Border control and quarantine Arrival time outside of
Wuhan

Theoretical application of measures

Early detection and isolation of cases more
effective than travel restrictions; travel restricts
reduced the number of cases outide of Wuhan as
well as its geographic spread.
If interventions were conducted one, two, or
three weeks earlier, cases will reduce by 66%,
86%, or 95% respectively.
If interventions were conducted one, two, or
three weeks later, cases may increase 3-fold, 7fold, or 18-fold respectively
Arrival time is delayed by 32.5 days and 44 days
under a low R0 (1.4) but under higher R0 (2.92)
only 10 extra days can be gained.
