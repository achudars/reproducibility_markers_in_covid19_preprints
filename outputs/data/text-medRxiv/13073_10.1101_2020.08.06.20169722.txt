ABSTRACT
Objective: To estimate the range of the age- and sex-specific infection fatality risk (IFR) for severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) based on confirmed coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19) deaths and excess all-cause deaths.
Design: Nationwide population-based seroepidemiological study combined with two national
surveillance systems.
Setting and participants: Non-institutionalized Spanish population of all ages.
Main outcome measures: The range of IFR was calculated as the observed number of COVID-19
deaths and excess deaths divided by the estimated number of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the noninstitutionalized Spanish population. Laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 deaths were obtained from the
National Epidemiological Surveillance Network (RENAVE) and excess all-cause deaths from the
Monitoring Mortality System (MoMo) up to July 15, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 infections were derived
from the estimated seroprevalence by a chemiluminiscent microparticle immunoassay for IgG
antibodies in 61,092 participants in the ENE-COVID nationwide serosurvey between April 27 and
June 22, 2020.
Results: The overall IFR (95% confidence interval) was 0.8% (0.8% to 0.9%) for confirmed COVID19 deaths and 1.1% (1.0% to 1.2%) for excess deaths. The IFR ranged between 1.1% (1.0% to 1.2%)
and 1.4% (1.3% to 1.5%) in men and between 0.6% (0.5% to 0.6%) and 0.8% (0.7% to 0.8%) in
women. The IFR increased sharply after age 50, ranging between 11.6% (8.1% to 16.5%) and 16.4%
(11.4% to 23.2%) in men ≥80 years and between 4.6% (3.4% to 6.3%) and 6.5% (4.7% to 8.8%) in
women ≥80 years.
Conclusion: The sharp increase in SARS-CoV-2 IFR after age 50 was more marked in men than in
women. Fatality from COVID-19 is substantially greater than that reported for other common
respiratory diseases such as seasonal influenza.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC
Infection fatality risk (IFR) for SARS-CoV-2 is a key indicator for policy decision making, but its
magnitude remains under debate. Case fatality risk, which accounts for deaths among confirmed
COVID-19 cases, overestimates SARS-CoV-2 fatality as it excludes a large proportion of
asymptomatic and mild-symptomatic infections. Population-based seroepidemiological studies are a
valuable tool to properly estimate the number of infected individuals, regardless of symptoms. Also,
because ascertainment of deaths due to COVID-19 is often incomplete, the calculation of the IFR
should be complemented with data on excess all-cause mortality. In addition, data on age- and sexspecific IFR are scarce, even though age and sex are well known modifiers of the clinical evolution of
COVID-19.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
Using the ENE-COVID nationwide serosurvey and two national surveillance systems in Spain, this
study provides a range of age- and sex-specific IFR estimates for SARS-CoV-2 based on laboratoryconfirmed COVID-19 deaths and excess all-cause deaths. The risk of death was very low among
infected individuals younger than 50 years, but it increased sharply with age, particularly among men.
In the oldest age group (≥80 years), it was estimated that 12% to 16% of infected men and 5% to 6%
of infected women died during the first epidemic wave.

INTRODUCTION
The infection fatality risk (IFR)—the proportion of infected individuals who die from the infection—is

a key indicator to design public health policies to control infectious diseases. Because the magnitude
of the IFR for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains under
debate,1,2 lockdowns and other extreme forms of social distancing have been questioned as appropriate
responses to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
An accurate estimation of the IFR of SARS-CoV-2 is difficult. Even if all symptomatic infections
were diagnosed, something that so far has not occurred in most countries, asymptomatic infections
cannot be clinically identified. Therefore, estimating the IFR needs to rely on population-based
serosurveys that provide an estimate of the proportion of individuals that has been infected, regardless
of symptoms.3 Also, because ascertainment of deaths attributable to COVID-19 is often incomplete,
the calculation of the IFR can be complemented with data on excess mortality.
A recent unpublished review of 24 serological reports4, several of them also unpublished, estimated an
overall IFR of 0.68% (95% confidence interval 0.53% to 0.83%). However, the methodological
quality of many of these studies was questionable, with some exceptions5. IFR estimates were mostly
based only on surveillance-registered deaths, and there was a very high between-study heterogeneity,
with estimates ranging from 0.16% to 1.60%. Also, because the IFR for SARS-CoV-2 is expected to
increase with age and may differ by sex, overall crude IFR estimates cannot be directly compared
between populations with different age and sex structure (e.g., China and Western Europe). Accurate
and reliable age- and sex-specific estimates of IFR are urgently needed.
Here, we report overall and age- and sex-specific IFR estimates for SARS-CoV-2 from ENE-COVID,
a large nationally representative serosurvey in the non-institutionalized Spanish population.

METHODS
Estimation of the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections
We calculated the prevalence of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in the non-institutionalized
Spanish population using data from ENE-COVID, a nationwide population-based serosurvey whose
design has been described elsewhere.6 Briefly, 1,500 census tracts, and up to 24 households within
each tract, were randomly selected using a two-stage sampling stratified by province and municipality
size. All residents of the 35,883 selected households were invited to participate in the study, which
was carried out between April 27 and June 22, 2020 in three two-week rounds, with a one-week break
between rounds. Epidemiologic questionnaires and serology tests were administered to 68,292
individuals who participated in at least one round.7 The study used two immunoassays to detect IgG
antibodies: a point-of-care test (Orient Gene Biotech COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid test Cassette), and a
chemiluminiscent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) that required venipuncture (SARS-CoV-2 IgG
for use with ARCHITECT; Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA; reference 06R8620), with
better performance characteristics (see supplementary methods and supplementary figure 1 for a
summary of reported sensitivity and specificity estimates of the CMIA test).6
We calculated the seroprevalence, overall and in strata defined by age and sex, as the proportion of
participants who had detectable IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in any round by the CMIA test
(61,092 participants had a valid CMIA result). To account for the different sampling selection
probabilities by province and to adjust for non-response to the CMIA test based on sex, age, and
census tract average income, we assigned sampling weights to each study participant. Design-based
standard errors for seroprevalences were computed taking into account the stratification by province
and municipality size group and the clustering of seropositivity by household and census tract.6
In sensitivity analyses, we corrected the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence estimates for the CMIA’s
sensitivity and specificity, which were estimated to be 90.6% (95% confidence interval 88.1% to
92.6%) and 99.3% (99.0% to 99.5%), respectively, from a meta-analysis of 23 diagnostic accuracy
studies (see supplementary methods and supplementary figure 1 for details).

We calculated the number of seropositive persons in Spain by multiplying the age- and sex-specific
prevalences of IgG antibodies times the size of the corresponding non-institutionalized Spanish
population groups as of July 15, 2020.8
Estimation of the number of deaths due to COVID-19
Given the practical difficulties in reporting and adjudicating deaths from COVID-19 during the
epidemic, we estimated the IFR separately using confirmed COVID-19 deaths and excess all-cause
deaths.9 The two sources of information were the Spanish National Epidemiological Surveillance
Network (RENAVE) and the Monitoring Mortality System (MoMo).
RENAVE10,11 provided individual data on the 29,137 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 deaths
registered in Spain up to July 15, 2020. There were 249 deaths (0.9%) with missing demographic data,
which were distributed according to the observed sex and age group distribution of all other deaths.
The median interval between onset of symptoms and death in RENAVE data was 12 days
(interquartile range 7 to 19 days).
MoMo collects information on deaths from 3,945 municipal civil registries that cover 93% of the
Spanish population.12 Using a model described elsewhere,13 MoMo data are used to quantify excess
deaths for a particular period, taking into account the historical series of the last 10 years and
incorporating a secular trend and a seasonal component. Between March 1 and July 15, 44,459 excess
all-cause deaths were estimated (mainly concentrated between March 13 and May 22).12
Neither RENAVE nor MoMo distinguish between institutionalized and non-institutionalized
population. It was estimated that 9,909 deaths with confirmed COVID-19 and 19,681 deaths attributed
to suspected cases occurred in long-term care facilities, mainly nursing homes, during the same period
(supplementary table 1). We subtracted these deaths from those identified by RENAVE and MoMo,
respectively, in the population aged 60 years and older (see supplementary methods for details).

Estimation of infection fatality risks
The IFR is the number of deaths due to COVID-19 divided by the number of individuals with SARSCoV-2 infection. We obtained separate estimates of the overall IFR using the COVID-19 deaths from
RENAVE (lower bound of deaths, due to limited ascertainment in surveillance) and the excess allcause deaths from MoMo (a possible upper bound because of the inclusion of deaths that may not
result from direct or indirect effects of the epidemic). We then repeated the above analyses in each
stratum defined by sex and 10-year age group. We calculated 95% confidence intervals based on delta
methods that accounted for both the binomial variance in the number of deaths and the estimated
design-based variance in the number of infections (see supplementary methods for details). Analyses
were carried out using survey commands in Stata, version 16 and survey package in R, version 3.
RESULTS
According to the ENE-COVID study, the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence (95% confidence interval) was
4.9% (4.6% to 5.3%) during the first epidemic wave in Spain, which corresponded to 2.3 million (2.2
to 2.5 million) non-institutionalized individuals with antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (table 1).
Through July 15, 2020, 19,228 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 deaths and 24,778 excess all-cause
deaths were estimated to occur among individuals residing in Spain outside of nursing homes. The
distribution by age and sex was similar for both sources of death data: 64% of the COVID-19 deaths
and 62% of the excess deaths occurred among men; 79% of confirmed COVID-19 deaths and 83% of
excess deaths occurred among individuals aged 70 years or older.
Overall, the IFR estimate (95% confidence interval) was 0.83% (0.78% to 0.89%) for confirmed
COVID-19 deaths and 1.07% (1.00% to 1.15%) for excess deaths. The corresponding estimates were
1.11% (1.02% to 1.21%) and 1.40% (1.29% to 1.52%) for men, and 0.58% (0.53% to 0.62%) and
0.77% (0.71% to 0.84%) for women (table 1).
The IFR estimate varied greatly with age. It was under 1 per 1000 through age 49, with much lower
values in younger age groups (under 1 per 10,000 through age 29), and increased sharply in older age
groups (figure 1). Among men aged 80 years or older, the IFR estimate (95% confidence interval) was

11.6% (8.1% to 16.5%) for confirmed COVID-19 deaths and 16.4% (11.4% to 23.2%) for excess
deaths. Among women aged 80 years or older, the corresponding estimates were 4.6% (3.4% to 6.3%)
and 6.5% (4.7% to 8.8%).
In sensitivity analyses, the IFR estimates corrected for imperfect sensitivity and specificity were
slightly higher, with a corrected overall IFR of 0.88% (95% confidence interval 0.80% to 0.97%) for
confirmed COVID-19 deaths and 1.14% (1.03% to 1.25%) for excess deaths (supplementary table 2).
DISCUSSION
Principal findings
We estimated an IFR for SARS-CoV-2 between 0.83% and 1.07% in Spain through July 15, 2020.
The IFR was greater in men than in women and increased with age: 11.6% to 16.4% in men aged ≥80
years and 4.6% to 6.5% in women aged ≥80 years. Because incomplete ascertainment of deaths is
unavoidable during a large-scale epidemic, we obtained separate IFR estimates based on confirmed
COVID-19 deaths and excess all-cause deaths. The latter include mortality directly due to SARSCoV-2 infection and net mortality due to the societal impact of the epidemic and its control measures,
such as delayed care for emergencies14 and pre-existing chronic conditions due to medical care
reorganization and to patients’ reluctance to seek attention,15,16 and reductions in traffic injuries and
other accidents.17
The greater mortality in the elderly may result from a greater prevalence of comorbidities
(cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, lung and chronic kidney diseases) that are associated with
greater COVID-19 mortality,18 and immunological changes (including a decrease of CD8 T cells19)
that affect the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections.20,21 In addition to greater comorbidity and risk
factor prevalence (e.g., smoking), sex differences in cellular immunity may also explain the higher
mortality among men, who present a poorer T-cell activation and an increase in pro-inflammatory
cytokines.22 A negative correlation of T cell response with patients’ age has been reported in males but
not in female patients.22

Comparison with previous studies
As mentioned in the introduction, it is difficult to compare IFR estimates from studies using different
methods4. Case fatality rates –number of deaths divided by the number of confirmed cases- provide
different information, as they are heavily influenced by partial case ascertainment and not directly
comparable. There are interesting approaches based on modelling,5 but models heavily depend on their
own assumptions and are not exempt from bias4. Our overall IFR estimate is similar to that obtained
from serosurveys with low risk of bias4.
Our results suggest that some of the heterogeneity in published IFR estimates is driven by the different
sex and age structure of the population. Our crude IFR estimates, like others from countries with a
similar age-structure, such as Italy,9,23 are greater than those from countries with a younger
population.4 Variations in IFR values might also be related to the local dynamics of the epidemic (e.g.,
surge in number of new cases, diffusion of the virus among vulnerable collectives), combined with the
health system capacity to cope and treat a large number of cases.
Strengths and limitations
We used data from a nation-wide population-based seroepidemiological study and two complementary
sources of mortality information—deaths among laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and excess
deaths—to estimate the range of IFR, both overall and by age and sex. The ENE-COVID serosurvey
was timed to provide an IFR estimate for first wave of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Spain.11 The first
round of the study started one month after the peak, which took place around March 20, and the last
round ended on June 22. Thus, most participants would have been infected one month before their first
participation. As IgG antibodies are detected 2–3 weeks after symptom onset in more than 90% of
COVID-19 cases24 and decrease 2–3 months after infection,25 ENE-COVID is expected to cover
infections through at least the first week of June. To include potentially delayed COVID-19 deaths, we
considered all deaths registered through July 15 (see supplementary figure 2 for the time distribution
of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Spain). Also, the test selected to measure antibodies against SARSCoV-2 had high sensitivity and very high specificity, according to our meta-analysis (see

supplementary figure 1). We used its pooled estimates to calculate corrected ENE-COVID
seroprevalence figures; the resulting IFR estimates were slightly higher, but consistent with our
primary results (see supplementary methods), showing the robustness of our estimators.
A limitation of the study is that the RENAVE and MoMo surveillance systems did not differentiate
deaths from the institutionalized and non-institutionalized population. Hence, we had to collect deaths
with confirmed and suspected COVID-19 in nursing homes reported from different Spanish Regional
Authorities (supplementary table 1), disaggregate these deaths by sex and age group (as described in
supplementary methods), and subtract them from those identified by RENAVE and MoMo. In
addition, there is unavoidable uncertainty due to the use of different estimates, but our analyses have
incorporated this variability in confidence intervals of the final IFRs (see supplementary methods).
Because the ENE-COVID serosurvey was conducted among the non-institutionalized Spanish
population, our IFR estimates do not apply to people living in nursing homes in Spain (about 334,000
residents; 76% being aged 80 or older26), where more than 19,000 deaths occurred.27 Further research
is needed to characterize the mortality in long-term care facilities, which have clusters of vulnerable
populations in which the virus may spread very rapidly.28 As nursing homes had limited access to
hospital care during the initial outbreak in Spain,29 our IFR estimates cannot be transported to the
institutionalized elderly. Estimating the IFR for SARS-CoV-2 in long-term care facilities will require
its own specific approach.30,31
Conclusions
We estimated IFR estimates for SARS-CoV-2 by age and sex in one of the largest serosurveys in the
world carried out during the initial outbreak. Our overall IFR estimates (from 0.83% to 1.07%) are
about 10 times larger than those for seasonal32 or pandemic influenza33, in spite of the difficulty of
comparing two diseases with mortality figures obtained by different methods1. These IFR, considered
together with the transmissibility of the disease and the high proportion of susceptible population,
provide support for strong control measures.
