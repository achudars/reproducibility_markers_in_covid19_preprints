Abstract
Background
The pathogenesis of COVID-19, caused by a novel strain of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), involves
a complex host-virus interaction and is characterised by an exaggerated immune response, the
specific components of which are poorly understood. Here we report the outcome of a longitudinal
immune profiling study in hospitalised patients during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the
UK and show the relationship between immune responses and severity of the clinical
presentation.
Methods
The Coronavirus Immune Response and Clinical Outcomes (CIRCO) study was conducted at four
hospitals in Greater Manchester. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, recruited as close to
admission as possible, provided peripheral blood samples at enrolment and sequentially
thereafter. Fresh samples were assessed for immune cells and proteins in whole blood and
serum. Some samples were also stimulated for 3 hours with LPS and analysed for intracellular
proteins. Results were stratified based on patient-level data including severity of symptoms and
date of reported symptom onset.
Findings
Longitudinal analysis showed a very high neutrophil to T cell ratio and abnormal activation of
monocytes in the blood, which displayed high levels of the cell cycle marker, Ki67 and low COX2. These properties all reverted in patient with good outcome. Unexpectedly, multiple aspects of
inflammation were diminished as patients progressed in severity and time, even in ITU patients
not recovering.
Interpretation
This is the first detailed longitudinal analysis of COVID-19 patients of varying severity and
outcome, revealing common features and aspects that track with severity. Patients destined for
a severe outcome can be identified at admission when still displaying mild-moderate symptoms.
We provide clues concerning pathogenesis that should influence clinical trials and therapeutics.
Targeting pathways involved in neutrophil and monocyte release from the bone marrow should
be tested in patients with COVID-19.

Research in context
Evidence before this study
Analysis of the literature before the study via pubmed and bioRxiv searches using the terms
COVID-19, SARS-CoV2, immune and inflammation (with the last search performed on 27th April
2020) showed evidence of an overactive immune response in a handful of studies in crosssectional analyses all done at a single time point.
Added value of this study.
To determine the role of the immune response in a disease process, it is necessary to correlate
immune activity with clinical parameters dynamically. In this study patients presented to hospital
at different stages of disease so we took samples at different time-points to provide an accurate
picture of the relevant pathobiology. In order to avoid loss of large components of the immune
system due to the processes of storage, longitudinal samples were interrogated in real time to
reveal the full immune alterations in COVID-19.
Implications of all the available evidence.
Respiratory viruses continue to cause devastating global disease. The finding of altered
myelopoiesis, with excess neutrophils and altered monocyte function, as dominant features in our
study provides an incentive for clinical testing of therapeutics that specifically target this
pathobiology. Given that inflammation is greatest prior to admission to intensive care, trials of
specific immune-modulating therapies should be considered earlier in admission. Future studies
of COVID-19 mechanisms should place more emphasis on longitudinal analyses since disease
changes dramatically over time.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection results in the clinical
syndrome COVID-19 which, to date, has resulted in over 5 million confirmed cases and in excess
of 330,000 attributable deaths world-wide. A large number of clinical trials have been established
to evaluate anti-viral and immune modulatory strategies aimed at improving clinical outcome.
SARS-CoV-2 is a single stranded, positive sense RNA virus that enters cells via human
angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)1. Overlapping immune mechanisms exist to detect
every stage of viral replication. Pattern recognition receptors of the innate immune system
recognize viral antigen and virus-induced damage, increasing bone marrow hematopoiesis and
immune cell mobilisation. If inflammatory mediator release is not controlled in duration and
amplitude then “emergency hematopoiesis” leads to bystander tissue damage and the cytokine
storm syndrome manifesting as organ dysfunction. Initial studies suggest cytokine storm
syndrome occurs in COVID-192. Indeed, neutrophilia and lymphopenia (resulting in an increased
neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio), increased systemic interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein
correlate with incidence of ICU admission and mortality3.
The Coronavirus Immune Response and Clinical Outcomes (CIRCO) study was conducted at four
hospitals in Greater Manchester, UK. The aim was to identify demographic, clinical and
immunological factors associated with different immune phenotypes in response to SARS-Cov-2
infection in hospitalised patients. Single time point analysis of immunity (e.g at admission) usually
involves thousands of patients. However, we felt it was important to study the kinetics of the
immune response at depth in a longitudinal well-defined patient cohort. Understanding the specific
elements and kinetics of immune excess is critical to gain insight into immune phenotypes
associated with disease progression, identify potential biomarkers that predict clinical outcomes
and determine at which stage of the disease immune modulation may be effective2.

Methods
Cases: Between 29th March and 7th May, 2020, adults requiring hospital admission with
suspected COVID-19 were recruited from 4 hospitals in the Greater Manchester area. Informed
consent was obtained for each patient. Samples were collected at Manchester University
Foundation Trust (MFT), Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust (SRFT) and Pennine Acute NHS
Trust (PAT) under the framework of the Manchester Allergy, Respiratory and Thoracic Surgery
(ManARTS) Biobank (study no M2020-88) for MFT or the Northern Care Alliance Research
Collection (NCARC) tissue biobank (study no NCA-009) for SRFT and PAT. Ethical
approval obtained from the National Research Ethics Service (REC reference 15/NW/0409 for
ManARTS and 18/WA/0368 for NCARC). Clinical information was extracted from
written/electronic medical records including demographic data, presenting symptoms,
comorbidities, radiographic findings, vital signs, and laboratory data (differential white blood cell
count, CRP, kidney and liver function). Patients were included if they tested positive for SARSCoV-2
by
reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction
(RT-PCR)
on
nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs or sputum. Patients with negative nasopharyngeal RTPCR results were also included if there was a high clinical suspicion of COVID-19, the radiological
findings supported the diagnosis and there was no other explanation for symptoms. Patients were
excluded if an alternative diagnosis was reached, where indeterminate imaging findings were
combined with negative SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal (NP) test or there was another
confounding acute illness not directly related to COVID-19. The severity of disease was scored
each day, based on criteria for escalation of care (appendix 1). Patients were not stratified for
disease severity if there was no available clinical observation data or patients were recruited more
than 7 days after hospital admission. Where severity of disease changed during admission, the
highest disease severity score was selected for classification. The first available time point was
used for all cross-sectional comparisons between mild, moderate and severe disease. Peripheral
blood samples were collected as soon after admission as possible and at 1-2 day intervals
thereafter.
Healthy: Recruiting healthy individuals from the community for blood sampling during the SARSCoV-2 outbreak was not possible, and so we took three other approaches. The first was to sample
frontline workers from Manchester University and NHS Trusts with an age range that matched
our COVID-19 patients. Using this strategy peripheral blood samples were collected from 18
females and 9 males (age range 28-69). Secondly, we noted that most COVID-19 patients with
mild disease were indistinguishable from our control group, which lent support to the validity of
our comparisons. Finally, longitudinal analysis of patients with severe disease showed that they
returned to our control normal range on recovery.
Flow cytometry: White blood cells from lysed whole blood and peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMCs) separated by density gradient centrifugation were stained immediately on receipt
with five panels of 20 antibodies (see appendix 2 for antibody clones and manufacturers) and
immune cell profiles determined by flow cytometry. In order to assess the general immune
responsiveness of immune cells, PBMCs were also stimulated in vitro for 3 hours with 10 ng/ml
LPS in the presence of 10 ug/ml Brefeldin A to allow accumulation and analysis of intracellular
proteins by flow cytometry. Cells were cultured in RPMI containing 10% fetal calf serum, LGlutamine, Non-essential Amino Acids, HEPES and penicillin plus streptomycin (Gibco). Samples

were acquired on an LSRFortessa cell analyzer (Becton Dickinson) and analysed using FlowJo
(TreeStar).
LEGENDplex: At multiple stages post-admission, 13 different mediators associated with anti-viral
responses were measured in serum using LEGENDplex assays (BioLegend, San Diego, USA)
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Statistics: Results are presented as individual data points with medians. Groups were compared
using an unpaired Mann-Whitney test for healthy individuals versus COVID-19 patients, KruskalWallis test for multiple comparisons, or Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient test for correlation
of separate parameters within the COVID-19 patient group, using Prism 8 software (GraphPad).
Role of funding source: The Kennedy Trust for Rheumatology Research provided a Rapid
Response Award for costs associated with the laboratory analysis of the immune response in
COVID patients to JRG. The Wellcome Trust (TH, 202865/Z/16/Z), Wellcome Trust/Royal Society
(ERM, 206206/Z/17/Z) and BBSRC (JEK BB/M025977/1, TNS BB/S01103X/1) provided funds for
the laboratory analysis of the immune response in COVID patients. The Oxford and Manchester
NIHR BRC provided support for study design and sample collection.

Results
In total, 73 patients were recruited and 49 were stratified for disease severity. Six patients were
excluded due to an alternative diagnosis (2 patients), indeterminate imaging findings with negative
for SARS-CoV-2 NP test (2 patients) or a confounding acute illness was diagnosed (2 patients).
Two patients could not be stratified for disease severity due to insufficient clinical observation
data and a further 16 because recruitment occurred more than 7 days after admission. The
median time from symptom onset to hospital admission was 7 days (IQR - 4-10). The overall
median age was 61 (IQR 51-71) and 63% were male. The most frequent co-morbidities were
diabetes, ischaemic heart disease, hypertension, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (table 1). The majority (86%) of patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 via
nasopharyngeal RT-PCR. In 14% of patients, symptoms and radiographic features were highly
suggestive of COVID-19, but nasopharyngeal tested negative for the virus and thus a clinical
diagnosis was made. Complications occurred in 8 out of 49 patients and included pulmonary
embolism and acute kidney injury.
Patient disease severity was defined as mild (less than 28% FiO2), moderate (28-60% FiO2) or
severe (above 60% FiO2, or admission to intensive care) (appendix 1). All severe patients were
recruited from ward level care. Only 1 patient met the criteria for direct ICU admission. Out of the
10 severe patients, 7 were treated in intensive care, 4 were intubated and ventilated and 2 were
treated by CPAP alone (data not available for 1 patient). Three severe patients had ceilings of
care in place that specified ward level care due to frailty. Death occurred in 50% of severe cases
of COVID-19.
On hospital admission little difference was observed in total white blood cell counts, neutrophils
or lymphocytes (figure 1A). Although, as reported previously4, a higher neutrophil to lymphocyte
ratio (NLR) on hospital admission was observed in those patients whose disease trajectory was
ultimately severe, whereas there were no appreciable differences observed in monocytes (figure
1A, 1B and table 1). By only analysing differential white cell counts, important correlations may
be missed. We, therefore, performed multidimensional flow cytometry covering over 80 immune
markers across 5 panels on whole blood cells and separated PBMCs.
During a pandemic, it is impossible to recruit healthy individuals for blood sampling from the
community. As the data emerged, it became clear that the patients in the mild disease category
were indistinguishable in the majority of analyses from our frontline volunteers. Furthermore,
comparing the results across the different disease severities provided additional validation of our
control group that tracked most closely with the patients experiencing mild disease. Typically, all
parameters returned to within control levels on recovery, irrespective of disease severity.
Using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) we were able to visualise global
immune cell differences between COVID-19 patients and healthy individuals (figure 1C). Broadly,
this included alterations in the characteristics of neutrophils and monocytes and decreases in B
cells, T cells, basophils and NK cells in the initial recruitment blood sample, taken within 7 days
of hospital admission (figure 1D and appendix 3). These differences were exaggerated in patients

with severe disease. This global picture was confirmed by manual flow cytometric gating (figure
1D). In addition, the frequency of basophils in whole blood and plasmacytoid dendritic cells
(pDCs) within PBMCs were significantly decreased in patients compared to healthy individuals
(appendix 3A-B). Therefore, hospital differential count (on day of admission) and laboratory (on
day of recruitment to study) analysis of overall immune cell populations concur. Longitudinal
analysis revealed that in the majority of patients (70%) (irrespective of severity) T cell frequencies
in whole blood increased prior to hospital discharge, while neutrophil frequencies reciprocally
decreased (figure 1E). In two severe patients who did not recover, T cell frequencies were
extremely low and neutrophil frequencies high (figure 1E, white and pink squares). This suggests
that recovery is associated with a reduction of neutrophils and an increase in T cells.
Within the reduced T cell population there were no dramatic alterations in CD4+ or CD8+ T cell
frequencies, other than a slight decrease in CD4+ T cells in severe COVID-19 patients (figure 2A
and 2B). Both T cell subsets showed signs of activation in COVID-19 patients; however, this was
more striking in CD8+ T cells, did not track with disease severity, and was highly variable amongst
patients (appendix 4A-C). No differences were observed in the expression of the regulatory
molecule PD-1 (appendix 4D). Interestingly, in 34/43 COVID-19 patients higher perforin
expression was observed in CD8+ T cells compared to healthy individuals (appendix figure 4E),
implying these cells have activated a cytotoxic programme. Perforin expression in CD8+ T cells
did not significantly track with disease severity (figure 2C,D), although we did observe a
correlation with CRP (figure 2E). Therefore, only minor differences were observed in the CD8+ T
cell compartment.
The frequency of B cells was also reduced in COVID-19 patients with severe disease compared
to patients with mild and moderate disease (figure 2F). Although reduced, B cells displayed an
increased expression of Ki67 (indicative of activation), which positively correlated with CRP levels
(figure 2G). When examining B cell subsets no major differences in naive and switched memory
B cell subsets were observed in COVID-19 patients (appendix 5A and 5B). However, we observed
an expansion of antibody-secreting plasmablasts (CD27hiCD38hiCD24-) in COVID-19 patients,
which did not track with disease severity (figure 2H and appendix 5C). The only other population
of B cells raised in patients with severe COVID-19 compared to patients with mild and moderate
disease was a significant expansion of double negative (DN) B cells (CD27-IgD-) (figure 2I and
appendix 5A). DN B cells have previously been shown to exhibit an exhausted phenotype in
patients with HIV. This suggests that patients with severe COVID-19 may generate less effective
B cell responses.
By far the most significant changes were observed in monocytes. In mild COVID-19 there was an
expansion of the inflammatory CD14+CD16+ (intermediate) sub-population (appendix 6A), and
enhanced CD64, (high affinity Fc receptor for monomeric IgG (FcgRI)) on CD14+ classical
monocytes (figure 3A). Upon stimulation with LPS, monocytes from mild COVID-19 also displayed
increased intracellular TNF, which significantly correlated with CD64 (figure 3B, C) whilst IL-1b
levels were lower in monocytes from COVID-19 patients (appendix 6D). Severe COVID-19, on
the other hand, was associated with monocytes displaying increased expression of the cell cycle
marker, Ki67 (normally <5% in healthy peripheral blood), irrespective of whether monocytes were
stimulated or not (figure 3C and appendix 6C), which strongly correlated with hospital data for
CRP (figure 3C). We next examined cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in monocytes, which
9

is an enzyme involved in the production of prostaglandins. Remarkably, an early reduction of
COX-2 was evident in patients that went on to develop severe COVID-19 (figure 3D).
We next examined sequential samples per patient and plotted the results based on the time since
reported onset of symptoms. CD8+ T cells remained remarkably stable over the disease course
(appendix 7A and 7B). However, we noticed that in mild and moderate COVID-19 perforin
expressing CD8+ T cells increased with time, with the highest level immediately prior to discharge
(appendix 7C,D). This suggests development of functional CD8+ T cells is beneficial in COVID19. Reduced B cells was associated with a severe disease trajectory (notably in one of the
deceased patients) (appendix 7E), particularly the switched memory subset (appendix 7F).
Collectively, this suggests that low B cell responses associate with severe disease. This reduction
may be due to exhaustion that is supported by an expansion of double negative B cells in severe
patients (appendix 7G). The most striking trajectories that correlated with development of severe
COVID-19 were again in the monocyte population, where low COX-2 was present throughout
(figure 4A) and higher Ki67 was observed prior to ITU admission (figure 4B). TNF expression
following monocyte stimulation remained higher in patients with mild disease throughout the
disease course (figure 4C).
We next assessed soluble inflammatory mediators on admission to hospital and across the length
of hospital stay. Of the many mediators analysed in serum the ones significantly different between
patients and healthy controls were IL-6, IL-10, monocyte-chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and
interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10) (figure 4D and appendix 8). The increased levels of
these cytokines were specific to COVID-19 patients with severe disease, and strongly indicate a
role for myeloid cells in disease pathogenesis of COVID-19. Longitudinal analysis revealed that
the highest levels of inflammatory mediators occurred early in disease trajectory following hospital
admission, and critically, declined rapidly following admission to ITU despite no indications of
recovery (figure 4E and 4F).

Discussion
This detailed longitudinal analysis of COVID-19 patients of varying severity and outcome, the first
reported here, has revealed common immunological features and aspects that track with severity.
We provide information concerning pathogenesis that should influence clinical trials and
therapeutics. An aspect not expected included the presence of proliferating (Ki67+) monocytes in
the blood, with low COX-2 and high Fc receptor g (FcRI, CD64). These properties all reverted in
patients with good outcome. Also, not anticipated, was that multiple aspects of inflammation were
diminished as patients progressed in severity and time. Thus, production of IL-6, IP-10, MCP-1
typically reduced late in disease, even in patients who did not recover.
The cellular analysis indicates considerable abnormalities in the myeloid compartment, much
more so than the lymphopenia reported previously5. In the myeloid compartment, the profound
neutrophilia, which reduces as patients improve, suggests that neutrophils and their products may
contribute to the pathology. Activated neutrophils produce large quantities of S100A1 and A2,
HMGB1 and free radicals. Furthermore, neutrophils release fibrous scaffolds containing DNA,
histones, neutrophil elastase and myeloperoxidase that trap and kill pathogens, but also
contribute to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome6,7. To support their role,
elevated neutrophil products have been identified in the sera of COVID-19 patients that correlate
with clinical parameters such as C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and lactate dehydrogenase8.
The most unusual cell lineage in COVID-19 is the monocytes. In health, monocytes proliferate in
the bone marrow and do not proliferate in blood, and may do so again in tissues as they
differentiate9. Monocytes expressing proliferation markers in the blood have not previously been
reported in COVID-19 patients. In these patients, up to 80% of monocytes were expressing
proliferation marker Ki67, the highest consistently in patients with severe disease. The most likely
explanation for this phenomenon is premature release of monocytes from the marrow, due to
inflammatory signals. This has been previously reported in pandemic H1N1 influenza10,11.
Equally remarkable was the reduced expression of COX-2 in monocytes, from an early stage in
disease in patients with a severe disease trajectory. COX-2 facilitates the production of
prostanoids including prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and increases lipid mediators involved in
vasodilation, vascular permeability and immune cell chemotaxis12. It may also hinder the
production of anti-inflammatory/pro-resolution prostanoids, the resolvins13. Some viruses (e.g
avian H1N1 influenza the 2003 SARS coronavirus14 ) up-regulate the cyclo-oxygenase pathway
to regulate viral replication. However, its reduction in monocytes in severe lung viral infection has
not been reported previously. Reduced COX-2 alongside high IP-10, as seen here in severe
COVID-19 patients, is an immune profile strongly associated with pathology in idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)15. Therefore our data indicate a strong fibrotic signature in patients with
severe disease, supporting studies observing an unusual pattern of fibrosis in COVID-19.
The function of monocytes in COVID-19 was also assessed by cytokine immunostaining. It was
noteworthy that intracellular TNF was augmented in COVID-19 monocytes at hospital admission,
supporting the hypothesis that early anti-TNF should be tested in COVID-1916.

Our data concurs with several features of the disease in Wuhan, China, and is corroborated in
single cell RNA sequencing of bronchoalveolar lavage cells at a single time point17, but importantly
we extend this into a longitudinal analysis that gives greater insight. Similarities include elevated
CRP and IL-6 in patients at the time of hospitalization who eventually died18 and increased IP-10
(CXCL-10) in those who later developed severe disease19. IP-10 is an interferon-inducible
chemokine receptor that facilitates directed migration of many immune cells20 and is elevated in
other coronavirus infections including MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV21 and in Influenza virus of
swine origin (H1N1)22,23. The heightened levels of monocyte-chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1)
upon admission further indicate dysregulation of monocyte function and migration in patients with
severe disease. Importantly, IL-6, IP-10 and MCP-1 levels are highest around the time of hospital
admission, but are reduced rapidly as patients are admitted to ITU, which likely signifies
exhaustion of immune cells and the lineages producing them.
There are, of course, limitations to any study of samples during a viral pandemic for which there
is no vaccine. However, we believe that these do not reduce the importance of the messages
derived from our study. A longitudinal analysis in real time for phenotypic, functional and soluble
markers naturally limits the number of patients interrogated. In-depth analysis of smaller cohorts
however, is necessary to gain insight into mechanism and is of interest to the pharmaceutical
industry. In addition to the limitations of control subjects addressed above, the only other is that
patients may not accurately define the onset of symptoms. As data is plotted per patient, however,
this does not affect the interpretation of the results.
There are clinical implications of our data, as far as it has been analysed. Using non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) remains controversial24 and our study would suggest it is not
desirable, as it would compound the already low COX-225. Since most of the pathogenic
mechanisms involve myeloid cells, neutrophils and monocytes, it would be advantageous to
reduce their influx to the lung once lung pathology is established. Relevant strategies include
inhibition of the complement anaphylatoxin C5a26 or IL-8 (CXCL8), which are strong
chemoattractants for many immune cells, including neutrophils27. Antagonism of CXCR2 that
mobilises neutrophil and monocyte from the bone marrow, neutrophil elastase inhibitors and
inhibition of G-CSF, IL-23 and IL-17 that promote neutrophil survival, are also options28. Anti-IL-6
and anti-TNF agents are already being investigated for COVID-19 treatment and are relevant to
neutrophils, which express the requisite cytokine receptors. Furthermore, JAK inhibitors are
currently in clinical trials and may also reduce neutrophil levels29. Targeting toxic products of
neutrophils such as S100A1/A2, HMGB1 and free radicals30, but also the formation of NETS could
be beneficial30.
Finally, one of the clearest messages is that treating patients early after hospitalization is likely to
be most beneficial - cytokines and cell levels are high and there is the potential for recovery. There
are also potential predictors of severity which could stratify patients for treatment at admission,
including high neutrophil/Tcell ratio, high Ki67 and low COX2 in monocytes.
