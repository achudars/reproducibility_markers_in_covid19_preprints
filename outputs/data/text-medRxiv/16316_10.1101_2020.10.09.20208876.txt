Abstract
School-age children play a key role in the spread of airborne viruses like influenza due to the
prolonged and close contacts they have in school settings. As a result, school closures and other nonpharmaceutical interventions were recommended as the first line of defense in response to the novel
coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19). Assessing school reopening scenarios is a priority for states,
administrators, parents, and children in order to balance educational disparities and negative population
impacts of COVID-19. To address this challenge, we used an agent-based model that simulates
communities across the United States including daycares, primary, and secondary schools to quantify
the relative health outcomes of reopening schools. We explored different reopening scenarios
including remote learning, in-person school, and several hybrid options that stratify the student
population into cohorts (also referred to as split cohort) in order to reduce exposure and disease spread.
In addition, we assessed the combined impact of reduced in-person attendance in workplaces (e.g.,
through differing degrees of reliance on telework and/or temporary workplace closings) and school
reopening scenarios to quantify the potential impact of additional transmission pathways contributing
to COVID-19 spread. Scenarios where split cohorts of students return to school in non-overlapping
formats resulted in significant decreases in the clinical attack rate (i.e., the percentage of symptomatic

individuals), potentially by as much as 75% . These split cohort scenarios have impacts which are only
modestly lesser than the most impactful 100% distance learning scenario. Split cohort scenarios can
also significantly avert the number of cases–approximately 60M and 28M–depending on the scenario,
at the national scale over the simulated eight-month period. We found the results of our simulations to
be highly dependent on the number of workplaces assumed to be open for in-person business, as well
as the initial level of COVID-19 incidence within the simulated community. Our results show that
reducing the number of students attending school leads to better health outcomes, and the split cohort
option enables part-time in-classroom education while substantially reducing risk. The results of this
study can support decisions regarding optimal school reopening strategies that at the population level
balance education and the negative health outcomes of COVID-19.

1. Introduction
The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was first identified in Wuhan, China in late
December 2019 [3] and subsequently spread worldwide. By March 11, 2020, when the World Health
Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic, there were already close to 120,000
confirmed cases and more than 4,300 deaths worldwide [4]. As of October 8, 2020, there are now over
36 million confirmed cases and over a million deaths worldwide, with over 7.8 million confirmed
cases and over 217,000 deaths in the U.S. [5]. The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through small
droplets and aerosols of saliva or discharge from the nose of an infected person [6]. At this time, there
are no specific vaccines or large-scale treatments for COVID-19 [6], demonstrating the urgent need for
non-pharmaceutical approaches that could reduce its spread.
Public officials have recommended a range of individual- and community-level nonpharmaceutical interventions to slow the spread of COVID-19 and mitigate the impact on people,
communities, and healthcare infrastructure [7]. Individual measures include personal protective
actions, such as applying proper cough etiquette in daily life, hand hygiene, wearing face coverings/
masks, staying home when sick (also called isolation), or staying home after an exposure to a
confirmed case or after residing in/arriving from a community with known widespread transmission
(also called quarantine). Community measures may include temporary school closures/dismissals and
other social distancing measures such as stay-at-home recommendations, canceling mass gatherings,
and minimizing face-to-face contact at workplaces.
As the cases of COVID-19 started to emerge during the early spring of 2020 in the U.S., most
of the primary and secondary schools closed for the remainder of the 2019-2020 school year [8]. There
has been a significant debate about school closures and reopenings because of the existing educational
disparities that have been exacerbated by the pandemic, social isolation, and other unintended
consequences such as access to free and subsidized lunches at school. However, there is anecdotal
evidence that reopening schools, for the traditional academic year in autumn 2020, in areas
experiencing widespread community transmission provide additional transmission pathways between
communities that were otherwise mostly isolated. For example, the Cherokee County School District
in Georgia reported 108 confirmed cases of COVID-19 within two weeks of schools reopening, and 3
out of the 6 high schools in the district reverted to full remote leaning by the third week [9, 10]. In
Mississippi, 71 of the 82 counties reported positive COVID-19 cases within few weeks of schools
reopening [11]. Similarly, in Tennessee, over 2,000 children tested positive for COVID-19 within two
weeks of schools reopening [12].
Mathematical and computational models of COVID-19 spread provide a platform to examine
which modalities of in-person instruction may be feasible during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
Several recent studies have begun to quantify the impact of various non-pharmaceutical interventions
in combination with different school reopening strategies and have found that reopening schools as
normal is likely to increase the number of COVID-19 cases [13, 14]. Other studies have found that
closing schools and incorporating social distancing measures in classrooms are effective in reducing

the spread of COVID-19 [15]. In addition, hybrid approaches to learning, such as capping the inperson classroom size, may be effective in reducing transmission [14,16] and provide a balance
approach between supporting education while limiting the spread of COVID-19.
An additional challenge of simulating the impacts of COVID-19 within a community is also
simulating workplace restrictions, which may reduce transmission pathways within the community.
We address this gap by combining non-pharmaceutical interventions, school reopening scenarios, and
workplace restrictions into an agent-based model, EpiCast, to assess the potential feedbacks on the
spread of COVID-19. Using parameters provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) to simulate COVID-19 transmission within the U.S., we explored several reopening scenarios
including remote learning, in-person school, and several hybrid options that stratify the student
population into cohorts in order to reduce exposure and disease spread. The results of this study can
support decisions regarding optimal school reopening strategies that balance education and the
negative health outcomes of COVID-19.

2. Methods
Model Description
We used an agent-based model, known as Epidemiological Forecasting (EpiCast), originally designed
to simulate community-level influenza transmission in the U.S. at the national-scale and adapted it to
simulate COVID-19 [17]. The primary modifications for COVID-19 relate to the disease natural
history (as described later) since the transmission mechanisms for COVID-19 are similar to that for
influenza. The national-scale simulation model consists of 281 million individuals distributed among
65,334 census tracts to closely represent the actual population distribution according to the 2000 U.S.
Census data [17]. Each tract is organized into 2,000-person communities resulting in 180,492 model
communities. The model combines U.S. Census demographics and worker-flow data to generate
daytime and evening contact networks based on potential contacts emerging at daycares, schools,
workplaces, households, neighborhoods (~500 people), and communities (e.g., mall, supermarket)
[17]. In each census tract, the synthetic population matches the actual population in several statistical
measures including the number of residents and households, the household’s age distribution, the
household size and membership distribution, and employment status for working adults. In addition,
each workplace is assigned a 3-digit NAICS (North American Industrial Classification System) code
based on the proportion of workers in each sector in each county. We used a regional model (~8.6
million people in the Chicago Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA)) to explore additional scenarios
(given the extensive computational nature of the national model) in order to determine the impact of
different assumptions on COVID-19 spread and mitigation strategies.
A new feature of EpiCast, for the purpose of this study, is the ability to capture interactions
between teachers and students while in school settings. In previous EpiCast simulation models [17,18],
school mixing groups accounted only for transmission between students; teachers and staff were not
explicitly included. For the present study, we associate a workplace with NAICS Subsector Code 611

(Educational Services) with each school, and account for mixing between the teachers, staff, and
school children. Where necessary, we add additional workplace(s) in a community to achieve an
average 14:1 student:(teacher/staff) ratio in each school, based on recent statistics from the National
Center for Education Statistics [19]. This is necessary because our community model assumes that
elementary and secondary school children attend school in the tract/community in which they reside,
not accounting for bussing across Census tract boundaries which the actual employment statistics
reflect. Transmission between children in a school mixing group, and between teachers/staff in a
workplace mixing group, are unchanged from the original model. For the added mixing, from students
to teachers/staff and vice versa, we assume that the individual child-adult contacts are twice the childchild contact rates. Our results were not overly sensitive to this assumption, and we note that the
numbers of child-child transmissions are still greater than child-adult transmission due to the much
larger number of children in a school. For example, if there are approximately 14 times more children
than adults in a school, and approximately two times greater transmission between an individual child
and individual adult, the child-child transmission will be about seven times greater than child-adult
transmission.
Epidemiological Parameter Assumptions
In order to simulate COVID-19 transmission within a community, we used parameter assumptions and
model-produced epidemiological data from the CDC’s Pandemic Planning Scenarios [20] (Table 1).
The disease natural history for COVID-19 was assumed to be as follows: the distribution of latent
infection is 1-7 days, the incubation period is 1-8 days, and infectious period is 3-9 days. Furthermore,
the proportion of infections which remain asymptomatic are assumed to be 40% and the relative
infectiousness of asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic individuals is assumed to be 75%. Self-isolation of
symptomatic individuals is assumed to be similar to those used for pandemic influenza studies [21].
Assumptions regarding ideal reduction in contacts due to social distancing, facemasks, and hygiene is
shown in Table 2. The “reduced” social distancing scenarios assume a 50% reduction in compliance of
preschool and elementary school-age children to account for limited facemask or social distancing
measures. Finally, long distance travel is assumed to be reduced due to travel and quarantine
restrictions implemented across the nation (Table 2). Each county was initialized and calibrated to
match the cumulative case counts during the first two weeks of August 2020 as reported by the New
York Times COVID-19 repository [22]. Note that we do not report the number of cases during the
calibration phase and thus assume that the simulation starts on August 15, 2020.

Assumptions regarding full time, part-time, the number of individuals teleworking, and employees laid
off as a result of the current COVID-19 situation are shown in Table 2. Some of these percentages
were chosen based on discussions with subject matter experts from the State of New Mexico.
Furthermore, the percentage of individuals teleworking are based on two surveys of the labor market
near the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)
[23]. The ability to telework for each 3-digit NAICS sector also comes from the BLS survey and is
shown in Table 3. The model assumptions on working in the workplace versus working from home or
being laid off were based on the values in both Table 2 and Table 3.

The information from BLS is by 3-digit NAICS sector (and is used in the model at the 3-digit level) but is shown as 2-digit
for brevity as most 3-digit levels share the same value as those in the rolled-up 2-digit NAICS category.

Workplace Modeling Assumptions
Per the phase guidelines released in Opening Up America Again [24], we modeled two scenarios:
“Fewer Open Workplaces,” similar to Phase 2 of Opening Up America Again, and “More Open
Workplaces”, similar to Phase 3. These two scenarios describe different levels of in-person workplace
assumptions (Figure 1, Tables 2-3). Specifically, Fewer Open Workplaces encourages telework
whenever possible and feasible with business operations as well as limited onsite operations for a small
set of businesses. More Open Workplaces assumes staffing of additional worksites with an expanded
number of onsite workers. An example is a retail business may be open to 25% customer capacity as
per Phase 2 recommendations and the NAICS industry percentage of employees working onsite is 50%
(in order to accommodate the workers necessary for the operation of the business) for Fewer Open
Workplaces. For More Open Workplaces, this business may have the opportunity to have a 50%
customer capacity and the percentage of employees needed would increase to 75%. For a comparison
across intervention approaches, we also use a Pre-pandemic Behavior scenario, which assumes that all
businesses are open with no capacity or social distancing restrictions.

School Scenarios
We explored the impact of various school reopening scenarios as described in Table 4. These scenarios
range from 100% distance learning to 100% onsite learning (Baseline), as well as partial onsite
learning with alternating days or weeks. We also explored 80% in-person enrollment due to recent
surveys, which suggest that at least 20% of parents may not send their children back to school [25]. For
the regional model, we assume that the 2020-2021 school year for the Chicago Public Schools begins
on September 8th, 2020. The national scale model assumes a different start date for the 2020-2021
school year ranging from August 3rd, 2020 (Arizona) to September 16th, 2020 (New York) based on
publicly available information from school districts.

3. Results
Overall Regional and National Impacts
The impacts of school reopening for the Chicago MSA region are summarized in Figure 2 and Tables
A-1 and A-2 in the Appendix. Figure 2 shows the epidemic curves for nine school reopening scenarios
under Fewer Open Workplaces and More Open Workplaces for the Chicago MSA region aggregated
over the simulated eight-month period (15 August 2020 through 11 April 2021). Figure 3 shows the
national simulation results of six scenarios under Fewer Open Workplaces and More Open Workplaces
for the nation. The results show similar trends for the Baseline, 80% in-person learning, 40% 2-day
and alternating week, and offsite school scenarios with Fewer Open Workplaces and More Open
Workplaces assumptions for both regional and national simulations.
All the partial onsite learning scenarios delay the epidemic peak and flatten the curve for Fewer
Open Workplaces, which is consistent with previous studies on school closures [13-16] (Figure 2, 3).
However, for More Open Workplaces, the peak for most scenarios is spread around three weeks
regardless of school reopening scenario and the impact of hybrid school reopenings is reduced.
Additionally, the reduced social distancing scenario (analyzed only the Chicago MSA region), which
accounts for limited compliance in facemask usage and social distancing measures for children in K-8
(i.e., kindergarten through grade 8th), has a slight but significant decrease in the clinical attack rate
(CAR) (i.e., the percentage of symptomatic individuals) over the simulated eight-month period. That
is, for the Fewer Open Workplaces scenario, the CAR is reduced from 26.3% for the 80% less social
distancing scenario to 23.8% for the ideal social distancing scenario. Similarly, the CAR is reduced for
the 40% 2-day split cohort scenario from 8.8% to 5.8% for the Fewer Open Workplaces scenarios
depending on the ideal or reduced social distancing assumptions, respectively. These results show that
reducing the number of students attending in-person education as well as splitting the student
population into cohorts, can reduce the potential negative impacts of COVID-19 spread.

The results show heterogeneity in the impacts across the U.S. Figures 4-5 show cumulative
cases per 100K population at the county level for EpiCast simulated results for the 40% split cohort
scenario attending 2 days a week and the 80% onsite school scenario. Note that the cumulative number
of cases include both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals aggregated over eight-months.

Tables 5-6 show key results from the model aggregated for the nation. Table 5 shows the total
number of cases, deaths, and hospitalizations for each scenario for the full eight-month simulation
period and for the four weeks around the peak of the epidemic. Table 6 shows the peak incidence and
prevalence as well as the time to peak and the total CAR for each scenario. Note that the cumulative
number of cases includes both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals as simulated by EpiCast.
Similar impacts as the Chicago MSA model (see Appendix) are observed at the national level but the
overall attack rate is lower for all scenarios. Specifically, the scenarios with the lowest attack rate
include the 100% offsite, 40% 2-day and alternating weeks school scenarios (i.e., Fewer Open
Workplaces: 4.1%, 5.6%, and 6.1%, respectively). As noted earlier, the impacts of COVID-19 spread
is lower for the Fewer Open Workplaces compared to the More Open Workplaces for all scenarios.

Source of Infection
Identifying the source of infection can help develop targeted mitigations to reduce the potential spread
of viruses. Figure 6 shows the source of infection for all the national-level scenarios for Fewer Open
and More Open Workplaces for all contact settings within the simulation. Our results show that the
majority of cases are generated at home, followed by neighborhood/community settings. The
percentage of infection generated in schools and workplaces is correlated with the level of
schools/workplaces open. Note that additional infections generated at workplaces are captured under
neighborhood/community due to the fact that EpiCast does not explicitly account for customer
interactions with workers at workplaces/workgroups. Workgroups only account for infections
generated from employee to employee. Figure 7 shows the aggregated source of infection for daycares,
playgroups, and schools for all the national-level scenarios for Fewer Open and More Open
Workplaces. Note that the majority of school-related infections are generated from student-student
interactions due to the prolonged close contacts in these settings. This finding supports strategies that
reduce the number of students attending in-person education.

Figure 6. Source of infection for each of the national-level scenarios for Fewer Open and More

neighborhood/community settings, 15% at schools, and 10% at workplaces.

Cases, Deaths, & Hospitalizations Averted
Non-pharmaceutical interventions are effective in averting the potential cases, deaths, and
hospitalizations that would have otherwise resulted without the implementations of these public health
strategies. We estimated the number of cases, deaths, and hospitalizations that may be averted by
comparing each of the mitigation scenarios against the Baseline scenario. Figure 8 shows the cases
averted and delay to peak incidence for Fewer Open and More Open Workplaces for all the nationallevel scenarios. The results show that alternating school cohort scenarios can significantly avert the
total number of cases by approximately 60M and 28M for the Fewer Open Workplaces and More Open
Workplaces, respectively. The results are consistent with previous studies [18, 26-28] that have shown
that non-pharmaceutical interventions can delay the peak of an outbreak (i.e., flatten the curve) and
reduce the total number of cases over the same time frame. Furthermore, the offsite scenario provides
the largest benefit by averting the greatest number of cases followed by the 40% scenarios. Notably,
the 100% distance learning scenario averts nearly 5 million more cases and results in almost twice as
long time-to-peak interval compared to the split cohort scenarios. These results demonstrate the
positive impacts of non-pharmaceutical interventions in reducing disease burden and flattening the
curve to allow for healthcare services not to be overwhelmed. Figure 9 shows deaths and
hospitalizations averted for Fewer Open and More Open Workplaces for all the national-level
scenarios. The results show a significant reduction in deaths and hospitalizations for the 40% 2day/alternating week and offsite scenarios under Fewer Open Workplaces assumptions. Specifically,

Impacts by Age
We have observed significant variation in the distribution of cases, hospitalization, and deaths by age
throughout the pandemic. Notably, during the early stages of the pandemic, older adults were most
affected but the age distribution has changed as the pandemic has progressed [29].Given the
demographic granularity of EpiCast, we stratified the total cases, hospitalizations, and ICU beds by age

group for all national-level scenarios for Fewer Open Workplaces (Figure 10) and More Open
Workplaces (see Appendix and Supplemental Files SF1-SF3). Our results show that the highest
number of cases for most scenarios is generated by the 5-18 school-aged group followed by the 30-64
age group. However, adults 30-64 years old make up the largest number of hospitalizations and ICU
bed usage for all scenarios. It is worth noting that the age distribution of cases for our simulated
scenarios looks different than current COVID-19 age distribution for the nation [30]. While the
majority of the cases currently reported were during periods when schools were closed and many
children were in isolation, we suspect that as schools open and more children are exposed, the case
rates for younger populations may increase. Additionally, there may be other factors contributing to
these discrepancies including underreporting due to asymptomatic infections, lack of widespread
testing [31], initial parameter estimates, and contact patterns assumptions. Specifically, recent evidence
suggests that children are more likely to be asymptomatic [32-34] resulting in biased estimates for this
population; however, states that have implemented widespread testing, have reported different age
distributions [35]. In addition, the initial planning scenarios and subsequent age breakdowns [20]
reflected the hospitalization and case fatality age distributions, not the case distribution of infections,
which were closer to the relative population of each age group. Finally, our simulated results used
contact patterns based on historical estimates for influenza studies due to lack of contact patterns
needed to parameterize our model. However, as more evidence becomes available, we will update our
assumptions in order to better assess the impacts of COVID-19 by age.

State-level Comparisons
Spatial heterogeneity has been evident during the COVID-19 pandemic due to local demographics and
public health orders implemented across the states. We selected 12 representative states (at least one
state per U.S. Department of Health & Human Services Regions) in order to show the spatial
differentiation for all the scenarios. Figures 11-12 show normalized epidemic time series and peak day
comparisons for 12 states for the baseline and offsite scenarios (additional figures are included in the
Appendix). For the baseline with Fewer Open Workplaces, the peak date ranges from October 21st,
2020 (California) to December 10th, 2020 (Maine). The peak is dependent on the current transmission
levels for each of these states (i.e., states with higher transmission peak first and states with lower
transmission peak later). Note that the offsite scenarios result in flat epidemic curves.

Figure 13 shows epidemic time series and peak day comparisons for 12 states for the 40% 2-day split
cohort scenario for both Fewer Open Workplaces and More Open Workplaces. As mentioned earlier,
these intervention strategies flatten the curve subsequently delaying the peak. However, the benefits of
the cohort scenarios are reduced when more workplaces are open, increasing the transmission paths for
the entire population. We note great variability in the impacts and dynamics across the 12 states,
especially for the More Open Workplaces scenarios.

4. Discussion and Conclusions
Non-pharmaceutical interventions such as school closures and social distancing have been
implemented globally to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Given the start of the new school year,
there is a need to assess how to best resume school activities while reducing the risk of increased
transmission. We used an agent-based simulation to assess the impact of several school reopening
scenarios in combination with community level transmission that accounts for workplace in-person
restrictions.
Our results suggest that reducing the number of students by 20% (consistent with the
percentage of parents who will likely keep children out of school during the school year 2020/21 [25])
reduces the CAR by at least 5% compared to the ~100% enrolment, which would be expected in prepandemic period. Scenarios where split cohorts of 40% of students return to school in non-overlapping
formats may result in more significant decreases in the CAR, potentially by as much as 75%. The split
cohort scenarios have impacts which are modestly lesser than the 100% offsite or distance learning
scenario. However, the 100% distance learning scenario averts nearly 5 million more cases and results
in almost twice as long time-to-peak interval compared to the split cohort scenario. Alternating school
cohort scenarios can also significantly avert the total number of cases by approximately 60M and 28M
for the Fewer Open Workplaces and More Open Workplaces, respectively. These split cohort scenarios
assume appropriate non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing and wearing facemasks
at school. Our results indicate that implementing smaller classroom sizes and cohorts of students with
breaks between in-person school attendance (e.g., two days on, three days off) can have a major

impact on the spread of COVID-19 both in terms of total cases and timing of the peak of a given
outbreak wave.
Increasing the number of in-person workplaces (i.e., from Fewer Open to More Open
Workplaces) increases the overall CAR for all scenarios. For the alternating school cohort scenarios,
there is a nearly five-fold increase in the CAR when moving from Fewer Open to More Open
Workplaces. Implementing both maximum work-from-home and cohorts in school along with social
distancing measures will reduce transmission, hospitalizations, and deaths. We observe significant
heterogeneity within the U.S. due to the starting initial conditions of current cases, local demographic
drivers (i.e., age distribution), and the number and type of workplaces. Areas with high incidence at the
beginning of the simulation have worse outcomes and, generally, earlier peaks. This could mean that
timing school reopening to coincide with locally lower incidence rates is important. Allowing 100% of
students to return back to school is likely to lead to additional increases of infection under the current
transmission dynamics in the U.S. and if schools reopen at the 80% or 100% level, school-age children
could generate the largest number of cases. All scenarios where schools open even at the 80% levels
will result in greater COVID-19 case rates requiring higher levels of hospitalizations, ICU beds, and
ventilators needed across the U.S. However, implementing cohorts and smaller class sizes result in
fewer cases and deaths, while providing important educational opportunities for children. Combining
these with social distancing measures including mask wearing, meeting outside, and keeping distanced
from others results in many fewer cases.
Our findings should be considered in context of several potential limitations. First, the model
assumed the same level of workplace restrictions (namely Fewer Open Workplaces and More Open
Workplaces) uniformly across all the states in the United States in order to compare the different
scenarios under similar conditions. However, there is evidence that each state has implemented
different public health actions resulting in drastically distinct operating statuses for businesses that
have reopened [36]. Therefore, incorporating the heterogeneity in state actions may be necessary in
order to better quantify the impact of school reopening scenarios on COVID-19 spread. Second, we did
not consider testing and contact tracing explicitly in the simulation. Although we assume isolation of
symptomatic individuals promptly after symptom onset, we know that effective contact tracing and
testing, in combination with hybrid school reopening scenarios and social distancing measures, will be
critical for safely reopening schools. Third, we projected epidemic trajectories through the beginning
of April 2021 in order to assess the potential impact of school reopening scenarios during the autumn
and winter months. However, several studies [37] have shown that behavioral responses to an epidemic
or pandemic are highly dependent on the perception of the severity of the disease. Thus, we expect the
behavior and compliance to change and fluctuate in the next six months as a result of new public health
orders and disease perception; however, we do not have adequate data to predict this, and therefore
assume that the same level of restriction and compliance to non-pharmaceutical interventions will
remain in place. Fourth, the population distribution in EpiCast is based upon the 2000 U.S. Census
data, to take advantage of the tract-to-tract work flow data that was last compiled then. This is a major
limitation for areas that have seen significant population changes in the last two decades, therefore, the

simulation may be conservative in terms of the potential contacts and spread of COVID-19. Finally,
the epidemiological parameters have spatial and temporal variability during the course of the COVID19 pandemic. Therefore, additional studies are needed in order to quantify the impact of changing
these assumptions on the epidemic projections.
While there is uncertainty in our epidemic projections, our results are consistent with
previously published studies [18, 26-28] and are intended to serve as guideposts for deliberations
regarding the potential relative impact of different school reopening scenarios in the U.S.

Appendix –Figures & Tables
Tables A-1 and A-2 show the key results from the modeling for the Chicago MSA region. Table A-1
shows the total number of cases, deaths, and hospitalizations for each scenario for the full simulation
period and for the four weeks around the peak of the epidemic. Table A-2 shows the cumulative and
peak incidence (and prevalence) as well as the time to peak and the total CAR for each scenario. It is
worth noting that both the 2-day and alternating week school scenarios lead to similar CARs in spite of
differences in the reduced social distancing assumptions. For Fewer Open Workplaces, ideal social
distancing results in a CAR of 5.8% and 6.5%, respectively for the 2-day and alt-week scenarios, rising
to 8.8% and 9.7%, respectively with less social distancing. More Open Workplaces results in
significantly higher CAR of 29.2% and 29.7%, respectively with ideal social distancing, and 29.7%
and 30.3%, respectively with less social distancing. Likewise, peak timing is spread out significantly
under Fewer Open Workplaces due to the impact of these partial reopening scenarios in flattening the
curve.
