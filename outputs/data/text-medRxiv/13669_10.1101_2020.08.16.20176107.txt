ABSTRACT
Frontline healthcare workers (HCW) are a high-risk population for SARS-CoV-2
infection. Here we present results from a large serosurveillance study of 10,019
asymptomatic HCW conducted during April-May 2020, in eight hospital medical centers
across the state of Oregon, USA during the initial peak of the pandemic. Free and
voluntary testing was performed at 14 +/- 3 day intervals, over a 4-week window at each
site, utilizing a lab-developed ELISA based on the Epitope Diagnostics COVID-19
nucleocapsid IgG detection Kit. We identified 253 SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositive
individuals among 10,019 total participants, representing a cross-sectional
seroprevalence of 2.53%. Subgroup analysis identified differential seropositivity by job
role, ranging from 8.03% among housekeepers, odds ratio 3.17 (95% CI 1.59-5.71), to
0.00% among anesthesiologists, odds ratio 0.00 (95% CI 0-0.26), both of which were
significant. Over the course of the study, 17 seroconversions (0.25%) and 101
seroreversions (1.50%) were identified. Self-reported SARS-CoV-2 swab qPCR testing,
when compared with subsequent serology on study, showed only modest agreement, ùõã
= 0.47 (95% CI 0.32-0.62). Overall, these findings demonstrate relatively low
seroprevalence and very low seroconversion rates among HCW in Oregon, USA, over a
period in which aggressive social distancing measures were in place. The high rate of
seroreversion observed in this cohort, and the relatively high discordance between

SARS-CoV-2 serology and swab qPCR, highlight limitations of current detection
methods, and stress the need for development of novel assessment methodologies to
more accurately identify exposure (and/or immunity) to SARS-CoV-2 in this population.

INTRODUCTION
The original outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, caused by SARS-CoV-2, a novel
strain of betacoronavirus that is capable of person-to-person spread, has rapidly become
a global pandemic1. The crisis has been hallmarked by high transmission rates leading
to a rapid increase in critically ill patients that continue to overwhelm intensive care units
in multiple communities throughout the world2. To combat the spread of the virus,
governments have taken steps such as travel restrictions, mandatory utilization of
personal protective equipment (PPE), sheltering in place and quarantines3. Healthcare
workers (HCWs) providing direct care for COVID-19 patients are at a significant risk of
infection and have accounted for a significant proportion of COVID19 cases4‚Äì6. HCWs at
Providence St. Joseph Health (PSJH), a large integrated not-for-profit health care
system operating in seven US states, have been at the forefront of the crisis since the
first reported U.S. COVID-19 patient was admitted to Providence Regional Medical
Center Everett in January 20207. ‚ÄúSerosurvey‚Äù efforts, aimed at determining overall
exposure and seroconversion rates in a population, provide a tool to identify exposure
associated risk factors and can guide the rational utilization in a health care setting of
personal protective equipment (PPE), in addition to return to work policies and providing
psychological support to health care workers who are at risk of secondary mental health
issues due to overwork and fear of contagion8. Although serological studies have been
extensively used to determine local epidemic dynamics and population infection fatality
rates, significant gaps persist in the current understanding of the humoral responses to
SARS-CoV-2 in individuals with asymptomatic infections, with recent evidence
suggesting that asymptomatic individuals may have a weaker humoral immune response
to SARS-CoV-2 infection and an early reduction in antibody levels9‚Äì13.

Under an IRB approved protocol (PSJH IRB2020000221, entitled: SARS-CoV-2
Serosurveillance Protocol for PSJH Health Care Workers), between April 8 and May 22,
SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid IgG antibody serosurveillance was offered to asymptomatic
HCW at 8 Oregon USA Providence medical centers, (Fig. 1). Testing was free and
voluntary, with confidential results notification, and was offered to all HCW with direct
patient contact, contact with patient biospecimens or patient linens. Testing was
performed every 14 +/- 3 days over a four week interval at each site. The opening of
each site was slightly staggered, with initial activation in the two largest Portland, Oregon
city hospitals. Specific dates of testing are provided in Table 1. Test results were
accessed by participants via an auto-generated e-mail link to an intranet hosted secure
web application used to display results and dynamically updated institutional guidelines.
Participants were asked to provide basic demographic information including age,
gender, job role (one only), workplace setting (up to three, e.g. x-ray tech in ER, ICU and
wards), previous swab PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2, and if so, whether positive (dates
not queried). Results reporting was confidential and not shared with the employer or unit
managers. Residual sera were cryopreserved for additional analyses. A dedicated
study e-mail inbox for participant questions was continuously staffed and received
roughly 2,700 queries over the course of the study, indicative of HCW
uncertainty/anxiety levels in April 2020.
The SARS-CoV-2 serology assay used in the initial phase of this study was a lab
developed test based on the Epitope Diagnostics Coronavirus (COVID-19 IgG ELISA
Kit: (http://www.epitopediagnostics.com/covid-19-elisa). This assay utilizes a microplatebased enzyme immunoassay technique. Assay controls and 1:100 diluted human serum
samples were added to the microtiter wells of a microplate that was coated with SARSCoV-2 recombinant full length nucleocapsid protein. After the first incubation period, the
unbound protein matrix was removed with a subsequent washing step. A horseradish
peroxidase (HRP) labeled polyclonal goat anti-human IgG tracer antibody was added to
each well. After an incubation period, an immunocomplex of SARS-CoV-2 recombinant
antigen ‚Äì human anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody - HRP labeled antihuman IgG tracer
antibody is formed if there is specific coronavirus IgG antibody present in the tested
specimen. The unbound tracer antibody was removed by the subsequent washing step.
HRP tracer antibody bound to the well is then incubated with a substrate solution in a
timed reaction and then measured in a spectrophotometric microplate reader. The
enzymatic activity of the tracer antibody bound to the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG on the wall

of the microtiter well is proportional to the amount of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody
level in the tested specimen. Qualitative results and optical densities (OD) values
reported by the instrument were used in the analysis. The assay used in the initial phase
of this study was validated by the ELISA vendor in a cohort of 84 patients from Jiaxing
City Center for Disease Control and Prevention and Zhejiang University Hospital, with a
reported sensitivity and specificity of 100%. Subsequently, the assay was internally
validated as a laboratory developed test using a second cohort of 91 patients, collected
at Providence Portland Medical Center, and including RT-PCR confirmed positive
hospitalized patients and in sera collected in 2019 before the SARS-CoV-2 initial
outbreak. In this cohort, the sensitivity was 80%, the specificity 100%, which is in line
with another recent external performance evaluation14. Possible limitations of this assay
include cross-reactivity due to past or present infection with non-SARS-CoV-2
coronavirus strains. Sensitivity and specificity have not been established in the setting of
asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Odds ratios and two-sided CIs for seropositivity risk by sex, age (<50 / 50+), role,
hospital, and workplace were determined via logistic regressions comparing each group
against all others in that category (e.g., physicians versus all other job roles combined)
with age and sex as covariates. Cohen's kappa with two-sided asymptotic CIs and
positive and negative percent agreement were used to assess concordance between
swab qPCR and serological results15‚Äì17. No data were imputed. Analyses were
performed in R version 3.6.2, release 2019-12-12 (see supplemental for code)18.

RESULTS
The pace of HCW voluntary enrollment was brisk, with a single-day maximum of 1,293
phlebotomies performed. In total, 10,019 asymptomatic HCW took part in the study, with
blood draws every 14 +/- 3 days over a four week interval (up to three blood draws), at
eight hospital medical centers across the state of Oregon, USA. Participants were
75.74% female (7,588/10,019), with a median age of 42 years (range 18 to 82).
The overall 4-week cross-sectional seroprevalence was 2.53% (+253/10,019). Detailed
testing results are presented in Table 1, including the specific range of testing dates at
each hospital medical center. Figure 1 presents serosurveillance relative to aggregate

daily COVID-19 hospital census at the participating Oregon medical centers (for
breakdown by individual hospital site, see supplemental Figure S1).
As shown in Figure 2, we observed significantly increased seropositivity among HCW
age 50 and above, with odds ratio of 1.51 (95% CI 1.17-1.94). We also observed
geographic variation in HCW seroprevalence based on urban versus non-urban regions,
ranging from 3.04% in the Portland, Oregon metropolitan area, to 1.36% in non-urban
medical centers, which correlated with the overall geographic distribution of COVID-19
cases in the state during the same period.
As shown in Figure 3, subgroup analysis by HCW job role identified significant
differential seroprevalence. Housekeepers were at the most significantly increased risk
of seropositivity, with 8.03% seroprevalence (+11/137) and an odds ratio of 3.17 (95% CI
1.59-5.71); whereas, anesthesiologists were at the most significantly decreased risk of
seropositivity, with 0.00% seroprevalence (0/110) and an odds ratio of 0.00 (95% CI 00.26). Subgroup analysis by workplace setting, however, did not identify significant
differential seroprevalence, as shown in Figure 4. For a complete listing of subgroup
classifiers and results, see supplemental Tables S1 and S2.
Longitudinal serosurveillance over the course of the study, as shown in Table 2,
identified 17 seroconversion events, (0.25%; 17 of 6,717), and 101 seroreversion events
(1.50%; 101 of 6,717). As shown in Table 3, prior qPCR-based SARS-CoV-2 swab
testing results were self-reported by 1,048 study participants: of 1,021 negative qPCR
swab tests reported, 995 were also negative by serology (97.45% negative agreement);
while, of 27 positive qPCR swab tests, 17 were also positive by serology (62.96%
positive agreement); ùõã = 0.47 (95% CI 0.32-0.62).

DISCUSSION
On Wednesday, April 1, 2020, Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus
coordinator, issued a call to action to academia to develop tests quickly for health care
worker serosurveillance. ‚ÄúWe have the most brilliant scientists in the world in our
universities in state after state. Our universities can do that by Friday. So I‚Äôm putting that

challenge out to them to really work on that and do that. . . they could screen the entire
hospital.‚Äù19 Hence, the Providence Oregon HCW serosurveillance effort was
operationalized in one week (April 1 to 8, 2020), from study conception to protocol
writing, to IRB approval, to administrative review, to secure intranet architecture build for
results notification, to staffing at scale, to logistics, to on-site training, to first blood draw.
At the time, little data existed as to asymptomatic seroprevalence among HCW or other
groups. Preliminary data from two population serosurveys were reported in the press.
In San Miguel County, Colorado USA, a program to offer county residents free and
voluntary antibody testing was launched in Telluride on March 24th 2020, and as of early
April, a 0.5% cross-sectional seroprevalence emerged (+8 of 1,631)20,21. Also in early
April, researchers from the University Hospital in Bonn, Germany released preliminary
findings of a serosurvey in Gangelt, the epicenter of a point outbreak during Karneval
celebrations a month earlier, showing 14% seroprevalence and a 2% rate of residual
active infection by tandem swab qPCR.22,23
Results are presented here from a SARS-CoV-2 serosurveillance study in a cohort of
10,019 asymptomatic health care workers (HCW) in Oregon, USA, as part of a larger
serology screening effort that is being extended to approximately 100,000 caregivers
employed by a large integrated not-for-profit health care system spanning seven western
states (Providence St. Joseph Health, PSJH). Serosurveillance over a 4-week time
period in April-May 2020, during the peak of initial COVID-19 hospital case load, was
free & voluntary with available blood draws and confidential delivery of results to
participants every 14 +/- 3 days. The first site was activated on April 8th 2020 at a large
urban Portland medical center, followed by a staggered roll-out to seven additional PSJH
hospital centers across the state of Oregon, with closure of the final site on May 22nd
2020. Antibody screening was performed via a lab developed test ELISA based on the
Epitope Diagnostics Coronavirus COVID-19 IgG nucleocapsid detection Kit14. Overall,
we identified 253 SARS-COV2 IgG seropositive individuals, representing a crosssectional seroprevalence of 2.53% for asymptomatic HCWs, in the 10,019 participant
Providence Oregon cohort.
Given the low seroprevalence levels we observed, it is notable that significant
differences among subgroups emerged nonetheless. Seropositivity was most
significantly increased among housekeeping staff (odds radio 3.17; 95% CI 1.59-5.71)

and in general for asymptomatic HCW age 50 and above (odds ratio 1.51, 95% CI 1.171.94); whereas, to our surprise, seropositivity was most significantly decreased among
anesthesiologists (odds ratio 0.00; 95% CI 0.00-0.26). The identification of
anesthesiologists as the occupational subgroup with the most reduced risk of
seropositivity in this large multi-hospital cohort was unexpected, given specific
occupational exposure risks inherent to this specialty, and likely attests to the strong
regimes of prevention and protection instituted in the work environment. However,
equally noteworthy is the identification of housekeeping staff at the opposite pole of riskextreme, particularly, as this finding directly parallels the recent HCW data reported by
Shields et al. at University Hospital Birmingham, UK24. While raising the possibility of
differential occupational exposure, these findings may also represent the effect of
underlying socioeconomic disparities among HCW subgroups.
Longitudinal serosurveillance over a four-week window, identified 17 seroconversion
events (0.25%) across the eight participating hospital sites, with a substantially higher
rate of 101 seroreversion events (1.50%). The very low level of seroconversion
suggests that rigorous enforcement of PPE and of statewide aggressive social
distancing measures may have been major determinants in minimizing SARS-CoV-2
infection rates among HCW. On the other hand, the relatively higher rates of
seroreversion, may be in line with recent reports of COVID-19 antibody titers declining
rapidly to non-detectable levels following mild or asymptomatic disease9‚Äì12. We also
observed relatively poor positive agreement (63%) between serology and self-reported
positive swab qPCR; whereas, negative agreement between serology and self-reported
negative swab qPCR was relatively high (97%). Although exact dates of prior qPCR
swab testing were not captured, this finding is also likely supported by recent reports of
antibody titer decline9‚Äì12, notwithstanding the fact that we assessed only SARS-CoV-2
nucleocapsid IgG, and the possibility that other SARS-CoV-2 antigens may ultimately be
shown to be more reliable and long-lasting serologic targets.
Overall, our findings indicate relatively low seroprevalence and very low seroconversion
rates among HCW during the initial surge of COVID-19 hospital case load in Oregon,
USA, a period in which aggressive social distancing measures were in place. The high
seroreversion rate and the relatively high discordances between SARS-CoV2 serology
and swab qPCR assessment (ùõã = 0.47; 95% CI 0.32-0.62), also highlight limitations of

current detection methods and stress the need for development of novel assessment
methodologies. Use of residual sera is permitted in the study for further immunologic
analyses, such as orthogonal serologic assay methods. It remains unclear whether the
humoral antibody response is fully protective, or whether cellular immunity may be
playing a larger role in the clearance of SARS-CoV-213,25,26. In the event of future SARSCoV-2 seasonal cycling, this protocol allows for reactivation without formal re-review in
order to enable timely data capture on re-emergent pandemic/endemic conditions.

Figure 3. Job Role Subgroup Analysis, Odds Ratios (95% CI)

Physician = all specialties aside from surgeon or anesthesiologist; NP, PA = nurse practitioner,
physician assistant; Ancillary = all therapists, technicians, researchers and phlebotomists; Social
Work includes case managers and chaplaincy; Facilities includes security, engineering,
information systems/technology. See supplemental data for complete breakdown.

Figure 4. Workplace Subgroup Analysis, Odds Ratios (95% CI)

Participants were allowed to designate up to three workplace settings of potential exposure,
but only one job role (e.g. role = portable X-ray tech; workplace = ICU, ER, Inpatient Wards). OR
classifier includes operating rooms, recovery units and all interventional procedure suites (e.g.
endoscopy, bronchoscopy, interventional radiology, etc . . ). L&D classifier includes labor &
delivery, fetal-maternal, and neonatal intensive care.
