Abstract

35

We investigated the presence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-

36

CoV-2) RNA at different treatment stages of 15 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in two

37

North Indian states of Rajasthan and Uttarakhand. Untreated (influent), biologically treated, and

38

disinfected wastewater samples were collected from May to August 2020. The qualitative

39

analysis of the wastewater for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was done using different pre-

40

processing methods. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 11 out of 39 wastewater samples in

41

Jaipur district and 5 out of 17 wastewater samples in Haridwar District using Reverse-

42

Transcriptase Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) for qualitative detection.

43

None of the 56 samples tested for post-secondary or tertiary treatment were found positive for

44

SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The findings indicate that there are no SARS-CoV-2 related risks involved

45

with using the treated effluent for non-potable applications. In contrast, untreated wastewater

46

may be a potential route of viral transmission to the WWTP and sanitation workers. Future

47

studies are imperative to understand the survival rates of these viruses in wastewater.

1. Introduction

51

The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome

52

Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged as a worldwide public health emergency within few

53

months of its outbreak in Wuhan, China. Its spread is confirmed in more than 213

54

countries/regions worldwide (worldometers.info). COVID-19 is highly contagious and spreads

55

through different routes, like air droplets, and physical contact. Hence, early detection and rapid

56

containment protocols are crucial for its control and elimination.Especially for developing

57

countries, many of whom are densely populated and lack robust public health infrastructure.

58

Relying on clinical testing alone for detection and control is insufficient due to the scale of the

59

spread and many asymptomatic and pauci-asymptomatic cases. Wastewater based epidemiology

60

(WBE) or wastewater surveillance can be a useful tool for community-wide detection as both

61

viable SARS-CoV-2, and viral RNA are shed in bodily excreta, including saliva, sputum, and

62

feces, subsequently disposed of in wastewater.

63

WBE implies the extraction, detection, analysis and interpretation of the biomarkers from the

64

wastewater (generally obtained from a limited geographic area) (Sims and Hordern, 2020). It has

65

been successfully used to predict disease outbreak previously, like, the spread of wild poliovirus

66

type-1 (WPV-1) in Egypt and Palestine (WHO, 2013). Similarly, SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments

67

were found in wastewater in Brazil (Fongaro et al., 2020), Italy (La Rosa et al., 2020), the

68

Netherlands (Medema et al., 2020) and Spain (Randazzo et al. (2020) before the first clinically

69

confirmed cases there.Various other studies detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater across

70

the globe (Ahmed et al., 2020; La Rosa et al., 2020; Lodder and Husman, 2020; Medema et al.,

71

2020; Rimoldi et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020; Wurtzer et al., 2020), and wastewater surveillance

72

has been suggested as a non-invasive early-warning tool for monitoring the status and trend of

73

COVID-19 infection and for tuning public health response (Daughton, 2020; Mallapaty, 2020;

74

Naddeo and Liu, 2020). Combinations of clinical and environmental surveillance methods have

75

proven to be useful for planning, implementing and evaluating public health practices (Kroiss et

76

al., 2018). However, current evidence indicates the need for a better understanding of the role of

77

wastewater as potential sources of epidemiological data and as a factor of public health risk. A

78

recent study suggests that SARS-CoV-2 can be infective in aerosols for up to 16 hours (Fears et

5

79

al., 2020), thus implying possible human health risk due to wastewater aerosolization, especially

80

among sanitation workers. Thus, it is imperative to investigate the presence of viral RNA in both

81

untreated and treated wastewater. Further, there are apprehensions about implementing WBE in

82

developing countries due to poor water supply network and sewerage system. While

83

infrastructure development is quintessential and a long-drawn process, sufficient good quality

84

data on WBE from these regions can be useful for future planning and computational modeling.

85

Most studies on WBE for SARS-CoV-2 are reported from developed countries. Therefore,

86

this study tries to bridge the crucial information gap regarding WBE in a developing region,

87

specifically India. The objective of this study is to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments in both

88

untreated and treated wastewater samples collected from multiple locations. Experiments were

89

carried out to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in influent, secondary treated and tertiary

90

treated effluent samples from 15 wastewater treatment systems of four cities (Roorkee,

91

Rishikesh, Haridwar, Jaipur) of two North Indian states of Uttarakhand and Rajasthan, and to

92

possibly decipher the potential of current biological treatment systems for removal of the virus.

93

The samples from multiple locations make the study more representative and indicate the

94

potential application of WBE across diverse climatic conditions. This study will add to the

95

existing literature on WBE and contribute to an efficient and resilient public health emergency

96

response mechanism for the future.

100

Wastewater samples (grab) were collected during nine different time points from seven

101

wastewater treatment facilities of Jaipur city (Rajasthan). Grab, and composite samples were

102

collected during three different time points from eight wastewater treatment facilities at

103

Uttarakhand state (Rishikesh, Haridwar, Roorkee). The sampling was carried out during the

104

months of May to August 2020. Untreated wastewater (n= 23 and 9), secondary treated effluent

105

(n= 5 and 2) and tertiary treated effluent (n= 9 and 6) were collected from Rajasthan and

106

Uttarakhand states, respectively. The locations of the WWTPs are highlighted in Figure 1 and

107

summarized in Table 1. During sampling, proper precaution and safety measures like using

108

standard personal protection equipment (PPE), were followed. Samples were collected in clean

109

pre-sterilized bottles and transported to Dr. B. Lal Clinical Laboratory, Jaipur for pre-processing

110

and RNA extraction.

111

2.2. Sample pre-processing

112

The samples were pre-processed using two different methods specified in Figure 2. In method A,

113

a 50 ml sample was transferred into sterile falcon tubes in Biosafety Cabinet (BSL-II) followed

114

by surface sterilization of the falcons using 70% ethanol and exposure to UV light for 30

115

minutes. The heat inactivation of the virus was then done by placing the falcon tubes in a water

116

bath at 60

117

vacuum filter assembly. The filtrate was then transferred to a fresh falcon containing 4g PEG and

118

0.9g NaCl. The content was dissolved through manual mixing followed by centrifugation at 4

119

for 30mins at 7,000 rpm. The pellet obtained was then resuspended in 1X Phosphate Buffer

120

Saline (PBS).

℃ for 90 mins. The samples were further filtered through a 0.45μm membrane using a

121

Method B used for the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was performed by the transfer of a

122

1ml sample in a 1.7ml centrifuge tube followed by centrifugation at 7,000 rpm for 15mins. The

123

supernatant was collected in a fresh tube and was again centrifuged at 7,000 rpm for 15mins. The

124

supernatant thus obtained was used for nucleic acid extraction. Since both methods A and B

125

showed similar patterns of detection of SARS-CoV-2 genes for early time points of the

126

collection time window (Arora et al., 2020); all further samples from July 2020 onwards were

127

pre-processed following method B.

128

2.3. Nucleic acid extraction

129

The viral RNA molecules present in the wastewater samples from May to early July 2020 were

130

131

132

isolated using a Biospin kit (Cat# BSC77M1). As per the vendor’s instructions, 10 μl proteinase
K and 200

μl of lysis buffer were added to 200μl of sample into a 1.5 ml centrifuge tube

followed by vortex mixing and incubation at 56 oC for 15 minutes in a heating block. 250 μl of

133

ethanol was then added to the sample and mixed by vortexing for 15 secs. The mixture was then

134

transferred to the spin column and centrifuged at 10,000 g followed by sequential washing with

135

the three wash buffers provided in the kit followed by centrifugation at 10,000g for 1 min at each

136

washing step. After complete drying of the spin column, the RNA was eluted out using a 50-

137

100μl elution buffer. centrifugation was done at 12,000 g for 1 minute. The RNA from samples

138

collected in late July to August has been extracted using the automated KingFisher Flex

139

SystemTM. (Cat#5400610).

141

For the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the wastewater samples, RT-PCR was performed

142

using FDA approved Allplex™ 2019-nCoV Assay kit (Cat# RP10244Y, 208 RP10243X) as per

143

protocol standardized in the laboratory (Arora et al., 2020). Recently published Real Time-PCR

144

assays were used as the basis for the detection of SARS- Co-V-2 in wastewater samples (Ahmed et

145

al., 2020; Corman et al., 2020). RT-PCR assays were performed using two of the ICMR approved

146

kits for standardizing detection of viral genome in wastewater samples. The two kits used were

147

FDA approved Allplex™ 2019-nCoV Assay kit (cat# RP10244Y, RP10243X) and TaqPath™

148

COVID-19 Combo Kit (Cat#A47814) for the qualitative detection of SAR-CoV-2 genomic RNA in

149

the sample on Applied Biosystems™ QuantStudio™ 5. Once the protocol was established and the

150

two kits performed without any noticeable difference in efficiency, further samples were all tested

151

by AllplexTM kit. The protocol for the same is as follows: the mastermix was prepared using the kit

152

content which was composed of Amplification and detection reagent, enzyme mix for one-time RT-

153

PCR, buffer containing dNTPs, buffer for one-step PCR and RNase free water. Each PCR tube

154

155

contained 8 μl RNA sample, 5μl 2019-nCoV MOM, 5 μl Real-time One-step buffer and 2μl Realtime One-step enzyme and the final volume of the mixture was adjusted to 25μl using RNase free

156

water. A list of different fluorophores used for the detection run is given in Table 2. Thermal

157

cycling reactions were performed at 50 oC for 20 minutes, 95 oC for 15 minutes, 44 cycles at 94 oC

158

for 15 seconds, and 45 cycles at 58 oC for 30 seconds, in a thermal cycler. For each run, a set of

159

positive and negative controls were included.

179

May 2020. In Uttarakhand, the sampling was started in July 2020. The early sampling in

180

Rajasthan coincided with the duration of community restrictions and lockdown and followed the

181

gradual relaxation in the same (Arora et al. 2020). The sampling was carried out until August

182

2020, when most establishments, including offices, barbershops, markets, malls, were opened,

183

and unrestricted city movements were allowed. In Uttarakhand, sampling was conducted under

184

partial lockdown conditions, with offices closed and restricted activities permitted in some areas.

185

The observations from RT-qPCR based qualitative genome detection showed that the spread of

186

COVID-19 in North India is highly extensive, and partial lockdowns had no apparent difference

187

in the viral genome load. The Ct values of all three genes ( E, RdRp, and N) were found to be in

188

the range of 30-38 (Table 2), which corresponds to a mild to moderate genome load presence

189

inall the wastewater samples. In Jaipur, the Ct values indicate an increase in the genome load of

190

about 10 to 103 fold after the restrictions were lifted. The Ct values in wastewater samples

191

collected from Uttarakhand indicate genome loads within the same orders of the loads present in

192

Jaipur during June 2020. It was the time when restrictions were being lifted partially in the cities.

193

The increase in the viral genome load concurs with the gradual rise in the number of infected

194

individuals, which have risen from 2138 and 720 active cases on first June to 10,260 and 5912

195

active cases by the end of August 2020 in Jaipur and Haridwar districts respectively (number of

196

cases for Jaipur district obtained from the newspaper, the case numbers for Haridwar as reported

197

by the Department of Medical Health and Family Welfare (https://health.uk.gov.in/)). During the

198

qualitative detection, the presence of gene E was frequently detected with the lowest of Ct values

199

as compared to the other two genes (Genes N and RdRP) (Table 2). In Uttarakhand, the Ct of E

200

gene in four samples out of five positive samples was the lowest compared to those of N and

201

RdRP genes in the same samples. In Jaipur, all the five-times sampling in August 2020 (overall

202

10 out of 12 samples), showing positive results for the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 genome,

203

had the lowest Ct values for the E gene. Interestingly, for the samples collected initially from

204

Jaipur, Ct values of E and N indicated that the genome loads were still within a difference of 10

205

times maximum. In contrast, the sample collected later into the time window clearly showed 100

206

to 1000 times lower genome load reflecting in the Ct values for the E gene than N. Several

207

studies have investigated the role of these viral genes. It has been known that these genes are

208

involved in different steps of viral assembly. Vennemal et al demonstrated that E protein along

209

with M protein alone is independently capable to assemble into viral capsid without requiring

210

any interactions with N or RdRp genes. Self-assembly of SARS-CoV-2 requires interaction of

211

the N gene with viral RNA for compaction and packaging into the viral capsid (Ye et al., 2020).

212

Thus, the observed Ct value trends might be interesting and may indicate towards shedding of

213

viral capsids before the packaging is complete. Alternatively, it could indicate the differential

214

expression rates of these genes in host under different conditions, like, genetic makeup of a

215

community, geographical, climatic, etc. These dynamics in E, N, and RdRP gene detection,

216

therefore might prove useful to understand the viral host interactions and transmission

217

probabilities through wastewater.

218

A few studies have also tried to correlate the Ct values with genome load and the

219

probability of that load to be infective. Lab level studies were conducted by investigating the

220

percentage of the cell cultures turning positive at various Ct levels of the SARS-CoV-2 genome

221

detected in the clinical samples of sputum and nasal swabs. The study shows that a sample with

222

genome load with Ct values greater or equal to 34 could not infect the cell lines tested and thus

223

postulates that the patients with higher or equal to 34 Ct values may be discharged out (La Scola

224

3.2. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in effluent samples corresponds to the role of the

231

biological wastewater treatment process

232

The presence of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in untreated wastewater is a cause of concern as the

233

wastewater is a potential route of viral transmission to the sanitation workers. Additionally,

234

aerosolization of wastewater during its treatment can promote infection via air provided the viral

235

particle is active. The sludge and treated water from these treatment facilities are used for

236

agricultural purposes, which can put end users’ health at risk. To investigate the probability of

237

such a transmission route, treated wastewater samples from all the sampling sites were collected

238

and checked for the presence of viral RNA.

239

The samples were collected from both secondary and tertiary treatment stages of

240

wastewater treatment plants. Interestingly, detectable and intact SARS-CoV-2 viral genome was

241

not observed in any treated wastewater samples (Table 3). The sampling was conducted during

242

the lockdown and after lifting of the lockdown regulations. While there is a constant increase in

243

the number of COVID-19 cases, and by extension, the SARS-CoV-2 genome load per sample

244

unit, treated samples were negative for the viral genome presence. It indicates that the

245

wastewater treatment facilities were capable of degrading the viral RNA significantly. The

246

biological treatment stages were capable of removing the intact SARS-CoV-2 genome beyond

247

the detection sensitivity and did not solely depend on the tertiary treatment (i.e., disinfection

248

stage). Direct chlorination of untreated sewage might not show any significant reduction in the

249

detected viral loads if the chlorine demand of the sample is not satisfied. Chlorine demand is

250

directly proportional to the organic waste matter present in the water samples (Rudolf and

251

Ziemba, 1983). Since there is a very large quantity of organic matter in the sewage; it is

252

understandable if chlorination alone is not highly effective. Evidently, Zhang et al. (2020) found

253

an unexpected occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in the septic tank even after disinfection

254

with sodium hypochlorite. They suggested reevaluation of the existing disinfection approach

255

(free chlorine: > 6.5 mg/L after 1.5-hour contact). Thus, highlighting the significant role played

256

by biological treatment systems.

261

4. Discussion

262

This study highlights the effect of an increase in the viral genome load per unit of wastewater. In

263

the post lockdown period (August 2020), the rapid increase in the numbers of COVID-19

264

patients were corroborated by the decrease in Ct values. Additionally, the genes tested for SARS-

265

CoV-2 in the wastewater showed different gene load levels, as indicated by the Ct values. The E

266

gene seems to be present more abundantly than N and RdRP in the samples. This observation

267

can be explained by either of two reasons. One reason could be the host-pathogen interaction

268

which is different for different populations; thus it is possible that a particular gene is more

269

abundantly or stably expressed in a community. Another reason could be that the E gene is

270

responsible for the structural assembly of the viral particles without interacting with N and RdRp

271

genes (Vennemal et al., 1996) and thus could be simply overexpressed as compared to other

272

SARS-CoV-2 genes in affected individuals leading to shedding of assembled capsids without

273

packaged RNA genome

274

Throughout the sampling period, the SARS-CoV-2 genome could not be detected in the

275

secondary or tertiary treated samples. However, few studies reported a low probability of viral

19

276

detection until the tertiary treatment is carried out (Randazzo et al., 2020). The difference in

277

observations could be explained by multiple factors, e.g., the physical factors (temperature, pH),

278

and chemical factors, present as the constituents of the wastewater (i.e., constitutents of

279

wastewater may affect the stability of viral genes.)or the microbiome involved in the biological

280

treatment process itself. The absence of any detectable viral genome in wastewater samples

281

collected post-secondary treatment might indicate the efficacy of the biofilm generated by the

282

microflora in the biological reactors in removing the viral genome loads. This hypothesis is

283

based on several studies that have reported the role of biofilms in the removal of various types of

284

viruses(Quignon et al., 1997; Esfahani et al., 2020). A biofilm can be defined as a well-organized

285

community consisting of cooperating microorganisms immobilized in an extracellular

286

polysaccharide (EPS) matrix (Mortensen, 2014; Maurya, and Raj, 2020). Biofilms can be an

287

association of a single, or multiple species of bacteria, fungi, algae, protozoans, and rotifers in

288

combinations (Maurya and Raj, 2020). These unique combinations allow the matrix to

289

effectively trap and assist in removing the viral particles present in raw wastewater flowing

290

through it. Further studies investigating the composition of the biofilms present in the secondary

291

treatment systems might provide a deep insight into the structures and composition of biofilms,

292

which are specifically effective in SARS-CoV-2 removal.

293

294

5. Conclusions

295

Following conclusions can be put forward from this study:

296

•

Ct values corresponding to mild-moderate levels of viral genome loads were observed

297

and direct effects of physical distancing and lockdown regulations on the Ct values could

298

be seen.

299

•

Further,

differences in the presence of genes were observed; Ct values of gene E

300

indicated its abundance compared to the N or RdRP gene in the samples collected post

301

lockdown.

302

•

Biological treatment plants might be appropriate to perform with high efficiency in

303

SARS-CoV-2 removal, diminishing any possibility of the fecal route of disease

304

transmission through treated wastewater.

305

•

It also assessed the efficacy of biological treatment followed by tertiary treatment

306

(disinfection) to avoid contamination from treated urban wastewater, and establish a

307

surveillance system through sewage monitoring of the potential virus circulation.

308

309

•

This study provides a new direction to understand the survival of these viruses in natural
conditions, at different temperatures, and in various wastewater types.
