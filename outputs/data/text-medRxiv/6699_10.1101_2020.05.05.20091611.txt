Abstract
The recent emergence of a previously unknown coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), first confirmed in the

34

city of Wuhan in China in December 2019, has caused serious public health and economic issues
due to its rapid dissemination worldwide. Although 61,888 confirmed cases had been reported in

36

Brazil by 28 April 2020, little was known about the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in the country. To better
understand the recent epidemic in the second most populous state in southeast Brazil (Minas Gerais,

38

MG), we looked at existing epidemiological data from 3 states and sequenced 40 complete genomes
from MG cases using Nanopore. We found evidence of multiple independent introductions from

40

outside MG, both from genome analyses and the overly dispersed distribution of reported cases and
deaths. Epidemiological estimates of the reproductive number using different data sources and

42

theoretical assumptions all suggest a reduction in transmission potential since the first reported case,
but potential for sustained transmission in the near future. The estimated date of introduction in

44

Brazil was consistent with epidemiological data from the first case of a returning-traveler from
Lombardy, Italy. These findings highlight the unique reality of MG’s epidemic and reinforce the

46

need for real-time and continued genomic surveillance strategies as a way of understanding and
therefore preparing against the epidemic spread of emerging viral pathogens.

Introduction
The World Health Organization (WHO) office in China was informed about a cluster of new

58

cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology in the City of Wuhan (Hubei province), in late December
2019 [1]. Shortly afterwards, a new type of coronavirus, now termed SARS-CoV-2, was isolated

60

and identified by Chinese authorities, with its genetic sequence shared with the international
community on 10 January 2020 [2–5]. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2 was

62

similar to other (pandemic) betacoronaviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [4,5];

64

revealing also its phylogenetic relationship to other coronaviruses isolated from bats and Malayan
pangolins (Manis javanica), indicating a likely zoonotic origin [2,5–7].

66

To date, more than 3.5 million cases of the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, termed COVID-19,
have been reported around the world [8,9]. On 11 March 2020, the WHO declared the COVID-19 a

68

pandemic, prompting a dramatic increase in international concern and response [10]. On 26
February 2020, the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported in São Paulo (SP) state, Brazil

70

[11]. Two months later (28 April 2020), 61,888 cases and 4,205 deaths attributed to COVID-19 had
been reported in Brazil [12]. Meanwhile, preliminary phylogenetic analysis using the first two

72

SARS-CoV-2 complete genomes isolated in São Paulo from travelers returning from Italy, revealed
two independent introductions into the country, relative to the analyzed dataset available at that time

74

[13].
The state of Minas Gerais (MG) is the second largest Brazilian state in terms of population size,

76

estimated at approximately 21 million people, and is located near the state of São Paulo [14]. Due to
its large population size and its well-connected and active neighboring states such as São Paulo and

78

Rio de Janeiro, the state of MG is likely to be highly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Genetic analyses and surveillance allow the characterization of circulating viral lineages, the

80

inference of introduction events and the reconstruction of transmission patterns [15]. Together with

epidemiological data, they are powerful tools to assist public health initiatives and preparedness. In
82

this study, we present a summary of epidemiological data and the generation and analysis of 40 new
SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences isolated from clinical samples of confirmed cases from MG, with

84

the aim of providing a preliminary epidemiological overview of the circulation and introduction
events of the virus in that state.

86

Results/Discussion
88

After the WHO declared the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 a Public Health Emergency of International
Concern (PHEIC) on 30 January 2020, the Brazilian government declared a Public Health

90

Emergency of National Importance on 3 February 2020, enabling the introduction of measures to
prevent and control spread [16]. Twenty-three days later, the first confirmed case in Brazil was

92

reported in the city of São Paulo, related to a traveler returning from Lombardy, Italy (Fig 1) [11].
By the 28 April 2020, more than 61,888 COVID-19 cases were confirmed in Brazil, 1,578 of which

94

were from MG (Fig 2A) [17]. Over this period, MG registered 71 COVID-19-related deaths, and
the capital city Belo Horizonte, with an estimated population of 2.5 million people, had reported

96

555 cases [17,18]. Fig 2A shows MG's epidemic (reported cases) curve compared to the curves of
two other neighboring states, São Paulo (SP) and Rio de Janeiro (RJ).

98

Without access to the total number of tests in time and in each state, we calculated the case fatality
ratio (CFR) for MG, SP and RJ as the crude ratio between reported deaths and cases [19]. The CFR

100

was found to increase with time in all states (S2 Fig), with means from date of first reported case up
to the 28 April in each state at 2.67% for MG, 5.39% for RJ and 6.0% for SP. For SP and RJ, the

102

CFR was consistently higher than reported elsewhere; for example at 2.6% (95% CI 0.89-6.7) for
the Diamond Princess cruise ship [20], and 3.67% (95% CI 3.56-3.80) and 1.2% (95% CI 0.3-2.7)

104

and 1.4% (95% CI 0.9-2.1) for Chinese regions [20–22].

106

We used the mortality time series (MTS) from MG, SP and RJ to project the cumulative number of
infections, making two main simplifying assumptions: first, that the infection fatality ratio (IFR) of

108

SARS-CoV-2 would be similar in the Brazilian states to that reported elsewhere; and second, that
the number of cumulative deaths in each state were well reported. We considered the IFR estimated

110

by Verity and colleagues (0.66%, CI 95% 0.39-1.33% [21]), for its general use in the modelling
literature [23]. The cumulative number of infections in time is taken to be 𝐼(𝑡) =

112

!"#
$%%

, where 𝐷(𝑡)

is the cumulative number of deaths. From 𝐼(𝑡) we further obtain the observation rate θ of reported
cases from 𝜃(𝑡) =

114

!(#)

%(#)
&(#)

where 𝑐(𝑡) is the number of reported cases in time. We found the

observation rate to have decreased in time for all states - a likely outcome of successful tracing and
testing only in the beginning, but with epidemic growth superseding tracing and testing efforts as

116

the epidemic progressed (S1 Fig). By 28 April 2020, the last time point analyzed, RJ and SP had
similar observation rates at 7.6% and 7.74% (respectively), while MG, where the epidemic started

118

later, the observation rate was 15.3% (1 case in 7 infections).
To compare transmission potential, we used reported cases (CTS) and mortality time series (MTS)

120

from MG, SP and RJ states to estimate the (effective) reproduction number R. For this, we
performed maximum likelihood estimation of the (CTS and MTS) epidemic growth r using a

122

phenomenological model, and two theoretical formulations on how r relates to R - one based on the
SEIR epidemiological framework by Wallinga and colleagues [24], and another on the distribution

124

of the serial interval [23] (see Supplementary Material for details). R was found to decrease in time
since first reported case for all states (S5 and S10 Figs). When considering the entire period from

126

first reported case to the 28 April, estimation methods gave similar R results per state (S6 and S11
Figs). For example, when using the CTS and serial interval formulation, R was 1.91 (CI 95% 1.2-

128

3.1) for SP, 1.88 (CI 95% 1.27-2.8) for RJ and 1.82 (CI 95% 1.2-3.25) for MG.

130

When using geographic information from reported cases in each state (Fig 2C and S13-14 Figs), we
found that cases were generally very dispersed in MG and more centralized around capital cities in

132

RJ and SP. In MG, reported cases were on average ~103 km away (CI 95% 1.39-488) from the
capital Belo Horizonte, while in SP they were ~0.05 km away from the city of São Paulo (CI 95%

134

0.05-269), and in RJ ~1.45 km away from the city of Rio de Janeiro (CI 95% 1.4-130). Similar
patterns were found for reported deaths (Fig 2B and S15-16 Figs). In MG, reported deaths were on

136

average ~229 km (CI 95% 1.39-488) away from Belo Horizonte, while in SP they were ~28 km
from São Paulo (CI 95% 0.05-270), and in RJ ~18 km away from Rio de Janeiro (CI 95% 1.45-

138

142).
Typically, incidence (cases, deaths) would be normalized per 100K individuals, taking into account

140

the total population size of each state. Because of the very different spatial dispersion of cases and
deaths in MG when compared to SP and RJ, we decided to also calculate the effective population

142

size - the sum of the population sizes of all municipalities with reports. When using reported cases,
we found that the effective population sizes were ~100%, ~100% and 64% of the total population

144

sizes of RJ, SP and MG, respectively. When using reported deaths, the effective population sizes
were ~95%, ~92%, and 35% of the total population sizes of RJ, SP and MG, respectively. Overall

146

these numbers suggest that in MG cases and deaths have been reported only in a subset of the
overall population, while in the other states SARS-CoV-2 appears widely dispersed. Incidence of

148

reported cases per 100K using the effective population size was ~60 in SP, ~51 in RJ and ~7.85 in
MG (S7 Fig), while incidence of deaths per 100K was ~5.56 in SP, ~4.69 in RJ and ~0.94 in MG

150

(S12 Fig).
In MG, samples from (clinically) suspected cases were screened at the Central Public Health

152

Laboratory/Octávio Magalhães Institute (IOM) of the Ezequiel Dias Foundation (FUNED), which
belongs to the public laboratories network of the Brazilian Ministry of Health (MoH). As of 3 April

154

2020, IOM/FUNED had performed 3,303 RT-qPCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 on swab samples from

patients living in 15 different MG's municipalities (Table 1).

Of the 40 samples, 17 (42.50%) were from the state's capital (Belo Horizonte), while the other
municipalities were represented by one, or a maximum of three samples. These samples were from

164

17 females and 23 males, with a collection date ranging from 4 March 2020, from the first positive
case diagnosed at IOM/FUNED, to 26 March 2020 (Table 1). The median age of the patients was 35

166

years (ranging from 19-79 years old). Selected samples had cycle threshold (Ct) values that ranged
from 16.41 to 31.86 (median= 22.945). We found no demographic variables (age, gender) to be

168

statistically correlated with sample Ct (S17 Fig). The new sequences have a median genome
coverage of 82.5% related to the reference genome NC_045512.3 (S1 Table). All sequences

Switzerland, Austria, England, Belgium, Germany, Czech Republic, and Hungary), while six

178

reported travel to countries in the Americas (USA, Colombia, Jamaica, Cayman Islands, Panama,
Chile, and Peru). One case reported travel to Israel.

180

To explore the history of the virus in MG, we performed a maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic
analysis on the dataset containing the 40 new sequences plus other 3,062 sequences deposited in

182

GISAID up to 15 April 2020. Our estimated ML phylogeny identified two major clades branching
at the root of the tree (Fig 3). These two clades were named lineages A and B, following a SARS-

184

CoV-2 lineage nomenclature recently proposed [26].
According to this nomenclature scheme, two main SARS-CoV-2 lineages could be identified as

186

lineage A, defined by the Wuhan/WH04/2020 strain, and as lineage B represented by the WuhanHu-1 strain. From these two main lineages, other sub-levels of descending lineages could be

188

determined. Following the publication of this proposed lineage nomenclature scheme, a tool for
automated lineage assignment was made publicly available in the GitHub repository

190

(https://github.com/hCoV-2019/pangolin) [27]. We used this tool to perform the assignment of
MG's sequences to the lineages [26]. The results of this lineage assignment showed that the majority

192

(n=32, 80%) of MG sequences were assigned to lineage B.1. This also includes sequences from
other countries such as Australia, China, Canada, Malaysia, and USA [28]. Moreover, two

194

sequences were assigned to lineage B.2 (isolates CV22 and CV36), and one sequence to lineage A
(isolate CV7) (see S2 Table for full results).

196

Slightly different from the lineage assignment approach mentioned before, in our ML phylogeny
most of MG's new sequences (n=37, 92,5%) were placed in a descendant lineage we named B.1,

198

which also included other sequences from GISAID sampled worldwide. Of these 37 sequences from
MG within lineage B.1 (Fig 3), 11 are isolates from cases that reported travel to European countries

(isolates CV2, CV3, CV11, CV13, CV17) or the Americas (isolates CV4, CV6, CV12, CV20,
CV28, CV35), in addition to the isolate CV1 from a traveler who returned from Israel. Two MG's

202

sequences (CV22 and CV9) fell into lineage B, one of which (CV22) reported travel to Germany.
The only sequence from MG that fell into lineage A refers to a case (CV7) that reported travel to

204

European countries (Fig 3 and Table 1).
To assess these lineages in more detail and in time, we performed Bayesian time-measured

206

phylogenetic analysis using a molecular clock model. We analyzed three sub-datasets (named subset
A, subset B and subset B.1) extracted from each lineage from the ML tree that included Brazilian

208

sequences. Our maximum clade credibility (MCC) trees showed that most of MG's sequences were
interspersed with other isolates sampled from other countries (Fig 4b, c, d). This pattern, similar to

210

that observed in other countries [28–30], is also in accordance with our ML tree and with the
epidemiological data, indicating that these isolates were linked to travel exposure rather than

212

community transmission, and reinforcing the idea that multiple independent introductions with
source abroad have occurred in MG.

214

Despite the observed dispersed distribution, some sequences from MG grouped together, forming
clusters that also included sequences from Brazil and other countries. Subset B.1 tree shows these

216

clusters containing more than one sequence from MG (Fig 4d). However, these clusters have very
low posterior probability support, because of the low genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 genomes

218

currently available worldwide [31–33]. Nonetheless, four clusters, each consisting of only two MG
sequences showed posterior probabilities of >80%. One of these clusters (Fig 4d), with a posterior

220

probability of 100%, was formed by isolates CV34 and CV36, referring to cases of seemingly local
transmission from contacts with a COVID-19 confirmed and suspected case, respectively.

222

From the time scaled phylogeny, we estimated the mean time of the most recent common ancestor
(tMRCA) of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Brazil to be 10 February 2020 (95% HPD interval 27

224

January to 22 February 2020), which is consistent with the start of reported cases in Brazil and with

the epidemiological data from the first case confirmed in SP, regarding a traveler returning from
226

Lombardy, Italy, on 21 February 2020 [11,13].
Despite the grouping of some MG sequences, we cannot infer a close relationship between these

228

sequences with certainty at this stage, because of the small sample size data which covers only
about 30 days of the epidemic in MG. That is, this dataset cannot fully represent the genetic

230

diversity of SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating. Moreover, the low genetic diversity of sequences
available so far limits conclusions about SARS-CoV-2 directionality and spread based solely on

232

genetic data. As observed in another study [32], due to the described limitations of the available
genomic data, the phylogenetic results presented should be approached with caution and considered

234

as hypothesis-generating on the transmission events of SARS-CoV-2 in a local setting.
In conclusion, at the end of April 2020, the COVID-19 epidemic in the state of MG was still

236

expanding (R>1) and it is highly dispersed with cases and deaths reported mostly away from the
capital city and with approximately only 64% and 35% of the total population being represented in

238

case and death reported data, respectively. Genomic data and other epidemiological information
from travel-related cases, allowed us to identify several introduction events that occurred

240

independently in MG, further helping to explain the geographical patchiness of reported cases and
deaths. These initial insights based on the restricted data that is available show that transmission is

242

likely to continue in the near future and suggest room to improve reporting. Increasing COVID-19
testing and SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequencing would help to better understand on how the virus is

244

spreading and would thus inform better control of the COVID-19 epidemic in Brazil.

Ethics statement
Anonymized samples processed in this study were sent to the Central Public Health Laborato-

250

ry/Octávio Magalhães Institute (IOM) of the Ezequiel Dias Foundation (FUNED), which belongs to
public laboratories network from Brazilian Ministry of Health (BMoH). They were previously ob-

252

tained by the local health services for routine diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 and epidemiological surveillance. The availability of these samples for research purposes during outbreaks of international

254

concern is allowed to the terms of the 510/2016 Resolution of the National Ethical Committee for
Research – Brazilian Ministry of Health (CONEP - Comissão Nacional de Ética em Pesquisa, Min-

256

istério da Saúde), that authorize the use of clinical samples collected in the Brazilian Central Public
Health Laboratories to accelerate knowledge building and contribute to surveillance and outbreak

258

response.

262

Sample collection and RT-qPCR diagnosis
Samples used in this study were residual anonymized clinical samples, with no or minimal risk to

264

patients, provided for research and surveillance purposes as described above. Swab samples
collected from COVID-19 suspected cases were sent from throughout the state of MG to IOM-

266

FUNED facilities. At IOM-FUNED, these samples were submitted to total RNA extraction with an
automated protocol on the QIAsymphony platform using QIAsymphony DSP Virus/Pathogen Kit

268

(Qiagen), following the manufacturer's recommendations. The molecular diagnosis was performed
on a 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Thermofisher Scientific), using a RT-qPCR singleplex kit for

270

the SARS-CoV-2 envelope and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase genes, developed by BioManguinhos/Fiocruz (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) and provided by the Brazilian Ministry of Healthy,

272

following the manufacturer's recommendations. We selected 48 samples with RT-qPCR positive
results available until 3 April 2020 from patients residing in different municipalities of the state of

274

MG and presenting symptoms such as fever, cough, headache, dyspnea, sore throat and/or vomiting.

cDNA synthesis and sequencing multiplex PCR
280

For the complementary DNA synthesis stage, the SuperScript IV Reverse Transcriptase kit
(Invitrogen) was used following the manufacturer's instructions. The generated cDNA generated

282

was subjected to sequencing multiplex PCR using Q5 High Fidelity Hot-Start DNA Polymerase
(New England Biolabs) and a set of specific primers, designed by ARTIC Network

284

(https://github.com/artic-network/artic-ncov2019/tree/master/primer_schemes/nCoV-2019/V1)

for

sequencing the complete genome of SARS-CoV-2 [34]. PCR conditions have been previously
286

reported in [34]. All experiments were performed on cabinet safety level 2.
Whole genome sequencing

288

Amplified PCR products were purified using the 1x AMPure XP Beads (Beckman Coulter)
following previously published protocol [35]. Purified PCR products were quantified using the

290

Qubit® dsDNA HS Assay Kits (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer's instructions. Of the 48
samples, only 40 contained enough DNA (≥ 2ng/µL) to proceed to library preparation. Sequencing

292

libraries were prepared using the Oxford Nanopore Ligation Sequencing Kit (SQK-LSK109)
following previously published protocol [35]. Before pooling all samples, each sample was

294

barcoded using the Native Barcoding Expansion kits (NBD104 and EXP-NBD114). After barcoding
adaptor ligation, sequencing libraries were loaded on a flow cell (FLO-MIN106) for subsequent

296

MinION sequencing, programmed to run for six hours. Reads were basecalled using Guppy and
barcode demultiplexing was performed using qcat. Consensus sequences were generated by de novo

298

assembling using Genome Detective and Coronavirus Typing Tool [36,37].

Phylogenetic analysis
Public SARS-CoV-2 complete genome sequences available up to 15 April 2020 were retrieved from

302

the GISAID. Sequences were aligned using MAFFT (FF-NS-2 algorithm) following default
parameters [38]. The alignment was manually curated to remove artifacts at the ends and within the

304

alignment using Aliview [39]. Phylogenetic analysis of these genome sequences was performed
using IQ-TREE (version 1.6.10) under the best fit model according to Bayesian Information

306

Criterion (BIC) indicated by the Model Finder application implemented in IQ-TREE [40]. The
statistical robustness of individual nodes was determined using 1000 bootstrap replicates.

308

Lineages assessment was conducted using Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak
LINeages tool available at https://github.com/hCoV-2019/pangolin [27]. Four complete or near-

310

complete SARS-CoV-2 genome datasets were generated. Dataset 1 (n =3,102) comprised the data
reported in this study (n = 40) plus publicly available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (n = 3,062) from

312

GISAID. Subsequently, to investigate the dynamic of the SARS-CoV-2 infection within the three
different SARS-CoV-2 lineages (A, B and B.1), Bayesian molecular clock analysis was conducted

314

on three smaller sub-datasets for each of the three lineages identified in the ML phylogeny and
containing MG' isolates (dataset 2 for subset A n = 100; dataset 3 for subset B n = 84; dataset 4 for

316

subset B.1 n = 169). ML trees from these three sub-datasets were inspected in TempEst v1.5.3 for
presence of temporal signal [41]. Linear regression of root-to-tip genetic distance against sampling

318

date indicated that the SARS-CoV-2 sequences evolve in clock-like manner (r = 0.43; r = 0.47; r =
0.40 from subset A; B and B.1, respectively) (results in S18 Fig). For Bayesian time-scaled

320

phylogenetic analysis we used BEAST 1.10.4 [42]. We employed the strict molecular clock model,
which assumes a single rate across all phylogeny branches. We used the HKY+G4 codon

322

partitioned (CP)1+2,3 substitution model and the exponential growth coalescent model [43]. We
computed MCMC (Markov chain Monte Carlo) triplicate runs of 100 million states each, sampling

324

every 10.000 steps for each sub-dataset. Convergence of MCMC chains was checked using Tracer

Figure 2. SARS-CoV-2 epidemic curve and spatial distribution of cases and deaths reported in
516

the states of Minas Gerais (MG), São Paulo (SP) and Rio de Janeiro (RJ) . Panel A: Daily
confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the state of MG. The X axis represents the days from the first case

518

in Brazil until 28 April 2020, while the Y axis represents the number of cases. The opposite side of
the Y axis represents the number of deaths related to COVID-19. Numbers from Y axis are

520

represented as log10. Panel B and C: Map with location (municipality) of deaths and case events,
colored by total number of reports. Different background colors highlight the boundaries of the

522

three states: Green for SP, purple for MG, Blue for RJ.
