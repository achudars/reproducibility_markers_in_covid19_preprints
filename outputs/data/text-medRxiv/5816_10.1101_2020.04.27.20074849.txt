Abstract
Background
The purpose of current study is to evaluate the analytical performance of seven kits
for detecting IgM/IgG antibody of corona virus (2019-nCoV) by using four
chemiluminescence immunoassay systems.
Methods
50 patients diagnosed with 2019-nCoV infection and 130 controls without corona
virus infection from the General Hospital of Chongqing were enrolled in current
retrospective study. Four chemiluminescence immunoassay systems including seven
IgM/IgG antibody detection Kits for 2019-nCoV (A_IgM, A_IgG, B_IgM, B_IgG,
C_IgM, C_IgG, D_Ab) were employed to detecting antibody concentration.
Chi-square test, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and Youden’s index
were demonstrated to verify the cutoff value of each detection system.
Results
The repeatability verification results of the A, B, C, and D system are all qualified.
D-Ab performances best (92% sensitivity and 99.23% specificity), and B_IgM worse
than other systems. Except for the system of A_IgM and C_IgG, the optimal
diagnostic thresholds and cutoff value of other kits from recommendations are
inconsistent with each other. B_IgM got the worst AUC and C_IgG had the best
diagnostic accuracy. More importantly, B_IgG system have the highest false positive

Introduction
The corona virus pneumonia (Corona Virus Disease 2019, COVID-19) is an acute
respiratory infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2
(SARS-CoV-2) [1]. The epidemic of the disease has not ended since the winter of
2019 and it is still raging around the world. SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious
through air, droplets and contacts. Generally, the incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is
3-7 days, but the longest incubation period can reach 14 days [2]. It has caused more
than 2,420,000 people infections and nearly 167,000 deaths worldwide until the end
of April 21th. Therefore, the early diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is very crucial.
Previous studies show that SARS-CoV-2 antigen stimulates the immune system to
produce an immune response, and specific IgM and IgG antibodies will appear in the
serum of patients after infecting [3]. The SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM and IgG antibody
tests have been involved in the diagnosis criteria for suspected cases whose
COVID-19 viral nucleic acid test appears false negative in recently published
guideline of Novel Corona Virus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment (Trial Version
7) which advocated by the National Health Committee [4].
Current popularly detection methods for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies include colloidal
gold and chemiluminescence immunoassay [5]. Chemiluminescence immunoassay is

a laboratory technology that combines a luminescence system with an immune
response. It not only has the specificity of the immune response, but also has the high
sensitivity of the luminescence reaction, and is widely used in immunoassays [6]. Our
laboratory currently has four automatic chemiluminescence immunoassay systems A,
B, C and D, of which the three detection systems A, B and C detect SARS-CoV-2
specific IgM and IgG antibodies respectively, and the D system detects total antibody
of IgM/IgG. Current investigation intends to evaluate the repeatability, clinical
sensitivity and specificity of 7 antibody detection kits for 4 detecting systems, as well
as the false positive rate in special populations. The Youden’s index verifies the best
diagnostic threshold (Cutoff value) of each detection system to understand the
analytical performance of each system detecting and ensure the detecting results.

Material and Methods
Sample Collection
50 serum samples from patients with SARS-CoV-2 diagnosed in January 2020 and
130 serum samples from patients with other conditions including 20 late pregnancy
women, 20 patients with solid tumors, 20 patients with AIDS, 21 patients over 90
years old and 49 normal controls were enrolled from the Immunology Department of
the Laboratory Department of Chongqing General Hospital (The Third Hospital) from
late February to March 2020. All collected serum specimens are inactivated in a water
bath at 56 ℃ for 1 hour, and then stored in a refrigerator at -80℃.

Precision verification
Under the condition of calibration and quality control of the detection systems, all of
them are qualified and the following experiments are carried out.
The cutoff value (cutoff value) is 1.0, 1.0, 1.10 AU/ml, 1.10 AU/ml, 10 AU/ml, 10
AU/ml and 1.0 in detection system of A_IgM, A_IgG, B_IgM, B_IgG, C_IgM,
C_IgG, D_Ab respectively. In 50 specimens of patients infected SARS-CoV-2, one
case of weak positive specimen with S/CO value within less than 3 times of cutoff
value

(Level1, L1) and one case with an S/CO value greater than 3 times of cutoff

value (Level 2, L2) were selected. Within-run precision was conducted firstly. All
detecting system analyzes their corresponding L1 and L2 specimens respectively,
conducting 20 consecutive tests. All test were completed within one day, observe 20
S/CO value, judge the result, and calculate its standard deviation and coefficient of
variation. The result is judged to be 100% in line, and the coefficient of variation is
less than 10% is qualified. Between-run precision was conducted secondly. Detecting
system analyze the corresponding L1 and L2 specimens once a day, and continuously

its standard deviation and coefficient of variation. The result is judged to be 100% in
line, and the coefficient of variation is less than 15% is qualified.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were conducted using R software (http://www.R-project.org/).
Evaluation of sensitivity with 95% CI, specificity with 95% CI and false positives in
specific populations were conducted separately. Use ROC curve (R packages pROC)
and Youden’s index to calculate the optimal diagnostic threshold (Cutoff value) of the
detection system.

Results
In order to test precision of each kit, we performed within-run and between-run
detecting. As can be seen from Table 1, the repeatability verification results of the A,
B, C, and D system are all qualified. Among them, system D performance best and
systems B performance worst in the weak positive specimens. More important,
system of B_IgM and B_IgG are nearly twice as precise as C_IgM and D-Ab.
Total 50 patients were considered as COVID-19 because viral nucleic acid test
appears positive, and other 130 controls got negative result of viral nucleic acid.
Overall 180 subjects were tested for COVID-19 specific serological assay. The results
showed vary sensitivity and specificity among different kits. D-Ab performances best
(92% sensitivity and 99.23% specificity), and B_IgM worse than others (Table2).
ROC curve was depicted by using original S/CO value (Figure1). According to ROC
curve, we can get optimal operating point of different kits (Table 3). It can be
conclude that, except for the optimal operating thresholds of A_IgM and C_IgG, the
optimal diagnostic thresholds of other kits and the Cutoff value from
recommendations are inconsistent with each other. The results showed that the AUC
of D_Ab reached 0.95 and Youden’s index is 0.93 (Table 3). The optimal cutoff value
was 0.54, with sensitivity and specificity values of 99% and 94%, respectively.
According to the optimal operating threshold, there were only 3 patients who had a
negative result and two controls had a positive result. Totally, B_IgM got the worst

AUC and C_IgG had the best diagnostic accuracy.
Considering endogenous and exogenous factors exist in the process of antibody assay,
subgroups of controls including patients with AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome), tumor, pregnant and elders more than 90 years old were involved in
current analysis. Each system has false positive results in the selected subgroup of
controls (Table 4). It is worth noting that B_IgG system have the highest false
positive rate for testing patients with AIDS, tumor and pregnant. A_IgM system test
showed the highest false positive rates among elder over 90 years old.

Discussions
SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the β genus and is the seventh well-known corona virus
infected human beings. Its nucleocapsid protein (NP) stimulates human immune
system to cause chemical reactions. Specific IgM antibodies emergence at the 7th day
of infecting, and appear at peaks after 28 days. Specific IgG antibody emerged around
the 10th day of infecting, and reached peaks after 49 days, which can maintain at a
long time in the blood. The median time for total plasma antibodies appear at the 12th
day after infecting [7, 8]. In current investigation, the average time of serum collection
in all subjects at 13 days after diagnosis, therefore it is considered that specific IgM
and IgG antibodies should already exist in the specimen.
With the published guideline of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and
Treatment Program (Trial Version 7) [4], the suspected cases comply with condition of
positive for serum specific 2019-nCoV IgM/IgG antibodies, or the specific
2019-nCoV IgG antibody performance positive, or 2019-nCoV IgG antibody is 4
times in recovery period than that of the acute period can confirm diagnosis of
COVID-19 [9, 10]. The diagnosis standard of COVID-19 changed the situation. There
is a huge market demand for SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection reagents worldwide.
Manufacturers domestically produce antibody detection reagents which are used in
the clinical laboratory. Previous investigation has shown that the clinical specificity

and sensitivity of some 2019-nCoV IgM antibody are 96.2% and 70.24%, respectively.
And the clinical specificity and sensitivity of 2019-nCoV IgG antibody are 92.4% and
96.1% [6]. Therefore, the false negative and false positive results will appear in the
detection, which will cause confusion to clinical judgment. So the laboratory needs to
pay close attention to the performance indicators of the reagents used.
Seven detection kits from four chemiluminescence systems were used in current study.
All of the kits have been permitted to use in the emergency approval of the China
National Drug Administration or the EU CE sales, and have been applied to clinical
detecting. According to the requirements of People's Republic of China Health
Industry Standard WS/T 505-2017 "Qualitative Measurement Performance Evaluation
Guidelines" [10], the performance indicators of qualitative kits should focus on
repeatability, clinical accuracy (including clinical sensitivity and specificity) and
verification of Cutoff value. The results showed that the repeatability of all detecting
systems is in line with the manufacturer's statement, but the variance among them is
relatively big. Specifically, the coefficients of variation regarding B-IgM and B-IgG
are larger than others.
According to guideline of WS/T 494-2017, the sensitivity and specificity of
qualitative items for different occasions are also regulated. In the using of preliminary
screening tests, the sensitivity should be greater than 95%. In the occasion of diagnose,
both of the sensitivity and specificity should be greater than 95%. In a confirmed
diagnostic test, the specificity should be greater than 98% [9]. According to the result
of current study, the clinical sensitivity and specificity from all detecting systems does
not meet the requirements of screening, diagnosis and confirm diagnosis experiments.
Therefore, all detection systems cannot be used independently for the diagnosis and of
SARS-CoV-2 infections, and need to be used together with nucleic acids test and
clinical symptoms considering.
Regarding the confounding factors influence detection results, we divided controls for
subgroups which includes patients with AIDS, tumor, pregnant and older people over
90 years old [5,11-12]. The results of current investigation show that B_IgM has the

lowest sensitivity, indicating the possibility of higher false negatives which can occur
at the window period of viral infection or at the patients with lower immunity.
B_IgG has the lowest specificity which indicated higher false positives and prone to
occur for special patients, such as AIDS, solid tumor, pregnant and the elderly, etc.[13]
The reason of false positives may be due to some interfering substances (such as
rheumatoid factor, homologous to the kit antibodies, etc.) present in the specimen.
Simultaneously, according to the area under the ROC curve of each detecting system,
it is found that the diagnostic accuracy of B_IgM and B_IgG also demonstrated worst,
and the diagnostic accuracy of the other systems is better. In addition, according to
ROC curve and Youden’s index, the best diagnostic thresholds exist in A-IgM and
C-IgG, and others are inconsistent with the manufacturer's declaration. The optimal
threshold of A_IgG, B_IgM, C_IgM, D_Ab are less than the Cutoff value indicating
more false positive results. The optimal threshold of C_IgM is greater than the Cutoff
value, indicating more false negative cases.
Therefore, the laboratory should conduct the necessary performance evaluation of the
selected novel coronavirus antibody, carefully interpret the results of the novel
coronavirus antibody, make the necessary further testing requirements, and reduce the
missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis.
