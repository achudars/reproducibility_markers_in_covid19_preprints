Abstract

2

Background

3

Low-income countries have reduced health care system capacity and are therefore at risk of

4

substantially higher COVID-19 case fatality rates than those currently seen in high-income countries.

5

Handwashing is a key component of guidance to reduce transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus,

6

responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior systematic reviews have indicated the effectiveness of

7

handwashing to reduce transmission of respiratory viruses. In low-income countries, reduction of

8

transmission is of paramount importance but social distancing is challenged by high population densities

9

and access to handwashing facilities with soap and water is limited.

10

Objectives

11

To estimate global access to handwashing with soap and water to inform use of handwashing in the

12

prevention of COVID-19 transmission.

13

Methods

14

We utilized observational surveys and spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression modeling in the

15

context of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study, to estimate access to a

16

handwashing station with available soap and water for 1062 locations from 1990 to 2019.

17

Results

18

Despite overall improvements from 1990 (33.6% [95% uncertainty interval 31.5–35.6] without access) to

19

2019, globally in 2019, 2.02 (1.91–2.14) billion people—26.1% (24.7–27.7) of the global population

20

lacked access to handwashing with available soap and water. More than 50% of the population in sub-

21

Saharan Africa and Oceania were without access to handwashing in 2019, while in eight countries, more

22

50 million or more persons lacked access.

23

Discussion

24

For populations without handwashing access, immediate improvements in access or alternative

25

strategies are urgently needed, while disparities in handwashing access should be incorporated into

26

COVID-19 forecasting models when applied to low-income countries.

Introduction

34

In the initial months of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the outbreak has been

35

concentrated in middle- and high-income countries: initially China, followed by high-income east Asia,

36

the Middle East, Europe, and North America. Even as health care systems in these relatively well-

37

equipped regions are strained, there will soon be a need to focus on populations in low-income

38

countries (LICs) where health care resources are limited, even before facing the demands of the

39

pandemic. Along with social distancing, handwashing has been advised repeatedly as one of the key

40

actions to reduce transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic (Centers

41

for Disease Control and Prevention; World Health Organization, 2020). In a systematic review of physical

42

interventions employed to reduce the transmission of respiratory viruses, handwashing was indicated to

43

be effective with a meta-analytic summary estimate of a 45-55% reduction in transmission(Jefferson et

44

al. 2009, 2011). Similarly, a systematic review of the effectiveness of personal protective measures in

45

preventing H1N1 pandemic influenza transmission in human populations indicated a 38% reduction in

46

transmission with handwashing, while mask use was less effective and data for cough etiquette

47

insufficient (Saunders-Hastings et al. 2017). A review of influenza transmission in adults also concluded

48

that handwashing was effective in reducing transmission (Smith et al. 2015).

49

While access to handwashing facilities with soap and water is near-universal in high-income countries,

50

the same is not true for LICs. As limited access to handwashing facilities may promote the spread and

51

magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic in low-income countries, governments and aid agencies may

52

prioritise rapid deployment of access or alternatives such as alcohol-containing handrub solutions to

53

those locations without access. Further, application of COVID-19 forecasting models, especially those

54

derived from high- and middle-income country data, to LICs may need to account for handwashing

55

access.

56

In the context of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD), we estimated

57

access to a handwashing station with available soap and water for 1062 locations from 1990 to 2019.

58

Methods

59

Access to a handwashing station with available soap and water was based on the WHO/UNICEF Joint

60

Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (The WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring

61

Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (JMP)) definition for basic hygiene of “Availability

62

of a handwashing facility on premises with soap and water,” where a handwashing facility was defined

63

according to Sustainable Development Goal 6.2.1 as “a device to contain, transport or regulate the flow

64

of water to facilitate handwashing.” (Progress on Drinking Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Update and

65

SDG Baselines 2017 Launch version July 12 Main report 2017). This measure is a proxy of actual

66

handwashing practice, but one with improved accuracy compared with other proxy measures such as

67

self-reported handwashing (Ram 2013). A full list of data sources (Excel Table S1) as well as a tabulation

68

of sources by country and year (Excel Table S2) can be found in the Supplemental Material. We

69

systematically reviewed and re-extracted all primary input sources to ensure data quality. When surveys

70

were extracted at the household level, the household weights were multiplied by the household size to

71

provide individual weights for tabulating access by individuals. Thus, all estimates are provided at the

72

individual level to ensure larger households are properly captured. All data were extracted from the

73

original microdata at either the household or individual level, processed to standardize indicators and

74

expanded household weights to individual weights, and then tabulated by national or subnational

75

location. We excluded sources that did not include sample weights, were not representative of the

76

population of a GBD (national or subnational) location, were missing data for handwashing station,

77

available water, and/or available soap, or reported a single, aggregated “handwashing agent” indicator

78

that included ash, sand, or soil in addition to soap. Country-specific Demographic and Health Surveys

79

(DHS), Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), and Performance Monitoring and Accountability 2020

80

(PMA2020) surveys as well as several censuses conducted from 2008 to 2019 were included as inputs.

81

Input data sources prior to 2008 were excluded due to data quality with respect to capturing all three

82

aspects satisfying the definition of basic hygiene: 1) presence of a station, with available 2) soap and 3)

83

water.

84
85

These data sources were used as inputs into the GBD 2017 spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression

86

(ST-GPR) modelling tool, which has been described in detail elsewhere (Stanaway et al. 2018). Briefly,

87

this tool uses a two-stage modelling framework that includes a mixed effect linear regression model,

88

followed by a ST-GPR step to model the proportion of the population with access to a handwashing

89

station on premises with available soap and water by year and location from 1990 – 2019. This model

90

allows us to borrow strength across space and time, and leverage information from predictive covariates

91

to produce a complete set of estimates for all GBD locations and estimation years. The linear regression

92

model included as covariates the proportion of individuals with access to piped water (modeled in a

93

similar fashion from country-specific surveys) and the Socio-demographic Index (SDI, a composite

94

measure including income per capita, education, and fertility), with region and super-region random

95

effects. In total 153 surveys from 88 countries and territories were included as inputs (Figure 1). Piped

96

water was included as a covariate as there was an observed statistical relationship between piped water

97

and handwashing access in surveys where both were collected, and since more complete information on

98

piped water was available from surveys than for handwashing access. We therefore use estimates of

99

piped water as a predictive covariate to improve estimates of handwashing. All of the included data

100

sources were from the years 2008–2019. In total we estimated access for 204 national and non-

101

sovereign locations (eg, Guam, Puerto Rico) and 858 sub-national administrative areas. In India, we also

102

model urban and rural locations as source input data and covariates have been coded to urban and rural

103

locations through the GBD collaborator network. In several other locations, sub-national administrative

104

boundaries define urban (metropolitan) areas allowing for some inferences on access to handwashing

105

facilities with available soap and water.

106

107

Results

108

In 2019, 2.02 (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 1.91–2.14) billion people—26.1% of the global population—

109

were estimated to lack access to handwashing facilities with soap and water. We estimated higher

110

proportions without access in LICs, especially those in sub-Saharan Africa, south Asia and the Caribbean

111

(Figure 2). In 46 countries more than half of the population lacked access, and in eight countries (India,

112

Nigeria, China, Ethiopia, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Indonesia) more than

113

50 million persons were estimated to be without handwashing access. Example figures showing the ST-

114

GPR estimates and fits to survey data for these locations are provided in the Supplemental Material

115

(Figures S1-S8). In India alone, some 499 million (393–608) people lacked access. Estimates for all

116

national (Excel File S3) and sub-national (Excel File S4) locations for all years from 1990 – 2019 are

117

provided in the Supplemental Material.

119

While the numbers of people lacking access to handwashing facilities with soap and water are large,

120

there have been substantial improvements in many regions of the world (Table 1). In particular, we

121

estimated that there were more than 25% reductions in lack of access from 1990 to 2019 in 17 countries

122

and territories (Paraguay, Gabon, Bhutan, Equatorial Guinea, Oman, Botswana, São Tomé and Príncipe,

123

Tanzania, Palestine, Guatemala, Nepal, Marshall Islands, Morocco, Tokelau, Tuvalu, Congo, Saudi Arabia)

124

(Excel File S3, Figures S1 – S21). These reductions parallel region-wide improvements in some cases (eg,

125

north Africa and the Middle East, Latin America) while others are unique examples within their

126

respective regions (eg, Bhutan, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, Tanzania, Botswana, São Tomé and Príncipe).

127

Overall however, little progress has been made throughout most of sub-Saharan Africa. Access is

128

strongly related to SDI although substantial variability is present at similar SDI levels and within regions

129

(Figure 3).

130

131

Discussion

132

Low-income countries have reduced health care system capacity and are therefore at risk of

133

substantially higher COVID-19 case fatality rates than those currently seen in high-income countries. In

134

this context, suppression of transmission has heightened urgency. Inadequate access to handwashing

135

facilities with soap and water remains prevalent in many LICs, and this is likely to facilitate COVID-19

136

transmission. Rural populations have disproportionately poor access to handwashing facilities; for

137

example, across India, state-level estimates ranged from 6% without access (Mizoram) to 31% (Odisha)

138

in urban areas, and from 13% without access (rural Delhi) to 68% (Jharkhand) in rural areas. However,

139

access is also limited in urban slums and other informal settlements. Our estimates indicate that, in

140

2019, 15% of the population in urban Delhi, 58% in Addis Ababa (province) and 54% in Nairobi

141

(province) lacked handwashing access. Should the pandemic coincide with water shortages, such as

142

those seen in Cape Town and Chennai in 2019 (Holden and Doshi 2019), access will be further restricted

143

and will disproportionately harm those who can least afford to pay for water. In densely-populated

144

urban areas, social distancing is also very challenging given high population densities. Further, effective

145

within-household quarantine is likely impossible with larger families living together in a single home.

146

Reducing COVID-19 transmission in high-density urban areas with low access to handwashing may prove

147

especially difficult and will require urgent attention and implementation of alternative strategies to

148

those implemented in high- and middle-income countries.

149

Alcohol-containing handrub solutions are an efficacious alternative to hand washing with soap and

150

water (Kampf 2018). Guidance exists for local production of handrub solutions, and evidence from prior

151

epidemics supports the effectiveness of local production (World Health Organization 2010). However,

152

reliance on handrub solutions is less desirable compared to handwashing given requirements for

153

sustainable production and distribution, cost implications for low-income populations, concerns

154

regarding flammability of reagents, and the potential for poisoning due to ingestion (Gormley et al.

155

2012). Further, access to handwashing with soap and water can offer more equitable and lasting

156

protection in future epidemics and also protect against non-epidemic transmission of diarrheal disease

157

(Wolf et al. 2018) and lower respiratory infections (Mbakaya et al. 2017; Rabie and Curtis 2006) if

158

sufficiently maintained. Indeed, in 2017 inadequate access to handwashing was estimated to be

159

responsible for 35% of the global diarrheal disease burden and 9.7% of the global burden from lower

160

respiratory infections, in total accounting for 38.4 million DALYs (95% UI 22.8–52.0), and 707 000 deaths

161

(416 000–1 022 000) (Stanaway et al. 2018).

Increases in these and other common causes of death

162

unrelated to COVID-19 are also likely to be affected as LIC health care systems are overwhelmed during

163

the pandemic. Immediate efforts to increase handwashing access or alternatives could help alleviate

164

some of the baseline disease burden from diarrhea and lower respiratory infections during the

165

pandemic and spare valuable resources to focus on COVID-19 cases.

166

Progress towards improving access to handwashing has been accelerated given the recognition of its

169

importance in two of the Millennium Development Goals, reducing childhood mortality and combatting
HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases, and more recently as part of Sustainable Development Goal 6: to
ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, with the indicator 6.2.1

170

used in this analysis (6.2.1 Proportion of Population with Basic Handwashing Facilities on Premises - SDG

171

Global Indicator Platform). With estimates provided here for 2019, this analysis presents the most

172

recent and comprehensive global estimates of handwashing access to date, including estimates for 204

173

national and non-sovereign locations and 858 sub-national administrative areas. The enhanced spatial

174

resolution gained by including sub-national locations reduces the potential for spatial misalignment

175

between survey responses and population density, thereby providing a more accurate picture of the

176

true population with access in each country, and offers policy makers more detailed and actionable

177

evidence.

178

As in most global-scale analyses, these estimates include several limitations. Most importantly, while

179

we developed comprehensive global estimates, a number of potential sources from 2000 to 2005

180

reported a soap indicator which included “other handwashing agents” such as ash, sand, or soil and

181

therefore did not meet JMP’s definition for basic hygiene (The WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring

182

Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (JMP)). This considerable limitation is reflected in

183

the uncertainty in national-level estimates. These national level estimates are based on recently

184

available survey data; however, the year of the most recent survey varies by location, also contributing

185

to uncertainty. While our spatiotemporal model estimates incorporate trends to estimate access in

186

2019, the most recent source input data may have been from earlier years (Excel File S1, Excel File S2).

187

Similarly, estimates for years prior to 2008 were derived from the ST-GPR model and not from survey

188

inputs. This is reflected in uncertainty intervals (Figures S22-S29). Further, our estimates likely do not

189

reflect recent disruptive events such as conflict, large-scale migration, or natural disasters. These events

190

are likely to increase the number of people living without access to handwashing and also to increase

191

the number of people living in densely populated settings where social distancing is also challenged. As

192

the input data sources are based on snapshot observations, they also do not reflect intermittent or

193

discontinued water supplies which can be common in many locations. Data coverage was best

194

throughout Africa and relatively poor in South America and south and east Asia (Figure 1). Our

195

estimates also do not include access to handwashing facilities in non-household settings such as schools,

196

workplaces health care facilities and other public locations such as markets. The extent to which these

197

locations may remain accessible during stay at home and other restrictions related to the COVID-19

198

response is unknown.

199

Our estimates update and expand upon other available estimates of handwashing access developed by

200

the WHO and the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Program (JMP). Specifically, we produce estimates on

201

a much broader spatial and temporal scale. The most recent JMP report includes estimates for 96

202

countries up to the year 2017 (Progress on household drinking water, sanitation and hygiene I 2000-

203

2017: Special focus on inequalities 2019), as well as urban and rural estimates for most of those

204

locations, while we estimate for 1062 national and subnational locations from 1990-2019. We are able

205

to do so because our modeling methods borrow strength across time and space and leverage

206

information from predictive covariates to produce estimates for locations without data. The first stage

207

of our modeling process involves running a mixed-effects linear model, with fixed effects on socio-

208

demographic index (SDI) and proportion of the population with access to a piped water source, and

209

country- and region-level random effects. These covariates inform the model fit in all locations,

210

especially those without data. After the linear model is run, the next steps involve spatial and temporal

211

smoothing. Essentially, when estimating for any given location-year, data points that are geographically

212

and temporally proximate are weighted more heavily than more distant data points. For example, if a

213

subnational location has no data, the national-level data informs the model fit; similarly, in a country

214

with no data, the region-level data informs its estimates. Our estimation models allow for non-linear

215

trends, borrows strength from similar sources to extend spatial coverage, uses predictive covariates to

216

inform estimates, and leads to more robust estimates by including both large and smaller surveys. In

217

comparison, JMP uses a set of rules to linearly interpolate and extrapolate data separately for each

218

location.

219

JMP reports three different levels of access to handwashing: "basic", meaning access to a handwashing

220

facility with soap and water; "limited", a facility with no soap or water, and "none." Because we defined

221

anyone without access to a handwashing facility with soap and water as having no access, we compared

222

our estimates to the sum of JMP’s “limited” category (access to a facility, but no soap or water) and “no

223

facility” category. The overall correlation coefficient between the two sets of estimates (for locations

224

where JMP provides estimates) was 0.94, while the year-specific correlation coefficient ranged from

225

0.91 (comparing 2017 estimates, the most recent year of JMP estimates) to 0.985 (comparing 2003

226

estimates).

227

We have presented estimates of access to handwashing facilities which is an imperfect proxy for actual

228

handwashing behavior, as previous research indicates that the prevalence of actual handwashing is

229

lower than the prevalence of access to handwashing facilities (Freeman et al. 2014; Wolf et al. 2018).

230

Despite this limitation our approach has two notable advantages. First, whereas adequate data exist to

231

model access, data on handwashing behavior are inadequate to support a reliable global model. Second,

232

the proportion of people with access to handwashing likely represents the upper limit of the proportion

233

of people engaged in handwashing. Since concerns about COVID transmission have likely increased

234

handwashing well above regular levels, access might better represent current handwashing levels.

235

Understanding disparities in handwashing access must be considered in COVID-19 forecasting models,

236

especially when applied to low-income countries. Specifically, as the pandemic has initially affected

237

mainly high income countries with high handwashing access, transfer of transmission efficiency

238

estimates and/or epidemic time trends from such settings should be adjusted when applied to settings

239

with poor access to handwashing. For example, R0 estimates may be higher and/or more uncertain in

240

settings with poor handwashing access compared to those estimated from high-income country settings

241

where the first wave of the epidemic has largely been completed. Further, the impacts of social

242

distancing which appear to have been successful in reducing transmission in high income country

243

settings (which typically have high levels of handwashing access) may be less effective in settings where

244

handwashing access is low. We suggest including variation in handwashing access as a covariate in the

245

application of forecasts to data sparse low income countries.

246

In the context of the global impact of COVID-19, inadequate access to handwashing affects a large

247

proportion of the world’s population and may undermine strategies for control of disease transmission.

248

For those locations currently without access, alternative strategies are urgently needed. To the extent

249

that access can be implemented in the short-term, opportunities exist to both help reduce COVID-19

250

transmission and to reduce in the long-term the 707 000 deaths from diarrheal disease and lower

251

respiratory infections that are attributable to no handwashing access.
