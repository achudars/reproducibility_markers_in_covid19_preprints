Abstract
Drug repurposing has the potential to bring existing de-risked drugs for effective intervention in
an ongoing pandemic—COVID-19 that has infected over 131 million, with 2.8 million people
succumbing to the illness globally (as of April 04, 2021). We have used a novel `gene signature'based drug repositioning strategy by applying widely accepted gene ranking algorithms to
prioritize the FDA approved or under trial drugs. We mined publically available RNA
sequencing (RNA-Seq) data using CLC Genomics Workbench 20 (QIAGEN) and identified 283
differentially expressed genes (FDR<0.05, log2FC>1) after a meta-analysis of three independent
studies which were based on severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) infection in primary human airway epithelial cells. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA)
revealed that SARS-CoV-2 activated key canonical pathways and gene networks that intricately
regulate general anti-viral as well as specific inflammatory pathways. Drug database, extracted
from the Metacore and IPA, identified 15 drug targets (with information on COVID-19
pathogenesis) with 46 existing drugs as potential-novel candidates for repurposing for COVID19 treatment. We found 35 novel drugs that inhibit targets (ALPL, CXCL8, and IL6) already in
clinical trials for COVID-19. Also, we found 6 existing drugs against 4 potential anti-COVID-19
targets (CCL20, CSF3, CXCL1, CXCL10) that might have novel anti-COVID-19 indications.
Finally, these drug targets were computationally prioritized based on gene ranking algorithms,
which revealed CXCL10 as the common and strongest candidate with 2 existing drugs.
Furthermore, the list of 283 SARS-CoV-2-associated proteins could be valuable not only as antiCOVID-19 targets but also useful for COVID-19 biomarker development.

Introduction
A novel coronavirus (CoV) began at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China: it infected over seventy
thousand individuals within the first fifty days of the epidemic with 1800 individuals
succumbing to the disease [1]. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared a public health
emergency of international concern on January 30 that escalated to a pandemic on March 11,
2020 [2]. Amino acid and nucleotide sequencing studies confirmed this new CoV belonged to
the same species as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1) [3]. The
International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) named this new CoV as severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the disease as CoV disease 2019
(COVID-19) [4]. SARS-CoV-2 consists of four structural proteins including spike (S)
glycoprotein, envelope (E) protein, membrane (M) protein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein. Host
cell binding and entry are mediated by the S protein. The S1 subunit of the S protein can mediate
entry into human respiratory epithelial cells by interacting with cell surface receptors like
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Entry also requires S protein priming by cellular
proteases like Type II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2), resulting in S protein
cleavage and fusion of viral and airway cellular membranes [5]. Patients with infected airway
epithelium can present with a range of symptoms including fever, cough, and shortness of breath,
often culminating in acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary failure,
and even death [6]. As of April 04, 2021, more than 30 million cases of COVID-19 have been
reported with over 1.6% mortality rate in the U.S. alone [7]. According to WHO's International
Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), 8,936 projects including 5,126 interventional studies
are registered related to COVID-19 across the globe (searched on April 04, 2021) [8]. With the
possible exception of dexamethasone and anti-inflammatory therapy, the currently available
medications have questionable and limited efficacy against improving outcomes after COVID19. The WHO SOLIDARITY trial (an international clinical trial to seek an effective treatment
for COVID-19) results have shown that remdesivir (FDA approved drug for COVID-19
treatment) has little or no efficacy on mortality rate in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [9].
Therefore, there is an urgent need to further identify novel medical therapies both for preventive
and therapeutic use. Drug repurposing could significantly curtail the time and cost of
development compared to de novo drug discovery, as toxicity and safety data are often available

from former clinical trial phases [10]. In silico approaches based on functional annotations
proffer novel testable hypotheses for systematic drug repurposing [11].
RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) based transcriptional profiling of SARS-CoV-2 infected
airway epithelial cells provides a remarkable opportunity for understanding the relationship
between infection-triggered gene expression signature and viral pathogenesis. A meta-analysis
using differentially expressed genes (DEGs) obtained from RNA-Seq studies has the potential to
advance our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and facilitates the process of antiCOVID-19 drug repurposing. This current study systematically and quantitatively combined
analysis of multiple RNA-Seq studies using a meta-analysis approach. This helps decrease the
inconsistency in individual studies by increasing the sample size and statistical power to enlist
more robust SARS-CoV-2-associated genes [12]. Furthermore, existing, approved drugs with
opposing effects on these SARS-CoV-2-associated genes could have the potential to reverse
COVID-19 symptoms. Therefore, we employed an in silico approach to discover potential antiCOVID-19 drug targets and suggest a priority for repurposing drugs which are FDA approved or
under clinical trial investigation as potential COVID-19 therapies. Finally, this work provides
insights into the untested but potential gene targets in relation to COVID-19 pathogenesis.

Materials and methods
Study search
This study utilized the CLC Genomics Workbench 20.0.3 database [13] to search for
deposited RNA-Sequencing experiments related to SARS-CoV-2 infections that matched the
following criteria: only whole transcriptome studies; experiments carried out in human airway
epithelial cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 in vitro; and availability of the raw data (.fastq files)
for each sample. We searched on Dec 03, 2020 with search terms: “SARS-CoV-2”, “SARSCoV-2 pandemic”, “SARS-CoV-2 host response”, “SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome”, “COVID-19”,
“COVID-19 pandemic”, “COVID-19 host response”, and “COVID-19 transcriptome”. We
identified three independent studies shown in Table 1 and selected the reads associated with
SARS-CoV-2 or mock-treated airway epithelial cells. Details of selected reads and experimental
conditions are given in Table S1.

RNA-sequencing data collection, processing, and analysis
Raw reads (.fastq files) were downloaded from CLC genomics workbench 20.0.3 [13]. A
quality check for raw reads was performed. Low-quality bases (Phred score<20) and adapters
were excluded. Trimmed reads were mapped to the human_sequence_hg38 reference genome to
verify valid reads. Reads were extracted, counted, and normalized. Genes with false discovery
rate (FDR)-adjusted p-values<0.05 and log2 fold change (log2FC)>1 were considered to be
statistically significant (Figure 1).
The gene datasets were analyzed for disease and disorders, molecular and cellular
functions, and canonical pathways using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) version 60467501
[14]. Only experimentally observed studies associated to the human species were used for IPA
analysis. Fisher’s exact test was used to calculate a p-value determining the probability that

overlap with each canonical pathway is due to chance alone. In contrast to canonical pathways,
which are relatively immutable in IPA, gene networks were also generated de novo in IPA based
on the list of genes that are imported. IPA takes Network Eligible molecules from the gene list,
searches the Ingenuity Knowledge Base, and uses a network algorithm to draw connections
between molecules based on biological function [14].

Mapping SARS-CoV-2-related DEGs to FDA approved/ clinical
drugs
To establish a link between SARS-CoV-2-related genes to drugs, we used a commercial
drug database of Metacore version 20.3 build 70200 from Clarivate Analytics [15] and IPA [14].
To highlight the most promising drugs that might be repurposed for COVID-19 treatment, only
drug targets that were either FDA approved or had been examined in clinical trials were selected.
From these drug databases, we extracted information on drug name, drug target, and drugs’
mechanism of action.

Information on pathogenesis and the drugs’ modes of action for
anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug repurposing
The list of all genes involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 was extracted (as of April
04, 2021) from the IPA database. Information on specific target activity and the effect of each
target on disease/function were examined. Target pathogenesis information with the drugs'
mechanisms of action retrieved from the drug databases was used to rationally shortlist
promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs.

Computational analysis of candidate drug targets and repurposed
drugs
Validation of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug targets derived from the SARS-CoV-2 infection
induced transcriptome of human airway epithelium, was performed using two globally-accepted
disease gene prioritizing tools [16]. Gene prioritization tools utilize mathematical and
computational models of disease to filter the original set of genes based on functional similarity
(Toppgene tool, https://toppgene.cchmc.org) and, topological features in protein-protein
interaction (Toppnet tool, https://toppgene.cchmc.org) to the training genes. The Online
Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database (http://www.omim.org) was searched for genes
(training genes) whose inhibition or activation significantly affects the progression of SARSCoV pathogenesis in human patients.

Results
SARS-CoV-2 induced transcriptome in human airway epithelium
This meta-analysis identified 283 DEGs at FDR<0.05 and log2FC>1 (Table S2). IPA
identified 27 disease and disorders (p-value<0.05) (Figure 2A; Table S3A), 21 cellular and
molecular functions (p-value<0.05) (Figure 2B; Table S3B), and 275 canonical pathways (pvalue<0.05) (Fig 2C; Table S3C). Infectious disease and Cell movement, cell death/survival, and
cell signaling were the major disease and cellular functions respectively compromised following
SARS-CoV-2 infection in respiratory epithelium. Canonical pathway analysis showed the role of
IL17A in psoriasis, the role of IL17F in inflammation in airways, and chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD) signaling pathways were severely affected by SARS-CoV-2
infection. Overall, this suggests the infectious inflammatory nature of host response in
respiratory epithelial cells that could culminate in cell death and other respiratory problems in
response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, consistent with what is seen in clinical practice.
The IPA network algorithm created 25 connection network between molecules based on
biological function (Table S3D) and ranked them as per the network score. The score takes into

account the number of Network Eligible molecules in the network and its size, as well as the
total number of Network Eligible molecules analyzed and the total number of molecules in the
Ingenuity Knowledge Base that could potentially be included in networks. The higher the score,
the lower the probability of finding the observed number of Network Eligible molecules in a
given network by random chance. Figure 3 shows three most relevant networks. Network-1
(score=35; Figure 3A) was associated with 23 genes of our dataset and was associated with
'Cellular movement, hematological system development and function, immune cell trafficking'.
This network was characterized by key cytokines IL6, IL16, CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL5, CXCL6,
CXCL8, CXCL10, and CCL20. Network-2 (score=25; Figure 3B) was associated with 'Cellular
development, cellular growth and proliferation, embryonic development'

with transcription

factors (POU6F1, MAFB), enzymes (RSAD2, AKR1C1, GBP5, TRIM36, GSTA2), and
cytokines (CD70, CSF2, CSF3) as hub molecules. Network-3 (score=19; Figure 3C) was
associated with 'Cell death and survival, cell morphology, organismal development'. This
network was centralized on transcription factors (SOX6, ZNF114), enzymes (CMBL,
CSGALNACT1, MAN1C1), and others (BCL2A1, CDRT1, SYNE1).

Existing drugs with possible anti-COVID-19 indication derived
from knowledge of drugs' modes of action and COVID-19
pathogenesis
The Metacore and IPA databases were searched using ENSEMBL IDs for the
abovementioned 283 protein targets. Fifteen DEGs (with information on COVID-19
pathogenesis) were related to 46 FDA approved or clinical trial drugs (with data on drugs’ modes
of action) (Table S4), supporting their potential candidate nature against SARS-CoV-2. Three of
these 15 targets - ALPL (drug: zinc sulfate), CXCL8 (drug: BMS-986253), IL6 (drug:
clazakizumab, siltuximab, tocilizumab) are currently under clinical trial for COVID-19. This
supports the ability of our approach to identify anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs and suggests its
potential to discover novel anti-COVID-19 indications for existing drugs. We also identified 35
drugs targeting ALPL, CXCL8, and IL6 that were not previously tested against COVID-19
symptoms and could be repurposed for anti-SARS-CoV-2 management. We additionally found 4
potential targets (CCL20, CSF3, CXCL1, CXCL10) with 6 existing drugs that could be
repurposed for the treatment of COVID-19. Eight further targets (CXCL6, IFI44, IFI44L,
RSAD2, S100A8, SPRR2A, SYNE1, XAF1) associated with COVID-19 pathogenesis were
identified, but drugs of any therapies that are either approved for another indication or being
studied in a clinical trial.

Computational ranking of drug targets based on functional
similarity and topological features in protein- protein interaction to
SARS-CoV pathology genes
We subsequently implemented publicly available online gene ranking algorithms to
prioritize the anti-SARS-CoV-2 targets to find out which of the drugs targeting 15 genes are the
most reliable. An extensive search through OMIM literature was performed to identify reliable
training genes for the SARS-CoVs infection pathology. We found 4 genes (training genes) that
are directly associated with SARS-CoVs pathology (ACE2; Gene MIM number 300335,
AGTR1; Gene MIM number 106165, DPP4; Gene MIM number 102720, TMPRSS2; Gene MIM
number 602060). TopGene has generated a similarity score for each annotation of each test gene
by comparing to the enriched terms in the training set of genes. The final prioritized gene list is
then computed based on the aggregated values of all similarity scores (Table 2, Table S5).
Another online gene ranking algorithm, ToppNet has mapped training and test set genes to
protein-protein interaction network. Scoring and ranking of test set genes based on relative
location to all of the training set genes using global network-distance measures in the proteinprotein interaction network (PPIN) (Table 2, Table S5). CXCL10 was the topmost prioritized
target with the maximum score analyzed by ToppGene and ToppNet. CXCL10 is involved in the
regulation of inflammatory and immune responses (Figure 4) and may be a potential candidate
target for treating COVID-19 related lung pathology.

COVID-19-related lung pathology.

Discussion
Despite the growing understanding of the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 pathology,
interventions for treatment of COVID-19 are limited. Most importantly, the identity of critical
targets in infected cells that can be modulated in the early/middle stage of disease are not well
known. Such interventions could blunt the development of more severe symptoms,
hospitalization and death. In the current study, we performed a quantitative meta-analysis of
three independent RNA-Seq studies to identify SARS-CoV-2-triggered genes in the
transcriptome of human respiratory epithelial cells. Data mining and subsequent extension of
bioinformatics analysis of RNA-Seq data revealed 283 DEGs, 15 of which are the target of 48
existing drugs, which could be repurposed for the treatment of COVID-19. Three of these 15
targets IL6, ALPL, and CXCL8 are currently being studied as therapies for hospitalized COVID19 patients (Table 2). Our drug discovery pipeline suggested an additional 35 existing drugs
(Table S4) targeting these molecules that can be repurposed. Importantly, our meta-analysis
identified 4 potential novel targets (CCL20, CSF3, CXCL1, CXCL10) associated with COVID19 pathogenesis, targeted by 6 existing drugs that have not been studied in clinical trials for
treatment of COVID-19 and could be repurposed. An additional 8 targets (CXCL6, IFI44,
IFI44L, RSAD2, S100A8, SPRR2A, SYNE1, XAF1) are associated with COVID-19
pathogenesis, but do not have therapies targeting them available for potential repurposing. The
list of 283 SARS-CoV-2-related proteins could be useful not only as potential anti-COVID-19
targets, but could also be considered COVID-19 biomarkers of disease progression and/or
response to therapy.
The interaction network among these 283 gene points to core hub genes that could be
responsible for altered molecular and cellular functions 'cell movement', 'cell death & survival'
and 'cell signaling/proliferation' associated with enriched diseases 'infection' and 'inflammatory
response' following SARS-CoV-2 infection in airway epithelium. Inflammatory response in viral
infection is a double-edged sword: Although inflammation is necessary to orchestrate the

recruitment and coordination of immune cells at the infection site, over-stimulation of the
inflammatory response results in a surge in cytokines and could culminate into secondary injury
or destruction of the respiratory epithelium. Our IPA analysis showed that activation of cytokines
IL6, IL16, CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL5, CXCL6, CXCL8, CXCL10, and CCL20 are a hallmark
signature of cytokine response in COVID-19 patients [17,18]. We also found increased levels of
key pro-apoptotic factors like BCL2A1, LTF, SOX6, SPP1, and SYNE1. Li et al. has recently
detected apoptosis in bronchial and lung epithelial cells during the initial exudative phase (day 24 post infection) of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humanized ACE2 transgenic mice [19]. These proapoptotic factors could represent key nodes associated with epithelial cell death and subsequent
diffuse alveolar damage (a critical feature of acute lung injury). Further, canonical pathway
analysis suggested an enriched 'IL17 signaling' pathway. IL17 family cytokine levels are
associated with respiratory viral infections [20]. It regulates key inflammatory cytokines like
CSF3, TNFα, IL6, IL-1β, CXCL10, IL-8, MIP2A, MMPs that control granulopoiesis and
recruitment of neutrophils, fever, chemoattraction, and tissue damage and remodeling [21].
There is a growing body of evidence supporting the role of IL17 in COVID-19 pathogenesis
[20,22]. However, further investigation is needed to characterize the role of IL17 blockade in the
management of COVID-19. Several existing drugs targeting IL17 could be tested for COVID-19
therapies (e.g. secukinumab [approved for arthritis, psoriasis, spondylitis], ABY-035 [for
psoriasis;

NCT02690142],

BCD-085

[for

arthritis;

NCT03598751,

for

spondylitis;

NCT03447704; for psoriasis; NCT03390101], bimekizumab [for arthritis; NCT04009499],
CJM112 [for hidradenitis suppurativa; NCT02421172]).
We further used globally accepted ranking algorithms to prioritize the drug targets. These
algorithms analyzed the targets' functional and topological similarity to established COVID-19
pathogenesis genes and both scored CXCL10 the highest priority drug target. CXCL10 has been
implicated in SARS-CoV [23] and other viral infections such as rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial
virus (RSV), Coxsackie virus, hepatitis virus B and C, Ebola, dengue (DENV), and equine
infectious anemia virus (EIAV) [24]. Ichikawa et al. have shown that mice deficient in CXCL10
or its receptor CXCR3 have decreased lung injury severity and increased survival after viral and
non-viral lung injury [25]. CXCL10 levels were positively correlated with the extent of organ
damage and pathogen burden [26]. Interestingly, increased levels of CXCL10 were found in
plasma samples of patients with COVID-19 who died [17]. Furthermore, Chua et al. have

assessing the use of serial CXCL10 measurement as a clinical decision support for patients with
COVID-19 recently completed enrollment (NCT04389645) supporting the notion that this may
be an actionable target in this patient population.
One possible CXCL10 targeting therapy is Eldelumab. Eldelumab (MDX-1100 or BMS936557) is a fully humanized antibody (type IgG1 kappa developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb and
Medarex) targeting CXCL10 [28] that is being studied as a therapy for multiple autoimmune and
autoinflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (NCT01017367), ulcerative colitis
(NCT00656890, NCT01294410), and Crohn's disease (NCT01466374). It is hypothesized that
by binding to CXCL10, eldelumab blocks immune cell migration into the epithelium and
modulates the impact of CXCL10 on epithelial cell survival [29]. The safety profile seems
favorable, with the most commonly reported treatment-related adverse event being a mild to
moderate headache (5% patients) with 10 or 20 mg/kg (intravenous infusion) doses [30], though
the optimal treatment dose and safety profile would need to be investigated specifically in the
COVID-19 patient population.
Fenofibrate is another therapy that may reduce CXCL10 activity and is hypothesized to
have therapeutic activity in inflammatory diseases like Crohn's disease [31]. Fenofibrate may
also decrease the expression of other cytokines (IL17, CCL2, and CCL20) implicated in COVID19 pathology [31]. As a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) agonist,
fenofibrate may also prevents phospholipid accumulation within SARS-CoV-2 infected cells,
blocking viral replication [32]. It may also suppress microvascular inflammation and apoptosis
through inhibition of nuclear factor-κB and activation of adenosine monophosphate (AMP)activated protein kinase [33], suggesting the fenofibrate may further have favorable systemic
anti-inflammatory and endothelial effects.
In conclusion, systematic analyses of the SARS-CoV-2 triggered gene signature in
airway epithelium revealed 15 protein targets linked to 46 existing drugs. This include 35 drugs
modifying the activity of molecules already being studied as therapeutic targets for COVID-19
disease (IL6, ALPL, CXCL8 targets) and which could likely be repurposed for a similar aim.
Our study also found 4 additional targets (CCL20, CSF3, CXCL1, CXCL10) with existing

therapies that have yet to be trialed in the COVID-19 patient population. CXCL10 appears to be
a particular strong candidate based on high target scores and the availability of two existing
drugs inhibiting the action of this cytokine. Our study has several limitations. This investigation
is based on in vitro RNA-Seq data, resulting in an under-appreciation of significant inter-cellular
signaling that may occur differently in the human body. Furthermore, our computational
approach is limited as a tool for evaluating drugs to be repurposed because most available
computational tools are used for small molecule drugs only. However, given the pressing need
for effective targeted therapies for the treatment of COVID-19, further studies are crucially
needed to experimentally validate these results and, if promising, rapidly transition to clinical
trials.
