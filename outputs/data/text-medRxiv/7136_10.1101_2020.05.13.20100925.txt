Abstract
The SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the pandemic COVID-19 in infected individuals, who can
either exhibit mild symptoms or progress towards a life-threatening acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS). It is known that exacerbated inflammation and dysregulated immune responses
involving T and myeloid cells occur in COVID-19 patients with severe clinical progression.
However, the differential contribution of specific subsets of dendritic cells and monocytes to
ARDS is still poorly understood. In addition, the role of CD8+ T cells present in the lung of
COVID-19 patients and relevant for viral control has not been characterized. With the aim to
improve the knowledge in this area, we developed a cross-sectional study, in which we have
studied the frequencies and activation profiles of dendritic cells and monocytes present in the blood
of COVID-19 patients with different clinical severity in comparison with healthy control
individuals. Furthermore, these subpopulations and their association with antiviral effector CD8+
T cell subsets were also characterized in lung infiltrates from critical COVID-19 patients.
Collectively, our results suggest that inflammatory transitional and non-classical monocytes
preferentially migrate from blood to lungs in patients with severe COVID-19. CD1c+ conventional
dendritic cells also followed this pattern, whereas CD141+ conventional and CD123hi plasmacytoid
dendritic cells were depleted from blood but were absent in the lungs. Thus, this study increases
the knowledge on the pathogenesis of COVID-19 disease and could be useful for the design of
therapeutic strategies to fight SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Single-sentence summary: Depletion from the blood and differential activation patterns of
inflammatory monocytes and CD1c+ conventional dendritic cells associate with development of
ARDS in COVID-19 patients.

Introduction
The new SARS-CoV-2 virus causing the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), has unleashed
the current pandemic. Individuals infected with this pathogen can either remain asymptomatic or
progress from mild to severe clinical conditions that include the acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS) and death. Analytical parameters such as high concentrations of IL-6 and acute
phase reactants in plasma correlate with the development of severe symptoms in COVID-19
patients (1, 2), suggesting dysregulated immune responses in these individuals. Indeed, a cytokine
storm-related syndrome has been proposed as a trigger of ARDS (3, 4) and in accordance,
treatments to control inflammatory cytokine signaling are being used to reduce mortality of
COVID-19 patients (5, 6). However, it is unknown whether specific subsets of innate and adaptive
immune cells could be differentially contributing to a dysregulated immune response underlying
the development of ARDS in COVID-19. The most recent studies indicate that immune exhaustion
of effector T lymphocytes and altered humoral responses (7-9), combined with alterations in
myeloid cells like monocytes (10, 11) might be related to increased inflammation and contribute
to disease progression in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Dendritic cells (DC) are a heterogeneous
lineage of antigen presenting cells (APC), which includes different subsets of CD123hi
plasmacytoid DCs (pDC) and conventional (cDC) CD1c+ and CD141+ DCs. These innate cells are
critical for activation of adaptive CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses, and are key players in the
immune responses to viral and bacterial infections (12-16). A second important player in the
immune response against pathogens are monocytes (Mo), which can be subdivided in immature
classical (CD14++CD16-, C) and more differentiated inflammatory transitional (CD14+CD16+, T)
and non-classical (CD14-CD16++, NC) subsets. Altered homeostasis of these specific populations
has been linked to chronic inflammation and autoimmunity (17-19). Therefore, it is critical to

assess in depth myeloid cell populations in COVID-19 to generate new knowledge that may
contribute to the development of effective specific treatments. Additionally, it is important to better
understand adaptive antiviral responses potentially present in COVID-19 patients, and how they
might be associated with altered myeloid cells. Recent studies suggest that exhausted CD4+ T cell
responses might be dysregulated in COVID-19 patients (20), but less is known about antiviral
CD8+ T cells, which could be important for virus control. Assessment of a small number of
COVID-19 patients suggests that CD8+ T cells infiltrate lungs during the course of the disease, but
little information is available about which specific effector subsets are recruited (9). Therefore, an
integrative view of the myeloid and lymphoid populations altered in peripheral blood and lung
tissue of the patients and their association to the severity of COVID-19, is clearly needed. In the
present study, we contribute to this aim by analyzing the frequencies and activation profiles of
different DC and Mo subsets present in the blood of COVID-19 patients with different levels of
clinical severity and by identifying cell subsets associated with protection or disease progression.
Moreover, we have characterized inflammatory Mo and DC subsets as well as effector CD8+ T
lymphocytes that are specifically recruited to the lung during progressive ARDS.

Results
Inflammatory patterns and severity define subgroups of COVID-19 patients.
Our aim is to evaluate the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in circulating myeloid populations.
To this end, we followed a cross-sectional study strategy (See STROBE flow chart, Fig. S1) and
collected peripheral blood samples from a total of n=64 individuals with COVID-19 (Median age
61 (min-max, 22-89), 57% male; 95% receiving treatment) who were recruited after a median of
3 days (0-25) upon admission (Table S1). For comparison purposes, 22 healthy donors were
included in the study (Table S1). To correlate particular profiles of frequencies and activation of
peripheral blood inflammatory cells and the severity of the disease, we stratified our cohort of
COVID-19 patients into 3 groups of mild (G1), severe (G2) and critical (G3) disease, following
recently described criteria (21). Their demographic and clinical characteristics are summarized in
Table S1 and Table S2. As shown in Fig. S1 and in agreement with previous studies (2), we
observed a significant and progressive decrease of PaO2/FiO2 (PaFiO2) (p<0.0001 for G1 vs G3)
and increase of plasma IL-6 (p<0.0001 for G1 vs G3) and other inflammatory parameters such as
Procalcitonin (PCT, p=0.0008 G1 vs G3) and C Reactive Protein (CRP, p<0.0001 G1 vs G3) that
was correlated with COVID-19 severity (Fig. S1).

Differential redistribution of myeloid cell subsets in the blood of COVID-19 patients is associated
with severity.
To evaluate the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in circulating myeloid populations, we next
examined whether specific myeloid subsets could be differentially altered in the three groups of
COVID-19 patients and associated with disease progression. Using a multi-color flow cytometry
panel, we determined the frequencies of the following circulating myeloid cell subsets: C Mo, T

Mo, NC Mo, granulocytes, CD1c+ and CD141+cDC and CD123hi pDC (for gating strategy, see
Fig. S2). Using a tSNE tool, we were able to observe differences in mononuclear myeloid cells
distribution based on the abundance of cell populations between COVID-19 and healthy control
individuals (Fig.1A left). A more detailed analysis suggested that these changes were due to
alterations on specific myeloid subsets in COVID-19 individuals (Fig.1A, right). An individual
analysis of each myeloid subset in blood showed a significant reduction of almost all circulating
myeloid cell subsets when considering all COVID-19 patients (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, certain
myeloid populations were more significantly affected in the different patient subgroups. In
particular, CD123hi pDC and CD141+ cDCs were significantly diminished in the three patient
groups, suggesting a disease- rather than severity-related impact on these cells (Fig. 1B). On the
other hand, the decrease of CD1c+ cDCs, and C and NC Mo was more pronounced in severe G2
and critical G3 COVID-19 patients and therefore indicating an association with severity (Fig. 1B).
In contrast, T Mo followed a completely different pattern, since they were significantly increased
in mild G1 COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls but dramatically decreased in critical
G3 COVID-19 patients (Fig.1B). Moreover, T Mo/CD1c+ cDCs ratios were higher in G1 and G2
patients with less severe disease progression (Fig. S2C). In addition, big sized CD14- CD16hi
HLADR- granulocytes were increased in G1 and G2, but not G3 COVID-19 subgroups; and higher
ratios of these cells relative to CD1c+ DCs were specifically increased in severe G2 patients
(Fig.S2B-2C). Alterations in frequencies of specific myeloid populations have been related to
clinical parameters associated with COVID-19 severity (2). Our analyses revealed that higher
frequencies of circulating C, T and NC Mo (Fig. 1C) and CD141+ cDCs (Fig. S3B) were
moderately correlated with higher levels of blood oxygenation. Importantly, depletion of C and T
Mo from the blood correlated most significantly with higher plasma levels of inflammatory

markers such as PCT, CRP and in the case of C and T Mo, with higher IL-6 (Fig. 1C-D, Fig.S3A).
Similar trends were observed for cDC (Fig. S3A), while no significant association was observed
for granulocytes (Fig. S3B). On the other hand, depletion of inflammatory NC Mo in COVID-19
did not associate with IL-6 plasma levels (Fig.S3A). Together, these data indicate that frequencies
of C, T and NC Mo and CD1c+ cDCs are preferentially reduced in the blood during severe disease
progression and these populations are differentially correlated with inflammatory markers.

Activation profiles in circulating monocytes versus dendritic cells from mild, severe and critical
COVID-19 patients
We next sought to determine whether the activation state of DCs and Mo subsets was different in
the subgroups of COVID-19 patients. Our previous tSNE analysis involved redistribution of cell
populations considering both frequencies and expression of the maturation marker CD40, which
has been linked to cellular activation and the expression of IL-6 cytokine (22, 23). As shown in
Fig.2A, tSNE distribution of CD40 expression was restricted to specific myeloid cell populations
while other cells seemed to have downregulated this molecule on COVID-19 patients (Fig. 2A).
When CD40 expression levels were analyzed within each myeloid cell subset in total and stratified
COVID-19 patients, we observed again differences associated with disease severity in some
populations (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, CD40 expression tended to be lower in all Mo subsets from
G3 patients, but most significantly on T and NC Mo (Fig. 2B). In contrast, no significant changes
in CD40 expression were observed for CD1c+ and CD141+ cDC, while a mild downregulation of
CD40 occurred on pDC (Fig. S4A). Remarkably, we observed no significant or weak associations
of CD40 expression in cDCs or Mo subsets with plasma IL-6 and PCT levels with the frequency

of these subsets in the blood (Fig.S4B-D). Therefore, these data highlight a differential relationship
of innate activation and migration between T and NC Mo versus cDC in COVID-19 patients.

Inflammatory transitional and non-classic Mo are enriched and activated in bronchoscopy
infiltrates from COVID-19 patients with ARDS.
Based on these data, we postulated that recruitment to the lung and activation of Mo and DC
subsets might be different in COVID-19 patients developing severe disease and ARDS. Most
studies analyzing inflammatory cell populations in the lung have used bronchoalveolar lavage
(BAL) samples, since they are most representative of deep alveolar structure (24-26). However,
clinical features of COVID-19 patients requiring artificial respiratory support make it difficult to
collect enough BAL samples to assess significant differences in immune cell subsets. Hence, we
assessed the proportions of CD45+ leukocytes (Fig. S5A) and their subsets (see strategy of flow
cytometry gating in Fig. S5B) in dense bronchoscopy samples routinely obtained to allow patient
ventilation. No significant differences in clinical parameters were observed in bronchoscopy
samples with different levels of hematopoietic cell infiltrates (Fig.S5A, bottom). Remarkably,
these cell distribution patterns were very similar to those observed in the few cases where a BAL
sample could be obtained in parallel (Fig. S5B). Using this approach, a significant enrichment of
granulocytes (which represented the vast majority of the leukocytes in those samples, FigS5B-5C),
CD16hi CD14lo/- HLA-DR+ cells (Fig.S5B-5C) and inflammatory T and NC Mo was observed
(Fig.3A). In contrast, C Mo and CD1c+ DCs were also enriched but made up a very low percentage
of the bronchoscopy samples. No pDCs or CD141+ cDCs were found in bronchoscopy infiltrates.
In addition, analysis of paired blood and lung samples demonstrated that T and NC Mo, and CD1c+
cDCs were specifically enriched in the lung (Fig. 3B). Similar enrichment patterns were observed

with granulocytes (Fig. S5D). Importantly, myeloid cells infiltrated in the lung expressed higher
levels of CD40 than their circulating counterparts (Fig.3C). In the lung, we observed increasing
expression of CD40 on C, T and NC Mo. The latter represented the myeloid cell subset expressing
the highest levels of CD40 compared to CD1c+ cDC as well (Fig. 3D). In addition, levels of CD40
on NC Mo correlated with higher CRP within this group of critical COVID-19 patients (Fig. 3E).
Together, these data indicate preferential enrichment inflammatory Mo in the lung and contrasting
maturation profiles between infiltrated NC Mo compared to T Mo and CD1c+ cDCs.

Effector CD8+ T cell populations in the lung of COVID-19 patients: Association with inflammatory
Mo subsets and CD1c+ DC
To better understand the contribution of CD1c+ and inflammatory Mo to either disease progression
or protective antiviral immunity in COVID-19 patients, we studied the presence of infiltrating
effector T cells in bronchoscopy samples. We did not observe any significant increase of T cells
or changes in the ratios of CD4+/CD8+ T cells in the lung as compared to blood (Fig. S6A).
Expression of CD38 and CXCR5 in CD8+ T cells has been previously linked to effector function
and immune exhaustion during viral infections (Fig. 4A) (27, 28). Next we analyzed expression of
these activation markers in circulating CD8+ T cells finding a significant enrichment of activated
CD38+ CD8+ T cells, more significantly those that co-expressed CXCR5 in bronchoscopies from
critical COVID-19 patients requiring IMV (Fig. 4B, Fig.S6B). Of note, CD38+ CXCR5+ and CD8+
T cells was the only subset that was significantly altered compared to both paired blood in COVID19 patients and to blood from healthy individuals (Fig.4B). Finally, we assessed whether
frequencies or activation status of inflammatory Mo and CD1c+ cDCs could be associated with
any of these effector CD8+ T cell subsets. Interestingly, we observed that higher ratios of

inflammatory T and NC Mo/CD1c+ cDCs were negatively associated with proportions of CXCR5+
CD38+ CD8+ T cells, suggesting a detrimental role of more preferential infiltration of
inflammatory Mo versus DC during disease progression (Fig. S6C). In addition, levels of CD40
levels in T Mo but no other myeloid cells in the lung were positively associated with proportions
of infiltrated CD38+ (both CXCR5+ and CXCR5-) CD8+ T cells (Fig. 4C; Fig. S6D).

Discussion
In this study, associations of specific Mo and DC subsets with disease progression in COVID-19
patients are established. Our results indicate that increased proportions of transitional Mo in the
blood could be used as a marker of viral control or mild clinical condition in infected patients. In
contrast, dramatic decrease of T and NC Mo and CD1c+ DC is associated with severe clinical
outcomes in COVID-19 patients. In addition, our study shows that reduction of frequencies of T
and NC Mo in the blood is associated with increased IL-6, and inflammatory markers such as PCT,
CRP; this reduction is also associated with the selective recruitment to the lung of these
populations and CD1c+ cDCs during the development of ARDS. On the other hand, increased
activation of NC Mo and defective maturation of T Mo might be associated with uncontrolled
inflammation in the lung and the activation of effector CD8+ T cells. Therefore, our data highlight
differential involvement of myeloid cell subsets in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 disease and
immunity against SARS-Co-V2 virus. Although these data provide novel cellular insights into the
pathogenesis of severe COVID-19, future studies will need to focus on mechanisms responsible
for these altered cellular patterns. In this regard, recent single-cell transcriptomic analyses on
inflammatory infiltrates in the lung of COVID-19 patients suggest the altered expression of genes
coding for proinflammatory cytokines and/or interferons-associated and interferon-stimulated
proteins that have been previously associated with the activation of antibacterial innate pathways
(10).
Our data indicate that a large proportion of COVID-19 individuals from the critical G3 group
developing ARDS and requiring Invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), were superinfected with
bacteria or candida at the time of sample collection. While these superinfections were mostly
detected after the initiation of IMV, the majority of critical G3 COVID-19 patients exhibited high

levels of PCT upon admission, a parameter commonly associated with bacterial infection (29) and
also an indicator of inflammation and severe COVID-19 prognosis (2). Therefore, it is possible
that COVID-19 patients might be more susceptible to microbial superinfection early or during ICU
treatment and this could contribute to changes in inflammation, migration and homeostasis of
myeloid cells from COVID-19 patients specifically undergoing severe disease progression. If this
was the case, the simultaneous activation of antiviral and antibacterial innate recognition pathways
could be a potential mechanism that might contribute to uncontrolled inflammation and immune
exhaustion in these individuals, similarly to what has been described in HIV+ individuals coinfected with mycobacterium tuberculosis and developing immune reconstitution inflammatory
syndrome (IRIS) (30). However, further research is required to specifically address this issue.
Novel information about critical cell subsets participating in the pathogenesis of COVID-19,
significant sample size and the availability of healthy non-COVID-19 controls as reference group
are strengths of our research. However, a number of limitations need to be discussed. This is a
cross-sectional study design comparing severe COVID-19 patients, with two sets of controls: on
the one hand mild/severe COVID-19 patients; and on the other hand non-COVID-19 healthy
controls. Because of this cross-sectional nature any assessment of progression will require a
confirmation in prospective follow-up studies. In addition, our study provides data on
bronchoscopy infiltrates rather than bronchoalveolar lavage given the fragile status of COVID-19
patients with ARDS. Although bronchoscopies might not necessarily reflect the characteristics of
infiltrates present in terminal bronchioles and alveoli, our data from two patients indicate that the
composition of myeloid cells in the infiltrates obtained by these methods are comparable. On the
other hand, our study did not directly address the protective versus detrimental function of DC
during COVID-19 infection. In this sense, CD141+ cDCs are important for the priming of antiviral

CD8+ T cell responses (14, 31) and are dramatically depleted from the blood in all COVID-19
patients regardless of their clinical status, but they are almost completely undetectable in
bronchoscopy infiltrates from individuals developing severe ARDS. These data might support a
defect on the priming, the maintenance or exhaustion of virus-specific CD8+ T cells in the lungs;
however these issues must be investigated in depth. In addition, CD1c+ cDCs are known to support
CD4+ T cell responses and stimulate follicular helper T cells required for effective humoral
antiviral adaptive immunity (13). While it has been proposed that protection against SARS-CoV2 might also be at least partially mediated by specific antibodies (32), the role of CD1c+ DCs
inducing Tfh responses in these patients has not been addressed in our study and requires further
research.
To conclude, our study unveils immune cellular networks associated with control or progression
of COVID-19 disease, which might be useful for early diagnosis, and the design of new more
targeted and individualized treatments. Eventually, further research on these mechanisms may
lead to the development of new therapeutic or preventive strategies.

Material and Methods

Study patient cohort and samples.
A total of 64 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 after testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by
qPCR were included in the study. As specified in Supplemental Table 1, 95% of patients initiated
different treatments upon hospital admission. Our cohort of COVID-19 patients was stratified into
3 groups of mild (G1), severe (G2) and critical (G3) prognosis based on respiratory frequency
(RF), blood oxygen saturation (StO2), partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired
oxygen ratio (PaFiO2) and respiratory failure values as well as by following recently described
criteria (21).
Blood samples were obtained for all participants and directly used for analysis without prior ficoll
gradient centrifugation, to avoid the depletion of polymorphonuclear cells.
Of note, critical G3 patients from which blood (n=24) and/or bronchoscopy samples (n=23) were
collected displayed 85.71% and 100% of microbial superinfection at the time of sample collection,
respectively. The majority of superinfections in these patients were observed 6 days after ICU
admission and IMV support (89% from blood and 100% from bronchoscopy samples) and were
caused by either only bacteria (68.75% from blood and 65% from bronchoscopy samples) or only
fungi (25% from blood and 30% from bronchoscopy samples) or both types of parthogens (6.25%
from blood and 5% from bronchoscopy samples) (Table S2).
Flexible bronchoscopy procedures were conducted in all ICU patients under sedation and muscle
relaxation. This technique enables the visualization of the lumen and mucosa of the trachea, and
also of the proximal and distal airways. Flexible bronchoscopy is indicated to evaluate pneumonia,
to asses infiltrates of unclear etiology, to aspirate secretions, and to prevent development of

atelectasis and pneumonia associated with invasive ventilation. Furthermore, in patients suspected
of having pneumonia or infections, microbiological specimen can be collected with bronchial
washings. Bronchial washings consist of aspirating bronchial secretions directly or after instilling
physiological serum. We did not employ local anesthetic to avoid sample alterations.
Bronchoalveolar lavage can also be performed in pneumonia patients. Nevertheless, this technique
entails a high risk for patients with severe respiratory failure. This is true specially for patients
with high oxygen concentration requirements such as COVID pneumonia patients. Therefore, we
performed bronchoalveolar lavage solely in two cases (33). Finally, the hematopoietic lung
infiltrates were obtained from bronchoscopy samples diluted in 0.9% sodium chloride at a 1: 5
ratio and after three sequential centrifugations at 1500 rpm during 10 minutes.

Flow cytometry reagents and data analysis.
For phenotypical studies of cell populations present in peripheral whole blood, cells were
incubated with a panel of different combinations of the following monoclonal antibodies: antihuman CD3-Pacific blue and PerCP-Cy5.5, CD19, CD56 PerCP-Cy5.5-, CD8-APC-Cy7,
CXCR5-PE, CD14-PE, CD16-Pacific Blue, CD40-FITC, HLA-DR-APC-Cy7 and -APC, CD11cPacific Blue, CD1c-PE-Cy7, CD141-APC (Biolegend) and CD38-FITC, CD123-APC, CD20PerCP_Cy5.5 and HLA-DR-APC (BD Becton Dickinson) for 30 min. Subsequently, whole blood
cells were treated with BD FACS Lysing Solution for 15 min, centrifuged and finally resuspended
in PBS 1X (LONZA) and analyzed using a BD FACSCanto II flow cytometer (BD Becton
Dickinson). The gating strategy for myeloid cells is shown in Fig. S2: CD1c+ and CD141+ cDC
subsets were identified from as Linage negative (CD3- CD19- CD20- CD56-) negative, CD14HLA-DR+ differing on exclusive expression of CD1c and CD141 (panel I). Plasmacytoid DCs

defined on the basis of CD14 and CD16 expression levels. Granulocytes were identified as large
CD14lo/-CD16hi HLADR- cells. Maturation status of myeloid cells was defined based on CD40
mean fluorescence intensity (MFI). In the case of bronchoscopy samples from critical COVID-19
patients, we added anti-CD45-Pacific Orange mAbs (BioLegend) to the previously described
antibody cocktails and performed an additional panel to analyze frequencies and distribution of
CD3+ CD8+ and CD4+ T cell subsets defined by expression of CD38 and CXCR5 or HLA-DR,
respectively. Individual and multiparametric analysis of flow cytometry data was performed using
flowJo software (Tree Star) and tSNE.

Statistical Analysis.
Quantitative variables were represented as median and interquartile range. Statistical differences
between different cell populations or between patient cohorts between was calculated using a nonparametric two-tailed Mann Whitney test, or using a Kruskal wallis test followed by a multiple
comparisons, as appropriate. Significant differences of paired analyses were calculated using a
two-tailed Wilcoxon matched pairs test and a Bonferroni multiple comparison correction when
possible. Association between cellular and clinical parameters was calculated using nonparametric Spearman correlations. Statistical significance was set a p<0.05. Statistical analyses
were performed using the GrapPad Prism 8 Sofware.

Fig. S2. Flow cytometry characterization of myeloid cell subsets from COVID-19 patients.
(A): Flow cytometry gating strategy showing Monocyte (Mo), conventional (cDC) and
plasmacytoid DC (pDC) and granulocyte characterization in the blood from a representative
patient of our study cohorts. CD14+ Lineage (CD3- CD19- CD20- CD56-) negative Mo subsets
were defined by CD14 and CD16 expression levels. Granulocytes were identified as large CD16hi
CD14lo/- HLADR- cells. cDC subsets were identified as CD14- Lin- HLA-DR+ big cells differing
on CD1c and CD141 expression. Finally, pDCs were defined as CD14-Lin-CD11c- HLADR+
CD123hi lymphocytes. (B-C): Proportions of granulocytes (B) and ratios of frequencies between
Transitional Mo/CD1c+ cDC and Granulocyte/ CD1c+ cDCs (C) present in the blood of healthy
individuals compared with either total COVID-19 patients included in the study or patients
stratified into mild (G1), severe (SEV, G2) and critical (CRIT, G3). Statistical differences between
patient groups were calculated using a non-parametric two tailed Mann Witney test (black) or a
Kruskal Wallis test followed by a Dunn´s post hoc-test for multiple comparisons (red). *p<0.05;

Fig. S4. Correlation between activation status of myeloid cell subsets and frequencies in the
blood and IL-6 plasma levels. (A): CD40 Mean of fluorescence intensity (MFI) on the indicated
myeloid cell populations present in the blood of healthy individuals versus either total COVID-19
patients included in the study or patients stratified in mild (G1), severe (SEV, G2) and critical
(CRIT, G3) clinical characteristics specified in Table S1. (B-C): Spearman correlation between
CD40 MFI on the indicated myeloid cell subsets and their frequency in blood (B) or IL-6 plasma
levels (C). Spearman P and R values are shown in the upper right corner of the plot. Statistical
significance of each cell subset between each patient subgroup was tested using a two tailed Mann
Whitney test. (D): Spearman correlations between procalcitonin (PCT) levels in plasma and CD40
mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) on CD1c+ cDCs,classical (C), transitional (T) and non-classical
(NC) Mo. Spearman P and R values are shown in the upper right corner of the plot.

Fig. S5. Characterization of myeloid cells present in bronchoscopy infiltrates from COVID19 patients with ARDS. (A): Proportions of CD45+ hematopoietic cells present in bronchoscopy
samples obtained from COVID-19 patients (n=23) with severe ARDS and requiring IMV at
hospital´s ICU. Associations with clinical parameters in samples with frequencies of CD45+
hematopoietic cell superior or inferior to 50% are shown below. (B): Flow cytometry analyses of
myeloid cell subsets hematopoietic infiltrates from bronchoscopy compared with bronchoalveolar
lavage (BAL) from the same COVID-19 severe patient. Two representative examples are shown.
(C): Percentages of the indicated cell populations in the hematopoietic CD45+ infiltrate present in
bronchoscopy mucus samples from severe COVID-19 patients (n=23) presenting ARDS and
receiving IMV at ICU. Statistical differences between proportions of cell populations within the
same infiltrates were calculated using a two-tailed matched pairs Wilcoxon test. (D): Frequencies
of CD14lo/- CD16hi HLA-DR- granulocytes on the blood and paired bronchoscopy samples from
critical COVID-19 patients. Statistical differences were calculated using a two-tailed matched
pairs Wilcoxon test. **, p<0.01; ***;p<0.001.

Fig. S6. Characterization of effector CD8+ T cells present in bronchoscopy infiltrates from
COVID-19 patients with ARDS. (A-B): Percentages of total CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and
CD4+T/CD8+T ratios (A) or CXCR5+CD38+ (DP), CXCR5+ CD38- (CXCR5SP) and CXCR5CD38+ (CD38SP) (B) from CD8+ T cells in the blood and paired bronchoscopy samples from
COVID-19 patients with ARSD (n=15). Statistical significance was calculated using a two tailed
matched pairs Wilcoxon test for differences of the same populations between different tissue
localizations (black) or between different cell populations included within the blood (blue) or
within the bronchoscopy (pink) samples. (C-D): Spearman correlations between proportions of
CXCR5+CD38+, CXCR5+ CD38- and CXCR5- CD38+ subpopulations of CD8+ T cells from
bronchoscopy samples from COVID-19 patients and ratios of frequencies between Transitional
(T) or non-classic (NC) Mo versus CD1c+ cDCs (C) and CD40 MFI of the indicated myeloid
populations in bronchoscopy samples (D). Spearman P and R values are shown in the upper right
corner of the plot.
