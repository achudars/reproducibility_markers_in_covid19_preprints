Abstract
Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to widespread shortages of personal protective equipment
(PPE) for healthcare workers, including filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) such as N95 masks. These
masks are normally intended for single use, but their sterilization and subsequent reuse could substantially
mitigate a world-wide shortage.
Design: Quality assurance.
Setting: A sealed environment chamber installed in the animal facility of an academic medical center.
Interventions: One to five sterilization cycles using ionized hydrogen peroxide (iHP), generated by
SteraMist® equipment (TOMI; Frederick, MD).
Main outcome measures: Personal protective equipment, including five N95 mask models from three
manufacturers, were evaluated for efficacy of sterilization following iHP treatment (measured with bacterial
spores in standard biological indicator assemblies). Additionally, N95 masks were assessed for their ability
to efficiently filter particles down to 0.3µm and for their ability to form an airtight seal using a quantitative
fit test. Filtration efficiency was measured using ambient particulate matter at a university lab and an
aerosolized NaCl challenge at a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) precertification laboratory.
Results: The data demonstrate that N95 masks sterilized using SteraMist iHP technology retain function up
to five cycles, the maximum number tested to date. Some but not all PPE could also be sterilized using an
iHP environmental chamber, but pre-treatment with a handheld iHP generator was required for semienclosed surfaces such as respirator hoses.
Conclusions: A typical iHP environment chamber with a volume of ~80 m3 can treat ~7000 masks per day,
as well as other items of PPE, making this an effective approach for a busy medical center.
Keywords: COVID-19, personal protective equipment (PPE), ionized hydrogen peroxide, sterilization,

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has led to widespread shortages in personal protective equipment (PPE) for
clinicians and first responders. Shortages in filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) such as N95 “masks”, which
are certified to filter 95% of airborne particles down to 0.3 µm, are particularly problematic because these
normally single-use items are a mainstay of infection control. It has been widely reported that the US
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) anticipates a need for as many as 3.5 x 10 9 N95 masks1 in
2020 for US use alone, but estimates of total available supply are far short of that number 2. The consequent
need for N95 mask sterilization and subsequent reuse is therefore likely to continue for the foreseeable future.
The possibility that disposable N95 masks could be sterilized and reused was raised 15 years ago as a strategy
to address shortages arising from medical emergencies,3–5 but with the exception of a single FDA-funded
study by the Battelle Memorial Institute,6 little subsequent research was performed on the topic. Recently, in
response to acute N95 mask shortages, multiple strategies for mask sterilization have been proposed and
studied, including exposure to ultraviolet (UV) germicidal irradiation, vaporized hydrogen peroxide, moist
heat, ethylene oxide, and gamma irradiation7–14. In this study, we evaluate a recently developed technology,
ionized hydrogen peroxide (iHP), as a method for sterilizing N95 masks and other PPE.
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a powerful sterilizing agent that can be used on porous and other surfaces
following vaporization or ionization to create a mist containing hydroxyl radicals. Such vaporized or ionized
hydrogen peroxide methods (VHP/iHP) are widely used for environmental sterilization across multiple
industries including food preparation, healthcare, and life sciences14–19. VHP/iHP methods can be used on a
wider range of sensitive materials than high temperature methods (e.g. autoclaving) and are safer than ethylene
oxide methods. Four distinct VHP/iHP-based H2O2 sterilization technologies that have been commercialized
to date are shown in Table 1, each of which involves a different approach to generating and delivering the
sterilant. In all cases microbial killing is achieved through the reaction of hydroxyl radicals with proteins,
nucleic acids and other biomolecules in pathogens. Three VHP-based systems have received emergency use
authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for N95 mask decontamination20, even
though relatively limited peer-reviewed data is available8, particularly from non-commercial third parties. As

a consequence, it is difficult for infection control teams in hospitals and other healthcare providers to evaluate
these systems. The absence of data on the post-sterilization performance of different makes and models of
N95 masks is also limiting. The Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH; Boston MA) Incident Command,
which is involved in this study, currently has on hand over 30 models of N95 masks from three manufacturers.
This study focuses on the use of iHP as an N95 mask sterilization method, specifically the SteraMist
Binary Ionization Technology® (BIT) from TOMI (Beverly Hills, CA). iHP was registered with the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 2015 for use in health care, life sciences, food safety, and other
settings (appearing on EPA lists G, H, K, L, and M). Most recently it was added to EPA List N: Disinfectants
for Use Against SARS-CoV-2, for use on hard, nonporous surfaces21. The active ingredient in iHP is 7.8%
aqueous H2O2 (an H2O2 concentration 5 times lower than used in commercial VHP systems), which is flowed
past a plasma arc and dispersed into a treatment chamber as a mist of micron-sized liquid droplets. As it
passes through the plasma, the hydrogen peroxide is ionized into reactive hydroxyl radicals, the active
sterilant. iHP is commercially available in two implementations: a handheld sprayer device (“Surface Unit”)
and an environmental unit (“Environment System”).
The environment system used in this study was installed at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI;
Boston, MA) animal research facility for use in sterilizing incoming equipment and materials. Following
cycles of sterilization, masks were tested for three critical features: (1) sterility, as measured by the inactivation
of bacterial spores contained in biological indicators; (2) filtration efficiency, measured both by aerosolized
75 nm NaCl particles and by 0.3-1 µm ambient particulate matter; and (3) fit, using a PortaCount quantitative
fit test apparatus. Multiple sterilization cycles were completed to assess mask durability. Sterilization of other
PPE items such as face shields and hoods and hoses for Powered-Air Purifying Respirators (PAPRs) was also
explored. Testing was performed at the DFCI, MIT and ICS Laboratories (a commercial laboratory accredited
to perform testing to NIOSH/ISO/IEC standards).

Methods
Selection of N95 respirators and other PPE samples
A total of 73 N95 masks representing five models from three manufacturers (3M 1860, KimberlyClark [KC]/Halyard 46767 “duckbill,” Gerson 2130, 3M 8210, and 3M 9210/37021) were selected for testing
as a representative sample of the N95 masks used in three local hospitals: Dana-Farber Cancer Institute,
Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and Boston Children’s Hospital. N95 masks of the same model available in
different sizes (for example, the 3M 1860 and the 3M 1860S, representing regular and small sizes) were
considered to be interchangeable for testing purposes. The total sample size was necessarily limited by existing
mask shortages and the importance of prioritizing the needs of healthcare workers; given the uniformity of the
results reported below the sample size was judged to be adequate.
Additionally, an assortment of other PPE and hospital equipment was selected for sterilization. This
included the following PAPR components: Sentinel® XL CBRN hood with hose, Sentinel® head cover hoods,
Sentinel® PAPR breathing tubes for use with Sentinel® XL HP PAPR (ILC Dover, Frederica, DE), and Bullard
RT Series PAPR hood (Bullard, Lexington, KY). Other equipment included two models of face shields, one
locally fabricated22 and the other a Fisherbrand™ Disposable Face Shield (Fisher Scientific, Waltham MA),
a DuPont Tyvek® 400 coverall (Wilmington, DE) (Supplementary Figure 1), an iPad (Apple, Cupertino
CA), and an iPad case. The iPad was included for testing since BWH is making them available to COVID-19
patients as a means of communicating with family members.
A first set of 30 N95 masks representing five different models was processed using the SteraMist
system for zero to five cycles, and then analyzed for single-pass filtration efficiency using ambient particulate
matter at MIT. A second set of 34 N95 masks was processed using the SteraMist system and sent to ICS
Laboratories (Brunswick, OH) for testing to an abbreviated (instantaneous only) or full loading NIOSH N-95
filtration efficiency protocol. Nine masks underwent a quantitative fit test at DFCI following sterilization.

Sterilization in a SteraMist environment chamber
Sterilization of N95 masks and other PPE was accomplished using a SteraMist-equipped room
(dimensions 5.64 m x 4.57 m x 3.05 m) at the DFCI animal research facility. Three SteraMist environmental
units (room version TPO-302-PLC-V1.4) are mounted on the ceiling of the room and can be controlled via a
single panel, accessible from the outside. iHP mist was delivered through three nozzles at a total of 90 mL/min
for 15 min, yielding a delivered concentration of 17.7 mL/m3.
N95 masks were placed with their interior surfaces facing up on standard stainless-steel shelves (open
grid, InterMetro style). Most of the other PPE was also laid out on these shelves with the exception of two
PAPR hoods, one PAPR hose, and the Tyvek coverall, which were hung in various configurations (Figure 1).
PPE was spaced 6 cm to 20 cm apart on each shelf; this was designed to test sterilization performance at
multiple points in the chamber. Tighter but non-overlapping spacing would likely be necessary for processing
equipment in higher volumes. Two PAPR hoods, one PAPR hose, and one face shield were pre-treated with
a SteraMist handheld spraying device in advance of processing in the SteraMist-equipped chamber. Pretreatment was intended to ensure delivery of sterilant to items with semi-enclosed surfaces (such as the inside
of a PAPR hose). Treating these items with the handheld device consisted of spraying the equipment from a
distance of approximately 0.5-1m for a few seconds per surface. Per manufacturer protocol, the 100-minute
sterilization cycle in the environmental chamber included: an initial 15-minute fill phase during which the
mist was released; a 20-minute dwell phase to allow the mist to penetrate the room; and a 65-minute scrub
phase during which the exhaust was re-opened to aerate the space at a rate of 43 air changes per hour. The
room is tested quarterly to ensure homogeneous sterilization throughout the space.

Evaluating sterility using biological indicators
The efficacy of sterilization was evaluated using Apex Biological Indicators (BIs: Mesa Labs;
Boseman, MT); bacterial spores in these indicators are more resistant to killing than most viruses and therefore
provide a conservative and simple estimate of sterilization efficacy. In particular, the Geobacillus
stearothermophilus spores used in this study are known to be difficult to kill using hydrogen peroxide 6. Each

Apex biological indicator ribbon carries a minimum of 1.0 x 10 6 G. stearothermophilus spores. The BIs were
positioned in the environmental chamber prior to the first sterilization cycle. For N95 masks, BIs were placed
under or adjacent to the masks. For the PAPR components and other equipment, BIs were placed on surfaces
that were judged to be least accessible to the sterilant (for example, inside the PAPR tubing) (Supplementary
Table 1). The BIs were extracted using sterile forceps, placed in Releasat growth medium (Mesa Labs),
incubated at 55-60°C, and monitored for bacterial growth over a period of 10 days using a colorimetric assay23.
Previous work with G. stearothermophilus spores suggests that a conservative benchmark for complete
sterilization represents a 6-log10 kill; that is, a ratio in the number of surviving to initial viable spores in a BI
of 10-6 (Reference 24). This corresponds to no observable bacterial growth and thus no color change after 5
days in Releasat medium.

Evaluating filtration efficiency
Single-pass filtration efficiency testing was performed at MIT on five control N95 masks and 30 masks
sterilized in the SteraMist-equipped chamber. An 8cm x 8cm sample of each N95 mask was inserted into a
specialized air duct (Supplementary Figure 2), and ambient particulate matter was driven through the duct,
and thus through the mask fabric, using a pressure differential of ~175 pascals at 0.4 m/s face velocity. The
concentration of 0.3, 0.5, and 1 μm diameter particles prior to and after passage through the mask fabric was
determined using an Aerotrak 9306 optical particle counter (TSI Inc.; Shoreview, MN) (Table 2). Filtration
efficiency testing was performed a second time on a subset of decontaminated masks stored for 10 days after
treatment to test for time-dependent degradation in N95 mask performance following sterilization. Although
readily available and potentially effective, testing performed at MIT is not equivalent to NIOSH-approved
testing for N95 masks and thus, these results should be interpreted as a relative, not absolute, measurements
of filtration efficiency.
A second sample of sterilized N95 masks was tested at ICS labs to NIOSH standards with 28 masks
undergoing an instantaneous filter efficiency test and 6 masks undergoing a full loading filter efficiency test.
Per NIOSH testing Procedure No. TEB-APR-STP-0059 (rev. 3.2)25, all masks were challenged with a sodium

chloride aerosol neutralized to a Boltzmann equilibrium state at 25  5 °C and a relative humidity of 30 
10%. Particle size and distribution was verified to correspond to a median diameter of 0.075  0.020 µm,
with a geometric standard deviation ≤ 1.86. N95 masks were conditioned at 85  5% relative humidity and 38
 2 °C for 25 hours prior to filter efficiency testing. For instantaneous filter efficiency testing, each mask was
then assembled into a fixture and subjected to instantaneous aerosol loading. The loading was performed by
depositing sodium chloride aerosol at an airflow rate of 85 liters per minute (LPM) for one minute. For full
loading filter efficiency, each mask was assembled into a fixture and subjected to full aerosol loading. The
loading was performed by depositing 200 mg of sodium chloride aerosol at an airflow rate of 85 LPM for 75
minutes. Flow rate was monitored every 5-10 minutes on average and adjusted to maintain a flow rate of 85
 2 LPM.

Quantitative fit testing
Nine masks from three models underwent a quantitative fit test following 2, 5, and 10 sterilization
cycles to confirm that sterilization did not interfere with the ability of masks to form an effective seal with the
human face. Testing was performed using a PortaCount Pro+ 8038 fit tester (TSI Inc.; Shoreview, MN) set to
the 100-200 fit factor range, per manufacturer recommendation.

Results
Evaluating sterilization using biological indicators
All BIs placed under or adjacent to N95 masks that had been exposed to a single sterilization cycle in
the SteraMist-equipped chamber exhibited at least a 9-log10 kill (representing no color change following seven
days of incubation in Releasat medium). BIs placed within PAPR hoods also achieved 9-log10 kill as did a BI
placed in a PAPR hose that was pre-treated using a SteraMist handheld spraying device (Supplementary
Table 1). BIs placed on the iPad, iPad case, and PanFab face shield designs 22 all passed the sterilization
threshold, and the iPad was observed to be fully functional after one cycle of iHP treatment. In contrast, two
BIs placed inside either end of a PAPR hose that was not subjected to pre-treatment were not sterilized, as

determined by rapid bacterial growth following transfer to Releasat medium. This was also true of a BI
embedded in the thick foam at the top of a Fisherbrand Disposable Face Shield. We tested the effect of
pretreating the same face shield with a hand-held SteraMist device (after inserting a new BI) and observed a
4-log10 kill, which also fails the 6-log10 threshold conventionally used to score successful sterilization.
From these data we conclude that a single iHP cycle is efficacious at sterilizing N95 masks and other
equipment placed throughout a SteraMist-equipped decontamination chamber and that the process is not
obviously damaging to delicate equipment such as an iPad (n = 1). Penetration into semi-enclosed spaces such
as PAPR hoses appeared to be less efficient, but such equipment could be sterilized by pre-treatment with a
handheld iHP-delivery device followed by a cycle of iHP treatment in a chamber. Even with pre-treatment
sterility was not achieved with thick face shield foam, suggesting that such normally disposable PPE should
not be reused. In contrast, a custom-fabricated face shield22 introduced under an FDA EUA and consisting of
3D printed parts appeared to be sterilized effectively.

Evaluating filtration efficiency
Performance data was collected at MIT on five models of N95 masks from three manufacturers (a total
of 30 units) using an ambient particulate matter filtration efficiency test. Relative to control N95 masks, we
observed no reduction in filtration efficiency for 0.3, 0.5, and 1 µm particles by N95 masks subjected to up to
five sterilization cycles (Table 2). Data on pressure, temperature, air face velocity, and relative humidity
during testing are found in Supplementary Table 2.
In addition, five models of N95 masks from three manufacturers (34 units total) were evaluated using
testing protocols derived from NIOSH published standard testing procedures (STPs) maintained by ICS
Laboratories. These data showed that 28 iHP-sterilized N95 masks retained instantaneous filtration
efficiencies of ≥95%, including masks subjected to five sterilization cycles, the maximum number of cycles
tested (Figure 2, Table 3, Table 4, Supplementary Table 3, and Supplementary Material 1). Gerson 2130
N95 masks were the least effective at filtering 75nm NaCl particles, but even these units passed the

instantaneous test threshold out to five sterilization cycles. In no case did we detect an appreciable increase
in resistance to airflow, a change which would likely be perceived by users as increased inhalation resistance.
Fully loaded filtration efficiency was also evaluated by ICS Laboratories to NIOSH standards. The
purpose of this test is to mimic the effect of an accumulation of charged particles in a mask, a phenomenon
related to time of use. Mask loading is known to reduce filtration efficiency, potentially by weakening
electrostatic charge in the filtering layer26. Again, we observed that the 9 sterilized masks passed the NIOSH
threshold for N95 pre-certification.
To test for time-dependent degradation of performance, 26 N95 masks were tested at MIT 10 days
after initial filtration testing (Supplementary Table 4) and 10-15 days after sterilization with iHP. We
observed no difference in filtration performance between measurements taken immediately after sterilization,
and those taken 10 days after, as determined by a repeated measures ANOVA (p = 0.45). From these data we
conclude that the filtration efficiency of multiple models of domestically manufactured N95 masks is not
substantially affected by one to five cycles of iHP sterilization in terms of filtration efficiency or inhalation
resistance, and that all masks tested meet existing NIOSH pre-certification standards.

PortaCount quantitative fit data
All nine masks that were tested for fit (KC/Halyard 46767, 3M 1860, 3M 8210) using the PortaCount
equipment passed a reading of >200 fit factor following 2, 5, and 10 sterilization cycles. This corresponds to
a filtration efficiency of 99% or higher (data not shown) according to manufacturer guidelines. Thus, iHP
sterilization does not appear to impair the ability of N95 masks to form an effective seal against a user’s face.

Discussion
Hydrogen peroxide has a long history of successful use in the field of medical device sterilization, and
our results support the use of iHP as a PPE sterilant when delivered using a SteraMist-equipped environment
chamber, in some cases complemented by pre-treatment with a handheld iHP delivery device. Thus, iHP
sterilization can likely be used to extend the usability of PPE such as N95 masks that are usually disposed of

after a single use. The DFCI SteraMist environment chamber used in this study has a volume of ~80 m3 and
could comfortably fit ~ 2400 N95 masks per cycle without the masks touching each other, or a lesser number
of PAPR hoods and other PPE. At this rate, assuming idealized staffing and logistics, roughly 4,800-7,200
masks could be sterilized for use per day given a typical 100 minute sterilization cycle. These numbers could
be increased with the addition of an overnight workforce.
In keeping with standard practice, sterility was judged in this study using biological indicators
containing bacterial spores and was not based on killing of pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 encountered in a
clinical setting. However, the G. stearothermophilus spores in the BIs we used are known to be resistant to
killing by hydrogen peroxide, and spores are substantially more resistant to sterilization than enveloped viruses
such as SARS-CoV-227. Recent work has also demonstrated that VHP can kill SARS-CoV-2.28 Thus, we do
not believe our use of BIs rather than direct measurement of viral viability represents a significant limitation
in the interpretation of the data.
Two independent lines of evidence, one generated at a university laboratory and one at a commercial
laboratory accredited to perform N95 mask certification to NIOSH/ISO/IEC standards, show that N95 masks
decontaminated with iHP using SteraMist technology retain their performance with respect to filtration and
inhalation resistance for at least five cycles, the maximum number tested. No deterioration was detected in
masks tested 10 days post treatment. Quantitative fit testing of sterilized N95 masks confirms that they still
form an airtight seal as required (in this case, tests were performed out to 10 cycles). Thus, sterilized N95
masks remain fully functional.

Limitations of this study
Given the urgency of N95 mask shortages, we are reporting results obtained to date. However, some
additional tests are currently underway to increase confidence in our specific findings and the practice of
sterilizing and reusing N95 masks more generally. For example, while we report complete data on testing for
up to 5 cycles on N95 masks, further evaluation of masks that have undergone 10 cycles of sterilization are
underway at ICS Labs, using both instantaneous and fully loaded filtration testing. The tests described in this

study were conducted using unused N95 masks. We do not yet have data on N95 masks used in an actual
health care facility responding to a pandemic. Among questions to be addressed by real-world testing are
inhalation resistance for an N95 mask that has been loaded with internal and external contaminants, the
comfort level of health care workers in using an N95 mask that is sterilized but previously used by another
individual, and the rate of wastage arising from breakage of elastic bands, contamination with makeup or
topical face products, and unacceptable degradation in fit. Remarkably, these types of real-world use data are
not available for any iHP/VHP-based sterilization method, even for technologies that have been heavily
promoted commercially. Nonetheless, the data reported in this study were judged by our clinical teams to be
sufficient to implement N95 mask sterilization and reuse at DFCI.
Future work should address the question of whether decontaminated N95 masks must be returned to
the original users (as specified in the Sterrad and Sterris EUAs for N95 mask decontamination) or can be
returned to a common pool (as specified in the Batelle EUA); the latter is substantially easier to implement
from a logistical perspective. Finally, while there is good support for the use of spore-based BIs in measuring
the efficacy of sterilization, direct tests on SARS-CoV-2 itself may be warranted, particularly in the case of
items such as hoses and other PPE that have a complex shape (this would require BL3-level studies).

Conclusions
Our data support the use of the SteraMist iHP technology as a sterilization method for reuse of N95
masks, including many of the most commonly used models, as well as other types of PPE – in some cases
following pre-treatment with an iHP handheld delivery device. In interpreting these data, it is important to
note that not all iHP/VHP methods are the same. While Bioquell is approved under an FDA EUA for 20
cycles, N95 masks sterilized using an alternative HPGP method commercialized by Sterrad fail at five cycles
(the Sterrad EUA was approved for 2 sterilization cycles and requires that a mask be returned to a single
user).8,29 Moreover, our data show that semi-enclosed items of PPE, such as PAPR hoses, cannot be sterilized
without pre-treatment, and that face shields with thick foam may not be sterile even after iHP pre-treatment
followed by iHP treatment in an environmental chamber. Thus, it is imperative that institutions seeking to

deploy iHP/VHP technology review available primary data prior to local deployment. We also suggest that
BIs routinely be deployed when attempting to sterilize hoses and other semi-enclosed PE components.
The issues described above about reuse of N95 masks have been recognized for over two decades
based on multiple instances of human transmission of novel respiratory diseases. As the global response to
COVID-19 evolves, we hope that the study of sterilization technologies such as iHP/VHP will continue and
involve peer-review of independently acquired data so that we are in a better position for the coming waves
of this crisis and for those in the future.

SUMMARY BOX
Section 1: What is already known on this topic


The COVID-19 pandemic has led to widespread shortages in personal protective equipment, such as
N95 masks, and there have been corresponding attempts for mask sterilization and subsequent reuse.



There is an absence of publicly available data on the post-sterilization performance of different makes
and models of N95 masks following different sterilization or decontamination procedures.

Section 2: What this study adds


This study evaluates a recently developed technology, ionized hydrogen peroxide (iHP), as a method
for sterilizing N95 masks and other PPE. Specifically, it assesses the SteraMist Binary Ionization
Technology® (BIT) from TOMI installed at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI; Boston, MA)
animal research facility.



Masks were tested for three critical features after multiple sterilization cycles: (1) sterility, as
measured by the inactivation of bacterial spores contained in biological indicators; (2) filtration
efficiency, measured both by aerosolized 75 nm NaCl particles and by 0.3-1 µm ambient particulate
matter; and (3) fit, using a PortaCount quantitative fit test apparatus. Sterilization of other PPE items
such as face shields as well as hoods and hoses for Powered-Air Purifying Respirators (PAPRs) was
also explored.



Our data support the use of the SteraMist iHP technology as a sterilization method for reuse of N95
masks, including many of the most commonly used models, as well as other types of PPE.
