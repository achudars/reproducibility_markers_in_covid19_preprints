Abstract
Previous studies suggest a role for systemic reprogramming of host metabolism during viral
pathogenesis to fuel rapidly expanding viral proliferation, for example by providing free amino acids
and fatty acids as building blocks. In addition, general alterations in metabolism can provide key
understanding of pathogenesis. However, little is known about the specific metabolic effects of
SARS-COV-2 infection. The present study evaluated the serum metabolism of COVID-19 patients
(n=33), identified by a positive nucleic acid test of a nasopharyngeal swab, as compared to COVID19-negative control patients (n=16). Targeted and untargeted metabolomics analyses specifically
identified alterations in the metabolism of tryptophan into the kynurenine pathway, which is wellknown to be involved in regulating inflammation and immunity. Indeed, the observed changes in
tryptophan metabolism correlated with serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels. Metabolomics analysis also
confirmed widespread dysregulation of nitrogen metabolism in infected patients, with decreased
circulating levels of most amino acids, except for tryptophan metabolites in the kynurenine pathway,
and increased markers of oxidant stress (e.g., methionine sulfoxide, cystine), proteolysis, and kidney
dysfunction (e.g., creatine, creatinine, polyamines). Increased circulating levels of glucose and free
fatty acids were also observed, consistent with altered carbon homeostasis in COVID-19 patients.
Metabolite levels in these pathways correlated with clinical laboratory markers of inflammation and
disease severity (i.e., IL-6 and C-reactive protein) and renal function (i.e., blood urea nitrogen). In
conclusion, this initial observational study of the metabolic consequences of COVID-19 infection in
a clinical cohort identified amino acid metabolism (especially kynurenine and cysteine/taurine) and
fatty acid metabolism as correlates of COVID-19, providing mechanistic insights, potential markers
of clinical severity, and potential therapeutic targets.

Introduction
On December 12, 2019 the first patient presented in Wuhan, Hubei province, China with
symptoms consistent with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Soon investigators realized that
these symptoms were caused by a new viral infection, as gleaned by a metagenomics analysis of the
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from this patient. The newly identified RNA virus strain belongs to the
Coronaviridae family and was referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’.(1) Phylogenetic analyses of the genome
(29,903 nucleotides) demonstrated its similarity (89.1%) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses
(genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that were previously isolated in bats in China (1).
Since then, the virus spread around the world, resulting in 2,959,929 confirmed cases and 202,733
confirmed deaths as of April 28, 2020 (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus2019).
To face the global pandemic, entire nations initiated lockdowns, social distancing, economic
peril, and mandatory regulations regarding wearing personal protective equipment in public. In
parallel, a worldwide mobilization of scientists has occurred, in an effort to slow viral spread, identify
suitable therapies for infected patients, and expedite vaccine development and testing (2). This
resulted in the rapid generation of new information, as well as a concomitant concern for the quality
of the evidence being disseminated (3).
COVID-19 initiates a wide spectrum of symptoms, including fever, persistent dry cough,
shortness of breath, chills, muscle pain, headache, loss of taste or smell, and gastrointestinal
symptoms. However, some subjects are more susceptible, by unknown mechanisms, to develop severe
disease, especially older males with various comorbidities, including obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular
disease, or immunosuppression (e.g., cancer patients undergoing chemo- or radio-therapy, or
transplant patients). In contrast, children, younger adults, and women tend to be either asymptomatic
or present with mild disease, while still being contagious and contributing to viral transmission. As
such, widespread testing, even of asymptomatic subjects, has been advocated as a strategy to monitor
and prevent disease dissemination. Testing nasopharyngeal swabs with nucleic acid amplification
assays was introduced worldwide to diagnose disease and monitor recovery; for example, Italy, one
of the countries hit hardest by COVID-19, enforces quarantine of any positive subjects until they no
longer show symptoms for at least 14 days and test negative twice within 24h. However, logistical
issues have limited generalized testing in most countries, including the United States (<12,000
tests/million people) (4). Nonetheless, recent development of serological testing for antibodies against
SARS-CoV-2 proteins suggest that a significantly larger fraction of the total population may have
been infected than that identified by testing nasopharyngeal swabs (e.g., up to 85-fold higher than
molecularly-confirmed cases) (5). These findings provoked ongoing debates and controversy,

especially regarding test sensitivity and specificity, and the distinction between case fatality rates
(mortality among those who tested positive by molecular assays) and infection fatality rates
(extrapolated from serological testing results), resulting in estimates of ~75-fold and ~7-fold higher
mortality than seasonal influenza, respectively. Large international initiatives (e.g., Solidarity II)
propose to tackle this issue through homogeneous serological testing in 12 countries (6). At the center
of this debate, serological testing detects antibodies against SARS-COV-2 proteins in patients who
have recovered from infection. These patients are now being actively enrolled globally as
“convalescent” plasma donors to determine whether their antibodies can help stop the spread of the
virus and provide therapeutic benefit in severely ill COVID-19 patients (7).
From a molecular standpoint, recombinant expression of SARS-COV-2 proteins, along with
structural and protein-protein interaction (8) studies, confirm that, like other phylogenetically-close
(9) coronaviruses, the SARS-COV-2 spike protein S interacts with the angiotensin converting enzyme
receptor 2 (ACE2) to penetrate host cells, especially in the lung epithelium (10). Disruption of this
interaction may provide a therapeutic target (11, 12); indeed, it is the strategy of several current
vaccine candidates to elicit humoral responses to capsid proteins (2, 13). Still, it is unclear whether
and for how long previously-positive recovered patients are immune to the virus and, therefore, the
scientific community is invested in defining suitable interventions to treat the most severe symptoms
of COVID-19. For example, in early March, 2020, preliminary evidence seemed to suggest a
beneficial role for antimalarial drugs (e.g., hydroxycholoroquine), especially in combination with
azithromycin, in decreasing viral load and improving the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (14);
however, a larger clinical trial showed a deleterious effect (e.g., a ~2-fold increase in mortality) for
patients on hydroxycholoroquine (with or without azithromycin) (15). Other treatments, while totally
effective in sanitizing inert surfaces (e.g., UV light or bleach) (16); are clearly incompatible with the
“primo non nocere” principle of medical practice. Although using antiretroviral drugs to treat SARS
coronaviruses was previously proposed in vitro (17), no clinical evidence in vivo has been provided
to date; nonetheless, the preliminary release of data from ongoing trials with remdesivir show
promise, with ~30% faster recovery and reduction in mortality (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:
NCT04280705).
Given the current difficulties in preventing infection or decreasing viral load, multiple
approaches are being investigated to identify key pathways involved in the most serious sequelae of
SARS-COV-2 infection. For example, a common finding in the most severe cases is “cytokine storm,”
driven mostly by sustained increases in circulating levels of pro-inflammatory interleukin-6 (IL6).(18) Antibody-based approaches (e.g., tocilizumab) are currently being tested as a strategy to
mitigate the clinical complications of COVID-19-induced cytokine (18). Notably, this extreme

inflammation often results in the need for ventilator support or, even, extracorporeal membrane
oxygenation (19). However, in ~80% of cases, the latter did not prevent mortality, owing to
insufficient lung perfusion, which could be explained by the development of thromboembolic
complications (20). In this context, clinical trials are currently underway to determine the impact of
anticoagulants (e.g., heparin) or pro-fibrinolytic drugs (e.g., tissue plasminogen activator) in
ameliorating severe COVID-19 infection with thromboembolic complications (21). Interestingly,
platelets from older subjects are hypercoagulable in the presence of pro-inflammatory stimuli (22),
which may help explain the increased mortality rates in older COVID-19 patients. Of note, small
molecule metabolites are relevant in treating coagulopathies (e.g., tranexamic acid to treat
hyperfibrinolysis in actively bleeding patients) (23). However, to date, nothing is known about the
serum metabolome of COVID-19 patients.
Small molecule metabolites are essential for viral infection, because they provide building
blocks that a rapidly proliferating virus requires to assemble its nucleic acids, proteins (including
capsid proteins that mediate infection of new cell targets), and membrane. Indeed, viral infections
mobilize free fatty acids to support viral capsid-associated membrane formation, which was described
for other coronaviruses and is explained, in part, by activation of phospholipase A2, a target amenable
to pharmacological intervention (24–26). The current study provides the first comprehensive targeted
and untargeted metabolomics analysis of sera from COVID-19 patients, stratified by circulating levels
of IL-6, and correlated to inflammatory markers and renal function. Though observational, this study
identifies significant alterations in fatty acid metabolism in infected patients and unanticipated
alterations of glucose homeostasis and amino acid metabolism; specifically, dysregulated tryptophan,
arginine, and sulfur metabolism are potential therapeutic targets for COVID-19.
Results
Forty-nine subjects were enrolled in this observational study: 33 COVID-19-positive subjects and 16
COVID-19-negative subjects, the latter included “never positive” subjects and convalescent plasma
donors (Figure 1.A). Owing to the skewed demographics of the COVID-19-positive patients
(prevalence and mortality being ~2-fold higher in males) (27), 76% of the subjects in this group were
male, 56.5 + 18.1 years old (mean + standard deviation) versus 38% male, 37.8 + 11.6 years old for
the control group. Of the COVID-19-positive patients, 5 were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms
with corresponding IL-6 levels of <10 pg/ml; 10 subjects had IL-6 levels of 10-65 pg/ml, and 18
subjects IL-6 levels of >90 pg/ml. Subjects in these three sub-groups had no significant differences
in age or sex. Reference ranges for IL-6 levels in healthy controls are <5 pg/ml (Figure 1.B). Of all
the COVID-19-positive subjects, only 6 had renal function parameters within the reference range

(blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 7-26 mg/dl and creatinine of 0.5-0.95 mg/dl), of which 3 were in the
low and 2 in the moderate IL-6 group, respectively (Supplementary Table 1). Targeted metabolomics
analyses were performed on sera using UHPLC-MS and the results are reported extensively in
Supplementary Table 1. The metabolic phenotypes of sera from COVID-19-positive patients
differed significantly from controls, when examined by partial least-square discriminant analysis
(PLS-DA; Figure 1.C). Hierarchical clustering analysis (Figure 1.D) highlighted significant
associations of COVID-19 and IL-6 levels with amino acid metabolism, purines, acylcarnitines, and
fatty acids; a vectorial version of this figure is provided in Supplementary Figure 1. Volcano plots
(Figure 1.E) from targeted metabolomics analyses highlighted the top metabolites that increased
(blue) or decreased (red) in the sera of COVID-19-positive patients, as compared to controls. To
expand on these observations, untargeted metabolomics analyses were performed based on highresolution, accurate intact mass, isotopic patterns and MS2 fragmentation patterns, as described;(28)
these results are reported in Supplementary Table 2. In Figure 2.A, volcano plot analyses
highlighted 3,034 and 2,484 differential metabolites for negative and positive ion modes between
COVID-19-positive and -negative subjects, respectively. PLS-DA analysis based on untargeted
metabolomics data confirmed the targeted results and further separated COVID-19-positive and
COVID-19-negative subjects (Figure 2.B), the former group separating from the latter across
principal component 1 (18.7% of the total variance) as a function of IL-6 levels. Interestingly, volcano
plot analyses comparing COVID-19-positive subjects with low, medium, and high serum IL-6 levels,
as compared to controls, showed that the low IL-6 group was most comparable to controls (199 and
218 metabolites significantly decreasing and increasing), whereas the medium (218 and 765) and high
IL-6 (206 and 789) groups differed the most (Figure 2.C). Pathway analysis of merged targeted and
untargeted metabolomics data revealed a significant impact of COVID-19 on amino acid metabolism,
especially the pathways involving tryptophan, aspartate, arginine, tyrosine, and lysine (Figure 2.D).
Top hits from these pathways were mapped against KEGG pathway map hsa01100 in Figure 2.E.
Targeted absolute quantitative measurements, as determined by stable isotope-labeled internal
standards, are provided in Supplementary Table 1 for a subset of metabolites from the most
significantly affected pathways.
Alteration of tryptophan metabolism in sera of COVID-19-positive patients
Tryptophan metabolism was the top pathway affected by COVID-19 in the analysis of targeted and
untargeted metabolomics data (Figure 2.E). As such, focused analysis of this pathway highlighted
significant decreases (inversely proportional to IL-6 concentration) in tryptophan, serotonin, and
indole-pyruvate levels (Figure 3.A). In contrast, increases in kynurenine, kynurenic acid, picolinic

acid, and nicotinic acid, but not anthranilate, suggest hyperactivation of the kynurenine pathway
(Figure 3.A). Although it is beyond the scope of this work to identify diagnostic metabolic markers
of COVID-19 positivity, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were calculated for the
absolute quantitative measurements of serum tryptophan and kynurenine in these sera (Figure 3.B);
interestingly, tryptophan levels lower than 105 M and kynurenine levels higher than 5.3 M have
areas under the curves >95% in distinguishing between the two groups (positive vs. negative); the
potential relevance of this observation will require additional study in the future.
Dysregulation of amino acid metabolism in COVID-19 patients as a function of IL-6 levels
Beyond tryptophan, metabolomics analyses revealed a significant impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection
on serum amino acid levels (Figure 4). Specifically, gluconeogenic and sulfur-containing amino acids
(e.g., cysteine, taurine) tended to decrease, especially in the moderate-high IL-6 group (Figure 4.A).
In contrast, oxidized forms of sulfur-containing amino acids (e.g., methionine sulfoxide, cystine), as
well as of arginine, increased (Figure 4.A). Although no significant changes were noted in methionine
levels, increases in acetyl-methionine and hydroxyproline, byproducts of proteolysis and collagen
catabolism, respectively, were observed, particularly in COVID-19 patients with the highest IL-6
levels (Figure 4.B). Despite increases in arginine, the urea cycle metabolic intermediates ornithine
and citrulline decreased in COVID-19 patients (Figure 4.C). In addition, creatine and creatinine, as
well as the polyamines spermidine and acetyl-spermidine, increased significantly, particularly in
patients with medium and high IL-6 levels (Figure 4.C-D); this is suggestive of renal dysfunction in
these groups, which was confirmed by clinical laboratory measurements of creatinine and BUN
(Supplementary Table 1).
Evidence of hyperglycemia, hemolysis, and lipid abnormalities in sera of COVID-19 patients
Because altered amino acid metabolism suggested dysregulated nitrogen metabolism, we determined
whether this was also accompanied by significant alterations in carbon metabolism. Notably, all
COVID-19 patients in this cohort, independent of IL-6 levels, exhibited hyperglycemia (Figure 5 –
also confirmed by clinical laboratory measurements – Supplementary Table 1). Some metabolic
intermediates of the glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathways were increased in subjects with the
highest IL-6 levels; this was suggestive of potential hemolysis (e.g., ribose phosphate; Figure 5).
However, unexpected decreases in lactate levels were noted in the same subjects, in the absence of
differences in the levels of all carboxylic acids except alpha-ketoglutarate (Figure 5); this suggested
altered transamination homeostasis consistent with an altered nitrogen balance.

In addition, sera from COVID-19 patients demonstrated significant changes in levels of
acylcarnitines and free fatty acids (Figure 6). Specifically, all short and medium-chain acylcarnitines,
but not acyl-C18:3, were significantly decreased in all COVID-19 patients, independent of IL-6
levels. Finally, all fatty acids, except for nonanoic acid, were increased in all COVID-19 patients,
independent of IL-6 levels (Figure 6).
Metabolic correlates of laboratory markers of inflammation and renal function
To determine the potential clinical relevance of these metabolic findings, metabolite levels were
compared to clinical laboratory markers of inflammation (i.e., IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP)) and
renal function (i.e., BUN; Figure 7.A-C). Notably, several acylcarnitines, kynurenine, and
methionine sulfoxide were among the top correlates to IL-6 (Figure 7.A). Interestingly,
acylcarnitines, but not free carnitine, ranked among the top positive correlates to BUN levels, along
with creatinine (as expected), carboxylic acids (e.g., fumarate, itaconate), and oxidized purines (e.g.,
inosine; Figure 7.B). Free fatty acid and tryptophan levels were among the top negative correlates to
CRP levels, which were also directly proportional to levels of picolinic acid, inosine, and short-chain
acylcarnitines (Figure 7.C).
Discussion
The present study provides the first observational metabolic characterization of sera from COVID19-positive patients. The results show marked alterations in nitrogen metabolism (especially amino
acid homeostasis, catabolism, and transamination) and carbon metabolism (especially affecting levels
of glucose and free fatty acids). Metabolites in these pathways significantly correlated with circulating
levels of inflammatory markers (i.e., IL-6 and CRP) and renal function (i.e., BUN). Interestingly, the
major effects of COVID-19, in addition of IL-6 levels, were tryptophan metabolism and the
kynurenine pathway. The rate-limiting step in this pathway is determined by the enzymatic activity
of indole 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1), a pleotropic enzyme with complex effects, including an
immunoregulatory role (29). In general, the kynurenine/tryptophan ratio is a general measure of IDO
activity, although the meaning of this measure alters depending upon the dynamics of metabolism and
its effects on half-lives of kynurenine and tryptophan. IDO has substantial immunoregulatory effects
that typically serve as a negative regulatory pathway of inflammation and immunization (30). Of
particular relevance to the current study, IDO plays a significant role in limiting lung inflammation
in the context of IL-6, and deletion of IDO severely exacerbated inflammatory lung pathology in a
murine model (31). IDO regulates immune responses by depleting tryptophan and by generating
tryptophan metabolites that activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR); both of these metabolic

alterations were observed in the current report. Moreover, IDO activity (inferred from the levels of its
metabolites) is inversely correlated with IL-6 levels. Although causes and effects cannot be inferred
in the current observational study, based upon known biology, it is reasonable to hypothesize that IDO
activity is mechanistically involved in inflammation in COVID-19. Consistent with this hypothesis,
IDO is expressed by mucosal surfaces, such as the lung, including antigen presenting cells and the
epithelium (32).
IDO1is a downstream target of interferon signaling (involving the STAT6 and NF-B
pathways) (29), which is activated in response to viral infection (33). Intriguingly, however, type I
interferon production is suppressed in SARS-COV-2 infection; in addition, multiple studies suggest
that interferon gamma production correlates with disease severity (34–37). In one such predicted
mechanism, interferon induces ACE2 receptor expression,(38) which is also the receptor for the
SARS-COV-2 spike protein S that mediates infection of host target cells (10–12). Thus, interferon
and its downstream signaling partners can have complex and potentially opposing effects in the
context of SARS-COV-2 pathology and the ensuing balance of inflammation. Importantly, IDO
activity is also regulated by oxidative stress and is enhanced by superoxide and NO. In summary,
multiple factors may affect the ability of IDO to limit inflammation and affect adaptive immunity.
Therefore, IDO activity may increase survival from COVID-19 by limiting pulmonary inflammation
while simultaneously decreasing the development of protective adaptive immunity to SARS-COV-2.
Recently, we reported an analogous activation of the IDO pathway in individuals with Trisomy
21 (Down syndrome) (29). Indeed, 4 of the 6 receptors for interferon-alpha and -gamma are encoded
by genes on chromosome 21. In addition, individuals with Down syndrome suffer from respiratory
comorbidities (e.g., pulmonary hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), gastrointestinal
disorders, diabetes, and accelerated aging (29), all risk factors for, or manifestations of, severe
COVID-19 illness. In the Down syndrome population, therapeutic strategies that target IDO1 or its
upstream signaling pathways (i.e., involving Janus-activated kinase (JAK)), were proposed to
ameliorate some comorbidities accompanying Trisomy 21 (39). In this context, the current findings
suggest the possible relevance of JAK inhibitors in treating COVID-19.(40) Epidemiological studies
of COVID-19 incidence and severity in the Down syndrome population could also provide clues with
respect to the role of interferon signaling in response to SARS-CoV-2 infections.
Nonetheless, Blanco-Melo and colleagues reported a blunted interferon I and III response in
COVID-19 (41), which could, in part, be explained by the activity of SARS-CoV-2 proteins ORF3B,
ORF6, and the nsp nuclease, these were implicated in interferon antagonism and in cleaving host
mRNA to prevent ribosomal loading and causing host shut-off, respectively.(42, 43) Similarly, others

described impaired type I interferon activity and exacerbated inflammatory responses in severe
Covid-19 patients (44), though they also described that progressive increases in disease severity, from
mild to severe to critical, correlated with the levels of transcripts for JAK1, STAT1 and 2, interferon
alpha 2, interferon alpha receptors 1 and 2, and interferon regulatory factors 1, 4, 5 and 7. In this view,
strategies were designed to supplement interferon alpha/beta when treating COVID-19 (45), which
can significantly reduce the duration of detectable virus in the upper respiratory tract and, in parallel,
reduce the duration of elevated blood levels of IL-6 and CRP. Although speculative, it is interesting
to note that metabolites in the kynurenine pathway are critical immunomodulators, as they contribute,
along with arginine (one of the most affected pathways identified herein), to the immunosuppressive
activity of dendritic cells (46) and to CD8 T cell suppression in triple negative breast cancer (47, 48).
Therefore, activation of this pathway may be a mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 promotes immune
evasion. Moreover, dysregulated tryptophan metabolism is seen in inflammation (49) and aging,
resulting in decreased NAD synthesis in older animals (50) and humans, an observation that supports
an industry providing nicotinamide riboside as a dietary supplement (51); this suggests a potential
metabolic explanation for the increased severity of COVID-19 in older subjects. In this context, it is
worth noting that pro-inflammatory signaling favors proteolysis and amino acid catabolism
(represented herein by increased acetyl-methionine and hydroxyproline, and altered levels of free
amino acids), which can be antagonized, in part, by anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-37)(52) or
inflammasome inhibitors (53). Notably, these same anti-inflammatory cytokines show promise in
regulating glycemia in aging mice (54), which is relevant in light of finding increased glycemia in
our COVID-19 patients; this may also help explain why diabetes is a risk factor for severe COVID19 illness (55). Interestingly, similar increases in circulating glucose levels are found in critically ill
patients, a phenomenon termed “traumatic diabetes”.(56–58) Similarly, in trauma patients, extreme
lipolysis is seen minutes to hours after trauma/shock, resulting in increased circulating free fatty acid
levels (56), which was also seen herein in the context of COVID-19, especially in patients with high
IL-6 levels. Indeed, a key finding in the current study was elevated long-chain free fatty acids in
COVID-19 subjects. Phospholipase A2 (PLA2), which cleaves the fatty acid in the sn-2 position of
phospholipids, is required for replication of other related viruses such as MERS-CoV and HCoV229E (25). Elevated levels of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), which are highly
enriched in the sn-2 position of phospholipids, suggests that this pathway may be upregulated during
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Increased PLA2 activity is associated with increased production of bioactive
lipids by metabolism of omega-6 PUFAs and lysophosphatidylcholine. Some of the resulting
metabolites (e.g., eicosanoids, oxylipins) may help propagate infection and thrombo-inflammatory
complications (59), by directly supporting synthesis of viral capsid membranes (24–26), by targeting

pro-inflammatory immune cells, or by activating platelets (60). Thus, inhibiting PLA2 activity or
increasing omega-3 PUFA levels, which are metabolized to bioactive lipids with anti-inflammatory
activity, could potentially reduce disease severity.
Inflammatory stimuli promote platelet hyperreactivity in older individuals (22). Notably,
polyamine byproducts of nitrogen metabolism (e.g., spermidine, acetyl-spermidine), were among the
metabolites that increased the most COVID-19 patient sera. Primary amines, such as tranexamic acid,
can prevent hyperfibrinolysis in actively bleeding patients by interacting with the Kringle domain of
tissue plasminogen activator and, thereby, blocking the fibrinolytic cascade (61). It is interesting to
speculate that inflammation-induced alterations in nitrogen metabolism may participate in
dysregulated coagulation leading to thrombus formation in the most severe cases of COVID-19. In
contrast, other metabolites associated with hypercoagulability, such as homocysteine (62) (which
increases in Down syndrome (63)), were decreased in COVID-19 patient sera. The latter may be
explained by the apparent increase in oxidant stress in COVID-19 patients, as suggested by increased
serum levels of methionine sulfoxide and cystine, along with decreases in antioxidants, such as
cysteine and taurine (64) (but, interestingly, not reduced glutathione). Conversely, decreased serum
acylcarnitine levels, which may have anticoagulant function (65), is consistent with a potential
hypercoagulable phenotype in these patients.
Interestingly, increased serum sphingosine 1-phosphate levels were observed in COVID-19
patients. Circulating levels of this metabolite are significantly influenced by red blood cell (RBC)
Sphingosine Kinase 1 activity in response to hypoxia (66), whereas alterations to this pathway
mediate responses to angiotensin II-induced stimulation in the hypoxic kidney in chronic kidney
disease (67); the latter may be relevant in light of renal dysfunction in some of the COVID-19 patients
in the current study. In contrast, one would have predicted significant increases in serum levels of
lactate and carboxylic acid markers of hypoxia (e.g., succinate) in COVID-19 patients, similar to what
is seen in hypoxemic patients following ischemic (68) or hemorrhagic shock (69). Surprisingly, no
significant increases in serum lactate or succinate levels were observed, which may be explained
because our patients were either normoxic or receiving intense respiratory therapy (e.g., ventilation)
at the time of the blood draw. Although unrelated to IL-6, fumarate and itaconate were positively
correlated with BUN and inosine, suggesting potential cross-talk between deaminated purine salvage
reactions and carboxylic acid metabolism in renal dysfunction in COVID-19, similar to acute kidney
ischemia (70). In addition, hemolysis markers (e.g., metabolic intermediates of the glycolytic and
pentose phosphate pathways) increased proportionally to IL-6 levels, suggesting a correlation
between inflammation, disease severity, and, ultimately, the extent of therapeutic interventions and

related mechanical/oxidant stress on circulating RBCs. As such, future studies will be designed to
assess COVID-19 effects on RBCs.
The present study has several limitations. First, the analyses were performed on sera obtained
as a byproduct of routine clinical laboratory testing. Although immediately refrigerated and stored
overnight for less than 24h, technical bias may have been introduced and propagated across all
samples owing to the collection procedures. Protocols are currently being implemented to
prospectively collect and bank fresh samples of serum and plasma, red blood cells, and buffy coats.
In addition, males are disproportionally represented in our study: 75% of the COVID-19-positive
patients. As such, no sex-specific analysis was performed, and future investigations on larger,
prospectively enrolled cohorts are currently underway to address this issue. Similarly, the mean age
of COVID-19-positive patients was 56, whereas the control population was generally younger (mean
age: 33 years old). Nonetheless, comparisons to prior studies on the effect of aging on the
plasma/whole blood metabolome does not suggest that the observations reported here are due to age
alone (71, 72). In addition, the COVID-19 patients in this study had significant disease, by definition,
because they were all inpatients; future studies will investigate patients with milder disease and
asymptomatic infected patients. Finally, it will be important to study serial samples from patients
throughout their clinical course to evaluate changes in the serum metabolome as a function of clinical
status (e.g., on or off a ventilator, receiving hemodialysis or not) and in response to various therapeutic
interventions (e.g., treatment with IL-6 inhibitors).
In conclusion, herein we provide the first observational report of the comprehensive serum
metabolome in COVID-19-positive patients as a function of IL-6 level, the latter as a proxy for disease
severity and as a promising therapeutic target. Our results suggest several potential therapeutic targets
in systems metabolism, potentially through dietary and pharmacological intervention. These include
(i) IDO1 or its upstream modulators (e.g., JAK, STAT, and/or interferon signaling, although we cannot
predict whether inhibition or further stimulation of this pathway would be beneficial for COVID-19
pathology and/or immunity); (ii) amino acid catabolism as a function of oxidant stress (e.g., taurine)
or inflammation-induced proteolysis (targetable directly through dietary supplementation with
taurine/N-acetylcysteine, or indirectly by using antibodies against pro-inflammatory cytokines or
antagonists to their receptors (e.g., anakinra), or by administering anti-inflammatory cytokines or
inflammasome inhibitors (52–54)); and (iii) free fatty acid levels and unsaturation, which are
amenable to dietary or pharmacological intervention (e.g., fish oil diet or fatty acid desaturase
inhibitors).

Methods
Blood collection and processing: This observational study was conducted according to the
Declaration of Helsinki, in accordance with good clinical practice guidelines, and approved by the
Columbia University Institutional Review Board. Subjects seen at Columbia University Irving
Medical Center/New York-Presbyterian Hospital included 33 COVID-19-positive patients, as
determined by SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing of nasopharyngeal swabs; in this group, the severity
of the disease was inferred from serum IL-6 levels, which were determined by a CLIA-certified
ELISA-based assay. The control group included 16 subjects, all of whom were SARS-CoV-2 negative
by nasopharyngeal swab at the time of the blood draw. Some patients in this group were “never
positive” subjects and some were COVID-19 convalescent patients who were previously positive, but
currently negative, as determined by testing nasopharyngeal swabs, and at least 14 days postresolution of symptoms. Serum was obtained from freshly drawn blood after an overnight hold at 4ºC
and all samples were then de-identified. Sera were extracted via a modified Folch method
(chloroform/methanol/water 8:4:3), which completely inactivates other coronaviruses, such as
MERS-CoV (73). Briefly, 20 L of serum was diluted in 130 l of LC-MS grade water, 600 l of icecold chloroform/methanol (2:1) was added, and the samples vortexed for 10 seconds. Samples were
then incubated at 4ºC for 5 minutes, quickly vortexed (5 seconds), and centrifuged at 14,000 x g for
10 minutes at 4ºC. The top (i.e., aqueous) phase was transferred to a new tube for metabolomics
analysis.

metabolomics:

Metabolomics analyses were performed using a Vanquish UHPLC coupled online to a Q Exactive
mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher, Bremen, Germany). Samples were analyzed using 5, 15, and 17
min gradients, as described (74, 75). For targeted quantitative experiments, extraction solutions were
supplemented with stable isotope-labeled standards, and endogenous metabolite concentrations were
quantified against the areas calculated for heavy isotopologues for each internal standard (74, 75).
Data were analyzed using Maven (Princeton University) and Compound Discoverer 2.1
(ThermoFisher). Graphs and statistical analyses were prepared with GraphPad Prism 8.0 (GraphPad
Software, Inc, La Jolla, CA), GENE E (Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA, USA), and MetaboAnalyst
4.0.(76) Spearman’s correlations and related p-values were calculated with R Studio.

nasopharyngeal swabs (A). IL-6 levels were determined during routine clinical care using a clinically-validated
ELISA assay (B) and the results were used to divide COVID-19-positive patients into groups with low (<10
pg/ml), medium (10-65 pg/ml) and high (>90 pg/ml) IL-6 levels. Sera were obtained from these subjects for
metabolomics analyses. In C, the serum metabolic phenotypes of COVID-19-positive patients significantly
differed from controls by PLS-DA. Hierarchical clustering analysis (D) highlighted a significant impact of COVID19 and IL-6 levels on amino acid metabolism, purines, acylcarnitines, and fatty acids. A vectorial version of
this figure is provided in Supplementary Figure 1. The volcano plot in E, derived from a targeted metabolomics

patients, as compared to controls.

Figure 2 – Untargeted metabolomics analyses. Untargeted metabolomics analyses were performed using
sera obtained from of COVID-19-positive and -negative subjects. Volcano plots in A highlight 3,034 and 2,484
differential metabolites (unique molecular formulae were determined by high-resolution accurate intact
mass, isotopic patterns, and MS/MS analyses) for negative and positive ion mode (left and right panel in A),

respectively. In B, PLS-DA based on the untargeted metabolomics data further separates COVID-19-negative
and -positive subjects, the latter separating from the former across PC1 (18.7% of the total variance) as a
function of IL-6 levels. In C, volcano plots highlight differences between COVID-19 positive subjects with low,
medium, and high serum IL-6 levels, as compared to controls. In D, pathway analysis of untargeted
metabolomics data identified significant effects of COVID-19 on amino acids, especially regarding tryptophan,
aspartate, arginine, tyrosine, and lysine metabolism. In E, top hits from these pathways are mapped against
KEGG pathway map hsa01100.

Figure 3 – Alterations of tryptophan metabolism in COVID-19-positive subjects. Tryptophan metabolism was
identified in targeted and untargeted metabolomics data as the top pathway affected by COVID-19 (A).
Asterisks indicate significance by ANOVA (One-way ANOVA with Tukey multiple column comparisons - *
p<0.05; ** p<0.01; *** p<0.001; ****p<0.0001). In particular, decreases in tryptophan and increases in
kynurenine were proportional to disease severity, as inferred by IL-6 levels, and predicted COVID-19 infection
with good sensitivity and specificity, as shown by the ROC curves in B.

Figure 4 – Amino acid levels and metabolism in sera of COVID-19-positive patients. Serum levels of amino
acids (A), proteolysis markers (B), urea cycle and renal function-related metabolites (C), polyamines (D), and
sulfur-redox metabolism (E) showed significant differences between COVID-19-positive patients and controls.
An overview of the pathways related to these metabolites is in F. Asterisks indicated significance by ANOVA

Figure 5 – Circulating levels of glucose and its catabolites in sera of COVID-19-positive patients. Serum levels
of glucose were significantly different when comparing COVID-19-positive patients and controls. Similarly,
significant increases were seen in the levels of some intermediates of the glycolytic and pentose phosphate
pathways in sera of COVID-19-positive patients. No significant changes were noted in serum levels of
carboxylic acids across the groups. Asterisks indicated significance by ANOVA (One-way ANOVA with Tukey
