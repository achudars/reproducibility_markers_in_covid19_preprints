Abstract

43

PCR methods are presently the standard for the diagnosis of Coronavirus disease 2019

44

(COVID-19), but additional methodologies are needed to complement PCR methods, which

45

have some limitations. Here, we validated and investigated the usefulness of measuring serum

46

antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using the

47

iFlash3000 CLIA analyzer. We measured IgM and IgG titers against SARS-CoV-2 in sera

48

collected from 26 PCR-positive COVID-19 patients, 53 COVID-19-suspected but

49

PCR-negative patients, and 20 and 100 randomly selected non-COVID-19 patients who visited

50

our hospital in 2020 and 2017, respectively. The within-day and between-day precisions were

51

regarded as good, since the coefficient variations were below 5%. Linearity was also considered

52

good between 0.6 AU/mL and 112.7 AU/mL for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and between 3.2 AU/mL and

53

55.3 AU/mL for SARS-CoV-2 IgG, while the linearity curves plateaued above the upper

54

measurement range. We also confirmed that the seroconversion and no-antibody titers were over

55

the cutoff values in all 100 serum samples collected in 2017. These results indicate that this

56

measurement system successfully detects SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG. We observed four

57

false-positive cases in the IgM assay and no false-positive cases in the IgG assay when 111

58

serum samples known to contain autoantibodies were evaluated. The concordance rates of the

59

antibody test with the PCR test were 98.1% for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and 100% for IgG among

60

PCR-negative cases and 30.8% for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and 73.1% for SARS-CoV-2 IgG among

61

PCR-positive cases. In conclusion, the performance of this measurement system is sufficient for

62

use in laboratory testing.

Introduction

65

In December 2019, the first pneumonia cases caused by an unknown microorganism

66

were identified in Wuhan, China.[1] The pathogen was identified as a novel betacoronavirus and

67

was named

68

SARS-CoV-2 is phylogenetically similar to SARS-CoV, which caused outbreaks of a severe

69

respiratory syndrome in China in 2002.[3] The symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019

70

(COVID-19), which is the respiratory syndrome caused by SARS-CoV-2, are fever, cough and

71

lymphopenia.[4] Chest computed tomography examinations of COVID-19 patients are

72

characterized by the bilateral distribution of patchy shadows or ground-glass opacities.[5] Since

73

early December 2019 and as of June 15, 2020, over 7,800,000 cases of COVID-19 have been

74

confirmed and 430,000 deaths have been reported throughout the world,[6] and the World

75

Health Organization has reported a fatality rate for cases defined as pneumonia of

76

approximately 2%.[7]

“ severe

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

” [2]

77

Currently, COVID-19 is diagnosed by the clinical presentation of the patient, as

78

described above, and the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory specimens, such as a

79

nasal swab or sputum, using real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction

80

(RT-PCR).[8,9] However, this method requires skilled technicians who know how to handle

81

genetic samples and perform PCR tests and occasionally causes false-negative results because

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.16.20155796; this version posted July 18, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

82

of the viral replication window, a low viral titer, or incorrect sample collection.[10] Moreover,

83

the sampling of respiratory specimens exposes medical staff to a higher risk of secondary

84

infection through aerosolization than the sampling of sera.[11,12] Therefore, other methods are

85

required to complement PCR testing.

86

Candidate complementary tests include both antigen and antibody tests. Regarding

87

antigen tests, although this method does not require special skills for performing genetic testing,

88

there remains a high risk of secondary infection during sampling, and the sensitivity of antigen

89

tests is reportedly lower than that of PCR testing.[13,14] Antibody tests are another candidate.

90

Compared with PCR testing, this serological test method has a faster turn-around time and

91

requires easier and safer sample collection and less specialized skills for technicians;

92

furthermore, when we interpret the results of an antibody testing considering the duration after

93

the onset of COVID-19, this test would give us important information in diagnosing COVID-19.

94

The main concern regarding antibody tests is the high frequency of false-positive cases, which

95

is a parameter that should depend on the quality of the test product.[15,16] Recently, Shenzhen

96

YHLO Biotech Co., Ltd (China) has developed an antibody test with a high specificity[17–19];

97

however, this method has not yet been validated in the Japanese population. Therefore, in the

98

present study, we aimed to validate the measurement of IgM and IgG antibodies against

99

SARS-CoV-2 in sera and to investigate the usefulness of this method for the diagnosis of

Subjects

104

We enrolled a total of 26 COVID-19-positive cases and 53 COVID-29-suspected cases

105

who were hospitalized at The University of Tokyo Hospital. Confirmed COVID-19 cases were

106

defined based on the guidelines of The University of Tokyo Hospital. Briefly, patients with

107

acute respiratory infection syndrome accompanied by detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in a throat

108

swab or sputum at least once were confirmed as having COVID-19 (PCR-positive cases).

109

Suspected patients were defined as subjects with respiratory symptoms, a history of overseas

110

travel, or a high-risk contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case but with negative PCR results.

111

We collected residual sera available after routine clinical testing and kept it frozen until

112

measurement. The serological tests were performed using the sample that had been collected on

113

the day closest to the day on which the sample for the PCR test had been collected. As control

114

groups, we randomly selected 20 and 100 outpatients who had visited The University of Tokyo

115

Hospital in March 2020 or January-December 2017, respectively. We also corrected 111 serum

116

samples known to contain autoantibodies.

Informed consent was obtained in the form of an opt-out form on the institution’s website. This

Ethics Committee (2019300NI-3).

121

Antibody testing

122

Antibody testing was performed using SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG chemiluminescence

123

immunoassay (CLIA) kits supplied by Shenzhen YHLO Biotech Co., Ltd. (China) and an

124

iFlash3000 fully automated CLIA analyzer also from Shenzhen YHLO Biotech Co., Ltd.

125

(China). Two antigens of SARS-CoV-2 (nucleocapsid protein [N protein] and spike protein [S

126

protein]) were coated on the magnetic beads of these CLIA assays. The SARS-CoV-2 IgM or

127

IgG titers were calculated as relative light units (RLU) obtained from the analyzer and were

128

described as arbitrary units per milliliter (AU/mL). According to the manufacturer’s instructions,

129

the cutoff value for a positive SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG result was deemed as 10 AU/mL. If the

130

SARS-CoV-2 IgG titer was over 40 AU/mL, the sample was diluted with non-reactive serum

131

and the antibody titers were measured once again.

132

Method validation

133

The within-day precision was validated by measuring 3 kinds of serum samples with

134

20 replications simultaneously. Then, we calculated the mean value, the standard deviation (SD),

135

and the coefficient of variation (CV) for each sample. The between-day precision was validated

136

using two kinds of quality-control samples provided by the manufacturer. These samples were

137

measured twice a day on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9-11, and 16. Linearity was investigated using two

138

kinds of pooled serum samples. Briefly, each sample was diluted with pooled non-reactive

139

serum in two-fold serial dilutions for ten times. To investigate the existence of the prozone

140

phenomenon, we diluted the samples with high concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG

141

titers using ten-fold serial dilutions for the SARS-CoV-2 IgM assay and two-fold serial dilutions

142

for the SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay.

143

Statistical analysis

144

The data were analyzed using StatFlex software (Osaka, Japan). The results were

145

expressed as the mean ± SD. The Dunn test was used for comparisons of antibody titers

146

between the control and other groups. A value of p < 0.05 was regarded as statistically

147

significant in all the analyses.

151

First, we investigated the precision and accuracy of the antibody testing. As shown in

152

Table 1A, the intra-day precision values were 1.9%-2.9% for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and 1.1%-3.3%

153

for SARS-CoV-2 IgG, while the between-day precision values were 1.9%-3.3% for

154

SARS-CoV-2 IgM and 2.5%-3.7% for SARS-CoV-2 IgG.

(A)Within-day precision. We measured SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG in three kinds of samples;

each sample was the analyzed with 20 replicates on the same day. (B) Between-day precision.

159

We continuously measured two kinds of samples on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9-11, and 16; each

160

sample was analyzed with 2 replicates.

161

162

163

Measurement range of SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing

To explore the measurement range of this antibody test, we performed a linear

164

regression analysis. When we investigated linearity using samples with moderate antibody titers,

165

the curves showed a good linearity between 0.6 AU/mL and 112.7 AU/mL for SARS-CoV-2

166

IgM and between 3.2 AU/mL and 55.3 AU/mL for SARS-CoV-2 IgG (Fig. 1). Next, we

167

measured samples with high antibody titers to determine the upper limit of the measurement

168

range. In the SARS-CoV-2 IgM assay, the upper curve increased up to a value of 2,405 AU/mL

169

and then reached a plateau at higher concentrations. In the SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay, the curve

170

reached a plateau at values over 73 AU/mL (Fig. 2). Therefore, we diluted the samples and

171

determined the SARS-CoV-2 IgG titers for SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels over 50 AU/mL. In both

172

assays, a hook effect was not observed.

184

Successful detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG

185

To confirm that this antibody measurement system could detect SARS-CoV-2

186

IgM/IgG successfully, we measured the antibody titers in sera obtained before and after

187

infection with SARS-CoV-2 in three cases of COVID-19 confirmed using RT-PCR tests. As

188

shown in Fig. 3, SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG were not detected before symptom onset; at several

189

days after symptom onset, tests for both antibodies became positive and the titers gradually

190

increased. In case 1, the IgM test once again became negative 19 days after hospitalization.

191

Second, we obtained 100 random serum samples collected from outpatients who had

192

visited The University of Tokyo Hospital in 2017, when SARS-CoV-2 did not exist. None of

193

these samples had an antibody titer over 10 AU/mL, suggesting that this measurement system

194

can detect SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG without false-positive results (Fig. 4).

with one of 5 different autoimmune diseases. For IgM, most of the serum samples from the

208

patients with autoimmune diseases did not have a result over 10 AU/mL. However, two

209

rheumatoid factor-positive patients, one anti-double-strand DNA antibody-positive patient, and

210

one anti-mitochondrial M2 antibody-positive patient had values that exceeded the cutoff value

211

(Fig. 5A). For IgG, none of the autoantibody-positive serum samples had a result that was over

10 AU/mL (Fig. 5B).

Concordance rate with PCR testing

225

To investigate clinical usefulness, we compared the results of the serological antibody

226

tests with those of PCR tests. Among the 26 PCR-positive COVID-19 cases, 8 cases (30.8%)

227

had IgM-positive results and 19 cases (73.1%) had IgG-positive results. Among the 53

228

PCR-negative COVID-19-suspected cases, 52 cases (98.1%) had IgM levels below 10 AU/mL

In this study, we observed 5 suspected false-positive IgM results. As described in the

239

Materials and Methods section, the measurement system tests the reactivity to both the N

240

protein and the S protein of SARS-CoV-2. We investigated the reactivity of the samples to N

241

protein and S protein separately, and only reactivity to N protein was observed in the 5

242

suspected false-positive samples (Table 3).

Discussion

251

In this study, we validated a method for quantifying SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG using

252

the iFlash3000 automated CLIA analyzer. First, the within-day precisions of the SARS-CoV-2

253

IgM and IgG assays were obviously good in validations using three kinds of serum samples: a

254

sample with a negative antibody titer, a sample with a titer close to the cutoff level, and an

255

obviously positive sample (Table 1A). The between-day precisions for both assays also seemed

256

good (Table 1B). These results suggest that relatively stable data were provided by this

257

measurement system, while some anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection kits authorized for

258

emergency use by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the USA have a CV of more than

259

5% for within-day precision and some manufacturers do not even publish precision data for

260

their products. The linearity was good up to values of 112.7 AU/mL for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and

261

55.3 AU/mL for IgG, while the assay signal gradually reached a plateau at over 2,405 AU/mL

262

for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and over 73 AU/mL for IgG (Fig. 2). Therefore, the sample should be

263

diluted if the measured value is expected to be higher than the measurement range. To dilute

264

samples, non-reactive serum should be used as a diluent, since the titers are calculated as values

265

lower than the actual values when saline is used as a diluent, especially for IgM measurements

266

(data not shown). Clinical decisions are rarely affected by this phenomenon, since the

267

measurement range that was validated in the present study covers much higher values than the

268

manufacturer’s cutoff.

269

Regarding the antibody tests, in addition to issues surrounding accuracy, the matter of

270

false-positive cases has also been a concern. As shown in Fig. 3, the SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG

271

levels were negative before hospitalization in three cases, and these antibody levels

272

subsequently became positive after symptom onset in all cases, suggesting that this serological

273

test can surely detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. In addition, we demonstrated that this

274

measurement system could detect SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG without any false-positive results by

275

evaluating 100 serum samples collected in 2017, when SARS-CoV-2 did not exist. These results

276

confirm that this measurement system might be able to detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2

277

alone, without cross-reactivity with other coronavirus strains that cause 15%-29% of all

278

common colds.[20,21] Chemiluminescence immunoassays are known to be affected by

279

autoantibodies, such as rheumatoid factor, relatively often.[22] In the present study, we

280

investigated whether five kinds of autoantibodies might interfere with the measurement system

281

and found that no false-positive results were observed for the IgG assays, while four

282

false-positive cases were observed for the IgM assays. We also found one PCR-negative case

283

with a SARS-CoV-2 IgM titer over the cutoff value. Actually, when we investigated the

284

reactivity of N protein and S protein to the sera separately, we found that the false-positive cases

285

were caused by reactivity to the N protein (Table 3). The reason for this reactivity remains

286

unclear at present but might be due to the cross-reactivity of the measurement system or, since

287

the structure of the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to that of other coronavirus strains,

288

antibodies to a structure similar to the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 might actually exist.

289

Finally, we investigated the concordance rate between PCR and this measurement

290

system. As shown in Table 2, although all the PCR-negative subjects had negative results except

291

for one subject with a high IgM level, the PCR-positive subjects did not necessarily have

292

positive results for IgM or IgG. This discrepancy might be due to the fact that we used the

293

serum sample that had been collected on the day nearest to the day on which the PCR sample

294

had been collected. In several cases, only a few days had passed since the onset of symptoms,

295

and IgG and IgM are reportedly not detectable during the early phase of COVID-19.[23]

296

Therefore, the time course for the appearance of IgG and IgM must be investigated for the

297

application of antibody tests in clinical practice.

298

A characteristic of the present method is that both the N protein and the S protein are

299

used as antigens. Reportedly, the sensitivity and specificity might depend on the types of

300

antigens that are recognized by the antibodies, and the antibody to S protein is more sensitive

301

than the antibody to N protein.[24–26] Since the measurement system in the present study uses

302

both the S and N proteins, this system might provide a greater sensitivity and diagnostic ability

303

than an antibody test using either the S protein or the N protein alone. In contrast, analyzing the

304

reactivity to both proteins could increase the number of false-positive cases, as described above.

305

Further studies on the clinical significances of antibodies to N protein and S protein might be

306

necessary to conclude which is most appropriate: measuring the reactivity to both proteins or to

307

each protein separately.

308

In conclusion, we have validated a measurement system for detecting IgM and IgG

309

against SARS-CoV-2 using CLIA kits and have observed that this system had sufficient

310

performance for its introduction into clinical laboratory testing. Moreover, the possibility of

311

false-negative results, especially for IgG against SARS-CoV-2, was relatively low. In the future,

312

this method might be helpful for clinical diagnosis, epidemiological investigations, and the
