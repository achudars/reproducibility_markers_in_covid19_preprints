Abstract
Genomic sequencing has played a major role in understanding the pathogenicity of severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). With the current pandemic, it is essential that SARSCoV-2 viruses are sequenced regularly to determine mutations and genomic modifications in different
geographical locations. In this study we sequenced SARS-CoV-2 from 5 clinical samples obtained in
Oklahoma, USA during different time points of pandemic presence in the state. One sample from the
initial days of the pandemic in the state and 4 during the peak in Oklahoma were sequenced. Previously
reported mutations including D614G in S gene, P4715L in ORF1ab, S194L, R203K and G204R in N gene
were identified in the genomes sequenced in this study. Possible novel mutations were also detected
such as G1167V in S gene, A6269S and P3371S in ORF1ab, T28I in ORF7b, G96R in ORF8. Phylogenetic
analysis of the genomes showed similarity to viruses from across the globe. These novel mutations and
phylogenetic analysis emphasize the contagious nature of the virus.

Introduction
Towards the end of 2019, several individuals with signs of pneumonia reported to hospitals in Wuhan,
the capital of Hubei province in Central China. The etiological agent was identified to be a novel
coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2/ nCoV-19) on 7th January 2020(1). Human to human transmission was recorded
around the same time(2). By the end of January 2020, WHO declared a ‘public health emergency of
international concern’(3). As of September 5th, 2020, a total of 26,696,160 confirmed patients and
875,943 deaths have been reported worldwide and 63,187 registered cases and over 850 deaths in the
state of Oklahoma, USA(4).
Numerous coronaviruses infecting different animal species including humans have been identified.
SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped positive sense single stranded RNA virus belonging to the genus
Betacoronavirus (subgenus Sarbecovirus) in the Coronaviridae family (order: Nidovirales). Based on
genomic sequence analysis, it is reported to have originated from bats(5) and pangolins(6, 7). Other
previously identified coronaviruses known to infect humans include SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV , HCoVNL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1(8–13).
Genomic sequence data is important in identifying, characterizing and understanding pathogens (14,
15). It can shed light on pathogenicity, virulence, drug/vaccine targets, mutation sites etc. and can also
be critical in source attribution and determining microbial provenance (16). The first genome sequence
of SARS-CoV-2 was made available on January 10th (GenBank ID: MN908947.3) (17). Multiple genomic
sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from all over the world have since been deposited in public data bases such as
GenBank and GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data; www.epicov.org) (18). This has
facilitated extensive genomic studies leading to the identification of several mutations in the genome
that can influence infectivity and virulence of the virus (16, 19, 20).
The genome of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to many other pathogenic coronaviruses and has multiple genes
that code for different proteins such as S gene (Surface glycoprotein), N gene (nucleocapsid
phosphoproteins), M gene (membrane glycoprotein), E gene (envelope protein), and open reading
frames, such as ORF1a, ORF1b ORF3a,ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8 and ORF10 (16, 21). The leading
sequence of the viral genome is the sequence for ORF1ab, which encodes for multiple proteins
including replicase polyproteins, non-structural proteins, papain-like proteinase, RNA dependent RNA
polymerase etc., which are essential for replication and survival in the host (21). Though the exact

function of ORF3a is yet to be clearly understood, it is believed to play a major role in viral release after
replication in SARS-CoV-1 (22). ORF7 and ORF8 code for accessory proteins, the functions of which are
yet to be clearly understood (23, 24). Minimal roles of ORF7 and 8 in viral replication have been
reported in SARS-CoV-1 alongside apoptosis stimulation of host cells(25).
The huge repository of sequence data in open-source databases such as the GenBank-NCBI and GISAID
has facilitated the identification of numerous mutations and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in
the SARS-CoV-2 genome. SNPs in the genome that result in commonly reported non-synonymous
mutations such as P4715L in ORF1ab, D614G in S gene, R203K and G204R in N gene are some of the
commonly reported. P4715L in ORF1ab is believed to play a major role in interaction with other proteins
that regulate RNA dependent RNA polymerase (26). D614G (Aspartate to Glycine) mutation in the S
gene has been reported to result in increased transduction into human epithelial cells (20). N gene
mutations R203K and G204R are believed to increase viral fitness, survival and adaptation to humans
(27).
In this study, we sequenced the genome of SARS-CoV-2 from 5 human clinical samples received at the
Oklahoma Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (OADDL) at various times during the SARS-CoV-2
pandemic in Oklahoma. Multiple mutations were detected in the genomic sequences including those
already reported as well as previously unreported mutations.

Materials and methods:
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (Application number: IRB-20-357) at
Oklahoma State University, Stillwater OK 74078, USA.

Clinical samples and processing: Five Nasopharyngeal swabs collected from human patients received at
OADDL for COVID-19 testing between March 2020 – July 2020 were used in this study. Nucleic acid
extraction was performed using MagMax Viral Pathogen Nucleic acid isolation kit (Thermofisher, MA,
USA) as per manufacturer’s recommended protocols. Viral presence was detected by real-time PCR
using TaqPath COVID-19 Multiplex Diagnostic Solutions (Thermofisher, MA, USA). All samples had a
cycle threshold value between 18-22.
Genomic sequencing: cDNA was synthesized from extracted RNA from five clinical samples that were
positive for SARS-CoV-2. cDNA was then PCR amplified using ARTIC V3 primers
(https://github.com/artic-network/artic-ncov2019/tree/master/primer_schemes/nCoV-2019/V3) to
obtain overlapping segments of the whole viral genome. DNA library repair (SQK-LSK-109, Oxford
Nanopore Technologies, UK), Solid Phase Reversible Immobilization (SPRI) paramagnetic beads clean-up
(AMPure XP, Beckmann Coulter, CA, USA) and adapter ligation and barcoding (NBD-001, Oxford
Nanopore Technologies, UK) were done as per manufacturer recommendations. Libraries were then
pooled and sequenced using MinION (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, UK) platform following
manufacturer recommendations.
Genome Assembly, Alignment and Phylogenetic analysis: Sequences obtained were assembled de novo
using Canu (28). To further obtain a reliable consensus genome assembly, de novo assemblies and
sequence output files were assembled to the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome Wuhan Hu-1 (GenBank ID:
MN908947.3) with minimap2 (29) and Nanopolish (30).

To assess uniqueness of the genomes sequenced in this study, MAFFT (31, 32) was used to align whole
sequences of the 5 genomes to SARS-CoV-2 reference genome (NC_045512.2).
Gene predictions on the consensus assemblies were made using Viral Genome ORF Reader 4 (33)
(VIGOR4) using a curated library available in the Virus Pathogen Resource (ViPR) (34) database.
Individual genes were aligned to SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan Hu-1 genome from NCBI (GenBank ID:
MN908947.3) using MUSCLE aligner in MEGA-X (35) to identify SNPs and changes in the amino acid
produced by the gene.
To assess similarity to previously reported genomes, a phylogenetic analysis was made using 9072
genomes of SARS-CoV-2 from the GenBank database and the 5 viruses sequenced in the study. A
General Time Reversible (GTR) substitution model based Unweighted Pair Group Method with
Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA) alignment was constructed using MAFFT and FastTree (36). Clade

definitions for the sequences were identified using 9 marker variants reported for classification
in the GISAID database (18).
Results and Discussion:
Five clinical rRT-PCR positive samples from different periods of the pandemic in Oklahoma, USA were
chosen for the study. One of the samples (Oklahoma-ADDL -1) was received during the initial stages
(April 2020) of the pandemic. An increased incidence rate of the disease was observed by the end of
May 2020 (4). Three of the samples (Oklahoma-ADDL -2,3,4) sequenced were received during this period
and the last sample (Oklahoma-ADDL -5) was received one month (June 2020) after this period. More
than 4000X coverage was obtained at the end of sequencing for all the samples. Following de novo
assembly with Canu, consensus genomes were obtained after reference genome assembly with
nanopolish and minimap2.
The five viral genome assemblies were aligned to the reference genome (SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1
NC_045512.2) using MAFFT and genome similarities to the reference isolate were calculated (Table 1).
Most of the genomes showed more than 99% similarity. For Oklahoma-ADDL-5, only a partial sequence
could be generated and hence showed a lower 86.836% similarity. This could be due to reduced
amplification during amplicon generation and also due to reference assembly. Other than OklahomaADDL-5, Oklahoma-ADDL-1 sequenced from a clinical sample obtained during the beginning of the
pandemic in Oklahoma (April 2020) showed a lower similarity to the reference genome when compared

Table 1: Genome similarity of 5 sequenced genomes when compared to NCBI reference genome
(NC_045512.2) along with total reads generated and genome coverage obtained
Genes were predicted using VIGOR4 and individual genes were aligned to their respective NCBI
reference genes using MUSCLE aligner with UPGMA alignment in MEGA-X to assess mutations in the
genome. Using MEGA-X visualization tool, various silent and missense mutations were detected. The
missense/non-synonymous mutations detected in major genes are listed in Table2. While nonsynonymous mutations were detected in ORF1ab, ORF1a, S, N, ORF3a, ORF7, ORF8, none were detected
in Envelope (E) gene, Membrane glycoprotein (M) gene or ORF10 gene.

Non-synonymous mutation at amino acid location 81 (C T; Arginine Cysteine), which codes for nsp2
was present in all the genomes sequenced in the study. The potential implication of this mutation is
unknown. nsp2 along with nsp3 are known to play major roles in pathogenesis (37) of SARS-CoV-2 in
humans. A few other possibly novel and previously reported non-synonymous mutations in ORF1a and
ORF1ab were also identified. A previously reported mutation in the ORF1ab gene P4715L(38) (Proline to
Leucine) was recorded alongside novel mutations at various amino acid locations. P4715L mutation has
been implicated to play a major role in interaction with other proteins that regulate RNA Dependent
RNA polymerase activity. P3371S (Proline to Serine) mutation in ORF1ab and ORF1a was detected in
Oklahoma-ADDL-5. Oklahoma-ADDL-4 carried mutation T4412A (Threonine to Alanine) in ORF1ab, while
Oklahoma-ADDL -2 and 3 carried mutation A6269S (Alanine to Serine). ORF1ab has multiple functions
including RNA dependent RNA polymerase activity, helicase activity, Fe-S cluster binding, Zn- binding
activity, methyltransferase activity(39) etc. Functional implications of these mutations are still unknown
and further studies to understand functional changes caused by these mutations may aid in better
understanding the pathogenesis of the viral isolates found in Oklahoma.

Non-synonymous mutations were also found in S, ORF3a, ORF7b, ORF8 and N gene (Table 2). A
previously reported mutation in S gene - D614G(40) (Aspartate to Glycine), was identified in all the
genomes sequenced. The D614G mutation has been reported to cause a decrease in PCR cycle
thresholds, suggestive of higher upper respiratory tract viral load (41, 42) in the host. A previously
reported deleterious variation in the protein expressed from ORF3a, Q57H(40, 43), was recorded in
Oklahoma-ADDL-1, the genome isolated at the beginning of the pandemic in Oklahoma. This mutation
was not recorded in genomes isolated at other times in the state. The N gene also carried other
previously reported mutations (Table 2). Oklahoma-ADDL-4, carried a non-synonymous mutation
S194L(19) while Oklahoma-ADDL 2,3,5 carried R203K and G204R(40).
A few possible novel mutations were also identified in S, ORF3a, ORF7b, ORF8 and N genes (Table 2). A
mutation in the S gene, G1167V (Glycine to Valine) was identified in Oklahoma-ADDL-4. T28I in ORF7b
gene, a non-synonymous mutation (Threonine to Isoleucine) in the genome Oklahoma-ADDL -5 and in
ORF8, G96R non-synonymous mutations resulting in Glycine to Arginine were noted in Oklahoma-ADDL 2 and Oklahoma-ADDL-3. These mutations in the genome indicate presence of multiple variations of the
virus in Oklahoma.
A phylogenetic tree was constructed using 9072 genomes available in the NCBI repository. The nearest
neighbors to the genomes were found to be isolates reported from San Diego and Atlanta in USA and
from Greece and Australia. While the Oklahoma-ADDL -1 and 5 were phylogenetically more related to
isolates reported from Australia, Oklahoma-ADDL -2 and 3 were phylogenetically related to isolates
reported from Greece and Atlanta, USA. Oklahoma-ADDL -4 was phylogenetically related to the isolate
reported from San Diego USA. Oklahoma-ADDL-1 was identified to be in clade-GH and Oklahoma-

ADDL-2,3,4,5 were identified to be in clade GR as per annotations of different marker variants
in the GISAID database. The presence of multiple isolates within the Oklahoma sheds light on
contagious nature of these viruses.
The genomes sequenced have been submitted to GISAID and GenBank (Table 1)

Conclusion:
We determined the sequence five SARS-COV-2 genomes, collected between March to July from
Oklahoma USA, using MinION by Oxford Nanopore Technologies. Genome assembly and annotation
studies identified several new mutations as well as previously reported mutations. Notably, presence of
D614G mutation S gene was found in all the isolates, thus indicating presence of highly virulent strains in
Oklahoma. Detection of multiple mutations in the viral genomes collected from a narrow geographic
region within a few months of the Pandemic underscores the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to undergo rapid
genomic alterations that can potentially influence host susceptibility, pathogenicity and virulence.
Phylogenetic analysis of the virus genomes revealed high similarities in gene sequences with isolates
reported from Australia, Greece, Atlanta and San Diego in USA, indicating origin of different isolates
arising from multiple introductions in the state. Further mass sequencing of clinical isolates is needed to
comprehensively identify genomic variations of SARS-CoV-2 in specific geographic locations.
