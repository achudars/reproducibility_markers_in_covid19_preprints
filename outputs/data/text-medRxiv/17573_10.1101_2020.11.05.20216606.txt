Abstract
Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at the frontline of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
pandemic response, yet there is a paucity of literature on their knowledge, attitudes and practices
(KAP) in relation to the pandemic. Community Health Workers (CHWs) in Mozambique are known
locally as agentes polivalentes elementares (APEs). While technical guidance surrounding COVID-19
is available to support APEs, communicating this information has been challenging due to
restrictions on travel, face-to-face group meetings and training, imposed from May to August 2020.
A digital health platform, upSCALE, that already supports 1,213 APEs and 299 supervisors across
three provinces, is being used to support APEs on effective COVID-19 management by delivering
COVID-19 sensitive SMS messages, training modules and a COVID-19 KAP survey.
The KAP survey, conducted from June 2020 to August 2020, consisted of 10 questions. Of 1,065
active upSCALE APEs, 28 percent completed the survey. Results indicate that only a small proportion
of APEs listed the correct COVID-19 symptoms, transmission routes and appropriate prevention
measures (25 percent, 16 percent and 39 percent, respectively) specifically included in national
health education materials. Misconceptions were mainly related to transmission routes, high risk
individuals and asymptomatic patients. 84 percent said they followed all government prevention
guidelines. The results from the KAP survey were used to support the rapid development and
deployment of targeted COVID-19 awareness and education materials for the APEs. SMS messages
were continually adjusted based on the KAP survey results and a series of seven COVID-19 training
modules were developed and disseminated. A follow-up KAP survey is planned for November 2020.
Adapting the existing upSCALE platform enabled a better understanding, in real time, of the KAP of
APEs around COVID-19 management. Subsequently, supported improved delivery of tailored
messages and education, vital for ensuring a successful COVID-19 response.

Introduction
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly expanding pandemic caused by a novel human
coronavirus: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) (1). It was first reported
in December 2019 among patients with viral pneumonia symptoms in Wuhan, China (2). As of 12
October 2020, there have been 37,423,660 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 1,074,817
deaths, reported to WHO (3). To date, the African continent appears to be one of the least affected
regions in the world with 1,594,750 cases and 38,570 deaths (4), but the numbers are increasing (5).
Mozambique reported its first imported COVID-19 case on March 22, 2020 and has seen an increase
in cases since then (6). As of 12 October there have been a total of 10,001 confirmed cases and 71
related deaths in the country (3).
COVID-19 is transmitted from person-to-person through inhalation of aerosols from an infected
individual (7). Older adults and patients with pre-existing illnesses (like hypertension, cardiac
disease, lung disease, cancer, or diabetes) have been identified as potential risk factors for severe
disease and mortality (8). To date, there is no antiviral curative treatment or vaccine that has been
recommended for COVID-19 (9). More information about its distribution, transmission,
pathophysiology, treatment, and prevention are being studied. Infection by SARS-CoV-2 in humans
occurs mainly through close contact through respiratory droplets, by direct contact with infected
persons, or by contact with contaminated objects and surfaces (10). Primary preventive measures
include frequent hand washing for a minimum of 20 seconds at a time, maintaining social distance,
and respiratory hygiene (covering mouth and nose while coughing or sneezing) (11).
Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at the frontline of the COVID-19 pandemic response (12), yet there is
a paucity of literature on their knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) in relation to the COVID-19
pandemic. One HCW KAP study, focused on Asian HCWs and medical students, revealed that a

significant proportion (61 percent) had poor knowledge of its transmission (13). A study in Uganda,
among hospital based HCWs, found that only 69 percent had sufficient knowledge of the disease,
although a higher percentage (74 percent) reported practicing good prevention measures (14). One
HCW study in Pakistan showed higher knowledge (93 percent) and good practice (89 percent)
regarding COVID-19 (15). Findings from another HCW KAP study in Nepal found 82 percent of
respondents had good to moderate knowledge of COVID-19 and 84 percent had good prevention
practices (16). In a study among HCWs in China, 89 percent of HCWs had sufficient knowledge of
COVID-19 and 90 percent followed correct practices regarding COVID-19 prevention, yet more than
85 percent feared self-infection with the virus (17).
Other KAP studies, in Nigeria and Tanzania, have focused on the KAP of COVID-19 among community
residents. Residents from a study in Northern Nigeria showed high level of awareness of COVID-19
and prevention methods (99 percent and 95 percent, respectively). However, a lower percentage (80
percent) said they follow government guidelines for prevention (18). In the Tanzanian study, 84
percent of the participants had a good knowledge of COVID-19 (19). Similar community based KAP
studies have been conducted in China, the Philippines and Malaysia. A Chinese residents’ KAP survey
towards COVID-19, conducted during the rapid rise period of the outbreak, showed that COVID-19
knowledge was 90 percent and that nearly all of the participants (98 percent) wore masks when
going out (20). In a survey among poor households in the Philippines, 94 percent of respondents
were aware of COVID-19 and 82 percent were aware of appropriate preventive measures to protect
people from infection (21). The Malaysia survey indicated that 81 percent had good knowledge of
COVID-19, however, there was noticeable confusion among participants regarding transmission of
the virus. Only 43 percent of participants answered correctly when asked if the virus was airborne
and just 36 percent answered correctly when asked if eating and touching wild animals could result
in infection (22). To our knowledge, there have been no published studies from sub-Saharan Africa
to assess KAP toward COVID-19 specifically among community health workers (CHWs).

In Mozambique, CHWs, known locally as agentes polivalentes elementares (APEs), are community
members who are trained to provide basic healthcare services and conduct health promotion
activities in the remote areas in which they live. This includes providing integrated community case
management (iCCM) for malaria, pneumonia and diarrhoea for children aged 2-59 months and, as of
2014, family planning, pregnancy tracking, antenatal and post-partum care. While technical guidance
surrounding COVID-19 surveillance, case definitions and testing strategies are available to support
APEs, communicating this information to the wider APE network has been a significant challenge.
These have been largely due to restrictions on travel and face-to-face group meetings and training,
which were in place from the beginning of April through to the beginning of August, when routine
face-to-face activities were resumed. Other challenges include incorporating COVID-19 surveillance
into existing surveillance networks and diagnosing COVID-19 within the community, due to the
similarity of symptoms with other routinely presented diseases such as malaria and pneumonia.
Furthermore, due to the novelty of COVID-19, the information available globally is constantly
evolving and expanding, and this in turn requires continuous reflection and analysis in terms of the
impact on country strategies and plans. This, combined with limited data on community-level
caseload due to a lack of accessible and affordable tests, poses significant challenges in the APEs’
abilities to conduct their routine activities and support the COVID-19 response. There is need for a
dynamic, rapid response model to effectively support APEs on COVID-19 management.
The upSCALE project, supported by UK AID (via UNICEF), is a continuation of the Bill and Melinda
Gates Foundation supported inSCALE project. It consists of a smartphone app that guides APEs
through patient registration, assists with diagnosis and advises on treatment and referrals (primarily
related to iCCM), and a tablet-based app that allows supervisors to monitor CHW performance and
stock levels. Data entered by APEs through the upSCALE app is visualised in the District Health
Information System (DHIS2) at district, provincial and national levels of Mozambique’s health
system. The app has the potential to analyse local disease-specific trends in near real-time, which
will allow managers to improve their resource allocation. The programme is currently being

implemented in three provinces (Inhambane, Cabo Delgado and Zambézia) with 1,213 APEs and 299
supervisors using the app. The MoH is planning to roll out the platform to 8,800 APES nationally by
2021.
Given the lack of sufficient accurate and up-to-date information on COVID-19, especially in rural
communities, there is a risk of high levels of disinformation, and possible questionable practices. At
the same time, the most up-to-date advice about COVID-19 symptoms (which is constantly changing
as we learn more about the virus) and how to protect community members from getting infected
and infecting others might not reach all community members timely and/or effectively. The use of
the upSCALE app presents a dynamic solution for COVID-19 messaging and tracking, capable of
adapting and expanding messages as new info/ practices arise, also allowing to capture how
communities are adapting to living in a pandemic such as COVID-19. In this study, we investigate the
KAP of APEs who use a digital health platform UpSCALE, in three provinces in Mozambique. This is
the first report on the knowledge, attitude, and practices of these community health workers from
Mozambique. Findings from this study should contribute to the global and local efforts to better
control the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods
To support the COVID-19 response in Mozambique, Malaria Consortium, in partnership with
Ministry of Health and Dimagi, rapidly expanded the upSCALE platform and the use of telemedicine through the use of short message service (SMS), training modules, monitoring of key indicators on
routine services for women and children, stock control and disease surveillance.
A COVID-19 KAP survey was developed and delivered to the APEs via upSCALE from 9 June 2020 to
14 August 2020. The KAP was a cross-sectional study that was sent to all 1,400 upSCALE registered
APEs and involved those who responded to an invitation via SMS message, asking them to complete

the questionnaire on the UPSCALE application. The SMS messages were accompanied by simple
videos demonstrating how to install and complete the KAP survey on the application.
The KAP survey questionnaire (see Annex I) was developed using various references including the
WHO survey tools, guidance on COVID-19 insights and previous KAP surveys conducted during the
pandemic (20, 23, 24). The self-reported and respondent-friendly survey consisted of 10 questions
related to COVID-19 symptoms, prevention and transmission, as well as main sources of information.
The components of the knowledge section included the causes and modes of COVID-19
transmission, main symptoms, transmissibility from asymptomatic patients, individuals at risk and
preventive measures. The attitudes and practices sections were comprised of questions related to
COVID-19 preventive measures practiced, adherence to government prevention measures, barriers
to following recommended measures and what to do when symptoms occur.
From May 1st – September 1st, COVID-19 sensitive SMS messages were sent to the APEs. Initially
rolled out only to those APEs using the upSCALE app. Malaria Consortium recommended to the MoH
that APEs not using the upSCALE app were included in the SMS COVID-19 sensitive messaging
campaign and were sent the same COVID-19 SMS messages. The MoH agreed with this and through
their support and engagement with the regional health teams, 1,000 additional APEs were added to
the SMS deployment database. As of 1st September, a total of 140,895 COVID-19 sensitive SMS
messages have been sent to the APEs.

Results
Of the 1,456 APEs registered with the upSCALE app, 1,065 had operational phones at the time of the
KAP survey and 297 of these completed the questionnaire (28 percent) over a three month period.
Of these, 48 percent were from Cabo Delgado, 11 percent from Inhambane, and 41 percent from
Zambézia. It took the respondents an average of five minutes to complete the survey. Female
respondents made up 24 percent of those who completed the questionnaire.

The largest group of respondents said they had heard of COVID-19 through the local radio (27
percent), which was followed closely by their health facility (26 percent). Approximately 15 percent
said they had heard of COVID-19 through the upSCALE app. A similar proportion (13 percent) had
heard via word of mouth. Newspapers (nine percent) and television (five percent) were also
mentioned. A very small percentage mentioned government websites (two percent) and social
media (1 percent). A few respondents (1 percent) said they had not heard of COVID-19 through any
source.

When looking at combined data from June – August 2020, 25 percent of respondents listed the
correct three main symptoms of COVID-19, and no others (fever, cough and shortness of breath), as
outlined in the Ministry of Health (MoH) guidelines (25). When asked to list all symptoms of COVID19; headache was the most frequently listed symptom (98 percent), followed by fever and dry cough
(both listed by 90 percent of respondents). Shortness of breath was also mentioned by 87 percent of
respondents.
Regarding transmission routes, 16 percent listed the correct combination, according to MoH
guidelines (direct contact with contaminated surfaces, respiratory droplets and direct contact with
an infected person). When asked to list all possible transmission routes, direct contact with
contaminated surfaces and objects was mentioned the most (91 percent), this was followed closely
by direct contact with an infected person (90 percent) and respiratory droplets (89 percent). A large
percentage (86 percent) thought the virus is airborne, and 83 percent mentioned the emptying of

latrines as a source of transmission. When presented with the statement “A person with COVID-19
without any symptoms cannot spread the virus,”41% said it was true.
APEs were asked to list methods of COVID-19 prevention, with 39 percent listing the correct
combination of preventions methods (wash hands, wear a mask, avoid touching your face, cover
your mouth when you cough or sneeze, stay home if you feel unwell and practice social distancing of
1.5 meters). The most frequently listed method of prevention (when asked to list all) was covering
your face while sneezing (97 percent). This was followed closely by staying home if you feel unwell
(93 percent), avoiding touching your face, handwashing and wearing a mask (all mentioned by 92
percent of respondents), and maintaining a physical distance of 1.5 meters (91 percent).
Almost half of the APEs (45 percent) said that the minimum recommended handwashing length was
one minute, followed by 10 seconds (21 percent), 20 seconds (16 percent), and 30 seconds (15
percent).
When asked who was at the greatest risk, less than 2 percent (1.24 percent) of respondents
correctly identified elderly individuals, obese individuals and those with an underlying chronic
illness. Those with chronic illness and obese individual were listed the most frequently (each
mentioned by 98 percent), followed by elderly individuals (97 percent), pregnant women (3 percent)
and children (40 percent).
The next survey question asked participants to list all actions someone should take when COVID-19
symptoms develop, 20 percent of respondents provided the right combination of answers, and
according to government guidelines (self-isolate, get plenty of rest, stay hydrated and take
paracetamol, contact your local health facility, wear a mask, and monitor symptoms regularly).
Overall, self-isolate was included the most (82 percent), followed by wear a face mask (52 percent),
contact your local health facility (48 percent), monitor symptoms regularly (30 percent), get plenty
of rest (28 percent), and stay hydrated and take paracetamol (24 percent).

The majority of respondents (84 percent) said they followed all MoH prevention guidelines at all
times, while 13 percent said they followed only some of the prevention guidelines (with wearing a
mask being the most frequently cited) (Table 4). When asked “What is preventing you from fully
protecting yourself” personal protective equipment (PPE) was mentioned by four percent. However,
lack of PPE decreased over time, with seven percent mentioning it PPE in June, five percent in July
and only two percent in August.

Another output from the KAP survey has been the development and deployment of seven Covid-19
sensitive health education modules, integrated onto upSCALE, including; hand and respiratory
hygiene, safe use and disposal of PPE and waste management. All materials are supported with
multi-media tools, such as training and deployment videos, to improve the technique and practice of
using the COVID-19 elements of UpSCALE. A second KAP survey is planned for November 2020 to
measure change in KAP indicators and evaluate the role of adaptive learning practices alongside
digital health tools, to enhance the capacity of CHWs in this challenging Covid-19 pandemic.

Discussion
Given the timing of the KAP survey at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in Mozambique, during
the first days of lockdown, and the fact that the survey was issued without the ability to provide
training or supervision, the response rate to the survey, at 28 percent, was in-line with other KAP
studies conducted in similar settings and with similar populations in Uganda and Nepal (9, 11).
While it was important to recognise that already 15% of users relied on UpSCALE for their COVID-19
information, local radio and health centres are clearly important sources of information and should
continue to be utilised to communicate COVID-19 education messages. Only a quarter of the

respondents were female, but since only 26 percent of the upSCALE app users are women, this
proportion is to be expected.
There is a high level of knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms and transmission routes among the APEs.
However, only 25 percent selected all correct symptoms and no others, when asked to list all. When
asked to list all transmission routes, many people were able to list individual correct ways of
transmitting the virus but only 16 percent listed the correct combination. A relatively high
proportion (41 percent), lacked knowledge regarding the infectiousness of asymptomatic patients,
this is currently being addressed through SMS messaging and the training modules.
Most of the respondents were able to list appropriate prevention measures. That being said, only 39
percent correctly listed the correct combination of recommended prevention methods. The vast
majority said they are following government prevention guidelines at all times, but further education
is required, e.g. confusion over the correct recommended handwashing length should be dispelled
(only 15 percent correctly said 20 seconds). Misconceptions of those individuals most at risk and
measures for those who develop COVID-19 symptoms are being clarified by the updated SMS
message and digital modules that are delivered weekly via upSCALE. Although many APEs could list
some of the correct measures to take if symptoms occur, just 20 percent gave the correct answer
when asked to list all. Awareness of risk for elderly and those with chronic diseases was high,
however, when asked to list all high-risk groups, a very low proportion (less than two percent)
correctly listed the elderly, obese individuals and those with chronic illnesses as being high risk
groups, and no other groups. A little less than half of the respondents (40 percent) also included
children as a high-risk group.
Although a high percentage of survey participants were able to list some correct COVID-19 related
symptoms, transmission routes and preventions methods, the proportion who answered each
specific question correctly is considerably lower than other KAP surveys conducted among HCWs (811). However, when reviewing the published data it is important to remember that knowledge of

point in a country’s evolution of the pandemic they occurred, making it hard to compare results. This
KAP survey took place during the same time that Mozambique was effectively in lock down and
opportunities for sharing information and increasing knowledge were severely restricted. Different
studies use different cut off points to gauge what constitutes a ‘good’ understanding of COVID-19
and appropriate awareness of prevention and transmission. Furthermore, since this is the only KAP
we are aware of focusing specifically on CHWs, the gap in available data about CHW COIVD-19 KAP
makes comparison among study results with those conducted in other countries or regions even
more challenging. Additional research and information regarding KAP among CHWs are needed to
be able to ensure they are getting the support necessary to effectively assist with their countries
national COVID-19 response plans.
The SMS messaging content was based on WHO COVID-19 guidance, which is still evolving, therefore
the development of these messages is an iterative process, and they are adapted and updated as
guidance changes. The focus of the COVID-19 sensitive SMS messages have been adapted over time,
based on the data flow of responses from the KAP survey, to correct any misconceptions. For
example, SMS messages were sent out to reinforce the need for hand washing for a minimum of 20
seconds, to dispel myths of one minute, and reinforced messaging around the risk of transmission
from asymptomatic populations.
A limitation of this KAP survey required the respondents to respond via the UpSCALE application on
their functioning mobile. This limited the sample size and response rate to the survey. This could
also have led to a certain level of respondent bias, as typically approximately 20% of users have nonfunctioning phones and limited internet access, further biasing responses towards less remote areas.
We have planned to also issue a shorted KAP survey using standard SMS messaging for the second
round of the KAP survey planned for November 2020, to allow more users to respond.

Conclusions
Adaptations to the upSCALE digital platform enabled the ministry of health supported by Malaria
Consortium to rapidly gather essential insight on the COVID-19 knowledge gaps and misconceptions
of APEs and then to help shape and target relevant messages, vital for ensuring a successful COVID19 response. A daily series of SMS messages (currently totally more than 140,000), developed and
shaped by knowledge gaps highlighted through the KAP study, were sent to a total of approximately
2,500 APEs (including all upSCALE app users) to reinforce MoH messaging and dispel misconceptions.
The messages will continue to be sent. This study demonstrates how digital health tools, in this case
the upSCALE app, can be feasibly adapted to support CHWs in the COVID-19 pandemic response.
