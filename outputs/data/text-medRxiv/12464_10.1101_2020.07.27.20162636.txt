ABSTRACT
Background: The current COVID-19 pandemic has led to a surge of research activity.
While this research provides important insights, the multitude of studies results in an increasing
segmentation of information. To ensure comparability across projects and institutions, standard
datasets are needed. Here, we introduce the “German Corona Consensus Dataset” (GECCO), a
uniform dataset that uses international terminologies and health IT standards to improve
interoperability of COVID-19 data.
Methods: Based on previous work (e.g., the ISARIC-WHO COVID-19 case report
form) and in coordination with experts from university hospitals, professional associations and
research initiatives, data elements relevant for COVID-19 research were collected, prioritized
and consolidated into a compact core dataset. The dataset was mapped to international
terminologies, and the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard was used to
define interoperable, machine-readable data formats.
Results: A core dataset consisting of 81 data elements with 281 response options was
defined, including information about, for example, demography, anamnesis, symptoms,
therapy, medications or laboratory values of COVID-19 patients. Data elements and response
options were mapped to SNOMED CT, LOINC, UCUM, ICD-10-GM and ATC, and FHIR
profiles for interoperable data exchange were defined.
Conclusion: GECCO provides a compact, interoperable dataset that can help to make
COVID-19 research data more comparable across studies and institutions. The dataset will be
further refined in the future by adding domain-specific extension modules for more specialized
use cases.

INTRODUCTION
In December 2019, first reports of a cluster of 41 patients infected by a novel
coronavirus emerged from Wuhan, China.1 Within a few months, the new virus, subsequently
named “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” (SARS‑CoV‑2), has spread around
the world causing the global COVID-19 pandemic. Currently (as of July 1, 2020), SARS-CoV2 has infected more than 10 million and killed more than half a million patients worldwide.2
The pandemic has spurred intensive scientific research, including numerous regional,
national and international epidemiological surveys and studies.3–7 While this research provides
important new insights, the multitude of studies threatens to generate a dangerous segmentation
of information. This could delay or even prevent urgently needed scientific knowledge about
SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. To avoid this segmentation of information and make COVID19 data more comparable and exchangeable across studies and institutions, interoperable
datasets are needed.
Various initiatives have started to define uniform datasets and Common Data Elements
(CDEs) for the collection of information about COVID-19. For example, questionnaires and
case report forms (CRFs) have been developed to collect data about COVID-19 patients in a
standardized way.5,8,9 While the CDEs defined in these projects are an important step, they are
not enough to ensure interoperability. To make data syntactically and semantically
interoperable, data elements also have to be embedded in standard data structures that can be
exchanged across IT systems, and they have to use common terminologies that unambiguously
define the meaning of clinical concepts.
To improve interoperability of COVID-19 data, we developed the German Corona
Consensus Dataset (GECCO), which uses international health IT standards and terminologies
for interoperable data exchange. GECCO defines a compact set of data elements to be collected
in COVID-19 studies and was developed within the National Research Network of University

Medicine on COVID-19 (“Nationales Forschungsnetzwerk [NFN] der Universitätsmedizin zu
COVID-19”) funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF). The
following paper provides an overview of the GECCO dataset and its development.
METHODS
Selection of data elements
An initial dataset was compiled as a working basis by merging data elements and
response options of the following projects: the ISARIC-WHO CRF8; the Pa-COVID-19 study10,
which investigates the pathophysiology of COVID-19 in a prospective patient cohort; the
LEOSS case registry3, a clinical patient registry for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2
initiated by the ESCMID Emerging Infections Task Force (EITaF), the German Center for
Infection Research (DZIF) and the German Society for Infectiology (DGI). This draft dataset
was saved in a spreadsheet and sent to members of an expert board for comment and proposal
of additional data elements. The expert board was composed of health professionals from
German university hospitals, professional associations and other relevant organizations. New
data elements proposed by the expert board were added to the dataset for subsequent
prioritization. For the prioritization, the experts were asked to assign a priority value to each
data element of the dataset. Priorities were indicated on a 5-level scale that was loosely based
on the NIH model for CDEs11 (Table 1).

* Since this is a disease-specific (i.e. COVID-19) dataset, both the general and diseasespecific core categories of the NIH were assigned to the highest priority level.

From the data elements with the highest prioritizations, a preliminary core dataset with
roughly 100 data elements was compiled (this size was chosen to include as many relevant data
elements as possible, while keeping the dataset manageable and practical). This core dataset
was then reviewed by an editorial team of seven experts from different disciplines. In
consensual decisions, data elements not considered necessary for the core dataset were
discarded; conversely, data elements that were considered highly important but had not yet been
included in the core dataset were added. The final data elements of the core dataset were
grouped into meaningful categories (e.g., demographics, symptoms or medication). Figure 1
shows the workflow of consensus building and dataset definition.

Standardization
To ensure syntactic and semantic interoperability, elements and response options of the
core dataset were mapped to international standards and terminologies. The following
terminologies and code systems were used: the International Statistical Classification of
Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th revision, German modification (ICD-10-GM)12 for
diagnoses; Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC)13 for laboratory values
and other measurements; the Unified Code for Units of Measure (UCUM)14 for measurement
units; the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System (ATC)15 for active
ingredients of drugs and medications; SNOMED CT16 for diagnoses and other medical
concepts. The annotation of data elements with international terminologies was done using
ART-DECOR17, an open source collaboration platform for experts from medical,
terminological and technical domains aiming on creation and maintenance of datasets with data

element descriptions, use case scenarios, value sets and Health Level 7 (HL7) templates and
profiles.
To define interoperable formats for data exchange, the HL7 standard "Fast Healthcare
Interoperability Resources" (FHIR)18 was used. FHIR builds on a set of “resources”, which
provide generic data structures for common healthcare concepts, such as Patient, Practitioner,
Observation, Medication or Condition. From these resources more specific data structure
definitions, so-called “profiles”, can be defined, which allow for interoperable data exchange
across health IT systems. To ensure interoperability, care was taken to build on previous work
where possible, in particular the FHIR profiles of the German Medical Informatics Initiative19,
the International Patient Summary (IPS)20, the Logica COVID-19 profiles21 and the FHIR base
profiles of HL7 Germany.22 FHIR profiles were defined using Forge23 and published on the
Simplifier platform.24
RESULTS
Combining the initial draft dataset and the additional proposals from the expert board,
702 potentially relevant data elements were collected. From these data elements and based on
the prioritization of the expert board, the editorial team compiled a core dataset consisting of
81 elements with 281 response options. These data elements were grouped into the following
categories: anamnesis / risk factors (n = 16); imaging (n = 2); demographics (n = 7);
epidemiological factors (n = 1); complications (n = 1); onset of illness / admission (n = 1);
laboratory values (n = 25); medication (n = 4); outcome at discharge (n = 3); study enrollment
/ inclusion criteria (n = 2); symptoms (n = 2); therapy (n = 6); vital signs (n = 11) (Figure 2).

dataset as they would have inflated the size of the dataset. The editorial team decided to include
these data elements in domain-specific extension modules, which will be specified in more
detail at later stages of the project.
DISCUSSION
In this report, we presented the GECCO dataset, a core collection of data elements for
acquiring and exchanging information about COVID-19 patients. By using standardized data
structures (HL7 FHIR profiles) and international terminologies, the GECCO dataset is an
important step towards interoperability of COVID-19 research data. It can facilitate harmonized
data collection and analysis across institutions and IT systems, for example in clinical studies,
registries or digital health applications.
A key factor to the successful application of standard datasets like GECCO is a close
collaboration with the scientific community. To ensure a high acceptance of the dataset, the
development of GECCO therefore included clinicians from a wide variety of medical
disciplines and professional associations as well as experts in digital health, standardization and
clinical terminologies. GECCO also collaborates closely with standards developing
organizations such as HL7 and Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) as well as other
initiatives aiming to improve health data interoperability, such as the Medical Informatics
Initiative25, NFDI4Health26 and the Corona Component Standards (cocos)27. Building on this
strong consensus, GECCO-based data collection now has become a requirement for projects
funded by the National Research Network of University Medicine on COVID-19 (NFN).
Although the GECCO dataset was designed to be as compact and manageable as
possible, acquiring and recording the information for all data elements still requires time (for
example, when entering the information in an electronic case report form). Moreover, manual
documentation is prone to transcription errors. Conversely, manually abstracted and structured

information from unstructured health records may provide relevant insights for care-providers
and improve their understanding of risk and outcome. For some of the data items, it is therefore
desirable to automatically exchange data between a GECCO-based study database and existing
IT systems, such as hospital information systems or clinical trial software. This requires
standard interfaces between these systems. The FHIR profiles of the GECCO dataset provide
an interoperable, machine-readable data structure that can facilitate this data exchange across
IT systems.
Scientific knowledge about COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 is changing fast, which may
necessitate modifications to the GECCO dataset in the future. To incorporate new knowledge
into the dataset, the NFN will put a governance framework in place that will coordinate
revisions and extensions to the dataset. Domain-specific extension modules are already in
preparation. Extension modules currently planned are: laboratory, diagnostics, immunology,
gynecology and pregnancy, epidemiology, pediatrics, intensive care, oncology, radiology,
virology, psychiatry and neurology (these extension modules are also accessible on the ARTDECOR platform).
CONCLUSION
The GECCO dataset provides researchers and healthcare professionals with a compact,
interoperable dataset for collecting, exchanging and analyzing COVID-19 data across
institutions and software systems. Developed by a multidisciplinary group of experts, GECCO
builds heavily on international terminologies and IT standards. GECCO can thus help to
improve the harmonization and coordination of research efforts to successfully fight the
COVID-19 pandemic. Future inclusion of domain-specific extension modules will further
expand the use of the GECCO dataset.
