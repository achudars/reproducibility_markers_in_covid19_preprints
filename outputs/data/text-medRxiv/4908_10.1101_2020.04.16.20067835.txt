Key words:​ SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, saliva, diagnostics

Abstract
Rapid and accurate SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing is essential for controlling the ongoing
COVID-19 pandemic. The current gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis is real-time
RT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal swabs. Low sensitivity, exposure
risks to healthcare workers, and global shortages of swabs and personal protective
equipment, however, necessitate the validation of new diagnostic approaches. Saliva is a
promising candidate for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics because (1) collection is minimally
invasive and can reliably be self-administered and (2) saliva has exhibited comparable
sensitivity to nasopharyngeal swabs in detection of other respiratory pathogens, including
endemic human coronaviruses, in previous studies. To validate the use of saliva for
SARS-CoV-2 detection, we tested nasopharyngeal and saliva samples from confirmed
COVID-19 patients and self-collected samples from healthcare workers on COVID-19
wards. When we compared SARS-CoV-2 detection from patient-matched nasopharyngeal
and

consistency throughout the course of infection. Furthermore, we report less variability in
self-sample collection of saliva. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that saliva is a
viable and more sensitive alternative to nasopharyngeal swabs and could enable at-home
self-administered sample collection for accurate large-scale SARS-CoV-2 testing.

Introduction
Efforts to control SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus causing COVID-19 pandemic, depend
on accurate and rapid diagnostic testing. These tests must be (​1​) sensitive to mild and
asymptomatic infections to promote effective self isolation and reduce transmission within
high risk groups​1​; (​2)​ consistent to reliably monitor disease progression and aid clinical
decisions​2​; and (​3)​ scalable to inform local and national public health policies, such as when
social distancing measures can be safely relaxed. However, current SARS-CoV-2 testing
strategies often fail to meet these criteria, in part because of their reliance on
nasopharyngeal swabs as the widely recommended sample type for real-time RT-PCR.
Although nasopharyngeal swabs are commonly used in respiratory virus diagnostics, they
show relatively poor sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection in early infection and are
inconsistent during serial testing​2–6​. Moreover, collecting nasopharyngeal swabs causes
discomfort to patients due to the procedure’s invasiveness, limiting compliance for repeat
testing, and presents a considerable risk to healthcare workers, because it can induce
patients to sneeze or cough, expelling virus particles​7​. The procedure is also not conducive
to large-scale testing, because there are widespread shortages of swabs and personal
protective equipment for healthcare workers​8​, and self-collection of nasopharyngeal swabs
is difficult and less sensitive for virus detection​9​. These challenges will be further
exacerbated as the COVID-19 pandemic intensifies in low income countries. Given the
limitations, a more reliable and less resource-intensive sample collection method, ideally
one that accommodates self-collection in the home, is urgently needed.
Saliva sampling is an appealing alternative to nasopharyngeal swab, since collecting saliva
is non-invasive and easy to self-administer. An analysis of nasopharyngeal and saliva
concordance for RT-PCR detection of respiratory pathogens, including two seasonal
human coronaviruses, suggests comparable diagnostic sensitivity between the two sample
types​10,11​. Preliminary findings indicate that (​1​) SARS-CoV-2 can be detected from the saliva
self-collected saliva samples have comparable
of COVID-19 patients​12 and (​2​)
SARS-CoV-2 detection sensitivity to nasopharyngeal swabs collected by healthcare
workers from mild and subclinical COVID-19 cases​13​. Critically, however, no rigorous
evaluation of the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection in saliva with respect to
nasopharyngeal swabs has been conducted from inpatients during the course of COVID-19
infection.
In this study, we evaluated SARS-CoV-2 detection in paired nasopharyngeal swabs and
saliva samples collected from COVID-19 inpatients and asymptomatic healthcare workers
at moderate-to-high risk of COVID-19 exposure. Our results indicate that using saliva for
SARS-CoV-2 detection is more sensitive and consistent than using nasopharyngeal swabs.
Overall, we demonstrate that saliva should be considered as a reliable sample type to
alleviate COVID-19 testing demands.

Results
Higher SARS-CoV-2 titers detected from saliva than nasopharyngeal swabs from
inpatients
To determine if saliva performs as well as the U.S. CDC recommendation of using
nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics, we collected clinical samples from 44
COVID-19 inpatient study participants (​Table 1​). This cohort represents a range of
COVID-19 patients with severe disease, with 19 (43%) requiring intensive care, 10 (23%)
requiring mechanical ventilation, and 2 (5%) deceased as of April 5th, 2020. Using the U.S.
CDC SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay, we tested 121 self-collected saliva or healthcare
worker-administered nasopharyngeal swabs from this cohort. We found strong
concordance between the U.S. CDC “N1” and “N2” primer-probe sets (​Extended Data Fig.
1​), and thus calculated virus titers (virus copies/mL) using only the “N1” set. From all
positive samples tested (​n ​= 46 nasopharyngeal, 37 saliva), we found that the geometric
mean virus titers from saliva were about 5⨉ higher than nasopharyngeal swabs (​p < 0.05,
Mann-Whitney test; ​Fig. 1a​). When limiting our analysis to only patient-matched
nasopharyngeal and saliva samples (​n = 38 for each sample type), we found that
SARS-CoV-2 titers from saliva were significantly higher than nasopharyngeal swabs (​p =
0.0001, Wilcoxon test; ​Fig. 1b​). Moreover, we detected SARS-CoV-2 from the saliva but not
the nasopharyngeal swabs from eight matching samples (21%), while we only detected
SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal swabs and not saliva from three matched samples (8%;
Fig. 1c​). Overall, we found higher SARS-CoV-2 titers from saliva than nasopharyngeal
swabs from hospital inpatients.

Figure 1. SARS-CoV-2 titers are higher in the saliva than nasopharyngeal swabs from hospital
inpatients. (​a​) All positive nasopharyngeal swabs (​n = 46) and saliva samples (​n = 39) were
compared by a Mann-Whitney test (​p < 0.05). Bars represent the median and 95% CI. Our assay
detection limits for SARS-CoV-2 using the US CDC “N1” assay is at cycle threshold 38, which
corresponds to 5,610 virus copies/mL of sample (shown as dotted line and grey area). (​b​) Patient
matched samples (​n = 38), represented by the connecting lines, were compared by a Wilcoxon test
test (​p < 0.05). (​c​) Patient matched samples (​n = 38) are also represented on a scatter plot. All of the
data used to generate this figure, including the raw cycle thresholds, can be found in
Supplementary Data 1​. ​Extended Data Fig. 1 shows the correlation between US CDC assay “N1”
and “N2” results.

Less temporal SARS-CoV-2 variability when testing saliva from inpatients
As temporal SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing from nasopharyngeal swabs is reported to be
variable​2,3​, we tested longitudinal nasopharyngeal and saliva samples from inpatients to
determine which sample type provided more consistent results. From 22 participants with
multiple nasopharyngeal swabs and 12 participants with multiple saliva samples, we found
that SARS-CoV-2 titers generally decreased in both sample types following the reported
date of symptom onset (​Fig. 2a​). Our nasopharyngeal swab results are consistent with
previous reports of variable SARS-CoV-2 titers and results​2,3​: we found 5 instances where a
participant’s nasopharyngeal swab was negative for SARS-CoV-2 followed by a positive
result during the next collection (5/33 repeats, 33%; ​Fig. 2b)​ . In longitudinal saliva
collections from 12 patients, however, there were no instances in which a sample tested
negative and was later followed by a positive result. As true negative test results are
important for clinicians to track patient improvements and for decisions regarding
discharges, our data suggests that saliva is a more consistent sample type than
nasopharyngeal swabs for monitoring temporal changes in SARS-CoV-2 titers.

sample (shown as dotted line and grey area). (​b​) The data are also shown by sampling moment
(sequential collection time) to highlight the differences in virus titers between collection points. All of
the data used to generate this figure, including the raw cycle thresholds, can be found in
Supplementary Data 1​.

More consistent self-sampling from healthcare workers using saliva
Validating saliva for the detection of subclinical SARS-CoV-2 infections could prove
transformative for both remote patient diagnostics and healthcare worker surveillance. To
investigate this, we enrolled 98 asymptomatic healthcare workers into our study and
collected saliva and/or nasopharyngeal swabs on average every 2.9 days (range = 1-8 days,
Table 2​). To date, we have detected SARS-CoV-2 in saliva from two healthcare workers
who were negative by nasopharyngeal swabs using both the US CDC “N1” and “N2” tests
and did not report any symptoms. The saliva from one of these individuals again tested
positive alongside a matching negative nasopharyngeal swab upon repeat testing 2 days
later. Virus titers from asymptomatic healthcare workers’ saliva are lower than what we
typically detect from symptomatic inpatients (​Fig. 3a​), which likely supports the lack of
symptoms.
Our limited data supports that saliva may be more sensitive for detecting asymptomatic or
pre-symptomatic infections; however, a larger sample size is needed to confirm. As
nasopharyngeal swab sampling inconsistency may be one of the potential issues for false
negatives (​Fig. 2​), monitoring an internal control for proper sample collection, human RNase
P, may provide an alternative evaluation technique. While human RNase P detection was

better from saliva in both the inpatient and healthcare worker cohorts (​Fig. 3b)​ , this alone
may not indicate better virus detection. More importantly, we found that human RNase P
detection was more variable from nasopharyngeal swabs collected from inpatients (​p =
0.0001, F test for variances) and self-collected from healthcare workers (​p = 0.0002; ​Fig.
3b​). Our results suggest that saliva may also be an appropriate, and perhaps more
sensitive, alternative to nasopharyngeal swabs for screening asymptomatic or
pre-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections.

Discussion
Our study demonstrates that saliva is a viable and preferable alternative to nasopharyngeal
swabs for SARS-CoV-2 detection. We found that the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection

from saliva is comparable, if not superior to nasopharyngeal swabs in early hospitalization
and is more consistent during extended hospitalization and recovery. Moreover, the
detection of SARS-CoV-2 from the saliva of two asymptomatic healthcare workers despite
negative matched nasopharyngeal swabs suggests that saliva may also be a viable
alternative for identifying mild or subclinical infections. With further validation, widespread
implementation of saliva sampling could be transformative for public health efforts: saliva
self-collection negates the need for direct healthcare worker-patient interaction, a source of
several major testing bottlenecks and overall nosocomial infection risk​14–16​, and alleviates
supply demands on swabs and personal protective equipment.
As SARS-CoV-2 viral loads differ between mild and severe cases​17​, a limitation of our study
is the primary focus on COVID-19 inpatients, many with severe disease. While more data
are required to more rigorously compare the efficacy of saliva in the hospital setting to
earlier in the course of infection, findings from two recent studies support its potential for
detecting SARS-CoV-2 from both asymptomatic individuals and outpatients​13,18​. As
infectious virus has been detected from the saliva of COVID-19 patients​12​, ascertaining the
relationship between virus genome copies and infectious virus particles in the saliva of
pre-symptomatic individuals​19 will play a key role in understanding the dynamics of
asymptomatic transmission​1,20​.
Stemming from the promising results for SARS-CoV-2 detection in asymptomatic
individuals​13​, a saliva SARS-CoV-2 detection assay has already gained approval through the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration emergency use authorization​18​. To meet the growing
testing demands, however, our findings support the need for immediate validation and
implementation of saliva for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics in certified clinical laboratories.

Methods
Ethics
All study participants were enrolled and sampled in accordance to the Yale University
HIC-approved protocol #2000027690. Demographics, clinical data and samples were only
collected after the study participant had acknowledged that they had understood the study
protocol and signed the informed consent. All participant information and samples were
collected in association with study identifiers.
Participant enrollment
Inpatients
Patients admitted to Yale New Haven Hospital (a 1541-bed tertiary care medical center in
New Haven, CT, USA), who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal and/or
oropharyngeal swab (CDC approved assay) were invited to enroll in the research study.
Exclusion criteria were age under 18 years, non-English speaking and clinical, radiological
or laboratory evidence for a non-infectious cause of fever or respiratory symptoms or a
microbiologically-confirmed infectious source (e.g. gastrointestinal, urinary, cardiovascular)
other than respiratory tract for symptoms and no suspicion for COVID-19 infection.

Healthcare workers
Asymptomatic healthcare workers (e.g., without fever or respiratory symptoms) with
occupational exposure to patients with COVID-19 were invited to enroll in the study. Study
participation enabled active surveillance to ensure early detection following exposure and to
further protect other healthcare workers and patients.
Sample collection
Inpatients
Nasopharyngeal and saliva samples were obtained every three days throughout their
clinical course. Nasopharyngeal samples were taken by registered nurses using the BD
universal viral transport (UVT) system. The flexible, mini-tip swab was passed through the
patient's nostril until the posterior nasopharynx was reached, left in place for several
seconds to absorb secretions then slowly removed while rotating. The swab was placed in
the sterile viral transport media (total volume 3 mL) and sealed securely. Saliva samples
were self-collected by the patient. Upon waking, patients were asked to avoid food, water
and brushing of teeth until the sample was collected. Patients were asked to repeatedly spit
into a sterile urine cup until roughly a third full of liquid (excluding bubbles), before securely
closing it. All samples were stored at room temperature and transported to the research lab
at the Yale School of Public Health within 5 hours of sample collection.
Healthcare workers
Healthcare workers were asked to collect a self-administered nasopharyngeal swab and a
saliva sample every three days for a period of 2 weeks. Samples were stored at +4°C until
being transported to the research lab.
SARS-CoV-2 detection
On arrival at the research lab, total nucleic acid was extracted from 300 µl of viral transport
media from the nasopharyngeal swab or 300 µl of whole saliva using the MagMAX
Viral/Pathogen Nucleic Acid Isolation kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) following the
manufacturer's protocol and eluted into 75 µl of elution buffer. For SARS-CoV-2 RNA
detection, 5 µl of RNA template was tested as previously described​21,22​, using the US CDC
real-time RT-PCR primer/probe sets for 2019-nCoV_N1 and 2019-nCoV_N2 and the human
RNase P (RP) as an extraction control. Samples were classified as positive for SARS-CoV-2
when both N1 and N2 primer-probe sets were detected <38 C​T​. Virus copies were
quantified using a 10-fold dilution standard curve of RNA transcripts that we previously
generated​21​. As results from N1 and N2 were comparable (​Extended Data Fig. 1​), all virus
copies are shown as calculated using the N1 primer-probe set.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were conducted in GraphPad Prism 8.0.0 as described in the Results.
