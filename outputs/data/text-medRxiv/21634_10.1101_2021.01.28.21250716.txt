Abstract
COVID-19 vaccination acceptance has a key role in mitigating the pandemic. Concern has been
raised that vaccination rates will be limited in demographically defined areas of lower income.
Israel’s rapid vaccination campaign may allow to assess these assumptions in real-world and to
devise tools for effectively focusing the vaccination efforts. We analyzed the correlation between
COVID-19 vaccination rates, socioeconomic status (SES) and active COVID-19 disease burden.
We carried out a nationwide study, based on data provided by Ministry of Health of COVID-19
vaccination rates in all municipalities in Israel up to January 12th, 2021. Municipal Vaccination
rates of population older than 60 significantly correlated with the socioeconomic status (r=0.83,
95% confidence interval [0.79 to 0.87]). Finally, we established a novel metric for focusing the
vaccination efforts based on % vaccinations and active disease burden. In Israel, a case-model
country for COVD-19 vaccinations, vaccination rates were strongly correlated with SES. The
study findings demonstrate the need to directly target vaccination acceptance to socioeconomically disadvantaged populations and suggest potential tools for policymakers to focus
their efforts.

Introduction

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in the mortality of over 2
million people worldwide and has become a leading cause of death in adults1. The rapid
development of COVID-19 vaccines provides new hopes regarding our ability to battle the
pandemic2-4. However, while the approval and availability of COVID-19 vaccinations is
progressing around the globe, the pandemic is reaching a calamitous scale and overwhelming
health care systems capabilities. Therefore, the limited roll-out of vaccinations relative to the
COVID-19 burden mandates prioritization of the vaccination effort5. Moreover, prior survey
studies suggested that vaccination rates may be diminished in among demographically defined
groups with lower education and income levels6. Currently, Israel, a highly heterogenous
country, leads the global effort for vaccinating its population making it a suitable case study for
other countries as they form their vaccination strategies7. Many countries adopted strategies
based on prioritizing elderly people as they are at the greatest risk for severe COVID-19 related
disease and mortality. In Israel, people over the age of 60, together with healthcare personnel
entrenched in the disease frontlines, were thus the first to be offered the vaccine8.

Elderly people, at greatest risk for COVID-19 related mortality and morbidity, from
municipalities with a lower socioeconomic status (SES) may suffer from lower availability of
healthcare resources, leading to poorer health and lower acceptance of public healthcare
measures such as vaccines9. Concurrently, some of these populations at low SES and of rural
locations are more severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel and worldwide10-12.
The overarching hypothesis of our research is that population with a lower SES are subject to a
double hit risk in the setting of the current pandemic, a higher rate of contagious disease coupled
with a lower rate of vaccination

Methods

Study population

All residents in Israel enjoy medical coverage by law, provided by four health maintenance
organizations (HMOs). All HMOs use electronic medical records and provide COVID-19 related
data and vaccination information to the Israeli Ministry of Health. The study population
consisted of nationally anonymized and aggregated data provided by the Ministry of Health.
Data Preparation
The Socioeconomic status
The SES scoring was based on the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics (ICBS) scoring system.
Accordingly, each place of residence, obtained from the Israeli Ministry of Interior, is ranked
from lowest to highest SES. The score stratifies all municipalities into 10 decile groups,
according to multiple variables that might affect SES, such as age distribution, level of
unemployment, and available work force, education (the proportion of undergraduate students
and those entitled to a high school diploma), average income per capita, and the proportion that
receives income support. The SES data were processed from ICBS SES report 2017
[https://www.cbs.gov.il/he/mediarelease/doclib/2020/403/24_20_403t1.xlsx] and the rank of
each municipality was used. The population data by age group in each municipality 2019
[https://www.cbs.gov.il/he/publications/doclib/2017/population_madaf/population_madaf_2019_
1.xlsx] was taken from ICBS. Given that municipality’s population was updated two years ago,
in some extreme cases the number of vaccinated persons over the age of 60 (currently counted) is
higher than that found in the municipality’s population.
COVID-19 Vaccination rates and active disease burden
Data of active COVID-19 cases for each municipality was derived from the municipalities table
in COVID-19 database of the Israeli Ministry of Health (MOH) [https://data.gov.il/dataset/covid19]. First dose vaccinations by municipality and age group data were derived from a status
report published by the Israeli MOH on the 13th of January 2021

people aged>16 were deemed eligible to be vaccinated. In the provided data by the Israeli MOH,
values between 1 to 14 cases/vaccinations in a municipality were marked as ‘<15’ without
indicating the exact number, due to privacy requirements. In those cases, missing data imputation
was performed by replacing ‘<15’ with the lower bound of 1.
The active cases and vaccination data were reported in 279 municipalities in Israel. SES was
reported in 196 out of the 279 municipalities. Vaccinations of people over the age of 60 were
aggregated out of 4 age groups (‘60-69’, ‘70-79’, ‘80-89’, ‘90+’). We filtered out the
municipalities that had more than 1 sub-group with missing data (‘<15’) – and accordingly a
total of 12 municipalities were filtered out. Hence, our analysis was performed using data of 183
municipalities in Israel. Color coding of municipalities was conducted by ranking the relevant
metric according to percentiles. The lower 20 and upper 80 percentile were color-coded in red
and green, respectively. Color coding was spectrally determined according to the relevant
percentile.
The VNR
To characterize the association between the COVID-19 active case burden, and the vaccination
rates of the population older than 60, we devised the vaccination need ratio (VNR). VNR is
calculated by dividing the total number of active cases (per 10,000 people) by the rate of
vaccination of the population over 60 in a given municipality (m)

We then examined the association between the municipal SES to the VNR. Finally, we colorcoded the municipalities according to the VNR metric where municipalities at top 20 percentiles
of VNR were coded in red (e.g. high number of active cases per 10,000 people and low rates of
vaccination) and those in the bottom 20 percentiles were coded in green with range spectral
coding of all other municipalities, accordingly. We applied our findings to create a heatmap.

Statistical analysis
The correlation was analyzed by using a weighted Pearson correlation (according to the
municipality population over 60 from the total population over 60 from the evaluated
municipalities) and the confidence interval was calculated using a bootstrapping method with an
alpha of 0.95. Basic arithmetic calculations were conducted using Python Pandas and NumPy.
Statistical analysis was done using Python SciPy.

Results

To assess whether the vaccination rates were related to SES, we evaluated the correlation
between SES rank and vaccination rates in the at-risk population (aged over 60). Vaccination
rates strongly correlated with SES municipality (r=0.83, 95% confidence interval [0.79 to 0.87])
as shown on Figure 1. Assessment of the correlation between the burden of total active cases (per
10,000 people) in a municipality and the vaccination rate of population over 60, identified a
significant negative correlation (r=-0.47, 95% confidence interval [-0.59 to -0.30]) as displayed
in Figure 2.

The record levels of COVID-19 cases mandates harnessing the vaccination efforts as a
mitigation tool. To further focus the vaccination efforts, beyond the prioritization based on age,
we established the vaccination need ratio (VNR). The VNR aid in highlighting municipalities
with high active COVID-19 case burden and low vaccination rates. Importantly, we identified a
significant negative correlation between VNR and SES (r=-0.80, 95% confidence interval [-0.88

to -0.66]), further supporting the need to directly target the vaccination efforts to socioeconomically disadvantaged populations.

To assess the geographical dispersion of the VNR across the country, we generated a colorcoded heatmap that portrays the VNR ranges between different municipalities (Figure 3). The
generated map demonstrated high VNR in northern Israel, the seam zones and municipalities
heavily populated with minorities.

Discussion
The detrimental prices inflicted by the COVID-19 pandemic necessitate rapid and effective
vaccinations of all at-risk populations across the spectrum of all socioeconomic backgrounds to
prevent severe morbidity and mortality while reducing the disease burden on health care systems.
Israel employs a rapid and robust vaccination effort and as of 29th of January has the highest
percentage of vaccinated population, making it a case study for other nations worldwide. In the
current analysis, we identified a significant correlation between municipal vaccination rates and
socioeconomic status. Also, we demonstrated that municipalities with a high current COVID-19
disease burden had a lower rate of vaccination of the elderly population. The metric established,
the vaccination need ratio (VNR), was found to strongly correlate with the municipal SES.
Finally, we generated a heatmap highlighting areas of high VNR, allowing us to outline the need
for vaccination in a geographical context and assisting policymakers in avoiding pockets of high
COVID-19 morbidity and low immunity.

We found that municipalities with a lower SES, often populated with ethnic minorities in
Israel, suffer from a higher disease burden, yet their at-risk population has not been vaccinated
against COVID-19 in the targeted rates. In Israel, like other countries, populations from lower

SES and minorities suffer from lower accessibility and availability to healthcare resources as
well as cultural barriers. This leads to a reduced willingness to actively partake in recommended
public health measures (social distancing, compliance to mask-wearing), putting these
populations at an increased risk for COVID-19 infection during the pandemic. These
socioeconomic gaps may be overemphasized given the introduction of a vaccine based on novel
mRNA technology that may raise objection and safety concerns.

The main strength of our study is due to the nationwide availability of COVID-19
aggregated data of an ethnically heterogenous population thus making our findings generalizable
to other countries. Second, the timeliness of our findings is of temporal relevance and our
analysis was conducted prior to initiation of the protective effects of the vaccines expected to
further widen the differences between municipalities with low and high SES. Third, a national
diagnostic effort (a rate of over 12 tests/day per 1,000 people) coupled with real-time monitoring
of the vaccination rates allow for a timely and accurate derivation of the VNR scoring system.
The national data is dynamically updated on our website (https://vaccinations.covid19maps.org/)
enabling policymakers to track the effect of their actions.
Our findings have limitations. The SES is calculated differently in each country, though
the national ICBS classification correlative with metabolic disease13 making our findings
generalizable. Also, in this study it is used as an ecological variable and is not indicative of
individual health, yet this is a more appropriate representation of its implication on municipal
vaccination. We did not have available data regarding active disease burden of population over
60, or the disease severity of active cases within municipalities. As data were aggregated we did
not have available personal data regarding COVID-19 risk factors, though older age is the most
important risk factor for severe COVID-1914. Finally, we were not able to remove the population

aged over 60 who recovered or died from COVID-19 from the vaccination potential population
in each municipality, though Israel has suffered from approximately 4,000 COVID-19 related
deaths only, with approximately 5% of the population recovered from the disease hence this does
not affect our findings. These data are an interim analysis based on the rates of the first dose of
vaccination, and data of 2nd vaccination shot compliance are not yet available. The analysis time
point, conducted 3 weeks following the initiation of vaccinations in Israel, aims at evaluating
vaccination rollout and distribution as well as compliance and does not intend to evaluate
vaccination efficacy in mitigating the pandemic. Moreover, as the mRNA vaccine logistics
mandate unique temperature control and careful mobilization, our findings may be of limited
relevance to countries electing to vaccinate with more durable vaccine forms. Finally, the small
country size, the organized healthcare system, and the unique ethnic makeup affect the
vaccination compliance of the population.

Of note, the vaccine availability in Israel was equal between different municipalities, and
vaccination is free to all citizens. When faced with monetary and insurance barriers to healthcare
which may exist in other countries, the need to directly target socio-economically disadvantaged
populations is even more urgent. Our work, is the first to confirm, in a real-world settings that
prior concerns raised regarding vaccination acceptance in lower SES were warranted and should
be addressed accordingly. In conclusion, we found a significant correlation between the
municipal SES and the vaccination rates of at-risk populations. We also point to a negative
correlation between active disease burden and vaccination rates of these populations. As the
initial vaccine rollout is limited, case numbers are spiking and more infectious COVID-19 strains
are emerging, we urge policymakers to emphasize efforts of vaccination in municipalities with
lower SES while using the suggested novel, metric, the VNR, to target the vaccination efforts.
