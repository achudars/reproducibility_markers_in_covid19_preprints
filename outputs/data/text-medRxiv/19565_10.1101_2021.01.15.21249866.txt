ABSTRACT

33

Background

34

As the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic accelerates, the supply of personal protective equipment remains under

35

strain. To combat shortages, re-use of surgical masks and filtering facepiece respirators has been

36

recommended. Prior decontamination is paramount to the re-use of these typically single-use only

37

items and, without compromising their integrity, must guarantee inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 and

38

other contaminating pathogens.

39
40

Aim

41

We provide information on the effect of time-dependent passive decontamination at room temperature

42

and evaluate inactivation of a SARS-CoV-2 surrogate and a non-enveloped model virus as well as

43

mask and respirator integrity following active multiple-cycle vaporised hydrogen peroxide (VHP),

44

ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI), and dry heat (DH) decontamination.

45
46

Methods

47

Masks and respirators, inoculated with infectious porcine respiratory coronavirus or murine norovirus,

48

were submitted to passive decontamination or single or multiple active decontamination cycles;

49

viruses were recovered from sample materials and viral titres were measured via TCID50 assay. In

50

parallel, filtration efficiency tests and breathability tests were performed according to EN standard

51

14683 and NIOSH regulations.

52
53

Results and Discussion

54

Infectious porcine respiratory coronavirus and murine norovirus remained detectable on masks and

55

respirators up to five and seven days of passive decontamination. Single and multiple cycles of VHP-,

56

UVGI-, and DH were shown to not adversely affect bacterial filtration efficiency of masks. Single-

57

and multiple UVGI did not adversely affect respirator filtration efficiency, while VHP and DH

58

induced a decrease in filtration efficiency after one or three decontamination cycles. Multiple cycles of

59

VHP-, UVGI-, and DH slightly decreased airflow resistance of masks but did not adversely affect

60

respirator breathability. VHP and UVGI efficiently inactivated both viruses after five, DH after three,

61

decontamination cycles, permitting demonstration of a loss of infectivity by more than three orders of

62

magnitude. This multi-disciplinal approach provides important information on how often a given PPE

63

item may be safely reused.

INTRODUCTION

66

As the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic accelerates, the

67

supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) remains under severe strain. In particular, the surging

68

global demand for disposable surgical face masks (SMs) and filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs),

69

identified as incremental for source control and prevention of onward transmission from infected

70

individuals (SMs) and protection of health-care personnel during aerosol-generating procedures and

71

support treatments (FFRs) (1–4), by far exceeds current manufacturing capacities.

72
73

To combat critical shortages, and in a departure from the prevailing culture of throwaway living (5)

74

and a shift towards an eco-efficient circular economy within the healthcare industry (6), repeated re-

75

use of typically single-use only items has been recommended (1,2,7,8). Prior decontamination is

76

paramount to safe PPE re-use; SM and FFR reprocessing techniques must guarantee not only the

77

complete inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 and other contaminating respiratory or oral human pathogens

78

(the US Food and Drug Administration recommends a robust proof of infectious bioburden reduction

79

of three orders of magnitude for viral pathogens (9)), but must do so without compromising the

80

integrity of the items themselves.

81
82

In the context of a limited re-use strategy, CDC-issued reccommendations include storage of SMs or

83

FFRs at room temperature (in a breathable paper bag) for a minimum period of five days of passive

84

decontamination prior to re-use (10). However, SARS-CoV-2 room temperature survival rates have

85

been subject to much debate, with earlier reports of an only short persistence (three or four days on

86

porous and non-porous surfaces, respectively (11,12)) succeeded by more recent ones of significantly

87

longer viability (21 days on PPE (13) and up to 28 days on various common surfaces (14)). While

88

reported differences are likely dependent on multiple variables, including fluctuations in ambient

89

temperature, relative humidity, light influx, and virus input, they certainly also reflect differences in

90

the surfaces or carrier matrices themselves (15), necessitating targeted assays to evaluate and mitigate

91

the individual risk of transmission via fomites in general and SMs or FFRs in particular.

92
93

Various studies have investigated active SM or FFR decontamination with regard to either biocidal

94

efficacy (modelled utilising a wide range of organisms and matrices) (12,16) or the impact of repeat

95

cycles on functional performance of SMs or FFRs (8,17–20). Few studies, however, offer a

96

consolidated data set examining both viral inactivation as well as SM and FFR integrity subsequent to

97

multiple-cycle decontamination (21). Current recommendations governing SM and FFR re-use are

98

thus based on extrapolations from various sources describing assays performed under vastly differing

99

experimental conditions and necessarily include not inconsiderable degrees of uncertainty (22–24).

101

Amongst the various SM or FFR reprocessing techniques under investigation, vaporised hydrogen

102

peroxide (VHP), an industry standard chemical decontaminant implemented in medical-,

103

pharmaceutical-, and research facilities, has garnered attention as a cost-effective and practical option

104

for SM and FFR decontamination (8,9,17,21,22,25).

105

ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) (18,19) and the application of dry heat (DH) (12,18), have

106

further shown promise as SM or FFR reprocessing techniques.

Two physical decontamination methods,

107
108

We previously demonstrated efficient single-cycle VHP, UVGI, and DH decontamination of SMs and

109

FFRs inoculated with two in vitro cultivable BSL2 pathogens. Inactivation of the infectious SARS-

110

CoV-2 surrogate porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) (26–30) demonstrated virucidal activity of

111

all three methods against enveloped coronaviruses (31); decontamination of hardier non-enveloped

112

human respiratory or oral pathogens, which can equally contaminate SMs or FFRs (9,32), was

113

investigated using the notoriously tenacious murine norovirus model (MuNoV) (33–36).

114
115

Here we verify PRCV and MuNoV survivability rates on SMs and FFRs and investigate multiple-

116

cycle active decontamination of coronavirus- or norovirus-inoculated SMs and FFRs, demonstrating

117

that VHP, UVGI, and DH efficiently inactivate both viruses after several rounds of decontamination,

118

all three methods inducing a loss of viral infectivity by more than three orders of magnitude in line

119

with the FDA guidelines (9). In addition, an investigation into filtration efficiency and breathability of

120

treated face coverings demonstrated that the cumulative use of UVGI, VHP, or DH did not adversely

121

affect SM integrity following up to five decontamination cycles. Similarly, FFRs retained their

122

integrity subsequent to five iterations of UVGI or VHP treatment; DH, however, was found to

123

significantly alter the characteristics of FFRs when exceeding three decontamination rounds. Our

124

multi-disciplinal, consolidated approach, wherein both virus inactivation and SM and FFR integrity

125

are investigated subsequent to multiple decontamination cycles, provides important information on

126

how often a given PPE item may be safely reused. This data provides a measure of security to health-

127

care personnel and the general public; it can help close the currently existing gap between PPE supply

128

and demand and can contribute to the development of circular economy policies in a post-Covid-19

129

era healthcare sector.

137

All FFRs and SMs were verified to be from the same respective manufacturing lot. Manufacturers

138

(and models): KN95 FFR - Guangzhou Sunjoy Auto Supplies CO. LTD, Guangdong, China (2020

139

N°26202002240270); surgical mask (Type II) - Hangzhou Sunten Textile Co., LTD, Hangzhou, China

140

(SuninCare™, Protect Plus).

141
142
143

Decontamination techniques
Vaporised hydrogen peroxide

144

Surgical masks, FFRs and a chemical indicator were placed in individual Mylar/Tyvek pouches.

145

Vaporous hydrogen peroxide treatment was performed with the V-PRO Max Sterilizer (Steris, Mentor,

146

OH) which uses 59% liquid hydrogen peroxide to generate vapor. A 28-minute non lumen cycle

147

consisted of 2 min 40 sec conditioning (5 g/min), 19 min 47 sec decontamination (2.2 g/min) and 7

148

min 46 sec aeration, with a peak VHP concentration of 750 ppm.

149
150

Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation

151

Surgical masks and FFRs were individually irradiated using a LS-AT-M1 (LASEA Company, Sart

152

Tilman, Belgium) equipped with 4 UV-C lamps of 5.5W (@UV-C). Hung vertically on a metal frame,

153

masks and FFRs were inserted into a safety enclosure. A 2 min UV-C treatment (surgical masks) led

154

to a fluence of 2.6J/cm² per mask (1.3J/cm² per side). Power and irradiation time (120 s) were

155

monitored and recorded throughout. Following irradiation, surgical masks and FFRs were unloaded

156

and placed in individual bags.

157
158

Dry heat

159

Surgical masks and FFRs hung horizontally on a metal frame were inserted into an electrically heated

160

vessel (M-Steryl, AMB Ecosteryl Company, Mons, Belgium) for 60 min (± 15 min) of heat treatment

161

at 102°C (± 4°C) following the “Guidance for the reprocessing of SMs and FFRs during the

162

coronavirus disease (COVID-19) Public Health Emergency” by the Belgian Federal Agency for

163

Medicines and Health Products. Temperatures inside the heated vessel were recorded throughout to

164

ensure correct exposure conditions. After termination of the treatment cycle, masks and FFRs were

165

allowed to cool and then bagged individually.

166
167

Surgical mask integrity testing

168

Integrity of decontaminated SMs was determined via initial macroscopic observation followed by EN

169

14683 standard filtration efficiency and breathability tests. Three SMs were used to analyse bacterial

170

filtration efficiency (BFE), five to measure breathability.

173

All SM performance testing was carried out at the Centexbel Textile Research Centre (Belgium). An

174

initial visual inspection of SMs was carried out to verify their integrity; particular attention was paid to

175

potential signs of degradation such as discoloration or deformation.

176
177

SMs - Bacterial filtration efficiency

178

BFE employs a ratio of upstream bacterial challenge to downstream residual concentration to

179

determine filtration efficiency of SM materials against droplets. It is a required quantitative test

180

method for SM clearance by the United States FDA and the European Medical Device Directive

181

93/42/EEC (BFE ≥ 98% according to EN 14683 for Type II and ASTM F2100 for Level 2 SMs).

182

Briefly, SMs were conditioned at 85 ± 5 % relative humidity and 21 ± 5 °C prior to testing. BFE was

183

measured using unneutralized Staphylococcus aureus bacteria contained within an aerosol droplet with

184

a mean particle size of 3 µm diameter. The aerosol sample was drawn through an unfolded SM

185

clamped to the top of a 6-stage Andersen impactor with agar plates for collection of the bacteria

186

particles at a flow rate of 28.3 L/min for 1 min as per FDA guidance and ASTM F2101 method

187

(challenge level of 1500 and 3000 colony-forming units (CFU) per test). Following removal and

188

incubation of the culture plates, colonies were counted to determine total CFU and BFE. A positive

189

control without a test filter sample clamped into the system was used to determine the number of

190

viable particles used per test. A negative control with no bacteria in the airstream was performed to

191

determine the background challenge in the glass aerosol chamber prior to testing.

192
193

SMs - Breathability

194

Breathability of SMs, defined as the measure of differential pressure required to draw air through a

195

measured surface area at a constant air flow rate, was measured according to EN 14683 +

196

AC:2019 (breathability < 40 Pa/cm2 for Type I and II; < 60 Pa/cm2 for Type IIR) (37). Briefly, a

197

constant airflow of 8 L/min was applied through a 25 mm diameter holder (4.9 cm2 total surface area

198

at orifice) to a SM test specimen. A mass flow controller was used to measure the flow rate and the the

199

air exchange pressure of the SM material was measured using two manometers positioned upstream

200

and downstream of the airflow. Measurements were performed on five SMs and five different

201

locations per unfolded mask (top left, top right, bottom left, bottom right, and middle). The differential

202

pressure per mask, expressed in Pa/cm2 and obtained by dividing pressure difference by surface area,

203

was reported as the average of all twenty-five measurements (5 measurements per mask; 5 masks

204

tested).

206

Filtering facepiece respirator integrity testing

207

In the field of protective equipment, the nomenclature and standardisation pertaining to FFRs and their

208

accreditation differ from one continent to another and even from one country to another. FFRs are

209

generally referred to as FFP masks in Europe, KN95s in China, and N95s in the United States; the EN

149 + A1:2009 standard (primarily) and an ISO 16900 standard (to a lesser extent) are applied in

211

Europe, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) procedures are invoked in the

212

United States. While the different methods do not always have the same standardisation limits, the

213

utilised techniques are generally the same. In the present study, FFR filtration efficiency and

214

breathability tests were performed following NIOSH procedures. Three FFRs were used per test

215

condition (assays performed in triplicate).

216
217

FFRs - Macroscopic observation

218

All FFR performance testing was carried out at the Nelson Laboratories (USA). An initial visual

219

inspection of FFRs was carried out to verify their integrity; particular attention was paid to potential

220

signs of degradation such as discoloration or deformation.

221
222

FFRs - NaCl filtration efficiency

223

FFR filtration efficiency was measured using the NIOSH sodium chloride (NaCl) aerosol method

224

employed for certification of particulate respirators with an efficiency of ≥95% (42 CFR Part 84).

225

Briefly, FFRs were pre-conditioned at 85 ± 5% relative humidity and 38 ± 2.5°C for 25 ± 1 hr prior to

226

measurements. A NaCl solution was aerosolized (by atomising an aqueous solution of the salt and

227

evaporating the water), charge neutralized, and then passed through the convex side of the FFRs. The

228

concentrations of NaCl aerosol upstream and downstream of the FFR were measured at 85 L/min flow

229

rate using a flame photometer, allowing for precise determinations in the range < 0.001 % to 100 %

230

filter penetration.

231
232

FFRs - Breathability

233

FFR breathability was assessed using inhalation and exhalation breathing resistance measurements

234

according to NIOSH 42CFR Part 84. Inhalation and exhalation resistance was tested according to

235

NIOSH Standard Test Procedures (TEB-APR-STP-0007 and TEB-APR-STP-0003 (38)); results in

236

mm H2O were recorded and evaluated against NIOSH performance criteria for FFR approvals (35 mm

237

H2O for inhalation and 25 mm H2O for exhalation) at approximately 85 ± 2 L/min airflow.

Virus infectivity losses at room temperature (passive decontamination) as well as the efficacy of VHP,

246

The continuous swine testicle (ST) cell-line, grown from testicular foetal swine tissues as described by

247

McClurkin and Norman (1966) (39), was maintained in MEM (GIBCO), supplemented with 5%

248

foetal calf serum (FCS) (Sigma), 1% sodium pyruvate 100x (GIBCO), and antibiotics (100U/ml

249

penicillin, 0.1mg/ml streptomycin and 0.05 mg/ml gentamycin).

250
251

PRCV strain 91V44 (40) was passaged three times on confluent ST monolayers. Titres were

252

determined via the tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) method; ST cells were seeded in 96-well

253

plates and infected with 10-fold serial dilutions of PRCV and incubated for four days at 37 °C with 5%

254

CO2. Four days after inoculation, monolayers were analysed for the presence of cytopathic effect by

255

light microscopy. Titres, expressed as TCID50/ml, were calculated according to the Reed and Muench

256

transformation (41). PRCV stocks with a titre range of 2.00×107 to 2.00×108 TCID50/mL were used in

257

subsequent steps.

258
259

The murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7 (ATCC TIB-71) was maintained in Dulbecco’s modified

260

Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% FCS (BioWhittaker), 1% 1 M HEPES buffer (pH 7.6)

261

(Invitrogen), and 2% of an association of penicillin (5000 SI units/ml) and streptomycin (5 mg/ml)

262

(PS, Invitrogen) at 37 °C with 5% CO2.

263
264

Stocks of MuNoV isolate MNV-1.CW1 were produced by infection of RAW264.7 cells at a

265

multiplicity of infection of 0.05. Two days post-infection, cells and supernatant were harvested and

266

clarified by centrifugation for 10 minutes at 4000 x g after three freeze/thaw cycles (– 80°C/37°C).

267

Titres were determined via the TCID50 method; RAW 264.7 cells were seeded in 96-well plates,

268

infected with 10-fold serial dilutions of MuNoV, incubated for three days at 37 °C with 5% CO2, and

269

finally stained with 0.2% crystal violet for 30 minutes. Titres, expressed as TCID50/ml, were calculated

270

according to the Reed and Muench transformation (41). MuNoV stocks with a titre range of 2.00×106

271

to 1.12×107 TCID50/mL were subsequently used.

273

Passive decontamination and multiple-cycle active decontamination of porcine respiratory

274

coronavirus- or murine norovirus- inoculated surgical masks and filtering facepiece respirators

275

Assays investigating time-dependent effects of virus degradation at room temperature (passive

276

decontamination), were performed using new SMs or FFRs. Per time point (0 hour, 1 day, 2 days, 3

277

days, 4 days, 5 days, 7 days, 14 days, and 21 days) and per virus (PRCV or MuNoV), one SM or FFR

278

was inoculated. The workflow followed previously described protocols for SM and FFR inoculation

279

and virus elution (31,33). Briefly, per SM or FFR, 100 µl of undiluted viral suspension were injected

280

under the first outer layer at the centre of each of three square coupons (34 mm x 34 mm) previously

281

outlined in graphite pencil on the intact SMs or FFRs. In addition to inoculation of the de facto SMs or

282

FFRs, 100 µl of viral suspension were pipetted onto both elastic straps. SMs and FFRs thus inoculated

283

were allowed to dry for 20 minutes at room temperature in a class II biological safety cabinet and were

284

then incubated in the dark (to limit any effect light might have on viral decay) at laboratory room

285

temperature (average 20°C) for the specified time points.

286
287

Assays investigating cumulative effects of multiple-cycle VHP and UVGI on SM or FFR

288

decontamination (active decontamination), consisted of either one or four decontamination cycles

289

applied prior to PRCV or MuNoV inoculation and subsequent decontamination, thus resulting in an

290

overall total of two and five decontaminations per SM or FFR. Since cumulative DH treatments were

291

found to significantly alter the characteristics of FFRs when exceeding three decontamination cycles

292

(see below), assays investigating cumulative effects of multiple-cycle DH decontamination, consisted

293

of either one or two FFR decontamination cycles applied prior to PRCV or MuNoV inoculation and

294

subsequent decontamination, resulting in a maximum number of three DH decontaminations. Per

295

decontamination method and type of face covering within the respective assays, one negative control

296

SM or FFR (uncontaminated but treated), three treated SMs or FFRs (PRCV- or MuNoV-

297

contaminated and treated), and three positive controls (PRCV- or MuNoV-contaminated but untreated)

298

were utilised. Per treated or control SM or FFR, 100 µl of undiluted viral suspension were injected

299

under the first outer layer at the centre of each of three square coupons. In addition to inoculation of

300

the de facto SMs or FFRs, 100 µl of viral suspension were pipetted onto one elastic strap per

301

contaminated SM or FFR. SMs and FFRs were allowed to dry for 20 minutes at room temperature in

302

a class II biological safety cabinet before final decontamination via UVGI, VHP, or DH.

303
304

Upon completion of the different decontamination protocols, PRCV or MuNoV was eluted from three

305

excised coupons and one severed elastic strap per SM or FFR (in the case of passive decontamination

306

assays both straps) via maximum speed vortex (2500 revolutions per minute in a VWR VX-2500

307

Multi-Tube Vortexer; 1 minute- or 20 minute vortex for PRCV- and MuNoV inoculated SMs or FFRs,

308

respectively) into 4 mL elution medium consisting of MEM or DMEM (Sigma)) supplemented with 2

309

% of an association of penicillin (5000 SI units/mL) and streptomycin (5 mg/mL) (PS, Sigma); for

310

elution from VHP-treated SMs or FFRs, 20% FCS and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol were added to the

311

medium. Titres of infectious PRCV or MuNoV recovered from individual coupons and straps were

312

determined via TCID50 assay. Back titrations of inoculum stocks were performed in parallel to each

313

series of decontamination experiments.

314
315

Data analysis and statistics

316

Statistical analyses of differences in infectious viral titres were performed using GraphPad Prism 7

317

(Graph-Pad Software) and P-values were computed by using a two-sided independent sample t-test,

318

where ****P<0.0001, ***P<0.001, **P<0.01, *P<0.05, and ns is P≥0.05.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

321
322

Infectious porcine respiratory coronavirus is recovered up to five and seven days after

323

inoculation of SMs and FFRs; murine norovirus remains detectable after seven days of passive

324

SM or FFR decontamination.

325

To combat PPE shortages provoked by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, repeated re-use of both SMs and

326

FFRs has been recommended (1,2,7,8). Prior decontamination of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory

327

or oral human pathogens is paramount to SM or FFR safe re-use and may be achieved either passively

328

via storage of items or via active SM and FFR reprocessing.

329
330

To validate CDC-issued limited re-use recommendations for passive decontamination by storage (10),

331

we evaluated time-dependent persistence of PRCV, an infectious SARS-CoV-2 surrogate, and

332

MuNoV, a notoriously tenacious small non-enveloped oral pathogen, on SMs and FFRs. Infectious

333

PRCV was detectable for up to five days post inoculation on SM coupons (1.52 (±0.38) log10

334

TCID50/mL) and three days post inoculation on SM straps (0.88 (±0.11) log10 TCID50/mL). The

335

recovery of PRCV from FFRs was similar to that of SMs, with coupon virus levels near the assay

336

LOD between days three and five post inoculation and 1.04 (±0.42) log10 TCID50/mL detected at day

337

seven post inoculation; no infectious PRCV was recovered from straps past day one post inoculation

338

(Figure 2). Infectious MuNoV remained detectable after seven days of passive SM or FFR coupon

339

decontamination (1.88 (±0.38) and 0.97 (±0.14) log10 TCID50/mL, respectively) and was also elutable

340

from SM and FFR straps at this time (1.43 (±0.53) and 1.18 (±0.18) log10 TCID50/mL, respectively)

341

(Figure 3).

342
343

We confirm passive room temperature SM and FFR decontamination to be effective for both PRCV

344

and MuNoV inactivation. However, we show that CDC-issued recommendations of a five-day room

345

temperature storage (10) may be too short as they do not allow for total degradation of high virus loads

346

on all SM and FFR materials (this in line with recent observations on other PPE items (13,14)).

347

According to our observations, the storage period should ideally be extended to at least seven days for

348

safe coronavirus inactivation and to a minimum of 14 days for decontamination of non-enveloped

349

viruses such as noroviruses.

350
351

Up to five cycles of active VHP and UVGI decontamination do not visually affect SMs or FFRs;

352

up to five and up to three DH cycles do not affect the physical appearance of SMs and FFRs,

353

respectively.

354

In high-throughput environments that necessitate a ready PPE availability (hospitals, nursing homes,

355

and other public facilities), an extended storage and turnaround time of one or even two weeks may

356

not be feasible, necessitating the implementation of fast-acting active decontamination techniques.

357

Active decontamination must guarantee not only the inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 and other

358

pathogens, but must do so without compromising the integrity of the SMs or FFRs themselves.

359

Decontaminating treatments are known to have inherently detrimental side effects that may

360

compromise the integrity of decontaminated objects (42); while VHP, UVGI, and DH

361

decontamination have previously been shown to not significantly impact performance of

362

polypropylene-based SMs or FFRs following single cycle decontamination (17–19,21), the maximum

363

number of decontamination cycles may be limited (42). To validate repeated safe reuse of SMs and

364

FFRs, we investigated SM integrity subsequent to one and five, and FFR integrity subsequent to one,

365

two, and five cycles of VHP, UVGI, and DH decontamination.

366
367

After one VHP, UVGI or DH decontamination cycle, no abnormalities were registered at visual SM or

368

FFR inspection. After multiple decontamination cycles VHP- or UVGI- treated SMs and FFRs

369

remained physically unaffected, this in line with previous studies (43,44). Only FFRs subjected to five

370

cycles of DH showed signs of degradation or burning which manifested as brown discoloration of FFR

371

elastic straps and disassociation of the metal noseband from FFR fabrics; as a consequence, five cycles

372

of DH treatment were abandoned in further analyses and were, uniquely for DH, replaced by tests

373

performed after three treatment cycles.

374
375

Single and multiple cycles of VHP-, UVGI-, and DH decontamination do not adversely affect SM

376

BFE. Single- and multiple UVGI decontamination does not adversely affect FFR NaCl filtration

377

efficiency, while VHP and DH treatments induce a slight decrease in filtration efficiency after

378

one or three decontamination cycles.

379

To investigate whether one and five and one, two, and five (three for DH) cycles of decontamination

380

affect SM and FFR integrity, respectively, SM BFE testing was performed according to EN14683 and

381

FFR filtration efficiency was investigated using the sub-micron NaCl aerosol method (NIOSH 42 CFR

382

Part 84). Both SMs and FFRs surpassed minimum filtration efficiency requirements before (99.50%

383

(±0.08) BFE and 97.01% (±0.56) NaCl filtration efficiency) decontamination. SM BFE remained

384

consistently higher than 98% after single- and multiple-cycle decontamination (Figure 4 A).

385
386

FFR filtration efficiencies remained above the required ≥95% (i.e. <5% penetration) following DH

387

and UVGI single-cycle treatments, however dropped to 91.02% (±8.38) post VHP exposure (this

388

owing to the aberrant value of 79.2% for a single FFR). Following two, three (for DH), or five

389

decontamination cycles, filtration efficiency of UVGI- and VHP-treated FFRs remained above 95%,

390

but dropped to 94.16% (±1.02) after three cycles of DH decontamination (Figure 4 B). VHP (which is

391

FDA-authorised for FFR decontamination) is typically not destructive to polypropylene FFRs (8,22)

392

and has previously been shown to not negatively affect FFR performance after single or multiple

393

decontamination cycles in assays similar to ours (43,45).

Since neither two nor five cycles of

394

decontamination caused a drop in filtration efficiency, it seems likely that the single aberrant result

395

after one VHP cycle may have been due to an issue with the item itself rather than the

396

decontamination. It follows that all three methods are suitable for single-cycle FFR decontamination

397

and reuse and that UVGI- and VHP decontamination may safely be applied to FFRs for up to five

398

cycles. DH at 102°C should only be used for a maximum of three iterations; for more than three DH

399

decontamination cycles, only temperatures that preserve the filtration characteristics of pristine FFRs

400

(< 100°C) are to be recommended (18,45).

401
402

Multiple cycles of VHP-, UVGI-, and DH decontamination decrease airflow resistance of SMs

403

but do not adversely affect FFR breathability.

404

Breathability, or resistance to airflow during inhalation and exhalation, is an indication of the

405

difficulty in breathing through SMs or FFRs and as such is important to wearer comfort. Breathability

406

of SMs was measured via differential pressure (pressure drop) test according to EN 14683 + AC:2019

407

(37), while breathability of FFRs was assessed by inhalation and exhalation resistance tests according

408

to NIOSH Standard Test Procedures (TEB-APR-STP-0007 and TEB-APR-STP-0003).

409
410

Untreated SMs (n=5) reached 52.08 (±0.99) Pa/cm2 differential pressure before treatment, while

411

differential pressures were only slightly elevated following single-cycle DH (54.88 (±3.00) Pa/cm2)

412

and VHP (59.2 (±3.88) Pa/cm2) decontamination, but exceeded the limit of 60 Pa/cm2 post UVGI

413

treatment with a measurement of 63.72 (±7.05) Pa/cm2 (Figure 5). Following five decontamination

414

cycles, pressure drop test results consistently exceeded the prescribed maximum of 60 Pa/cm2 (Figure

415

5), with mean values of 66.82 (±2.88) Pa/cm2 (DH), 69.04 (±3.88) Pa/cm2 (VHP) and 59.78 (±1.47)

416

Pa/cm2 (UVGI). Such elevated results should exclude the tested SMs from use following multiple-

417

cycle decontamination via all three methods according to EN 14683 + AC:2019; however, it should be

418

noted that mean differential pressure results have been shown to vary depending on the SM type

419

analysed (45). Hence, values exceeding the 60 Pa/cm2 limit in this study may have been artificially

420

elevated by high SM baseline values prior to decontamination rather than the decontamination

421

proceedures themselves, which have, in other studies, been shown to retain high SM performance even

422

after multiple treatment cycles (45,46). In Belgium, where SMs may be marketed and used in the

423

Covid-19 crisis situation according to an “Alternative Test Protocol” issued by the Belgian Federal

424

Agency for Medicines and Health Products that sets the maximum differential pressure limit at ≤ 70

425

Pa/cm2 (47), all treated SMs met current breathability requirements.

426
427

FFR inhalation and exhalation resistance measurements remained far below the recommended

428

maximum limits of ≤35 mmH2O in inhalation and ≤25 mmH2O in exhalation maintaining acceptable

429

respirability according to applicable standards and regulations both before (inhalation: 12.43 (±0.69)

431

echoing other published results (45,48).

432
433

Infectious porcine respiratory coronavirus is recovered at high titres from positive control SM-

434

and FFR coupons, at lower titres from straps, and remains under the limit of detection following

435

two (VHP, UVGI, DH), three (DH-treated FFRs) or five (VHP, UVGI, DH (SM)) active

436

decontamination cycles.

437
438

PRCV recovery from SM and FFR positive controls

439

Back titrations of virus inoculums performed in parallel to each series of experiments confirmed

440

PRCV inoculum titres to be within a range of 7.30 to 8.30 log10 TCID50/mL for all experiments. The

441

cell culture limit of detection (LOD) was 0.8 log10 TCID50/mL for all assays. An initially observed

442

VHP cytotoxicity and correspondingly elevated LOD of 1.80 log10 TCID50/mL of VHP-treated coupon

443

eluates was corrected via β-mercaptoethanol and FCS supplementation of elution medium; elevated

444

cytotoxicity of VHP-treated strap eluates (SM and FFR) could not be neutralised and remained at 1.80

445

log10 TCID50/mL. Values below the LOD were thus considered as ≤0.80 log10 TCID50/mL or ≤1.80

446

log10 TCID50/mL (VH-treated straps). Comparable high levels of infectious virus were recovered from

447

once-, twice- (DH-treated FFRs) or four-times treated, PRCV-inoculated left, right and middle

448

coupons of all SMs and FFRs within a range of 4.27 (±0.50) to 6.07 (±0.29) log10 TCID50/mL

449

(Supplementary Figure 1). Recovery values for infectious PCRV from SM and FFR straps were also

450

similar between experiments, however they were lower than coupon recovery values, with mean

451

values ranging from below the LOD to 4.44 (±0.74) log10 TCID50/mL (Supplementary Figure 1).

452
453

Multiple cycle decontamination of PRCV-inoculated SMs

454

Following two cycles of SM UVGI, VHP exposure, and DH treatment, all PRCV titres remained

455

below the respective LOD of the assay (with the exception of UVGI treated straps), showing a total

456

loss of infectivity of more than five orders of magnitude for UVGI-treated coupons (5.05 log10

457

reduction) and four orders of magnitude for VHP- and DH-treated coupons (4.83 and 4.39 log10

458

reduction, respectively), this in line with previous publications (48,49). Titres of PRCV recovered

459

from SM straps following two treatment cycles were reduced by over two orders of magnitude post

460

UVGI, VHP and DH treatment of SM straps (2.48, 2.22 and 2.85 log10 reduction) (Figure 7).

461
462

Following five cycles of SM UVGI, VHP exposure, and DH treatment, all PRCV titres remained

463

below the respective LOD of the assay (with the exception of UVGI treated straps), showing a total

loss of infectivity of more than five orders of magnitude for UVGI-treated coupons (5.37 log10

reduction) and more than four orders of magnitude for VHP- and DH-treated coupons (4.64 and 4.69

467

one order of magnitude post UVGI (1.59 log10 reduction) and for VHP-treated straps (2.02 log10

468

reduction), and by almost four orders of magnitude for DH- treated straps (3.94 log10 reduction)

469

(Figure 7).

471

Multiple cycle decontamination of PRCV-inoculated FFRs

472

Decontamination treatment effects followed a similar pattern of PRCV inactivation for FFR coupons

473

decontaminated twice via DH, VHP, and UVGI reducing viral titres by more than three and four

474

orders of magnitude (3.71, 4.45 and 4.62 log10 reduction, respectively), supporting previous

475

observations (31). The impact of two-cycle decontamination could not be measured for DH-treated

476

FFR straps due to insufficient recovery of infectious virus in the corresponding controls. Virus

477

recovery from both SM and FFR straps has been shown to be highly variable both in our hands (31)

478

and in those of others (50) (and indeed, probably for this reason, strap decontamination is rarely

479

assessed). Without enough proof of inactivation, we cannot recommend safe decontamination of SM

480

or FFR straps and suggest treating straps separately using a disinfecting wipe or similar approach.

481

Two-cycle UVGI and VHP treatment of FFR straps resulted in a reduction of infectious PRCV loads

482

by 1.46 and 0.63 log10 reduction, respectively (Figure 8).

483
484

Following five cycles of FFR UVGI, VHP, and DH, all PRCV titres remained below the respective

LOD of the assay, reducing viral titres by over four orders of magnitude (4.48, 4.22 and 4.30 log10

reduction, respectively).

488

all three methods yield rapid and efficient virus inactivation even after multiple-cycle FFR

489

decontamination. The impact of decontamination could not be measured for DH-treated FFR straps

490

due to insufficient recovery of infectious virus in the corresponding controls. UVGI and VHP

491

treatment of FFR straps resulted in a reduction of infectious PRCV loads by 1.81 and 0.18 log10

492

reduction, respectively (Figure 8).

These results are in line with our own and others’ prior publications

493
494

Infectious murine norovirus is recovered at high titres from positive control SM- and FFR

495

coupons, at lower titres from straps, and remains under the limit of detection following two

(VHP, UVGI, DH), three (DH) or five (VHP, UVGI) decontamination cycles.

498

MuNoV recovery from SM and FFR positive controls

499

Back titrations of virus inoculums performed in parallel to each series of experiments confirmed

500

MuNoV inoculum titres to be within a range of 6.30 to 7.05 log10 TCID50/mL for all experiments. The

501

cell culture limit of detection (LOD) was 0.80 log10 TCID50/mL for all assays except for those

502

concerning VHP-treated SM- or FFR straps and UVGI-treated FFR straps (1.80 log10 TCID50/mL).

range of 4.55 (±0.60) to 5.38 (±0.25) log10 TCID50/mL (Supplementary Figure 2). Recovery values for

506

infectious MuNoV from SM and FFR straps were also similar between experiments, however they

507

were lower than coupon recovery values, with mean values ranging from 1.80 (VHP LOD) to 5.22

510

Multiple cycle decontamination of MuNoV-inoculated SMs

511

Following two cycles of SM UVGI, VHP exposure, and DH treatment, all MuNoV titres remained

512

below the respective LOD of the assay, showing total loss of infectivity of over four orders of

513

magnitude for UVGI-, VHP- and DH-treated SM coupons (4.47, 4.33, and 4.15 log10 reduction,

514

respectively). Titres of MuNoV recovered from treated SM straps were reduced by less than three

515

orders of magnitude post two cycles of UVGI and VHP treatment (0.96 and 2.55 (below the LOD)

516

log10 reduction, respectively) and by over four orders of magnitude post two-cycle-DH treatment (4.43

517

log10 reduction (below LOD)) (Figure 9).

518
519

Following five cycles of SM UVGI, VHP exposure, and DH treatment, all MuNoV titres remained

520

below the respective LOD of the assay, showing total loss of infectivity of over four orders of

521

magnitude for UVGI and DH-treated coupons (4.65 and 4.29 log10 reduction, respectively), while

522

titres of MuNoV recovered from VHP-treated coupons showed a loss of infectivity of almost four

523

orders of magnitude (3.96 log10 reduction). Titres of MuNoV recovered from treated SM straps were

524

reduced by 0.88, 2.39 (below the LOD), and 3.84 log10, respectively, post UVGI, VHP- and DH-

525

treatment (Figure 9).

Multiple cycle decontamination of MuNoV-inoculated FFRs

528

Decontamination followed a similar pattern of MuNoV inactivation for FFR coupons decontaminated

twice via DH, reducing viral titres by over three orders of magnitude (3.96 log10 reduction), and by

530

over four orders of magnitude for VHP- and UVGI-treated FFR coupons (4.42, and 4.44 log10

531

reduction, respectively). UVGI- and DH-treatment of FFR straps reduced infectivity by 0.06 log10 (not

532

significant), and 3.15 log10 (from 3.63 (±0.76) log10 TCID50/mL to below the LOD), respectively. Loss

533

of infectivity could not be demonstrated subsequent to MuNoV elution from twice-VHP-treated FFR

534

straps owing to poor virus recovery (Figure 10).

Decontamination followed a similar pattern of MuNoV inactivation on FFR coupons after five

CONCLUSION

546

In conclusion, we showed that PRCV and MuNoV remain detectable on SMs and FFRs for up to five

547

and seven days of passive decontamination at room temperature, necessitating either longer

548

decontamination periods than currently recommended by the CDC or active decontamination

549

techniques that can decontaminate PPE within a matter of hours. Three such active decontamination

550

techniques were evaluated in this study with respect to their effect both on SM and FFR integrity and

551

on the inactivation of the enveloped SARS-CoV-2 surrogate PRCV and non-enveloped human

552

norovirus surrogate MuNoV. Single and multiple cycles of VHP-, UVGI-, and DH were shown to not

553

adversely affect bacterial filtration efficiency of SMs. Single- and multiple UVGI did not adversely

554

affect FFR filtration efficiency, while VHP and DH induced a slight decrease in FFR filtration

555

efficiency after one or three decontamination cycles. Multiple cycles of VHP-, UVGI-, and DH

556

decreased airflow resistance of SMs but did not adversely affect FFR breathability. All three active

557

decontamination methods efficiently inactivated both viruses after five decontamination cycles,

558

permitting demonstration of a loss of infectivity by more than three orders of magnitude. This multi-

559

disciplinal, consolidated approach, wherein both SM and FFR integrity and the inactivation of a

560

coronavirus and a hardier non-enveloped norovirus are investigated subsequent to multiple

561

decontamination cycles thus provides important information on how often a given PPE item may be

562

safely reused. The knowledge gained here will help close the existing gap between supply and demand

563

and provide a multi-facetted measure of security to health-care personnel and the general public both

564

during the Covid-19 pandemic and beyond, when established protocols for re-use of single-use only

565

items may be upheld for environmental reasons.

799

decontaminated coupons (n=9) and three inoculated, decontaminated straps (n=3) were analysed in

800

parallel to inoculated, untreated, positive control coupons (n=9) and straps (n=3). Mean log10

801

TCID50/mL and standard errors of the means are represented. P-values were computed by using a two-

sided independent sample t-test, where ****P<0.0001, ***P<0.001, **P<0.01, *P<0.05, and ns is

respirator (FFR) decontamination using dry heat (DH), vaporised hydrogen peroxide (VHP), and

807

ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI). Titrations were performed after two or five (three in the case

808

of DH) decontamination treatments on MuNoV- inoculated FFR coupons and straps. MuNoV

809

infectivity was analysed in RAW264.7 cells. The cell culture limit of detection (LOD) was 0.80 log10

TCID50/mL (6.31×100 TCID50/mL) for all analyses except those concerning VHP- and UVGI-treated

811

FFR straps (1.80 log10 TCID50/mL (6.31×101 TCID50/mL)). Per decontamination method, nine PRCV-

821

filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) and surgical masks (SMs) decontaminated either once or four

822

times (twice in the case of DH assays) prior to virus inoculation. Infectious PRCV recovery was

823

analysed in swine testicular cells. The cell culture limit of detection (LOD) was 0.80 log10 TCID50/mL

824

(6.31×100 TCID50/mL) for all analyses except those concerning VHP-treated SM or FFR straps (1.80

825

log10 TCID50/mL (6.31×101 TCID50/mL)). Similar levels of virus recovery were detected for left, right

826

and middle (L, R, M) (n=3) coupons of FFRs and SMs; recovery efficacy of infectious virus from

827

straps (S) (n=3) deviated significantly in all analyses from the mean of all coupons and remained

828

below the LOD for assays performed on DH-treated FFR straps. Mean log10 TCID50/mL and standard

829

errors of the means are represented. P-values were computed by using a two-sided independent sample

830

t-test to calculate differences between individual coupon values and differences between mean values

831

of all coupons and straps, where ****P<0.0001, ***P<0.001, **P<0.01, *P<0.05, and ns.
