Abstract
Objectives
To investigate the role of ethnicity in COVID-19 outcome disparities in a cohort in Kuwait.
Methods
This is a retrospective analysis of 405 individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Kuwait. Outcomes such
as symptoms severity and mortality were considered. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to
report the odds ratios (OR) for ICU admission and dying from COVID-19.
Results
The cohort included 290 Arabs and 115 South Asians. South Asians recorded significantly higher
COVID-19 death rates compared to Arabs (33% vs. 7.6%, P value<0.001). When compared to Arabs,
South Asians also had higher odds of being admitted to the ICU (OR = 6.28, 95% CI: 3.34 – 11.80, p <
0.001). South Asian patients showed 7.62 (95% CI: 3.62 – 16.02, p < 0.001) times the odds of dying from
COVID-19.
Conclusion
COVID-19 patients with South Asians ethnicity are more likely to have worse prognosis and outcome
when compared to patients with Arab ethnicity. This suggest a possible role for ethnicity in COVID-19
outcome disparities and this role is likely to be multifactorial.

Introduction
Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 patients vary broadly, ranging from asymptomatic infection to
acute respiratory failure and death (Alshukry et al., 2020). It is well established now that age, gender and
certain pre-existing health conditions are considered as risk factors for a severe form of the disease (Ali et
al., 2020). However certain indications have suggested a possible implication for ethnicity and race as
contributors to the wide disparity in COVID-19 outcomes. Recent findings in the United States and
United Kingdom showed differences in COVID-19 related hospitalization and death rates by ethnicity
(Garg et al., 2020; Patel et al., 2020). Ethnicity is influenced by genetic backgrounds, environmental
factors, as well as cultural and behavioral norms. Others have linked ethnicity to socioeconomic status,
living standards and occupations (Patel et al., 2020). These factors linked to ethnicity are likely to
function interdependence and influence disease outcome. As COVID-19 continue to spread globally,
understanding how ethnicity affects SARS-CoV2 susceptibility and disease outcome would surely
improve disease management and outcome.
Kuwait is a multiethnic country with a population of 4.3 million. Arabs make 59.2% of the population
while South Asians make 37.8% (Central Statistical Bureau of Kuwait (CSBoK), 2019). In here, we
present and compare COVID-19 clinical outcomes in the Arabs and South Asians ethnic groups.
Material and Methods
Cohort details
Four hundred and five consecutive COVID-19 patients were recruited in this study. Patients were
admitted to Jaber Al-Ahmad Hospital in Kuwait between February 24 and May 24, 2020. Hospitalization
rate was 100%, subject to a positive PCR test regardless of disease severity. Cohort clinical characteristics
were previously described by our group (Ali et al., 2020; Alshukry et al., 2020). The study was reviewed
and granted an approval by the standing committee for coordination of health and medical research in the
Ministry of Health in Kuwait (IRB 2020/1404). Patients were divided into two main groups; Arabs and
South Asian. Disease severity was determined following criteria described previously (Alshukry et al.,
2020).
Statistical analysis
Student T-test was used to examine continuous variables, results were reported as mean ± standard
deviation. Nominal variables were determined by using χ2 test and categorical variables compared using
Fisher-Exact test. We investigated the relationships between ethnicity as a categorical exposure and both
(1) the death outcome from COVID-19 and (2) ICU admission. We used binary response variables and
adjusted for age, gender, smoking status and other co-morbidities. A logistic regression model was used
to report the odds ratios (OR) for dying from COVID-19 and for ICU admission for patients of South
Asian ethnicity, with a baseline comparison to Arab ethnicity.
Results
Arabs made the majority of the cohort (71.6%). Males were predominant in both ethnic groups which
were also age matched. Mortality rate in Arabs groups was 7.5% while it reached 33% in the South
Asians (p<0.001). No significant differences were reported in comorbidities prevalence between both
groups (Table.1). South Asians also had higher odds of being admitted to the ICU (OR = 6.28, 95% CI:
3.34 – 11.80, p < 0.001). (Figure.1). They also showed 7.62 (95% CI: 3.62 – 16.02, p < 0.001) times the
odds of dying from COVID-19 when compared to Arabs (Figure.1).

Discussion
Results from our cohort, which provided good representation of the population, indicated that South
Asians were more likely to develop a severe form of the disease which also corresponded to a higher
death rate compared to Arabs.
Our results suggested ethnicity as a possible risk factor for COVID-19 poor prognosis and outcome. The
vast majority of South Asians in Kuwait are unskilled labor living in highly populated accommodations.
Their living conditions and perhaps occupation can increase their exposure to SARS-CoV2. While this
could have a major impact on infection dynamics, it may not explain the results entirely. Local laws grant
each resident in Kuwait free access to governmental health care, hence rolling out healthcare access
inequalities of such outcome disparity. Comorbidities are known as risk factors for severe and poor
outcomes however our results indicated no significant differences in prevalence between the two ethnic
groups and therefore do not provide a conclusive answer for the disparity in outcome. We certainly
cannot overlook the role of genetic factors which might make people from certain ethnicity more prone to
severe outcome (Al-Mulla et al., 2020).
The role of ethnicity in COVID-19 outcome disparities is likely to be multifactorial in nature.
Understanding why certain ethnic groups are prone to severe COVID-19 outcome is important to improve
outcomes and develop effective mitigation strategies.
