ABSTRACT
Introduction: During the COVID-19 pandemic, some K-12 schools resumed in-person
classes with varying degrees of mitigation plans in the fall of 2020. Physical distancing
and face coverings can minimize SARS-CoV-2 spread, the virus that causes COVID-19.
However, no research has focused on mitigation strategy adherence during school
days. Thus, we sought to develop a systematic observation protocol to capture COVID19 mitigation strategy adherence in school environments: The Systematic Observation
of COVID-19 Mitigation (SOCOM).
Methods: We extended previously validated and internationally used tools to develop
the SOCOM training and implementation protocol to assess physical distancing and
face covering behaviors. SOCOM was tested in diverse indoor and outdoor settings
(classrooms, lunchrooms, physical education [PE], and recess) among diverse schools
(elementary, secondary, and special needs).
Results: For the unique metrics of physical-distancing and face-covering behaviors,
areas with more activity and a maximum of 10-15 students were ideal for accurately
capturing data. Overall proportion of agreement was high for physical distancing
(90.9%), face covering (88.6%), activity type (89.2%), and physical activity level
(87.9%). Agreement was lowest during active recess, PE, and observation areas with

≥20 students.
Conclusions: Millions of children throughout the US are likely to return to school in the
months ahead despite the current surge of COVID-19 cases. SOCOM is a relatively
inexpensive tool that can be implemented by schools to determine mitigation strategy
adherence and assess changes to protocols to help students return to school safely and
slow the spread of COVID-19 and can be used for research purposes.

INTRODUCTION
This work is to present a novel approach to assess the implementation of key
mitigation procedures in children and adolescents in K-12 schools. The impact of the
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by the novel coronavirus,
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2), has been widespread,
with 21 million cases diagnosed and over 350,000 deaths in the U.S. as of January 4,
2020. When COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, schools were among the first
operations to close to prevent community spread. However, in the fall of 2020, 56
million school-aged children (5-17 years of age) resumed education as some schools
opened to in-person classes with varying degrees of public health mitigation plans.1 The
extent to which children and adolescents comprise an asymptomatic population of
SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals capable of spreading disease to school staff and
family has yet to be resolved.2 Mitigation procedures can minimize SARS-CoV-2
outbreaks even in the close quarters of overnight summer camps.3
The K-12 school environment is particularly challenging with respect to the
potential for viral transmission. Viral aerosolization can occur due to the general social
and physically interactive nature of school-aged children, including during classroom
learning, communal dining, recess, and PE classes. Comprehensive return-to-school
plans emphasize adherence to accepted SARS-CoV-2 viral mitigation strategies
procedures, including physical distancing (staying at least 6 feet from others who are
not from the same household) and face cover wearing.4-6 Recognizing that these
mitigation strategies represent unfamiliar and unnatural behaviors for K-12 students,
attention has been focused on strategies to implement and operationalize mitigation

protocols in schools. Little emphasis has been given to how to quantify adherence.
Without metrics that gauge adherence to recommendations/rules, the short- and longterm effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 transmission mitigation procedures cannot be
ascertained.
Instruments are available for quantifying elements of behaviors that could be
applied to assess the fidelity of COVID-19 mitigation. These include self-report,7
wearable technologies,8-13 and direct observation by trained personnel.14-17 Self-reports
by children and adolescents of their daily living (e.g., physical activity or diet) are highly
inaccurate.14-17 Wearable technologies such as accelerometers are increasingly used to
gauge physical activity and sedentary behavior in children,18,19 but necessary
technological advances in position and small-distance sensing are not available for
widespread use and are not designed to assess physical distancing or face covering
behaviors.20-22 Moreover, the use of cell phone- or GPS-monitoring in school-aged
children and adolescents would raise questions of health data privacy,23 embodied in
FERPA and HIPAA regulations.
Long-existing, robust, and widely used direct observation approaches developed
to assess levels of physical activity in groups of children, adolescents, and adults in a
variety of real-world environments were readily adapted to measure COVID-19
mitigation strategies in K-12 schools. The original System for Observing Play and
Leisure Activity in Youth (SOPLAY), designed for physical activity settings in schools,
and the System for Observing Play and Recreation in Communities (SOPARC),
designed to include playgrounds and parks, were designed to obtain direct information
on physical activity in open spaces.16,24 SOPLAY and SOPARC are based on

momentary time sampling techniques in which systematic and periodic scans of
individuals and contextual factors in physical activity environments are made and they
have been adapted for multiple settings.17 Given SOPARC’s proven ability to obtain
reliable observational data, we sought to test a new strategy of using systematic
observation to capture COVID-19 mitigation strategy adherence, including physical
distancing and face coverings, among grade-school-aged children in diverse school
settings: The Systematic Observation of COVID-19 Mitigation (SOCOM).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Setting
Four schools in Orange County, California, were recruited to participate in a Safe
School Restart study to begin essential research on COVID-19 transmission in children
and adolescents as K-12 schools reopened across the U.S. The aim of Safe School
Restart was to determine how effectively state and regional guidelines slowed viral
transmission as schools restarted. A hypothesis of the study is that mitigation protocol
fidelity will be related to the relative socio-economic condition of a school. Private
schools across the country have been able to expend the resources necessary to
develop and implement effective mitigation strategies. Public schools, particularly Title 1
public schools, have had greater difficulty in accessing necessary resources.25,26
Consequently, our study includes four representative schools in Orange County,
California:
1.

Private K-12 school serving predominantly middle- and upper-middle
socioeconomic status (SES) students

2.

K-6 public school serving predominantly Latino, lower SES students

SOCOM was designed to observe four distinct times during the school day:

classroom learning (non-physical activity courses taught in a classroom), active recess
(a regularly scheduled period in the school day for physical activity and play that is
monitored by trained staff or volunteers), PE class (instruction in physical exercise and
games in school), and communal dining (lunch) time.
Partnerships with Schools
Schools were selected for Safe School Restart to reflect the wide range of SES,
ethnic diversity, and school layouts and facilities that exist within Orange County,
California, allowing to determine the ability of observers to implement SOCOM in
different settings (Table 1). Previous relationships with the schools facilitated approvals
by schools and school districts. Great care was taken to plan with school staff, so
elements of the study were clear, acceptable, and followed the policies taken by the
schools in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
SOCOM Development
In the summer of 2020, our team, in collaboration with physical activity and SOPARC
experts, developed the SOCOM protocol to focus on assessing COVID-19 mitigation
procedures (physical distancing and face covering behaviors). Paper and electronic
observation forms were developed to capture data (Figures 1 and 2). The custom

electronic data capture system optimized for mobile devices was developed by the
Center for Biomedical Informatics, UC Irvine Institute for Clinical and Translational
Science. The platform leverages the Bootstrap responsive user interface framework and
was programmed in ASP.Net C#. In addition to the SOPARC-based data fields that
research coordinators can enter manually based on their field observations, the system
is also capable of obtaining local weather information automatically through an
application programming interface (API) provided by openweathermap.org. All data
captured are stored in a HIPAA-compatible environment hosted at the Enterprise Data
Center of the UCI Health.
Measures
Primary measures included physical distancing, face covering behavior, physical
activity levels, and activity type (Table 2). In addition, observed individuals were
categorized into sex/age groups (female students, male students, female adults, and
male adults). Data were recorded to identify specific observation target area, date,
grades in attendance, time of observation, and weather conditions.
Training
In preparation for SOCOM, observers studied the written protocol and then
attended a four-hour workshop. Original written and video SOPARC training materials
were used during the workshop (https://activelivingresearch.org/soparc-systemobserving-play-and-recreation-communities). Training included reviewing definitions and
coding conventions, differentiating among codes, coding practice, and orientation to the
observation tools. Observer preparation also included target area mapping strategies.
The target areas (i.e., pre-determined observation locations) were diverse and varied by

school. Coding conventions and how to differentiate between the various physical
activity levels included video lectures and practice with feedback from videotaped
samples through original SOPARC training. Distinguishing between face coverings,
physical distancing, and activity type definitions was taught using photographs and
videos. Observers practiced coding and received feedback on their scoring before
engaging in field practice.
Observation Preparation
In addition to observer training, the research team obtained maps of the school
grounds from Google Maps and/or school administrators. These maps were used to
precisely identify outdoor target areas, spaces in which activities may occur and are
small enough to accurately count people using them. The size, location, and boundaries
for both indoor and outdoor target areas were identified and the sequential order for
observing them established.
As COVID-19 recommendations and restrictions varied among schools and time
periods, visiting schools was imperative to finalizing school-specific observation
protocols and visitation days. Administrative-level school officials (e.g., principals)
escorted observers around a school and its grounds to note the general layout and
major features of the facilities and to specifically identify potential target areas for
observation.
Finally, before official data collection began, all observers attended a field-based
training at one of the schools using the developed protocol and data collection form to
practice using the protocol and form. Observers used the schedule of observations

similar to that for official observations, but were able to discuss protocols and category
classifications.
Recording Procedures
To establish reliability, during visits to a target area, two to three observers
simultaneously completed the observation form either using the paper form or individual
cell phones (Figure 1 and 2), and timestamps and weather information were uploaded
automatically into the electronic form.
After recording the characteristics of a target area, the observers completed
scans of the area by making independent “visual sweeps” from left to right, in which two
or three observers scan simultaneously at the same pace. Separate scans were
conducted for each sex/age group (female students, male students, female adults, and
male adults), and each characteristic (physical distancing, face covering, physical
activity, and activity type) for a maximum of 16 scans per target area. For example,
during the first scan for female students, observers recorded whether each was
physically distanced, not physically distanced, or unknown. During the second scan,
observers recorded data for each female student’s face covering (e.g., on, partial, not
on, or no mask). For PE class and active recesses only, a third scan was performed to
record the physical activity level of each female student as sedentary, walking, or
vigorous. Finally, for female students a scan was made to categorize each as being
interactive or individual. This scanning procedure was then completed for male
students, female adults, and male adults in the target area (if any). After this, observers
moved to the next specified target area. Occasionally (e.g., unusual large numbers of
people in the area or full view of the area being obstructed), target areas were

subdivided into smaller sub-areas so more accurate measures could be obtained. Data
from these sub-areas were later summed to provide an overall measure for each target
area.
During groups of scans, observers were also able to take qualitative notes on
contextual information. When needed, observers used the paper observation form and
later entered the information into the electronic data form.
Planned Data Analysis
For physical distancing scenario, face covering behavior, physical activity level,
and activity type, counts will be tallied for those engaged in each group in each school
and observation area to obtain a summary score for female students, male students,
female adults, and male adults. A proportion of individuals in each physical distancing
scenario, face covering behavior, physical activity level, and activity type will be
calculated by age/sex group.
RESULTS
Observations
During a school visit, the time for observations varied by the number of target
areas and the number of people present. Observation length for target areas ranged
from about two (classrooms) to 15 minutes (dining rooms). Communal areas generally
had more people and more target areas, so more scans were required. Additionally,
when more people were present (>20), some observers preferred the paper observation
form compared to the electronic form as they could easily tally students and take notes
in the margins of the form. Thus, for physical distancing and face covering, areas with

more activity and target areas, observation areas with a maximum of 10-15 students
was ideal for accurately and confidently capturing data. Among target areas with
primarily sedentary people (e.g., classrooms), observers felt more comfortable with a
maximum of 15-20 students.
The presence of observers being adjacent to target areas, especially indoor
ones, may have slightly influenced staff and student behavior. Schools had restrictions
on visitors due to COVID-19 protocols [e.g., number of visitors allowed in a room and
teachers sometimes inquired about why observers were there (during their first visit)].
Meanwhile, when students were more physically active (e.g., PE classes) observers
typically went unnoticed.
Reliability and Validity
Reliability data for physical activity codes, physical distancing, and face covering
behaviors among students were collected during all observation periods using two or
three assessors who made simultaneous, independent observations. Data from 166
scans were used in the reliability of physical distancing, face covering behaviors, and
activity type analyses, and the overall proportion of agreement was calculated for each
variable (face covering, 88.6%; physical distancing, 90.9%; and activity type, 89.2%).
Reliability for physical activity level was calculated for 34 observations (collected
during active recess and PE classes) and the proportion of agreement was 87.9%.
When assessed by observation area (classroom learning, communal dining, active
recess, and PE classes), agreement was lowest during active recess and PE classes
(79.7% to 99.1%). Agreement was lower when there were ≥20 students present (80.2%)
compared to <20 students (90.2%).

Original SOPARC activity codes were used in other observation systems
including Behaviors of Eating and Activity for Children’s Health: Evaluation System
(BEACHES),27 the System for Observing Fitness Instruction Time (SOFIT),28 and
SOPLAY.16 Construct validity of activity codes has been established through heart rate
monitoring among children 4-18 years old27,29 and with accelerometers in schools.30 We
did not determine validity of the physical activity codes in this study.
DISCUSSION
Systematic observation has been widely used in collecting information on
children’s and adolescents’ behaviors.16,17,24,27 Therefore, we sought to test a new
strategy of using systematic observation to capture COVID-19 mitigation strategy
adherence, including physical distancing and face coverings, among grade-school-aged
children in the school environment. The initial experience with SOCOM indicates that it
may serve as a reliable and useful tool in assessing COVID-19 mitigation procedures in
schools.
Interrater reliability profiles for SOCOM, including face covering, physical
distancing adherence, and physical activity were comparable to these metrics in
SOPLAY and SOPARC.24 After and while the team completed observations, the
research team discussed the effectiveness of the SOCOM protocol, observation form,
and experience. In general, heuristic assessments of the SOCOM protocol and
observation forms were positive with certain limitations in using the electronic form,
including the need for access to the internet on the devices used. SOCOM worked well,
even in the somewhat constrained setting of school environments during a pandemic.

Due to the complex, novel nature of capturing COVID-19 mitigation strategy
adherence, training and observation preparation were extremely important. Training
materials for SOCOM were obtained from existing valid and reliable methods from the
original SOPARC tool. Although previous training materials focused mainly on capturing
physical activity levels, we found that training to observe physical distancing and face
covering behaviors was readily adaptable. Field-based observational training at the
schools using the protocol in real-time were imperative. Individual schools had different
layouts for classrooms, meals, recesses, and physical activity facilities (e.g.,
playgrounds). Consequently, our training included an initial, separate visit to each
school to familiarize the observers with the features of the school's physical
environment and to review details of the school’s COVID-19 schedule, rules, and
restrictions. This permitted the development of appropriate weekly and daily observation
schedules for each school and was welcomed by school leadership and staff. Visits
were necessary for planning the positioning observers in areas where they could have a
clear view and to minimize interactions with students and staff. However, a limitation of
SOCOM is the potential for observation bias as individuals may be inclined to be on
their best behavior while under observation.
With high reliability, ease of use, inexpensive minimal training, and the ability to
modify the tool as needed, SOCOM could be used by other researchers, school
administration, and school staff to help schools reopen successfully. The tool can be
applied by schools to monitor compliance, adjust mitigation strategy messaging, and
contribute to informed school policies. Furthermore, the tool can be adjusted to use in
other school settings, such as music classes, lab settings, teachers lounges, and other

parts of the school. Although SOCOM may be adapted for use beyond schools, we did
not observe those settings.
CONCLUSIONS
Despite the current surge of COVID-19 cases, millions of children and staff will
be in schools under various conditions around the world. Despite the inauguration of
COVID-19 vaccinations, the vaccination of enough people to approach herd immunity is
a long way off. At the time of this writing, a vaccine has not been approved to be used
among children <16 year old and no child under the age of 12 years has been enrolled
in any safety or efficacy vaccine trials, thus the potential for widespread COVID-19
vaccinations in school-aged children to diminish the need for mitigation procedures in
schools is many months away. There is mounting evidence of the damage done to K-12
students, particularly low-income and minority, by continued school closures,31,32 and it
is likely that increasing numbers of schools will reopen by the beginning of the 2021
winter semester. Quantifying the success of SARS-CoV-2 transmission mitigation in
school settings is likely to be useful for the foreseeable future. Standardized methods of
measuring the fidelity of mitigation procedures will likely aid in identifying the most
effective ways to minimize SARS-CoV-2 viral transmission. SOCOM is a relatively
inexpensive tool that can be implemented by schools in various settings, including the
school day, after school programs, and school sports and competitions, to determine
mitigation strategy adherence to help students return to school safely and slow the
spread of COVID-19.

activity levels

Activity type

1. On – individual had both his/her nose and mouth fully covered
2. Partial – individual had face covering on but either his/her nose or mouth was not
covered
3. Not on – individual had no face covering on, but one was visible (e.g., mask in han
or hanging from ear)
4. None – individual had no visible face covering anywhere on body
1. Sedentary – individual was lying down, sitting, or standing in place
2. Walking – individual was engaged in walking at normal pace
3. Vigorous – individual was engaged in an activity more vigorous than an ordinary
walk (e.g., causing increased heart rate, such as when jogging, swinging, doing
cartwheels).
1. Interactive – individual was engaged in an interactive activity where he/she was
using a shared piece of equipment or touched another person
2. Individual – individual was engaged in an independent activity with no shared
equipment
