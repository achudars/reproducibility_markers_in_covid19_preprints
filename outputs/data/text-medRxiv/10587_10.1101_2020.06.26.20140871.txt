Abstract
Studies aimed at characterizing the evolution of COVID-19 disease often rely on case-based
surveillance data publicly released by health authorities, that can be incomplete and prone to
errors. Here, we quantify the biases caused by the use of inaccurate data in the estimation
of the Time-Varying Reproduction Number R(t). By focusing on Italy and Spain, two of the
hardest-hit countries in Europe and worldwide, we show that if the symptoms’ onset
time-series is inferred from the notification date series, the R(t) curve cannot capture nor
describe accurately the early dynamics of the epidemic. Furthermore, the effectiveness of
the containment measures that were implemented, such as national lockdowns, can be
properly evaluated only when R(t) is estimated using the real time-series of dates of
symptoms’ onset. Our findings show that extreme care should be taken when a pivotal
quantity like R(t) is used to make decisions and to evaluate different alternatives.

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought the time-varying reproduction number, R(t), to the
public attention worldwide [1]. R(t) represents the mean number of secondary infections
generated by one primary infected individual, over the course of an epidemic. In contrast to
the basic reproductive number, R​0 [2], which assumes the population to be fully susceptible,
the temporal variations of R(t) reflect the changes in transmissibility caused by the depletion
of susceptibles during the epidemic, and by the presence of control interventions and
spontaneous behavioral responses. When R(t) decreases below the threshold value of 1, the
number of new infections begins to decline. This quantity is thus pivotal to evaluate the
impact of interventions, calibrate epidemiological models, and guide the lift of restrictions,
where in place.
Usually, R(t) can be estimated by means of various inference algorithms applied to epidemic
incidence data (the numbers of new recorded cases at successive times). Although a
precise estimate of R(t) would require knowledge of the onset of symptoms for all cases
belonging to the incidence curve, many published estimates of R(t) during the COVID-19
pandemic have relied on incidence curves reporting cases by notification date, since the true
date of symptoms’ onset is usually unknown or it is not publicly available [3,4]. Several
estimation methods account for such lack of information by using time-independent delay
distributions from symptom onset to reporting [5,6]. However, the impact of using
case-notification data - instead of the true symptom onset - as the main data input for
estimating R(t) has not been investigated so far.
Data
To address this issue, we evaluate R(t) by using four different types of incidence curves
inferred from different data sets. We focus on two European countries that are among the
most severely hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, Italy and Spain. First, we consider the
time-series of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases by the date of symptoms’ onset, from
early February to late May as reported by national health authorities. In Italy, this data is
available solely in graphic format in the reports published by the Istituto Superiore di Sanità

(ISS), whereas Spain has made this data publicly available only recently in
machine-readable format. Secondly, we use the time-series of reported cases by notification
date, as provided by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). The
third time-series of symptoms’ onset is inferred (Inferred Symptoms A) by applying a
convolution to the time-series of notification dates with the probability distribution P(∆t) of the
elapsed time between the dates of symptom onset and laboratory confirmation, measured
from a large line list dataset [7]. Lastly, another time-series of symptoms’ onset could be
inferred (Inferred Symptoms B) by backwards shifting the dates of laboratory-confirmed
deaths by 11 days, which corresponds to the median time elapsed between symptom onset
and death in Spain1 and Italy2. The resulting time-series of real symptoms’ onset, notification
date and inferred symptoms’ onset A and B are shown in Fig. 1.

Figure 1. Time-series of the incidence by real symptom onset, notification date, inferred symptom
onset by convolution with P(∆t) and time-shifted confirmed deaths in Spain (left) and Italy (right).
Time-series are smoothed with a moving average of 7 days.

One can see how the time-series of the time-shifted deaths, while obtained with a rough
approximation, is remarkably similar to the time-series of the symptom onset dates inferred
through the delay distribution P(∆t). However, both curves fail to match the true epidemic
curve by symptom onset, which peaks earlier and declines faster than the two inferred
curves. Note also that there is a significant delay between the time-series of the real
symptom onset and the notification date, as reported by the ECDC, and that such delay is
not constant in time.

Results
For each time-series, we calculate the Time-Varying Reproduction Number R(t) by means of
EpiEstim​, a state-of-the-art method for the estimation of R(t), currently adopted by several
national public health authorities [8]. Note that since surveillance data consolidates as time
goes by, our R(t) estimations do not take into account the last month of data.
Figure 2 shows a comparison of the values obtained for R(t) for each of the time series
considered. The comparison reveals remarkable differences between the different R(t)
curves. Several observations, which hold for both countries, are in order. First, neither the
incidence curve by notification date, nor the ones by inferred symptoms’ onset allow for a
correct assessment of the early behavior of the epidemic. The curve obtained using the
symptom onset inferred by convolution underestimates the true R(t) value, while those
corresponding to notification dates and time-shifted dates of death greatly overestimate it
(R(t) could be up to 6). Second, both of the inferred symptoms’ onset time-series yield R(t)
curves which, past the dates of implementation of the containment measures, decline slower
than the one obtained for the real symptoms’ onset. Third, only when using the time-series of
real symptoms’ onset, R(t) falls below 1 within 5-6 days after national lockdowns in both
countries, which is compatible with the incubation period of the disease [9]. On the contrary,
by using notification dates, R(t) does not fall below 1 until early April. These dates are
explicitly shown in Table 1.

Figure 2. Estimated R(t) curves for Spain (left) and Italy (right) for each of the four time-series
considered. We use EpiEstim with 7 days sliding windows and a gamma distributed serial interval with
shape 1.87 and rate 0.28 [10]. 95% credible intervals are plotted as pink areas. The dashed vertical
lines represent the dates in which main containment measures were applied in each country. For
Spain, the “second lockdown” represents the all non-essential activity closure that was implemented
on top of the lockdown imposed earlier.

Conclusions
During the COVID-19 pandemic, in a much-needed effort to promote data availability,
national health authorities of many countries have released, often on a daily basis and at a
sub-national spatial granularity, the time-series of epidemiologically relevant quantities as
measured through their surveillance systems. Such publicly-released data typically include
the new number of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 positives, hospitalized cases, and
deaths. Although the dates of symptoms’ onset are also collected by surveillance systems
for a fraction of cases, such information is often missing from publicly available data. For
instance, until June 2020, Spanish authorities only released the aggregated time-series by
symptoms’ onset in graphic format for the whole country. Italy, on the other hand, has
periodically published this data for each region but until now only in graphic format. Finally,
the ECDC currently only reports the values by date of notification.
Our study quantifies the biases in the estimation of R(t) introduced by using surveillance
data different from the real dates of symptoms onset. In particular, we showed that inferring
the symptoms’ onset time-series from the notification date does not capture the early
dynamics of the epidemic. While it is known that the estimation of R(t) is sensitive to various
input parameters, such as the distribution of the serial interval and the generation time, our
study highlights the importance of relying on high-quality incidence data, rather than inferred
epidemic time-series.
Given the past, present, and future importance of a precise estimation of the time-varying
reproductive number for the management of the COVID-19 pandemic, our work calls for an
increased transparency in the data that are released publicly by health authorities, which
should make their best effort to collect and share incidence case counts by date of
symptoms onset - even for a fraction of the total. The effects of critical policy decisions,
including severe mobility restrictions and other containment measures, can indeed be
correctly evaluated only by using accurate case-based surveillance data.
