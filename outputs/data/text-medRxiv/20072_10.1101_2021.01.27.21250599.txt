A systematic review and meta-analysis on the safety and efficacy of tocilizumab in the

2

management of COVID-19

Abstract

5

Background: This systematic review and meta-analysis was aimed to evaluate the

6

therapeutic benefits and safety of tocilizumab (TCZ) in treating severe coronavirus disease

7

2019 (COVID-19) and associated health complications.

8

Methods: The electronic search was performed using PubMed, Scopus, CENTRAL

9

(Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (RCTs), and Google scholar databases to

10

identify the retrospective observational reports. The studies published from 01 January 2020

11

to 30th September 2020 involving comparison of TCZ group with SOC/control treatment

12

group were included. The studies included in this work involve RT-PCR confirmed cases of

13

COVID-19 (Population), having tocilizumab and corresponding SOC/control as interventions

14

(Intervention), comparison between tocilizumab versus SOC/control (Comparison) for the

15

parameter of interest. Mortality, incidences of ICU admission, need of mechanical ventilation

16

(MV), length of stay in the hospital (LOS), and length of stay in the ICU (LOS-ICU), and the

17

incidences of super-infection, bacteraemia, fugleman, pneumonia, and pulmonary thrombosis

18

were evaluated as the primary outcomes. The comparison will be between TCZ versus

19

standard of care (SOC)/placebo.

20

Results: Based on the inclusion criteria there were 24 retrospective studies involving 5686

21

subjects were included. The outcomes of the meta-analysis have revealed that the TCZ has

22

reduced the mortality (Mantel-Haenszel (M-H), random effects risk difference (RE-RD) of -

23

0.11 (-0.18 to -0.04), at 95% CI, p = 0.001, I2 = 88%) and increased the incidences of super-

24

infections (M-H, RE-Risk ratio (RR) of 1.49 (1.13 to 1.96) at 95% CI, p=0.004, I2 = 47%).

25

However, there is no significant difference in ICU admissions rate (M-H, RE-RD of -0.06 (-

26

0.23 to 0.12) at 95% CI, p=0.54, I2 = 93%), need of MV (M-H, RE-RD of 0.00 (-0.06 to 0.07)

at 95% CI, p=0.96, I2 = 74%), LOS (Inverse variance (IV): -2.86 (-0.91 to 3.38) at 95% CI,

2

p=0.37, I2 = 100%), LOS-ICU (IV: -3.93 (-12.35 to 4.48) at 95% CI, p=0.36, I2 = 100%), and

3

incidences of pulmonary thrombosis (M-H, fixed effect odds ratio (FE-OR) of 1.01 (0.45 to

4

2.26) at 95% CI, p=0.99, I2 = 0%) compared to SOC/control.

5

Conclusion: This meta-analysis was performed using retrospective clinical reports on the use

6

of tocilizumab in COVID-19 and based on the outcomes of the meta-analysis we can

7

conclude that administration of TCZ would reduce the risk of mortality, and however there is

8

no much difference observed between the TCZ and SOC/control groups in other parameters

9

such as ICU admission rate, need of mechanical ventilation and length of hospital stay (ICU

10

and Non-ICU). On the other hand, TCZ treated subjects possess higher chances of super-

11

infections and pneumonia compared with SOC/control group. However, there is a need for

12

multi-centric randomized trials to determine the potential therapeutic role of TCZ in

13

mitigating COVID-19 and associated health complications.

Keywords: COVID 19; tocilizumab, cytokine storm, interleukin-6, retrospective studies.

1. Introduction

16

Coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) is a viral disease caused by severe acute respiratory

17

syndrome corona virus-2(SARS-CoV-2) that originated from Wuhan city of Hubei province

18

in China in December 2019[1]. Globally it has caused a significant burden on public health

19

through a drastic increase in the morbidity and mortality rate[2]. The available evidence

20

suggests that most of the infected patients will remain asymptomatic or develop mild

21

symptoms, however nearly 20% of the infected individuals would develop severe pneumonia

22

and respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that further progress to cytokine storm syndrome

23

and induced end-organ failure[3]. Interestingly, the United States Food and Drug

24

Administration (USFDA) has approved the drugs such as Remdesivir [4], Bamlanivimab [5],

25

and dexamethasone[6] for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Further, the

1

drugs such as decitabine [7], duvelisib [8], and infliximab [9] are currently under clinical

2

development phase for the treatment of COVID-19. In this context, it is well-known that

3

interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pleiotropic cytokine that plays a pivotal role in immune-regulation,

4

inflammation, and infection [10, 11]. Noteworthy, the elevated levels of IL-6 in the blood is

5

highly correlated with the mortality rate in the COVID-19 infected patients [12]. The

6

activation of the IL-6 amplifier would induce cytokine storm, a hallmark of dysregulated

7

inflammation, and thus inhibition or blockade of IL-6 amplifier would alleviate cytokine

8

storm in COVID-19 [12].In these lines many studies have reported that TCZ administration

9

could stabilize the health status of COVID-19 patients by improving respiratory functions,

10

reducing CRP levels, and improved health deteriorations due to COVID-19 [12]. Besides,

11

there are multiple case study series, retrospective and prospective study reports available on

12

the therapeutic benefits of TCZ in COVID-19. Though there are few randomized controlled

13

trials (RCTs) reported on the use of TCZ in COVID-19,

14

enrollments In those studies are considered as major limitations and authors have highlighted

15

the need of multicentric RCTs involving a higher number of subjects to determine the safety

16

and efficacy of tocilizumab in COVID-19. In this context, there are several randomized

17

controlled trials registered and under progress to evaluate the clinical benefits of TCZ in

18

alleviating COVID-19 and associated health problems (phase II; NCT04317092,

19

NCT04445272, NCT04377659, phase III; NCT04320615, NCT04330638, NCT04345445)

20

[13].

21

With this background, the present study was undertaken to evaluate the clinical benefits of

22

TCZ when administered alone and in combination with standard of care (SOC) and/or

23

placebo in reducing the COVID-19-induced mortality, ICU admissions, MV, LOS, LOS-

24

ICU, super-infections, and pulmonary thrombosis.

A detailed literature search was performed using electronic databases such as PubMed,

2

Science direct, CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (RCTs), and

3

google scholar to identify the clinical reports (retrospective). The keywords such as

4

'Coronavirus disease 2019' OR 'Coronavirus infection' OR ‘Coronavirus’ OR 'SARS COV-2'

5

OR 'nCOV 2019' 'Severe acute respiratory syndrome COV 2' AND ‘Tocilizumab’ OR

6

‘Interleukin-6 inhibitors’ OR ‘Cytokine storm’ and ‘COVID-19 treatment’ were used. Grey

7

(unpublished) literature was searched in the following trial registries: US National Institutes

8

of Health (NIH; https://clinicaltr ials.gov/) and the WHO International Clinical Trials

9

Registry Platform (ICTRP; https://apps.who.int/trialsearch/). Further, the pre-print servers

10

such as Research Square, bioRxiv.org, and medRxiv were also considered while searching

11

the grey literature. Besides, authors have approached the domain experts, seeking their

12

suggestions and inputs in identifying the additional studies (if any) relevant to the topic. The

13

search was not restricted to any publication language or status of the trial. Furthermore, the

14

reference lists of all relevant articles were hand-searched to find additional studies. An

15

example of a search strategy using PUBMED has been highlighted in Annexure 1.

16

5. Studies reporting qualitative outcomes without numerical data

5

2.3 Quality assessment and Risk of Bias analysis for included studies

6

All the included studies were subjected to the quality assessment using the Newcastle-Ottawa

7

scale and also evaluated for risk of bias using the Cochrane Collaboration tool to assess The

8

Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I).

9

2.4. Parameters

10

The parameters related to COVID-19 such as Mortality, ICU (intensive care unit) ward

11

admission rate, the need of mechanical ventilation, length of hospital stay (LOS), length of

12

hospital stay in the ICU (LOS-ICU), and the incidences events such as super-infections,

13

fungemia, bacteremia, pneumonia, and pulmonary thrombosis were evaluated as the primary

14

outcomes. The comparison will be between TCZ and standard care/placebo/control.

15

2.5. Data collection, extraction, and Analysis

16

Data collected was analyzed separately by two reviewers based on the inclusion and

17

exclusion criteria listed above. The analysis was carried out at three levels namely on title,

18

abstract and full-text level. Any disagreement was resolved by discussing it with the third

19

reviewer. Data such as details of participants, methods, interventions, frequency/duration of

20

treatment, outcome measurements, and adverse effects were extracted from the included

21

studies. For studies that reported results only in graphical form, numerical values from the

22

graphs were extracted using Adobe® Reader® XI inbuilt measuring tool, version 11.0.06,

23

(Adobe Systems Incorporated, San Jose [California]).

Copenhagen, Denmark; 2014) shall be used to analyze the data. For continuous, variables,

3

inverse variance (IV) was estimated using the random-effects model with a mean difference

4

(MD) or standardized mean difference (SMD) as an effect measure and for the dichotomous

5

variables, the Mantel-Haenszel (M-H) statistic was estimated using a random-effects model

6

with an odds ratio (OR) or fixed-effects model with a risk ratio (RR) as the effect measure. A

7

random or fixed-effects model shall be used to calculate the pooled prevalence with a 95%

8

confidence interval (CI). Heterogeneity shall be calculated with the I2 statistic. This test

9

estimates the percentage of variation between study results that is due to heterogeneity rather

10

than sampling error. I2 of less than 40% is considered unimportant while that of more than

11

40% is viewed as moderate to considerable heterogeneity.

12

3. Results

13

A total of 1425 articles were identified based on the online search, of which 24 articles

14

involving 5676 participants were selected for systematic review and meta-analysis (List of

15

excluded studies based on the full-text screening are given in Annexure 2). The PRISMA

16

flow chart of the studies selected is given in Figure 1. Only Retrospective studies were

17

selected for the analysis; the characteristics of the included studies are summarized in

18

Table 1. In all the included studies TCZ was common and the effect of TCZ was compared

19

with the control group; while in few studies, both standard treatment and TCZ groups had

20

background/previously received either antibiotics, antiviral drugs and corticosteroids, and

21

oxygen which are considered as the standard of care (SOC), and in these studies, the

22

comparison was made between TCZ + SOC versus SOC alone, here the SOC alone is

23

considered as placebo. In the studies where multiple doses of TCZ was used, the response for

24

mid-dose was considered for analysis. In this study, the parameters such as mortality, ICU

25

ward admission rate, need of mechanical ventilation (MV), Length of Hospital Stay (LOS),

3.2. Efficacy

9

The improvement in the parameters such as mortality, ICU ward admission rate, need of

10

mechanical ventilation (MV), Length of Hospital Stay (LOS), and Length of Hospital Stay in

11

ICU (LOS-ICU) were considered for evaluating and concluding the efficacy of TCZ

12

compared to control group in COVID-19 positive patients.

13

3.2.1. Mortality rate

14

The COVID-19 positive patients treated with TCZ have shown a mortality rate of 24.3 %

15

(448/1841), whereas the control group received SOC has a mortality rate of 31.2%

16

(1079/3454). The outcomes of the meta-analysis have revealed that the TCZ treatment has

17

reduced the mortality rate (Mantel-Haenszel (M-H), random effects risk difference (RE-RD)

18

of -0.11 (-0.18 to -0.04), at 95% CI, p = 0.001, I2 = 88%) compared to control/SOC. The

19

effect of TCZ on COVID-19 induced mortality of depicted in Figure 3.

3.2.2. ICU ward admission rate

21

Six retrospectives studies involving 542 patients in the TCZ treatment and 1595 patients in

22

the control/SOC, with a total of 2137 COVID-19 positive patients were considered for the

23

analysis. The outcomes of the meta-analysis revealed that there is a statistically significant

3.2.3. need of Mechanical ventilation (MV)

4

Twelve retrospectives studies involving 756 patients in the TCZ treatment and 1052 patients

5

in the control/SOC, with a total of 1808 COVID-19 positive patients were considered for the

6

analysis. The outcomes have revealed that there is no difference between the TCZ and

7

control/SOC group in the terms of need of mechanical ventilation during the hospitalization

8

(M-H, RE-RD of 0.00 (-0.06 to 0.07) at 95% CI, p=0.96, I2 = 74%). The forest plot analysis

9

is depicted in Figure 5.

10

3.2.4. Effect of TCZ on Length of Hospital Stay (LOS)

11

The LOS was evaluated by considering the eight retrospective studies comprising of a total of

12

2030 COVID-19 positive patients, of which 1395 (68.7%) patients were assigned to the TCZ

13

treatment arm and 635 (31.2%) patients were into the control/SOC group. The results of the

14

meta-analysis showed that there was substantial heterogeneity among the included studies

15

(I2=100%) and there was no statistically significant difference in LOS (days), observed

16

between the TCZ and control/SOC groups (Inverse variance (IV): -2.86 (-0.91 to 3.38) at

17

95% CI, p=0.37, I2 = 100%). The forest plot analysis for LOS is depicted in Figure 6.

18

3.2.5. Effect of TCZ on Length of Hospital stay in ICU (LOS-ICU)

19

The LOS-ICU was analyzed using three retrospective studies including a total of 1325

20

COVID-19 positive patients, of which 308 (23.2%) patients were assigned to the TCZ + SOC

21

treatment arm and 1017 (76.8%) patients were into the control/SOC group. The results of the

22

meta-analysis showed that there was substantial heterogeneity among the included studies

23

(I2=100%) and there was no statistically significant difference in LOS-ICU (days) observed

24

between the TCZ and control/SOC groups (IV: -3.93 (-12.35 to 4.48) at 95% CI, p=0.36, I2 =

25

100%). The forest plot analysis for LOS is depicted in Figure 7.

3.2.6. Incidence of Toclimuzab-induced infections

2

3.2.6 a. Super-infections

3

The incidence of TCZ-induced super-infections was determined from the eight retrospective

4

studies carried on 1,441 patients out of which 800 (55.5%) were under the control/SOC group

5

and 641(44.4%) patients were considered under the TCZ group.

6

The meta-analysis revealed that the chances of super-infections are slightly high in the TCZ

7

treated group compared to control/SOC (M-H, RE-RR of 1.59 (1.05, 2.41) at 95% CI,

8

p=0.03, I2 = 63%), however, there is a significant heterogenicity among the studies included

9

for the analysis.

10

3.2.6 b. Fungemia

11

The incidence of TCZ-induced fungemia was determined from the three retrospective studies

12

carried on 392 patients, out of which 194 (49.5%) were under the control group and

13

198(50.5%) patients were assigned under the TCZ group. The meta-analysis revealed that

14

there is no statistically significant difference among the TCZ and control/SOC groups

15

observed in the incidences of fungemia (M-H, RE-RR of 1.68 (0.52, 5.47) at 95% CI, p=0.03,

16

I2 = 0%).

17

3.1.6 c. Bacteremia

18

The incidence of TCZ-induced bacteremia was determined from the four retrospective studies

19

carried in 956 patients, out of which 571 (59.3%) patients were under the control/SOC group

20

and 385 (40.2%) patients were assigned under the TCZ group. The outcomes of the meta-

21

analysis showed no difference among the TCZ and control/SOC groups, in the incidences of

22

bacteremia (M-H, RE-RR of 0.92 (0.51, 1.66) at 95% CI, p=0.78, I2 = 33%).

23

3.2.6 d. Pneumonia

assigned into the TCZ group. The outcomes of the analysis revealed that TCZ treated group

2

has more chances of pneumonia compared to the control/SOC group (M-H, RE-RR of 1.88

3

(1.33, 2.66) at 95% CI, p=0.0004, I2 = 0%).

4

In the summary, the incidence of super-infections, fungemia, bacteremia, and pneumonia

5

were compared and analyzed between the TCZ and control/SOC groups by including a total

6

of 3,686 patients out of which 2,103 (57.1%) were in the control/SOC group (never received

7

TCZ) and 1,583 (42.9%) patients were assigned under TCZ group (received TCZ + SOC).

8

Overall, the incidences of infections (super-infections, fungemia, bacteremia, and

9

pneumonia) are considered to be high in the TCZ treated group compared to control/SOC (M-

10

H, RE-RR of 1.49 (1.13, 1.96) at 95% CI, p=0.0004), however, there is a substantial

11

heterogeneity exists among the included studies (I2=47%). The forest plot analysis of the

12

incidence of TCZ-induced infections is depicted in Figure 8.

13

3.2.7. Incidence of Toclimuzab-induced pulmonary thrombosis

14

The incidence of pulmonary thrombosis was determined from the two retrospective studies

15

carried on 193 patients, of which 97 (50.3%) patients were under the control/SOC group and

16

96(49.7%) patients were assigned under the TCZ group (received at least one dose of TCZ).

17

The outcomes of the analysis revealed that there was no significant difference in the

18

incidences of pulmonary thrombosis between TCZ and control/SOC treated groups (M-H,

19

fixed effect odds ratio (FE-OR) of 1.01 (0.45 to 2.26) at 95% CI, p=0.99, I2 = 0%). The forest

20

plot analysis of the incidence of TCZ-induced pulmonary thrombosis is depicted in Figure 9.

4. Discussion

22

This systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to collect, analyze, interpret and

23

conclude the efficacy and safety of TCZ in the treatment of COVID-19 positive subjects.

burden throughout the world [14]. Many multi-national organizations, research organizations,

2

and academic researchers are extensively working on developing an effective treatment for

3

COVID-19 [15]. As of now, it has been symptomatically managed by using already existing

4

medications such as antivirals (remdesivir, oseltamivir, etc.), anti-pyretic (paracetamol), anti-

5

histaminic

6

methylprednisolone), monoclonal antibodies (tocilizumab, imatinib) [16]. In this context, the

7

IL-6 antagonists are considered to have better therapeutic benefits in the symptomatic

8

management of COVID-19, in these lines, TCZ is considered as one of the most commonly

9

used medication to suppress the cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients [17]. There are

10

multiple case series, retrospective, and prospective studies available on the therapeutic role of

11

TCZ in COVID-19. Also, there are few meta-analysis reports published related to the

12

therapeutic use of TCZ in COVID-19. However, this study was focused to provide an overall

13

view on the efficacy and safety of TCZ in COVID-19 patients considering the retrospective

14

studies/reports available on the topic till October 2020.

15

Based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria a total of 24 retrospective studies were selected

16

for this study, comprising of 5686 COVID-19 positive patients. The parameters such as

17

mortality, ICU ward admission rate, need of Mechanical ventilation, Length of Hospital Stay,

18

Length of Hospital stay in ICU, Incidence of super-infections such as fungemia, bacteremia,

19

pneumonia, and pulmonary thrombosis were considered for systematic review and meta-

20

analysis.

21

The available literature favors the benefit of TCZ in minimizing the COVID-19 induced

22

mortality [18, 19, 20, 21]. In this study, 22 included studies have reported mortality as a

23

parameter of which 16 studies have supported the use of TCZ in minimizing the mortality,

24

and 6 studies have shown results in the favor of control. The outcome of the meta-analysis

revealed that the administration of TCZ could benefit the COVID-19 positive patients in

2

minimizing the COVID-19 induced mortality.

3

Further, among the hospitalized COVID-19 positive patients about 5-10% population

4

requires ICU admission [22,23]. In this regard, some of the available reports have supported

5

the use of TCZ in reducing the incidences of ICU admission [22, 24, 25]. However, the

6

outcomes of the present meta-analysis showed that there is no significant difference between

7

the TCZ and control/SOC groups in the incidences of ICU admission among the COVID-19

8

infected patients.

9

Moreover, about 89.9% of ICU cases and 20.2% of hospitalized COVID-19 positive patients

10

require mechanical ventilation (Invasive and/or Non-invasive) [26], and the role of TCZ in

11

reducing the need for MV has been evaluated in multiple studies [27, 28, 29,30, 31]. In the

12

present study, 12 retrospective studies reporting the MV as a parameter were included, of

13

these 12 studies, 7 studies have reported in favor of TCZ, 5 studies have reported in the

14

favors of control/SOC and 1 study was neutral. The outcomes of the meta-analysis revealed

15

that the need for MV is the same between TCZ and control/SOC treated groups.

16

Besides, length of stay (LOS and LOS-ICU) is the one of important parameters considered

17

for evaluating the efficacy in COVID-19 patients. As per the available data, the median LOS

18

was found to be 4 to 21 days (outside China) and median LOS-ICU was found to be 4 to 19

19

days (outside China) [32]. In this regard, 8 studies reporting LOS and 3 studies reporting

20

LOS-ICU were included in the present study. On the overview, the TCZ treatment has shown

21

benefit in minimizing the LOS and LOZ-ICU compared to control/SOC. However, there was

22

no statistically significant difference observed between the TCZ and control/SOC groups, due

23

to the significant heterogenicity (I2 = 100%) associated with the included studies.

24

On the other hand, the safety of TCZ is the prime concern while administering to COVDI-19

25

patients. The available literature suggests that TCZ administration can cause adverse (AEs)

and serious adverse events (SAEs) such as super-infections, fungemia, bacteremia,

2

pneumonia, pulmonary thrombosis, and so on [30, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37]. Therefore, the

3

incidences of events such as these adverse events were compared between the TCZ and

4

control/SOC treated groups using the 9 included studies. The outcomes of the meta-analysis

5

revealed that the TCZ administration has higher chances of producing the events such as

6

super-infections, fungemia, bacteremia, pneumonia, and pulmonary thrombosis compared to

7

control/SOC.

8

Further, we found that there are 7 systematic reviews and meta-analyses published on the role

9

of tocilizumab in the treatment of COVID-19 [45, 46, 47, 48,49, 50, 51]. However, a meta-

10

analysis published by Aziz et al [45] has a close association with this meta-analysis. Aziz et

11

al., included 23 studies involving 6279 patients, and the parameters such as mortality, need for

12

mechanical ventilation, ICU admission, and secondary infections were considered as parameters [45].

13

However, we have included additional parameters such a LOS, LOS-ICU, role of TCZ treatment on

14

incidences of super-infections, and also evaluated the incidences of TCZ-induced pulmonary

15

thrombosis. In addition, our analysis has a greater number of studies in the parameters like mortality

16

and the need for mechanical ventilation. Lastly, in the conclusion section Aziz et al., have stated that

17

TCZ treatment has the potential to decrease the mortality rate in severe COVID-19 patients without

18

causing a significant increase in the infection rate [45].

19

Commenting on other meta-analysis works, Zhao et. al, have performed a meta-analysis to

20

evaluate the efficacy of TCZ treatment in severe COVID-19 patients including 10 studies,

21

comprising 1675 patients. Mortality, admission to ICU, safety, and efficacy were considered

22

for analysis. This study has concluded that TCZ treatment could reduce mortality

23

significantly compared to control/SOC in severe COVID-19 patients [46]. Further, the meta-

24

analysis performed by Liu et. al., has included 28 studies consisting of 991 COVID-19

25

confirmed patients receiving TCZ. Based on the meta-analysis, authors have concluded that

26

TCZ could improve the clinical outcome of COVID-19 patients, particularly TCZ

administration has reduced the death rate in severe COVID-19 cases [47]. Moreover, Surjit

2

Singh et. al have performed a meta-analysis related to the safety and efficacy of TCZ in

3

COVID-19 patients, they have included a total of 13 observational studies comprising 2750

4

patients. The parameters like mortality, ICU admission, hospital discharge, clinical

5

improvement, secondary bacteremia, secondary pneumonia, or superinfections were

6

considered for analysis. Based on the detailed analysis Surjit Singh et. al has concluded that

7

there is a 46% decrease in mortality rate, and a 66% decrease in the progression of diseases in

8

TCZ treated group compared to the group receiving standard of care (SOC) [48]. Besides,

9

Boregowda et. al. included 16 studies consisting of 3641 patients. Based on the analysis the

10

authors have concluded that the addition of TCZ to the standard regimen could reduce the

11

mortality in severe COVID-19 patients, which is coinciding with our conclusion of reducing

12

the risk of mortality upon treating with TCZ [49]. On the other hand, Kotak S et al carried a

13

meta-analysis including 13 studies consists of a total of 766 patients, and the parameters such

14

as mortality, need for artificial invasive ventilation requirement, ICU admission rate, risk of

15

post-drug infection, improved oxygen saturation were considered for analysis. Authors have

16

concluded that TCZ is safe and effective in reducing mortality among critically ill COVID-19

17

patients. However, this study has study very limited numbers of observations. However, a

18

systematic review performed by Lan et al. has concluded that the available pieces of evidence

19

not strong enough to derive a conclusive decision about the benefit of TCZ in treating

20

COVID-19 and associated health complications. They have included 7 retrospective studies

21

comprising of 592 adult COVID-19 patients. The parameters such as mortality, risk of ICU

22

admission, and need for mechanical ventilation were considered and the outcomes [51].

23

Overall, based on the outcomes of this meta-analysis we can conclude that the administration

24

of TCZ would reduce the risk of mortality, and however, there is no much difference

25

observed between the TCZ and SOC/control groups in other parameters such as ICU

admission rate, need of mechanical ventilation and length of hospital stay (ICU and Non-

2

ICU). On the other hand, TCZ treated subjects possess higher chances of adverse events like

3

super-infections, fungemia, bacteremia, pneumonia, and pulmonary thrombosis compared to

4

the control/SOC group.

5

5. Conclusions

6

This meta-analysis was performed using retrospective clinical reports on the use of TCZ in

7

COVID-19, and based on the outcomes of the meta-analysis we can conclude that

8

administration of TCZ would reduce the risk of mortality, and however, there is no much

9

difference observed between the TCZ and SOC/control groups in other parameters such as

10

ICU admission rate, need of mechanical ventilation and length of hospital stay (ICU and

11

Non-ICU). On the other hand, TCZ treated subjects possess higher chances of super-

12

infections and pneumonia compared with SOC/control group. All the included studies have

13

passed the quality assessment and showed a low risk of bias. However, the major limitation

14

of this study is the significant heterogenicity observed in the outcomes due to multiple

15

confounding factors, and hence there is a need for multi-centric randomized trials involving a

16

large COVID-19 patient population, proper adjustment of confounders like SOC medications

17

to determine the potential therapeutic role of TCZ in mitigating COVID-19 and associated

18

health complications.

19

6. Limitations

20

Though the meta-analysis of the available evidence supports the benefit of TCZ in

21

minimizing the COVID-19-induced mortality and other complications compared to

22

SOC/placebo/control. There was a moderate to significant heterogenicity observed in the

23

outcomes of the various parameters evaluated. Interestingly, the observed heterogenicity

24

between the included studies is due to multiple reasons as highlighted below. All the included

25

studies are observational, and the confounders associated with one or two included studies

may also influence the outcomes to a large extent. Besides, since there was no specific

2

treatment available for COVID-19 (before the approval of vaccine), the therapies are

3

dynamically evolving with each passing day, therefore the comparator group or standard of

4

care (SOC) or control group has varied significantly from study to study, this is also one of

5

the potential causes for heterogenicity observed. Lastly, there was no standard treatment

6

regimen available for tocilizumab use in the included studies, like there is the difference in

7

dosage regimen (strength and number of doses), route of administration, time of

8

administration, age, and gender difference. These are some of the possible reasons for

9

significant heterogenicity observed in the outcomes of the present study.
