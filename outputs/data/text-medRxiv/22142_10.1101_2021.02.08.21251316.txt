Abstract (250/250)
Background: People with multiple sclerosis (MS) are a vulnerable group for severe COVID19, particularly those taking immunosuppressive disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). We
examined the characteristics of COVID-19 severity in an international sample of people with
MS.
Methods: Data from 12 data-sources in 28 countries were aggregated. Demographic and
clinical covariates were queried, alongside COVID-19 clinical severity outcomes,
hospitalisation, admission to ICU, requiring artificial ventilation, and death. Characteristics of
outcomes were assessed in patients with suspected/confirmed COVID-19 using multilevel
mixed-effects logistic regression.

Results: 657 (28.1%) with suspected and 1,683 (61.9%) with confirmed COVID-19 were
analysed. Older age, progressive MS-phenotype, and higher disability were associated with
worse COVID-19 outcomes. Compared to dimethyl fumarate, ocrelizumab and rituximab
were associated with hospitalisation (aOR=1.56,95%CI=1.01-2.41; aOR=2.43,95%CI=1.484.02) and ICU admission (aOR=2.30,95%CI=0.98-5.39; aOR=3.93,95%CI=1.56-9.89),
though only rituximab was associated with higher risk of artificial ventilation
(aOR=4.00,95%CI=1.54-10.39). Compared to pooled other DMTs, ocrelizumab and
rituximab were associated with hospitalisation (aOR=1.75,95%CI=1.29-2.38;
aOR=2.76,95%CI=1.87-4.07) and ICU admission (aOR=2.55,95%CI=1.49-4.36;
aOR=4.32,95%CI=2.27-8.23) but only rituximab with artificial ventilation
(aOR=6.15,95%CI=3.09-12.27). Compared to natalizumab, ocrelizumab and rituximab were
associated with hospitalisation (aOR=1.86,95%CI=1.13-3.07; aOR=2.88,95%CI=1.68-4.92)
and ICU admission (aOR=2.13,95%CI=0.85-5.35; aOR=3.23,95%CI=1.17-8.91), but only
rituximab with ventilation (aOR=5.52,95%CI=1.71-17.84). Importantly, associations
persisted on restriction to confirmed COVID-19 cases. No associations were observed
between DMTs and death.
Conclusions: Using the largest cohort of people with MS and COVID-19 available, we
demonstrated consistent associations of rituximab with increased risk of hospitalisation, ICU
admission, and requiring artificial ventilation, and ocrelizumab with hospitalisation and ICU
admission, suggesting their use may be a risk factor for more severe COVID-19.

Introduction

Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) that act by immunomodulatory/immunosuppressive
mechanisms are a mainstay of treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) but can increase infection

susceptibility1. Of current concern is the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, the cause of
Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19)2. It remains unclear whether people with MS,
especially those treated with immunosuppressive DMTs, are more susceptible to more severe
COVID-19. Case-series3-6 and cohort7-9 studies suggest that MS in general does not increase
risk for developing severe COVID-19, but comorbidities, age, sex, progressive MSphenotype, and higher disability do7, 9.

Some studies have also identified associations of certain DMT classes, particularly B-celldepleting DMTs, with COVID-19 severity. However, this varied among studies, potentially
due to limited sample size and regional differences in DMT usage7, 9. Large and
geographically inclusive cohorts are required to assess the risk of severe COVID-19 for
specific MS DMTs. Accordingly, we established a global data-sharing initiative10 to
investigate characteristics of COVID-19 severity in people with MS.

Methods

Data-sources
This study was approved by the ethical committee of Hasselt University [CME2020/025].
Individual data-sources obtained additional ethics approval as required.

Data from a core questionnaire regarding COVID-19, and relevant patient demographic and
neurological information, were reported by treating clinicians, as described previously10. Data
were entered in three fashions: 1) “Direct entry to central platform”; 2) “Patient-level data
sharing via participating registries/cohorts”, where MS registries and cohorts are regularly
invited to share and upload their COVID-19 core dataset into the central data platform; and 3)

“Aggregated data sharing via participating registries/cohorts”, where some registries do not
share patient-level data, but share aggregated results from specific queries. Multidimensional
contingency tables from 12 different data-sources were merged and then a combined
anonymised dataset was reconstructed.
Data was entered for a given participant once, but information for that participant could be
reentered and this then replacing the original record. This thus made for serial iterations of
the analysis dataset, which were analysed over time as the dataset expanded, thus allowing
for assessment of temporal consistency of observed associations. Previous iterations of the
dataset have been presented11 but this article describes only the present iteration of the
dataset.

Role of the funding source
The study sponsors had no role in the study design, data collection, analysis, interpretation
data, in the writing of the report, or the decision to submit for publication.

Definition of variables
COVID-19 status was defined as confirmed, based on a positive diagnostic test, or suspected,
based on clinician judgement.

Patient age at the time of reporting was categorised into four groups: 0-17, 18-49, 50-69, and

≥70 years; the 0-17 group was excluded (n=5). MS-phenotype was grouped into relapsingremitting MS (RRMS) and progressive MS (SPMS, PPMS). Disability was assessed by the
Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)12 or Neurostatus13. Disability was dichotomised
into 0-6.0 and >6.0. Comorbidities were queried, including cardiovascular disease,
hypertension, diabetes, chronic liver disease, kidney disease, other

neurological/neuromuscular disorder, lung disease, or malignant neoplasia. BMI was
categorised as non-obese (BMI≤30) and obese (BMI>30). Current smoker status was queried
as yes or no. Current DMT use was queried, including alemtuzumab, cladribine, dimethyl
fumarate, fingolimod, glatiramer-acetate, beta interferons, natalizumab, ocrelizumab,
rituximab, siponimod, teriflunomide, or Other DMT. Due to patient numbers <20 among the
suspected/confirmed COVID-19 cases, siponimod (n=12) was aggregated with Other DMT.

Statistical analysis
Associations with hospitalisation, ICU admission, ventilation, and death were assessed using
multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression, random effects grouped by data source, as
univariable and adjusted for age, sex, MS-phenotype, and disability. In addition, sensitivityanalyses were completed serially excluding each data-source to assess whether influential
data sources underlay associations. Subgroup analyses were also undertaken where data on
comorbidities, BMI, and smoking were available, allowing additional adjustment for these
covariates. All analyses were complete-case.

For DMTs, individual DMTs were first compared with dimethyl fumarate. Despite leading to
lymphopenia in some patients, dimethyl fumarate has not been associated with increased risk
of infection14, and its biological mechanism of action is unlikely to interfere with the
immunological response to SARS-CoV-215, while being common in the sample. Next
ocrelizumab and rituximab and the untreated were compared with pooled other DMTs.
Finally, ocrelizumab and rituximab were evaluated vs natalizumab to assess ascertainment
bias, since natalizumab-treated patients present for infusions every 28-42 days, compared to
biannual infusions for anti-CD20 DMTs.

Data analyses were carried out using STATA/SE 16.0 (StataCorp, College Station, USA).

Results
The cohort comprised 2,340 patients, of whom 657 (28.1%) had suspected COVID-19 and
1,683 (71.9%) had confirmed COVID-19. Among suspected/confirmed COVID-19 cases,
which was the primary analysis dataset, 20.9% were hospitalised, 5.4% admitted to ICU,
4.1% required artificial ventilation, and 3.2% died. Proportions were slightly higher among
confirmed COVID-19 cases (Table 1).

Cohort characteristics
Data sources were located in: 1) Sweden (n=290); 2) Australia, Belgium, Brasil, Kuwait,
Romania, Saudi Arabia, Turkey (n=97); 3) Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Honduras,
Mexico (n=159); 4) Bulgaria (n=3); 5) Germany, Italy (n=45); 6) Denmark (n=56); 7) Brasil
(n=96); 8) Australia, Bahamas, Belgium, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Netherlands, New
Zealand, Serbia, Spain, UK, USA (n=114); 9) Germany (n=41); 10) USA (n=1,161); 11) UK
(n=131); 12) Spain (n=147). Sources-2 and 10 had higher proportions with confirmed
COVID-19 and Sources-4 and 5 higher with non-suspected COVID-19. Among
suspected/confirmed COVID-19 cases, hospitalisation was higher in Source-11 and lower in
Sources-2, 4, 5, and 7; ICU admission was higher in Sources-3, 9, and 10, and lower in
Sources-2, 4, 7, 9, 11, and 12; ventilation was higher in Sources-3 and 8, and lower in
Sources-2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 11; death was higher in Source-11 and lower in Sources-2, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, and 9. Results were comparable on restriction to confirmed-only COVID-19 (data not
shown).

Compared to dimethyl fumarate, a lower proportion of females were untreated or treated with
interferon or ocrelizumab (Table S1). Larger proportions of those aged 50-69 and ≥70 were
untreated or treated with ocrelizumab, teriflunomide, or Other DMT. Greater proportions of
progressive MS patients were untreated or treated with ocrelizumab, rituximab, or Other
DMTs. Of more disabled patients (EDSS>6), higher proportions were either untreated or
treated with ocrelizumab or Other DMTs. Similar results were seen among confirmed-only
COVID-19 (data not shown).

COVID-19 severity, by clinical and demographic characteristics
Demographic and clinical characteristics of hospitalisation and ICU admission (Table 2) and
requiring artificial ventilation and death (Table 3) among suspected/confirmed COVID-19
cases were assessed. In multivariable models, female sex showed an inverse trend with risks
of hospitalisation and death, while older age was positively associated with hospitalisation
and death. Progressive MS-phenotype was associated with higher risk of hospitalisation.
Higher EDSS was associated with higher risks of all outcomes. Among confirmed-only
COVID-19, most of these associations persisted (Tables S2-S3).

In the subset of data sources with data available, having comorbidities was associated with
increased risk of death and obese BMI with increased risks of hospitalisation, ICU admission,
and ventilation, while smoking was not associated with any outcomes.

COVID-19 severity, by DMT
Compared to dimethyl fumarate, rituximab use was associated with greater risks of
hospitalisation (aOR=2.43), ICU admission (aOR=3.93), and artificial ventilation (aOR=4.00,
Table 4). Ocrelizumab showed similar trends for hospitalisation (aOR=1.56) and ICU

admission (aOR=2.30), but not artificial ventilation (aOR=1.04). No DMTs were associated
with death. Untreated patients had increased risk of hospitalisation (aOR=1.79) but no
independent associations with other outcomes were seen. These associations persisted among
confirmed-only COVID-19 (Figures 1-3, Table S4).

COVID-19 severity: anti-CD20 DMTs vs pooled other DMTs
Compared to all other DMTs (Table 4), those using rituximab had higher risks of
hospitalisation (aOR=2.76), ICU admission (aOR=4.32), and artificial ventilation
(aOR=6.15). Ocrelizumab showed similar trends for hospitalisation (aOR=1.75) and ICU
admission (aOR=2.55) but not ventilation (aOR=1.60). Neither rituximab or ocrelizumab
were associated with risk of death. Untreated patients had increased risks of hospitalisation
(aOR=2.05), ventilation (aOR=2.07), and death (aOR=2.53). These results persisted among
confirmed-only COVID-19 cases (Table S5).

COVID-19 severity, anti-CD20 DMTs vs natalizumab
Compared to natalizumab, rituximab was associated with higher risks of hospitalisation
(aOR=2.88), ICU admission (aOR=3.23), and ventilation (aOR=5.52, Table 4). Ocrelizumab
showed similar trends for hospitalisation (aOR=1.86), but did not reach significance for ICU
admission and was not associated with ventilation. Neither rituximab or ocrelizumab was
associated with increased risk of death. Results were similar among confirmed-only COVID19 (Table S5).

sample, we utilised random-effects logistic regression. However, in addition, serial exclusion
analyses were undertaken wherein analyses were run excluding each dataset in turn. These
analyses showed no material differences in associations compared to the main analysis (data
not shown).

Stratification sensitivity analyses
To assess whether the associations seen for ocrelizumab and rituximab with outcomes was
genuinely a function of the DMTs, rather than the characteristics of patients commonly
treated with these medications (older, progressive MS, higher disability), we undertook
stratified analyses evaluating associations among persons aged>70 years vs ≤70, among
RRMS vs progressive, and among EDSS≤6 vs EDSS>6. These analyses showed that
associations were actually present in persons of younger age, of RRMS phenotype, and lower
EDSS, indicating that the observed associations were a function of the DMT, not underlying
risk profile (Tables S6-S8).

Discussion

In the largest sample of people with MS with suspected and confirmed COVID-19 to date, we
demonstrated that the anti-CD20 DMTs rituximab, and to a lesser extent ocrelizumab, were
associated with more severe COVID-19. Compared to dimethyl fumarate, pooled other
DMTs, and natalizumab, anti-CD20 DMTs were associated with higher risks of
hospitalisation and ICU admission, while only rituximab was associated with greater risk of
requiring artificial ventilation for each analysis. Comparison to natalizumab is particularly
important, suggesting that anti-CD20 associations do not reflect ascertainment bias.
Regardless of comparator, rituximab consistently showed stronger associations with

outcomes than ocrelizumab for hospitalisation and ICU admission, and was solely associated
with requiring artificial ventilation. Moreover, DMT associations were not merely driven by
older patients, progressive MS-phenotype, or higher disability. We also found that older age,
progressive MS-phenotype, and higher disability were over-represented among MS patients
with more severe COVID-19. In sub-analyses where data was available, DMT associations
were robust to further adjustment for comorbidities, BMI, and smoking status.

Anti-CD20 DMTs, which selectively deplete circulating B-lymphocytes, alemtuzumab and
cladribine which act through broader immunosuppressive mechanisms, and fingolimod,
which sequesters lymphocytes from circulation, are highly effective MS treatments, but can
increase infection risk1, 16. This has raised concern during the COVID-19 pandemic and
national studies have investigated risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease in people with
MS. In the French COVISEP study7 of 347 MS patients (42.1% confirmed COVID-19), older
age, progressive MS-phenotype, higher disability, and comorbidities were associated with
COVID-19 severity. In addition, pooled DMTs with moderate/high risk of systemic infection
(fingolimod, ocrelizumab, rituximab, cladribine, alemtuzumab) were associated with 4.2times higher COVID-19 severity score than DMTs with no systemic infection risk
(interferon-, glatiramer-acetate). This amalgamation of DMTs is a limitation since, while
comparable in terms of their infection risk, these DMTs have markedly different modes of
action, especially in relation to the immunological response to SARS-CoV-215. More
recently, the Italian MuSC-19 national registry study of 593 suspected and 191 confirmed
COVID-19 cases, found anti-CD20 DMT use was associated with 2.6-times greater risk of
severe COVID-19 compared to dimethyl fumarate, adjusted for region, age, sex, MSphenotype, and recent methylprednisolone use9.

Untreated patients showed consistent positive trends towards associations with
hospitalisation, ICU admission, and requiring ventilation, albeit attenuating on adjustment.
This is in keeping with prior results. Louapre and colleagues found higher frequencies of
severe COVID-19 among the untreated vs treated (46.0% vs 15.5%), though this difference
did not persist on adjustment7. Sormani and colleagues compared untreated to dimethyl
fumarate-treated, finding they were 2.83-times more likely to have severe COVID-19, though
this disappeared on adjustment (aOR=1.04)9. The lack of independence of the untreated
associations here and previously likely reflects the untreated comprising to variable degree
people with more benign MS course or other reasons to not use DMTs, so adjustment for
MS-phenotype and disability largely captures differences in COVID-19 severity.

Of interest are the differences in the magnitudes of associations seen for ocrelizumab and
rituximab, since both bind the same CD20 epitope on the outer loop of the protein, albeit in
slightly different fashions17, 18. In comparison to dimethyl fumarate, to pooled other DMTs,
and to natalizumab, rituximab consistently showed stronger associations with outcomes than
ocrelizumab. Importantly, in analyses stratifying associations of DMT exposure with
COVID19 severity by age, MS-phenotype, and EDSS, there was no evidence that the antiCD20 DMT associations merely reflects patients with underlying risk factors being disposed
to use these treatments. The differences seen, both in magnitudes of associations with
hospitalisation and ICU admission and the lack of association with ventilation, are puzzling.
This weaker magnitude for ocrelizumab has been seen in prior iterations of the analysis but
also in those prior iterations ocrelizumab was significantly associated with ventilation as well
as hospitalisation and ICU admission, albeit of weaker magnitude11. That ocrelizumab was no
longer associated in this iteration of the data may reflect changes in medical practice for
COVID-19 treatment, including the introduction of more effective treatments that reduce the

need for patients to require artificial ventilation. The weaker magnitudes of associations may
reflect ocrelizumab’s slightly lower affinity to CD20 or possibly their different provenance,
rituximab being a chimeric IgG while ocrelizumab is humanised17, 18. Also, the mode of Bcell elimination differs, with ocrelizumab using more antibody and less complementmediated cytotoxicity compared to rituximab19. Alternatively, this difference may represent
unmeasured confounding as the dataset, while large, was limited in the number of
characteristics assessed, so potentially relevant factors like socioeconomic status and access
to care or factors impacting on respiratory health could not be assessed. That said, our results
are broadly in line with those seen in other studies7, 9, providing external consistency. This
preliminary observation is worth exploring in laboratory studies.

That anti-CD20 DMTs were not associated with death conflicts with the results seen for the
other outcomes, as well as with the MuSC-19 study which found a positive trend between
anti-CD20 DMTs and death. The issue may lie in ascertainment bias, with fewer of the older
patients included in our sample: we had only 9.1% of confirmed COVID-19 cases over 60
years old, vs 17.7% in the MuSC-19 cohort9. The potential impacts of these DMTs on death
due to COVID-19 should be further explored.

Limitations
In contrast to prior clinic-based studies, our cohort focused on a pre-defined limited set of
demographic and clinical characteristics10. Thus, we could not assess other clinical features,
particularly prior MS clinical course and DMT use, paraclinical information such as
radiological burden of MS, or the nuanced details of COVID-19 onset and evolution. Another
limitation of our data is that they likely comprise greater proportions of severe cases requiring

since treatment, since these both may have bearing on the degree of B-cell depletion and
thence on COVID-19 severity. This data was included in the core questionnaire but the level
of missingness was too high to be a component of analyses.

Heterogeneity in the definitions of exposure and outcomes and in patient inclusion among the
data-sources is a known problem in combining multiple data-sources. Related to this are the
differences in protocols for hospital and ICU admission and initiation of artificial ventilation
between hospitals. To ensure that our results were not being driven by single influential datasources, we undertook all analyses using random-effects logistic regression, as well as serialexclusion sensitivity analyses. These analyses showed that, while there was some variation in
the magnitudes and significance of associations, trends tracked as seen for the whole cohort,
indicating that the results were not driven by a specific data-source.

Another issue lies in the anonymous nature of the data entry, such that patients may be
entered more than once in different data-sources. We are unable to account for whether
participants already participated or had their data entered in another study as there is no
identifying information to assess this, nor any query of prior participation in the survey.

Another issue is the comparator used for individual DMTs. We initially planned to compare
to glatiramer acetate given its absence of impact on infection risk; however, infrequency of
outcomes among these patients precluded its being the comparator. Interferon-beta and
teriflunomide were potential comparators but their potential impacts on infection immune
response argued against this. Dimethyl fumarate was identified as a suitable comparator,
being common in the sample and was also that used for the MuSC-19 study9. The untreated

were not regarded as an appropriate primary comparator because these patients differed
markedly from the rest of the cohort in age, disability, and MS-phenotype.

Another issue is the nature of the data aggregation, with some data sources providing
individual patient-level data but others only tabulations of discrete categorical terms. Thus,
we were obliged to use three-level categories of age and two-level EDSS, rather than more
exact values of each. That said, these levels are generally aligned with the levels of each
associated with increased COVID-19 severity.

Another issue is the definition of outcome values. Where these values were missing, we have
left them as such, rather than inferring for instance that patients who were not hospitalised
were also not admitted to ICU or required artificial ventilation. This was a conservative
allocation that increased the proportions missing for such parameters, rather than coding them
to null values, but analyses coding such to null values made little impact on results (data not
shown).

Conclusions
In the largest population yet studied, we have shown that MS patients treated with anti-CD20
DMTs, rituximab and ocrelizumab, are at higher risk of more severe COVID-19 compared to
those treated with dimethyl fumarate, to pooled other DMTs, and to natalizumab. This risk is
additional to the risk associated with demographic and clinical characteristics. These results
agree with smaller cohort studies and suggest that the risk-vs-benefit of continued or new
exposure to CD20-depleting treatment strategies compared to other DMTs needs to be
considered in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
