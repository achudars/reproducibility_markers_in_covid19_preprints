Abstract
Objective: Aim of this study was to analyse the impact of COVID-19 on clinical and laboratory
findings and outcome of neurological patients consecutively admitted to the emergency department
(ED) of a tertiary hub center.
Methods: All adult patients consecutively admitted to the ED for neurological manifestations from
February 20th through April 30th 2020 at Spedali Civili of Brescia entered the study. Demographic,
clinical, and laboratory data were extracted from medical records and compared between patients
with and without COVID-19.
Results: Out of 505 consecutively patients evaluated at ED with neurological symptoms, 147
(29.1%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. These patients displayed at triage higher values of CRP,
AST, ALT, and fibrinogen but not lymphopenia (p<0.05). They were older (73.1 + 12.4 vs 65.1 +
18.9 years, p=0.001) had higher frequency of stroke (34.7% vs 29.3%), encephalitis/meningitis
(9.5% vs 1.9%) and delirium (16.3% vs 5.0%). Compared to patients without COVID, they were
more frequently hospitalized (91.2% vs 69.3%, p<0.0001) and showed higher mortality rates
(29.7% vs 1.8%, p<0.0.001) and discharge disability, independently from age.
Conclusions: COVID-19 impacts on clinical presentation of neurological disorders, with higher
frequency of stroke, encephalitis and delirium, and was strongly associated with increased
hospitalisation, mortality and disability.

Introduction
The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), hit Italy by the end of February and rapidly spread from
Lombardy to the rest of the country, with a number of fatalities beyond 31,000. Although all
regions have reported having patients with COVID-19, the highest number of identified cases was
in the provinces of eastern Lombardy[1]. With the increasing number of confirmed cases and the
accumulating clinical data, it is now well established that, in addition to the predominant respiratory
symptoms, a significant proportion of COVID-19 patients has central and peripheral neurological
symptoms, including olfactory dysfunction[2], headache and confusion[3]. Several case reports and
small series also suggested an association between COVID-19 and cerebrovascular events [4],
immune-mediated peripheral[5] and central nervous system involvement[6-8].
To date, however, no comprehensive large surveys on the impact of COVID19 on neurological
status of patients presenting at the emergency room has been published[4, 6,9]. In fact, still little is
known on which are the most common acute neurological presentations in COVID-19 and whether
they differ compared to patients without COVID-19 in terms of severity and outcomes. This
knowledge is pivotal for the organisation of neurological services and for better use of triage limited
resources during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Indeed, in our experience, the urgent drift to cope with the rapidly overwhelming number of
simultaneously critical patients drew the conversion of the majority of neurological units into nonspecialistic wards for broader and generic COVID-19 patient care. The converted units became
spokes referring neurological patients to tertiary hub centers for specialty care. This led to the
definition in tertiary centers of dedicated medical and nurse teams working in isolated spaces
(Special Neuro-COVID Units) in order to guarantee equal access to acute therapies.
The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on patients with neurological
diseases by recording clinical presentations, laboratory characteristics and management/outcomes

of a series of neurological patients who consecutively presented at the emergency department (ED)
during the peak of the epidemic. The study was carried out in a tertiary referral neurological center,
the first Italian Neuro-COVID unit, identified as a hub for stroke and neurological emergencies in
an area of more than 1,200,000 people that, to date, is hosting the greatest number of admitted
COVID-19 neurologic patients in Italy[1].

Methods
Study design and participants
The observational study included all adult patients evaluated for neurological symptoms at the
Emergency Department (ED) of the Hospital “Azienda Socio Sanitaria Territoriale (ASST) Spedali
Civili”, Brescia, Italy. The study was approved by the local ethics committee of ASST Spedali
Civili di Brescia Hospital (NP 4067, approved 08.05.2020).
Data collection and definitions
The medical form and admission data of included patients ranged from February 20th through April
30th 2020. Epidemiological, demographical, clinical, laboratory and outcome data were extracted
from medical records using standardised anonymised data collection forms. All data were imputed
and checked by five physicians (AP, AB, IL, SM, MG).
SARS-CoV-2 detection in respiratory specimens were performed by real-time RT PCR methods.
Both nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were performed in all patients. If two consecutive
tests obtained at least 24 hours apart resulted negative, and there was high suspicion of COVID-19
(i.e. interstitial pneumonia at chest x-ray, low arterial partial pressure of oxygen), a bronchoalveolar
lavage was performed.
Standardized blood examinations at ED included complete blood count, serum biochemical tests
including C-reactive protein and liver profile.

Continuous and categorical variables are reported as mean with standard deviation and n (%)
respectively. Differences between patients with and without COVID-19 were compared by t-tests,
χ2 test or Fisher’s exact test and multivariate model adjusted for age and sex where appropriate. A
two-sided p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Data analyses were carried out using
SPSS software (version 22.0)
Results
Five hundred and five adult patients with neurologic symptoms were evaluated at the ED starting
from February 20th through April 30 2020. Of these, 147 (29.1%) were found positive for SARSCoV-2. Demographical, clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients are reported in Table 1.

In hospital mortality

Compared to COVID negative patients, COVID+ were significantly older (73.1 + 12.4 vs 65.1 +
18.9 years, p=0.001) and had a different distribution of neurological presentation (p=0.001), with a
higher frequency of altered mental status or delirium (25.9% vs 10.1%) but lower frequency of
seizures and headache/pain (see Table 1 for details). According to final diagnosis, COVID+ had
higher prevalence of ischaemic stroke (n=51, 34.7% vs n=105, 29.3%), delirium (n=24, 16.3% vs
n=18, 5.0%) and meningitis/encephalitis (n=14, 9.5% vs n=7, 1.9%) (Supplementary Table 1,
Figure 1).
Laboratory analysis in COVID+ patients showed increased serological levels of C-reactive protein,
aspartate and alanine aminotransferase and fibrinogen (all p<0.05) but no differences were observed
for whole white blood cell count, lymphocytes, haemoglobin, or platelet count (all p>0.05, see
Table 1).
COVID+ showed a higher rate of hospitalisation following ED triage (91.2% vs 69.3%, p<0.0001)
and in-hospital mortality (29.7% vs 3.1%, p<0.0001). In particular, mortality was higher in ICH
(COVID+ 58.3% vs nonCOVID 33.0%), in ischemic stroke (COVID+ 39,2% vs nonCOVID 2,8%)
and in delirium/altered mental status (COVID+23,4% vs nonCOVID 0%).
According to modified Rankin scale, COVID+ patients had higher levels of disability at discharge
compared to nonCOVID patients (2.6 + 1.6 vs 1.6 + 1.4, p<0.0001) though both groups had similar
baseline values (Table 1).

northern Italy. Findings showed that about a third of neurological patients assessed at the ED
resulted positive for SARS-CoV-2 and that these were characterised by an increased frequency of
cerebrovascular events and encephalitis (Figure 1). The higher frequency of cerebrovascular events
is in line with early observations in China[3,4] and with the known pro-inflammatory state
associated with increased risk of both ischaemic stroke and ICH[9]. In fact, in this series, COVID19 neurological patients showed significantly higher levels of C-reactive protein and fibrinogen,
strongly arguing for endothelial dysfunction or cardioembolic events as possible risk factors for
cerebrovascular accidents, as reported by recent works[10,11].
Diagnosis of encephalitis were also more frequently observed in COVID-19 patients. Given the
close time relationship with SARS-coV-2 infection, a direct or immune-mediated involvement of
COVID-19 of the Central Nervous System (CNS) has been hypothesised in agreement with several
case descriptions[7,11]. The CNS-potential diffusivity of COVID-19 by blood or nasal-pharyngeal
route, as suggested by in vitro-models and described for similar viral agents, is still debated[4]
although clinical observations of frequent and persistent anosmia/dysgeusia in COVID-19 infected
subjects[2] has been claimed as supportive evidence.
In this series, COVID-19 neurological patients had a unfavourable outcome as shown by increased
rates of hospitalisation, high rate of mortality and higher disability at discharge. The mortality rate
observed is far higher compared to general in-hospital mortality reported in COVID-19 both in
China[10,13] and in Western countries[14], and is higher compared to non COVID-19 cases. This
further highlight the severe impact of COVID-19 on neurological patients, being these patients
more fragile, vulnerable and thus particularly prone to early deterioration and death.
This study, evaluating more than five hundred patients admitted at the ED, extended previous
reports[4,6,15] and highlighted the fact that COVID-19 infection specifically affects clinical
presentations and management of neurological patients. This has deep implications for daily
practice and healthcare organization. For neurological patients severe enough to warrant

hospitalization, our experience suggests that the creation of Neuro-COVID units might represent the
most suitable solution able to provide urgent, standardized and tailored neurologic care.
We acknowledge that this study entails some limitations. First, due to the study design we limited
the observation to patients presenting with prominent neurological manifestations thus probably
underestimating neurological symptoms such as headache/pain or confusion in more severe
patients, as suggested in previous reports [2,4,6]. Second, interpretation of findings could be limited
by the single-centre design and by the re-distribution of emergency network in the region,
potentially leading to decrease access to healthcare systems for less severe neurological
manifestations.
In conclusion, this study has shown that one third of neurological patients admitted to emergency
department were SARS-CoV-2 positive and that most of them were affected by cerebrovascular
disorders and altered mental status due to encephalitis or severe delirium. Coronavirus plays a
relevant impact on health status as neurological patients required more frequently hospitalization,
and were at higher risk of mortality and disability at discharge. Further studies are needed to
compare different models of care in order to identify the most efficacious organisation to counteract
the impact of COVID-19 on neurological patients.
