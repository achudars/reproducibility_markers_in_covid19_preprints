Abstract (125 words)

30

We fitted a model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in care homes and the community

31

to regional surveillance data for England. Among control measures implemented, only

32

national lockdown brought the reproduction number below 1 consistently; introduced one

33

week earlier it could have reduced first wave deaths from 36,700 to 15,700 (95%CrI: 8,900–

34

26,800). Improved clinical care reduced the infection fatality ratio from 1.25% (95%CrI:

35

1.18%–1.33%) to 0.77% (95%CrI: 0.71%–0.84%). The infection fatality ratio was higher

36

in the elderly residing in care homes (35.9%, 95%CrI: 29.1%–43.4%) than those residing in

37

the community (10.4%, 95%CrI: 9.1%–11.5%). England is still far from herd immunity, with

38

regional cumulative infection incidence to 1st December 2020 between 4.8% (95%CrI:

39

4.4%–5.1%) and 15.4% (95%CrI: 14.9%–15.9%) of the population.

1 Introduction

42

England is among the countries worst-affected by the global pandemic of COVID-19, caused

43

by the novel Betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2. As of 2nd December 2020, over 51,000 deaths

44

have been reported nationally, or 91 deaths per 100,000 people (1). The impact of the

45

epidemic has varied across the country, with regional epidemics differing in their severity

46

and timing. A key feature in all regions is the burden suffered by older adults living in care

47

homes, where mortality has been high.

48
49

We use a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to reproduce the first two

50

waves of the epidemic across England’s seven NHS regions and assess the impact of

51

interventions implemented by the UK government. We analyse the epidemic from

52

importation of SARS-CoV-2 into each region to the 2nd December 2020: encompassing the

53

first national lockdown from March – May, the interventions implemented as COVID-19

54

deaths increased again in the autumn, eventually leading to the second national lockdown in

55

November.

56
57

We built an age-structured stochastic transmission model of SARS-CoV-2, representing care

58

homes, hospital clinical pathways and the wider community (Materials and Methods). We

59

developed a Bayesian evidence-synthesis approach to estimate model parameters and to

60

reconstruct regional epidemics using data from daily recorded deaths, PCR testing, hospital

61

admissions, hospital bed occupancy, individual patient outcomes, contact surveys, and

62

serological surveys. We evaluated temporal changes in transmission as new control

63

measures were implemented and then relaxed, and population immunity accrued. Inclusion

64

of serological data allowed us to robustly estimate region- and age-specific disease severity,

65

to compare severity in care home residents to elderly individuals in the community, and

66

estimate the total epidemic size, by calculating the proportion of individuals infected over

67

time in each region. Finally, we examined counterfactual epidemic scenarios, varying the

68

date and duration of the first national lockdown and the effectiveness of restricting care

69

home visits, to quantify the resulting impact on mortality.

70
71

Our analysis, which synthesises multiple data sources and parametrically accounts for their

72

biases, provides a comprehensive overview of transmission, hospitalisation, and mortality

73

patterns of SARS-CoV-2 in the first and second waves (up to 2nd December) in all regions of

74

England. Our results provide crucial insights for controlling the epidemic in the future,

75

emphasising the importance of acting fast to save lives.

2 Results

2.1 Epidemic trajectory

79
80

We used our evidence-synthesis approach, to infer the COVID-19 epidemic start date in

81

each NHS England region (Figure 1A), then reconstructed epidemic trajectories for

82

hospitalisations (Figure S7) and deaths in care homes and hospitals (Figure 1B-H). We

83

estimated the basic reproduction number, R0, defined as the expected number of onward

84

infections from an infectious individual in a fully susceptible population to be 2.9 (95% CrI:

85

2.8-3.1) nationally. Figure 1I shows how the effective reproduction number Rteff (the

86

expected number of onward infections from an individual infected at time t) changed in each

87

region over time, in relation to government control measures and accrual of population

88

immunity.

89

The first COVID-19 death in England occurred on 5th March 2020 (2). Seven days later, in

90

response to the growing epidemic, the government began to introduce control measures,

91

initially requiring individuals with a dry persistent cough and/or fever to self-isolate (3). On

92

23rd March this escalated to a full national lockdown (4, 5). Irrespective of initial differences,

93

the level of transmission during lockdown was similar across all regions (Figure 1I),

94

consistent with mobility data showing movement during lockdown reduced to a consistent

95

level nationally (6).

107

rest of the country (Figure 1A), meaning the lockdown occurred at a later stage of its

108

epidemic. London experienced a mortality of 88.5 (95% CrI: 79.9–95.3) per 100,000 during

109

the first wave, compared to the national average of 70.7 (95% CrI: 64.6–77.1), despite

having a younger population and a smaller care home population than other regions (296 vs

111

603 per 100,000 nationally).

112
113

A key feature of the first epidemic wave in England, in common with other European

114

countries, was the high death toll within care homes, which accounted for 22.6% laboratory-

115

confirmed COVID-19 deaths in England as of 1st August 2020. Although community

116

transmission rates fell during lockdown, transmission within care homes continued to rise,

117

with infection risk peaking in care home residents, between 26th March in London and 12th

118

April in North East and Yorkshire (Figure 2A). Deaths in care homes peaked on average 13

119

days later than hospital deaths (Figure 1B-H).

The first lockdown in England continued until 11th May, when people unable to work remotely

131

were permitted to resume their jobs. Over the summer restrictions were successively eased,

132

with non-essential shops, pubs and restaurants opening, followed by the government’s ‘Eat

133

Out to Help Out’ restaurant subsidy scheme in August (7). This led to a steady increase in

134

transmission, with Rteff rising above 1 in all regions by mid-August (Figure 1I).

136

Increasing PCR test positivity marked the beginning of a second epidemic wave (Figure 2B-

137

H, S6). The accompanying introduction of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) began

138

with the “Rule of Six” (limiting social gatherings to 6 persons maximum) on 14th September

139

(8), followed by the localised tiered restrictions on 14th October (9). These measures limited

140

transmission in most regions but were not sufficient to reduce Rteff below 1 (Figure 1I).

141

Consequently, on 31st October, the government announced a second national lockdown,

142

which lasted from 5th November to 1st December (10).

143
144

Restrictions during the second lockdown were less stringent than the first, with schools and

145

some workplaces remaining open. This was reflected in Rteff estimates of 0.83 (95% CrI:

146

0.81–0.85) at the start of the second lockdown, compared to Rteff = 0.54 (95% CrI: 0.50–

147

0.59) at the start of the first. We estimate that without the population immunity accrued

148

during the first wave, contact rates during the second lockdown would have resulted in a

149

reproduction number of Rt = 0.95 (95% CrI: 0.93–0.98). Hence, population immunity helped

150

to reduce transmission further below the critical threshold of Rteff = 1.

151
152

2.2 Severity and hospitalisation

153
154

COVID-19 manifests a broad spectrum of severity, from asymptomatic infection to life-

155

threatening illness requiring intensive care. We estimated age-patterns of clinical

156

progression in people admitted to hospital using individual-level data from 17,702 patients

157

admitted between 18th March and 31st May 2020 (inclusive) in the COVID-19 Hospitalisation

158

in England Surveillance System (CHESS, (11)) (Materials and Methods). We derived

159

estimates of the time spent in each stage of the hospital pathway (including general wards,

160

ICU and post-ICU stepdown care), as well as age-stratified probabilities of progression

161

through that pathway (Figure 3 and Figure S8). We accounted for differing length of stays

162

given different outcomes; there were marked differences in average length of ICU stay for

163

those who died in ICU, those who later died in stepdown care and those who were

164

discharged following stepdown care (Figure 3F). Among patients over 65, we found the

165

probability of admission to ICU decreased with increasing age. Severity of COVID-19

166

increases with age, but for older patients and those with most severe illness, the benefit of

167

ICU admission, ventilation and the corresponding prognosis may not be better than with

168

oxygen therapy in a general ward (12). Thus, older and more severely infected patients may

169

be directed to care on a general ward rather than admitted to ICU.

170
171

We used estimates of clinical progression to parametrise the transmission model, enabling

172

us to infer temporal and regional differences in disease severity, informed by local

173

demography, observed daily hospital admissions, bed occupancy and deaths. We measured

174

severity of disease by the infection fatality ratio (IFR) and the infection hospitalisation ratio

175

(IHR).

The severity of disease increased with age in all regions with the steepest increase above

188

65 years (Figure 4A-C), in line with observations worldwide (5). Regional estimates of age-

189

aggregated disease severity depend on the population age distribution, which is similar in

190

most regions of the country, except London, where the median age is 34.6 years (vs 39.5

191

years nationally). At the start of the first wave, London experienced an IFR (respectively

192

IHR) of 0.91% (95% CrI: 0.82%–1.00%) (resp. 3.02%; 95% CrI: 2.82%–3.19%) compared to

193

the national average of 1.25% (95% CrI: 1.18%–1.33%) (resp. 3.52%; 95% CrI: 3.29%–

3.72%) (Figure 4D-E).

211

We estimated temporal trends in the IFR for England, by weighting regional estimates by

212

incidence and population demographics. At the start of the first wave, the national IFR was

213

1.25% (95% CrI: 1.18%–1.33%) (Figure 4E), consistent with earlier reports from serology

214

data alone (13). The national IFR initially appeared to increase, as transmission widened

215

from London to regions with older populations and greater disease severity. Over the first

216

wave, the proportion of hospital admissions resulting in death decreased, due to

217

improvements in clinical management and alleviation of capacity constraints (14), leading to

218

a national IFR of 0.77% (95% CrI: 0.71%–0.84%) by the end of the first wave. The

219

magnitude of the relative reduction in IFR over time varied between regions, from 36.5%

220

(95% CrI: 26.5%–47.5%) in the North West to 64.6% (95% CrI: 58.6%–68.8%) in London.

221
222

The IFR was greater among care home residents (35.9%, 95% CrI: 29.1%–43.4%) than in

223

the 80+ in the community (10.4%, 95% CrI: 9.1%–11.5%, Figure 4C). Many care home

224

residents did not transfer into hospital, and instead died in the facilities where they lived, so

225

conversely the IHR was lower in care home residents (19.1%, 95% CrI: 11.5%–26.8%) than

226

in those aged 80+ in the community (51.1%, 95% CrI: 47.6%–54.3%). We present national

227

estimates of severity at the end of the second wave, stratified by age and care home

228

residency in Table S9.

230

2.3 Epidemic size

231
232

Data from repeated serological surveys of blood donors aged 15-65 informed our estimation

233

of the total regional epidemic size (Figure 5A-G), accounting for imperfect sensitivity and

234

specificity of serological tests (Materials and Methods) (15). The cumulative proportion of the

235

population ever infected with SARS-CoV-2 ranged from 4.8% (95% CrI: 4.4%–5.1%) in the

236

South West to 15.4% (95% CrI: 14.9%–15.9%) in London (Figure 5H). Predicted

237

seropositivity was initially greater than cumulative incidence, due to imperfect test specificity.

The increase in seropositivity lagged cumulative infections by two weeks, reflecting the time

from infection to seroconversion.

Seropositivity notably declined following the first wave in some regions (Figure 5A-G). This

252

may reflect antibody waning (16), or temporal trends in the composition of the surveyed

253

population. Lockdown restrictions made attending blood donation centres difficult for all

254

except key workers, who were more likely to have been infected (17), and may therefore be

255

overrepresented in the sample of blood donors during the two lockdowns.

256

The proportion of care home residents ever infected with SARS-CoV-2 was 13.7% (95% CrI:

257

10.7%–16.7%), much higher than the 4.2% (95% CrI: 4.0%–4.4%) estimated in >80-year

258

olds living in the community. This difference was consistently observed across all regions

259

(Figure 5H). Regional differences in care home attack rates mirrored the patterns seen in the

260

general community, with regions with larger community epidemics also experiencing larger

261

care home epidemics (Figure 5I,J).

mortality of initiating the first national lockdown one week earlier or later; ending that

266

lockdown two weeks earlier or later; and 50% more or less restricted care home visits

267

throughout the epidemic (Figure 6).

276

The timing of the initial national lockdown was crucial in determining the eventual epidemic

277

size in England. Locking down a week earlier could have reduced the first wave death toll

278

(up to 1st July 2020) from 36,700 to 15,700 (95% CrI: 8,900–26,800) while delaying

279

lockdown by a week would have increased the deaths to 102,600 (95% CrI: 66,400–

280

154,800) (Figure 6A, D). The impact varied by region, with regions with less established

281

epidemics at the time of the first lockdown more sensitive to the timing of the intervention

282

(Figure S10). Locking down a week later may have increased deaths, with large variability

283

by region, from 105% in London to 274% in the Midlands but with very large uncertainty

284

(Figure S9). Initiating a lockdown to interrupt the exponential growth phase of an epidemic

285

has a much greater impact on reducing total mortality than extending an existing lockdown.

286

Due to this asymmetry, relaxing the lockdown measures two weeks earlier (respectively

287

later), could have increased deaths by 9,300 (95% CrI: 700–17,000) (respectively prevented

288

9,800 (95% CrI: 7,400–12,100) deaths) prior to 2nd December (Figure 6B, D).

289
290

We also explored counterfactual scenarios varying the level of visit restriction in care homes

291

and estimated that reducing contact between the general population and care home

292

residents by 50% could have reduced care home deaths by 44% (95% CrI: 17%–64%)

293

(Figure 6C).

3 Discussion

296
297

We present a comprehensive overview of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, hospitalisation,

298

mortality and intervention impact in the first two epidemic waves across all regions of

299

England between March and December 2020. We successfully reproduce the transmission

300

dynamics of the two epidemic waves, in terms of cases, PCR prevalence, seroprevalence,

301

hospitalised cases (general wards and ICU), and deaths in hospitals and in care homes.

302
303

We estimate intense transmission in care homes even during the first national lockdown

304

when Rteff in the community was well below one in all regions (Figure 2) (18–20). Combined

305

with our counterfactual analysis of restricting visits (Figure 6) this suggests that reducing

306

infection levels in care home residents is challenging. This highlights the difficulty of

307

protecting care home residents from COVID-19: due to the necessarily close contact

308

between staff and residents within a care home, once a care home outbreak has begun it is

309

very difficult to reduce transmission, which overrides any impact of reducing the number of

310

introductions (21, 22).

311
312

We find that, consistent with existing literature (23), disease severity increases with age.

313

Assessment of severity is complicated by the broad clinical spectrum of COVID-19 (24–26)

314

hence, recent published estimates are still based on data from early in the pandemic (27).

315

Here we provide updated severity estimates based on multiple contemporary data streams.

316

We estimate considerable regional heterogeneity in severity, broadly consistent in the

317

general population and in care homes for IFR and IHR. London experienced the lowest

318

severity even after adjusting for its younger population. The estimated two-fold reduction

319

over time in IFR (Figure 4) cannot be explained solely by the introduction of dexamethasone

320

which reduces mortality amongst ICU patients (28), but rather a combination of factors

321

including improvements in clinical management, greater experience in treating patients in

322

ICU, and alleviation of capacity constraints (14, 29).

323
324

Our analysis shows large regional variation in burden, especially in the first wave. This is

325

likely due to the pattern of seeding and the timing of lockdown relative to how advanced

326

each region’s epidemic was (Figure 1A). Our counterfactual scenarios of initiating the first

327

national lockdown one week earlier or later highlight the importance of early interventions to

328

reduce overall mortality (Figure 6).

329
330

The extent and duration of infection-induced immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and its relationship to

331

seropositivity remains unclear. Related seasonal coronaviruses induce immunity that wanes

332

in one or two years (30), though antibody titres following SARS-CoV-1 infection appear to

333

decay more slowly (31). Our estimated cumulative incidence over time (Figure 5), strongly

334

supports the hypothesis that the epidemic decline after the first national lockdown was due

335

to NPIs, with immunity playing a minimal role (32). Population-level immunity was insufficient

336

to prevent a second wave of infection in any region (Figure 1), illustrated by the increase in

337

reported cases and deaths which prompted the second national lockdown (33).

338
339

With the authorisation of the first SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in December 2020, we are now

340

entering a new phase in the control of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, our estimates of

341

current population immunity are low, with regional cumulative attack rates ranging from 4.8%

342

to 15.4%, therefore any vaccination campaign will need to achieve high coverage and high

343

levels of protection in vaccinated individuals to allow NPIs to be lifted without a resurgence

344

of transmission. While vaccinating the most vulnerable age and risk groups will considerably

345

reduce the burden of COVID-19, a large proportion of younger age groups may also need to

346

be vaccinated to reach the immunity threshold for control. Our high estimates of

347

transmission in care homes imply that vaccine uptake there will need to be especially high,

348

particularly if vaccine efficacy is lower amongst older age groups.

349
350

We make a number of simplifying assumptions in our analysis. First, due to the

351

compartmental nature of our model, we do not explicitly model individual care homes, rather

352

the regional care home sector as a whole. However, as care home workers may work across

353

multiple facilities leading to within and between care home transmission, we do not expect

354

the simplification to substantially affect our conclusions. Similarly, we do not model individual

355

households or transmission within and between them. When assessing the impact of NPIs

356

on transmission we therefore capture population averages, rather than the contribution of

357

household and non-household contacts. Second, hospital-acquired infections may have

358

contributed to overall transmission, especially around the peak of the epidemic, and to

359

persistence of infection in England over the summer months (34, 35). Our model does not

360

explicitly represent nosocomial transmission; therefore such effects will be encompassed

361

within our regional Rteff estimates. Third, each data stream was subject to competing biases,

362

which we statistically accounted for as far as possible (supplement section 1.1.2). A key

363

strength of our evidence-synthesis approach is that we do not rely on any single data

364

source, combining multiple perspectives to provide a robust overall picture of the epidemic.

365

Finally, we model the epidemics in each NHS region in England independently without

366

accounting for spatial effects across regional boundaries, or spatial heterogeneity within

367

regions. This spatial scale was determined by the data and reflects limited movement

368

between regions due to travel restrictions but does allow for movement within regions.

369
370

Our analysis provides a comprehensive overview of transmission, hospitalisation, and

371

mortality patterns of COVID-19 in the first and second waves of the epidemic in all regions of

372

England, one of the countries worst-affected by the pandemic. Integration of multiple data

373

streams into a single cohesive modelling framework, enables us to disentangle transmission

374

and severity from features of the surveillance system and provide robust estimates of the

375

epidemiological characteristics of the COVID-19 epidemic in England. As nationwide

376

vaccination programmes are rolled out, our results will help to inform how NPIs are applied

377

in the future.

Understanding the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is challenging. The available data are
subject to competing biases, such as dependence on case definition for testing and
reporting, as well as being influenced by capacity and logistical constraints. These factors
are further complicated by the nature of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, whereby a substantial
proportion of infected individuals develop very mild symptoms, or remain asymptomatic, but
are nonetheless able to infect others (1). In this section, we describe the data used in our
analyses, give details on the dynamic transmission model, and present the methods used for
fitting the model to the various data sources, accounting for the inherent biases in those
data.

1.1

58

60
61
62

Here we detail the datasets used to calibrate the model to the regional epidemics. We fitted
our model to time series data spanning 16th March 2020 to 2nd December 2020 (inclusive),
using the data available to us on 14th December 2020, by which point the effect of
remaining reporting lags would be minimal.

63

Data sources

1.1.1

Hospital admissions and bed occupancy

64
65
66

We use healthcare data for each NHS region from the UK Government Dashboard
(supplementary data files: data_rtm.csv, columns: phe_admissions, phe_occupied,
phe_patients) (2).

67
68
69
70

For admissions data, we use the daily number of confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to
hospital, which includes people admitted to hospital who tested positive for COVID-19 in the
14 days prior to admission and inpatients who tested positive in hospital after admission,
with the latter being reported as admitted on the day prior to their diagnosis.

71
72

For ICU bed occupancy, we use the daily number of (confirmed) COVID-19 patients in beds
which are capable of delivering mechanical ventilation.

73
74

For the occupancy in general (i.e. non-ICU) hospital beds, we use the daily number of
confirmed COVID-19 patients in hospital beds with ICU occupancy subtracted.

We use the number of deaths by date of death for people who had a positive COVID-19 test
result and died within 28 days of their first positive test provided Public Health England.
These can be found on (2). We also use the number among these deaths occurring in
hospital (as reported by NHS England) and consider the remainder to have occurred in care
homes. While non-hospital deaths may include deaths in other settings, such as in private
residences, comparison with ONS data suggests that care home deaths from COVID-19
may also have been under-reported. As such we consider non-hospital deaths to be an
appropriate proxy for care home deaths, and do not expect the margin for under or overascertainment to affect our conclusions. These data were provided by PHE and the data we
have been using is provided as a supplementary file (supplementary data file: data_rtm.csv,
columns: death2, death3) to allow reproducibility of our analysis.

We use pillar 2 testing data (see supplementary data files), which covers PCR testing for the
general population (as compared with pillar 1 testing, which mainly occurred in hospitals).
Since such testing was not available to the whole population for much of the spring wave of
the pandemic, we only use this data from June 1st onwards.

We use the daily number of positives and negative tests by specimen date. Each individual
who tested positive was only counted once in the number of positives, on the specimen date
of their first positive test. Multiple negatives were allowed per individual, but the negatives of
all individuals who ever tested positive had been removed. We only consider PCR tests and
thus exclude lateral flow tests, which have been introduced recently in trials of population
mass testing. We also only use pillar 2 data for those aged 25 or over, to avoid bias resulting
from increased testing of university students around the reopening of universities
(supplementary data file: data_rtm.csv, columns: pillar2_negatives_non_lft_over25,
pillar2_positives_over25).

Serology surveys

Serological survey data come from antibody testing by Public Health England of samples
from healthy adult blood donors, supplied by NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT)
(supplementary data file: data_serology.csv).
1.1.5

REACT-1 prevalence survey

We use the daily number of positives and negatives by specimen date from the first 7 rounds
of the REACT-1 (Real-time Assessment of Community Transmission) infection prevalence
survey (supplementary data file: data_rtm.csv, columns: react_positive, react_samples) (3).
Note that results published in REACT preprints use data aggregated using the administrative
regions of England, whereas for the purposes of this study the data has been aggregated
using NHS regions. Additionally, small changes can occur in the aggregated datasets that
were published in real time because of participant withdrawals and additional data cleaning.

The COVID-19 Hospitalisation in England Surveillance System (CHESS) data consists of a
line list of daily individual patient-level data on COVID-19 infection in persons requiring
hospitalisation, including demographic and clinical information on severity and outcomes.
We use the individual dates of progression through hospital wards, from admission to
eventual death or discharge, to produce age-stratified estimates of hospital progression
parameters to be passed to the wider transmission model (see Section 1.9.2 and
(supplementary data file: support_progression.csv, support_severity.csv).

We use data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS (6)) to get the number of individuals
in each of the 17 age-groups, i.e. 16 five-year age bands (0-4, 5-9, …, 75-79) and an 80+
group. We get the number of care-home beds in England from (7) giving us the number of
care-home beds for each NHS regions. We then got an estimate of the total population of
care-home residents in the UK from (8) that we scaled down to the England population size,
combined with the estimate of the total number of beds in England, we derived a value of the
total occupancy of care-homes of 74.2%. We assumed that the occupancy is the same in all
the NHS regions. Care-home residents are subtracted from the 4 oldest age group (5% from
age 65-69, 5% age 70-74, 15% age 75-79 and 75% age 80+ (9)). We then assume a 1:1
ratio of care-home residents to care-home workers and assume that the care-home workers
population is homogeneously distributed among the 25-65 population in the region.

137

The contact matrix between the 17 age-groups is based on the POLYMOD contact survey.

We developed a stochastic compartmental transmission-dynamic model incorporating
hospital care pathways to reconstruct the course of the COVID-19 epidemic in the seven
NHS regions of England (Figure S 2). All analyses were done by regions, and then
aggregated somehow if needed (e.g. for national IFR, or cumulative incidence). In the
following description we do not mention any index denoting the region and thus all notations
refer to the same NHS region.

Model description

1.3.1

Stratification of population into groups

We divided each regional population into 19 strata, denoted by the superscript !, 17 strata
representing age groups within the general population, and two separate risk groups
comprising care home workers (CHW) and care home residents (CHR). The 17 age groups
consisted of 16 five-year age bands (0-4, 5-9, …, 75-79) and an 80+ group. The total size of
the care home worker and resident groups were calculated assuming that 74.2% of available
care home beds are occupied and there is a 1:1 carer to resident ratio (11). The care home
workers were then split equally between all 8 age categories in the range 25 – 64-year-old
and removed from the corresponding age categories in the general population. Despite the
care-home workers being removed from all age categories in the range 25 – 64-year-old,
they care-home workers are assumed to constitute one single group in our model for
simplicity. The care home residents were drawn from the 65+ year old general population,
such that 5% were aged 65-69, 5% aged 70-74, 15% aged 75-79 and 75% aged 80+ (9) and
similarly removed from the corresponding age groups in the general population. Again,
similarly to care-home workers they do constitute a single group in our model. We thus
do not capture specific transmission dynamics within each care home, but rather an average
mixing between residents and workers in the regional care home sector as a whole.

Prior to the importation of COVID-19, all individuals were assumed equally susceptible to
infection ("). Upon infection, individuals pass through a latent period (#) before becoming
infectious. A proportion ($! ) of infectious individuals develop symptoms (%! ) while the rest
remain asymptomatic (%" ). All asymptomatic individuals are assumed to recover naturally.
Those with symptoms may also recover naturally (&), however a proportion ($#$ , age/care
home-dependant as indicated by the i superscript) develop severe disease requiring
hospitalisation. Of these, a proportion ($%$ ! ) die at home without receiving hospital care. In
practice this proportion is set to zero except among care home residents. Of the patients
who are admitted to hospital, a proportion ($∗ (()) have their COVID-19 diagnoses confirmed
prior to admission, while the remainder may be diagnosed during their inpatient stay. All
hospital compartments are divided between suspected (but not yet confirmed) and
$ (())
confirmed diagnoses (indicated by superscript ∗ ). A proportion ($'!(
of new hospital
admissions are triaged (%+,)*+ ) before admission to the intensive care unit (%+,), where a
$
(()) die; those who do not die get out of ICU to a ward (-) where a proportion
fraction ($'!(
!
$ (())
($,!
die, while the remainder recover, following an inpatient care stepdown period.
Inpatients not triaged to the ICU are assigned to general hospital beds (.), where a
proportion ($#$ ! (()) die, while the remainder recover. Recovered individuals are assumed to
be immune to reinfection for at least the duration of the simulation.

189
190
191

In addition, there are two parallel flows which we use for fitting to testing data: (i) for PCR
positivity and (ii) for seropositivity. Upon infection, an individual enters the PCR flow in a prepositivity compartment (/-!."#$ ) before moving into the PCR positivity compartment (/-!."%& )

and then ultimately into the PCR negativity compartment (/-!.'$( ). Meanwhile, individuals
move into the seropositivity flow upon becoming infectious, entering first into a preseropositivity compartment (//+*0"#$ ). A proportion of individuals ($/+*0"%& ) then seroconvert

195

and move into the seropositivity compartment (//+*0"%& ), while the remainder move into the

We calibrated the duration distributions for each hospital compartment, and the age-stratified
probabilities of moving between compartments, using the analysis of individual-level patient
data (presented below in Section 1.9.2). The required Erlang distributional form was
achieved within the constraints of the modelling framework by splitting each model
compartment into 0 sequential sub-compartments (Table S 2).

The contact matrix C$,P between different age groups (!, A) ∈ {[0,5), … , [75,80), [80 +)}Q is
derived from the POLYMOD survey (10) for the United Kingdom using the socialmixr
package (18,30), scaling by the local population demography to yield the required person-toperson daily contact rate matrix.

247
248
249
250
251

We defined parameters representing transmission rates within care homes (between and
among workers and residents), which were assumed to be constant over time. Parameter
?!#, represents the person-to-person transmission rate among care home workers and
between care home workers and residents; ?!#. represents the person-to-person
transmission rate among care home residents. Hence,

Transmission between the general population and care home workers was assumed to be

workers, with, for ! ∈ {[0,5), … , [75,80), [80 +)},
?$,!#, (() = B(()C$,!#,

(7)

255
256

where C$,!#, is the mean of C$,[QZ,T[) , C$,[T[,TZ) , … , C$,[\[,\Z) (i.e. of the age groups that the care

257
258
259

Transmission between the general population and care home residents was assumed to be
similar to that between the general population and the 80+ age group, adjusted by a

These represent contact between visitors from the general community and care home

1.3.4

Age-varying and time-varying infection progression probabilities

264
265
266
267

Various probabilities of clinical progression within the model are assumed to vary across age
groups to account for severity of infection varying with age, and some are assumed to vary
in time in order to model improvements in clinical outcomes, such as those achieved through
the use of dexamethasone (31).

268
269
270

Two probabilities are age-varying but not time-varying, the probability of admission to
hospital for symptomatic cases, and the probability of death for severe symptomatic cases in
care homes. These were modelled as follows:

271
8$%

= 9$% 8&'(
$

(9)

8)% !

= 9)% ! 8&'(
)!

(10)

272
273
274
275

where for probability $_$ , $_`ab is the maximum across all groups and Q_$ is the age scaling
such that Q_$ = 1 for the group corresponding to the maximum, against which all other
groups are scaled.

276
277
278
279

As well as varying with age, four probabilities also vary with time: the probability of
admission to ICU for hospitalised cases, the probability of death in ICU, the probability of
death for hospitalised cases not admitted to ICU, and the probability of death in hospital after
discharge from ICU:

where here for probability $_$ , $_`ab gives the maximum initial value across groups and
ℎ(S, () = 1 before April 1st, ℎ(S, () = S < 1 after June 1st, with a linear reduction in between.

284
285
286
287
288

Care home residents with severe disease leading to death are assumed to remain in
compartment Tc for 5 days on average before dying (modelled with 0I) = 2 and UI) = 0.4),
95% range 0.6-13.9 days broadly consistent with durations in (15) and with duration about
half the length observed in hospital streams (see Figure S 5).

For care home workers, the age scaling Q_!#, is taken as the mean of the age scalings Q_$
for ! ∈ {[25,30), [30,35), … , [60,65)}. For care home residents, we assume that Q_!#. =
[][^)
Q_
, with the exception of the probability of individual with severe disease requiring
hospitalisation dying at home (without receiving hospital care), where we assume Q%!#.
=1
!
$
and Q%! = 0 for all other groups, to effectively allow death outside hospital only for care
home residents.

We calculated the reproduction number over time, &f , and effective reproduction number
+gg
over time, &f , using next generation matrix methods (32). The reproduction numbers are
calculated for the general population, i.e. excluding care home workers and residents. We
define &f as the average number of secondary infections a case infected at time t would
+gg
generate in a large entirely susceptible population, and &f as the average number of
secondary infections generated by a case infected at time t would accounting for the finite
population size and potential immunity in the population.

304
305

To compute the next generation matrix, we calculated the mean duration of infectiousness
Δ' , as
Δ' = (1 − $! )[\τ'* ^ + $! [\τ'+ ^

where parameter and model compartment notations are defined in Table S 2 - Table S 8.
For this calculation, the expected durations of stay in compartments were adjusted to
account for the discrete-time nature of the model, via calculating the expected number of
time-steps (of length _() spent in a given compartment. Note that if in continuous-time a
compartment duration is `~Erlang (0, U), then the corresponding discrete-time mean
duration is:
#[`] =

The next generation matrix was calculated as, for (!, A) ∈ {[0,5), … , [75,80), [80 +)}Q ,

Note that for simplicity the notation we use do refer explicitly to the NHS region of interest.
We calculated age-aggregated estimates for each region by weighting the age-specific
severity estimates by the cumulative incidence in that age group. Aggregate estimates for
England were then calculated by weighting the region-specific estimates by the regional
attack rates.

Compartmental model equations

To clearly illustrate the model dynamics, we describe a deterministic version of the model in
differential equations (22)-(57), followed by the stochastic implementation used in the
analysis. Each compartment is stratified by mixing category ! ∈
{[0,5), … , [75,80), [80 +), +.-, +.&}. Full definitions of compartments and model parameters
are set out in Table S 2 - Table S 8.

We used the tau-leap method (33) to create a stochastic, time-discretised version of the
model described in equations (58-162), taking four update steps per day. The process was
initialised with ten asymptomatic infectious individuals aged 15-19 on the epidemic start date
([ , a parameter we estimate. For each time step, the model iterated through the procedure
described below. In the following, we introduce a small abuse of notation: for transitions
involving multiple onward compartments (e.g transition from compartment # to
compartments %" or %! ), for conciseness, we write
%
%
H?0,*
, ?0,*
I
,
-

347

%
%
~ Multinom HD %,1 (+), Y0,*
, Y0,*
I
,

instead of
%
%
%
H?0,*
, ?0,*
, ?:8&8;4
I
,
-

%
%
%
~ Multinom HD %,1 (+), Y0,*
, Y0,*
, 1 − ∑(∈{*,,*.} Y0,(
I
,
-

348
349

%
where ?:8&8;4
is a dummy variable counting the number of individuals remaining in compartment

350
351

Using this convention, transition variables are drawn from the following distributions, with
probabilities defined below:

To describe the epidemic in each NHS region, we fitted our model to time series data on
hospital admissions, hospital ward occupancy (both in general beds and in ICU beds),
deaths in hospitals, deaths in care homes, population serological surveys and PCR testing
data (section 1.1 and Table S 1).

We allow for overdispersion in the observation process to account for noise in the underlying
data streams, for example due to day-of-week effects on data collection. We adopt Å = 2 for
all NHSE data streams, so that they contribute equal weight to the overall likelihood.

PCR testing

As described in the data section (1.1), we fitted the model to PCR testing data from two
separate sources:

425
426

•

pillar 2: the government testing programme, which recommends that individuals with
COVID-19 symptoms are tested (34),

427
428

•

the REACT-1 study, which aims to quantify the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in a
random sample of the England population on an ongoing basis (35).

429
430
431
432
433

We only use Pillar 2 PCR test results for individuals aged 25 and over (we assume this
includes all care home workers and residents). We assume that individuals who get tested
through Pillar 2 PCR testing are either newly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 cases (who will test
positive):
!#,

é-Q"%& (() ≔ >

$z[QZ,T[)

$
_y,'
+

(178)

434
435
436

or non-SARS-CoV-2 cases who have symptoms consistent with COVID-19 (who will test
negative):
$
é-Q'$( (() ≔ ${! vt∑!#,
$z[QZ,T[) m u − é-Q"%& (()y

(179)

437
438
439

where ${! is the probability of non SARS-CoV-2 cases having symptoms consistent with
COVID-19 leading them to seek a PCR test.

440
441
442
443
444

We compared the observed number of positive PCR tests, {-Q"%& (() with that predicted by
our model, accounting for the number of PCR tests conducted each day under pillar 2,
{-QA$&A ((), by calculating the probability of a positive PCR result (assuming perfect sensitivity
and specificity of the PCR test):

â-Q"%& (() ∶= vé-Q"%& (()y / vé-Q"%& (() + é-Q'$( (()y

(180)

445
446
447
448

People may seek PCR tests for many reasons and thus the pillar 2 data are subject to
competing biases. We therefore allowed for an over-dispersion parameter ä-QA$&A , which we
fitted separately for each region in the modelling framework:
{-Q"%& (() ∼ BetaBinom w{-QA$&A ((), â-Q"%& (+), ä-QA$&A x

(181)

449
450
451
452

We incorporated the REACT-1 PCR testing data into the likelihood analogously to the
serology data, by considering the model-predicted number of PCR-positives é.R"%& (() and
PCR-negatives é.R'$( ((), were all individuals aged over five and not resident in a care home

453

to be tested:

(183)

455
456
457
458
459

We compared the daily number of positive results observed in REACT-1, {.R"%& ((), given the
number of people tested on that day, {.RA$&A ((), to our model predictions, by calculating the
probability of a positive result, assuming perfect sensitivity and specificity of the REACT-1
assay:
â.R"%& (() : = wé.R"%& (() x / vé.R"%& (() + é.R'$( (()y

(184)

460
{.R"%& (() ∼ Binom w{.RA$&A ((), â.R"%& (()x

(185)

461
462
463

The overall likelihood function was then calculated as the product of the likelihoods of the
individual observations.

Bayesian inference and model fitting

466
467
468
469
470
471

A closed-form expression of the likelihood of the observed data given the model and its
parameters was not analytically tractable, so we used particle filtering methods to obtain an
unbiased estimate of the likelihood which can be efficiently sampled from (36). Where
appropriate, we used estimates from the literature to set model parameters at fixed values.
We limited the parameters being inferred to just those with particular epidemiological
interest, or with large uncertainty in existing literature.

472
473
474
475

The model was fitted independently to each NHS region. For each NHS region, we aimed to
infer the values of 26 model parameters:

We used particle Monte Carlo Markov Chain (pMCMC) methods (37), implementing a
particle marginal Metropolis-Hastings algorithm with a bootstrap particle filter (38) with 96
particles (for sufficient variance in likelihood and a convenient multiple of number of
available CPU cores for efficiency), to obtain a sample from the posterior distribution of the
model parameters given the observed data. If the expected values of count distributions are
zero when observed values are non-zero, this results in particles of zero weight, which can
lead to the particle filter estimating the marginal likelihood to be 0. Therefore, to get a small
but non-zero weight for each particle at every observation, within our particle filter likelihood
we add a small amount of noise (exponentially distributed with mean 10S\ ) to count values
from the model.

513
514
515
516
517
518

At each iteration, the sampler proposes an update to the joint distribution of parameters.
These proposals are generated from multivariate Gaussian densities centred on the current
parameter values, and with a covariance structure chosen to facilitate efficient mixing of the
Markov chain. We specified reflecting boundaries for the proposal kernel to ensure that the
proposed parameters are both epidemiologically and mathematically plausible and retain
symmetry in the proposals.

519
520

For each regional fit, eight parallel chains of the pMCMC were run for 11,000 iterations, with
the first 1,000 discarded as burn-in, and a 1/80 thinning. We assessed convergence visually.

Within our particle filter we add small amounts of exponentially-distributed noise (with mean
10S\ ) to model outputs prior to calculating likelihood weights to avoid particles of zero
weight, instead resulting in small but non-zero weights.
We implemented our model and parameter inference in an R package, sircovid (39),
available at https://mrc-ide.github.io/sircovid, which uses two further R packages, dust to run
the model in efficient compiled code and mcstate to implement the pMCMC sampler using
Metropolis-Hastings sampling (40).

Risk of hospital admission

528

In our Bayesian inference framework, we estimate $#`ab , the probability of hospital
admission for symptomatic cases in the group (across all ages and CHW and CHR) with the
largest probability of hospital admission. However, we fix the relative probability of hospital
admission for the other age groups, Q#$ , defined so that $#$ = $#`ab Q#$ , with Q#$ = 1 in the
group with largest probability of hospital admission.

In this section we explain how the values of Q#$ were chosen. We used two sources of
information, an individual-level and an aggregated dataset. On the one hand, the COVID-19
Hospitalisation in England Surveillance System (CHESS) is a daily, confidential line list
containing highly detailed information on patients admitted to hospital with confirmed
COVID-19 (see following section 1.9.2 for further details). On the other hand, the
Government’s Coronavirus Dashboard is an aggregated, publicly available situation report
updated daily. Amongst other data, it provides updates on the number of daily admissions
and hospital occupancy by devolved nation and, for England, by NHS region. We found the
demography of hospitalisation in CHESS to be biased toward older patients compared to
Dashboard data (Figure S3). We thus undertook a two-step approach to infer the
demographic composition of COVID-19 hospitalisations across England.

540
541
542
543
544
545

Firstly, we derived an initial approximation of Q#$ by dividing the total number of hospital
admissions for age group ! in CHESS over the total number of positive PCR tests (Pillar 2)
for !. Both data sources were censored to include patients admitted to hospital or with a
specimen data (i.e. the date the test was taken), respectively, between March 1 and
December 2, 2020. We ran our full inference framework using this initial approximation
for Q#$ and observed its fit to the demographic composition of admissions from the data.

546
547
548
549

As a second step, we refined our initial approximations of Q#$ over a series of iterations of
our inference framework, by drawing the modelled ($#$ }0i+~ ) and observed ($#$ a/qÄ0a*i )
proportion of admissions for each age group (i.e. admissions in age group ! divided by all
admissions) and using it to derive a re-scaling factor for a new proposal for Q#$ as follows:

550
miD Q#$ = %à!(!åî Q#$ ∗

$#$ a/qÄ0a*i
$#$ }0i+~

551
552
553
554
555
556
557

This process was repeated to obtain a close approximation to the observed proportion of
admissions by age and region (Figure S3). A key strength of our approach is that we did not
overfitted demography by individual regions. Rather, by assuming Q#$ to be independent of
geographic region, we allowed our inference framework to derive the number of admissions
for each five-year age band ! solely based on Q#$ , the demographic composition of the NHS
region and inferred epidemic parameters, such as &f .

Severity and hospital progression

We also performed extensive preliminary analysis to inform the age-structure of progression
parameters within hospital. Data from the COVID-19 Hospitalisation in England Surveillance
System (CHESS) were used to fit a simple model of patient clinical progression in hospital.
The model structure was designed to mirror the within-hospital component of the wider
mechanistic transmission model, but without the complexities arising from unknown
admission dates and with greater detail on trends with age (Figure S 4).

CHESS data consists of a line list of daily individual patient-level data on COVID-19 infection
in persons requiring hospitalisation, including demographic and clinical information on
severity and outcomes. Data were filtered to patients admitted between 18th March and 31st
May 2020 (inclusive), with subsequent progression events possible up until 25th Nov 2020.
This gave >5 months for outcomes to complete, and hence justified filtering to patients with
resolved outcomes only. The length of stay in each state was taken as the difference
between the registered dates of entering and leaving each hospital ward. Lengths of stay
were assumed to follow Erlang distributions, as in the wider model, with a distinct mean and
shape parameter for each state. Specifically, the probability of being in state é ∈
{$ñi, . , .. , %+, , %+,,B , %+,,! , -. , - } for à ∈ ℕ[ days was taken as the integral over day
à of the Erlang distribution with mean ?_ and shape ò_ :

For a patient of age å, this was combined with the probability of their path through the
hospital progression model, taken as the product of the individual transition probabilities at
each bifurcation, i.e. values taken from $Ç (å) for á ∈ {%+,, . , %+, , - }. Transition
probabilities were modelled as functions of age using logistic-transformed cubic splines.
Knots were defined at coordinates [Ü $ , ÉÇ$ ], where Ü $ values were fixed at
{0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120} and ÉÇ$ were free parameters to be estimated. The complete
spline, ÉÇ (å) for å ∈ 0: 120, was obtained from these knots using standard expressions for
cubic spline interpolation. Finally, transition probabilities were obtained from the raw ÉÇ (å)
values using the logistic transformation: $Ç (å) = 1⁄(1 + i SlD (a) ).

All parameters of the hospital progression model were given priors (Table S 5) and
estimated within a Bayesian framework. All length of stay parameters were given uniform
priors over a plausible range of values. For transition probabilities, the first spline node ÉÇR
was given a prior that corresponded to a uniform distribution after logistic transformation,
and subsequent spline nodes were given a multivariate normal prior to apply a smoothing
constraint to the spline. Parameters were estimated jointly via MCMC using the custom
package markovid v1.5.0 (41), which uses the random-walk Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to
draw from the joint posterior distribution. MCMC was run for 1000 burn-in iterations and
100,000 sampling iterations replicated over 10 independent chains. Convergence was
assessed via the Gelman-Rubin diagnostic (all parameters had potential scale reduction
factor <1.1) and sampling sufficiency was assessed by visualising posterior distributions and
by effective sample size (ESS) calculations (all parameters had ESS >100,000).

Parameter estimates (posterior medians) were passed to the wider mechanistic transmission
model as fixed values (Figure S 5). For transition probabilities, the full age-spline (Figure 3,
main text) was aggregated to 5-year age groups and normalised by the largest value to
define the relative risk with age. The absolute risk in the mechanistic transmission model
was obtained by multiplying the relative risk by region-specific scaling factors that were fitted
as free parameters in the pMCMC. Hence, the preliminary analysis of CHESS data was
used to inform trends of severity with age, but not the absolute probability of progression
through the hospital states, which was informed by the Government’s Coronavirus
Dashboard data.

`ab

to account for CHESS being biased to more
severe patients. The prior distributions are then calibrated so that the lower bound of the
95% confidence interval is 0.1 lower than the prior mean. For $#`ab and $%!#.

!
prior means of 0.75 and calibrate the prior so that the lower bound of the 95% confidence

improvement in care, S# , and for probability of admission to ICU after improvement in care,
S'!( , we used uninformative ,[0,1] priors.

To keep serology parameters consistent between all regions we used estimates from the
literature to fix the parameters of the seroconversion process. An alternative would have
been to use these estimates as priors within a hierarchical model where some parameters
would be shared between regions, but this would be much more involved computationally.

gamma-accelerated failure time model fitted to their data, from which we estimated the

Time-varying transmission rates

We set priors for the transmission rates BR , … , BRQ to reflect a Gamma distribution for the
reproduction number &f with a reasonable 95% confidence interval a priori. To obtain a prior
for the corresponding Bè , we then scale by a factor of 0.0241 (given other parameter values,
Bè = 0.0241 would correspond approximately to &f = 1). The 95% ranges for &[ we used
are (i) (2.5, 3.5) at the onset of the epidemic (corresponding to BR ); and then &f (ii) (0.4, 3.5)
at announcement of the first lockdown (corresponding to BQ ); and (iii) (0.4, 3) from the
implementation of the first lockdown onwards (corresponding to BT , … , BRQ ). The values are
consistent with the values of the COMIX study (43).
1.9.7

Transmission within care homes

For the transmission between care home workers and residents, ?!#, , and transmission
among care home residents, ?!#. , we used a prior distributions reflecting that these are
person-to-person infectious contact rates and thus should be scaled according to regional
[.R
care home demography. We then used a Gamma distribution with shape 5 and mean {+JB
for both of these parameters (recall that we assume there is a 1-to-1 ratio of care home
workers to residents in each region, so m !#, = m !#. ).

For the parameter governing the reduction in contacts between the general population and
care home residents, P, we used an uninformative ,[0,1] prior.

Parameters relating to Pillar 2 testing

For both the parameters 8Y# and ä-QA$&A , we used uninformative ,[0,1] priors.
