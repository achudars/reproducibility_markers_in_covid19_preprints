ABSTRACT

49

Background: As of May 15, 2020, the United States has reported the greatest number of coronavirus

50

disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases and deaths globally.

51

Objective: To describe risk factors for severe outcomes among adults hospitalized with COVID-19.

52

Design: Cohort study of patients identified through the Coronavirus Disease 2019-Associated

53

Hospitalization Surveillance Network.

54

Setting: 154 acute care hospitals in 74 counties in 13 states.

55

Patients: 2491 patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 during March 1–May 2, 2020.

56

Measurements: Age, sex, race/ethnicity, and underlying medical conditions.

57

Results: Ninety-two percent of patients had ≥1 underlying condition; 32% required intensive care unit

58

(ICU) admission; 19% invasive mechanical ventilation; 15% vasopressors; and 17% died during

59

hospitalization. Independent factors associated with ICU admission included ages 50-64, 65-74, 75-84

60

and ≥85 years versus 18-39 years (adjusted risk ratio (aRR) 1.53, 1.65, 1.84 and 1.43, respectively); male

61

sex (aRR 1.34); obesity (aRR 1.31); immunosuppression (aRR 1.29); and diabetes (aRR 1.13).

62

Independent factors associated with in-hospital mortality included ages 50-64, 65-74, 75-84 and ≥85

63

years versus 18-39 years (aRR 3.11, 5.77, 7.67 and 10.98, respectively); male sex (aRR 1.30);

64

immunosuppression (aRR 1.39); renal disease (aRR 1.33); chronic lung disease (aRR 1.31); cardiovascular

65

disease (aRR 1.28); neurologic disorders (aRR 1.25); and diabetes (aRR 1.19). Race/ethnicity was not

66

associated with either ICU admission or death.

67

Limitation: Data were limited to patients who were discharged or died in-hospital and had complete

68

chart abstractions; patients who were still hospitalized or did not have accessible medical records were

69

excluded.

Introduction
In December 2019, an outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease, termed coronavirus disease-

81

2019 (COVID-19), was reported in China caused by a newly identified coronavirus, severe acute

82

respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Since then, approximately 4.5 million cases of

83

COVID-19 have been reported globally (1). As of May 15, approximately 1.4 million cases, including

84

nearly 86,000 deaths, have been reported in the United States, and case counts continue to rise (1) with

85

evidence of widespread community transmission (2).

86

Previous reports from China, Italy, and New York City have demonstrated that hospitalized

87

patients are generally older and have underlying medical conditions, such as hypertension and diabetes

88

(3-5). These studies have also found that older patients and those with certain underlying medical

89

conditions like diabetes were at higher risk for severe outcomes (3, 6, 7). Among cases reported to the

90

U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from local and state health departments, the

91

prevalence of underlying medical conditions increased as severity of infections increased (8, 9), although

92

findings were limited by missing or incomplete information. Questions remain about the independent

93

association of sex, race/ethnicity and specific underlying conditions with severe outcomes among

94

persons hospitalized with COVID-19, after adjusting for age and other important potential confounders.

95

Comprehensive data on U.S. patients with severe COVID-19 infections are needed to better

96

inform clinicians’ understanding of groups at risk for poor outcomes and to inform current prevention

97

efforts and future interventions. We rapidly implemented population-based surveillance for laboratory-

98

confirmed COVID-19-associated hospitalizations, collecting clinical data from hospitalized patients in 154

99

hospitals in 13 states since March 1, 2020. In this interim analysis restricted to patients who were

100

discharged or died in-hospital and had completed medical chart abstractions, we describe the

101

characteristics of U.S. adults hospitalized with COVID-19 and assess risk factors for intensive care unit

102

(ICU) admission and in-hospital mortality.

METHODS

105

Surveillance Overview

106

The Coronavirus Disease 2019-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) has

107

been previously described (10). Eligible COVID-19-associated hospitalizations occurred among persons

108

who (1) resided in a pre-defined surveillance catchment area; and (2) had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test

109

within 14 days prior to or during hospitalization. Hospitalization was defined as admission to an

110

inpatient ward for any length of time, an observation unit stay for ≥24 hours, or a combined stay in an

111

emergency department and observation unit for ≥24 hours.

112

COVID-NET surveillance occurs in acute care hospitals within 99 counties located in 14 states

113

(California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Iowa, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, New

114

York, Ohio, Oregon, Tennessee, and Utah), covering a catchment population of approximately 32 million

115

persons (~10% of the U.S. population). Although COVID-NET includes all age groups, for this analysis, we

116

excluded children <18 years of age due to small counts (n=101) and one surveillance site (Iowa) for

117

which medical chart abstractions were not conducted on identified cases. We also excluded patients

118

who were still hospitalized at the time of this analysis and all patients for whom medical chart

119

abstractions had not yet been completed. Because the COVID-19 pandemic limited the ability of

120

surveillance officers to access medical records at facilities, patients were more likely to be included in

121

this analysis if they were hospitalized at facilities that provided surveillance officers remote chart access,

122

participated in Health Information Exchanges, or were able to mail or fax records. COVID-NET

123

surveillance was initiated for cases with hospital admission on or after March 1, 2020.

124

Laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-associated hospitalizations were identified using laboratory

125

and reportable condition databases, hospital infection control databases, electronic medical records,

126

and/or review of hospital discharge records. Laboratory tests were ordered at the discretion of the

127

treating healthcare provider.

128

Medical chart reviews for demographic and clinical data were conducted by trained surveillance

129

officers using a standard case report form. Underlying medical conditions were categorized into major

130

groups (Appendix Table 1). Obesity and severe obesity were defined as a calculated body mass index

131

(BMI) ≥30 kg/m2 and BMI ≥40 kg/m2, respectively. Chest radiograph results were obtained from the

132

radiology reports and not from review of the original radiograph. We defined severe outcomes as either

133

ICU admission or in-hospital mortality. We hypothesized that increasing age and underlying medical

134

conditions would be associated with an increased risk of ICU admission and in-hospital mortality.

135
136

Statistical Analysis

137

After the exclusions noted above, we included adults hospitalized within 154 acute care

138

hospitals in 74 counties in 13 states with an admission date during March 1–May 2, 2020 who had either

139

been discharged from the hospital or died during hospitalization and had complete medical chart

140

abstractions. We calculated proportions using the number of patients with data available on each

141

characteristic as the denominator.

142

To construct multivariable models for ICU admission and in-hospital mortality, we first assessed

143

collinearity among underlying medical condition categories and outpatient use of ACE-inhibitors and

144

ARBs. We examined the association of demographic factors, underlying medical conditions, and

145

outpatient use of ACE-inhibitors and ARBs with ICU admission and in-hospital death using chi square

146

tests. Variables considered for inclusion in the final models included current or former smoker,

147

hypertension, obesity, diabetes, chronic lung disease (CLD), cardiovascular disease (CVD) (excluding

148

hypertension), neurologic disorders, renal disease, immunosuppression, gastrointestinal/liver disease,

149

hematologic conditions, rheumatologic/autoimmune conditions, and outpatient use of ACE-inhibitors or

ARBs. All multivariable models included age categorized into the following groups (18–39, 40–49, 50–

151

64, 65–74, 75–84, and ≥85 years), sex, and race/ethnicity. Other variables with p-values <0.10 in

152

bivariate analyses were included in the multivariable analyses. Log-linked Poisson generalized

153

estimating equations regression with an exchangeable correlation matrix (11, 12), clustered by site, was

154

used to generate adjusted risk ratios (aRR), 95% confidence intervals (CI), and two-sided p-values for the

155

risk of ICU admission and in-hospital death. We also constructed separate multivariable models to

156

examine the association between the number of underlying medical conditions and ICU admission or in-

157

hospital death. Two-sided p-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. All analyses were

158

performed using the SAS 9.4 software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).

159

These data were collected as part of routine public health surveillance and determined to be

160

non-research by CDC. Participating sites obtained approval for the COVID-NET surveillance protocol

161

from their respective state and local IRBs, as required.

RESULTS
A total of 16,318 hospitalized COVID-19 patients were reported to COVID-NET with an admission

170

date during March 1–May 2, 2020. After excluding 101 pediatric patients, 74 patients from Iowa where

171

detailed medical chart abstractions are not conducted, and 13,652 patients who were either still

172

hospitalized or did not yet have completed medical chart abstractions, 2,491 (15%) COVID-19-associated

173

hospitalized adults from 13 surveillance sites were included in this analysis (Figure 1). Patients came

174

from 43% (154/357) of the acute care hospitals included in COVID-NET surveillance across the 13

175

surveillance sites (Appendix Table 2). The percentage of facilities contributing data out of the total

176

number of facilities by site ranged from 19% to 100%. The median age of included and excluded

177

patients (62 vs. 63 years, respectively) was similar (Appendix Table 3). The highest proportion of

178

patients included in this analysis were from Minnesota (20%), Tennessee (20%), New York (12%), and

179

Maryland (10%), and Connecticut (9%) (Appendix Table 3).

180

182

Characteristics of hospitalized patients with COVID-19
Among the 2,491 hospitalized adults, median age was 62 years (interquartile range (IQR), 50–

183

75), and almost 75% were ≥50 years (Table 1). Forty-seven percent of patients (n=1178/2490) were

184

non-Hispanic whites, 30% non-Hispanic blacks (n=755/2490), and 12% Hispanics (n=306/2490). Nearly

185

one-third of patients were current or former smokers.

186

Almost all patients (n=2278/2489, 92%) had ≥1 underlying medical condition, with hypertension

187

(n=1428/2488, 57%), obesity (n=1154/2332, 50%), and chronic metabolic disease (n=1024/2486,

188

41%) most frequently documented. Among patients with chronic metabolic disease, 80% (n=819/1024)

189

had diabetes mellitus; hypertension alone was documented in only 4% (n=91/2490) of patients.

190

Seventeen percent (n=316/1892) took ACE-inhibitors, and 14% (n=257/1895) took ARBs prior to

191

hospitalization. The proportion of patients with any documented underlying medical condition

192

increased with age (p<0.05)(Figure 2A). Prevalence of CLD, neurologic conditions, obesity, and renal

193

disease varied between males and females (p<0.05, Figure 2B). CVD, CLD, and neurologic conditions

194

were more prevalent among non-Hispanic whites, while diabetes, hypertension, obesity and renal

195

disease were more common among non-Hispanic blacks (p<0.05, Figure 2C).

196

Cough (75%), fever or chills (74%), and shortness of breath (70%) were commonly

197

documented symptoms at admission (Table 2 and Appendix Table 4). Gastrointestinal symptoms,

198

including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, were documented in almost 30% of patients. Median length

199

of hospitalization was 6 days (IQR, 3–11), and median days from symptom onset to hospital admission

200

was 6 days (IQR, 3–8). Median values of initial vital signs were within normal range, except for elevated

201

blood pressure (Table 2). Thirty-three individuals had a pathogen detected from positive blood cultures

202

(Appendix Table 5). Viral co-detections from respiratory specimens were rare among those who were

203

tested (n=38/1549, 2.5%) (Appendix Table 6). Among 1932 patients with chest radiograph

204

performed, 92% (n=1769) were documented as abnormal with infiltrate or consolidation (n=1574/1932,

205

81%) documented most frequently (Appendix Table 7). Ninety-five percent (n=540/566) of patients with

206

chest computerized tomography (CT) had abnormal findings, and ground glass opacity

207

was documented in 62% (n=350/566) (Appendix Table 7).

208

Forty-five percent (n=1125/2482) of patients received investigational medication regimens for

209

COVID-19 during hospitalization (Table 2). The most common regimens included hydroxychloroquine

210

(n=1065/2479, 43%) and the combination of azithromycin and ≥1 COVID-19 treatment (n=725/2479,

211

29%) (non-mutually exclusive categories). The most frequent discharge diagnoses recorded in hospital

212

discharge summaries were pneumonia (n=1395/2485, 56%), acute respiratory failure (n=999/2487,

213

40%), acute renal failure (n=456/2,485, 18%), and sepsis (n=443/2,479, 18%).

214

Thirty-two percent (n=798/2490) of patients required ICU admission, with a median length of

215

ICU stay of 6 days (range, 1-41; IQR, 2–11) (Table 2). Median days from symptom onset to ICU

216

admission was 7 days (range, 0–25; IQR, 4–10), and median days from hospital admission to ICU

217

admission was 1 day (range, 0–19; IQR, 0–2). Among 2,489 hospitalized patients, the highest respiratory

218

support received was invasive mechanical ventilation in 19% (n=462), bilevel positive airway pressure

219

(BIPAP) or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in 3% (n=82), and high flow nasal cannula (HFNC)

220

in 7% (n=170). Fifty-three percent (n=246/462) of patients that received invasive mechanical ventilation

221

died in-hospital (median age, 71 years; IQR, 62–79); the proportion of patients receiving mechanical

222

ventilation who died increased with age (p<0.0001). Vasopressors were used in 15% (n=373/2486) of

223

patients, while renal replacement therapy was used in 5% (n=115/2487). As age increased, so did

224

the proportion of patients who required ICU admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, and

225

vasopressors (p<0.05, Figure 3A). Males were admitted to the ICU and treated with invasive mechanical

226

ventilation, HFNC, or vasopressors more frequently than females (p<0.05) (Figure 3B). Non-Hispanic

227

whites more frequently received BIPAP, CPAP or HFNC (p<0.05, Figure 3C).

228

Overall, seventeen percent (n=420/2490) of patients died during hospitalization (Table 2). The

229

proportion of patients who died increased with increasing age groups, ranging from 3% among 18–49

230

years to 10% among 50–64 years to 29% among ≥65 years (Figure 3A). Males died more frequently

231

compared to females (p<0.05) (Figure 3B), as did non-Hispanic whites compared to other

232

race/ethnicities (p<0.05, Figure 3C).

233

Among 420 patients who died, median age was 76 years (range, 24–97; IQR, 66–85); 58%

234

(n=244) were male; 71% (n=299) were admitted to the ICU; and 59% (n=246) received invasive

235

mechanical ventilation. The median length of hospitalization among patients who died was 7 days

236

(range, 0–40; IQR, 4–12).

238
239

Risk factors for ICU admission and death
Factors independently associated with ICU admission included age 50–64 years (adjusted risk

240

ratio (aRR) = 1.53; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.28 to 1.83); 65–74 years (aRR = 1.65; CI, 1.34 to 2.03);

241

75–84 years (aRR = 1.84; CI, 1.60 to 2.11); ≥85 years (aRR = 1.43; CI, 1.00 to 2.04); male sex (aRR = 1.34;

242

CI, 1.20 to 1.50); obesity (aRR = 1.31; CI, 1.16 to 1.47); diabetes (aRR = 1.13; CI, 1.03 to 1.24); and

243

DISCUSSION
Using a geographically diverse, multi-site, population-based U.S. surveillance system, we found

255

that among adults hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, almost one-third required ICU

256

admission, 19% received invasive mechanical ventilation, and 17% died during hospitalization. About

257

75% of patients were ≥50 years, and >90% had underlying medical conditions. Older age, being male,

258

and the presence of certain underlying medical conditions were associated with a higher risk of ICU

259

admission and in-hospital mortality. Race/ethnicity was not independently associated with either

260

outcome among hospitalized patients. This information can alert healthcare providers to patients at

261

greatest risk of severe outcomes and help target prevention strategies and future interventions.

262

In a published COVID-NET analysis, we found that when comparing the racial/ethnic distribution

263

of residents of the surveillance catchment areas to the racial/ethnic distribution of COVID-19-associated

264

hospitalizations, non-Hispanic blacks were disproportionately hospitalized with COVID-19 compared to

265

non-Hispanic whites (10). In this analysis, however, we found that once hospitalized, non-Hispanic

266

blacks did not have increased risk of poorer outcomes compared to other race/ethnicities after adjusting

267

for age and underlying conditions. In a preprinted article of U.S. Veterans seeking care at VA Hospitals,

268

Rentsch et al. found no association between black race and ICU admission (13). Similarly, a large study

269

of patients hospitalized in New York City did not find race/ethnicity to be associated with ICU admission

270

or death (4).

271

COVID-19-associated hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and deaths have been shown to occur

272

more frequently with increasing age (6, 9, 14). In our study, age ≥65 years was the strongest

273

independent predictor of ICU admission and in-hospital mortality. Persons aged 75–84 years had the

274

highest the risk of ICU admission compared to 18-49 years old, and those ≥85 years experienced 11

275

times the risk of death. These findings are similar to other studies from China, Europe, and the United

276

States (4, 9, 14-17). Our data provide support that older persons are particularly vulnerable to severe

277

COVID-19 disease and should be targeted for aggressive preventive measures (8).

278

Being male was associated with a higher risk of ICU admission and death after adjusting for age,

279

race/ethnicity and underlying conditions. Other studies have similarly shown male sex to be associated

280

with COVID-19-associated hospitalizations (4, 18), ICU admissions (19), and need for mechanical

281

ventilation (20).

282

Similar to other U.S. studies, we found that nearly all hospitalized patients with COVID-19 had at

283

least one underlying medical condition (4). In contrast, underlying medical conditions were documented

284

in only 25–50% of hospitalized cases from China (3, 21). Our analysis further demonstrated that a higher

285

number of underlying medical conditions increased the risk of ICU admission (1.3 times the risk in

286

persons with ≥3 vs. no underlying condition) and in-hospital mortality (1.8 times the risk in persons with

287

≥3 vs. no underlying condition).

288

In a retrospective case study among 1590 laboratory-confirmed hospitalized COVID-19 cases in

289

575 Chinese hospitals, Guan et al. found that after adjusting for age and smoking status, chronic

290

obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, hypertension and malignancy were risk factors for a composite

291

endpoint of ICU admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, and death (3). Similarly, we found an

292

association between underlying medical conditions and severe outcomes, with diabetes, CLD, CVD,

293

neurologic disease, renal disease and immunosuppression associated with in-hospital death, and

294

diabetes, obesity, and immunosuppression associated with ICU admission. While hypertension was

295

highly prevalent in our patient population, it was not associated with ICU admission or death. Additional

296

studies are needed to determine whether hypertension, which is also highly prevalent in the U.S.

297

population, increases the risk of COVID-19-associated hospitalizations and whether the duration of

298

hypertension and the degree to which it is controlled impact the risk for severe COVID-19 disease.

299

Similarly, the associations between the duration and degree of glycemic control in diabetes and severity

300

of COVID-19 disease require further investigation. Obesity, which was also highly prevalent in this

301

cohort, imparted increased risk for ICU admission, but not death. This finding may, in part, be explained

302

by a trend of decreasing obesity prevalence with increasing age, which was a strong risk factor for

303

mortality. Healthcare providers should be aware of these findings to appropriately triage and manage

304

patients with high-risk conditions that may either increase risk for hospitalization or poorer outcomes

305

once hospitalized (22, 23).

306

We collected data on initial symptoms, vital signs and laboratory values to characterize disease

307

severity at admission. While approximately 70% of patients had shortness of breath at admission, the

308

median oxygen saturation at admission was 94% on room air. Other admission vital signs and laboratory

309

values were also largely within normal ranges. Because we did not collect data on vital signs or

310

laboratory values during the hospital course, we may not have fully captured the onset of clinical

311

deterioration that has been reported during the second week after illness onset (24). We limited our

312

analysis to patients that had either been discharged or died in-hospital and found that 15% of patients

313

received vasopressor support, and 19% received invasive mechanical ventilation. Other U.S. studies

314

have found that up to 32% of hospitalized patients have received vasopressors and 29–33% have

315

received invasive mechanical ventilation (19, 20), though some of these studies included patients who

316

were still hospitalized at the time of analysis. In our study, 53% of patients requiring mechanical

317

ventilation died, which is higher than the 36% reported in a recent study from New York City (4). In

318

general, the proportion of patients with severe outcomes was higher in the United States than reported

319

from China (6). Differences between patients’ outcomes in the United States and China may reflect

320

differences in clinical practices or varying thresholds for hospitalization (18). These proportions of

321

severe outcomes among U.S. patients are also generally higher than those found in U.S. adults

322

hospitalized with seasonal influenza (25, 26). Our findings may help to inform resource planning and

323

allocation in healthcare facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic.

324

There are several limitations to our analysis. First, it is likely that not all COVID-19-associated

325

hospitalizations were captured because of the lack of widespread testing capability during the study

326

period and because identification of COVID-19 patients was largely reliant on clinician-directed testing.

327

Second, clinical practices and availability of specific interventions may differ across hospitals, which

328

might have influenced findings. Third, COVID-NET is an ongoing surveillance system, and only 15% of

329

the 16,318 COVID-19 hospitalized patients were included, representing those who were discharged or

330

died in-hospital during March 1–May 2, 2020 and for whom medical records were available and chart

331

abstractions were completed. These restrictions may have resulted in selection bias. However, there

332

was no difference in the age and sex distribution between cases included and excluded from the

333

analysis. The geographic distribution of cases included versus excluded from this analysis differed,

334

which may have impacted the racial and ethnic distribution of cases included in this analysis as

335

compared to the racial and ethnic distribution of the surveillance catchment population; however, as we

336

do not yet have complete data on race/ethnicity for all identified cases, we were not able to assess this

337

further. Nevertheless, COVID-NET encompasses a large geographic area with multiple hospitals and

338

likely offers a more racially and ethnically diverse patient population compared to other single-center or

339

state-based studies. Lastly, small counts limited our ability to determine risk factors for severe

340

outcomes among all racial and ethnic groups. COVID-NET data will become more robust as additional

341

medical chart reviews are completed and may allow further investigation within these racial and ethnic

342

groups over time.

343

Based on preliminary findings from this multi-site, geographically diverse study, a high

344

proportion of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 received aggressive interventions and had poor

345

outcomes. Increasing age was the strongest predictor of in-hospital mortality. Prevention strategies,

346

such as social distancing and rigorous hand hygiene, are key to minimizing the risk of infection in high-

347

risk patients. These data help to characterize persons at highest risk for severe COVID-19-associated

348

disease in the United States and to define target groups for future prevention and treatment strategies

349

as they become available.
