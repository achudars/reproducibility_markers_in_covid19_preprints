Abstract:
SARS Coronavirus-2 detection in different clinical specimens, including serum and stool,
has raised important insights about its dynamics and pathogenesis, but some details remain to be
understood.
In that respect, disrupt viral control seen in immunocompromising conditions can help
unveil pathogenetic mechanisms and characterize new Coronavirus Disease-19 immunological
and clinical aspects in general.
We herein report a case of cirrhosis decompensation with ascites due to COVID-19 and
unprecedented detection of SARS-CoV-2 in ascitic fluid, hence a possible acute viral peritonitis,
as well as in serum, leading to a fatal disseminated infection.

Introduction
SARS Coronavirus-2 affects primarily upper and lower respiratory tract, but detection in
different clinical specimens has raised important insights about its kinetics and pathogenesis1.
However, virus’ replication in other body sites and pathogenetic details still remain to be
understood2, although endothelial injury with intracellular viruses as well as immune system
dysregulation have been described3,4.
In that respect, disrupt viral control seen in immunocompromising conditions can help
unfold new pathogenetic mechanisms and characterize new Coronavirus Disease-19
immunological and clinical aspects.
We herein report an unprecedented case of cirrhosis decompensation with ascites due to
COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 detection in peritoneal fluid, as well as in serum, leading to a fatal
disseminated infection in a kidney transplant patient.

Case report
A 75-year-old white male with a history of hypertension and a kidney transplantation in
2017 presented in the emergency department on May 18th, 2020, five days following the onset
of dry cough and progressive dyspnea, without fever or other respiratory or gastrointestinal tract
symptoms. He was on immunossupressive therapy with 4 mg tacrolimus and 5 mg prednisone.
Physical examination at admission revealed an axillary temperature of 37.1ºC, blood pressure of

160/90 mmHg, heart rate of 104 per minute, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute and oxygen
saturation of 92% while breathing ambient air. Abdominal examination demonstrated mild
ascites with collateral circulation.
He was diagnosed in 2018 with liver cirrhosis, portal hypertension and thrombosis,
without a conclusive etiology, but denied any prior decompensation. His previous serologies
were negative for HIV, Hepatitis C, Syphilis, Schistosomiasis and he had an spontaneous cure of
Hepatitis B with undetectable viral load.
Initial laboratory findings showed normal white cell count but severe lymphopenia (162
per mm³) as well as other cirrhosis dysfunctions such as thrombocytopenia, increased
international normalized ratio (INR) and hypoalbuminemia. Creatinine was 1.5 times its baseline
value (2.4 mg/dl), procalcitonin was elevated at 3.92 ng/dl and d-dimer was above 20 µg/mL
(maximum test detection). Additional laboratory exams may be seen on table 1.
Chest computed tomography scan showed bilateral ground glass opacities with some
areas of consolidation and specimens from his nasopharyngeal swab were positive for COVID19 on Real Time Reverse-Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR).
As supplementary oxygen (O2) with a nasal cannula was administered at 2 L/min, his
pulse oximetry went up to 97% and he was started on ceftriaxone and clarithromycin.
Tacrolimus was suspended and prednisone dose was increased to 30 mg daily.
On day 2 of hospitalization (day 8 of illness) his breathing pattern worsened, as he
needed an increase in nasal oxygen flow to 6 L/min, and so did his ascites, which then made his
abdomen tense and painful. A diagnostic and therapeutic paracentesis was performed and 2 litres
of light yellow ascitic fluid were subsequently removed. Laboratory analysis showed a total cell
count of 133 per mm³ (macrophages: 60%, mesotelyocytes: 24% and lymphocytes: 16%) and a

serum-ascites albumin gradient value of 2. Direct smears and cultures were negative for bacteria,
fungi, and mycobacteria, but RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 in peritoneal fluid was positive. Serum
and fecal samples were also positive (table 2). A rapid serological test performed on day 10 of
symptoms was positive for IgM and IgG antibodies.
On day 4, he required intubation as his respiratory status worsened further (PaO2/FiO2
ratio: 110). His ventilation parameters improved in the following days but his renal dysfunction
did not and he was started on hemodialysis. The patient died on day 16 due to a refractory septic
shock.

Methods
Nasal and oropharyngeal swabs were collected and stored in 2mL of sterile Ringer's
lactate solution. Ascitic fluid was collected with a sterile syringe following abdominal punction
with aseptic technique. Blood was collected in a serum separator tube and then centrifuged
according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines. Stool was collected
with a sterile container.
Ribonucleic acid (RNA) extraction was performed performed in all four specimens with
QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany), following manufacturer's
instructions. Viral detection was performed with AgPath-ID One-Step RT-PCR Reagents
(ThermoFisher Scientific, Austin, USA), according to manufacturer’s instructions, in a total of
20 µL reaction volume, containing 5,0 µL of purified RNA, primers and probes (400 nM and
200 nM, respectively), aiming at the N1 and N2 targets of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein gene,
and human ribonuclease P gene as endogenous control, in accordance with CDC guidelines.

Samples with cycle threshold (Ct) values below 40 were considered positive.
This case report was approved by Local Ethics Committee.

Results
Specimens from nasopharyngeal swab obtained on day 5 of patient’s illness were positive
for SARS Cov-2 (table 2). Peritoneal fluid from day 7 was also positive (Ct, 34-38), serum
samples collected on day 9 and 10 were positive for both SARS CoV-2 (Ct, 31-32) and IgM/IgG
antibodies, respectively. Stool collected on day 10 was positive as well (Ct, 25-26).

Discussion
A great variety of clinical features have been attributed to COVID-19, including cough
and dyspnea², similar to the ones initially reported by this patient. As disease severity progresses,
pulmonary injury is found to be a common feature² and previous lung autopsy reports have
attributed it to endothelialitis with intracelular viruses³. Moreover, as it appears to incite a high
rate of thrombotic events6, it could also explain further aggravation of a previous portal vein
thrombosis observed with this patient, which would justify the worsening of his ascites.
Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a cell
receptor to invade human cells7 and it is expressed in a wide variety of human tissues, including
absorptive enterocytes from ileum and colon8, which might have contributed to local viral
spread. But more importantly, macrophages also express the ACE2 receptor9 and, despite their
importance in antiviral defense mechanisms in general, more attention has been given to the
hypothesis that, in the case of SARS-CoV-2, they might also enable viral anchoring, replication,

and possibly spread to other organs9. Since macrophages were predominant in this patient’s
ascitic fluid, direct viral injury could also arguably have played a role on initial clinical
presentation: an acute viral peritonitis. Interestingly, reports on cirrhotic patients with COVID-19
show a high rate of decompensation with ascites5, but this is the first report of SARS CoV-2
RNA detection in ascitic fluid.
It is also important to mention that solid-organ transplant patients on immunosuppressive
therapy have impaired T cell immunity, so higher rates of viral replication in general would be
expected10. On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 detection in blood samples from immunocompetent
patients suggests systemic infection is possible in any case11. So, although the combination of a
potentially systemic infection in addition to immunosuppression might have contributed to a
more severe infection in this patient, the possibility of such clinical scenario in general would
imply further investigation in otherwise healthy patients as well, especially due to induced
immune dysregulation with T cell exhaustion4. Notably, this patient presented with seemingly
adequate humoral immune response as he was able to produce IgM and IgG antibodies by day 10
of symptoms onset, which is consonant with previous literature for all groups of patients12,13.
Unfortunately, other complications previously described in COVID-19², including renal
dysfunction and secondary infection, prolonged hospitalization and led to a fatal outcome.

Conclusion
This unprecedented case report suggests SARS-CoV-2 can be a direct cause for cirrhosis
decompensation and also present as acute peritonitis. More studies are required to better
elucidate viral dynamics, immune response and different clinical presentations in distinct
populations, especially because of such diverse disease spectrum as seen with COVID-19.
