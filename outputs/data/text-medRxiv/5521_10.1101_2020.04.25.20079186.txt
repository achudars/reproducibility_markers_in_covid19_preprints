Research in context
Evidence before this study
Given the very rapid spread of the COVID-19 disease in a very short time, limited and few
studies have shown weakness and strength in national and international capacity to deal
with health emergencies. We systematically searched the Scopus, ISI web of science and
PubMed from Jan 2019 to April 2020, using the search terms “health security” OR
"emergency preparedness" AND "COVID-19" OR “SARS-CoV-2/nCoV-2019”. Our search
returned only limited number of published evidences (n=37), of which only one was
assessed the operational readiness among 182 countries based on the International Health
Regulations (IHR) annual report 1.
Added value of this study
Given a very limited and insufficient on the regional, as well as global preparedness
capacities to combat health emergencies, such as COVID-19 disease, we used most recent
GHS index annual report (October 2019), to observe the regional and global level of health
security in the context of detection, prevention, rapid response, health system facilities, and
risk environment against COVID-19 outbreak among 210 countries and territories around the
world. We found information about only 195 countries in the recent used report and imputed
the data for the rest 15 countries and territories that facing COVID-19 outbreak.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our results showed that, with the exception of a very small number of countries that were
ranked as most prepared countries, they were more likely to be affected by the COVID-19
outbreak of the virus and its health consequences, and needed to seriously reconsider their
capabilities and health security in the context of detection, prevention, rapid response, health
system facilities, and risk environment against disease outbreak.

Abstract
Background: Because infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, do not have specific
boundaries, all countries must prioritize and use the necessary capabilities to prevent,
detect, and respond quickly to public health emergencies. In this context, we aimed to review
most recent GHS index annual report to observe the regional and global level of health
security against COVID-19 outbreak, as well as their relationship with case fatality rate,
among 210 countries and territories worldwide. Methods: We reviewed and analyzed
October 2019 GHS index co-leaders joint report, to review health security capacities on the
basis of the GHS index in the context of six categories. we prioritized not only the capacities
of 210 countries and territories around the world using the GHS Index, but also the existence
of functional, tested, proven capabilities for stopping outbreaks at the source. Data were
collected from global databases including Worldometer, WHO, and Disease Control and
Prevention Center (CDC). Findings: This study recruited data on 210 countries and
territories, of which up to 14 April 2020, 72 countries (34.28%) with more than 1000 total
COVID-19 cases were presents. In “most prepared group”, number of total COVID-19
diagnostic tests had a significant positive relation with GHS index (r=0.713; p=0.006). Case
fatality rate was directly associated with the detection index (r=0.304; p=0.023) in “more
prepared group”. In “Lower-middle-income economies” group, case fatality rate positively
related to detection, response and risk environment indices. Implementation: With the
exception of a very small number, countries that were ranked as most prepared countries,
they were more likely to be affected by the COVID-19 outbreak of the virus and its health
consequences, and needed to seriously reconsider their capabilities and health security in
the context of detection, prevention, rapid response, health system facilities, and risk
environment against disease outbreak

Introduction
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced on March 11, 2020 that the
outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has turned to a global epidemic
2

. In the last two weeks, the number of people infected with the virus has tripled and

the number of countries affected has reached 210. To date, more than 1.8 million
cases have been reported in 210 countries, of which about 1,400,000 have died 3.
The symptoms of the virus are 80% similar to the acute respiratory syndrome of
SARS, and the virus transmits through coughing and sneezing 4. The symptoms of
the early stages of COVID-19 infection occurs in the form of high fever, sore throat,
shortness of breath and diarrhea. In the later stages, it causes pneumonia and
kidney failure, and could eventually lead to the patient's death 5. There is currently no
vaccine or effective treatment for the virus, and the only way to prevent is to
diagnose the patient early and quarantine the confirmed as well as suspected cases
6

. Authorities in some countries have asked citizens to refrain from attending

crowded and public places. The virus has also spread to several countries through
travelers, raising concerns around the world and treated the global health security.
Because infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, do not have specific boundaries,
all countries must prioritize and use the necessary capabilities to prevent, detect,
and respond quickly to public health emergencies. Each country must also be
transparent about its capabilities to reassure its neighbors that it can prevent the
spread of an international catastrophe. In turn, global leaders and international
organizations have a collective responsibility to develop and maintain a strong global
ability to counter the threat of infectious diseases. This ability includes ensuring that

financial resources are provided to fill the gap in the readiness for epidemics, which
saves human lives and achieves a safer and more secure world. The Global Health
Security (GHS) index is the first comprehensive indicator and benchmark for
assessing health security and related capabilities in 195 countries; therefore, this
index is a necessary tool to deal with the risks of transnational public health, of which
uses to prevent, protect, control and respond without disrupting international trade. In
this index, biological events with high consequences are defined as the prevalence
of infectious diseases that can overshadow the national or international capacity to
manage them.
The unique feature of the GHS index is that it provides a comprehensive assessment
of countries' health security and considers the broader context of biological hazards
in each country, including a country's geopolitical considerations and health-care
system. However, knowing the dangers is not only not enough, but political will is
needed to protect the people from the consequences of epidemics as well as
pandemics, to save lives and to create a safer and more secure world. Delays in the
global response to the COVID-19 pandemic could lead to a shift in the structure of
the world and call for a transparent assessment of countries' public health capacities.
So far, health-related, policy and security agencies have provided a number of highlevel studies, and have identified ways to identify, fund, and fill key gaps in
preparedness. These recommendations for epidemic threats, such as COVID-19,
could have a geographical scope, intensity, or social impact, as well as overshadow
national or international capacity to manage it. The recommendations have been
provided, but many of them have not yet been implemented due to lack of funding.
Given the importance of the GHS index as a tool to fully assess the health systems
of different countries and their capacities to control the spread of the disease, the

existing capacities and programs of countries and their readiness to understand the
comprehensive effects of epidemics, their specific measures provide credibility and
fill in the gaps in the anti-epidemic system, indicators and questions that form the
framework of this index, as well as analyze the capacity of health security within the
context of a national health systems and other risk factors, could be a global priority.
Therefore, this study aims to calculate and evaluate the GHS index in countries
affected by the COVID-19 outbreak and its public health related consequences, as
well as its relationship with the case fatality and recovery rates using up-to-date data
at the global.
Methods
We reviewed and analyzed October 2019 GHS index co-leaders joint report in
contribution with Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI) and Center for Health Security
(CHS), Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, to review health security
capacities on the basis of the GHS index in the context of six categories, including
prevention (preventing the emergence or release of pathogens), early detection and
reporting (early detection and reporting of epidemics and potential international
concern), rapid response (timely response and reduction of the spread of a
pandemic disease), health system (sufficient and strong health system for the
treatment of patients and protection of health workers), compliance with international
standards and norms (commitments to improve national capacity, funding programs
to bridge the gap, and compliance with global norms), and the risk environment
(general vulnerability of the environment and vulnerability of the country to biological
threats), is reviewed and summarized. Among its 140 questions, we prioritized not
only the capacities of 210 countries and territories around the world using the GHS
Index, but also the existence of functional, tested, proven capabilities for stopping

outbreaks at the source. The overall GHS Index, as well as prevention, detection and
reporting, rapid response, health system, compliance with international standards
and norms, and the risk environment scores among all 195 countries were
considered. The average overall GHS Index, prevention, early detection and
reporting, rapid response, health system, compliance with international standards
and norms, and the risk environment scores among all 195 countries assessed are
40.2, 34.8, 41.9, 38.4, 26.4, 48.5, and 55.0 of a possible score of 100, respectively.
All scores were normalized to a scale of 0 to 100, where 100 considered as the best
health security conditions. Then according to the scores obtained by different
countries, we classified them to highest (most prepared), middle (more prepared),
and lowest (least prepared) countries.
Data source
Data from global databases including Worldometer, WHO 7, Disease Control and
Prevention Center (CDC) (16), and the Weekly Report on Complications of Death
and Death (prepared by the CDC) were collected and retrieved according to the user
guide of data sources for disease registration 8. Due to the rapid increase in data, the
analysis in this study was conducted on April 14, 2020. According to the raw data of
countries, the case fatality and recovery rates and their relationship is a unique
feature of the GHS index, which provides a complete assessment of countries' health
security and a broader context of biological hazards in each country based on the
geopolitical considerations of a country and its health system, as well as whether it
has tested its capacity to control the spread of the disease. Thus, the case fatality
and rate of recovery rates were calculated, then their relationship with GHS index
and its six sub-component of GHS were investigated to provide a complete
assessment in each country and its health system. Then, the country's resilience to

biological threats has been compared for countries with 1000 and above COVID-19
confirmed cases 3.

Statistical analysis
Continuous variables are reported as range and mean ±SD. Categorical data are
expressed as number (percentage). The univariate association between GHS index
(and each of its components) with the number of total COVID-19 diagnostic tests,
CFR and RR was assessed with correlation coefficient tests. Linear regression
models were conducted to examine the association between the explanatory
variables and the outcomes of interest. Ridge regression was applied to assess the
impact of each parameter on total Covid-19 diagnostics tests controlling for the
effects of population and GPD parameters (Model I). Multiple ridge regression
analyses were used to determine parameters most predictive of the number of total
COVID-19 diagnostic tests (Model II). Graphs were made in Excel 2013 and
SPSS22 (IBM Corp. Released 2013. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version
22.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp). Correlation and regression analyses were performed
using the statistical software Stata, Version 12 (StataCorp. 2011. Stata Statistical
Software: Release 12. College Station, TX: StataCorp LP.). P-values less than 0.05
were considered statistically significant.

According to different World Bank countries classifications, countries with more than
1000 total cases were divided in three categories. In “Lower-middle-income
economies” group, case fatality rate positively related to detection, response and risk
environment indices. Recovery rate has negative association with health system
index (r = - 0.637; p = 0.09). Case fatality rate negatively related to response, health
system and GHS indices in “Upper-middle-income economies” group. In “Highincome economies” group case fatality rate and number of total COVID-19
diagnostic tests were positively related to GHS index and its components except for
risk environment index (Table 4).

According to different cut off for GHS index and its components, studied countries
were divided. Bivariate correlation between GHS index and outcomes of interest in
each subgroups is shown in table S6 (Appendix). Table S7 represented association
between each index with outcomes in subgroups according to GHS cut off
(Appendix).
Countries were divided in five categories according to their continent. In Asia, case
fatality rate had a significant negative relation with risk environment index (r=- 0.489;
p=0.021). Recovery rate was positively in relation to risk environment index, in
European countries (r=0.353; p=0.048). Also, case fatality rate was directly
associated with the GHS index (r=0.547; p=0.001) and its component except for risk
environment index. There was a significant association between the GHS index (and
its components except for detection index) with the number of total COVID-19
diagnostic

Discussion
This study aimed to evaluate the GHS index in countries affected by the
COVID-19 outbreak and its public health related consequences, as well as its
relationship with the case fatality and recovery rates, showed a wide variety between
countries in term of prevention, detection and response to COVID-19 disease. In
line with the present study, recently a published report of the International Health
Regulations (IHR) on data from 182 countries preparedness, capacity building and
collaboration between countries are still need improvement, as well as local
readiness for outbreak control needed to strengthen 1. Numerous factors affect the
COVID-19 disease emergence and spread within countries and between
geographical regions, comprising the national capacities, the ability of detection,
prevention and control, climate-related factors, and population’s density

9-11

. One of

the important factors in the context of GHS index is health system, our results
revealed a significant correlation between the number of COVID-19 tests and health
security capacities

12,13

. Other aspects of such important variable is implementing

public health prevention strategies, such as public awareness about hand hygiene
and social distancing 14,15. Our analysis shed the light on the fact that most countries
at the top of the list with the highest number of cases, as well as deaths from
COVID-19, were in more prepared condition according to the GHS index. This may
be point to this issue that health security is essentially weak in the national as well as
global level

16

; thus, no country or region was fully prepared ho handle COVID-19

epidemics and pandemics, and each country and region has its own gaps to fill.
Many countries have been ranked as region with low capacities to detect, prevent
and combat the outbreak, through their experience with former infectious diseases

. This fact may indicate more than ever that a special attention on regions of low

human and health development are needed, as well as further improvements in
observation with additional international collaboration are required 19,20.
The WHO claimed that one of the reasons for the large difference of mortality
rate among various countries, could be the difference in life expectancy, medical
facilities, and the number of tests performed. Though Europe and America has
become the center of the COVID-19 outbreak in the world now, some countries in
these regions such as Belarus is the only country on the European continent whose
officials are not seeking fundamental changes in people's daily lives. These country
has taken a very different approach to the combat COVID-19 than other European
countries and even its closest neighbors such as Russia and Ukraine. While Ukraine
is close to declaring a state of emergency, and Russia has closed public places
universities and schools, as well as canceled public events, and stopped all incoming
and outgoing flights

21

. Interestingly, the highest prepared region according to the

GHS index was Europe with the most frequent level 4 and above results. Although
European countries account for the highest number of COVID-19 confirmed cases
and related deaths, this can be attributed in part to the high number of hospital and
intensive care unit (ICU) beds

22

. Besides, these countries also quickly conducted

reliable screening and diagnostic tests for the COVID-19 disease and implemented
strict social distancing measures to prevent the outbreak

23

. Another possible reason

of the rapid test for COVID-19 could be that in some of these countries, such as
Germany, private laboratories across the country were free to provide testing and
have helped the country test millions of people for the disease.
The most important point is that the condition of health-care system, Hospital

which can slow-down the course of the COVID-19 disease outbreak, is in what
situation; therefore, a sufficient, well-equipped and well-prepared health-care system
in a country is crucial for severe patients infected by COVID-19 disease. Lessons
learned from the previous infectious disease spread and emergencies, such as
SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, H1N1 flu, Zika, and Ebola viruses’ outbreak, have lead
several countries to make substantial improvement in effective detection, prevention,
and the ability to response to similar conditions

24-26

. One of the key component that

lead to increasing the ability of a country to response quickly to the disease outbreak
is early detection by the development of laboratories equipped specifically for
COVID-19 disease. We observed 50% of countries with robust detection capacities,
mostly felled in the European and Asian continents, as well as were from highincome countries. The rapid response capacity rely on the level of preparedness of a
country in term of availability of health system resources and emergency logistics.
The present study findings showed that most of countries need more support by
national as well as global actions to more strengthen health security. Besides, it
seems that many countries, especially low-income countries, not only has not
increased their capacity and readiness, but also underline the importance of the
investment in the ability to combat the disease outbreak 27.
COVID-19 testing provides two functions, including to diagnose people
infected with the virus, and monitoring and surveillance, especially in cases where
the symptoms are mild or not obvious at all. We observed a significant association
between numbers of COVID-19 testes performed and case fatality rate, as well as
GHS index. This means that in most prepared countries to deal with the disease
outbreak, more will be tested in less time and as a result more will be diagnosed

28

.

Thus, less testing or insufficient testing at the proper time may decelerating

resourceful patient care and sending a heavily lagged view of the COVID-19
outbreak to health-care system and its decision makers.
Limitations: Even with clear and precise descriptions for each of GHS index
components and the index itself, finding the relevant data points remains
controversial. Thus, while quicker detection and response to COVID-19 outbreaks
help to diminish the total number of cases, it is still unclear whether process
improvements, which may be reflected in measuring GHS index, will improve health
outcomes in a population.
Conclusion: Measuring the GHS index for each country as well as globally,
may help to create progress in faster detection and response to a disease outbreaks,
as well as improve the health security at national and global levels. But it is
necessary to work with countries and their regional networks to improve the
approach to share accurate and up-to-date local knowledge with the global health
community. In light of necessities to enhance local as well as global capacities,
preparedness and response to the COVID-19 outbreak, future efforts to measure
global health security might be beneficial when using complementary modes of data
collection. This might also be useful in further refining those capacities and
capabilities that are necessary in countries with poor healthcare and public health
infrastructure. Finally, this shows the importance of timely and comprehensive
evaluations and emphasizes that even more must be done to build surge capacity to
prevent, detect, and respond to such emergencies around the world.
