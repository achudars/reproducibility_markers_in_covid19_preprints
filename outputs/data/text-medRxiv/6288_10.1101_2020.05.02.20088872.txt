Abstract
Background: Recently, chloroquine (CQ) and its derivative hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have
emerged as potential antiviral and immunomodulatory options for the treatment of 2019
coronavirus disease (COVID-19). To examine the safety profiles of these medications, we
systematically evaluated the adverse events (AEs) of these medications from published
randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane, the Cochrane Central
Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), EMBASE, and the ClinicalTrials.gov for all the RCTs
comparing CQ or HCQ with placebo or other active agents, published before March 31, 2020. The
random-effects or fixed-effects models were used to pool the risk estimates relative ratio (RR) with
95% confidence interval (CI) for the outcomes.
Results: The literature search yielded 23 and 17 studies for CQ and HCQ, respectively, that
satisfied our inclusion criteria. Of these studies, we performed meta-analysis on the ones that were
placebo-controlled, which included 6 studies for CQ and 14 studies for HCQ. We did not limit our
analysis to published reports involving viral treatment alone; data also included the usage of either
CQ or HCQ for the treatment of other diseases. The trials for the CQ consisted of a total of 2,137
participants (n=1,077 CQ, n=1,060 placebo), while the trials for HCQ involved 1,096 participants
(n=558 HCQ and n=538 placebo). The overall mild or total AEs were statistically higher
comparing CQ or HCQ to placebo. The AEs were further categorized into four groups and analyses
revealed that neurologic, gastrointestinal, dermatologic, and ophthalmic AEs were higher in
participants taking CQ compared to placebo. Although this was not evident in HCQ treated groups,
further analyses suggested that there were more AEs attributed to other organ system that were not
included in the categorized meta-analyses. Additionally, meta-regression analyses revealed that
total AEs was affected by dosage for the CQ group.
Conclusions: Taken together, we found that participants taking either CQ or HCQ have more AEs
than participants taking placebo. Precautionary measures should be taken when using these drugs
to treat COVID-19.

Introduction
The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by the novel, highly infectious, severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Since its discovery in December of
2019 in Wuhan, it has now caused a global pandemic. As of March 25, 2020, there were 414,179
confirmed cases and 18,440 deaths from the disease, which brings the mortality to approximately
4.5%.1 Thus, scientists, pharmaceutical companies, and medical professionals have united their
efforts to develop a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2. Although it is estimated that vaccine development
will take at least 12-18 months,2 two medications—chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine
(HCQ)—have emerged as strong contenders to treat the novel COVID-19. CQ and HCQ are
antimalarial drugs clinically used to treat inflammatory rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid
arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus.3
Emerging evidence has suggested that these drugs are effective in treating SARS-CoV-2
in vitro.4, 5 Viral replication begins when the virus attaches to the host cell and penetrates the cell.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, it uses its surface unit (S1) of the S protein to attach to the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which facilitates viral entry.6 When African green monkey
kidney VeroE6 cells were pretreated for an hour with CQ or HCQ prior to four different
multiplicities of infection by SARS-CoV-2, both drugs prevented viral entry as well as post-entry
stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection.4 Inhibition of viral entry may be due to interference of terminal
glycosylation of the ACE2 receptor.5 Additionally, CQ and HCQ can alkalinize the
phagolysosome, which disrupts the pH-dependent steps of viral fusion and uncoating—processes
that are absolutely essential for viral replication.7
Moreover, both CQ and HCQ have immunomodulatory properties3 that may be beneficial
in extreme, life-threatening COVID-19 cases. Indeed, there has been a recent surge in COVID-19
patients with severe hyper immune activity, known as the cytokine storm syndrome .8 In this patient
population, immunosuppression is likely to be beneficial, since the over-active immune response
is paradoxically causing more harm than benefit to the patients. Therefore, CQ and HCQ have
recently became appealing due to their antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties, which may help
treat COVID-19, especially under dire circumstances.
Although the promising findings suggest that CQ and HCQ are great candidates, much
concern exists regarding their mechanisms, effective dosing regimen, clinical efficacy, and adverse
effects (AEs) with respect to COVID-19. Additionally, precautions must be taken to ensure that
the drugs are effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 viral replication, but do not disrupt the body’s
own immune response in fighting against the infection.9 Indeed, the rise in popularity of these
drugs as potential medications to treat COVID-19 and the current, desperate need for better
therapeutics have fueled rapid and ongoing research and clinical trials10 to further elucidate their
antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties, pharmacodynamics, and safety profiles with respect to
COVID-19. Currently, the safety profiles of these drugs are not entirely known due to the lack of
large clinical trials, as well as sparse randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Moreover, the drugs
have a narrow therapeutic range, which presents another challenge when using these drugs.11, 12
Despite these shortcomings, combining the existing data on these drugs can provide powerful and
valuable insight regarding their safety profiles, which will not only drive future clinical trials, but
also help health professionals make informed decisions.
To this end, our objective for this study is to address the safety profiles of these medications
by performing a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of the current published data.
We thoroughly searched and screened large databases to acquire RCTs for CQ and HCQ. Since

there is a paucity of RCTs for CQ and HCQ for antiviral therapy, we analyzed studies that included
the use of CQ and HCQ for non-antiviral treatments. In total, 23 and 14 studies for CQ and HCQ
were identified, respectively, that satisfied our inclusion criteria, which are described in the tables.
Of these studies, we performed meta-analyses on 6 CQ and 14 HCQ reports, that included a
placebo control. Here, we report the results of the meta-analyses to determine the effects of CQ or
HCQ on AE relative to placebo control.

Methods
The meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.
Literature Search and Inclusion Criteria
A comprehensive search strategy was designed to retrieve relevant clinical data from published
literature. Our objective was to identify all randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that compared the
safety profiles of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine with placebo or other active agents. We
searched PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
(CENTRAL), EMBASE, and the ClinicalTrials.gov for all the RCTs comparing CQ or HCQ with
placebo or other active agents, published before March 31, 2020. We also searched conferenced
proceedings to acquire relevant papers. Medical subject headings (MeSH terms) and keywords
such as “randomized controlled trial,” “adverse effects,” “tolerability,” “toxicity,” and “side
effects” were used. This review was not restricted to studies conducted in the English language; it
includes reports from any countries that compared CQ or HCQ with placebo or other active agents,
since there is a wealth of information in RCTs from many different countries.
Due to the lack of large clinical trials and small numbers of RCTs, we decided to include all the
RCTs reporting adverse events (AEs) in patients with different disease conditions, such as
rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, infectious diseases such as HIV infection, and
immune diseases such as Primary Sjögren’s Syndrome. We included all RCTs in adult patients
that compared CQ or HCQ with other active agents or placebo.
To be included in the analysis, the study had to fulfill the following criteria: (1) randomized trials
which could be open-label, single-blind, double-blind, or parallel group studies; (2) use of CQ or
HCQ as one of the interventions; (3) studies comparing CQ or HCQ with placebo or other active
agents; and (4) studies should report safety and tolerability data for CQ or HCQ.
Studies were excluded from meta-analysis if: (1) they presented data on children only; (2) they
lacked placebo group; (3) study did not present safety and tolerability outcomes; (4) full text could
not be sourced; (5) CQ or HCQ was used in combination with other drugs.
Data Collection and Outcome Measures
Bibliographic details and abstracts of all citations retrieved by the literature search were
downloaded to Endnotes X9. All studies were screened and evaluated by two independent
reviewers (LR, PNT), which were then checked by a third reviewer (SY). Discrepancies were
resolved by discussion in group conferences. Completed data were then thoroughly checked by
two additional reviewers (WX, JLO). Data including first author, year of publication, trial design,

country where studies took place, purpose of treatment, trial duration, dosage regimen, outcomes
and AEs were extracted using a standardized form and presented in table format. Safety evaluation
included monitoring of AEs and vital signs. Withdrawals due to AEs were reported.
Study Quality Assessment and Risk of Bias
Risk of bias in the individual studies included for meta-analysis was assessed using the Cochrane
risk assessment tool.13 The assessment was performed by two independent reviewers (WX, JLO)
and further checked by two additional reviewers (LR, PNT). The completed information is
provided in Supplementary Table 1.
Statistical Analysis
Comparison of safety and tolerability outcomes was made between interventions by pooling data
from studies using a direct meta-analysis technique. All terminology used when analyzing data
was in accordance with the Common Terminology of Clinical Adverse Events handbook.
Outcomes were summarized as relative risk ratios. Fixed-effects or random-effects model14 were
used to pool the risk estimates relative ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for the
outcomes. If I2 ≤50%, studies were considered homogeneous and fixed-effects model of metaanalysis was used. If I2 ≥50%, the heterogeneity is high, so a random-effects model was used.
Although we did not alter this in our software output, but I2<0% may be considered as I2=0%. We
analyzed results from RCTs that had placebo controls. Random-effects meta-regression models
were used to test whether the relative risk was affected by the age, dosage, or trial duration.
Comparisons with no events in either group were excluded. I2 statistics was included in all the
meta-analyses that were performed, which is a percentage of variance attributed to study
heterogeneity. Heterogeneity tests were performed. All analyses were performed using STATA 16
(Stata, College Station, TX, USA).

Results
Process of identifying eligible clinical trials. To gather the eligible trials for this systematic
review and meta-analysis, we searched through large databases (Pubmed, Cochrane, and
ClinicalTrials.gov) and identified those that involved either CQ (n=2,761) or HCQ (n=1,679). Of
the published reports we identified, we initially screened them through the titles and abstracts to
examine if they were relevant to our objective of identifying safety profiles for CQ and HCQ.
Therefore, 134 and 26 reports were initially excluded for CQ and HCQ, respectively. Of the
remaining ones (n=70 for CQ and n=80 for HCQ), we performed a more thorough review using
the inclusion and exclusion criteria described in the methods. In total, 23 CQ and 17 HCQ studies
satisfied our requirements. For our meta-analysis, we extracted data from RCT that had placebocontrolled, rather than studies that compared CQ or HCQ with other drugs. Therefore, a total of 6
studies and 14 studies were used for data extraction for CQ and HCQ, respectively.
Characteristics of trials, patients, and interventions. We collected data for 23 CQ and 17 HCQ
studies. Table 1 describes the characteristics of the trials, patients, and interventions of CQ, while
Table 2 describes the same parameters for HCQ. The trials indicated with asterisks next to the
primary author’s last name were the trials used for our meta-analyses. As manifested from the
tables, we did not restrict our systematic review to just the United States. Additionally,
investigators used CQ as treatment options for breast cancer (1), malaria (13), hepatitis (3), viral

infections (5), and lupus erythematosus (1). To conduct our meta-analysis for CQ, we used 5
double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized studies that used CQ for the treatment of breast
cancer, autoimmune hepatitis, dengue fever, and influenza. Age of participants ranged from 22- to
57 years-old. Dosing regimen ranged from approximately 107 mg/day to 1000 mg/day. Of these
studies, general findings reported in the studies noted that CQ did not have a significant effect
when compared with placebo. However, of the studies that compared CQ with other medications,
the authors noted that CQ was generally more effective.
Similarly, the 17 HCQ studies (Table 2) that we examined were conducted from a plethora
of countries and used HCQ to treat a myriad of disorders, which included dermatologic disorders
(1), rheumatoid arthritis (5), HIV (2), Primary Sjögren’s Syndrome (2), graft-versus host disease
(1), diabetes (2), chronic spontaneous urticaria (1), dementia (1), kidney failure (1), cardiovascular
disease (1), and COVID-19 (1). To conduct our meta-analysis for HCQ, we used RCTs that were
pilot studies (one specifically for COVID-19), 1 single-blinded, and the rest double-blinded. In the
table, these studies have asterisks next to the primary author’s last name. For these particular
reports, age of participants ranged from 33 to 70 years. Dosage schedule ranged from 200 mg/day
to 800 mg/day, with a mode of 400 mg/day. General outcomes from about a third of the studies
revealed that HCQ had no significant effects, while the rest of the studies showed that it was
effective for the disorders.
Mild, severe, total AEs, and withdrawals due to AEs from trials involving CQ and HCQ. The
CQ meta-analyses of mild, serious, total AEs, and withdrawals due to AEs were based on 6
comparisons between CQ and placebo (control), while the HCQ meta-analyses of mild, serious,
total AEs, and withdrawals due to AEs were based on 14 comparisons between HCQ and placebo
(control), as depicted in Figure 2. When assessing mild AE (Figure 2A), the overall relative risk
(RR) of CQ compared with placebo was 2.15 (95% CI 1.37-3.37, p<0.01), while the overall RR
of HCQ compared with placebo was 1.27 (95% CI 1.05- 1.55). The RR for severe AEs (Figure
2B), however, was insignificant for both drug usage when compared with placebo. When assessing
total AEs of either drug compared with placebo (Figure 2C), the combined RR for CQ was 2.25
(95% CI 1.40-3.62, p<0.01), while for HCQ it was 1.28 (95% CI 1.05-1.54, p<0.05). There was
statistical evidence of overall heterogeneity between CQ trials with regards to total AEs (I2 =
55.79%). Withdrawals due to AEs was only significant with CQ compared with placebo. As
evident in Figure 2D, the overall RR was 2.33 (95% CI 1.17-4.64, p<0.05). There was no evidence
of heterogeneity (I2 = 0%). Taken together, these data suggest that both drugs induced higher mild
and total AEs as compared to control. Additionally, CQ had significantly more patients that
withdrew from the studies due to AEs.
System analyses from trials with CQ and HCQ. Based on the reported AEs, we divided our
analyses to examine four groups: neurologic, gastrointestinal (GI), dermatologic, and ophthalmic
AEs. Neurologic AEs reported by participants included headache, dizziness, neuropathy/seizure,
or other central nervous system (CNS) related AEs; GI AEs included vomiting, nausea, abdominal
pain, diarrhea, liver dysfunction, or non-specific GI AEs; dermatologic AEs included rash,
itchiness, dryness; and ophthalmic AEs included blurred vision or pain. With the usage of CQ,
there was a significant increase in all four groups of AEs (Figure 3). The overall RR was 2.75
(95% CI 2.14-3.52, p<0.01) for neurologic AEs; 2.86 (95% CI 2.08-3.95, p<0.01) for GI AEs;
1.92 (95% CI 1.14, 3.26, p<0.05) for dermatologic AEs; and 5.76 (95% CI 2.25-14.74) for
ophthalmic AEs. No heterogeneity between the trials were observed. With the usage of HCQ, there

was no significance increase in the groups that we examined. These data suggest that patients
treated with CQ experienced more neurologic, dermatologic, ophthalmic, and GI AEs relative to
placebo control.
Further analyses on heterogeneity, as well as publication bias, can be seen in
Supplementary Figures 2-5.
Stratification of all AEs. To fully appreciate the wealth of information from the RCTs, we
constructed a flow chart that contains information on the number of participants who experienced
a certain AE, as well as the percentages. Four groups (CNS, GI, skin, and vision) underwent metaanalyses (Figure 3), since they had robust reports in the studies that we examined. In Figure 4,
panel A and B show the charts for CQ and HCQ, respectively. The 6 CQ studies contained a total
of 1,077 participants for CQ-treated group and it contained a total of 1,060 participants for placebotreated. Of these participants, 435 (40.4%) and 270 (25.5%) AE were reported in the CQ and
placebo group, respectively. The highest reported AEs for the CQ group occurred in the CNS, with
about 18.7% of overall CQ participants reporting headache, dizziness, neuropathy, or other CNSrelated AEs. In contrast, placebo group had higher reports for respiratory distress, such as
coughing, sore throat, or running nose.
The 14 HCQ studies contained 558 participants for HCQ-treated group and 538
participants for placebo-treated group. Total AEs reported for HCQ was 140 (25.1%), while total
AEs reported for placebo was 106 (19.7%). Gastrointestinal AEs, such as diarrhea, nausea, liver
damage, abdominal pain, and other non-specific GI AEs seemed to be the most dominant for both
groups. Interestingly, cardiovascular AEs was reported in 2 of the studies that we examined; one
AE involved hypertension, while the other was acute coronary syndrome. Together, these stratified
data provide ample information regarding the percentage of participants who experienced specific
AEs.
Subgroup meta-analysis for CQ and HCQ with respect to age, duration, and dosage. Since
we found a significant increase in total AEs when taking either drugs, we tested whether
differences in age, duration, or dosage had any bearing on the results. We therefore performed
subgroup meta-analysis. First, we examined age (Figure 5A). We divided the CQ trials into two
groups: participants <30 years-old and participants ≥30 years-old. We stratified the HCQ trials
into two groups: participants <50 years-old and participants ≥50 years-old. These ages were chosen
to ensure that there was robust comparison, since the number of RCTs was very limited. We found
that there was no group difference in either case, which suggests that age (younger vs older) had
no bearing on the total AEs experienced in participants.
Next, we assessed whether duration had any relevance to total AEs (Figure 5B). CQ trials
were divided into two groups: <1 week and ≥1 week. HCQ trials were divided into two groups: <6
months and ≥6 months. There was significance difference between the two groups for CQ
(p<0.05). The overall RR of total AEs in trials that lasted <1 week was 4.03 (CI 95% 1.80-9.05),
while the overall RR of total AEs in trials that lasted ≥1 week was 1.51 (CI 95% 1.34-1.71).
Additionally, there was evidence of heterogeneity (I2=60.52%) between the two groups. Although
overall heterogeneity did exist between the groups, it is important to note that when these studies
were separately analyzed, there was statistical significance for either group (p<0.05). Upon close
inspection of HCQ trials, we noted that they generally lasted longer. There was no evidence that a
higher duration is any different than a lower duration in terms of RR of total AEs.

Finally, to determine if there were significant differences between a low versus a high
dosage with respect to total AEs for either drug, we stratified the dosages into two groups: <500
mg/day and ≥500 mg/day. This arbitrary grouping ensured that we included enough studies in each
group for CQ, since the number of RCT for CQ is limited. Additionally, most of the HCQ studies
used 400 mg/day as the dosage (8 HCQ studies), so many reports fell below the <500 mg/day
threshold that we set. As evident in our meta-analyses, there was no significant difference in the
subgroups when using either dosage for both drugs.
Taken together, there was no statistical evidence to suggest that (younger vs older) age and
(lower vs higher) dosage differentially affected the total AEs when using either drug. Additionally,
there was statistical evidence to suggest that separation according to duration had an impact on
total AEs in the CQ studies.
Meta-regression analyses for CQ and HCQ. Meta-regression analyses were performed to
determine the relationship between RR and age, duration of trial, and dosage, as depicted in Figure
5. We examined if age of participants, duration of trial, or dosage has any effects on total AEs or
withdrawals due to AEs. The size of the symbols indicates more weight towards a particular study.
In all plots, the predicted regression lines and 95% confidence-interval lines are displayed.
Regression of logarithm of RR of total AE with CQ and dosage revealed that dosage had an effect
on total AEs. Age and duration of trial did not affect the total AEs for CQ. For HCQ, there was no
evidence that age, duration of trial, or dosage affected total AEs. Further meta-regression analyses
can be found in Supplementary Figure 1.

Discussion
The current pandemic with SARS-CoV-2 has relentlessly claimed thousands of lives and
caused significant economic hardship. The current need for viable therapeutic options while
vaccine development is in progress has resulted in the proposal of numerous antiviral
medications.15 Chloroquine (CQ) and its derivative hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have been
circulating in the media as potential drugs to treat COVID-19. However, little is known regarding
their safety profiles due to the lack of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). To address this urgent
issue, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis by pooling the existing published data
of adverse events (AEs) for CQ and HCQ relative to placebo.
After comprehensively perusing through the literature, we identified 23 CQ and 17 HCQ
eligible studies that satisfied our inclusion criteria (Figure 1). The characteristics of these studies
are documented in Tables 1 and 2. For our meta-analyses, we included 6 CQ and 14 HCQ, since
these studies were placebo-controlled. We found that the usage of either drug increased the relative
risk (RR) for mild and total AEs (Figure 2). Further system analyses showed that overall
participants in the CQ trials experienced more neurologic, gastrointestinal, dermatologic, and
ophthalmic AEs (Figure 3). We did not observe a significant increase in the HCQ group compared
to placebo with regards to these AE categories. Therefore, the significant increase in mild and total
AEs from HCQ was most likely attributed to other reported AEs, such as respiratory and
cardiovascular AEs.
Given the severity of cardiovascular AEs, it is critical to note that two studies reported two
cardiovascular AEs: one was hypertension and the other was acute coronary syndrome.16, 17
Although there were no cardiovascular AEs reported in the CQ studies that we analyzed, its
cardiotoxicity has also been noted in a plethora of studies.18 An excellent systematic review article

by Chatre et al. documented the cardiac complications that are attributed to CQ and HCQ.18 In
their review, they found that among other cardiovascular complications, conduction bundle or
atrioventricular block were reported more frequently. Moreover, QT interval prolongation has
been noted in numerous studies.19-22 Severely prolonged QT interval can lead to lethal arrhythmias
and sudden cardiac death. Therefore, the prevalence of these cardiovascular AEs warrants periodic
electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring when participants are undergoing these therapies, as
cardiovascular AEs can be fatal. Since many of the studies that involved participants who
experienced cardiovascular complications were not RCTs with placebo controls, we were unable
to include them in our meta-analyses.
Overall, participants who took CQ exhibited more AEs (40.4%) relative to placebo control
(25.5%, Figure 4). In the HCQ studies, only 25.1% of total AEs were reported versus 19.7% for
placebo. The high percentage of total AEs occurring with CQ participants is concerning, but
consistent with the consensus that HCQ is a safer alternative to CQ.4, 23-25 When total AEs were
stratified according to different organ systems, we found that CQ had more participants exhibiting
CNS AEs (18.7%), while HCQ participants had more participants experiencing GI AEs (12.7%).
It is worth noting that only 6.6% of HCQ participants exhibited CNS AEs. The extra hydroxyl
group in HCQ may decrease the occurrence of CNS AEs. More mechanistic, controlled studies
need to be performed to confirm this finding.
Furthermore, subgroup analyses (Figure 5) revealed no evidence in differences of RR of
total AEs when studies were divided by age (younger vs older) and dosage (lower vs higher).
However, when we performed meta-regression analyses (Figure 6), there was a relationship
between dosage and total AEs in the CQ group, which suggests that the subgroup meta-analyses
for dosage would be more robust if more CQ RCTs existed.
Interestingly, we found that duration of drug had an impact on total AEs when using CQ,
with lower duration (<1 week) having higher RR. When examining studies with duration <1
week,26-28 we noticed that CQ was used to treat Dengue (2) and Chikungunya (1) infections. CQ
was used to treat various other conditions in trials with higher duration (≥1 week). Upon closer
inspection of the HCQ duration subgroup analysis, we observed that studies with duration <6
months had an insignificant overall RR of total AEs, while studies with duration ≥6 months had a
very significant overall RR of total AEs (p<0.01). However, when these two groups were
compared (p=0.18), there was no significant difference between them. Indeed, given the long halflife of HCQ,29 it is plausible that the longer the duration of dosing regimen, the more total AEs
may be observed. However, due to the small number of RCTs for HCQ, it is not possible to
determine the duration when HCQ would produce more AEs.
Conclusions
Taken together, our data show that participants taking either CQ or HCQ experienced more
mild and total AEs relative to placebo control. Precautionary measures should be taken when
giving these medications for their therapeutic impact.

Figure Captions
Figure 1. Process of identifying eligible clinical trials for CQ and HCQ. Reports were
identified through Pubmed, Cochrane, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We used the same process of study
collection for both CQ and HCQ. We performed an initial screening, followed by a more stringent
screening using our selection criteria. The studies that remained after all the exclusion were the
ones used for data extraction. In total, we identified 23 and 17 studies for CQ and HCQ,
respectively, which are described in Tables 1 and 2. Of those studies, 6 CQ and 14 HCQ reports
are placebo-controlled RCTs, so we used these studies for our data analysis.
Figure 2. Mild, severe, total AEs, and withdrawals due to AE from trials involving CQ and
HCQ. We performed 6 comparisons between CQ and placebo and 14 comparisons between HCQ,
as evident in the forest plots. AEs were divided into A) mild, B) severe, and C) total. D)
Additionally, we also examined withdrawals from trials due to AEs. Meta-analyses were
performed. We tested heterogeneity between trials, as well as overall effect. Statistical data are
displayed in the forest plots.
Figure 3. System analyses from trials with CQ and HCQ. We performed 6 comparisons
between CQ and placebo and 14 comparisons between HCQ, as evident in the forest plots. AEs
were divided into 4 groups: A) neurologic, B) gastrointestinal (GI), C) dermatologic, D) and
ophthalmic AEs. Using meta-analyses, we tested heterogeneity between trials, as well as overall
effect. Statistical data are displayed in the forest plots.
Figure 4. Stratification of all AE. To fully appreciate the wealth of data regarding CQ and HCQ
AE, we divided the AE into different categories. Panel A) depicts the data for CQ, while panel B)
shows the data for HCQ. Both panels begin with the total number of participants in the studies
(n=6 CQ, n=14 HCQ), which is then followed by the total number of AE. The AE were then
divided into different systems, which is then broken down into specific AE. Figure was generated
using BioRender.
Figure 5. Subgroup meta-analyses for CQ and HCQ with respect to age, duration, and
dosage. We stratified the dosages used in the studies for both CQ and HCQ into two subgroups.
We then performed subgroup analysis for dosage and trial duration. A) For age, we separated CQ
trials into <30 years-old and ≥30 years-old, while we separated HCQ trials into <50 years-old and
≥50 years-old. B) For drug duration, we divided CQ studies into <1 week and ≥1 week, while we
divided HCQ studies into <6 months and ≥6 months. C) And for dosage, we wanted to investigate
if there was a difference in using <500 mg/day versus using ≥500 mg/day for either drug. Statistical
data are presented in the figures.

Figure 6. Meta-regression analyses for CQ and HCQ. Meta-regression analyses were
performed using the log RR of total AEs with respect to age, duration, and dosage for both CQ
and HCQ, as shown in panel A). Panel B depicts the meta-regression analyses of RR of
withdrawals due to AEs with respect to age, duration, and dosage for both CQ and HCQ. Statistical
data are presented in the figure.
