Abstract: An electronic survey was conducted in October, 2020 among individuals primarily age
60 and older regarding their degree of confidence of deriving personal protection from 8
different anti‐COVID interventions – social isolation, lockdowns, avoiding restaurants, taking
MMR vaccine, wearing masks when indoors with others, avoiding hotels, avoiding commercial
air travel, and using the first future specific anti‐COVID vaccine. Responses were received from
135 persons from many different U.S. regions and 5 foreign countries. Respondents were
generally individuals with very high levels of education and personal achievement. Results
demonstrated wide diversity of responses regarding each of these interventions. None were
strongly supported by a majority of respondents, but those receiving the largest proportions of
strong support were social isolation (41%), wearing masks indoors (41%), and using the first
anti‐COVID vaccine (41%). MMR (measles‐mumps‐rubella) vaccination was viewed much more

positively than negatively but had the highest proportion of individuals who felt they had
insufficient data to formulate an opinion. The largest number of strong negative assessments
were toward lockdowns (37%). We speculate that the wide variation in perception of possible
benefits from the surveyed interventions, most of which have been widely practiced by or
imposed upon millions of individuals, in this highly accomplished older population at increased
personal risk from COVID‐19 reflects the current absence of rigorous scientific proof of the
efficacy of any these interventions, and the continuation of the epidemic despite the
widespread utilization of most of them.

Introduction: The current COVID‐19 epidemic due to SARS‐CoV‐2 is estimated to have caused
over 1 million deaths worldwide1 and over 200,000 of these have been in the United States1.
After approximately 8 months the epidemic continues to cause about 700 new deaths per day
in the U.S.1 Public health authorities have made various recommendations on methods to
reduce illness and death, and many states have imposed very strong restraints on people and
businesses as part of this effort. We report here the results of a survey to assess the perceived
likelihood of personal benefit from 6 commonly utilized interventions, the less widely
recognized use of MMR vaccination, and a future initial specific anti‐COVID vaccine.

Methods: Approximately 400 persons were emailed a request to participate in the survey, and
135 people provided their responses in the week prior to October 15, 2020. The email
distribution was intended to reach people who were almost all highly educated, high achievers,
and primarily age 60 and above. The supplement indicates the wide variety of professional
accomplishments of the survey responders. Individuals were asked to “indicate your degree of
confidence that a particular anti‐COVID intervention is likely to be useful for you personally in
protecting yourself from illness or death due to COVID‐19”. The degree of confidence level
choices were the following: Less than 20%, 20‐40%, 40‐60%, 60 – 80%, greater than 80%, and
unable to make an assessment. Respondents were also asked to state their age. The survey
was accompanied by information on MMR vaccination2,3,4 and the proposed controlled clinical
trial for MMR in 30,000 health care workers5. No information about other interventions was
provided and all potential respondents were explicitly told that there was no “right” answer to
any question except their age. All data was entered into and analyzed using Excel spreadsheets
and the numerical results used to create graphs showing the distribution of answers regarding
each intervention.

Results and discussion: The results are shown in graphs 1‐9. They show a remarkably varied
degree of confidence of benefit for every intervention. Strikingly none of the interventions
which have been widely utilized and in some cases forced upon their populations by state and
city governments achieved even a majority of responses indicating a perceived high probability

(80% or more) of personal benefit. This rating was given to social isolation by 41%, to
lockdowns by 27%, to restaurant avoidance by 27%, to wearing masks indoors by 41%, to
avoiding hotels by 26%, and to avoiding commercial air travel by 31%. Of the preceding 5
interventions the lowest perceived personal benefit rating went to lockdowns which 37% of
respondents viewed as minimally beneficial to them if at all.
The results regarding MMR vaccination and use of a first future anti‐COVID vaccine cannot be
directly compared to the preceding 6 interventions which have been advocated to the public
and in some cases been forced upon them for many months. MMR information was new to
most of the survey recipients and was not comprehensive although it provided references to
the most important work on this subject and described the proposed clinical trial. Not
surprisingly a fairly high proportion of respondents (16%) felt unable to make an assessment of
probability of personal benefit, a greater percentage than for any other intervention. The likely
benefit of a future anti‐COVID vaccine received the second largest number of answers of unable
to make an assessment (9%). Nevertheless as shown in graphs 4 and 8 a far higher proportion
of respondents were favorably inclined to currently using MMR vaccination or to future use of
an anti‐COVID vaccine than considered them highly unlikely to be of personal benefit.
Above are some highlights derived from the data, and the graphs are presented in full to permit
others to draw their own conclusions. We will also provide full copies of the raw data linked to
each numbered individual upon request to the corresponding author.
In conclusion we offer possible explanations for the results of this survey. In our opinion the
remarkably wide dispersion of opinions on all surveyed interventions among a group of
intelligent people whose age distribution (see graph 9) places them at much greater than
average risk of illness and death from COVID‐19 is substantially due to two major factors: (1)
the lack of solid scientific proof of efficacy for any of them and (2) the experience of the last 8
months indicating that these interventions have failed to arrest the epidemic due to SARS‐CoV‐
2. We believe very few members of the surveyed population would have ignored convincing
proof of efficacy for any intervention if such proof existed. The implications of enforcing non‐
voluntary restrictions on millions of people absent such proof are beyond the scope of this
inquiry.
