ABSTRACT:
Protective variables for COVID-19 are unknown. ‘Trained immunity’ of the populace as a result of
BCG immunization policy implementation and coverage had been suggested to be one of the
factors responsible for the differential impact of COVID-19 on different countries. Several trials are
underway to evaluate the potential protective role of BCG vaccination in COVID-19. However, the
lack of clarity on the use of appropriate controls concerning the measures of ‘trained immunity’ or
the heterologous cell-mediated immunity conferred by BCG vaccination has been a cause of
concern leading to more confusion as exemplified by a recently concluded trial in Israel that failed to
find any protective correlation with regard to BCG vaccination. Whereas, when we analyze the
COVID-19 data of European countries without any regard for BCG vaccination policy but with similar
age distribution, comparable confounding variables, and the stage of the pandemic, the prevalence
of tuberculin immunoreactivity - a measure of cell-mediated immunity persistence as a result of
Mycobacterium spp. (including BCG vaccine) exposure of the populations, is found consistently
negatively correlated with COVID-19 infections and mortality per million population, at all the time
points evaluated. We propose that on-going and future studies evaluating the effect of BCG
vaccination on COVID-19 outcomes may actively consider, if not already, the inclusion of controls
for underlying ‘trained immunity’ and heterologous cell-mediated immunity prevalence that may be
pre-existing or resulting from the intervention (e.g., BCG vaccine) in such trials to arrive at more
dependable conclusions concerning their potential benefit.

INTRODUCTION:

Bacille Calmette–Guérin or BCG vaccination policy implementation by countries and its coverage
had been proposed to lower the COVID-19 cases and mortality [REFs in 1-4]. The BCG vaccination
given to children and adults has been known to protect them from many unrelated pathogens and
diseases [REFs in 1,3, 5-10 ] supposedly through the generation of ‘trained immunity’ and
heterologous cell-mediated immunity (e.g., Th1 and Th17) that last for a variable period [1,5,9-12].
However, the confounding variables among the countries for COVID-19 such as the stage of the
outbreak, population age distribution, health infrastructure, management practices, the
testing/screening, and reporting guidelines, etc. make the comparisons and conclusions drawn
about the protective role of BCG vaccination tenuous [REFs in 2-4]. Notwithstanding, multiple trials
are planned and ongoing to assess the potential protective effect of BCG vaccination on COVID-19
incidence and severity [REFs in 1,13]. In a recently concluded study reported in JAMA by Hamiel
and colleagues, the individuals vaccinated at birth (born between 1979-1981) were found to be
indistinguishable from those not vaccinated at birth (born between 1983-1985) with regard to
COVID-19 incidence and severity, negating any protective effect drawn in adulthood from BCG
vaccination at birth [14]. It would have been expected from the known complete waning of the
neonatal period BCG vaccination imparted cell-mediated immunity within the first few years (<5)
after birth, reaching a frequency observed for the reference population due to environmental
mycobacteria exposure [REFs in 15,16]. For individuals vaccinated at later stages, the loss is slower
and dependent upon other variables as well but estimated to reach background reference
population levels with an 8% annual decrease [16]. However, two refined epidemiological analyses
that have come up during the review of current commentary [3,4] have again failed in their analysis
to confirm the null hypothesis that BCG vaccination is not associated with COVID-19 mortality even
after making attempts to minimize the effect of the confounding variables that may have plagued
previously observed negative correlation between BCG vaccination policy and COVID-19
incidences and outcomes by adjusting for different parameters, rather these studies suggest that
BCG vaccination policy seem to have a protective role as suggested by previous relatively crude
analysis [REFs in 2-4 ]. However, caution needs to be exercised in looking too much into the
analysis as it is from an earlier phase of the epidemic when nations clubbed together for the
analysis have not reached a similar stage of the epidemic and the possibility of the presence of
other potential confounders (see discussion later).
Here we may be reminded of that in the current scenario our primary question is ‘not’ whether BCG
vaccination once performed maybe somehow correlated or covarying (not necessarily biologically
relevant) with lower incidence and mortality observed in populations and if it can be transformed in a
way to model the available data rather the question is a simpler one ‘whether BCG vaccination or
any other intervention can potentially reduce/prevent the COVID-19 incidence and mortality in
populations’.
Since the delayed cell-mediated immune response, historically measured as immunoreactivity to
tuberculin (Tuberculin Sensitivity Test or TST) and presumably, the concomitant ‘trained immunity’
conferred by BCG vaccination at childbirth wanes rapidly within first few years of childhood in the
absence of ‘booster’ Mycobacterium spp. exposures [REFs in 12,15,16], the prevalent actual
‘trained immunity’ and heterologous cell-mediated immunity correlate of any population could be a
better evaluable predictive parameter of populations’ response to COVID-19 infections [5,12], if any,
rather than relying on BCG vaccination at childbirth/childhood, the national universal vaccination
policy, its coverage, or its implementation year as being proposed as well as explored [14,3,4]. The

tuberculin immunoreactivity persistence is known to be associated with lower mortality from
unrelated diseases both in infants as well as the elderly for a long time [REFs in 1-5,9-12,15].
Tuberculin Sensitivity Test (TST) and Interferon Gamma Release Assays (IGRAs) are used to
indirectly assess the presence of memory T-cell response or cell-mediated immune response
against previous Mycobacterium spp. antigens (environmental or BCG vaccine) exposure
[15,17,18]. In the absence of clinically active tuberculosis disease, the presence of tuberculin
immunoreactivity is referred to as ‘Latent Tuberculosis Infection’ (LTBI) broadly signifying the
absence of tuberculosis disease but the presence of active immunity against the pathogen [17-19].
However, it should be noted that due to a lack of direct tests to ascertain the asymptomatic or
Latent Tuberculosis infection (LTBI), the presence of immunoreactivity to mycobacterial antigens as
determined by TST or IGRA in the absence of clinically active tuberculosis is currently defined as
‘LTBI’ by WHO for ‘being at-risk of developing TB’ as a part of ‘World Health Organization’s End TB
strategy’ to identify/track the individuals at-risk for the management follow-up purposes [18,19]. It is
acknowledged by the WHO that only a small fraction (5-10%) of these individuals may develop TB
over the course of their lives [18,20]. Furthermore, it is estimated that upto 90% of LTBI individuals
developing tuberculosis later could be attributed to reinfection on the waning of immunoreactivity
(immunity) while remaining small minority could be attributed to actual reactivation of latent bacilli
[17,19] on immunosuppression (e.g., HIV infection, cancer, immunosuppressant therapy) in
genuinely LTBI individuals that may at the most could comprise 1-11 % of ‘LTBI’ labeled individuals
in different settings as per an estimate based on several previous epidemiological studies [19]. This
‘LTBI’ nomenclature for persons at-risk of developing tuberculosis has been retained by WHO
though not without causing confusion and general avoidance of its use as a proxy measure of
imparted protective cell-mediated immunity or the associated ‘trained immunity’ of the population in
the general parlance [19]. We reason, if indeed ‘trained immunity’ or persisting cell-mediated
immunity conferred by exposure to Mycobacterium spp. (Environmental or BCG) could help reduce
COVID-19 infections or mortality in a population, the estimated prevalence of the tuberculin
immunoreactivity or the so-called ‘% LTBI’ [21] of resident populations would closely correlate with
COVID-19 infection and mortality rates regardless of the BCG vaccination policy, BCG coverage or
its implementation among countries [22]. The European countries that have a quite mix of diverse
BCG vaccination policies - ranging from none ever to current universal vaccination [22], relatively
comparable medical infrastructure, mobility, exposure to SARS-CoV-2, and other confounding
variables and more importantly currently at a similar stage of epidemic-curve, i.e., post-infectionspeak but could have differential ‘trained immunity’ and cell-mediated immunity status as may be
supposed from %LTBI prevalence [5,6,7,12] offer an excellent opportunity to evaluate such an
assertion.

METHODS:

The populations from 20 European countries with a differential prevalence of %LTBI [21] (published
by the ‘Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME)’ 2018) and comparable confounding
variables, including the stage of the pandemic (infections peak) (Table 1) are assessed for any
correlation with COVID-19 cases and mortality data of the ongoing pandemic from different stages,
i.e., 8 April, 12 May, and 26 May 2020 from https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ [23] without
any exclusion criterion (e.g., age, sex, ethnicity) or data transformation/normalization, as done
previously for vitamin D [24].

RESULTS:
The potential ‘trained immunity’ prevalence of the populations (i.e., %LTBI) display a strong correlation
with COVID-19 infections (Table 1). Early-stage comparisons of the impact could be marred with
changing local public policies and adherence to them (compare the change in COVID-19 incidence
and mortality among countries in Table 1 over time; it could be also applicable to the analysis
recently presented in reference [3 and 4]). Our analysis of the COVID-19 data reveals a consistently
negative covariation of the cases per million with population’s %LTBI at all the time points evaluated
[r(20): -0.5511 to -0.6338; p-value: 0.0118 to 0.0027] both pre- and post-infections peak [8 April to
26 May 2020], whereas the negative covariation of deaths per million population [r(20) - 0.2836 to 0.3283] though improved post-infections peak did not reach statistical significance (p-values >0.05)
(Table 1), similar to previously observed by us for other countries at an earlier phase of the
pandemic [2]. See Figure 1 for the potential predictive correlative inference of the data on May 26,
2020.

DISCUSSION:

In the differential tuberculin immunoreactive populations of European countries, the COVID-19
cases per million population negatively covary with the %LTBI prevalence at each analyzed stage of
the pandemic. However, this negative correlation observed with deaths per million populations does
not reach statistical significance as could be partly expected from individuals/population
components without sufficient protective ‘trained immunity’ or cell-mediated immunity being prone to
getting infected and the non-adjustment of other underlying confounding variables including but not
limited to age, medical practices, and medical infrastructure and support. The transformation of data
and its adjustment for confounding variables as done in the recent reports [3, 4] are expected to
further improve the correlation observed in the current study but its relevance cannot be ensured
rather we should allow space for other potential protective variables to be discovered, discussed
and evaluated. In short, regardless of the childhood BCG vaccination status, the cell-mediated
tuberculin immunoreactivity or ‘LTBI’ prevalence could be argued to be more important in assessing
the functional potentially protective trained immunity and cell-mediated heterologous immunity of a
population.
The strength of the assertion lies in the large affected study population, i.e., 1,413,367 COVID-19
patients (about 25% of total worldwide cases on 26.05.2020) [23]; representing 20 different %LTBI
prevalence groups/populations from countries ranging from never ever to current mandatory BCG
vaccination policy; comparable health infrastructure, screening and reporting guidelines along with
similar age and sex distribution and other confounding variables. The correlation analysis
consistently indicates the same association at all 3 different time points of the epidemic curve
evaluated indicating a potential protective impact of the populations’ immunoreactivity to
mycobacterial antigens regardless of source (BCG or environmental mycobacteria). Thus, the LTBI
prevalence in countries could very well satisfactorily explain the COVID-19 impact regardless of the
consideration of BCG vaccination policy or its implementation [3,4,14].
The states belonging to the former East and West Germany present a peculiar case for putting the
current assertions to test with respect to other recently reported studies that find a protective role for
BCG vaccination policy on COVID-19 incidences and mortality. Currently, formal estimates of LTBI
prevalence for East and West Germany are not available [21]. However, as per a tuberculosis
contact tracing study performed in a police academy in 2006 by Diel et al. the estimated differential

TST positivity in personnel (age group 15-62 years) from East and West Germany were 27% LTBI
(89.2 % BCG vaccinated) and 16 % LTBI (30.7% BCG vaccinated), respectively [25]. Assuming the
sample to be representative of the population, the 8% annual decrease in TST positivity as
expected from previous estimates for adults [16] would predict West Germans to have already
reached the average background level of 9.2 %LTBI for Germany in 2017 while the East Germans
maybe still having higher cell-mediated immunity and trained immunity as could be expected from
estimated prevailing LTBI of 22.5 % for the same age-progressed group (now 30-78 years)
(Supplementary File 1). The observed average COVID-19 incidence in East Germany (102.99 per
million) had consistently remained lower than West Germany (214.55 per million) as per the
estimate available on 22 May 2020 available at https://www.citypopulation.de/en/germany/covid/
(excluding the city-states Berlin, Bermen and Hamburg) [On 17 Aug 2020 the incidences were: East
Germany 121.74 per million; West Germany 262 per million] (Supplementary File 1). Similarly, many
fold lower mortality has been consistently observed in East Germany till now as per the available
data at https://www.citypopulation.de/en/germany/covid/ despite having higher elderly population
[3]. The countries in southern hemisphere Australia and New Zealand with the comparable
prevalence of LTBI (Australia: 10.12%; New Zealand: 11.36%), supposedly with comparable
confounding variables (e.g., social and medical practices, access to health services, infrastructure,
population composition, age distribution, general health, etc) to European countries and at the
similar stage of pandemic (already passed first peak of infections), have experienced quite a benign
impact of COVID-19 (Australia: 280 cases and 4 deaths per million; New Zealand: 312 cases and 4
deaths per million as on 26 May 2020) as has been observed for higher LTBI prevalence European
country Slovakia (12.7% LTBI; 277 cases and 5 deaths per million as on 26 May 2020)[23]. There
may be other potentially protective variables at play as well that may be contributing to this reduced
incidence and mortality such as vitamin D levels, Zinc levels, etc which may be beyond the scope of
current discussion [24,26]. Strikingly, similar negative covariation of COVID-19 incidence and
mortality with estimated ‘LTBI’ prevalence can be seen in the groups of other countries/populations
which can be assumed to have comparable confounders and at a similar stage of the pandemic for
the purpose of comparison, e.g., the incidence of COVID-19 per million population in four top worstaffected countries of South America (>1500 cases/million population) namely, Brazil (1847 cases
per million; %LTBI: 26.05), Ecuador (2121 cases per million; 18.2% LTBI), Peru (3941 cases per
million; %LTBI:17.32), and Chile (4082 cases per million; %LTBI: 13.79) increased with decreasing
% LTBI (perfect negative covariation) independent of their BCG vaccination policy or coverage as
on 26 May 2020 [23] (see Supplementary File 1). Among them Ecuador does not have current
vaccination policy while it had it in the past, the other three nations have universal BCG vaccination
policy in which Chile reports the most wider coverage. However, it should be noted that these
comparisons/covariations would supposedly start to become reliable/stable once at least all
countries with supposed similar confounders, have passed the peak of infections [24] and could
progressively reach the maximum level of reliance at the end of current pandemic – when outcome
of each infection becomes known.
Multiple past studies indicate that the presence of tuberculin reactivity, not the BCG vaccination
history in the young as well as the old to be negatively correlated with the incidence of several
diseases including respiratory diseases [REFs in 1,3-12,15] and the elderly had been recommended
to remain TST positive to reduce chances of unrelated disease and pneumonia [9,10]. It must be
remembered that BCG vaccination does not necessarily elicit a cell-mediated immune response in
all, at the same rate and there is also reported loss with age or absence of re-challenge and
immune suppression. In the view of observation presented, it may be suggested that ongoing
trials/studies evaluating the effect of BCG vaccination on COVID-19 infections [1,13], including the

one recently concluded in Israel and reported in JAMA [14] could provide more objective
conclusions on inclusions of the estimates about the ‘trained immunity’ and heterologous cellmediated immune response of study participants/ populations [5,12].
It is pertinent to mention here that the statistical correlations no matter how significant they appear
from covariation/correlation value, and the associated p-value significance levels, they never
indicate a cause and effect relationship. Till the cause and effect relationships are unequivocally
established for variables based on evidence, efforts to make predictions/projections and overfitting
of the data may be better avoided – giving a false sense of cause and effect relationship. Statistical
correlation of COVID-19 with BCG vaccination policy, coverage, or implementation year that is
being presented in the literature using highly transformed variables that give high R2 value and low
p-values and being hotly discussed, even if it had been proven, are equally of no interventional use
in the current scenario as there is no means to go in the past and vaccinate the current vulnerable
population of the elderly and people with comorbidities nor change GDP, migration rate, population
density, etc. [REFs in 2-4]. Rather resources may be channelized to evaluate/ explore the
potentially protective co-varying variables that possibly may have cause and effect relationship employing appropriate controls, and would be amenable to intervention, no matter how weak the
relationship may appear.
Dedicated studies using the available patient records or epidemiological surveys backed by followup clinical trials with suitable controls for the ‘trained immunity’ and heterologous cell-mediated
immunity correlates are advisable to decisively assess the biological significance/evidence of the
current and previously observed correlations or their absence to put the ongoing debate to rest and
reach at a more meaningful conclusion about the interventional usage of non-specific trained
immunity and heterologous cell-mediated immunity in COVID-19 control.

Figure 1: The prevalence of %LTBI in European countries negatively correlated with COVID19 cases per million population (26 May 2020)

Supplementary File 1: Sheet 1 - E. and W. Germany States: The incidence of COVID-19 in East
and West Germany states starting 10 April 2020 to 17 Aug 2020 provided. The incidence of in
COVID-19 in East Germany (22.5% LTBI estimated) consistently remained lower than West
Germany (9.2 % LTBI). (Estimated LTBI is for 30-78 yr age group). Sheet 2 - South America
COVID-19: The incidence among four top COVID-19 affected countries Brazil, Ecuador, Peru and
Chile negatively covaries with %LTBI prevalence [Note perfect covariation observed on later stage
(26 May 2020) as compared to earlier stage (12 May 2020) of pandemic as expected].
