Abstract
The novel coronavirus disease (namely COVID-19) has taken attention because of its deadliness across the globe, causing a massive
death as well as critical situation around the world. It is an infectious disease which is caused by newly discovered coronavirus. Our
study demonstrates with a nonlinear model of this devastating COVID-19 which narrates transmission from human-to-human in the
society. Pontryagin’s Maximum principle has also been applied in order to obtain optimal control strategies where the maintenance of
social distancing is the major control. The target of this study is to find out the most fruitful control measures of averting coronavirus
infection and eventually, curtailed of the COVID-19 transmission among people. The model is investigated analytically by using most
familiar necessary conditions of Pontryagin’s maximum principle. Furthermore, numerical simulations have been performed to
illustrate the analytical results. The analysis reveals that implementation of educational campaign, social distancing and developing
human immune system are the major factors which can be able to plunge the scenario of becoming infected.

1. Introduction
The recent outbreak of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease) has newly emerged at the end of 2019 in Wuhan (capital of Hubei province,
China), which has now become a global pandemic. In 2003, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Coronavirus first identified
whereas first infected humans were detected in the Guangdong province of Southern China in 2002. Almost 26 countries affected by
this SARS-CoV causing above 8000 cases in 2003 [24]. The newly emerged COVID-19 caused by coronavirus is genetically identical
to SARS-CoV 2002. Hence, the scientists have named this virus as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV2). It is thought that SARS-CoV is an animal virus from an animal reservoir, probably bats that spread to other animal like civet cats.
COVID-19 is a human-to-human transmittable disease. It seems to have occurred mainly during the second week of illness. The
symptoms of this disease include fever, malaise, myalgia, cough, shortness of breath, diarrhoea, headache and shivering. There is no
specific symptom for the diagnosis of SARS. Though fever is the most frequent symptom but in adult and immunosuppressed patients
it is most often absent on initial stage.
In 2020 on 2 April, there were approximately 81,589 cases of coronavirus in China. Among which about 76,408 people got recovered
whereas almost 3,318 people died from this devastating disease [11]. But the wonderful matter is that the currently infected
populations have been decreased because of the implementation of proper measures and consciousness among people in China.
Besides, on 13 March, World Health Organization declared Europe as the most epicenter of COVID-19 the pandemic disease. Among
European countries, Italy has the most cases outside of China followed by Spain, Germany, France, Switzerland, Netherlands, Austria,
and Belgium. But now the scenario has completely been changed. At present United States has become the top spot in the case of
COVID-19 related incidence and death in the world.
There is an extensive body of work to formulate mathematical models and optimal control strategies of emerging infectious diseases.
Biswas et al. [1] developed a SEIR model for infectious diseases and also employed optimal control strategy introducing state
constraints on the model. In this continuation, Biswas et al. [9] proposed a nonlinear model to show the optimal immunotherapeutic
treatment for HIV. See also Biswas [2-8] where he showed mastery knowledge in investigating and analyzing the mechanisms of the
most devastating diseases in which mathematical modeling and optimal control technique acted as the key tool. Several well
documented models of COVID-19 have been presented as well. Kucharski et al. [17] studied a mathematical model on early dynamics
of transmission and control of COVID-19. Zhuang et al. [31] estimated the COVID 19 cases by the imported cases and air travel data

from Iran to other Middle East countries. Zhang et al. [30] presented a data-driven analysis on the estimation on the reproductive
number of COVID-19 and the probable outbreak size on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. A modeling study on domestic and
international spread of COVID-19 has been analyzed by in detail Wu et al. [25]. Lin et al. [21] proposed a conceptual model for the
COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan with the consideration of individual behavioral reaction and governmental actions. Zhang et al. [29]
developed a new psychological crisis intervention model by utilizing internet technology. Khan and Atangana [18] modeled the
dynamics of novel coronavirus with fractional derivative. They applied the Atangana-Baleanu derivative because of their kernel being
nonlocal and nonsingular and also for their crossover behavior. An accurate early forecasting model from small dataset regarding
nCOVID-19 has been analyzed by Fong et al. [15]. Readers can also follow (Zhao et al. [27]; Zhao et al. [28]; Sookaromdee and
Wiwanitkit [23]; Chen et al. [14]; Chen and Yu [13]; Xu et al. [26]; Khatun and Biswas [19, 20] and references within) for more
detailed information about novel coronavirus (COVID-19) as well as very recent implementation of modeling and optimal control
techniques.
In view of the gravity that associates with decisions to be made about the pandemic COVID-19, there needs an urgent and serious
coordinated response from all sectors to combat against the highly infectious disease as soon as possible. As part of this coordinated
approach, we present a mathematical model of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) to show the transmission which can be controlled
effectively by maintaining social distancing as well as treatment. In this study, we analyze the mathematical modeling of COVID-19
and also apply optimal control theory introducing three controls to prevent the transmission of this severe infectious disease. Finally
we perform numerical simulations to interpret the outcomes and also to show the effectiveness of the controls in preventing and/or
curing the infection. The main aim of this work is to minimize the infection by applying the controls and also the associated cost of the
implementation of the three controls measures.
2. Current Scenario of COVID-19
At present (on 02 April, 2020) USA has the most COVID-19 cases outside of China (about 81,589 infections) with about 215,344
incidences, followed by Italy at 110,574, Spain at 110,238, Germany at 77,981, France at 56, 989, Iran at 47,593 and other countries.
Besides, other parts in Europe the cases have been becoming soared nowadays. As for example, currently United Kingdom has 29,474
incidences, followed by Switzerland at 17,781, Belgium at 15,348, Netherlands at 13,614, and Austria at 10,842. But it is noticeable
that the death rate in USA is lower than Italy. The COVID 19 related death rate is very high in Italy (at 13,155) followed by Spain at
10,003, France at 4,032 and the COVID 19 related recovery rate is raised in China (at about 76,408) followed by Spain at 26,743, Italy
at 16,847. The detailed about coronavirus related cases, deaths from the disease and recovered rate are presented in Figure 1 [10]. The
novel coronavirus-2 disease (COVID 19) is mysterious because it transmits only through eyes, nose and mouth of the human being
and directly targets our lunge. Initially, COVID 19 emerged in China and from there the devastating disease spread out almost 206
countries in the world. Present scenario of COVID 19 related incidence and death rate are shown in Figure 2 [11]. The deadly
coronavirus has also broken out in Bangladesh along with other countries in the world. The first coronavirus cases in Bangladesh have
been noticed on 8 March 2020 and since then it has been spread out across the country. Now this disease has become an epidemic in
Bangladesh. At the beginning of infection in Bangladesh only three persons were affected by this novel coronavirus but the infection
has risen considerably. On 16 March, there were about five persons infected from COVID 19 but it had increased on 23 March by nine
persons. By this time, about 6 patients have died from this fatal disease COVID 19. However, the biggest problem here is that the new
incidence rate is increasing day by day. The present status of COVID 19 cases from March 8 to April 3 are exhibited in Figure 3 [12].

3. Compartmental Model
SARS Coronavirus-2 is a newly discovered mysterious pathogen and there are no appropriate drugs and/or vaccines yet for its
treatments. So, in order to find out effective methods for prevention and control of SARS Coronavirus-2 disease, it is indispensable for
the physicians and biologists to understand the disease mechanisms in the human. However, SARS coronavirus-2 is such type of virus
which first transmitted from animal to human. When it has been transmitted to human, then it continues to be transmitted through
human to human by the closed contact of infected individuals due to its highly infectiveness. In the present study we highlight only
human to human transmission. So, the whole dynamics of SARS Coronavirus-2 disease (COVID-19) can be described by a SIRS type
infectious disease model in terms of a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (NODEs). Let us consider that S  t  , Q  t  ,

I  t  , I s  t  , and R  t  be the number of susceptible, quarantined, infected, isolated and removed individuals respectively at time t .
Let N  t  be the total population at time t where N  t   S  t   Q  t   I  t   I s  t   R  t  . Here, the susceptible individuals

 S  t   are those who are not affected by the coronavirus infections but any time they may be infected. The individuals who come
from overseas mainly from the COVID-19 affected areas and people who come in contact with those individuals have high possibility
of carrying the infection. Therefore, such populations must maintain social distancing to combat the transmission of this highly
infectious disease. These populations are denoted by quarantined population, Q  t  in the model. The Quarantine is actually a
restriction on the movement of people who are supposed to be exposed to infectious disease to prevent the spread of the disease. They
may have been exposed to the disease but do not know or they may have the disease but do not show symptoms. Such populations are
categorized as the quarantined individuals in the present model. As COVID-19 has an incubation period of 2-14 days, the individuals
are to be quarantined for this time period until their medical checkup is confirmed. After performing the test, people who are identified

as COVID-19 positive are taken as the infected individual, I  t  in the model and these individuals have that ability to transmit.
Individuals who have had the coronavirus infections (COVID-19) and they can transmit the infections any time. These especial
individuals are called infected individuals I  t  . The individuals who are identified with coronavirus infections or COVID-19 and
they are isolated to a separate place/ state for treatment. These individuals are described in the compartmental model as isolated
individuals compartment and these individuals are denoted by I s  t  . The removed individuals R  t  are those who have recovered
and thus have the immunity or have died from the disease and thus cannot contribute to further disease transmission. Figure 1 shows
the transmission mechanisms of the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19.

Taking the above diagram into consideration, we formulate a five compartmental model with control in terms of a set of nonlinear
ordinary differential equations (NODEs) of the following form:

In the developed model, we have considered three control measures  u1 , u2 , u3  : (i) before infection, educational campaign among
mass people so that the human to human transmission of coronavirus-2 infections can be prevented and (ii) after infection, (a)
maintenance of social distancing which has been considered only the fruitful and effective step ever now to control the transmission of
this horrible disease (COVID-19) and (b) treatment of the patients on the basis of the symptoms to minimize their sufferings. So
that, u1  t  , u2  t  and u3  t  denotes the educational campaign, social distancing and treatment control respectively.

Model (1) is an optimal control model and the set of control measures  u1  t  , u2  t  , u3  t   U is Lebesgue measurable, where

U   u1  t  , u2  t  , u3 t   : 0  ai  ui t   bi  1, i  1, 2,3 , t  0, T  .
After considering these three control variables, we write the cost functional in the following form,

where A , B and C are the weight parameters or balancing parameters of the cost functional.
We can reformulate model (1) as the standard optimal control problem with respect to the cost functional (2) as

4. Characterization of the Optimal Control
We apply Pontryagin’s Maximum Principle to the Hamiltonian (H) in order to obtain the necessary conditions for this optimal control
problem. Using Pontryagin’s Maximum Principle, the optimal control terms (such as educational campaign, social distancing and
treatment) the standard Hamiltonian function H with respect to  u1 , u2 , u3  can be defined as follows:

H  t , x  t  , u  t  , p  t  ,   t    p  t  , f  x  t    g  x  t   u  t    L  x t  , u t   ,  

where p  pS , pQ , pI , pI s , pR 

denotes the adjoint variables.

Suppose that the pair  x , u  is the optimal solution of the above optimal control problem. Then, the maximum principle states the
existence of a scalar parameter 0  0 , an absolutely continuous function p  t  , such that the following conditions are held:



In the present model, x , u is the optimal pair where x  denotes the state variables and u  represents control variables. So, in order
to prove the existence of the optimal control, we have to show the existence of the state as well as the existence of the control
variables.
a.

Existence of the State Variable

The state equation (1) with the initial condition can be written in the following form as
S   k  0 S  t    S t  Q t    S t  I t    0  I s t    R t 

I    I  t  S  t    Q  t        0  I  t    0  I s  t    0  R  t 

5

I s    0  S  t    0  Q  t    I     0    I S   0  R  t 
R   0  S  t   Q  t    I  t    I S  t     0    R  t 

Let N  t   S  t   Q  t   I  t   I s  t   R  t  .

6

So that, N   t   S   t   Q  t   I   t   I s  t   R   t  .
Now from equation (5) and (6), we can write

N  t   k   I s  0 N t   N  t    I s  k  0 N t   N  t   k  0 N t  .

Here, N  t  is the total population.
So, we have N  t  

and lim sup N  t   V1 ,

which gives S  t  , Q  t  , I  t  , I s  t  , R  t   V1 as t   .
Then, we can rewrite equation (5) in the following form:

Also, we get D  1   D  2   B  1  2  M  1  2  V  1  2 ,
where, V  max  M , B    .
Thus, it follows that the function D is uniformly Lipschitz continuous. From the definition of the control U  t  and the restriction on

S , Q, I , I s , and R  0 , we see that a solution of the system (7) exists.
b. Existence of the Control Variable
Now, by applying Pontryagin’s Maximum Principle [22] we have the following theorem and proving Theorem 1, we show the
existence of controls.

6. Numerical Results and Discussion
In this section, we have performed numerical simulations of optimal control model (3) using Open-OCL [16] written in MATLAB
programming. In order to carry out numerical solutions of the model, we use a set of rational parameter values which are shown in
Table 1. We simulate the model in two different ways. Firstly, we run the program of the model (1) without using any control
variables and the simulated graph is shown in Figure 5. Furthermore, we perform the simulation of model (3) with control variables
(such as educational campaign, social distancing and treatment). In this case, the results for each compartment are presented in Figures
6-9. Graphical outcomes are executed using the initial values: S  10, 000, Q  6, 000, I  70, I s  3000 , R  30 .

We have performed the whole simulations of the compartmental model (3) for both with and without control within 60 days timeline.
For solving the model (3) with control, we simulate the optimal systems when all the three control variables (such as educational
campaign, social distancing and treatment control) for coronavirus-2 disease (COVID 19) are employed. This time, we first run the
program for the quarantined individuals for both cases (i.e. with and without control). Hence, the simulated outcome is illustrated in
Figure 6. Basically, we adopt this in order to see the comparison of the different individuals (quarantined, infected, isolated and
recovered individuals) for with and without control in the same window. We also run the program of the infected, isolated and
recovered individuals for both with and without control separately. The simulated results are represented in Figures 7- 9 respectively.

Figure 5. State trajectories of the compartmental model (1) when no control measures are employed (i.e. u1  0, u2  0, u3  0 ).

Figure 5 shows that the number of quarantined and infected individuals increases for first two days but probably in day three, it
slightly reduces. From day five, the number of quarantined and infected individuals starts to grow whereas the number of isolated and
recovered individuals soars from the initial state. However, it is noticeable that the number of susceptible individuals rises up for the
first two days but for the next two days it decreases abruptly. Then it remains steady. This means that as the quarantined and infected
individuals increase, the more individuals become isolated to get medical treatment as well as maintenance of social distancing, the
more individuals get recovered.

Figure 6. State trajectories of the quarantined individuals when educational campaign control  u1  and social distancing control  u 2  .

Figure 6 illustrates the influences of educational campaign and social distancing control on the quarantined individuals for 60 days
timeline. Here, it has been noticed that both the three control measures significantly control the number of quarantined individuals.
The effects of the three controls are obvious in the figure. The number of quarantined individuals rises up when no control is
employed but with the application of controls though it shows a slight decrease in days 1-3 and 9-10, it sharply plunges for the other
time interval.

Figure 7. State trajectories of the infected individuals when educational campaign control  u1  , social distancing control  u 2  and treatment
control  u3  are employed.

Figure 7 shows the influences of educational campaign, social distancing and treatment control on the infected individuals for 60 days
timeline. From the figure, it has been observed that the number of infected individuals increases in the absence of control but when all
three controls are employed, it shows a decreasing effect for the first eleven days and then gradually goes up. The reason behind the
rise may be that the influence of educational campaign and treatment are not enough effective on infected individuals as no specific
treatment for COVID-19 exists.

Figure 8. State trajectories of the isolated individuals when educational campaign control  u1  , social distancing control  u 2  and treatment
control  u3  are activated.

Figure 8 demonstrates the effects of three control measures such as educational campaign, social distancing and treatment control on
the number of isolated individuals for 60 days timeline. In this case, it has been seen that the three control measures remarkably
influences the isolated individuals. The isolated individual goes up with time without controls whereas it initially increases but
gradually goes down for the first ten days and then it soars for the rest timeline with the application of the three controls.

Figure 9. State trajectories of the quarantined individuals when educational campaign control  u1  , social distancing control  u 2  and treatment
control  u3  are engaged.

Figure 9 depicts the effects of three control measures such as educational campaign, social distancing and treatment control on the
number of recovered individuals for 60 days timeline. In this case, it is noticeable that the three control measures have significant
influence on the recovered individuals. In the absence of control the number of recovered individuals is nearly zero for first ten days,
then it shows a slight increase up to twenty days and finally it goes up. But this increase is lower than the expectation and also it is too
small compared to the number of infected and isolated individuals. Hence to get the desired result, three controls have been employed
and the recovered individuals swiftly booms for the implementation of educational campaign and social distancing as a prevention and
treatment as cure of the disease COVID 19.
7. Conclusions
COVID-19 is a highly contagious pandemic disease which is threatening the entire world with its devastating character. It is assumed
that if the present trend of COVID-19 outbreak continues, then obviously humanity could face its most devastating pandemic. As there
is no proper treatment with drugs or vaccines until to date, social distancing and educational campaign are the only ways to prevent
and control people from being affected. Such a control strategy via mathematical modeling is discussed in the present study. The
model is formulated considering three control variables by using the most well-known Pontryagin’s Maximum Principle. Numerical
simulations have been performed to illustrate the analytic results. After investigation, it is observed that social distancing and
educational campaign as prevention and treatment as cure are much more effective for the reduction of quarantined, infected and
isolated individuals and at the same time the recovered individuals show a remarkable ascendancy. Since no antiviral medication
(vaccination / natural health products) is authorized to treat or protect against COVID-19, implementation of educational campaign,
social distancing and developing human immune system may be the best ways for preventing the disease before it goes out of control.
Therefore, it is high time we took effective and strict measures to combat against this most devastating disease.
