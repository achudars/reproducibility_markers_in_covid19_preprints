Abstract
Using 65 transmission pairs of SARS-CoV-2 reported to the Brazilian Ministry of Health we
estimate the mean and standard deviation for the serial interval to be 2.97 and 3.29 days
respectively. We also present a model for the serial interval probability distribution using only
two parameters.

Text
The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in
China in December 2019 [1] and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on
11 March 2020. Current assessments of SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics rely on accurate
estimates of key epidemiological parameters, including the serial interval, which can be defined
as the time between symptom onset of the source and the onset of symptoms of the recipient [2].
Moreover, serial interval estimations can help disentangling the duration of pre-symptomatic
transmission upon infection. When the serial interval is greater than the incubation period, an
epidemic is characterized by symptomatic transmission. However, existence of pre-symptomatic
transmission can be inferred when the serial interval is shorter than the incubation period.
We estimate the serial interval of SARS-CoV-2 from 65 infector-infectee pairs from
Brazil. Data was provided by the Brazilian Ministry of Health following ethical approval
(CONEP protocol number 30127020.0.0000.0068). All confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2
infection notified on the REDCap system between 25th February and 19th March were analyzed.
We received data on infector and infectee pairs by the Brazilian Ministry of Health, and we
measured the serial intervals by computing the difference between the dates of symptom onset of
each pair.
The median serial interval in our data was estimated at 3 (standard deviation = 3.29)
days. We identified 4 (6.15% of 65) negative serial intervals (symptom onset in the infectee
preceded the infector) and seven (10.77% of 65) zero-valued serial intervals (symptom onset on
the same day for the infector-infectee pair). It is common to censor observed serial intervals to
include only positive values; however, there is no strong theoretical justification for this. As

such, we fit a serial interval probability distribution that allows for negative values by modelling
the serial interval as:
Serial Interval = ‚åäùë°inf,1 + Œîùë°lat,1 + Œîùë°lat,2 + Œîùë°int,2 ‚åã ‚àí ‚åäùë°inf,1 + Œîùë°lat,1 + Œîùë°int,1 ‚åã,
where ‚åä‚ãÖ‚åã is the floor operator, ùë°inf,1 is a random variable uniformly distributed in the interval
[0,1], (Œîùë°lat,1 , Œîùë°lat,2 ) are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) chi-squared random
variables of mean 3.03 days and (Œîùë°int,1 , Œîùë°int,2 ) are i.i.d. chi-squared random variables of mean
0.95 days. See the Supplemental Material for theoretical motivation, methods and sensitivity
analysis.

Figure 1 shows the comparison between the observed and modelled serial intervals as
well as the means ¬± standard deviations for a number of serial interval probability distributions
presented in the literature [3‚Äì8]. Our proposed model for the serial interval probability
distribution approximates well the serial intervals measured from data.
We provide two additional analyses of the data in the Supplemental Material: i) Du et al.
[3] took an alternative approach fitting a normal distribution to 468 publicly reported serial
intervals in which 12% had negative values. For this reason, we fit a normal distribution to the
observed serial intervals and compare it to the distribution presented in [3], obtaining a lower
mean and variance. ii.) We censor the data to include only positive values, obtaining a
distribution of mean 3.83 days that is best fit by a lognormal distribution.
The mean serial interval in Brazil of 2.97 days is the shortest reported to our knowledge,
but we emphasize that the serial interval is not usually concentrated around the mean due to its
high standard deviation (3.29 days) and non-symmetry. Furthermore, our serial interval estimate
is shorter than the reported incubation period, implying that the infectious period for SARSCoV-2 begins before symptom onset. This is in line with recent observations of a large
proportion of undocumented infections, complicating containment of the virus [10]. The short
mean observed, and the relatively high probability of zero or negative serial intervals reinforces
previous results from Ganyani et al. [9], which estimate a large proportion of pre-symptomatic
transmission for Singapore and Tianjin. Together, our findings imply that even with screening
measures for travelers in airports, cruises or bus stations, the risk of transmission might remain
relatively high.
Our report presents the first serial interval estimates for SARS-CoV-2 from Latin
America. Our estimates are based on national case notification data, and this is a strength

compared to datasets compiled from media reports. However, there are at least two important
sources of bias. Firstly, there is a tendency for secondary cases to recall more recent contacts ‚Äì
recency or recall bias ‚Äì resulting in a shorter estimate of the serial interval. Similarly, contact
tracing is likely to be most effective for recent contacts. Secondly, self-isolation following
symptom onset will remove longer serial intervals that would have occurred due to transmission
during the symptomatic phase. This second point highlights the role of contextual factors such as
isolation practices, population density, location of transmission, proportion of the population
infected, in determining the serial interval.
In conclusion, we estimate a mean serial interval of COVID-19 at 2.97 days for Brazil.
This estimate shorter than published incubation periods, implying pre-symptomatic
undocumented transmission. Our estimate includes a substantial proportion of negative serial
intervals that implies a substantial proportion of secondary transmission prior to the onset of
symptoms.
