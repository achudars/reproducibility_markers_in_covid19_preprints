Abstract

42

Background:

43

Emerging evidence suggests that socially vulnerable communities are at higher risk for

44

coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreaks in the United States. However, no prior studies

45

have examined temporal trends and differential effects of social vulnerability on COVID-19

46

incidence and death rates. The purpose of this study was to examine temporal trends among

47

counties with high and low social vulnerability and to quantify disparities in these trends over

48

time. We hypothesized that highly vulnerable counties would have higher incidence and death

49

rates compared to less vulnerable counties and that this disparity would widen as the pandemic

50

progressed.

51
52

Methods:

53

We conducted a retrospective longitudinal analysis examining COVID-19 incidence and death

54

rates from March 1 to August 31, 2020 for each county in the US. We obtained daily COVID-19

55

incident case and death data from USAFacts and the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science

56

and Engineering. We classified counties using the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), a

57

percentile-based measure from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in which higher

58

scores represent more vulnerability. Using a Bayesian hierarchical negative binomial model, we

59

estimated daily risk ratios (RRs) comparing counties in the first (lower) and fourth (upper) SVI

60

quartiles. We adjusted for percentage of the county designated as rural, percentage in poor or

61

fair health, percentage of adult smokers, county average daily fine particulate matter (PM2.5),

62

percentage of primary care physicians per 100,000 residents, and the proportion tested for

63

COVID-19 in the state.

Results:

66

In unadjusted analyses, we found that for most of March 2020, counties in the upper SVI quartile

67

had significantly fewer cases per 100,000 than lower SVI quartile counties. However, on March

68

30, we observed a “crossover effect” in which the RR became significantly greater than 1.00 (RR

69

= 1.10, 95% PI: 1.03, 1.18), indicating that the most vulnerable counties had, on average, higher

70

COVID-19 incidence rates compared to least vulnerable counties. Upper SVI quartile counties

71

had higher death rates on average starting on March 30 (RR = 1.17, 95% PI: 1.01,1.36). The

72

death rate RR achieved a maximum value on July 29 (RR = 3.22, 95% PI: 2.91, 3.58), indicating

73

that most vulnerable counties had, on average, 3.22 times more deaths per million than the least

74

vulnerable counties. However, by late August, the lower quartile started to catch up to the upper

75

quartile. In adjusted models, the RRs were attenuated for both incidence cases and deaths,

76

indicating that the adjustment variables partially explained the associations. We also found

77

positive associations between COVID-19 cases and deaths and percentage of the county

78

designated as rural, percentage of resident in fair or poor health, and average daily PM2.5.

79
80

Conclusions:

81

Results indicate that the impact of COVID-19 is not static but can migrate from less vulnerable

82

counties to more vulnerable counties over time. This highlights the importance of protecting

83

vulnerable populations as the pandemic unfolds.

Introduction

86

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of coronavirus

87

disease 2019 (COVID-19), has created a global public health crisis since its onset in late 2019.

88

As of September 1, 2020, there have been over 6 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and over

89

183,000 related deaths in the United States (US) alone [1]. Emerging evidence indicates that the

90

pandemic disproportionately affects people of color, older individuals, and those of lower

91

socioeconomic status [2-7]. Recent data suggest that African Americans are contracting

92

COVID-19 at higher rates and are more likely to die from the virus [6, 8]. Two studies also

93

reported that COVID-19 infection rates are greater in US counties and in states with high Latinx

94

populations and monolingual Spanish speakers [4, 7]. Further, earlier studies from China found

95

that older age was associated with an increased risk of death among those infected with COVID-

96

19 [5, 9]. Older age was also associated with COVID-related hospitalizations in New York City

97

[10]. Underlying health conditions and comorbidities may partially explain these associations

98

[5], but do not fully account for the disproportionate burden. Recent studies suggest that social

99

determinants of health and community contextual factors contribute to these disparities, and that

100

socially vulnerable communities are at highest risk for COVID-19 outbreaks [6, 11-13].

101
102

Protecting vulnerable populations is critically important during the COVID-19 pandemic, as

103

these groups are generally at higher risk for adverse health outcomes [14, 15]. Hurst et al. define

104

vulnerability as an identifiably elevated risk of incurring greater wrong or harm [16]. One type

105

of vulnerability – social vulnerability – has been used by the Centers for Disease Control and

106

Prevention (CDC) to identify communities most at risk when faced with adverse events that may

107

impact health, such as natural disasters or disease outbreaks. The CDC developed the social

108

vulnerability index (SVI) to assist federal, state, and local governments in targeting and

109

mobilizing resources for at-risk counties in response to adverse events.

110
111

Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of considering social vulnerability in both

112

COVID-19 cases and deaths, although the findings have been somewhat inconsistent [17-19].

113

Karaye et al. examined associations between the SVI and cumulative COVID-19 cases on May

114

12, 2020 [17]. They found that SVI total score was associated with increased rates of COVID-

115

19. However, the authors found no association when they examined six states with high testing

116

rates. Khazanchi and colleagues conducted an analysis of COVID-19 cases and deaths through

117

April 19, 2020, and found that those living in the most vulnerable counties (highest SVI) had

118

greater risk of infection and death [19]. Nayak et al. examined associations between the SVI and

119

COVID-19 incidence and case fatalities through April 4, 2020, and found a significant

120

association between social vulnerability and case fatality but not incident cases [18]. Notably, all

121

three studies were cross-sectional and conducted at different time points early in the pandemic,

122

which might contribute to the inconsistent findings. In fact, to date, no prior studies have

123

examined longitudinal trends in social vulnerability and COVID-19 incidence and death rates in

124

an effort to determine how these relationships change over time. Therefore, the purpose of this

125

study was to examine temporal trends among counties with high and low social vulnerability and

126

to quantify disparities in these trends over time.

rates from March 1, 2020 to August 31, 2020 for each of the 3,142 US county and county

132

equivalents based on their unique Federal Information Processing Series (FIPS) codes [20, 21].

133

Specifically, we modeled the temporal trend in daily incidence and death rates for each county

134

and assessed differential risks by county-level social vulnerability. We hypothesized that highly

135

vulnerable counties would have higher incidence and death rates compared to less vulnerable

136

counties and that this disparity would widen over time. The Institutional Review Boards at the

137

Medical University of South Carolina and Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health

138

deemed this research exempt from review.

139
140

COVID-19 Incident Cases and Deaths

141

We obtained daily COVID-19 incident case and death data from USAFacts [22] and the Johns

142

Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering [23]. Because Johns Hopkins aggregates

143

data for some counties (e.g., the five boroughs of New York) [24], we opted to use the USAFacts

144

data in our primary analysis, and conducted a sensitivity analysis using Johns Hopkins data. For

145

both data sources, we downloaded daily incident case and death counts from March 1 to August

146

31, 2020. We obtained county population data from the 2019 population datafile compiled by

147

the US Census Bureau [25].

148
149

Social Vulnerability Index

150

We used publicly available data from the CDC’s Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease

151

Registry to classify counties using SVI [26]. The SVI is a percentile-based measure of social

152

vulnerability, or the resilience of communities to address stressors to health related to external

153

hazards (e.g., natural disasters or disease outbreaks) [27]. The Geospatial Research, Analysis &

154

Services Program within the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry created the SVI

155

database to help public health officials identify communities that will most likely need support

156

and resources during and after a hazardous event like a pandemic [26]. The overall index and

157

each theme is scored from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating greater vulnerability [26, 27].

158

The index was constructed using data from 15 variables from the US Census Bureau. A

159

percentile rank was calculated for each of these variables and grouped among four themes of SVI

160

that measure various aspects of vulnerability – these include Socioeconomic Status, Household

161

Composition, Race/Ethnicity/Language, and Housing/Transportation [26, 27].

162
163

The Socioeconomic Status theme is composed of percentile rank data for the following variables:

164

percentage below poverty, percentage unemployed, per capita income, and percentage with no

165

high school diploma. For Household Composition, the variables include percentage age 65 years

166

and older, percentage age 17 years or younger, percentage age 5 years or older with a disability,

167

and percentage of single-parent households. The Race/Ethnicity/Language theme encompasses

168

percentage minority and percentage who speaks English “less than well”. Finally, the

169

Housing/Transportation theme includes data for the percentage of multiunit structures,

170

percentage of mobile homes, percentage crowding, percentage having no vehicle, and percentage

171

of group quarters.

172
173

For our analyses, we downloaded the 2018 county-level SVI data (the most recent available) for

174

all 3,142 counties. One county was missing SVI data; for this county, we imputed SVI data

175

using the national average.

177

Adjustment Variables

178

We conducted both unadjusted and adjusted analyses for this study. For the adjusted analyses,

179

we selected variables unrelated to the components of SVI that could explain the differential

180

impact of COVID-19 on upper and lower SVI counties. These variables were chosen a priori

181

based on previously reported associations with COVID-19 incidence and deaths [17-19, 28-31].

182

We obtained several health and environmental factors from the Robert Wood Johnson

183

Foundation’s 2019 County Health Rankings & Roadmaps: Rankings Data & Documentation

184

[32]. These included the percentage of each county designated as rural, the percentage of

185

residents in poor or fair health, the percentage of adult smokers in the county, the average daily

186

PM2.5 for each county, and the number of primary care physicians per 100,000 in each county.

187

We also controlled for the cumulative proportion of COVID-19 Viral (RT-PCR) tests performed

188

in each state through August 31, 2020, which we obtained from the CDC Covid Data Tracker [1]

189

(county-level data are not currently available). We converted the number tested to a proportion

190

by dividing the number of tests by the state population sizes, which we obtained from the US

191

Census Bureau’s population estimate dataset [33].

192
193

Statistical Analysis

194

We first conducted an unadjusted analysis to compare trends across high- and low-SVI counties;

195

we then performed an adjusted analysis to determine whether the results changed substantially

196

after controlling for potential confounders. For both analyses, we fit Bayesian hierarchical

197

negative binomial models with daily incident cases and daily deaths for each county as the

198

outcomes. The models included penalized cubic Bsplines for both the fixed and random (i.e.,

199

county-specific) temporal effects, with knots placed every two weeks over the study period (15

200

total). The models also included county population as an offset on the log scale to convert the

201

case and death counts to population-adjusted rates.

202
203

To avoid overfitting the temporal splines, we assigned ridging priors to the fixed and county-

204

specific spline coefficients – i.e., independent, mean-zero normal distributions with shared

205

inverse gamma variances [34]. We assigned a gamma prior to the negative binomial dispersion

206

parameter. We developed an efficient data-augmented Gibbs sampler to aid posterior

207

computation [35, 36]. For both the incidence case and death rate models, we ran the Gibbs

208

sampler for 2,500 iterations with a burn-in 500 to ensure convergence. In sensitivity analyses,

209

we increased the number knots to 30 and found no appreciable difference in the results.

210
211

To report results, we compared counties in the top or upper SVI quartile (most vulnerable) to

212

those in bottom or lower SVI quartile (least vulnerable). For both quartiles, we graphed the

213

posterior mean incidence and death rate trends along with their 95% posterior intervals (PIs).

214

We also reported risk ratios (RRs) and 95% PIs comparing the upper and lower quartiles on each

215

day for the overall SVI and its themes. Additionally, we reported posterior mean trends for

216

select counties with differing SVI profiles.

217
218

For comparison, we refit the models controlling for potential confounders listed above. We

219

assigned weakly informative normal priors to the corresponding regression parameters. We

220

graphed the incidence and death rate trends, as well RRs, for the reference covariate group in the

221

adjusted analyses. We also reported posterior RRs and 95% PIs for the adjustment variables.

222

We conducted all analyses using R software version 3.6 (R Core Team 2019, R: A language and

Unadjusted Analysis

227

Overall SVI

228

The final analytic sample comprised 578,128 observations (3,142 counties x 184 study days).

229

There were 786 counties in each of the upper and lower SVI quartiles. Figure 1A presents the

230

per capita incidence trends (expressed as cases per 100,000) for the upper and lower quartiles of

231

SVI from the unadjusted analysis. For counties in the upper quartile, the average incidence

232

increased steadily from March 1 (estimated 0.002 cases per 100,000; 95% PI: 0.001, 0.004) to

233

April 25 (8.04 cases per 100,000; 95% PI: 7.67, 8.47). The incidence leveled off from April 26

234

to June 4 (8.97 cases per 100,000; 95% PI: 8.70, 9.25) before a precipitous increase through July

235

23 (31.26 cases per 100,000; 95% PI: 30.62, 31.83). The incident cases declined thereafter,

236

before a final uptick in late August (23.10 cases per 100,000 on August 31; 95% PI: 21.47,

237

25.12). The lower quartile exhibited a similar but less pronounced trend: there was a modest

238

increase from March 1 (0.002 cases per 100,000; 95% PI: 0.002, 0.004) to April 1 (3.04 cases

239

per 100,000; 95% PI: 2.91, 3.19) and a longer plateau lasting until June 16 (3.08 cases per

240

100,000; 95% PI: 2.97, 3.19). There was a modest increase from June 16 to July 20 (9.05 cases

241

per 100,000; 95% PI: 8.78, 9.31) followed by a sharp increase in late August (17.37 cases per

242

100,000 on August 31; 95% PI: 16.00, 19.00).

243
244

Figure 1B presents the posterior mean RRs comparing the upper and lower quartiles on each day.

245

On March 1, the RR for incident cases was 0.99 (95% PI: 0.73, 1.26), suggesting that upper SVI

246

quartile counties had, on average, fewer cases per 100,000 than lower SVI quartile counties,

247

although this result did not statistically differ from 1.00. In fact, through March 27, the RRs

248

were <1.00. On March 12, for example, the RR comparing the upper to the lower quartile

249

achieved its nadir at 0.63 (95% PI: 0.56, 0.71). However, on March 30, we observed a

250

“crossover effect” in which the RR became significantly greater than 1.00, indicating that the

251

more vulnerable counties had higher COVID-19 incidence on average compared to less

252

vulnerable counties (March 30 RR = 1.10, 95% PI: 1.03, 1.18). The RRs increased steadily

253

thereafter and achieved a maximum RR of 3.80 (95% PI: 3.63, 3.99) on June 23, then decreased

254

steadily until August 31 (RR = 1.33, 95% PI: 1.18, 1.49). This suggests that the disparity in per

255

capita cases between the upper and lower quartiles widened until late June, after which the lower

256

quartile began to keep pace with the upper quartile.

257
258

Figure 2A presents per capita death trends (expressed as deaths per million) for the upper and

259

lower quartiles of overall SVI. The death rates for both quartiles increased until April 26 before

260

receding slightly in May and June. Beginning in early July, however, the mean death rate for the

261

upper quartile increased steadily, achieving a maximum value on August 15 of 6.52 deaths per

262

million (95% PI: 6.20, 6.88). Figure 2B presents the daily RRs comparing the upper and lower

263

quartiles. Starting on March 30, the upper quartile had consistently higher death rates compared

264

to the lower quartile (RR = 1.17, 95% PI: 1.01,1.36). The RRs increased until achieving a

265

maximum value on July 29 (RR = 3.22, 95% PI: 2.91, 3.58) before tapering off in August

266

(August 31 RR = 2.13, 95% PI: 1.72, 2.65).

SVI. According to Figure 3B, incident cases were higher for the lower Socioeconomic Status

272

quartile from March 1 through April 3, with the lowest RR occurring on March 11 (RR = 0.52,

273

95% PI: 0.46, 0.58). Thus, on March 12, the most vulnerable counties had approximately half

274

the incidence as the least vulnerable counties. As with overall SVI, there was a crossover effect

275

on April 3 in which the RRs became significantly >1.00. The RRs achieved a maximum of 2.94

276

(95% PI: 2.82, 3.06) on June 20 before a plateau in July. Starting in August, the RRs declined

277

steadily as the per capita cases for the lower quartile began to catch up to the upper quartile

278

(August 31 RR = 1.45, 95% PI: 1.32, 1.62). Likewise, as indicated in Figure 4B, the death rate

279

was higher for the lower quartile than the upper quartile from March 1 through March 22, with

280

the lowest RR occurring on March 6 (RR = 0.73, 95% PI: 0.55, 0.93). As with incident cases,

281

The RRs became significantly positive on April 3 (RR = 1.15, 95% PI: 1.01, 1.31), and attained a

282

maximum value of 2.97 (95% PI: 2.70 3.29) on July 30. Unlike with incident cases, however,

283

the death rate disparity between upper and lower SES quartiles remained elevated through

284

August 31 (RR = 2.35, 95% PI: 1.89, 2.88).

SVI Theme: Household Composition

287

Figures 5A-B and 6A-B present the results for the Housing Composition theme. The crossover

288

effect was significantly delayed for this theme, with the crossover dates occurring on May 16 for

289

incident cases (Figure 5B) and on May 31 for deaths (Figure 6B). Thus, the pandemic appears to

290

have disproportionately impacted the least vulnerable counties with respect to household

291

composition for much of the early pandemic. However, these trends reversed by June. For

incident cases, the daily RRs achieved a maximum of 2.05 (95% PI: 1.99, 2.10) on July 26

293

(Figure 5B) and then declined steadily. By August 31, there was a null association between

294

upper and lower quartiles (RR = 1.00, 95% PI: 0.90, 1.10). For deaths (Figure 6B), the

295

maximum RR of 2.34 (95% PI: 1.96, 2.33) was achieved August 16 and, unlike incident cases,

296

remained above 2.0 through August 31 (RR = 2.10, 95% PI: 1.67, 2.57).

298

SVI Theme: Race/Ethnicity/Language

299

Figures 7A-B and 8A-B present the results for the Race/Ethnicity/Language theme. Unlike the

300

previous themes, vulnerable counties experienced higher incidence and death rates from the

301

outset of the pandemic. In fact, the disparity between the upper and lower quartile was greatest

302

for this theme, with a maximum incidence RR of 5.13 (95% PI: 4.84, 5.46) on May 2 and

303

another local peak on June 24 (Figure 7B). For cases, the RRs declined steadily from late June

304

into August, as the incidence for the lower quartile outpaced the upper quartile. By the end of

305

August, there was no significant association between upper and lower quartiles with respect to

306

incidence (RR = 0.92; 95% PI: 0.92, 1.02). In contrast, the death rate RRs (Figure 8B) hovered

307

between 2 and 3 for most of the late spring and summer, before a decline in August.

308
309

SVI Theme: Housing/Transportation

310

Figures 9A-B and 10A-B present the results for the Housing/Transportation theme. The incident

311

case RRs (Figure 9B) remained significantly positive from March 4 (RR = 1.18, 95% PI: 1.01,

312

1.35) through August 31, achieving a maximum of 2.78 (95% PI: 2.66, 2.92) on April 28. The

313

death rate RRs hovered around 2.00 for most of the study period, implying a uniform disparity

314

between upper and lower quartile counties

Illustrative Counties

317

Figures S1A-B in the Supporting Information present the incidence and death rate trends for

318

Brooks County, Texas, the county with the highest overall SVI score of 1.00. As expected of

319

high-SVI counties, the incidence and death rates remained low early in the pandemic, but began

320

to escalate in July and early August. Figures S2A-B present analogous trends for Elbert County,

321

Colorado, the county with the lowest overall SVI score of 0.00. The incidence and death rates

322

remained relatively low throughout the pandemic, with a slight uptick in early August. This

323

reflects the recent upward trend we observed in Figure S1A for counties in the lowest quartile.

324
325

Figures S3A-B and S4A-B present trends for two counties that illustrate the crossover effect we

326

observed in Figure 1A, whereby lower quartile counties had higher average incidence than the

327

upper quartile early in the pandemic. Figures S3A-B present results for Nassau County, New

328

York, which has an overall SVI score of 0.24, placing it in the lower quartile. Here, both

329

incidence cases and deaths spiked in early April before dissipating in May. In contrast, Figures

330

S4A-B show the trends for Taylor County, Florida, an upper-quartile county with an overall SVI

331

score of 0.90. As with Brooks County, the incidence and death rates were near zero until early

332

August, when the rates increased substantially due to an outbreak at a local correctional facility

333

[37].

Sensitivity Analysis Using Johns Hopkins Data

Sensitivity analysis using the Johns Hopkins data produced similar results to those we observed

337

using USAFacts data. Figures S5A-B and S6A-B present the incidence and death rate trends for

338

overall SVI. In all cases, the results were almost identical across the two data sources.

339
340

Adjusted Analysis

341

Figures S7A-B and S8A-B present the overall-SVI incidence and death rate trends for the

342

reference covariate group from the adjusted analyses. The incident case trends for overall SVI

343

(Figures S7A-B) were similar to the unadjusted trends, but the initial crossover date was delayed

344

slightly until April 11 (adjusted RR = 1.08, 95% PI: 1.01, 1.14). The RRs from June to mid-

345

August were significantly positive, but the values were attenuated relative to the unadjusted

346

model, achieving a maximum of 1.99 (95% PI: 1.86, 2.13) on June 21. This attenuation suggests

347

that adjustment accounted for some of the differential effect between upper and lower SVI

348

counties. Of note, by August 31, there was second crossover event in which the lower quartile

349

surpassed the upper quartile in per capita cases (RR: 0.74, 95% PI: 0.66, 0.87). We found

350

similar trends for the death rate models Figures S8A-B). Here, the initial crossover date was

351

delayed until June 6 (RR = 1.34, 95% PI: 1.00, 1.28) and the RRs for June-August were

352

attenuated, with a maximum of 1.62 (95% PI: 1.37, 1.85) on July 28. In general, the same

353

patterns emerged for the SVI themes: the initial crossovers were delayed, the RRs were

354

attenuated during the summer months, and by late August, the lower quartile matched or

355

superseded the upper quartile in per capita trends (Figures S9–S16). For the

356

Race/Ethnicity/Language theme, the incidence rate on August 31 for the upper quartile was

357

approximately half that for the lower quartile (RR = 0.52, 95% PI: 0.47, 0.58). Thus, controlling

358

for variable such as rurality, health, and PM2.5, appeared to account in part for the differences

359

between upper and lower quartiles observed in the unadjusted analyses.

361

There were also several significant associations among the adjustment variables (Table 1).

362

Percent rural and percent smoking were negatively associated with COVID-19 cases (percent

363

rural RR = 0.78, 95% PI: 0.76, 0.79; percent smoking RR = 0.81, 95% PI: 0.79, 0.83), as well as

364

deaths (percent rural RR = 0.77, 95% PI: 0.75, 0.80; percent smoking RR = 0.76, 95% PI: 0.73,

365

0.79). In contrast, percent in fair or poor health, average PM2.5, and state proportion tested were

366

positively associated with both cases (percent poor/fair health RR = 1.48, 95% PI: 1.45, 1.51;

367

PM2.5 RR = 1.26, 95% PI: 1.24, 1.28; proportion tested RR = 1.08, 95% PI: 1.06, 1.10) and

368

deaths (percent poor/fair health RR = 1.81, 95% PI: 1.74, 1.88; PM2.5 RR = 1.31, 95% PI: 1.27,

369

1.45; proportion tested RR = 1.13, 95% PI: 1.10, 1.16). Number of primary care physicians per

370

100,000 was associated with fewer cases (RR = 0.97, 95% PI: 0.95, 0.99), but was not associated

371

with deaths (RR = 1.00, 95% PI: 0.97, 1.03).

372
373

Finally, Tables S1-S4 in the Supporting Information present the top 10 counties with the highest

374

average incidence (Tables S1 and S2) and death rates (Tables S3 and S4) from the unadjusted

375

and adjusted models for the week of August 24 – 31, 2020. There was substantial overlap in the

376

unadjusted and adjusted rankings, with the unadjusted models ranking at the top southeastern

377

counties like Wayne, Tennessee, and Chattahoochee, Georgia, while the adjusted models pick up

378

on emerging trends in the northern Midwest and Mountain states, including Rosebud, Montana,

379

and Custer, South Dakota.

380
381

Discussion

382

In this study, we hypothesized that counties with greater vulnerability would have higher

383

COVID-19 incidence and death rates compared to less vulnerable counties and that this disparity

17

18
384

would widen over time. Overall, the incidence and death rates increased for both the more and

385

less socially vulnerable counties from March 1 to August 31, but the rates of increase varied

386

depending on the time period. For some SVI themes, we found that less vulnerable counties,

387

such as Nassau County, New York, had slightly higher average incidence and death rates early in

388

the pandemic compared to more vulnerable counties, such as Brooks County, Texas. However,

389

by April and May 2020, the trends crossed, with the most vulnerable counties experiencing, on

390

average, substantially higher burden from the disease compared to less vulnerable counties. This

391

crossover effect could be the result of state re-openings, which may have disproportionately

392

impacted more vulnerable counties. Crossover effects were observed for overall SVI (cases), as

393

well as Socioeconomic Status (cases and deaths) and, most notably, Household Composition

394

(cases and deaths), where the crossover date was delayed until mid-May. This theme represents

395

elderly and individuals with disabilities, and may reflect early outbreaks at long-term care

396

facilities in lower vulnerability areas such as King County, Washington [38]. For most SVI

397

themes, incident cases and deaths among the upper quartile counties outpaced those in the lower

398

quartile through July, with the most notable disparity occurring for the Race/Ethnicity/Language

399

theme. In many cases, the RRs declined in early August, as the lower quartile counties kept pace

400

with those in the upper quartiles. For some SVI themes, including Race/Ethnicity/Language, we

401

observed a second crossover event in late August, when the lower quartile surpassed the upper

402

quartile in per capita cases and deaths. These patterns held up after adjustment and in sensitivity

403

analyses using Johns Hopkins data. In fact, to our knowledge, this is the first study to track

404

COVID-19 trends across multiple data repositories.

406

Our findings are generally consistent with the study by Khazanchi et al. examining data up to

407

April 19, 2020, which found that counties in the top quartile of overall SVI had higher incidence

408

and death rates compared to those in the lower quartile [19]. As in that study, we found the

409

strongest disparity for the Race/Ethnicity/Language theme. However, Khazanchi et al. found no

410

association with Household Composition, whereas we found that the lower quartile had higher

411

rates of cases and deaths during this period. This may be due to the fact that the authors looked

412

at cumulative cases through April 19, whereas we examined daily incidence. Moreover, through

413

our longitudinal analysis, we observed that overall SVI, Socioeconomic Status and Housing

414

Composition had negative RRs for much of March and early April. This highlights the benefit of

415

the longitudinal approach: it provides a comprehensive picture of the evolving relationship

416

between SVI and COVID-19, rather than a momentary snapshot.

417
418

Our findings may also explain inconsistent findings in two other studies. As in our study,

419

Karaye et al. found that overall SVI and Race/Ethnicity/Language were associated with

420

increased COVID-19 incidence through May 12, 2020 [17]. However, they found no association

421

between Socioeconomic Status and incident cases, whereas Household Composition and

422

Housing/Transportation had an inverse relationship. Our results place these findings in temporal

423

context. In particular, we found a delayed crossover effect for Household Composition, with

424

RRs below or near 1.00 through mid-May. In particular, on May 12, we found a null association

425

for Household Composition (RR = 0.98, 95% PI: 0.93, 1.04) in agreement with Karaye et al;

426

however, just days later, on May 16, we found a significant positive association (RR = 1.06, 95%

427

PI: 1.01, 1.11). Nayak et al., meanwhile, found no association between overall SVI and

428

cumulative COVID-19 incidence on April 4, 2020 [18]. According to our results, however, this

19

20
429

was close to the crossover dates of March 30 (unadjusted analysis) and April 11 (adjusted

430

analysis), a period in which the disparity between high and low SVI counties hovered near 1.00.

431

By mid-April, we observed consistent positive associations between overall SVI and both cases

432

and deaths. Additionally, Nayak and colleagues found that the Race/Ethnicity/Language and

433

Housing/Transportation themes were positively associated with incident cases, but Household

434

Composition was not. However, we found that the RRs for Household Composition varied over

435

time. Again, these results highlight the need to consider both temporal and spatial variability

436

when attempting to fully understand, in real time, the impact of the pandemic on populations

437

with different vulnerability profiles.

438
439

Several covariates from our adjusted model were significantly associated COVID-19 cases and

440

deaths. We found that rurality was associated with fewer cases and deaths, consistent with a

441

prior study [19]. In contrast, percentage in poor or fair health was positively associated with

442

both cases and deaths. This supports results from a recent study that found that patients with

443

COVID-19 with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure,

444

chronic kidney disease, and cancer had a higher risk of mortality, compared to patients with

445

COVID-19 without these comorbidities [30]. Moreover, as in prior studies [17, 28], we found

446

that average PM2.5 was positively associated with both cases and deaths. Increased state-level

447

testing was also associated with higher rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths, likely due to

448

heightened surveillance. Contrary to our expectation, we found a significant inverse association

449

between percentage of adult smokers and COVID-19 cases deaths. Our aggregated, county-level

450

findings support recent individual-level studies suggesting that nicotine may have a protective

21
451

effect on COVID-19 [39, 40]. Finally, the number of primary care physicians per capita was

452

associated with lower incidence, but there was no association with deaths.

453
454

More generally, our results suggest a dynamic impact of COVID-19 on socially vulnerable

455

communities. Contrary to expectation, we found that COVID-19 disproportionately impacted

456

less vulnerable counties early in the pandemic, before spreading to more vulnerable areas in

457

May-July. This shift could reflect local and state policy decisions, such as early re-openings in

458

states like Georgia with a high percentage of vulnerable counties [41, 42]. By August, however,

459

the least vulnerable counties began to keep pace with the more vulnerable counties, suggesting

460

that the impact of COVID-19 is not static, but can migrate from less vulnerable counties to more

461

vulnerable ones and back again over time. These results highlight the need for communities,

462

even less vulnerable ones, to continue to monitor the spread of the disease, maintain adequate

463

health care resources, and implement local social distancing measures.

464
465

Our analysis sheds light on the community-level burden of COVID-19 as measured by

466

population-adjusted incidence and death. This information can be used to inform policy

467

decisions related to COVID-19 and future pandemics. For example, our model can be used to

468

detect county-specific spikes, plateaus, and troughs that reflect outbreaks at nursing homes or

469

correctional facilities, as well as the impact of in policy changes, such as stay at home orders and

470

statewide re-openings of public spaces and local businesses, or the return to schools and

471

universities. Moreover, the model provides for accurate prediction of COVID-19 trends for

472

individual counties, allowing health officials to target intervention. By monitoring changes in

473

temporal trends, local policymakers can mobilize resources to minimize imminent outbreaks.

22
474
475

There are also limitations to this analysis. First, our analysis is largely descriptive with the goal

476

of generating hypotheses to inform policy and guide future research. For example, future studies

477

might review the policy actions that gave rise to the crossover effects we observed early and late

478

in the pandemic for several of the SVI themes. Second, we used county-level SVI data from

479

2018. It is possible that social vulnerability factors may have changed between 2018 and 2020,

480

but we used the most recent SVI data available from CDC. Third, we downloaded several of the

481

adjustment variables from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation’s 2019 County Health

482

Rankings & Roadmaps database, which may not be the most current source for variables such as

483

PM2.5. Fourth, it was challenging to model deaths because most counties reported no deaths on

484

any given day. Future studies could employ zero-inflated models to better account for this aspect

485

of the data [43-45]. Future work could also examine temporal trends in locations of correctional

486

facilities, long-term care facilities, nursing homes, Indian reservations and Tribal lands, and other

487

places with high rates of infection [46-49]. Finally, we examined trends in the US only; future

488

work might replicate our study in developing countries or those with emerging outbreaks.

489
490

Examining the impact of COVID-19 on vulnerable communities in the US is of growing

491

importance [15, 50]. Mounting evidence suggests that social determinants of health and

492

community contextual factors contribute to disparities in both COVID-19 incident cases and

493

deaths [2, 3, 6, 51]. It is therefore critically important to monitor and protect vulnerable

494

populations as the pandemic continues to unfold.
