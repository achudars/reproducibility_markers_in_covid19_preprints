Abstract

46

Background

47

Viral shedding patterns and its correlation with the immune responses of mildly symptomatic COVID-19

48

patients are still poorly characterized.

49

Methods:

50

We enrolled the first five COVID-19 patients quarantined in our institution; none received

51

immunomodulatory treatment. We monitored shedding of viral RNA and infectious virus by RT-PCR and

52

cell culture from the upper respiratory tract, and characterized the kinetics of systemic innate and adaptive

53

immune responses.

54

Results

55

Despite mild clinical disease, high viral loads and shedding of infectious virus were observed from the

56

respiratory tract, with isolation of infectious virus and prolonged positivity by PCR up to day 7 and 19 post

57

onset of symptoms, respectively. Robust innate responses characterized by an increase in activated

58

CD14+CD16+ monocytes and cytokine responses were observed as early as 2 days after symptoms onset.

59

Cellular and humoral SARS-CoV-2 specific adaptive responses were detectable in all patients.

60

Conclusion

61

Infectious virus shedding was limited to the first week of symptom onset in mild cases. A strong innate

62

response, characterized by the mobilization of activated monocytes during the first days of infection, as well

63

as SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies were detectable, even in patients with mild disease.

Introduction

68

As of 18th June 2020, more than 8 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported worldwide, with

69

450,000 deaths [2]. While the first reports mainly described patients presenting with severe pneumonia

70

[3], the spectrum of disease is wide, with more than 80% of infected individuals displaying moderate, mild

71

or even no symptoms [4, 5].

72

Studies to date have focused on hospitalized patients with severe or critical disease. In those patients,

73

peak viral load in the upper respiratory tract occurs during the second week post onset of symptoms

74

(POS), while viral clearance is achieved after 10 days in more than 90% of patients with mild disease [6].

75

Elevated cytokine levels, including IL-6 and IP-10, increased CRP and profound T-cell lymphopenia

76

signal disease worsening [7-10]. This dysregulated inflammatory response is thought to result from an

77

initial impairment of interferon production and thus reduced early viral control. Several reports have

78

suggested that SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers are higher in patients with more severe disease [3, 11].

79

Activated SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells have been reported in a few studies [12-14].

80

Yet viral shedding and immune responses in patients with mild COVID-19, the most frequent form of

81

disease, remain poorly characterized. Comprehensive studies investigating viral shedding and immune

82

responses at multiple time points in these patients are lacking. Available descriptions and interpretations

83

of viral behavior and immunological responses in more severely ill patients may be biased by the rapid

84

implementation of immunomodulatory treatments.

85

In our region, the first known case of COVID-19 was identified late February 2020. In line with public

86

health policy early in the outbreak, every confirmed patient was hospitalized, including previously healthy

87

young adults with only mild influenza-like illnesses. Here we report the detailed clinical, virological and

88

immunological characterization of the first five patients assessed at our institution, from the day of

89

diagnosis until convalescence.

Materials and Methods

94

Study population and assessment

95

The first five patients (P1-P5) with COVID-19 confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase

96

chain reaction (rtRT-PCR) and quarantined at HUG were included in this single-center prospective cohort.

97

These patients were screened for SARS-CoV-2 according to the national guidelines in place at the time,

98

which recommended screening travelers returning from Italy and reporting respiratory and/or flulike

99

symptoms. Ethical approval was waived by the local ethics committee (BASEC Req-2020-00143); written

100

informed consent for sample collection and coded data gathering was obtained from each patient. Clinical

101

characteristics were described according to the Severe Emerging Infections clinical protocol of the

102

International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium [15], and disease severity

103

was assessed according to WHO’s classification, where mild illness corresponds to mild symptoms

104

without pneumonia [16]. If the patient agreed, we collected daily nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal,

105

conjunctival, sweat and anal swabs during hospitalization, as well as saliva, urine, and stool samples (see

106

Supplementary methods). Plasma and serum were collected daily during hospitalization and at days 14

107

±2 and 28 ±7 POS following discharge for viral load, antibody and cytokine quantification. Whole blood

108

samples were used to isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to assess cellular responses.

109

Virological assessment

110

Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was performed on all clinical samples. RNA was extracted using the

111

NucliSens eMAG extraction (BioMérieux, France) and quantified with the Charité rtRT-PCR protocol [17]

112

using in vitro transcribed RNA for quantification (European Virus Archive) [18]. Screening for viral co-

113

infections was performed via a large in-house panel of rt(RT-)PCR (see supplement). Viral culture was

114

performed on VeroE6 cells as previously described [19]. Positive isolation of SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed

115

upon presence of cytopathic effect (CPE) and an increase in viral RNA between two consecutive

116

supernatant samples. Nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) from P1 to P4 were tested by high-throughput

117

sequencing (HTS) analysis in the context of SARS-CoV-2 viral genome epidemiological surveillance in

118

Switzerland. Each sample was treated as previously published (see supplement) [20].

120

Measurement of inflammatory markers and blood cell phenotyping

121

Concentrations of 24 markers (see supplement) were measured in cryopreserved plasma using a Luminex

122

assay (Magnetic Luminex assay, R&D Systems) according to the supplier’s instructions. For data points

123

below the detection limit, a value of 50% of the last standard dilution value was assumed.

124

For phenotyping of blood cells, cryopreserved PBMCs were thawed, counted and divided to perform T-cell

125

and monocyte phenotyping. T cells were stained in PBS with LIVE/DEAD™ Stain Kit to exclude dead cells,

126

anti-CD3, -CD4, -CD8, -CD38 and anti-HLA-DR antibodies and were then fixed and permeabilized. Anti-

127

Granzyme B and anti-Ki67 antibodies were used for intracellular staining. For phenotyping of monocytes,

128

cells were stained with FcR binding inhibitor, anti-CD3, -HLA-DR, -CD40, -CD123, -CD169, -CD20, -CCR2,

129

-CD14, -CD16, -CD86, -CD163 and anti-CCR7 antibodies. All data were acquired the same day on a

130

Fortessa II cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using FlowJo software (V10, Tree Star).

131
132

Antibody assays

133

S1 domain-specific IgG and IgA antibody response was measured using a commercially available kit

134

(Euroimmun AG, Lübeck, Germany, #EI 2606-9601 G and EI 2606-9601 A) according to the manufacturer's

135

instructions. To detect antibody against the complete S protein, ELISA plates were coated with a purified

136

trimerized S protein kindly provided by the Ecole polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL). IgG, IgA and

137

IgM antibody titers were determined using a SARS-CoV-2 complete spike (S) protein-based rIFA [21, 22].

138

Neutralizing antibodies were quantified on VeroE6 cells infected with a VSV-based SARS-CoV-2

139

pseudotype expressing a 19-amino-acid, C-terminal truncated spike protein [23-25] (NCBI Reference

140

sequence: NC_045512.2) with serially diluted sera. VeroE6 cells were infected with the virus-serum-

141

mixture, and GFP positive infected cells were counted to assess titers [21]. Details can be found in the

142

supplement.

Clinical characteristics

148

treatment. Their presentation was typical for the majority of COVID-19 patients (sore throat, cough, fever),

149

including P1, who had almost no symptoms. The fifth patient (P5) had a severe illness with bilateral

150

pneumonia; computed tomography (CT) revealed bilateral patchy infiltrates involving each pulmonary lobe

151

and a left posterior basal consolidation 7 days POS (Sup Figure 1). On day 3 of hospitalization, he

152

developed a maculopapular rash on the back and the trunk. His treatment included oxygen support, a 7-

153

day course of antibiotics and lopinavir/ritonavir [26]. He recovered and was discharged after 10 days (day

154

15 POS). All laboratory parameters and in-depth clinical descriptions are available in supplementary tables

155

1-6.

156
157

Viral shedding patterns

158

SARS-CoV-2 was detected by rtRT-PCR in both the oropharyngeal (OPS) and nasopharyngeal swabs

159

(NPS) of each patient, with high viral loads (VL) that declined over time (Figure 1A). Higher VL were

160

detected in NPS than OPS (mean of 1.1E9 viral RNA copies/mL and 4.1E7 copies/mL, respectively) with a

161

peak viral load of 2.5E10 copies/mL for P2, sampled at the day of symptom onset. Lower viral loads in NPS,

162

relative to viral loads of P1-4 on days 6-7 POS, were consistently observed for P5, for whom sampling

163

started only on day 6 POS and covered the second week of illness.

164

Isolation of infectious virus was successful from both NPS and OPS during the first week of illness for the

165

four mild cases, with the last positive virus isolation on day 7 for two patients (P1 and 3). The mean viral

166

load in samples affording successful isolation was 1.2E9 copies/mL; the lowest RNA viral load in a sample

167

from which a positive isolate could be obtained was 1.4E6 copies/mL. No infectious virus could be isolated

168

from any sample from P5.

169

Prolonged RNA detection was observed in three patients, with persistent positive PCR results on days 14

170

(P5), 16 (P1) and 19 (P3) POS, albeit with low viral loads. RNA was also detected by PCR in saliva and

171

stool specimens, with peak VLs of 7.8E6 and 8.6E5 copies/mL, respectively (Sup Figure S2). No virus was

172

detected in other specimen types, and no RNAemia was observed in plasma. No virus isolation was

173

attempted on non-respiratory samples.

174

Full genome sequences from P1-4 were found to cluster with sequences representative of the closest

175

geographically related outbreak at that time, which was in Northern Italy. Molecular epidemiology is

176

consistent with histories of travel to the region shortly before symptom onset for P1, P2 and P3 (Figure S3).

177

A co-infection with adenovirus at a threshold cycle (Ct) value of 36 was detected in P1 on NPS collected at

178

the time of his diagnosis. No other co-infections were detected in P2-P5.

179
180

Kinetics of the innate response

181

An increase in cytokine levels was observed in the first days POS (Figure 1B). Patients with mild symptoms

182

had an increase in IFN-, IFN- and IP-10 around day 2-3, which returned to baseline as symptoms

183

resolved and VL decreased. IL-6, which has been associated with severe disease [27], was slightly more

184

elevated at early time points, as were IL-1Ra and MCP-1. Their levels were similar to the ones observed in

185

P5 when he was oxygen-dependent. Cytokine levels were generally lower in the patient with the mildest

186

symptoms (P1). There were no significant changes in the other cytokines tested, such as TNF, IL-1, IL-

187

2 or IL-8 (not shown). CRP levels were much higher in P5 than in patients with mild disease (Figure 1C),

188

suggesting that innate responses can be efficiently triggered in mild disease.

189

In line with the cytokine data, total numbers of monocytes and neutrophils were higher at early time points

190

relative to later time points (Tables S2-S6). Because monocytes and macrophages have been shown to

191

play an important role in pathogenesis [28], we performed a deeper phenotypic analysis of the circulating

192

monocyte population by flow cytometry; it revealed a population of intermediate monocytes (CD14+ CD16high

193

cells), accounting for the majority of the monocytes detected in peripheral blood at days 2-3 POS (3% to

194

36% of cells from the live gate) (Figure 2A, B). This was seen in all patients irrespective of symptom severity,

195

and decreased for one week POS in all mild patients with sequential samples. Their number was higher in

196

P5 at the two time points tested. Intermediate monocytes expressed the highest levels of activation markers

197

(CD86 and CD40) at 2-3 days POS, which was followed by the peak in the expression of differentiation and

198

migration markers (HLA-DR, CD169, CD163, CCR-7) at one week POS (Figure 2C). In summary, we

199

observed activation of innate responses in all patients, with a clear increase in type I interferon and pro-

200

inflammatory cytokines, as well as significant increase in intermediate monocytes with activation,

201

differentiation and migration patterns.

203

Antibody and cellular responses

204

Serum Ab titers against the spike protein (complete spike and S1 domain) were evaluated by ELISA and

205

rIFA assay (Figure 3). Patients 1, 3, 4 and 5 seroconverted by two weeks POS, including P1 who had very

206

mild and transient symptoms. For P2, no sample was available beyond day 7. P3 had no detectable IgA or

207

IgM, and only low IgG levels (Figure 3A and B). Interestingly, this patient seroconverted only 3 weeks POS

208

in S1-based ELISA (Figure 3A), but had already seroconverted after two weeks in complete S-based assays

209

(rIFA and ELISA) (Figure 3A and B) and in neutralization assays (Figure 3C), indicating a potential role of

210

S2-domain-specific antibodies in virus neutralization. P5 had the highest antibody levels and seroconverted

211

earlier than patients with mild symptoms. Antibodies from all patients except P2, for whom samples from

212

later time points were not available, were able to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 S-pseudotyped viruses; P5 again

213

demonstrated the highest neutralizing antibody titers (Figure 3C). For P1 and P3 a late serum sample was

214

obtained at 69 days POS. He had already showed a decline in IgG, IgA, IgM and neutralizing Ab titers

215

(Figure 3A-C) while antibody levels of P3 declined only minimally (rIFA, S1 ELISA) or stayed the same

216

(NT).

217

We measured the frequency of T lymphocytes and detected a marked reduction in total lymphocytes,

218

particularly of CD8+ T cells, in P5 (Figure 4A, B). We further characterized the T-cell phenotype in terms of

219

activation (expression of markers CD38 and HLA-DR), proliferation (Ki-67) of CD4 and CD8 T cells, and

220

the expression of Granzyme B for CD8 T cells (Figure 4C, D). The highest frequency of activated CD8 T

221

cells was detected in P5, with very few proliferating cells (Figure 4C). Although the frequency of activated

222

CD8 T cells was lower in patients with mild symptoms, activated CD8 T cells expressed Granzyme B in all

223

patients. For CD4 T cells, the frequency of activated cells was higher in P5 (CD38+HLA-DR+ CD4 T cells

224

2.8%) than in healthy individuals (mean 0.49%), and even in patients with mild symptoms (CD38+HLA-DR+

225

CD4 T cells <1.35%). Activated CD4 T cells were proliferating in all infected patients (Figure 4D). Altogether,

226

the detection of activated and proliferative T cells in all patients suggests that even patients with mild

227

disease are able to mount a T-cell-mediated immune response to SARS-CoV-2.

230

We report the kinetics of viral load and immune responses in the first five COVID-19 patients hospitalized

231

in our institution presenting with mild (P1-4) and severe (P5) disease. The most striking finding was a robust

232

innate response in patients with mild symptoms characterized by early activation of monocytes. We also

233

found prolonged viral RNA detection and measurable SARS-CoV-2 specific cellular and Ab responses

234

despite the paucity of symptoms.

235

We documented high VL in the upper respiratory tract at diagnosis and the presence of infectious virus in

236

both NPS and OPS, in samples taken hours POS in patients presenting with mild illness. Similar results

237

have been documented in the pre-symptomatic phase [29] and can partly explain the high transmissibility

238

of COVID-19. In all patients with mild disease, infectious virus could be isolated several days after symptom

239

onset, up to day 7. Notably, symptoms had already waned for 5 days before the last successful isolation of

240

infectious virus P1. We could not isolate SARS-CoV-2 in clinical specimens containing less than 1.4E6 viral

241

RNA copies/ml, in line with other reports [22]. Interestingly, no virus could be isolated from the NPS during

242

the second week of illness, in the patient with the severe disease, possibly indicating antibody-mediated

243

viral neutralization at that time. Except in stools and saliva, viral RNA was observed inconsistently and at

244

low levels in other body fluids. This suggests that these fluids are not a major source of transmission. While

245

patients with mild symptoms tend to have more limited shedding [6], prolonged RNA detection has also

246

been reported by others [30]. In our study, no infectious virus could be retrieved from such samples, arguing

247

for lingering remnant RNA rather than for active replication. While there is a need to confirm these findings

248

in larger cohorts, they provide important information for discharge criteria and public-health decisions

249

regarding isolation. Our data on isolation of infectious virus support most recommendations currently in

250

effect, which advise isolation for at least 10 days POS for infection control, even in patients with very brief

251

symptom durations.

252

Monocytes and macrophages play a critical role in the immunopathology of COVID-19 [28]. An increased

253

number of cytokine-producing CD14+CD16+ monocytes and activated macrophages are seen in the blood

254

and broncho-alveolar lavages of severe patients, respectively [31-33]. Zhou et al showed that increases in

255

activated intermediated monocytes were mainly seen in intensive-care-unit (ICU) patients as opposed to

256

non-ICU patients [34]. An interesting observation is that the rapid and drastic impact of SARS-CoV-2

257

infection on circulating monocytes in patients with very mild symptoms has a profile that is similar to what

10

258

is reported by Zhou and colleagues in ICU patients. The new observation could be due to the fact that our

259

study captured very early responses. The rapid mobilization of monocytes is indicative of a robust local

260

antiviral response. In patients without complications, this early mobilization of monocytes is not sustained

261

and rapidly declines to baseline one-week POS. This monocyte signature is not unique to SARS-CoV-2: it

262

has been described for dengue fever [35, 36] and other viral diseases [10, 37, 38].

263

In our study, all patients with mild symptoms, and with samples available from day 7 POS or later, mounted

264

adaptive immune responses leading to neutralizing Ab. The question of the durability of the response and

265

its quality over time remains open. As observed for P1 but not for P3, Ab titers including neutralizing Abs

266

may rapidly decline in some non- or pauci-symptomatic COVID-19 patients. Experimental studies showed

267

that immunity against reinfection by other human CoVs wanes over a few months, enabling reinfection

268

within the first year after acute disease [39]. Low levels of non-neutralizing Ab may enhance disease

269

severity at time of re-exposure [40], through an Ab-mediated mechanism described for other viruses. This

270

could have important implications for both the clinical severity of repeat exposure and vaccination strategies

271

eliciting more binding than neutralizing antibodies [41].

272

Our study has limitations. Although we were able to perform a comprehensive analysis of the immune

273

response and viral shedding, the description is limited to five patients (with early time points missing for P5,

274

and later time points missing for P2) and our interpretation of the association between viral load, innate and

275

adaptive responses in patients with mild COVID-19 requires confirmation with a larger sample size. Finally,

276

we were unable to follow all patients for late time points and cannot reach a conclusion about the durability

277

of SARS-CoV-2 specific immunity according to disease pattern.

Conclusion

280

We provide a comprehensive immunological and virological profile of the first five patients diagnosed in our

281

institution. Four had only mild and/or very transient symptoms and none received immunomodulatory

282

treatments. Importantly we found that in both patients with mild symptoms and prolonged high viral loads,

283

as well as one with severe disease, no virus could be isolated after the first week of illness.

284

Even in patients with mild symptoms, we found a robust innate response characterized by the mobilization

285

of activated monocytes in the first days of infection, associated with high viral loads and the induction of

We collected daily nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, conjunctival, sweat and anal swabs as well as saliva,

529

urine and stool samples if the patient agreed, using 3mL universal transport medium tubes (Copan,

530

Brescia, Italy). Urine and stools were collected daily (when available) in plastic tubes without additives.

531

Plasma and serum were collected in EDTA and in SST II plastic tubes, daily during hospitalization and at

532

days 14 +/- 2 and 28 +/- 7 post onset of symptoms (POS) following discharge for viral load, antibody (Ab)

533

and cytokine quantification. Cell-preparation tubes (CPT) with sodium citrate were used for collection of

534

whole blood and separation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to assess cellular responses.

Assessment of infectious viruses

536

VeroE6 cells were seeded at a density of 8x104 cells/well in a 24-well plate and inoculated with 200 μl of

537

viral transport medium the following day. Cells were inoculated for 1h at 37°C, then inoculum was

538

removed, cells were washed 1x with PBS and then regular cell growth medium containing 10% FCS was

539

added. Cells were observed on days 2, 4, and 6 for the presence of CPE by light microscopy.

540

Supernatant was harvested upon the first observation of a CPE, or, if no CPE was observed, at the end of

541

the experiment on day 6.

with TRIzol (Invitrogen,Carlsbad, CA, USA) and resuspended in 10 μl of RNAse-free water. Ribosomal

553

RNA was removed using the Ribo-Zero Gold depletion kit (Illumina, San Diego, US). Thereafter, libraries

554

were generated using the TruSeq total RNA preparation protocol (Illumina) with dual indexing and loaded

555

on the HiSeq 4000 platform (Illumina) using the 2x100-bp protocol. Raw data were analysed as follows:

556

duplicate reads were removed using cd-hit (v4.6.8). Then reads were then trimmed to remove low-quality

557

and adapter sequences using Trimmomatic (v0.33). Next reads were mapped against the reference

578

We coated 37.5ng/well of a purified trimerized S protein diluted in 0.1M sodium carbonate buffer pH 9.6

579

O/N at 4°C. Plates were blocked (5% milk PBS-T) and 100 ul of 2-fold serially diluted sera (range 100-

580

12,800) were applied to wells with and without antigen. After incubation (1h at 37°C) and washing (3x 1min

581

with PBS-T) 100ul HRP-conjugated anti-human IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch, #109-036-098) diluted

582

1:16,000 was added. After incubation plates were washed and 100ul of TMB substrate (Invitrogen) was

583

added for 10min. Reaction was stopped by 100ul of 1N HCl and plates were read at 450nm. OD450 values

584

of blank wells were subtracted from values of antigen containing wells for each serum and each dilution.

585

The cut-off to determine the ELISA titer was set at 0.29 OD450, just before OD values reach the plateau

586

phase.

rIFA assay

589

Briefly, pCG1 vector expressing SARS-CoV-2 S protein (kindly provided by M. Hoffmann and S. Pöhlmann,

590

DPZ Göttingen) was transfected into Vero B4 cells using Fugene HD (Promega #E2311), spotted on

591

multitest microscopy slides (DUNN Labortechnik GmbH #40-412-05) and fixed with ice-cold

592

Acetone/Methanol (1:1). To perform the rIFA sera were inactivated for 30min at 56°C. To remove IgG

593

antibodies for determination of IgM antibody titres, sera were treated with Eurosorb reagent (Euroimmun

594

AG #1270-0145). Slides were rehydrated in PBS-T for 5min and blocked (5% milk PBS-T) for 30min at RT.

595

Sera were diluted using a starting dilution of 1:40 for IgG/IgA and 1:10 for IgM and 30μl were applied to

596

each spot. After incubation (1h, 37°C) slides were washed (3x1min, PBS-T) and 25μl of Alexa488-

597

conjugated goat anti-human-IgG, -IgM. or -IgA antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch #109-036-098, #, #)

598

diluted 1:200 in PBS was applied. After incubation (37°C, 45min), slides were washed as before and briefly

599

rinsed with dH2O before mounting with glycerol.

Quantification of neutralizing antibodies

602

VeroE6 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 2 x 104 cells per well and grown into confluent monolayer

603

overnight. Sera from patients were inactivated at 56°C for 30 minutes and diluted from 1:5 to 1:1280 in

604

DMEM 2% FBS. VSV-based SARS-CoV-2 pseudotypes (3, 4) expressing a 19 amino acids C-terminal

605

truncated spike protein (5) (NCBI Reference sequence: NC_045512.2) were diluted in DMEM 2% FCS in

order to have MOI=0.01 per well and added on top of serum dilutions (final serum dilutions obtained were

607

from 1:10 to 1:2560). The virus-serum mix was incubated at 37°C, for 2h. Vero E6 were then infected with

608

100µl of virus-serum mixtures. After incubation at 37°C for 1.5h, cells were washed once with 1X PBS and

609

DMEM 10% FBS was added. After 16-20h of incubation at 37°C, 5% CO2 cells were fixed with 4%

610

formaldehyde solution for 15min at 37°C and nuclei stained with 1µg/ml DAPI solution. GFP positive

611

infected cells were counted with ImageXpress® Micro Widefield High Content Screening System (Molecular

612

Devices) and data analyzed with MetaXpress 5.1.0.41 software.
