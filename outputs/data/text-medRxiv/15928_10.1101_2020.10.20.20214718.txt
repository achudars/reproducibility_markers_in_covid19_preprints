28

symptomatic than COVID-19 and associated with body ache, headache and retro-orbital

29

pain, while COVID-19 was found associated with contact, anosmia, delayed presentation and

Abstract

32

Background. As coronavirus (COVID-19) is spreading globally, several countries are handling

33

dengue epidemics. As both infections are deemed to share similarities at presentation, it

34

would be useful to distinguish COVID-19 from dengue in the context of co-epidemics. In this

35

aim, we performed a cohort study to identify predictors of both infections.

36

Methods. All the subjects suspected of COVID-19 between March 23 and May 10, 2020,

37

were screened for COVID-19 within the testing center of the University hospital of Saint-

38

Pierre, Reunion island. The screening consisted in a questionnaire surveyed in face-to-face, a

39

nasopharyngeal swab specimen for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2

40

(SARS-CoV-2) reverse transcription polymerase chain-reaction and a rapid diagnostic

41

orientation test for dengue. Factors independently associated with COVID-19 or with dengue

42

were sought using multinomial logistic regression models, taking other febrile illnesses (OFIs)

43

as controls.

44

Results. Over a two-month study period, we identified among 80 COVID-19, 60 non-severe

45

dengue and 872 OFIs cases, delayed presentation (>3 days) since symptom onset (Odds ratio

46

1.89, 95% confidence interval 1.4-3.40), contact with a COVID-19 positive case (OR 3.81,

47

95%CI 2.12-6.82) and anosmia (OR 8.27, 95%CI 4.39-15.54) as independent predictors of

48

COVID-19, body ache (OR 6.83, 95%CI 2.84-16.41), headache (OR 5.38, 95%CI 1.81-15.94)

49

and retro-orbital pain (OR 7.45, 95%CI 3.17-17.50) as independent predictors of dengue,

50

while smoking was less likely observed with COVID-19 (OR 0.27, 95%CI 0.10-0.74).

51

Conclusions. Although prone to potential biases, these data suggest that non-severe dengue

52

may be more symptomatic than COVID-19 in a co-epidemic setting with higher dengue

53

attack rates.

55

Background

56

During the past decades, there have been growing concerns about the risks of overlapping

57

epidemics and co-infections with emergent viruses, especially with arboviruses that can

58

share the same Aedes mosquito vector [1,2]. Yet, surprisingly, since the 2009 flu pandemic,

59

the differential diagnosis between influenza and dengue has been scarcely investigated [3].

60

As Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is spreading

61

globally, several countries are handling dengue epidemics, with fear for their healthcare

62

systems and most vulnerable populations [4]. Thus, differentiate between the two diagnoses

63

may be challenging and lead to misdiagnosis, which may occasion both delays in treatment

64

and preventable deaths, but also inadequate isolation measures with the potential to trigger

65

outbreaks, especially in the healthcare setting [4].

66

On Reunion island, a French overseas department located in the Indian ocean, best

67

known to have host one of the largest chikungunya outbreaks and harbor a highly comorbid

68

population [5,6], dengue virus (DENV) is circulating since 2004 under an endemo-epidemic

69

pattern with outbreaks usually peaking between March and May, and increases with yearly

70

upsurges since 2015 [7]. In 2020, the first cases of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) were

71

detected on the island by March 11, six days before the French authorities decree the

72

lockdown.

73

In this context, a new case of COVID-19 and dengue co-infection was reported [8].

74

Anticipating that the differential diagnosis between the two infections would be challenging,

75

we designated a retrospective cohort study aimed at identifying the clinical and

76

epidemiological profiles of SARS-CoV-2 and DENV infections to guide their management and

77

mitigate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic surge on the island.

The full details of the methods can be found in the Supplementary Methodological appendix.

80

Study design and setting

81

We conducted a retrospective cohort study between March 23 and May 10, 2020, on all

82

subjects screened for the CO-VID-19 within the UDACS (Unité de Dépistage Ambulatoire du

83

COVID-19 Sud) of Saint-Pierre, one of the two SARS-CoV-2 testing centers of the Centre

84

Hospitalier Universitaire Réunion (CHU). When SARS-CoV-2 emerged on the island, the

85

dengue epidemic was already burgeoning, the UDACS was placed in the second line of the

86

reception system for COVID-19 patients, the frontline being the emergency units and the

87

dedicated hospital for COVID-19 patients, the CHU Félix Guyon, located in Saint-Denis,

88

whereby are the prefecture and the international airport.

89

Ethics statement

90

Outpatients presenting consecutively at the SARS-CoV-2 testing center were informed of the

91

study orally and by means of an information sheet. People who expressed no opposition

92

were asked to answer a questionnaire and surveyed in face-to-face by a nurse, in accordance

93

to the French legislation on bioethics for retrospective researches. Patient’s medical records

94

were retrospectively reviewed, and de-identified data were collected in standardized forms

95

according the MR-004 procedure of the Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des

96

Libertés (the French information protection commission). The ethical character of this study

97

on previously collected data was approved by the Scientific Committee for COVID-19

98

research of the CHU Réunion and de-identified data were registered on the Health Data Hub.

99

Data collection

102

symptoms and treatment. Temperature, pulse rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation

103

(SpO2) were measured upon the consultation, as well as the presence of cough and anxiety.

104

Diagnostic procedures

105

All the attendees were screened for SARS-CoV-2 using a nasopharyngeal swab inserted and

106

held in one nostril for about twenty seconds [9]. The sample was processed for a SARS-CoV-2

107

reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using the Allplex 2019-nCovTM

108

assay (Seegene, Seoul, Republic of Korea) or an in-house kit (CNR Pasteur), targeting N, RdRP

109

and E genes, or N and IP2/IP4 targets of RdRP, respectively. In addition, each patient

110

suspected of dengue was tested for NS1 antigen using an OnSiteTM Duo dengue Ag-IgG-IgM

111

rapid diagnostic test (CTK Biotech, San Diego, CA, USA) and if negative further explored with

112

a DENV RT-PCR or a dengue serology according to the timing of symptoms. People without

113

symptoms were excluded from the study. Patients requiring hospitalization were transferred

114

promptly from the UDACS to the COVID-19 units.

115

Statistical analysis

116

Given the research purpose, co-infections at clinical presentation were excluded from the

117

analysis. Proportions between non COVID-19 and non-dengue other febrile illnesses (OFIs),

118

COVID-19 and dengue subjects were compared using Chi square or Fisher exact tests, as

119

appropriate. Univariable and multivariable multinomial logistic regression models were

120

fitted within Stata14® (College Station, Texas, USA) to identify independent predictors of

121

COVID-19 and dengue, taking OFIs as controls. For all these analyses, observations with

122

missing data were ruled out and a P-value less than 0.05 was considered as statistically

123

significant.

Results

125

Between March 23 and May 10, 2020, 1,715 subjects presented at the UDACS for screening

126

or diagnosis purposes. Of these, 370 incoming patients were screened opportunistically for

127

COVID-19 as part of an expanded screening week targeting admissions to our hospital (75%

128

asymptomatic, all tested negative), and 332 were fully asymptomatic subjects (44% with the

129

notion of a COVID-19 contact, of whom 6 tested positive; 53% healthcare workers, of whom

130

2 tested positive; 5 tested positive without notion of COVID-19 contact nor an occupational

131

exposure). Both of these populations were excluded from the study, leaving 1,013

132

outpatients eligible to the analysis. The study population is shown in Figure 1.

133

The hospitalization rates for the COVID-19 and dengue patients were higher than those

134

observed for the patients affected by OFIs (16.7% and 13.1%, respectively versus 1.8%, P

135

<0.001). Among 40 inpatients, 2 patients out of 22 met the criteria for COVID-19 pneumonia

136

and 6 out of 8 had dengue warning signs but none severe dengue at clinical presentation. No

137

COVID-19 dengue co-infection was observed at clinical presentation.

138

COVID-19 patients presented later in their evolution compared to the subjects affected

139

by dengue or OFIs (time elapsed since symptom onset, 7.5 days versus 4.2 days or 6.3 days,

140

P<0.001). The average levels of temperature, pulse rate, respiratory rate and spO2 did not

141

differ between the three groups of patients.

142

Univariable analysis proposed contact with a COVID-19+ case, recent return from

143

travel abroad (<15 d), fever, ageusia, anosmia (loss of smell) and delayed presentation (>3 d)

144

145

protective factor against COVID-19, previous episode of dengue, fever, body ache (i.e.,

146

muscle pain, backache with tightness/stiffness), ageusia, gut symptoms (i.e., nausea,

147

vomiting, dyspepsia, eructation or abdominal pain), metallic taste, fatigue, headache and

of OFIs (Table 1).

A sensitivity analysis restricted to the patients with COVID-19 or with dengue

confirmed anosmia, URTI symptoms and delayed presentation (>3 d) on the one hand, body

ache, fatigue, headache, retro-orbital pain and rapid presentation (≤ 3 d) on the other hand,

160

as discriminating factors between the two infections (Supplementary Table 2).

Discussion

162

COVID-19 and dengue are two clinically similar entities, especially within the first 24 to 48

163

hours from symptom onset [10]. In a context of co-epidemics, our cohort study, conducted

164

within a SARS-CoV-2 testing center upon mild to moderate cases of COVID-19 and non-

165

severe cases of dengue identified several key distinctive features for both infections. Thus,

166

among the clinically discriminant variables at presentation, retro-orbital pain, body ache and

167

headache were strong predictors of dengue while anosmia was the only predictor of COVID-

168

19 and URTI symptoms were indicative of OFIs. To a lesser extent, gut symptoms other than

169

diarrhea, dysgeusia and fatigue were suggestive of dengue whereas cough referred to

170

another diagnosis (OFIs or COVID-19), albeit found in nearly a third of dengue. Thus, among

171

the epidemiological variables, the contact with a COVID+ case and a delayed presentation

172

beyond three days of symptom onset were predictive of COVID-19, a rapid presentation

173

within three days was suggestive of dengue, while active smoking was less likely observed

174

with COVID-19 or associated with OFIs. These elements are summarized in the Supplemental

175

Figure 1.

176

Our findings reveal several unexpected differences at the presentation to hospital

177

between COVID-19 or dengue as compared to OFIs, and between COVID-19 and dengue,

178

dengue appearing at first glance more symptomatic and with a more abrupt onset than

179

COVID-19 or OFis in the setting of a SARS-CoV-2 testing center.

180

These discrepancies might reflect first a selection bias, the more symptomatic cases

181

of both infections having been referred primarily to the emergency units, these redirecting

182

the COVID-19 cases towards the Saint-Denis referral hospital for quarantine purpose. This

183

could be arguably deduced from weighing on the inverse probability of hospitalization,

184

which was on average 2.5-fold higher than from the UDACS, all through the study period.

185

Doing so abrogates, for instances, the effects of a delayed presentation and the protection

186

of active smoking for the prediction of COVID-19 (data not shown). Together with the fact

187

that the dengue epidemic was more active in the south, this fuels the idea that time to

188

presentation in our study partly stemmed from differences in recruitment driven both by the

189

organization and access to care. Importantly, weighing the analysis strengthened also the

190

odds ratios of a contact with a COVID-19+ case for the same, as well as those of headache

191

and retro-orbital pain for the prediction of dengue. These elements suggest that this

192

putative selection bias was more pronounced on epidemiological than on clinical variables.

193

Second, our results might also be affected by a misclassification bias, which may arise

194

from the poor sensitivity of both rapid NS1 antigen and SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. Consistent with

195

this, are the high percentages of cough and URTI symptoms in dengue cases, for instances.

196

This being said, our findings are also in agreement with the literature.

197

First, the fact that dengue was more symptomatic than COVID-19 fulfills both the

198

concept of "force infection" and the trade-off model according to which, the time spent in

199

the susceptible group of an infectious disease is inversely correlated to its incidence [11],

200

and the virulence (e.g., ability to cause illness, lethality) grows with the transmission rate

201

until it reaches a plateau [12]. Consistent with these assumptions, according to Santé

202

Publique France reports, the attack rate observed over the study period was 22-fold higher

203

for dengue (≈905 per 100.000 inhabitants) than for COVID-19 (≈41 per 100.000 inhabitants).

204

This was explained by the recent introduction of DENV-1 serotype (March 2019)

205

complicating five years of DENV-2 circulation [7], cases of secondary dengue, the

206

effectiveness of the lockdown to slow the progression of COVID-19 and the fact that SARS-

207

CoV-2 impacted at that time mainly "healthy" individuals (travelers and their relatives). In

208

this framework, the relevance of body ache, headache and retro-orbital pain at presentation

209

for the differential diagnosis between COVID-19 and dengue accounts for the involvement of

210

dengue in the general and digestive spheres, as proposed by Nacher et al. in a recent

211

opinion paper, COVID-19 being more pronounced in the respiratory sphere [10].

212

Interestingly, we also found one COVID-19+ case who was tested negative for dengue

213

suffering retro-orbital pain, as previously reported in Taiwan [13].

214

Second, our cohort study supports the high positive predictive values and specificities

215

of the contact with a COVID-19+ case and anosmia for the diagnostic of COVID-19, which is

216

congruent with risk prediction models developed for healthcare workers in Italy [14] and

217

findings from the Coranosmia cohort study in France [15], respectively.

218

Together with the abovementioned putative selection bias, the delayed presentation

219

to hospital of COVID-19 cases, as compared to dengue, might also illustrate the mild (“pauci-

220

symptomatic”) character of COVID-19 illness during the first pandemic surge on Reunion

221

island, as well as some consecutive lags in contact tracing. Overall, individuals who did not

222

feel or only slightly sick with COVID-19 might have not feel the need to be tested. However,

223

this hypothesis does not stand the absence of clear association between the proportions of

224

asymptomatic infections and time to presentation (i.e., with 3-fold more asymptomatic

225

cases, OFIs cases presented faster than COVID-19 cases; data not shown).

226

Interestingly, active smoking was less likely observed with COVID-19 as compared to

227

OFis or dengue, but this effect was not robust as suggested above. Moreover, it was not

228

replicated for asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections, nor it was among COVID-19+ cases for

229

the protection against illness (data not shown). Notwithstanding, this result fuels the

230

smoker's paradox according to which active smokers were underreported among the

231

patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in several countries [16].

232

In conclusion, our cohort study identified several factors distinguishing non severe

233

dengue from COVID-19 at clinical presentation in a context of recent dengue endemicity and

234

first introduction of SARS-CoV-2. Although prone to potential biases, these data suggest that

235

non severe dengue may be more symptomatic than COVID-19 in a co-epidemic setting with

236

higher dengue attack rates, a pattern that might also result from different forces of infection

237

(lesser exposure to SARS-CoV-2 than to DENV). Whether these findings may serve other

238

regions facing co-epidemics, deserves more investigations, development and validation of

239

more accurate diagnostic tools.
