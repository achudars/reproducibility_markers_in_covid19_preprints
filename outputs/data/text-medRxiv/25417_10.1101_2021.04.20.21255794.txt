Abstract
Background
Vaccination hesitancy is a serious threat to achieve herd immunity in a global and rapidly
changing pandemic situation. Health care workers play a key role in the treatment of patients
with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and in promoting vaccination in the general
population. The aim of the study was to provide data on COVID-19 vaccination acceptance and
barriers among healthcare workers in Germany to support health policymakers choosing
specific vaccination campaign strategies.
Methods
An online survey was conducted among health care workers in Germany in February 2021. The
survey included 55 items on demographics, previous vaccination behavior, trust in vaccines,
physicians, pharma industry, and health politics as well as fear of adverse effects, assumptions
on disease consequences, knowledge about vaccines, information seeking behavior and a short
COVID-19 vaccine knowledge test.
Results
A total of 4500 surveys could be analyzed. The overall vaccination acceptance was 91.7%. The
age group ≤20 years showed the lowest vaccination acceptance of all age groups. Regarding
professional groups, residents showed the highest vaccination acceptance. Main factors for
vaccination hesitancy were lack of trust in authorities and pharmaceutical companies. Personal
and professional environment influenced the attitude towards a vaccination too. Participants
with vaccination hesitancy were more likely to obtain information about COVID-19 vaccines via
messenger services or online video platforms and underperformed in the knowledge test.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we found a high acceptance rate amongst German health care workers.
Furthermore, several factors associated with vaccination hesitancy were identified which could
be targeted in vaccination campaigns.
Keywords: COVID-19, vaccine, vaccination, vaccination hesitancy, vaccine refusal, vaccination

Introduction
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is one of the biggest healthcare
challenges in history. As effective treatment options are lacking and several vaccines are
already available, it has been estimated that a pandemic spread could be stopped if more than
67% of the population acquire immunity by either vaccination or infection, i.e. if herd immunity
has developed (1). Allowing uncontrolled infection to achieve this immunity would cause
increased morbidity and mortality and unjustifiable strain on the health system (2). This became
apparent during the first and second waves of the pandemic, when even advanced health care
systems were overrun by the surge of severely ill patients. Furthermore, even mild to moderate
COVID-19 infections might lead to long-term health consequences (3) and individual financial
losses (4). Therefore, large scale population-wide vaccination programs are the preferred
approach to stop the pandemic and have been started worldwide. However, if there is a lack of
a sufficient vaccine acceptance among the population herd immunity cannot be achieved.
Vaccine hesitancy is a global barrier to this strategy and rated among the top ten threats
worldwide (5, 6).
Consequently, even if governments can provide sufficient vaccine supply to vaccinate the total
population (which already is a major challenge), herd immunity cannot be achieved if
pronounced vaccine hesitancy is present (7). Health care workers (HCW) serve as important
multiplier and advisor role in vaccination programs, as they are required to provide information
and thus build confidence. Additionally, HCWs who are at risk of acquiring infections from their
patients, are often regarded as the source of nosocomial infections with vaccine preventable
diseases (8) - a circumstance that appears particularly threatening during the COVID-19
pandemic. In a representative national survey in Germany, the reported acceptance to receive a
COVID-19 vaccination was only 66% in the general population (having risen from 50% in
December 2020) and slightly lower with 64% in a small subset of HCW (9), Table 1. Recent,
partially not yet peer-reviewed surveys of HCW have shown vaccine acceptance rates between
31% and 86% (10-24) (Table 1). Yet, these findings were the basis for negative media
coverage in the German and international press shedding a picture of vaccine hesitancy among
HCW. To design specific vaccination campaigns, addressing the concerns of potential vaccine
candidates in the health care system, public health stakeholders need sufficient data reflecting
the reasons for hesitancy. In the context of an ongoing pandemic caused by a new infectious
disease, previous findings on vaccine hesitancy for classical vector-based vaccines such as
annual influenza vaccines might not be completely applicable to COVID-19 vaccines. This is
even more understandable since a new technology of mRNA-based vaccines are used for the

first time. The individual decision to receive a COVID-19 vaccination is multifactorial, based
among others on a individually perceived health risk, experiences with past vaccinations and
sociodemographic factors (25).
The main goals of this survey in HCW were A) to provide current numbers of HCW COVID-19
vaccination acceptance in Germany, B) to identify vaccination barriers by assessing vaccine
hesitancy on different scales. By identifying concerns and reasons for vaccination hesitancy, we
aim to provide a data foundation for health stakeholders designing target group specific
vaccination campaigns.

Materials and Methods
In order to build tailored evidence syntheses on COVID-19 research for German health care
professionals, politicians, stakeholders and laity, CEOsys (COVID-19 evidence ecosystem,
www.covid-evidenz.de),(26) a research group within the network of German university hospitals
(NUM, Netzwerk Universitätsmedizin) was launched in 2020. The network is funded by the
German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Bundesministerium für Bildung und
Forschung, BMBF). This study was conducted as part of the evaluation of informational needs.
The study adheres to the declaration of Helsinki. Approval by the local ethics committee of the
medical faculty of Technical University of Munich (41/21 S), data protection officer, hospital
board and staff counsel were obtained. Every participant gave informed consent by clicking a
checkbox after the information on the study and data protection prior to the survey. This crosssectional study is based on an online survey conducted from 02/02/2021 to 02/28/2021 in
German language. At that point of time, the vaccines Comirnaty® by BioNTech/Pfizer and
Vaxzevria®, the vaccine by Astra Zeneca had been in use in Germany. The vaccination
campaign had been started approximately one month before the start of this survey.
The link to this voluntary open online survey was sent to a total of 3924 e-mail addresses of
nursing homes, medical practices, ambulance services, medical universities, hospitals,
ambulatory care services and medical societies across Germany. In the invitation email, it was
asked to forward the link within the respective institution or society. No further advertising was
carried out by the authors. There were no incentives offered for taking part in the survey. The
survey was carried out on the online platform SoSci Survey (27). The items were not
randomized. To guarantee full anonymity, no cookies to identify unique users, no IP checks or
logfile analyses were performed and users were not asked for registration. There was no review
step for the respondents.
To formulate questions, the GESIS (Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences) survey guidelines
for question wording were considered (28). The recommendations of the Working Group on

Vaccine Hesitancy Determinants Matrix (30) were applied. The matrix included contextual
influences, individual and group influences as well as vaccine/vaccination-specific issues. In
addition, the 5C-model by Betsch et al. was taken into account when constructing the questions
(31). Furthermore, questions were adapted from the surveys by Larson et al. (32). Also,
questions addressing specific previous results on vaccine hesitancy were included (33). The
questions were then discussed in detail with a sociologist (BL). Survey pretest was performed
by several members of the authors' departments as well as of the CEOsys network. The
questions were then revised according to their comments. Testers reported a completion time of
approximately ten minutes, which was included in the study information.
We followed the Checklist for Reporting Results of Internet E-Surveys (CHERRIES) (29)
(Supplemental Table 1).
The survey contained 55 items (12 screens). Demographic data, previous vaccination behavior,
trust in vaccines / physicians / pharma industry and health politics as well as fear of adverse
effects, assumptions on the consequences of the disease, knowledge about vaccines and
information seeking behavior of the participants were queried. Four items on the participants’
knowledge on COVID-19 vaccinations were included as well. The full questionnaire can be
found in Supplemental Table 2. In professional groups and work settings, free text comments
(if “other” was chosen) were evaluated and participants were assigned to professional groups
where possible. The categories “dental assisting personnel”, “dentist” and “science” were built
from the free text comments. For statistical analysis, the professional group “other nonphysician medical staff” was built from the categories “non-examined nurse”, “medical
specialist”, “non-physician staff in the rescue service” and “trainee”. The group “physicians with
specialist / personnel responsibility” was built from the groups “specialized physician”,
“consultant physician” and “chief physician”. In the item "Sources of information," a maximum of
five answer options could be selected to identify the media that are essential to the participant.
Questionnaires which had not been completed (i.e., which had been abandoned),
questionnaires without informed consent and questionnaires with missing information on
vaccination willingness / hesitancy were excluded from statistical analyses. In several
questions, the answer option "no answer" was given to comply with data protection guidelines
on the one hand and to avoid abandoning of the questionnaire on the other.
Statistical analyses
Data are presented as absolute and relative frequencies. Number of missing values (”no
answer”) for all items are presented in the Supplement. For group comparisons odds ratios with
corresponding 95% confidence intervals are presented and/or chi-square tests were performed.

All tests were performed two-sided and a significance level of 5% was used. Due to the
exploratory nature of the study no adjustment for multiple testing was considered. As the survey
was most likely answered in work settings, i.e. completion might have been interrupted (leading
to longer answer times or early termination and restart of the survey with shorter response
times), time stamps were not analyzed.
Unless otherwise specified, participants were summarized to be “willing / accepting” if they
wanted to get or had already been vaccinated. Similarly, participants who indicated they were
undecided, or unwilling were summarized as hesitant. German regions were defined according
to the classification used by the Robert Koch Institute (34). Statistical analysis was performed
using R, version 4.0.4 (R Foundation for statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) and its libraries
“epitools”, “arsenal”, “sf” and “mapplots”.

Results
Study population
A total of 5,448 participants started the online survey. 948 data sets had to be excluded due to
incompleteness or missing consent. Finally, the dataset consisted of 4,500 completed surveys
for analysis (Figure 1). The number of female participants was 2,610 (58.0%). The largest
participant groups were physicians with specialist / personnel responsibilities (29.5%), medical
students (29.2%), and certified nurses (10.4%). Main work settings were maximum care
hospitals / university hospitals (42.6%), hospitals of other care levels (18.0%), and medical
practices / medical care centers (20.2%). Of all participants, 35.2% were from southern, 28.1%
from northern, 26.0% from western, and 8.4% from eastern Germany (Table 2).
The overall vaccination acceptance was 91.7% (4125 / 4500), 167 (3.7%) participants reported
to be undecided, 208 (4.6%) reported that they do not want to get vaccinated against COVID19. Of those accepting a COVID-19 vaccination, 2,024 (49.1%) had already received at least
one COVID-19 vaccination dose. No difference in vaccination acceptance was observed
between sexes (Table 2). Within German regions, the vaccination acceptance ranged from
89.4% (northern Germany) to 93.2% (southern Germany, Figure 2). Participants from
outpatient nursing services (10 / 45, 22.2% unwilling or undecided) and medical practices /
medical care centers (127 / 908, 14.0%) were less likely to accept a COVID-19 vaccination
compared to participants from other work settings (Table 2, Figure 3). Vaccination acceptance
varied significantly between age groups (p=0.039). The age group ≤20 years showed the lowest
vaccination acceptance. (Table 2, Figure 3).

Personal attitudes and vaccination experience
Overall, most participants rather or fully agreed that they trust both vaccines in general (4,199,
93.3%) and COVID-19 vaccines (3639, 80.9%). Most respondents rather or fully agreed that
vaccines in general (4,330, 96.2%) and COVID-19 vaccines (3961, 88.0%) are effective.
Additionally, most of the respondents fully or rather claimed to keep their vaccinations up to
date (4150, 92.2%).
Lack of trust in regulatory authorities in general (115 / 198 [58.1%] of participants who totally
disagreed or rather disagreed reported to be unwilling to get vaccinated or to be undecided
versus 172 / 4,041 [4.3%] of those who rather agreed or totally agreed, p<0.001) and
specifically in COVID-19 vaccine approval (181 / 322 [56.2%] vs. 85 / 3,763 [2.3%], p<0.001),
as well as in German health politics (206 / 762 [27.0%] vs. 85 / 2,746 [3.1%], p<0.001), and
physicians (51 / 164 [31.1%] vs. 224 / 3,740 [6.0%], p<0.001) were significantly associated with
vaccine hesitancy (odds ratios for comparison with the reference group of those who neither
agree nor disagree are illustrated in Figure 5A, absolute and relative frequencies for all
categories are presented in Supplemental Table 3, odds ratios are presented in Supplemental
Table 4). A history of vaccination adverse effects (30 / 136 [22.1%] vs. 325 / 4,323 [7.5%] of
participants without, p<0.001), disagreement with generally keeping vaccines up to date (rather
or totally disagree: 74 / 201 [36.8%], rather or totally agree: 269 / 4,150 [6.5%], p<0.001) and
with regularly receiving vaccinations against influenza (275 / 1,463 [18.8%] vs. 77 / 2,713
[2.8%], p<0.001) were associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy (Figure 5B, Supplemental
Table 3, Supplemental Table 4). Yet, a strong association to COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was
found towards fear of long-term (rather or totally agree: 302 / 863 [35.0%], rather or totally
disagree: 35 / 3,070 [1.1%], p<0.001) and short-term (159 / 596 [26.7%] vs. 160 / 3,377 [4.7%],
p<0.001) adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccines, as well as vaccine adverse effects in general
(133 / 469 [28.4%] vs. 176 / 3,705 [4.8%]). Disagreement on feeling well informed about
vaccines in general (rather or totally disagree: 85 / 265 [32.1%], rather or totally agree: 219 /
3,824 [5.7%], p<0.001) and specifically on COVID-19 vaccines (174 / 398 [43.7%] vs. 135 /
3,649 [3.7%], p<0.001) was associated with vaccine hesitancy (Figure 5C, Supplemental
Table 3, Supplemental Table 4). Further, increased vaccine hesitancy was found for
participants who believe that financial profit is more important for the pharmaceutical industry
than safety of their products in general (rather or totally agree: 197 / 663 [29.7%], rather or
totally disagree: 78 / 2,713 [2.9%], p<0.001) and in the production of COVID-19 vaccines (214 /
609 [35.1%] vs. 76 / 2,854 [2.7%], p<0.001), or for participants who reported skepticism towards
velocity of COVID-19 development (299 / 695 [43.0%] vs. 31 / 3,226 [1.0%], p<0.001), or the

new mechanism of action (237 / 584 [40.6%] vs. 61 / 3,383 [1.8%], p<0.001) (Figure 5C, 5D,
Supplemental Table 3, Supplemental Table 4).
COVID-19-specific attitudes and experiences in the personal surrounding
A strong association to COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was observed, when participants stated
that their personal surrounding had decided not to get vaccinated (183 / 251, 72.9%) compared
to 59 / 3,682 (1.6%) for those who reported that the majority of their family/friends have or would
like to have COVID-19 vaccination (p<0.001), and when their general practitioner had advised
against a COVID-19 vaccination (30 / 41 [73.2%] vs. 18 / 518 [3.5%] with advise for vaccination,
p<0.001). Also, a strong association between colleagues’ decisions against a COVID-19
vaccination and hesitancy was observed (not get vaccinated: 106 / 173 [61.3%], get vaccinated:
116 / 3,602 [3.2%], p<0.001). If participants did not know whether persons in their
acquaintances had already been vaccinated against COVID-19 (11 / 56, 19.6%) or if none of
these had been vaccinated (147 / 948, 15.5%) relevant vaccination hesitancy was present (217
/ 3,495 [6.2%] for participants who reported that people in the personal environment already
received at least one vaccination dose), (both p<0.001). Participants’ fear of an infection in the
professional environment (rather or totally agree: 78 / 2,307 [3.4%], rather or totally disagree:
248 / 1,451 [17.1%], p<0.001) was stronger associated to vaccine acceptance/hesitancy than
their fear of an infection in the private environment (32 / 1,387 [2.3%] vs. 297 / 2,225 [13.3%])
(Figure 6, Supplemental Table 3).
In participants expecting a severe COVID-19 disease course in individuals in their personal
environment, the number of hesitant or undecided participants was 141 / 3,197 (4.4%) vs 117 /
655 (17.9%) of those not expecting this (p<0.001), Figure 7. Participants who felt that they were
at risk of a severe disease course were significantly less often hesitant than participants not
fearing a risk of a severe course of the disease for themselves (rather or totally agree: 30 / 941
[3.2%], rather or totally disagree: 292 / 2,658 [11.0%], p<0.001). Only small differences in
vaccination acceptance/hesitancy were observed with regard to the history of COVID-19
infections, hospitalizations, intensive care unit admissions, and deaths in the participants’
acquaintances. Number of correct answers in the knowledge test was significantly associated
with frequency of vaccine hesitation (zero correct answers: 31 / 94, 33.0%, all four questions
answered correctly: 64 / 2,224, 2.9%, p<0.001) (Figure 7, Supplemental Table 3).
Main Sources of Information on COVID-19
In the group of vaccine hesitant participants, lower proportions reported to obtain COVID-19vaccination related information from online newspapers (42.4% vs 58.0%, p<0.001), TV / radio
(46.9% vs. 60.8%, p<0.001), or websites / media of federal agencies (63.7% vs 76.0%,

p<0.001). Furthermore, in this group, it was more frequently reported that COVID-19vaccination information was obtained via messenger services (13.6% vs 4.4%, p<0.001) or
online video platforms (23.7% vs 12.1%, p<0.001) (Figure 8).

Discussion
We examined COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in German health care workers (HCW) in one of the
largest and most comprehensive surveys. Overall, data of 4,500 German HCW who participated
in the survey during the second pandemic wave in Germany could be considered for this
analysis. Of these, about 92% were either willing or already had received the vaccination. This
high percentage of acceptance contrasts with recently published studies in Germany and
worldwide (see Table 1) and shows that vaccine hesitancy may change rapidly. We could
furthermore show that vaccine hesitancy in HCW is multifactorial. The identified factors
associated with COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy might help to shape specific vaccination
campaigns.
In this pandemic, vaccine hesitancy among HCW is an urgent issue (7) that needs to be
addressed rapidly. Comparison to previously published studies as shown in Table 1 needs to
be done cautiously as acceptance was defined differently, measured on different scales, using
different questionnaires with different numbers of items asked in different countries and time
periods. One strength of this study is that the survey was conducted after the Comirnaty®
vaccine by BioNTech/Pfizer had been approved and was available for German HCW in
hospitals. HCW are ranked priority in a situation with limited availability of vaccines to maintain
critical health care functions which are especially needed in a pandemic situation. As this group
of people has the highest exposure and risk of disease transmission, they had a realistic chance
of getting vaccinated very soon in comparison to the hypothetical question asked in other
surveys where no vaccination had been approved by health care authorities at the time of the
survey. Online surveys are a powerful tool to achieve a broad response in short periods of time
and therefore especially of use in a pandemic situation (35). This is opposed to conventional
methods with pen-and-paper and careful selection of a representative sample which would
simply take too much time in extremely fast changing circumstances (35). In addition, an online
survey already seemed more than advisable given the distance requirements and the
necessary reduction of interpersonal contacts.

General vaccine hesitancy in HCW is common (8, 36) and recently published surveys observed
substantial skepticism towards receiving a COVID-19 vaccination (summarized in Table 1).
Previously, COVID-19 acceptance rates had been observed to range between 31% and 86%.
The only comparable German survey was conducted mainly in intensive care settings. In that
study, the acceptance of 50% in nurses and 73% in physicians was rather low compared to our
data (15). However, the earlier assessment in December 2020 with an absence of approved
and available vaccines could explain these differences. These low numbers would be
insufficient to reach herd immunity in the medical sector (1). With 92% acceptance, we found a
broad consent to receive a COVID-19 vaccination throughout all groups of HCW. As our survey
has taken place in February 2021 and, therefore, much later than the previously published
studies it is likely that the acceptance has changed during the pandemic, with co-health-careworkers already being vaccinated. As vaccination has started in January 2021 in most German
hospitals, 44% of the participants in our study had already been vaccinated.
Also, compared with an estimated worldwide acceptance of around 70%, German HCW showed
higher acceptance rates (25). This highlights again the high acceptance rate of German HCW
but also points to substantial regional and cross-country differences that might not be
generalizable. HCW often function as ambassadors for vaccine acceptance in the general
population (36, 37). Therefore, our observations might lead to the conclusion that German HCW
might have already acted as role models for vaccine acceptancy during the COVID-19
pandemic for their own peer group.
In Germany, influenza vaccination is recommended to all HCW (38). In our survey only 60%
followed that recommendation, yet this rate was still higher than in some other published
surveys in HCW (38, 39). This suggests a large-scale general vaccine acceptance in
participating HCW which is in line with the observed general trust in vaccines, their efficacy, and
the high agreement with the statement to keep vaccinations up to date. The perceived severe
threat by COVID-19 might explain the higher acceptance to vaccinate against COVID-19 as
compared to the seasonal influenza.
Comparison of vaccine hesitancy in the German health care workers and the general
population
The acceptance to receive a vaccination in the general population in Germany is measured
weekly by the COSMO study (40). In that study, acceptance rates are relatively stable at 68%
and therefore lower than in our survey (14). The ongoing debate about Astra Zeneca's vaccine
Vaxzevria®, can only serve to a limited extent as an explanation for this discrepancy, since this
debate had just begun during our survey. However, it seems conceivable that the threat from

COVID-19 appears less abstract for HCW than for the general population, which could lead to a
higher willingness to vaccinate. Yet, preliminary results of the COVIMO study did not find major
differences between German HCW and the general population regarding acceptance to receive
a COVID-19 vaccine (preliminary results published online only. (34). However, the HCWs
surveyed there were only a small subgroup.
Factors influencing COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy
As media reports on vaccine hesitancy in German HCW claimed low acceptance rates, it
became particularly important to assess the actual vaccination acceptance of HCW and reasons
for hesitancy. In our study, 3.7% of all participants were undecided and 4.6% refused a COVID19 vaccination. The subgroup of participants working in outpatient nursing services was
stronger associated with a COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy with the caveat of a low number of
participants in this subgroup. This might be due to the fact that most vaccine campaigns took
place in hospitals and by health care providers, leading to the assumption that these workers
were better informed. Working with COVID-19 patients was not associated with acceptance to
receive a COVID-19 vaccine, except in HCW with less than 50% occupation with COVID-19
patients. This might be explained by the consideration of a perceived higher transmission risk in
the family setting than in the professional setting where personal protective equipment and strict
testing of patients and staff is used routinely, especially in COVID-19 treatment units, where
HCWs treat COVID-19 patients on a daily basis. Also, it could be speculated that HCW in
German hospitals were sufficiently supplied with professional protective equipment and
therefore the threat of becoming infected with COVID-19 was judged lower (41).
The number of correct answers in the four COVID-19 vaccine knowledge questions was
significantly associated with vaccination acceptance providing a direct starting point for
informational campaigns. To test whether improving knowledge about COVID-19 vaccines is a
modifiable risk factor leading to higher vaccination acceptance is recommended for further
studies.
It is not surprising that prior adverse effects to vaccines went along with lower vaccine
acceptance. The same could be seen for the factor of “up to date” vaccination and the
acceptance to receive an influenza shot. This is in good accordance with previous studies (42).
A general and COVID-19 vaccine-specific mistrust in the pharmaceutical industry was also
associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy.
Possible implications for COVID-19 vaccination campaigns
Overall, the acceptance in HCW was remarkably high throughout Germany with a tendency of
lower acceptance in northern and eastern parts of Germany. However, this small difference

might not justify applying different vaccine campaigns in different German regions. Due to the
high acceptance rate in HCW, they should therefore be involved as ambassadors for the
COVID-19 vaccination campaign. We suppose that HCW already serve as a role model.
Inclusion of HCW in vaccination campaigns might contribute to improved trust in the
vaccination. It seems that low numbers of hesitant HCW have high distrust in politicians and
health authorities. Having identified trust in vaccines and authorities as a potential modifiable
risk factors in HCW, this might not be changeable in short-term campaigns but important in
long-term projects. As hesitant HCW are using more streaming video platforms and messenger
services it might be reasonable to use these media in designing a vaccination campaign. We
assume that the produced content should be of high-level quality in regard to content and
storytelling. This implies the need of multi-professional teams including medical education
media professionals. As knowledge about the COVID-19 vaccine is a strong factor in favor of
the vaccination, “infotainment” formats, e.g., easy to understand explanatory videos might be
useful. Importantly, to evaluate the effect of COVID-19 vaccination campaigns a scientific
supervision appears to be advisable.

Limitations of the study also need to be considered. As this in an open online survey it is
impossible to estimate how representative the sample is. Due to the broad distribution of the
survey without addressing specific individuals (due to German data protection laws) we cannot
estimate how many HCW received the invitation to participate in the survey. Therefore, the
study could be biased towards participants with a positive attitude towards a COVID-19
vaccination. Especially, mistrust in the state and organizations could further hinder participation.
Furthermore, we have solely evaluated factors associated with vaccine hesitancy in HCW.
Therefore, implications may primarily be drawn for this target group and not be generalizable to
the general public. Finally, the small numbers in some subgroups allow only limited conclusions
for these subgroups.
Conclusions
In conclusion we saw a high overall acceptance rate amongst HCW to receive a COVID-19
vaccine. Furthermore, several factors associated with vaccination hesitancy in HCW were
identified. Absence of knowledge about the vaccines and their mechanism of action as well as
mistrust in authorities have been revealed as most important and potentially modifiable factors
of vaccination hesitancy. HCW, due to their knowledge and overall high acceptance towards
COVID-19 vaccination may prove as promising ambassadors for supporting the COVID-19
