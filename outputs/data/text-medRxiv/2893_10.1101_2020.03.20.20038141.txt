Abstract
The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is one of the biggest challenges healthcare systems worldwide have ever had to face.
To curb transmission many countries have adopted social distancing measures and travel restrictions. Estimating
the effect of these measures in each context is challenging and requires mathematical models of the transmission
dynamics. Projections for the future course of the epidemic strongly rely on model predictions and accurate
representation of real-time data as they accumulate. Here I develop an SEIR modeling framework for Covid19, to evaluate reported cases and fatalities, and to enable forecasting using evidence-based Bayesian parameter
estimation. This Bayesian framework offers a tool to parametrize real-time dynamics of Covid-19 cases, and
explore the effect of control as it unfolds in any setting. I apply the model to Covid-19 data from Albania, where
drastic control measures were put in place already on the day of the first confirmed case. Evaluating the dynamics
of reported cases 9-31 March 2020, I estimate parameters and make preliminary projections. Three weeks into
the measures, Albanian data already indicate a strong signature of more than 40% transmission reduction, and
lend support to a progressively increasing effect of control measures rather than a static one. In the Albanian
setting, the model and data match well, projecting the peak of the outbreak may be around 5-15 April, and be
contained within 300 active confirmed cases if control continues with the same trend. This framework can be used
to understand the quantitative effects of different control measures in real-time, and inform adaptive intervention
for success in other settings.

Current data and situation
Albania reported the first confirmed case of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on the 9th of March 2020. Given very
close travel connections with Italy, where the epidemic grew very fast over the month of February, the concern over
a major similar outbreak in Albania was significant. Immediately following the first case confirmation, country-wide
measures were taken to drastically reduce transmission and contain the spread of infection. These included university
and school closures, suspension of public gatherings, closure of bars and cafes, travel restrictions, and gradually a
lockdown of the population. The parameters governing the epidemic course of COVID-19 in Albania remain unknown.
The first week after the first detected case, official numbers indicated case counts amounting to a total 59 confirmed
cases on March 18, with two fatalities (Albanian Institute of Public Health). The initial exponential growth rate of
the number of cases in Albania was r = 0.17 during the first week, coming from a doubling time of 4 days (1), but
this has slowed down from March 14 onward. It is not known what will be the trajectory of the epidemic in this
country. Following the diagnosis of the first cases, the borders with Italy, Greece, Kosovo were rapidly closed and
many flights to other European destinations were limited or cancelled.
The aim of this study is to provide a framework for interpreting and forecasting the real-time course of the
epidemic as it unfolds in a given setting. I use the Albanian data as an illustration for the application of the model.
With the model and Bayesian estimation, continuously-updating values for the parameters, underlying the epidemic
course of COVID-19, can be obtained, and continuously-updating projections. Based on the model application to
Albania, the parameter estimates and their associated uncertainty, suggest clear positive effects of control measures
and make precise quantitative projections about the magnitude and timing of the peak of this outbreak in Albania.

Mathematical model
There are currently many efforts to understand Covid-19 dynamics around the world using mathematical models
(2; 3; 4; 5). The mathematical model I use here is based on SEIR dynamics (Figure 1, simplifying the model by (4) to
a version without age structure. We model the number of susceptible individuals S, exposed individuals E whose
transmission may be considered negligible, infected symptomatic IS and infected asymptomatic IA individuals,
as well as fatalities F and recovered individuals R. The total population size is given by N = S+E+IS +IA +R+F .
At the beginning of the epidemic we have S(0) ≈ N.
The ordinary differential equations describing the transmission dynamics are as follows:

(5)

= γ(1 − f )IS + γIA

(6)

For the parameters, average values were assumed based on the existing literature on COVID-19 (6; 7; 4). The
basic reproduction number R0 for COVID-19 transmission, denoting the number of new infections generated from
a typical infected individual during the period of infectiousness, is expected to be between 1.7 and 2.6, (2), and is
the key target of control measures. The incubation time from exposure to infection, informing the progression rate
τ , has been shown to be around 6.5 days (median), and up to 14 days (8). Exposed individuals are assumed to not
be infectious. After progressing to infection, a fraction of individuals are symptomatic given by φ, and 1 − φ are
asymptomatic. The duration of infection from infected people in Wuhan has been observed to be around 11 days
(7), motivating my assumption of γ = 1/11 in the model, but larger and lower values have also been reported such as
20-30 days infectious period (9; 6) and 3.48 days (3). In Albania, until March 28, more than 30 infected individuals
have recovered, with typical viral shedding from onset of symptoms for about 6 days.
The model assumes symptomatic individuals can progress to recovery or death with relative probability 1−f and f .
It is assumed that asymptomatic individuals only experience mild infection and progress to recovery. Asymptomatic
individuals transmit less infection, scaling their contribution by a factor k2 (k2 < 1).

Effect of control
The control measures in Albania started to be implemented very quickly, remarkably starting at the first day of case
detection, and scaling up to country-wide quarantine by March 14, 5 days afterwards. To implement the effect of
control measures in the model, I included a time-varying (decreasing) β, assuming this started to be effective at day
Tin after the first detected case:
β(t) = β0

1+

ek(t−Tin )

(Dynamic control model)

where the parameter k reflects the speed of reduction in transmission. Another way to model reduction in transmission
is to assume an instantaneous drop in global transmission rate, by a factor c (constant) at time Tin :
(
β0 , for t < Tin
β(t) =
(Constant control model)
cβ0 , for t ≥ Tin .
Both of these modes of control are fitted to the data, and their quality of fit is compared to verify which mode of
control (dynamic or static) is more consistent with the dynamics observed.

Bayesian inference
I used a Bayesian framework to estimate parameters fitting the model to data. We obtain the posterior distributions
for θ as:
P (data|θ)
P (θ|data) = R
P (data|θ)p(θ)dθ
I used flat priors p(θ) for all parameters. The likelihood P (data|θ) is given by a normal distribution for the
mean-squared error between the data and the model. We take into account the data di , fi denoting number of active
confirmed cases and cumulative fatalities for each time ti , and compare them with model predictions for Is (ti ) and
F (ti ). For simplicity, I do not model the sampling process (e.g. Poisson) in this basic version.

a Bayesian framework. The parameters estimated were E0 , β0 , f and k or c depending on the assumed mode of

for the number of confirmed cases (IS (t) in the model). The lighter shaded region gives the 95%credible envelopes
with 100 simulations parametrized from random samples of the posterior distribution. The darker-shaded region
gives the 50% credible envelope. B. Model prediction for the cumulative number of fatalities. C. Model prediction
for the rate of reduction in transmission consistent with data up to March 28, 2020.
Figure 2, A to C, shows model predictions of reported cases generated using the best-fitting model parameter
estimates. The model fit captures the range of observed cases well, from March 2, 2020 up to March 28 2020.
In addition, the best-fitting model yields posterior credible intervals for the future course of the novel coronavirus
(COVID-19) outbreak in Albania. The Bayesian framework yields estimates for the best-fitting parameters as well as
their posterior distributions (Figure 3). The estimate for the median crude-case fatality ratio is 7%, 95%CI(0.02,0.13),
similar to such crude estimates obtained in early dynamics in Wuhan (3), but higher than the 1-2% true case-fatality
ratio expected if all (symptomatic and asymptomatic) cases are confirmed (7).

Estimated R0 and control efficacy
The median estimate of the basic reproductive number (R0 ) at the beginning of the outbreak is 5.45, 95%CI (4.15,
6.95), about double the estimates from early dynamics in the literature (2; 3). The median estimate of the efficacy
of dynamic control measures, assuming they were effective 5-days after the first confirmed case (Tin = 5) is 0.09,
95%CI (0.02,0.14). This implies that by the first week of control, transmission was reduced by about 30%.

Estimated initial number of exposed cases
The initial seeding of the epidemic in Albania is unknown, but for the initial number of exposed cases E0 , the model
estimates a value of 78, 95%CI (61,98). This seems relatively small given the strength of travel connections with
Italy. Yet, when we take into account the actual numbers, we obtain an independent estimate that is very close to
this model-based estimate.

Figure 3: Posterior distributions of parameters using data from March 9 to 28. The mean-squared error
between model and data is assumed normally-distributed with mean 0 and standard deviation σ. I used flat priors for
all parameters. Two Monte Carlo Markov Chains were run for 5000 iterations until burn-in. Following convergence,
another 10000 iterations were run to obtain the posterior distributions for all parameters (shown here) and to compute
credible envelopes.

An independent estimate of imported cases from Italy
A big unknown is the initial number of imported cases from Italy to Albania during the month of the epidemic
outbreak in Italy (8th of February until 8th of March), just prior to the first case detected in Albania. Using the
data available from INSTAT (11), about the yearly travel fluxes between Albania and Italy via air (1.7 million
passengers) and by sea (1.6 million passengers), we obtain a total of 1.65 million arriving passengers on average
from Italy to Albania in one year. This translates to 0.13 million passengers in one month. Thus, during the month
prior to the first case in Albania, about 130.000 thousand passengers are expected to have arrived to Albania from
Italy via air and sea. To compute the prevalence of infection expected in such passengers, we must account for the
exponential disease dynamics in Italy during the same period. The prevalence of infection in travelers arriving to
Albania from Italy can be assumed to be roughly the same as the prevalence of infection in the Italian population
itself during this period (12). I used the publicly available data for the epidemics in Italy (1), starting with 3 cases
in February 8 and counting 5883 cases on the 8th of March, following an exponential growth at rate r = 0.25 (13).

first detected case.

Epidemic projections based on dynamics 9-28 March
Quantitatively, if the control measures continue with the same rhythm, this model with its best-fitting parameters,
based on the data up to March 28, 2020, predicts that the peak of the epidemic in Albania will be reached on
day 36 after the first detected case, with 50%CI (32,45) and 95% CI(26, 121). The magnitude of the number of
active confirmed cases at the peak will be around 302 with 50% CI(242,498) and 95%CI(180,1.1 × 105 ), thus still
with substantial uncertainty. The total number of Covid-19 cases, including those documented/confirmed and those
not-confirmed (asymptomatic) will be 1903 with 50%CI (1386,3674) and 95% CI (930, 5.4 × 105 ). While all these
predictions are to be taken with caution, since we don’t have yet a clear final signature of drop in cases, they indicate
some reason for optimism in the possibilities of limited epidemic size of SARS-Cov2 in Albania. If the effect of
control measures continues with this trend, the epidemic projections for Albania suggested by the model appear
manageable. Under constant control instead, the data suggest that current efforts have reduced transmission by 40%
(see Table 2), but if this remains at this level, it is not sufficient to limit the number of cases in the short term (see
Supplementary Figures S1-S3).

Updating projections with data in real-time and model comparison
The advantage of this framework is that new data arriving in real-time can update model estimates and subsequent
projections. In the case of Albanian data, adding the case observations for the next 3 days (March 29-31), narrows
dramatically the credible intervals of the future course of the epidemic (see Figure 5) with little change in the
posterior parameter estimates (Figure S4). The model-predictions for the quantitative aspects of the epidemic are
also narrowed substantially (Figure S5). In particular, the peak of the outbreak is expected to occur between
5-15 April (Fig.S5C), and not surpass 300 active confirmed cases (Fig.S5B), if control continues with this trend.
Comparing the model fits to data March 9-31 for the dynamic control and constant control model, we observe a
smaller error for the dynamic control than the constant control model (Figure 6). This is further confirmed from
analysis of the deviance information criterion DIC (14), where we find that DICdynamic = 4447 for the dynamic
model, and DICconstant = 27283 for the constant model. Typically models with smaller DIC are favoured. Thus, the
data strongly suggest that the effect of control measures on transmission in Albania has been dynamic, increasing
over time.

Figure 5: Model fit and projections based on dynamics 9-31 March. Feeding the model with more data
substantially enhances model predictions, reducing the uncertainty, and suggesting a small size epidemic in Albania.

Discussion
This is a simple model embedded in a Bayesian framework, to fit real-time data of early COVID-19 dynamics,
estimate parameters and generate predictions, accounting for intrinsic uncertainty. The model is generic and can be
applied to any setting. I show that it captures well the data from March 9 to March 28 in Albania, and suggests
that the effects of control are already tangible in the dynamics. A dynamic control put in place almost immediately
after the detection of the first case, has had an effect of reducing the original transmission, already by 30% in the
first week of implementation. The projections are based on maintaining control from the onset of intervention, Tin ,
throughout the period simulated.
The model assumes homogeneous mixing of all individuals, which is of course an approximation. There are clear
social networks and heterogeneities between regions, age classes, socio-demographic groups, especially households,
that the model is not considering. Stochasticity, for example in person-person variation for number of new infections
generated, considered by other studies (2) could be important also in this context, where the numbers of infected
reported are relatively low.
The model assumes all symptomatic infections are detected. If confirmed cases only reflect a proportion of the

true symptomatic cases, then the effective symptomatic proportion the model would ‘see’ would be lower, and slightly
different model parameters would result.
An R0 so high, of the order of 5, estimated by the early dynamics of confirmed cases in Albania, may be related
to superspreaders having dominated the early transmission events in the epidemic in this country, or related to big
public gatherings and festivities at national level (political meetings, International Women’s day, etc.) just preceding
the first confirmed case. Other studies have also shown that mean R0 ranges from 2.24 (95%CI: 1.96-2.55) to 3.58
(95%CI: 2.89-4.39) (15), and is very sensitive to the reporting rate. If the reporting rate is increased by 8-fold, the
estimate is expected to approach the more widely agreed values in the literature (2; 3). So far the model does not
take into account reporting rate, but it is likely that Covid-19 cases in Albania may be under-reported, due to the
low number of overall tests performed, compared to the total population size.
Although at first sight it may seem that the model does not capture the specific isolation of contacts of confirmed
cases, but only a global progressive transmission-reducing intervention, the increase in contact-tracing as the number
of confirmed cases increases, can be mathematically close to the dynamic increase in efficacy of control (β(t)), studied
here in terms of one of the modes of control. In contrast, the social distancing alone, could be approximated to have
contributed mainly a constant fixed effect on transmission reduction.
Model predictions still remain uncertain, thus it is very critical to maintain in place and strengthen the control
measures to minimize transmission. As new data are arriving over the next days and weeks, with more tests to be
performed, these initial predictions can be verified and updated.
The framework, however, as it stands provides a general tool to explore and understand dynamics of Covid-19
in other settings. While case-fatality-ratio here and probability of symptoms is assumed the same for the entire
population, variation between age-classes or other strata of the population exist (4; 5) and could be implemented in
model extensions or applications to other settings.
