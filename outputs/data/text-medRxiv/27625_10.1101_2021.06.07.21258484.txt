ABSTRACT (192 words)
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening syndrome of respiratory failure
and diffuse alveolar damage that results from dysregulated local and systemic immune activation,
causing pulmonary vascular, parenchymal and alveolar damage. SARS-CoV-2 infection has
become the dominant cause of ARDS worldwide, and emerging evidence implicates neutrophils
and their cytotoxic arsenal of effector functions as central drivers of immune-mediated lung injury
in COVID-19 ARDS. However, a key outstanding question is whether COVID-19 drives a unique
program of neutrophil activation or effector functions that contributes to the severe pathogenesis
of this pandemic illness, and whether this unique neutrophil response can be targeted to attenuate
disease. Using a combination of high-dimensional single cell analysis and ex vivo functional assays
of neutrophils from patients with COVID-19 ARDS compared to non-COVID ARDS (caused by
bacterial pneumonia), we identified a functionally distinct landscape of neutrophil activation in
COVID-19 ARDS that was intrinsically programmed during SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Furthermore, neutrophils in COVID-19 ARDS were functionally primed to produce high amounts
of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Surprisingly, this unique pathological program of
neutrophil priming escaped conventional therapy with dexamethasone, thereby revealing a
promising target for adjunctive immunotherapy in severe COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening syndrome of hypoxemic
respiratory failure and diffuse alveolar damage that results from an aberrant host response to
respiratory and systemic insults, with the most common cause being severe pneumonia (1).
Dysregulated local and systemic inflammation triggers widespread pulmonary vascular,
parenchymal and alveolar damage, resulting in failure of gas exchange and critical illness (2). The
mainstay of treatment for ARDS is supportive care including the use of mechanical ventilation,
but ongoing research efforts strive to define the mechanisms of pathogenesis to enable targeted
therapeutic interventions (2).
SARS-CoV-2 infection has emerged as the dominant cause of ARDS worldwide in the context of
the COVID-19 pandemic (3). This has created an explosion of research to understand why SARSCoV-2 infection is so prone to precipitating ARDS, and much has been learned about the
pathogenesis including aberrant local and systemic immune responses elicited by the virus.
Transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of the immune landscape in the bloodstream as well as
lung tissue have revealed that COVID-19 is associated with a dysregulated myeloid cellular
response, and in particular, that the progression towards severe disease is heralded by aberrant
neutrophil activation (4–8). Autopsy studies of lung tissue from fatal COVID-19 have shown
evidence of neutrophil infiltration within the pulmonary microvasculature and alveoli, albeit to a
lesser extent than ARDS caused by bacterial pneumonia, suggesting distinct mechanisms of
neutrophil responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to other causes of ARDS (9, 10).
Furthermore, neutrophils within the pulmonary microvasculature of severe COVID-19 are
associated with widespread neutrophil extracellular trap (NETs) production (11–14). This
dysregulated neutrophil effector response is thought to contribute to impaired gas exchange
through the induction of microvascular thrombosis and perfusion defects, as well as tissue injury
and diffuse alveolar damage.
Given the growing appreciation that immune-mediated pathology is the primary driver of disease
in COVID-19 ARDS, it has become the focus of therapeutic intervention. Currently, the most
established immunomodulatory therapy for severe COVID-19 is dexamethasone, which has been
shown to reduce mortality in moderate to severe COVID-19 (15). However, the mechanisms by

which dexamethasone improves clinical outcomes in COVID-19 are incompletely understood, and
therefore, opportunities may exist for adjunctive immunomodulation directed at mechanisms that
escape the activity of dexamethasone.
A key outstanding question is whether COVID-19 ARDS drives a unique program of neutrophil
maturation, activation, or effector functions that contributes to the severe pathogenesis of this
pandemic illness, and whether this unique neutrophil response could be targeted therapeutically to
supplement established therapies like dexamethasone. To address these questions, we used a
combination of high-dimensional single cell analysis and ex vivo functional assays of neutrophils
from patients with COVID-19 ARDS compared to non-COVID ARDS (bacterial pneumonia). We
observed that COVID-19 programs a distinct landscape of neutrophil activation compared to nonCOVID ARDS, and that neutrophil from COVID-19 patients are uniquely primed to produce
NETs. This functional priming was an intrinsically programmed response during SARS-CoV-2
infection, as it could not be induced in healthy neutrophils by incubation with the plasma of
COVID-19 patients, and neutrophils remained competent to respond to secondary bacterial
challenges. Consistent with previous reports, we observed a trend towards worse clinical outcomes
in patients with high levels of NETs production, but surprisingly we found that this was not
modified in patients receiving dexamethasone treatment. Together, these data reveal a unique
pathological program of neutrophil priming in COVID-19 that escapes conventional therapy, and
therefore may represent a promising target for adjunctive treatments that provide synergistic
benefits in the fight against severe COVID-19.

RESULTS
The systemic immune response in COVID-19 ARDS is dominated by a unique neutrophil
landscape and is distinct from non-COVID ARDS.
It is now well established that SARS-CoV-2 induces a unique systemic immune response that is
central to the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19, including a putative role for neutrophils in the
progression of disease during SARS-CoV-2 infection. To systematically examine the contribution
of neutrophils to systemic immune dysregulation in severe COVID-19, we investigated the cellular
immune landscape in the bloodstream of patients with ARDS caused by COVID-19 pneumonia or
bacterial pneumonia (hereafter, non-COVID ARDS). Patients were balanced with respect to age,
sex, illness severity, and treatments including mechanical ventilation (Table 1). Patients were
enrolled prospectively, and blood specimens collected on admission (day 1) and again on day 7 in
survivors who remained in the ICU. We performed high-dimensional single cell analysis using
mass cytometry on whole blood from patients with COVID-19 ARDS compared to non-COVID
ARDS. Neutrophils were the dominant immune cell in the blood of all patients, with the total
quantity of neutrophils being higher in patients with non-COVID ARDS (Fig 1A). Comparatively
small differences were seen in other immune cell populations such as classical monocytes, myeloid
dendritic cells, and activated B-cells, with no significant differences found in other major cell
compartments (Fig 1A). In addition to quantitative difference, we next investigated whether the
neutrophils differed phenotypically between COVID-19 and non-COVID ARDS patients.
Dimensionality reduction using tSNE revealed marked changes in the clustering of neutrophils
between patients with COVID-19 and non-COVID ARDS, whereas clusters of other major cell
populations (T-cells, B-cells, monocytes, etc.) were largely stable (Fig 1B). To further investigate
this difference in the neutrophil compartment, we analyzed expression levels of 23 neutrophilrelevant surface and intracellular markers on gated neutrophils, and found significant differences
driven by augmented expression of CD11b, CD66b, CD11a, and reduced CD62L, and CD107A
on neutrophils from patients with COVID-19 ARDS, consistent with a more activated phenotype
(Fig 1C and D). Together these data demonstrate a distinct neutrophil landscape in COVID-19
ARDS that is a dominant aspect of the systemic immune response to SARS-CoV-2.

To further resolve the differences between COVID-19 and non-COVID neutrophil responses, we
performed unsupervised clustering of neutrophil single cell events with FlowSOM, and identified
8 distinct clusters of neutrophils (Fig 2A). Comparing our two patient populations, we identified
stark differences in the presence and abundance of distinct neutrophil clusters between COVID19 and non-COVID ARDS patients (Fig 2A-C). Again, we observed dominance by mature and
activated neutrophil clusters in all patients with COVID-19, whereas the neutrophil compartment
in patients with non-COVID ARDS was more heterogeneous, with an overall predominance of
immature neutrophil populations (Fig 2C-D). Collectively, these data indicate that patients with
COVID-19 ARDS display a unique systemic immune response that is dominated by a distinct
neutrophil landscape compared to non-COVID ARDS, and is driven by a shift towards a more
mature and activated neutrophil phenotype.
The unique neutrophil landscape in COVID-19 ARDS is associated with functional priming
Given the distinct phenotypic landscape of neutrophils observed in COVID-19 ARDS, we next
sought to determine whether neutrophils in COVID-19 ARDS display unique effector
functionality. We performed ex vivo live-cell functional analyses on neutrophils isolated from
patients with COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 ARDS to quantitatively assess key effector
function including the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and reactive oxygen species.
To understand the intrinsic functional activity of neutrophils in response to COVID-19 or nonCOVID-19 ARDS, we first assessed the production of NETs and ROS in otherwise unstimulated
cells. Surprisingly, neutrophils from patients with COVID-19 ARDS on day 1 of ICU admission
displayed significantly higher basal NETs release compared to neutrophils from patients with nonCOVID ARDS (Fig 3A-B). As expected, neutrophils from healthy volunteers did not release NETs
under basal conditions (Fig 3A-B). This augmented NETs release in COVID-19 neutrophils was
sustained over time, with a notable trend towards increased production of NETs on day 7 of illness
in patients with COVID-19 but not non-COVID-19 ARDS (Fig 3C). Neutrophils from all groups
were found to release similar levels of NETs upon stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate-13
(PMA) suggesting that the capacity to respond to maximal activation was not different (Supp. Fig.
1). In contrast to NETs release, ROS production by neutrophils was not different between COVID19 and non-COVID ARDS either at admission or after 7 days in the ICU (Fig. 3D-F). Together,

these data indicate that the distinct neutrophil landscape in COVID-19 ARDS is marked by
functional priming of specific effector mechanisms including neutrophil extracellular trap release.

Functional priming of neutrophils in COVID-19 is not induced by circulating inflammatory
mediators
Plasma biomarker analysis in various cohorts of patients with severe COVID-19 have described a
circulating “cytokine storm” that is distinct from other causes of sepsis and ARDS (16). Previous
work by us and others (17, 18) has shown that circulating inflammatory mediators in patients with
septic shock induce neutrophil hyper-production of effector mechanisms, including the release of
neutrophil extracellular traps. To determine whether the functional priming and activation of
neutrophils observed in COVID-19 ARDS was a response to the unique circulating cytokine storm
in these patients, we assessed the ability of patient plasma to induce NETs release by autologous
neutrophils isolated from healthy volunteers. Consistent with findings from previous studies,
plasma from patients with non-COVID ARDS induced robust NETs release by healthy donor
neutrophils (Fig 4A). In stark contrast, plasma from patients with COVID-19 failed to induce
NETs release (Fig 4A). There was also no induction of ROS generation in response to plasma from
patients with COVID-19 nor non-COVID ARDS (Fig 4B-C). These data demonstrate that
functional priming and augmented NETs production of COVID-19 neutrophils is not a by-product
of a unique circulating inflammatory milieu (“cytokine storm”) in patients with COVID-19.
Priming of neutrophils in COVID-19 does not alter the response to secondary bacterial
challenge
In addition to their role as pathogenic effector cells in ARDS, neutrophil dysfunction in critically
ill patients also contributes to other complication of ARDS, including high susceptibility to
secondary bacterial infections (including ventilator-associated pneumonia) (19). Therefore, we
sought to determine if the distinct neutrophil program in COVID-19 ARDS may drive differential
susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections compared to non-COVID ARDS. To test this
hypothesis, neutrophils were challenged ex vivo with the common nosocomial bacterial pathogen

Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, MW2 strain) to determine their ability to mount anti-bacterial
effector mechanisms (phagocytosis, NETs production, ROS production) in response to secondary
bacterial challenge. Live cell imaging of neutrophils isolated from patients with COVID-19 and
non-COVID ARDS demonstrated robust capture and phagocytosis of fluorescent S. aureus (GFP+)
in both patient groups on admission and after 7 days in ICU, and was not different from healthy
donor neutrophils (Fig 5A and 5B). Furthermore, production of NETs (Fig 5C-D) and ROS (Figure
5E-F) in response to S. aureus stimulation was also similar between COVID-19 and non-COVID
ARDS patients. These equivalent effector responses to secondary bacterial challenge is consistent
with the finding that nosocomial infections occurred in similar proportions in each patient group,
as shown by equivalent infection-free survival between patient populations (Fig 5G). This is
consistent with published reports of nosocomial infections in severe COVID-19 (20). Together,
these results suggest that neutrophils retain their competence to respond to secondary bacterial
pathogens during COVID-19 ARDS, consistent with the observation that difference in clinical
outcomes with non-COVID critical ARDS are not driven by differential susceptibility to
nosocomial infections (20).
Pathological neutrophil priming in COVID-19 may escape established therapies, revealing
opportunities for targeted therapeutic adjuncts.
Emerging data implicates hyperactive NETs as an important mediator of pulmonary vascular and
parenchymal injury in COVID-19, with recent studies demonstrating an association between
surrogate markers of NETs in the circulation and disease severity (21, 22). Given that augmented
NETs release is a key feature of the functionally distinct neutrophil program observed in our
COVID-19 patients, we analyzed the impact of NETs production on clinical outcomes. Although
our sample size was insufficient to achieve statistical significance, a clear trend was observed with
100% 90-day survival in low NETs producers (neutrophil NETs release <cohort median),
compared to only 60% 90-day survival in high NETs producers (neutrophil NETs release >median
of cohort) (Fig 6A). Together with emerging published data, these findings suggest that NETs may
be an important pathogenic mediator in COVID-19 and may be amenable to therapeutic targeting
(23). Therefore, we aimed to determine whether the clinical efficacy of dexamethasone therapy
may be related to its ability to modulate pathological neutrophil priming in COVID-19. We

analyzed NETs production, surface and intracellular marker expression, and single cell cluster
profiles of neutrophils from COVID-19 patients who were treated with dexamethasone compared
to patients who did not receive dexamethasone. Surprisingly, we observed no significant difference
in NETs production nor the phenotypic landscape of circulating neutrophils after treatment with
dexamethasone, either early (day 1) or later (day 7) during ICU admission (Fig 6B-E,
Supplementary Fig 2). Given that pathological neutrophil priming and NETs production are not
modified by dexamethasone treatment, these data suggest that adjunctive therapies (eg. NETs
targeted therapies) may yield additive benefits to dexamethasone and represents an important
avenue for further therapeutic development in the fight against COVID-19 ARDS.

DISCUSSION
Our results add to the growing literature on the importance of neutrophils in the
immunopathogenesis of ARDS, including severe COVID-19. It is now well established that
patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection display widespread alterations in the myeloid compartment
that contribute to disease severity (24, 25). Using high-dimensional single cell analysis of the entire
immune landscape in whole blood, we further this understanding by demonstrating that the
systemic immune response in COVID-19 ARDS is dominated by a unique neutrophil compartment
characterized by mature and active neutrophil populations. This was in stark contrast to the
neutrophil response during non-COVID ARDS, which was much more heterogeneous and
dominated by immature neutrophil populations. Further dissecting the functional implications of
this unique neutrophil program in COVID-19, we observed that neutrophils from patients with
COVID-19 ARDS were functionally primed to release neutrophil extracellular traps, and that highNETs producers were at greater risk of adverse clinical outcomes, consistent with previous reports
(21–23). Surprisingly, this functional priming was not attenuated in patients treated with
dexamethasone therapy, thereby revealing this pathological neutrophil program as a potential
target for adjunctive therapies to combat COVID-19 ARDS.
We found that neutrophils are functionally primed in COVID-19 ARDS to produce NETs, and that
this priming was intrinsically programmed during SARS-CoV-2 infection and could not be
induced in healthy neutrophils in response to plasma from patients with COVID-19 ARDS. Again,
this differed from non-COVID ARDS, as plasma from these patients induced robust NETs
production by healthy donor neutrophils, consistent with previous studies that have shown NETs
production in response to plasma from patients with bacterial sepsis and ARDS (17, 18). The
“cytokine storm” of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection has been the focus of extensive investigation
to understand the systemic immune drivers of COVID-19. A systematic review and meta-analysis
of published cytokine data from 25 studies (totalling 1245 patients) found that substantial
differences existed in the levels of core pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines between those with
COVID-19 ARDS and non-COVID-19 ARDS, revealing that levels of key mediators like IL-6
and TNFa were often much lower in COVID-19 ARDS (16). Together with our findings, these

data collectively support a unique systemic milieu of inflammatory mediators in COVID-19
compared to non-COVID ARDS that have differential effects on neutrophil function.
Amongst the arsenal of neutrophil effector mechanisms, NETs are emerging as important
pathological mediators of ARDS in COVID-19 (23). Histopathological analysis of lung tissue from
autopsies of patients who have succumbed to COVID-19 have consistently shown that neutrophil
infiltration in the lungs is closely associated with NETs release, as well as downstream sequelae
including microvascular immunothrombosis (11–14). Quantitative assessment of surrogate
markers of NETs in the bloodstream including DNA-MPO complexes and citrullinated histone-3
have suggested that higher NETs production is directly correlated with disease severity, and may
even predict patients who will progress from mild to severe disease (21, 22). This is consistent
with our observation that neutrophils from patients with COVID-19 are primed to produce NETs,
and that there was a trend towards higher mortality in patients who produced high levels of NETs.
The exact mechanisms that propagate NETs production during severe COVID-19 remain an active
area of investigation, and may include direct stimulation and/or infection of neutrophils by SARSCoV-2, as well as autoantibody-mediated stabilization of NETs structures in vivo (12, 26). Our
data suggest that the majority of neutrophils in patients with severe COVID-19 display a mature
and functionally active phenotype and are intrinsically primed to release NETs, which differs
markedly from neutrophils in non-COVID ARDS, further underpinning the potential importance
of this stereotyped immune response to the unique pathogenesis of COVID-19.
The findings of this study lend further support to the potential therapeutic utility of targeting
pathological neutrophil mechanisms, including NETs, for the treatment of COVID-19 ARDS (23).
In particular, we found that dexamethasone treatment did not modulate the functional landscape
of neutrophils nor attenuate the production of NETs. This is in line with a recent pre-print
publication suggesting that dexamethasone does not alter the NETs-related neutrophil proteome in
patients with severe COVID-19 (27). Of note, our findings do not rule out the possibility that
dexamethasone modulates other aspects of neutrophil development or activation in vivo, as has
been suggested using transcriptomic analysis of the circulating neutrophil pool in severe COVID19 (28). Together, these data suggest that neutrophil-mediated pathogenesis including augmented

NETs production may escape the treatment effect of dexamethasone, and therefore represent a
promising avenue for therapeutic adjuncts to supplement current treatment regimens.
Lastly, this study also uncovers a number of outstanding questions regarding the role of neutrophils
in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and ARDS. First, our study focuses on the immune landscape
in the bloodstream compartment, but understanding the implications of our findings within the
lung microenvironment may reveal important features of tissue-specific neutrophil responses in
COVID-19. A recent study of the single cell landscape of lung immunity in SARS-CoV-2
infection, including spatially-resolved profiling with imaging mass cytometry, also observed a
distinct pattern of neutrophil infiltration in the lungs of patients with severe COVID-19 compared
to non-COVID pneumonia (9). However, much remains to be learned about whether there is
selective recruitment of specific neutrophil populations to the lungs in COVID-19 (eg. NETsproducing neutrophils), as well as defining the molecular mechanisms of neutrophil recruitment
within the pulmonary microvasculature. Indeed, it was recently reported that neutrophil
recruitment to the lungs in ARDS utilizes a unique adhesion molecule (DPEP-1), which is now
being targeting in clinical trials for moderate to severe COVID-19 (ClinicalTrials.gov
NCT04402957) (29). In addition, outstanding questions remain about the molecular mechanisms
that program the systemic neutrophil landscape in COVID-19, as well as further defining the
mechanisms that elicit pathological NETs release within the lung tissues. Finally, our modest
sample size was necessary to enable deep profiling of neutrophil phenotypes and functions, but
limits our ability to address their impact on clinical outcomes. Although we did observe an
association between neutrophil priming and high NETs production with mortality in COVID-19
ARDS, a larger study will be required to confirm the impact of our findings on adverse clinical
outcomes in severe COVID-19 (degree of hypoxemia, illness severity, multi-organ dysfunction,
thrombotic complications, and death). However, the demonstration of a functionally distinct
neutrophil landscape in COVID-19 that escapes conventional therapy with dexamethasone
provides further support for the ongoing efforts to develop neutrophil/NETs-targeted therapies to
treat COVID-19 ARDS.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants or most appropriate surrogate
decision maker for patients who were unable to provide consent. Between April 1 2020 and March
30 2021, consecutive patients were screened for the following inclusion criteria: adult patients
(>18 years of age) with an index admission to one of four multi-system intensive care units in
Calgary, AB, Canada, with a diagnosis of ARDS based on the Berlin Criteria (30), associated with
a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection (based on clinical laboratory qPCR assay from
nasopharyngeal swab or endotracheal tube aspirate) or bacterial pneumonia (based on standard
clinical and microbiologic criteria). Exclusion criteria included pre-existing immunocompromised
state (immunomodulatory therapy, chemotherapy, HIV infection, other congenital or acquired
immunodefiency), re-admission to ICU or prior study enrollment, ARDS due to another cause,
goals of care that excluded life-support interventions, or moribund patients not expected to survive
>72 hours. Blood samples were collected from enrolled patients with COVID-19 (n=21) and nonCOVID (n=10) ARDS after admission to ICU on days 1 and 7 (for those who survived and
remained in ICU). Blood samples were also collected from healthy volunteers for use as controls.
This study was approved by the conjoint health research ethics board of the University of Calgary
and Alberta Health Services (REB18-1294).
Time-of-flight mass cytometry and analysis
Whole blood samples used for mass cytometry analysis were cryopreserved in PROT1 proteomic
stabilizer (SmartTube) at a ratio of 1:1.4 and stored at -80ºC to enable batched analysis of patient
samples as previously described (31). Samples were thawed at room temperature, followed by
RBC lysis using PROT1 RBC lysis buffer (SmartTube), and white blood cells were washed in
cell staining medium (PBS with 1% BSA) followed by labelling with a custom metal-conjugated
antibody panel (supplementary table 1). First, cells were incubated with metal-conjugated
surface antibodies, followed by fixation and permeabilized (BD Cytofix-Cytoperm), and
incubation with intracellular antibodies. Finally, cells were incubated overnight in a solution

containin Cell-ID iridium intercalator (Fluidigm), 0.3% saponin, and 1.6% paraformaldehyde in
PBS. Cells were then mixed with EQ Four Element Calibration Beads (Fluidigm), and acquired
on a Helios CyTOFII mass cytometer (DVS). Mass cytometry data was normalized using the
internal Helios CyTOFII bead-based normalization software (DVS).
For mass cytometry data analysis, FCS files were imported into Cytobank (Cytobank.org) for data
visualization and manual gating. Single-cell events were then exported from CytoBank as FCS
files and loaded into the CATALYST package (32) in R (R Development Core Team). For
neutrophil clustering and analysis, CD45+CD66b+ neutrophils were analyzed by FlowSOM (33)
and a Consensus Clustering method (34) was employed on all neutrophil single-cell events within
CATALYST based on the expression of neutrophil markers (see Fig 1C). To determine the optimal
number of metaclusters, we compared the change in the area under the curve of the CDF plot for
each additional metacluster added (delta_area function; CATALYST). Using this method, we
identified 11 neutrophil metaclusters. Very rare metaclusters (represented less than 0.5% of total
neutrophils) were excluded from the analysis, leaving 8 metaclusters in the analysis. To visualize
the neutrophil metacluster landscape, tSNE dimensionality reduction was performed on 2,500
randomly selected events from each sample using a perplexity of 70 for 5000 iterations. Data
visualization was generated using the built-in functions of CATALYST and the ggplot2 package
in R.
Plasma and neutrophil isolation
Blood samples collected in heparinized tubes were centrifuged at 450 g and pelleted blood cells
were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and neutrophils were isolated using a two
density histopaque gradient (1.119 g/mL and 1.077 g/mL; Sigma cat. 11191 and 10771,
respectively) with centrifugation at 400 g for 20 minutes at 20 °C without braking. The layer of
neutrophils (second layer) was collected, red blood cells were lysed, and isolated neutrophils were
resuspended in RPMI containing 0.05% of human serum albumin at a final concentration of 1x107
neutrophils/mL. Neutrophil viability was >98% as determine by trypan blue staining. Of note, not
all patient samples yielded sufficient quantities of neutrophils to conduct every ex vivo neutrophil
assays, but every effort was made to include as many patients as possible in all assays.

NETs release assay
Isolated neutrophils (5 x 104) were seeded into sterile 96-well optical plates (Falcon) and allowed
to settle for 5 minutes at room temperature. The cells were incubated under the following
conditions: unstimulated, 0.1 µM PMA, or 1 x 106 CFU of S.aureus MW2 for 3 hours at 37°C
with 5% CO2. To assess NET release in response to patient plasma, the isolated neutrophils from
healthy volunteers were incubated with 5% patient plasma containing 5mM EDTA for 3 hours at
37°C with 5% CO2. Cells were then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA) overnight, and then
stained with Sytox Orange (Thermofisher) to visualize extracellular DNA NETs and imaged on
an inverted spinning disk confocal microscope with a 10X objective. The quantity of NETs
release was determined by measuring that visualized area covered by extracellular DNA NETs
per field of view.
Reactive oxygen species production assay
Isolated neutrophils (1x106) were incubated with luminol (50uM) in the presence of superoxide
dismutase (75 ug/ml), catalase (2000 U/ml), and horsedarish peroxidase (20 U/ml), in an opaque
96 well plate. In some experiments, neutrophils were co-incubated with S. aureus MW2 (1 x 106
CFU). Chemiluminescence was read using Spectramax i3x instrument (Molecular Devices, San
Jose, Ca, USA) every 1 minute for 120 minutes.
Phagocytosis assay
Methicillin-resistant S.aureus MW2, constitutively expressing EGFP, was grown o/n in Brain
Heart Infusion broth supplemented with 10 μg/mL chloramphenicol. On the day of the experiment,
the strain was sub-cultured to late log phase (OD660nm 1.0), washed, and resuspended in RPMIcontaining 0.05% human serum albumin. Subsequently, 2×105 isolated neutrophils were mixed
with 1x106 bacteria (MOI=5) in the presence of various concentrations of normal human pooled
serum (15 donors) in a final volume of 200 μL of RPMI containing 0.05% HAS, and incubated at
37°C with agitation for 15 min. The cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and

phagocytosis was measured using flow cytometry (FACS Canto). Neutrophils were gated based
on their forward and side scatter profiles, and bacterial phagocytosis was measured by as the
percentage of neutrophils positive for GFP+ bacteria using FlowJo software (FloJo, BD
Biosciences).
Statistics
Non-parametric data are represented as median +/- interquartile range, and analyzed using MannWhitney U test (when comparing 2 groups), or Kruskal-Wallis Test with post-hoc Dunn’s test for
multiple comparisons (when comparing more than 2 groups). Parametric data are represented with
mean +/- SEM, and analyzed using student’s T test (when comparing 2 groups), or one-way
ANOVA with post-hoc Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons when more than 2 groups
were compared. Principal component analysis of neutrophil markers expression between patient
groups was performed using the procomp function and VEGAN package in R, and plotted using
ggplot2. PERMANOVA analysis of the Bray-Curtis distances between individual samples was
used to compare PCA ordinations. Statistical analysis and graphic generation were performed
using Graphpad Prism (GraphPad Software) and R (R Development Core Team).
