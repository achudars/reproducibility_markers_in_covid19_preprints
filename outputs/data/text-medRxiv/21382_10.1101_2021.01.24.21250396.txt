Abstract
We aimed to estimate, albeit crudely and provisionally, national, regional, and global proportions
of respective populations that have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, and to assess infection
morbidity and mortality rates, factoring both documented and undocumented infections. The
estimates were generated by applying mathematical models to 159 countries and territories. The
percentage of the world’s population that has been infected as of 31 December 2020 was
estimated at 12.56% (95% CI: 11.17-14.05%). It was lowest in the Western Pacific Region at
0.66% (95% CI: 0.59-0.75%) and highest in the Americas at 41.92% (95% CI: 37.95-46.09%).
The global infection fatality rate was 10.73 (95% CI: 10.21-11.29) per 10,000 infections.
Globally per 1,000 infections, the infection acute-care bed hospitalization rate was 19.22 (95%
CI: 18.73-19.51), the infection ICU bed hospitalization rate was 4.14 (95% CI: 4.10-4.18), the
infection severity rate was 6.27 (95% CI: 6.18-6.37), and the infection criticality rate was 2.26
(95% CI: 2.24-2.28). If left unchecked with no interventions, the pandemic would eventually
cause 8.18 million (95% CI: 7.30-9.18) deaths, 163.67 million (95% CI: 148.12-179.51) acutecare hospitalizations, 33.01 million (95% CI: 30.52-35.70) ICU hospitalizations, 50.23 million
(95% CI: 46.24-54.67) severe cases, and 17.62 million (95% CI: 16.36-18.97) critical cases. The
global population remains far below the herd immunity threshold and at risk of repeated waves
of infection. Global epidemiology reveals immense regional variation in infection exposure and
morbidity and mortality rates.

INTRODUCTION
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic continues to be a
global health challenge with profound adverse consequences for human health, societies, and
economies [1]. While our understanding of the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection and its
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease burden has progressed in the year since it
emerged, two questions remain largely unanswered.
1. “To what extent have populations of individual countries and the global population been
infected by this virus, regardless of whether those infections have been documented?”
Infections include documented cases involving laboratory-confirmed diagnosis and
undocumented asymptomatic or mild cases. While a growing number of serological surveys
are being conducted to answer this question [2-10], the scope, scale, and geographic coverage
of such studies remain limited.
2. “What are the true national and global COVID-19 morbidity and mortality rates, that is
factoring all documented and undocumented infections?”
Recent scientific developments furnish an opportunity to provide answers, albeit crude
approximations, to these questions. The growing number of serological surveys and analyses of
national databases for this infection have shown that only about one in every ten infections have
actually been diagnosed [2-11]. Moreover, a recent comprehensive analysis assessed the true
infection morbidity and mortality rates for each age group, factoring both documented and
undocumented infections [12].
Building on these developments, the objective of this study was to provide key provisional
epidemiologic estimates nationally, regionally, and globally. These include estimates of the

proportion of each population that has been already infected, estimates for the average incidence
rate of this infection since epidemic onset, and estimates for overall (total population) infection
acute-care and intensive-care-unit (ICU) hospitalization rates, infection severity and criticality
rates, and infection fatality rate.

METHODS
Definitions of epidemiologic outcome measures
Two criteria for classifying infection morbidity were used: one based on hospital admissions
(acute-care or ICU) and one based on clinical presentations, as per the World Health
Organization (WHO) classifications of disease severity (Table 1) [13]. While the two measures
overlap, with severe cases typically admitted to acute-care beds and critical cases admitted to
ICU beds, mild or moderately ill COVID-19 cases are sometimes hospitalized out of caution,
because of other, concurrent indications, or as a form of isolation [12].
Three types of outcomes were estimated nationally, regionally, and globally (Table 1). The first
two include infection morbidity and mortality rates, calculated as the cumulative number of a
disease outcome (such as COVID-19 hospitalization or death) over the estimated cumulative
number of infections, documented and undocumented. The third type includes two kinds of
infection occurrence metrics, the proportion of the population that has been already infected and
the infection incidence rate, both as of December 31, 2020.

The overall (total population) infection acute-care and ICU hospitalization rates, infection
severity and criticality rates, and infection fatality rate were estimated for each country by
applying the recently estimated age-stratified rates for these outcomes [12] to the population
age-structure of each country. Age-stratified rates were based on a detailed analysis of the
epidemic in Qatar [12] using data from a series of serological surveys [8-10] and extensive timeseries and age-stratified data for PCR laboratory-confirmed infections, PCR testing positivity
rate, antibody testing positivity rate, PCR surveys, daily hospital admissions in acute-care and
ICU beds, hospital occupancy in acute-care and ICU beds, incidence of severe and critical
infections, as per WHO classifications [13], and COVID-19 deaths as per WHO guidelines [14].
Qatar has one of the world’s most extensive databases to document this epidemic and its toll at
the national level [15], such that Qatar’s epidemic has been one of the most thoroughly
investigated and best characterized [8-12, 15-21].
It is presently unknown whether the infection morbidity and mortality rates for each age group
(not for the total population) vary considerably from one country to another. These rates
probably reflect primarily the basic biology of this infection more than the COVID-19 response
or other factors in each country or population. The aim of the present study is to provide crude
estimates for these rates in the total population of each country by factoring the population age
structure, given the prominent role of age in the epidemiology of this pandemic [22-25], while
future studies investigate and elaborate possible variations in these rates across different
countries and populations.
Infection morbidity and mortality rates were estimated for each country and territory with a
population size >1 million, as of 2020. In total, estimates were generated for 159 countries and
territories, virtually covering the world population [26]. Population sizes and demographic age5

structures were extracted from the United Nations World Population Prospects database [26]. In
each setting, rates were derived by weighting each rate in each age group by the proportion of the
population in that age group, and then summing the contributions of all age groups.
Incidence rate and proportion of the population infected
Two methods were used to derive the proportion of the population infected in each country and
the average incidence rate since onset of the epidemic as of the end of 2020. The final estimate
for each of these measures was based on the average of the estimates of both methods, to
minimize the effect of potential bias inherent in each method.
Reported COVID-19 deaths method
The first method was based on the reported number of COVID-19 deaths in each country, as per
the WHO COVID-19 Dashboard [27]. The proportion of the population infected, irrespective of
whether the infection was documented or undocumented, was estimated using the following
expressions:
Proportion of the population infected =

Cumulative number of infections
Total population size

 Number of reported deaths  

HAQ Index
Cumulative number of infections = 


Infection fatality rate

  Highest HAQ Index globaly 

Since COVID-19 mortality may be affected by access to and quality of healthcare, with higher
mortality for inferior access and quality, this method adjusts for these factors by utilizing the
Global Burden of Disease study’s Healthcare Access and Quality (HAQ) Index for each country
and territory [28]. The HAQ Index provides a score ranging between 0–100 [28].
The above expressions still require adjustment for the average time delay between onset of
infection and COVID-19 death, estimated from studies in different countries at about 20 days

[29-32]. That adjustment was incorporated by assuming that the above estimated proportion of
the population infected occurred 20 days earlier than the current time t. Then the average
incidence rate of infection (  ), from the onset of the epidemic (at time t0) until the present time
(time t), was derived using the expression:
Proportion of the population infected

( ( t − 20 days ) − t ) = 1 − e  ((
−

t − 20 days ) −t0 )

0

The time t0 was set as the day of the first reported COVID-19 case in each country [27]. The
derived incidence rate was then used to estimate the proportion of the population infected at the
time of this study, by applying the same expression, but at time t (that is at December 31, 2020),
instead of t − 20 days .
Reported COVID-19 cases method
The second method was based on the reported cumulative number of laboratory-confirmed
SARS-CoV-2 infections as of December 31, 2020, as reported in the WHO COVID-19
Dashboard [27]. The cumulative number of infections, documented and undocumented, was
estimated using the following expression:
 Cumulative number of documented infections 
Cumulative number of infections = 

Infection detection rate



The infection detection rate is defined as the proportion of all infections that were actually
diagnosed and laboratory-confirmed. Serological surveys and extensive analyses have shown
that only about one in every ten actual infections is ever diagnosed [2-10]. Given the quality
estimate for the infection detection rate in the well-characterized epidemic of Qatar, based on a
series of serological surveys [8-10] and analyses of national databases, a value of 11.1% (95%
uncertainty interval: 10.8-11.3%) was assumed for the infection detection rate [11, 12].

However, to account for variation in the quality of SARS-CoV-2 testing across countries, this
estimate was adjusted using the HAQ Index [28]:
 Infection detection rate  

HAQ Index
Infection detection rate in each country = 


 in reference country   HAQ Index in reference country 

With the above expressions, and Qatar as the reference country, a second estimate was generated
for each country of the proportion of the total population infected and the average incidence rate
since epidemic onset.
Uncertainty analysis
The 95% credible interval (CI) for each estimated epidemiologic outcome measure was derived
by factoring the uncertainty interval of each variable used in the above equations and combining
the uncertainties so as to generate the widest credible interval for each estimate.
Reporting of estimates
The various estimated epidemiologic outcome measures and the 95% CI were reported by
country or territory, regionally by WHO region, and globally. The WHO regions include the
African Region (AFRO), the Region of the Americas (AMRO), the Eastern Mediterranean
Region (EMRO), the European Region (EURO), the South-East Asia Region (SEARO), and the
Western Pacific Region (WPRO) [33] (Figure 1).
Mathematical modeling analyses were conducted in MATLAB R2019a (Boston/MA/USA) [34].

The various estimated outcome measures for each country and territory are listed in Tables S1S6 in the Supporting Information. An overview of results by WHO region and globally is
provided below.
The estimated infection acute-care bed hospitalization rate, infection ICU bed hospitalization
rate, infection severity rate, and infection criticality rate were lowest in AFRO and highest in
EURO, with substantial variation across regions (Figure 2). Globally, the infection acute-care
bed hospitalization rate was 19.22 (95% CI: 18.73-19.51) per 1,000 infections, the infection ICU
bed hospitalization rate was 4.14 (95% CI: 4.10-4.18) per 1,000 infections, the infection severity
rate was 6.27 (95% CI: 6.18-6.37) per 1,000 infections, and the infection criticality rate was 2.26
(95% CI: 2.24-2.28) per 1,000 infections. Meanwhile, the infection total hospitalization rate was
23.36 (95% CI: 22.83-23.69) per 1,000 infections and the infection total severity rate was 8.53
(95% CI: 8.42-8.65) per 1,000 infections (Figure 2).
The estimated infection fatality rate per 10,000 infections, was lowest in AFRO at 3.57 (95% CI:
3.39-3.76), followed by EMRO at 5.40 (95% CI: 5.09-5.64), SEARO at 7.64 (95% CI: 7.268.05), AMRO at 13.80 (95% CI: 13.13-14.51), WPRO at 13.92 (95% CI: 13.24-14.65), and
highest in EURO at 20.19 (95% CI: 19.23-21.21) (Figure 3). Globally, the infection fatality rate
was 10.73 (95% CI: 10.21-11.29) per 10,000 infections.
The estimated incidence rate, across WHO regions and globally, using the reported deaths
method was higher than that using the reported cases method, for all regions other than SEARO
(Figure 4A). The averaged incidence rate, per 10,000 person-weeks, was lowest in WPRO at 1.4
(95% CI: 1.2-1.6), followed by AFRO at 8.7 (95% CI: 7.2-10.5), SEARO at 18.1 (95% CI: 15.620.8), EMRO at 40.5 (95% CI: 33.4-49.7), EURO at 67.4 (95% CI: 58.8-77.1), and highest in

AMRO at 131.7 (95% CI: 113.6-154.2) (Figure 4B). Globally, the averaged incidence rate was
35.4 (95% CI: 30.5-41.4) per 10,000 person-weeks.
The estimated percentage of the population infected by the end of 2020, across WHO regions
and globally was also higher using the reported deaths method than using the reported cases
method, for all regions except SEARO (Figure 5A). The averaged percentage of the population
infected was lowest in WPRO at 0.66% (95% CI: 0.59-0.75%), followed by AFRO at 3.25%
(95% CI: 2.75-3.84%), SEARO at 8.11% (95% CI: 7.05-9.24%), EMRO at 13.67% (95% CI:
11.83-15.75%), EURO at 25.48% (95% CI: 22.76-28.40%), and highest in AMRO at 41.91%
(95% CI: 37.95-46.09%) (Figure 5B). Globally, the averaged percentage of the population
infected was estimated at 12.56% (95% CI: 11.17-14.05%).
As of December 31, 2020, 1.79 million COVID-19 deaths had been reported, but the percentage
of the global population infected was estimated at only 12.56% (95% CI: 11.17-14.05%). If the
global population is to reach herd immunity with no vaccination, conservatively estimated at 6070% infection exposure [10, 35, 36], then a cumulative total of 8.18 million (95% CI: 7.30-9.18
million) COVID-19 deaths would occur by the time herd immunity is reached. Also, by then, a
cumulative total of 163.67 million (95% CI: 148.12-179.51) acute-care hospitalizations, 33.01
million (95% CI: 30.52-35.70) ICU hospitalizations, 50.23 million (95% CI: 46.24-54.67) severe
COVID-19 cases, and 17.62 million (95% CI: 16.36-18.97) COVID-19 critical cases would have
occurred.

The above results suggest that only 13% of the world’s population has been infected by SARSCoV-2, even though an entire year has already passed since the epidemic emerged in Wuhan,
Hubei Province, China, in December, 2019 [37, 38]. This demonstrates that the overall global
population remains far below the herd immunity threshold, estimated at 60-70% infection
exposure (if not more for the mutant viral strains) [10, 35, 36], and is still at risk of repeated
epidemic waves of infection, with all that entails in terms of disease burden and social and
economic disruption. This finding highlights the urgent need to accelerate COVID-19
vaccination to avert global expansion of this infection.
Though overall exposure to this infection remains relatively low, there are immense variations by
region and country, and the Americas appear to have already reached ~40% exposure, over 60fold higher than the Western Pacific Region (<1%). The average incidence rate experienced
since epidemic onset varies similarly and is highest in the Americas, at 132 per 10,000 personweeks and lowest in the Western Pacific Region at only 1 per 10,000 person-weeks. These
findings demonstrate strikingly high variability in the intensity of national epidemics during the
first year since this infection’s introduction. It remains to be seen whether this variability reflects
different national responses to the epidemics, and/or clinical or biological cofactors that make
some populations more affected than others.
Even though the same age-stratified infection morbidity and mortality rates were used in
generating estimates for all countries, total-population morbidity and mortality rates varied
hugely among countries and by region, only because of differences in population age structures.
For instance, the infection fatality rate in the European Region of 20 per 10,000 infections was
nearly 6-fold higher than that in the African Region at <4 per 10,000 infections. Similarly,
infection hospitalization and severity rates varied enormously. These findings may explain

apparent variability in the severity of this infection across countries and regions, and suggest that
the disease burden could be substantially lower in countries with younger demographics, such as
the African or Eastern Mediterranean Regions, as suggested earlier [23].
Notwithstanding this global variability, the above results corroborate the vast disease burden that
this infection can cause. Nearly two million deaths have been confirmed worldwide as of
December 31, 2020 [27], though only 13% of the global population has been infected. If we were
to adopt today a herd immunity approach to dealing with this pandemic worldwide, that is,
achieving the herd immunity threshold without vaccination, the pandemic would cause a total of
8 million COVID-19 deaths, 68 million COVID-19 severe and critical disease cases, and 197
million hospitalizations. These findings affirm the wisdom of epidemic suppression approaches
adopted in most countries to tackle their respective epidemics [39].
Despite the high potential disease burden, the above-estimated infection morbidity and mortality
rates are still substantially lower than those estimated earlier in the epidemic [6, 40-44].
Globally, out of every 10,000 infections, only 11 would result in COVID-19 deaths. Out of every
1,000 infections, only 6 would be severe and only 2 would be critical per WHO classification
[13]. Nineteen would be hospitalized in an acute-care bed and 4 in an ICU bed.
This study has limitations. In essence, it was based on age-stratified infection morbidity and
mortality rates and the infection detection rate, estimated for a well-characterized and thoroughly
investigated national epidemic, in which about half the population has already been infected [812, 15-21]. While the epidemic of Qatar is perhaps the world’s most advanced SARS-CoV-2
epidemic [8-12, 15-21], the extent to which fundamental infection metrics estimated with
precision for one country, even if they are primarily determined by the basic biology of this
infection, can be extrapolated to other countries, remains unknown. It is reasonable that these

metrics could be affected by myriad factors, such as clinical or biological variations in human
populations and circulating viral strains, the nature of COVID-19 responses, coverage of SARSCoV-2 testing, and quality of reporting of cases and deaths. For instance, infection exposure is
likely overestimated for countries with higher testing coverage and underestimated for countries
with lower coverage. However, to make these estimates as realistic as possible, we used two
independent methods with different input data to estimate infection exposure, to minimize the
effect of any potential bias in either method or its data input. We also adjusted estimates for
variation in healthcare access and quality by utilizing the Global Burden of Disease study’s
Healthcare Access and Quality Index for each country [28]. Still, the provided estimates should
be seen as provisional, crude estimates for the purpose of providing a broad understanding of the
global epidemiology of this infection and to guide the global COVID-19 response.
CONCLUSION
Only 13% of the global population has been infected with SARS-CoV-2 suggesting that the
world’s population remains far below the herd immunity threshold and at risk of repeated
epidemic waves of infection. Nevertheless, global epidemiology demonstrates immense regional
variation in both infection exposure and SARS-CoV-2 morbidity and mortality rates. While the
pandemic’s expansion in nations with young populations could lead to a relatively milder disease
burden than current expectations, this infection has the potential to cause nearly ten million
COVID-19 deaths and 200 million hospitalizations worldwide, if its transmission is left
unchecked and vaccination scale-up continues to lag far behind global needs.
