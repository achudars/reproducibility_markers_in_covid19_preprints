ABSTRACT

29

COVID-19 is one of the largest public health emergencies in modern history. Here we present a

30

detailed analysis from a large population center in Southern California (Orange County,

31

population of 3.2 million) to understand heterogeneity in risks of infection, test positivity, and

32

death. We used a combination of datasets, including a population-representative seroprevalence

33

survey, to assess the true burden of disease as well as COVID-19 testing intensity, test positivity,

34

and mortality. In the first month of the local epidemic, case incidence clustered in high income

35

areas. This pattern quickly shifted, with cases next clustering in much higher rates in the north-

36

central area which has a lower socio-economic status. Since April, a concentration of reported

37

cases, test positivity, testing intensity, and seropositivity in a north-central area persisted. At the

38

individual level, several factors (e.g., age, race/ethnicity, zip codes with low educational

39

attainment) strongly affected risk of seropositivity and death.

INTRODUCTION
In late 2019 an epidemic of respiratory disease (coronavirus disease 19 or COVID-19),

52

53

caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China, and rapidly spread

54

worldwide. COVID-19 has manifested in different ways across social, economic, and

55

demographic groups, with regard to apparent risk of infection, disease severity, and mortality (1–

56

3). The elderly and those with co-morbidities are at the highest risk of severe disease (4). Many

57

hospitalized patients require supplemental oxygen or ventilators (5), and there is a high mortality

58

rate among those who are hospitalized (6). In many places healthcare facilities have been

59

overwhelmed by a surge in cases and have fallen short of needed ventilators and ICU beds,

60

resulting in massive morbidity and mortality(7,8). Availability of tests and operational barriers

61

were limiting factors for diagnosis in parts of the U.S. during the early months of the pandemic

62

(9).

63

California is the most populous state in the U.S., with an estimated 39.5 million

64

inhabitants. Orange County (OC) is a coastal county in California, and the sixth most populous

65

county in the country, with an estimated 3.2 million inhabitants). The first confirmed case in

66

California (3rd in the U.S.) was reported from OC. On January 31 the WHO declared a Global

67

Health Emergency, and on February 3rd the U.S. declared a public health emergency. Subsequent

68

cases were reported in California in February, mostly among travelers. On February 26th, local

69

(‘community’) transmission was first confirmed in the United States in northern California. OC

70

had only 2 reported cases in February. By March 11 another 6 cases had been reported in OC. On

71

March 12 there were 8 reported cases; followed by 23 on March 13; 11 each day on March 14

72

and 15; and 32 on March 16. This surge in cases in mid-March in OC and other counties in

73

California triggered emergency orders by the Governor and the County Health Officer at the

74

Orange County Health Care Agency, prohibiting public or private gatherings and also leading to

75

school and business closures (10). Though many businesses were closed at this time, the

76

mandated social distancing measures had exceptions in place for individuals working in

77

“essential jobs,” which was broadly defined and included medical professionals, food providers,

78

delivery agencies, public officials, contractors, and building laborers (11). The social and

79

economic characteristics of individuals working essential jobs likely differs from the overall

80

population.
Almost half of OC residents over the age of five speak a language other than English at

81

82

home. Additionally, many within the Hispanic/Latino and Asian communities of OC live below

83

the poverty level (17.9% and 16%, respectively) and face challenges in education, household

84

income, access to healthcare, health disparities, and life expectancy (12,13). The relatively small

85

land area, high population density, and diverse population of OC provides a unique opportunity

86

to explore potentially important social, economic, and demographic correlates of COVID-19

87

epidemiology.
Here we present results from a detailed spatiotemporal epidemiological analysis of

88

89

COVID-19 in OC, California. First, we draw from reported tests and mortality from the county

90

health agency. Given that passively detected cases are prone toward bias, in July we also

91

conducted a seroprevalence survey to assess the true burden of disease in the county. In our

92

analyses we leverage both datasets to compare predictors of test positivity, mortality, and

93

seropositivity over the first 6 months of the epidemic.

Case and Mortality data.
Case data were provided through a memorandum of understanding with the Orange
County Health Care Agency (OCHCA) and consisted of individual level records of all negative

100

and positive PCR tests conducted throughout the county from March 1 through August 16, 2020

101

(this date aligns with our cross-sectional seroprevalence survey which completed on August 16).

102

OCHCA receives testing data from the California Reportable Disease Information Exchange

103

(CalREDIE), an infectious disease surveillance system implemented by the California

104

Department of Public Health (CDPH) [14]. The data include information on test date, age,

105

gender, race, ethnicity, and zip code of the individual taking the test. For individuals who had

106

repeat PCR testing after testing positive, only the first positive diagnosis was included in our

107

analyses. Mortality data were also provided by OCHCA and consisted of individual-level records

108

of deaths attributed to COVID-19.

109

110

111

Seroprevalence data.
Participants for the serological survey were recruited using a proprietary database

112

maintained by SoapBoxSample, an LRW Group Company. The database is intended to be

113

representative of the age, income, and racial/ethnic diversity of OC. Participants were contacted

114

by email or phone. We recruited one participant per household to participate in a survey on their

115

thoughts and opinions regarding COVID-19. The survey included questions on socio-

116

demographics, occupation, social activities, any illness or symptoms in the last few months, and

117

whether the individual had been diagnosed with COVID-19. After completing this portion of the

118

survey, each eligible participant was asked if they would be willing to participate in a drive-thru

119

blood test for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Eligibility for antibody testing was restricted to a quota

120

sample designed to be demographically representative of the county as a whole. Recruitment to

121

the antibody test was delayed to the end of the questionnaire in order to avoid biasing the

122

serological survey toward individuals who believe that they were infected with SARS-CoV-2.

123

There were a total of 10 field sites for drive-through blood tests, dispersed throughout OC in

124

order to minimize driving distances for participants. The seroprevalence study design and overall

125

findings for OC are described in more detail elsewhere (14).

126

127

128

Serological test.
We used a coronavirus antigen microarray to classify participants from the serological

129

survey as seropositive or seronegative. The array tests for both IgG and IgM and contains 12

130

antigens from SARS-CoV-2 (described in detail at (15)).

131

132

133

Zip-code level socio-demographic data.
At the zip-code level we included median household income, the percentage of adults

134

above age 25 who have at least a bachelor’s degree, and the percentage of adults who have had

135

insurance in the previous 5 years. These data come from the 2018 American Community Survey

136

of 2018 (extracted from (12)).

Analysis.

139

Descriptive Spatiotemporal Data Analysis.

140

Reported cases and number of tests were aggregated at the zip code level and by week. A

141

total of 85 zip codes were included in the analysis. For plotting cases on OC maps, the data were

142

further aggregated by months (March through August). Case incidence was calculated and

143

mapped as positive cases per 100,000 population per week. Testing intensity was calculated and

144

mapped as total number of tests per 100,000 people per week. Test positivity was calculated and

145

mapped as the percentage of positive tests for each month.

146

Formal testing of spatial autocorrelation was done using the global Moran’s I statistic and

147

spatial correlograms. Both identify the presence and extent of clustering or dispersion. Local

148

clustering statistics (Local Indicators of Spatial Autocorrelation or LISA (16)) were then used to

149

visualize the location of clusters. All tests were run for case incidence, test positivity, and test

150

intensity. Seropositivity was also mapped and assessed using LISA statistics (since this was a

151

cross sectional survey there is no time component).

152

153

154

Relational Analysis of COVID-19 Test Positivity, Mortality, and Seropositivity.
We used logistic regressions to explore geographic, demographic, economic, and

155

epidemiological predictors of the odds of testing positive for COVID-19, of dying from COVID-

156

19, and of being seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Predictors in our models are listed in

157

Supplementary Table 1 and included: age group, gender, and race/ethnicity at the individual

158

level. Zip code level predictors included: median household income, the percentage of adults

159

over age 25 with at least a bachelor’s degree, the percentage of adults who have had insurance in

160

the previous 5 years, and population density (individuals per square kilometer).

161

Several specifications were tested for model fit, interpretability, and parsimony. Through

162

preliminary exploratory analyses we noted that the first cases were reported from coastal zip-

163

codes but that this pattern had shifted inland over time. Given the changing dynamics over time,

164

we explored different specifications for ‘time’ in the model for test positivity. The best fitting

165

model included a smoothed interaction term for time (coded by day, Supplemental Table 1) and

166

median household income at the zip code level.

167

The same predictors were included in the model for mortality, save for the interaction

168

between time and median household income (which did not improve model performance). Given

169

reports of increased mortality related to hospital bed shortages, we also included as a predictor

170

the number of ICU beds occupied by suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients on the day that

171

an individual tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.

172

We compared three seropositivity models, with various combinations of individual and

173

zip-code level predictors (see details in Supplementary Appendix A). All model results are

174

presented as model adjusted odds ratios (AORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Model

175

summary statistics, including model Bayesian Information Criterion are presented in

Software.
Maps were created using QGIS version 3.4.9. Tests for spatial autocorrelation were done

180

using GeoDa version 1.14.0. All other analyses were conducted using R statistical software

181

version 3.5.2.

RESULTS
A total of 597,922 tests were reported to OCHCA up to August 16, 2020. After dropping

185

repeated tests and those with incomplete data, 318,492 individuals were included. Of these

186

individuals, 36,816 tested positive for COVID-19 and 1,248 died from the disease. In the

188

seropositive.

189

190

Spatial patterns in reported COVID-19 cases, testing intensity, and seropositivity
The global Moran’s I statistics and spatial correlograms indicated significant clustering in

191

192

reported cases and testing intensity in the first month (March) of the local epidemic (Table 1;

193

Supplementary Figures 3 and 4). Conversely, there was no detectable clustering of test

194

positivity in March (Table 1, Supplementary Figure 5). The highest reported case incidence in

195

March was along the central coast and southern portion of the county (Figure 1 A). The LISA

196

statistics indicated statistically significant clustering of high incidence zip codes in the central

197

coast area (Figure 1 B). This clustering of case incidence overlaps with clustering of test

198

intensity in March (Figure 2 A and B).
Clustering of both reported cases and test positivity increased in magnitude in May

199

200

(Table 1 and Supplementary Figures 3 and 5). While clustering in test intensity (Table 1;

201

Supplemental Figure 4) was high in March, it decreased in May as access to testing spread

202

throughout much of the county. Clustering in testing intensity increased again in June and July

203

(centered on the hotspots in the north-central part of the county, evident in Figures 1 and 3). By

204

April, case incidence, testing intensity, and test positivity had all shifted to a growing cluster in

205

the north-central part of the county. Zip code level seropositivity also revealed a cluster in the

206

north-central part of OC (Figure 4), especially in the city of Santa Ana (Supplementary Figure

207

1).

211

Factors associated with testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection
Age was a strong predictor of testing positive. Individuals in the 10-14 and 15-19 age

212

groups had the highest odds of testing positive (both with approximately 2.2 times the odds of

213

testing positive in comparison to the 0 – 4 age group (Table 2 and Figure 5)). Males had 1.2

214

times the odds of testing positive (95% CI: 1.18 – 1.23). Individuals who identified as Hispanic

215

or Latino had 1.7 times the odds of testing positive (CI: 1.63 – 1.79) when compared to whites,

216

while Asian (AOR: 0.52; CI: 0.49 – 0.55), Black (AOR: 0.58; CI: 0.52 – 0.66), and Pacific

217

Islander (AOR: 0.35; CI: 0.29 – 0.42) individuals had lower odds of testing positive. A large

218

proportion of individuals did not have attributable race or ethnicity data in the records (63 % of

219

all records through August 16).

220

Zip code level population density was not a significant predictor of testing positive

221

(Table 2, Figure 5). However, education (percentage of adults with at least a bachelor’s degree),

222

insurance coverage (percentage of adults who had insurance in the previous 5 years), and median

223

household income were all statistically significant predictors of testing positive. For example,

224

individuals who lived in zip codes with the highest education levels had 39% decreased odds of

225

testing positive (AOR for the fourth quartile: 0.61; CI: 0.49 – 0.76). In addition, the interaction

226

between zip code level median household income (Supplementary Figure 2) indicates that

227

individuals from wealthier zip codes had increased risk of testing positive at the beginning of the

228

OC epidemic. However, this pattern quickly shifted, with individuals from lower income areas

229

showing the highest odds of testing positive in subsequent months.

230

231

Factors associated with COVID-19 associated mortality

10

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.13.21249507; this version posted January 18, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

232

For each increase in 10 years of age there was an associated 2.5 fold increase in the odds

233

of mortality (AOR: 2.56, CI: 2.46 – 2.67; Table 3, Figure 6). Infected males were almost twice

234

as likely to die from COVID-19 when compared to females (AOR: 1.97; CI: 1.71 – 2.26). While

235

Asian individuals were less likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection (Table 2), those

236

who did test positive had higher odds of mortality. Compared to whites, Asians had 31%

237

increased odds of dying from COVID-19 (AOR: 1.31; CI: 1.08 – 1.59).

238

Living in zip codes with high education levels and insurance coverage was also

239

predictive of mortality outcomes (Table 3, Figure 6). Individuals who tested positive for

240

COVID-19 and lived in zip codes with the highest levels of educational attainment had 45%

241

lower odds of dying (AOR for the fourth quartile: 0.55; CI: 0.34 – 0.89). Those who lived in zip

242

codes with the highest levels of insurance coverage had 41% lower odds of dying. Zip code level

243

population density and median household income were not significant predictors of mortality

244

after accounting for the other risk factors.

245

246

There was no significant change in risk of COVID-19 mortality over this time period.
The number of COVID-19 patients in ICU was also not predictive of mortality.

247

248

249

Factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity
Zip code level cumulative incidence was a significant predictor of individual-level

250

seropositivity in the absence of other zip code level predictors (Supplementary Table 2). Every

251

increase in 10% of the zip code cumulative incidence resulted in approximately a 50% increase

252

in the odds that an individual would be seropositive.

253

254

Zip code level cumulative incidence was no longer a statistically significant predictor of
seropositivity when other zip code level predictors were added to the model (Table 4, Figure 7).

255

In the full model (including all zip code level covariates) median household income had a

256

protective effect, with individuals coming from zip codes with higher median household income

257

having lower odds of being seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (AOR for every one

258

standard deviation increase: 0.75; CI: 0.57 – 0.98).

259

We found no difference in age groups with regard to seropositivity. While males were

260

more likely to test positive or to die from SARS-CoV-2 infection, they were less likely than

261

females to be seropositive (AOR: 0.75; CI: 0.59 – 0.94). Hispanic and Latino individuals had

262

55% increased odds of being seropositive (AOR: 1.55, CI: 1.17 – 2.03). Pacific Islanders may

263

also have had higher odds of being seropositive, but with small total numbers and broad

264

confidence intervals (AOR: 3.94, CI: 1.07 – 14.57; a total of 3 out of 12 individuals tested were

265

seropositive).

266

267

268

DISCUSSION
Infectious disease data from passive case detection can be biased in a variety of ways,

269

including the well-documented challenge of uneven access to testing and diagnosis (17). In our

270

analysis of COVID-19 in OC, we used a rich set of complementary data that include those

271

passively collected (reported cases, mortality records) and those from active screening

272

(population-based serological testing). Results indicate that, in the early days of the epidemic in

273

OC, both testing intensity and test positivity concentrated in wealthy and affluent areas along the

274

central coast. After March, however, a large cluster of reported cases formed in lower-income

275

North-Central OC (especially the cities of Santa Ana and Anaheim, Supplementary Figure 1),

276

growing in size in May and persisting over time. Testing intensity has spread throughout the

277

county during this same time period.

278

Consistent with emerging reports, we also found that age and male gender strongly

279

predict testing positive and COVID-19 associated mortality (18). Intriguingly, whereas older age

280

groups and males were more likely to have symptomatic disease, our population-based

281

serological survey found that females were more likely than males to be seropositive. Hispanic

282

and Latino individuals had higher risk of infection and testing positive, even after controlling for

283

several zip code level socio-economic factors. Given the consistency of this racial/ethnic finding

284

between the models for test positivity and seropositivity, the risk of being infected with SARS-

285

CoV-2 rises above and beyond the risks of living in a zip code with high transmission or a zip

286

code with low-income and low levels of educational attainment. Other studies also note an

287

increased risk of testing positive for Hispanics and Latinos (19–21). Our seroprevalence survey

288

indicates that in OC, this finding is not an artifact of passive case detection but instead represents

289

a true greater risk of infection for Hispanics and Latinos.

While Asians were less likely to test positive for COVID-19, they were more likely to die

291

when infected. This disparity is consistent with national data, though its cause is uncertain (22).

292

This pattern may reflect discrepancies in outreach communication to these communities or other

293

socio-economic and cultural factors (23,24) and warrants further detailed investigation.

294

Social determinants of health, defined as "conditions in which people are born, grow,

295

work, live, age, and the wider set of forces and systems,” play a critical role in the creation of

296

disparities related to morbidity, mortality, and quality of life (25). These social determinants

297

include (among other factors) poverty, wealth, educational quality, neighborhood conditions,

298

childhood experience, and social support. Several speculative explanations have been proposed

299

for these sociodemographic patterns related to COVID-19, including living in dense quarters. In

300

addition, as the state and local shelter in place and social distancing policies were mandated,

301

individuals who are independently wealthy or who work in occupations where working from

302

home is a viable option, were more capable of practicing social (more accurately “physical”)

303

distancing. People from low socioeconomic status (SES) areas, by contrast, may have less ability

304

to practice social distancing. Our analyses show that individuals from zip codes with lower

305

overall educational attainment and insurance coverage were more likely to test positive for and

306

die from COVID-19. The association with median household income was more complex and

307

changed over time with regard to test positivity. However, we also find that individuals from zip

308

codes with lower median household income were also more likely to be seropositive for SARS-

309

CoV-2. These findings underscore the importance of understanding contextual factors

310

surrounding infectious disease outbreaks.

311

Study limitations include that County-reported testing and mortality data did not include

312

individual-level information on income, education, and insurance. These variables were only

313

available at the zip code level. Zip codes are unlikely to adequately represent important spatial

314

units (e.g., neighborhoods, communities). Our measure of population density may also not

315

accurately capture the importance of housing or household density. Missing data on

316

race/ethnicity (63% of all official test records) and small counts of some race/ethnicity groups

317

may have impacted our findings for groups with low counts in this analysis. Even when

318

race/ethnicity data were available, they were broad categories (i.e. Asian rather than specific

319

Asian ethnicities). We also note, however, that the population-based seroprevalence data on

320

SARS-CoV-2 included detailed individual-level information on socio-demographic covariates,

321

which we exploited for our detailed analyses.

322

323

Study strengths include the diversity of OC in terms of socioeconomic and demographic
predictors, which provide sufficient power to investigate these factors in our analyses. California

324

was also one of the first states to issue an executive order for residents to stay home, providing

325

data for several months when only essential workers were permitted to work outside the home.

326

Our analyses were able to identify temporal shifts in the demographics of COVID-19 test

327

positivity that likely reflect disparities related to occupation type that are further amplified by

328

household characteristics. Finally, we are able to assess differences in risk of infection and test

329

positivity by comparing our population-level serological survey to routinely collected (passive)

330

data from County statistics.

331

The reasons for the spatial, socio-demographic, and economic patterns we discovered are

332

likely complex and broadly related to issues of accessing health care and general social

333

determinants of health. The clear disparities in how this disease has manifested in OC point

334

toward the need for approaches that are socio-culturally appropriate and those that have a focus

335

on health equity as a fundamental building block. Measures that focus on the hardest-hit

336

communities may serve as efficient points of intervention for COVID-19.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
We acknowledge the actOC research manager (Emily Drum) and logistical expertise of

340

Dr Bruce Albala for setting up and helping run the seroprevalence study. Many UCI students and

341

alumni were involved in collecting blood samples for the serological survey and we gratefully

342

acknowledge their contributions. We are grateful to the Felgner lab members who made the

343

serological survey possible under sometimes trying conditions (especially Rie Nakajima, Aarti

344

Jain, and Rafael Ramiro de Assis). Guiyun Yan and Xiaoming Wang provided space for cold

345

storage. The serological survey was funded through a contract with OCHCA (MA-042-

346

20011978). We also acknowledge conversations with colleagues and community leaders with

* Model intercept represents odds of testing sero-positive for SARS-CoV2 for a white female diagnosed with SARS-CoV2 in the 18-24 age group
in a zip code in the first quartile of college degree and insured with the average population density, and average percent of SARS-CoV2 positive
individuals in Orange County. The odds of this individual testing sero-positive is estimated to be 0.074 (0.031,0.178)
† 95% confidence interval computed with robust standard errors
‡ Native American/Native Alaskan race group not included in analysis due to lack of data, no individual of this race group tested seropositive
§ The estimated percent of people with a bachelor’s degree, and similarly the estimated percent of people with medical insurance, in an
individual’s zip code
¶ Number of individuals who tested positive in individual’s zip code reported to OC Public Health Department from March 1st to August 16th,
divided by estimated population of zip code
