Abstract
In response to the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, the U.S. has largely
delegated implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to local governments on
the state and county level. This staggered implementation combined with the heterogeneity of the
U.S. complicates quantification the effect of NPIs on the reproductive rate of SARS-CoV-2.
We describe a data-driven approach to quantify the effect of NPIs that relies on county-level
similarities to specialize a Bayesian mechanistic model based on observed fatalities. Using this
approach, we estimate change in reproductive rate, ùëÖ! , due to implementation of NPIs in 1,417
U.S. counties.
We estimate that as of May 28th, 2020 1,177 out of the considered 1,417 U.S. counties have
reduced the reproductive rate of SARS-CoV-2 to below 1.0. The estimated effect of any
individual NPI, however, is different across counties. Stay-at-home orders were estimated as the
only effective NPI in metropolitan and urban counties, while advisory NPIs were estimated to be
effective in more rural counties. The expected level of infection predicted by the model ranges
from 0 to 28.7% and is far from herd immunity even in counties with advanced spread.
Our results suggest that local conditions are pertinent to containment and re-opening decisions.

1 Introduction
As of May 28th, 2020, the United States has reported more than 1,700,000 cases of novel
coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). This disease, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, has led to more than 100,000 deaths in the U.S.1 Nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are a critical component of the public health effort to slow
the spread of COVID-19 as pharmaceutical interventions are not currently available. NPIs
include guidelines for hand hygiene, cancellations of mass events, school closures, closure of
non-essential business, and stay-at-home orders. These measures are designed to reduce
transmission, buy time to expand healthcare capacity, develop effective testing and tracing
mechanisms, and research pharmaceutical options, such as a vaccine.
Indeed, the implementation of NPIs caused a rapid decline of new cases and deaths, although at a
very high economic and social cost. Understanding precisely how NPIs affect disease
transmission is desirable in order to safely roll back NPIs and minimize adverse effects. Prior
works have quantified the effects of NPIs on the reproductive rate ùëÖ! of SARS-CoV-2 in China,2
UK,3 Brazil,4 and 14 European countries, including Italy, Spain, and Germany.5,6 Except for
some large urban areas,7 these effects have not yet been quantified for the U.S., which delegated
NPI implementation to state and local governments rather than establishing a unified, federal
approach. As a result, it is necessary to quantify the effect of NPIs on the county level, but the
limited number of documented fatalities in many counties would limit this analysis to urban
areas with sufficient data for epidemiological modeling.
We develop a data-driven approach that establishes county similarity based on factors known to
affect community transmission of infectious diseases. Within groups of similar counties, we
jointly optimize the parameters of a Bayesian mechanistic model to the observed deaths in every
county under the assumption that the same NPI attains comparable effects across counties that
are similar with respect to disease transmission factors. Using this approach, we estimate the
change in ùëÖ! due to implementing NPIs in 1,417 U.S. counties that exhibit substantially different
characteristics regarding population density, economy, demographics, and infrastructure. We fit
a model to groups of counties with similar conditions which gives us a probable ùëÖ! trajectory
over time and consequently, the probable number of people infected over time.

2 Conclusions
Based on the model, as of May 28th, 2020 1,177 out of the considered 1,417 U.S. counties are
estimated to have reduced the reproductive rate of novel coronavirus to below 1.0 via the
implementation of NPIs. The estimated effect of any individual NPI, however, may differ across
counties. We observe that for metropolitan and urban counties, the most substantial reduction is
attributed to stay-at-home orders while less restrictive NPIs were estimated to be effective in
more rural counties. Further, the expected level of infection predicted by the model, ranging
from 0 to 28.7%, is far from herd immunity even in counties with advanced spread.
While the model explains the observed trends in fatalities well, the rapid escalation of the
COVID-19 situation and quick succession in the implementation of NPIs in most counties within

few days from another complicates the disentanglement of the effects of any individual NPI.
Further, even if accurate, the effect attributed to any NPI may not describe the consequences of
roll back of the same NPI because social norms and individuals‚Äô behavior may have changed,
including the wearing of masks in public.
Despite these limitations, our results suggest that strategies for shutdown as well as re-opening
require careful consideration of county conditions in addition to state and national trends.

3 Results
Characterizing Groups of Similar Counties as Clusters
Since our hypothesis is that local conditions affect the spread of COVID-19, we differentiate
among groups of counties using a data-driven approach known as clustering. Each group ‚Äì or
cluster ‚Äì of counties is characterized by having similar demographic and socioeconomic
qualities. For instance, cluster 1 consists of low-population, mostly rural counties with little
public transit capacity and the lowest median household income. Cluster 2 and 3 are similar in
size, having a mean population of 45,000 and 52,000 respectively, but cluster 2 includes higherincome, suburban areas where-as cluster 3 has lower income areas with a large land area. Cluster
4 consists of the densest metropolitan areas with a high proportion of 18- to 65-year-olds, high
household income, a high public transit score, and small land area. Finally, cluster 5 has the
highest mean population besides cluster 4, but is less densely populated, has poor public transit,
and a lower household income on average. It is important to note that although we refer to these
clusters with numbers 1-5, these are merely labels returned by the clustering algorithm without
any meaning inherent to the ordering. Figure 1 shows our clustering for all U.S. counties with
this data available, including those without any incidence of COVID-19.

Once we have identified the clusters, we infer the reproductive rate of SARS-CoV-2 over time
by jointly optimizing the parameters of a Bayesian mechanistic model on each cluster. This
process is described in greater detail in Section 4. Figure 2 shows the reproductive rate at select
dates for counties associated with their public transportation use.

Figure 2: Relationship between public transit capacity and the time-dependent reproductive rate of SARS-CoV-2 for
U.S. counties. Colors correspond to clusters as in Figure 1. In the cluster of counties that rely least on public
transport, shown in yellow, we observe a substantial drop in reproductive rate already on 3/15/20, possibly
indicating a strong effect of advisory NPIs that were in effect at that time.

We observe that although the basic reproductive rate of SARS-CoV-2 starts at a similar level for
all clusters, the speed at which counties in each cluster respond to the disease, and reduce its ùëÖ!
differs. The reproductive rate in metropolitan counties (cluster 4), which tends to have higher
reliance on public transportation, decreases over the entire period. This is especially apparent
going from March 15 to March 25. On the other hand, clusters with little transportation use, such
as cluster 5, was estimated to have quickly reduced transmission rates. This suggests that if
people have a higher reliance on public infrastructure, more stringent interventions are necessary
to reduce transmission. The staggered drops in reproductive rates are attributed to both varied
efficacy of NPIs (to be discussed in the next section) and counties implementing NPIs at
different times. Comparisons with more features are shown in Section 4.

Table 1: Estimated initial and current reproductive rate as of May 28th, 2020, and the number of cases for select
counties ordered by their reproductive rate as of May 28th. This is compared to the measured number of cases and
fatality rates.

From Table 1, we observe that most counties exhibited an initial reproductive rate ùëÖ" above 3.
As of May 28th, however, most have successfully reduced the reproductive rate to ùëÖ! ‚âà 1 after
implementing NPIs. It is estimated that 18.4 to 42.7% of the population (95% confidence
interval) has been infected in New York, NY, which has the highest number of cases. Based on
the initial reproductive rates between 2 and 4, herd immunity is reached only after 50 ‚Äì 70% of
the population has recovered,8,9 suggesting that all U.S. counties are far from resilience.
Consequently, easing restrictions is likely to result in subsequent waves of the epidemic. We
state these findings for 15 heterogeneous counties in Table 1 and provide the same metrics for all
1,417 counties online at https://github.com/JieYingWu/npi-model, where we also provide code
and data required for reproduction.

Table 3: Without a cluster-specialized model, information about the effectiveness of local interventions is not as
pronounced.

We note that our model estimates different behavior across counties. While all counties have
implemented a similar set of interventions, their estimated effects are substantially different in
each respective cluster. For example, metropolitan counties (cluster 4) were estimated to have a
strong response to stay-at-home orders, while rural and suburban areas (clusters 1, 2, 3, and 5)
responded more to national-level interventions according to our model.
One caveat is that the effects of interventions that were implemented close together are difficult
to disentangle. Many local governments implemented formal NPIs in immediate response to the
federal guidelines, leading a quick succession of NPIs coming into effect. Disentanglement of
the effects of NPIs is explored more in Section 4.
Another limitation of our model is that the federal level interventions may have come before
some counties have seen any cases. This introduces ambiguity between ùëÖ" estimates and the
weight attributed to federal NPIs, i.e., federal guidelines and travel ban. Similar ambiguity is less
prominent for other interventions, since they are not generally implemented before a county has
seen cases. Additionally, since the epidemiological model used here is mechanistic, it only
allows for changes of the transmission rate at the time of implementation of interventions. Other
events, such as high-profile cases and cancellations of prominent festivals, likely contributed to
increasing awareness of the disease and may also have effects on individual behavior, and

therefore the ùëÖ! . These effects cannot be attributed to a specific date and may thus affect the
weights of interventions that come into effect at around the same time.

4 Methods
Method Overview
Figure 3 shows an overview of the proposed method. We train a Bayesian mechanistic model
(BMM) in a cluster-specialized manner and compare with the baseline model trained on all
counties. We show the stability of our model in two ways, first by withholding random days
during training and second by withholding given counties. We compare the predictions based on
incomplete data with those based on complete data.

all eligible counties, with cluster-specialized models (b) BMM 1-5. (c) Two validation methods for our model.
Validation A tests the stability of the model by withholding 3 random days and comparing the outputs. Validation B
withholds a set of counties for comparison rather than days.

Quantifying changes in COVID-19‚Äôs reproductive rate is complicated when considering
differences at the county ‚Äì rather than the national ‚Äì level. Parametric epidemiological models
are optimized to describe fatality counts, the volume and reliability of which decreases outside of
highly populated regions. To make up for this scarcity, we leverage a balanced clustering of U.S.
counties to aggregate data from similar counties in the same state, treating them as a single
‚Äúsuper-county,‚Äù if they have identical NPI implementation dates. This has the advantage of
considering counties that would otherwise be excluded without assuming that the spread of the
disease in those counties follows the same trend of more advanced regions in the same state or
country. Figure 4 shows how for a given state- in this case Texas, and a given cluster, the
counties with 1-49 cumulative deaths from COVID-19 are treated as a single entity. In addition
to this data aggregation strategy, we fit a cluster-specialized model to each set of counties,
quantifying the possibly disparate effects of the NPIs in each type of county, as detailed below.

cluster 1 having 1-49 cumulative deaths as of May 28th, 2020 and the same NPI implementation dates. To enable
robust epidemiological models, these counties are treated as a single ‚Äúsuper-county.‚Äù

To generate this clustering, we partition 3,059 U.S. counties into five clusters based on variables
which directly affect disease spread, using a Gaussian mixture model.10 Table 4 summarizes these
variables, which include demographic, economic, and public transit capacities that we have
gathered, processed for machine readability, and released in a publicly available dataset.11
Sources include the United States Census Bureau, the United States Department of Agriculture
Economic Research Service and the Center for Neighborhood Technology. A full list of sources
can be found on the corresponding website.11 To incorporate potential exposure, we consider
county population, density, housing density, and land area. Additionally, we consider portions of
the population for age- and gender-based demographic categories, due to COVID-19‚Äôs disparate
effects on these groups.12‚Äì16
Our clustering is also based on socioeconomic variables, which may indicate behavioral traits
relevant to the spread of COVID-19. For instance, workers with tertiary education are more
likely to hold office-type jobs which can be done from home.17 At the same time, many
secondary-education jobs have been deemed essential, resulting in a high contact rate, which in
turn increases the likelihood of infection. Thus, our clustering considers college education,
poverty, unemployment, and median household income for each county as a reflection of the
overall job composition in the local area. Finally, we include a population-weighted transit score
due to the likelihood of transmission in the enclosed, possibly crowded space that public
transport entails.
Figure 5 and Figure 6 show the ùëÖ! plotted over median income and density for counties and
super-counties in the different clusters. Super-counties are visualized as a single point using their
population-weighted average for that feature. The plots show the distribution of the cluster over

Notably, we exclude ethnic demographics from the variables considered during clustering
because we assume that no direct relationship exists between race and incidence of COVID-19.
Rather, such a relationship would be mediated by socioeconomic factors that are already
included for similarity assessment.

Modelling the Effects of NPIs
Data Processing
We use cumulative fatality and infection counts from the JHU CSSE COVID-19 Dashboard,
which has been tracking COVID-19 since January.1 When fitting our model, we use measured
fatality rates, which are generally considered more reliable than confirmed infections because of
limited testing and the prevalence of asymptomatic cases. Thus, we use population-weighted
fatality rates to estimate the true cases count. Obtaining a reasonable estimate for this ratio is
crucial to realistically model the numbers of total infections. However, due to asymptomatic
cases, undertesting and biased reporting, this parameter cannot be measured directly, but has to
be inferred from observable data.19‚Äì21 Previous studies all report fatality rates with substantial
uncertainty but agree on the fact that fatality for COVID-19 depends strongly on the age of the
infected person. Therefore, we adapt the fatality rates per age group presented in Verity et al.19
for each county with respect to its demographic age distribution. Based on U.S. Census data, a
per-county weighted fatality rate is computed using the share of each age group in the overall
population.
Model
We estimate the effective reproductive rate using a semi-mechanistic Bayesian mechanistic
model proposed in Flaxman et al.5,22, that infers the impact of a predefined set of interventions
and estimates the number of infections over time. The model estimates a county-specific initial
reproductive rate ùëÖ",$ for the ùëö-th county and intervention weights ùõº% , the effect of which is
assumed constant for all counties included in joint optimization. These effects are assumed
multiplicative, modeled as

where ùëö is the county index and ùêº!,$ is a binary indicator for intervention ùëñ being in place at
time ùë°. The interventions we take into account here are summarized in Table 1.
The model assumes a normal distribution as the prior for the ùëÖ" . We set the prior on
ùëÖ" ~ùëÅ(3.28, |ùúÖ|) where ùúÖ ~ ùí© + (0, 0.5). The value of 3.28 is in accordance with the analysis
presented in Liu et al.23
Starting from the time-varying ùëÖ! , a latent function of daily infections is modeled depending on a
number of factors: a generation distribution g with density g(œÑ) that models the time between
spread of infection from an individual to the next (approximated as the serial interval
distribution), the number of susceptible individuals left in the population, an infection-to-death

distribution, and the county-specific time-varying reproduction number that models the average
number of secondary infections at any given time. The parameters for the distributions are
chosen in accordance to Flaxman et al.5
Model fitting is driven by the timeseries of observed daily deaths. These are linked to the
modelled number of infections by the county specific weighted fatality rate. The sum of past
infections, along with the weighted probability of death gives the number of deaths on a day for a
given county. To ensure that the deaths accounted for are from locally acquired infections, we
include observed deaths in a county only after the cumulative count has exceeded 10. The
seeding of new infections is assumed to be a month prior to that.
All parameters are estimated jointly using an adaptive Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampler
in the probabilistic programming language Stan.24

Validation
We propose three validation schemes to validate our approach. First, we show that our model is
stable, so a small change in the input produces a small change in the output. Second, we separate
our counties and super-counties into train and test sets. We fit models for each cluster as well as
for all counties and super-counties on either, both the train and test set or with only the train set.
We evaluate using the parameters of the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù cluster model to predict fatalities for the heldout regions. Comparing these predictions to those made when the regions are included during
training confirms that the model is not over-reliant on each data point. Third, we evaluate how
well our model discerns the effects of individual NPIs and discuss biases it may have to attribute
more weight to certain NPIs.

Validating the Stability of the Model
To show stability in our model, we train the model, withholding three non-consecutive days
chosen at random, and compare the predictions for these days to the baseline model fit on full
data. Only days with non-zero death counts are selected as potential leave-out candidates. We set
the threshold for data selection at counties with 50 cumulative deaths by May 28th, which results
in 211 counties. (For model validation, we do not use super-counties.) We fit the model over 300
total iterations, with 150 of those as warmup iterations. From the uncertainty distributions
obtained as results from the models, we use the expected values of the deaths of the held-out
days to compare the two models and report our observations in Figure 7a. The clustering of
points around the optimal fit visually confirms that the expected values of the baseline model fit
those from the model with held-out days. In Figure 7b, we compare the average county-wise
expected value of deaths of the withheld days and observe a more concentrated distribution
around the line of optimal fit.
Using the Pearson-correlation coefficient to quantify the similarity between the expected values,
we find r-values greater than 0.99 for the held-out days and the average held-out days which
suggest that the model is robust against small input perturbations.

by the optimal fit, are remarkably close to the true values. (b) The three held-out days per county are averaged and
compared.

Validating the Advantages of Clustering
We show the advantage of cluster-specialized models for quantifying the effects of NPIs by
comparing their performance with models trained on different clusters or on the national level.
While a clustering of U.S. counties may or may not be interesting, its value related to COVID-19
comes from its ability to identify epidemiologically meaningful differences among various
regions in the country. When fitting each model, we withhold a validation region from each
cluster and use the remaining counties to fit Equation 1, for both cluster-specialized and baseline
models. We then use the learned weights ùõº% to initialize a fixed-ùõº BHI model for each withheld
region.
With this scheme, we show the advantage of clustering U.S. counties in three ways. First, we
show that within the same cluster, we obtain comparable predictions for a county whether or not
it is included in training. Second, we observe that ùõº values learned from a different cluster
produce substantially different predictions. Finally, we apply the ùõº values learned at the national
level to similar effect. This demonstrates how cluster-specialized models can reveal trends in the
spread of COVID-19 that are not apparent under the assumption that NPIs have universal effect
at the national or state level.

Figure 8: The fatalities predicted by our model for seven counties in Arizona (treated as a single super-county), with
fatalities data from Apache, Cochise, La Paz, Mohave, Navajo, Yavapai, and Yuma counties, using data up to May
18th. (a) When the super-county is included in training, the cluster-specialized BHI model incorporates outlier events
in deaths from COVID-19 while still describing the overall trend. (b) When the super-county is withheld from
training but uses ùõº values from the same cluster, the model still captures the same overall trend of increasing deaths.
(c) On the other hand, using ùõº values from a different cluster makes it appear as though the curve has flattened, even
though (d) shows the continued upward trend based on data up to May 28th.

Figure 8 shows the first and second validation strategy for cluster 3, which consists of lesspopulous counties with large land area. For such regions, which necessarily have fewer cases to
support local models, it is vital to gain accurate insight from the entire training pool and verify
these insights through the aforementioned validation process. Thus, in this illustrative example,
we use data up to May 18th, at which point the continuing spread of cases was not immediately
clear. Indeed, Figure 8a shows the predictions obtained for seven counties in Arizona (treated as a
single super-county). One can readily observe the model takes into account random outliers
while following a general upward trend. Figure 8b exhibits less awareness of outliers but still
follows the same trend, despite using Œ± values obtained from training on cluster 3 with these
same counties withheld. On the other hand, Figure 8c shows the predictions made when using
the wrong Œ± values, from cluster 4, which consists of densely populated city centers. As can be
seen, this results in a markedly different prediction for the trend of the disease than actually

occurred up to May 28th in Figure 8d. This is a critical difference, which could result in very
different decisions for implementing or removing NPIs.

Figure 9: Predicted fatalities in Washington D.C. up to May 28th, 2020. (a) The fatalities predicted by the baseline model, which
observes all eligible counties during training. (b) The fatalities predicted by a cluster-specialized model, showing a very different
trend in the course of the spread of COVID-19. Although this difference is more pronounced for the District of Columbia than for
most regions, it underscores the potential for misleading predictions when the United States‚Äô heterogeneity is not taken into
account.

Finally, we compare the performance of our cluster-specialized model with the baseline model,
which uses all eligible counties for training. In many cases, this difference is slight, and both the
baseline and cluster-specialized models exhibit similar trends for a given region. However, for
certain areas the difference can be profound. Take, for example, the District of Columbia, which
has become a significant hot-spot for COVID-19. The baseline model, shown in Figure 9a, has
only recently flattened, whereas the cluster-specialized model in Figure 9b reflects the reality
that efforts to combat the disease have had much greater effect, significantly reducing the
number of deaths. This is because when forced to accommodate counties across the U.S., the
baseline model emphasizes federal guidelines with a mean Œ± value of 0.804 (see Table 3). On the
other hand, our cluster-specialized model found that stay-at-home orders were much more
effective for counties in cluster 4, with a mean Œ± value of 0.963. This difference illustrates the
advantage of specializing a BHI model based county-level characteristics; it allows the model to
include a greater number of counties within separate clusters while not being forced to overgeneralize and, in doing so, compromise some certainty.

Table 5: How far apart on average each intervention is implemented from each other. The interventions are in the
order defined in Table 2.

One drawback of thes model is that it cannot disentangle implementations that came into effect
at the same time. For example, states often closed public schools at the same time as federal
guidelines were issued so it is difficult to discern the individual effect on reducing ùëÖ! .
Additionally, in Table 5, we observe that banning gatherings of 50 or more people often occurs at
the same time as banning gatherings of 500 or more, and restaurants and entertainment venues
are often closed together. This suggests that these pairs of interventions may not or be poorly
disentangled.
To further investigate the model‚Äôs ability to disentangle intervention weights, we create
simulated trajectories of counties‚Äô deaths and cases counts based on their ùëÖ" and the dates on
which the interventions came into effect. Using all counties that have more than 50 cumulative
deaths on May 28th without super-counties, we seed each county with 200 cases in each of the
first 6 days. To simulate county-specific trajectories, we construct a set of generated timeseries.
We assign intervention weights ùõº% to be randomly generated from a Gamma distribution, the
same distribution as our prior on the Bayesian mechanistic model adjusted to be in the range of
our learned weights. We then calculate what the ùëÖ! on each day must have been based on the ùëÖ"
and the interventions in place. Once we have the seeded infection and the ùëÖ! trajectory for each
county, we can calculate daily infections and thus expected fatalities. Using the simulated
trajectories, we fit the model. Table 6 compares the weights used for generation with the weights
that the model learned.

Table 6: By setting the intervention weights, we can generate simulated timeseries of cases and deaths counts and
have the model learn the weights. The learned values differ from the ground truth intervention weights, showing that
the model does not disentangle the contribution of each intervention well in cases where interventions were
implemented close together.

We observe that the effects of individual NPIs are not well disentangled in general. The model
tends to attribute more weight to few NPIs rather than spread out the weight evenly. Specifically,
the model tends to put more weight on stay-at-home orders. This may be because interventions
I2-I8 are often implemented close together (see Table 5) and it is difficult to attribute effect to any
single one of them on a national scale. While we can conclude that the trajectories the model
predicts are reliable, due to their match to measured death, and therefore the overall decrease in
ùëÖ! is reliable, attributing decreases to any individual NPI is challenging whenever the difference
in implementation date is small. This observation seems to be in line with the similarly large
confidence intervals reported in previous work on varied models and regions.2-7
