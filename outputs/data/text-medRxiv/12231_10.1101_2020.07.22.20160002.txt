Title: Remdesivir for COVID-19: match-population analysis with compassionate use of
Remdesivir for severe COVID-19

Authors: Olga Vasylyeva, MD, Tara Chen, MD, John Hanna, MD
Authors affiliation: Rochester Regional Health, Rochester, NY

Abstract:

We retrospectively compared outcomes between patients who received compassionate care
Remdesivir and whose who met criteria for Remdesivir, but did not received it due to period of
unavailability. We observed comparable mortality rate and significantly higher mortality rate
among patients with CrCl < 30 ml per minute.

Background:

COVID-19 is a disease caused by SARS-CoV2 coronavirus that can result in severe acute
respiratory syndrome and is classified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO).
[1,2] As of July, 2020, in the United States, 140,828 people died due to COVID-19 that is the
highest mortality among other countries. [3]

Up to date, no U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved antiviral COVID-19 drugs
that demonstrated efficacy in a completed randomized controlled trial is available. On May 1,
2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorization for investigational drug Remdesivir in
hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. [4-7]

Remdesivir is an experimental nucleoside analogue developed by Gilead Sciences that works by
blocking viral RNA synthesis. It was reported that Remdesivir has activity against MERS,
SARS, and SARS-CoV2 in vitro. [8] Since January 2020, Gilead Sciences accepted requests for
compassionate use Remdesivir, however on March 22, 2020 Gilead Sciences introduced
limitation on compassionate use except for pregnant women and children due to overwhelming
demand. [9, 10]

On April 10, 2020, multicenter data were published by Grein J. et al. on compassionate use of
Remdesivir for patients with severe COVID-19 based on the FDA and Gilead Sciences approval
before the restriction, but the study lacked a control group. [10] Rochester Regional Health
(RRH) has a number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients who did not receive Remdesivir due to
its unavailability. We attempted to match the population of patients hospitalized to RRH for

COVID-19 after the introduction of restriction with the patients’ population who received
Remdesivir for compassionate use as reported by Grein J. et. al.

Method:

This is a retrospective review of the patients’ data who was hospitalized due to COVID-19 since
March 22, 2020. Patients were selected to match inclusion criteria to receive compassionate care
Remdesivir as reported by Grein J. et al. and Gilead Science. Inclusion criteria were: hospitalized
patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV2 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR); oxygen
saturation of 94% or less while the patient was breathing ambient air or a need for oxygen
support; creatinine clearance (CrCl) > 30 ml per minute upon admission; aspartate
aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) less than five times the upper limit
of normal range upon admission. The primary outcomes were a need for invasive ventilation and
mortality.

Results:

Between 3/22/2020 and 4/30/2020, 149 patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 were
hospitalized to RRH. Among these patients, 98 (65.7 %) met inclusion criteria for compassionate
use of Remdesivir either at the time of admission or during hospitalization.

Median age was 64 (27-97) years, and 62 (63.2%) were males. Median time of admission was
eight days. Forty (40.8 %) patients required intensive care unit admission, and 20 (20.4 %)
invasive ventilation. Ten patients died (10.2 %) with median time from admission to death nine
days. (Table 1)

Among 51 patients who was not qualified to receive Remdesivir based on inclusion criteria, 22
had CrCl < 30 ml per min upon admission. Eight out of these patients (36.3 %) required invasive
ventilation, and eight patients died, which was significantly more than patients with CrCl > 30
ml min (36.3% vs 10.2%, p = 0.001). Five out of 51 were not eligible for Remdesivir due to
elevated AST and ALT more than five times of normal limits upon admission.

Limitations:

The major limitation of this study is the lack of randomization and sufficient matching to
perform statistical analysis on difference as we do not have raw data from the group that received
Remdesivir. Out population had fewer males (63.2% vs. 75%) and notably fewer patients
requiring mechanical ventilation (20.4% vs. 64%). The median age in both groups was the same,
64 years.

Six patients in the group that did not receive Remdesivir remained hospitalized at the time of
follow up period, and final outcome is unknown.

Discussion:

Grein J. et al. article on outcomes for the patients who received Remdesivir for compassionate
care reported 13% mortality, but there was no control group. We compared this data with the
population who met the same criteria for compassionate care Remdersivir, but did not receive it
because of unavailability.

In our population, 10 (10.2%) patients died. It is unknown if there is a statistical difference
between groups as we have no detailed data from the group who received Remdesivir. We
observed that in our population, much fewer people required invasive ventilation (20.4% vs.
64%). Furthermore, patients who presented with CrCl < 30 per min had significantly higher
mortality as compared with patients who met criteria to receive Remdesivir (36.3% vs. 10.2%).
Benefits of Remdesivir for patients required invasive ventilation and have CrCl < 30 per min
require further investigation.

On May 22 2020, a preliminary report from a clinical trial comparing Remdesivir and placebo
for treatment of COVID-19 was published [11,12]. Preliminary results showed 10.7% mortality
in the placebo group, which is comparable with 10.2% in our population, and 5.9% in
Remdesivir group. In this clinical trial, the difference in mortality between placebo and
intervention groups was not statistically significant. Median time to recovery, defined in the trial
as either discharge or continuous hospitalization for infection-control purposes, significantly
decreased from 15 to 11 days. However, in our population median time of hospitalization was
eight days, therefore it is uncertain if we will be observing this benefit in our population. The
final report of clinical trial is presently pending.

In conclusion, mortality among people who met inclusion criteria for compassionate use
Remdesivir but did to received it due to unavailability was 10.2%. There was significantly higher
mortality among patients presented with CrCl < 30 ml per min, an exclusion criterion for
compassionate use of Remdersivir, and the benefit of Remdesivir among this population needs to
be further evaluated.
