Abstract
The rapid global spread of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has strained healthcare and
testing resources, making the identification and prioritization of individuals most at-risk a critical
challenge. Recent evidence suggests blood type may affect risk of severe COVID-19. We used
observational healthcare data on 14,112 individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2 with known blood
type in the New York Presbyterian (NYP) hospital system to assess the association between
ABO and Rh blood types and infection, intubation, and death. We found slightly increased
infection prevalence among non-O types. Risk of intubation was decreased among A and
increased among AB and B types, compared with type O, while risk of death was increased for
type AB and decreased for types A and B. We estimated Rh-negative blood type to have a
protective effect for all three outcomes. Our results add to the growing body of evidence
suggesting blood type may play a role in COVID-19.

Background
The novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus) has spread
rapidly across the globe and has caused over 21.1 million confirmed infections and over 761,000
deaths worldwide as of August 17, 2020 [​1​]. A number of risk factors for COVID-19 morbidity
and mortality are known, including age, sex, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, and chronic
cardiovascular and respiratory diseases [​2​,​3​].
Recent work has demonstrated an association between ABO blood types and COVID-19 risk.
Using data from Wuhan and Shenzhen, Zhao et al. found a greater proportion ​of ​A and a lower

proportion of O blood types among COVID-19 patients, relative to the general populations of
Wuhan and Shenzhen [​4​]. Similarly, using a meta-analysis of data from Italy and Spain,
Ellinghaus et al. [​5​] found a higher risk of COVID-19 among A and a lower risk among O blood
types. Conversely, however, they estimated lower odds of mechanical ventilation for all non-O
types, though the estimated odds ratios were not statistically significant at the 5% level for this
outcome.
The ABO blood type trait reflects polymorphisms within the ​ABO​ gene. This gene is associated
with a number of other traits, including risk factors for COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. For
example, genome-wide association studies have associated variants within ​ABO​ to activity of the
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) [​6​], red blood cell count, hemoglobin concentration,
hematocrit, [​7​,​8​,​9​,​10​], von Willebrand factor [​11​,​12​,​13​,​14​], myocardial infarction [​15​,​16​],
coronary artery disease [​16​,​17​,​18​,​19​,​20​], ischemic stroke [​12​,​18​,​21​], type 2 diabetes [​22​,​23​,​24​],
and venous thromboembolism [​25​,​26​,​27​,​28​,​29​,​30​,​31​,​32​]. A 2012 meta-analysis found that, in
addition to individual variants, a non-O blood type is among the most important genetic risk
factors for venous thromboembolism [​33​]. These conditions are also relevant for COVID-19. For
example, coagulopathy is a common issue for COVID-19 patients [​34​,​35​,​36​,​37​,​38​,​39​,​40​], and
risk of venous thromboembolism must be carefully managed [​41​].
The numerous associations between conditions and both blood type and COVID-19 provide
reason to believe true associations may exist between blood type and morbidity and mortality
due to COVID-19. In addition, previous work has identified associations between ABO blood
groups and a number of different infections or disease severity following infections, including

SARS-CoV-1 [​42​], ​P. falciparum​ [​43​], ​H. pylori​ [​44​], Norwalk virus [​45​], hepatitis B virus [​46​],
and ​N. gonorrhoeae​ [​47​].
Rh(D) phenotypes (positive and negative Rh blood types) are associated with very few diseases
compared to ABO [​48​]. Like ABO, Rh type is important for type compatibility and immune
response. For example, hemolytic disease of the newborn is a concern when Rh(D) is
mismatched between mother and offspring [​49​]. Other studies have found evidence that
Rh-positive individuals are protected against the effects of latent toxoplasmosis [​50​], though
Toxoplasma gondii​ is a eukaryotic parasite [​51​], not a virus like SARS-CoV-2.
Within the United States, New York suffered among the worst outbreaks during the early phases
of the pandemic. As of August 22, New York City has recorded 228,144 confirmed infections
and 19,014 deaths [​52​]. We sought to understand the association between SARS-CoV-2
infection/COVID-19 and blood type using electronic health record (EHR) data from New
York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center (NYP/CUIMC) hospital in New
York City, USA. We compared both ABO and Rh(D) blood types, and we investigated initial
infection status and two severe COVID-19 outcomes: intubation and death. We evaluated
potential confounding due to population stratification using a multivariate analysis, and we
report clinically meaningful measures of effect.

Results
We determined blood types using laboratory measurements recorded in the NYP/CUIMC EHR
system. After removing likely errors, such as individuals with contradictory blood type results,
we identified 14,112 adult individuals with known blood types who received at least one

SARS-CoV-2 swab test (Table 1, Supplementary Figure ​S1​). We performed chi-squared tests of
independence and found insufficient evidence to conclude that the blood group frequencies differ
between SARS-CoV-2-tested and non-tested groups (Supplementary Table 1). Individuals were
considered initially SARS-CoV-2 positive (COV+) if they tested positive on their first recorded
test or within the following 96 hours. We evaluated associations between blood types and
outcomes using three comparisons: infection prevalence among initial tests and survival analysis
for intubation and death among individuals with infections confirmed by swab test. We report on
clinical data as of August 1, 2020.
The unadjusted prevalence of initial infection was higher among A and B blood types and lower
among AB types, compared with type O (Table 2, Figure ​1​). To avoid bias with respect to
healthcare utilization, length of hospital stay, and potential in-patient infection, we evaluated the
prevalence of infection among individuals only during the first encounters in which they were
tested. In addition, to account for the considerable risk of false negative tests [​55​,​56​] and the fact
that providers would repeat the test in patients with high clinical suspicion for COVID-19 [​57​],
any positive test during the first 96 hours of an encounter was considered evidence of initial
infection.
Blood type frequencies vary across ancestry groups [​53​], so we evaluated the confounding effect
of ancestry by adjusting for race/ethnicity (proxies for ancestry). We compared infection
prevalence with linear regression, using reference groups O for ABO and Rh-positive for Rh(D),
and using bootstrap to compute 95% confidence intervals for each estimate [​54​]. With
adjustment for patient race and ethnicity, prevalences among types A, AB, and B were higher

than type O. Rh(D) negative individuals had a 2.7% lower risk of initial infection after
adjustment for ancestry, consistent with a lower risk before adjustment.
Next, we examined intubation and death using a survival framework to understand how blood
type affects progression to disease outcomes over time. Specifically, we used the Fine-Gray
model [​58​] to estimate cumulative incidence functions by blood type while accounting for
competing risks and adjusting covariates. Death and recovery were competing events for
intubation and recovery was a competing event for death. Cohort entry was defined as the time
of a patient’s first positive test result or the start of a hospital encounter if the first positive test
occurred during the first 96 hours of the hospitalization. In accordance with CDC guidelines for
returning to work [​59​,​60​], we defined a patient as having recovered only when 10 days had
passed since the patient entered the cohort and only once the patient had been discharged.
Patients appearing on before July 30 were considered, and outcomes beyond August 1, 2020
were censored.
Blood type A was at decreased risk of both intubation and death relative to type O, while type
AB was at increased risk of both outcomes (Figure 1, Table 2). Conversely, we found that type B
individuals were at higher risk of intubation but at lower risk of death, compared with type O.
Individuals negative for Rh(D) were at decreased risk for both intubation and death, consistent
with a lower risk of initial infection. Overall, we estimate between 0.1 and 8.2 percent absolute
risk differences between blood groups, after adjusting for race and ethnicity.

Discussion
Better understanding COVID-19 is imperative given the current pandemic’s toll. We investigated
whether blood type is relevant for risk of infection, intubation, and death. Overall, we found
modest but consistent risk differences between blood types. After adjusting for ancestry (the
relevant confounder for this analysis), estimated risk differences were larger for intubation and
death outcomes than for initial infection. We estimate larger risk differences between Rh blood
types than between ABO types, with Rh-negative individuals being at lower risk of all three
outcomes. Type A had lower risk of intubation and death compared with types AB and O. Only
type B had inconsistent effects between intubation and death—type B increased risk of
intubation and decreased risk of death compared to type O. We also found consistent evidence
for protective associations between Rh negative blood groups and SARS-CoV-2 infection,
intubation, death. Overall, blood type appears to have a consistent effect, though the magnitudes
of these effects on risk of intubation or death are modest, and our estimates have large
uncertainties relative to their magnitudes. The relatively large estimated errors in our analysis
also suggest modest effect sizes and that greater sample sizes or meta-analyses are needed to
estimate these effects more precisely.
After adjusting for ancestry by proxies of race and ethnicity, we found that types A and B
conferred greater risk of an initial positive test compared to type O, while type AB (the rarest),
conferred a very small risk decrease (0.2%). These results are consistent with an association
discovered for SARS-CoV-1, in which O blood groups were less common among SARS patients
[​42​]. Our results are also mostly consistent with the results reported by Zhao et al. [​4​], where

non-O types appear to be at greater risk of infection, and with Ellinghaus et al. [​5​], where non-O
appear to be at greater risk of infection but at lesser risk of mechanical ventilation, though the
authors note that this decreased risk is not statistically significant at the 5% level. Unlike
Ellinghaus et al., though, we estimate slightly higher risk for types B and AB relative to O for
intubation.
Our results are based on data collected as part of hospital care during the early course of the
pandemic, where outpatient testing was severely limited due to testing capacity and supply
limitations. As such, our data are highly enriched for severely-ill patients, and the absolute risk
values we report are not generalizable to all SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals. A considerable
fraction of infections are mild or asymptomatic [​61​,​62​,​63​,​64​], while our data represent
predominantly the most severe cases. Selection bias is a fundamental limitation of our study, so
all our effect estimates are conditional on presentation to the hospital. Nonetheless, we
minimized additional selection bias by making cohort criteria for cases and controls differ only
with respect to the outcome of interest. Moreover, we found concordance between
SARS-CoV-2-tested individuals and the general population at NYP/CUIMC in terms of blood
type (Supplementary table 1). Consequently, our results are not affected by selection bias with
respect to blood type, unlike some other blood type case/control study designs—particularly
those using blood donors as controls, where enrichment of type O can be expected [​5​].
False negatives and time delay between test administrations and the return of their results both
introduce noise to this analysis. We attempted to account for these biases by setting cohort entry
at the time of first contact with the hospital when the patient tested positive less than 96 hours
thereafter. This definition is imperfect, as 96 hours is sufficient for an individual infected shortly

after admission to test positive (albeit with probability roughly 0.33) [​65​], but it is necessary to
allow sufficient adjustment for the considerable time delay and retesting following false
negatives. Another source of noise is the fact that not all intubations and deaths following a
confirmed infection are related to COVID-19 (e.g. intubation during unrelated surgery). We
defined recovery in an attempt to minimize this issue, though we recognize our definition is
imperfect. Patients may be discharged prematurely and later return following onset of severe
symptoms. Moreover, our 10 day cutoff for recovery is based on CDC guidelines for returning to
work [​59​,​60​], which may be refined as additional evidence becomes available. Further work is
needed to refine the definition of recovery and to determine which outcomes may be causally
linked to COVID-19.
The ​ABO​ gene is highly polymorphic [​66​], and blood types have considerably different
distributions across ancestry groups [​53​]. Like ABO, Rh groups are not distributed equally
across race/ethnicity groups, with enrichment of Rh-negative among white and non-Hispanic
individuals (Table 1). In addition, negative Rh blood groups are less common, representing only
9% of individuals in our data. While genetic data were not available for the patients included in
our study, we used self-reported race and ethnicity as imperfect proxies for genetic ancestry.
Adjusting for these covariates had a noticeable effect on our comparison of infection prevalence,
but did not have an equally relevant effect on intubation or death (Figure ​1​, Table 2). This
suggests that blood type may have a lesser, more confounded effect on infection prevalence than
on intubation or death following confirmed infection. Nonetheless, race and ethnicity cannot
fully capture ancestry, so the associations between blood types and COVID-19 we report may
still be confounded by ancestry, even after adjustment. Further work is needed to better

understand any potential residual confounding due to ancestry, not captured by race and
ethnicity.

Conclusion
In this study we found evidence for associations between ABO and Rh blood groups and
COVID-19. Using data from NYP/CUIMC, we found moderately increased infection prevalence
among non-O blood types and among Rh-positive individuals. Intubation risk was increased
among AB and B types, and decreased among A and Rh-negative types. Risk of death was
slightly increased among type AB individuals and was decreased among types A, B, and
Rh-negative types. All estimates were adjusted for patient ancestry using self-reported race and
ethnicity. Our results add further evidence to the previously discovered associations between
blood types and COVID-19.

Methods
We identified the cohort for this study by filtering the NYP/CUIMC data warehouse for patients
with a recorded SARS-CoV-2 test and those having a recorded blood type. Next, we removed
any individual with multiple, contradictory blood type measurements, reflecting likely errors in
the data. Finally, we excluded individuals below age 18 from our analysis.
Blood group was determined using laboratory measurements coded using descendant concepts of
LOINC LP36683-8 (ABO and Rh group)​​. Individuals with contradictory measurements were
excluded. Intubation was assessed using completed procedures having the procedure description,
“Intubation.” We grouped race into five categories and ethnicity into two. Specifically, we
considered only Asian, Black/African-American, and White, categorizing other listed races (all
of which were small minorities) as ‘Other’, and missing or declined race as ‘Missing’. Ethnicity
was grouped as either Hispanic or non-Hispanic.

We sought to estimate total effects of blood type on COVID-19 outcomes. Using a graphical
model (Supplementary Figure ​S2​), we identified ancestry as the only confounding variable for an
estimate of total effect, since blood type is genetic and varies across ancestry groups. As genetic
data were not available, we used self-reported race and ethnicity as proxies for ancestry. We
were unable to identify a method to alleviate selection bias in our data, so the effects we report
are conditional on presence at NYP/CUIMC.
We considered three outcomes: initial infection, intubation, and death. Our evaluation of initial
infection sought to assess the infection prevalence differences among individuals presenting to
the hospital, not those potentially infected at the hospital or long after their first test. Due to the
high risk for false negatives [​55​,​56​], we considered any positive test less than 96 hours after the
start of an encounter as evidence of initial infection. Initial infection risk differences between
blood types were assessed using linear regression, and race/ethnicity were adjusted by including
them as covariates. We used Austin’s bootstrap method to compute 95% confidence intervals for
all risk estimates [​54​], using 1000 bootstrap iterations.
We assessed intubation and death as severe outcomes of COVID-19, and evaluated blood type
effects using survival analysis. Individuals entered the at-risk cohort either at the time of their
first positive test result, or at the time of first contact with the hospital when the first positive test
occurred within 96 hours of the start of a hospital encounter. Patients with Do-Not-Intubate
orders were excluded from consideration for the intubation outcome. We defined a patient as
recovered only after being discharged from the hospital and only once 10 days have passed since
cohort entry. Death and recovery are competing risks for intubation, and recovery is a competing
risk for death. Finally, outcomes beyond August 1 were censored, as this was the last date for

Figures
Figure 1: ​Estimated risk differences for blood types during the period from March 10 to
August 1, 2020.​ Values represent risk differences for each blood type relative to the reference
groups: O for ABO and positive for Rh(D). Prevalence risk differences were computed using
linear regression, while intubation and death were computed using the Fine-Gray model [​58​].
Differences and 95% confidence intervals (CI) computed using Austin’s method, including
bootstrap [​54​]. Adjusted models include race and ethnicity as covariates.

Numbers indicate the number of patients in each group. Groups on the right were excluded.

Supplementary Figure 2: G
​ raphical model of the system under investigation.​ We sought to
estimate the total effects of blood type on the COVID-19 outcomes under investigation.
Confounding can be controlled by adjusting for ancestry. Selection bias cannot be controlled
fully, and as a result, our estimates are conditional on presentation to the hospital during the
COVID-19 pandemic.
