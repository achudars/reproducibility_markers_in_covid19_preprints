An outbreak of a novel coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2, that provokes the COVID-19 disease, was first
reported in Hubei, mainland China on 31 December 2019. As of 20 March 2020, cases have been reported in
166 countries/regions, including cases of human-to-human transmission around the world. The proportions of
this epidemics is probably one of the largest challenges faced by our interconnected modern societies. According
to the current epidemiological reports, the large basic reproduction number, R0 ∼ 2.3, number of secondary
cases produced by an infected individual in a population of susceptible individuals, as well as an asymptomatic
period (up to 14 days) in which infectious individuals are undetectable without further analysis, pave the way for
a major crisis of the national health capacity systems. Recent scientific reports have pointed out that the detected
cases of COVID19 at young ages is strikingly short and that lethality is concentrated at large ages. Here we
adapt a Microscopic Markov Chain Approach (MMCA) metapopulation mobility model to capture the spread of
COVID-19. We propose a model that stratifies the population by ages, and account for the different incidences
of the disease at each strata. The model is used to predict the incidence of the epidemics in a spatial population
through time, permitting investigation of control measures. The model is applied to the current epidemic in
Spain, using the estimates of the epidemiological parameters and the mobility and demographic census data of
the national institute of statistics (INE). The results indicate that the peak of incidence will happen in the first
half of April 2020 in absence of mobility restrictions. These results can be refined with improved estimates of
epidemiological parameters, and can be adapted to precise mobility restrictions at the level of municipalities.
The current estimates largely compromises the Spanish health capacity system, in particular that for intensive
care units, from the end of March. However, the model allows for the scrutiny of containment measures that can
be used for health authorities to forecast with accuracy their impact in prevalence of COVID–19. Here we show
by testing different epidemic containment scenarios that we urge to enforce total lockdown to avoid a massive
collapse of the Spanish national health system.

I. INTRODUCTION

As of 20 March 2020 the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has infected more than 270.000 persons worldwide
with COVID-19, killing more than 11.300. Epidemiological analysis of the outbreak have been used to estimate epidemiologically relevant parameters [1–10], and available mathematical models have been used to track and anticipate the spread of the
epidemics [11–17]. Nevertheless, the particularities of the current epidemics calls for a rethinking of conventional models towards tailored ones. Here, we propose mathematical model particularly designed to capture the main ingredients characterising
the propagation of SARS-CoV-2 and the clinical characteristics reported for the cases of COVID-19. To this aim, we rely on
previous metapopulation models by the authors [18–21] including the spatial demographical distribution and recurrent mobility
patterns, and develop a more refined epidemic model that incorporates the stratification of population by age in order to consider
the different epidemiological and clinical features associated to each group age that have been reported so far. The mathematical
formulation of these models rely on the Microscopic Markov Chain Approach formulation for epidemic spreading in complex
networks [22–27].
The epidemic model we propose takes into account several specific characteristics of the dynamics of COVID-19, such as the
important effect of asymptomatic (or with mild symptoms) infectious individuals, which may explain the large incidence of the
epidemics. We also consider the fraction of individuals which require hospitalization to ICU, since their saturation constitutes
one of the major political and health problems of COVID-19 outbreak. The result is a model with seven epidemiological compartments for each of the patches composing the metapopulation. Additionally, we split the former epidemiological partition
into three age groups: young, adults, and elderly people. This partition allows us to capture in a stylised way the main epidemiological, clinical and behavioural differences between the groups. On one hand, SARS-CoV-2 importation and exportation events

between patches are mostly due to the mobility of active population. On the other hand, the medical evolution of COVID-19
displays strong differences across age groups [13, 28, 29]. In this regard, infections in the young group lead to mild symptoms
[30] that, without test, are often confused with those of a common cold, whereas for old individuals the infection evolves towards
more severe symptoms and usually requires hospitalization.
The model incorporates the possibility of designing and evaluating the impact of contention policies to stop the propagation
of SARS-CoV-2. In particular, we focus on those policies relying on global or targeted quarantine measures. They allow the
selection of the optimum degree of mobility to avoid the health system crisis. Taking advantage of this possibility, we explore
several epidemic scenarios characterized by different contention measures promoted on March 20, and evaluate their impact on
the decrease of the epidemic prevalence and the saturation of the Spanish health system.
In a nutshell, the proposed model takes into account in an stylized way three main ingredients taking place in SARS-CoV-2
transmission: (i) the silent transmission of the pathogen through the young portion of the population, (ii) the large potential for
the spatial dissemination of the pathogen provided by the mobility of mature individuals, and (iii) the severe symptoms caused
of COVID-19 in elderly that yields to a dramatic increase of medical and hospital demands. Thus, the model can be viewed as
three coevolving spreading processes with different spatio-temporal scales.

II. EPIDEMIC SPREADING MODEL

We propose a tailored model for the epidemic spread of COVID-19. We use a previous framework for the study of epidemics
in structured metapopulations, with heterogeneous agents, subjected to recurrent mobility patterns [18–20, 31].To understand the
geographical diffusion of the disease, as a result of human-human interactions in small geographical patches, one has to combine
the contagion process with the long-range disease propagation due to human mobility across different spatial scales. For the case
of epidemic modeling, the metapopulation scenario is as follows. A population is distributed in a set of patches, being the size
(number of individuals) of each patch in principle different. The individuals within each patch are well-mixed, i.e., pathogens
can be transmitted from an infected host to any of the healthy agents placed in the same patch with the same probability. The
second aspect of our metapopulation model concerns the mobility of agents. Each host is allowed to change its current location
and occupy another patch, thus fostering the spread of pathogens at the system level. Mobility of agents between different
patches is usually represented in terms of a network where nodes are locations while a link between two patches represents the
possibility of moving between them.
We introduce a set of modifications to the standard metapopulation model to account for the different states relevant for the
description of COVID-19, and also to substitute the well-mixing with a more realistic set of contacts. Another key point is the
introduction of a differentiation of the course of the epidemics that depends on the demographic ages of the population. This
differentiation is very relevant in light of the observation of a scarcely set of infected individuals at ages (< 25), and also because
of the severe situations reported for people at older ages (> 65). Our model is composed of the following epidemiological
compartments: susceptible (S), exposed (E), asymptomatic infectious (A), infected (I), hospitalized to ICU (H), dead (D), and
recovered (R). Additionally, we divide the individuals in NG age strata, and suppose the geographical area is divided in N regions
or patches. Although we present the model in general form, its application to COVID-19 only makes use of the three age groups
mentioned above (NG = 3): young people (Y), with age up to 25; adults (M), with age between 26 and 65; and elderly people
(O), with age larger than 65. See Figure 1 for an sketch of the compartmental epidemic model proposed.
We characterize the evolution of the fraction of agents in state m ∈ {S, E, A, I, H, D, R} and for each age stratum g ∈
{1, . . . , NG }, associated with each patch i ∈ {1, . . . , N }, denoted in the following as ρm,g

These equations correspond to a discrete-time dynamics, in which each time-step represents a day. They are built upon previous
work on Microscopic Markov-Chain Approach (MMCA) modelization of epidemic spreading dynamics [22], but which has also
been applied to other types of processes, e.g., information spreading and traffic congestion [24, 25, 32].
The rationale of the model is the following. Susceptible individuals get infected by contacts with asymptomatic and infected
agents, with a probability Πgi , becoming exposed. Exposed individuals turn into asymptomatic at a certain rate η g , which in
turn become infected at a rate αg . Once infected, two paths emerge, which are reached at an escape rate µg . The first option is
requiring hospitalization in an ICU, with a certain probability γ g ; otherwise, the individuals become recovered. While being at
ICU, individuals have a death probability ω g , which is reached at a rate ψ g . Finally, ICUs discharge at a rate χg , leading to the
recovered compartment. See Table I for a summary of the parameters of the model, and their values to simulate the spreading of
COVID-19 in Spain, which will be discussed in Subsec. IV A.
The value of Πgi (t) encodes the probability that a susceptible agent belonging to age group g and patch i contracts the disease.
Under the model assumptions, this probability is given by:
Πgi (t) = (1 − pg )Pig (t) + pg

j=1

where pg denotes the degree of mobility of individuals within age group g, and Pig (t) denotes the probability that those agents
get infected by the pathogen inside patch i. This way, the first term in the r.h.s. of Eq. (8) denotes the probability of contracting
the disease inside the residence patch, whereas the second term contains those contagions taking place in any of the neighboring
areas. Furthermore, we assume that the number of contacts increases with the density of each area according to a monotonously
increasing function f . Finally, we introduce an age-specific contact matrix, C, whose elements C gh define the fraction of
contacts that individuals of age group g perform with individuals belonging to age group h. With the above definitions, Pig reads

The exponents represent the number of contacts made by an agent of age group g in patch i with infectious individuals —

probability for an individual belonging to age group g not being infected while staying in patch i.
The term z g hk g if (neff

The function f (x) governing the influence of population density has been selected, following [33], as:

The discrete time nature of this model allows for an easy computation of the time evolution of all the relevant variables,
providing information at the regional level. See Sec. IV B for the details of its application to the COVID-19 outbreak in Spain.
Additionally, the model is amenable for analytical inspection, which has allowed us to find the epidemic threshold, see Appendix A.
III. PREDICTION OF INCIDENCE UNDER MOBILITY RESTRICTIONS

Here we assess the performance of different containment measures to reduce the impact of COVID-19 using the mathematical
model. To incorporate containment policies in our formalism, we assume that a given fraction of the population κ0 is isolated at
home. In this sense, let us remark that parameter κ0 allows us to change the level of resolution while studying the propagation
of COVID-19. Namely, with κ0 = 0 we recover the well-mixing assumption within the same municipality described in previous
sections —since active population movements promote the interaction between members from different households— whereas
κ0 = 1 isolates the households from each other, thus constraining the transmission dynamics at the level of household rather than
municipality. From the former assumptions, we compute the average number of contacts of agents belonging to each group g as
hkcg i = (1 − κ0 )hk g i + κ0 (σ − 1) ,

(15)

where the second term in the r.h.s. encodes those contacts occurring within the household, whose size (number of individuals)
is assumed to be σ in average.
In this scenario, a relevant indicator to quantify the efficiency of the policy is the probability of one individual living in a
household, inside a given municipality i, without any infected individual. Assuming that containment is implemented at time tc ,
this quantity, denoted in the following as CH i (tc ), is given by

and Eq. (15) becomes time-dependent:
hk g i(t) = (1 − κ0 Θ(t − tc ))hk g i + κ0 Θ(t − tc )(σ − 1) ,

(17)

where Θ(x) is the Heaviside function, which is 1 if x > 0 and 0 otherwise. Accordingly, the mobility parameters pg change as
pg (t) = (1 − κ0 Θ(t − tc )) pg ,

(18)

which make (ngi )eff and z g also dependent on time, see Eqs. (10)–(12).
This containment strategy is introduced in the dynamical Eqs. (1)–(6) by modifying Eqs. (1) and (2) for the time after tc :

IV. RESULTS
A. Parameters for the modelization of the spreading of COVID-19

In this subsection, we detail our parameters choice to study the current epidemic outbreak in Spain. Regarding epidemiological
parameters, the incubation period has been reported to be η −1 + α−1 = 5.2 days [2] in average which, in our formalism, must be
distributed into the exposed and asymptomatic compartments. In principle, if one does not expect asymptomatic transmissions,
most of this time should be spent inside the exposed compartment, thus being the asymptomatic infectious compartment totally
irrelevant for disease spreading. However, along the line of several recent works [34–36] we have found that the unfolding of
COVID-19 cannot be explained without accounting for infections from individuals not developing any symptoms previously.
In particular, our best fit to reproduce the evolution of the real cases reported so far in Spain yields α−1 = 2.86 days as
asymptomatic infectious period. In turn, the infection period is established as µ−1 = 3.2 days [1, 12], except for the young
strata, for which we have reduced it to 1 day, assigning the remaining 2.2 days as asymptomatic; this is due to the reported
mild symptoms in young individuals, which may become inadvertent [30]. We fix the fatality rate ω = 42% of ICU patients by
studying historical records of dead individuals as a function of those requiring intensive care. In turn, we estimate the period
from ICU admission to death as ψ −1 = 7 days [37] and the stay in ICU for those overcoming the disease as χ−1 = 10 days
[38].
Regarding the population structure in Spain, we have obtained the population distribution, population pyramid, daily population flows and average household size at the municipality level from Instituto Nacional de Estadı́stica [39] whereas the
age-specific contact matrices have been extracted from [40].

B. Prediction of the evolution of COVID-19 in Spain

Equations (1)–(7) enable to monitor the spatio-temporal propagation of COVID-19 across Spain. To check the validity of our
formalism, we aggregate the number of cases predicted for each municipality at the level of autonomous regions (comunidades
autónomas), which is a first-level political and administrative division, and compare them with the number of cases daily reported
by the Spanish Health Ministry. In this sense, we compute the number of cases predicted for each municipality i at each time
step t as:
Casesi (t) =

(23)

g=1

As our model is designed to predict the emergence of autochthonous cases triggered by local contagions and commuting
patterns, those imported infected individuals corresponding to the first reported cases in Spain are initially plugged into our model
as asymptomatic infectious agents. In addition, small infectious seeds should be also placed in those areas where anomalous
outbreaks have occurred due to singular events such as one funeral in Vitoria leading to more than 60 contagions. Overall, the
total number of infectious seeds is 47 individuals which represents 0.2 % of the number of cases reported by March 20, 2020.
Figure 2 shows that our model is able to accurately predict not only the overall evolution of the total number of cases at
the national scale but also their spatial distribution across the different autonomous regions. Moreover, the most typical trend
observed so far is an exponential growth of the number of cases, thus clearly suggesting that the disease is spreading freely in
most of the territories. Note, however, that there are some exceptions such as La Rioja or Paı́s Vasco in which some strong
policies targeting the most affected areas were previously promoted to slow down COVID-19 propagation.
To assess the impact of containment policies, we now theoretically study the effects of tuning the isolation rate κ0 controlling
the fraction of population staying at home. Figure 3 shows the temporal evolution of the individuals requiring intensive care units
while applying the isolation policy by March 20, 2020. Interestingly, it becomes clear that there are two different regimes. For
small κ0 values, the observed behavior corresponds to the flattening of the epidemic curve while promoting social distancing.
This way, increasing κ0 leads to longer epidemic periods with much less impact within society in terms of hospitalized agents.
In contrast, for large enough κ0 values, the effective isolation of households allows for reducing at the same time the epidemic
size and the duration of the epidemic wave. This is mainly caused by the depletion [41] of susceptible individuals which prevents
the infectious individuals from sustaining the outbreak by infecting healthy peers.
Finally, we address the important health problem arising from the saturation of ICU beds. For this purpose, we study the
evolution of individuals requiring intensive care units by fixing κ0 = 0.80 from March 20, 2020. To quantify the overload
of ICU capacity, in Figure 4 we compare the predictions yielded by our equations with the total number of beds within each
autonomous region which we estimate as the 3% of the total number of hospital beds. There we find that the saturation of
hospitals across Spain is not uniform but strongly depends on both the current extension of the outbreak and the available
resources in each autonomous region.

V. DISCUSSION

We have presented a mathematical model based on a Microscopic Markov Chain Approach (MMCA) for the spatio-temporal
spreading of COVID–19. The model captures human behavior features such as: the urban demography, age strata, age-structured
contact patterns, and daily recurrent mobility flows. Importantly, the epidemiological and human characteristics present in this
model provides with the possibility of a rapid and reliable evaluation of different containment policies.
We have applied the results to the validation and projection of the propagation of COVID–19 in Spain. Our results reveal
that, at the current stage of the epidemics, the application of stricter containment measures of social distance are urgent to avoid
the collapse of the health system. Moreover, we are close to an scenario in which the complete lockdown appears as the only
possible measure to avoid the former situation. Other scenarios can be prescribed and analyzed after lockdown, as for example
pulsating open-closing strategies or targeted herd immunity.

These tensors encode the four different ways in which the epidemic interactions may take place: individuals belonging to the
same patch i = j and not moving (M1 ); interaction in the patch of i with individuals coming from patch j (M2 ); interaction in
the patch of j with individuals coming from patch i (M3 ); and individuals from i and j interacting at any other patch k (M4 ).
In the next generation matrix framework, we only need to consider the epidemic compartments. Making use of the above
definitions, the corresponding differential equations take the form:

With the above differential equation, the reproduction number is given by:
R0 = Λmax (F V −1 )

We can calculate the inverse of the tensor V as (V −1 )gh = (V g )−1 δ gh ⊗ 1N ×N . The inverse of the matrix V g is given by:

As we look for the eigenvectors of the tensor F V −1 , we note that their components associated to the compartments A and I —
rows 2 and 3— must be zero, since the associated rows in the above matrix are zero. To be more precise, we have (F V −1 u)gi = 0
for i = 2N + 1, . . . 3N , which are the elements associated to the compartments A and I. Accordingly, we can restrict the above
matrix only to the vector space associated to the compartment E and the eigenvalues will be equivalent, which gives us:
R0 = Λmax (Z) ,
where Z gh =
