Abstract

32

Background

33

The current standard for COVID-19 diagnosis, RT-qPCR, has important drawbacks for its use as a tool

34

for epidemiological control, including the need of laboratory-processing, high cost, and long turnaround

35

from sampling to results release. Antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDT) provide a promising

36

alternative for this purpose.

37

Methods

38

We assessed the analytical and clinical performance of the Ag-RDT Panbio COVID-19 Ag Test (Abbott),

39

using RT-qPCR as a reference test. The clinical performance was assessed using nasopharyngeal swabs,

40

collected in routine practice for case confirmation and contact tracing, and nasal mid-turbinate swabs,

41

collected in preventive screenings of asymptomatic individuals. Fresh samples were analysed by RT-q-

42

PCR, stored at -80 ºC, and analysed using the Ag-RDT according to the manufacturer instructions.

43

Findings

44

The Ag-RDT had a limit of detection of 6·5×105 copies/reaction. The clinical performance was assessed

45

on 1,406 frozen swabs with a PCR result available: 951 (67·7%) positive and 455 (32·4%) negative. The

46

Ag-RDT identified the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in 872 of 951 PCR-positive samples (91·7%; 95% CI

47

89·8-93·4 and ruled out its presence in 450 of 455 PCR-negative samples (specificity 98·9%; 95% CI 97·5

48

– 99·6). Sensitivity increased in samples with lower Ct values (Ct <25, 98·2%; Ct<30, 94·9%) and was

49

higher among symptomatic cases (92·6%) and their contacts (94·2%) than among asymptomatic

50

individuals (79·5%). In the setting of asymptomatic screening, sensitivity also increased with lower Ct

51

values (Ct <25, 100%; Ct<30, 98·6%). Assuming a pre-test probability of 5%, the negative and positive

52

predictive values were 99·6% (99·5 – 99·6) and 81·5% (65·0 – 93·2), respectively.

53

Interpretation

54

The Panbio COVID-19 Ag-RDT has high sensitivity for detecting the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in nasal

55

or nasopharyngeal swabs of both, symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. The diagnostic

56

performance of the test is particularly good in samples with viral loads associated with high risk of viral

57

transmission (Ct <25), which show high positive and negative predictive values even when assuming a

58

prevalence as low as 5%.

Research in context

63

Evidence before this study

64

On October 6, 2020, we searched PubMed for articles containing “Antigen”, “test”, “SARS-CoV-2”,

65

“COVID-19” and “performance” in either the title or the abstract. We found five studies that showed the

66

accuracy of point-of-care tests in identifying SARS-CoV-2 antigens for confirmation of clinically

67

suspected COVID-19. We found high variability in the diagnostic accuracy of Ag-RDT. Most tests

68

showed high specificity (i.e., 99% or higher), whereas sensitivity ranged from 11% to 92%; only one test

69

reported sensitivity higher than 60%. We found no studies investigating the diagnostic accuracy of the

70

Panbio COVID-19 Ag Test. We found no studies that assessed the performance of Ag-RDT for

71

population-level screening of asymptomatic individuals.

72

Added value of this study

73

Our analysis provides information regarding the diagnostic accuracy of the Panbio COVID-19 Ag Test

74

when tested on 1,406 frozen samples of nasopharyngeal and nasal swabs collected in routine practice for

75

diagnostic confirmation of symptomatic individuals with suspected COVID-19 or contacts exposed to a

76

positive case, and preventive screenings of unexposed asymptomatic individuals. Compared with RT-

77

qPCR as reference test, the Ag-RDT showed a sensitivity and specificity of 91·7% and 98·9%. Test

78

sensitivity increased in samples with viral load associated with high risk of transmission (Ct <25),

79

reaching more than 98%, regardless of the presence of symptoms.

80

Implications of all the available evidence

81

Available evidence show variability in the diagnostic performance of marketed Ag-RDT. Our results

82

provide substantial evidence that the point-of-care Panbio COVID-19 Ag Test can accurately identify

83

SARS-CoV-2 antigens in people with suspected clinical COVID-19 as well as in asymptomatic people

84

with high viral load and therefore, associated with higher risk of transmission. This finding represents a

85

potentially useful advance for mass screening of asymptomatic people at the point-of-care.

Introduction

89

Strategies for early identification of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)

90

cases and their contacts are a mainstay for containing the viral spread. Reverse transcription-polymerase

91

chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis of nasopharyngeal swabs remains the gold standard for identifying the

92

presence of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. However, the need for laboratory-processing, high cost, and long

93

turnaround from sampling to results release limits the feasibility of this technique for community-based

94

testing strategies. The growing body of evidence on the lack of infectivity of cases with low viral load1,2

95

suggests that frequent testing with rapid diagnostic tests Antigen-detecting RDTs (Ag-RDT) even those

96

with low sensitivity may be more adequate than RT-qPCR for epidemiological control of the SARS-

97

CoV-2.3 Furthermore, preliminary data on the performance of Ag-RDTs suggest that their sensitivity

98

increases with the viral load, reaching 99% when testing specimens with high viral loads.4,5

99

Ag-RDTs, commonly used in the diagnosis of infectious respiratory diseases, have recently become

100

available for the identification of SARS-CoV-2.6 Tests designed for clinical diagnosis of symptomatic

101

people require high analytic sensitivity. In contrast, test requirements7 for a containment strategy of

102

COVID-19 are rapid turnaround time (i.e., less than 20 minutes), low cost, and ease-of-use to allow

103

frequent testing at the point-of-care.8–12

104

Currently, the WHO recommends using Ag-RDTs to support diagnosis of cases and contacts during

105

outbreak investigations and monitor trends in disease incidence, particularly in remote settings or closed

106

groups (e.g., schools, care homes, or prisons), but not to screen asymptomatic populations.6 In this study,

107

we investigated the performance of a SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDT for confirmation of clinically suspected

108

COVID-19 and their contacts using nasopharyngeal specimens, and for community screening of

109

asymptomatic people using nasal mid-turbinate specimens.

Methods

112

Test selection

113

After a literature review and web search13 for SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen-based tests, we selected four

114

candidates deemed potentially suitable for diagnosis and screening strategies: COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip

115

(Coris BioConcept, Gembloux, Belgium), Standard Q COVID-19 Ag Test (SD Biosensor, Suwon, South

116

Korea), Standard F COVID-19 Ag FIA (SD Biosensor, Suwon, South Korea), and PanbioTM COVID-19

117

Ag Test (Abbott Laboratories, Illinois, USA). The selected tests were pre-screened by triplicate on 40

118

frozen samples of nasopharyngeal swabs with known PCR result (Table S1, Supplementary Material).

119

Based on the pre-screening results, the Panbio COVID-19 Ag Test was selected for the assessment of

120

analytical and clinical performance.

121

The Panbio™ COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device is a chromatographic, immunoassay-based platform. For

122

a positive result, a gold conjugate human IgG specific to SARS-CoV-2 Ag and anti-SARS-CoV-2

123

antibody form a test line in the result window.

124
125

Analytical performance of antigen rapid tests

126

The analytical performance of the Ag-RDT test was assessed using a SARS-CoV-2 isolate (ID

127

EPI_ISL_510689) propagated in Vero E6 cells (ATCC CRL-1586). The median tissue culture infective

128

dose (TCID50), defined as the dilution that caused cytopathic effect in 50% of the inoculated cell cultures,

129

was calculated by titrating a passage 3 SARS-CoV-2 stock into Vero E6 cells and culturing them at 37 ºC

130

in a 5% CO2 incubator for six days. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM;

131

Lonza) supplemented with 5% foetal calf serum (FCS; EuroClone), 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL

132

streptomycin, and 2 mM glutamine (all ThermoFisher Scientific).

133

The analytical sensitivity was estimated by testing in triplicate eight ten-fold serial dilutions of the SARS-

134

CoV-2 suspension in PBS (Lonza). All samples were cross-validated by RT-qPCR and virus isolation in

135

Vero E6 cells. RT-qPCR for genomic detection (UpE assay; Corman et al., 2020) was conducted from

136

viral RNA extracted using the Indimag Pathogen kit (Indical Biosciences) from all serial dilutions on a

137

Biosprint 96 workstation (Qiagen). A plasmid containing the complete envelope gene (GenBank

138

NC_045512.2; IDT, Inc.) was used to quantify the amount of SARS-CoV-2 genome copies of each

139

sample. Virus isolation was performed in 16 replicates by inoculating 50 µL of each replicate per well

140

(containing15,000 Vero E6 cells, seeded in 96-well plates), and incubating for 1 h at 37ºC in a 5% CO2

141

atmosphere. Then, 100 µL of supplemented DMEM were added to each well and the plates were

142

maintained at 37ºC and 5% CO2. Plates were daily monitored under the light microscope and wells were

143

evaluated for the presence of cytopathic effect for 6 days.

144
145

Clinical performance

146

The clinical performance of the Ag-RDT was assessed using RT-qPCR as a reference test with a cycle

147

threshold (Ct) < 40 as the criteria for a positive result. Samples consisted of nasopharyngeal swabs

148

collected in routine practice for diagnostic confirmation of symptomatic individuals with suspected

149

COVID-19 or contacts exposed to a positive case, and nasal mid-turbinate swabs collected in preventive

screenings of unexposed asymptomatic individuals in the general population. Swab specimens were

151

placed into sterile tubes containing viral transport media (DeltaSwab Virus, Deltalab, Ref 304301). RT-

152

qPCR tests were performed on fresh samples stored at 2 – 8 ºC for up to 72 hours; samples were then

153

stored at –80 ºC until their use for Ag-RDT.

154

Samples were classified according to the disease status of the participant (i.e., suspected symptomatic

155

case, exposed asymptomatic contact, and unexposed asymptomatic individual) based on the national

156

guideline definitions. Individuals’ data were collected anonymously and handled according to the General

157

Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 on data protection and privacy for all individuals within the

158

European Union and the local regulatory framework regarding data protection.

159

RNA for RT-qPCR tests were extracted from fresh samples using the viral RNA/Pathogen Nucleic Acid

160

Isolation kit, optimized for a KingFisher instrument according to the manufacturer’s instructions. PCR

161

amplification was conducted according to the recommendations of the 2019-nCoV RT-qPCR Diagnostic

162

Panel of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).14 Briefly, a 20 L PCR reaction mix was

163

prepared that contained 5 L of RNA, 1·5 L of N3 primers and probe (2019-nCov CDC EUA Kit,

164

catalog no. 10006770, Integrated DNA Technologies), and 5 L of TaqPath 1-StepRT-qPCR Master Mix

165

(Thermo Fischer). Thermal cycling was performed on either Applied Biosystems 7500 or QuantStudio5

166

Real-Time PCR instruments (Thermo Fischer) at the following conditions: 15 min at 50 ºC for reverse

167

transcription, followed by 2 min at 95°C, and then 45 cycles of 3 sec at 95°C and 30 sec at 55°C.

168

Rapid antigen tests were performed according to the manufacturer’s IFU (Abbott, Illinois, USA) except

169

for the use of a viral transport media (DeltaSwab Virus) and swab storage as a frozen specimen. Internal

170

validation showed no significant change in the test performance using Abbot test Kit buffer or a mix of

171

the Kit buffer and transport media at 1:3 dilution; likewise, the use of frozen specimens showed no

172

significant differences compared with fresh ones. All Ag-RDT determinations were performed by two

173

blinded technicians, who used 100 L of 1:3 mix of the Kit buffer and the sample previously thawed and

174

homogenized. Samples were applied directly to the test cassette and incubated for 15 minutes at room

175

temperature before reading results at naked eye, according to the manufacturer instructions (i.e., the

176

presence of any test line (T), no matter how faint, indicates a positive result).

194

Results

195

The initial viral stock of SARS-CoV-2 used for analytical performance was titrated on Vero E6 cells,

196

obtaining a 106·4 TCID50/mL. This value corresponded to an average viral load of 6·8 × 108 genome

197

copies/reaction measured by RT-qPCR. The Ag-RDT yielded positive results in viral stock dilutions of

198

1:103 and higher, corresponding to a limit of detection (LoD) of 6·5 × 105 genome copies/reaction as

199

assessed by RT-qPCR (Table 1).

200

The clinical performance was analysed on 1,406 frozen swabs with a RT-qPCR result available: 951

201

(67·6%) positive and 455 (32·4%) negative. The mean age of the sampled individuals was 40·4 years, and

202

936 (66·6%) were female (Table 2). The Ct value was <20 in 258 (18·3%) samples, 20-to-24 in 305

203

(21·7%), 25-to-29 in 285 (20·3%), and >30 in 103 (7·3%). Nasopharyngeal swabs had been collected in

204

the setting of diagnosis confirmation in symptomatic cases (446/1406, 31·7%) and contact tracing

205

(473/1406, 33·6%), and mid-turbinate nasal swabs were collected in mass screening campaigns

206

(487/1406, 34·6%).

207

Overall, the Ag-RDT identified the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in 872 of 951 PCR-positive samples

208

(sensitivity 91·7%; 95% CI 89·8 – 93·4 and ruled out its presence in 450 of 455 PCR-negative samples

209

(specificity 98·9%; 95% CI 97·5 – 99·6) (Table 3). Samples with lower Ct values (i.e., a cut-off Ct <25 is

210

associated with an increased risk of infectiousness19–21) showed higher sensitivity than the overall sample

211

(Ct <25, 98.2%; Ct<30, 94.9%). Sensitivity was significantly higher among samples collected in the

212

setting of case identification (92·6%) and contact tracing (94·2%) than asymptomatic screening

213

(79·5%)(Table 3).

214

However, we did not observe significant differences regarding the sensitivity estimates according to Ct

215

value category between disease status groups (Figure 1A). In the setting of asymptomatic screening,

216

sensitivity of samples with Ct <25 and <30 were 100% and 98.6%, respectively. All samples (except one)

217

that tested negative for Ag-RDT in this setting had Ct values greater than 30 (Figure 1B).

218

Figure 2 shows the results of the modelling of the PPV and NPV based on the diagnostic performance

219

parameters found in the overall sample. At a pre-test probability of 5%, generally assumed for

220

asymptomatic screening in high-risk settings,22 the NPV was 99·6% (99·5 – 99·7) (Table 4) and increased

221

as the pre-test probability dropped. Correspondingly, the PPV at 5% pre-test probability was 81·5% (65·0

222

– 93·2), and decreased as pre-test probability decreased. At this pre-test probability, the estimated number

223

of false-negative and false-positive values per thousand tests were 4 (3 – 5) and 12 (4 – 27), respectively

224

(Figure S1, TableS2).

225
226

Discussion

227

We showed that the point-of-care diagnostic Panbio COVID-19 Ag Test had 91·7% sensitivity and 98·9%

228

specificity compared to standard laboratory-based RT-qPCR. Sensitivity was 99·0% for samples with Ct

229

<25 corresponding to people at the peak of their infection, when the viral load is highest and most

230

contagious. In nasal swab specimens from asymptomatic individuals tested in the setting of preventive

231

screenings of the general population, sensitivity was 74·5%, although it increased to 98·9% among

232

samples with a Ct value of <25 in this setting.

233

The high sensitivity of this Ag-RDT observed at higher viral loads is extremely relevant for the use of this

234

test as a tool for epidemiological control of the SARS-CoV-2 spread because of the accumulating

235

evidence on the high infectiousness of respiratory specimens with viral loads above 106 genome copies

236

/mL (which usually correspond to a Ct of approximately <25).1,2,23 Various studies have identified the Ct

237

value of 25 as a threshold below which only a small proportion of viruses can be cultured (25% for

238

Ct>30, 8% for Ct>35).19 Also, when looking at contact tracing, the secondary attack rate increases

239

significantly for values of Ct<25,20 indicating notably higher infectiousness among individuals with viral

240

loads below this threshold.

241

Although the Panbio COVID-19 Ag device might overlook SARS-CoV-2 infection in individuals with

242

very low viral load (i.e., below the LoD of 6·8 × 105 SARS-CoV-2 genomic copies per reaction), it may

243

be suitable for identifying people with high potential for infectivity. The level of viral RNA copies rises

244

from undetectable to millions of RNA copy numbers/mL (equivalent to Ct > 40 to Ct < 25) in the order of

245

a day and then decreases to below an infectious level by day 10 in most patients with mild infection. For

246

some individuals, low levels of viral RNA can remain detectable by RT-qPCR for months.24,25 Many

247

people whose infection are detected during community screening using high-analytic-sensitivity RT-

248

qPCR are no longer infectious at the time of detection. The Ag-RDT reliably identifies people with high

249

viral loads and therefore it could be useful for screening strategies to identify and isolate asymptomatic

250

COVID-19 people while they are still infectious. Such a test could be used in focal screening to create

251

safe environments in social activities with high-risk of transmission (e.g., visiting relatives at nursing

252

homes, playing sports, going to a crowded place like movie theatres, music concerts, airports). It could

253

also be used for mass screening in communities with high transmission or even for at-home frequent use.

Our study is strengthened by the large sample size and the blinding of the technicians who processed and

255

read the results of the Ag-RDT. On the other hand, it has the limitation of not using the test under the

256

conditions specified by the manufacturer. Our results indicate that the test can be used on frozen samples

257

stored in transport media, thus allowing parallel sampling for Ag-RDT and PCR. However, caution

258

should be taken when using coloured media that may affect the background of the test thin layer. In our

259

experience, a 1:3 dilution with the Kit buffer prevented unspecific signal of yellow-coloured transport

260

media and provided adequate results; nevertheless, we encourage validating this type of approaches

261

before using the test. Likewise, our study was performed on stored samples rather than in a real-life

262

setting. Owing to this last limitation, common in other assessments of the clinical performance of RDT in

263

general,26 we simulated the PPV and NPV assuming a prevalence of disease based on surveillance

264

estimates. According to our simulation, in a low prevalence setting (i.e., 5% prevalence or below), the

265

NPV would be very high (99·6%), and screening will result in 4 (95% CI 3 – 5) false-negative results per

266

thousand tests; the corresponding PPV would be relatively low (81·5%), stressing the need for

267

confirmatory testing with nucleic acid amplification techniques. Irrespective of the predictive values, one

268

must not lose sight of the relationship between the viral load and test sensitivity, a double-edged sword

269

that better suits this test for ensuring lack of infectivity of a subject along a limited time period following

270

test conduct.

271

A widely available, quick, unexpensive and accurate test could be game-changing and dramatically

272

reduce community transmission of the virus. Newly infected people could isolate at home, severing

273

transmission chains, and stopping the spread of the virus. We provide evidence on the high performance

274

of the Panbio COVID-19 Ag-RDT to screen people with symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2

275

infection at high risk of virus transmission.
