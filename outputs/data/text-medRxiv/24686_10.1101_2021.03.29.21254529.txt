educational effects of COVID-19, potentially impacting on mental health. Understanding the

impact of COVID-19 on AYA with cancer is important to inform care.

METHODS: Online survey of 16-24 year olds receiving cancer treatment at 8 cancer centres

in the UK in December 2020. We measured: self-perceived increased anxiety since COVID-

19, impact of COVID-19 on treatment, life and relationships and used the 8-item Patient

Health Questionnaire(PHQ-8), 7-item Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale(GAD) and the 2-

item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale(CD-RISC).

RESULTS: 112 AYA participated (17.8% of total eligible). 62.8% were female, 67.3% were 21-

24 years. 83% were white. 59.8% had previously experienced mental

health difficulties.

67.9% received cancer treatment during the pandemic and 33.9% were diagnosed during

the pandemic. 78.6% reported COVID-19 having a significant impact on their life, 55.4% on

their

and

on

CONCLUSIONS: We found high levels of psychological distress in AYA with cancer, which is

important knowledge for clinical teams working with this age group. Perceived impact of

COVID-19 on relationships and life was predictive of poorer mental health, with resilience a

potential protective factor.

SARS-CoV-2 pandemic

At the time of writing, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (COVID-19) has infected over 120 million

people globally, and caused over 2.6 million deaths [1]. Though the highest risk factor for

severe physical complications from SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with cancer has been

age, adolescents and young adults (AYA) with cancer have faced significant challenges as a

result of the pandemic.

As for many patients with cancer, care has been disrupted [2] and

for some, initial presentations and diagnoses appear to have been delayed [3]. Concerns

that AYA with cancer may be more at risk for severe complications of COVID-19, in particular

those in treatment with immunocompromise [4], has led to some patients being advised to

shield. Together with the broader population public health “lockdowns”, this has potentially

led to isolation and loneliness [5] and household income and food insecurity [6]. Indeed,

AYA patients with cancer form part of age group who have been disproportionately affected

by economic and educational impacts of “lockdowns” with potentially significant knock-on

effects on mental health [7].

Cancer is an important health burden for AYA globally [8], and around 2500 16-24 year olds

diagnosed with cancer per year in the United Kingdom (UK) [9]. As a group, AYA with cancer

are known to have high levels of psychological distress compared to both healthy peers and

older adult cancer patients [10, 11] as well as patients of a similar age with other medical

conditions.[12]

Psychological

is

associated

with

both

increased morbidity and reduced concordance with treatment regimes which can adversely

affect quality of life and potentially prognosis [13, 14].

How the additional pressures during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic may have impacted on the

psychological wellbeing of AYA with cancer is therefore an important question, and one for

which there is currently limited published data. A recent multi-disciplinary position paper

has called for timely research to understand the effect of COVID-19 on mental health as well

as better understanding possible risk and protective factors [15]. This information is needed

urgently to inform current AYA cancer patient needs and appropriate service delivery in the

context of the pandemic. We studied psychological wellbeing in AYA cancer patients in the

UK during COVID-19 using a longitudinal online survey, and present complete baseline data

here.

Methods
We recruited AYA patients who had received a cancer diagnosis between the ages of 16-24

years, and were currently engaged with cancer services at 8 UK centres to participate in an

identified by local treatment teams and invited to take part in the survey via text message

or email from a direct member of their NHS treating AYA team. The study is a longitudinal

survey with 3 time points spanning 6 months, and currently only baseline data is available

which we present here.

We asked participants to provide the demographics information on: current age group, age

group at diagnosis, ethnicity, gender, eligibility in the past for free school meals (as a proxy

for deprivation), living arrangements, diagnosis, treatment type and stage, whether they

had been advised to shield, whether they were diagnosed or received active treatment

during the pandemic, and whether they have a pre-existing mental health condition.

We asked

participants to report whether they had experienced more, less or no change in anxiety

since COVID-19 began.

We also asked participants to respond to a series of statements

using a 6-point Likert scale (strongly disagree, disagree, neither agree nor disagree, agree,

strongly agree). Statements were: 1) overall, COVID-19 has had a significant impact on my

life. 2) COVID-19 has made having or having had cancer/a brain tumour harder than it

otherwise would have been. 3) COVID-19 has made me feel anxious about returning to

hospital for appointments or treatment. 4) COVID-19 has had an impact on my treatment

and/or care. 5) COVID-19 has had a significant impact on my key relationships.

We also used the 2-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) as a brief self-rating

questionnaire of resilience. The CD-RISC has demonstrated good reliability and validity in a

number of populations, which include a sample of cancer patients and a non-clinical sample

of teenage and young adult students [20]. A total raw score ranging from 0-8 is yielded with

a higher score indicating greater resilience.

Analyses were conducted using STATA (version 16). We reported summary descriptive data

as proportions or averages (reported as means with standard deviations (SD) for normally

distributed data

and median and IQR for non-normally distributed data). We generated

binary variables for: 1) Likert agreement statements divided into any degree of agreement

versus any degree of no agreement, 2) GADS-7and PHQ-8 moderate to severe versus mild or

none; 3) a little or a lot more anxious since COVID-19 versus same or less. We then used

logistic regression models (thus reporting odd’s ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals)

Results
We recruited 112 participants from 628 eligible patients across the 8 centres at the time of

the survey (17.8%).

Baseline participant characteristics are shown in table 1.

The sample

contained a greater proportion of females (n=71, 62.8%) and the most common age group

was 21-24 years (n=76, 67.3%). 18 (15.9%) of participants had been eligible for free school

meals. Ethnicity was 83% white, 8.9% black or Asian, 0.9% Chinese and 7.2% mixed or other.

The main diagnostic groups were haematological, neurological, head and neck, and skin

cancers (see table 1).

68.8% were advised to shield and 59.8% had previously experienced

mental health difficulties requiring psychological input. 67.9% received cancer treatment

Discussion
In our sample of AYA cancer patients from 8 centres in the UK, we found high levels of

reported psychological distress, with around 80% of respondents reporting some degree of

increased anxiety since the beginning of COVID-19, and around 40% meeting moderate to

severe cut-offs on both the PHQ-8 and GADS-7 respectively. This is concerning given the

known impact that psychological distress can have on cancer treatment in AYA with cancer

[13]. We believe this to be the first study to examine for participants’ own perception of

COVID-19 impact on their treatment, lives and relationships.

A majority of participants

reported that COVID-19 had made a significant impact on their lives and their relationships,

and had made their experience of cancer harder. Impact on life and relationships were

found to be associated with psychological measures of depression and anxiety, in particular

Our findings are similar to those reported by Kosir et al [21] who early in the pandemic

similarly used an online survey to examine depression and anxiety using the PHQ-4 item

scale for depression and a 2-item scale for anxiety in 177 AYA cancer patients aged 18-39

years in Slovenia and the UK during the early stages of the pandemic in April 2020.

Within the constraints of our sample size, we believe that the findings in our survey provides
