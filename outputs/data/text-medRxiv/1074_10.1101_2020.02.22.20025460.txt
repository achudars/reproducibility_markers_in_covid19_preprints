Background

36

The recent outbreak of infections by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), the third

37

zoonotic CoV has raised great public health concern. The demand for rapid and accurate

38

diagnosis of this novel pathogen brought significant clinical and technological challenges.

39

Currently, metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) and reverse-transcription PCR

40

(RT-PCR) are the most widely used molecular diagnostics for 2019-nCoV.

41

Methods

42

2019-nCoV infections were confirmed in 52 specimens by mNGS. Genomic information was

43

analyzed and used for the design and development of an isothermal, CRISPR-based

44

diagnostic for the novel virus. The diagnostic performance of CRISPR-nCoV was assessed

45

and also compared across three technology platforms (mNGS, RT-PCR and CRISPR)

INTRODUCTION

56

Since the beginning of 2020, a surging number of pneumonia caused by infections of a novel

57

coronavirus (2019-nCoV) have been identified in China, especially Wuhan, a metropolitan

58

city with a population of over 10 million.[1, 2] In recent days, the outbreak has affected

59

multiple countries and caused worldwide impact.[3-6] Currently, nucleic-acid based tests

60

have been widely used as the reference method for the diagnosis of 2019-nCoV.[7] As of

61

now, more than 30,000 individuals have been identified with 2019-nCoV infection. As the

62

epidemic develops, there are increasing demands for rapid and sensitive diagnostics for the

63

novel pathogen.

64

Coronaviruses (CoVs) are positive-sense, single-strand RNA viruses, with four major

65

structural proteins including spike (S), membrane (M), envelop (E) and nucleoprotein (N).[8,

66

9] Prior to 2019-nCoV, there were six CoVs that were known to be pathogenic to humans:

67

HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-229E and highly transmissible and

68

pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. [10-12]

69

The epidemic of 2019-nCoV was first discovered by metagenomic next-generation

70

sequencing (mNGS) in which the novel virus was found to be a new pathogenic member of

71

the betacoronavirus genus but shared only about 79% in genetic similarity with SARS.[8, 9]

72

Currently, metagenomics and RT-PCR are two molecular approaches most commonly used

73

diagnostics for this novel virus. [13,14] However, the diagnostic performance of different

74

molecular methods have not been investigated.

75

Although CRISPR/Cas has been widely used as a programmable tool for gene editing since

76

2013, the collateral, promiscuous cleavage activities of a unique group of Cas nucleases only

77

discovered recently and harnessed for in vitro nucleic acid detection.[15-19]

78

Here, to address this question and the expanding clinical needs, we developed CRISPR-nCoV,

79

a rapid assay for 2019-nCoV detection, and compared the diagnostic performance among

80

three different technological platforms: metagenomic sequencing, RT-PCR and CRISPR. To

81

our knowledge, this is the first report on cross-platform comparison and the evaluation of an

82

isothermal, CRISPR-based assay for 2019-nCoV that's rapid, sensitive and with low

83

instrument requirement.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

86

Study participants and sample collection

87

This study used excess RNA samples from patients with suspected 2019-nCoV infection

88

based on clinical, chest imaging and epidemiological evidence. No patient identifiable

89

information was collected. The only data collected from the samples were types of specimens

90

(nasopharyngeal swab or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid), the concentrations and volumes of

91

the purified total RNA. A total of sixty-one 2019-nCoV-suspected samples were included in

92

this study. Among which, 52 was confirmed positive by mNGS. This study was approved by

93

the ethical review committee of Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical

94

Sciences & Peking Union Medical College. Written informed consent was waived given the

95

context of emerging infectious diseases.

mNGS Assay for 2019-nCoV

98

The RNA concentrations were measured by a Qubit Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific,

99

Carlsbad, CA, USA). Sequencing libraries were constructed by a transposase-based

100

methodology with ribosomal RNA depletion (Vision Medicals, China). Sequencing was

101

performed on a Nextseq sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, CA). At least 10 million single-end

102

75bp reads were generated for each sample. Quality control processes included removal of

103

low-complexity reads, low-quality reads and short reads, as well as adapter trimming. Reads

104

derived from host genome were then removed. Taxonomic assignment of the clean reads was

105

performed by aligning against the reference databases, including archaea, bacteria, fungi,

106

human, plasmid, protozoa, univec, and virus sequences. A negative control sample was

107

processed and sequenced in parallel for each sequencing run for contamination control.

108
109

Phylogenetic analysis

110

Phylogenetic trees were constructed based on the genome sequences by means of the

111

maximum-likelihood method. Alignment of multiple sequences was performed with the

112

ClustalW program (MEGA software, version 7.0.14).

155

For the evaluation of LoD by the number of DNA copies, DNA of the 2019-nCoV plasmid

156

was purified and the concentration was determined by a Qubit (Thermo Fisher,

157

Massachusetts). The copy number concentration was then calculated based the weight and the

158

length of fragment. Serial dilution with nuclease-free water was done to achieve desired

159

concentrations. 2.5μl of extracted DNA at each titer was used as templates. Ten replicates

160

were performed at each data point near detection limit.

161
162

Statistical analysis

163

Comparative analysis was conducted by Pearson χ2 test, Fisher exact test, the Student’s t-test

164

or log-rank test where appropriate. Data analyses were performed using SPSS 22.0

165

software. P values <0.05 were considered significant, and all tests were 2-tailed unless

166

indicated otherwise.

RESULTS

169

Identification of 2019-nCoV by mNGS

170

In order to develop a targeted assay for the novel virus, we obtained total RNA samples

171

from 61 cases suspected for 2019-nCoV infection and subjected them to metagenomic

172

next-generation sequencing (mNGS), the method by which this novel virus was initially

173

identified. Briefly, RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA to prepare for the sequencing

174

library. Each library was subjected to high-throughput sequencing. Sequenced reads were

175

aligned to a curated database for taxonomic classification and identification of 2019-nCoV

176

genomic sequences.

177

Among the 61 suspected nCoV specimens, we were able to confirm 52 cases with read

178

numbers mapping to the novel virus across 6 orders of magnitudes (median read of 1,484,

179

from 2 to 19,016,501). The median genome coverage and sequencing depth was 46.8%

180

(2.8%-100%) and 12.0× (1.0×-7870.1×), respectively (Figure 1A). These findings indicate a

181

high degree of variation in viral loads of nCoV infections. As shown in the phylogenetic trees,

182

2019-nCoV genome identified in our specimens were highly conserved with the Wuhan

183

strain and closest to SARS-CoV (Figure 1B).

184

With these genomic information, we aimed to identify target regions of 2019-nCoV by

185

searching for sequences that were i) within the Orf1ab, N or E genes of the viral genome; ii)

186

conserved among strains of the novel virus; iii) differentiable from other pathogenic

187

coronaviruses. By analyzing the genetic similarity among the 52 cases 2019-nCoV and other

188

pathogenic CoVs (Figure 1C), we identified two potential target sequences in Orf1ab and one

189

in the N gene (data not shown).

190
191

Development of CRISPR-nCoV

192

We seek to develop a rapid, highly sensitive and simple-to-use assay by taking advantage

193

of both the polymerase-mediated DNA amplification by RPA and the CRISPR/Cas-mediated

194

enzymatic signal amplification for improved sensitivity (Figure 2A). Moreover, the

195

isothermal nature of such an assay abolished the demand for sophiscated instruments such as

196

thermal cyclers as for PCR-based assays.

197

Based on the three potential target sequences we identified, multiple sets of RPA primers

198

and CRISPR gRNAs were designed and screened. Among these, the set that targeted Orf1ab

199

showed the best overall performance of sensitivity and specificity, and therefore, was used to

200

develop CRISPR-nCoV in this study for further evaluation (data not shown).

201

We then sought to determine its analytical sensitivity by serial dilution at various

202

concentrations. As shown in Figure 2B, CRISPR-nCoV consistently detected 7.5 copies of

203

2019-nCoV in all 10 replicates, 2.5 copies in 6 out of 10 , and 1.25 copies in 2 out of 10 runs.

204

These data indicate that CRISPR-nCoV had a near single-copy sensitivity. To confirm its

205

specificity, we tested CRISPR-nCoV with DNA from human cells as well as a panel of

206

microbes including i) bacteria commonly found in respiratory infections: S. pneumonia, H.

207

influenza, M. pneumonia, C. pneumonia, B. pertusiss; ii) human Coronaviruses: HCoV-OC43,

208

HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-229E; iii) other viruses commonly found in respiratory

209

infections: Adenovirus Type-3, H. Influenza B (Victoria), H influenza A (H3N2), HPIV-1,

210

RSV-A; and iii) other bacteria: S. mitis, S. pyogenes, S. aureus, E. coli, E. facecaiis. None of

211

the above interference samples triggered a false positive reaction (Figure 2C). Altogether,

212

these analytical assessments suggest CRISPR-nCoV as a promising molecular assay for

213

2019-nCoV detection with great sensitivity and specificity.

216

Upon completion of the analytical assessment, we further evaluated the diagnostic

217

potential of CRIPSR-nCoV in clinical specimens. A total of 114 RNA samples from clinical

218

respiratory samples were included in the evaluation, which consisted of 61 suspected nCoV

219

cases (among which 52 confirmed and 9 ruled-out by mNGS), 17 nCoV-/hCoV+ cases and

220

36 samples from healthy subjects (Figure 3A).

221

When conducting the CRISPR-nCoV assay, a positive control (PC) DNA and a

222

no-template control (NC) were included in parallel for each run. Florescent signal from NC

223

was used to normalize the signal and generate corresponding fold-change values (FC). We

224

noticed that there were clear distinction in signal patterns of the reactions. Specifically, the

225

fluorescent signal curve either remained flat as a negative curve (e.g. the NC runs) or had a

226

distinguishable positive signal curve (e.g. the PC runs). The negative curves yielded a

227

maximal FC value of 1.4, whereas the positive ones had a minimal FC value of 5.0. A cut-off

228

was set 3.0 which was set for a complete separation (Figure S1). Consistently, this cut-off

229

offered the optimal sensitivity and specificity as confirmed by an ROC analysis (data not

230

shown).

Diagnostic Performances Among Technological Platforms

237

We further set out to compare the diagnostic performances among mNGS, RT-PCR and

238

CRISPR. Using mNGS as the reference, PCR- and CRISPR-nCoV both had a specificity of

239

100% in our study. PCR-nCoV was able to detect the virus in 90.4% (47/52) of the positive

240

cases, with Ct’s ranging from 28.8 to 40.4 and a median Ct of 35.8. It worth noting that the 5

241

false negative samples by PCR-nCoV had a median mNGS read number of 550, which is

242

much lower than that of the other positive samples at 2,381 reads, suggesting a lower titer of

243

the virus in these samples. CRISPR showed a greater sensitivity by detecting all 52

244

nCoV-confirmed cases (100%), with FC values ranging from 5.0 to 66.3 and a median FC of

245

22.8 (Figure 4A).

246

When the reaction turn-around time (TAT) is compared, the CRISPR-nCoV reaction

247

requires only 40 minutes, which is the least among the three and includes 30 minutes of DNA

248

amplification and 10 minutes of Cas reaction. PCR-nCoV requires about 1.5 hours for a

249

completion run of the PCR program. mNGS takes approximately 20 hours, which includes 8

250

hours of library preparation, 10 hours of sequencing and 2 hours of bioinformatic analysis.

251

Because a positive result may be determined before completing the PCR program, we

252

calculated the effective TAT as the time when the florescent signal reached the threshold. As

253

showed in Figure 4B, CRISPR-nCoV presented a significant advantage in effective TAT over

254

PCR and mNGS.

255

Altogether, we demonstrated a CRISPR-based assay for 2019-nCoV that offered shorter

256

turn-around time and great diagnostic value, even in under-resourced settings without the

257

need of thermal cyclers. Our study also emphasized strength and weakness of different

methodologies which should be fully considered when applied in different diagnostic

259

settings.

261

DISCUSSION

262

Recent progresses in molecular diagnostic technologies, especially mNGS, allowed rapid,

263

initial identification of this novel pathogenic agent at the beginning of the current 2019-nCoV

264

epidemic.[8] Through acquiring the genome sequences of the novel virus, RT-PCR assays

265

were quickly developed for targeted 2019-nCoV detection.[14] However, the sudden

266

outbreak of 2019-nCoV created a dramatic burden not only on the society, but also on public

267

health.

268

The center of this epidemic, Wuhan city alone, hosts a population of over 10 millions.

269

The surging demand for rapid screening and identification of 2019-nCoV posts a great

270

challenge on the diagnostics.[20] mNGS is the method originally used for the identification

271

of this new viral species and considered as one of the most important references.[8] However,

272

its wider application is limited by its cost and longer TAT of nearly a day. An RT-PCR assay

273

for 2019-nCoV is faster and more affordable. Nevertheless, the need for a thermo cycler by

274

PCR-based diagnostics hinders its use in low-resource settings and curbs the assay

275

throughput. Besides their lower demand for sophisticated temperature controlling instruments,

276

isothermal molecular methods are advantageous owing to its faster nucleic acid amplification.

277

However, there have been debates over the specificity of such methods. The current

278

discovery of the collateral activity of certain Cas family members, provides a great

279

opportunity to take advantage of both the sensitivity of an isothermal assay and the specificity

280

of the CRISPR system.[21] As we demonstrated in this study, CRISPR-nCoV was able to

281

deliver comparable sensitivity and specificity as mNGS within as short as 40 minutes.

282

As a result of the rapid outbreak, the targeted assays (PCR and CRISPR) were designed

283

and developed based on limited genetic information on 2019-nCoV. Cautions should be taken

284

that certain unknown genomic variations may produce critical impact on the assay efficiency.

285

For example, a mutation or polymorphic site that abrupt the binding of the very 3’ end of a

286

PCR primer may cause a drastic reduction in sensitivity. Although not without its own

287

shortcomings on TAT and costs, NGS-based assays demonstrated a great level of sensitivity

288

and should still be used for continuous monitoring of genetic drifts in the viral genome. These

289

information will provide valuable insights not only from a public health standpoint, but also

290

to guide necessary optimization of targeted assay development.
