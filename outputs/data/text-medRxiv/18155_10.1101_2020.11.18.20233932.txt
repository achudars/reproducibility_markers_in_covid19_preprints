Abstract
Background
England is now in the midst of its second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Multiple regions
of the country are at high infection prevalence and all areas experienced rapid recent growth
of the epidemic during October 2020.
Methods
REACT-1 is a series of community surveys of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR swab-positivity in
England designed to monitor the spread of the epidemic and thus increase situational
awareness. Round 6 of REACT-1 commenced swab-collection on 16th October. A prior
interim report included data from 16th to 25th October for 85,971 participants. Here, we
report data for the entire round on 160,175 participants with swab results obtained up to 2nd
November 2020.
Results
Overall weighted prevalence of infection in the community in England was 1.3% or 130
people per 10,000 infected, up from 60 people per 10,000 in the round 5 report (18th
September to 5th October 2020), doubling every 24 days on average since the prior round.
The corresponding R number was estimated to be 1.2. Prevalence of infection was highest in
North West (2.4%, up from 1.2% ), followed by Yorkshire and The Humber (2.3% up from
0.84%), West Midlands (1.6% up from 0.60%), North East (1.5% up from 1.1%), East
Midlands (1.3% up from 0.56%), London (0.97%, up from 0.54%), South West (0.80% up
from 0.33%), South East (0.69% up from 0.29%), and East of England (0.69% up from
0.30%). Rapid growth in the South observed in the first half of round 6 was no longer
apparent in the second half of round 6. We also observed a decline in prevalence in
Yorkshire and The Humber during this period. Comparing the first and second halves of
round 6, there was a suggestion of decline in weighted prevalence in participants aged 5 to
12 years and in those aged 25 to 44 years. While prevalence remained high, in the second
half of round 6 there was suggestion of a slight fall then rise that was seen nationally and
also separately in both the North and the South.
Conclusion
The impact of the second national lockdown in England is not yet known. We provide here a
detailed description of swab-positivity patterns at national, regional and local scales for the
period immediately preceding lockdown, against which future trends in prevalence can be
evaluated.

Introduction
England is now in the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic ​[1]​. Since May 2020, we
have been carrying out near real-time surveillance of the epidemic in England through
successive rounds of the REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1)
study, based on RT-PCR of self-administered swabs ​[2–7]​. We recently reported a rapidly
rising prevalence of infections during the first half of round 6, with a doubling time of 9.0 (6.1,
18) days, for swabs collected between 16th and 25th October 2020 ​[7]​. Here, we report
results for the complete period of data collection in round 6. This includes swabs obtained up
until 2nd November 2020, three days before England entered a second national lockdown
[8]​.
Methods
We have described REACT-1 methods elsewhere ​[3]​. Briefly, we are using RT-PCR to
analyse self-administered nose and throat swabs (or parent/guardian administered for
children ages 5 to 12 years) obtained from random samples of the population of England
from the age of five years upwards. Swabs were maintained on a cold chain until analysed in
a single laboratory. The sample was designed to obtain approximately equal numbers of
people in each of the 315 lower-tier local authorities (LTLAs) in England, using the National
Health Service (NHS) list of GP registered patients to obtain the sample. We have aimed for
a sample size of between 120,000 and 160,000 people for each round of data collection, with
response rates varying between 22% and 31%.
Once participants provided their swab they were invited to complete a brief health and
lifestyle questionnaire. SARS-CoV-2 prevalence (with 95% confidence intervals) was
estimated nationally and regionally and by various socio-demographic characteristics, e.g.
age. Both unweighted and weighted estimates were obtained, the latter by adjusting for
region, deprivation and ethnicity, as well as differential response, so as to be representative
of the population in England. We analysed time-trends in swab positivity both between and
within rounds using exponential growth and decay models and we carried out multivariable
logistic regression to investigate associations of socio-demographic variables and symptoms
with swab positivity.
As well as quantifying regional trends, we have investigated SARS-CoV-2 prevalence at
sub-regional level, using a geospatial model. The goal of these analyses was to estimate the
England-wide geographical variation in the swab-positive prevalence ​P(x)​ where ​x​ is a lower
layer super output area (LSOA) population-weighted centroid. We model the log-odds of ​P(x)
as the sum of a region-level mean and an unobserved, zero-mean spatially correlated
stochastic process ​S(x)​ that captures local variation around each region-wide mean.

Conditional on ​P(x)​ the LSOA-level numbers of positive swab tests are independent and
binomially distributed. We estimate the model parameters by Monte Carlo maximum
likelihood, then draw samples from the joint predictive distribution of ​P(x)​ over all LSOAs, i.e.
the joint distribution conditional on the observed numbers of positive swab tests. We then
scale-up to LTLA-level by converting the LSOA-level samples to LTLA-level
population-weighted averages. All computations used the PrevMap package ​[9]​ within the R
computing environment ​[10]​.
We obtained research ethics approval from the South Central-Berkshire B Research Ethics
Committee (IRAS ID: 283787).
Results
We found 1,732 positives from 160,175 swabs giving an unweighted prevalence of 1.08%
(95% CI, 1.03%, 1.13%) and a weighted prevalence of 1.30% (1.21%, 1.39%) (Table 1). The
weighted prevalence estimate was more than double that of 0.60% (0.55%, 0.71%) obtained
in the prior round 5 of the study ​[4]​.
The increase in prevalence between this study and the prior round 5 represents a national
doubling time of 24 (22, 27) days with a corresponding R estimate of 1.19 (1.17,1.21) (Figure
1, Table 2). This R estimate from sequential rounds is similar to that reported for the prior
round 5 alone of 1.16 (1.05, 1.27). We do not report an R estimate for the current round 6
overall because, using maximum likelihood logistic regression, we found strong evidence in
favour of a non-linear prevalence function during this period (ΔAIC > 50, Table 3).
Following the rapid growth reported during the first half of round 6 ​[7]​, here we describe little
evidence of growth during the second half. Weighted prevalence for the earlier part of round
6 ​[7]​ was 1.28% (1.16%, 1.42%) compared with 1.32% (1.20%, 1.45%) for the most recent
data with estimates of R of 1.56 (1.27, 1.89) and 0.85 (0.73, 0.99) for each half of round 6
respectively. We investigated the possibility of systematic differences in the participant
characteristics between the two halves of round 6 in comparison with the first and second
halves of rounds 4 and 5 . While we did find differences in characteristics within rounds,
patterns were similar across rounds 4, 5 and 6 (not shown).
There appears to be additional temporal structure in the most recent round 6 data not
captured by the average trend described above. A p-spline ​[11]​ model suggests a fall and
then rise in prevalence during this most recent period, with the lowest point around October
30th (Figure 2). A similar pattern was seen when fitting separate curves to data for the North
(including Midlands) and the South (Figure 3). Similar patterns were also seen when holding
out each region in turn and refitting the p-spline (Figure 4).

At regional level, based on analysis of rounds 5 and 6 together, R was increasing (Figure 5,
Table 4, Table 5a). However, consistent with the national trend, the rapid growth in the South
during the first half of round 6 was no longer apparent in the more recent data (Table 4,
Figure 6). While the highest prevalence in the first half of round 6 was in Yorkshire and The
Humber, since then, there has been a decline in prevalence in that region (Figure 6).
However, the fall in Yorkshire and The Humber in the most recent period does not explain
the national pattern (Figure 4).
Differences in local prevalence between rounds 5 and 6, and between the first and second
halves of round 6 (averaged at the level of lower tier local authority, LTLA) reveal
sub-regional patterns of growth and decline (Figure 7, Figure 8). For example, decline is
suggested in a block of LTLAs in the south of Yorkshire and The Humber and the north of
East Midlands, while growth is suggested in contiguous blocks of LTLAs across parts of the
North West region.
In the most recent round 6 data, there is suggestion of decline in weighted prevalence of
swab positivity in participants aged 5 to 12 years and to a lesser extent in those aged 25 to
44 years (Table 5b, Figure 9). Again in the most recent data, only age and region were
robustly associated with increased odds of testing positive among the covariates, with higher
odds of swab positivity in 13-17 and 18-24 year olds and in the North and Midlands
compared with the reference groups (Figure 10, Table 6). The estimated odds ratios
associated with Black and Asian ethnicity and large household size (six or more individuals
per household) were closer to unity in round 6 compared with 5.
Discussion
During this sixth round of data collection in the REACT-1 study of SARS-CoV-2 virus
prevalence in England, we reported high and rapidly increasing prevalence during the first
half of the round (16th to 25th October 2020), with highest prevalence in the North of the
country ​[7]​. Here we extend these findings to swabs obtained up to 2nd November, three
days before a second national lockdown in England. The data presented here therefore give
an assessment of community prevalence prior to the second lockdown in England against
which to assess the progression of the epidemic during the lockdown period starting 5th
November.
In contrast with our findings for mid- to late-October, we found evidence for a slowdown in
the epidemic during the final days of October and beginning of November 2020, with
suggestion of a fall and then rise in prevalence during that period. This slowdown was seen
across the country, both North and South, and was not being driven by any one region. The

largest falls in prevalence were seen during late October to beginning November in Yorkshire
and The Humber, which had previously had the highest prevalence in the country. We also
saw reductions in prevalence at the sub-regional level in that region. Falls in prevalence
during this period were also observed at the youngest ages in our study (5 to 12 years).
During this period there was evidence of a downturn in daily infections from the national
surveillance data on symptomatic cases (“Pillar 1 and 2”) ​[1]​ and from the coronavirus
symptom app (Zoe app) ​[12]​, and a plateau in data from the Office for National Statistics
Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey ​[13]​. Despite differences between these data
streams in their recruitment strategy including whether this is influenced by symptom status
[1, 12], all four are broadly consistent in identifying an inflection point towards the end of our
study period.
The period leading up to the second national lockdown was fluid, with a number of local
initiatives being brought in to curb the virus in the highest prevalence areas, mainly in the
North of England and the Midlands. At the same time, there was considerable uncertainty
and speculation about a possible national lockdown or whether a “circuit-breaker” might be
brought in during half-term week which was also at the end of October for most English local
authorities. This reflected concerns that the NHS might not cope with increasing hospital
admissions that were already being seen in parts of the country. In addition, October 2020
was one of the wettest Octobers on record in England during which the number of sunshine
hours was well below average ​[14]​ which may have contributed to changes in behaviour and
hence transmission. Overall though, it is difficult to ascribe the patterns of prevalence in the
latter part of round 6 to any single cause.
Our national prevalence estimate of 1.3% translates to around 1 million infections in England
on any one day, assuming sensitivity to detect the virus from a nose and throat swab of
around 75% ​[15]​. If we assume that shedding of the virus is detectable for 10 days on
average, this would translate to around 100,000 new infections per day at the end of October
with a range from 90,000 to 104,000 (reflecting the 95% confidence intervals in weighted
national prevalence).
Our study has a number of limitations. In order to estimate trends over time, we assume that
the individuals taking part are broadly representative of the base population by LTLA at each
time point in the study. We did find evidence for limited differences in population
characteristics between the first and second halves of rounds four to six, but not of sufficient
size or direction to have materially affected within- or between-round trends. Also it is
possible that issues with swab sample transport or changes in laboratory procedures or
reagents may have affected either the integrity of the samples or the detection thresholds on

RT-PCR. However, data are collected and analysed according to strict protocols and quality
control (QC) procedures, and review of both the delivery chain and laboratory QC did not
reveal any differences or discrepancies that might have materially affected positivity rates.
Underlying the national trends, we have described a complex spatial pattern of growth and
decline of the epidemic at sub-regional scales in the most recent data. Increased restrictions
in west Yorkshire prior to the start of the national lockdown ​[8]​ appear to have been
successful. In the North West, while there were signs of slowing of the epidemic in the worst
affected areas, we did not see substantial groupings of LTLAs with lower prevalence in the
second half of round 6 compared with the first. These differences suggest variation in the
efficacy of the tiered local interventions which may reflect differences in timing,
implementation or population acceptability and adherence to the restrictions.
The impact of the second national lockdown in England is not yet known. We provide here a
detailed description of swab-positivity patterns at national, regional and local scales for the
period immediately preceding lockdown, against which future trends in prevalence can be
evaluated.

Figure 1.​ Constant growth rate models fit to REACT-1 data for sequential and individual
rounds. Points show unweighted prevalence estimate and vertical lines show 95% binomial
confidence intervals (CIs). Because there were few swabs taken on some days, some upper
bounds to CIs are truncated. Models fit to REACT-1 data for sequential rounds; 1 and 2
(yellow), 2 and 3 (blue), 3 and 4 (green), 4 and 5 (pink), and 5 and 6 (purple).Shaded areas
show 95% credible intervals. Note that of the 932,171 swab tests only 918,543 had a date
and so were included in the temporal analysis (3,008 of 3,029 positives).

regression model of swab-positivity for rounds 5, 6, 6a (16 to 25 October 2020), and 6b (26
October to 2 November 2020). Models were jointly adjusted for gender, age group, region,
key worker status, ethnicity, household size, and deprivation index. The deprivation index is
based on the Index of Multiple Deprivation (2019) at lower super output area. Here we group
scores into quintiles, where 1 = most deprived and 5 = least deprived. HCW/CHW = health
care or care home workers; Not FT, PT, SE = Not full-time, part-time, or self-employed.
