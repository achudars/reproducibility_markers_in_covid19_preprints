ABSTRACT
Background: COVID-19 rapidly escalated into a pandemic, threatening 213 countries, areas, and
30

territories the world over. We aimed to identify potential province-level socioeconomic
determinants of the virus’s dissemination, and explain between-province differences in the speed of
its spread, based on data from 36 provinces of Northern Italy.

33

Methods: This is an ecological study. We included all confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 reported
between February 24th and March 30th, 2020. For each province, we calculated the trend of
contagion as the relative increase in the number of individuals infected between two time endpoints,

36

assuming an exponential growth. Pearson’s test was used to correlate the trend of contagion with a
set of healthcare-associated, economic, and demographic parameters by province. The virus’s
spread was input as a dependent variable in a stepwise OLS regression model to test the association

39

between rate of spread and province-level indicators.
Findings: Multivariate analysis showed that the spread of COVID-19 was correlated negatively
with aging index (p-value=0.003), and positively with public transportation per capita (p-

42

value=0.012), the % of private long-term care hospital beds and, to a lesser extent (p-value=0.070),
the % of private acute care hospital beds (p-value=0.006).
Interpretation: Demographic and socioeconomic factors, and healthcare organization variables

45

were found associated with a significant difference in the rate of COVID-19 spread in 36 provinces
of Northern Italy. An aging population seemed to naturally contain social contacts. The availability
of healthcare resources and their coordination could play an important part in spreading infection.

BACKGROUND
The disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus (COVID-19) first detected in Wuhan, China, in
December 20191 escalated rapidly into a pandemic,2 coming to threaten 213 countries, areas, and

51

territories across the globe.3
Italy recorded its first imported cases in January 2020,4 and local cases emerged towards the end of
February in Northern Italy, in the Lombardia and Veneto regions.4,5 Restrictions on international

54

travel, domestic mobility, mass gatherings, and sporting events were gradually enacted by the
Italian Government in an effort to contain the contagion,4 until the country’s complete lockdown on
March 9th, 2020.6 Once implemented, these mitigation strategies (which sounded draconian to the

57

population) proved effective in limiting the diffusion of COVID-19 to other parts of the country, but
the infection continued to spread with different trends in Northern Italy.
Many demographic and socioeconomic factors, and healthcare organization variables can be

60

associated with the variability of contagious disease propagation rates. It is important for public
health systems to identify these factors and variables to produce solid evidence that can drive
mitigation strategies. As well as having a direct influence on health outcomes in a given area, the

63

findings of public health research also have important implications for ongoing global efforts to
contain COVID-19. For example, a recent study found that even a small increase in long-term
exposure to PM2.5 leads to a large increase in the virus-related death rate, with the magnitude of

66

increase 20 times that observed for PM2.5 and all cause mortality.7
Besides environmental conditions, factors such as employment rates, population density, and
healthcare resources may help to account for the observed differences in rapidity of COVID-19

69

propagation.
With this ecological study we aimed to identify potential province-level demographic,
socioeconomic, and healthcare determinants of the COVID-19 pandemic’s dissemination, and to

METHODS
75

Context

The Italian National Health Service (NHS) was set up in 1978 with universal coverage, solidarity,
human dignity, and human health as its guiding principles. It is regionally based, and organized at
78

national, regional, and local levels. Under the Italian Constitution, central government controls the
distribution of tax revenue for publicly-financed healthcare and decides on a national statutory benefits package of “essential levels of care” - offered to all residents in every region. The country’s 19

81

regions and two autonomous provinces are responsible for organizing and delivering healthcare services through local health units. Depending on the region, public funds are allocated by local health
units to public hospitals and accredited private clinics. In 2017, there were approximately 213,700

84

hospital beds, including day hospital and day surgery beds: 170,000 in public hospitals (2.8 beds per
1,000 population, including 2.5/1,000 for acute care and 0.3/1,000 for long-stay patients), and
43,700 in accredited private clinics (0.7 beds per 1,000 population, including 0.4/1,000 for acute

87

care and 0.3/1,000 for long-stay patients).8 Public hospitals are either managed directly by local
health units and coordinated with other local health services such as preventive medicine departments and primary care districts, or they operate as semi-independent public enterprises. A prospec-

90

tive payment system based on diagnosis-related groups (DRG) operates across the country and accounts for most hospital revenue, but is generally not applied to hospitals run directly by local
health units, where global budgets are common.

93
Study design and data sources

In the present ecological study we included all confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 reported between
96

February 24th and March 30th, 2020, drawn from the Italian Civil Protection Department’s official
data.9 This agency operates certified surveillance systems for the Italian government, with a two6

stage testing procedure for SARS-CoV-2, one at local health unit level, and one at national labora99

tory level for confirmation purposes. All reported cases of COVID-19 infection met the laboratory
criteria for confirmation established in the EU case definition procedure, which includes using RTPCR.

102

We collected data on 36 provinces in four regions of Northern Italy – Piemonte, Lombardia, Veneto,
and Emilia-Romagna – which have had the highest numbers of infections during the COVID-19
pandemic. For each province, we calculated the trend of contagion as the relative increase in the

105

number of people infected between two time endpoints: T0 , the day when the province first reached
10 cases, or as at February 2nd, 2020 (when the first data on the cases reported became available,
whichever came first); and T20 (20 days after T0). Demographics were extracted from the most

108

recently updated databases on the website of the Italian Institute of Statistics (ISTAT),10 and the
ISTAT’s Health for All database.11 The number of sporting associations for each province was
obtained from the registry of the Italian National Olympic Committee (CONI).12

111

Data analysis
We modeled the disease’s spread assuming an exponential growth with the number of infections
multiplying by a certain factor each day. Assuming no recoveries during the three-week period

114

considered, the total number of people infected at the time t, y_t can be written as:
y_t=y_1 (β+1)^(t-1)
where y_1 is the number of cases on day 1 and β is the transmission factor.

117

Since we know the number of cases on day 1 and day 20, we can compute β_i, the transmission
factor, for the i-th province as:

β_i=(y_t⁄y_1 )^(1/(t-1) )-1
120

A descriptive analysis was conducted, calculating minimum, maximum, and mean values, to
illustrate the spread of the disease. Pearson’s test was applied to correlate β_i with a set of
healthcare-associated, economic, and demographic parameters at province level (see Table 1).

123

β_i was input as a dependent variable in an OLS regression model to study the association between
the rate of spread of COVID-19 and the variables that correlated with the dependent variable on a
bivariate level with a p-value of less than 0.20. A stepwise selection procedure was used. A residuals

126

analysis was performed to check the assumptions of the model. This analysis included testing for
the residuals’ normal distribution (Shapiro-Wilk normality test) and independence (Durbin-Watson
test).

129

A sensitivity analysis was conducted, considering different dependent variables as rates (t1/t0) or
incremental rates ([t1-t0]/t0), which produced the same results (data not shown). All data obtained
were encoded in a master sheet using a Microsoft Office Excel spreadsheet (Version 2016,

132

Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA). Data analysis was done with Stata 14 statistical software
(Stata Corp LP, College Station, TX) and R Studio Integrated Development for R (RStudio, Inc.,
Boston, MA).

RESULTS
138

Table 2 shows that the increase in the numbers of cases in 20 days varied considerably among the
various provinces from a minimum of 115 cases in the province of Rovigo to a maximum of 3398
cases in Bergamo, with an average growth of 852 cases per province in 20 days. The rate of this

141

increase was lowest in the province of Asti (4.5%) and highest in Brescia (330%), with an average
over all provinces of 59.9%.
The scatter plot (Figure 1) shows significant correlations between the increase in transmission and

144

several demographic, socioeconomic, and healthcare variables. A significant negative correlation
emerged between increment β and population aging rates, while a significant positive correlation
was found with employment rates, public transportation rates, in-house density, population density,

147

and the proportions of private acute and long-term care beds in clinics and nursing homes.
Table 3 shows the bivariate and multivariate analyses, demonstrating that the spread of COVID-19
in the regional setting considered was negatively associated (p-value=0.003) with the population

150

aging index, i.e. the ratio of the number of people aged 65 or more to the number of people aged 014 years multiplied by 100. It was positively associated with: public transportation per capita, i.e.
the ratio of the yearly number of public transport passengers to the total population (p-

153

value=0.012). It was also positively associated, albeit to a lesser extent (p-value=0.070), with the %
of private long-term care hospital beds, and more strongly with the % of private acute care hospital
beds (p-value=0.006).

156

The Shapiro-Wilk test showed that the residuals had a normal distribution (p-value=0.870) and the
Rubin-Watson test showed that the residuals were independent (p-value=0.48). The high value of
the adjusted R squared indicates that the model had a good fit.

DISCUSSION
With this ecological study, we found correlations between higher SARS-CoV-2 contagion rates and
certain demographic, socioeconomic, and healthcare factors in the Italian provinces considered.

162

Unlike the first cases imported from outbreak regions, the local spread of communicable respiratory
diseases seems to favor certain patterns and conditions, especially relating to social contact
patterns.13

165

We found a negative association between COVID-19 contagion rates and aging. This seems
somewhat at odds with the currently-known epidemiology of the virus, that in Italy is more likely to
infect and kill older people. The median age of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 nationwide is 62

168

years old, and the median age of the related deaths is 80 years old.14 On the other hand, provinces
with a higher aging index had a more gentle contagion curve. A possible explanation is that older
people tend to move less outside their home and travel less far from where they live.15 They are also

171

less likely to take part in mass gatherings or social events, whereas younger people tend to spend
more time with others outside their family.16 Taken together, these behavioral factors could
predispose the elderly to social distancing and self-isolation, naturally containing the propagation of

174

communicable diseases in the provinces with the oldest populations.
In our analysis, higher levels of employment, public transportation usage, in-house density, and
population density correlated positively with the spread of infection. What these socioeconomic

177

factors have in common is the mobility of individuals and their exposure to close social contacts,
both of which facilitate the propagation of SARS-CoV-2. This is consistent with recent analyses that
associated a higher risk of COVID-19 transmission in mainland China with the use of trains,17

180

buses, and flights from Wuhan, and the risk was higher the longer a journey lasted.18 In-house
density has also already been identified as a factor predisposing to higher transmission rates of
pandemic influenza in Great Britain.19

183

A greater spread of the virus was seen in provinces with larger proportions of private acute care
beds in clinics, and long-term care beds in nursing homes. These data should not be interpreted as a
lack of involvement of the private sector in providing hospital care for COVID-19 patients. These

186

facilities are an important part of the services provided by the Italian health system and they
responded promptly to the emergency situation. They have ordinary and intensive care beds for
COVID-19 patients just like public hospitals. The explanation should be sought by looking at the

189

issue more in depth and speculating on the outcome variable analyzed in the present study, i.e. the
rate of spread of the infection. Hospitals, clinics, and care homes are only responsible for containing
it within their walls, while the preventive medicine departments of local health units are in charge

192

of wider containment efforts, based on epidemiological intelligence.20 It may be that provinces with
higher proportions of private healthcare facilities experienced more communication difficulties with
the reporting of cases to preventive medicine departments to gather epidemic intelligence because

195

private facilities are usually less integrated with preventive medicine and community healthcare
services than public hospitals. This could hamper the early identification of patients through the sort
of epidemic intelligence activities strongly recommended by the WHO in the case of COVID-19.21

198

Another explanation could relate to how private clinics are funded, i.e. based on DRG-based tariffs
for each patient admitted. Owing to incentives linked to this particular funding mechanism,
provinces with a relatively high concentration of private hospital beds might have paid less attention

201

to avoiding the hospitalization of patients with COVID-19 symptoms who could have been
successfully treated at home with the involvement of community and primary care services. In fact,
primary healthcare services have a crucial role in ensuring that people caring for a family member

204

suffering from COVID-19 manage their contact with the patient appropriately, and follow national
or local policies regarding home quarantine. Caregivers should wear medical masks or the best
available protection against respiratory droplets when in close contact with the patient, and observe

207

hand hygiene recommendations. The WHO emphasized the importance of notifying healthcare

providers of the diagnosis in order to receive instructions on where to seek care, when and where to
enter healthcare facilities, and what precautions to take to prevent and control the infection.21 Our
210

findings would suggest the importance of improving communications between private clinics and
the Italian NHS responsible for their accreditation (i.e. the issue of the public license to provide
hospital care on the NHS’s behalf) to ensure a real consistency of their activities with regional

213

health plans (including their integration with the preventive medicine and primary care services of
local health units), and an effective assessment of their activities and results.
This study has at least two important limitations. First, we collected data from available health

216

indicators, which do not measure all the phenomena relevant to understanding and explaining the
findings, even though our models performed well in explaining their variability (MR2 = ~60%).
Second, the real number of SARS-CoV-2 contagions is known to be underestimated because not all

219

individuals in the population considered were screened, and swabs were handled differently by the
various regional healthcare systems. Even with such well-known limitations,22 ecological studies
can still help healthcare workers and stakeholders to contain infections and fight pandemics,

222

especially in the early stages of emerging diseases when clinical data are still limited.23

Conclusions
225

Several demographic, socioeconomic, and healthcare factors were found associated with significant
differences in the rate of COVID-19 spread in 36 provinces of Northern Italy. An older population
seemed to naturally slow the contagion due to fewer social contacts. Socioeconomic factors

228

(especially the rates of employment and public transportation usage) and organizational features of
local healthcare systems (particularly the proportion of private healthcare facilities) also seemed to
play an important part in the infection’s spread. These correlations could be helpful for the purpose

231

of designing measures to reduce the propagation of COVID-19 in other countries now dealing with
the first phase of this pandemic.
