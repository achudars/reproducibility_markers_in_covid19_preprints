Abstract
Background
Exhaled respirable aerosols (<5 µm diameter) present a high risk of severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission. Many guidelines recommend using
aerosol precautions during ‘aerosol generating procedures’ (AGPs) and droplet (>5 µm)
precautions at other times. However, there is emerging evidence that respiratory activities
such as cough and not AGPs are the important source of aerosols.
Methods
We used a novel chamber with an optical particle counter sampling at 100 L/min to count
and size-fractionate all exhaled particles (0.5-25 µm). We compared emissions from ten
healthy subjects during respiratory ‘activities’ (quiet breathing, talking, shouting, forced
expiratory maneuvers, exercise and coughing) with respiratory ‘therapies’ designated as
AGPs: high flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) and single or dual circuit non-invasive positive
pressure ventilation, NIPPV-S and NIPPV-D, respectively. Activities were repeated wearing
facemasks.
Results
Compared to quiet breathing, respiratory activities increased particle counts between 34.6fold (95% confidence interval [CI], 15.2 to 79.1) during talking, to 370.8-fold (95% CI, 162.3
to 847.1) during coughing (p<0.001). During quiet breathing, HFNO at 60 L/min increased
counts 2.3-fold (95% CI, 1.2 to 4.4) (p=0.03) and NIPPV-S and NIPPV-D at 25/10 cm H2O
increased counts by 2.6-fold (95% CI, 1.7 to 4.1) and 7.8-fold (95% CI, 4.4 to 13.6)
respectively (p<0.001). During activities, respiratory therapies and facemasks reduced
emissions compared to activities alone.
Conclusion
Talking, exertional breathing and coughing generate substantially more aerosols than the
respiratory therapies HFNO and NIPPV which can reduce total emissions. The risk of aerosol
exposure is underappreciated and warrants widespread targeted interventions.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and consequent
coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is a significant cause of mortality and morbidity amongst
patients, healthcare workers and the general population.1,2 Many international COVID-19
guidelines state that SARS-CoV-2 transmission is primarily through larger respiratory fluid
‘droplets’ (>5 µm diameter), while aerosols (<5 µm) are only a significant risk during ‘aerosol
generating procedures’ (AGPs).3,4 Therefore, standard protection against COVID-19 is based
on preventing droplet transmission, which includes surgical facemasks, whereas, fit-tested
N95-rated respirators and enhanced environmental ventilation are recommended during
AGPs.3,4 Aerosols are of concern as they can contain replication-competent virus, travel on
airflows, better evade surgical masks and deposit on the alveolar epithelium, potentially
increasing disease severity.5–9 Concerningly, a higher prevalence of infection has been
observed in healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients using droplet compared with
aerosol measures.10–12
The special status accorded to AGPs is based on weak epidemiological evidence from the
SARS-CoV-1 epidemic where increased disease transmission occurred in healthcare workers
exposed to patients requiring acute respiratory therapies.13 Aerosols were not measured in
these studies.13 The respiratory therapies high flow nasal canula therapy (HFNO) and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) are universally designated AGPs.14 However,
these therapies may supress aerosol emissions by altering pulmonary mechanics or filtering
exhaled gases.15 Earlier studies quantifying aerosols during therapies suggest both increased
and decreased emissions.16–18 A recent study and pre-publication suggest coughing may
generate up to 3-10 times more aerosols than HFNO and NIPPV.19,20 However, the methods
used in these studies may have underestimated total emissions and exposure risk.19,20
Misclassification of HFNO and NIPPV as AGPs may have two serious adverse consequences.
First, that the risk from common respiratory activities is underestimated so effective
precautions are not widely used and second, patients may have delayed or restricted access
to beneficial therapies.3,14,21
Based on the established mechanisms of physiological aerosol generation we hypothesised

total emissions will be increased by exertional respiratory activity and decreased by clinically
indicated therapies.9,15 To provide better quantification of risk, we developed a novel
chamber to measure total human aerosol emissions during six respiratory activities, and
compared them to emissions using HFNO, NIPPV and the wearing of surgical facemasks.

Methods
We recruited healthy, non-smoking, healthcare workers, using a screening questionnaire
and physiological measurements. The protocol was approved by the South Eastern Sydney
Ethics Committee (ETH01467/2020) and written consent obtained.
The chamber was designed using clean airflow concepts from Morawska’s expiratory
droplet investigation system (EDIS) and a large sampling cone from Milton’s Gesundheitt-II
(Figure 1).22,23 The cone was connected to an optical particle counter (OPC) sampling at
100L/min (Aerotrak 9500, TSI Instruments, Minnesota, USA). The OPC counts particles into
six size categories (‘bins’), (0.5-0.7, 0.7-1, 1-3, 3-5, 5-10, 10-25 µm).

Figure 1 - The sampling chamber consisted of a rear section, containing filters, which
supplied clean air through a wall composed of air-filter media and a clear-walled forward
section accommodated the torso of the subject. A flexible non-porous skirt enabled entry of
the subject and the tubing of non-invasive devices. The subject’s head was positioned
within a cut-away section of a large cone, which was attached to an optical particle counter,
sampling at 100 L/min and mounted outside the chamber. Airflow in the 100 mm diameter
tube at the distal end in the chamber was monitored via the anemometer probe. Humidity

and temperature were monitored using a hygrometer and thermometer positioned in front
of the subject, on the chamber floor. A moveable pedal exerciser was mounted so the
subject could exercise in their seated position. A detailed description is provided in the
Supplementary material.

Subjects wore hooded polypropylene coveralls and were positioned with their heads within
the cone. During quiet breathing the chamber was purged, whereby counts fell from
ambient (~50,000 -70,000 / 100 L) to <120 total counts/100 L, (0.0012 particles/cc) and
were stable (change <2 counts/second). Each sample required a one-minute prior purge,
followed by one-minute of activity and sampling, and ended with a sustained purge.
Exercise was an exception, where pedalling began one minute before sampling. The entire
protocol lasted approximately four hours per subject. Six subjects performed the protocol in
the order described and four in the reverse order.
Ten subjects performed six respiratory activities with and without surgical facemasks and
then repeated selected activities while receiving three respiratory therapies designated as
AGPs detailed in the study design (Supplementary Table S1). The six respiratory activities
were chosen because they represent common aerosol generating activities or were proxies
for respiratory symptoms associated with acute infections, such as increased work of
breathing and atelectasis. The combinations of activities and therapies were based on
practical feasibility and clinical relevance. The activities were:
•

Quiet breathing through either the nose or mouth.

•

Talking; repeating the alphabet while talking loudly.

•

Shouting; repeating a short sentence as loud as could be sustained for this time.

•

Six forced expiratory volume (FEV) manoeuvres – a full inspiration, and then full
exhalation to residual volume. Prompted at 7-8-second intervals, finishing at 45
seconds.

•

Six volitional coughs - moderate intensity, with timings as for FEVs.

•

Exercise with a pedal exerciser (PhysioRoom, Padiham, United Kingdom) set to midload (to achieve ~70% of maximal estimated heart rate).

The six activities were repeated wearing a surgical mask with ties – (Med-Con, item 170515,
Shepparton, Australia).
The three respiratory therapies were as follows:
•

A C6 ventilator (Hamilton, Bonaduz, Switzerland) delivered humidified 33C HFNO at an
FiO2 of 0.25, via a Optiflow plus circuit and MR850 humidifier (Fisher and Paykel,
Auckland, Aotearoa) Flows were delivered at 20, 40 and 60L/minute during quiet
breathing, and at 60 L/minute during talking, FEV, coughing and exercise.

•

A V60 ventilator (Phillips, Eindhoven, Holland) delivered humidified 33C NIPPV at an
FiO2 of 0.25 via a Nivairo facemask (RT045, Fisher and Paykel), using an open single limb
circuit with open expiratory port positioned inside the sampling cone. Pressures
delivered were Inspiratory peak/expiratory peak airway pressures (IPAP/EPAP cm H20)
of 5/5, 10/10, 15/10, 20/10 and 25/10 and during exercise at 20/10 cm H20.

•

A Hamilton-C6 ventilator was used to deliver NIPPV-D using the same pressure ranges,
facemask and using a dual limb circuit with a high-efficiency air particulate (HEPA) filter
on the expiratory limb.

Analysis
Sample size was based on pilot data obtained during the protocol development and prior
studies.24 As particle counts were positively skewed and included some zero values, the
counts were log transformed with a zero offset, as follows: log-count=log10 (count+0.3). To
compare differences in particle counts between activities and respiratory therapies, a mixed
effects linear regression model was used to take account of repeated measures across
particle bin sizes and within participants (in Proc Mixed, SAS version 9.4). In all models the
dependent variable was log-count. The main fixed effect was activity or therapy (or both).
Reference values were quiet breathing (for activity) and no therapy. To assess the impact of
wearing a facemask the models were repeated with the main fixed effect terms of activity,
with and without a facemask. Results are reported as fold differences (95% confidence
intervals) between the geometric means of activities and/or therapy. Particle counts in the
six size bins were transformed to estimated particle volumes using the formula, volume =
4/3**radius3 (Table S2). Further details of the data analysis are provided in the appendix.

Post Hoc Experiments
Subjects’ perception of air passing backwards during certain activities, prompted an
observational study of the behaviour of visible expired plumes using e-cigarette aerosols
and a replica transparent cone and two subjects. An unexpected difference in aerosol
emissions between NIPPV-S and NIPPV-D prompted a detailed comparison of ventilator
performance in two subjects. Both experiments are detailed in the supplementary methods.

Results
Subject
Four females and six males, mean age 29 years (SD=2.8), were recruited. Detailed subject
and environmental data are in the appendix (Table S3, S4). We sampled 31,000 litres of air
to make 1860 measurements (186/subject) of particle size and number.

activities and when breathing quietly while three respiratory therapies, designated as
‘aerosol generating procedures’ (AGPs), were applied. The therapies are as follows: High
flow nasal canula therapy (HFNO) and single or dual circuit non-invasive positive pressure
ventilation, NIPPV-S and NIPPV-D, respectively. All respiratory therapies shown were
recorded at the highest settings used: HFNO at a flow of 60 L/min and both NIPPV-S and
NIPPV-D at inspiratory/expiratory airway pressures of 25/10 cm H2O. The size range in the
six particle bins as measured by the optical particle counter are shown in the key. A value of
0.3 was added to all counts, so zero particle counts are shown as 0.3. Overlapping dot points
are not shown. FEV – force expiratory volume maneuver. Both FEV and cough were
repeated six times in the sampling minute.

Respiratory activities
When compared to quiet breathing, each of the respiratory activities was associated with a
large increase in emissions (Figure 2, Table 1, Table S6). This increase ranged from 34.6-fold
during talking up to 370.8-fold during six coughs (all p<0.001). The fold increases, also
presented as average total number of particles per activity and as estimated total volumes
(Table S6).

Abbreviations: HFNO, high flow nasal canula therapy with flow in L/min; NIPPV-S and NIPPVD, non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (single and dual circuits, respectively) with
inspiratory/expiratory airway pressures shown in cm H2O.

Respiratory therapies
The three respiratory therapies showed slight increases in total particle counts at higher
flows and pressures (Table 1, S6, Figure 2) relative to the breathing benchmark. During
HFNO the only significant increase occurred at a flow of 60 L/min where counts
approximately doubled (p=0.03). During NIPPV-S, counts increased 2-3-fold, reaching
significance at 15/10 cm H2O (p<0.001). With NIPPV-D, counts increased 2-8-fold and were
significant at all pressures (all p≤0.03).
Particle counts reduced when HFNO was used during respiratory activities, significantly
during coughing, where emissions were halved (p=0.03). During exercise, the three
respiratory therapies reduced particle counts by 30-60%, though only significantly during
NIPPV-S (p=0.02) (Table 1).

Surgical facemasks
The effect of surgical facemasks varied with activity, generally decreasing total emissions
with apparent larger reductions observed in activities with higher particle counts. Forced
expiration and cough demonstrated approximately 3- and 5-fold reductions, p=0.02 and
p=0.01 respectively (Table 1). The 1.2-fold increase in emissions wearing a mask during quiet
breathing was not significant (p=0.62).

Distribution of aerosols between activities and procedures
The overwhelming majority (>92%) of particles produced across all activities and procedures
were respirable aerosols (≤5 µm) (Table S6). The proportion of the total volume of particles
that was aerosols, ranged between 5.9% and 34.9% for all respiratory activities alone, with
coughing producing the greatest proportion, and between 7.1 and 22.4% during HFNO and
NIPPV with quiet breathing.

Inter-subject variation
The intraclass correlation of subjects for all activities with and without devices was 0.065
and 0.068, respectively, indicating substantial variation between subjects in the total
number of exhaled particles and the effect of activities and respiratory therapies. Although
breathing was consistently a minor contributor to the total volume of particles, the ranking
of other activities varied between subjects. The removal of the highest contributor had
negligible effect on the relative magnitude of changes in particle emissions between
activities and therapies (Figure S2, Table S8).

Post Hoc Experiments
The qualitative visualisation of exhaled e-cigarette aerosols suggests minor incomplete
sampling may have occurred with all activities, and substantial under-sampling during
coughing, FEV and wearing of surgical masks (Video S1). The assessment of ventilator
performance demonstrated NIPPV-D was associated with 30% more asynchronous
respiratory cycles compared to NIPPV-S (Table S7).

Discussion
This study is the first to explore (close to) complete exhaled respiratory emissions and the
most detailed in comparing emissions (counts, size distributions and estimated volumes)
across a broad range of respiratory activities with three non-invasive respiratory therapies.
We demonstrate that the total emissions per minute during common respiratory activities
are often one to two orders of magnitude greater than during HFNO and NIPPV which are
currently classified as AGPs. Importantly, when these therapies were used during
respiratory activities, emissions were reduced compared to the activities alone.
Our study advances and compliments two recent important studies which also compared
respiratory activities and therapies.19,20 Gaeckle found NIPPV and HFNO did not generate
significantly more aerosols compared to other respiratory activities, while coughing
increased emissions 3-fold.19 Hamilton reports coughing produces a ten-fold rise in
emissions, NIPPV-S was associated with fewer emissions than three respiratory activities,
and HFNO did not increase respiratory-generated aerosols.20 While comparisons were
complicated by their different measures of peak and average counts, they too concluded
cough was the most likely source of hazardous aerosols irrespective of therapies.20
These and other recent studies to quantify respiratory aerosols have collected particles at a
short distance from the subject, using a small sampling inlet in free space with very low air
sampling rates, typically of 1-5L/min.19,20,25–27 Accurately sampling exhaled aerosols is made
challenging by airflows in excess of 600L/min, nebulous plumes travelling up to 60m/s and
the addition of high volumes of ventilator gases.28,29 To avoid incomplete sampling by an
unknown degree, we positioned the subjects’ heads within a large cone and sampled at
100L/min, attempting to capture as close to total emissions as possible. This novel approach
could explain why our study demonstrates such markedly increased overall fold differences
compared to prior studies of both activities and therapies.19,20,26,27

Our study is consistent with several others in demonstrating respiratory activity and
exertion dramatically generate aerosols, which increase with speech loudness, greater
breathing rate and volume and particularly during coughing.24–26,30–32 From the perspective
of the physiological factors involved, the increases with activities are associated with rises in
subglottic pressure, aerodynamic shear stresses and vocal fold and terminal airway openclosure frequency.9,25,29,32,33 In contrast, the pressure changes and flow velocities generated
during respiratory therapies are far less.28,34,35 The slight increases with flow and pressure in
emissions during breathing with HFNO may be due to turbulence within the upper airways,
whereas NIPPV could generate increases through greater tidal volumes and subsequent
airway open-closure, overriding our benchmark measure of ‘quiet breathing’. The increase
in emissions with NIPPV-D may be explained by a greater degree of ventilator-subject
desynchrony, which we speculate, may create pressure spikes within the facemask, causing
leaks and aerosol generation at the mask-skin interface.9,36,37 All these increases are small
compared to those with respiratory activities and are likely only detectable because of our
sampling system and very low background counts. Our study suggests the physiological
benefits of positive airway pressure, which splints open airways and reduces the pressure
changes required to breath efficiently may reduce aerosols.15,34,35 The inclusion of exercise
and forced expiratory manoeuvres, as proxies for symptomatic laboured breathing and
atelectasis, suggests an aerosol-suppressing role for such therapies in patients with
respiratory distress.
When a surgical mask was worn, the apparent filtration increased during higher velocity
activities, however our video study suggests this was partly due to masks deflecting gas
away from the collecting cone. This is consistent with other studies also showing sideways
leakage with surgical masks.38,39 While this deflection may blunt the forward plume and
remove large droplets, reducing direct person-to-person exposure, aerosols could still
accumulate in poorly ventilated spaces.15
Our study’s strengths are that we were able to capture most of the total particles emitted
over the relevant size range 0.5 to 25 µm during both respiratory activities and therapies,
with negligible background contamination. By visualising the complex exhaled airflow
patterns, we increase the confidence our method captured respiratory aerosols during
activities and therapies. Our analysis gives context by demonstrating the proportion of

larger, but far less numerous sized particles. The estimations of total volume serve as a
unique unifying comparator between activities, therapies and subjects and enables future
risk modelling during numerous scenarios.
There are several limitations to our study. We recruited ten healthy subjects who performed
a single protocol run. There may have been some differences in how subjects performed
activities, limiting the interpretation of the previously observed wide inter-subject
variation.25,30 We estimated the average residence time for particles in the cone should have
largely been sufficient for them to reach equilibrium diameter.40 However, given wide
variation between activity airflows, volumes and the addition of humidified therapy gases,
we are unsure exactly what proportion of variation in size distributions is physiological or
methodological. Our post-hoc study shows cough and FEV are modestly incompletely
sampled, highlighting the most aerosol generating activities are also the most challenging to
comprehensively measure due to high airflow velocities. Our attempts to model acute
respiratory physiology and symptoms with volitional activities are likely to differ from
patients with COVID-19. However, Hamilton observed a comparable skew in particle size
distribution in both COVID-19 patients and healthy controls suggesting potential similiarty.20
Crucially, all studies measuring aerosols are limited by not quantifying viable virus. Future
work is needed to establish if physiological exertion and respiratory symptoms increase
total viral and aerosol emissions in patients, as our study suggests.
Our data suggest the historic epidemiological association between the use of respiratory
therapies and SARS-CoV-1 transmission should be reconsidered. The therapies were
indicated for acute respiratory failure, and will have been associated with healthcare
workers spending prolonged periods in close proximity to physiologically deteriorating
patients with fast, deep breathing, cough and terminal airway closure.13 Our data suggest
these activities may have resulted in large numbers of physiologically generated aerosols.
Paradoxically, the introduction of respiratory therapies may modestly supress these. It
seems likely, if aerosols were responsible for disease transmission, they were
physiologically, not procedurally generated. This distinction is important as aerosol
protective measures are currently prioritised based solely on procedure.3,4

Our data adds to a small but growing number of quantitative studies to challenge the
rationale for describing certain respiratory therapies as AGPs.17–20 Patients acutely requiring
HFNO or NIPPV are likely to present a high disease transmission risk, but we find no basis for
withholding or delaying access to these therapies. We conclude instead, that respiratory
activities are the primary modes of aerosol generation and represent a greater transmission
risk than is widely recognised. Therefore, increased measures targeting physiologically
generated aerosols could protect patients, healthcare workers and the general public from
respiratory pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2.
