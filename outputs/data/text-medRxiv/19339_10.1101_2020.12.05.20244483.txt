Abstract:
Background: COVID-19 is the defining global crisis of our time. Secondary complication such as urinary

tract infections and sepsis, worsen the already established problem, creating a new challenge.
Objective: To characterize the features and outcomes in COVID-19 patients with sepsis and urinary tract
infection. Methods: An observational and analytical study was conducted within the framework of the
SENTAD COVID clinical trial at the Abu Dhabi Stem Cells Center, were the patients received a
nebulization therapy with the use of autologous stem cells (group A). Those patients were compared
with a not stem cells treated control arm (group B), and both received the UAE COVID 19 standard

management. An analysis of the culture samples, antimicrobial agents and the efficacy of the therapy on
patient’s outcomes was done. Results: A significant difference between the groups was found in the UTI
incidence (p=*0.0206). Patients in group A showed a lower tendency to sepsis in comparison with group
B (7% vs 21%), HR=0.35, (95% Confidence Interval: 0.13 – 0.91), p=0.0175. It was calculated a NNT=7.3.
Candida albicans was the most frequently agent causing sepsis and UTI. The massive use of broadspectrum antimicrobials was striking. Conclusions: We found a protective factor of stem cells against
secondary infection in COVID 19 cases, in terms of sepsis and UTI. The suggested immunomodulatory
effect of stem cells offers a therapeutic strategy to manage the disease and avoid several complications.
Antimicrobial agents can lead to increased opportunistic infections, so a rational approach to these
treatments must be considered.

Introduction:
The corona virus disease (COVID-19) is the defining global crisis of our time and the greatest
threat this world has faced in a long time. Many countries, including the UAE are taking every
precautionary measure to slow and control the spread.1
Taking into account that the sepsis and septic shock contribute to the cytokine storm syndrome
causing a high mortality rate (60–90%)2 and also generate an immune-mediated kidney
damage,2,3 it is crucial to prevent this event. Studies showed that there was a sharp increase in
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas and Candida species
infectious rate among the intensive care unit (ICU) COVID-19 patients, indicating that secondary
infection affect the prognosis and subsequent treatment of these patients.4
Given the immunomodulatory potential of the stem cells in sepsis and clinical evolution of
chronic conditions with the stimulation by humoral factors, strategies such as stem cell-based
therapy are being proposed to regulate inflammation, prevent or mitigate this cytokine storm
through their immunomodulatory capacity.5
The Abu Dhabi Stem Cell Centre (ADSCC) research team developed a treatment for COVID-19
(“SENTAD COVID Study” clinical trial) with the use of an autologous stem cells cocktail, called
Peripheral Blood Non-Hematopoietic Enriched Stem Cells (PBNHESC), that has shown promising
results.6 Previously, we studied the frequency of acute renal injury (AKI) in patients with COVID19 and their relation with clinical outcomes within the framework this clinical trial, finding it in
about a third of critically ill patients. In addition, those who received the treatment showed a
better tendency to improve in terms of hospital stay and biomarker evolution (amelioration of

control group.
Scientist and researchers all over the world are racing to find treatment because not only is
COVID-19 a major health crisis, but it also has the potential to create devastating social,
economic and political catastrophes to every country it touches. In this article we analysed the
incidence of sepsis and urinary tract infection (UTI) and related pathogens, in comparison with
the rest of the germs that cause sepsis in the two groups of patients of our study, after
receiving the treatment or being recruited as a control.

Objective:
To characterize the features and outcomes in COVID-19 patients with sepsis and urinary tract
infection after intervention, within the framework of the ADSCC SENTAD COVID clinical trial at
the Abu Dhabi Emirate, during the month of April of 2020.

Methods:
Within the framework of the SENTAD COVID Study clinical trial,6 we performed a multi-center,
prospective and analytical study to figure out the sepsis and UTI incidence among the patients
after the intervention. Four different hospitals from the Emirate of Abu Dhabi participated:
Sheikh Khalifa Medical City, Al Rahba Hospital, Al Mafraq Hospital and Al Ain Hospital.
From the main study, a total of 139 patients were divided in two groups for the comparison:
1. Group A (Experimental arm) COVID 19 standard care plus nebulization with PBNHESC (n=69)
2. Group B (No intervention arm) COVID 19 standard care (n=70).
Both groups fulfil the inclusion criteria: Aged ≥ 18 years, laboratory confirmation of COVID-19,
interstitial lung change judged by computed tomography, hospitalized and symptomatic
patients, referring one or more symptoms, ability to comply with test requirements and blood
collection and agrees to participate in the study.
The exclusion criteria were: Patients with diagnosis of any kind of shock, organ transplants in
the past 3 months, patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy, diagnostic of Hepatitis B
Virus (HBV) infection or Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection or Acquired
Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), current diagnosis of cancer or history of malignancies in
the past 5 years, pregnant or lactating women, patients who had participated in other clinical
trials in the past 3 months, inability to comply with test requirements and blood collection or
inability to provide informed consent.

A registration of gender, age, BMI, and comorbidities, vital signs, and biochemical studies
performed within 24 h of inclusion in the trial was done. Both groups received COVID 19
standard treatment defined as “UAE National Guidelines for Clinical Management and
Treatment of COVID 19, v.2.0” as per the Department of Health (DOH)1. A stem cell nebulization
with autologous PBNHESC-C (cocktail rich in very small embryonic-like stem cells (VSELs) and
platelets rich plasma derived growth factors, commercially named UAECell 19), was given by
two nebulization of 10cc, in two consecutive days (at least 22 hours between each one) for
patients at group A, obtained through phlebotomy of 300cc and processed at the ADSCC
laboratory, and cells were characterized by flow cytometry and inverted automated fluorescent
microscopy.
Follow up of both groups were done until the discharge. Secondary infection was diagnosed
when the patients had clinical symptoms with a positive culture (blood, sputum, others) and
UTI with a positive urine culture. Consequently, the reports of the sputum, blood, specific
seeking of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), skin/wound and urine cultures
were collected, as well as the antimicrobial treatment given.
Statistical analysis: a non-normal distribution of the variables was found, so non-parametric
statistical methods were used. A proportions comparison test (Chi-Square) for the body mass
index (BMI) categories15 and comorbidities, and U-Mann-Whitney for the dates intervals. The
Hazard Ratio (HR), 95% Confidence Interval, Number Needed to Treat (NNT) was calculated for
the sepsis complication. A significance level of p <0.05 was prefixed.
Ethics: The study was approved by the Emirates Institutional Review Board for COVID-19
Research (Ref. ID: DOH/CVDC/2020/1172). Study participants provided written informed
consent per the Helsinki Declaration.16 The consent document described the importance of
participation and explained the study’s characteristics and possible risks and benefits. All data

Results:
From the 139 patients, there were 129 males (93%) and 10 females (7%), 65 males (94%) from
the group A and 64 (91%) from the group B, and 4 females (6%) vs. 6 (9%) correspondingly. The
ages of group A ranged from 27 to 71 years old (mean 45.9 years old), and from 26 to 73 years
old in group B (mean 44.31 years old), with no significant differences between the two groups
(p=0.3677). The distribution of the BMI was between 17.06 to 45.44 (mean 27.61) in the group
in the group A, and between 16.95 to 47.75 B (mean 27.93), although there were more patients
with overweight in group A. (Table 2)
Diabetes Mellitus and hypertension were the most commons comorbidities in both groups. No
differences were found between the groups regarding those variables. There were more
smokers in the group A (1% vs 9%, *p=0.0306). Likewise, there were no differences in the scores
between the groups. Table 2 is a summary of the data.

Cultures were obtained from all the critically ill patients, 23 from group B and 20 from group A,
41 samples from blood (23 vs. 18), 23 from urine (22 vs. 1), 31 MRSA (22 vs. 9), 29 from sputum
(15 vs. 14) and 2 from wound/skin (2 vs. 0). In total 39 patient’s samples (28%) identified at
least one pathogen. From group B, 27 (38%) samples were positive: 9 from blood (39%), 8 from
urine (36%), 6 from sputum (40%), 1 MRSA (5%) and 3 from wound/skin (100%). From group A,
12 samples were positive (17%), 5 from blood (28%), 1 from urine (5%), 6 from sputum (43%).
Candida albicans caused 21% of the sepsis in both groups (7 from group B vs 2 from group A),
Staphylococcus aureus 19% (5 vs 3 cases), Pseudomonas aeruginosa 16% (3 vs 4 cases),
Streptococcus pneumonia 5% (1 vs 1 case), Klebsiella pneumoniae 9% (4 vs 0 cases), Escherichia

patients with UTI were found to have other positive cultures, 3 from blood, 2 from sputum and
1 had MRSA. The patient from group A who had UTI had sepsis caused by Candida albicans. Of
the deceased patients, only one from group B had a UTI (14%) caused by Klebsiella
pneumoniae, none from group A. (Figure 1)

In 11 cases more than one pathogen grew, 9 from group B and 2 from group A, where Candida

Regarding the use of antibiotics, 60 pacients received this therapy, 30 from each group.
Piperacillin/tazobactam was the most commonly used in both groups, followed by Meropenem,
Vancomicin and Linezolid. (Figure 2). It was marked the use of several antimicrobial agens in 42
patients (30%), 17 from group A (25%) and 25 patients from group B (35%), from those, 11
received 2 combination of antibiotics (8%, 9 from group A and 7 from group B ), 15 received 3
(11%, 11 vs. 4), 6 received 4 (4%, 4 vs. 2), 3 received 5 (2%, 3 vs. 0) and 2 received 6 (1%, 2 vs.

On the subject of the antifungical treatment, 9 patient received treatment, 2 from group A and
7 from group B. From the second group, 1 patient received 2 antifungical (this patient received
also treatment with linezolid and meropenem). The most frequently used in group B was
anidalafungin and caspofungin was in group A. (Figure 2)

Discussion:
The data analyzed from this study showed a higher incidence of COVID-19 among men,
especially among critically ill patients (no women with high scores were found during the study
period). Other authors confirmed male predominance in the incidence of this disease compared
to female, it has also been found that patients with diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart

disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cerebrovascular disease, and kidney disease
exhibit worse clinical outcomes when are infected with COVID-1917,18. Similarly, the patients
included in the study were found to have this comorbidities as risk factors forsepsis. 19 Despite
the fact that among the treated patients there were more smokers and more overweight cases,
it was found that infectious complications were lower than those of the control group.
Bacterial and fungal secondary infection rate in hospitalized adults with COVID-19 is poorly
understood, and are associated with intensive care unit admission and higher risk of invasive
procedures4. As a result, secondary infection might be a key element that leads to severe
disease and mortality. In our study, there was high culture sampling rate among he critically ill
patients in both arms, with an important role of the Candida albicans causing sepsis (21% of
cultures) and was the most common germ in association with other bacterial infections, but
treated patients were less prone to this event than controls, with a statically significant
difference, and it was found that around 7 patients are required to be treated to have this
protective effect with the stem cell nebulization (NNT=7.3). Surprisingly, despite the fact that all
septic patients had a urinary catheter, the rate of UTI was not strikingly high in group A
compared with group B. An attenuation of the bacterial sepsis stem cell mediated had been
described, via several mechanisms such as improving the phagocytic ability, secreting antimicrobial peptides5,20, and increasing bacterial clearance.5,21
The COVID-19 sepsis can be associated with an immunosuppresive effect of the SARS-Cov-2 and
for instance, as shownin this study C Albicans,as well as Pseudomonas, are more frequenty
found as oportunistic patogen associted with a depressed immune response. Taking into count
that a large proportion of patients had received therapy with one or more broadspectrum
antibacterials at the time of culture, in some cases up to 6 antibiotics, the reason of the fungal
sepsis could be related to these managements. Other authors also found evidenced a strong
increase in opportunistic infections rate among SARS ICU patients, due to MRSA, Pseudomonas,
and Candida species.4,22 There is being described the biofilm formation as a resistant mediator,
especially in those with MRSA positive culture, which is a survival mechanism, since it
constitutes a reservoir of bacteria with multi-resistance. The antibacterial therapy, if
indicated, should be prescribed in line with local guidelines and reviewed with clinical response
at 48 to 72 hours. If no evidence of bacterial coinfection is found, then stopping antibacterial
therapy should be considered.25 It is well known that the prolonged use of antimicrobials and
their inappropriate use, contribute to the development of major consequences, and we are
facing a lack of data about antimicrobial use during this pandemic worldwide in just a few
months, then the emergence of new resistance to this treatmets should be expected, without
counting other adverse effects of these therapies for kidney and liver function for example,
with unimaginable implications for human and animal health and the environment.26
23,24

Another reason of these secondary infections must be related with the lymphopenic status of
the critically ill COVID-19 patients already found in the main study6. There is a sustained and
substantial reduction of the peripheral lymphocyte counts, especially CD4 T and CD8 T cells, as

the representative of immune suppression stage after the cytokine storm activation phase
increasing the risk of developing secondary infection4,27.
Even though the median hospital stay after the intervention was not significant between the
groups, the range is much shorter in group A patients than in group B, given the homogeneity
of the treated group due to the therapy, and the statistical dispersion of the data of the control
group, giving another hypothesis of the lower incidence of sepsis and UTI in group A, since the
shorter hospital stay is a protective factor against nosocomial infections28.
Moreover, due to the autologous origin of the therapy, there are no immunologic reactions,
with rare adverse effects more linked with the collection of the blood (fainting and dizziness
may occur).
There are some limitations to the current study. It was carried in 4 different hospitals, each one
with different criteria for taking cultures, as well the selection of the initial empiric
antimicrobials treatment, can cause multiple germ resistant and negativization of some of the
samples. It is our responsability for implementing and developing actions to control or stop the
disease, but also change dangerous practices, through appropriate and consensual use of
antimicrobials.

Conclusion:
In this study, we found a protective factor of stem cells against secondary infection in COVID 19
cases, in terms of sepsis and UTI. Patients in the treated group showed a lower tendency to
develop these events compared to the control group. The suggested immunomodulatory effect
of stem cells offers a therapeutic strategy to manage the disease and avoid several
complications, becoming a crucial adjuvant tool for healing and achieving early recovery in
severe COVID-19 infections. It is well known that during this disease, patients had received
several antimicrobial agents that can lead to increased fungal and opportunistic infections, so a
rational approach to these treatments should be considered.

Take Home Message:
There is a significant frequency of sepsis and UTI as complications in COVID-19, related to the
antimicrobial use, length of hospital stays and invasive procedures. Novel stem cell nebulization
therapy may improve the clinical evolution and frequency of this complications.
