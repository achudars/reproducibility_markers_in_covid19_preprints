ABSTRACT (244 words)
Our objective was to determine strategies that could potentially reduce the risk of
hospitalizations from COVID-19 due to underlying conditions. We used data (N=444,649) from
the 2017 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System to identify potentially modifiable risk
factors associated with reporting any of the underlying conditions (cardiovascular disease,
asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, hypertension or obesity) found to
increase risk of US hospitalizations for COVID-19. Risk factors included lifetime smoking,
sedentary lifestyle, and inadequate fruit and vegetable consumption. Multiple logistic regression
in Stata produced adjusted odds ratios (AORs) used to estimate population attributable-risk
(PAR) in Excel. PARs for the 3 risk factors ranged from 12.4% for inactivity to 15.6% for diet
for a combined PAR of 36.3%, implying that total elimination of these 3 risk factors could
potentially reduce underlying conditions as much as 36%. This suggests that reducing COVID19 hospitalizations might be a measurable and feasible US goal for the coronavirus pandemic.
The simple lifestyle changes of increasing physical activity and fruit and vegetable consumption
could reduce obesity, a key underlying condition and risk factor for 4 others. Reducing obesity
and inactivity may also boost immunity. With uncertainly around how long the pandemic might
last, other proposed strategies include wearing face masks when social distancing is not feasible,
and addressing the special issues for nursing home residents. Such actions have the potential to
lessen the impact of COVID-19 in the short term along with providing long term health benefits
regarding chronic conditions.

Introduction
One of the novel aspects of the current coronavirus pandemic is that information is constantly
being updated as more studies are published. Based on early data from China1 people at risk of
complications or death from COVID-19 include adults with cardiovascular disease (CVD),
diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, asthma, hypertension, and cancer. Recent US data on
hospitalizations for COVID-19 indicate a slightly different list of conditions affecting risk, with
obesity added and cancer subtracted.2 Those results indicate that 89% of those hospitalized for
COVID-19 had an underlying condition, the most common being hypertension, obesity, chronic
lung disease (including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), diabetes, and
cardiovascular disease.2 Estimates of the percentage of adults who report any of those 6
underlying conditions are 56.0% overall, with ranges across states and demographic groups.3 The
Guidelines for Opening up America Again released by the White House on April 16, 20204
include a similar list to define vulnerable individuals, except that list includes elderly (undefined)
and those with a compromised immune system and omits cardiovascular disease. And a recent
study covering over a million US hospitalizations found that adults with a similar list of
underlying conditions were 6 times as likely as those without underlying conditions to be
hospitalized and 12 times as likely to die from COVID-19.5

Our objective for this study was to identify potentially modifiable risk factors that increase the
likelihood of reporting any of the 6 underlying conditions (cardiovascular disease, asthma,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, hypertension or obesity) found to increase risk
of US hospitalizations for COVID-19. 2,3 Preliminary unadjusted results show that older adults,
men, and African-Americans were more likely to report an underlying condition, which are all

groups that hospitalization data2 suggested were disproportionately affected by COVID-19. Each
of the risk factors of lifetime smoking, sedentary lifestyle, and inadequate fruit and vegetable
consumption in unadjusted results was associated with increased likelihood of reporting any of
the 6 underlying conditions and an additive effect was suggested. 3 This study adds multiple
logistic regression and population attributable-risk (PAR) to the analysis to estimate the
proportion of the outcome that is caused by the risk factor or exposure. PARs take into account
not only the relative risk of the factor but also the prevalence in the population and are useful in
determining potential benefits of interventions as they suggest how much the outcome could be
reduced by elimination or partial elimination of the factor.6 For example, Barnes and Yaffe
estimated that 7% of Alzheimer’s disease cases in the US were potentially attributable to not
completing high school.7 This study also adds measures of social determinants of health
(SDOH): income < $25,000; not completing high school; African American or American Indian
or Alaska Native; underinsurance; and living in the South or Midwest census region as opposed
to the Northeast or West. Although causality has not been shown for each risk factor for each of
the conditions included in our outcome, causal associations have been shown for all risk factors
for at least one of the 6 outcomes included in our definition.6,8 We also assumed that all chosen
SDOH measures had a role in causation for at least one of the separate outcomes. Depending on
study results, our goal was to develop strategies to potentially reduce COVID-19 hospitalizations
and deaths.

We used publicly available 2017 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data 9
from 444,649 adults ages 18 and older in the 50 states and DC. Data were adjusted for the
probability of selection and weighted to be representative of the adult population in each state by
age, gender, race/ethnicity, marital status, education, home ownership, and telephone type and
included weights and stratum variables needed for analysis. Reliability and validity of the
BRFSS have been found to be moderate to high for many survey measures.10 The median
response rate for cell phone and land line surveys combined for the states included was 47.2%,
ranging from 33.9% in California to 61.1% in Utah.11
Measures
The outcome measure was used previously3 and includes adults reporting any of cardiovascular
disease (CVD), asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, hypertension,
and obesity, with body mass index >30.0 kg/m2 based on self-reported height and weight. Risk
factor measures were consistent with 3 of 4 upstream behavioral risk factors: 6 tobacco use, diet,
and nutrition, and physical inactivity and their relationships6,8 to the components of our outcome
are shown in Figure 1. Ever smoking included respondents who smoked 100 cigarettes in their
lifetime whether they currently smoked or not. Inadequate fruit and vegetable consumption was
defined as consuming the combination <5 times per day based on responses to five separate
questions and respondents who did not participate in any leisure time physical activity in the past
month were considered to have a sedentary lifestyle. Once unknowns were removed, final N’s
for the 3 separate risk factors ranged from 389,200 for fruit and vegetable consumption to
426,403 for reporting ever smoking.

Our SDOH measures were consistent with the 5 general categories in Healthy People 202012 and
limited by availability on the BRFSS. SDOH measures were 1. household income < $25,000 vs
all else including unknown; 2. not completing high school; 3. African American or American
Indian or Alaska Native vs. all else; 4. underinsurance, defined as either no health insurance or
needing to see a doctor in the past year but unable to, due to cost; and 5. living in the South or
Midwest census region as opposed to the Northeast or West. Measures 3 and 5 were defined
based on preliminary analysis3 of the data showing these groups at higher risk for reporting any
of the underlying conditions.
Demographic measures included gender and age (18-24, 25--34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65-74, and
75 years and older).

Analysis
Stata version 14.1 (Stata Corp LP, College Station, TX) was used for data analysis to account for
the complex sample design of the BRFSS. Point estimates and 95% confidence intervals are
reported for cross tabulations for the composite measure and each component outcome by each
of the SDOH measures and risk factors. Logistic regression was done to obtain adjusted odds
ratios (AORs) to use in estimating population-attributable risk (PAR) using Levin’s formula13
and Excel. Refusals and “don’t know” responses are removed unless otherwise indicated
(income). Composite measures of the 3 risk factors and the 5 SDOH measures were created to
determine if a linear response was confirmed by multiple logistic regression. A combined PAR
was computed using the following formula to avoid totals >100%:7,14
Combined PAR = 1 − (1 − PAR1) ∗ (1 − PAR2) ∗ (1 − PAR3)...

Results
Overall prevalence of reporting any of the underlying conditions was 56.0% (95% CI 55.7–56.3)
with results for demographic groups available elsewhere.3 Prevalence rates of the separate
components were 8.5% for CVD, 6.6% for COPD, 9.1% for asthma, 10.8% for diabetes, 32.4%
for hypertension, and 30.1% for obesity, while for risk factors were 40.4% for ever smoking,
26.6% for sedentary lifestyle, 84.1% for inadequate fruit and vegetable consumption; 91.1% of
study adults reported ≥1 of the 3 risk factors. Substituting current smoking with a prevalence of
16.4%, 88.1%, of adults reported ≥1 of the 3 risk factors. For the SDOH measures, 13.5% did
not finish high school, 23.2% reported income <$25,000, 20.9% were underinsured, 58.7% lived
in the South or Midwest, 13.0% were Black or American Indian and 75.9% reported ≥1.
Unadjusted results (Table 1) show that all 3 risk factors were directly associated with the key
outcome and with all its components except asthma, where consumption of fruits and vegetables
was not significant. Among SDOH measures, income, education, and race were directly
associated with all outcomes, while being underinsured was protective or had no effect for the
key outcome and 3 of its components, and living in the South or Midwest increased risk for all
outcomes except asthma, where region was slightly but significantly protective.

Results of multiple logistic regression (Table 2) for any underlying condition indicate that the
highest adjusted odds ratio (AOR) was 7.3 (6.8-7.8) for adults ages 70-79 and all measures
included in the model had AORs of 1.12 or higher. Thus adjusted results confirm all unadjusted
results except for underinsurance which is significantly associated with higher risk in adjusted

results. Adjusted results also add men to those at significantly higher likelihood of reporting an
underlying condition. If a composite measure is used in the models instead of the separate risk
factor measures, the AOR for all 3 risk factors vs. none is 2.62 (2.43-2.82) and that for all 5
SDOH measures is 2.51 (1.68-3.73). Logistic regression results for the 6 underlying conditions
are available in supplemental tables. Results for PARs for the 3 risk factors for any underlying
condition plus each component condition are shown in Table 3 indicating combined PARs
ranging from 20.4% for asthma to 66.9% for COPD. At least 2 of the 3 risk factors contribute
attributable-risk for each outcome and all 3 contribute a combined 36.3% for any of the 6.
Combined PARs for SDOH measures ranged from 13.5% for asthma to 37.5% for COPD and
29.2% for any of the 6.
Discussion
The list of underlying conditions has changed over time but since using US hospitalization data
which added obesity 2,3 to the original list based on data from China1 the major conditions on
the list 4,5 remain fairly constant as the ones chosen for study. In at least one large and recent
study, hypertension was included in cardiovascular disease rather than listed as a separate
condition.5 Excluding age as a criterion for risk allows the study of age associations. In our
adjusted results, older age, being male, African American, American Indian, not finishing high
school, having income <$25,000, being underinsured, and living in the South or Midwest
census regions are all significantly associated with reporting any of the 6 underlying conditions.
The first three listed are consistent with US data showing that older adults, men, and African
Americans are disproportionately among those hospitalized for COVID-19 and suggest that the
reason may be due to their being more likely to report an underlying condition.

PAR results for the 3 potentially modifiable risk factors are consistent with results for the actual
causes of deaths which have been reported as tobacco, diet and physical activity.15 Figure 1
illustrates the relationship between the 3 upstream risk factors and the underlying conditions,
with obesity as an intermediate outcome for 4 of the 6. Other outcomes such as cognitive
decline and dementia have also been shown to be associated with these risk factors.7,8,16
Realistically, changing behavior is going to have limited effectiveness in the short term but in
the long term may reduce risk and thus hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19 and other
chronic conditions shown to be associated with these risk factors.6-8 Also it is important to
realize that risk factor reduction will be most effective for the 44% of adults who do not already
have an underlying condition and that only current smoking (not lifetime) is potentially
modifiable. However, a significant short term effect is possible from simply not being totally
sedentary and adding more fruits and vegetables to the diet to reduce obesity, which is one of
the most prevalent of the underlying conditions increasing risk of hospitalizations.2 In addition,
as noted in Figure 1, obesity is a risk factor for CVD, asthma, diabetes, and hypertension. As
shown in Table 3, total elimination of all 3 obesity risk factors would reduce obesity by 28%;
not shown is that if everyone did some exercise and ate fruits and vegetables 5 times each day,
obesity could be reduced by 26.9% to below 22%. If HALF of all adults made those changes,
obesity prevalence could be reduced below 26% with the potential for reductions in the 4 other
underlying conditions for which obesity is a risk factor.

Results from other studies suggest additional benefits from increasing exercise and fruit and
vegetable consumption. A study of influenza epidemics found that being overweight increases
risk of infection, so concluded that losing weight and engaging in moderate exercise can boost
immunity.17 Our results suggest that increasing fruit and vegetable consumption can help weight
loss efforts. Quitting smoking may reduce any direct effects of smoking on COVID-19
complications, as ICU admissions have been reported to be more common among smokers.18
Strategies to reduce these risk factors such as public health campaigns could be done within
current pandemic guidelines through ad campaigns using various media outlets. It seems that
most conversations about COVID-19 have focused on stopping its spread or treating it symptoms
with little or no attention to how major complications might be prevented.

Estimated PARs for the SDOH measures are lower than those for risk factors and potentially
not as easy to modify especially in the short term. But they serve as a reminder that the risk
factor measures were controlled for age, gender and the 5 SDOH measures and vice versa. So
for example, higher rates of underlying conditions in the South and Midwest compared with the
West and Northeast were controlled for any differences in risk factors, education, income, etc.
Further study will be needed to determine if American Indians, lower income adults, those
without a high school diploma, the underinsured, and residents of Southern and Midwestern
states also have higher hospitalization rates compared with those not in those groups. Being
underinsured could create separate issues with access to care and treatment options especially
since these underlying conditions are likely considered pre-existing conditions by most
healthcare insurers.

In addition of the potential of lowering risk through lifestyle change, there is evidence that
among hospitalized adults with COVID-19 and diabetes19 those with well-controlled blood
glucose had lower risk of undesirable outcomes compared with less well-controlled levels.
Among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and coexisting hypertension, use of ACEI/ARB
was associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality compared with ACEI/ARB nonusers.20
Thus ongoing management of existing underlying conditions to reduce risk as much as possible
should be an objective. Quantitating any reduction in hospitalizations due to risk factor
reduction or better management of diabetes or hypertension will be extremely difficult,
especially while the pandemic continues.

Many uncertainties remain with the coronavirus including when and how the pandemic will end.
Perhaps an effective vaccine will be found that enough US adults will accept or a treatment will
be discovered that greatly reduces the impact of COVID-19. But it is probably safe to assume it
will not disappear on its own anytime soon and meanwhile life must go on. Results of this study
suggest merit in focusing on the more than half of adults with underlying conditions that increase
their risk of hospitalizations and defining a goal for the US coronavirus pandemic as reducing
hospitalizations and deaths. As results from this study suggest, there are a variety of potential
options to achieve that goal. We suggest that a focus on risk factors for underlying conditions is
warranted as shown by results and cited studies in this paper. Any possible reduction in COVID19 cases due to a possible boost in immunity would be seen as a bonus.17 In addition to
addressing the 3 risk factors and management of diabetes and hypertension, general strategies to

reduce the spread of the disease should be continued or strengthened where needed. These
include social distancing and wearing masks21 which have been shown to be quite effective.
About 49%3 of employed adults have an underlying condition so some accommodation may be
needed to protect these employed adults from acquiring COVID-19 or the consequences of
losing their income if they chose not to return to work. Because a large fraction of COVID-19
deaths in the US have been among the 1.3 million patients in nursing homes22 plans for this
population will be critical and are already being proposed.23 We hope that they will include
reporting more COVID-19 data (e.g. hospitalizations) separately for nursing home patients as
they currently do for deaths. We also suggest that consideration be given to vaccinating all
nursing home patients with MMR vaccine. Studies and observations have suggested that the
MMR vaccine might offer some protection against COVID-19 or at least its most severe
consequences.24,25
Limitations
There are several limitations to this study including variability in reliability and validity of the
self-reported data.10 Validity was usually high when compared to medical records but obesity
and current tobacco use showed some differences between self-reports and physical measures.10
It is possible that additional conditions will be found to be associated with COVID-19
hospitalizations and death, some of which might not be available on the BRFSS. PAR estimates
assume there is a causal relationship and this may not be true for the SDOH measures. Persons
who ever smoked were grouped together with no differentiation for the length of time smoked or
how long it might have been since they quit which may result in imprecision in the accuracy of
the attributable-risk estimates for smoking. The generalizability of these results is unknown but
there is no reason to believe it would not be good. Another study limitation is that only non12

institutionalized adults were surveyed so the 1.3 million adults 23 in nursing homes who may be
more likely to have the outcomes studied were excluded. Household adults who are physically
or mentally unable to respond to a survey are also excluded which may omit some potential
respondents with these underlying conditions.26 The effect of excluding persons unable to
respond to a telephone survey implies that adults in this current study may be less affected by
their outcomes than other adults in the community.
Conclusion
Based on evidence from this and other studies, we propose a measureable US goal for addressing
the coronavirus pandemic of reducing hospitalizations and death by focusing on 3 risk factors for
the 6 underlying conditions found to be associated with increased risk of hospitalizaions.2 Shortterm strategies for non-smokers to increase physical activity and fruit and vegetable consumption
could perhaps even boost immunity and reduce the number of COVID-19 cases while reducing
obesity. Attention should also be given to improving blood glucose control in adults with
diabetes and blood pressure control among those with hypertension. These results suggest that
along with the wearing of face masks and/or physical distancing to help prevent the spread of
COVID-19, there are simple lifestyle changes that have the potential to lessen its impact.
