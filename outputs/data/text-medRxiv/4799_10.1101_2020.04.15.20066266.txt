Abstract:
Object: To evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of α-Lipoic acid (ALA) for
critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Methods: A randomized, single-blind, group sequential, active-controlled trial was
performed at JinYinTan Hospital, Wuhan, China. Between February 2020 and March
2020, 17 patients with critically ill COVID-19 were enrolled in our study. Eligible
patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either ALA (1200 mg/d,
intravenous infusion) once daily plus standard care or standard care plus equal volume
saline infusion (placebo) for 7 days. All patients were monitored within the 7 days
therapy and followed up to day 30 after therapy. The primary outcome of this study
was the Sequential Organ Failure Estimate (SOFA) score, and the secondary outcome
was the all-cause mortality within 30 days.
Result: Nine patients were randomized to placebo group and 8 patients were
randomized to ALA group. SOFA score was similar at baseline, increased from 4.3 to
6.0 in the placebo group and increased from 3.8 to 4.0 in the ALA group (P=0.36)
after 7 days. The 30-day all-cause mortality tended to be lower in the ALA group (3/8,
37.5%) compared to that in the placebo group (7/9, 77.8%, P=0.09).
Conclusion: In our study, ALA use is associated with lower SOFA score increase and
lower 30-day all-cause mortality as compared with the placebo group. Although the
mortality rate was two-folds higher in placebo group than in ALA group, only
borderline statistical difference was evidenced due to the limited patient number.
Future studies with larger patient cohort are warranted to validate the role of ALA in
critically ill patients with COVID-19.

Introduction
Since December 2019, the novel coronavirus pneumonia 2019 (COVID-19) induced
by severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a worldwide
pandemic and is overwhelming health care systems globally. Thus far, no therapeutics
have yet been proven effective for the treatment of severe COVID-19, and the
mortality rate of severe COVID-19 patients is high[1-5]. Pathological results
suggested that the lung displayed diffuse alveolar damage. In addition, interstitial
mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates, mainly lymphocytes, were observed in both
lungs[6]. Moreover, several studies have shown that CRP, D-dimer and serum
proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β, etc.) was increased in patients with severe
COVID-19[6-9]. These findings suggested that the cytokine release syndrome (CRS)
may be associated with COVID-19. CRS is a systemic inflammatory response that
can be induced by infection and certain drugs. The sharp increase of pro-inflammatory
cytokines is the main manifestation, which can cause damage to the heart, lungs and
other organs[10]. Therefore, regulating systemic inflammatory response may be a key
method for treating patients with COVID-19, and several clinical studies targeting
CRS have been conducted[11]. Viral infection can also cause the production of
reactive oxygen species (ROS), and ROS plays an important role in virus replication
and invasion[12], organ damage[13, 14], and systemic inflammatory response[15-20].
α-Lipoic acid (ALA), as an antioxidant, has been confirmed to reduce systemic
inflammatory response in patients with acute coronary syndromes, liver
transplantation patients, and kidney-pancreas combined transplantation
patients[21-24]. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether ALA
could alleviate systemic inflammatory response by reducing ROS production, thereby
improve organ function and the prognosis of critically ill patients with COVID-19.

Methods
Study design and participants
This study was a randomized, single-blind, group sequential, active-controlled trial.
Participants were recruited from February 2020 to March 2020. 17 participants with
critically ill COVID-19 hospitalized in JinYinTan Hospital, Wuhan, China were
enrolled. Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Ethics Committee of
Zhongshan Hospital(B2020-030). The informed consent was signed by all participants.
The trial has been registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry

Randomization and Blinding
We used mixed randomization for unpredictability in allocation sequences[25]. The
allocation sequences were placed in the sealed opaque envelopes. We randomly
assigned critically ill patients with COVID-19 to the treatment group and control

group in a 1:1 ratio. Blinding is saved until research have been completed and the
database is finally unlocked. Participants and study personnel were aware of the
study-group assignments, but outcome adjudicators were not.

Procedures
Patients in the treatment group were treated with ALA (1200 mg/d, intravenous
infusion) once daily plus for 7 days on top of standard medical care. Patients in the
control group were treated with equal volume saline infusion on top of standard
medical care for 7 days. ALA is discontinued when the treatment plan is completed or
the patient meets the halfway withdrawal criteria. Withdrawal criteria: (1) The subject
himself requested to withdraw from the trial; (2) An intolerable adverse event or an
adverse event that the investigator believes must be withdrawn from the study; (3)
Those who cannot be treated according to the protocol, have poor compliance, or the
physician believes that they should withdraw from the trial.

Clinical and Laboratory Monitoring
Initial investigations included onset time, CT results, nucleic acid test results,
previous history, heart-related symptoms (chest tightness, etc.), NYHA classification,
personal history, comorbidities and treatment plans, comprehensive physical
examination (including blood pressure, heart rate, weight, oxygen Saturation
measurement), Sequential Organ Failure Estimate (SOFA) Score, electrocardiogram
results, echocardiogram results and laboratory test results (blood routine, liver and
kidney function, electrolytes, blood glucose, blood lipids, CRP, urine pregnancy test
(women), brain natriuretic peptide, myocardial enzymes, troponin, coagulation
function, serum inflammatory factor tests). During the clinical follow-up period (days
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), the following data were collected from patients each day:
symptoms, blood pressure, heart rate, fingertip oxygen saturation (recorded twice
daily: 9am and 3pm), SOFA score, major and minor endpoint event records, adverse
event records and laboratory tests (blood routine, Liver and kidney function
electrolytes, myocardial enzymes, troponin, NT-proBNP, CPR, coagulation).

Primary outcomes and Secondary outcomes
The primary outcome of this study was the SOFA Score, and the secondary outcome
was the all-cause mortality up to 30 days. All outcomes were determined by an
independent clinical endpoint determination committee.

Statistical analysis
We estimated that with 10 deaths the study would have 68% power to detect a 50%
improvement in survival with ALA versus standard control group (from admission to
discharge), at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05. Primary and secondary endpoints were
measured in the intention-to-treat population, which included all patients who
underwent randomization. The Kaplan–Meier method was used to estimate
time-to-event end points. Two-sided stratified log-rank tests and 2Log (LR) test were
used. Cox regression models were applied to estimate hazard ratios. Safety
evaluations were included all patients who received at least one dose of study
medication. Continuous variables were described using mean, median, and standard
deviation, and examined using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) or Wilcoxon rank sum
test or Kruskal-Wallis test. Categorical variables were described by frequency, and
assessed using chi-square test or Fisher exact test. Changes in laboratory data, signs
and examination items, and adverse events before and after treatment in the two
groups will be analyzed as safety indicators. This study does not estimate missing data.
Statistical analysis was performed using SAS 9.13. Values of P < .05 were considered
statistically significant, and the two-sided test is represented by a 95% confidence
interval.

Results
Characteristics of the Patients
A total of 17 eligible patients with critically ill COVID-19 were enrolled in our study.
8 patients were assigned to receive ALA and 9 patients to standard care alone. A total
of 13 patients (76.5%) were men, the age range was 51 to 91 years, and the median
age of patients was 63 years (interquartile range [IQR], 59 to 66 years) (Table 1).
There were no significant differences between groups in demographic characteristics,
baseline laboratory test results and SOFA Score at enrollment.

points from 4.3 to 6.0. In the same time period, the average SOFA Score in the ALA
treatment group increased by 0.2 points from 3.8 to 4.0 (Figure 2). There was no
significant difference in SOFA Score between the placebo group and the ALA group
(p=0.36).

Secondary Outcomes
After a 30-day follow-up, the 30-day all-cause mortality was 77.8% (7/9) in the
placebo group, and 37.5% (3/8) in the ALA group (Figure. 3). The 30-day all-cause
mortality was numerically lower in the ALA group than in the placebo group, a
borderline statistical significance was observed (P=0.09).

events occurred during the trial.

Discussion
Our study enrolled 17 patients with critically ill COVID-19 in Wuhan JinYinTan
Hospital. The results suggested ALA treatment might be able to improve 30-day
survival rate of patients with critically ill COVID-19 and slow down the increase of
SOFA score, both parameters did not reach statistical significance due to the limited
patient number, but the tendency of improvement is clear to see.
The protection efficiency of ALA in critically ill COVID-19 patients might be
explained in two aspects, antioxidant and anti-inflammation. Firstly, ALA could
ameliorate virus-induced organ dysfunction by counteracting ROS. Ross[14] revealed
that excessive superoxide induced by influenza A virus infection could cause organ
injury, which could be alleviated by inhibiting ROS production. Besides, Xian and

colleagues[12] suggested that the replication of H5N1 influenza virus was impeded by
overexpression of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) , which was one of the
antioxidation enzymes. Secondly, the anti-inflammation effect of ALA was verified by
a series of clinical trials. ALA could significantly reduce levels of serum
inflammatory cytokines and improve symptoms of some severe patients (such as
acute coronary syndrome, etc.)[21-24]. Some clinical trials have been designed to
dampen inflammatory responses. One clinical trial (ChiCTR2000029765) reported
that neutralizing IL-6 with tocilizumab could quick control of high fever and
respiratory symptoms in 21 patients with COVID-19[11], which revealed feasibility
of anti-inflammation treatment for COVID-19.
The clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine combined with azithromycin in the
treatment of COVID-19 by Molina et al[29] (N = 11) focused on patients with mild
COVID-19. In another clinical trial focused on patients with severe COVID-19, there
was no significant difference in viral RNA loads or duration of viral RNA
detectability between the lopinavir-ritonavir combination treatment group and the
control group, but lopinavir-ritonavir treatment group presented with lower all-cause
mortality on day 28 (P>0.05)[30]. Thus, in addition to the anti-virus treatment
strategy, searching for other treatment strategies are of clinical importance aiming to
alleviate the complications of COVID patients and reduce the mortality rate of
patients with severe and critically ill COVID-19 was also essential.
This trial has several limitations. In particular, the trial did not have sufficient number
of cases. Because the epidemic situation in Wuhan was rapidly under control during
the trial period, and critically ill COVID patients participating other clinical trials
could not be enrolled in this study, only 17 critically ill COVID patients were enrolled
in this study. Another limitation is that we use all-cause mortality as our secondary
outcome, which could not distinguish death due to primary SARS-COV-2 insult from
secondary bacterial infection, which was common in late phrase of critically ill
patients with COVID-19. Further clinical studies are needed to verify the promising
efficacy of ALA injection in patients with critically ill COVID-19.

In conclusion, our results derived from the small number of critically ill COVID
patients are promising and hope this report might stimulate the initiation of further
clinical studies in larger patient cohort to validate the role of ALA on reducing the
short-term mortality rate among critically ill COVID-19 patients.
