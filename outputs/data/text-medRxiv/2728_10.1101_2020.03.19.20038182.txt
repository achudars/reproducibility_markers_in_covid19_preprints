Abstract
Background: Current outbreaks of COVID-19 are threatening the health care systems of several countries around the world. Control measures, based on isolation and quarantine, have been
shown to decrease and delay the burden of the ongoing epidemic. With respect to the ongoing
COVID-19 epidemic, recent modelling work shows that this intervention technique may be inadequate to control local outbreaks, even when perfect isolation is assumed. Furthermore, the
effect of infectiousness prior to symptom onset combined with a significant proportion of asymptomatic infectees further complicates the use of contact tracing. Antivirals, which decrease the
viral load and reduce the infectiousness, could be integrated in the control measures in order to
augment the feasibility of controlling the epidemic.
Methods: Using a simulation-based model of viral transmission we tested the efficacy of different intervention measures for the control of COVID-19. For individuals that were identified
through contact tracing, we evaluate two procedures: monitoring individuals for symptoms onset
and testing of individuals. Moreover, we investigate the effect of a potent antiviral compound
on the contact tracing process.
Findings: The use of an antiviral drug, in combination with contact tracing, quarantine and
isolation, results in a significant decrease of the final size, the peak incidence, and increases the
probability that the outbreak will fade out.
Interpretation: For an infectious disease in which presymptomatic infections are plausible,
an intervention measure based on contact tracing performs better when realized together with
testing instead of monitoring, provided that the test is able to detect infections during the incubation period. In addition, in all tested scenarios, the model highlights the benefits of the
administration of an antiviral drug in addition to quarantine, isolation and contact tracing. The
resulting control measure, could be an effective strategy to control local and re-emerging outbreaks of COVID-19.

To control local outbreaks of COVID-19, we investigate the use of contact tracing and isolation in
combination with an antiviral compound. Even when perfect isolation is in place, it may not be
sufficient to contain a local COVID-19 outbreak. 1 Therefore, in the absence of a vaccine, an antiviral
drug in addition to isolation could be used to contain the current COVID-19 epidemic. Today there
are no Corona-specific drugs and the development of potent and safe drugs typically takes years.
However, there are a number of drugs, originally targeted towards other viral infections, in clinical
trials for their ability to control SARS-CoV-2 infection. Most of these drugs inhibit key components
of the coronavirus infection life cycle including viral entry, replication, RNA synthesis and protein
synthesis. We therefore assume that an antiviral compound will reduce the viral load of an infected
individual with COVID-19. For our modeling experiments we searched for an experimental drug
for which viral load data were available to inform our model. Remdesivir, was recently shown to
inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro 2 and is currently under evaluation in clinical trials. Remdesivir is an
investigational broad-spectrum antiviral agent that has been developed against the Ebola-virus. It
functions as a nucleotide-analog inhibitor of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and has
activity against a wide range of RNA-viruses. 3 In addition, it is also active against SARS-CoV and
MERS-CoV, which is expected given the high level of similarity between the genes that are involved
in the replication cycle of these corona viruses. For the aforementioned reasons we inform our
model with data on the control of MERS-CoV viral load by Remdesivir in a translational murine
model. 4 The animal model that was utilized was specifically developed to better approximate the
pharmacokinetics and drug exposure profile in humans. Therefore, the measure of viral titers in
lung tissue at different time-points in this model serves as a reasonable proxy for viral dynamics
upon compound exposure in the controlled setting of a viral challenge. To this end, we calibrate
the model to represent the viral load decrease thereof.
In this manuscript we first present the effect of isolation, considering both home quarantine (for
individuals that are part of a contact trace network and for infected individuals with mild symptoms)
and hospital isolation (for severe cases). We argue that when an individual is quarantined at home,
this will only result in a partial reduction of contacts, accounting for contacts with household
members and other isolation imperfectness. To compensate for this imperfect isolation, we consider
the use of an antiviral compound. We test these different control measures in a simulation study
that aims at representing, given the available information, the current COVID-19 epidemic. While
at this phase of the epidemic, many countries are already beyond the point of local containment. We
do however expect that the methodology we propose will be key to avoid a second peak, especially
given the limited depletion of susceptibles.

Introduction

Methods
Epidemiological model

The disease dynamics are depicted in the left panel of Figure 1. The possible transitions between
epidemic classes are described by the arrows.
Individuals are initially susceptible (S) and once infected, they enter the exposed class (E). The
infection, that is at first asymptomatic (Ia ), can lead to the onset of mild (Im ) or severe symptoms
(Is ). Symptomatic individuals are hospitalized (H), where they are isolated, or are confined in
home quarantine (Q), based on the severity of symptoms. Ultimately, all infectives are assumed to
either recover from infection or die (R). Individuals that are hospitalized are immediately isolated;
therefore they can no longer transmit the disease. The quarantined individuals, can still make
contacts, although at a decreased rate.
The transition from the susceptible to the exposed class is governed by a stochastic process based

on the notion of infectious contact processes. 5 First, contacts between individuals are generated.
When such contacts are generated between susceptible and infectious people, these can result in
an infection event according to a Bernoulli probability value based on the time since infection.
This probability is computed, at a precise time point, as the product of two components: the
infectiousness measure, ŒΩ(t), which quantifies the level of infectiousness over time, and the total
amount of infectivity q, i.e. the number of infections over the contact rate. 6 The function ŒΩ(t) is
defined over the exposed and infectious period, or analogously over the incubation and symptomatic
period, along which it integrates to one. This function is scaled to have a similar shape among
different infectives, based on their lengths of exposed and infectious period. According to this
framework, an infectious individual makes effective contacts at a rate, r(t) given by:
r(t) = Œª ‚àó q ‚àó ŒΩ(t)

where Œª is the contact rate. The mean number of effective contacts is an approximation of the
reproduction number. The two quantities are identical in an infinite and homogeneous population,
where the probability of making two effective contacts with the same person is zero. For the
considered population size, the probability of this event is extremely low. Therefore, throughout
the manuscript, we approximate the reproduction number with the mean number of secondary
cases.
In the considered framework, isolation/quarantine is implemented by reducing the contact rate Œª at
the time of diagnosis. To date, little is known about the difference in viral load among severe and
mild cases. Zhou et al. 7 indicate that in nasal and throat swabs the viral load is higher in mild cases.
Due to this uncertainty, we assume that the same curve is defined for all the infected individuals.
In this work, we assume the population to be homogeneous, closed and finite population. These
assumptions relate to the control measures currently in place, e.g. in Italy, aiming at containing
immigration and emigration in a country with an ongoing outbreak.

Contact tracing and isolation

In order to implement contact tracing we keep track of a contact history Hi for each individual
i for all contacts made since the time of infection. When an individual i is found to be infected
with SARS-CoV-2, a contact tracing procedure is started. We assume that each contact in Hi will
be traced back successfully with probability Œ∑. Depending on the considered scenario, traced-back
individuals will be monitored or tested. When individuals are found positive for SARS-CoV-2, they
will be put in quarantine/isolation. For certain scenarios, next to quarantine, we also inject infected
individuals with an antiviral drug (i.e., Remdesivir).
We assume that the test can detect infection after two days since infection. Traced individuals who
test negative the first time, are tested again after two days. The quarantine will result in a decreased
contact rate (i.e. imperfect isolation), Œªq , while in case of perfect isolation the contact rate is set
to zero. Similarly, diagnosed individuals will also be quarantined: at home (mild symptoms), with
a decreased contact rate Œªq , or in the hospital (severe symptoms), where we assume that perfect
isolation is possible. In all the considered scenarios, the 16% of individuals is isolated while the
rest is put in quarantine. The selected proportion reflects the proportion of severe cases reported
in Guan et al. 13

peak of which is reached within a few days after symptoms onset. The total length is modeled
as the convolution of incubation and symptomatic period. Incubation and symptomatic period,
are set, respectively, to have a mean length of 5¬∑2 days and 18 days. There is no precise estimate
of the length of the symptomatic period to date, thus we choose it according to the aggregated
nasal and throat swabs data. 7 The time to hospitalization is estimated from the data presented in
Backer et al. 10 We assume that the time to hospitalization coincides with the time of diagnosis. At
this time-point, depending on the severity of the symptoms, individuals are isolated (severe cases)
or quarantined (mild cases). The population size is set to 500 to represent a localised outbreak of
COVID-19. Furthermore, we assume that the contact tracing starts when individuals are diagnosed.

Antiviral compounds

To compensate for imperfect isolation we investigate the use of antiviral compounds to reduce the
infectiousness of an infected individual. We assume that, once the antiviral compound has been
administered, the infectiousness measure will exponentially decay according to an inverse Malthusian
growth model (shown in Figure 2). 17 The rate of this decay is set to represent the reduction in viral
load, due to Remdesevir, as reported in 4 for the MERS coronavirus.

Scenarios

We assume the following parameters for the reduction of contacts because of home quarantine: Œªq =
0¬∑1Œª, 0¬∑25Œª, 0¬∑5Œª and for the probability of tracing back a contact in history Hi : Œ∑ = 0¬∑25,0¬∑5,0¬∑75 18 .
Scenarios: In all the considered scenarios we assume that individuals are isolated, or quarantined,
when diagnosed. Moreover, we assume that contact tracing starts at the time of diagnosis.
IAS: Traced individuals are monitored for two weeks, and isolated/quarantined if they show symptoms during this period. This scenario is similar to the baseline scenario described by Hellewell
et al. 1 with the exception that in our description only severe cases are isolated while the mild
are home quarantined. This scenario reflects more realistically the current practice of containment.
IBS: Traced individuals are isolated/quarantined, as soon as they test positive for SARS-COV-2.
We assume that an individual that is infected tests positive 2 days after infection. Therefore,
a traced individual is tested immediately when traced, and, if this test was negative, we test
the individual again two days later.

IBTBS: A diagnosed patient is immediately treated with the antiviral drug. Furthermore, traced
individuals are isolated/quarantined and injected with the antiviral drug, as soon as they test
positive for SARS-COV-2. We assume that an individual that is infected tests positive 2 days
after infection. Therefore, a traced individual is tested immediately when traced, and, if this
test was negative, we test the individual again two days later.

For each scenario we run 5000 simulations. Among these, we compute the final size and the cases
at peak for the one in which at least the 10% of individuals have been infected. Doing this, we only
account for outbreaks that are most challenging to contain.

Results

Quarantine, isolation and antiviral treatments lead, in different levels, to the mitigation of the
outbreak by reducing the final size as well as by reducing the number of cases at the peak of
the epidemic. The containment performance depends, among all the scenarios, on the probability

Isolation and quarantine lead to a substantial decrease in final size and peak incidence. When
performed prior to symptom onset their efficacy increases, which is important, as recent work

Discussion

We assume that we have sufficient antiviral drugs doses to treat all individuals that are encountered
via the contact tracing procedure. This is motivated by the fact that we consider an emerging
outbreak and the required number of doses will thus be limited.
Furthermore, we assume that all the individuals will show symptoms, sooner or later, during their
infectious period, and therefore all infected individuals will be diagnosed. Due to the awareness of
COVID-19 given by media and government officials, individuals are more likely to act upon even
mild symptoms. This assumption is in line with the work of Hellewell et al. 1 Moreover, we assume
that all infected individuals will eventually be diagnosed. While this is a limitation of our study,
we argue that in the scenarios where we aggressively trace and treat the contacts of individuals,
we are more likely to find (and constrain) cases that would otherwise go undetected. To challenge
this assumption, we simulate the impact of asymptomatic individuals, defined to be infectives that
do not show symptoms during their infectious periods. Results reported in the sensitivity analysis
show that, for the tested scenarios, the use of an antiviral drug increases the control of the outbreak,
even when undiagnosed individuals are circulating in the population.
In the hospital, we assume perfect isolation, meaning that infected individuals cannot spread the
infection. While this assumption is in line with earlier works 1 , health care workers are at risk and
they could be infected by infected individuals in isolation.
In the IBS and IBTBS scenarios we assume that the traced individuals that test positive are isolated
in the 16% of cases, even before showing actual severe symptoms.
Although this model is informed with data on the control of MERS-CoV viral load using prophylaxis
with Remdesivir, it stands to reason that different classes of viral inhibitors control the viral load
in different ways. Additionally, despite the sequence similarity of MERS-CoV and SARS-COV-2 it

remains to be established whether the impact of Remdesivir (or other antivirals) on the viral load
is similar. To this end, longitudinal data of the viral load on COVID-19 infected patients treated
with different viral inhibitors will be informative. Furthermore, Sheahan et al. 4 demonstrated that
the degree of the clinical benefit of Remdesivir for MERS depends on the viral dose and also on
the timing of the treatment of the viral inhibitor. A lethal viral dose and delaying the initiation of
antiviral treatment failed to fully prevent viral pathogenesis. Although Remdesivir proved effective
at reducing the viral load also in these conditions, the argument for an early start of antiviral
treatment is evident. Presumably, reducing the viral load with an antiviral compound loses its
efficacy in advanced disease as the tissue damage is sustained by inflammatory processes in absence
of the viral initiator. In our implementation, antiviral injections are immediately administered to
successfully traced back individuals, mostly in their asymptomatic phase, and to the diagnosed
patient. Therefore, we believe that the assumptions on the use of this drug, in the considered
scenario, are reasonable.

Conclusion

The ongoing epidemic of COVID-19 threatens the health system of many countries. Although
control measures such as isolation and quarantine are of great importance, relying on their exclusive
use could fail to contain an outbreak. In addition, when a proportion of infected individuals requires
hospital care, the number of cases at peak should be minimized as much as possible to avoid
that regional health care infrastructure is overwhelmed. In the current study we highlight the
impact of an antiviral compound that reduces the viral load and, consequently, the infectiousness
of infectives. For this simulation study we utilized the data on the control of the viral load by
Remdesivir in a pathogen challenge experiment, however, this study can be easily extended to other
antivirals, given the availability of viral load data upon drug administration. Although the efficacy
of administering an antiviral compound, in addition to isolation and quarantine depends on the
effectiveness of the respective drug, it is plausible that drugs that interfere with the infection life
cycle show a comparable impact on the viral load. We demonstrate that the implementation of
such a compound together with quarantine leads to a substantial reduction of the final size and
the peak incidence. In addition, the number of outbreaks that are most challenging to contain
decreases when the antiviral is administered to diagnosed and traced individuals. Therefore, the
administration of an antiviral drug, together with isolation and quarantine, is expected to have
a major impact in the control of local COVID-19 outbreaks. Although antiviral compounds are
mostly evaluated in clinical trials for their capacity to control the disease manifestations and alter
the clinical outcome in individual patients, our study implies that antiviral compounds can be
implemented to alter the spread of a viral epidemic by influencing the viral load and infectiousness
of infectees upon quarantine. Additionally, it is expected that the implementation of such a strategy
during an epidemic outbreak might also prove effective to prevent hospitalisation and the pressure
on the health care capacity as these antiviral treatment is initiated earlier in the disease.
Currently, there remains a great deal of uncertainty with respect to the proportion of asymptomatic
infectees. Therefore, we performed a sensitivity analysis where we consider a proportion of 35%
asymptomatic individuals, which is in line with the findings of recent works. 20,21 . For this proportion
we consider a setting where the reproductive number between symptomatic and asymptomatic is
equal (Figure 9) and a setting where the asymptomatic infectees have a reproduction number that is
55% of the reproduction number set for symptomatic infectees (Figure 10). 20 For both settings, we
show a significant advantage with respect to the reduction of the final size and the peak incidence.
Yet, our analysis also shows that when the asymptomatic are as infectious as the symptomatic
infectees, it is important to have a high contact tracing success rate (Œ∑).
We remain hopeful that the ongoing clinical trials will reveal an antiviral compound that can be
used as a treatment and prophylaxis. Yet, our work shows that such compounds have an additional

We report in Figure 4 and 5 the sensitivity analysis for the quarantine contact rate: Œªq = 0.1Œª, 0.5Œª.
The introduction of an antiviral compound substantially contributes in reducing the final size, the
peak incidence and the probability of a challenging outbreak in all the considered settings. This
decrease, compared to the scenario in which only isolation/quarantine is implemented, increases
when quarantine is less effective (left panels). In Figure 6 and 7, we vary the reproduction number
that is set, respectively, to R0 = 2 and R0 = 3. The effect of the antiviral drug, in addition to
isolation and quarantine, increases when the reproduction number increases. In case of R0 = 3,
the peak incidence decreases when the antiviral compound is used, compared to control measures
based only on isolation and quarantine after symptoms onset.

In Figure 8 we investigate the effect of a longer time needed for the test to detect an infectious
individual.We assume the test is positive when performed on an infectious individual who has been
infected since at least 4 days. Simulations show a substantial increase, both in the final size and
the peak incidence for the IBS scenario. Instead, the use of an antiviral drug results also in this
case of remarkable impact in both the final size and the peak incidence.
We tested also the effect of an asymptomatic proportion of infectives. We assume that the 35%
of individuals will not show symptoms during their infectious periods, according to result reported
in recent studies. 20,21 We consider two values of the reproduction number for the asymptomatic
individuals. In Figure 9 asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals have the same reproduction

asymptomatic is set, respectively, to Rs0 =2¬∑5 and R0a =0¬∑55 R0s . 20 Also in these scenarios we noticed
that the administration of an antiviral drug lead to a substantial decrease in the final size and peak
incidence compared to the values obtained when the other control measures are considered.
