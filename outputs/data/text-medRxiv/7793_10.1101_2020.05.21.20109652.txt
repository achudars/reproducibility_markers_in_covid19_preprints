To the Editor:
In December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first
reported in people in Wuhan, China, and has rapidly spread throughout
the world [1]. As of August 11, 2020, 19,936,210 laboratory-confirmed
cases were reported. Furthermore, the World Health Organization re­
ported 732,499 fatalities [2]. The typical signs and symptoms of
COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, and fatigue. The virus is mainly trans­
mitted through respiratory droplets and by close contact with infected
individuals. Furthermore, about 2.78% of COVID-19 patients showed
symptoms of conjunctival congestion [3]. Thus, because the ocular
surface is always exposed to the environment, it may serve as a possible
site of virus entry and also as a source of contagious infection.
Studies have provided powerful evidence that angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the major cellular-entry receptor for
the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and higher ACE2 expression increases suscepti­
bility to SARS-CoV-2 [4]. Numerous studies, along with the typical
symptoms exhibited by COVID-19 patients [3,5], suggest that the
expression of the ACE2 gene may be a factor involved in the mode of
transmission of the virus. Recently, Collin et al. [6] and Zhou et al. [7]
reported that ACE2 was expressed in normal human adult conjunctival,
limbal and corneal epithelium, suggesting that ocular surface cells could
be susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2. These initial reports led us to
question whether and how the ACE2 gene is expressed in diseased
conjunctival tissues.
In the current study, we analysed both normal and diseased human
conjunctival tissue using RT-qPCR, Western blot, immunohistochem­
istry, and immunofluorescence in order to determine both expression
and localization of this key viral susceptibility factor in the human
conjunctival tissue. Sixty-eight subjects with a mean age of 47.42 ±
16.19 years [(32 males (47.06%); 36 females (52.94%)] were recruited
for the study, which included 10 subjects with conjunctival nevi, 20
subjects with conjunctivitis, 9 subjects with conjunctival papilloma, 16
subjects with conjunctival cyst, and 7 subjects with conjunctival polyps;
6 ocular traumas were used as normal control subjects. More informa­
tion related to materials and methods can be found in online supple­
mentary materials. All analyses were performed using the Statistical
Package for the Social Sciences software, version 13.0 (SPSS Inc.,

Chicago, IL, USA).
As presented in Fig. 1A and B, ACE2 mRNA and protein levels were
significantly overexpressed in conjunctival tissues of inflamed con­
junctiva, conjunctival nevi, conjunctival cyst, conjunctival papilloma,
and conjunctival polyps, as compared to normal conjunctival tissues (p
< 0.001). Furthermore, a significant difference in ACE2 mRNA and
protein levels between normal tissue and diseased conjunctival tissues
was observed (p < 0.001; Fig. 1A and B).
Two different antibodies, polyclonal rabbit anti-ACE2 antibody
(Fig. 1C) and monoclonal mouse anti-ACE2 antibody (Fig. 1D), were
used for immunohistochemistry. Notably, we observed the presence of
ACE2 in normal conjunctival epithelial cells (Fig. 1C③, Fig. 1D③).
Marked ACE2 immunostaining was also found in epithelial cells in tissue
samples from conjunctival polyps (Fig. 1C④, Fig. 1D④), conjunctival
papilloma (Fig. 1C⑤, Fig. 1D⑤), conjunctival cyst (Fig. 1C⑥,
Fig. 1D⑥), conjunctival nevi (Fig. 1C⑦, Fig. 1D⑦), and conjunctivitis
(Fig. 1C⑧, Fig. 1D⑧). Marked ACE2 immunofluorescence staining was
also found in samples from normal conjunctival tissue (Fig. 1E ),
conjunctival polyps (Fig. 1E②), conjunctival papilloma (Fig. 1E③),
conjunctival cyst (Fig. 1E④), conjunctival nevi (Fig. 1E⑤), and
conjunctivitis (Fig. 1E⑥). The levels of ACE2 staining were significantly
different between diseased and normal conjunctival epithelial cells.
A summary of the quantitative data is presented in Fig. 1F–H. Sig­
nificant differences in ACE2 expression between normal and diseased
conjunctival epithelial cells were observed (p < 0.05). Among diseased
conjunctival tissues, the level of ACE2 was significantly (p < 0.001)
lower in inflamed conjunctiva as compared to other diseased tissue. The
most significant finding was the surface expression of ACE2 in
conjunctival epithelial cells. Recently, Collin et al. [6] reported that
ACE2 was expressed in the human adult conjunctival, limbal and corneal
epithelium. Meanwhile, Zhou et al. [7] also found ocular surface
expression of ACE2 proteins across all human ocular specimens. Our
results confirm these reports, but go further in showing that ACE2 was
overexpressed in diseased tissue. Several respiratory viruses have been
shown capable of using the eye as both a site for replication and a port of
entry, which could result in a productive respiratory infection [8]. Peiris
JS et al. [9] reported that SARS-CoV can be transmitted either through

by RT-qPCR and Western blot assay. Polyclonal
rabbit anti-ACE2 antibody (C) and monoclonal
mouse anti-ACE2 antibody (D) were used in immu­
nohistochemistry. Negative controls used PBS
instead of primary antibodies (C , D ). The kidney

Expression of ACE2 was weakly positive in
conjunctivitis (C⑧, D⑧). The normal conjunctiva
consists of the epithelium (arrow) and stroma (tri­
angle). The stroma is located under the epithelium
and is a loose fibrous vascular tissue containing
accessory larcimal glands (star), lymphocytes and
nerves. Immunoreactivity is denoted by red staining

Granular ACE2 staining is present in the epithelium.
Strong staining is present in conjunctival polypus

direct or indirect contact with ocular mucous membranes. Collectively,
it is evident that the virus, via droplets, might be transmitted through
the human conjunctival epithelium.
Our study shows that ACE2 was significantly overexpressed in
diseased epithelial cells when compared to normal conjunctival
epithelial cells. Collin et al. [6] suggested that local inflammation can
enhance ACE2 expression, which may explain why ACE2 is expressed at
higher levels in diseased conjunctiva. Guangfa Wang, a member of the
national expert panel on pneumonia, was infected by the COVID-19
virus during an inspection in Wuhan. Wang complained of redness of
the eyes, which suggests that he was infected through the ocular surface
[10]. Xia J et al. [11] reported that conjunctival swab samples collected
from patients with conjunctivitis yielded positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR
results, whereas negative RT-qPCR results were obtained in patients
without conjunctivitis. One explanation for why patients with
conjunctivitis are more likely to exhibit positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels
is that conjunctivitis may have resulted from the active presence of
SARS-CoV-2. On the other hand, the subjects with conjunctivitis may
have had higher levels of ACE2, which may lead to a much stronger
susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Our results show that ACE2 is present in human conjunctival tissue,
especially in diseased conjunctival tissue. Collectively, the clinical fea­
tures of reported COVID-19 patients combined with our results indicate
that COVID-19 is likely to be transmissible through the conjunctiva. It is
easy to forget that conjunctivae are generally exposed to the environ­
ment. Thus, increasing the awareness of eye protection during COVID19 is necessary, especially for subjects with diseased conjunctivae.
