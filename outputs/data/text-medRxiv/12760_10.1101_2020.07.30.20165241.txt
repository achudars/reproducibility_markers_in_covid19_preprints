ABSTRACT (100 words)
The relationship of SARS-CoV-2 lung infection and severity of pulmonary disease is not fully
understood. We analyzed autopsy specimens from 24 patients who succumbed to SARS-CoV-2
infection using a combination of different RNA and protein analytical platforms to characterize
inter- and intra- patient heterogeneity of pulmonary virus infection. There was a spectrum of
high and low virus cases that was associated with duration of disease and activation of
interferon pathway genes. Using a digital spatial profiling platform, the virus corresponded to
distinct spatial expression of interferon response genes and immune checkpoint genes
demonstrating the intra-pulmonary heterogeneity of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

INTRODUCTION
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by the betacoronavirus severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)1. Although there has been significant
progress in understanding the factors involved with SARS-CoV-2 cellular infectivity, the
relationship of SARS-CoV-2 lung infection and severity of pulmonary disease manifestations is
not fully understood. Immune responses to viral infection have evolved to clear the pathogen,
and differences in these responses amongst patients is likely to affect clinical outcomes.
Autopsy series have revealed that the predominant pattern of lung injury in COVID-19 patients
is diffuse alveolar damage, characterized by hyaline membrane formation and in most cases, a
presumed healing phase of this lesion2. However, these studies are limited in their ability to
elucidate the complex immune response in SARS-CoV-2 pulmonary infection. An initial brief
report of single cell RNA-seq analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from 9 patients noted an
abundance of inflammatory monocyte-derived macrophages, lower CD8+ T cell infiltration, and
high cytokine levels (IL-8, IL-6 and IL-1β) in patients with severe COVID-193. This suggested
that macrophage driven responses and a “cytokine storm” were potentially preventing adequate
T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 in patients with severe disease. Another study of 3 patients that
focused on the peripheral blood response to SARS-CoV-2 found elevated IL-1 pathway
cytokines and subsequent decrease in peripheral T cells, potentially linking intrapulmonary
immune response with systemic changes4.

There have been a number of studies that have examined the blood based immune response to
SARS-CoV-2 infection5-7. Tissue based examination has the potential to provide a more
accurate assessment of SARS-CoV-2 related immune signatures, particularly if the immune
cells are restricted to the affected organs. The ability to visualize SARS-CoV-2 at a tissue level
provides unique information on the cell types infected by the virus and the spatial relationship of
infected cells with immune and non-immune cells in the microenvironment. This provides a

strategy to elucidate the roles of direct viral cytopathic effect and cellular injury from aberrant
immune reaction, both within the lung and at extra-pulmonary sites8,9. Herein, we examined
autopsy material from 24 COVID-19 patients collected at two institutions. The results
demonstrate heterogeneous levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA which correlate with duration of
disease and show a range of host immune response patterns as well as significant spatial
heterogeneity of both viral load and immune response.

RESULTS
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Human Lung Autopsy Tissue Associated with Duration of
Disease
A total of 20 patients at the Massachusetts General Hospital and 4 patients from Columbia
University Irving Medical Center (NYC) who succumbed from SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent
autopsy upon consent for clinical care. All patients were confirmed for SARS-CoV-2 infection
through qRT-PCR assays performed on nasopharyngeal swab specimens. Clinical summaries
of the 24 patients are listed in Supplementary Table 1. The mean age of this cohort was 62.5
years (range 32-89) with 14 males and 10 females. A total of 17 patients had medication
records available with 5/17 patients on immunosuppressive medications, including 3 patients on
corticosteroids. Most patients received hydroxychloroquine (13/17 = 76%), while none received
remdesivir.

Cases were evaluated with RNA in situ hybridization (RNA-ISH) using a SARS-CoV-2 RNA
specific probe targeting the S gene applied to multiple at least 2 different lobes of the lung and
selected extrapulmonary organs. RNA-ISH positive cases noted intracellular staining detectable
with a predominance in pneumocytes (Fig. 1a). Robust extracellular staining in hyaline
membranes was detectable in 11 of 23 cases (Fig. 1a). One sample (Case A) failed by RNA-

ISH due to sample quality. Preservation of RNA quality was confirmed by GAPDH RNA-ISH. A
similar pattern of reactivity was noted on an immunohistochemical stain for the SARS-CoV
nucleocapsid protein (Supplementary Fig. 1).

Based on a quantitative assessment of the RNA-ISH (high viral cases defined as ratio of area of
viral infected lung to total lung area ≥ 2%), 11 cases were classified as high viral RNA (Cases
1, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 15, 16, 18, C, D) while 12 cases were characterized as low viral RNA (Cases 2,
3, 4, 6, 10, 12, 13, 14, 17, 19, 20, B). High viral RNA correlated with extracellular viral RNA in a
hyaline membrane pattern (Chi square p=0.001; Fig. 1b).

The histological analysis of the tissue sections used for viral RNA-ISH revealed a mixed picture
with 5 cases showing only acute diffuse alveolar damage pattern of injury; in 9 patients the
acute injury was accompanied by interstitial and/or airspace organization. Two cases lacked
acute injury, instead showing only organizing-pattern injury. Low viral RNA correlated with
evidence of interstitial/airway organization (p=0.049). Of note, the two patients with the purely
organizing pattern of injury showed extremely low viral RNA (0% and 0.01%). Cases with low
viral RNA also showed higher numbers of Napsin A positive cells (p=0.02) and trend towards
higher keratin positive cells (p=0.08), supporting the repopulation of pneumocytes/bronchial
epithelial cells. Collectively, early pattern of lung injury (exudative diffuse alveolar damage)
correlated with high viral RNA while the presence of organization and intact pneumocytes
correlated with low viral RNA.

To validate the RNA-ISH data, we performed molecular confirmation through quantitative RTPCR (qRT-PCR)(Supplementary Fig. 2) and Total RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq)(Fig. 1c) for
Cases 1-11, Cases A-D, and 5 non-COVID-19 autopsy lung specimens (Negative Control).
There was concordance of orthogonal techniques of viral detection, although as expected, qRTPCR had the highest sensitivity of detecting SARS-CoV-2 in tissues (Supplementary Data1,
Supplementary Table 3). RNA-seq also identified negative sense viral reads in most specimens
with detectable virus indicating active viral replication in the lung (Supplementary Table 6).
Interestingly, antisense viral transcripts averaged 12.4% of total viral transcripts across all
samples with detectable viral transcripts. The sense percentage was higher in the viral high
cases, although this difference was not statically significant (mean 91.1% vs 81.6%; p=0.24).

Other organs examined in these cases including the heart, liver, jejunum, bowel, bone marrow,
adipose tissue, skin and kidney were negative for detectable SARS-CoV-2 by RNA-ISH
(Supplementary Data 1). Total RNA-seq detected viral RNA in two bowel samples (Cases 8 and
11). All other extrapulmonary samples were negative for SARS-CoV-2 by total RNA-seq. The
absence of detectable virus by RNA-ISH suggests that viral RNA detected in non-pulmonary
organs may represent viral RNA in blood, or that viral load is beneath the limit of detection by
ISH.

We then evaluated if RNA-ISH viral load were associated with clinical parameters in our cases
(Supplementary Table 1). Patients classified as high viral RNA showed a shorter duration of
disease (mean 7.2 days, SD 3.02) than patients with low viral load (mean 19 days, SD 4.9) (Fig.
1d; t-test p=0.0001). Additionally, patients classified as high viral RNA load had significantly
fewer days in the hospital (mean 3.6 days, SD 2.2) than patients with low viral load (mean 14
days, SD 7.9) (t-test p=0.003). These differences could be because of a higher proportion of
patients not receiving intubation and mechanical ventilation in the high viral RNA cases (4/9 vs

10/11, Fisher Exact p = 0.049). Although the limited number of cases precluded correlation with
parameters associated with a cytokine syndrome,10,11 all parameters, except for absolute
lymphocyte counts, showed higher numbers in low viral cases, although none of these were
statistically significant (Supplementary Table 2). There were no correlations between viral load
and age, gender or immunosuppression medication. Collectively, the data suggest a predictable
pattern of viral infection manifested histologically by prominent diffuse alveolar damage with
robust reactivity by RNA-ISH in the early phase and a shift towards organizing fibrosis with more
sparse reactivity by RNA-ISH in the later phase.

Significant Innate Immune Response in High SARS-CoV-2 Infected Lungs
We next investigated gene expression patterns in separate lobes of the lung (left lower lobe LLL, left upper lobe - LUL, right lower lobe - RLL, right middle lobe - RML, right upper lobe RUL) from SARS-CoV-2 cases using total RNA-seq. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of
samples for the 500 most variant genes demonstrated a separation of high viral RNA samples
from low viral RNA samples (Fig. 2a). Notably, there was separate clustering of high viral cases
(Cases 1, 8, 9, 11, C, D) and low viral cases (Cases 3, 4, 6, 10, B), but interestingly, there was a
separate cluster containing lung specimens from both high and low viral cases (Cases 2, 3, 5).
Cases 2 and 5 both had intermediate levels of virus when compared to other cases. In addition,
the left upper lobe in Case 7 was notable for having very high viral levels unlike the other 4
lobes that had low virus. Gene set enrichment analysis for genes that were different between
the three clusters (colored boxed Fig. 2a) was done to understand the host response
differences between these lung samples by viral load strata (Supplemental Data 2). The virus
high cluster had high expression of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) including IRF1, IFI44L,
IFIT3, and antiviral genes (OAS3, ADAR) with significant enrichment of interferon (IFN) pathway
gene sets including HALLMARK_INTERFERON_GAMMA_RESPONSE (FDR = 1.04E-24) and
HALLMARK_INTERFERON_ALPHA_RESPONSE (FDR = 1.43 E-21). High virus samples also

had enrichment of HALLMARK_EPITHELIAL_MESENCHYMAL_TRANSITION (FDR = 3.13E12) consistent with wound healing in these SARS-CoV-2 infected lungs. The mixed virus cluster
noted high expression of multiple collagen genes (COL1A1, COL1A2, COL3A1, COL4A1,
COL4A2, COL5A1, COL6A1, COL6A2, COL6A3) along with other genes enriched in
HALLMARK_EPITHELIAL_MESENCHYMAL_TRANSITION (FDR = 4.60 E-25) and
HALLMARK_MYOGENESIS (FDR = 5.53 E-09), alluding to continued wound healing and early
fibrosis. Both high and mixed virus clusters had genes elevated in HALLMARK_COAGULATION
(High virus cluster FDR = 2.19 E-10; Mixed virus cluster FDR = 1.46 E-06) with notable
increased expression of PECAM1 (CD31) and VWF, two well-known markers for endothelial
cells in this gene set, indicating potential implications on pulmonary vasculature and
coagulation. Low virus samples had notable elevated surfactant genes (SFTPB, SFTPC,
SFTPA1, SFTPA2), mucins (MUC2, MUC3A, MUC4, MUC5AC, MUC16), and keratins (KRT4,
KRT5, KRT6A, KRT13). These genes are enriched in epithelial cells and would suggest higher
proportion of airway and alveolar lining cells, as opposed to inflammatory cells, in low viral
lung specimens. Together, these findings indicate there is a spectrum of viral load not only
between patients, but also within the same patient that correlates with different transcriptional
profiles of the host response.

We then analyzed RNA-seq data based on patient lung viral load and not individual samples as
done with clustering. Using a cutoff of an average of 50 reads per million (RPM) of total viral
gene expression across lung samples, we separated patients into high and low virus that was
concordant with RNA-ISH results with the exception of Case 7, which again had one lung lobe
(LUL) having high expression levels of virus (pink star) and 3 additional lobes (RLL, RML, LLL)
that had detectable virus but below 50 RPM. Unbiased differential expression analysis (FDR <
0.01) identified 338 host genes that were higher in the high viral cases and 5710 genes higher
in the low viral cases (Supplemental Data 3). The genes expressed higher in high viral cases

gamma response genes (Fig. 2b). HALLMARK_EPITHELIAL_MESENCHYMAL_TRANSITION
(FDR = 3.90 E-14) and HALLMARK_COAGULATION (FDR = 2.54 E-08) were also enriched in
high versus low cases (Supplementary Fig. 3).

We next looked at factors shown to be potentially involved in SARS-CoV-2 infectivity including
TMPRSS2, ACE2, and CD147 (BSG)12,13. CD147/BSG had the highest mean expression (120.5
RPM) and ACE2 the lowest (4.2 RPM) with frequent undetectable levels in COVID-19 lung
samples (Fig. 3a). TMPRSS2 had moderate expression in all lung samples (mean 27.2 RPM),
and interestingly, was significantly lower in virus high compared to low samples (-1.72 Fold;
FDR 0.0036). Recent single cell RNA-seq work in normal lungs has shown low expression of
ACE2 and higher expression of TMPRSS2 in a subpopulation of pneumocytes, consistent with
our findings14. This difference may reflect selective destruction of TMPRSS2 positive
pneumocytes in high relative to low viral infections and repopulation by pneumocytes. Analysis
of immune cell and inflammatory markers15 by RNA-seq showed a predominance of
macrophage markers in all cases compared to other immune cells with markedly high
expression of CD163 (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 4). Analysis also showed markedly
increased expression of multiple MHC Class I related genes (HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, B2M,
TAP1) in viral high versus low cases, which is consistent with high interferon activity.

We validated our immune cell RNA-seq analysis with IHC and quantification of immune cell
types, which again showed very high numbers of CD163 positive cells in all samples (Fig. 3b
and c). There was a non-significant trend toward higher CD163 (p=0.07), CD3 (p=0.06), and
CD4 (p=0.14) in low viral cases. To determine if there were differences in the type of CD163
cells, we performed deconvolution of RNA-seq data (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 5), which
showed lower cellular fraction of uncommitted (M0) macrophages (p = 0.01) in low viral cases
and higher M1 polarized macrophages in high viral cases (p = 0.015). There was also a trend
towards M2 polarization seen in low viral cases (p = 0.07).

Intrapulmonary heterogeneity of immune response to SARS-CoV-2
Given our observation that individual patients demonstrated anatomical heterogeneity with
respect to histopathology and viral load, an in-depth assessment of the immune response within
infected airspaces was undertaken. This was accomplished by the viral RNA directed sampling
of paraffin embedded tissue sections using the GeoMxTM Digital Spatial Profiler (DSP)16 in 6
lobes from 5 patients. Quantitative analysis of RNA and protein in discreet regions of interest
(ROIs) was performed separately on SARS-CoV-2 viral positive and negative areas as identified
by RNA-ISH (Fig. 4a). Deconvolution of immune subsets using RNA expression profiles of each
ROI noted significant spatial heterogeneity of the immune response across cases (Fig. 4b).
Macrophages were more abundant in areas with SARS-CoV-2 virus present (red circles)
compared to non-viral areas (blue circles) in 4 of the 6 tissues with detectable virus. However,
Case 2-lung LUL with very low virus had regions of high macrophage infiltrate without
detectable virus. Interestingly, Case 1-lung LLL was very different from the other specimens
with high dendritic cells (DC), T-cells, NK cells, and to a lesser extent plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs)
in SARS-CoV-2 virus areas without monocyte or macrophage infiltrates. This contrasts the other
cases as well as Case 1-lung LUL, which highlights the disparate immune responses to SARSCoV-2 even within the same patient.

We then used an unbiased tSNE clustering of all ROIs and identified two distinct clusters (Fig.
4c). Cluster 1 included the majority of the RNA-ISH positive ROIs and a smaller proportion of
ISH negative ROI, while Cluster 2 included the majority of RNA-ISH negative ROI, control
SARS-CoV-2 negative lung samples, and a minority of RNA-ISH positive ROI. Differential
expression analysis between clusters noted high enrichment of ISGs (ISG15, IRF7, IRF9) in
Cluster 1. Other genes overexpressed in Cluster 1 were chemokine and cytokine related genes
(CCL15, CCL18, TNF, IL11RA, XCR1), the immune checkpoint protein PD-1 (PDCD1), and
cancer-related genes (SSX1 and MAGEA4). Consistent with the bulk RNA sequencing data,

unsupervised hierarchical clustering of ROIs using ISGs showed that SARS-CoV-2 positive
ROIs were highly enriched for IFN response (Fig 4e). This demonstrates that the IFN response
genes are preferentially expressed in regions of SARS-CoV-2 virus and not as a generalized
inflammatory response in lung. Moreover, we hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 negative ROIs in
Cluster 1 represent resolving viral clearance and that Cluster 2 potentially represents never
infected regions of lung or unresponsive lung regions with SARS-CoV-2 virus.

To determine if these changes are driven by specific samples, we performed differential
expression of ROIs within each lung sample and identified consistent commonly expressed
genes in each lung sample (Fig. 5a). Not surprisingly, the number of differentially expressed
genes within lung samples was driven by the amount of SARS-CoV-2 heterogeneity within
samples (i.e. Case 1 and 7 had more genes differentially expressed between SARS-CoV-2
positive vs. negative ROIs). Of the genes that were differentially expressed in multiple patients,
(Fig. 5b) the majority were again related to IFN response including gene expression of ISGs
(GBP1, IFITM1, IFI6) and MHC Class I (HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-F, B2M, TAP1). Analysis
of protein expression in these same samples (Fig. 5c) revealed elevated immune checkpoint
proteins in virus high ROIs including CTLA4 and PD-L1 in Case 1 and 7 lung samples. IDO1
protein was also elevated in these cases, which was also seen at the RNA level in both the
GeoMx DSP analysis (Fig. 5b) and in bulk RNA-seq as an IFN gamma response gene (Fig. 2b).
Similarly, PD-L1 protein was elevated in Cases 1 and 7 (Fig. 5c) with PD-L1 RNA expression
(CD274) elevated in Cluster 1 (Fig. 4e). IHC staining and whole slide quantification of PD-L1
and IDO1 in samples did not identify clear differences (Supplementary Fig. 6), which illustrates
the importance of analyzing ROIs to uncover intrapulmonary relationships between SARS-CoV2 and host response. Notably, IDO1 staining was predominantly found in endothelial cells,
which suggests a relationship between viral infection and changes in pulmonary vascular
response.

Finally, we attempted to dissect the intrapulmonary heterogeneity of the IFN response by
looking at different classes of IFN genes that were co-expressed with each other (Fig. 5d).
Genes that are secreted or associated with extracellular signaling molecules including CXCL9,
CXCL10, and IDO1 were expressed at much higher levels in SARS-CoV-2 positive ROIs
compared to other genes related to MHC Class I (HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-F, B2M) or
genes related to antiviral cellular response (IFI6, IFIT3, IFITM1). The high levels of IDO1
identified in endothelial cells by IHC (Supplementary Fig. 6) and the known expression of
CXCL9 and CXCL10 in endothelial cells suggests these differences may be related to local viral
effects on vasculature, but other cell types including monocytes/macrophages can be the
source of the expression of these genes. The spatial patterns in these IFN response genes
indicate that there are differences in local host response to the virus compared to the more
diffuse impact of IFN pathway activation in the lung. Altogether, there is clear intrapulmonary
heterogeneity of SARS-CoV-2 infection with a non-uniform IFN response by the immune system
with activation of immunoregulatory pathways (PD1/PD-L1, CTLA4, IDO1).

DISCUSSION
This study supports two phases of disease evolution in patients with severe COVID-19
pneumonia: 1) high viral RNA with abundant extracellular virus, and a histologic picture of
exudative diffuse alveolar damage, and 2) low (or undetectable) viral RNA, a mixed histologic
picture, but dominated by an organizing form of diffuse alveolar damage. The high viral cases
were associated with a shorter disease duration, high expression of IFN pathway genes, and
activation of wound healing and endothelial genes indicative of tissue damage and initiation of
fibrosis. Although these could represent two distinct disease phenotypes, we favor a model of
an early phase of the disease characterized by acute cellular injury, high viral load, and a robust
IFN response followed by a late form of disease associated with tissue organization on histology
and expression profiling, viral clearance, and a waning IFN response.

The IFN response is the primary early defense against viruses including SARS family of viruses.
Viral detection by various pathogen recognition mechanisms stimulates the production of type I
and type III IFN resulting in the expression of ISGs via the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. In
preclinical models, SARS-CoV-2 viral infection of human intestinal epithelial cells elicits a robust
IFN response that is efficient at controlling viral replication and de novo virus production17. The
current study demonstrates a more nuanced view of the expression of ISGs and ties their
expression with the presence of virus and duration of disease; notably, we were able to
document the association at the levels of individual air spaces. Collectively, the data suggest
the IFN response in SARS-CoV-2 correlated with clearance of the virus from the lung. While the
IFN gene signature characterize the patients with high viral load, there was no clear immune or
cytokine signature in patients with a low virus and in a later phase of the disease. Instead, in low
viral cases we find indication of resolution of wound healing, presence of M0 and M2
macrophages, and return of pulmonary epithelial cells.

Our results are consistent with recent data that suggests SARS-CoV-2 appears to be
responsive to IFN-I treatment in vitro and more sensitive than SARS-CoV18. Initial clinical data
with IFN beta-1b, lopinavir-ritonavir, and ribavirin has shown some promise with decreased time
to clearance of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal swab testing19. However, the results contrast
with recent efforts that show minimal amounts of IFNs in the peripheral blood of patients with
severe COVID-195,6. These two studies have suggested that type-I IFN deficiency in the blood
could be a hallmark of severe COVID-19, although neither study evaluated pulmonary tissue.
The presence of robust expression of numerous ISGs in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from
SARS-CoV-2 supports this hypothesis20. While the precise role of the IFN response and its
ability to clear virus remains an open question, our work underscores the possibility of a robust
IFN response in the majority of patients with severe COVID-19 infection and that these IFN
producing cells may remain localized to the lung. The study also highlights the challenges
associated with using blood as a surrogate to assess pulmonary disease in viral pneumonia,
and this is further compounded by the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of the virus and
corresponding immune response.

The use of the GeoMXTM digital spatial profiler has provided unprecedented spatial
transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of the intra-pulmonary heterogeneity of SARS-CoV-2
infection. Within individual lobes, infected airspaces with significant interferon response
pathway activation were juxtaposed to uninvolved lung tissue providing an opportunity to
understand regional variation in lung tissue response to the virus. This intra-patient
heterogeneity also extended to immune subsets, best exemplified in Case 1 in which a
prominent population of dendritic cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, NK, and T-cells in one lobe
was distinct from the more common monocyte/macrophage heavy infiltrate seen in another lobe
of the same patient. Analysis of virus high ROIs across all cases showed significant interferon

response gene expression compared to virus low ROIs, but we note there were two outlier
genes SSX1 and CCL15 that were very high in virus high ROIs. SSX1 is known mostly as a
partner of the SS18-SSX1 translocation commonly found in synovial sarcoma, and interestingly,
has been found to be upstream of SHCBP1 expression21, a gene involved with paramyxovirus
viral replication and suppression of the interferon response 22,23. This suggests that SSX1 may
be induced by SARS-CoV-2 as an adaptive response to interferon, but further mechanistic
studies will be needed to evaluate this hypothesis. CCL15, also known as leukotactin-1, is
highly expressed in M1 compared to M2 macrophages24 and is a chemokine involved with
chemotaxis of neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes 25. The presence of higher M1
macrophages in SARS-CoV-2 high cases would indicate that CCL15 is important in the immune
response to the virus. Our analysis of proteins enriched in high virus ROIs revealed enriched
expression of multiple immune checkpoint molecules including CTLA4, PD-L1, and IDO1, which
supports an immune microenvironment that is inhibitory to T-cell activation. Prior studies have
reported T cell exhaustion or increased expression of inhibitory receptors on peripheral blood T
cells of COVID-19 patients supporting these findings of T-cell suppression7,26,27.

Determining the phase of the disease in the lungs, specifically the peak and nadir, may have
therapeutic implications. Given the clear interferon response to the virus in early infection,
immunosuppressive therapy would potentially be most effective in the decelerating viral load
phase of the disease. A recent preliminary report of dexamethasone use in COVID-19 patients
demonstrated an improvement of 28-day mortality among those who were receiving either
invasive mechanical ventilation or oxygen alone but not among those receiving no respiratory
support28. Notably, dexamethasone was associated with a reduction in 28-day mortality among
those with symptoms for more than 7 days but not among those with a more recent symptom
onset, findings consistent with high viral load in the early phase of the disease. Our data also
supports the likely greater benefit of antiviral therapy such as remdesivir in the early phase of

the disease given high viral levels associated with diffuse alveolar damage. The data also raise
the provocative hypothesis that many patients clear SARS-CoV-2 within two weeks of the onset
of the disease, largely driven by a robust IFN response. However, the small, but detectable
presence of virus RNA in low viral cases would indicate potential continued benefit of antivirals
in later stages of the disease. The presence of T-cell inhibitory molecules (CTLA4, PD-L1,
IDO1) in high virus cases also suggests that immune checkpoint inhibitors could have a role in
patients with ineffective immune response, though this is highly speculative. The RNA-ISH and
qRT-PCR assay could potentially be performed as complementary diagnostics on
bronchoalveolar lavage samples to distinguish the two phases of the disease as well as
discriminate active infection from asymptomatic carrier with another pulmonary process.
However, one notable caveat is the heterogeneity in viral load, necessitating that multiple lobes
must be sampled.

In summary, detailed molecular analysis of multiple lung lobes from patients with severe
COVID-19 infection highlights two phases in patients who succumb to the disease. While antiviral agents are likely to be most beneficial earlier in the disease, the timing and type of immune
modulation, activating or inhibiting, must be carefully considered given the heterogeneous
immune responses observed in these patients. Our findings highlight the importance in serially
assessing tissue pulmonary SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels and the immune response as well as
attempt to identify corresponding surrogate markers in the blood, although the heterogeneity in
the viral load and immune response across the lobes of the lung may prove a challenge.
Additional mechanistic and biomarker driven studies of SARS-CoV-2 are needed to optimize
patient selection and the timing of treatment administration to address this inherent spectrum of
COVID-19 presentation. The current work provides the foundation to evaluate a larger series of
autopsies characterizing the spatiotemporal relationship of viral load and host microenvironment

METHODS
Immunohistochemistry and RNA-ISH
Analysis of patient autopsy material was reviewed and approved by the Partners Human
Research IRB (Protocol #: 2020P001001). Autopsy consent was per clinical care as directed by
the patient or health care proxy. We evaluated hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained sections
from FFPE tissue from the lungs, heart, liver, intestine, bone marrow, adipose tissue and
kidney. We performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) for CD3, CD8, CD20, CD163, CD123,
IDO1, PD-L1, Napsin A, keratin and SARS-CoV N protein on an immunohistochemical platform.
RNA-ISH was performed on FFPE sections using a SARS-CoV-2 RNA specific probe on an
automated Leica BOND RX (RNAscope 2.5 LS Probe V-nCoV2019-S, #848568, and
RNAscope 2.5 LS Reagent Kit-RED, #322150; Advanced Cell Diagnostics). Slides were imaged
using a Leica Aperio CS-O slide scanning microscope at 40x magnification. Image
quantification was performed using Halo software (Indica Labs). Tissue regions of interest were
annotated by hand, excluding any folds or debris. The Multiplex IHC module was used to

ng of RNA input was used per reaction. 1-step qRT PCR was performed with the GoTaq Probe
1-Step RT-qPCR kit (A6120, Promega) using the CDC-approved 2019-nCoV RUO primer-probe
kit (10006713, IDT). For Total RNA-sequencing, The Smarter Stranded Total RNA-Seq kit v2
(634413, Illumina) was used with 10 ng RNA input, according to the manufacturer instructions to
generate libraries. Dual-indexed pooled libraries were sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq 500
platform using a 150 cycles kit with paired end read mode. For RNA expression analysis, the
initial quality control of sequencing data was carried out using the tool FASTQC and alignment
of sequencing reads to the reference genome was carried out using STAR aligner, version 2.7
29.

We used the genome annotation and GTF for SARS-CoV-2 available on NCBI. A joint

annotation was created by adding the COVID19 genome to the HG38 genome sequence and
the GTF sequence. A new index for STAR aligner was created using this new annotation. Post
alignment using this new annotation, the duplicate reads were marked using PICARD and
removed using SAMtools. The resulting BAM files were used to quantify the read counts per
gene using HTSeq-count program. The downstream analysis was carried out in the R statistical
programming language including hierarchical clustering. The DESeq2 package 30 was used for
differential expression analysis between samples. Cell type deconvolution from gene expression
was performed using CIBERSORTx31 using the LM22 signature matrix and batch correction for
bulk sorted reference profiles. Plots were made using the heatmap.2 function in the gplots
package in R. All RNA-seq data has been uploaded to NCBI GEO GSE150316.

GeoMx DSP for protein profiling
Autopsy tissues from COVID-19 infected patents were processed following the GeoMx DSP
slide prep user manual (MAN-10087-04). Autopsy FFPE slides were baked in oven at 60°C for
at least 1 hour, and then rehydrated and blocked by Nanostring block buffer for 1 hour. CD68594 (Novus Bio, NBP2-34736AF647), CD45-647 (Novus Bio, NBP2-34527AF647), and PanCK488 (eBioscience, 53-9003-82) were added on the sections along with the Nanostring protein

cocktail for overnight incubation. The slides were washed and stained with Syto83
(ThermoFisher, S11364) on the next day. 20X fluorescent images were scanned after loading
the slides to GeoMx machine. Regions of interest (ROIs) in Alveoli were selected in both
COVID19 high and COVID19 low regions based on the COVID-19 ISH staining in the serial
section. Oligos from antibodies were cleaved and collected into 96-well plates. Then these
oligos were hybridized with NanoString barcodes overnight and read with an nCounter machine.
Digital accounts of each antibody in each ROI were generated for data analysis.

GeoMx DSP for CTA profiling
Autopsy FFPE tissues from COVID-19 infected patents were processed following the GeoMx
DSP slide prep user manual (MAN-10087-04). Autopsy slides were baked in oven at 60°C for at
least 1 hour, and then deparaffinized and hydrated by Leica Biosystems BOND RX. Proteinase
K was added prior to the incubation of incubated with RNA probe mix (CTA and COVID-19
spike-in panel). After overnight incubation, slides were washed with buffer and stained with
CD68-594 (Novus Bio, NBP2-34736AF647), CD45-647 (Novus Bio, NBP2-34527AF647), and
PanCK-488 (eBioscience, 53-9003-82) and Syto83 (ThermoFisher, S11364) for 1 hour, and
loaded to the GeoMx DSP machine to scan 20X fluorescent images. Regions of interest (ROIs)
were placed by aligning to the ROIs placed during protein profiling. Oligos were cleaved and
collected into 96-well plates. Oligos from each AOI was uniquely indexed using Illumina’s i5 x i7
dual-indexing system. 4 uL of a GeoMx DSP sample was used in the PCR reaction. PCR
reactions were purified with two rounds of AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) at 1.2x beadto-sample ratio. Libraries were paired-end sequenced (2x75) on a NextSeq550 up to 400M total
aligned reads. Fastq files were further process by DND system and raw and Q3 normalized
counts of all CTA targets in each AOI were obtained through Nanostring Azorius program.

Spatial Transcriptomics Analysis
Analysis of GeoMx protein data
Per manufacturer’s recommendations, the data was normalized by scaling to the negative
control IgG probes, which reflect the rate at which antibodies bind to each region. The Ms IgG2a
probe was excluded from this calculation due to poor concordance with the other IgGs. 6 ROIs
were removed due to low signal. 10 proteins were excluded from analysis due to lack of abovebackground signal. For each tissue and each protein, differential expression vs. SARS-CoV-2
presence/absence was evaluated with an unpaired, heteroscedastic t-test of the protein’s log2transformed normalized data.

GeoMx RNA data normalization
Probes for each gene were screened for outliers and their raw counts collapsed to a single
estimate of counts using their geometric mean. Each ROI’s data was scaled to have the same
75th percentile.

Estimation of background in GeoMx RNA data
For each data point (gene x ROI), the expected background was estimated as the geometric
mean of the negative control probes from the appropriate probe pool (CTA or COVID-19 spikein) within the ROI in question. These expected background values were used as an input in
mixed cell deconvolution and for background-subtraction in the plot of spatially-resolved
expression.

Deconvolution of cell proportions from GeoMx RNA data
Cell mixing proportions were estimated using the SpatialDecon R library, which performs
mixture deconvolution using constrained log-normal regression. The algorithm was run using a

cell profile matrix derived from the Human Cell Atlas adult lung 10X dataset and appended with
a neutrophil profile derived from snRNA-seq of lung tumors32. The neutrophil profile was scaled
to have the same 75th percentile expression value as the average cell type’s profile in the
Human Cell Atlas lung dataset.

Differential Expression Analysis of GeoMx RNA data
Only genes that rose 2-fold above background in at least one ROI were considered. For each
tissue and each gene, differential expression vs. SARS-CoV-2 presence/absence was
evaluated with an unpaired, heteroscedastic t-test of the gene’s log2-transformed normalized
data. For analysis of expression within tissues, genes were defined as consistently up-regulated
if they 1. had a log2 fold-change > 0.2 and a Benjamini-Hochberg FDR < 0.1 in at least 2
tissues, and 2. never had a log2 fold-change < 0 and a Benjamini-Hochberg FDR < 0.1 in any
tissue. Genes were defined as consistently down-regulated by an equivalent rule.

For analysis across patient samples, expression was modeled using linear mixed effect models
allowing for random slope and intercept terms per patient sample. P-values were estimated
using Satterthwaite's method for approximation, and adjusting using the Benjamini-Hochberg
FDR.
