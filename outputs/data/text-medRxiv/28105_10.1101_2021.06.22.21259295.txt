Abstract:

22

With more than 140 million people infected globally and 3 million deaths, the COVID 19 pandemic has

23

left a lasting impact. A modern response to a pandemic of such proportions needs to focus on exploiting

24

all available data to inform the response in real-time and allow evidence-based decision-making. The

25

intermittent lockdowns in the last 13 months have created economic adversity to prevent anticipated

26

large-scale mortality and relax the lockdowns have been an attempt at recovering and balancing economic

27

needs and public health realities. This article is a comprehensive case study of the outbreak in the city

28

limits of Pune, Maharashtra, India, to understand the evolution of the disease and transmission dynamics

29

starting from the first case on March 9, 2020. A unique collaborative effort between the Pune Municipal

30

Corporation (PMC), a government entity, and the Pune knowledge Cluster (PKC) allowed us to layout a

31

context for outbreak response and intervention.

32

metropolitan city with pockets of very high-density populations will help analyze, in real-time, the

33

dynamics of the pandemic and forecasts for better management and control of SARS-CoV-2. Outbreak

34

data analytics resulted in a real-time data visualization dashboard for accurate information dissemination

35

for public access on the epidemic's progress. As government agencies craft testing and vaccination

36

policies and implement intervention strategies to mitigate a second wave, our case study underscores the

37

criticality of data quality and analytics to decode community transmission of COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION

42

Following a cluster of pneumonia cases recorded in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, caused by a novel

43

coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (1, 2), COVID-19 subsequently spread to other cities and countries (3, 4).

44

India tops the charts of people at risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection exceeding 1.4 billion cases. The first

45

documented case in India was from an Indian national evacuated from China on January 30, 2020. Pune, a

46

city with about 5 million population (5), recorded its first case on March 9, 2020, with a national flying

47

from Dubai. Severe public health measures were implemented in Pune and across India to prevent the

48

spreading of the outbreak, including a complete lockdown starting from March 25 and dragging on for a

49

little more than two months into the beginning of June 2020 (6). At the end of April 2021, Pune recorded

50

a staggering >400,000 cases (7). Surveillance and contact tracing are critical components of effective

51

public health response to COVID-19 as has been showcased worldwide, including two states of the Indian

52

Subcontinent, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh (6).

53

In response to public health crises such as this pandemic, healthcare preparedness, rapid action from local

54

authorities for procuring essential supplies, and appropriate resource allocation require projecting the

55

trajectory of cases for coming weeks and months. Real-time advanced data analytics and computational

56

modeling using granular data are central to such an exercise (8-11). The Pune Knowledge Cluster (PKC),

57

a consortium of Pune-based scientists, engineers, technologists, academicians, students that believed in

58

the power of data science analytics and modeling to curb the spread of the disease, collaborated with Pune

59

Municipal Corporation (PMC) to provide data-driven management of the pandemic. Here, we present a

60

perspective of the PMC-PKC collaborative efforts that include centralized data abstraction, curation,

61

analysis, data visualization, and modeling of the early COVID-19 data to project the pandemic curve that

62

directed policy decisions on resource procurements and allocation (12).

ANALYTIC APPROACH

66

Data Sources

67

Case data from the PMC included a description of reported cases gathered inline lists, i.e., flat files where

68

each row is a case and each column a recorded variable (e.g., dates of onset and admission, gender, age,

69

location). This data was extensively curated using a combination of manual input and state-of-the-art data

70

science tools to fulfill the definition of 'tidy data' in the data science community (13). Regional level

71

demographic information (example. age stratification, sex, residential addresses, maps of population

72

densities) was collected independently from the smart city public data portal to delineate the underlying

73

characteristics of the affected populations. Our primary data was obtained directly from the Pune

74

Municipal Corporation and official press releases as part of an effort to build an epidemiological

75

surveillance dashboard for Pune city (7). The details of the number of records and the duration for which

76

they are available is present in Supplementary Table 1.

77

Geocoding Methodology

78

Due to the unstructured nature of addresses in India, assigning an address to a geographical location is a

79

challenging task (14). To understand the spatial evolution of the pandemic within PMC limits, we

80

developed a machine learning model that processed addresses of each record and assigned each address to

81

a prabhag, an administrative unit in PMC. To train the model, we used a database of 48000 addresses

82

which experts had manually assigned in PMC to their respective prabhags. We used 80 percent of the data

83

for training and 20 percent for validation.

84

We first created a database of localities around Pune, which were then assigned to their respective

85

prabhags to eliminate the addresses' most "noisy" parts. We first simplified and normalized the addresses

86

using the following rules. The address was tokenized into individual words. All "small" words -- tokens

87

of length lesser than 3, were discarded. Minimal replacement of abbreviations was done. For example:
4

88

Soc -> Society, Apt -> Apartment etc. All non-alphabets are eliminated. Fuzzy matching (15) was used to

89

replace identified tokens (1 and/or 2-grams) with a standardized form. For example, yerwada, yerawada,

90

yerwada were all mapped to yerawada. Compound words were replaced by concatenated versions (e.g.,

91

Laxmi Nagar replaced by Laxminagar). These addresses were converted to a vector using a term

92

frequency vectorizer. To emphasize certain unique localities within a prabhag, their frequency was

93

multiplied by three. In the term frequency vectorization, we omit those tokens which rarely appear in the

94

dataset. The threshold was chosen based on when the number of tokens on either side of the threshold is

95

dramatically different. The threshold identified was 0.00003, which gives us a vocabulary of ~5000

96

tokens. If the threshold was changed to 0.00004 and higher, the size of the vocabulary changes

97

proportionally. However, if the threshold was decreased to 0.00002, the vocabulary more than doubles to

98

~12000 tokens, indicating the presence of a large number of rare, "noisy" tokens.

99

Classification and Validation

100

The resulting address vectors were used to train a variety of classifiers. On examining their performance,

101

we observed that the multinomial Naive Bayes classifier provided better performance in certain prabhags

102

than tree-based classifiers (Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost). Thus, an ensemble architecture was

103

chosen for the classifier. We used an ensemble of Multinomial Naive Bayes, XGBoost, and Random

104

Forest classifiers with a Decision Tree classifier acting as a meta-classifier. With this architecture, we

105

achieved an accuracy of 87%. Hyperparameters for Random Forest and XGBoost were chosen to reduce

106

overfitting. The accuracy on the training set was ~91.5%, indicating slight overfitting. We also performed

107

10-fold cross-validation, which showed minimal variability in the accuracy, suggesting that the model

108

was robust.

109

Outbreak Analytics: An Overview

110

Data type priorities were critically defined by what actionable information can be predicted for use in

111

ground-level decision-making during the pandemic. As seen worldwide, the resultant outputs of the

112

outbreak data analytics for Pune were limited due to operational constraints suggesting an urgent need for

113

resources and capacities to ensure data availability and quality. The aspects of outbreak analytics (Figure

114

1) allowed a systematic understanding of the situation in Pune. 'Outbreak analytics' in this article refers to

115

several tools and methods used to collect, curate, visualize, analyze, model Pune pandemic data. An

116

integrated workflow represented describing the tools and their cross-talk are summarized below.

117

Tracking the epidemic curve

118

The first type of graphics needed for rapid assessment of ongoing dynamics is the epidemic curve (epi

119

curve), which shows case incidence time series as a histogram of new-onset dates for a given time interval

120

(16). Figure 2a shows the trend of cumulative cases ward-wise in Pune and their outcomes. Cumulative

121

cases, the fraction of active cases, i.e., the ratio of active cases and total cases, is another suitable

122

parameter to understand the state of the epidemic. In the beginning, when all cases are active, it will start

123

from unity, and at the end of the epidemic, when all the cases are resolved, then this will become zero.

124

Thus, this curve can vary between one and zero, and if it shows a decline, it implies that the epidemic is

125

fading out. Note that when there are multiple waves, then this curve will be oscillatory.

126

Geo-mapping of epidemics

127

Maps have been at the core of infectious disease epidemiology from a very early stage. They can be

128

typically used to visualize the distribution of disease, represent the 'ecological niche' of infectious diseases

129

at large scales, assess an outbreak's spatial dynamics, and strategize interventions (17). The changing

130

scenario month-wise for Pune is delineated through a scale that allows understanding geographical spread

131

(Figure 3). The changing geography indicates the spread of the disease from a highly infected ward with

132

primary infection to adjacent wards.

133

Trend in test positivity and transmissibility assessment.

134

The identification of infected cases in the population is dependent on the testing for the disease. The

135

number of tests done in phase I of the epidemic was low and indicated that it was mainly used as a

136

diagnostic for symptomatic people. Figure 2b illustrates the test positivity rates, which declined over

137

time, indicating an increase in the number of tests. The 'transmissibility' of a disease can be quantified and

138

used to refer to the rate at which new cases arise in the population, resulting either in epidemic growth or

139

decline. Rather than an intrinsic property of a specific disease, transmissibility thus quantifies the

140

propagation of a pathogen in a given epidemic setting and is impacted by multiple factors, including

141

population demographics, mixing, and levels of pre-existing immunity. The first measure of

142

transmissibility is the growth rate (r), which is estimated from a simple model where case incidence is

143

either exponentially growing (r. 0) or declining (r, 0). Typically, r is estimated directly from epicurves

144

using a log-linear model, where r is defined as the slope of linear regression on log-transformed

145

incidence.

146

Figure 2c shows test and case doubling time throughout the pandemic so far. While r quantifies the speed

147

at which a disease spreads, it does not contain information on the intervention level necessary to control

148

the disease. This is better characterized by the reproduction number (generically noted 'R'), which

149

measures the average number of secondary cases caused by each primary case. Researchers typically

150

distinguish the basic reproduction number (R0), which applies in a large, fully susceptible population,

151

without any control measures, from the effective reproduction number (Reff), which is the number of

152

secondary cases after accounting for behavioral changes, interventions, and declines in susceptibility.

153

Different methodological approaches have been developed to estimate the reproduction number. To

154

estimate Reff, we used the Bayesian approach developed by Bettencourt and Ribeiro, and modified by K.

155

Systrom (18, 19).

156

R can be approximated using estimates of the growth rate r combined with knowledge of the generation

157

time distribution. A more reliable method is to derive R(t) from compartmental models. Figure 2d

158

represents the change in R0 values ward-wise over time. The prevalence of the disease can be calculated

159

through understanding IFR as opposed to CFR. This can be calculated by serological testing to detect the

160

%age population infected. A serosurvey with five prabhags done in the July-August 2020 time frame is

161

discussed here in connection with the cases detected and case fatality ratios.

162

Tracking Case Fatality Rates

163

Mortality in infectious diseases has a lag defined by the time interval between case detection and

164

outcome. The outcome can be represented as death or recovery. Figure 2e shows the overall cumulative

165

deaths. The case fatality ratios go up during phase 1 and early part of phase 2 of the epidemic, while the

166

case fatality rates (CFR) are coming down with time. CFR calculations calculated from publicly available

167

data face lag between the date of admission of patients and the date of death. Accounting for this lag is a

168

major source of uncertainty in CFR calculations. Due to the availability of date of isolation in the data

169

made available by PMC, we have calculated CFR, which reduces this uncertainty significantly, and

170

allows for a cohort-based (i.e., all people who were isolated in the same period) calculation of CFR.

171

Calculating CFR based on the date of isolation also allowed us to compute a "real-time" CFR which

172

accounts for currently active cases.

173

Dashboard and real-time visualization of data

174

In order to disseminate information about the pandemic state, an online dashboard was created and

175

operated by the team depicting the trajectories of the epidemic (7). Dashboard depicts various quantities

176

and figures developed by the team members such as daily and active number of cases as well as tests,

177

real-time effective reproduction rate (R(t)), case doubling time, test doubling time, active fractions,

178

cumulative test positivity, CFR and the forecasting. Such quantities were made available for the entire

179

city; whenever possible, more granular data based on wards and sub-wards (Prabhags) was also shown.

180

An example plot of the dashboard is shown in Figure 4.

181

Forecasting

182

Forecasting plays a vital role in policymaking by offering reasonable estimates of the upcoming burden

183

on health infrastructure. We used the state-of-the-art INDSCI-SIM model, an extended SEIR model (20,

184

21) that employs a nine-compartmental description of an epidemic, tailored specifically to COVID-19.

185

Because INDSCI-SIM supports various non-pharmaceutical interventions, one can utilize the model to

186

nd
incorporate the effects of multiple measures such as lockdown, adherence to masks, social distancing, and

187

quarantining. For forecasting, we chose the number of patients in critical condition for two primary

188

reasons: 1) this data is less prone to errors of underreporting as hospitals typically test all the critical care

189

patients for COVID-19 and 2) this number directly affects the resource requirements to be made by the

190

municipal corporation. Our first forecast was made in June 2020, which was subsequently updated after

191

the second lockdown in July. The resulting forecast was made available on an online dashboard until the

192

end of the year. The reported cases were added every day as shown in Figure 5 that shows a worst-case

193

and a best-case scenario.

194

How much should we test?

195

The way to control the infection is to increase the number of tests. However, can we quantify how much

196

should be good enough? We proposed that if the time doubling value of the test is lower than that of the

197

time doubling the value of infection, it is possible to test a larger population beyond just symptomatic

198

people and their contacts. In the worst-case scenario, the two-time doubling values should be at least the

199

same. This was done when PMC ramped up their tests from about 700-800 per day at the end of May to

200

approximately 2500 in mid-June. Was that enough?

201

Like the time doubling of cases, we can define the time doubling of tests as

202
203

To -- the cumulative number of tests on June 16 = 76206.

204

td-- time doubling value

205

T(t)-- Cumulative number of tests on a day starting from June 16.

206

We projected values of tests required to bring down the test doubling time (td). Note that the case

207

doubling time during that period was varying between 22-28 days. The projected tests required for

208

re
keeping the td value at a certain number over the next 19 days are given in the table. These numbers were

209

much higher than the number of tests done per day. This projection gave an idea to PMC about the

210

requirement of an increase in the number of tests per day (Supplementary Table 2).

211
212

Estimation of undetected cases and distribution of the test using CFR

213

We asked here, if we have a limited number of tests how do we distribute across the wards? For this, we

take the help of the ward wise CFR

229

The test positivity (TP) is defined as the ratio between the total number of positive outcomes(P) and the

230

total number of tests (T) that may represent the testing efficacy. In an ideal case, as the number of tests is

231

increased, this parameter should decrease or remain constant at a very low value, suggesting uniform

232

testing and can indicate that the testing is neither targeted nor the disease is exploding undetected. High

233

values of TP could imply the testing is targeted; that is, most tests are done only for the symptomatic

234

patients and their contacts, enhancing the TP values artificially. A potential drawback of high TP numbers

235

is the distinct possibility of a lower number of tests performed and, more crucially, missing out on

236

potentially infective yet asymptomatic sections of the population, leading to a silent explosion of the

237

disease without detection. On the other hand, a small TP value could imply higher random testing or, in

238

the best cases, more expansive and successful testing of the population through intense contact tracing.

239

Given the large population and limited testing capabilities, a correct balance has to be struck between

240

these two approaches: intensive and focused only target testing and ineffective and unplanned random

241

testing. Thus, apart from CFR, we need to keep track of the TP. We plotted the ward-wise CFR

242

(Supplementary Figure 1). Depending on the high and low values of CFR and TP, the values can be in

243

the four-quadrant. We discuss below what each of the quadrants means and how the testing strategy can

244

be modified.

245

a) Low CFR and Low TP- Low TP implies that there is not much sampling error and that the

246

number of detected cases is close to the actual cases. When combined with low CFR values, it

247

can be deduced that wards that come under this category have implemented good testing

248

strategies covering most of the population. As long as the wards manage to stay in this quadrant,

249

they can be expected to bring down the number of cases using the same strategy.

250
251

b) High CFR and High TP- This quadrant implies that testing is too targeted, and thus the sampling
efficiency is poor. The actual number of cases is many-fold higher than the detected ones.

252

c) Low CFR and High TP- This combination suggests that though the testing is targeted, the number

253

of actual cases is likely to be close to the number of detected cases. The wards in this quadrant

254

might have mixed features in terms of rate and number of cases. However, the targeted testing

255

strategy seems to be working for these wards, and as long as they can keep the CFR low, they can

256

follow the current testing strategy. Increasing values of CFR for these wards are an early

257

signature of community spread. The ward should immediately ramp up the number of tests and

258

change the strategy to include random testing over a larger population.

259

d) High CFR and Low TPR: Though low values of TP alone can indicate a wider testing strategy

260

spread over a larger population when considering the high values of CFR, the conclusion about

261

the testing strategy becomes flawed. The actual cases are much larger for the ward belonging to

262

this most undesirable quadrant than the detected ones. The wards with these values of TP and

263

CFR need to ramp up their testing strategy by many folds and must include random testing over a

264

larger population.

SUMMARY

267

In this report, we summarize the Pune Knowledge Cluster consortium activities that included real-time

268

data visualization for identifications of hotspots, provision of a snapshot of outbreak trends, and

269

forecasting of the epidemic over the next several months (7, 22). Our case study on the outbreak analytics

270

and modeling the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Pune city, India, provides a feasible and scalable

271

proof-of-concept to facilitate recommendations for public health policies to local officials and help

272

forecast outbreaks.
