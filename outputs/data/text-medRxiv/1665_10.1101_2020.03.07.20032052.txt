Abstract

16

The rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) raises concern about a global

17

pandemic. Knowledge about the duration of viral shedding remains important for patient

18

management and infection control. We report the duration of viral detection in throat and rectum

19

of a COVID-19 patient treated at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Ho Chi Minh City,

20

Vietnam. Despite clinical recovery, SARS-CoV-2 RNA remained detectable by real time RT-

21

PCR in throat and rectal swabs until day 11 and 18 of hospitalization, respectively. Because live

22

SARS-CoV-2 has been successfully isolated from a stool sample from a COVID-19 patient in

23

China, the results demonstrate that COVID-19 patients may remain infectious for long periods,

24

and fecal-oral transmission may be possible. Therefore, our finding has important implications

25

for infection control.

26

The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its

27

current global spread have prompted the World Health Organization to declare a Public Health

28

Emergency of International Concern. We report the duration of viral detection in throat and

29

rectal swabs taken from a patient treated at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases (HTD) in Ho Chi

30

Minh City, Vietnam. HTD is a referral hospital responsible for receiving and treating patients

31

with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from southern Vietnam with a population of >40

32

million.

33

On January 31, 2020, a 73-year-old man with a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia was

34

admitted to HTD with dry cough and breathing difficulties, but without fever. He had become ill

35

with respiratory symptoms on January 26, 2020, ten days after arrival in Vietnam from the

36

United States. Whilst travelling to Vietnam, he had two hours of transit at an airport in Wuhan,

37

China.

38

Blood tests on hospital admission showed an elevation of white cells (22,9Ã—103 cells per cubit

39

millimeter), but others parameters (platelet and hematocrit) were in normal ranges (data not

40

shown). His chest radiographs obtained on admission showed bilateral infiltrates (Supplementary

41

Figure 1). The patient was empirically treated with a combination of antivirals and antibiotics,

42

and received supplemental oxygen through an oxygen mask.

43

On February 1, 2020, a throat swab collected on admission from the patient was positive for

44

SARS-CoV-2 by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (Supplementary

45

Table 1), followed by sequencing of the amplified product to confirm the result. Testing for other

46

pathogens (routine bacterial culture and influenza A/B viruses) were negative.

47

His clinical condition improved, and from February 9th he no longer required supplementary

48

oxygen. However, follow-up throat swabs remained positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time RT-

PCR (1), until day 11 of hospitalization (i.e. day 16 of illness) (Figure 1). Rectal swabs were RT-

50

PCR positive until day 18 of hospitalization (day 23 of illness). Additionally, a plasma sample

51

collected on day 2 of admission was weakly positive; urine samples were negative (Figure 1).

52

The patient was discharged with full recovery on February 21, 2020 after 21 days of

53

hospitalization.

54

Since his arrival in Vietnam, the patient had stayed in a hotel in Ho Chi Minh City, and had

55

sought for medical treatments at private clinics before hospital admission. A total of 14 close

56

contacts were identified and followed for 14 days, but none had signs of respiratory infections,

57

and their throat swabs collected on day 14 of quarantine were RT-PCR negative for SARS-CoV-

58

2.

59

Long duration of viral detection in throat swabs by RT-PCR has been reported in a case series

60

from China (2) and a patient in the US (3). Together with the recent success of SARS-CoV-2

61

isolation in cell culture in a stool sample of a COVID-19 patient in China (4), our finding on the

62

persistent PCR positivity in rectal swabs raise concerns about the possibility of fecal-oral

63

transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

64

Collectively, our report shows the persistence of PCR positivity in throat and rectum of a patient

65

with COVID-19, which may potentially indicate persistent viral shedding. As such COVID-19

66

patients may remain infectious for long periods, and fecal-oral transmission may be possible.

67

Therefore, our finding has important implications for infection control.

Note to figure 1: a Ct value of 0 indicates no samples available for RT-PCR analysis. Ct value
of 40 is the cut-off of assay detection limit (blue line). A Ct value of 45 represents for a negative
