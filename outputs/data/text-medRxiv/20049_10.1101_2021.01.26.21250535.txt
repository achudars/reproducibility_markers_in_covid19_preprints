Summary

42

Background: The risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) subsequent

43

infection among seropositive young adults was studied prospectively.

44

Methods: The study population comprised 3,249 predominantly male, 18-20-year-old Marine recruits.

45

Upon arrival at a Marine-supervised two-week quarantine, participants were assessed for baseline SARS-

46

CoV-2 IgG seropositivity, defined as a 1:150 dilution or greater on receptor binding domain and full-

47

length spike protein enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assays. SARS-CoV-2 infection was assessed

48

by PCR at initiation, middle and end of the quarantine. After appropriate exclusions, including

49

participants with a positive PCR during quarantine, we performed three biweekly PCR tests in both

50

seropositive and in seronegative groups once recruits left quarantine and entered basic training and

51

baseline neutralizing antibody titers on all subsequently infected seropositive and selected seropositive

52

uninfected participants.

53

Findings: Among 189 seropositive participants, 19 (10.1%) had at least one positive PCR test for SARS-

54

CoV-2 during the six-week follow-up (1.1 cases per person-year). In contrast, 1,079 (48.0%) of the 2,247

55

seronegative participants tested positive (6.2 cases per person-year). The incidence rate ratio was 0.18

56

(95% CI 0.11-0.28, p<0.00001). Among seropositive recruits, infection was associated with lower

57

baseline full-length spike protein IgG titers (p<0.0001). Compared with seronegative recruits,

58

seropositive recruits had about 10-fold lower viral loads (ORF1ab gene, p<0.005), and trended towards

59

shorter duration of PCR positivity (p=0.18) and more frequent asymptomatic infections (p=0.13). Among

60

seropositive participants, baseline neutralizing titers were detected in 45 of 54 (83.3%) uninfected and in

61

6 of 19 (31.6%) infected participants during the 6 weeks of observation (ID50 difference p<.0001).

62

Interpretation: Seropositive young adults had about one-fifth the risk of subsequent infection compared

63

with seronegative individuals. Although antibodies induced by initial infection are largely protective, they

64

do not guarantee effective SARS-CoV-2 neutralization activity or immunity against subsequent infection.

65

These findings may be relevant for optimization of mass vaccination strategies.

Introduction
As of mid-December 2020, more than 72 million severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

72

(SARS-CoV-2) infections have been diagnosed world-wide1. Serological surveys indicate that the actual

73

number of infections has been many times higher than the cumulative incidence of diagnosed cases, with

74

seropositivity rates approaching 10% in some countries and more than 40% in the Brazilian Amazon2-4.

75

With the onset of mass SARS-CoV-2 vaccination programs and the increasing proportion of previously

76

infected individuals, the risk of reinfection after natural infection is an important question for modeling

77

the pandemic, estimating herd immunity and guiding vaccination strategies5,6.

78

Most individuals mount a sustained serologic response after initial infection7-11. Similar to the

79

response to other coronaviruses, the production of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 peaks several

80

weeks after infection, goes through a decline phase and then stabilizes. The overall humoral response to

81

SARS-CoV-2 is highly variable among individuals9. SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies can be

82

detected in serum from most individuals several months after infection11. However, a percentage of

83

infected patients, ranging from 2.5% to 28% in different studies, do not maintain detectable circulating

84

antibodies9 or neutralizing activity10-12 at later time points. About 10% of individuals who developed

85

antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, all of whom had full-length spike protein-specific IgG antibody titers lower

86

than 1:320, failed to develop measurable neutralizing activity11.

87

Reports have established that SARS-CoV-2 reinfection occurs after previous infection as well as

88

in seropositive individuals13-22. Several studies have reported that SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies22,23 and

89

neutralizing antibodies24 provide protection against subsequent infection. The initial trial results of the

90

adenoviral vector-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222), noted that among the

91

373 participants who were seropositive at baseline, 3 (0.8%) had subsequent positive swab PCR tests; in

92

comparison, among 11,263 baseline seronegative participants in all arms of that study, 218 (1.9%)

93

developed a positive test21. A study of SARS-CoV-2 serological status and infection among healthcare

94

workers identified 2 infections among 1265 (0.16%) who were seropositive and 223 among 11,364

95

(2.0%) who were seronegative22. Young adults, of whom a high proportion are asymptomatically infected

96

and become seropositive in the absence of known infection25,26 can be an important source of transmission

97

to more vulnerable populations27. Evaluating the protection against subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection

98

conferred by seropositivity in young adults is important for determining the need for vaccinating

99

previously infected individuals in this age group.

100

We utilized the COVID-19 Health Action Response for Marines (CHARM) study26, a

101

longitudinal prospective cohort study, to examine the effect of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity on the risk of

102

developing SARS-CoV-2 infection in young, healthy adult Marine recruits.

103
104

Methods

105

Study design and participants

106

The prospective study observation period began when Marine recruits arrived at Marine Corps

107

Recruit Depot – Parris Island (MCRDPI) to commence basic training (Figure 1). To mitigate the spread of

108

SARS-CoV-2, just before transferring to MCRDPI, the United States Marine Corps (USMC)

109

implemented two separate quarantine protocols. The first was a two-week home quarantine. After that,

110

the recruits traveled, while masked and socially distanced, to a second USMC-supervised quarantine

111

situated at either a college campus from May until July 2020 or at a hotel from August until October

112

2020. The supervised quarantine employed extensive public health measures, as previously described26,

113

that were strictly enforced by US Marine instructors at all times. The recruits and staff were forbidden to

114

leave, and no visitors other than deliveries of supplies and food along with local essential workers and the

115

study staff were allowed onto the premises. At the end of this quarantine period, the USMC required all

116

recruits to test negative for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR before proceeding to MCRDPI to initiate basic training.

117

Within 48 hours of arriving at the supervised quarantine location, recruits were offered the

118

opportunity to volunteer for CHARM. Recruits were eligible if they were ≥18 years of age. Since recruits

119

are a vulnerable population and at risk for coercion, special measures were undertaken including study

120

briefers, who are active-duty Navy personnel wore civilian clothes, did not disclose military ranks, did not

121

have members in the recruit’s chain of command present, and ensured that participation would not affect

122

a recruit’s medical care or influence the grading of a recruit’s military performance by superiors.

123

Institutional Review Board approval was obtained from the Naval Medical Research Center (protocol

124

number NMRC.2020.0006) in compliance with all applicable U.S. federal regulations governing the

125

protection of human subjects. All participants provided written informed consent.

126

At enrollment, participants completed a questionnaire consisting of demographic information,

127

risk-factors, reporting of 14 specific COVID-19 related symptoms or any other unspecified symptom, and

128

brief medical-history. At quarantine weeks 0, 1 and 2 a mid-turbinate nares swab for SARS-CoV-2 PCR

129

testing and sera were obtained and questionnaire administered. The follow up questionnaire inquired

130

about the same COVID-19 related symptoms since the last study visit.

131

Participants who had three negative swab PCR results at the beginning, middle and end of

132

quarantine and a baseline serum serology test at the beginning of the supervised quarantine that identified

133

them as seronegative or seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 according to criteria described below were

134

followed prospectively. At weeks 2, 4 and 6 after transfer from the quarantine location to MCRDPI, a

135

mid-turbinate nares swab for SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing and sera were obtained and the symptom

136

questionnaire administered. When clinically indicated due to the development of symptoms, some

137

participants were evaluated at the MCRDPI clinic and diagnosed by rapid testing. If positive, they went to

138

the isolation barracks, where the study team was able to follow up and repeat testing outside of the

139

scheduled longitudinal follow up encounters. Participants without PCR results obtained during the

140

MCRDPI study period were excluded from analysis.

141
142

Procedures

143

SARS-CoV-2 quantitative PCR testing

144

All swabs in viral transport media (VTM) were kept at 4°C. All assays were performed within 48h

145

of sample collection at high complexity Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified

146

laboratories using the US FDA authorized Thermofisher TaqPath™ COVID-19 Combo Kit (Thermo Fisher

147

Scientific, Waltham MA). Lab24Inc (Boca Raton, FL) performed PCR testing from study initiation until

148

the end of July, and the Naval Medical Research Center (Silver Spring, MD) from August until the

149

conclusion of the study.

150

SARS-CoV2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)

151

The presence and levels of IgG SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in serum were determined using

152

an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as previously described26. Briefly, 384-well Immulon 4

153

HBX plates (Thermofisher), or 96-well half area Microlon plates (Greiner Bio-One), were coated

154

overnight at 4°C with recombinant his-tagged spike (S) receptor binding domain (S-RBD)

155

(SinoBiological) or full-length spike protein (LakePharma) at a concentration of 2 µg/ml in phosphate-

156

buffered saline (PBS). Plates were washed three times with 0.1% Tween-20 (Fisher Scientific) in PBS

157

(PBS-T) using an automated ELISA plate washer (Aquamax 4000, Molecular devices), and blocked for 1

158

h at room temperature (RT) with 3% milk (BioRad) PBS-T. Blocking solution was removed, and serum

159

samples diluted in 1% milk PBS-T were dispensed in the wells. At least 2 positive controls (sera with

160

known IgG presence), 8 negative controls (sera collected before July 2019) and 4 blanks (no serum) were

161

included in every assay. Plates were incubated for 2 h at room temperature, and then washed 3 times with

162

PBS-T. Next, peroxidase conjugated goat F(ab')2 Anti-Human IgG (Abcam) was added at a dilution

163

1:5,000-1:10,000 dilutions (determined after optimization for each antibody lot) in 1% milk PBS-T, and

164

plates were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Plates were washed 6 times with PBS-T, developed

165

using o-Phenylenediamine (Sigma), and the reaction was stopped after 10 min with 3M HCl. Optical

166

density (OD) at 492 nm was measured using a microplate reader (SpectramaxM2, Molecular Devices).

167

All serum samples were screened at a 1:50 dilution with S-RBD. Those samples with an OD 492 nm

168

value higher than the average of the negative controls plus 3 times their standard deviation (SD) in the

169

screening assay underwent titration assay (6 serial 1:3 serum dilutions starting at 1:50) using both S-RBD

170

and full-length spike protein. Serum samples were considered positive for each assay when at least 2

171

consecutive dilutions showed higher OD 492 nm than the average of the negative controls plus 3 times

172

their SD at the correspondent dilution or 0.15 OD 492 nM. Specificity was 100% on both S-RBD and

173

full-length spike protein ELISA using 70 control sera obtained before July 2019. Participants were only

174

considered seropositive to SARS-CoV-2 if IgG titrations for both ELISA gave a positive result at a

175

minimum of 1:150 dilution.

177

Neutralization assays

178

Two-fold serial dilutions of heat-inactivated serum at an initial dilution of 1:20, were prepared in serum

179

free media (Minimum Essential Medium; Thermo fisher Scientific, Cat No. 11095080 containing 25 mM

180

HEPES and 0.05 g/L gentamicin sulfate) and incubated with an equal volume of mNeonGreen SARS-

181

CoV-228 for 1 hour at 37°C at a final concentration of 200 plaque forming units in humidified 5% CO2.

182

Virus-serum mixtures were then added to Vero-E6 monolayers in 96 well optical black plates and

183

incubated at 37°C. Plates were read using the BioTek Cytation 5 plate reader (EX 485 nm, EM 528 nm) at

184

24 h post-infection. Following background signal correction, neutralization titers at a fluorescent end

185

point of 50% virus reduction (ID50) were determined.

186
187

Statistical Analysis

188

Analyses, figures and tables were generated using R 3.6.3. Race was categorized as non-

189

Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic other, and Hispanic. Cochran-Armitage Chi-

190

square test for trend was used to compare proportions testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 by

191

increasing titers. Cumulative incidence rates computed by Kapan-Meir method were used to

192

estimate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection between seropositive and seronegative participants

193

and also between different titers among the seropositive participants. Observational follow-up

194

began upon arrival at MCRDPI and participants were censored at the first observed positive

195

PCR, or at the latest time with valid PCR assay or at the termination of the study (6 weeks of

196

observation). The Cox proportional hazards model controlled for age, sex and race. The p-values

197

from the cumulative incidence curves were determined by the log-rank test and the p-value and

198

CI for Cox proportional hazard model was computed by the R function coxph. The cycle

199

threshold (Ct) values of viral genes were quantile normalized to remove the batch effects

200

between Lab24Inc and Naval Medical Research Center laboratory assays. The CI and p-values for

201

comparing the mean of the Ct values for two groups are computed based on the two sample t-

202

test.

204

The funders had no role in the design of the protocol, data collection, data management, data analysis,

205

208

Results

209

The flow of participants through the study is shown in Figure 1. Two weeks before the initiation

210

of basic training and the start of the prospective cohort study period, a total of 3,249 out of 4,657 eligible

211

new Marine recruits (70%) enrolled in CHARM and underwent a supervised two-week quarantine.

212

Exclusions before the prospective study period included 73 participants who were SARS-CoV-2 PCR

213

positive on at least one of the three PCR tests performed during quarantine, 53 who lacked baseline

214

serology results and 47 who were lost to follow-up.

215

Of the remaining 3,076 participants, 225 were baseline seropositive, having SARS-CoV-2 IgG

216

titers in serum samples obtained at the beginning of quarantine that were greater than 1:150 both with S-

217

RBD and with full-length spike protein ELISA, and 2,851 were baseline seronegative. Among the

218

seropositive participants, 36 (16.0%) were excluded from analysis due either to being lost to follow up

219

(n=34), or to lacking valid PCR results during the study period (n=2). In the seronegative group, 604

220

(21.2%) participants were excluded due to either being lost to follow up (n=532), or lacking valid PCR

221

results (n=72). Participants were lost to follow up for specific reasons unknown to the study team,

222

including dropping out of the study, being separated from the Marines or being removed from the base for

223

medical or administrative reasons. Demographic characteristics of the two groups in the study cohort are

224

shown in Table 1. Most participants were 18-20 years old and male. The two groups were well-balanced

225

with the exception of a higher proportion of participants who self-identified as Hispanic and as black in

226

the seropositive group.

227

A total of 19 out of 189 (10.1%, 1.1 cases per person-year) seropositive participants and 1,079 out

228

of 2,247 (48.0%, 6.2 cases per person-year) seronegative participants had at least one positive SARS-

229

CoV-2 PCR result during the six-week study period, representing an 0.18 (95% CI: 0.11 to 0.28, p<0.001)

230

incidence rate ratio for SARS-CoV-2 infections in the seropositive group (Table 2). The temporal

231

incidence of infection in seropositive and seronegative groups is shown in Figure 2A. After adjusting the

232

effects of race, age and sex on the SARS-CoV-2 infections, the hazard ratio comparing seropositive

233

participants and seronegative participants was 0.16 (95% CI, 0.10-0.25, p<0.001; supplementary Table 1).

234

Within the seropositive group, we assessed the association between the SARS-CoV-2 IgG

235

baseline titers and the risk of infection. As shown in Figure 2B, supplementary Figure 2 and Table 3, we

236

found a strong association between subsequent PCR positive infection and lower titers of IgG antibodies

237

directed to full-length spike protein (p<0.0001) as well as to S-RBD (p=0.0019). The detailed Cox

238

proportional hazard analysis in supplementary Table 1 gives a hazard ratio of 0.45 (95% CI 0.32-0.65,

239

p<0.001) and 0.67 (95% CI 0.47-0.96, p=0.028) respectively for the full-length spike protein titer and S-

240

RBD titer, both log-transformed.

241

We examined baseline SARS-CoV-2 IgG neutralizing antibody activity in all seropositive

242

participants who became PCR positive during the observation period and in the first 54 participants who

243

were seropositive but remained PCR negative. Neutralizing activity was above the limit of detection in 45

244

of 54 (83.3%) seropositive participants who never became PCR positive and in 6 of 19 (31.6%) of

245

participants infected during the 6 weeks of observation. The neutralizing activity assessed as 50%

246

inhibitory dose (ID50) was significantly higher in the participants who did not become PCR positive

247

during the study (p<.0001, Cochran-Armitage test, Table 3, supplementary Figure 2).

248

We also compared virus loads estimated by PCR Ct values between the seronegative and

249

seropositive PCR infected groups and found that seronegative individuals had on average 4, 2.6 and 3.3

250

lower cycle values for ORF1ab gene (p=0.004, 95% CI 1.23 to 6.67), S gene (p=0.11, 95% CI -0.58 to

251

5.77) and N gene (p=0.033, 95% CI 0.27 to 6.33), respectively, than seropositive individuals. The lower

252

Ct values suggest an approximately 10-fold higher virus load in the samples from seronegative

253

participants (Table 4). In addition, seronegative participants tended to have a longer duration of PCR

254

positivity than seropositive individuals (p=0.18). The proportion of asymptomatic participants was 84.2%

255

(16 of 19) and 67.8% (732 of 1079) in seropositive and seronegative infected individuals, respectively, a

256

difference that did not reach significance (p=0.13).

Discussion
This study of primarily young, male Marine recruits found that the presence of antibodies to

260

SARS-CoV-2 conferred an 82% reduced incidence rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The percentage of

261

symptomatic infections was comparable in seropositive and seronegative participants. Among the

262

seropositive group, the participants that became infected had lower antibody titers than those that were

263

uninfected, and were more likely to lack detectable baseline neutralizing antibody activity. Our results

264

indicate that although antibodies induced by infection are largely protective, they do not guarantee

265

effective immunity against subsequent infection.

266

This study leveraged a two-week USMC-mandated quarantine period during which baseline

267

SARS-CoV-2 antibody status was established on arrival. Only baseline seronegative or seropositive

268

participants who had multiple negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests during the supervised quarantine were

269

included in the prospective study. The three negative PCR tests during quarantine helped ensure that

270

infections diagnosed during basic training were not persistent infections but incident infection occurring

271

during the prospective period. The two-week home quarantine preceding the supervised quarantine, as

272

well as the relatively low frequency of infections diagnosed on arrival and during quarantine, further

273

support that only incident infections were included in our analyses. The aggregate infection rate in both

274

groups during the six weeks of observation at MCRDPI was 1,098 out of 2,436 (45.1%) participants. In

275

contrast, only 28 of 3,249 (0.9%) participants were PCR positive on arrival at the supervised quarantine

276

and less than 2% of participants became PCR positive during the two-week quarantine period. In view of

277

the consecutive two periods of quarantine, the relatively low rate of infection during quarantine, and the

278

three consecutive negative PCR tests, it is unlikely that any participants with persistent infection

279

preceding their arrival at MCRDPI were entered into the prospective study. Even if this occurred, such

280

cases would be unlikely to affect the relative risk calculations comparing the seropositive and

281

seronegative groups. This methodology allowed for the creation of two well defined groups who entered

282

basic training without active infection and differed primarily by baseline serology.

283

The two groups had similar demographic profiles, with the exception of a slightly higher

284

prevalence in self-identified Hispanic and non-Hispanic black participants in the seropositive group. The

285

seropositive group was almost 50% Hispanic and 22% non-Hispanic black participants compared to 22%

286

and 12%, respectively in the seronegative group. This is likely due to minority populations having higher

287

seroprevalence rates during the COVID-19 pandemic in general and among young adults specifically27.

288

Rates of infection and the risk reduction provided by seropositivity are important for

289

understanding transmission dynamics for COVID-19, for epidemiologic modeling, and for estimating and

290

achieving herd immunity levels, a major goal of mass vaccination strategies. Herd immunity is difficult to

291

predict if the infection risk after natural and vaccine-induced immunity is unknown. Since SARS-CoV-2

292

vaccines may not provide sterile immunity, it is possible that both previously infected and vaccinated

293

individuals may later become infected. It is not known if either can contribute to transmission events. We

294

found only a modest, approximately 10-fold decrease in nares virus load as estimated by swab PCR Ct

295

levels in the seropositive compared with the seronegative infected participants. This finding suggests that

296

some reinfected individuals could have a similar capacity to transmit infection as those who are infected

297

for the first time. The rate at which reinfection occurs after vaccines and natural immunity are important

298

for estimating the percentage of the population that needs to be vaccinated to suppress the pandemic.

299

The crowded living conditions, demanding regimen and requirement for personal contact during

300

basic training despite the pandemic leads not only to an increased risk for respiratory epidemics29, but also

301

potentially to higher exposure levels. The close quarters and constant contact among recruits that are

302

needed for team building allows a viral infection to rapidly proliferate within a unit. The physically and

303

mentally demanding training environment may also suppress immunity. These conditions may contribute

304

to the high infection rate we observed during the six-week study period. These factors are not typically

305

present in the civilian community. Therefore, the study setting limits the generalizability of our findings

306

to other settings where the frequency and intensity of exposure and the susceptibility of the host might

307

differ.

308

The clinical outcomes between seropositive and seronegative groups were similar, with the

309

majority (84.2% and 67.8%, respectively) being asymptomatic. The two groups did not show a significant

310

difference in the duration of PCR positivity. No participants in either group needed inpatient care.

311

Although our findings are limited to healthy young adults, studying this population does have the

312

advantage of reducing the confounding factors of age and co-morbid illnesses30. Infection in seropositive

313

participants was associated with lower SARS-CoV-2 IgG titers and absent or lower levels of neutralizing

314

antibody activity. Young adults have high rates of asymptomatic and pauci-symptomatic infection, which

315

has been associated with lower levels of antibodies and potentially a less robust immune memory

316

response. This could lead to higher overall rates of re-infection among this population compared to other

317

populations. We did not examine the role of cell mediated immunity or host, environment and virus

318

factors leading to reinfection.

319

Since the study population is a fairly accurate representation of the races and ethnicities in the US

320

population among 18-20-year-olds, the results are most applicable to young male adults. The relative risk

321

of infection may be different in seropositive females and in adults of other ages or health status. Other

322

limitations in our study include not being able to investigate the exposure event during a seropositive

323

participant’s initial infection prior to arrival at quarantine, the inability to confirm initial SARS-CoV-2

324

infection by PCR in the seropositive group, and potentially missing detectable infections that occurred

325

between biweekly sampling.

326

Our investigation is likely to underestimate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in previously

327

infected individuals because the seronegative group includes an unknown number of previously infected

328

participants who did not have significant IgG titers in their baseline serum sample. Despite this

329

underestimation, we found that previously infected participants identified by seropositivity are susceptible

330

to repeat infection, with nearly one-fifth the incidence rate of those without evidence of previous

331

infection. This suggests that COVID-19 vaccination may be necessary for control of the pandemic in

332

previously infected young adults.

Figure 1: Flow chart of the study design and outcomes. The baseline analyses were performed within
two days of enrollment and two weeks before the prospective study period. Nearly all participants were
tested at scheduled biweekly intervals during the prospective study period. A few participants were
diagnosed by the Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island clinic, and were tested by the study team at
times not corresponding to the regularly scheduled longitudinal follow ups. Participants lost to follow up
either dropped out of the study, were separated from the Marine Corps or were removed from the base for
medical or administrative reasons. The study team did not know the reason for participants missing study
visits.

with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
* The predictor in multivariable analysis includes predictor variables group, age, sex and race using all
2,436 participants with valid PCR data to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection during the six-week
prospective study period.
† The predictor in multivariable analysis includes predictor variables titer, age, sex and race using 189
participants in the seropositive group. The titers (S-RBD and full-length spike protein) have been log
transformed. The univariate analysis for both S-RBD titer and full-length spike protein titer gives the
same results of age, sex and race due to use the same set of participants and were kept for both to make
it is easier to compare the univariable and multivariable analysis.

participants. The baseline 50% inhibitory dose (ID50) was determined for all seropositive participants
who became SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive during the subsequent six-week observation period and in the
first 54 seropositive participants enrolled who did not test PCR positive. N.D. indicates no inhibition
detected at a 1:20 dilution which was the lowest titer evaluated. P value was assessed by the CochranArmitage test.
