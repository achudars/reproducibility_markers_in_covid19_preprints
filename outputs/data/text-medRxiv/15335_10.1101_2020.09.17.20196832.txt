Introduction: Severe COVID-19 is infrequent in children, with a lethality rate of
about 0.08%. This study aims to explore differences in the pediatric mortality rate
between countries.
Methods: Countries with populations over 5 million that report COVID-19 deaths
disaggregated data by quinquennial or decennial age groups were analyzed. Data
were extracted from COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by Age Database, national
ministries of health, and the World Health Organization.
Results: 23 countries were included in the analysis. Pediatric mortality varied from
0 to 12.1 deaths per million people of the corresponding age group, with the
highest rate in Peru. In most countries, deaths were more frequent in the 0-4 years
old age group, except for Brazil. The pediatric/ general COVID-19 mortality
showed a great variation between countries and ranged from 0 (Republic of Korea)
to 10.4% (India). Pediatric and Pediatric/general COVID mortality have a strong
correlation with 2018 neonatal mortality (r=0.77, p<0.001 and r= 0.88, p<0.001
respectively), while it has a moderate or absent (r=0.47, p=0.02 and r=0.19,
p=0.38, respectively) correlation with COVID-19 mortality in the general population.
Conclusions: There is an important heterogenicity in pediatric COVI-19 mortality
between countries that parallels historical neonatal mortality. Neonatal mortality is
a known index of the quality of a country´s Health System which points to the
importance of social determinants of health in pediatric COVID-19 mortality
disparities, an issue which should be further explored.

Introduction
Since the first cases of coronavirus disease, 2019 (COVID-19) appeared in
Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019, morbidity and mortality by SARS-CoV-2 have
been significant in countries within every continent. Mortality is mostly concentrated
in advanced age groups and the adult population with ongoing comorbidities (1-5).
Children and adolescents constitute 2% and 9.5% of all reported cases in Europe
and the USA, respectively. Severe COVID-19 is infrequent in children and
intensive care unit admissions regarding this age group have been reported to be
about 2% and lethality rate about 0.08% (6). Besides, preliminary evidence
suggests that both ethnicity (Black and Hispanic) and age (under 1 month and
early adolescence [10-14 years]) are associated with admission to a critical care
unit. Moreover, children from low-income families or non-white ethnicity are more
likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 than those of white ethnicity and high-income
(7, 8).

To date, COVID-19 epidemiologic data in the pediatric population has been
published by some countries but there is a scarcity of analysis comparing different
populations.
The COVID-19 mortality rate in the population under 18 years of
age, might be heterogeneous between countries with different incomes rates and
ethnicities. Our aim with this brief report is to explore the differences in the COVID19 pediatric mortality rate between countries.
Methods
We included information about countries with populations over 5 million that
reported COVID-19 deaths, disaggregated by quinquennial or decennial age
groups. Data about confirmed COVID-19 death counts were consulted in the
COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by Age Database (COVerAge-DB) (9), COVerAgeDB collects age- and sex-specific cumulative cases, deaths, and tests from official
reports from multiple countries worldwide and for several subpopulations. Data
from Argentina, Canada, and Peru, and Mexico were consulted from the local
Ministries of Health (10-13) Data from countries that disaggregate data by
decennial age groups, were estimated according to the countries age structure
available data.
For the computation of age-specific mortality rates, we obtained both the total and
quinquennial age groups estimated populations for 2018 or the latest available
year from the United Nations Statistics Division Web site, (14). Data for general
COVID-19 mortality were extracted from the World Health Organization (WHO)
reports (15).
In an exploratory analysis, we also calculated the Spearman´s correlation
coefficient between pediatric COVID-19 mortality rates with general mortality rates
and newborn mortality by any cause in 2018 (before the COVID-19 pandemic).
STATA 13.0 ® was used for the analysis.
Results
We included 23 countries in the analysis. Table 1 shows the general mortality and
pediatric mortality rates from COVID-19. Specifically, 63% of deaths in the
population of <15 years of age at the time of the study occurred in India (n =
1,622). However, when adjusting the mortality per million people for this age group,
the highest rates were observed in Latin American countries (Peru, Brazil,
Ecuador, and Mexico). Although Peru also has the highest overall mortality rate
from COVID-19, it is followed by European countries (United Kingdom, Spain, and
Italy). On the other hand, the highest pediatric to general population ratio of
COVID-19 mortality was identified in Asian countries (India, Indonesia, and the
Philippines).

Table 2 shows the pediatric mortality by quinquennial age groups. The highest
mortality in children under 10 years old was observed in Peru and the highest
mortality in children older than 10 years old was in Brazil.
We found a significant strong correlation between both the COVID-19 pediatric
mortality and the pediatric/general COVID-19 mortality ratio and the 2018
neonatal mortality (r=0.77, p<0.001 and r= 0.88, p<0.001 respectively), while there
was a moderate or absent correlation with COVID-19 mortality in the general
population. (r=0.47, p=0.02 and r=0.19, p=0.38, respectively) (Table 3).
Discussion
Despite COVID-19 mortality in children is minimal in comparison with that in the
adult population, there is significant heterogeneity between countries. Several
factors should be explored to explain this variability. This report was elaborated
with available data from different sources and differences in reporting systems of
epidemiological information may be accountable for some of the variation.
Remarkably, the highest pediatric mortality rates are among countries of uppermiddle-income countries in contrast with high-income countries (data for lower and
lower-middle-income countries were not available). This is true even for highincome countries that have suffered from high mortality rates in the general
population which, despite this, have a low pediatric/general COVID mortality rate
ratio (adjusted for age structure).
In most countries, the COVID mortality rate in the pediatric population is
concentrated in the under 5-year-old population. Brazil has a disproportionately
high mortality rate in adolescents and the causes of this must be studied. In
Mexico, about half of the deaths in the 0-4 age group are in infants < 1-year-old. It
is important to have disaggregated data for age to estimate the share of child
mortality which corresponds to neonatal and infant mortality.
Child, infant, and neonatal mortality are known indicators of the quality of health
care systems(16). It is noticeable that pediatric COVID mortality and
pediatric/general COVID-19 rate ratio are highly correlated with historical basal
neonatal mortality while it is only moderately correlated with general COVID-19
mortality. These findings suggest an important role of social determinants of health
as well as the quality of health care systems in discrepancies of pediatric COVID19 mortality rates between countries. The relative importance of this set of factors
over biological factors remains to be established.
