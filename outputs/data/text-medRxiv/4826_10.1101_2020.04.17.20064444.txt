Abstract
Background: Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is usually used as supportive
therapy, but the treatment of COVID-19 by IVIG is controversial. This rapid review
aims to explore the clinical effectiveness and safety of IVIG in the treatment of children
with severe COVID-19.
Methods: We systematically searched the literature on the use of IVIG in patients with
COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) or Middle East Respiratory
Syndrome (MERS), including both adults and children. We assessed the risk of bias and
quality of evidence and reported the main findings descriptively.
Results: A total of 1519 articles were identified by initial literature search, and finally
six studies, included one randomized controlled trial (RCT), four case series and one
case report involving 198 patients. One case series showed the survival of COVID-19
patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was not improved by IVIG.
One case report showed high-dose IVIG could improve the outcome of COVID-19
adults. Three observational studies showed inconsistent results of the effect of IVIG on
SARS patients. One RCT showed that IVIG did not reduce mortality or the incidence of
nosocomial infection in adults with severe SARS. The quality of evidence was between
low and very low.
Conclusions: The existing evidence is insufficient to support the efficacy or safety of
IVIG in the treatment of COVID-19.
Keywords: COVID-19; children; intravenous immunoglobulin; rapid review.

Background
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), first reported in China on December, 2019, is
an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) (1). SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the family of coronaviruses, which are
enveloped viruses that can cause illnesses ranging from common cold to severe diseases
such as SARS and MERS (2,3). The COVID-19 epidemic massively influences the
public health and people's daily lives, and the disease was declared a pandemic on 11
March 2020 (4). All populations are susceptible to infection and there is a research
shows children are as likely to be infected as adults (5). On February 11, 2020, there
were 44672 confirmed cases in mainland China, of whom 416 were under the age of 10
years and 549 between the ages of 10 to 19 years (6). The main symptoms in children
are fever and cough, and the disease is on average less severe in children than adults (7).
However, severe cases have been reported also in children (8). So far, there has been no
specific treatment for COVID-19, antiviral therapy and vaccination are currently under
development (9,10).
IVIG is prepared from the plasma of healthy humans and usually used as supportive
therapy. Its main component is immunoglobulin (Ig) G, which has dual therapeutic
effects of immune-modulation effects and immune substitution (11). IVIG is one of the
alternative treatments for children with agammaglobulinemia, and an effective
treatment of Kawasaki disease (12,13). IVIG was used to treat SARS patients during the
SARS outbreak in 2003 (14,15), but there is no convincing evidence of its effectiveness.

According to recent reports, about 33% of patients with severe COVID-19 received
IVIG in China (16). Some published guidelines of COVID-19 have indicated that IVIG
could be used to treat children with severe or critical disease (17).
The purpose of this study is to perform a comprehensive rapid review to explore
whether it is beneficial to treat children with severe COVID-19 with IVIG and provide
supporting evidence support for COVID-19 guidelines. Because of the urgent situation,
the review was not registered (18).

Methods
Search strategy
We carried out a comprehensive search in the following electronic databases: the
Cochrane library, MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE, Web of Science, China Biology
Medicine disc (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang
Data, by using the terms “COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV-2”, “Novel coronavirus”, “2019-novel
coronavirus”, “2019-nCoV”, “SARS”, “MERS”, “IVIG”, “intravenous immunoglobulin”

and their derivatives. The search covered the time from each database’s inception to
March 31, 2020. The search strategies are determined by multiple pre-searches and will
be discussed with the clinicians about the appellation of disease and IVIG. We also
searched the World Health Organization Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ISRCTN
Registry, ClinicalTrials, Google Scholar, three preprint services, including medRxiv
(https://www.medrxiv.org/),

bioRxiv

(https://www.biorxiv.org/)

and

Inclusion and exclusion criteria
We

included

RCTs

that

compared

IVIG

treatment

(standard

intravenous

immunoglobulin preparations, excluding IgM-enriched immunoglobulin, hyperimmune
immunoglobulin and specific immunoglobulin from convalecent plasma) with a control
group (placebo or no treatment with IVIG), and cohort studies, cross-sectional studies,
case-control studies, case series and cases report that can distinguish the corresponding
outcomes caused by IVIG. The inclusion of COVID-19 adult patients and patients with
SARS or MERS helps to provide indirect evidence, if studies on COVID-19 in children
are scarce. Studies with all patients diagnosed with COVID-19, SARS or MERS were
included, without restrictions on age, race, gender, or geographical location or setting.
The primary outcomes were the risk of death and severity of the disease. Secondary
outcomes included the incidence of nosocomial infection, the duration of hospitalization,
clinical symptoms, absorption of lung lesions, improvement in abnormal biochemical
indicators, and adverse effects. We excluded duplicates, conference abstracts, comments
and letters, studies published in languages other than English or Chinese, and studies
where we could not access the full text.
Study selection
After eliminating duplicates by EndNote software and manual check, two reviewers (J
Zhang and Y Yang) independently reviewed the titles and abstracts of records retrieved

from the search and selected all potentially relevant studies according to the pre-defined
inclusion and exclusion criteria. After this, the same reviewers screened the full texts
and made the final selection. A pilot search was conducted before the full screening of
the literature to ensure that each researcher understood the screening criteria and
process. Disagreements about selection of studies were resolved by consulting a third
party (N Yang). The process of study selection was documented using a PRISMA flow
diagram (19).

Data extraction
Two reviewers (J Zhang and Y Yang) independently extracted the following data from
included trials using a standardized extraction sheet: 1) basic information (year of
publication, first author and affiliation, journal, funding, conflict of interest); 2) study
details (type of study, sample size, research purpose, research population characteristics,
interventions; and 3) outcome data. A pre-test was conducted before formal extraction
to ensure that each researcher agreed with the extraction criteria and process.
Disagreements were solved through discussion with a third researcher (N Yang).
Risk of bias assessment
Two reviewers (J Zhang and Y Ma) assessed the quality of the included studies
independently. We used the Cochrane bias risk assessment tool (Risk of bias) to assess
the randomized controlled trials and clinical controlled trials (20), the criteria
recommended by the National Institute of Health and Clinical Optimization (NICE) for
case series to assess the risk of bias (21), the Joanna Briggs Institute’(JBI) case report

quality appraisal tool for case reports(22) Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale
(NOS) for the quality of cohort studies and case-control studies (23), and Agency for
Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) tool for cross-sectional studies (24).
Data synthesis
For dichotomous outcomes we calculated the risk ratio (RR) and the corresponding 95%
confidence interval (CI) and P value. For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean
difference (MD) and its corresponding 95% CI when means and standard deviations
(SD) were reported. If sufficient data were available, we considered examined the
robustness of meta‐analyses in a sensitivity analysis.When effect sizes could not be
pooled, we reported the study effectives narratively.
Quality of the evidence assessment
The quality of the body of evidence was graded using the GRADE method (25,26). Evidence from
randomized trials could be downgraded by the following five factors: risk of bias, inconsistency of results,
indirectness of evidence, imprecision of results, and publication bias. The quality of evidence for each
outcome was graded as high, medium, low, or very low. The results of the grading were presented in
“GRADE evidence profile” (27-30).

Results
We identified 1519 articles in the initial literature search (Figure 1). After removing
duplicates, we screened the titles and abstracts of 1405 records. Thirty-one articles were
retrieved for full-text reviewing. Finally, one RCT, four case series and one case report
involving a total of 198 patients were included for rapid review (31-36).

The studies were published between 2004 and 2020, and all studies were from
China (Table 1 and Table 3). We found one case series on IVIG in COVID-19 adults
with ARDS, one case report in COVID-19 adults, one randomized controlled trial of 44
adults with severe SARS, which included 25 adults with acute lung injury (ALI) and 19
adults with ARDS), one case series involving children with SARS, and two case series
also involving adults with SARS. The outcomes of the studies were the duration of
fever, total peripheral blood WBC, time of the lung lesions subsided obviously, adverse
effects, WBC counts, platelet counts, serum globulin, the incidence of nosocomial
infection, the risk of death, survival probability and the progression of disease cascade. In
all studies IVIG was used before or in combination with other drugs and treatment (such
as antibiotics, glucocorticoids, antivirals, oxygen therapy). The IVIG dose and duration
of use differed across studies.
Risk of bias for included studies
We found a high risk of bias in random sequencing, allocation concealment and
blinding in the only included RCT. All case series had a moderate risk (score 4 to 5 out
of 8), one case report meeting 8 of the 8 items of the JBI quality appraisal tool (Table
1).
Quality of the evidence
The quality of evidence for all outcomes assessed in the only included RCT was graded
low (Table 2), primarily due to serious risk of bias and imprecision. As we included
four case series, we judged that reporting a 'GRADE evidence profile' would not be
meaningful. Overall, the quality of evidence was very low for most outcomes and
cannot thus provide a reliable indication of any likely effect across outcomes.

COVID-19
A case series of 109 adults with COVID-19 reported that most patients used antibiotics
and antiviral treatment, and over half of the patients were given glucocorticoid therapy
and IVIG. The survival probability of patients with ARDS could not be improved by
antiviral, glucocorticoid, or immunoglobulin treatment. The risk of death was not
associated with the use of IVIG in the patients with ARDS (31).A case report of three
adults with COVID-19 reported that a high dose IVIG (25 g/d for 5 days) administered
at the appropriate point could successfully block the progression of disease cascade
(result of the clinical symptoms, laboratory inspection indicators and chest CT scan),
and finally improve the outcome of COVID 19 (32).
SARS
The incidence of nosocomial infection and the risk of death
The randomized controlled trial of 44 adults with severe SARS found no significant
difference in the risk of death (18.1% vs. 23.8%) or the incidence of nosocomial
infection (65.2% vs. 52.4%) between adults treated either with IVIG or with
conventional treatment. And there was no significant difference in the incidence of
nosocomial infection between ALI (50.0% vs. 38.5%) and ARDS (81.8% vs. 75.0%)
patients (36).
Laboratory inspection
One case series reported the patients with SARS who did not receive steroids for severe
hemocytopenia had increased WBC counts and platelet counts after undergoing IVIG
(34). Another case series reported the children with persistent fever who were given

IVIG had significantly improved total peripheral blood WBC after undergoing IVIG
(33). The included RCT showed the serum globulin increased slightly in the IVIG group,
but decreased in the conventional treatment group, the difference was not significant
(36).
The duration of fever
One case series included ten children with persistent fever who were given IVIG. The
body temperature ranged between 38.4℃ and 40℃ at baseline and the duration of
fever was 1 to 4 days after IVIG (33).
Imaging testing
One case series reported that chest radiographs in children who were given IVIG
showed more patchy focal asymmetric infiltrative shadows, more rapid time of the lung
lesions subsided obviously than in a randomly selected, age- and sex-matched control
group of 20 children without IVIG (33).
Adverse effects
One case series reported no adverse effects associated with IVIG , when IVIG was used
in the patients who had high fever or other obvious poisoning symptoms, who were in
the early stage of the disease, who were treated with glucocorticoids,

or whose white

blood cell counts below 3.0 ×109 /L (35).

Discussion
We only found limited evidence about the use of IVIG to treat children or adults with
severe COVID-19. Since SARS and COVID-19 belong to the same family of viruses,

we used IVIG treatment of SARS as indirect evidence, even though the quality of the
included studies was generally low. The results were also inconsistent, and no benefit
was found in the only identified randomized controlled trial.
An earlier systematic review of treatment effects with SARS concluded that
although four studies suggested an improvement in the patients’ condition after IVIG
treatment, more controlled trials are needed to provide evidence of the potential benefits
on IVIG against SARS. The results of the review are roughly in line with our findings,
more high-quality evidence about the benefits and disadvantages of IVIG for
COVID-19 and SARS are needed (37).
There was no apparent benefit from IVIG, despite it being used to treat other
respiratory infections. A meta-analysis of seven RCTs in children aged less than three
years with respiratory syncytial virus infection found no evidence of differences
between children treated with immunoglobulin or with placebo in the risk of death
(RR=0.87, 95% CI: 0.14,5.27) or serious adverse events (RR=1.08, 95% CI: 0.65,1.79),
or in the duration of hospitalization (MD=-0.70, 95% CI: -1.83,0.42) (38). SARS
belongs to the category of systemic inflammatory response syndromes (SIRS), and
severe SARS often manifests as ALI, ARDS and progresses to severe sepsis (39,40).
The course of COVID-19 may also be similar. A meta-analysis of nine RCTs showed
that IVIG did not reduce the mortality (OR=0.95, 95% CI: 0.80,1.13), length of hospital
stay (MD=-4.08, 95% CI: -6.47,-1.69]), or the risk of death or major disability before
two years of age (RR=0.98,95% CI: 0.88,1.09]) in infants with suspected or confirmed

infection, compared with placebo or no intervention (41).
IVIG is prepared from pools of plasma obtained from several thousand healthy
blood donors. Unlike convalescent plasma from patients with COVID-19, IVIG does
not contain SARS-Cov-2 neutralizing antibody (42,43). The review showed that there
was no evidence that IVIG has an effect on anti-MERS-CoV, or that IVIG would cause
kidney failure or thrombosis in patients with MERS (44). IVIG could increase the risk
of vaccination delay. A study by National Advisory Committee on Immunization and
the American Advisory Committee on Immunization showed a delay of five months of
varicella vaccine in patients who received IVIG and varicella immune globulin (VZIG)
(45). IVIG may increase the risk of infections transmitted by transfusion (42). Some
adverse effects, such as thrombosis, aseptic meningitis, hemolysis, and renal failure, are
mainly associated with the use of high-dose IVIG (46).
The condition, dose and duration of IVIG were inconsistent between studies, the
efficacy, and the associated adverse effects remain unclear. The first severe case of
COVID-19 in children in China took IVIG with a dose of 400 mg/kg for a duration of
five days (8). The recommended dosage of IVIG for children with severe COVID-19
was also inconsistent in different guidelines, including 1.0g/kg/d for 2 days, or
400mg/kg/d for 5 days, 0.2g/kg/d for 3~5 days, or 1~2g/kg for 2~3 days (47-49).
Therefore, it is particularly important and urgent to study the benefits and disadvantages
of IVIG treatment in children with COVID-19. It is promising that a trial addressing
efficacy and safety of IVIG therapy in patients with severe or critical COVID-19

disease has been registered on (50). Randomized, double-blinded, large sample,
multicenter clinical trials on children are urgently needed for getting scientific evidence
to support clinical decision-making.
Strength and limitations
This is the first systematic review of IVIG treatment for children with COVID-19.
There are several limitations in this systematic review. First, the use of glucocorticoids
or a combination of a variety of broad-spectrum antibiotics before IVIG may lead to
changes in the microecology of the body, affect the immune regulation function, and
thus also affect the effect of IVIG. Second, the total sample size of this study was
insufficient to make strong conclusions, and the quality of the methodology was
generally low which affect the certainty of the results. Finally, we may have missed
some studies as we only included studies published in Chinese and English.

Conclusion
There is no direct evidence for IVIG in children with COVID-19, current evidence is
insufficient to assess the effectiveness and safety of IVIG for children with severe
COVID-19. Therefore, we cannot suggest use of IVIG for the treatment of COVID-19
in children. More clinical studies to address this topic are needed.
