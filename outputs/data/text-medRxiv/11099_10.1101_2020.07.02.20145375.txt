Abstract
Background: Lethality rates of COVID-19 are so different between countries and
continents. This lethality seems to be very low in Africa and Asia, but exceedingly
high in western Europe and North America. Many factors could have a role in this
disparity such as comorbidities. Advanced age, obesity, cardiovascular disease,
diabetes and cancer were the most frequently cited in the reported COVID-19 data.
The main objective was to analyze and evaluate the association between the COVID19 mortality and the mentioned factors in 164 countries.
Methods: The Data of COVID-19 deaths, latitude degrees, population age
distribution, cardiovascular diseases, obesity, diabetes and cancer were extracted
from different online sources. For the statistical analysis, we used Spearman to
measure the correlation coefficient between numbers of deaths and the mentioned
factors until June 29, 2020.

Results: The correlation between COVID-19 mortality and latitude, high age, obesity,
CVD and number of cancer patients per 100,000 is significant at 0.01 level with r =
0.489, r=0.511, r=0.489, r=0.561 and r=0.536 respectively. The correlation between
the number of deaths and diabetes is less strong than the previous ones, and the
correlation coefficient is r= 0.154.
Conclusion: The great lethality of COVID-19 in western Europe and North America
can be explained in part by the highest of age, cancer and CVD percentage in these
regions. It seems also plausible that the increased obesity in the USA and vitamin D
deficiency in Europe may contribute to increasing the number of COVID-19 deaths.

Keywords: COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; Risk Factors; Mortality.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has spread
rapidly through China and the rest of the world. SARS-CoV-2 shares some
characteristics with two other coronaviruses: severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (SARS-CoV) appeared in 2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome
(MERS-CoV) appeared in 2012. COVID-19 had affected over 10 million people and
killed more than 500,000 in over 200 countries worldwide as of 29 June 2020
[1,2].

According to the clinical data, some patients with COVID-19 developed acute

respiratory distress syndrome and part of them worsened in a short period and died
of multiple organ failure.
Researchers have emphasized that patients at risk for severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 have been characterized as having advanced
age or preexisting diseases, like obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer or

chronic respiratory disease (A1). In [3], the presented data support that diabetes
should be considered as a risk factor for a rapid progression and bad prognosis of
COVID-19 and in case of rapid deterioration, more intensive attention should be paid
to diabetic patients. In addition, data from Italy showed more than two-thirds of those
who died by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) had
diabetes [4]. Since obesity has been shown to increase vulnerability to infections, it
may be a risk factor for COVID19related mortality [5]. The Seattle region was
among the first to report body mass index (BMI) data, and a sample has showed that
85% of patients with obesity required mechanical ventilation and 62% of patients with
obesity died. These proportions are greater than those in patients without obesity, in
which 64% required mechanical ventilation and 36% died [6]. Cardiovascular disease
is mentioned as one of the most common comorbidities. In Chinese report from 138
hospitalized COVID19 patients, 14.5% had cardiovascular disease [7]. Another
study on 99 hospitalized patients in China showed that 40% of the cohort had
cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease [8]. Cancer can be also a risk factor of
COVID-19. In fact, a study of small sample size of SARS-CoV-2 patients reported a
higher risk of severe events in patients with cancer when compared with patients
without cancer [9]. A multicenter study including 105 patients with cancer and 536
noncancer patients infected with COVID-19 confirmed also that the COVID-19
patients with cancer had higher risks in all severe outcomes. Patients with
hematologic cancer, lung cancer, or with metastatic cancer (stage IV) had the highest
frequency of severe events [10].
The lethality rates of COVID-19 are very different between countries and
continents. This lethality seems to be very low in Africa, Asia and in some South
America countries, and high in western Europe and North America. In this work, we

analyze and evaluate the association between the deaths number of COVID-19 and
of the mentioned risk factors in 164 countries.

Method
The Data of COVID-19 of the studied countries were mainly obtained from
Worldometers [1] and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control [2], as of
29 June 2020. The percentage of obese adults were gathered from the procon.org
organization [11] and the percentage of the diabetic population aged between 20 to
79 years were collected from the Index Mundi database [12].

In the other side, the

standardized incidence rates of all cancers (per 100,000) were obtained from the
Global cancer observatory [13] and the percentages of cardiovascular diseases were
extracted from the Global Health Data Exchange (GHDx) database [14]. Finally, the
percentage of the population having more than 55 years and latitude degrees are
available from [15, 16].
This study involves 164 countries around the world. Indeed, we have included
all countries whose data on COVID-19 mortality, population age distribution, CVD,
obesity, diabetes and cancer are available (see Appendix). As the data were not
normally distributed, we used the Spearman test for correlation analysis between the
numbers of deaths of COVID-19 per 1 million population in the studied countries and
the mentioned factors. Spearman's correlation assesses monotonic relationships
whether linear or not [17], and it doesn't depend on the sample sizes and
distributions of the variables. The Spearman’s correlation between two variables is
low when observations have a dissimilar rank between the two variables, and high
when observations have a similar rank between the two variables. In the case of no

repeated data values, a perfect correlation of +1 or −1 is obtained when each of the
variables is a perfect monotone function of the other.

Results
Fig. 1 (a) represents the COVID-19 mortality per million as a function of the
latitude degrees. It can be seen that all countries that locate below 35 degrees North
have relatively low mortality and they have low than 300 deaths per million
population. The correlation between mortality and latitude is r = 0.489 (see Table 1).
The distribution of COVID-19 mortality versus high age (55 years and over) is plotted
in Fig. 1 (b). The number of deaths correlates positively and significantly with high
age (r = 0.511). Indeed, the countries with a high number of aged people have the
highest deaths number.
Except for Australia and New Zealand, the countries with a high number of
cancer patients have the highest deaths number (Fig. 1(c)). The correlation is
positive between the number of deaths and number of cancer patients per 100,000
(r = 0.591). In the other side, the association between the deaths number and CVD
percentage is strong and the correlation coefficient is r = 0,56 (at 0.01 level).

The

distribution of CVD is presented in (Fig. 1(d)).
Fig. 1 (e) and Fig. 1 (g) represent the number of deaths versus the percentage
of obesity and diabetes, respectively. The association between obesity and the
number of deaths is significant with r=0.489. However, the association between
diabetes and the number of deaths is less strong than the previous ones with r=
0,154.

The lethality rates of COVID-19 are very different between countries and
continents. This lethality seems to be high in western Europe and North America
compared to others countries. This North-South difference may be due to several
factors. Firstly, the correlation between the number of mortality and latitude degrees
can be explained by the vitamin D deficiency, which associated with increased risk
and greater severity of COVID-19 [18]. Indeed, thirty-five degrees North also happens
to be the latitude above which people do not receive sufficient sunlight to maintain
adequate vitamin

D levels during

winter.

In

Europe, the prevalence of

hypovitaminosis D is high, but it is relatively uncommon in Nordic countries, probably
due to the widespread use of supplements [19], which can explain that the mortality
is relatively low in these countries. This correlation can be also explained by the
existing of the high prevalence of the elderly population in western Europe and North
America. Older people are more likely to develop risk factors and severe health
consequences from COVID-19 [20].
Secondly, the percentage of CVD is high in western Europe and North of
America, which explains the significant association between mortality and the
percentage of CVD. Indeed, CVD patients are more likely to be infected due to their
deteriorated heart function. In fact, pre-existing CVD heightens the vulnerability to
develop COVID-19 and to have more severe disease with worse clinical outcomes
and prognosis [21].
The incidence rate of all cancers remains also high in western Europe and
North of America, which provides a significant correlation with the mortality rate.
Cancer patients are at high risk for infections due to coexisting chronic diseases,
overall weakened health status, and systemic immunosuppressive states caused by
both cancer and anticancer treatments [22]. As a consequence, cancer patients

infected by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus may experience more difficult outcomes
than other populations.
The correlation between the mortality of COVID-19 and obesity was
significant. Even if the obesity prevalence in Europe is not the highest in the world,
but it remains high in the North of America. In fact, obesity is characterized by chronic
inflammation associated with a decreased immune system, leading to susceptibility to
infection [23]. Additionally, patients with obesity show a restrictive breathing pattern
and reduced lung volume. This evidence suggests that obesity might act as an
independent risk factor for a poor disease progression of COVID-19.
Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common chronic diseases and one of the
leading causes of morbidity worldwide [24]. Several studies have demonstrated that
diabetics have high susceptibility to some infectious diseases, like Mycobacterium
tuberculosis and Staphylococcus aureus [25]. However, the correlation between
diabetes and mortality is not significant and this is due to the lowest of prevalence of
diabetes in western Europe and north America countries.

Conclusion
The computed correlation coefficients between the risk factors and the
mortality numbers of COVID-19 show that the great lethality of COVID-19 in western
Europe and North America can be explained in part by the highest of age, cancer
and CVD prevalence in these regions. It seems also plausible that the increased
obesity in the USA and vitamin D deficiency in Europe may contribute to increasing
the number of COVID-19 deaths. In the other side, the correlation between diabetes
and the number of COVID-19 deaths is not very significant.
