Abstract
This paper presents a data-driven approach for COVID-19 outbreak modeling
and forecasting, which can be used by public policy and decision makers to control the outbreak through Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPI). First, we
apply an extended Kalman filter (EKF) to a discrete-time stochastic augmented
compartmental model to estimate the time-varying effective reproduction number Rt . We use daily confirmed cases, active cases, recovered cases, deceased
cases, Case-Fatality-Rate (CFR), and infectious time as inputs for the model.
Furthermore, we define a Transmission Index (TI) as a ratio between the instantaneous and the maximum value of the effective reproduction number. The
value of TI shows the disease transmission in a contact between a susceptible
and an infectious individual due to current measures such as physical distancing and lock-down relative to a normal condition. Based on the value of TI,
we forecast different scenarios to see the effect of relaxing and tightening public
measures. Case studies in three countries are provided to show the practicability
of our approach.
Keywords: COVID-19, modeling, forecasting, public policy.

1. Introduction
The spread of new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), originating from
Wuhan China, has been worldwide and caused a severe outbreak. The virus has
infected more than 17.5 million people with more than 680 thousand confirmed
5

deaths by the end of July 2020 [1]. The outbreak triggered crisis which is
beyond health crisis and it is expanding into economic and social crisis. The
effect of crisis to the society become a multidimensional problem that need to
be minimized through some measurable public policies [2].
1.1. Motivation

10

Intervention measures are introduced to contain the outbreak and to prevent it continuing to grow and transmitted, such as physical distancing and
lock-down measures [3, 4]. To this extent, a thorough evaluation to implement
available options, has been urgently needed. A quantitative as well as a qualitative evaluations involving key characteristics of COVID-19 outbreak can be

15

conducted based on epidemiological parameters [5]. As the incidence is growing,
a quantitative evaluation to identify a minimum physical distancing policy aims
to control the outbreak transmission in Australia [6], China [7], and Italy [8].
A control measure for the disease’s transmission, known as the time-varying
effective reproduction number Rt , reflects the disease extended transmission

20

with the presence of interventions. Therefore, estimation of the time-varying
effective reproduction number Rt can be used for evaluating implementation
of public policies success [9]. The estimation of Rt based on an epidemiological model, has an important role for an evidence-based policy making. The
importance is also recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) [10].

1.2. Literature review
A deterministic SIR model-based for Rt estimation, assumes that the data
used significantly representing the actual outbreak, was presented in [11]. Different sets of data representing level of quarantine measures, are used in [7]
describing growth of the cases and also the effective reproduction number Rt

30

for each measure’s levels. To accommodate uncertainties in incidence data, noise
is added to the model in [9]. The authors used inputs for the model from daily
new cases, active cases, recovered cases, and deceased cases, to estimate the
spread of the disease and the evaluation is extended to Rt estimation based on
the stochastic model.

35

Based on estimation of Rt , several authors have proposed methods to forecast the evolution of the outbreak. Data-based analysis, modelling, and forecasting based on a Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Deceased (SIRD) model was
presented in [12]. The authors fit the reported data with the SIRD model to
estimate the epidemiological parameters. The main drawback when fitting the

40

model with the data is that the estimated parameters can be unrealistic. In
[13], the authors attempted to use phenomenological models that have been
validated during previous outbreaks. The model is used to generate and assess short-term forecasts of the cumulative number of confirmed reported cases.
However, since COVID-19 is a new virus, the model was not reliable and the

45

forecast can only be used for a very short term. Another authors use analysis of
simple day-lag maps to investigate universality in the epidemic spreading [14].
Their results suggested that simple mean-field models can be used to gather a
quantitative picture of the epidemic spreading. The main drawback is that the
reproduction number is assumed to follow a heuristic continuous model, which

50

may not describe the actual transmission.

1.3. Contribution of this paper
In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach for COVID-19 modeling
and forecasting, which can be used by public policy and decision makers to control the outbreak through Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPI). Considering
55

drawbacks in existing methods, we present two contributions: (i) estimation of
the time-varying effective reproduction number Rt based on real-time data fitting using an extended Kalman filter (EKF), and (ii) short to medium terms
forecasting based on different public policies. As the effective reproduction number Rt shows simply the extent of transmission due to population immunity or

60

intervention in the form of public policy making [9], we propose a new measure
called a Transmission Index (TI) (see Section 2.5), which describe the disease
transmission relative to a normal condition. As well as Rt , the value of TI can
be used to measure the effectiveness of public health measures. Furthermore,
TI is used to forecast different public policy scenarios by relaxing or tightening

65

the current measures.
1.4. Organization of this paper
Briefly, this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we discuss the methods used in evaluating the spread of the disease, including data availability and
reliability, data driven framework, modelling, estimation, and forecasting. Then,

70

discussion about the method and its applications for estimating the Transmission Index in United Arab Emirate (UAE), Australia, and Denmark, is presented
in Section 3. Lastly, the conclusion is in Section 4.

2. Methods
In this section, we describe the data-driven modeling and forecasting ap75

proach that can be used by public policy and decision makers to control COVID19 pandemic through NPI. We acknowledge no country knows the total number

of people infected with COVID-19, partially due to lack of testing and undetected asymptomatic cases. Thus, the presented approach can only be used for
country/region/area that have performed mass testing with laboratory confir80

mation. To this end, we assume the difference between the actual case and the
reported case is minimized when mass testing has been conducted.
2.1. Data availability and reliability
The COVID-19 pandemic generates a large amount of data. Typically,
the government officials reported daily confirmed cases, active cases, recov-

85

ered cases, and deceased cases (see Table 1). These data are available for
almost all countries and regions and can be accessed by the public through
online websites. Some websites, such as https://www.worldometers.info and
https://ourworldindata.org/, also provide information regarding the number of test per capita. The data can be utilized to obtain important epidemio-

90

logical parameters such as the time-varying effective reproduction numbers Rt ,
which can be used by the decision and public policy makers.

Table 1: A typical time-series data generated during the pandemic.

Unfortunately, not all countries/regions have the ability to provide mass
testing for their citizen. The WHO advised governments that the positivity
rate (i.e., out of all tests conducted, how many came back positive for COVID95

19) should remain at 5% or lower for at least 14 days [1]. Rich countries such
as the UAE, Australia, and Denmark have successfully achieved this target.

2.2. Data-driven framework
The reported cases from the pandemic are used for two purposes: (i) to
estimate the time-varying effective reproduction number Rt , and (ii) to project
100

the number of active case, recovered case, deceased case, and total case, which
are important to prepare for the healthcare systems.

Figure 1: Data-driven framework of COVID-19 pandemic.

In Figure 1, S denotes susceptible case data. Assuming constant population,
S can be obtained by subtracting the number of population with the number
of active, recovered, and deceased cases. The active case data I is the number
105

of people who are currently infected. R and D denote the cumulative number
of recovered and deceased, respectively, while C denotes the number of daily
confirmed cases. To model uncertainty in the reported cases, we add white
Gaussian noise. The data is assimilated into a compartmental epidemic model
(see Section 2.3) using an extended Kalman filter (EKF) to obtain the estimate

110

of Rt . Based on this estimate, we perform forecasting for the next 90 days with
different scenarios.
2.3. Mathematical modeling
To model the transmission of the coronavirus, we use a discrete-time stochastic augmented compartmental model presented in [9]. The model consists of six

(6)

The equations (1)-(4) can be obtained from a standard Susceptible-InfectiousRecovered-Deceased (SIRD) model. We augment two equations: equation (5)
takes into account the number of daily confirmed cases C, while equation
(6) says that the effective reproduction number Rt is assumed to be a piece120

wise constant function with jump every one day time interval.

The noise

w1 (k), w2 (k), w3 (k), w4 (k), w5 (k), w6 (k) are used to model the uncertainty.
The discrete-time stochastic augmented compartmental model (1)-(6) has
three constant parameters: the number of population N , the recovery rate γ,
and the death rate κ. The recovery and death rates are depend on infectious
125

time Ti and Case-Fatality-Rate (CFR), and are given by

γ=

(7)

The infectious time is obtained from clinical data. For COVID-19, the infectious
period on average lasts for 9 days with standard deviation of 3 days [15]. The
CFR is unknown and need to be estimated. However, to simplify the calculation,
in this paper we assume the CFR is equal to the last data of the number of
130

deceased case divided by the total infected case. To account for under-reported

case, this estimate can be divided by a correction factor c, e.g.,

CFR =

1 D(kf )
,
c I(kf )

(8)

where kf denotes the index for the latest data. In our example in Section 3, we
assume the under-reported case is 3 times larger that the reported case. Thus,
we take c = 4.

2.4. Estimation of Rt
The time-varying effective reproduction number Rt is estimated by applying
EKF to the discrete-time stochastic augmented compartmental model (1)-(6).
The details regarding the implementation can be found in [9]. The algorithm has
two tuning parameters: the covariance of the process noise Q and the covariance
of the observation noise R, which can be chosen such that the Root Mean Square
Error (RMSE) between the reported and estimated data is minimized. The EKF
serves as a real-time data fitting. The EKF will estimate any new data that
is recorded. Once this estimation process works, the EKF will also produce an
estimate of Rt from (6).

Figure 2 shows results from implementing EKF to (1)-(6) using data from
the United Arab Emirates (UAE). It can be observed that the EKF is able to
estimate the active, recovered, deceased, and daily confirmed cases accurately.
This data fitting process produces an estimate of Rt based on correlation in the
model (1)-(6).

2.5. Forecasting
Forecasting are done for different scenarios. To this end, we define a Transmission Index (TI) as

TI(k) =

Rt (k)
.
Rmax

t

(9)

Figure 3 shows an example of different value of TI to simulate different public
measure strategies. In this case, we draw a straight line perturbed by a white
155

Gaussian noise between the current TI (at blue vertical line) with a designated
TI (after 90 days). The noise is added to simulate fluctuation in the reported
cases. The designated TI corresponds to actions to be taken by the decision or
public policy makers. In this example, the designated TI are from 15% to 90%.
The 30-day average of TI (plotted in black line) represents the value of TI due

160

to current public measures. Here, the 30-day average of TI is at 51%. If the
public measures are relaxing, the value of TI could go from 51% to 75% or 90%.
Vice verse, if the public measures are tightening, the value of TI could go from
51% to 35% or 15%. Based on different value of TI, we use the discrete-time
compartmental model (1)-(5) to forecast the outcome of different scenarios.

175

the percentage of symptomatic COVID-19 cases reported in UAE using case
fatality ratio estimates is at 98% (86%-100% of 95% credible interval).
The first confirmed cases were reported on 29 January, from an infected
family of four who came to the country on holiday from Wuhan [18, 19]. As
the number of positive cases steadily increased, the government took immediate

180

public measures, such as the closure of schools and universities across the country until the end of the academic year in June (announced on 3 March) [20],
the suspension of prayers at mosques and all other places of worship from 16
March including the whole month of Ramadan [21], as well as night curfews for
disinfection on 26 March for an extended period of time that limited movements

185

within the country [22].
The extreme measures together with the government’s wider National Screening Programme, which seeks to test as many people as possible with the aims to
identify, isolate and treat patients as quickly as possible, yielded positive results
in the decrease of the reproduction number almost immediately afterwards, see

190

Figure 4. On 18 May the government announced the first day where the number
of recoveries surpasses the number of new cases found [23]. In the third week
of May, the daily new cases reached its peak and the reproduction number was
already below the threshold value Rt = 1.

Figure 4: The time-varying effective reproduction number Rt in UAE.

With the current TI at 31%, our forecast shows that the daily cases will
be steadily decreasing, see Figure 5. As restrictions in the country ease, it
is important to main safety and preventive measures. Public negligence can
increase the TI, which can trigger a second wave of infection in the country.

3.2. Australia
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Australia was found on January
200

2020 when a traveller was back to Victoria from Wuhan, China. The number of
incidence passed 1000 on March 2020 and doubled after three days. The growth
of incidence during March and April is considered as the first wave of pandemic
with Rt = 3 (see Figure 6). The effects of pandemic in health sectors started to
reach other sectors such as trade, travel, economic and finance and an intensive

205

interventions to prevent the pandemic from growing have been done [6].
The Australian Government closed the borders to all non-residents and noncitizens on 20 March 2020 and applied a 14-day self isolation for all arrivals.
Quarantine/lock-down related policy such as physical distancing or self-isolation
policy has been applied in the form of school and workplace closure, mass gath-

210

ering cancellation, contact tracing, etc. Also all the non-essential services have
been stopped to maximize the physical distancing. The policy is applied for the
next three months [24].
The effect of the interventions are indicated by the fall of Rt < 1 in April,
where the number of new cases dropped from 350 to 20 cases per day, as shown

215

by Figure 6.

Figure 6: The time-varying effective reproduction number Rt in Australia.

As the quarantine related policy is lifted in the beginning of June after a
slow rate of infection (Rt < 1) for three months, there has been a rise in the
number of positive cases. This makes the Australian Government applies the
policy softer in order to prevent not only higher cases in the second wave but
220

also reducing a long-term impact to other than health sector. Australia TI by
27 July was 62% and its short-term projection shows that the active cases will
increase sharply if there is no further interventions. The number of recovered
and deceased cases will increase in the next 90. The short-term projection is
shown in Figure 7.

3.3. Denmark
Denmark confirmed its first case on 27 of February, when a man who had
been skiing in Lombardy in Italy returned to Denmark. Denmark introduced
lock-down on 13 of March, by ordering people who are working in non-essential
functions in the public sector to stay at home for two weeks. Furthermore,

230

kindergarten, primary and secondary schools, universities, libraries, indoor cultural institutions and similar places were closed. Assemble more than ten people
in public became illegal.
The effect of the lock-down can be observed after three weeks, when Rt < 1.
A very slow and gradual reopening has been initiated on 15 of April, by opening

235

nurseries, kindergartens, and primary schools, However, the government will reenforce lock-down if there are indications that the number of infections increases
too fast. Universities are open only for employees, while all courses will be given
online. At the end of July, there is an increase in the number of infected people,
possibly due to the summer holiday. However, the government has not enforced

240

any restriction.

Denmark TI by 27 July was 20%. A short-term projection shows the number
of active cases will steady under the current measures. The number of recovered
individuals will increase, while the number of death will decrease significantly.

4. Conclusion
245

We present a data-driven approach for modeling and forecasting of COVID19 outbreak for public policy making. The method relies on the quality of the
data. Thus, the the estimated Rt and the forecast results need to be carefully
interpreted when the number of testing is not sufficient. By estimating the
Transmission Index (TI), our approach can be used for short to medium terms

250

forecast based on policy to be taken by the decision makers. The forecast
can be used to predict the course of COVID-19 including a probability of the
upcoming second wave. Simulation results using data from three countries show
our approach gives reasonable forecasts.
