Abstract
Background: Japan started vaccinations for COVID-19 in late February, 2021, mainly
using BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 Vaccine.
Object: We evaluated COVID-19 vaccination effects on infectiousness in Japan.
Method: The effective reproduction number R(t) was regressed on vaccine coverage
along with data of temperature, humidity, mobility, and countermeasures. We presumed
two definitions for vaccine coverage: at least a single dose with a 12-day delay and a
second dose. The study period was February, 2020 through May 16, 2021.
Results: Estimation results indicate that vaccine coverage significantly and drastically
reduced R(t) for both definitions. Results imply that increased first shot coverage by 1%
point decreased R(t) by 0.5 with a 12 day delay. Moreover, increased second shot
coverage by 1% point, decreased R(t) by 1 immediately.
Discussion and Conclusion: Vaccination effects might be stronger because the periods
when vaccination was started and rapid spread coincide with a decreasing phase of R(t).

Introduction
Wide coverage of COVID-19 vaccination has changed the outbreak situation in
European countries and US. Unfortunately, vaccination started only in February, 2021 in
Japan, among the latest of starting dates in economically developed countries. As of
June 6, 2021, the rate of completion for two shots was only about 3% in Japan (Figure
1) [1,2].
Fortunately, prevalence of COVID-19 has been much lower in Japan than in
European countries and the US. For instance, prevalence in the US was approximately
10% as of June 6, 2021, but only 0.6% in Japan, which had used no lock down.
Although reasons for such differences remain unknown, vaccine efficacy in Japan might
be different from efficacy in US and European countries.
Moreover, vaccination has provided not only personal protection, but also herd
immunity to unvaccinated persons. The former was investigated in clinical trials [3], but
the latter might depend on the surrounding society. Therefore, the present study
examined vaccine effectiveness, including herd immunity in Japan. To measure the
vaccine effectiveness, we estimated the effects of vaccine coverage on SARS-CoV-2
infectiousness in Japan.
As countermeasures against the COVID-19 outbreak in Japan, school closure and
voluntary event cancellation were adopted from February 27, 2020 through the end of

March. Large commercial events were cancelled. Subsequently, a state of emergency
was declared for April 7 through 25 May, stipulating voluntary restrictions against
leaving home. Consumer businesses such as retail shops and restaurants were shut down.
During this period, the first peak of infection was reached on April 3. Infections
subsequently decreased until July 29. The so-called “Go To Travel Campaign” (GTTC)
started on July 22 as a 50% subsidized travel program aimed at supporting sightseeing
businesses with government-issued coupons for use in shopping at tourist destinations.
It was expected that the campaign might expand the outbreak. Thereafter, GTTC
continued to the end of December, by which time a third wave of infection had emerged.
The third wave in December, which was larger than either of the preceding two waves,
reached its highest peak at the end of December. Therefore, GTTC was inferred as the
main reason underlying the third wave [4].
To force the third wave lower, the second emergency status was declared on
January 8, 2021 to March 15, 2021. However, the fourth wave emerged, probably
because of the spread of variant strains at the end of February. Moreover, to support the
hosting of the Olympics and Paralympics games in Tokyo in July, a third emergency
state was declared on April 25, 2021.

Nevertheless, although results have been mixed, some results of earlier studies
suggest that COVID-19 might be associated with climate conditions [5–8]. If that were
true for Japan, then GTTC might not be the main reason for the third wave.
Moreover, mobility was inferred as the main cause of the outbreak dynamics, at
least in the first wave in Japan [9] and throughout the world [10–13]. This study was
conducted to estimate vaccine coverage effects on SARS-CoV-2 infectiousness for the
outbreak in Japan.

Methods
The numbers of symptomatic patients reported by the Ministry of Health, Labour
and Welfare (MHLW) for January 14 – May 16, published [14] as of June 6, 2021 were
used. Some patients were excluded from data for Japan: those presumed to be persons
infected abroad or infected as Diamond Princess passengers. Those patients were
presumed not to represent community-acquired infection in Japan. For some
symptomatic patients with unknown onset dates, we estimated onset dates from an
empirical distribution with duration extending from onset to the report date among
patients for whom the onset date had been reported.
Onset dates among patients who did not report this information and reporting delay

were adjusted using the same procedures as those used for our earlier research [15,16].
As described hereinafter, we estimated the onset dates of patients for whom onset dates
had not been reported. Letting f(k) represent this empirical distribution of incubation
period and letting Nt denote the number of patients for whom onset dates were not
published and available at date t, then the number of patients for whom the onset date
was known is t-1. The number of patients with onset date t-1 for whom onset dates were
not available was estimated as f(1)Nt. Similarly, patients with onset date t-2 and for
whom onset dates were not available were estimated as f(2)Nt. Therefore, the total
number of patients for whom the onset date was not available, given an onset date of s,
was estimated as Σk=1f(k)Ns+k for the long duration extending from s.
Moreover, the reporting delay for published data from MHLW might be
considerable. In other words, if s+k is larger than that in the current period t, then s+k
represents the future for period t. For that reason, Ns+k is not observable. Such a
reporting delay engenders underestimation of the number of patients. For that reason, it
must be adjusted as Σk=1t-sf(k)Ns+k /Σk=1t-sf(k). Similarly, patients for whom the onset
dates were available are expected to be affected by the reporting delay. Therefore, we
have Ms|t /Σk=1t-sf(k), where Ms|t represents the reported number of patients for whom
onset dates were period s as of the current period t.

We defined R(t) as the number of infected patients on day t divided by the number
of patients who were presumed to be infectious. The number of infected patients was
calculated from the epidemic curve by the onset date using an empirical distribution of
the incubation period, which is Σk=1f(k)Et+k, where Et denotes the number of patients for
whom the onset date was period t. The distribution of infectiousness in symptomatic
and asymptomatic cases g(k) was assumed to be 30% on the onset day, 20% on the
following day, and 10% for the subsequent five days [17]. Then the number of
infectiousness patients was Σk=1g(k)Et-k. Therefore, R(t) was defined as

Σk=1f(k)Et+k/Σk=1g(k)Et-k.
We use average temperature and relative humidity data for Tokyo during the day as
climate data because national average data were not available. We obtained data from
the Japan Meteorological Agency
(https://www.data.jma.go.jp/gmd/risk/obsdl/index.php). We identified several
remarkable countermeasures in Japan: two emergency status declarations, GTTC, and
school closure and voluntary event cancellation (SCVEC). The latter, SCVEC, extended
from February 27 through March: this countermeasure required school closure and
cancellation of voluntary events, and even of private meetings. Then the first state of
emergency was declared April 7. It ceased at the end of May. It required voluntary

restriction against going out, school closures, and shutdown of businesses. To subsidize
travel and shopping at tourist destinations, GTTC started on July 22. It was halted
temporarily at the end of December. The second state of emergency was declared on
January 7, 2021 for the 11 most affected prefectures. This countermeasure required
restaurant closure at 8:00 p.m., with voluntary restrictions against going out, but did not
require school closure. It continued until March 21, 2021. The third state of emergency
was declared on April 25, 2021 for four prefectures: Tokyo, Osaka, Hyogo, and Kyoto.
Later, the application areas were extended gradually, but never covered the entirety of
Japan.
To clarify associations among R(t) and vaccine coverage as well as climate,
mobility, and countermeasures, we regressed the daily R(t) on dummy variables for
daily vaccine coverage, daily climate, mobility, and countermeasures using ordinary
least squares regression. Temperatures were measured in degrees Celsius, humidity, and
mobility as percentages in regression, not as standardized. When some variables were
found to be not significant, we excluded them and estimated the regression line again. If
some variables were not significant in the full specification estimation, then we
estimated them again stepwisely without those non-significant variables.
We examine two definitions for vaccine coverage: rate of receiving at least a single

dose with a 12 day delay and the completion rate of the second dose. Delay in the
former was the response period for increasing antibody [18]. If a vaccine protects the
recipient from infection perfectly, the estimated coefficient of vaccine coverage should
be 0.01 if one assumes an average of R(t) with no vaccination in the study period. That
means that increasing vaccine coverage by 1% point was expected to reduce R(t) by 1%
point. If the estimated coefficients of vaccine coverage were smaller than 0.01, then it
might reflect imperfect personal prevention. Conversely, if the estimated coefficients of
vaccine coverage were smaller than 0.01, it might mean that herd immunity contributed
to prevention from infection among non-recipients.
We also examined another delay in vaccine coverage to verify robustness. We
found 14 days of delay in the first dose and 7 days of delay in the second dose. We
adopted 5% as the level at which to infer significance.

Results
Figure 2 presents an empirical distribution of the duration of onset to reporting in
Japan. The maximum delay was 31 days. Figure 3 presents an empirical distribution of
incubation periods among 91 cases for which the exposed date and onset date were
published by MHLW in Japan. The mode was six days. The average was 6.6 days. The

calculated R(t) is shown in Figure 1.
Table 1 presents estimation results of two definitions of vaccine coverage to R(t). In
both definitions, climate conditions and the third emergency status were not significant
in specifications (1) and (3). Therefore, we deleted these variables as explanatory
variables. All remaining variables in the specification (2) and (4) were significant.
Mobility was positive and significant. The first two emergency status periods and
GTTC were found to be negative and significant. However, SCVEC was found to be
significant and positive. Vaccine coverage was significantly negative, as expected.
However, its estimated coefficients were approximately 0.5 in the specification (2) and
one in the specification (4). These were 50–100 times larger than expectations from
personal prevention.
Another definition adopted for the delay period until sufficiently increasing
antibodies to protect from infection yielded similar results to those presented above. The
estimated coefficients for vaccine coverage were -0.44365 (p-value was 0.000) for the
first doze with 14 days delay and
delay.

Discussion

-0.97141 (0.000) for the second doze with 7 days

Estimation results showed that vaccine coverage was significantly negative and that
the estimated coefficients were far larger than expected from personal prevention. That
finding might mean that herd immunity strongly reduced R(t). However, it might be
biased by a shorter period with vaccine in Japan because the period at which vaccination
was started and spread rapidly coincided with the decreasing phase of R(t). Vaccination
effects might more strongly incorporate another effect to reduce R(t), but might not be
included as explanatory variables.
Because we presumed a linear function of vaccine coverage and presumed that the
estimated coefficients were larger than expected, the predicted R(t) is expected to be
negative. That result was inconsistent with definition of R(t). Therefore, such a linear
association should disappear with increased vaccine coverage. This nonlinearity might
also diminish herd immunity effects.
The third emergency status was not significant. That finding is probably attributable
to overlap of the period of the third emergency and initiation of the vaccine campaign.
Consequently, multicollinearity might occur among these two variables. Actually, if
vaccine coverage is dropped in specification (1) or (3), then the estimated coefficient of
the third emergency status was -0.89263; its p value was 0.000. The value was
comparable to the first two emergency status periods.

The present study has some limitations. First, as described above, effects of vaccine
coverage and estimated herd immunity might be overestimated. Accumulation of the
data will probably resolve this problem.
Secondly, readers must be reminded when interpreting the obtained results that our
obtained results do not indicate causality. This study demonstrated that some association
exists among vaccine coverage and infectiousness. That finding does not necessarily
mean that vaccine coverage reduces infectiousness: it might imply that lower
infectiousness, for instance, an effective reproduction number being smaller than one,
induces people to approach vaccination more enthusiastically.

Conclusion
Because the period when vaccination was started and spread rapidly coincides
closely with the decreasing phase of R(t), vaccination effects might be estimated as
stronger than they actually were. Accumulation of data and longer periods of data might
decrease that misleading effect.
The present study is based on the authors’ opinions: it does not reflect any stance or
policy of their professionally affiliated bodies.
