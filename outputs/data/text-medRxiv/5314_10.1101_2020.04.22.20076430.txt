It is shown that estimates of the effective reproduction number Rt for COVID-19 using standard packages
such as EPIESTIM can be reproduced very accurately using the expression Rt = c(t) c(t − τ) , where c(t) is
the incidence at time t and τ the mean value of the series interval.

with x(t) = r(t) + d(t) . This definition is exactly equivalent
to the expression for the basic reproduction number in a
‘Susceptible-Infectious-Removed’ (SIR) framework, but can
be obviously applied to the observed data without any
reference to a specific model. Calculations with Eq. (1) for
COVID-19, however, disagree with values of Rt computed
from standard packages such as EPIESTIM [4], as seen in Fig.
1.
Part of the reason for the discrepancy is the lack of reliable
r(t) data. For some countries, such as the United Kingdom,
the published cumulative number of recovered people is less
than the cumulative number of deceased individuals, a very
unlikely scenario. Even globally, the sum total of deceased
individuals is a substantial fraction of cured individuals,
which is also highly implausible. Furthermore, there is a
relative time shift between c(t) and x(t) , since the former
includes the incubation time plus the time to develop
symptoms serious enough to be reported. However,
attempting to correct for this relative delay does not improve
the agreement in Fig. 1 in any significant way.
Standard packages do not suffer from the above problems
because they rely only on c(t) data, and therefore are not
affected by systematic errors in r(t) . For these calculations
one requires the infectivity profile of the disease, which is
approximated as the distribution of the standard interval [4].

expect that Rt can be determined as

Effective reproduction number

The effective reproduction number Rt —a fundamental
epidemiological parameter that characterizes the temporal
dynamics of an infectious disease—is notoriously difficult to
determine without detailed modeling[1-6]. During the
ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, daily tallies of the incidence
c(t) (new cases on day t ), recovered r(t) (individuals who

period τ = 5.8 days with a standard deviation of 2.9 days and a
time window of w = 7 days.

mean τ = 4.7 days and standard deviation 2.9 days, from
Ref. [8], are updated daily at [9]. A more recent study finds
τ = 5.8 days, with 44% presymptomatic transmission [10].
The recovery time, on the other hand, is much longer, and
this implies that individuals at advanced stages of the disease
have a very low infectivity. Under these conditions Eq. (1)
cannot be valid, since its denominator should not be x(t) but
the number of people who became infected approximately at
time t − τ . The latter is greater than the former during the
ramp-up phase of the disease, and this explains why the
curve calculated from Eq. (1) shows a higher Rt during this
time. Conversely, the number of people who became
infected at time t − τ is less than x(t) at later stages, and
this explains why the curve calculated from Eq. (1) gives a
lower value of the number of Rt at these times.
The above considerations suggest an alternative definition
of Rt as

Rt =

c(t)
,
c(t − τ)

A POOR-MAN’S APPROACH TO THE EFFECTIVE REPRODUCTION NUMBER

A computation of Rt for different countries using Eq. (2)
with τ = 5.8 days is shown in Figs. 2-5, where it is
compared with calculations of Rt using EPIESTIM for the
same value of τ . Since the c(t) data are quite noisy, a
smooth version cs (t) is used. The smooth cs (t) is computed
using a regularization approach that minimizes the sum of
the mean square deviation between cs (t) and c(t) plus a term
proportional to the square of the second derivative cs′′(t) . The
relative weight of the two terms is controlled by a parameter
λ that is defined as in Eq. 3 of Ref. [11], with the matrices
! taken as the identity matrix. The chosen value was
B and B
λ =100 day4. A comparison between cs (t) and c(t) is shown
in the inset of Fig. 2 for the case of South Korea. The
regularization method has the advantage that it distorts the
shape of a curve less than a typical sliding average, while
being superior to Savitzky-Golay[12] smoothing in terms of
noise reduction. This was important in the context of the
comparison made here between Eq. (2) and the EPIESTIM
package, because artificial shape distortions are eliminated.
For practical applications of Eq. (2), however, a simple 7day running average should suffice.

day and 7 days, respectively. All calculations used τ = 5.8 days,

Effective reproduction number

Two calculations with EPIESTIM were performed, both
with τ = 5.8 days and a standard deviation of 2.9 days. The
first calculation uses a time window w = 1 day, and the
second calculation a time window w =7 days. In the latter
case, the value that appears in the figures at a particular time
t corresponds to the window for which t is the middle point.
The w = 1 day results are very noisy, as expected, but both
EPIESTIM curves are in very good agreement with the
calculations from Eq. (2). It is important to point out that the
incidence data have a significant delay with respect to the
actual time of infection, so that all figures should be
interpreted at representing the situation between one and two
weeks before the dates in the horizontal axes. We made no
attempt to correct for reporting delays as in Ref. [9].
In summary, an extremely simple algorithm has been
introduced that yields effective reproduction numbers very
similar to those obtained from more elaborate approaches as
exemplified by the EPIESTIM package. The latter should
produce more accurate results if the full epidemiological
characteristics of the disease are well known, but for
calculations at the present time when little is known about
COVID-19, the method proposed here is much easier to use
and provides comparable accuracy.
