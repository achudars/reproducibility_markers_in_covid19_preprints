Abstract

As a response to the pandemic caused by SARS-Cov-2 virus, on 15 March, 2020, the Republic of

20

Serbia introduced comprehensive anti-epidemic measures to curb COVID-19. After a slowdown in the

21

epidemic, on 6 May, 2020, the regulatory authorities decided to relax the implemented measures.

22

However, the epidemiological situation soon worsened again. As of 7 February, 2021, a total of 406,352

23

cases of SARSCov-2 infection have been reported in Serbia, 4,112 deaths caused by COVID-19. In order

24

to better understand the epidemic dynamics and predict possible outcomes, we have developed an

adaptive mathematical model SEAIHRDS (S-susceptible, E-exposed, A-asymptomatic, I-infected, H-

1. Introduction

45

On 11 March, 2020, the World Health Organization characterised the disease caused by the

46

novel SARS-Cov-2 virus as a pandemic [1]. The Initial epidemic outbreak in China spread outside the

47

Wuhan area, and subsequently on a global scale. On 6 March, 2020, the first case of the novel

48

coronavirus infection was reported in the Republic of Serbia. Taking into consideration the escalation of

49

the disease and limited effects of the initially implemented measures, the state of emergency was

50

declared throughout the country on 15 March, 2020. Comprehensive anti-epidemic measures (e.g.

51

lockdown of entire country) were introduced in the entire country [2].

52

Due to the absence of specific pharmaceutical intervention, Serbia, like other countries,

53

implemented an anti-epidemic strategy based on physical distancing, school and university closures,

54

reduced number of workers present in the workplaces, closure of places of worship for public religious

55

services, reduced working hours of cafés and restaurants, avoiding mass gatherings, events, sports

56

games, tracing and identification of infected people’s contacts, etc. After a slowdown in the epidemic, as

57

shown in the relevant officially published data, the regulatory authorities decided to relax the introduced

58

measures on 6 May, 2020. However, the epidemiological situation soon worsened again, resulting in the

59

reinstatement of some measures, as well as the introduction of new measures [2]. Although the return of

60

extensive measures has yielded favourable results, the further development of the epidemic is not clear.

61

For these reasons, mathematical modelling has a crucial role in understanding the epidemic and

62

predicting possible outcomes. Modelling is a particularly useful tool for devising strategies for combating

63

the epidemic, capacity planning, and selection of efficient measures, especially in the absence of specific

64

pharmaceutical treatments [3, 4, 5]. Mathematical modelling based on differential equations dates back to

65

the first half of 20 century. In 1927, Kermack and McKendrick developed the basic model of disease

66

transmission consisting of three compartments: susceptible (S), infected (I) and removed (R). The model

67

was based on a connected system of nonlinear differential equations as a special case of the general

68

epidemiological model [6, 7]. Subsequent models, became more complex and adapted to the needs of

69

research [5].

th

70

Since the outbreak of COVID-19, many published papers have dealt with the implementation of

71

mathematical modelling and prediction of possible outcomes of COVID-19 epidemics. Most of these

72

research efforts have been based on the implementation of the SIR (susceptible-infected-removed)

73

model. Many of the other models provide a clear picture of dynamics of COVID-19 spreading, including

74

the overloading of the relevant health systems. For example, Ferguson et al., developed one of the first

75

models for COVID19 simulation, which was, among other things, used to plan the health care resources

76

[8]. Wu et al., developed the SEIR model to examine the dynamics of SARS-Cov-2 transmission from

77

person to person. This model was also used to calculate the basic reproduction number Ro, which we use

78

in this paper as one of the key parameters [9]. The classical SIR model assumes that there is

79

homogenous mixing of infected and susceptible populations and that the total population is constant and

80

does not change over time. Moreover, according to the classical SIR model, there is a monotonous

81

decline in susceptible population towards zero [10]. However, such assumptions are not objective in the

82

case of COVID-19 spreading and they are the basic problem in the modelling of this pandemic. In reality,

83

the human population fluctuates constantly [11]. In order to account for such fluctuation, and better

84

understand the COVID-19 epidemic in the Republic of Serbia, we have employed mathematical modelling

85

of the epidemic using the available data on the characteristics of the disease, such as incubation period,

86

latent period, recovery period, severity of clinical signs, and mortality rate caused by COVID-19.

87

Unlike the classic SIR model, the SEAIHRDS (S-susceptible, E-exposed, A-asymptomatic, I-

88

infected, H-hospitalized, R-recovered, D-dead due to COVID-19 infection, S-susceptible) epidemic model,

89

developed for this research, simulates the spreading of COVID-19 in an open population. Taking into

90

account that the population is constantly changing and that various measures are applied for different

91

strata or subgroups of the population (such as preschool children, children attending primary school, high

92

school students, students, employees, the unemployed and retirees), as well as changes in the intensity

93

of applied measures, we have proposed the use of a model that takes these circumstances into account.

94

Based on input disease parameters taken from scientific literature and specific data related to Serbia, this

95

model simulates daily disease occurrence, including the number of hospitalized patients and cases which

96

require intensive care. The model also predicts the expected number of deaths, as well as hospital

97

capacities necessary to accommodate the patients. It provides a possibility to simulate different scenarios

98

of disease control and intervention measures. Considering the expectations of successful development of

99

the vaccine against COVID-19 in the near future, we added an option to model vaccination of different

100

strata of the population as a set of disease control strategies.

2. Methodology

103

This section presents the research methodology and the proposed model, which were used to

104

predict the further dynamics of the epidemic in Serbia. We also presented the data that were used to

105

model the epidemic, a simulated strategy to combat COVID-19, and a sensitivity analysis.

2.1.

SEAIHRDS mathematical model

108

Classical SEIRDS model divides the population into compartments, i.e. groups, and follows the

109

disease dynamics at all times. The population is divided into the following compartments: the portion of

110

the population susceptible to the infection is denoted by S, those latently infected with SARSCov-2

111

(exposed to) are denoted by E, the infected individuals who are able to spread the disease are denoted

112

by I, the ones recovered from the infection are denoted by R, and those who died due to disease with D.

113

Assuming that individuals mix homogenously, the force of infection λ (the rate at which susceptible

114

persons are infected) is related to per capita contact rate . Also, the risk of infection is closely related to

115

the number of infectious individuals in the population It. It depends on the number of infectious individuals

116

(It) and how frequently they make contacts with other persons. In a situation of homogenous mixing

117

among the population, the force of infection λ can be express as follows:

118

λ(t) = I(t)

119

The change of rates in every compartment per unit time in SEIRDS model is presented in the following

120

series of differential equations:

121

St+1=bNt − StIt− mSt +ωRt

(2)

122

Et+1= StIt – ƒE − mEt

123

It+1=ƒEt – (r+m)It – δIt

124

Rt+1=rIt – (m+ω)Rt

(5)

125

Dt+1= δIt

(6)

126

where ƒ is rate of onset of infectiousness expressed as the reciprocal of the latent infection period, r is

127

the rate at which infectious individuals are recovered, δ is the rate at which infectious individuals die from

128

COVID-19 infection and

129

time t is:

130

Nt = St+ E+ It+ Rt+ Dt+bNt-1-mSt-1

where parameters b and m are per capita daily birth rate and death rate unrelated to COVID-19.

However, considering that implemented anti-epidemic measures against COVID-19 do not have

133

an identical impact on the population’s age subgroups and that COVID-19 pathogenesis varies in different

134

age subgroups, we propose the use of multi-compartment version of standard SEIRDS model. The

135

model, named SEAIHRDS, monitors the dynamics of following compartments: susceptible individuals (S),

136

latently infected with SARSCov-2 (E) (exposed to/presymptomatic), asymptomatic infectious individuals

137

(A), infectious individuals with symptoms/clinically ill (I), hospitalized patients (H), recovered individuals

138

(R), and those who died due to disease (D). In this model the susceptible population was further stratified

139

within the compartment S according to age and occupations. Grouping into various strata was done

140

according to the real age structure of the Republic of Serbia population as follows: pre-school children

141

(ps), elementary school children (es), high school children (hs), college students (cs), unemployed

142

population (ua), employed population (ea), and elderly/retired (r) (Table 1). To simulate the epidemic

143

progression through different population strata-subgroups, we used appropriate, stratum-specific, model

144

parameters and factors of effective contact reduction (anti-epidemic intervention measures - ρ), which

145

were adapted to the relevant population groups: lockdown of the entire country, closures of pre-school,

146

school and college sessions closures, reduced number of workers allowed in the workplaces, work from

147

home, restrictions of mobility of elderly people, etc. During the simulation, we monitored the effects of

148

various levels of contact reduction, ranging from 20% to 75%, taking into account the realistic possibilities

149

of maintaining a minimum work process, functioning of the society and feasibility of such measures.

150

Given that intervention measures, applied in response to the emergence of COVID-19, are not

151

the same for all population strata, homogeneous mixing can be expected only within same population

152

stratum. The rate of effective contacts

153

identical at the level of all strata of the population. Effective contacts are limited by the intensity and types

154

of measures applied and are identical only when it comes to individuals within the same population strata.

155

Furthermore, persons in different population strata become infected at different rates depending on how

156

frequently they interact with other persons in their own subgroup and other subgroups. If we assume that

157

force of infection differs between different strata of population, the equation for the force of infection would

158

be as follows:

159

where λi(t) is force of infection in the ith population strata

160

ith population strata and infectious persons in jth population strata come into effective contact per unit of

161

time, and Ij(t) is the number of infectious persons in jth population strata. Also, in this model the number of

162

recovered and dead is conditioned with different ages and genders.

Determining the herd immunity threshold and control of COVID-19 by vaccination policy

179

Considering the undergoing worldwide efforts to develop a vaccine against COVID-19 and

180

promising results, we extended the model to simulate and analysed the effects of a hypothetical

181

vaccination on the epidemic dynamics, and to estimate the extent of coverage of vaccination which can

182

interrupt the chain of infection. The control of COVID-19 by vaccination means targeting the entire

183

susceptible population with mass vaccination until critical herd immunity achieved. In such situation there

184

is a “race” between the exponential growth of epidemic and mass vaccination. The level of herd immunity

185

threshold (HIT) can be calculated by the following formula: HIT = 1− 1/Ro = (Ro−1)/Ro

186

and the critical vaccination coverage required to achieve herd immunity can be obtained by multiplying

187

herd immunity threshold with reciprocal value of vaccine efficacy, ve:

Most people infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop an immune response followed by the

190

development of specific antibodies between 10 and 21 days after getting infected [12]. Specific IgM and

191

IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 develop 6 to 15 days after the onset of the disease [13-17].

192

According to some studies, the presence of antibodies has been confirmed in less than 40% of the

193

patients within 1 week after the onset of the disease, whereas percentage reaches 100% of subjects 15

194

days after the onset of disease [18]. Although duration of the immune response against CVOVID 19 is still

195

unknown, comparing with other coronaviruses, where immunity wane within 12 to 52 weeks after the first

196

symptoms appear [19, 20], while in the case of SARS-CoV-1 infection the presence of IgG antibodies was

197

confirmed in 90% and 50% of infected patients, respectively, over two and three years, respectively [29],

198

we assumed that durable immunity against COVID-19 is possible [20, 21]. Immunity to HCoVOC43 and

199

HCoV-HKU1 appears to wane appreciably within 1 year [21, 22], whereas SARS-CoV-1 infection can

200

induce longer-lasting immunity [23]. S. F. Lumley et. in a study conducted on 1,246 persons recovered

201

from COVID-19 found no symptomatic re-infections over 6 months [24].

202

Based on these findings, and fact that SARS-Cov-2 virus is also beta coronavirus, we assumed

203

that in the event of the development of a successful vaccine, immunity against the SARS-Cov-2 virus

204

could last for a year, as well as after recovery after a natural infection. In a study conducted to determine

205

the dynamics of SARS-Cov-2 transmission in the post pandemic period, Kissler et al. applied a similar

206

approach in defining the possible length of the immunity period [20].

207

For the purpose of modelling a control strategy based on vaccination, additional compartment to

208

the model was added denoted with V(t), in which there are vaccinated persons who have successfully

209

developed protective immunity after vaccination. The vaccination parameter, υ, is the daily rate of

210

vaccination of susceptible population and it represents the proportion of susceptible population

211

immunized per unite time. The critical daily rate of vaccination, !c is !c = (b+ω)(Ro -1), required to

212

interrupt the infection [5]. The basic reproduction number under the vaccination is Rop = (1-p)Ro. The

213

proportion of effectively protected persons, p, is conditioned by parameter the vaccine efficacy, ve. This

214

parameter represents a proportion of person who successfully developed protective immunity after

215

vaccination, whereas total number of actively protected individuals in time t is V(t) = number of vaccinated

216

x ve [5]. In this compartment the daily rate of waning of immunity at which immunity of vaccinated

217

population fades out is

Model parametrisation
In proposed model,

is per capita effective contact rate at which specific persons come into

227

effective contact per unit of time. An effective contact is defined as a contact sufficient to cause disease

228

transmission [10, 24, 26]. We calculated the parameter

229

by using the formula:

= Ro/NTR

(20)

230

where Ro is a basic reproduction number of the disease, i.e. the average number of newly infected people

231

with COVID-19 (secondary infection cases), infected by one infectious individual in a totally susceptible

232

population, N is total population, and TR is the average duration of infectious period [10, 25, 26]. The R

233

values of 2.46 and 3.1 are adopted from the relevant literature. The Ro values were based on the data

234

obtained during the initial phase of the epidemic in Italy [27]. Since the implemented measures and

235

disease transmission were simulated through various population strata, we corrected the

236

with a relevant, stratum-specific contact reduction factor ρi. In this way, we obtained the per capita contact

237

rate specific for each separate stratum based on following formula

238

i=

(1-ρi).

parameter

(21)

239

The values of the ρi factor in different population strata ranged from 0.25 to 0.75 (effective contact

240

reduction ranged from 25% to 75%).

241

Parameters such as daily birth and death rates were calculated based on the data published by

242

the Office of Statistics of the Republic of Serbia, and data published by the World Bank regarding the life

243

expectancy in the Republic of Serbia [28, 29]. The latter study reported that the life expectancy in Serbia

244

was 79.06 years in 2017 [29]. By using this figure, we expressed the daily death rate as a value reciprocal

245

to life expectancy m = 0.000036. We calculated the daily per capita birth rate of b= 0.000025 based on

246

the figure of 9.2 births in the Republic of Serbia per 1000 people in a year. These estimates were needed

247

to realistically simulate fluctuations of the total population. To simplify the calculations, we assumed that

248

the general morality rate m is applicable for all population strata.

The infectivity rate, i.e. the rate of transfer from compartment E to I, was derived as a value

250

reciprocal to the COVID-19’s average latent period. The data on the average duration of latent infection

251

(ƒ-1) and the average period during which an infected person is shading the SARS-Cov-2 virus (TR) were

252

adopted from the relevant literature as ƒ = 3.5 days [30, 31] and TR = 9.3 days, respectively [30]. Also

253

the data on the percentage of hospitalized patients and those whose therapy requires intensive care,

254

used for prediction of required hospital capacities, as shown in Table 1, were taken from literature [30, 8].

255

Parameters such as δ and r are related to the infectious fatality rate (IFR) for COVID-19 and

256

average times taken from onset of symptoms to death (TD) or recovery (TR). These parameters were

257

calculated using the following formulas:

258

δ = IFRstratum /TD and

(22)

259

r =(1-IFRstratum)/TR

(23)

260

The IFRs, shown in Table 2, were taken from literature and compared with local IFR value which

261

was calculated based on officially registered deaths published by the health system of the Republic of

262

Serbia [2]. The Calculation of local IFR is presented in section 2.4. Population data, (e.g. total population,

263

age structure, and stratification) are presented in Tables 1 and 2. A summary of all model parameters is

264

given in Table 3.

Setting disease control scenarios

267

Five different scenarios were developed for simulating the COVID-19 epidemic control based on

268

non-pharmaceutical interventions. SC1 implies a base-case scenario where the epidemic spreads in

269

susceptible population without any anti-epidemic measures being implemented. In the other scenarios,

270

the extent of contacts was reduced, for each population stratum separately, according to objective

271

possibilities and measures which were implemented during the actual epidemic in the Republic of Serbia.

272

Scenarios are presented in Table 4.

273

The timing of the simulation of anti-epidemic measures, i.e. the reduction of individual contacts

274

corresponds to the actual date when the implementation of measures in the real epidemic in Serbia

275

began (March 15, 2020). Considering that it is not realistic to expect the desired level of reduction of

276

physical contacts to be achieved in one day, in each scenario, a period of gradual introduction of

277

measures was simulated (lag period of 7 days). Since each individual scenario was simulated at R0 of

278

2.46 and 3.10, different contact reduction rates were applied accordingly.

279

Additional four scenarios of control of COVID-19 were simulated based on vaccination policy. We

280

assumed that vaccine efficacy was 50%, 68%, 80%, and 85%. The initial conditions assumed that all

281

other anti-epidemic measures are excluded from the model and replaced with mass vaccination.

282

Indicators of epidemic dynamics were monitored, such as: CI, hospitalized patients, patient in intensive

283

care units and deaths.

Model sensitivity analysis and calibration

286

Considering the world experience with detection of COVID-19 cases, as well as the unreliable

287

data on COVID-19 infections which are currently available worldwide, model calibration is very

288

challenging, and can result in obtaining inaccurate values for the parameters [40]. This is especially due

289

to the facts that a significant percentage of the infected individuals do not exhibit any symptoms. The

290

other issue is small percentage of tested population [40].

291

As part of the national seroepidemiological study, 1,006 subjects were tested in Serbia from May

292

11th to June 25th, 2020, for the purpose of estimating the extent of COVID-19 infection. According to the

293

published data, seroconversion was confirmed in 6,4% of the subjects. On the other hand, a total of

294

13,372 cases of the infection were reported, which means that those who were infected constitute around

295

0.19% of the overall population. However, it is our opinion that the data on reported deaths caused by

296

COVID-19 infection is more reliable for use in model calibration, e.g. infection fatality rate. Alex et al.

297

reached a similar conclusion when simulating COVID-19 by using the SEIRD model with heterogeneous

298

diffusion [40]. When we compared the data recorded during the beginning of the epidemic in Serbia with

299

the results obtained during the simulation, such as the initial doubling time, the two data series matched

300

well. However, later, the obtained results did not match well the officially registered data on the number of

301

infected, especially after the beginning of the implementation of measures in Serbia. We attribute these

302

differences to the methodology by which official authorities register cases of infection, and collect the

303

data.

304

The parameter that determines the number of deaths is the IFR. It is the number of persons who

305

die of the COVID-19 among all infected individuals regardless of whether the infected show symptoms of

306

the disease or not. As with many diseases, IFR is not always equivalent to the number of reported deaths

307

caused by COVID-19. This is because a significant number of deaths, although caused by COVID-19, will

308

not be recognized as deaths caused by COVID-19 [41]. Also, there are many asymptomatic cases of

309

infection which are never detected [42, 43, 44, 45].

310

However, according to new findings, the overall estimate of the proportion of people who become

311

infected with SARS-CoV-2 and remain asymptomatic throughout infection was 20% (95% confidence

312

interval) with a prediction interval of 3%–67% in 79 studies that addressed this question [46, 47]. Michael

313

A. Johansson et al. reported that 30% of individuals with infection never develop symptoms and are 75%

314

as infectious as those who do develop symptoms, and concluded that persons with infection who never

315

develop symptoms may account for approximately 24% of all transmission [39].

316

Due the fact that there is a lag in time between when people are infected and when they die,

317

patients who die on any given day were infected much earlier, and thus the denominator of the mortality

318

rate should be the total number of patients infected at the same time as those who died [41]. David et al.

319

estimated mortality rate by dividing of deaths on a given date by the total number of persons confirmed as

320

COVID 19 cases 14 days before [29, 41]. It is based on the assumption that maximum incubation period

321

is14 days [34]. However, if we take into account that the number of registered cases of COVID-19

322

infection is usually significantly lower than the actual number, assuming that the data on deaths are

323

accurate, the real IFR value is significantly lower than the calculated value [40]. If we apply this to the

324

situation in Serbia, the daily value of IFR on July 10 , 2020, when the largest number of deaths was

325

registered in one day, was 9.33%, considering that 18 deaths were registered on July 10 and 14 days

326

earlier 193 confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection. The raw values of IFR for the period between March

327

6th and August 10th were as follows: median of IFR = 2.11%, and average value of IFR = 7.15% bounded

328

in interval 4.17%-10.13%. When we compared these values with those published by the WHO, CDC and

329

other authors [43, 44, 48] we concluded that they differ significantly. Considering these findings, the IFR

330

values adopted in the model (for various population groups and genders) were primarily taken from the

331

literature, with a remark that the selection of IFR values was based on preliminary comparison of the

332

overall Serbian IFR with similar IFRs found in the literature, taking into account the registered deaths and

333

most probable number of infected individuals [33]. To make this possible, the first step was to correct the

334

local raw IFR value mentioned above. Based on real data we first calculated the population at risk of

335

dying from COVID-19 infection for each individual day since the outbreak, ending on August 10 , 2020.

336

The number at risk on a given day should correspond to the number of deaths from COVID-19 infection,

337

considering the lag period from infection to death. For this calculation, we used the data on the number of

338

deaths Dt in Serbia registered on daily bases [2]. We hypothesized that the distribution of time periods tn

339

from the moment of COVID19 infection to death follows the lognormal distribution defined by the

340

parameters m = 26.8 and σ = 12.4 days [48, 49].

341

Based on the formula: Ir(t) = ∑

th

 

"   by reverse, we calculated the population at risk of

342

dying from COVID-19 infection for each individual day, where mt is the probability that the time between

343

infection and death is t days and follows the lognormal distribution (m = 26.8, σ = 12.4) [48, 49]. After that,

344

the daily IFR values were calculated according to the formula IFR(t) = Dt /Ir(t) [50]. Based on IFR values

345

calculated in this way, we made descriptive statistics and obtained the mean value of IFR = 0.70%,

346

bounded in the interval 0.46-0.94% and a median of 0.19%. It is important to note here that this value

347

corresponds with the COVID-19 IFR values found in Eastern European countries and Spain [50, 33].

348

Taking these findings into account, we decided to take the IFR values specific to certain population strata

349

recorded in Spain as the most appropriate for our case [33]. The adopted IFR values are listed in Table 3.

350

In this section, we used sensitivity analysis to estimate the amount of change on outcomes when

351

varying the input values used in the model. Sensitivity analysis is one of the methods most frequently

352

used for the evaluation of disease spread models [51, 52]. A sensitivity analysis is carried out to

353

characterise the impact of uncertainty of input parameters on model outputs. Sensitivity analysis consists

354

of assessing the impact that changes in input parameters have on model outcomes. We evaluate two

355

aspects of the model: the global behavior of the model when perturbing a group of key parameters

356

together, and the impact of changes when perturbing the key parameters used in the model individually.

357

The model sensitivity analysis was conducted by changing the most sensitive model parameters:

η, ω, τ . The values of these parameters were increased by 5%, 10% and 25%

358

R0, β, ƒ-1, r, b, m, γ, ε,

359

relative to the base scenario and changes in output indicators were observed.

360

Finaly, validation of the model was performed by comparing the historical data of the real

361

epidemic in Serbia with the data obtained with the SEAIHRDS model. For validation purposes, the current

362

epidemic of COVID-19 was simulated, along with actual anti-epidemic measures. Taking into account the

363

risks described above related to the accuracy of historical data from the COVID-19 epidemic in Serbia

364

and significantly higher confidence in the accuracy of data related to the number of deaths from COVIDA-

365

19 compared to data on the number of infected, for the purpose of model validation, only data on the

366

cumulative number of deaths were used. The reason for this assumption is that there is still uncertainty

367

about the proportion of the infected population that is not reported due to a mild form of the disease or

368

the patients are asymptomatic.

369

In statistical analysis the coefficient of determination, R2, was used to check goodness of fit of

370

SEAIHRD model with COVID-19 data recorded during the real epidemic. The regression coefficient

371

compares predicted values (y) against actual data (x). To address model uncertainties, bias, mean

372

absolute error (MAE), mean square error (MSE), the root mean square error (RMSE), maximum deviation

373

(MaxDev) and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) were also estimated (Supplementary

374

material).

Predicting the number of sick, hospitalized patients and deaths caused by COVID-19 in the
absence of any intervention measures

379

After the simulation, the model predicted that with Ro = 2.46, and without the implementation of

380

any anti-epidemic measures, the initial doubling time of the infection could be five days. The epidemic

381

wave could peak 219 days after the outbreak, and it could yield 99,819 infected individuals in a day.

382

Afterwards, the infection rate could decline for 215 days, eventually reaching the daily incidence of 492

383

newly infected, after which the next epidemic wave could start. The second wave could peak 706 days

384

after the onset of epidemic and yielding 25,232 infected individuals in a day. The third epidemic wave

385

could peak 429 days later, with 13,709 infected individuals in a day. The true cumulative incidence in the

386

first year of the epidemic could be 6,229,144 infected people with SARS-Cov-2 virus, while the apparent

387

cumulative incidence could be 4,360,401 infected. A total of 20,894 patients could die due to COVID-19

388

consequences.

389

With Ro = 3.1, the following results were obtained: the initial doubling time of the infection was five

390

days, true cumulative incidence 7,133,221, apparent cumulative incidence 4,993,254, and the total

391

deaths of 23,951. Fig. 1, panels a) and b) show daily variations in the number of susceptible, latently

392

infected, infected and recovered patients, at basic reproduction numbers of Ro=2.46 and Ro=3,

393

respectively. Panels c) and d) of the same figure show daily fluctuations in susceptible, recovered and net

394

reproduction rates Rn for Ro=2.46 and Ro=3, respectively. Panels e) and f) of Fig. 1 show daily variations

395

in Rn, true and apparent disease incidences at basic reproduction numbers of Ro=2.46 and Ro=3. The

396

shaded area corresponds to the period when the daily number of new COVID-19 infected individuals

397

increasing, and therefore all of the following hold: Rn>1, proportion susceptible >1/Ro and the proportion

398

of population that is recovered (immune) is below the herd immunity threshold. Fig. 2 panels a) and b)

399

show a prediction of necessary hospital capacities. Panels c) and d) of Fig. 2 show predicted numbers of

400

sick and dead due to COVID-19 at Ro=2.46 and Ro=3 and age structure of hospitalized patients and

deaths.

Predicting the number of sick, hospitalized patients and deaths caused by COVID-19 in the
conditions of application of restrictive anti-epidemic measures

405

When the spread of COVID-19 epidemic through totally susceptible population in the Republic of

406

Serbia is simulated, under an assumption of only incidental movement among the population, basic

407

reproduction number of Ro = 2.46, and with lock-down of entire country, a significant slowdown of the

408

epidemic was observed. Initial infection doubling time was 6 days. The peak of the epidemic wave could

409

occur 702 days after the epidemic onset, when there could be 2,848 infected in one day. In the first year

410

of the epidemic 308,581 people could be infected and 1,031 people could die.

411

When the basic reproductive number was increased to R0 = 3.1, and for certain segments of the

412

population the contact reduction factor ρi increased compared to the values from the scenario with R0 =

413

2.46 (reduction of contacts in public places and contacts of persons over 65 years by 55% and 65%,

414

respectively), the results changed significantly. The model predicted that with R0 = 3.10, the initial

415

infection doubling time could be 5 days, the peak of epidemic wave could occur after 246 days and it yield

416

8,110 infected people in one day. In the first year of the epidemic 2,219,251 people could be infected and

417

7,194 could die.

418

Table 5 provides the overview of epidemic indicators obtained from the simulations of all five

419

scenarios with Ro = 2.46 and Ro = 3.1. Figures 3. and 4 provide a comparative overview of results of all

420

five simulated scenarios. Panels a) and b) of Fig. 3 show the values of cumulative incidences on a daily

421

basis for Ro=2.46 and Ro=3.1, respectively. Panels b) and c) of Fig. 3 show the expected total number of

422

hospitalized patients and patients in intensive care units (ICU) for Ro=2.46 and Ro=3.1, respectively. Fig.

423

4 provides overview of required hospital capacities e.g. hospital bed occupancy and the occupancy of

424

beds in ICU on daily bases for Ro=2.46 and Ro=3.1, respectively. The results show that after applying

425

various measures to slow down the circulation of SARS-Cov-2, the number of newly infected people,

426

hospitalized patients and the occupancy of hospital capacities are the lowest in the situations where

427

rigorous anti-epidemic measures are applied to all population strata (Scenario 2 in Table 5 and in Fig. 3

428

and Fig. 4). Openings of pre-school and elementary school’s facilities leads to a visible jump in the

429

number of infected and hospitalized in all strata. This finding clearly shows that children, although least

430

susceptible to developing more severe clinical pictures, are important when transmitting SARS-Cov-2

431

(Scenario 3 in Table 5 and Fig. 3). Opening of the high schools and colleges also leads to a visible

432

increase in the number of newly infected and hospitalized patients, including an increase in the number of

433

deaths (Scenario 5 in Table 5 and Fig. 3). Without the application of any intervention measures, the

434

greatest burden on the health system could be expected 228 days from the beginning of the epidemic at

435

Ro=2.46 or 168 days at Ro=3.1.

436

Depending on the Ro value used in simulation, it could be necessary to provide 42,351 (61,739)

437

hospital beds and an additional 20,173 (28,740) in intensive care units. In the case of Scenario 2, there is

438

a significant slowdown in the epidemic. According to the predictions obtained by the simulation of

439

Scenario 2, after 713 (259) days at the moment of maximum occupancy of hospital capacities, it might be

440

necessary to provide 1,387 (3,940) beds in COVID-19 hospitals and 784 (2,162) beds in intensive care

441

units (Fig. 4).

COVID-19 simulation and disease control by implementing a hypothetical vaccine

443

Assuming that the disease is spreading at the basic reproduction number of Ro=2.46, the herd

444

immunity threshold (when the disease can be expected to slow down and the chain of infection is

445

expected to be broken) would be 59.35%, while at Ro=3.1, it would be 67.74%. Depending on the efficacy

446

of the potential vaccine, the required vaccination coverage should be 87% (ve =68%), 74.19% (ve =80%),

447

69.82% (ve=85%), 65.94% (ve=90%) and 95.41% (ve=71%), 84.68% (ve=80%), 79.70% (ve=85%), 75.27%

448

(ve=90%) for Ro=2.46 and Ro=3.1, respectively. The different ways of including vaccination in the

449

SEAIHRD model are detailed in the supplementary material. Fig. 5 shows different scenarios of COVID-

450

Results of the model sensitivity analysis

453

The results of the sensitivity analysis are presented in tables 6 and 7. The tables show increased

454

values of input parameters and the percentage of the parameter increase relative to the basic scenario,

455

as well as the values of output results obtained after the simulation of the changed scenario.

456

3.5.

Results of the model validation

457

The model was validated on the most recent historical data (from January 1, 2021 to February 1,

458

2021). As shown in Table 8. all measures of the prediction quality of deceased due to COVID-19 are low.

459

The average difference between the actual number of people who died of COVID-19 and predicted one is

460

only 2.05% and the maximum deviation between the predicted and actual number will not exceed 4.82%

461

with a probability of 95%.

462

Based on Fig. 6 and Table 9, we can conclude that the SEAIHRD model fits historical data quite

463

well. Pearson's r and coefficient of determination (R2) have shown strong the linear relationship between

464

real deceased and the number of deaths predicted by SEAIHRD model.

4. Conclusions and discussion

469

For the needs of this research, we augmented the classic deterministic model by adding the

470

compartments of vaccinated, asymptomatic, hospitalized and latently infected subjects. By adding birth

471

and death rates, we enabled daily fluctuations of the overall simulated population, which brought us

472

closer to the real conditions in which the disease is transmitted. When we assumed that the recovered

473

lose immunity over time, we obtained dynamic oscillations of epidemic waves through susceptible

474

population.

475

The input values for the parameters used to simulate the COVID-19 were obtained either from

476

literature review or were calculated on the basis of data have taken from the literature and other official

477

sources. Whereas some of these inputs are well documented; other input values are either not so well

478

documented or based on potential subjective opinions (i.e., expert opinion, historical data from epidemic

479

etc.). In any case, well documented or not input values have potential to impact results and, therefore,

480

should be carefully evaluated. The results of conducted sensitivity analysis show that the sources of

481

uncertainty are different for each output considered and it is necessary to consider multiple output

482

variables for a proper assessment of the model. The most influential parameter is r than R0 and ƒ--1 .

483

The model was tested on Serbian COVID-19 statistic data and obtained validation results allow

484

us to conclude that the proposed model has good prediction ability and performance. However, although

485

we obtained satisfactory results during the validation of the model, worth noticing also that some of the

486

model parameters were estimated based on available data that might be less precise due to the difficulty

487

of being measured. That could be the reason why the values of some parameters e.g. recovery rate,

488

contact rate, daily infection rate, that are estimated in hospitals may differ from those acquired by this

489

study. For that reasons SEAIHRD model can be used for the long-term rough predictions of the epidemic.

490

Obtained long-term predictions reflect the general dynamic of the outbreak and are especially useful for

491

the healthcare system workers and governmental officials.

492

When we simulated different disease control scenarios of the COVID-19 epidemic based on non-

493

pharmaceutical intervention measures, scenario number 2 proved to be the most effective approach to

494

the disease control, because it implemented the most comprehensive anti-epidemic measures (entire

country lock down). However, the basic problem of this approach is the feasibility and practicability to

496

maintain the measures in the long term.

497

The model predicted that students, children and younger school-age generations have an

498

important role in transmitting COVID-19, especially if they come into contact with a more vulnerable

499

population. The model showed that, in the case of returning school children of all ages to schools, an

500

increase of 10.48% in the estimated deaths and 12.16% of the number of infected is possible, when

501

compared to the conditions before opening of the schools (Scenarios 2 and 4). However, most dead and

502

seriously diseased people are found in the older population. This is particularly important when planning

503

intervention measures, especially when deciding on which restrictions to be lifted and how (opening

504

schools, students’ return to faculties etc.). The model predicted that COVID-19 has a potential to spread

505

rapidly and linger in population. Due to a large number of the infected persons and duration of the

506

disease, there are significant needs for hospital capacities, especially in the conditions when the disease

507

is suppressed by implementing partly relaxed anti-epidemic measures, or in the case of absence of any

508

measures. According to the prediction, without the application of any intervention measures, at the

509

moment of the greatest load, depending of actual Ro, the health system should provide 42,351 (Ro=2.46)

510

hospital beds for the care of the patients and an additional 20,733 in intensive care units. On the other

511

hand, in the case of the application of the strictest anti-epidemic measures, the needs decrease to only

512

1,387 beds in COVID-19 hospitals and additional 784 beds in intensive care units. In the case of

513

continued implementation of current measures, which are significantly less intense than the measures

514

applied at the beginning of the epidemic, it is necessary to provide 3,537 beds in COVID-19 hospitals and

515

1,945 beds in intensive care units in the entire country. The model also shows that the needs for hospital

516

capacities decline with the ending of the first epidemic wave, since daily incidence decreases and during

517

the second and third waves it never reaches the initial peaks, but these needs still remain substantial. For

518

example, in the case of Scenario 1, at the top of the second epidemic wave, it is necessary to provide

519

11,845 beds in COVID-19 hospitals and 6,378 in intensive care units, which makes 27.96% and 30,76%

520

of the required capacities of the first wave of the epidemic.

521

Based on the cyclical patterns of the epidemic waves and duration of simulated epidemics, the

522

model predicted that the disease has a potential to linger in population and that it will most probably have

523

a seasonal pattern. Therefore, potential vaccines can have an enormous potential and significance for

524

COVID-19 control. Depending on the efficacy of future vaccines, the disease can be stopped and curbed

525

almost solely by implementing the measure of vaccination. However, the necessary conditions for these

526

predictions and expectations are the efficacy of potential vaccines and the ability of a health systems to

527

implement vaccination to a satisfactory extent and rapidly, especially with regards to the most sensitive

528

categories of population. Depending on the Ro, a vaccine that would have an efficacy

529

stop the pandemic and break the chain of infection. However, even vaccines with lower efficacy could be

530

useful as they would significantly reduce the number of cases and deaths, especially if used in

531

combination with the other disease control measures. The effects of vaccination depend primarily on: 1.

532

Efficacy of available vaccine(s), 2. Prioritization of the population categories for vaccination, and 3.

533

Overall vaccination coverage of the population, assuming that the vaccine(s) develop solid immunity in

534

vaccinated individuals. With expected basic reproduction number of Ro=2.46 and vaccine efficacy of

535

68%, an 87%- coverage would be sufficient to stop the virus circulation. The required minimal vaccination

536

coverage should be 87% (ve =68%), 74.19% (ve =80%), 69.82% (ve=85%) and 95.41% (ve=71%), 84.68%

537

(ve=80%), 79.70% (ve=85%) for Ro=2.46 and Ro=3.1, respectively. The minimum daily vaccination rate

538

should be 0.47% for vaccines with an efficiency of 85%, and 0.59% for vaccines with an efficiency of

539

68%.

≥ 68-71% could

540

Based on the obtained results, we can conclude that at this point, without the application of

541

specific pharmaceutical products, COVID-19 suppression is highly dependent on the basic reproduction

542

number (Ro), and that more intensive contacts and relaxed measures can result in a dramatic spread of

543

the virus. The choice of intervention measures depends on the feasibility of their implementation and their

544

efficacy in different social contexts. COVID-19 will likely have to be suppressed in this way for a certain

545

period of time. This will most probably last until sufficient quantities of a reliable and effective vaccine are

546

available, and thereafter until optimal vaccination coverage is achieved.
