ABSTRACT
The objective of this longitudinal cohort study was to determine the seroprevalence of antibodies to
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in healthcare workers employed at
healthcare clinics in three rural counties in eastern South Dakota and western Minnesota from May 13,
2020 through December 22, 2020. Three blood draws were performed at five clinical sites and tested for
the presence of antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Serum samples were tested for the presence
of antibodies using a fluorescent microsphere immunoassay (FMIA), neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 Spikepseudotyped particles (SARS-CoV-2pp) assay, and serum virus neutralization (SVN) assay. The
seroprevalence was determined to be 1/336 (0.29%) for samples collected from 5/13/20-7/13/20, 5/260
(1.92%) for samples collected from 8/13/20-9/25/20, and 35/235 (14.89%) for samples collected from
10/16/20-12/22/20. Eight of the 35 (22.8%) seropositive individuals identified in the final draw did not
report a previous diagnosis with COVID-19. There was a high correlation (>90%) among the FMIA and
virus neutralization assays. Each clinical site's seroprevalence was higher than the cumulative incidence
for the general public in each respective county as reported by state public health agencies. As of
December 2020, there was a high percentage (85%) of seronegative individuals in the study population.

SARS-CoV-2 in Rural Healthcare Workers

2

INTRODUCTION
In December of 2019, a cluster of patients in the Wuhan province of China were diagnosed with
pneumonia of an unidentified cause. The pneumonia-like disease was caused by a novel beta-type
coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. The newly identified species belongs to the family Coronaviridae of the genus
Betacoronavirus 1. The disease state caused by SARS-CoV-2 was later renamed COVID-192. SARS-CoV2 proved difficult to contain due to its high transmissibility, spreading from person to person primarily
through respiratory droplets from infected individuals 3,4. The first reported case of COVID-19 in the United
States occurred on January 19, 2020 in Washington state5. On March 11, 2020, the World Health
Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic, citing it as the first pandemic caused by a
coronavirus6. COVID-19 quickly spread throughout highly populated urban areas in the United States.
Over 200,000 new cases of COVID-19 were reported in the New York City area within a three-month
period7.
Early in the pandemic, despite the toll COVID-19 had on urban populations, it remained difficult to
predict how the virus would impact rural areas. Notably, seasonal influenza has a shorter duration but
higher degree of intensity in rural populations, and regional epidemics frequently begin in urban areas
before spreading to rural communities 8. Furthermore, rural communities often lack the medical resources
and infrastructure necessary to handle large-scale outbreaks9.
The need for serological testing is required to quantify the true percentage of individuals who
were infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the United States. COVID-19 causes a wide range of respiratory
symptoms with varying degrees of severity. The elderly and those with preexisting conditions are at
higher risk for experiencing a severe case of COVID-1910,11. This can be especially worrisome for rural
communities where an estimated 17.5% of the population is age 65 or older in comparison with 13.5% in
urban communities12. Younger individuals without preexisting conditions may present with mild to no
symptoms. Unlike symptomatic individuals who often seek medical attention, an asymptomatic individual
may not be tested and therefore missed via conventional PCR-based testing protocols. Antibody testing
allows for the identification of these asymptomatic and/or undiagnosed individuals.
Healthcare workers are a high-risk group for contracting COVID-19 due to their frequent
exposures to infected individuals. In addition, healthcare workers have on-site access to phlebotomy

services at the place of work. Therefore, individuals working in the healthcare facilities in eastern South
Dakota and western Minnesota were tested for the presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 over the
course of an eight-month period.
METHODS
Study Design
A longitudinal cohort study was conducted from May 13, 2020 through December 22, 2020 with
healthcare workers in eastern South Dakota and western Minnesota. Following recruitment via email,
potential participants were guided through an online informed consent process and completed an online
questionnaire. Individuals were invited from five clinical sites and were asked to provide three blood
samples throughout the course of the study. Participants’ serum was tested for antibodies against SARSCoV-2. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, provisions were made in order to ensure the safety of
participants and researchers. Each blood draw was performed by clinical staff phlebotomists at the
discretion of the clinical site. After collection, the serum samples were turned over to study personnel and
tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.
Participants
Human subjects’ procedures were approved by the South Dakota State University Institutional
Review Board prior to the start of the study, were in compliance with relevant laws and institutional
guidelines, and were in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki. All
participants provided informed consent prior to participating in the study.
Study Sites
Five clinical sites from three different counties were studied in South Dakota and Minnesota.
Three clinical sites provide in-patient services, while two are out-patient services only. All three counties
are considered non-metro or rural areas based on United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)
classification. Two counties have a 2013 Rural-Urban Continuum Code of 9, which indicates completely
rural and not surrounded by an adjacent metro area. The third county has a 2013 Rural-Urban Continuum
Code of 5 meaning that the population is greater than 20,000 and not surrounded by adjacent metro
area13.

Online Questionnaire
Participants provided demographic information including age, sex, race, height and weight via an
online questionnaire using QuestionPro (HIPPA certified; Austin, TX). COVID-19 related questions also
were asked, including whether they had been previously diagnosed with COVID-19, the date of diagnosis
and whether they had exposure to a known positive or suspected positive case of COVID-19.
Serum collection
Upon collection, participant blood samples were deidentified and incubated at room temperature
for 30 min to allow for clotting to occur. Samples were then centrifuged for 10 min at 1,500 x g. Serum
was separated from whole blood and stored at -40C prior to being assayed.
Fluorescent microsphere immune assay (FMIA)
A quantitative assessment of serum IgG, IgA and IgM antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2
nucleocapsid protein (NCP) was performed using a fluorescent microsphere immunoassay (FMIA) testing
platform. To prepare the microspheres for antibody capture, a two-step carbodiimide coupling procedure
was used to couple prokaryotic expressed and purified SARS-CoV-2-NCP antigen to Luminex™
microspheres as previously described 14,15. Briefly, the full length (1257 bp) coding sequence
corresponding to the Wuhan-Hu-1, nucleoprotein gene (Genbank MN908947.3) was chemically
synthesized and cloned into the bacterial expression plasmid pET-28a (EMD Millipore/Novagen, Billerica,
MA). DNA sequencing was used to confirm the identity and in-frame cloning of the SARS-CoV-2 protein
with a 6x histidine fusion tag. The recombinant protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL-21 cells and
purified using nickel-NTA agarose resin (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Using a series of titrations, the optimal
coupling ratio was calculated to be 25 μg NCP antigen/3.1 x 106 microspheres.
For the performance of the FMIA, 50 μL of heat inactivated serum (diluted 1:50 in PBS-BN) was
added to 2.5 × 103 antigen-coupled microspheres. Serum binding IgG, IgA and IgM antibody isotypes
were detected using a polyisotypic, anti-human, biotinylated secondary antibody (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA) followed by a fluorescent (streptavidin-phycoerythrin) reporter (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) that was
added to sample and control wells. Anti-NCP antibodies were quantified through a dual-laser instrument
(Bio-Rad Bio-Plex 200) as previously described 16. The median fluorescent intensity (MFI) for 100
microspheres corresponding to each analyte was recorded for each well, their measurements were

mathematically normalized against a serological reference standard to calculate a relative sample-topositive (S/P) ratio. Determination of a diagnostic sensitivity and specificity threshold cutoff was
calculated using a change-point analysis method determined by calculating the mean plus three standard
deviations of the negative control, S/P ratios as described17. For serum samples tested more than once
the mean S/P ratio was calculated for diagnostic determination.
Serum virus neutralization assay (SVN)
A fluorescent serum virus neutralization assay using live virus was developed for the
quantification of neutralizing antibodies produced in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Two-fold serial
dilutions of heat inactivated serum (1:2 to 1:256) were prepared using MEM + 10% FBS (R&D Systems,
Flower Branch, GA) and incubated with an equal volume of SARS-CoV-2 virus strain SDLEMN-20 (South
Dakota 2020 isolate) having a titer between 300-400 foci forming units/well and having a final assay
range of 1:4 to 1:512. After a 1-h incubation, trypsinized Vero 76 cells were added to the 96-well dilution
plate, then incubated at 37C for 48 h. After incubation, cells were acetone fixed, and virus infected cells
were visualized and quantified by staining infected cells with a SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein-specific, FITCconjugated, monoclonal antibody (SD83-108) as described previously18,19. Lastly, SVNs were read under
a fluorescence microscope and neutralizing antibody titers expressed as the reciprocal of the highest
dilution of serum capable of a 90% reduction in florescent foci relative to controls. Both negative and
positive control sera were included in all assays.
Neutralization assay of SARS-CoV-2 Spike-pseudotyped particles (SARS-CoV-2pp)
To mimic the infection condition of human cells, 293T cells were generated, which stably express
human ACE2 by lentiviral transduction with pLENTI-hACE2-HygR (a gift from Raffaele De Francesco;
Addgene plasmid# 155296). Transduced cells were sorted by flow cytometry 72 h post-transduction
based on ACE2 expression detected with anti-hACE2 Alexa fluor 488 conjugated antibodies (Catalog#
Fab9332G, clone# 535919, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). After sorting, a population was generated
in which 99.3% of the cells expressed ACE2 compared to the parental 293T cells which had no
detectable ACE2 expression.
For the purpose of Spike pseudovirus production, the vector pCMV14-3X-Flag-SARS-CoV-2 S
was used, a gift from Zhaohui Qian lab (Addgene plasmid #145780)20 that carries a codon-optimized

cDNA that encodes SARS-CoV2-S glycoprotein (Wuhan 2019) with C-terminal 19 amino acid deletion.
Site directed mutagenesis was performed, confirmed by sequencing to make the D614G mutation in
spike and named it pCMV-SD614G. Spike pseudovirus particles containing a Luciferase reporter gene
were produced in 293T cells by co-transfection of packaging plasmid psAPX2 which was a gift from Didier
Trono (Addgene plasmid# 12260), transfer plasmid pLenti-CMV V5-LUC (W567-1) which was gift from
Eric Campeau (Addgene plasmid# 21474)21 and envelop plasmid pCMV-SD614G in 293T cells using
TransIT-Lenti transfection reagent (Mirus Bio, Madison, WI). Plasmids were used at a ratio of 5:3:3
(pspAX2:LUC-blast:SD614G) and a total of 5.5 μg plasmid DNA was mixed in 1 mL of serum free OPTIMEM media (Gibco, Life Technologies corporation, Grand Island, NY) with 30 μL of transfection reagent.
After a 10-min incubation with the transfection reagent, the plasmid mixture was added drop wise onto
293T cells in 100 mm tissue culture dish (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). After 48 h post
transfection, the supernatant containing the released pseudovirus particle was harvested and stored at 80°C for future use or was used immediately with the assay.
The in-vitro serum neutralization assay was performed as previously described22. Briefly, 3.5*103
ACE2 293T cells were plated on white 96-well cell culture treated plates (Falcon, Waltham, MA) in DMEM
supplemented with 10% FBS one day prior to infection with the pseudovirus. To determine the
neutralization efficiency, the human sera was serially diluted from 1:20 with a dilution factor of 2 to 8
dilutions in DMEM medium. A volume of 50 μL of spike pseudovirus was added to 50 μL of serum
solution and incubated for 1 h at 37 C before adding to the target cells. After 48 h post-infection with the
spike pseudovirus, Luciferin (D-Luciferin potassium salt, Goldbio, St. Louis, MO) was added at a final
concentration of 200 μg/mL to the cells. Luminescence was measured for each serum dilution using a
micro plate reader (BioTekSynergy, Biotech, Winooski, VT). For each well, the luminescence for the
highest dilution (1:2560) was divided by 2 to determine a 50% cutoff point. The highest serum dilution that
resulted in a 50% neutralization titer (NT50) was recorded for the samples.
Public records search for cumulative incidence data
The cumulative case percentage for each county was accessed via the South Dakota Department
of Health and Minnesota Department of Health online database23,24. The cumulative case percentage was

found for specific dates relevant to individual draw dates at each test site. Public records for county data
were accessed on April 1, 2021.
RESULTS
Demographic data
In total, 336 healthcare workers from five clinical sites in eastern South Dakota and western
Minnesota participated in the study. The majority of study participants were less than 50 years old
(69.5%), were primarily women (86.6%), and were of Caucasian race (96.4%; Table 1).
Serial blood draws show increasing seropositivity among study participants
Phase 1 blood draws occurred between 5/13/20-7/13/20, and 1/336 (0.3%) healthcare workers
were found to have antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (Table 2). Phase 2 blood draws occurred between 813/20-9/25/20, and 5/260 (1.9%) healthcare workers were found to be seropositive (Table 2). All of the
individuals who tested positive during Phase 2 had tested negative during Phase 1. Phase 3 blood draws
occurred between 10/16/20-12/22/20, and 35/235 (14.8%) healthcare workers were seropositive (Table
2). Four of the five individuals who tested positive in Phase 2 continued with the study and also tested
positive during Phase 3.
Viral neutralization assays confirm FMIA results and show study participants have neutralizing antibodies
The FMIA identified 32 positive samples from Phase 3. These 32 samples along with 3 borderline
positive serum samples, and a subset of 18 negative samples were subjected to confirmatory testing via
SARS-CoV-2 Spike-pseudotyped particles assay (SARS-CoV-2pp) and serum virus neutralization assay
(SVN), two assays designed to identify neutralizing antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2. Neutralizing
antibodies were identified in 35 samples using SVN and 32 samples using SARS-CoV-2pp assays. The
average positive titer for SVN and SARS-CoV-2pp was 1:81 and 1:191, respectively (Supplemental Table
1). Samples were deemed “positive” if they were positive for two out of the three assays (FMIA, SVN,
SARS-CoV-2pp). In total, 53 samples were tested with 91.4% agreement between each of the
neutralizing assays and between the neutralizing assays and the FMIA (Table 3, Supplemental Table 1).
Antibody testing shows higher seroprevalence than county-level cumulative incidence reported by state
health departments

The seroprevalence for each clinical site in Phase 3 was compared to the cumulative case rate
for their respective county on the date of the blood draw. Each of the clinical sites had a higher
seroprevalence amongst their healthcare workers than the cumulative case rate reported by the state
department of health on the same date (Table 4).
Asymptomatic or undiagnosed infection and occupational COVID-19 exposures
In Phase 1, the one participant who was seropositive also indicated having been diagnosed with
COVID-19 prior their first blood draw. Of the healthcare workers sampled in Phase 1, 15.1% had contact
with patients confirmed of having an active case of COVID-19 (Table 5). In Phase 2, three participants
indicated that they had been diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to having their blood drawn. A total of 44.5%
study participants had direct contact with patients confirmed of having an active COVID-19 infection
(Table 5). In Phase 3, 15.4% indicated having been diagnosed with COVID-19 (Table 5) prior to having
their blood drawn and 69.1% reported having direct contact with patients confirmed of having an active
case of COVID-19 (Table 5).
Of the 35 individuals who tested positive for antibodies during Phase 3, 27 (77.1%) reported
having been diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to having their blood drawn and 8 (22.8%) indicated they
had not been previously diagnosed with COVID-19.
In Phase 3, seventeen of the 121 (14%) study participants who reported having direct contact
with COVID-19 patients were seropositive; whereas, 9 of the 50 (18%) study participants who reported
having no direct contact with patients suspected or confirmed of having COVID-19 were seropositive.
These results indicate that occupational exposure to COVID-19 is not a predominant dynamic for testing
positive in this population.
Participant retention and loss to follow up
The single seropositive individual from Phase 1 was lost to follow-up and did not return for
subsequent draws. Overall, 76 participants from the Phase 1 of testing were lost to follow-up (Figure 1).
Four of the five individuals who were found to have antibodies in Phase 2 returned for the final blood
draw.

DISCUSSION
In conclusion, 14.8% of healthcare workers from eastern South Dakota and western Minnesota
seroconverted over the course of an 8-month testing period while 85.1% remained susceptible to COVID19. Of individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, 22.8% had not been diagnosed with
COVID-19. Greater than 90% of the seropositive individuals had neutralizing antibodies. Healthcare
workers with direct occupational exposure to COVID-19 patients had similar seroprevalence rates
compared to healthcare workers with no contact to known or suspected COVID-19 patients (14% vs.
18%, respectively at Phase 3 visit). Healthcare workers enrolled in the study had a higher seroprevalence
of SARS-CoV-2 exposure when compared to county-wide cumulative incidence data as reported by the
state Departments of Health. However, at the end of the testing period there still remained a large
majority of individuals who did not have a detectable antibody response suggesting they were still
susceptible to infection. COVID-19 vaccines became available to healthcare workers shortly after the end
of the Phase 3 testing period.
Healthcare workers had access to COVID-19 diagnostic testing via their employer, yet 22.8% of
seropositive individuals were not previously diagnosed. This percent of undiagnosed individuals is similar
to other published reports. A large-scale study involving 109,076 participants in the United Kingdom found
that 30.6% of seropositive individuals were not previously diagnosed25, and 10.3% of seropositive
healthcare workers in the New York City Area also went undiagnosed26. The reason these workers went
undiagnosed is not known, but could be due to having an asymptomatic infection, were not tested, or had
a false negative test result.
There was greater than 90% correlation among the FMIA and two neutralizing antibody assays.
The SARS-CoV-2pp assay used a higher starting dilution of 1:20. If a lower starting dilution been used,
one would likely see neutralizing activity in all 35 positive samples from Phase 3. In this study, greater
than 90% of the seropositive individuals had neutralizing antibodies. The percentage of seropositive
individuals displaying neutralizing activity is variable with published reports ranging from 33% to 75%27,28.
There was a high level of SARS-CoV-2 viral transmission in the three counties where the study
locations resided. All three counties reported substantial community spread (100 cases/100,000

population per week) starting in mid- to late-August and continuing for the duration of the study, with peak
cases per week from ~750/100,000 in one county to over 1,100/100,000 in another county.
There are multiple strengths to this longitudinal study. Serially testing study participants over an
eight-month period allowed observation of seroconversion in study participants over time and for
comparison to previous negative results within an individual. Using healthcare workers as study
participants allowed for safe human subjects research to occur during a global pandemic since staff
phlebotomist performed blood draws at each site, thereby ensuring limited face-to-face contact between
participants and the research team. Another strength was the decision to include multiple study locations.
Two of three counties housing testing sites are considered class 9 rural areas, with populations of less
than 2,500. The third county is considered a class 5 rural area with a population of more than 20,000
people (Cromartie, 2020). The overall seroprevalence from the five separate testing sites provides a more
reasonable estimate compared to a single site which may be prone to isolated outbreaks.
A limitation of the study was the potential for participant bias as individuals who suspected they
were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 may have been more likely to continue the study. This coincides with the
fact that most participants reported having direct contact with either a suspected or a confirmed COVID19 case (71.4%) in Phase 3. This exposure rate is likely higher than that among the general population
given the estimated case rates for each county were below 9% at the time of this study. The study began
with 336 participants with 101 individuals lost to follow-up prior to the final blood draw. The retention rate
for blood draws over the course of the study was 69.9% with 74.7% of those with a final blood draw also
completing the final questionnaire.
In summary, serological testing will continue to be an important metric for understanding the true
number of individuals who have been exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and will be an essential tool for
understanding the scope to which COVID-19 has spread in rural populations.
