One Sentence Summary: Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in cross-sectional samples from

New York City rose from 0% to 19.3% from early February to mid-April.

Abstract

32

By conducting a retrospective, cross-sectional analysis of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in a

33

‘sentinel group’ (enriched for SARS-CoV-2 infections) and a ‘screening group’ (representative of

34

the general population) using >5,000 plasma samples from patients at Mount Sinai Hospital in

35

New York City (NYC), we identified seropositive samples as early as in the week ending February

36

23 , 2020. A stark increase in seropositivity in the sentinel group started the week ending March

37

22 and in the screening group in the week ending March 29. By the week ending April 19, the

38

seroprevalence in the screening group reached 19.3%, which is well below the estimated 67%

39

needed to achieve community immunity to SARS-CoV-2. These data potentially suggest an

40

earlier than previously documented introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into the NYC metropolitan area.

Main Text

45

The first case of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) was identified in NYC at Mount Sinai

46

Hospital on February 29, 2020 (1). A sharp rise in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus

47

2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections started to occur shortly afterwards during the week ending on March

48

8, followed by a significant increase of COVID-19 deaths during the week ending on March 15

49

(Figure 1). New York State implemented a stay-at-home order called the ‘New York on Pause

50

Program’ effective at 8pm on March 22, 2020, and, as a consequence, daily case numbers in

51

both New York State and NYC started to plateau and then decreased in April 2020. Although

52

nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) is now widely available in New York State, there was

53

little testing capacity at the beginning of the local epidemic in early March, and many mild to

54

moderate cases likely went undetected. In addition, asymptomatic cases might have been missed

55

since, in the absence of symptoms, NAAT would not have been recommended.

56

Although it is currently unknown if previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 can protect from

57

reinfection, there are data from SARS-CoV-2 infection of non-human primates as well as from

58

studies with other human coronaviruses suggesting that infection may confer immunity (2, 3). It

59

is therefore important to determine the true infection rates in a population in order to assess how

60

close this population is to potential ‘community immunity’ (4). Knowing the true infection rate also

61

allows calculation of the infection fatality rate (IFR), which is very likely much lower than the case

62

fatality rate (CFR). To estimate true infection rates, serosurveys can be used that measure the

63

presence of antibodies that have been mounted to past virus infections, rather than the presence

64

of virus. Several serological assays for measuring antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 have been

65

developed (5). Many focus either on the virus nucleoprotein, the spike protein on the virus surface,

66

or the receptor binding domain (RBD), which is an important part of the spike protein that interacts

67

with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2 (6). We have

68

recently established a two-step enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in which

69

serum/plasma samples are prescreened at a set dilution for reactivity to RBD. Positives in this

70

first step are confirmed and the antibody titer assessed in a second step against a stabilized

71

version of the full-length spike protein (7, 8). The use of two sequential assays reduces the false

72

positive rate and favors high specificity. The assay used here has a workflow that closely

73

resembles an assay established in the Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS) CLIA-certified Clinical

74

Pathology Laboratory, which received an FDA emergency use authorization (EUA) for this ELISA

75

in April 2020. However, the assay used in this study was performed in a research laboratory

76

setting. An initial test of the assay performance with a panel of negative and positive samples

77

suggested that the research-grade assay has a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 100% (S.

78

Table 1). This results in a positive predictive value of 1 (PPV, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.908-

79

1.000) and a negative predictive value of 0.97 (NPV, 95% CI: 0.909-0.995). In the week of

80

February 9, 2020, we started to collect random, de-identified, cross-sectional plasma samples

81

and stored for standard of care medical purposes by the MSHS Clinical Pathology laboratories.

82

These samples were divided into two distinct patient groups. The first group included samples

83

from patients seen in Mount Sinai’s emergency department (ED) and from patients that were

84

admitted to the hospital from the ED during the period beginning with the week ending on February

85

9 till the week ending on April 19. This group, termed the ‘sentinel group’, served as an indicator

86

for SARS-CoV-2 infection since we assumed that individuals with moderate to severe COVID-19

87

would come to the ED and would be admitted to the hospital at increasing rates as the epidemic

88

progressed. The second group of samples, termed the ‘screening group’, were obtained from

89

patients at OB/GYN visits and deliveries, oncology-related visits, as well as hospitalizations due

90

to elective or planned surgeries, transplant surgeries, pre-operative medical assessments and

91

related outpatient visits, cardiology office visits, and other regular office/treatment visits. We

92

reasoned that these samples might resemble more closely the general population because the

93

purposes for these scheduled visits were unrelated to COVID-19. The sentinel group comprised

94

43.6% females while the screening group included 65.8% females (Table 1). The majority of

95

individuals in the sentinel group were 61 years of age or older while the screening group had a

96

more balanced age distribution resembling the general population (Table 1). Except for the weeks

97

ending February 9 and February 16, for which only 16 samples were obtained across the two

98

weeks (3 in the sentinel group, 13 in the screening group), the sentinel group size ranged between

99

195 and 274 samples per week and the screening group included 230-493 samples per week (S.

100

Table 2). A total of 5,485 samples obtained from patients between the weeks ending February 9

101

and April 19 were tested: 3,412 samples in the screening group and 2,073 in the sentinel group.

102

In the sentinel group, no positives were detected in the week ending February 9 and 16 and low

103

seroprevalence was found between the weeks ending February 23 to March 15 (ranges between

104

1.4 and 3.2%, Figure 1A). While we believe these positives are true positives, the prevalence is

105

low and within the confidence intervals of the PPV. A sharp increase to 6.1% was detected in the

106

week ending March 22. This increase continued in the weeks ending March 29 (17.4%), April 5

107

(46.7%) and April 12 (56.4%); however, seropositivity in the sentinel group seemingly plateaued

108

in the week ending April 19 at 58.1%. In the context of COVID-19 case and death rates reported

109

for NYC, the seroprevalence values we report reflect hospital admissions due to COVID-19,

110

although the uptick in positive serology results lagged approximately one to two weeks behind

111

the increased molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 infections. This is expected since there is

112

usually a delay between infection and seroconversion. In summary, the numbers in the sentinel

113

group are a reflection of hospital admissions due to COVID-19.

114

Similar to the sentinel group, the seroprevalence found in the screening group was very low during

115

the weeks ending February 9 through March 29 (0% to 2%, Figure 1B). Of note, some samples

116

during that time had moderately high reactivity (endpoint titers of 1:150-1:400) (Figure 1D). An

117

increase in seroprevalence from 1.6% to 2.2% was detected in the week ending March 29,

118

followed by increases to 10.1% and 11.7% in the following weeks, up to 19.3% seroprevalence

119

in the week ending April 19. These numbers are significantly lower than the percentages

120

calculated in the same weeks for the sentinel group, which makes sense since the visits from

121

which the screening samples are derived are not related to COVID-19 infections and therefore

122

are not enriched in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. In addition, the delay between the sharp

123

increase in SARS-CoV-2 detection by NAAT in NYC and the increase in seroprevalence in our

124

screening group is longer than the delay between the increase in confirmed cases and the

125

increase in seroprevalence in the sentinel group. This can be attributed to different antibody

126

kinetics in mild cases, which likely constitute the majority of infections in the screening group. We

127

have recently shown that for mild cases, induction of measurable and significant antibody levels

128

often takes several weeks (9). The antibody titers detected in both groups were initially lower and

129

gradually increased to titers as high as 1:51,200 (Figure 1C and D). Although positive samples

130

with lower antibody titers could constitute false positives, we believe that this again is a function

131

of antibody kinetics, exemplified by the gradual increase in titers that can be clearly observed in

132

the screening group (Figure 1D). Seropositive samples collected in the weeks ending February

133

23 and March 1 may potentially indicate that SARS-CoV-2 already had been introduced into the

134

population of NYC earlier than initially detected. Overall, the titers in the sentinel group were

135

significantly higher than in the screening group (Figure 1F), which is likely a function of disease

136

severity in individuals in the sentinel group.

137

In order to determine which subgroup(s) were driving the rise in seroprevalence, we further

138

separated the screening group into four subgroups: (i) “OB/GYN” visits and deliveries (n=1,366

139

samples); (ii) “Oncology” visits and treatment hospitalizations (n=1,319); (iii) “Surgery”, including

140

various elective surgeries, transplant surgeries, pre-op medical assessments and related visits

141

(n=544); and, (iv) “Cardiology”, including cardiology office visits and other regular office/treatment

142

visits (n=183). This rise was mostly driven by “OB/GYN” visits and deliveries, which showed an

143

early increase in seroprevalence in the week of March 29 (9.6%) followed by continued rise to

144

15.6% and 26.6% in the weeks ending April 12 and 19, respectively (Figure 2A). Seroprevalence

145

in “Oncology” patients increased during the same time frame, but appears to plateau between 8-

146

9% during these three weeks (Figure 2B). Similar seroprevalence trends were observed in the

147

“Surgery” and “Cardiology” and other office visits subgroups, although the small number of

148

specimens limited conclusions for these subgroups individually since confidence intervals were

149

very wide (Figure 2C and D).

150

Although our specimen sampling is biased and is not a true representation of the entire population,

151

it nevertheless provides a window into the extent of seroprevalence in NYC. The sentinel samples

152

are enriched in COVID-19 cases, since this group was designed to serve as a positive control.

153

Due to the dramatic upsurge in SARS-CoV-2-related ED visits and admissions during the

154

February-April 2020 time frame, as expected, a very high seroprevalence and a rapid increase in

155

titers was detected in this group, consistent with its role as a positive control. In contrast, the

156

screening group was enriched with individuals who would likely be cautious to avoid exposure to

157

the virus, including pregnant women and patients with malignancies. The seroprevalence in the

158

screening group consequently may be an underrepresentation of the seroprevalence in the

159

general population. The 19.3% seroprevalence we found in this group for the week ending April

160

19 is consistent with a report from the New York–Presbyterian Allen Hospital and Columbia

161

University Irving Medical Center that found 15.4% of pregnant women who delivered infants at

162

their facilities between March 22 and April 4, 2020 were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and were

163

mostly asymptomatic (10). This tracks well with seroprevalence in the screening group, which

164

was between 10.1 and 19.3% in the weeks following April 5. A serosurvey conducted by the New

165

York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) determined that between April 19 and 28, the

166

seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 in the NYC metropolitan region was 22.7% (11), matching very

167

well with the data for our screening samples from the week ending April 19. Of note, these

168

numbers fall significantly below the threshold for community immunity, which has been estimated

169

to require at least a seropositivity rate of 67% for SARS-CoV-2 (4). Based on the population of

170

NYC (8.4 million), we estimate that by the week ending April 19, approximately 1,621,200

171

individuals had been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Taking into account the cumulative deaths in the

172

city by April 19 (11,413), this suggests a preliminary IFR of 0.704%. This is in stark contrast to

173

the IFR of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic which was estimated to be between 0.01% and 0.001% (12).

174

We will continue to conduct this longitudinal serosurvey for at least one year, and expect that the

175

seroprevalence for the screening group will slightly increase and then plateau for the time frame

176

between the end of April and June, due to rapidly declining numbers of cases in NYC. If antibody

177

titers remain stable, the seroprevalence would likely not change significantly unless new infections

178

rise again or vaccines would become available.

Materials and Methods
Study participants and human samples
Cross-sectional plasma samples that were stored for standard of care medical purposes by the
MSHS Clinical Pathology laboratories were sampled beginning from the week ending February
9, 2020. About 230-460 plasma samples per week (starting from the week ending on February
23, 2020) were selected from the ‘screening group’ patient setting from patients that went for
OB/GYN visits and deliveries, oncology visits and treatment hospitalizations, surgeries, transplant
surgeries, pre-operative medical assessments and related visits as well as cardiology office visits
and other regular office visits (see Table S1 for detailed numbers and breakdown per cohort).
About 200 plasma samples per week were selected from an inpatient cohort setting, consisting
of plasma from patients that were admitted to the emergency department or to inpatient care
(‘sentinel group’). Plasma samples were chosen in a blinded and unbiased manner. Longitudinal
samples from the same patients were included in the analysis if the time points between sampling
were at least seven days or more apart since this was seen as independent sampling of the
population. For some individuals, a PCR test for viral RNA was performed to diagnose COVID-19
infection. The collection and testing of plasma was approved by the Mount Sinai Hospital
Institutional Review Board, protocol HS# 20-03253.
Recombinant proteins
The recombinant RBD and spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 were generated and expressed as
previously described (7, 8). In brief, the mammalian cell codon-optimized nucleotide sequences
for RBD (amino acids 319-541) including a signal peptide and hexahistidine tag or the soluble
version of the spike protein (amino acids 1-1,213) including a signal peptide, C-terminal thrombin
cleavage site, T4 foldon trimerization domain and hexahistidine tag were cloned into the
mammalian expression vector pCAGGS. The nucleotide sequence of the spike protein was
additionally modified to remove the polybasic cleavage site and two stabilizing mutations were
introduced. The expression plasmids are available at BEI Resources Repository
(https://www.beiresources.org/).
Recombinant proteins were produced in Expi293F cells (Thermo Fisher) using the ExpiFectamine
293 Transfection Kit (Thermo Fisher) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Proteins were
purified by gravity flow using Ni-NTA Agarose (Qiagen) and concentrated in Amicon centrifugal
units (EMD Millipore). Purified proteins were analyzed by reducing sodium dodecyl sulfate–
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and correct folding was confirmed by performing
ELISAs with RBD-specific monoclonal antibody CR3022 (13, 14) or 2B3E5.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
The serological assays were performed as previously described in detail following a two-step
ELISA protocol (7, 8). In the first step, plasma samples were screened in a high-throughput assay
using the recombinant RBD protein.
Ninety-six-well microtiter plates (Thermo Fisher) were coated with 50 µL recombinant RBD protein
at a concentration of 2 µg/mL overnight at 4°C. The next day, the plates were washed three times

with PBS (phosphate-buffered saline; Gibco) supplemented with 0.1% Tween-20 (T-PBS; Fisher
Scientific) using an automatic plate washer (BioTek). The plates were blocked with 200 µL
blocking solution consisting of PBS-T with 3% (w/v) milk powder (American Bio) and incubated
for 1 h at room temperature. As a general safety precaution, plasma samples were heat
inactivated for 1 h at 56°C. The blocking solution was thrown off the plates and 100 µL of plasma
samples diluted 1:50 in PBS-T containing 1% (w/v) milk powder were added to respective wells
of the microtiter plates. After 2 h the plates were washed three times with PBS-T and 50 µL antihuman IgG (Fab-specific) horseradish peroxidase antibody (HRP, produced in goat; Sigma,
#A0293) diluted 1:3,000 in PBS-T containing 1% milk powder was added to all wells and
incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The microtiter plates were washed three times with PBST and 100 µL SigmaFast o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (OPD; Sigma) was added to all
wells. The reaction was stopped after 10 min with 50 µL per well 3M hydrochloric acid (Thermo
Fisher) and the plates were read at a wavelength of 490 nm with a plate reader (BioTek). Plasma
samples that exceeded an OD 490 cutoff value of 0.15 were categorized as presumptive positives
and were tested in a second step in confirmatory ELISAs using full-length, recombinant spike
protein.
To perform the confirmatory ELISAs, the plates were coated and blocked as described above
except full-length spike protein at a concentration of 2 µg/mL was added to the plates. After 1 h
the blocking solution was removed, presumptive positive plasma samples serially diluted in 1%
milk prepared in PBS-T were added and the plates incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The
remainder of the assay was performed as described above. The data were analyzed in Microsoft
Excel and GraphPad Prism 7. The cutoff value was set as an OD 490 of 0.15 and true positive
samples were defined as samples that exceeded an OD 490 value of 0.15 at a 1:80 plasma dilution.
The endpoint titer was calculated and defined as the last dilution before the signal dropped below
an OD 490 of 0.15. For samples that exceeded an OD 490 of 0.15 at the last dilution (1:12,800 for
samples of weeks ending on March 29 and April 5; 1:6,480 for samples of weeks April 12 and
April 19), a four-parameter curve fit (variable slope) was applied and the endpoint titer determined
by interpolation.
The sensitivity and specificity of the assay were determined using a panel of serum and/or plasma
of 40 patients that had PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (true positives) and 74 negative
control samples (56 samples that were taken before the pandemic and 18 samples without
confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection; true negatives). The PPV and NPV were determined taking into
account the ratio of true positives and true negatives (seroprevalence of 35%) in the panel.
Importantly, using the 100% specificity determined using the panel and assuming a low (e.g. 1%)
true seroprevalence in the test group would not change the PPV.
Statistical analysis
The 95% CI of the seroprevalence was calculated assuming binomial data based on methods by
Wilson/Brown (15). Significant differences in endpoint titers between the sentinel and screening
groups were identified by the Mann-Whitney U test. The 95% CI for assay sensitivity, specificity,
positive predictive value and negative predictive value were determined using methods by
Wilson/Brown.
