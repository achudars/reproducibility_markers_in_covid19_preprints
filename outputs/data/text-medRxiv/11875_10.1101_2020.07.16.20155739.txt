ABSTRACT
Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) carries high morbidity and mortality
globally. Identification of patients at risk for clinical deterioration upon presentation would aid in
triaging, prognostication, and allocation of resources and experimental treatments.
Research Question: Can we develop and validate a web-based risk prediction model for
identification of patients who may develop severe COVID-19, defined as intensive care unit
(ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, and/or death?
Methods: This retrospective cohort study reviewed 415 patients admitted to a large urban
academic medical center and community hospitals. Covariates included demographic, clinical,
and laboratory data. The independent association of predictors with severe COVID-19 was
determined using multivariable logistic regression. A derivation cohort (n=311, 75%) was used
to develop the prediction models. The models were tested by a validation cohort (n=104, 25%).
Results: The median age was 66 years (Interquartile range [IQR] 54-77) and the majority were
male (55%) and non-White (65.8%). The 14-day severe COVID-19 rate was 39.3%; 31.7%
required ICU, 24.6% mechanical ventilation, and 21.2% died. Machine learning algorithms and
clinical judgment were used to improve model performance and clinical utility, resulting in the
selection of eight predictors: age, sex, dyspnea, diabetes mellitus, troponin, C-reactive protein,
D-dimer, and aspartate aminotransferase. The discriminative ability was excellent for both the
severe COVID-19 (training area under the curve [AUC]=0.82, validation AUC=0.82) and
mortality (training AUC= 0.85, validation AUC=0.81) models. These models were incorporated
into a mobile-friendly website.

Interpretation: This web-based risk prediction model can be used at the bedside for prediction
of severe COVID-19 using data mostly available at the time of presentation.

INTRODUCTION
COVID-19 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2).1 The disease has spread rapidly throughout the world with more than 6 million
confirmed cases and 372,035 deaths as of June 1st, 2020.2 Mortality in the United States (U.S.) is
over 100,000.2,3 COVID-19 is associated with a high fatality rate, roughly 6% worldwide with
variation by country.2,4–6 The severity of COVID-19 illness varies from asymptomatic to severe
disease that requires ICU admission.7–10 Patients with severe disease who are admitted to the
ICU and require mechanical ventilation experience the highest mortality, reported as high as
53.4%.9,11,12 Part of COVID-19’s complexity is its variable time course and severity.(e-Figure 1)
Therefore, early identification of patients at risk for progression to severe COVID-19 is
paramount for accurate triage, determining appropriate diagnostic and treatment approaches, and
resource allocation.
The progressing health crisis precipitated by this pandemic has been exacerbated by the
lack of data on key clinical factors associated with severe presentation of disease. Emergent
studies have reported several independent risk factors for the development of severe adverse
outcomes among patients with COVID-19.13,14 In the U.S., available COVID-19 studies are
descriptive in nature.9,15,16 A large study retrospectively analyzed 5,700 hospitalized patients
from 12 hospitals in the New York City area. Comorbidities such as hypertension (57%), obesity

(42%), and diabetes (34%) were prevalent in this cohort.9 For U.S. patient data, there are no
effective point-of-care prediction models to identify COVID-19 patients at the highest risk for
mortality. According to a recent systematic review, most prediction models available by the end
of March 2020 were developed using patient data from China,17 and it is unclear if they are
generalizable to a U.S. population. Furthermore, there are no effective prediction models
specifically for identifying patients at risk of progressive disease that requires ICU admission
and use of mechanical ventilation.
An effective COVID-19 risk prediction model has the potential to aid clinical guideline
updates and guide scarce resource allocation, such as personal protective equipment, ventilators,
hospital and ICU beds, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and potential treatments. It was
reported that acute illness scores, such as the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score
were unlikely to predict critical care outcomes accurately.18,19 A risk stratification model could
also help standardize portions of COVID-19 research by deterioration risk. Thus, we created a
prognostic model to identify severe COVID-19 to be used on hospital admission. This model
was developed and validated in an urban environment with a high prevalence of COVID-19. The
cohort consists of diverse patients within a large academic medical center and four affiliated,
community hospitals serving three adjacent states in the U.S..

This retrospective cohort study included adult patients (>18 years) admitted to a large
academic medical center and community hospitals with a diagnosis of COVID-19, defined as
positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Patients were admitted between March
1st and April 30th, 2020. The study exclusion criteria were transfer from outside hospital with no
access to the data, admission to labor and delivery, and admission for a primary surgical or
trauma reason. Patients were grouped according to the severity of COVID-19. Non-severe
COVID-19 was defined as requiring hospitalization but not meeting the definition of severe
COVID-19 (defined as intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, and/or
death).

Data source and covariates
Demographics, clinical information, laboratory findings at the time of initial presentation,
as well as outcome data were obtained through review of the electronic health record (EHR, Epic
Systems Corporation, Verona, WI). Covariates included age, sex, self-reported race (White,
Black, Asian, Hispanic), smoking status, body mass index, comorbidities (coronary artery
disease [CAD], congestive heart failure [CHF], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD],
interstitial lung disease [ILD], asthma, diabetes mellitus type 1 or 2, hypertension [defined by
use of hypertension medications], end-stage renal disease [ESRD; defined by chronic dialysis]),
chronic steroid use, history of cancer, dyspnea upon presentation [defined as subjective report of
difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, or caretaker reporting they appear as such], white blood
cell count (WBC), absolute lymphocyte count, hematocrit, platelet count, serum sodium, serum

creatinine, C-reactive protein (CRP; 0-5mg/dL, 5-15mg/dL, >15mg/dL), elevated troponin
(HsTroponin T > 19ng/L; Troponin I ≥ 0.04ng/mL), creatine kinase (CK), ferritin (0-300ng/mL,
300.1-1000ng/mL, >1000ng/mL), lactate, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate
aminotransferase (AST; 0-80 IU/L, >80 IU/L), D-dimer (ng/mL), and acute kidney injury
(defined as increase in creatinine ≥ 0.3mg/dL from baseline) upon admission to the hospital. The
data points extracted were verified by two independent reviewers, with consensus reached by a
third independent reviewer if disagreement was noted. Information on race was limited to data
available within the EHR system, which classifies Hispanic as a distinct category rather than
under a separate category for ethnicity as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau.20

Outcomes
The primary outcome was a composite measure defined by ICU admission(s), use of
mechanical ventilation, and/or death within 14 days of hospitalization (referred to as “severe
COVID-19”). These outcomes were also assessed independently. The secondary outcome was
death within 14 days of hospital admission. When patients were discharged before the follow-up
period (14 days), outcome assessment was carried through readmissions if records were
available.

Counts and frequencies were used to report categorical data. Means with standard
deviation (SD) and medians with interquartile ranges (IQR) were used to report normally and
non-normally distributed data, respectively. Chi-squared tests were used for comparison of
categorical data. T-tests and Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to compare continuous data as
appropriate.
The eligible sample (n=415) was randomly split into a derivation group (75%; n=311)
and a validation group (25%; n=104). The prediction risk model was created using the derivation
sample. The derivation and validation groups were randomly selected. Covariates considered for
inclusion in the model were identified a priori without knowledge of the outcome data based on
clinical judgement and potential confounders identified in the literature.21–24 Backwards
elimination, recursive feature elimination, and clinical relevance were used for final predictor
selection. Scikit-Learn, an open source library was used for machine learning modeling and
AUC.25 Multivariable logistic regression with standard errors was used to determine the
independent association of factors and severe COVID-19. The β coefficient and adjusted odds
ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were obtained for each predictor. The model
constant and β coefficient for each predictor were used to generate the predicted probability
equation. The prediction model was assessed by the calibration plot.
The discriminative ability and performance of the model was assessed by calculating the
AUC. The Hosmer–Lemeshow test was used to assess goodness-of-fit. Statistical significance
was set a priori at p<0.05. Python (version 3.6.6), Statsmodels (version 0.9.0, for regression),
and RStudio (version 1.1.463) were used for statistical analysis. The final model’s predicted
probability equation was incorporated into a mobile-friendly web-based application

(www.covidmodel.org) developed using Scikit-Learn module. Despite institutional COVID-19
treatment guidelines, not all patients had uniform laboratory testing done at the time of
presentation, resulting in some missing data. We classified these missing laboratory values as
separate categories and tested their association with the primary outcome. Patients with missing
CRP and AST values had the lowest rates of severe COVID-19 and behaved similar to patients
with laboratory values within normal reference range. Therefore, these patients were combined
into the same category as patients within the normal reference range and kept in their respective
derivation or validation cohorts.
The Thomas Jefferson University Institutional Review Board approved this study and
waived informed consent from study participants.

Results
Participant Characteristics
A total of 415 patients with COVID-19 were included, of whom 164 (39%) developed
severe COVID-19. The median age was 66 years (IQR 54-77). The majority were male (55%)
and most were Black (44%), followed by White (34%), Asian (13%), and Hispanic (8%) (which
our EHR categorized under race). Table 1 shows univariate analyses of patient demographic and
clinical characteristics. Patients who developed severe COVID-19 were more likely to be older
(age 70.6 vs 61.4, p<0.001), male (66.3% vs 48.0%; p<0.001), and present with dyspnea (75.5%
vs 61.5%; p=0.004). They were also more likely to have a past medical history of diabetes

(44.8% vs 28.6%; p=0.001), coronary artery disease (23.3% vs 14.7%; p=0.04), and/or prior
stroke (20.2% vs 11.9%; p=0.03). Analyses of laboratory data upon presentation showed that
severe COVID-19 was associated with higher levels of CRP, AST, and D-dimer (Figure 1-A).
Notably, a CRP of 0-5 mg/dL was associated with a 27.5% rate of severe COVID-19 compared
with 40.9% in those with a CRP of 5.1-15 mg/dL and 72.5% in those with a CRP >15 mg/dL. Ddimer 0-300 ng/mL was associated with a 26.7% rate of severe COVID-19 compared with 38.9%
in those with D-dimer 300.1-1000 ng/mL and 68.8% in those with D-dimer >1000 ng/mL.
Figure 1-B shows unadjusted rates of 14-day mortality for sex, elevated troponin, and a
history of diabetes. Male sex had a higher rate of mortality (24.9% vs 16.7%, p=0.06). Patients
with diabetes had an increased rate of mortality (28.3% vs 17.4%, p=0.01). Elevated troponin
was associated with a higher rate of mortality (37.2% vs 14.8%, p<0.001). In multivariable
analysis, male sex (OR 2.44, p=0.01), diabetes (OR 2.44, p=0.01), and elevated troponin (OR
2.21, p=0.02) had significantly increased odds ratio of mortality (Table 3).

Primary and secondary outcomes
The percentage of patients developing the primary outcome of severe COVID-19 was
39.3% (n=163). Analysis of individual outcomes showed that 31.6% (n=131) of patients were
admitted to the ICU, 24.6% (n=102) required mechanical ventilation, and 21.2% (n=88) died
within 14 days of admission. Figure 2 shows the distribution of hospital days in which patients
first required mechanical ventilation. Mean time to mechanical ventilation was 3.73 hospital days
(SD 2.7). After the first two days, 55.9% (n=57) required mechanical ventilation (Figure 2).

Prediction of severe COVID-19 and validation of risk prediction model
Multivariable analyses on the training cohort demonstrated that increased age, male sex,
diabetes, dyspnea, CRP > 15 mg/dL, AST > 80 IU/L, and D-dimer > 1000 ng/mL were
independently associated with severe COVID-19 (Table 2). The strongest predictors of severe
COVID-19 were AST > 80 IU/L (OR 3.88 [95% CI 1.57-9.56], p=0.003), male sex (OR 3.04
[95% CI 1.70-5.44], p<0.001), and diabetes (OR 2.29 [95% CI 1.30-4.02], p=0.004) (Figure 3).
Variables included in the risk prediction model were age, sex, diabetes, dyspnea, CRP, AST, Ddimer, and troponin.
The model showed excellent calibration as it was well matched with the 45-degree line
(e-Figure 2) and excellent goodness-of-fit on a Hosmer and Lemeshow test (p =0.22). This
severe COVID-19 model exhibited excellent discriminative ability (AUC: derivation
cohort=0.82, validation cohort=0.82). The COVID-19 14-day mortality prediction model also
demonstrated excellent performance (AUC: derivation cohort=0.85, validation cohort=0.81). eTable 1 and 2 show adjusted odds ratio of the eight predictors used in the models including both
derivation and validation cohorts combined. The model’s sensitivity was 83%, and specificity
was 60% with the cutpoint probability of 23%. Sensitivity analysis after removing sex predictor
showed severe COVID-19 model AUC (derivation cohort=0.79, validation cohort=0.80).

The probability of the occurrence of severe COVID-19 and COVID-19-related death can
be calculated using the predicted probability equation, which is based on the model’s intercept
and coefficients from Table 2. A mobile web-based COVID-19 risk model is shown in e-Figure
3.
Case 1
A 60-year-old female with a history of diabetes presents to the hospital with dyspnea and
cough. Labs show hsTroponin T within normal limits, AST 65 IU/L, CRP 12 mg/dL, and Ddimer 280 ng/mL. Her 14-day risk of severe COVID-19 is 25.3%. Her 14-day risk of death is
4.2%.
Case 2
A 65-year-old male with no history of diabetes presents with dyspnea. Lab show
hsTroponin T 35 ng/L, AST 70 IU/L, CRP 8 mg/dL, D-dimer 700 ng/mL. His 14-day risk of
severe COVID-19 is 44.8%. His 14-day risk of death is 22.6%.

DISCUSSION
COVID-19 associated morbidity, mortality, and stress on the healthcare system is
expected to continue. To address the on-going pandemic, the addition of reliable and easy-to-use
models of deterioration to severe COVID-19 will better allow clinicians and systems to make
improved, evidenced-based patient care decisions. This study developed and internally validated
a web-based model to predict 14-day risk of progression to severe COVID-19 using a cohort of

415 diverse U.S. patients hospitalized at a large academic medical center and four community
hospitals. Compared to other large case studies in the U.S., patients in our study have similar
demographics, clinical characteristics, and mortality rates.9,26
There have been several studies from China, Italy, and the U.S. that have identified
characteristics of patients who have poor outcomes from COVID-19 based on retrospective
analyses.7,9,27–29 Similar to Zhou et al., we identified an increased risk of severe COVID-19 with
older age.13 An analysis of 1,150 adults in New York City hospitals indicated that chronic
pulmonary disease, followed by cardiovascular disease, older age, higher concentrations of
interleukin-6, and D-dimer at admission were the strongest predictors of mortality with Black
and Hispanic patients presenting later in the disease course compared to White patients.30 These
findings are similar to the clinical predictors used in our study, in which an elevated CRP and Ddimer are suggestive of a profound inflammatory state. In agreement with data from a
multicenter observational study, we found increased odds of death with male sex and history of
diabetes.31 Similarly, positive troponin was found to be associated with increased odds of death
(OR=2.21, p=0.02) which is also consistent with prior studies. 21,32 For this reason and practical
purposes, troponin was included in both the severe COVID-19 and mortality models.
Assessment of time to mechanical ventilation revealed that 55.9% were mechanically
ventilated after two days of hospitalization. Currently, there are no easy-to-use and effective
U.S.-patient-population-based methods to identify these high risk patients whose clinical picture
at the time of presentation does not suggest severe COVID-19. This point becomes particularly
relevant if one considers that a quarter (24.5%) of patients who developed severe COVID-19 did
not have dyspnea on presentation. Existing risk calculators in the literature are derived from

clinical and laboratory data from China that have not been externally validated in a U.S.
population.17,33–36 The present model addresses this knowledge gap by providing a validated
prediction model that quantifies the risk for severe disease and mortality in COVID-19 derived
from a U.S. patient population and by incorporating it into a mobile-friendly model that can be
easily accessed by anyone with internet access globally.36
The model’s potential applications are numerous. It can be leveraged to inform more
specific inclusion/exclusion criteria for COVID-19 clinical trials. Clinicians may use this model
to make informed risk-benefit decisions regarding Emergency-Use-Authorization, off-label, and
other potential therapies. The model may help hospitals and/or hospital systems to predict
imminent ICU bed and mechanical ventilator needs. Last, this model may aid emergency
medicine and non-ICU hospital clinicians to more effectively and safely triage patients to an
appropriate level of care and to make admission, discharge, and post-discharge monitoring and
follow-up decisions.
This study has several strengths. First, the study participants represent a diverse selfreported race of patients residing in three states. Second, this population represents a cohort of
inpatients that reflect common U.S. comorbid conditions which will allow wide applicability for
clinical use in the U.S. and other countries with similar demographics and comorbidity types and
rates. Third, this study is one of the first prediction models in the U.S.. Fourth, the data used for
the model development is derived from multiple hospital types including a large academic center
and several community hospitals thereby reducing the likelihood that observed outcomes are
confounded by a single institution's unique treatment approach. Last, the model is available for
real-time clinical use via a web-based calculator.

This study is not without limitations. First, the data was extracted retrospectively, relied
on EHR provider documentation, and was limited to variables contained in the EHR. To help
ensure data validity, the variables and outcomes of interest were extracted by physicianinvestigators and validated by an independent researcher. Second, the sample size is relatively
small compared to larger studies from China. These models had excellent performance during
the internal validation process, therefore, we chose to prioritize the dissemination given the
urgent need of prediction models tailored specifically to the U.S. to care for patients suffering
from COVID-19. Third, given the rapidly changing “standard of care” for COVID-19 and
institutional efforts to educate clinicians in near real-time, there was likely significant practice
variation both within each hospital and between hospitals between March 1, 2020 and April 30,
2020 that might affect outcomes. Nonetheless, we have provided a mobile-friendly model for
prediction of severe COVID-19 upon presentation.

Conclusion
In conclusion, this study presents an internally-validated prediction model for progression
to severe COVID-19 and mortality in hospitalized patients that can be used in real-time at the
bedside.
