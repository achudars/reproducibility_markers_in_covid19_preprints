Abstract

34

To assess the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on seasonal respiratory viruses, absolute

35

case counts and viral reproductive rates from 2019-2020 were compared against previous

36

seasons. Our findings suggest that the public health measures implemented to reduce SARS-

37

CoV-2 transmission significantly reduced the transmission of other respiratory viruses.

39

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has

40

resulted in over 7.4 million cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and over 210,000

41

deaths in the United States alone, as of October 7, 2020 [1]. The introduction of SARS-CoV-2

42

into the northern hemisphere in January 2020 overlapped with the peak circulation of seasonal

43

respiratory viruses that include influenza A and B and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Like

44

SARS-CoV-2, these viruses are also spread primarily through droplet and contact transmission

45

routes, with concern that co-circulating respiratory pandemics could further stress our healthcare

46

systems and economy [2, 3].

47

The danger represented by the unchecked spread of SARS-CoV-2 prompted a massive

48

rollout of population-level non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to curb transmission,

49

including stay-at-home orders, the closure of schools and retail spaces, mandated face masks in

50

public, and encouragement of social distancing and hand hygiene. Studies from Hong Kong,

51

France, Japan, Singapore and Australia have shown these measures have also coincided with a

52

decline in the number of cases of the seasonal respiratory viruses over the same time period, as

53

compared to prior seasons [3-7]. A similar trend occurred in the U.S., with the number of people

54

with influenza-like illness (ILI) [8] for the 2019-2020 season decreasing earlier than expected as

55

compared to the 2015-2016, 2008-2009, and 2002-2003 influenza seasons [9].

56

In this study, we sought to define the impact of NPIs intended to curb SARS-CoV-2

57

transmission on the rates of infection from influenza A, influenza B and RSV in two large U.S

58

academic centers located in Atlanta, Georgia and Boston, Massachusetts from January through

59

May 2020. The heterologous impact of NPIs has important implications for clinicians and

60

laboratories preparing for future respiratory virus seasons.

61

We conducted a retrospective review of medical records for all inpatient and outpatient

62

adults who underwent testing for respiratory viruses over the previous 5 seasons (09/01/2015 –

63

05/30/2020), at the Emory Healthcare system (EHC) and associated clinics in Atlanta (n =46,575

64

people) and the Mass General Brigham (MGB) Healthcare System in Boston (n = 107,260

65

people). Each respiratory virus season was defined as beginning on September 01 (week 36) of a

66

given year and extending through May 30 (week 22) of the following year. The weeks were

67

assigned according to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) week date

68

standard, which defines the start and end of a week on Monday and Sunday, respectively.

69

Specimens were obtained using nasopharyngeal swabs and tested by the eSensor® Respiratory

70

Viral Panel (GenMark Diagnostics, Inc., Carlsbad, CA) at EHC and the Cepheid Xpert or the

71

Hologic Panther Fusion at MGB, per manufacturer instructions. A small subset of patients at

72

MGB and EHC were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using oropharyngeal swabs and lower respiratory

73

tract samples. Total cases of influenza A and B, RSV, and SARS-CoV-2 were calculated for

74

each week of each season. These case counts were then used to calculate the pathogen-specific

75

reproductive number over time, Rt, given by the ratio of the number of new positive cases in one

76

week to the number of positive cases in the previous week. A reproductive number greater than

77

1.0 corresponds to an increase in the number of cases between two consecutive weeks, whereas a

78

value between zero and 1.0 corresponds to a decrease.

79

To evaluate the impact of NPIs, we compared the Rt for influenza A, influenza B, and

80

RSV averaged over all previous seasons to the current season (2019-2020) using a bootstrapping

81

approach. Specifically, we first drew randomly from a binomial distribution to generate absolute

82

counts for each virus, for each week of each season. The binomial distributions were

83

parameterized using the number of tests in a given week as the number of trials and the percent

84

of tests positive for the virus as the success probability. Once values of absolute counts were

85

drawn, the bootstrapped Rt value for that pair of consecutive weeks was generated by taking the

86

ratio of the counts in one week to the counts in the previous week. This procedure was repeated

87

to generate 1,000 independent samples. Mean Rt values were calculated for a given pair of

88

consecutive weeks by averaging over a set of four Rt values drawn from the bootstrapped

89

samples, representing one value from each of the previous four seasons (2015-2016 through

90

2018-2019). Similarly, 95% CIs were calculated from the distribution of Rt values generated by

91

the bootstrapped samples for each week of each season. We utilized only the first positive test

92

for each patient, to reduce bias introduced by patients with persistently positive tests. For the

93

2019-2020 season, mean Rt values and 95% CI were calculated. All analyses were conducted

94

using R (v 4.0.0).

95

For influenza A infections in Atlanta, the effective reproductive number Rt dropped

96

below 1.0 on week 12 of the 2019-2010 season, whereas in previous seasons the effective

97

reproductive number did not consistently drop below 1.0 prior to week 15 (Figure 1). This

98

decrease in influenza A cases coincides with the first detection of SARS-CoV-2 cases in Atlanta,

99

which began in week 11, and coincides with the city of Atlanta restricting large gatherings,

100

closing bars, and issuing a stay-at-home order (weeks 12-13). Case counts for influenza B fell to

101

near zero cases per week after week 13, precluding the calculation of reproductive numbers. In

102

prior years, Rt values decreased to <1.0 after week 15, which shows that rates of influenza B

103

infections decreased earlier in the 2019-2020 season relative to past seasons. In Atlanta, RSV Rt

104

values did not drop below 1.0 until week 13 during the current season and week 14 for previous

105

seasons (Supplemental Figure 1).

106

Similar trends were observed in Boston (Figure 1). For influenza A infections in Boston,

107

the effective reproductive number Rt dipped below 1.0 on week 7 and fell to 0 at week 14 of the

108

2019-2020 season. The effective Rt for influenza A in previous seasons did not remain below 1.0

109

before week 15. For influenza B, Rt was consistently below 1.0 at week 11 while the Rt of

110

influenza B in past seasons did not consistently drop below 1.0 before week 15. In Boston,

111

social gatherings were restricted to 25 people or less on week 11, and stay-at-home advisories

112

were issued on week 13, which corresponds to the decrease of influenza A and B cases. For

113

RSV, Rt predominantly fell below 1.0 from weeks 12-15 for the 2019-2020 season while

114

previous seasons’ Rt values remained above 1.0.

115

The implementation of NPIs was a critical factor in reducing the spread of SARS-CoV-2

116

globally. We provide evidence from two geographically distinct metropolitan U.S. cities that

117

NPIs may also have exerted a collateral beneficial effect on influenza A and B and RSV by

118

virtue of reducing opportunities for transmission. Although the overall case counts of SARS-

119

CoV-2 and the response to the pandemic differed in Atlanta and Boston, the results demonstrate

120

the importance of social distancing measures. These findings should help inform pre- and post-

121

test probabilities when evaluating patients presenting with symptoms consistent with an upper or

122

lower respiratory tract viral syndrome, as well as the interpretation of respiratory virus panel

123

testing performed for asymptomatic screening purposes.

124

The dynamics of influenza, RSV, and SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology are complex, and the

125

interplay between these respiratory viruses will become increasingly important to dissect as a

126

new influenza season emerges in the fall of 2020. Globally, the effects of decreased influenza

127

cases from January to May 2020, due to either decreased transmission or decreased surveillance,

128

may confound the ability to accurately predict which strains will be circulating in the fall. With

129

decreased international travel and border restrictions, there may also be a change in the temporal

130

dynamics of influenza illness in 2020-2021, and the circulating strains may differ from those

131

predicted in February 2020. Further study is warranted to determine the downstream effects that

132

SARS-CoV-2 will have on influenza transmission and epidemiological trends.

133

Limitations which must be acknowledged include the possibility of decreased reporting

134

of influenza and RSV in March due to a decline in overall outpatient clinic visits (Supplemental

135

Figure 2, total influenza and RSV tests conducted), preservation of viral media and equipment

136

for SARS-CoV-2 testing, and transitions in hospitals to prioritize SARS-CoV-2 testing over

137

other viral diagnostics for hospitalized patients [10]. Complex viral factors and dynamics

138

between circulating SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses may have also influenced this trend.

139

The phenomenon of respiratory virus “interference” has been described for epidemics of

140

influenza and other respiratory viruses, in which one epidemic delays the start or accelerates the

141

end of the other viral epidemic [11-13]. The underlying immune mechanisms for virus

142

interference are not well elucidated but may be due to temporary non-specific immunity for a

143

given acute respiratory infection [14].

144

In summary, the data demonstrate that NPIs are likely effective in reducing both

145

influenza and SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Concurrent epidemics of influenza and SARS-CoV-2

146

have the potential to result in diagnostic confusion, and significant morbidity and mortality and

147

could overwhelm the healthcare system. Consequently, NPIs, in addition to widespread

148

utilization and uptake of influenza vaccination, will be important public health tools to deploy to

149

mitigate the threat of these respiratory viruses. Ongoing diagnostic and surveillance efforts for

150

influenza, RSV and SARS-CoV-2 must be maintained to further explore the transmission

151

mechanisms and interplay between these respiratory viruses.
